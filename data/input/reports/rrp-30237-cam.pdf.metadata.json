NGOs  will  be  licensed  as\nmicrofinance  institutions  under  the  new  regulatory\nframework  of  the  financial  sector,  and  will  provide  full\nfinancial services in the rural area, including the savings\nfacilities. Under the Project, licensed financial institutions\n(LFIs) will increase their operational efficiency in financial\nintermediation  by  improving  their  banking  skills  and\nfinancial management, and through increased competition\namong  LFIs  and  with  other  financial  institutions.  A\nrevolving  fund  will  be  established  in  the  Rural\nDevelopment  Bank  (RDB),  a  wholesale  banking\ninstitution, which will channel funds through LFIs to their\nsubborrowers.  These  funds  will  be  provided  for  small-\nscale economic activities in agriculture, agro-processing,\ntrading,  livestock,  handicrafts,  and  services  by  the\nsubborrowers, who are mostly poor people in the rural\narea.\nClassification Primary: Poverty reduction\nEnvironment\nAssessment Category B\nAn  Initial  Environmental  Examination  (IEE)  was\nundertaken, and a summary IEE is a core appendix.\nRationale Cambodia is one of the world's lowest-income countries.\nAbout 90 percent of the country\u2019s poor people live in the\nrural  areas.  The  lack  of  access  to  reliable  financial\nservices is a major constraint to the reduction of rural\npoverty in Cambodia. No formal financial services exist\nin the rural areas. Of the country's 24 provinces, 15 have\nno commercial bank branches. In the provinces where\nbranches exist, they are located only in primary towns. To\nmake up for this deficiency, NGOs have been providing\nrural households  with credit  and savings services and\nhave reached about 11 percent of rural households. Most\nrural households, however, have no access to financial\nservices and rely solely on informal moneylenders and\nmiddlemen in agricultural trade, who charge high interest\nrates, often up to 10 percent per month. Reliance on\nthese  moneylenders  makes  it difficult for  the poor  to\nescape from their poverty cycle. Despite the large unmet\ndemand for rural credit, estimated in the range of $50-100\nmillion,  the  expansion  of  NGOs\u2019  rural  credit  is  being", "iii\nconstrained by  the  limited  sources  of  financing.  Thus,\nthere is a strong need for capital injection and savings\nmobilization  to  provide  increased  access  to  financial\nservices  for  the  rural  poor.  The  Project  supports  the\noperational  strategy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank\n(ADB) for steady reduction of poverty in Cambodia, and\nwill contribute to the development of sound regulatory and\ninstitutional  frameworks,  which  are  essential  for\nsustainable microfinance services in the rural areas.\nObjectives and Scope The primary objective of the Project is to develop effective\nfinancial services in the rural areas, which will provide\npoor households with better access to rural finance. This\nwill be based on a private sector initiative of NGOs that\nhave demonstrated viable systems of credit delivery and\nachieved  substantial  outreach.  The  project  scope  will\ninclude the provision of credit lines to finance  income-\ngenerating activities of the rural poor, support for rural\ncredit  and  savings  schemes  of  LFIs,  and  provision  of\nproject  management  support  for  the  RDB,  which  will\nchannel  funds  to  LFIs.  The  Project  will  cover  the\noperations  of  LFIs  throughout  Cambodia,  but  will  be\ninitially implemented mainly in the northwestern, eastern,\nand southern regions, where the MFIs are currently active.\nCost Estimates The total cost of the Project is estimated at $26.56 million,\nincluding contingencies and taxes. The foreign exchange\ncost is $13.76 million (52 percent) and the local currency\ncost is $12.80 million equivalent (48 percent).\nFinancing Plan\nSource Foreign     Local    Total Percent\nExchange   Currency    Cost\n            ($million)\nADB 13.76 6.24   20.00  75\nGovernment   0.00 2.72  2.72  10\nLFIs   0.00 3.84  3.84  15\nTotal 13.76     12.80   26.56      100\nLoan Amount and Terms The equivalent in various currencies of Special Drawing\nRights 14,872,000 ($20 million) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds\nResources, with a maturity of 32 years, including a grace\nperiod of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1.0 percent\nper annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per\nannum thereafter to be paid semiannually.\nRelending Terms The  Government  will  provide  RDB  with  lines  of  credit\nunder a subsidiary loan agreement. It will cover a period\nof 20 years and include a repayment schedule similar to\nthat between the Government and ADB. The credit lines\nwill be provided to RDB at rates not less than the rate for", "iv\nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, which is currently 6.46\npercent per annum, and is considered to reflect a long-\nterm cost of funds.\nRDB  will  onlend  funds  to  LFIs  at  a  rate  that  covers\nadministrative and financial  risk  charges appropriate to\nand calculated for each LFI. The interest spread to be\nretained  by  RDB  will  be  initially  up  to  4  percent  per\nannum. The loan term for LFIs will be for a period of 18\nmonths for the first loan under the Project and may be\nextended later up  to five  years, subject  to satisfactory\nperformance  of  LFIs.  Interest  rates  from  LFIs  to  their\nsubborrowers  will  reflect  the  prevailing  market  rates,\nwhich will be sufficient to recover LFIs\u2019 operating costs to\nensure  their  sustainable  activities.  These  rates  are\nexpected  to  decline  rapidly  as  LFIs  improve  their\noperational efficiency and through increased competition\namong LFIs.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 31 December 2005\nExecuting Agencies The  Rural Development Bank (RDB) and  the  National\nBank of Cambodia (NBC)\nImplementation\n    Arrangements RDB will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the credit\nlines of the Project, assuming overall responsibility for\nthe implementation of microfinance operations, and NBC\nwill be the EA for LFI supervision. RDB will act as a\nwholesale banking  institution  to  provide funds only to\nlicensed financial institutions including LFIs. ADB funds\nwill pass through the Government to RDB for the credit\nline and for the expenses relating to project management\nsupport for the project management unit (PMU). NBC will\nassume overall responsibility for the supervision of LFIs\nthrough its Microfinance Institution Supervision Division.\nProcurement The Project requires the procurement of service vehicles,\nequipment,  and  small  civil  works  for  RDB.  Supply\ncontracts and civil works envisaged under the Project will\nbe limited in size, and will be awarded on the basis of\ndirect purchase or local competitive bidding procedures\nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.\nRDB  should  ensure  that  the  goods  and  services\nprocured  are  reasonably  priced  and  suitable  for  the\nproject  activities,  and  that  fair  canvassing  is  done  in\nselecting suppliers. With respect to the procurement of\ngoods  and  services  to  be  made  by  LFIs  and  their\nsubborrowers  under  the  Project,  normal  commercial\npractices  appropriate  under  the  circumstances  in  the\nlocal trade will be applicable.", "v\nConsulting Services A total of 6 person-months of international and 9 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services will be provided\nunder  the  Project  to  support  the  PMU  in  project\nimplementation.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of\nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB\nfor the engagement of domestic consultants.\nEstimated Project\n      Completion Date 30 June 2005\nProject Benefits and\nBeneficiaries The Project will contribute substantially to the national\ngoal  of  poverty  reduction  through  the  provision  of\nincome-generating  activities  and  sustainable  savings\nfacilities for households in the rural areas, where about\n90  percent  of  the  poor  people  live.  During  the\nimplementation period, the Project is expected to directly\nbenefit about 260,000 rural households. Based on  the\nNGOs' current activities in rural finance, more than 70\npercent of these households are expected to be poor\nhouseholds  in  the  rural  areas.  The  subprojects  to  be\nfinanced are viable, with financial internal rates of return\nin the range of 23-91 percent, and the economic internal\nrates of return of 13-62 percent. More than 50 percent of\nthe subborrowers are expected to be rural women, who\nwill represent their households and can enhance their\nhouseholds'  access  to  other  social  services  being\nprovided by the prospective LFIs.\nThe  Project  will  also  lay  the  foundation  for  the\ndevelopment  of  the  country\u2019s  formal  rural  financial\nsystem.  The  system  will  contribute  to  the  financial\ndeepening through introduction of savings schemes in\nrural areas, and is expected eventually to integrate with\nthe  overall  financial  sector.  The  Project  will  help\nstrengthen  LFIs'  institutional  capabilities  for  providing\nsustainable  financial  services  in  the  rural  areas  to\nrevitalize  rural  economy.  Throughout  the  rural\ndevelopment  process,  the  Project  will  be  able  to\nminimize the risk of adverse environmental impact and\nsafeguard and enhance the natural resource base in the\ncountry by instilling sound practices for environmental\nmanagement into LFI activities.", "", "I.          THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed loan\nto the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Rural Credit and Savings Project.\nII.          INTRODUCTION\n2. In response to the request of the Government, the Asian Development Bank (ADB)\nprovided technical  assistance  (TA)  to  prepare  the  Rural  Credit  and  Savings  Project  (the\nProject) to address the need for effective financial services in the rural area.1 The TA was\nimplemented from September 1998 to February 1999. A series of participatory workshops\nwere organized under the TA to ensure that key stakeholders, including relevant Government\nagencies,  commercial  banks,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  potential  project\nbeneficiaries in the rural areas, were extensively consulted in formulating the Project. ADB\nfielded a fact-finding  mission  in  March  1999  and  an appraisal  mission  in  June  19992  to\nexamine  the  details of the  Project.  A follow-up  consultation  mission  visited  Cambodia  in\nJanuary 2000 to confirm the establishment of the necessary regulatory framework related to\nthe Project. The logical framework for the Project is in Appendix 1.\nIII.          BACKGROUND\nA. Sector Description\n1. Rural Economy\n3. Cambodia\u2019s real gross domestic product (GDP) was growing at an average annual rate\nof 6.7 percent between 1991 and 1996. However, due to the political turmoil in Cambodia and\nthe financial crisis in the region, the real GDP growth declined to 2.6 percent in 1997 and to 1.3\npercent in 1998. The main source of the past growth was the industrial sector, which grew at an\naverage rate of 13.8 percent per annum during 1991-1996. By comparison, agricultural growth\nwas rather sluggish at an average rate of 2.7 percent per annum during the same period. This\nrate of growth was slightly higher than the estimated rate of population growth at about 2.4\npercent. As a consequence, the share of agriculture (including livestock, fisheries, and forestry)\nin the country\u2019s GDP declined from 51.8 percent in 1991 to 38.3 percent in 1998. Cambodia is\none of the lowest-income countries in the world with its GDP per capita being estimated at\n$252 at the  current  exchange  rate.  In  terms  of  social  capacity  for  human  development,\nCambodia is now ranked 137th, with its Human Development Index estimated at 0.514.3\n4. The rural economy is the dominant part of the Cambodian economy with about 85\npercent of the population living in rural areas. Poverty incidence is estimated at 36 percent for\nthe whole country and 40 percent for the rural areas based on the reference food bundle,\n                                               \n1 TA 2818-CAM: Rural Credit and Savings Project, for $600,000, approved on 26 June 1997.\n2  The  Mission consisted  of  M. Otsuka  (Sr.  Project  Economist),  H.  Pitney  (Sr.  Counsel),  D. Walton  (Rural\nDevelopment  Specialist),  M.  Katagami  (Young  Professional),  D.

Human Development Report, New York.", "2\nyielding  2,100 calories  per  day,  and  some  nonfood  allowance.4  In  Cambodia,  poverty  is\nconcentrated in the rural areas as rural households account for about 90 percent of the poor\npopulation in the country. Poverty incidence is particularly high in remote provinces in the\nnortheastern and southeastern regions. Poor households are usually larger in size than the\naverage and are headed by people who are illiterate or have had few years of schooling. Such\nhouseholds  are  heavily  handicapped  in  terms  of  (i)  ownership  of  assets,  including  land,\nhousing and cattle; (ii) access to basic social services such as health, education, and water\nsupply; and (iii) access to financial services.\n5. About 20 percent of poor households are headed by women in Cambodia. Households\nheaded by young women with infants are highly vulnerable to poverty and food insecurity due\nto the lack of access to land, credit, and other agricultural inputs. Commonly cited causes for\nrural  poverty  in  Cambodia  include  (i)  decades  of  internal  armed  conflicts  and  their\nconsequences, (ii) low agricultural productivity, (iii) high  degree of  indebtedness, and  (iv)\ninadequate public facilities for social services. Even many of those who are living above the\npoverty line, live close to it in a near-poverty situation. Due to the importance of rice in people\u2019s\ndiet in the country, the availability of rice mainly affects food security and nutrition, and the\nwelfare of the rural population. When there is a bad harvest, rural households need off-farm\nemployment to supplement their income or are forced to borrow money from relatives or\ninformal moneylenders for food. Access to reliable credit and savings facilities are essential to\nimprove the livelihood of poor households in rural Cambodia.\n6. Agriculture,  which  is  the  primary  source  of  income  in  rural  areas,  is  generally\nsubsistence-oriented with rice as the dominant crop. Rice is mainly cultivated in areas along\nthe Mekong River and around the Tonle Sap Lake. About 2.1 million hectares (ha) or more\nthan 90 percent of the total cropped area of 2.3 million ha are planted with rice. Other major\nagricultural crops include maize (44,100 ha), soybeans (30,600 ha), vegetables (29,100 ha),\nand mung beans (25,600 ha).5 Rubber and timber have long been the most important export\nproducts of Cambodia, but agricultural products are increasingly being traded with neighboring\ncountries. Based on the recent surveys, the average farm size is estimated at 1.10-1.26 ha.\nHowever, such national averages mask considerable differences in average farm size between\nprovinces, ranging from 0.55 ha in Kandal Province in the south to 2.10 ha in Mondol Kiri\nProvince in the east. About three-quarters of rural households are also engaged in livestock\nproduction.\n7. Recent declines in crop yields were mainly caused by irregular weather conditions,\nparticularly rainfall unfavorable for rainfed rice cultivation, and by the shortage of irrigation\nfacilities. Less than 10 percent of the cultivated area in Cambodia is irrigated. The country\u2019s\nannual yield of unhusked rice was estimated at 1.7 tons per ha in 1998. This yield level is\nconsidered to be the lowest in the region and has slightly improved from 1.0 ton per ha in\n1967. Constraints to the improvement of agricultural productivity include (i) poor conditions of\ntransport infrastructure in rural areas, (ii) inadequate irrigation facilities particularly for rice\ncultivation, (iii) ineffective agricultural research and extension services, and (iv) lack of reliable\nand easily accessible financial services. Provision of better access to a package of necessary\ninputs such as improved seed varieties, fertilizers, and pesticides is also required for increased\n                                               \n4  Ministry of Planning, the Royal Government of Cambodia. 1997.

Nevertheless, there was a slight increase in total rice production,\nestimated at about 3.50 million tons in 1998 as compared with 3.45 million tons in 1997.\n8. Under the Government\u2019s liberalization policies and structural reform measures in the\npast few  years, extensive  systems  for  marketing  of  agricultural  inputs  and  outputs  have\ngradually developed throughout the country. ADB has been supporting the Government in\nimplementing  these  reform  measures  under  the  Agriculture  Sector  Program,6  including\nmeasures to improve agricultural marketing. There are at  least  20  major  private fertilizer\nwholesalers comprising the first tier of the distribution channel. Each wholesaler serves 15\u201325\nretailers in the districts where it operates. Most retailers have a variety of other products to\ncomplement their fertilizer business. A similar but a far more complex network has developed\nfor the marketing of agricultural products. There are a wide variety of marketing channels\ncomprising farmers and dealers who have combinations of functions for collecting, milling,\nstoring,  retailing, and  wholesaling.  These  input  and  output  trades  are  efficient  as  far  as\nphysical conditions permit, and the system is flexible, adapting to new opportunities. There is\nsubstantial room for the expansion of marketing if adequate credit is available to finance these\nactivities.\n2. Rural Financial Services\n9. About 40 percent of the country\u2019s rural population have no commercial bank branches\nin their provinces, and, where branches exist, their services are confined to primary towns. Due\nto remoteness and the high administrative costs involved, commercial banks cannot effectively\ndeliver  small-scale  financial  services,  which  are  required  in  villages  to  provide  funds  for\ninvestment in a wide range of economic activities. The demand for these services in rural\nareas  are  met  by  NGOs  and  individual  moneylenders,  including  relatives,  friends,  and\nmiddlemen in the agricultural trade. Individual moneylenders often charge high interest rates,\nup to 10 percent per month or equivalent to 120 percent per annum. The lack of reliable\nfinancial services is a major constraint to the reduction of rural poverty in Cambodia.\n10. Relevant surveys indicate that the credit demand for on-farm and off-farm activities in\nrural areas is substantial and only partly met, due to the inadequate supply of funds.7 These\nsurveys  were  conducted  mainly  through  interviews  with  farmers,  moneylenders,  local\nadministration officials, and traders in their areas of operation, and for both group-based and\nindividual business loans. The surveys reported that about 20 percent of the total households\nin the surveyed areas required group-based business loans and that about 8 percent of the\ntotal households need individual loans. Based on the average size of outstanding group-based\nloans, estimated at about $50 per household, and that for individual loans, at about $300, the\ntotal demand for credit in the country is estimated at about $85 million. Other surveys indicated\nhigher figures of $120-130 million. Regarding the supply of rural credit, the socioeconomic\nsurvey conducted by the Ministry of Planning indicated that about 30 percent of interviewed\nhouseholds had access to loans from NGOs or individual moneylenders. Assuming that the\nsame proportion of rural households received loans in 1998, about 560,000 households were\nable to have access to loans. The total amount of agricultural loans provided from these\nsources was estimated at $8 million while that for off-farm business activities was at $24\n                                               \n6 Loan 1445-CAM: Agriculture Sector Program, for $30 million, approved on 20 June 1996.\n7 Ministry of Planning, the Royal Government of Cambodia. 1998. Socioeconomic Survey of Cambodia 1997,\nPhnom Penh. The surveys undertaken by the Association of Cambodian Local Economic Development Agencies\n(ACLEDA) in 1998 and Groupe de Recherche et d\u2019Echanges Technologique (GRET) in 1997 were also used for\nsupplementary information.", "4\nmillion. One of the NGOs also estimated that the total supply of rural credit in Cambodia was\nabout $27 million in 1998.\n11. Based on these estimates, the total demand for rural credit is likely to be $80-130\nmillion, with the unmet demand of $50-100 million. The medium- to long-term projections for\nthe demand and supply of rural credit will be more complicated because of difficulties involved\nin estimating the rate of overall economic growth, the need for and the type of investment in\nrural enterprises, and future business plans of NGOs and commercial banks. However, the\ndemand is likely to grow rapidly in view of the improved political and security situation in the\ncountry and the Government\u2019s commitment to hasten rural development.\n12. The total domestic savings rate in Cambodia was 5 percent of GDP in 1997, which is\nthe lowest in Southeast Asia.8 The total amount of private savings recently declined due to the\npolitical turmoil in 1997 and 1998, and the decline in public confidence in banks. However, the\nrecent ADB study has indicated that there is clearly a strong demand for saving among rural\ncommunities  if  reliable  savings  facilities  are  available.9  The  improvement  of  the  overall\nenvironment in the financial sector and the expansion of financial services, particularly in the\nrural area, are essential for savings mobilization in the country. Some NGOs have introduced\ncompulsory savings schemes in conjunction with their credit operations, but are not able to\nmobilize  a  substantial  amount  of  savings.  Frequently,  these  savings  are  considered  an\nadditional cost of borrowing due to low interest earnings, which are often lower than the rate of\ninflation. Some schemes do not have a clear mechanism for the withdrawal of savings and for\nthe ownership of saved funds. There are programs where savings become the property of the\ncommunity for use in social programs.\n13. The  current  savings  schemes  of  some  NGOs  accompany  their  group  lending\noperations and are supported by group borrowers with very small financial transactions. For\ninstance, one NGO introduced a scheme where each borrower was required to deposit KR300\n($0.08) per week so that borrowers could easily practice saving. However, the total amount of\nsavings mobilized in the scheme was so small that the annual cost of administering the\nscheme was substantially higher than the margin expected from the operation of deposited\nfunds. It is generally accepted among NGOs that, in addition to funds from external funding\nagencies, domestic resources need to be mobilized through savings schemes to finance the\nexpansion of their credit operations in rural areas. Their savings schemes cannot be confined\nto their borrowers only. Under the new regulatory framework established in November 1999,\nNGOs can be converted into licensed financial institutions and can provide both credit and\nsavings services for rural communities. Public confidence in the rural financial services will also\nbe gradually developed. The provision of savings schemes will enable rural households to\nmeet their demand for emergency funds from their savings and to hold liquidity as deposits\nrather than in the form of non-earning assets such as cash, jewelry, and gold.\n3. Financial Sector\n14. The banking system in Cambodia was completely destroyed during the Khmer Rouge\nperiod.  Subsequently,  the  country  had  a  monobanking  system  of  the  National  Bank  of\nCambodia (NBC), operating through its provincial branches. Structural reforms were initiated in\n1989 through a Government decree to establish a two-tier banking system by separating the\nfunction of commercial banks from NBC, which has been the central bank in Cambodia since\n                                               \n8 IN.305-98:Country Economic Review, Cambodia, 17 December 1998.\n9  TA 2601-CAM: Rural Credit Review, for $100,000, approved on 4 July 1996.", "5\nthen.  This  decree  allowed  the  formation  of  private  commercial  banks  as  limited  liability\ncompanies. In 1991, the first private commercial bank was established as a joint venture\nbetween NBC and the Siam Commercial Bank of Thailand. Commercial banks operated under\nthe framework of a law on the supervision of financial institutions, which was enacted in August\n1992, and a subdecree on supervision of commercial banks approved in November 1992. This\nlegal framework has been replaced by a new, more comprehensive law on banking and financial\ninstitutions,  which  was  enacted  in  November  1999.  This  new  law  has  introduced  more\nappropriate definitions for banking activities and a refined legal framework for banks. It also\nallows microfinance institutions (MFIs) to undertake financial operations under the supervision of\nNBC.\n15. At present, 31 commercial banks and 20 provincial branches of NBC are operating. NBC\nintends  to  streamline  its  branches,  but  the  progress  has  been  slow.  The  total  amount  of\noutstanding loans of commercial banks as of the end of December 1999 was estimated at\nKR751 billion ($198 million). Commercial banks concentrate on credit to trading and services,\nwhich comprises 51 percent of their total loan portfolio. Credit for agriculture-related activities\naccounts for only about 4 percent of total loans outstanding of commercial banks. Since March\n1995, banks have been allowed to set their interest rates freely. The Government reconfirmed\nthis policy in conjunction with ADB\u2019s Agriculture Sector Program Loan (footnote 6). Interest rates\non deposits and lending in local currency are quoted in riel, and the rates on foreign exchange\ndeposits and lending in US dollars. The ranges of annual interest rates on deposits are 4.0\u201312.0\npercent for riel and 3.5\u20138.5 percent for dollars. For commercial bank credit, the range in interest\nrates is up to 24.0 percent for 12 months in riel while the range is 16.5\u201319.0 percent for dollars.\nLess than 4 percent of the total credit of commercial banks is in local currency.\n16. Foreign currencies, mostly the US dollar and to a  lesser extent the Thai baht, are\ncommonly used by the public in Cambodia. This was mainly caused by the destruction of the\nmonetary and banking systems during the Khmer Rouge period, and reflects the lack of public\nconfidence in the local currency and the banking system. The use of foreign currencies has\nsomewhat protected Cambodia from the adverse impact of the recent financial crisis in the\nregion. The Government aims at a gradual decrease in the use of the US dollar, only through\nincreased awareness and confidence of the public in the use of the  local currency.10  The\nprogress however is rather slow, and foreign currencies, particularly the US dollar, have a\ndominant role in the country\u2019s economy. The overview of the financial sector is presented in\nAppendix 2.\n4. Operations of Nongovernment Organizations\n17. According to a recent report of the Cooperation Committee for Cambodia, which is an\nassociation of NGOs in Cambodia, 163 domestic NGOs are registered with the Ministry of\nInterior  and 133 foreign  NGOs are  registered  with  various  Government  agencies.  NGOs\ndisburse  about  $75  million  each  year  for  a  wide  range  of  their  development  activities,\nequivalent to more than 20 percent of the Government\u2019s annual budget. The important role of\nNGOs for the reconstruction and development of the country is increasingly recognized by the\npublic, the Government, and the external funding agencies in Cambodia. Main areas of NGO\nactivities include agriculture and rural development, health, education, water, and sanitation.\nNGOs are also active in providing assistance to vulnerable groups and in clearing land mines.\n                                               \n10The Prime Minister\u2019s speech at the NBC\u2019s Annual Conference on 24 March 1999.", "6\n18. The agenda and the operational strategies of NGOs in Cambodia have changed as the\npolitical, social, and economic environment in the country evolved from a planned socialist\nstructure to that of a liberal market system. Most domestic NGOs are small, and often operate in\nspecific geographical areas or sectors  in  collaboration  with  international  NGOs  or  external\nfunding agencies. Many domestic NGOs are regarded as adopted, emerging from international\nNGOs,  and  receiving  support  from  their  parent  organizations.  But  they  are  increasingly\ndiversifying  their  operations  and  becoming  less  dependent  upon  a  single  agency  for  their\noperational support. The scope of international NGO operations is more diverse and covers wide\ngeographical areas. The cooperation between the Government and NGOs still consists largely of\ninformation exchanges. A mechanism for effective collaboration in development activities is yet\nto be developed due to the lack of adequate capacity and skills on both sides. However, there is\na constructive relationship between the Government and NGOs in development activities based\non increasing mutual understanding. NGOs in Cambodia enjoy extensive cooperation with a\nlarge number of external funding agencies. Bilateral funding agencies often work directly with\nNGOs through direct funding to the programs of NGOs or through NGOs\u2019 participation in projects\nfinanced by such agencies. There are a few sector-based groups of NGOs, for exchanges of\ninformation and views, including one for rural credit operations.\n19. About 90  NGOs  operate  rural  credit facilities.11  NGOs  have  expanded  their  credit\noperations to reach about 11 percent of rural households. Most clients of NGOs\u2019 credit facilities\nare poor households in rural areas. These NGOs provide loans to groups, with first-cycle loans\nto poor people of the same occupation or type of business. Loans are usually provided on a\nsix-month  cycle  and  mostly  used  for  activities  related  to  agriculture  and  agro-based\nbusinesses. Loans for individuals are provided based on the borrowers\u2019 performance with their\nfirst-cycle loans. The lending rates of NGOs are still high, at flat rates of 3.0\u20136.0 percent per\nmonth or 36.0\u201372.0 percent annually, reflecting high administrative costs of NGO operations.\nSmaller credit operating NGOs have compulsory savings requirements where group members\ncontrol their savings and use these savings for lending among themselves.\n20. Major NGOs having credit operations are being monitored by NBC based on the data\nvoluntarily provided by these NGOs with respect to borrowers, loans outstanding, and interest\nrates.  As  these  schemes  of  NGOs  expand  rapidly,  a  proper  system  of  regulation  and\nsupervision urgently needs to be institutionalized to ensure sound financial management and\nincrease public  confidence  in  rural  financial  services.  In  this  context,  NBC  introduced  in\nJanuary 2000 a new regulation for licensing and supervising these NGOs as licensed MFIs.12\nThe credit and savings operations of NGOs are described in Appendix 3.\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n21. The  Government\u2019s  medium-term  development  objectives  are  set  out  in  its  first\nSocioeconomic  Development  Plan  (SEDP:  1996\u20132000)  with  expected  public  investment\nprograms  totaling  $2.2  billion.  The  SEDP  is  the  first  medium-term  plan  in  line  with  the\nGovernment\u2019s market-oriented policy. The Government considers in the SEDP  that poverty\nreduction is the most important medium- to long-term objective to be focused on the rural areas.\nThe Government\u2019s general strategy for poverty  reduction  in  the SEDP  aims at addressing\naspects of poverty by (i) providing social services in an equitable manner, (ii) ensuring the\n                                               \n11In addition, three Government-administered lending programs are financed by the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund\n(UNICEF), the European Union, and the Ministry of Women Affairs.\n12Circular (Prakas) for Licensing of Microfinance Institutions, 11 January 2000.", "7\nsustainable pattern of growth and development, and (iii) strengthening domestic self-reliance and\nreducing dependence on foreign assistance.\n22. In line with the SEDP, the Government has formulated a strategic plan for 1997\u20132001,\nwhich describes the sector strategy for agriculture and rural development. Under this strategic\nplan, the Government aims at (i) improving food security through expanding the production of\nrice and other food crops, (ii) contributing to economic growth and to increased foreign exchange\nearnings through agricultural exports, (iii) improving income opportunities for farm households by\ndiversifying crop production, and (iv) adding increased value to crop and livestock production by\ndeveloping agro-processing industries. One of the strategies to achieve these objectives is to\nincrease the availability of services for loans and savings for farmers and small entrepreneurs\nthrough a rural financial system led by the private sector.\n23. In December 1998, the Government formulated a rural credit policy and strategy in\nrelation to the Agriculture Sector Program  (footnote 6).  Its policy  statement for rural credit\nspecifically aims to (i) support the expansion of rural credit and savings services by encouraging\nthe entry of MFIs and commercial banks; (ii) strengthen the capacity of NBC to facilitate their\nsupportive  roles  in  promoting  rural  credit  and  savings  through  licensing,  regulation,  and\nsupervision of MFIs; (iii) make the Rural Development Bank (RDB) a self-sustainable wholesale\nbanking institution with the appointment of banking professionals in its management and board;\nand (iv) continue to monitor credit activities of NGOs and community-based organizations and\nencourage their efforts to become licensed MFIs. Subsequently, the Government has prepared a\nstrategy paper for rural credit, which was approved by a meeting of the Council of Ministers on\n28 December 1998. The Project has been formulated in line with this policy and strategy of the\nGovernment.\n24. The Government amended the subdecree and the statute for RDB in November 1999, in\nline with its policy and strategy for rural finance, and included qualified personnel with adequate\nbanking experience in RDB\u2019s senior management. The Government has also taken steps to\nstrengthen NRB's licensing, monitoring, and supervising functions for MFIs.\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n25. Since 1992, ADB has provided 12 loans totaling about $374.0 million and 65 TAs totaling\nabout $50.5 million. Three loans since 1995, including a portion of the Special Rehabilitation\nAssistance Loan,13 for a total of $65.1 million or about 21 percent of the total committed lending\nprograms, were specifically for agriculture and rural development. Four TAs since 1995 were\nspecifically for credit and savings. ADB is often faced with practical constraints to effective\nproject  implementation  in  Cambodia  due  to  the  (i)  shortage  of  skilled  people,  (ii)  lack  of\nGovernment staff experienced in the preparation and implementation of foreign-aided projects\nand  programs,  (iii)  inadequate  financial  resources  of  the  Government,  and  (iv)  lack  of\nunderstanding of ADB\u2019s policies and procedures. These practical issues with ongoing projects\nare regularly discussed for resolution during project review missions, and at meetings of project\nmanagers organized by the ADB\u2019s Cambodia Resident Mission. In conjunction with the Project,\nADB  approved  an  advisory  TA  to  build  institutional  capabilities  for  effective  rural  financial\nservices.14 This TA will assist (i) NBC in establishing procedures for licensing and supervising\n                                               \n13Loan 1199-CAM: Special Rehabilitation Assistance Loan, for $67.7 million, approved on 26 November 1992. A\nportion of loan proceeds, about $10 million, was allocated for the rehabilitation of irrigation systems and the\nprovision of agricultural inputs.\n14TA 3270-CAM: Capacity Building for Rural Financial Services, for $1.45 million, approved on 7 September 1999.", "8\nMFIs and in strengthening its capacity for monitoring and supervision of MFIs; (ii) RDB and\nMFIs in strengthening their capability in financial management, banking skills, and reporting;\nand (iii) MFIs in savings promotion and product development. The provision of the TA is based\non ADB\u2019s recognition that sound institutional development is the key to the establishment of\neffective and sustainable financial services in the rural areas in Cambodia, and will enhance\nthe Government\u2019s policy for rural credit and savings.\n26. In the financial sector, ADB provided a TA to enhance professional banking skills through\nthe development of the Center for Banking Studies.15 This TA aimed at increasing the number of\nqualified trainers in banking skills and initiating the establishment of a full-fledged and self-\nsustaining bankers\u2019 institute, thereby formulating a firm basis for sustainable development of the\nfinancial sector in Cambodia. The World Bank has provided a loan of $18 million to support the\ndevelopment of the Social Fund under the Government\u2019s Council of Ministers. The Social Fund\nhas reached 140 districts covering all 24 provinces in the country,16 and financed more than\n1,400 subprojects for water supply, education, health, and village-level infrastructure facilities.\nThese subprojects, with a funding limit of $50,000 for an individual project, are selected based on\nspecific criteria relating to the degree of poverty among the project beneficiaries. The World Bank\napproved in March 1999 the provision of a follow-up on the Social Fund, in the amount of about\n$24 million.\n27. The  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  in  collaboration  with  the\nInternational Finance Corporation (IFC) of the World Bank Group and the United States Agency\nfor International Development (USAID), is supporting an NGO, the Association of Cambodian\nLocal Economic Development Agencies (ACLEDA), to become a formal financial institution and\nstrengthen its capacity to become a financially viable institution  to provide  rural credit and\nsavings. This assistance to ACLEDA will continue until 2001. ACLEDA plans to become a\ncompany with equity participation from IFC and financial corporations  in Germany and the\nNetherlands.\n28. The French Agency for Development (AFD) has provided a TA amounting to $4 million\nthrough the Government to four NGOs to support their credit operations and assist NBC in\nformulating regulations and guidelines for sound development of microfinance operations. The\nTA will continue until 2001. AFD also signed an agreement with the Government in November\n1998  for  the  provision  of  grant  funds  of  about  $1.0  million  to  finance  rubber  smallholder\ndevelopment. Of this amount, about $0.8 million will be used for the provision of long-term loans\nthrough RDB for rubber plantation by farmers. AFD confirmed that the use of RDB for direct\nlending to farmers is a temporary measure until a separate fund is established under AFD\u2019s\nproject to accommodate this financing facility.\n29. The International Fund for Agricultural Development has provided a loan of $8 million for\nagricultural development in three provinces in northwestern Cambodia. This project will support\nthe agricultural extension services and training, and finance rural credit operations of NGOs in\nthe project area. The total amount of credit is estimated at about $1.4 million provided through\nNGOs for about 18,000 rural households. The Government will establish a revolving fund at RDB\nto channel the fund for NGOs. ADB has been conducting dialogue with these donors for closer\ncoordination during the formulation of the proposed Project. Appendix 4 lists the relevant projects\nand programs of external funding agencies for agriculture and rural development in Cambodia.\n                                               \n15TA 2796-CAM: Enhancing Banking Skills Project, for $400,000, approved on 19 May 1997 and completed on 28\nFebruary 1999.\n16These include four municipalities of Phnom Penh, Krong Prean Sihanouk, Krong Kaeb, and Krong Pailin.", "9\nD. Lessons Learned\n30. In recent years, a number of NGOs have been engaged in rural microfinance programs in\nCambodia. These NGOs have demonstrated their capability to provide and expand effective\nrural financial services if they receive adequate institutional and financial support. Most of these\nNGOs provide both group lending without collateral to meet the demand for smaller credit and\nmicroenterprise loans with collateral requirements. They have achieved substantial outreach\nwithin their operational areas. Their average loan recovery rates are generally high, at more than\n90 percent. The growth of successful microfinance operations in Cambodia can be attributed to\nthe liberal and market-oriented policy environment that ensured the freedom of market entry and\nminimal regulatory requirements. The Government is committed to maintaining this policy and\nencouraging further development of rural microfinance programs.\n31. NGOs in Cambodia, which have been  successful  in  rural  credit operations,  share\ncommon characteristics. These are (i) significant outreach within localized areas, (ii) high rates\nof loan recovery, (iii) an increasingly large loan portfolio that enables overhead costs to be\nadequately covered, (iv) a high annual rate of growth of the loan portfolio, and (v) a significant\ntransformation  toward  becoming  a  domestically  managed  organization.  These  successful\nfeatures have encouraged external funding agencies to increase funds that, in turn, have led to\nincreased efficiency due to a larger scale of activities. On the other hand, the activities of less\nsuccessful  NGOs  are  often  constrained  by  poorly  motivated  part-time  volunteers,  poor\nmanagement information systems, full or partial reliance on Government assistance, and a de-\ncapitalizing loan portfolio because of poor loan recovery and subsidized interest rates. Any\nrural credit schemes that provide subsidized loans may bring in distortions in the financial\nmarkets and create an unsustainable credit mechanism in Cambodia. It will also undermine the\ninitiatives of NGOs and diminish their outreach in rural areas.\n32. Experience in other countries, such as Bangladesh, India, and Philippines, shows that\nan apex financial institution can provide an effective mechanism with reasonable success to\nchannel funds from the Government and external funding agencies to MFIs for onlending to\nsmall-scale borrowers in rural areas. The key factors of such success include the assured\nautonomy and independence of the apex institution that enabled them to secure its decision\nmaking toward self-sustainability and financial viability. Despite the operational objectives for\nrural development, such institutions need to have freedom in pricing products and choosing\ntheir clientele based on the costs and risks of individual transactions. It is also important to\nhave enough MFIs to provide loans to subborrowers and to promote sound competition among\nsuch MFIs. The interest rate pricing must be positive in real terms to compensate savers and\ngenerate enough profits to realize reasonable returns to the capital and reserve for future\ninvestment.\n33. Successful rural financial institutions in Asia have strong saving mobilization facilities\nthat sometimes exceed their lending volume. In Cambodia, most cash in circulation is kept\noutside financial institutions, and there is a strong need for safe and credible saving facilities,\nparticularly in rural areas. Successful savings mobilization requires technical skills to develop\nsaving schemes that correspond well to the needs in the market as well as sound legal and\nregulatory frameworks that authorize these institutions to take deposits. Sound institutional and\nregulatory development is essential for the success of sustainable rural financial services.\nSubstantial  training  programs,  technical  support,  and  extension  services  will  initially  be\nrequired to improve and ensure the long-term sustainability of the MFIs\u2019 financial services.", "10\nThese lessons and experiences have been fully considered in formulating the Project. ADB\u2019s\nTA will provide MFIs with such technical support (para. 25).\n34. With respect to implications for poverty reduction, there may be a trade-off between\noutreach to the poor and financial sustainability of MFIs. Licensed financial institutions, which\naim at self-sustainability and are required to meet financial norms, may try to reduce costs by\nproviding larger loans to existing borrowers rather than smaller loans to new borrowers among\nthe rural poor. However, NGOs in Cambodia provide credit to poor people through group\nlending for their first-cycle borrowing. In this way, successful NGOs are able to expand the\nnumber of poor households they serve in the rural area without giving up financial sustainability\nof their credit operations.\n35. The Project will be ADB\u2019s first rural finance activity in Cambodia. During the formulation\nof the Project, lessons learned from ADB\u2019s rural finance projects in other countries, including\nBangladesh, Indonesia, Nepal, Philippines, and Thailand, have been carefully reviewed and\nincorporated into the project design. The project performance evaluation reports  of  these\nprojects indicate that the interest rate must be high enough to ensure the financial viability of\nlending financial institutions and to guarantee the long-term growth of a sustainable financial\nsystem. Subsidized lending at below market interest rates tends to result in the misallocation of\nscarce resources, encourages misuse of funds, and often reaches the local elite rather than\nlower-income borrowers. ADB\u2019s experience in assisting development finance institutions also\nsuggests  that  the attainment  of  managerial  autonomy  and  independence  of  the  financial\ninstitutions from governments should be ensured, while simultaneously the internal control and\naudit functions of the institutions should be strengthened. The greater degree of flexibility in\noperation and administration helps such an institution to grow into a dynamic and effective\nfinancial intermediary.\n36. One lesson to be learned from Mongolia, which has also experienced the transition\nfrom a monobanking system to a two-tier banking system, is the significance of an overall\nsector design approach for reforms of financial institutions. The evaluation of ADB\u2019s TAs also\nemphasizes the importance of strengthening the supervisory and regulatory authority at an\nearly stage to maximize the impact of subsequent financial sector reforms and to smoothen the\ntransition process. In this regard, the Project supports the establishment and strengthening of\nthe  regulatory  and  supervisory  framework,  which  is  conducive  to  such  a  sector  design\napproach. ADB missions were fully involved in the preparation of relevant regulations during\nthe processing of the Project. The Project also envisages the development of a rural financial\nsystem through upgrading of NGOs with a view to their eventual interaction with the overall\nbanking sector in the long run.\nE. ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n37. In view of the lack of extensive financial services in the rural areas, ADB\u2019s rural finance\nstrategy  in  Cambodia  aims  at  facilitating  the  expansion  of  successful  experiences  of\nmicrofinance programs being carried out by NGOs to improve rural livelihoods. There is also a\ngeneral consensus among major external funding agencies in Cambodia that effective rural\nfinancial services can be best established through nurturing the existing activities of NGOs and\nupgrading them into licensed MFIs. The establishment of a formal rural finance system should\nbe led by the efforts of the private sector, and the state intervention should be mainly confined\nto the establishment of a sound regulatory and supervisory environment. While a wholesale\nbank currently channels funds to MFIs in order to support their operations, this should not\neliminate the potential for commercial banks to finance MFIs\u2019 operations. Rather, the wholesale", "11\nbanking  institution  should  play  a  catalytic  role  and  induce  other  commercial  banks  to\nparticipate in financing MFIs\u2019 operations through the demonstration of viability and successful\ninteractions with MFIs.\n38. ADB\u2019s  current  country  operational  strategy  (COS)  for  Cambodia  was  prepared  in\nNovember 1995. The major thrusts of the COS include the promotion of economic growth as\nthe principal means for creating employment opportunities and reducing poverty, and the\nstrengthening of capacity for good governance and improved project management through an\neffective combination of TA and lending modalities. The COS recognizes that agriculture and\nrural development is the key to sustainable economic growth of Cambodia. In this context, it is\nessential to achieve the substantial improvement of agricultural productivity through (i) a shift\nfrom solely subsistence-oriented farming to the introduction of market-oriented, commercial\nproduction; (ii) the promotion of private sector participation in input supply, product processing,\nand marketing; (iii) improvement in agricultural research and extension services based on a\nclient-oriented strategy; (iv) the provision and proper maintenance of critical infrastructure for\nrural  transport,  irrigation,  and  drainage;  and  (v)  the  provision  of  adequate  rural  financial\nservices.  The  ADB's Agriculture  Sector  Program  (footnote  6)  has  been  supporting  these\naspects in Cambodia.\n39. The new COS will be formulated in 2000. Its overall strategic objective will be poverty\nreduction through economic growth. The new COS will be based on the reassessment of\nmeans by which the ADB\u2019s operational strategy is to be implemented, taking into account the\npriorities of the new Government, the present absorptive capacity of the country, and ADB\u2019s\noperational experience in Cambodia. ADB is also formulating a microfinance development\nstrategy to achieve its objective of poverty reduction through effective and consistent support\nfor the expansion of microfinance activities. The Project has been prepared in line with this\napproach through the expansion of MFIs\u2019 outreach to the poor.\n40. Major external funding agencies involved in rural credit in Cambodia share the same\nconcern about the financial sustainability of MFIs. Further cooperation with other external\nfunding agencies is vital to maintaining a favorable environment for NGOs to be transformed\ninto licensed MFIs and strengthened. ADB will continue its collaboration with other external\nfunding agencies in relation to the Project.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n41. ADB's dialogue with the Government, which has evolved since the commencement of\nADB-financed  TAs  and  has  continued  during  the  preparation  of  the  Project  and  the\nimplementation of the Agriculture Sector Program (footnote 6), has resulted in the formulation\nof the Government\u2019s new rural credit policy and strategy, which were approved in December\n1998. The new policy aims at supporting the expansion of rural credit and the introduction of\nsavings schemes in rural areas by encouraging the licensed microfinance establishments to\nenter  rural  finance.  Since  then,  there  have  been  rapid  and  notable  developments  in\nestablishing  a  working  relationship  among  the  Government,  NBC,  and  NGOs,  which  is\nfavorable for the promotion of viable MFIs. The Project has been formulated in line with the\nnew Government policy. The dialogue on the Government\u2019s policy of rural finance will continue\nduring project implementation.\n42. ADB  recognizes  the  importance  of  establishing  sound  legal  and  institutional\nframeworks for the sustainable development of rural financial services in the long run. The new\nlaw on banking and financial institutions and NBC\u2019s regulation for the licensing and supervision", "12\nof MFIs provide the basic regulatory framework for rural finance in Cambodia (para. 14). NBC\nhad  active  consultations  with  the  relevant  parties,  including  NGOs,  before  finalizing  the\nregulation. ADB missions were fully involved in this process. These undertakings have also\nbeen  supported  by  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  which  is  helping  the  Government\nstrengthen the overall financial sector. NBC will ensure that a set of prudential rules relevant\nfor MFIs will be implemented in accordance with NBC\u2019s regulations, for a transparent and\nenabling operational environment for MFIs.\n43. With respect to the institutional set-up relating to the Project, ADB has been engaged in\na dialogue with the Government and NBC. RDB\u2019s  senior  management and the  board  of\ndirectors  have been  changed  to  introduce  adequate  knowledge  and  skills  in  commercial\nbanking into RDB\u2019s management. ADB considers that these changes will form a critical basis\nfor effective project implementation. In addition, strengthening of the institutional capabilities of\nNBC, RDB, and the prospective MFIs is urgently required for promoting financial services in\nthe  rural  area.  Strengthening  of  NBC\u2019s  capability  to  supervise  MFIs  will  be  particularly\nimportant  after  the  regulatory  framework  for  the  licensing  and  supervision  of  MFIs  is\nintroduced. ADB is providing an advisory TA to help establish the framework (para. 25).\nIV.          THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n44. The Project will help fill the need for increased access by Cambodia\u2019s rural poor to\nreliable and effective financial services. About 90 percent of the country\u2019s poor live in rural\nareas,  which have  no  reliable  and  effective financial  services. There are no branches  of\ncommercial banks in 15 of Cambodia\u2019s 24 provinces. People often need to travel to Phnom Penh\nfor financial transactions. To make up for this deficiency, NGOs have been providing rural\nhouseholds with credit  and  savings  services  and  have  reached  about  11  percent  of  rural\nhouseholds. Most rural households, however, have no access to effective financial services and\nrely solely on relatives, informal moneylenders, and middlemen in agricultural trade, who charge\nhigh interest rates. Poor households in the rural areas are particularly handicapped in this\nregard. The lack of access to reliable financial services is a major constraint to the reduction of\nrural poverty in Cambodia. The need to resort to moneylenders also makes it difficult for the\npoor to escape from the poverty cycle. The Project will build upon the efforts of NGOs to provide\nrural poor households with increased access to effective financial services.\n45. Despite the large unmet demand for rural credit (paras. 9-11), the expansion of NGOs\u2019\nrural credit is now being constrained by the limited availability of sources of financing. Since\nnonlicensed financial institutions cannot take in savings from the general public, the deficiency in\nmonetary resources severely constrains the credit operations of NGOs, which need to mobilize\nsavings  to  finance  the  expansion  of  their  loan  portfolios  in  rural  areas  and  provide  rural\nhouseholds with better and more profitable access to liquidity.\n46. The project financial intermediaries will operate close to the communities they serve. A\nnumber of better performing NGOs have expressed strong interest in (i) expanding their services\nto cover both credit and savings services, and (ii) becoming licensed as MFIs. Through an\nimproved regulatory and supervisory environment, and enhanced governance and operational\nefficiency, these MFIs will be able to attract and service broad-based savings and to increase\ntheir borrowings from commercial banks to allow for further expansion.", "13\n B. Objectives and Scope\n \n47. The primary objective of the Project is to develop effective financial services in the rural\nareas, which will provide poor households with better access to rural finance. The Project will\nsupport the activities of NGOs that have demonstrated viable systems of credit delivery and\nachieved  substantial  outreach.  As  seen  in  the  pattern  of  NGOs\u2019  lending  activities,  most\nsubborrowers  are  from  poor  households  in  the  rural  area.  More  than  50  percent  of  the\nsubborrowers are expected to be women representing  their households. ADB\u2019s operational\nstrategy for rural development emphasizes the need for steady reduction in poverty as a major\nobjective. The Project will help achieve this objective by providing the rural poor with increased\naccess  to  rural financial services.  The Project  will  support  ADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  and\ncontribute to the development of sound regulatory and institutional frameworks for the expansion\nof microfinance services in the rural areas.\n \n 48. The  Project  scope  will  include  (i)  microfinance  for  agricultural  and  microenterprise\nsubprojects, (ii) operational support for licensed financial institutions (LFIs), including MFIs,17 and\n(iii) project management support for RDB. The Project will cover the rural credit and savings\noperations of the prospective MFIs over the whole country but will initially be implemented mainly\nin the northwestern, eastern, and southern regions, where the prospective MFIs are currently\nactive.\n49. Under the Loan, the Government will provide to RDB lines of credit totaling about $19.0\nmillion equivalent. The credit lines will primarily be financed with proceeds of the ADB loan and\nused for onlending to agricultural and nonfarm income-generating activities of rural subborrowers\nand for investment. The loan proceeds will be passed on to RDB under a subsidiary loan\nagreement between the Government and RDB, which will onlend these funds as a wholesaler to\nLFIs. These credit lines will be provided both in riels and in US dollars. Based on the interest\nexpressed by MFIs, it is expected that subsidiary loans from the Government to RDB will be\nequally divided into riel and US dollars. Disbursement of credit funds will take into account the\nrecovery of loans from subborrowers in previous years and LFIs\u2019 loan programs as defined in\ntheir business plans. The indicative types of major activities to be financed by these lines of\ncredit include agricultural production, retail trading, pig raising, rice milling, silk weaving, brick\nmaking, and small-scale irrigation. The average loan size is expected to be about $100. LFIs,\nincluding at least five MFIs, will be serving about 260,000 rural households with about two loans\nper household on average by the end of the project implementation period.\n50. LFIs will fund about 15 percent of the total credit for subborrowers out of their own\nresources and savings they mobilize. RDB will assess savings schemes of LFIs and assist\nthem in improving their services. RDB will only allow LFIs to have access to loan funds under\nthe Project if they are able to implement a sound savings program. Such savings programs will\nbe community based and need not be dependent on or generated from subborrower groups\nonly. Although some NGOs in Cambodia operate compulsory savings schemes among their\ngroup members, the experience of most NGOs indicates that the administrative costs for small-\nvolume compulsory savings schemes are too high to be sustainable.\n51. A  revolving  fund  for  the  Project  will  be  established  within  six  months  of  loan\neffectiveness, and maintained by RDB to credit funds generated from repayments made by\n                                               \n17An NGO will be licensed as a specialized bank engaged in rural finance, which is allowed to have a wider range\nof financial activities than an MFI.", "14\nLFIs. These funds will be used for onlending to LFIs in accordance with the Government\u2019s\nsubsidiary loan agreement with RDB. Subborrowers will receive loans as members of groups\nfor their first borrowing. First loans from LFIs to subborrowers under the Project will be about\nKR200,000 ($53) for terms of up to one year. Subsequent loans will be for larger amounts up\nto about KR2.0 million ($526) for group borrowers for longer terms as needed. The terms and\nconditions for loans for individual subborrowers will be determined based on the assessment of\nindividual applications. Based on current patterns, about 80 percent of the lending will be for\nactivities relating to rural livelihoods, including agricultural production, petty trading, pig raising,\nand small-scale irrigation, with the remainder for food processing and light manufacturing\nundertakings. The average recovery rate for loans to subborrowers is expected to be more\nthan 90 percent. LFIs will be required to adopt prudent policies for holding a reasonable\namount of cash under NBC\u2019s regulations and supervision.\n52. The credit lines under the Project will also finance LFIs\u2019 investment requirements,\namounting to about $1.1 million, for the procurement of service vehicles, equipment, and civil\nworks to establish and rehabilitate their branch offices. The equipment to be procured by LFIs\nwill include computers and other office equipment to facilitate the computerization of financial\nmanagement between their head offices and branches, and safes to hold cash needed to\nassure depositors of access to their savings. This will strengthen the capability of LFIs in\nliquidity management and promote the development of their savings schemes based on a\nbroader range of depositors than their group-based borrowers alone. LFIs will be able to\ndevelop savings schemes after they are licensed by NBC. The LFIs are required to expand\ntheir savings schemes under the Project. Such schemes will initially include facilities for small-\nscale savings deposits and for deposits to meet medium- and long-term investment needs.\n \n53. The Project will also support RDB for its project implementation through the provision of\nservice vehicles, office equipment, and consulting services. Adequate funds will also be provided\nto meet incremental operating costs, including expenses for benefit monitoring and evaluation\nactivities of the Project. Such support will be provided for RDB\u2019s project management unit (PMU)\nthrough the Government\u2019s annual budget procedures.\n C. Cost Estimates\n \n 54. The total cost of the Project is estimated at $26.56 million, including physical and price\ncontingencies, and the interest on the ADB loan during project implementation. Contingencies\nare provided for the component of project management support only. In view of a large share of\nimported  products  to  be  purchased  for  retail  trading  and  for  agricultural  inputs  by  the\nsubborrowers, the proportion of the direct and indirect foreign exchange costs of the credit line\nfor microcredit is estimated to be about 50 percent of the total amount required for credit funds.\nThe total foreign exchange cost of the Project is estimated at $13.76 million or 52 percent of the\ntotal project cost, and the local currency cost at $12.80 million equivalent or 48 percent of the\ntotal  cost.  Project  cost  estimates  are  summarized  in  Table  1,  and  details  are  shown  in\nAppendix  5.", "15\n \nT  able 1:  Summary of Project Costs\n ($ million)\n \n  Foreign Local Total      % of Total\n Component Exchange Currency a Cost      Base\n       Costs\n \n A.

Financing Plan\n \n 55. It is proposed that ADB will provide a loan of $20.0 million from the Asian Development\nFund. The loan will be from ADB's Special Funds resources with a maturity of 32 years, including\na grace period of 8 years, and with an interest charge of 1.0 percent per annum during the grace\nperiod and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter. ADB will finance the entire foreign exchange costs\nof the Project and 49 percent of the local currency costs. This is necessary in view of the\nGovernment\u2019s fiscal constraints and its difficulties in mobilizing domestic revenue effectively,\nwhich averages about 8 percent of GDP. The Borrower will be the Kingdom of Cambodia. The\nbalance of about $6.6 million will be financed by (i) the Government, mainly in the form of equity\nfor RDB and expenditures to support RDB\u2019s project management; and (ii) LFIs. There will be little\nor no cash contributions from subborrowers, who will use their family labor in their subproject\nactivities. The amount of family labor will vary depending upon the type of subprojects to be\nfinanced under  the  Project,  which  will  be  determined  during  project  implementation.18  The\nfinancing plan is summarized in Table 2 and details are presented in Appendix 5.\n                                               \n18For instance, based on the experience of NGOs\u2019 credit operations, the average contribution of family labor in an\nagricultural subproject, expressed in the market wage rate, is estimated at more than 40 percent of the total cost\nwhile that for pig raising at less than 5 percent.", "16\n \n Table 2:  Financing Plan\n ($ million)\n \n  Foreign Local Total\n  Source Exchange Currency Cost Percent\n \n ADB 13.76   6.24 20.00     75\n Governmenta   0.00   2.72   2.72     10\n LFIs   0.00   3.84   3.84     15\n \n               Total 13.76 12.80  26.56   100\n \n  a  Includes contributions to the credit lines and project management.\n \n E. Implementation Arrangements\n \n  1. Project Organization\n \n56. RDB will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the management of the Project and the\nmicrocredit component of the Project, assuming overall responsibility for the implementation of\nmicrofinance  operations,  and  NBC  will  be  the  EA  for  LFI  supervision.  RDB  has  been\ndesignated as the EA for microfinance operations in view of the Government\u2019s policy for rural\ncredit and savings, and recent improvements in its managerial capability. RDB established a\nPMU and appointed a project manager in July 1999. The PMU has five officers, including the\nproject manager, and supporting staff.\n57. The Government will also establish a project coordination committee (PCC) with a\nchairperson at least at the level of undersecretary from the Ministry of Economy and Finance.\nThe PCC will be established as soon as practicable but, in all events, within three months of\nloan effectiveness. The PCC will meet at least twice yearly and function as a central-level\ncoordination  body  to  support  project  activities  by  providing  overall  policy  guidance  and\ndirections  for  project  implementation,  and  by  helping  to  resolve  any  outstanding  issues.\nMembers  of  the  PCC  will  include  representatives  of  NBC;  RDB;  the  Ministry  of  Rural\nDevelopment; the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries; and LFIs participating in the\nProject. The PMU\u2019s project manager will act as the PCC\u2019s secretary.\n \n58. RDB will act as a wholesale banking institution to provide funds to LFIs. Some financial\ntransactions have taken place between RDB and NGOs since the end of 1998. RDB has\nprovided loans, amounting to a cumulative total of $1.1 million, to NGOs and commercial\nbanks for their microcredit operations. Based on the present performance and their interest in\nhaving access to project funds, a number of NGOs have been initially identified as potential\nLFIs participating in the Project. In the first and second years of the Project, five prospective\nLFIs  are  expected  to  borrow  funds  from  RDB,  including  ACLEDA,  Ennatien  Moulethan\nTchonnebat, Cambodia Community Building, Hattha Kaksekar, and a group of NGOs assisted by\nthe Catholic Relief Services (an international NGO). These prospective LFIs are domestic NGOs\nregistered with the Ministry of Interior. The Government will provide the proceeds of the ADB\nloan to RDB for the credit line under a subsidiary loan agreement and for expenses relating to\nproject management support for the PMU through normal budgetary procedures.", "17\n59. RDB, as an EA, will comply with the following requirements unless the Government and\nADB otherwise agree:\n(i) satisfactory completion of an audit and full compliance with recommendations in\nthe audit;\n(ii) full compliance with bank regulations and the reporting requirements set by\nNBC on its financial performance; and\n(iii) lending activities only to LFIs.\nRDB\u2019s performance as the EA will be fully reviewed during a comprehensive midterm review\n(para. 74).\n60. NBC will assume overall responsibility for the supervision of MFIs through its MFI\nSupervision Division (MSD).19 A manager will be appointed to head MSD. NBC will act as an\nEA responsible for MFI supervision under the Project in view of the crucial importance of\nestablishing the right regulatory and supervisory framework for MFIs. NBC\u2019s Bank Supervision\nDepartment  has  recently  integrated  into  MSD  its  Supervision  Office  of  the  Decentralized\nBanking System, which handled projects of the four NGOs financed by the French Agency for\nDevelopment (AFD). NBC will compile monthly reports on the financial status and microfinance\noperations  of  MFIs.  NBC\u2019s  Bank  Supervision  Department  will  also  be  responsible  for\nmonitoring and supervising RDB according to NBC\u2019s bank regulations. An organization chart\nfor the Project is in Appendix 6.\n61. In view of the importance of capacity building for sound institutional development, ADB\napproved  an  advisory  TA  project  (para.  25)  to  strengthen  the  technical  and  managerial\ncapabilities of key institutions involved in rural financial services. NBC is an EA for this TA,\nwhich will be implemented for three years starting in early 2000.\n2. Licensed Financial Institutions\n62. The Project  will  include financial  institutions  that are able  to develop  and  provide\nsustainable microfinance services in rural areas. These institutions are mainly NGOs that will\nbe licensed by NBC as financial institutions. They will develop plans that are for the duration of\nthe Project and that set out the locations of service outlets, numbers of potential borrowers,\nloan volumes, and required financing for each year within the long-term plan. All information\nwill be supported by complete and audited financial statements. RDB will review these plans\ntwice yearly and, in consultation with the concerned institutions, enter into a loan agreement\nwith each institution on a separate and individual basis. LFIs will provide rural credit and\nsavings services on a full cost recovery basis.\n63. The criteria for an LFI\u2019s participation in the Project and continued eligibility will be as\nfollows:\n(i)  The  LFI  must  acquire  an  operating  license  from  NBC,  and  maintain  full\ncompliance  with  the  NBC\u2019s  relevant  regulations,  circulars,  and  reporting\nrequirements.  NBC\u2019s  regulation  for  licensing  MFIs  includes,  among  others,\n                                               \n19NBC\u2019s Bank Supervision Department was reorganized in January 2000 with the creation of a division for the\nsupervision and licensing of specialized banks and MFIs.", "18\n(a) a minimum registered capital of KR250 million ($65,000), (b) a minimum\ncapital adequacy ratio of 20 percent between eligible capital and weighted risks,\n(c) a minimum liquidity ratio of 100 percent, and (d) loan commitments to an\nindividual subborrower below 10 percent of the net worth of the LFI.\n(ii) The LFI must have had at least two years of experience in credit operations,\nwith the average loan recovery rate of more than 90 percent, and adequate staff\nstrength and skills for the appraisal of loan applications from subborrowers.\n(iii) The  LFI  must  achieve  the  savings  mobilization  targets  established  by  the\nProject. As a percentage of loan portfolio, these will be 5.0 percent by the end of\nthe third year of participation.\n64. To participate in the Project, NGOs will need to become legal entities. Under the\ncurrent legislation, this is likely to mean that an NGO will become a corporate entity such as a\nlimited liability company. To register as an LFI,  a  company  must  (i)  issue  a  prospectus,\n(ii) identify initial shareholders, (iii) appoint a board of directors and officers, (iv) establish\nmemoranda or articles of association, (v) hold an initial general meeting, and (vi) issue shares.\nThe  company  may  then  apply  to  NBC  for  a  license  as  a  financial  institution,  following\nprescribed procedures. NBC\u2019s licensing procedures for an NGO will take at least five months.\nThe prospective LFIs, which are expected to participate in the Project, started preparatory\nactivities in 1998. Participation of an LFI in the Project will be subject to ADB approval.\n65. All LFIs will be responsible to RDB for the repayment of funds borrowed from RDB in\naccordance with appropriate agreements to be entered into with RDB. The agreements will\nprovide that if an LFI fails to comply with the criteria in para. 63 for at least six months, RDB\nmay require the LFI to accelerate its repayment of outstanding loans to RDB. The criteria have\nbeen explained to RDB and the prospective LFIs at the workshops organized during project\npreparation.\n3. Relending and Onlending Arrangements\n66. The Government will make the proceeds of the ADB loan available to RDB in riel and\nUS dollars for credit lines under a subsidiary loan agreement. The subsidiary loan agreement\nbetween the Government and RDB will cover a period of 20 years and include a repayment\nschedule similar to that between the Government and ADB. The cost of funds to RDB will be at\na rate not less than the ADB's ordinary capital resources (OCR) rate, which is currently at 6.46\npercent per annum. The OCR rate is considered because (i) RDB is a financial institution and\nshould pay a rate not less than a long-term rate reflected in the OCR rate, (ii) the interest rates\nquoted in riel do not adequately reflect the long-term cost of funds in view of the current\nposition of riel, and (iii) it will accommodate a fee for the Government to assume any foreign\nexchange risk.\n67. RDB will onlend funds to LFIs at a rate that covers the administrative and financial risk\ncharges appropriate to and calculated for LFIs. The interest spread to be retained by RDB,\nincluding these charges, will be initially up to 4 percent per annum. Any change in the spread\nto be retained by RDB will be subject to approval of the Government and ADB. The loan term\nwill initially be 18 months and may be extended up to five years, including a grace period of up\nto one  year,  subject to  satisfactory  performance  of  the  LFI.  RDB  will  maintain a  project\nrevolving fund that fully accommodates and accounts for all project-related disbursements to\nand principal repayments from LFIs. The revolving fund will be kept as a long-term source of", "19\nfunds available to LFIs to satisfy their needs for expansion and provide back-up liquidity\nsupport.\n68. Interest  rates  on  lending  by  LFIs  to  their  subborrowers  will  be  calculated  and\ndetermined  by  each  LFI  at  a  rate  sufficient  to  recover  all  operating  expenses  including\nadministrative costs, loan losses, and costs of funds. This rate will be affected by the efficiency\nof the LFI and the average size of loans. Based on the cost of funds from RDB at about 11\npercent per annum,  the expected  administrative  costs  of  15-30  percent and  a  loan  loss\nprovision of 3-6 percent, the onlending interest rates of loans to subborrowers are expected to\nbe within a common range of 30-40 percent per annum or flat rates of 2.5\u20133.3 percent per\nmonth. These rates are significantly lower than the currently prevailing interest rates charged\nby moneylenders. The repayment term of loans under the Project is usually 6 months, with a\nmaximum term of 18 months. The maximum size of a loan to a subborrower will be $6,500\nequivalent in line with the NBC's regulation for licensing MFIs, although the average loan size\nunder this Project will be $100. The interest rates charged to subborrowers are expected to\ndecline  as  RDB  and  LFIs  improve  their  operational  efficiency  and  through  increased\ncompetition among LFIs. These rates will be regularly reviewed by the Government, ADB,\nNBC, and RDB. Lending to groups will not have collateral requirements while larger individual\nloans will require collateral in accordance with the policy of each LFI. These relending and\nonlending arrangements have been discussed with NBC, RDB, and the prospective LFIs at the\nworkshops organized during project preparation, and have been generally accepted by the\nconcerned parties.\n69. Relending from the Government to RDB for the credit line in US dollars will also be\ncovered in the subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and RDB for a period of 20\nyears. The annual interest rate charged to RDB will be not less than ADB's OCR rate, which is\nconsidered to reflect the long-term cost of funds in view of the current financial market in\nCambodia. Taking into account the administrative cost and risk factor for lending to LFIs, an\nappropriate interest spread to be retained by RDB will initially be up to 4 percent per annum. The\nrepayment terms of loans for LFIs will be similar to those for the loans in riel.\n4. Participation of Subborrowers\n70. Subborrowers will continue to be selected in accordance with the policies and selection\ncriteria of individual LFIs with respect to the subborrowers\u2019 business plans, socioeconomic\nawareness, entrepreneurial capability, and household income. Poorer households are usually\ngiven priority in the selection since poverty reduction is the most important agenda item of the\nprospective LFIs. New subborrowers will be developed by LFIs through group lending for their\nfirst-cycle borrowing. NGOs, which are currently operating microfinance schemes in Cambodia,\nhave developed their own credit policies and procedures with technical support from external\nfunding agencies. Some of them have comprehensive credit manuals. Selection procedures\nusually include individual interviews, group meetings, community meetings, and home visits.\nCredit officers and agents of these NGOs examine the income and expenditure patterns and\nbusiness plans of the prospective subborrowers to assess their loan applications. NGOs in\nCambodia recognize the importance of proper screening and selection of subborrowers and\nsubprojects.  They  know  that  rigorous  lending  criteria  will  ensure  viable  and  sustainable\nfinancial  intermediation,  and  the  development  of  cost-effective  savings  schemes.  Loan\nproceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  subprojects  for  the  subborrowers\u2019  income-generating\nactivities, which contribute to agriculture and rural development.", "20\n5. Project Performance Monitoring\n71. RDB will be responsible for monitoring and evaluating project performance. During the\npreparation of the Project, extensive social surveys were conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Incorporation of Social Dimensions in Bank Operations. This information will\nprovide  the  benchmark  information  for  the  Project.  Such  information  includes  the\ncharacteristics of the prospective subborrowers, clientele needs and demands, capacity for on-\nfarm  and off-farm  business activities,  roles  of  men  and  women,  and  access  to  financial\nservices. An appropriate monitoring and evaluation system will be established at the PMU to\ntrack the progress of project implementation. With assistance from consultants recruited under\nthe Project, RDB will regularly collect and compile from LFIs information on (i) the number of\nsubborrowers,  (ii)  the  amount  of  loans  to  subborrowers  outstanding  with  LFIs,  (iii)\ndisbursement  and  recovery  of  loans  to  subborrowers,  (iv)  savings  mobilized,  and  (v)\nperformance of subprojects financed by loans from LFIs. This information will be used to\nmonitor the progress of project implementation and to determine whether the Project\u2019s original\npurposes are being achieved.\n72. In addition to the progress of project implementation, RDB will assess the Project\u2019s\nimpact based on data and information received from participating LFIs. Detailed benchmark\ninformation on the subborrowers with respect to their income levels, types of jobs, and poverty\nincidence will be collected and  compiled from LFIs.  The  reporting formats for  monitoring\nperformance of the Project will be developed at project inception and in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nrecent  publication  on  the  project  performance  management  system.  Enumerators  will  be\nrecruited by the PMU as required under the Project.\n6. Project Implementation Schedule\n73. The Project will be implemented over five years. Project completion is expected in June\n2005. Initial activities will include the appointment of the project management staff of the PMU\nand the MFI supervision staff of MSD; procurement of service vehicles, equipment, and small\ncivil works for PMU and LFIs; staff training; and the establishment of management information\nsystems for PMU, MSD, and LFIs. The project implementation schedule is summarized in\nAppendix 7.\n7. Comprehensive Midterm Review\n74. The Government and ADB will jointly carry out a comprehensive review upon the earlier\nof (i) two years after loan effectiveness, or (ii) an initial amount equivalent to at least $5 million\nis disbursed. The review will cover all parameters used for assessing project performance and\nimpact, and will critically examine (i) the progress of loan disbursement; (ii) the performance of\nthe EAs; (iii) the participation and performance of LFIs and subborrowers; (iv) adequacy of the\nproject  implementation  arrangements;  (v)  the  project  implementation  schedule,  and\nprocedures; (vi) the viability of subprojects; and (vii) the project impact. Based on the outcome\nof the review, ADB will decide on the future course of project activities.\n8. Procurement\n75. The Project requires the procurement of service vehicles, equipment, and small civil\nworks for RDB. Supply contracts and civil works envisaged under the Project will be limited in\nsize and not more than $100,000. These contracts will be awarded on the basis of direct", "21\npurchase or local competitive bidding procedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for\nProcurement. RDB should ensure that the goods and services procured are reasonably priced\nand suitable for project activities, and that fair canvassing is done in selecting suppliers. The\nprocurement for LFIs, including service vehicles, office equipment, and safes to be delivered to\ntheir district branches, will be done under loans provided from RDB to LFIs, and will be\nreasonable and cost effective under the circumstances. Procurement of goods and services by\nthe subborrowers under funds onlent from LFIs under the Project will be done through normal\ncommercial practices appropriate to the local trade, in view of the large number of small\nprocurement items. Fair competition and pricing among suppliers are expected in local markets\nwhere subborrowers usually purchase inputs and materials for their subprojects.\n9. Consulting Services\n76. Consulting services will be provided to support the PMU in project implementation. The\nconsultants will include an individual international consultant in accounting information systems\nfor six person-months, and a domestic consultant in monitoring and evaluation for nine person-\nmonths. The consultants will develop an appropriate monitoring and information system in the\nPMU. The consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic\nconsultants. The outline terms of reference are included in Appendix 8.\n10. Disbursements\n77. The  Government  will  establish  an  imprest  fund  account  immediately  after  loan\neffectiveness for the disbursement of loan proceeds for credit and for payments to suppliers\nand contractors under the Project. The imprest account will be operated in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. Advances to the imprest account will be made based on\nRDB\u2019s  projected  expenditures.  The  imprest  account  will  be  liquidated  and  replenished\naccording to ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedures. The Government contribution for\nproject management support will be provided through its annual budget procedures.\n11. Reports, Accounts, and Audit\n78. At present, NGOs and commercial banks follow the reporting systems of their major\nexternal funding agencies or foreign shareholders. RDB operates a dual accounting system to\nsatisfy the Government as the owner and NBC as the supervisor. There is no universal use or\nacceptance of a standardized chart of accounts among NGOs or banks. NBC intends to obtain\nfair  and  true  presentation  of  financial  statements  of  the  financial  institutions  under  its\nsupervision by requiring that auditors of banks (i) are acceptable to NBC, and (ii) conform to\nthe regulations on loan classification and loss provisions.\n79. Under these circumstances, NBC faces difficulties in making accurate comparisons on\nthe performance of banks and NGOs due to the differences in  reporting  and  accounting\nformats and practices. In this regard, NBC plans to develop and require financial institutions to\nuse a standard chart of accounts within a few years. Since LFIs will have relatively simple\naccounting and management information systems, it is feasible and desirable to introduce and\nimplement a standardized chart of accounts among LFIs. This should be done within three\nyears of project inception in consultation with the Ministry of Economy and Finance, and NBC.\nSome  NGOs  have  already  introduced  the  generally  accepted  accounting  standards  and\nprocedures with the assistance of bilateral funding agencies, and are considering improving\ntheir use of these procedures to meet international standards.", "22\n80. The PMU will establish and maintain a separate account for expenditures under the\nProject in accordance with the generally accepted accounting procedures in Cambodia. All\nfinancial transactions for the Project will be recorded separately in the project account in a\nmanner that allows identification of expenditures on the project facilities provided under the\nloan. The project account and the revolving fund account, which will be established to credit\nrepayments from MFIs, should be audited annually by external auditors satisfactory to ADB.\nLocal subsidiaries of internationally reputable accounting firms are available in Cambodia.\nRDB\u2019s financial statements are being audited annually by one of such firms. RDB and NBC,\nthrough the PMU and MSD, will submit to ADB certified copies of the audited accounts and\nfinancial statements in the English language within nine months after the end of each fiscal\nyear. Audited accounts and financial statements of LFIs participating in the Project will be\nsubmitted to ADB upon request.\n81. The PMU and MSD will furnish to ADB and the Government quarterly progress reports\non project implementation in a form and a level of detail that is satisfactory to ADB before the\nend  of  the  month  following  the  quarter  under  review.  These  reports  should  include  (i)\ninformation on the progress of project implementation, (ii) implementation issues encountered\nand measures adopted for resolution, and (iii) assessment of project goals and purposes\nachieved. The PMU\u2019s quarterly progress reports should also indicate detailed records and\nquarterly  projections  on  operations  and  performance  of  LFIs  under  the  Project.  MSD\u2019s\nquarterly progress reports should include information on the overall financial status of LFIs and\nother matters relating to the financial sector in Cambodia. The PMU and MSD will also prepare\nand furnish to ADB and the Government project completion reports in accordance with the\nterms of reference to be agreed between the Government and ADB within three months of the\nloan closing date or such later date as ADB may agree.\nF. The Executing Agencies\n1. The Rural Development Bank\n82. RDB was created by a Government subdecree in January 1998 with an initial capital of\nKR10  billion  ($2.6  million)  provided  from  Government  resources.  Its  paid-up  capital  was\nincreased to KR18.9 billion ($5.0 million) in March 2000. RDB was issued a commercial bank\nlicense by NBC in June 1998. Under the new law on banking and financial institutions, RDB\nwill be licensed as a specialized bank engaged in rural finance. RDB\u2019s statute was revised in\nNovember 1999, and includes as its duties (i) provision of financing or refinancing facilities for\nMFI and commercial banks involved in rural finance, (ii) collaboration with other commercial\nbanks for agriculture and rural development, (iii) negotiation with external funding agencies for\nadequate resources to support credit operations for agriculture and rural development, and (iv)\nprovision of technical support and training for microfinance institutions.\n83. The amended subdecree and statute of RDB accommodate the participation of private\ncommercial banks in the management of RDB in line with the Government policy for rural\nfinance issued in December 1998. RDB\u2019s board of directors now includes representatives of\nthe  Government,  commercial  banks,  and  LFIs.  At  present,  RDB  has  a  total  of  25  staff\nmembers, including 6 with banking experience. Four officers in RDB\u2019s Credit Department are\nprocessing and appraising loan applications.\n84. Since late 1998, improvements in RDB\u2019s management and operations have included (i)\nthe cessation of all retail lending activities; (ii) the amendment of the subdecree and the statute", "23\nfor RDB being solely engaged in wholesale lending; (iii) the decision to include representatives\nof private commercial banks and NGOs on its board of directors; and (iv) the recruitment of\nstaff with experience in banking, NGO operations, agriculture, and industry. RDB also has a\nprofessional accountant and a lawyer. These improvements in RDB\u2019s institutional capability are\nexpected to be enhanced under an ADB-financed TA (para. 25). RDB has also demonstrated a\nsignificant degree of autonomy by (i) using a different system for staff salaries from that of civil\nservants, and (ii) rejecting a request from a Government ministry for a loan to expand its public\nlending program. This autonomy has been confirmed in the amended subdecree and statute.\nThe financial viability of RDB is essential for its sustainable operations.\n85. RDB will borrow funds under the Project based on a subsidiary loan agreement with the\nGovernment, and will onlend funds to LFIs at an interest rate that allows for cost recovery\nrelating to credit. The amount of loans to be disbursed to LFIs will be decided by RDB but\nsubject to NBC regulations. The financial risk of onlending to LFIs will be borne by RDB, which\nwill be required to maintain a sound financial structure and performance under the NBC's\nsupervision. RDB is described in detail in Appendix 9.\n2. The National Bank of Cambodia\n86. In January 1996, NBC became an autonomous central bank with a board of directors\nresponsible for establishing operational policies and issuing decisions, regulations, circulars,\nand  other  directives.  NBC  supervises  the  banking  system  and  is  the  banker  for  the\nGovernment. NBC has four organizational areas: (i) the General Cashier, (ii) the General\nDirection, (iii) the General Secretariat, and (iv) the  General  Inspection.  As of the  end  of\nDecember 1998, NBC\u2019s management and staff totaled 1,075 people with 425 in the provincial\nbranches and 87 in the Foreign Trade Bank, which is still managed by NBC.\n87. Bank  supervision  is  one  of  NBC\u2019s  most  important  activities.  Its  Bank  Supervision\nDepartment was reorganized in December 1999, and now has four divisions, for (i) off-site\ninspection of commercial banks; (ii) on-site inspection of commercial banks; (iii) administration,\nregulation, research, and licensing of commercial banks; and (iv) supervision and licensing of\nspecialized banks and MFIs. The Supervision Department has 38 staff including 10 staff who\nwere recently assigned to three sections of the on-site inspection division for commercial\nbanks and received brief training on on-site inspection activities. The six sections of the off-site\ninspection division supervise commercial banks. Each section comprising  three staff each is\nresponsible for five commercial banks. Supervision is done by analyzing the weekly, monthly,\nquarterly, and annual reports of banks.\n88. Until the recent reorganization, the Bank Supervision Department had a separate office,\ncalled the Supervision Office for the Decentralized Banking System, which was established by\nan agreement between AFD and  the Government  in  November 1997.  This  office,  which\nreceived financial and technical support from AFD to assist four NGOs, has been integrated\ninto MSD (para. 60). MSD undertakes off-site and on-site inspection of specialized banks and\nMFIs. At present, NBC monitors the financial activities of major NGOs, which submit quarterly\nreports on a voluntary basis. Further details on NBC are in Appendix 10.", "24\nG. Environmental and Social Measures\n \n1. Environment\n89. An initial environmental examination was carried out over a six-week period during\nNovember-December 1998. During this period, field visits were undertaken to observe selected\nmicroenterprises,  and  consultations  were held  with  the  staff of  the  prospective  LFIs  and\nsubborrowers. This examination indicated that adverse environmental impacts from activities\nfinanced under the Project will be insignificant or very localized individually. The Project will not\nhave  large-scale  or  intensive  adverse  environmental  impacts  unless  the  subborrowers\u2019\nactivities lead to a substantial increase in (i) the use of toxic pesticides, (ii) the exploitation of\nforests, (iii) uncontrolled quarrying, or (iv) unmanaged modification of the hydrological regime.\n90. To minimize the risks of adverse environmental impacts, the Project will ensure sound\nenvironmental management through (i) the provision of environmental training designed for\ncredit officers and managers of LFIs, (ii) the dissemination of information and resources to\nprovide LFIs with access to alternative measures of environmentally sustainable production\ntechnologies, and  (iii)  possible  collaboration  with  the  Ministry  of  Environment  in adopting\nproper  procedures  for  environmental  monitoring.  These  activities  will  be  also  used  for\nenvironmental monitoring during project implementation and in the project completion review.\nOne person in the PMU will be responsible for (i) organizing environmental training programs,\n(ii)  developing  a  database  for  natural  resource  management  relating  to  the  Project,  (iii)\nfacilitating working relations with LFIs regarding their environment-related activities, and (iv)\npromoting environmental monitoring programs among LFIs. ADB's TA will assist RDB and LFIs\nin this regard (para. 25).\n91. The capacity for proper environmental management is still limited in Cambodia in terms\nof both the regulatory framework and skilled personnel. This limited capacity is mostly confined\nto large-scale industrial enterprises. The institutions relating to microfinance operations are\nnow beginning to acquire knowledge and skills for proper environmental management. Since\nsmall-scale enterprises in rural areas may entail threats to environment, there is a strong need\nfor enhancing the capacity of LFIs in sound environmental management. Such needs were\nfully considered during the preparation of the Project. The initial environmental examination is\nsummarized in Appendix 11.\n2. Social Analysis\n92. The  social  assessment  was  carried  out  during  project  preparation  to  establish  an\nunderstanding about the intended beneficiaries. The social assessment specifically aimed at\nidentifying the clientele, examining their socioeconomic conditions, analyzing their needs and\nabsorptive capacity in relation to rural financial services, and examining other social concerns.\nThe results of the social assessment were fully taken into account during the formulation of the\nProject.  The  field  surveys  were  conducted  for  three  weeks  during  October  1998  in  four\nrepresentative  provinces.  The  preliminary  social  assessment  results  were  presented  in\nNovember 1998 at a workshop for the prospective LFIs. The summary social assessment is\npresented in Appendix 12.\n93. The project clientele will be rural people living outside Phnom Penh, in provincial towns\nand rural areas. The sample covered under the social assessment had a high incidence of\npoverty or near-poverty. The sample represents a significant portion of subgroups in the client", "25\ngroup of the Project. The household size in the surveyed area averaged six people, which is\nslightly higher than the national average of 5.2. Eight percent of the total households surveyed\nwere headed by females, whereas the national average is 25 percent. Ninety one percent of\nthe population is literate to some degree. Illiteracy is higher among poorer households. Female\nilliteracy (15 percent) is higher than that of males (5 percent). Households value education for\ntheir children and they regularly save for school fees, even though this is a major burden on\npoor households. The cost of health care limits the access of the rural poor to health services.\nIllnesses and accidents can result in major financial burdens for the poor, forcing the sale of\nassets such as land and livestock to generate funds.\n94. Rural  roads  are  in  a  generally  deteriorated  condition  due  to  the  lack  of  regular\nmaintenance. Bicycles and animal-drawn carts remain important modes of transportation for\nmost rural households. Wood, obtained from public forests, is the main source of energy for\ncooking and other purposes. Scarcity of wood is an increasingly serious problem in the rural\narea. A regular electricity supply exists only in towns. About 30 percent of the households in the\nsurveyed area rely on storage batteries for basic electricity. Five percent own a generator, which\nis a highly valued asset in villages. Poor households without electricity rely on kerosene for\nlighting. Major economic assets include land, buildings, gold, livestock, agricultural equipment,\nand other items such as motorcycles, generators, and televisions. Such assets often serve as\ncollateral for individual loans. Other socioeconomic indicators, which were collected during the\nsocial assessment, also reflect conditions of rural poverty in Cambodia. Access to various social\nfacilities  is  limited  or  unavailable  for  most  poor  households  in  the  rural  areas.  The  rural\nhouseholds  that  are  expected  to  participate  in  the  Project  are  facing  these  constraints  to\nimproved livelihoods.\n95. The  dominant  livelihood  is  agriculture,  predominantly  rice  farming.  Of  households\nsurveyed, 57 percent are engaged in rice cultivation. Corn, sweet potatoes, cassava, and other\nvegetables are grown as market crops, but generally on a small scale. Livestock raising is a\nsignificant source of secondary household income. To address the needs of the rural poor, the\nProject will support the rural finance activities of NGOs whose agenda are consistent with the\nobjective of the Project to reduce rural poverty.\n96. It is difficult to form a reliable estimate of the poverty incidence in the surveyed area.\nHowever, using a daily income of less than KR1,210 ($0.32) per capita and the ownership of\nless than 0.5 ha of agricultural land as indicators for rural poverty, about 65 percent of the\nsurveyed households can be classified as poor. Generally, there is a large gap between a\nsmall number of better-off people, and people belonging to the poor and the near-poor groups,\nwho constitute the majority of rural population. Some of the better-off people become sources\nof informal credit for poorer households in the rural area. Poor people are usually engaged in\nwage labor and other off-farm employment in addition to agriculture as additional sources of\nincome, and need to work hard to avoid a cycle of heavy debt burden.\n97. Women in Cambodia have greater equality with men than women in many of ADB\u2019s other\ndeveloping member countries. Women and men have equal status under law, including the right\nto  own  land.  The  legal  status  and  rights  of  women  are  protected  under  the  Cambodian\nconstitution.  At  the  household  level,  women  are  active  and  usually  equal  participants  in\nhousehold  management  and  decision  making.  Wives  usually  handle  household  financial\ntransactions although decisions are jointly made with husbands. Women are full partners in rice\ncultivation, being engaged in activities such as transplanting seedlings from seedbeds to fields.\nBoth men and women are involved in harvesting, transporting, and threshing. Many other farm\nactivities are shared, such as carrying water and wood, and tending livestock. However, women", "26\nare traditionally less empowered than men in companies and government offices in Cambodia.\nSome social restrictions in terms of transportation and appearance are apparently affecting the\nmobility of women in the rural area.\n98. During the social assessment, nearly all households showed interest in borrowing to\nsupport  income-generating  activities.  While  the  decision  to  borrow  is  a  shared  household\ndecision, women, particularly those who are single and widowed, expressed greater interest in\nhaving better access to credit. Such credit will be used to increase agricultural production or\nexpand off-farm income-generating activities. The demand for reliable savings facilities is equally\nstrong among households for better management of household budget and consumption.\n V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA. Financial and Economic Analyses\n99. Financial  and  economic  analyses  were  conducted  for  an  indicative  sample  of\nsubprojects to be financed under the Project. The sample of subprojects used in the analyses\nincludes  retail  trading,  pig  raising,  rice  production,  small-scale  irrigation,  palm  sugar\nproduction, small-scale rice milling, silk weaving, and brick making. These subprojects have\nbeen selected based on discussions with people who received loans from NGOs for income-\ngenerating activities, and on the social survey conducted during the project preparation. The\nresults of the analyses are discussed below and presented in detail in Appendix 13. A financial\nprojection for RDB has been prepared separately and included in Appendix 9.\n1. Financial Analysis\na.  Quantifiable Benefits\n100. Quantifiable benefits from the illustrative subprojects have been derived as the values\nof incremental production less the values of incremental costs. Data and information on these\nbenefits and costs were collected from credit-operating NGOs and their borrowers. In the case\nof rice production inputs, where many loans have been provided for a wide range of alternative\ninputs, additional information has been obtained from staff engaged in agricultural extension\nservices.  Thus, all  the  illustrative  subprojects  are  considered  to  reflect  accurate  financial\nprojections for subprojects to be financed under the Project. The without-project situation is an\nassessment of what the subborrowers would be doing if they did not receive a loan. For rice\ncropping and small-scale irrigation under the without-project situation, it was assumed that less\nintensive activities would be practiced, while for pig raising it was assumed that fewer animals\nwould be raised. For all other subprojects, it was assumed that subborrowers would be unable\nto finance  their  activities  without  loans and  hence  would  neither  incur  costs  nor  receive\nbenefits.\n101. All subproject models exclude any allowance for interest on credit to calculate their\nfinancial internal rates of return (FIRR). FIRRs have been calculated for individual subprojects\nwith longer term duration. The FIRRs range from 23 percent to 91 percent, and show that the\nsubprojects are financially viable given the current real interest rate of about 20 percent. These\nsubprojects use family labor, thus incurring substantially low labor costs. Even under the\nfinancially most conservative scenario for labor based on the market wage rate of about\nKR4,000 ($1) per day, subprojects will be generally viable except for small-scale rice milling.\nThe results of calculations are shown in Table A13.1 of Appendix 13.", "27\n102. Sensitivity  analyses  were  carried  out  to  assess  the  financial  viability  of  multiyear\nsubprojects under adverse project scenarios relating to an increase in the investment cost and\na decrease in the revenue (Appendix 13). Although there are considerable variations among\nthe  selected  subprojects,  their  financial  viability  remains  strong  under  these  scenarios.\nSubprojects of pig raising, small-scale rice milling, and palm sugar production are relatively\nmore sensitive to changes in the investment cost and revenue. The borrowers\u2019 responses to\nthe conditions of local markets are usually quick through changes in their types of activities.\n103. Based on the business plans of the prospective LFIs, about 260,000 rural households\nare likely to benefit from the Project. More than 70 percent of these households are expected\nto be poor households. The project impact on employment will depend on the numbers and\ntypes of subprojects to be financed and the incremental labor-days generated. The incremental\nemployment expected from each subproject type is indicated in Table A13.2 of Appendix 13.\nAssuming that the composition of types of subprojects under the Project will be similar to that\nof NGOs\u2019 current credit operations and that the Project will have average loans outstanding of\n70 percent of disbursement from the total amount of loans for subprojects, the Project is\nexpected to generate about 66,000 jobs.\nb. Transaction and Administration Costs\n104. Transaction  costs  are  not  significant  as  most  programs  of  credit-operating  NGOs\nprovide  services at  the  village  level, thus  minimizing  travel  costs  to  their  borrowers  and\nreducing their risk of loan default. Where the borrowers have to travel to provincial or district\ncenters to obtain loans, the distance involved is relatively short. Neither compulsory savings\nnor physical collateral are featured in most of the credit programs. The social assessment\nconducted for the Project reported that only 5 percent of loans from NGOs are secured against\nthe collateral of a house, land certificate, or gold, while the remaining loans are secured\nthrough group guarantee. Experience of NGOs is that collateral is of little direct value since it is\ndifficult to seize in cases of default. Overall transaction costs are minimal and no increase is\nanticipated under the Project.\n105. At present, the credit administration costs of the prospective LFIs, particularly staff\nexpenses, are still high at more than 40 percent of loans outstanding. With the growth in their\nloan portfolios, these costs are expected to decline to industry standards by the end of the\nProject. Staff expenses account for about half of administration expenses of these prospective\nLFIs. LFI administrative expenses are expected to drop substantially during the project period,\nand this reduction in the administrative expenses will be reflected in the reduction in the\ninterest rate to be charged to subborrowers. By expanding the operations of LFIs, the Project\nwill provide the rural poor with easier access to credit facilities.\nc. Impact on Financial Institutions\n106. LFIs participating in the Project, including MFIs, will be strengthened by their need to\ncomply  with  financial  structures  and  performance  as  stipulated  in  the  regulations  to  be\nenforced by NBC. By being required to demonstrate profitability, LFIs will be able to attract a\ndiverse  range  of  funding  sources  and  financing  terms  from  depositors,  external  funding\nagencies, commercial lenders, and equity investors. This diversity will strengthen the liability\nstructure of LFIs  necessary for their  long-term and  sustainable expansion  of  assets  and\nservices. In providing savings facilities, LFIs will improve financial intermediation within rural\ncommunities and encourage funds to flow toward better yielding investments. The provision of\nsavings facilities will allow many rural households to accumulate and hold liquidity in a safe", "28\nand attractive manner. In playing a more significant role within communities, LFIs will become\nmore responsive to the financial needs and opportunities of rural communities.\nd. Willingness to Pay\n107. Excellent repayment records achieved by NGOs in Cambodia provide strong evidence\nof borrowers\u2019 willingness to pay when services are provided in a timely and efficient manner,\nand where the ongoing availability of loans is assured. Seven of 10 major NGOs reported\naverage loan recovery rates in 1997 and 1998 in excess of 90 percent. In situations where a\nfollow-on loan cannot be assured, as has been frequently encountered with short-duration\nproject activities, borrowers show some reluctance to repay their loans. The provision of longer\nterm credit lines through RDB is essential to strengthen the activities of LFIs. NGOs also agree\nthat financing vehicles and equipment for their capacity building under the Project on credit\nrather than as a grant will encourage more rigorous assessments of their own needs.\n2. Economic Analysis\n108. Economic analyses have been carried out for the same subprojects as those included\nin  the  financial  analysis.  Economic  prices  for  the  main  traded  inputs  and  outputs\n(predominantly  rice  and  fertilizer)  are  based  on  the  latest  World  Bank  commodity  price\nprojections, adjusted to constant 1998 values prior to adjusting to farmgate values. Minor\ntraded and nontraded inputs and outputs have been converted to economic values using a\nstandard conversion factor of 0.9 in accordance with the current ADB practice for Cambodia.\nThe economic cost of labor is estimated using a shadow wage rate of 0.75 for employed labor,\nwhich  is usually  unskilled  or  semiskilled,  reflecting  the  limited  alternative  opportunities  in\nCambodia.  The  shadow  wage  rate  for  family  labor  is  0.95,  reflecting  the  availability  of\nalternative wage labor and greater entrepreneurial skills.\n109. The estimated economic rates of return are summarized in Table A13.1 of Appendix\n13. The sample subprojects included in the analysis are considered to be economically viable.\nMicro- and small-scale processing and manufacturing appear to be the most economically\nviable activities with economic internal rates of return ranging from 13 percent to 62 percent.\nSensitivity analyses of the economic internal rates of return were also conducted for changes\nin the investment costs and revenue of subprojects (Table A13.3 of Appendix 13). The results\nshow that subprojects for pig raising and palm sugar production are more sensitive to the\nincrease in investment costs and the decrease in revenue, and require careful planning for\ninvestment. The economic viability of other subprojects remains strong under adverse project\nscenarios.\n110. Subborrowers are expected to benefit directly from subprojects, which will provide them\nwith confidence for further expansion. LFIs will derive substantial benefits by demonstrating\nsustainable financial services and expanding their clientele. Similarly, the strengthening of\nRDB\u2019s banking skills and financial management, and the supervisory capacity of NBC, will\nenhance their management of microfinance projects and programs, and support for LFIs.\nB. Environment\n111. The environmental impact of the Project will be positive. By installing sound practices\nfor environmental management in microfinance activities of the prospective LFIs, the Project\nwill be able to avoid adverse environmental impacts and to safeguard and enhance the natural\nresource base in the country. RDB staff engaged in credit operations and LFI staff will gain", "29\nawareness of environmental concerns in rural areas. They are expected to learn a set of\nanalytical tools for assessing the environmental impact of subprojects. The PMU will have an\nofficer  responsible for environmental  concerns  to  ensure  that  subprojects  are  adequately\nmonitored.  Functional  linkages  will  be  developed  between  environmental  and  financial\ninstitutions.  LFIs  participating  in  the  Project  will  gain  improved  access  to  the  existing\nCambodian technical expertise to support sustainable resource management approaches in\ntheir activities.\nC. Social Dimensions\n1. Poverty Reduction\n112. In Cambodia, the Government has explicitly committed to the reduction of rural poverty\nas its most important development objective (para. 21). The Project will greatly contribute to this\npolicy objective by providing small-scale income-generating activities and sustainable savings\nfacilities for rural households, which constitute about 90 percent of the poor population in the\ncountry. At present, there are no safe and credible savings facilities to hold liquid assets to meet\ntheir emergency or seasonal needs. The financial needs of most rural households are being\naccommodated by borrowing from individual lenders, who charge high interest rates on funds,\noften up to 10 percent per month. High costs of funds make it difficult to escape from the poverty\ncycle. In view of the strong demand for effective rural financial services, NGOs are considering\nexpanding their coverage and transforming into LFIs. The five prospective LFIs (para. 58) that\nhave been initially identified to participate in the Project will be working in at least 15 larger\nprovinces during the project period, which cover 93 percent of the total rural households in the\ncountry.\n113. As reflected in the social assessment, the prospective beneficiaries have shown a\nstrong demand for borrowing, and, despite the NGOs\u2019 expanding coverage, there is a large\namount of unmet demand for credit in the rural area. Poor rural households will benefit from\nthe  Project  through  increased  availability and  reliability of a  range of  credit  and  savings\nservices  to  be  provided  through  LFIs.  The  availability  of  these  financial  services  will\nsubstantially contribute to the improvement of rural women's livelihoods by providing financial\nsupport for their on-farm and off-farm income-generating activities. The Project will build upon\nthe initiatives of NGOs to address social issues among the rural poor in line with the LFIs\u2019\nrespective  agenda  for  poverty  reduction.  The  Project  will  support  the  expansion  of  LFIs\u2019\noutreach in both credit and savings, and strengthen LFIs\u2019 operational sustainability.\n2. Community-Based Rural Finance\n114. The Project will be implemented based on an approach where financial intermediaries\noperate close to the communities they serve. This approach will enable these intermediaries to\nidentify specific constraints to the improvement of the communities\u2019 rural livelihoods. LFIs are\nexpected to provide rural people with a wide range of services along with rural finance. In\naddition, their activities and outreach in community development will be expanded in both width\nand depth by transforming themselves into LFIs, and will contribute to the broadening of the\nrural economic base. The mobilization of savings within rural communities will expand the local\nresource base for further investment in economic activities and provide the rural poor with\nbetter access to safe and credible savings facilities.", "30\nD. Risks\n115. The major risk is that RDB will be used for policy or directed lending operations. If used\nin this way, for example to provide loans directly to some farmers at below-market rates of\ninterest, RDB would not be able to survive as a viable financial institution for many years. As\nseen in other developing countries, such institutions will then require some form of institutional\nrehabilitation, which will usually result in failure. This situation would actually be against the\nGovernment\u2019s policy and strategy for rural credit in Cambodia. Thus, RDB will be required to\nretain  its  viability as  a  wholesale financial  institution under  the  Project.  RDB\u2019s  role  as  a\nwholesaler of commercially and externally sourced funds is important so that RDB can attract\nand fully service open market funding, especially in domestic markets, for agriculture and rural\ndevelopment. The Project has included a specific loan covenant to ensure the wholesaling\nfunction of RDB. The subdecree and the statute of RDB clearly indicate this function. RDB is\nalso expected to develop financial linkages with other commercial banks by acting as a catalyst\nbetween the overall financial sector in the country and LFIs.\n116. ADB also considers that the capabilities of institutions relating to the Project, including\nRDB, NBC, and LFIs, should be strengthened in collaboration with other external funding\nagencies in Cambodia. Sound institutional development is essential for the establishment of\nsustainable financial services in the rural area. In conjunction with the Project, an advisory TA\nhas been provided (para. 25).\nVI.  ASSURANCES\nA. Conditions for Loan Effectiveness\n117. The Government has given the following assurances, which have been incorporated in\nthe legal documents:\n(i) Prior to loan effectiveness, the subsidiary loan agreement, in form and substance\nsatisfactory  to  ADB,  will  be  duly  executed  and  delivered  on  behalf  of  the\nGovernment and RDB, and become fully effective and binding on the parties\nthereto in accordance with its terms.\n(ii) Prior to loan effectiveness, RDB will provide ADB with a satisfactory five-year\ncorporate plan that includes corporate goals, strategies, and an implementation\nplan, and is supported by its projected financial statements.\n(iii) Prior  to  loan  effectiveness,  NBC  will  assign  at  least  five  full-time  staff  for\nsupervision of LFIs.\nB. Other Specific Assurances\n118. Other specific assurances of the Government required during project implementation are\nas follows:\n(i) Within three months of loan effectiveness, the Government will establish a PCC,\nwhich will meet at least twice yearly and function as a central-level coordination\nbody  to  support  project  activities  by  providing  overall  policy  guidance  and\ndirections for project implementation, and by helping resolve any outstanding\nissues.", "31\n(ii) RDB will confine its role to being a wholesaler of funds only through LFIs. In this\ncontext, the Government and RDB will transfer any loans made to any entities\nthat are not licensed by NBC as financial institutions, from the RDB\u2019s accounts to\nanother bank, financial institution, fund, or organization.\n(iii) RDB will operate in a self-sustained manner in line with the Government\u2019s new\nrural credit policy, and will, at all times, conform fully to the law on banking and\nfinancial institutions and banking regulations with respect to its financial structure\nand prudential ratios as stipulated by NBC.\n(iv)  RDB will maintain its policy for the classification of loans and loan write-offs, and\nprocedures for their implementation, in compliance with NBC regulations.\n(v) Loan proceeds through the credit line will be held in a revolving fund accessible\nsolely by LFIs.\n(vi) RDB will submit to ADB annual financial statements audited by an external\nauditor satisfactory to ADB, together with the description of specific measures in\nresponse to the auditor\u2019s opinions.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\n119.

The Financial Sector\n1. Background\n1. Due to the destruction of the banking system during the Khmer Rouge period, the\nNational Bank of Cambodia (NBC)  was  the  only  operating bank until  July  1989.  NBC\nperformed both central and commercial bank functions through its network of 20 provincial\nbranches. By Decree No. 58 dated 26 July 1989, the Government allowed the formation of\nprivate commercial banks as limited liability companies. In 1991, the first private commercial\nbank was established as a joint venture between NBC and the Siam Commercial Bank of\nThailand. Subsequently, a law on the supervision of financial institutions was passed by the\nNational Assembly on 27 August 1992, which was followed on 16 November 1992 by a\nsubdecree on the supervision of commercial banks. These laws and regulations formed the\nlegal framework for commercial banks in Cambodia until November 1999 when the new law\non banking and financial institutions was enacted.\n2. With the privatization of the banking sector and the discontinuance of NBC as a\ncommercial bank, farmers and entrepreneurs with small and medium  landholdings and\nbusinesses were suddenly deprived of access to financial services. The impact of this\nsudden  disruption  in  the  provision  of  small-scale  finance  was  partly  alleviated  by  the\nintroduction of nonlicensed credit providers under the credit and savings schemes supported\nby  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  and  through  credit-delivery  nongovernment\norganizations  (NGOs).  In  most  areas  outside  Phnom  Penh,  farmers  and  small-scale\nbusinesses  still  depend  for  credit  on  individual  moneylenders,  including  relatives  and\nmiddlemen in trade.\n2. Licensed Commercial Banks\n3. As of December 1999, Cambodia had 31 operating licensed banks with total assets\nof  KR2,097  billion  ($552  million),  an  increase  of  about  21  percent  since  the  end  of\nDecember 1998. Loans outstanding at these commercial banks amount to KR751 billion\n($198 million) or an increase of 14 percent from 1998. Of total commercial lending, more\nthan 90 percent  was  in foreign  currencies  mostly  in  US dollars.  Classified by type  of\nbusiness, the largest amount of lending was for wholesale and retail trade (26 percent),\nfollowed by services and personal consumption (25 percent), manufacturing (22 percent),\nimport and export (14 percent), and other miscellaneous activities (13 percent). Agriculture-\nrelated businesses comprised about KR31 billion ($8 million) or 4 percent of total lending\nthrough 12 banks. As of the end of December 1999, deposits held in banks totaled KR1,150\nbillion ($303 million), of which 93 percent was held in foreign currencies, mainly in US\ndollars. There has been little change in the proportion of deposits held in foreign currency\nover the last three years. Demand deposits comprise 37 percent of total deposits.\n4. Two banks, the Foreign Trade Bank and the Rural Development Bank (RDB), are\nGovernment-owned while other banks are all privately owned. Of these private commercial\nbanks, four are fully owned by domestic interests while the remainder has full or partial\nforeign ownership. Fully domestically owned banks comprise 34 percent of the total assets\nof the banking sector and share 19 percent of consolidated profits. Outside Phnom Penh,\nthere are 18 bank branches in nine provinces. Since bank branches are located in towns,\nonly 10 percent of total households in Cambodia and 64 percent of urban households have\nreasonably good access to formal banking services. In the nine provinces served by bank", "Appendix 2, page 2\nbranches outside Phnom Penh, there are about 64,000 households per bank branch on\naverage while in Phnom Penh, where there are 36 banks and bank branches, the figure is\n4,800 households per bank branch.\n5. The banking sector grew marginally in real terms from 1998 to 1999 due to political\nstability in Cambodia. The average net worth per bank is KR25.0 billion ($6.6 million).\nAverage total assets per bank is KR68.0 billion ($17.9 million). For the year ending 31\nDecember 1999, the 10 largest banks had a return on equity of 4.0 percent and a return on\ntotal assets of 1.5 percent. The volume of total deposits increased by 29 percent for the\nbanking sector since the end of December 1998.\n3. Nonlicensed Financial Services\na. Nongovernment Organizations\n6. As  of  the  end  of  December  1999,  25  NGOs  listed  by  NBC  had  total  loans\noutstanding of approximately KR80.3  billion  ($21.1  million),  see  Appendix  3.  The  total\nnumber of borrowers was about 255,200 or 11 percent of total rural households. NGOs\ncurrently charge effective interest rates between 36-72 percent, or 3-6 percent flat per\nmonth on their lending. Larger NGOs and those making loans to individual borrowers have\nlower interest rates on their lending. Administrative costs are often more than 40 percent of\naverage loans outstanding with an overall average for the five largest NGOs at 25 percent.\nThis excludes the cost of technical assistance financed by external funding agencies as a\ngrant. Loan recovery rates are 80-100 percent, and the average rate for the five largest\nNGOs is 96 percent.\nb. Project-Supported Services\n7. Rural credit provided through the United Nations Children's Fund, the Ministry of\nWomen's Affairs, and the European Union, amount to $1.49 million in loans outstanding and\ncovers 47,470 borrowers. The largest portion is under the program of the European Union,\nwith $1.25 million in loans outstanding to 28,000  borrowers.  The  initial focus of these\nprograms was the provision of emergency relief, and has now been directed to sustainability\nand institutional issues.\nc. Traders and Individual Moneylenders\n8. According to a recent socioeconomic survey in 1996, only 1 percent of the rural\nhouseholds  that  took  loans  between  1994  and  1995  received  loans  from  licensed\ncommercial banks. The remaining households received loans from NGOs  and  informal\nmoneylenders, including traders and relatives. Of these loans from informal sources, 37\npercent were used for agricultural production or investment in small-scale businesses. Other\nloans were used for meeting emergency expenses such as medical expenses for the family.\nInterest rates on loans from informal sources are high, often up to 10 percent per month.\nDespite high interest rates, borrowers continue to depend on informal sources for a variety\nof  reasons  including  ease  of  access,  flexibility  in  loan  repayment  terms,  personal\nrelationships, and lack of alternatives.\nB. Legislation\n9. To provide a comprehensive legal framework for the banking sector and to support\nthe development and strengthening of microfinance institutions (MFIs), the Government", "Appendix 2, page 3\nintroduced a new law on banking and financial institutions (in November 1999) and related\nregulations. This was followed by a set of regulations appropriate to MFIs. The Government\nis committed to strengthening NBC's licensing, regulation, and supervision of MFIs. RDB\u2019s\nsubdecree was revised in November 1999 to stipulate that it would operate as a wholesale\nbank to channel funds to licensed financial institutions, which are engaged in rural finance.\nTo facilitate the provision of rural financial services in remote areas, the Government will\ncontinue to monitor credit activities of NGOs and community-based organizations, and to\nencourage their linkage to licensed MFIs or their efforts to become licensed institutions.\nCommercial interest rates, liberalized by NBC under a subdecree issued on 16 March 1995,\nwill continue to be determined by commercial banks according to each bank's policy and\nfinancial performance. This liberalized interest policy will be extended to cover MFIs.\n10. Under the new law on banking and financial institutions, financial services of NGOs\ncan be  converted  into formal  financial  transactions  under  NBC\u2019s  supervision.  This  will\nincrease public confidence in their financial services and encourage the expansion of their\nactivities. NGOs are also expected to register with whatever Government ministries are\nrelevant to their scope of activities. Domestic NGOs are registered with the Ministry of\nInterior, and international NGOs are registered with various ministries including the Ministry\nof Foreign Affairs. Prior to applying for an MFI license, NGOs will need to incorporate as\nlegal entities, mostly as limited liability public companies. Since 1998, NGOs, which are\nexpected to participate  in  the  Project,  had  started  identifying  shareholders  needed  for\nincorporation as companies. At least five licensed financial institutions will be participating in\nthe Project.", "Appendix 3, page 1\nCREDIT AND SAVINGS OPERATIONS OF NGOS\nA. Description of Nongovernment Operations\n1. The Cooperation Committee for Cambodia reports that 296 nongovernment organizations\n(NGOs) are registered with the Government, of which 163 are domestic and 133 foreign. In\naddition, 100 NGOs are not registered with the Government but are operating in Cambodia.1\nAbout 90 NGOs are engaged in credit operations. At present, the Supervision Department of the\nNational Bank of Cambodia (NBC) monitors financial activities of major credit-operating NGOs.\nAccording to NBC\u2019s records and individual reports from these NGOs, as of 31 December 1999,\n25 major credit-operating NGOs had KR80.3 billion ($21.1 million) in lending to about 255,200\nborrowers (Table A3.1) and total savings of KR2.2 billion ($579,000) or about 3 percent of loans\noutstanding. NBC also monitors the activities of two project-based rural credit schemes of the\nGovernment. A review of the nine largest NGOs showed that between 1996 and 1999, total\nloans outstanding increased from KR18.2 billion ($4.8 million) to KR76.0 billion ($20.0 million)\nand the number of borrowers from 78,000 to 192,000. Major NGOs in Cambodia confirmed the\nhigh levels of unsatisfied demand for credit and feel that they need to expand their activities\nrapidly at least in the medium term.\n2. Savings services remain weak, with few NGOs putting emphasis on the mobilization of\npublic savings. In general, borrower groups and communities are reluctant to manage savings\nby themselves because of security problems and potential conflicts that may arise in their\ncommunities. Access to savings is usually only upon withdrawal from group savings. At present,\nthe new law on banking and financial institutions provides a legal basis for the savings\noperations of NGOs for (i) the protection of depositors and creditors; (ii) reporting needs of NBC,\nwhich is charged with the duty of monitoring macroeconomic aggregates including credit creation\nand mobilization of savings; and (iii) the question of clear accountability in the event of legal\ncases. However, NGOs have not launched on full-scale savings schemes.\n3. NGO lending is usually carried out through village banks and borrower groups, and to\nindividual borrowers. A common approach involves (i) group formation, (ii) motivation and\ntraining, and (iii) formation of a larger village-based association consisting of all groups in the\nvillage. Mutual guarantee groups are formed by the villagers themselves with the assistance of\nan NGO and occasionally with the assistance of a village development committee. There are no\nintervillage associations for credit operations. In a village, the membership of the association\nvaries from 90 to 200, often involving most households in the village. One household is usually\nrepresented by one member, who does not have to be a borrower. A credit committee is also set\nup with heads of all group leaders, from whose ranks a president and a vice-president are\nelected. These two people are responsible for major decisions such as the formation of new\ngroups. They are also responsible for collections. Mutual guarantee is now a familiar mechanism\nto ensure loan repayment. Group members are held jointly responsible for loans. Failure of one\nperson to comply with rules and regulations or to meet financial obligations may result in the\nexclusion of all members from the association.\n4. Group lending is also carried out without the use of a village association, for instance,\nas in the case of the Association of Cambodian Local Economic Development Agencies\n(ACLEDA). Group loans from ACLEDA are denominated in riel and are provided through groups\nof borrowers, predominantly women, being formed with 3-10 members. At the end of December\n1999, 94 percent of ACLEDA\u2019s active group loan borrowers were women. Prior to receiving loan\n                                               \n1  A comprehensive list of NGOs in Cambodia is provided in two documents of Cooperation Committee for Cambodia:\nDirectory of International Humanitarian Assistance in Cambodia, and Directory of Cambodian NGOs.", "Appendix 3, page 2\nservices, each group receives six hours of training on the use of credit funds. Groups are formed\nfrom members within the same community following a briefing from ACLEDA staff. A group\nleader appointed by group members is responsible for collecting loan repayments weekly or\nmonthly and making these payments to the ACLEDA office. For this service, the group leader\nreceives a commission of 1 percent of repayments.\n5. Many NGOs provide for lending to individuals but, except for ACLEDA and Hattha\nKaksekar (HK), this is a negligible part of their total loan portfolio. The size of the loan for\nindividuals is usually $300-$2,000, mostly denominated in US dollars.\nB. Participating Licensed Financial Institutions\n6. Based on the present performance of their credit operations and interest in having access\nto the project funds as licensed financial institutions (LFIs), five NGOs have been identified for\nparticipation in the Project: ACLEDA; Cambodia Community Building (CCB); a group of local\nNGOs affiliated with the Catholic Relief Services (CRS) International and funded by the United\nStates Agency for International Development (USAID); HK; and Ennatien Moulethan Tchonnebat\n(EMT). All of these NGOs are expected to become LFIs during the first two years of the Project.\nThe financial performance and projections for these institutions show that their operations will\ncontinue to be viable over the project period. The Project will cover the operations of LFIs initially\nin the northwestern, eastern, and southern regions where major NGOs are currently active\n(Table A3.2).\n7. ACLEDA is expected to obtain a license from NBC in April 2000 and, for this purpose,\ntechnical assistance is being provided by a consortium of external funding agencies consisting\nof  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  USAID,  and  the  International  Finance\nCorporation. This assistance covers banking management, banking organization, accounting\nsystems,  computer  systems  review,  management  information  systems,  and  product\ndevelopment. Through a head office in Phnom Penh, ACLEDA now provides services at 27\nbranches in 12 provinces. It will open two more branches in Kompong Chhnang and Svay Rieng\nprovinces by 2001. As of 31 December 1999, total loans outstanding were about KR51.8 billion\n($13.6 million) to 58,355 borrowers, of which about 17 percent are individual borrowers. Interest\nrates are 5.0 percent per month for group loans and 4.0 percent per month for individual loans\nboth on a flat basis. Individual loans in US dollars carry lower rates. Average loan disbursement\nper borrower in 1999 was $1,497 for individual borrowers and $138 for group borrowers.\nACLEDA has generated net profits from its financial transactions since 1998. ACLEDA plans to\nachieve a loan portfolio of at least $43 million during the project period with 118,000 borrowers.\n8. EMT, the local counterpart of the French NGO Groupe de Recherche et d'Echanges\nTechnologique (GRET), was formed in 1996 to take over its microfinance operations. At present,\nGRET is providing EMT with technical support for its rural finance activities. EMT will apply for\na license as an MFI following its incorporation (expected in 2000), and will have GRET and at\nleast five other major shareholders. EMT is also being assisted for its transformation to an LFI\nby the Government of France through a technical assistance project. EMT currently has\noperations in six provinces through 18 district branches with about 56,600 borrowers, and plans\nto expand its outreach to 150,000 borrowers by the end of the project period. It expects to be\nable to expand loans outstanding from around $1.8 million in 1999, with an average loan\noutstanding per borrower of $32, to $7.6 million in 2005. The interest rate on lending is 4 percent\nper month on a declining basis. For 1998, EMT made a nominal profit subject to interest charges\non subordinate loans received from the Government of France through the Government of\nCambodia.", "Appendix 3, page 3\n9. The CRS, with USAID funding, carries out a number of functions including (i) direct\nsavings and credit services through two branch offices in two provinces, (ii) a partnership\nprogram  for  strengthening  domestic  NGOs  in  credit  and  savings  operations,  and  (iii)\ndevelopment of NGOs interested in microfinance operations. For these activities, CRS receives\nsubstantial support from CRS International and USAID. CRS plans to increase its number of\npartner NGOs from 7 to 12 by 2005. In forming a licensed MFI, some of these partners could\nbecome shareholders in a conglomerate MFI. The total number of CRS borrowers is projected\nto rise to over 80,000 in 2005 from the current level of about 31,600. In parallel, the average\nportfolio is expected to increase to about $5.0 million in 2005. There will be a parallel increase\nin the number of borrowers of partner NGOs, which will form a conglomerate MFI. The average\nloan outstanding per borrower is $43. The interest rate on a flat basis is 3.0 percent per month\nfor loans in riel. CRS credit operations are expected to remain viable.\n10. The main orientation of HK is the provision of rural financial services involving both\nsavings and credit. HK began as a project of Oxfam-Quebec in 1995. HK combines group\nlending  with  individual  loans.  HK's  experience  with  individual  loans  has  been  good  by\nconcentrating its focus on individual loans ranging from $50 to $500 and averaging $162. HK is\nalso considering an increase in the ceiling of the loan amount to about $1,000. Lending is in US\ndollars at a flat interest rate of 3.0 percent per month, has about 3,700 borrowers, and expects\nto have over 8,000 by 2005. The number of savers is expected to grow more rapidly, from\naround 3,200 to more than 10,000 over the same period. The current loan disbursement is\n$650,000 per year which is also projected to exceed $2 million by 2005. HK has two provincial\nbranches and one district branch, and expects to have four and six respectively, in 2005. HK has\nreceived technical assistance, especially from CARE International, in financial management and\nmanagement information systems. Training activities have included policy formulation for\ncorporate management, asset and portfolio management, management of cash and information\nflows, financial reconciliation, and reporting.\n11. CCB was created by an international NGO, the World Relief, which has been carrying out\nmicrofinance activities in Cambodia with support from USAID since 1992. CCB will take over the\nfinancial services of the World Relief, which will continue to provide technical support to CCB.\nA board of directors was established for CCB, which envisages being transformed into an LFI.\nHowever, at the end of 1999, CCB had an internal dispute, which will delay the procedures for\nbecoming a licensed institution. CCB has 13,600 clients with KR3.4 billion ($0.9 million) in loans\noutstanding and plans to expand its activities with one new branch each year until 2005. The\ntotal number of borrowers is projected to rise to over 35,000 by the end of the project period with\na loan portfolio of $2.7 million. At present, CCB\u2019s clients are all poor women. The loan size for\nfirst time borrowers ranges from $22 to $39. For subsequent borrowers, the maximum loan size\nis $240 and may rise to about $400 by the end of the project period. Lending in riel is at a flat\ninterest rate of 4.0 percent per month. There is 1.0 percent rebate for prompt repayment. The\ninterest rate on a dollar loan is 2.0 percent per month also on a flat basis. CCB\u2019s savings\nmobilization is modest; constituting some 25 percent of net loans outstanding, but is projected\nto rise to 30 percent during the project period.", " \nTable A3.1: 25 Large NGO Credit-Providers\n     31 December 1999\nb  c\nNGO Prospective   Loans Outstanding           Borrowers Avg.loan out/Borrower\na\n  LFI KR m. % No. % KR $\n1 ACLEDA X 51,790 64.5 58,355 22.9 887,499 234\n2 Ennatien Moulethan Tchonnebat X 6,967 8.7 56,646 22.2 122,992 32\n3 Catholic Relief Services X 5,121 6.4 31,589 12.4 162,113 43\n4 Cambodia Community Buildingd X 3,425 4.3 13,631 5.3 251,265 66\n5 Hattha Kaksekar X 2,299 2.9 3,741 1.5 614,542 162\n6 World Vision Int'l Cambodia 2,172 2.7 17,303 6.8 125,527 33\n7 Seilaniti   2,155 2.7 11,725 4.6 183,795 48\n8 Action Nord Sud 1,154 1.4 7,737 3.0 149,153 39\n9 Cambodia Health Committee 885 1.1 3,424 1.3 258,470 68\n10 Concern 837 1.0 17,300 6.8 48,382 13\n11 Help the Widows 686 0.9 4,117 1.6 166,626 44\n12 Community Action for Social Development 489 0.6 11,783 4.6 41,500 11\n13 Camfed 395 0.5 1,251 0.5 315,747 83\n14 Cambodia Rural Economic Development 332 0.4 3,318 1.3 100,060 26\n15 Samarkee 299 0.4 2,135 0.8 140,047 37\n16 Cambodia Women's Development Assoc. 233 0.3 1,046 0.4 222,753 59\n17 Buddhists for Development 188 0.2 836 0.3 224,880 59\n18 Lutheran World Service 169 0.2 2,635 1.0 64,137 17\n19 Small Economic Activity Development 120 0.1 1,364 0.5 87,977 23\n20 Arunreah 108 0.1 924 0.4 116,883 31\n21 Kratie Women's Welfare Association 106 0.1 1,112 0.4 95,324 25\n22 Khmer Rural Development Association 95 0.1 932 0.4 101,931 27\n23 Social Development in Rural Areas 89 0.1 588 0.2 151,361 40\n24 Rural Development Association 89 0.1 773 0.3 115,136 30\n25 Samarkithor 80 0.1 897 0.4 89,186 23\nTotals 80,283 100 255,162 100 314,635 83\n$21.13 million\nACLEDA=Association of Cambodian Local Economic Development Agencies;  LFI=licensed financial institution; NGO=nongovernment organization.\na  Expressed interest in becoming a licensed financial institution and participating in the Project.\nb  Generally, excludes loan loss provisions.\nc  In some cases the numbers refer to members rather than borrowers.\nd  As of 31 August 1999.\nSources: The National Bank of Cambodia and individual NGOs.\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n 3\n, p\na\ng\ne\n 4", "        Table A3.2: Provincial Presence of Formal and Semiformal Credit Providers\nProvince Population Population Total Rural Major NGOs Commercial\nDensity  Households Households ACLEDA EMT CRS  CCB Hattha Bank\n(people No. No. Partners Kaksekar Branches\n/km2) Total\nBanteay Meanchey 577,300 86 111,866 93,489 X X 2\nBattambang 791,958 68 148,315 122,743 X X 2 X\nKompong Cham 1,607,913 164 313,019 304,794 X X X 3 X\nKompong Chhnang 416,999 76 82,452 74,762 yr 2001 1\nKompong Speu 598,101 85 115,576 107,999 X X X 3 X\nKompong Thom 568,454 41 106,835 94,540 X X   2\nKampot 527,904 108 104,920 98,869 X X 2\nKandal 1,073,586 301 205,992 195,729 X X X X   4 X\nKoh Kong 131,912 12 24,926 19,559 X\nKratie 262,945 24 49,297 34,516\nMondol Kiri 32,392 2 5,673 4,398\nPhnom Penh 997,986 3,441 173,232 76,248 X X 2 X\nPreah Vihear 119,160 9 21,481 17,351\nPrey Veng 945,129 194 194,019 183,116 X 1\nPursat 360,291 28 68,206 57,367 X X 2\nRatanak Kiri 94,188 9 16,754 13,562\nSiem Reap 695,485 68 127,086 106,106 X X X 3 X\nKrong P.

Establishment of the Rural Development Bank\n1. The Rural Development Bank (RDB) was created by a Government subdecree in\nJanuary 1998. The main objective of RDB is to promote agricultural and rural development\nand other economic activities for the improvement of rural livelihoods and facilitate the\nalleviation of  rural poverty.  In  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  policy for  rural finance,1  the\nsubdecree  and  the  statute  of  RDB  were  modified  in  November  1999  to  promote\nmicrofinance operations, to facilitate linkage between RDB and the banking sector, and to\nenhance its professional focus. RDB has ceased retail lending and is operating solely as a\nwholesale financial intermediary. In addition to a professional accountant and a lawyer\nappointed earlier, RDB has employed six staff with banking experience and two staff with\nnongovernment  organization  (NGO)  experience.  Autonomy  of  management  has  been\ngradually demonstrated by its board. The governance of RDB is expected to improve with a\nnew board of directors  with  seven  representatives,  having one  director each from  the\nMinistry  of Economy  and  Finance,  the  Council of  Ministers, and  the  Ministry  of  Rural\nDevelopment; one representing commercial banks; one representing NGOs or  licensed\nMFIs; the Director General of RDB; and a representative of RDB\u2019s employees.\nB. Review of RDB\u2019s Operations\n2. At the beginning, RDB had developed a loan portfolio of $15,340 to 793 farmers in\nPrey Veng Province. The loans, for terms of five months, were appraised and approved by\nRDB, and farmers made full repayments. No further  lending  has been  made to these\nfarmers. As of December 1999, RDB had 25 staff, including the director general, the deputy\ndirector general, 11 officers, 4 secretaries, and 8 supporting staff. The loan portfolio has\nreached more than KR3,355 million ($0.9 million) with lending to NGOs and commercial\nbanks. The loans are for terms of 6-12 months, at 12-15 percent per annum in US dollars\nand 15-20 percent per annum in riel.\n3. A comprehensive corporate plan for RDB is required so that RDB\u2019s corporate policy\nwill become clear and formalized. Such a plan needs to be prepared before the Asian\nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  loan  becomes  effective,  and  should  include  (i)  a  specific\nimplementation strategy, (ii) the expected composition of the loan portfolio over the next five\nyears, and (iii) details on the financing of asset growth from a diverse range of debt and\nequity sources.\nC. Participation in the Project\n4. RDB will participate in the Project as an Executing Agency to manage the credit line\nand  provide  support for  the  participating  licensed  financial  institutions  (LFIs),  including\nmicrofinance institutions. It will act as a wholesale banking institution drawing down funds\nreceived from the Government and onlending these funds to LFIs. RDB will remain viable\nand maintain an adequate net worth through retained earnings and capital injections. Over\nthe project period, RDB will provide lines of credit for LFIs\u2019 operations and for fixed asset\npurchases of the participating LFIs. RDB is expected to achieve a loan portfolio of about $21\nmillion after loan loss provisions under the Project by 2005, including loans provided prior to\ninception  of  the  Project.  The  Project  will  support  the  purchase  of  service  vehicles,\n                                               \n1 The Council of Ministers approved on 28 December 1998 the policy for rural finance in Cambodia.", "Appendix 9, page 2\nequipment, and computer software. The onlending interest rate of RDB to LFIs is based on\nreceiving funds from the Government at no less than the rate of ADB\u2019s ordinary capital\nresources in riel and US dollars. To this cost of funds, RDB will add a total interest spread\ninitially up to 4 percent for its administrative expenses and the anticipated LFI institutional\nrisk. The institutional risk of LFIs is critical to loan pricing. In this respect, RDB will liaise\nclosely  with  NBC  in  evaluating  LFI  performance  and  their  compliance  with  the  NBC\nregulations. It may be feasible to reduce the onlending rate to better-performing LFIs and\nincrease the rate for poorer-performing ones.\n5. According to the financial projections for RDB (Table A9), RDB will become profitable\nduring 2000 and will remain profitable in each year of operation, reaching a net profit after\ntax of $684,835 in 2005. The annual return on equity will reach 9.68 percent by 2005. The\ninterest coverage ratio is maintained at a safe level and, is never below a minimum of 1.70\npercent, and the capital adequacy ratio is maintained above 30 percent. Over the project\nperiod,  the  administrative  cost  of  lending  steadily  declines from  10.9  percent  of  loans\noutstanding in 2001 to1.8 percent in 2005.\n6. The financial performance and ratios indicate that RDB can be a viable financial\ninstitution as a wholesale bank. Particular attention needs to be given to the pricing of loans\nbased on weighted costs of funds and expected loan losses. This will be crucial as RDB is\nlikely to have a range in sources of funds from various external funding agencies, and will\nface different levels of risk among segments of its loan portfolio. Administrative expenses\nwill also require a regular review to ensure they meet the banking standards. In particular,\nRDB should not increase its present levels of staffing and administrative expenses until an\nadequate return on equity is achieved. RDB should aim to achieve a return on equity that is\nat least 5.0 percent above the rate of inflation. The operational performance of RDB as the\nExecuting Agency needs to be reassessed during a comprehensive midterm review of the\nProject. Based on the outcome of the review, remedial measures, if necessary, will be taken\nto improve project implementation.", "   Appendix 9, page 3\nTable A9:  Rural Development Bank Financial Projection:  2000 - 2005 \n ( $, as of 31 December)\n \n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005\n A.

Overall Organization\n1. The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) is an autonomous central bank as the issuer of\nthe local currency, the banker of the Government, and the supervisor of banks. NBC\u2019s board of\ndirectors consists of seven members including the governor, the deputy governor, and a staff\nrepresentative. Members are appointed for four years and are eligible for a further term. The\nboard of directors is responsible for establishing operating policies and issuing decisions,\nregulations, circulars, and other directives. As of the end of 1998, NBC had a total of 1,075\nstaff, including 425 staff working in provincial branches and 87 staff in the Foreign Trade Bank.\nThe number of staff in provincial branches is being reduced by either employing them in the\nhead office or by placing them in commercial banks wherever possible.\n2. The  NBC\u2019s  balance  sheet  for  31  December  1998,  excluding  provincial  branches,\nshowed total assets of KR2,077 billion ($547 million), which is an increase by 51 percent as\ncompared with December 1997. Foreign assets, which include foreign exchange, holding bank\naccounts with foreign banks, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reserve position, and\nspecial drawing rights holdings, comprised 75 percent of its total assets in December 1997 and\n81 percent in December 1998. This increase was due to a large increase in foreign accounts\nwith foreign banks. As regards the IMF reserve position, NBC had a liability of KR224.7 billion\n($59 million) in 1997 and KR253.8 billion ($67 million) in 1998. The total amount of foreign\nliabilities was in both years entirely due to the IMF for the General Reserve Account and the\nenhanced special adjustment facility.\n3. NBC had a loan amount outstanding to the Government of KR211 billion ($56 million) in\n1997 and KR289 billion ($76 million), an increase by 37 percent, and liabilities, held as a\nGovernment deposit, of KR153.5 billion ($40 million) in 1997 and KR106.1 billion ($28 million),\na decrease by 31 percent. Since the beginning of 1998, the monetary policy has shifted toward\nsupport for the Government\u2019s budget deficit since Cambodia was not able to receive any\nassistance from IMF and was mainly concerned about the resolution of political conflicts.\nThese led to a higher inflation and fast depreciation of the exchange rate. During 1998,\nalthough broad money (M2) grew at a rate of 16 percent, currency outside the banking system\nincreased by 43 percent, resulting in soaring inflation.\nB.  Organization of the Bank Supervision Department\n4. Bank supervision is one of the most important activities of NBC. To ensure the well-\nbeing of the banking sector, NBC\u2019s Supervision Department supervises licensed commercial\nbanks to follow the banking laws and accompanying regulations set by NBC. The department\nwas reorganized in December 1999, and now has four divisions for (i) off-site inspection of\ncommercial banks; (ii) on-site inspection of commercial banks; (iii) administration, regulation,\nresearch and licensing of commercial banks; and (iv) supervision and licensing of specialized\nbanks and microfinance institutions (MFIs). The department is headed by a director. Until the\nrecent reorganization, the department had a separate office, called the Supervision Office for\nDecentralized Banking System, which was established by an agreement between the French\nAgency for Development and the Ministry of Economy and Finance of the Government in\nNovember  1997.  This  office,  which  received  financial  and  technical  support  from  French\nAgency for Development to assist four nongovernment organizations, has been integrated into", "Appendix 10, page 2\nthe new division for the supervision and licensing of specialized banks and MFIs. At present,\nNBC monitors the financial activities of major nongovernment organizations, which submit\nquarterly reports on a voluntary basis.\n5. The Supervision Department has 38 staff, including 10 staff recently assigned to the\non-site inspection division for commercial banks. These staff members received brief training\non on-site  inspection  activities.  There  are  18  staff  working  in  six  sections  of  the  off-site\ninspection division for commercial banks. The supervision and licensing division for specialized\nbanks and MFIs will conduct off-site and on-site inspection of these institutions.\nC. Supervision of Commercial Banks\n6. The six sections of the off-site inspection division supervise 31 operating commercial\nbanks. Each section of three staff is responsible for about five commercial banks. Supervision\nis done by analyzing weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual reports of banks. On a 28-day\nbasis, banks are required to provide daily balances of riel and foreign liabilities through their\nrequired reserve reports to show compliance with the daily average required balance. The\npresent reserve requirement is fixed at 8 percent of total liabilities. Banks are penalized by 0.1\npercent per month of the refinancing rate on the deficit amount if they fail to comply with\nreserve requirements.\n7. Monthly reports required for banks include information on the statements of assets and\nliabilities, income and expenditures, credit granted by type of business and customer, total\ndeposits classified by type of customer, foreign exchange position, and calculation of net\nworth. Banks also submit quarterly reports on bad and doubtful debts, capital adequacy ratio,\nand organization and administration. Annual reports and audited financial statements of banks\nare also submitted to NBC. Action is taken if banks are found to fail to comply with NBC\nregulations.\n8. There  is  still  substantial  room  for  improving  the  effectiveness  of  NBC\u2019s  bank\nsupervision.  Details  on  the  liquidity  positions  of  banks,  including  their  liquid  assets  and\nliabilities in the country and abroad, short-term liabilities with local and foreign banks, local and\nforeign demand deposits, and collateral covering outstanding loans, will be required for more\naccurate analysis. On-site supervision of commercial banks has been carried out by external\nauditors at the request of NBC if there are suspicions about bank reports. NBC urgently needs\nto activate its in-house function for regular on-site supervision for the verification of reports\nsubmitted by banks.\nD. MFI Supervision under the Project\n1. Organization and Staffing\n9. Under the new law on banking and financial institutions, MFIs are allowed to carry out\nfinancial transactions, including savings mobilization from the public, under NBC\u2019s supervision.\nSupervision of MFIs requires the same approach and strictness as for commercial banks and\nneeds to be under a specialized division for MFI supervision at NBC\u2019s Bank Supervision\nDepartment. MFIs will need to be licensed by the department prior to being eligible to obtain\ndeposits from the public. MFIs will have to conform to NBC\u2019s requirements with respect to their\ncapital adequacy ratios and minimum reserves with NBC, which are different from those for", "Appendix 10, page 3\ncommercial banks. MFIs will not be allowed to provide payment services through checking\naccounts or forward dealings in foreign currencies. The assessment of MFIs\u2019 financial positions\nwill require a specialized approach in view of their financial structure, performance, experience,\nand areas of operation. Regular on-site inspection of MFIs, including their branch offices, will\nbe essential for verifying documents NBC receives from MFIs for assessment and reporting.\n10. Proper scheduling of on-site inspection should be done annually. About 50 days are\nrequired for on-site inspection during the first year and 60 days in the second year, gradually\nincreasing to 90 days by the fifth year. On-site inspection will focus on the quality of the loan\nportfolio, including loan documentation such as loan agreements and security obtained, and\nthe quality of cash and deposit management.\n2. Monitoring and Supervision\n11. MFIs may be required to submit monthly reports to NBC on (i) loans outstanding, (ii)\nsavings and deposit balances, (iii) liquidity balances in cash and deposits with NBC and\nlicensed commercial banks, (iv) income and expenses statements, (v) percentage of liquidity\nreserves in relation to savings and deposits, and (vi) statements of overdue loans classified up\nto 30 days, from 31-60 days, 61-180 days, and beyond 180 days outstanding. Quarterly\nreporting may include additional information on (i) management accounts, (ii) the number of\nborrowers  and  depositors,  (iii)  the  calculation  and  evaluation  of  the  net  worth,  (iv)  the\nstatement of investments in fixed assets and in equity participation, and (v) capital adequacy\nand liquidity ratios as prescribed by NBC. Annual reporting will be accompanied by audited\nfinancial statements. The financial statements of MFIs need to be audited by an independent\nauditor approved by NBC.\n12. NBC  will  process  all  reports  received  from  licensed  MFIs.  A  diary  system  will  be\ninstalled to monitor the timeliness of reports. For each MFI, a card will be prepared to record\nkey details such as  the  address,  contact  person,  legal  form,  main  shareholders,  general\nmanager, and auditor. This card will be filed in a central registry and will be available to\nauthorized persons only. The cash balances and the overall liquidity position of each MFI will\nbe reviewed on a monthly basis. Monthly reports together with financial statements from MFIs\nshould reach the supervision and licensing division not later than 15th of each month following\nthe  month  under  review.  Analysis  of  current  assets  and  liabilities  by  item,  amount,  and\ncurrency will be required to ensure the maintenance of adequate liquidity. Sudden changes\nmay be a sign of financial deterioration and necessitate NBC\u2019s dialogue with the concerned\nMFI for remedial actions to be taken.\n13. Regular meetings need to be organized within NBC\u2019s Bank Supervision Department to\nreview the progress of MFI development. Based on the performance and financial positions of\nMFIs, NBC should flexibly consider amendments of MFI regulations or new regulations if\nnecessary to promote sound development of MFIs.", "Appendix 11, page 1\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION\nA.  Introduction\n1. The initial environmental examination (IEE) of the Project was conducted over a six-\nweek  period  from  November  1998  to  December  1998.  The  IEE  covers  a  range  of\nsubprojects that are expected to be financed under the Project, including rice production,\nsmall-scale irrigation, pig raising, palm sugar production, rice milling, weaving, brick and tile\nmaking, and trading.\nB.  Description of the Environment\n2. The Cambodian landscape features (i) the floodplain of the Mekong River and the\nassociated basin of the Tonle Sap draining to the Mekong delta in the southeast, (ii) the\nCardamon and Dangrek mountains to the southwest and northwest, and (iii) the plateau\nbordering the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Viet Nam in the northeast. A narrow\ncoastal belt lies beyond the Cardamon Mountains. The climate is monsoonal, with the wet\nseason from May to November. Marked variation is present from year to year in the onset,\nintensity, and duration of the rains. Over 75 percent of the population live in the Mekong\nBasin and the Tonle Sap Plain, which represent a very large diversity of agro-ecological\nconditions.\n3. Cambodian farms are predominantly subsistence-oriented in rice cultivation. Soils\ntend  to  be  of  low  fertility  and  deficient  in  nitrogen,  phosphorous,  and  micronutrients.\nProductivity is maintained in many areas by the deposition of silt by annual floods. Some 80\npercent of rice cultivation is rainfed, and resulting in a high variety of rice yields and thus\nhigh risks to farming. Only 17 percent of the rice-growing areas are currently under any form\nof water management, and the use of fertilizers and pest control technology is limited.\nOpportunities for production increases through the use of these two chemical inputs are\nsignificant, and will have environmental implications.\n4. The rate of forest coverage in Cambodia is estimated up to 65 percent, including\nevergreen lowland and mountainous, semi-evergreen, and deciduous communities. The\nforests provide habitat to a great wealth of animal biodiversity, including wild cats, primates,\nbears,  elephants,  pangolins,  and  about  400  bird  species.  Rapid  and  poorly  managed\ncommercial logging degrades these forests at an unsustainable rate. Moreover, a large\nnumber  of  rural  people  depend  on  materials  gathered  from  common  areas  for  their\nnutritional well-being. Exploitation of forest species is extensive and often uncontrolled.\nDeforestation is a major contributor to flood disasters, and possibly also to changes in\nrainfall patterns.\nC.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n5. Although environmental impacts of many subprojects in the rural area are expected\nto be insignificant, the aggregate impacts of all may become apparent, especially when the\nuse  of  toxic  pesticides  is  increased,  the  extraction  of  trees  or  quarried  material  is\naccelerated, and/or the hydrological regime is modified. The examples of possible impacts\nof subprojects and mitigative measures are discussed in Table A11. Societal means for\nensuring  a  positive  balance  in  such  circumstances  include  (i)  appropriate  institutional\nmechanisms for decision making, (ii) effective tools for sound technical analysis, and (iii)\ntransparent  and  equitable  procedures  for  monitoring  and  enforcement.  An  adequate\nregulatory  framework  to  ensure  these  is  being  formulated.  The  Project  provides  an", "Appendix 11, page 2\nopportunity  to  contribute  to  these  developments  through  increased  awareness  among\ncommunities and civil institutions in the rural area.\n6. The capacity building for environmental management is necessary for line ministries\nand local institutions in Cambodia to conduct effective planning and monitoring. Without\nplacing undue burdens on the microfinance institutions (MFIs), the Project will ensure that (i)\nMFI officers are given at least an initial introduction to the potential environmental impacts of\ntheir portfolios, (ii) MFI officers will have access to the technical support programs of the\nGovernment  and  nongovernment  organizations  for  sustainable  natural  resource\nmanagement, and  (iii)  the  monitoring  activities  under  the  Project  will  contribute  useful\ninformation to the country\u2019s overall environmental management efforts by properly compiling\nprogress and impact reports.\nD.  Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program\n1. Institutional and Legal Framework\n7. The Ministry of Environment, which was established in November 1993, has major\nresponsibility for environmental management. Other ministries relevant in the area are the\nMinistry of Health, the Ministry of Tourism, the Ministry of Public Works and Transport, and\nthe Council for the Development of Cambodia. The Government is making efforts to develop\nappropriate  coordination  among  these  ministries  in  environmental  management,  as\nmandated in the five-year plan.1 Some collaboration is beginning to emerge, both at the\nworking level among officials and at senior levels among members of the Environmental\nSteering Committee of the Government. However, it will take some years before an effective\nsystem  for  environmental  management  becomes  operational,  given  the  prevailing\ninstitutional and resource constraints. The Project will facilitate the growth of the system\nthrough encouraging environmental awareness on the part of MFIs.\n8. The  law  on  environmental  protection  and  natural  resource  management,  which\nspecifies  the  Ministry  of  Environment's  authority,  public  participation  procedures  in\nenvironmental protection, and penalties for pollution and related offences, was enacted in\n1996.  Specific  details  for  implementation  are  left  to  subordinate  regulations  such  as\nsubdecrees and circulars, which cover environmental impact assessment, water pollution\ncontrol, solid waste management, protected area management, and control over the use of\ninsecticides. Article 6 of the law requires that environmental impact assessments (EIA) be\ndone for all investment projects that require Government approval, subject to criteria and\nprocedures to be established by a subdecree pursuant to the law. A draft subdecree for the\nEIA process was prepared with technical support from the Asian Development Bank 2 and\nUnited Nations Development Programme.3\n2. EIA Process\n9. Details on how EIA and other requirements  are  applied for  investment  projects\nremain unspecified in Cambodia since the relevant regulations are not in place. An EIA will\nbe required for any project that needs to be approved by a Government institution by a\nconstruction  permit,  operating  license,  or  concession  agreement.  The  Government  will\ndetermine  the  level  of  environmental  review  required  for  each  project  based  on  each\n                                               \n1 Royal Government of Cambodia. 1997.

The information required in this application is of the\nsame kind but less comprehensive than that of an IEE, amounting to a brief study. For a\nproposal judged likely to have little or no environmental impact, the application document\nwill be sufficient for fulfilling requirements under the law. Projects that are considered to\nhave significant environmental impacts will be required to submit their IEE results together\nwith their applications. Some will then be judged to require a full-scale EIA before approval\nis  granted.  Most  subprojects  to  be  financed  under  the  Project  are  very  small-scale\nenterprises, and will not require approval from a Government institution for commencement.\nEven if some subprojects need to be reviewed by the Government, the screening can be\ndone under summary procedures based on the application documents.\n3. Environmental Management Process\n10. The project management unit will have  an officer  responsible for environmental\nconcerns under the Project. The officer will commission the work of designing environmental\ntraining modules for MFI managers, develop a data base for natural resource management\nprograms, facilitate working relations between the project management unit and MFIs, and\norganize environmental monitoring activities relating to the Project.\nE.  Conclusion and Recommendations\n11. Cambodia\u2019s  capacity  to  manage  the  environmental  impacts  of  development  is\nbeginning  to  emerge,  both  in  terms  of  the  legal  framework  for  regulation  and  skilled\npersonnel capable of managing the environmental assessment and monitoring. Appropriate\nenvironmental management of larger scale industrial projects will largely occupy this still\nlimited capacity for the next several years. For the majority of the rural population, the\ndevelopment of microenterprises is critical for the reduction of poverty, yet these enterprises\ncould pose a threat to the resource base that people depend on for their food security. By\nbringing at least a minimum of environmental consideration and technical expertise into the\nplanning process and at the level of investment decision making, the Project will contribute\nto the promotion of sustainable development paths in the rural area. In addition to the\nenvironmental management process to be institutionalized into the project management\nunit, the adoption of mitigative measures listed in Table A11 is recommended under the\nProject.\nTable A11: Summary of Environmental Impacts of Microenterprises\nSubprojects Anticipated Impacts and Mitigation Measuresa\n1.

Introduction\n1. A  social  assessment  was  carried  out  during  the  preparation  of  the  Project  to\nestablish an understanding of the intended beneficiaries. The social assessment specifically\naimed at (i) identifying the client group of the Project; (ii) examining the socioeconomic\ncircumstances of the client group, including the poor, the near-poor, the better-off, and\nwomen;  (iii)  analyzing  the  needs,  demands,  and  absorptive  capacity  of  the  clientele\nidentified for rural financial services, including perceptions regarding access to credit and\nresponsibilities involved; and (iv) examining social development concerns relevant to the\nProject. The field work was carried out for three weeks in October 1998 and November 1998\nin four provinces, which were selected from the plain, Tonle Sap Lake, and plateau regions\nof the country. The four provinces are Kompong Cham, Prey Veng, Banteay Meanchey, and\nKompong Speu. Kompong Speu and Prey Veng Provinces are considered to be poorer\namong the four. The coastal region was not selected since it is characterized differently as a\nprovince mainly for tourist enterprises. These four provinces are considered representative\nof most of Cambodia's rural population. The survey was based on a sample of 348 rural\nhouseholds taken at random from areas where nongovernment organizations (NGOs) are\nactive in credit and savings schemes. Preliminary findings were presented and discussed at\na stakeholder workshop involving NGOs on 24 November 1998. The results of the social\nassessment are summarized in Table A12.\nB. Social Assessment\n1.  Rural Poverty\n2. The clientele of the Project will be the people living in provincial areas outside\nPhnom Penh, including provincial towns. Outside towns, rural people live in agricultural\nareas and along waterways. The rural population covered under the social assessment was\nmarked by a high incidence of poverty or near-poverty. They represent a significant portion\nof the subgroups in the client group of the Project. Household sizes in the surveyed area\nranged from 2 to 15 persons, with an average of 6, which is higher than the national average\nof 5.2. The gender ratio in the households was 48 percent male and 52 percent female,\nroughly reflecting the country\u2019s situation. Households  surveyed were mainly headed by\nmales with 8 percent of the total households surveyed headed by females, contrasting with\na national average of 25 percent. Most households are centered on nuclear families, with\nfew extended families. The dominant ethnicity in the surveyed area  is  Cambodian  (95\npercent of the total households surveyed). Cham or Muslim Cambodian is the next largest\nethnic  group  (4  percent).  Other  ethnic  groups  include  indigenous  people,  Thai,  and\nCambodians of Chinese ethnic origin.\n3. Households and villages are the main bases for social organization. Temporary\ngroups on the bases of kin, friends, and neighbors often form to deal with circumstances\nsuch as labor shortages and emergencies, and for important social events. Political and\nadministrative units at the village level are village development committees, appointed by\nGovernment authorities, but comprising community members  most often  recognized  as\nauthority  figures.  Government  hospitals  are  operated  at  provincial  and  district  levels.\nCommune health offices exist at the village level, and private clinics operate. The cost of\nhealth care limits the access of the rural poor to health services, and illnesses and accidents\ncan result in major financial burdens, forcing the sale of assets such as land and livestock to\ngenerate funds.", "Appendix 12, page 2\n4. Ninety-one percent of the population is literate to some degree. Illiteracy is higher\namong poorer households, and higher among females (15 percent) than males (5 percent).\nForty percent of the surveyed respondents reported a primary school education, 28 percent\na high school education, and 1 percent a higher level of education. Households value\neducation for their children and save for school fees, though this is a major burden on poor\nhouseholds.\n5. Main roads are generally in poor condition. Access rural roads are also poor or more\ndeteriorated. A very limited telephone system exists only in towns. Where an electricity\nsupply exists, radio and television are becoming an increasingly important communication\nmedia, being owned by well-off families in the villages. Postal systems are often inadequate.\nPublic bus and motorcycle taxis are the main modes of personal transportation, and trucks\nfor hire are available for transportation of goods. Bicycles and ox- or horse-drawn carts also\nremain important modes of transportation for most rural households. Wood, obtained from\npublic forests, is the main source of energy for cooking and other purposes. Scarcity of\nwood is an increasingly serious problem. A regular electricity supply exists only in towns.\nSome 32 percent of households rely on storage batteries for basic electricity. Five percent\nown a  generator,  which  is  a highly  valued asset  in  villages.  Poor  households  without\nelectricity rely on kerosene as a source of lighting.\n6. Major  economic  assets  include  land,  buildings,  gold,  livestock,  agricultural\nequipment, and items such as motorcycles, generators, and televisions. Such assets often\nserve as collateral for individual loans. There are few landless persons in the surveyed area.\nFifty one percent of total households had less than 0.5 hectares, which accommodate\nhouses  as  well  as  some  land  for  agriculture.  Most  households  own  some  livestock.\nHousehold livestock raising is a significant source of secondary household income. The\ndominant  livelihood  is  agriculture,  predominantly  rice  farming.  Fifty-seven  percent  of\nrespondents are engaged in rice cultivation. Corn, sweet potatoes, cassava, and other\nvegetables are grown as market crops, but generally on a small scale. Many households are\nengaged  in a  wide  range  of  nonfarming  activities.  Such  activities  include  a  variety  of\nenterprises, trading, provision of services, and labor. Most households have more than one\nsource of income for their subsistence.\n7. It is difficult to form a precise estimation of poverty incidence for the surveyed area.\nA few studies have assessed the poverty situation in Cambodia. United Nations Children's\nFund estimates that the poor account for about 85 percent of the population in Cambodia.\nAnother study,1 reported 40 percent of rural households below the official poverty line of a\nper capita income of KR1,210 ($0.32) per day. Considering an income of less than KR1,210\nper day and the ownership of less than 0.5 ha of agricultural land2 as indicators for rural\npoverty,  about  65  percent  of  the  surveyed  households  may  be  classified  as  poor\nhouseholds.\n8. Poor  households  in  rural  Cambodia  are  heavily  handicapped  in  terms  of  (i)\nownership of assets, (ii) access to basic social services, and (iii) access to financial services.\nThey are characterized by the inability to produce a year-round food supply (six months\naverage of food shortage), small and fragmented landholdings, small or no savings to cover\nemergency needs such as illness, limited or lack of access to health care, lack of access to\nminimum sanitary facilities, and the need for borrowing to support and expand income-\n                                               \n1 A Poverty Profile of Cambodia \u2013 1997, the Ministry of Planning, financed by UNDP, the World Bank, and SIDA.\n2  Ownership of 0.5 ha of agricultural land is an informal but accepted indicator of poverty in the rural area.", "Appendix 12, page 3\ngenerating activities. Generally, there is a large gap between a small number of rich people\nand people belonging to the poor and the near-poor groups, who constitute the majority of\nrural population. Some of wealthy people become sources of informal credit for poorer\nhouseholds in the rural area. Poor people are usually engaged in wage labor and other off-\nfarm employment in addition to agriculture as additional sources of cash income, and need\nto work harder to avoid a cycle of heavy debt burden.\n2. Role of Women\n9. In Cambodia, women have greater social equality with men than is the case on some\nother Asian countries. Law and practice allow both sons and daughters to inherit property.\nThe legal status and rights of women are protected under the Cambodian constitution. At\nthe household level, women are active and equal participants in household management\nand decision making, including decisions related to financial issues. Women and men work\ntogether in the rural areas, although responsibilities of women include household and family-\nrelated work in addition to farm work or other income-generating activities. Some social\nrestrictions affecting the mobility of women in terms of appearance and transportation are\napparent in the Cambodian society.\n10. Women are full partners in traditional rice agriculture. Women are engaged more in\nactivities  such  as  transplanting  seedlings  from  seedbeds.  Both  men  and  women  are\ninvolved in various degrees in the tasks of harvesting, transporting, and threshing. Many\nother farm activities are shared, such as carrying water and wood, and tending to livestock.\nWomen tend to be involved in other on-farm or off-farm income-generating activities. Rural\nwomen are more active and more skillful in trading and marketing than men, and generally\nare better managers of household savings and credit. Women most often are the direct\nborrowers when credit is arranged, whether from an informal lender or a credit operator such\nas an NGO. However, there is usually a shared decision-making and agreement between a\nwife and a husband before taking a loan and in enterprise management.\n3. Demand for Credit and Savings\n11. The social assessment indicated that 34 percent of respondents actually received\nloans from NGOs, and 66 percent borrowed from individual moneylenders. Credit obtained\nwas mainly for production purposes. For emergency needs, borrowing was mainly from\ninformal  sources.  Loan  size  varies,  with  small  loans  being  mainly  for  agricultural  and\nlivestock purposes, and medium- and large-sized loans for capital to support enterprises or\ntrading activities. Nearly all households showed interest in borrowing to support income-\ngenerating  activities,  and  most  households  identified  loan  terms  and  conditions  and\nrepayment arrangements as key factors in their decision making for borrowing. About 80\npercent of the respondents in social assessment indicated their preference for NGOs as the\nsource of credit funds. While the decision to borrow is a shared household decision, women\nrespondents  most  often  expressed  greater  interest  in  borrowing.  It  is  noted  that  rural\nhouseholds in  Cambodia  are  very  cautious  in financial  transactions.  NGOs also  adopt\nprudent practices in their credit schemes by initiating them with a very small amount and\nincreasing the amount, if considered feasible, through a few cycles.\n12. With respect to savings, the social assessment results show the general distrust in or\nlack of access to commercial banks. About 95 percent of the surveyed rural households\nindicated their preference for saving in the form of cash, gold, or other assets because of the\nconvenience of and trust in such form of traditional savings. Compulsory savings schemes\ncurrently practiced by some NGOs are not preferred due to (i) the distance to NGO offices;", "Appendix 12, page 4\n(ii) the very small amount of saving, usually equivalent to one quarter of the monthly interest\npayment  for  NGO  loans;  and  (iii)  unclear  systems  for  withdrawal  and  ownership  of\naccumulated savings.  About  one  third  of  the  surveyed  households  indicated  that  they\nregularly saved money, another one third saved irregularly, and the remaining households\ndid not have surplus money to save. Rural people usually require savings facilities for\nemergency purposes, which are commonly met through borrowing from moneylenders. The\nsocial assessment clearly showed the strong demand among rural households for reliable\nsavings facilities that are safe, convenient, and attractive.\nC. Some Field Observations\n13. Interesting cases of microcredit were noted during the preparation of the Project.\nPeople interviewed indicated their general satisfaction with the rules and procedures of\nNGOs\u2019 credit operations. People who borrowed from moneylenders were dissatisfied and\nuniformly stated preference for NGOs. Subsequent to their successful experience in the first\nborrowing, most beneficiaries request for the second cycle of borrowing funds from NGOs.\n14. One example is a poor woman in Takeo Town Market, who was engaged in cloth\ntrading. She received a credit of KR75,000 ($20) from the Association of Cambodian Local\nEconomic Development Agencies (ACLEDA). She regularly buys a small amount of cloth\nfrom a wholesaler in Phnom Penh once or twice a month depending upon the level of the\nprevious sales. Generally, the wholesaler allows her to buy on credit, and she repays during\nher next purchase. Before ACLEDA operated in her area, she made loans from her relatives\nor moneylenders.  The  interest  charged by  moneylenders  was KR1,000 per  month per\nKR10,000  ($2.63) borrowed, with repayments daily or weekly. The trader indicated that she\nwould  not  borrow  money  from  moneylenders  in  future  as  some  moneylenders  gave\ninformation about her financial transactions to other people in the village. She prefers the\nACLEDA scheme partly because of its businesslike procedures and confidentiality; details of\nher transactions are shared only with her group members (four other women).\n15. The trader was introduced to the ACLEDA scheme during a meeting organized by\nACLEDA with local traders in the market. All details were explained to them, and those who\nwere interested to take loans applied for registration, and took a short training program. For\nsmall loans, a group of five members is formed,  while individual loans require land or house\ntitles  as  collateral.  Her  trading  budget  and  business  management  were  assessed  by\nACLEDA to make sure that she could manage funds properly and make repayments in a\ntimely manner. She also indicated that ACLEDA provided loans to a large number of small\nlocal traders in the market.\nD. Conclusion\n16. The survey and social assessment results indicate a strong demand for reliable\ncredit and savings facilities in the rural area. Although the level of education among rural\nhouseholds is not high, they generally have long experience in financial transactions with\nindividual moneylenders and NGOs, and in savings in the form of cash, both in local and\nforeign currencies, or various forms of other assets.

Financial and economic analyses were carried out for a range of subprojects based\non  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  loan  portfolios  of  major  nongovernment  organizations\n(NGOs) in Cambodia. The sample should be considered as indicative as other activities may\nbe financed under the Project. The analyses were undertaken to ensure that subprojects\nconsidered most likely to be financed under the Project could generate sufficient income to\nrepay their loans and generate surplus, and that they were in the national interest.\n2. An economic analysis of the overall project was not done because the process for a\nmicrofinance  project  precludes  accurate  identification  of  all  types  and  numbers  of\nsubprojects  to  be  financed  or  assessment  until  the  Project  is  being  implemented.\nNonetheless, the indicative subprojects were assessed to indicate the overall viability of the\nProject from the national perspective.\nA. Financial Analysis\n1. Indicative Subprojects\n3. Financial internal rates of return (FIRR) were estimated for subprojects with multiyear\ninvestments and returns. Some subprojects extend over only two years with the capital\ninvestment at the end of one year and the returns in the following year. For agricultural crop\nsubprojects of a one-year duration, in particular rice inputs and trading, FIRRs could not be\nestimated. Agriculture-related activities include rice inputs for both wet season rice and dry\nseason irrigated rice production, small-scale irrigation, and pig raising. Pond fisheries were\nnot included as the NGOs determined that uncertain production levels and no guarantee of\nsales make them nonbankable. Palm sugar production, rice milling, silk weaving, and brick\nmaking  represent  manufacturing  enterprises.  Retail  trading,  frequently  by  women  to\nsupplement other household incomes, covers a broad range of goods, including cakes,\nagricultural produce, bicycle parts, soft drinks, clothing, and various consumer goods with\ndaily or weekly turnover cycles and a profit margin for each cycle of 5-15 percent. Based on\nthe current experience of NGOs, such subprojects are expected to account for about 90\npercent of loans provided under the Project.\n2.  Assumptions\n4. Prices  used  were  those  prevailing  during  December  1998  to  January  1999.\nContinuity in the current Government policies and general inflation relating to input and\noutput prices are not expected to have a significant impact on relative prices. Physical input\nand output coefficients are based on data that were collected from households that have\nalready received loans from NGOs and are thus considered to be indicative of the situation\nin the rural area. Unpaid family labor has been considered to incur no cost for the initial\nfinancial analysis, and returns to labor were estimated. Subsequently, the analysis has been\nrepeated with family labor calculated at the prevailing wage rate of about KR4,000 ($1) per\nday near provincial towns to present the financially most conservative treatment of labor.\nThe expected life of each subproject is based on the social assessment rather than an\nassessment of what could be achieved so that the analysis will reflect the actual situation\nmore accurately.", "Appendix 13, page 2\n3. Financial Rates of Return\n5. FIRRs for individual subprojects range from 23 percent for a small-scale rice milling\nto 91 percent for silk weaving (Table A13.1). The financial net present values for single-year\nactivities, including rice inputs and trading, show positive results. There is clearly a wide\nrange of investment opportunities for individual entrepreneurs, and specific demands for\ncredit will depend largely on the experience and desires of these entrepreneurs. At the lower\nend of the spectrum are production loans for rice cropping, trading, palm sugar production,\nand pig raising requiring investments of $300 or less. Such loans are expected to be most\ncommon as they  support the  types  of  activities  with  which  rural  households  are  most\nfamiliar. For small-scale irrigation, silk weaving, rice milling, and brick making, loans of $300\nor more will be required. A large number of microenterprises can be undertaken by rural\nhouseholds  without  significant  business  experience.  Of  these  activities,  silk  weaving\nappears to be the most attractive, providing a good return for households with sufficient\nlabor. All of these activities appear to be financially viable and to have returns in excess of\nthe real interest rates, based on a nominal interest rate of 36 percent per annum and an\ninflation rate of 13 percent per annum.  Nevertheless, returns could be greatly improved with\nproper attention to technology, minimizing costs, and improved marketing.\n6. Based on  the  subproject budgets,  incremental  costs,  revenue, and employment\ngeneration are summarized in Table A13.2. Subprojects for food processing and other light\nmanufacturing undertakings, including palm sugar production, small-scale rice milling, silk\nweaving,  and  brick  making  are  expected  to  increase  employment  opportunities.  Brick\nmaking is particularly heavily dependent on nearby unskilled labor. These subprojects are\nexpected to generate an average of about 180 person-days per loan for a year. Medium\nemployment subprojects include pig raising, and trading, which would create about 80-100\nperson-days per loan. Pig raising and trading are the most common activities among NGO\nsubborrowers. The medium employment subprojects are expected to account for about 60\npercent of loans. Subprojects with low employment generation include rice production and\nsmall-scale irrigation, which would generate an average of about 20 person-days per loan\nand are expected to account for about 20 percent of loans. Assuming this composition of\ntypes of indicative subprojects, the Project will provide the equivalent of about 66,000 jobs.\nB. Economic Analysis\n7. Economic analysis was undertaken for the same subprojects as in the financial\nanalysis and for the same time spans. Economic prices for the main traded inputs and\noutputs (predominantly rice and fertilizer) were based on the latest World Bank commodity\nprice projections and were adjusted to constant 1998 values using the standard index. The\naverage price of rice was estimated based on the existing situation of export to Viet Nam\nand Thailand during months of surplus and imports from those areas during months of\ndeficit. Fertilizer prices were estimated at import parity reflecting the likely ongoing need for\nCambodia to import fertilizer. Border prices were adjusted to farm-gate prices by allowing for\nthe  economic  values  of  transport,  processing,  and  marketing.  For  livestock  and\nmanufactured goods, which all tend to be nontraded commodities, the market price was\nadjusted  by  a  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.9,  and  the  financial  prices  of  all  other\nnontraded inputs were also adjusted by a standard conversion factor of 0.9 in accordance\nwith the procedures used by the Asian Development Bank in recent studies for Cambodia.\nThe economic cost of labor was estimated using an appropriately defined shadow wage rate", "Appendix 13, page 3\nfor  employees  and  potential  beneficiaries  in  the  rural  area.  Given  the  wide  range  of\nsubprojects and the differing capabilities of potential subborrowers, a single shadow wage\nrate  did  not  appear  appropriate.  Consequently,  two  rates  (0.95  and  0.75)  were  used\nreflecting the differing alternative opportunities for entrepreneurial family labor and general\nworkers, respectively.\n8. Economic internal rates of return could not be estimated for the two rice production\nactivities and trading as these represented single-year activities. However, the economic net\npresent values show they are beneficial from the viewpoint of the national interest. The\neconomic internal rates of return of the remaining enterprises also show their economic\nviability (Table A13.1). Those of small-scale processing and manufacturing range from 24\npercent to 62 percent, showing high economic viability.\nC. Nonquantifiable Benefits\n9. A  substantial  level  of  nonquantifiable  benefits  will  accrue  from  the  Project.\nAppropriate  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks  will  be  established  for  rural  finance.\nSubborrowers will benefit from skill development and environmental awareness activities,\nwhich will be beneficial in the long term. Licensed financial institutions (LFI) are expected to\nimprove their management skills, to gain a greater appreciation of environmental issues and\nhow they can be addressed through credit programs, and to achieve financial sustainability.\nThis will enable them to expand their services in a profitable and sustainable manner.\nFurthermore, they will be able to apply the skills obtained to all of their clients, as well as\nfuture clients, many of whom will not be direct beneficiaries of the Project. Similarly, the\ninstitutional  strengthening  of  the  Rural  Development  Bank  in  banking  and  financial\nmanagement and the National Bank of Cambodia in the supervision of financial institutions\nwill create bodies able to manage microfinance activities efficiently and in a sustainable\nmanner.\nD. Risks and Sensitivity Analysis\n10. The  main  project  risks  from  the  subborrowers\u2019  perspectives  are  that  individual\nsubprojects will cost more to implement than expected or will produce lower than expected\nnet benefits. Risks of a 10 percent increase in investment costs and a 10 percent decrease\nin net benefits have been assessed separately for each indicative subproject with multiyear\ninvestments and returns. The results show considerable variations between subprojects\n(Table A13.3). From a financial perspective, pig raising, small-scale rice milling, and palm\nsugar production are relatively more sensitive to changes in investment  costs  and  net\nbenefits. From an economic perspective, pig raising and palm sugar production are the most\nsensitive ones. Other enterprises appear sufficiently robust.\n11. The major risk for LFIs would be for the Government to limit interest rates on their\nlending. This would, eventually, result in a decrease in very small loans due to difficulties in\ncost recovery. The Government has a free interest rate policy, which needs to be retained.\nSimilarly, the Government should not impose high cost barriers to the opening of provincial\nand district branches. Changes in other financial variables such as loan loss and cost of\nfunds can be accommodated by LFIs through sound management, accurate and prompt\nfinancial reporting, and flexibility in their pricing of products.", "Appendix 13, page 4\nTable  A13.1:  Summary Results of Financial and Economic Analyses\nFIRR FNPV at 12% FIRR (%) with EIRR ENPV at 12%\nSubproject (%) (KR thousand) Hired Labora (%) (KR thousand)\nFertilizer for Rice (wet season) 0            45 0 0             63\nFertilizer for Rice (dry season, irrigated) 0          105 0 0           145\nSmall-Scale Irrigation 29          564            13        4 6        1,163\nPig Raising 54          843            12        1 3             18\nTrading 0          618 0 0           783\nPalm Sugar Production 60          607 0        2 4           128\nSmall-Scale Rice Milling 23          667 -8         29        1,057\nSilk Weaving 91       2,728            32        6 2        1,468\nBrick Making 30     1 6,235            23        3 4      18,023\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, ENPV = economic net present value, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, FNPV = financial net present value.\na Hired labor assumed at the wage rate of about KR4,000 per day.
