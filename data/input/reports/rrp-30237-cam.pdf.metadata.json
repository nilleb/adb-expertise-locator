NGOs  will  be  licensed  as\nmicrofinance \nregulatory\nframework  of  the  financial  sector,  and  will  provide  full\nfinancial  services  in  the  rural  area,  including  the  savings\nfacilities.  Under  the  Project,  licensed  financial  institutions\n(LFIs) will increase their operational efficiency  in financial\nintermediation  by  improving  their  banking  skills  and\nfinancial management, and through increased competition\namong  LFIs  and  with  other  financial  institutions.  A\nrevolving \nthe  Rural\nDevelopment  Bank \n(RDB),  a  wholesale  banking\ninstitution,  which  will  channel  funds  through  LFIs  to  their\nsubborrowers.  These  funds  will  be  provided  for  small-\nscale  economic  activities  in  agriculture,  agro-processing,\ntrading, \nthe\nsubborrowers,  who  are  mostly  poor  people  in  the  rural\narea.\n\nlivestock,  handicrafts,  and  services  by \n\nfund  will  be  established \n\nin \n\nCategory B\nAn \nundertaken, and a summary IEE is a core appendix.\n\nInitial  Environmental  Examination \n\n(IEE)  was\n\nCambodia is one of the world's lowest-income countries.\nAbout 90 percent of the country\u2019s poor people live in the\nrural  areas.  The  lack  of  access  to  reliable  financial\nservices  is  a  major  constraint  to  the  reduction  of  rural\npoverty  in  Cambodia.  No  formal  financial  services  exist\nin the rural areas. Of the country's 24 provinces, 15 have\nno  commercial  bank  branches.  In  the  provinces  where\nbranches exist, they are located only in primary towns. To\nmake  up  for  this  deficiency,  NGOs  have  been  providing\nrural  households  with  credit  and  savings  services  and\nhave reached about 11 percent of rural households. Most\nrural  households,  however,  have  no  access  to  financial\nservices  and  rely  solely  on  informal  moneylenders  and\nmiddlemen in agricultural trade, who charge high interest\nrates,  often  up  to  10  percent  per  month.  Reliance  on\nthese  moneylenders  makes  it  difficult  for  the  poor  to\nescape from their poverty cycle. Despite the large unmet\ndemand for rural credit, estimated in the range of $50-100\nmillion,  the  expansion  of  NGOs\u2019  rural  credit  is  being\n\n\fiii\n\nconstrained  by  the  limited  sources  of  financing.  Thus,\nthere  is  a  strong  need  for  capital  injection  and  savings\nmobilization  to  provide  increased  access  to  financial\nservices  for  the  rural  poor.  The  Project  supports  the\noperational  strategy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank\n(ADB)  for  steady  reduction  of  poverty  in  Cambodia,  and\nwill contribute to the development of sound regulatory and\ninstitutional \nfor\nsustainable microfinance services in the rural areas.\n\nframeworks,  which  are  essential \n\nThe primary objective of the Project is to develop effective\nfinancial  services  in  the  rural  areas,  which  will  provide\npoor households with better access  to  rural finance. This\nwill  be  based  on  a  private  sector  initiative  of  NGOs  that\nhave  demonstrated  viable  systems  of  credit  delivery  and\nachieved  substantial  outreach.  The  project  scope  will\ninclude  the  provision  of  credit  lines  to  finance  income-\ngenerating  activities  of  the  rural  poor,  support  for  rural\ncredit  and  savings  schemes  of  LFIs,  and  provision  of\nproject  management  support  for  the  RDB,  which  will\nchannel  funds  to  LFIs.  The  Project  will  cover  the\noperations  of  LFIs  throughout  Cambodia,  but  will  be\ninitially  implemented  mainly  in the  northwestern,  eastern,\nand southern regions, where the MFIs are currently active.\n\nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $26.56 million,\nincluding contingencies and taxes. The foreign exchange\ncost is $13.76 million (52 percent) and the local currency\ncost is $12.80 million equivalent (48 percent).\n\nSource\n\nADB\nGovernment\nLFIs\n\nTotal\n\n    Local\n\nForeign\nExchange   Currency\n            ($million)\n\n13.76\n  0.00\n  0.00\n13.76\n\n6.24\n2.72\n3.84\n    12.80\n\n   Total\n   Cost\n\n  20.00\n 2.72\n 3.84\n  26.56\n\nPercent\n\n 75\n 10\n 15\n     100\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nCost Estimates\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nLoan Amount and Terms\n\nRelending Terms\n\nThe  equivalent  in  various  currencies  of  Special  Drawing\nRights 14,872,000 ($20 million) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds\nResources, with a maturity of 32 years, including a grace\nperiod  of  8  years,  and  an  interest  charge  of  1.0  percent\nper  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per\nannum thereafter to be paid semiannually.\n\nThe  Government  will  provide  RDB  with  lines  of  credit\nunder  a subsidiary  loan agreement.

THE PROPOSAL\n\nII.          INTRODUCTION\n\nIn  response  to  the  request  of  the  Government,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\n2.\nprovided  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  prepare  the  Rural  Credit  and  Savings  Project  (the\nProject)  to  address  the  need  for  effective  financial  services  in  the  rural  area.1  The  TA  was\nimplemented  from  September  1998  to  February  1999.  A  series  of  participatory  workshops\nwere organized under the TA to ensure that key stakeholders, including relevant Government\nagencies,  commercial  banks,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  potential  project\nbeneficiaries  in  the  rural  areas,  were  extensively  consulted  in  formulating  the  Project.  ADB\nfielded  a  fact-finding  mission  in  March  1999  and  an  appraisal  mission  in  June  19992  to\nexamine  the  details  of  the  Project.  A  follow-up  consultation  mission  visited  Cambodia  in\nJanuary 2000  to  confirm  the  establishment  of  the  necessary  regulatory  framework  related  to\nthe Project. The logical framework for the Project is in Appendix 1.\n\nIII.          BACKGROUND\n\nA.\n\nSector Description\n\n1.\n\nRural Economy\n\n3.\nCambodia\u2019s real gross domestic product (GDP) was growing at an average annual  rate\nof 6.7 percent between 1991 and  1996.  However, due to the political  turmoil  in  Cambodia and\nthe financial crisis in the region, the real GDP growth declined to 2.6 percent in 1997 and to 1.3\npercent in 1998. The main source of the past growth was the industrial sector, which grew at an\naverage rate of 13.8 percent per annum during 1991-1996. By  comparison, agricultural growth\nwas rather sluggish at an average rate of 2.7 percent per annum during the  same period. This\nrate  of  growth  was  slightly  higher  than  the  estimated  rate  of  population  growth  at  about  2.4\npercent. As a consequence, the share of agriculture (including livestock, fisheries, and forestry)\nin the country\u2019s GDP declined from 51.8 percent in 1991 to 38.3 percent in 1998. Cambodia is\none  of  the  lowest-income  countries  in  the  world  with  its  GDP  per  capita  being  estimated  at\n$252  at  the  current  exchange  rate.  In  terms  of  social  capacity  for  human  development,\nCambodia is now ranked 137th, with its Human Development Index estimated at 0.514.3\n\n4.\nThe  rural  economy  is  the  dominant  part  of  the  Cambodian  economy  with  about  85\npercent of the population living in rural areas. Poverty incidence is estimated at 36 percent for\nthe  whole  country  and  40  percent  for  the  rural  areas  based  on  the  reference  food  bundle,\n\n                                               \n1 TA 2818-CAM: Rural Credit and Savings Project, for $600,000, approved on 26 June 1997.\n2  The  Mission  consisted  of  M.  Otsuka  (Sr.  Project  Economist),  H.  Pitney  (Sr.  Counsel),  D.  Walton  (Rural\nDevelopment  Specialist),  M.  Katagami  (Young  Professional),  D.  Lucock,  (Rural  Credit  Specialist  \u2013  Staff\nConsultant)  and  S.  Mak  (Rural  Sociologist  \u2013  Staff  Consultant),  and  was  assisted  by  the  ADB\u2019s  Cambodia\nResident Mission.\n\n3  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 1999. Human Development Report, New York.\n\n\f2\n\nyielding  2,100  calories  per  day,  and  some  nonfood  allowance.4  In  Cambodia,  poverty  is\nconcentrated in the rural areas as rural households account for about 90 percent  of  the poor\npopulation  in  the  country.  Poverty  incidence  is  particularly  high  in  remote  provinces  in  the\nnortheastern  and  southeastern  regions.  Poor  households  are  usually  larger  in  size  than  the\naverage and are headed by people who are illiterate or have had few years of schooling. Such\nhouseholds  are  heavily  handicapped  in  terms  of  (i)  ownership  of  assets,  including  land,\nhousing  and  cattle;  (ii)  access  to  basic  social  services  such  as  health,  education,  and  water\nsupply; and (iii) access to financial services.\n\n5.\nAbout 20 percent of poor households are headed by women in Cambodia. Households\nheaded by young women with infants are highly vulnerable to poverty and food insecurity due\nto the lack of access to land, credit, and other agricultural inputs. Commonly cited causes for\nrural  poverty  in  Cambodia  include  (i)  decades  of  internal  armed  conflicts  and  their\nconsequences,  (ii)  low  agricultural  productivity,  (iii)  high  degree  of  indebtedness,  and  (iv)\ninadequate public facilities for  social  services.  Even  many  of  those  who  are  living  above  the\npoverty line, live close to it in a near-poverty situation. Due to the importance of rice in people\u2019s\ndiet  in  the  country,  the  availability  of  rice  mainly  affects  food  security  and  nutrition,  and  the\nwelfare  of  the  rural  population. When there  is a bad  harvest,  rural  households  need  off-farm\nemployment  to  supplement  their  income  or  are  forced  to  borrow  money  from  relatives  or\ninformal moneylenders for food. Access to reliable credit and savings facilities are essential to\nimprove the livelihood of poor households in rural Cambodia.\n\n6.\nAgriculture,  which  is  the  primary  source  of  income  in  rural  areas,  is  generally\nsubsistence-oriented  with  rice  as the dominant  crop.  Rice  is  mainly  cultivated  in  areas  along\nthe  Mekong  River  and  around  the  Tonle  Sap  Lake.  About  2.1  million  hectares  (ha)  or  more\nthan 90 percent of the total cropped area of 2.3 million ha  are  planted  with  rice.  Other  major\nagricultural  crops  include  maize  (44,100  ha),  soybeans  (30,600  ha),  vegetables  (29,100  ha),\nand mung beans (25,600 ha).5 Rubber and timber have long been the  most  important export\nproducts of Cambodia, but agricultural products are increasingly being traded with neighboring\ncountries.  Based  on  the  recent  surveys, the  average  farm  size  is  estimated  at  1.10-1.26  ha.\nHowever, such national averages mask considerable differences in average farm size between\nprovinces,  ranging  from  0.55  ha  in  Kandal  Province  in  the  south  to  2.10  ha  in  Mondol  Kiri\nProvince  in  the east.  About  three-quarters  of  rural  households  are  also  engaged  in  livestock\nproduction.\n\n7.\nRecent  declines  in  crop  yields  were  mainly  caused  by  irregular  weather  conditions,\nparticularly  rainfall  unfavorable  for  rainfed  rice  cultivation,  and  by  the  shortage  of  irrigation\nfacilities.  Less  than 10 percent  of  the  cultivated  area  in  Cambodia  is  irrigated.  The  country\u2019s\nannual  yield  of  unhusked  rice  was  estimated  at  1.7  tons  per  ha  in  1998.  This  yield  level  is\nconsidered  to  be  the  lowest  in  the  region  and  has  slightly  improved  from  1.0  ton  per  ha  in\n1967. Constraints to the improvement of agricultural productivity include (i) poor conditions of\ntransport  infrastructure  in  rural  areas,  (ii)  inadequate  irrigation  facilities  particularly  for  rice\ncultivation, (iii) ineffective agricultural research and extension services, and (iv) lack of reliable\nand easily accessible financial services. Provision of better access to a package of necessary\ninputs such as improved seed varieties, fertilizers, and pesticides is also required for increased\n\n                                               \n4  Ministry of  Planning, the  Royal Government of  Cambodia.  1997.

Nevertheless,  there  was  a  slight  increase  in  total  rice  production,\nestimated at about 3.50 million tons in 1998 as compared with 3.45 million tons in 1997.\n\n8.\nUnder  the  Government\u2019s  liberalization  policies  and  structural  reform  measures  in  the\npast  few  years,  extensive  systems  for  marketing  of  agricultural  inputs  and  outputs  have\ngradually  developed  throughout  the  country.  ADB  has  been  supporting  the  Government  in\nimplementing  these  reform  measures  under  the  Agriculture  Sector  Program,6  including\nmeasures  to  improve  agricultural  marketing.  There  are  at  least  20  major  private  fertilizer\nwholesalers comprising the first tier of the distribution channel. Each wholesaler serves 15\u201325\nretailers  in  the  districts  where  it  operates.  Most  retailers  have  a  variety  of  other  products  to\ncomplement their fertilizer business. A similar but a far more complex network has developed\nfor  the  marketing  of  agricultural  products.  There  are  a  wide  variety  of  marketing  channels\ncomprising  farmers  and  dealers  who  have  combinations  of  functions  for  collecting,  milling,\nstoring,  retailing,  and  wholesaling.  These  input  and  output  trades  are  efficient  as  far  as\nphysical conditions permit, and the system is flexible, adapting to new opportunities. There is\nsubstantial room for the expansion of marketing if adequate credit is available to finance these\nactivities.\n\n2.\n\nRural Financial Services\n\nAbout 40 percent of the country\u2019s rural population have no commercial bank branches\n9.\nin their provinces, and, where branches exist, their services are confined to primary towns. Due\nto remoteness and the high administrative costs involved, commercial banks cannot effectively\ndeliver  small-scale  financial  services,  which  are  required  in  villages  to  provide  funds  for\ninvestment  in  a  wide  range  of  economic  activities.  The  demand  for  these  services  in  rural\nareas  are  met  by  NGOs  and  individual  moneylenders,  including  relatives,  friends,  and\nmiddlemen in the agricultural trade. Individual moneylenders often charge high  interest  rates,\nup  to  10  percent  per  month  or  equivalent  to  120  percent  per  annum.  The  lack  of  reliable\nfinancial services is a major constraint to the reduction of rural poverty in Cambodia.\n\n10.\nRelevant surveys indicate that the credit demand for on-farm  and off-farm  activities  in\nrural areas is substantial  and only  partly  met,  due  to  the  inadequate  supply  of funds.7  These\nsurveys  were  conducted  mainly  through  interviews  with  farmers,  moneylenders,  local\nadministration officials, and traders in their areas of operation, and for  both  group-based  and\nindividual business loans. The surveys reported that about 20 percent of the total households\nin  the  surveyed  areas  required  group-based  business  loans  and  that  about  8  percent  of  the\ntotal households need individual loans. Based on the average size of outstanding group-based\nloans, estimated at about $50 per household, and that for individual loans, at about $300, the\ntotal demand for credit in the country is estimated at about $85 million. Other surveys indicated\nhigher  figures  of  $120-130  million.  Regarding  the  supply  of  rural  credit,  the  socioeconomic\nsurvey  conducted  by  the  Ministry  of  Planning  indicated  that  about  30  percent  of  interviewed\nhouseholds  had  access  to  loans  from  NGOs  or  individual  moneylenders.  Assuming  that  the\nsame proportion of rural households received loans in 1998, about 560,000 households were\nable  to  have  access  to  loans.  The  total  amount  of  agricultural  loans  provided  from  these\nsources  was  estimated  at  $8  million  while  that  for  off-farm  business  activities  was  at  $24\n\n                                               \n6 Loan 1445-CAM: Agriculture Sector Program, for $30 million, approved on 20 June 1996.\n7 Ministry  of  Planning,  the  Royal  Government  of  Cambodia.  1998.  Socioeconomic Survey of Cambodia 1997,\nPhnom Penh. The surveys undertaken by the Association of Cambodian Local Economic Development Agencies\n(ACLEDA) in 1998 and Groupe de Recherche et d\u2019Echanges Technologique (GRET) in 1997 were also used for\nsupplementary information.\n\n\f4\n\nmillion. One of the NGOs also estimated that the total supply of rural credit in Cambodia was\nabout $27 million in 1998.\n\n11.\nBased  on  these  estimates,  the  total  demand  for  rural  credit  is  likely  to  be  $80-130\nmillion,  with the unmet  demand  of  $50-100  million.  The  medium-  to  long-term  projections  for\nthe demand and supply of rural credit will be more complicated because of difficulties involved\nin estimating the rate of overall economic growth, the  need for and  the type of  investment  in\nrural  enterprises,  and  future  business  plans  of  NGOs  and  commercial  banks.  However,  the\ndemand is likely to grow rapidly  in  view  of  the  improved political  and  security  situation  in  the\ncountry and the Government\u2019s commitment to hasten rural development.\n\n12.\nThe total domestic savings rate in Cambodia was 5 percent of GDP in 1997, which is\nthe lowest in Southeast Asia.8 The total amount of private savings recently declined due to the\npolitical turmoil in 1997 and 1998, and the decline in public confidence in banks. However, the\nrecent ADB study has indicated that there is clearly a strong demand for  saving  among  rural\ncommunities  if  reliable  savings  facilities  are  available.9  The  improvement  of  the  overall\nenvironment in the financial sector and  the expansion  of financial  services, particularly  in  the\nrural area, are essential for savings mobilization in the country. Some NGOs have introduced\ncompulsory  savings  schemes  in  conjunction  with  their  credit  operations,  but  are  not  able  to\nmobilize  a  substantial  amount  of  savings.  Frequently,  these  savings  are  considered  an\nadditional cost of borrowing due to low interest earnings, which are often lower than the rate of\ninflation. Some schemes do not have a clear mechanism for the withdrawal of savings and for\nthe ownership of saved funds. There are programs where savings become the property of the\ncommunity for use in social programs.\n\n13.\nThe  current  savings  schemes  of  some  NGOs  accompany  their  group  lending\noperations  and  are  supported  by  group  borrowers  with  very  small  financial  transactions.  For\ninstance, one NGO introduced a scheme where each borrower was required to deposit KR300\n($0.08) per week so that borrowers could easily practice saving. However, the total amount of\nsavings  mobilized  in  the  scheme  was  so  small  that  the  annual  cost  of  administering  the\nscheme  was  substantially  higher  than  the  margin  expected  from  the  operation  of  deposited\nfunds.  It  is  generally  accepted  among  NGOs  that,  in  addition  to  funds  from  external  funding\nagencies, domestic  resources need to be  mobilized through  savings  schemes  to  finance  the\nexpansion of their credit operations in rural areas. Their savings schemes cannot be confined\nto  their borrowers  only.  Under  the new  regulatory framework established  in  November  1999,\nNGOs  can  be  converted  into  licensed  financial  institutions  and  can  provide  both  credit  and\nsavings services for rural communities. Public confidence in the rural financial services will also\nbe  gradually  developed.  The  provision  of  savings  schemes  will  enable  rural  households  to\nmeet  their  demand  for  emergency  funds  from  their  savings  and  to  hold  liquidity  as  deposits\nrather than in the form of non-earning assets such as cash, jewelry, and gold.\n\n3.\n\nFinancial Sector\n\n14.\nThe banking system in Cambodia was completely destroyed during the Khmer  Rouge\nperiod.  Subsequently,  the  country  had  a  monobanking  system  of  the  National  Bank  of\nCambodia (NBC), operating through its provincial branches. Structural reforms were initiated in\n1989 through a Government decree to establish  a  two-tier banking  system by  separating the\nfunction of commercial banks from NBC, which has been the central bank in Cambodia since\n\n                                               \n8 IN.305-98:Country Economic Review, Cambodia, 17 December 1998.\n9  TA 2601-CAM: Rural Credit Review, for $100,000, approved on 4 July 1996.\n\n\f5\n\nthen.  This  decree  allowed  the  formation  of  private  commercial  banks  as  limited  liability\ncompanies.  In  1991,  the  first  private  commercial  bank  was  established  as  a  joint  venture\nbetween NBC and the Siam Commercial Bank of Thailand. Commercial banks operated under\nthe framework of a law on the supervision of financial institutions, which was enacted in August\n1992, and a subdecree on supervision of commercial banks approved in November 1992. This\nlegal framework has been replaced by a new, more comprehensive law on banking and financial\ninstitutions,  which  was  enacted  in  November  1999.  This  new  law  has  introduced  more\nappropriate  definitions  for  banking  activities  and  a  refined  legal  framework  for  banks.  It  also\nallows microfinance institutions (MFIs) to undertake financial operations under the supervision of\nNBC.\n\n15.\nAt present, 31 commercial banks and 20 provincial branches of NBC are operating. NBC\nintends  to  streamline  its  branches,  but  the  progress  has  been  slow.  The  total  amount  of\noutstanding  loans  of  commercial  banks  as  of  the  end  of  December  1999  was  estimated  at\nKR751  billion  ($198  million).  Commercial  banks  concentrate  on  credit  to  trading  and  services,\nwhich  comprises  51  percent  of  their  total  loan  portfolio.  Credit  for  agriculture-related  activities\naccounts for only about 4 percent of total loans outstanding of commercial banks. Since March\n1995, banks have  been allowed to set their  interest rates freely.  The  Government  reconfirmed\nthis policy in conjunction with ADB\u2019s Agriculture Sector Program Loan (footnote 6). Interest rates\non deposits and lending in local currency are quoted in riel, and the rates on foreign exchange\ndeposits and lending in US dollars. The ranges of annual interest rates on deposits are 4.0\u201312.0\npercent for riel and 3.5\u20138.5 percent for dollars. For commercial bank credit, the range in interest\nrates is up to 24.0 percent for 12 months in riel while the range is 16.5\u201319.0 percent for dollars.\nLess than 4 percent of the total credit of commercial banks is in local currency.\n\n16.\nForeign  currencies,  mostly  the  US  dollar  and  to  a  lesser  extent  the  Thai  baht,  are\ncommonly  used  by  the  public  in  Cambodia.  This  was  mainly  caused  by  the  destruction  of  the\nmonetary and banking systems during the Khmer Rouge period, and  reflects the  lack of public\nconfidence  in  the  local  currency  and  the  banking  system.  The  use  of  foreign  currencies  has\nsomewhat  protected  Cambodia  from  the  adverse  impact  of  the  recent  financial  crisis  in  the\nregion. The Government aims at a gradual decrease in  the use of  the  US  dollar,  only  through\nincreased  awareness  and  confidence  of  the  public  in  the  use  of  the  local  currency.10  The\nprogress  however  is  rather  slow,  and  foreign  currencies,  particularly  the  US  dollar,  have  a\ndominant  role  in  the  country\u2019s  economy.  The  overview  of  the  financial  sector  is  presented  in\nAppendix 2.\n\n4.\n\nOperations of Nongovernment Organizations\n\n17.\nAccording to a recent report of the Cooperation Committee for Cambodia, which is an\nassociation  of  NGOs  in  Cambodia,  163  domestic  NGOs  are  registered  with  the  Ministry  of\nInterior  and  133  foreign  NGOs  are  registered  with  various  Government  agencies.  NGOs\ndisburse  about  $75  million  each  year  for  a  wide  range  of  their  development  activities,\nequivalent to more than 20 percent of the Government\u2019s annual budget. The important role of\nNGOs for the reconstruction and development of the country is increasingly recognized by the\npublic, the Government, and the external funding agencies in Cambodia. Main areas of NGO\nactivities  include  agriculture  and  rural  development,  health,  education,  water,  and  sanitation.\nNGOs are also active in providing assistance to vulnerable groups and in clearing land mines.\n\n                                               \n10 The Prime Minister\u2019s speech at the NBC\u2019s Annual Conference on 24 March 1999.\n\n\f6\n\nThe agenda and the operational strategies of NGOs in Cambodia have changed as the\n18.\npolitical,  social,  and  economic  environment  in  the  country  evolved  from  a  planned  socialist\nstructure to that of a liberal market system. Most domestic NGOs are small, and often operate in\nspecific  geographical  areas  or  sectors  in  collaboration  with  international  NGOs  or  external\nfunding agencies. Many domestic NGOs are regarded as adopted,  emerging from  international\nNGOs,  and  receiving  support  from  their  parent  organizations.  But  they  are  increasingly\ndiversifying  their  operations  and  becoming  less  dependent  upon  a  single  agency  for  their\noperational support. The scope of international NGO operations is more diverse and covers wide\ngeographical areas. The cooperation between the Government and NGOs still consists largely of\ninformation exchanges. A mechanism for effective collaboration  in development activities  is yet\nto be developed due to the lack of adequate capacity and skills on both sides. However, there is\na constructive relationship between the Government and NGOs in development activities based\non  increasing  mutual  understanding.  NGOs  in  Cambodia  enjoy  extensive  cooperation  with  a\nlarge  number  of  external  funding  agencies.  Bilateral  funding  agencies  often  work  directly  with\nNGOs through direct funding to the programs of NGOs or through NGOs\u2019 participation in projects\nfinanced  by  such  agencies.  There  are  a  few  sector-based  groups  of  NGOs,  for  exchanges  of\ninformation and views, including one for rural credit operations.\n\nAbout  90  NGOs  operate  rural  credit  facilities.11  NGOs  have  expanded  their  credit\n19.\noperations to reach about 11 percent of rural households. Most clients of NGOs\u2019 credit facilities\nare poor households in rural areas. These NGOs provide loans to groups, with first-cycle loans\nto poor people of the same occupation  or  type  of  business.  Loans are usually  provided on a\nsix-month  cycle  and  mostly  used  for  activities  related  to  agriculture  and  agro-based\nbusinesses. Loans for individuals are provided based on the borrowers\u2019 performance with their\nfirst-cycle loans. The lending rates of NGOs are still high, at flat  rates  of  3.0\u20136.0  percent per\nmonth or 36.0\u201372.0 percent annually, reflecting high administrative costs  of  NGO  operations.\nSmaller credit operating NGOs have compulsory savings requirements where group members\ncontrol their savings and use these savings for lending among themselves.\n\n20.\nMajor NGOs having credit operations are being monitored by NBC based on the  data\nvoluntarily provided by these NGOs with respect to borrowers, loans outstanding, and interest\nrates.  As  these  schemes  of  NGOs  expand  rapidly,  a  proper  system  of  regulation  and\nsupervision urgently needs to be institutionalized to ensure  sound financial  management  and\nincrease  public  confidence  in  rural  financial  services.  In  this  context,  NBC  introduced  in\nJanuary 2000 a new regulation for licensing and supervising these NGOs as licensed MFIs.12\nThe credit and savings operations of NGOs are described in Appendix 3.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n21.\nThe  Government\u2019s  medium-term  development  objectives  are  set  out  in  its  first\nSocioeconomic  Development  Plan  (SEDP:  1996\u20132000)  with  expected  public  investment\nprograms  totaling  $2.2  billion.  The  SEDP  is  the  first  medium-term  plan  in  line  with  the\nGovernment\u2019s  market-oriented  policy.  The  Government  considers  in  the  SEDP  that  poverty\nreduction is the most important medium- to long-term objective to be focused on the rural areas.\nThe  Government\u2019s  general  strategy  for  poverty  reduction  in  the  SEDP  aims  at  addressing\naspects  of  poverty  by  (i)  providing  social  services  in  an  equitable  manner,  (ii)  ensuring  the\n\n                                               \n11 In addition, three Government-administered lending programs are financed by the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund\n\n(UNICEF), the European Union, and the Ministry of Women Affairs.\n\n12 Circular (Prakas) for Licensing of Microfinance Institutions, 11 January 2000.\n\n\f7\n\nsustainable pattern of growth and development, and (iii) strengthening domestic self-reliance and\nreducing dependence on foreign assistance.\n\n22.\nIn line with the SEDP,  the Government has formulated a  strategic  plan  for  1997\u20132001,\nwhich describes the  sector  strategy  for  agriculture  and  rural  development.  Under  this  strategic\nplan,  the  Government  aims  at  (i)  improving  food  security  through  expanding  the  production  of\nrice and other food crops, (ii) contributing to economic growth and to increased foreign exchange\nearnings through agricultural exports, (iii) improving income opportunities for farm households by\ndiversifying crop production, and (iv) adding increased value to crop and livestock production by\ndeveloping  agro-processing  industries.  One  of  the  strategies  to  achieve  these  objectives  is  to\nincrease  the availability of  services  for  loans  and  savings  for  farmers  and  small  entrepreneurs\nthrough a rural financial system led by the private sector.\n\n23.\nIn  December  1998,  the  Government  formulated  a  rural  credit  policy  and  strategy  in\nrelation  to  the  Agriculture  Sector  Program  (footnote  6).  Its  policy  statement  for  rural  credit\nspecifically aims to (i) support the expansion of rural credit and savings services by encouraging\nthe  entry  of  MFIs  and  commercial  banks;  (ii)  strengthen  the  capacity  of  NBC  to  facilitate  their\nsupportive  roles  in  promoting  rural  credit  and  savings  through  licensing,  regulation,  and\nsupervision of MFIs; (iii) make the Rural Development Bank (RDB) a self-sustainable wholesale\nbanking institution with the appointment of banking professionals in its management and board;\nand (iv) continue to monitor  credit  activities  of  NGOs  and  community-based  organizations  and\nencourage their efforts to become licensed MFIs. Subsequently, the Government has prepared a\nstrategy paper for rural credit, which was approved by a meeting of the Council of Ministers on\n28 December 1998. The Project has been formulated in line with this policy and strategy of the\nGovernment.\n\n24.\nThe Government amended the subdecree and the statute for RDB in November 1999, in\nline with its policy and strategy for rural finance, and included qualified personnel with adequate\nbanking  experience  in  RDB\u2019s  senior  management.  The  Government  has  also  taken  steps  to\nstrengthen NRB's licensing, monitoring, and supervising functions for MFIs.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n25.\nSince 1992, ADB has provided 12 loans totaling about $374.0 million and 65 TAs totaling\nabout  $50.5  million.  Three  loans  since  1995,  including  a  portion  of  the  Special  Rehabilitation\nAssistance Loan,13 for a total of $65.1 million or about 21 percent of the total committed lending\nprograms,  were  specifically  for  agriculture  and  rural  development.  Four  TAs  since  1995  were\nspecifically  for  credit  and  savings.  ADB  is  often  faced  with  practical  constraints  to  effective\nproject  implementation  in  Cambodia  due  to  the  (i)  shortage  of  skilled  people,  (ii)  lack  of\nGovernment  staff  experienced  in  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  foreign-aided  projects\nand  programs,  (iii)  inadequate  financial  resources  of  the  Government,  and  (iv)  lack  of\nunderstanding  of  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  procedures.  These  practical  issues  with  ongoing  projects\nare regularly discussed for resolution during project review missions, and at meetings of project\nmanagers organized by the ADB\u2019s Cambodia Resident Mission. In conjunction with the Project,\nADB  approved  an  advisory  TA  to  build  institutional  capabilities  for  effective  rural  financial\nservices.14 This TA will assist (i) NBC in establishing procedures for licensing and supervising\n\n                                               \n13 Loan  1199-CAM: Special Rehabilitation Assistance Loan, for  $67.7 million,  approved  on  26  November  1992.  A\nportion  of  loan  proceeds,  about  $10  million,  was  allocated  for  the  rehabilitation  of  irrigation  systems  and  the\nprovision of agricultural inputs.\n\n14 TA 3270-CAM: Capacity Building for Rural Financial Services, for $1.45 million, approved on 7 September 1999.\n\n\f8\n\nMFIs  and  in  strengthening  its  capacity  for  monitoring  and  supervision  of  MFIs;  (ii)  RDB  and\nMFIs  in  strengthening  their  capability  in  financial  management,  banking  skills,  and  reporting;\nand (iii) MFIs in savings promotion and product development. The provision of the TA is based\non ADB\u2019s  recognition that  sound  institutional  development  is  the  key  to  the  establishment  of\neffective  and sustainable financial  services  in  the  rural  areas  in  Cambodia,  and  will  enhance\nthe Government\u2019s policy for rural credit and savings.\n\n26.\nIn the financial sector, ADB provided a TA to enhance professional banking skills through\nthe development of the Center for Banking Studies.15 This TA aimed at increasing the number of\nqualified  trainers  in  banking  skills  and  initiating  the  establishment  of  a  full-fledged  and  self-\nsustaining bankers\u2019 institute, thereby formulating a firm basis for sustainable development of the\nfinancial sector in Cambodia. The World Bank has provided a loan of $18 million to support the\ndevelopment of the Social Fund under the Government\u2019s Council of Ministers. The Social Fund\nhas  reached  140  districts  covering  all  24  provinces  in  the  country,16  and  financed  more  than\n1,400  subprojects  for  water  supply,  education,  health,  and  village-level  infrastructure  facilities.\nThese subprojects, with a funding limit of $50,000 for an individual project, are selected based on\nspecific criteria relating to the degree of poverty among the project beneficiaries. The World Bank\napproved in March 1999 the provision of a follow-up on the Social Fund, in the amount of about\n$24 million.\n\nThe  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  in  collaboration  with  the\n27.\nInternational Finance Corporation (IFC) of the World Bank Group and the United States Agency\nfor  International  Development  (USAID),  is  supporting  an  NGO,  the  Association  of  Cambodian\nLocal Economic Development Agencies (ACLEDA), to become a formal financial institution and\nstrengthen  its  capacity  to  become  a  financially  viable  institution  to  provide  rural  credit  and\nsavings.  This  assistance  to  ACLEDA  will  continue  until  2001.  ACLEDA  plans  to  become  a\ncompany  with  equity  participation  from  IFC  and  financial  corporations  in  Germany  and  the\nNetherlands.\n\n28.\nThe French Agency for Development (AFD) has provided a TA amounting to $4 million\nthrough  the  Government  to  four  NGOs  to  support  their  credit  operations  and  assist  NBC  in\nformulating  regulations  and  guidelines  for  sound  development  of  microfinance  operations.  The\nTA will continue until 2001. AFD  also  signed an agreement  with  the Government  in November\n1998  for  the  provision  of  grant  funds  of  about  $1.0  million  to  finance  rubber  smallholder\ndevelopment. Of this amount, about $0.8 million will be used for the provision of long-term loans\nthrough  RDB  for  rubber  plantation  by  farmers.  AFD  confirmed  that  the  use  of  RDB  for  direct\nlending  to  farmers  is  a  temporary  measure  until  a  separate  fund  is  established  under  AFD\u2019s\nproject to accommodate this financing facility.\n\n29.\nThe International Fund for Agricultural Development has provided a loan of $8 million for\nagricultural development in three provinces in northwestern Cambodia. This project will support\nthe agricultural extension services and training, and finance  rural credit operations of  NGOs  in\nthe project area. The total amount of credit is estimated at about $1.4  million provided through\nNGOs for about 18,000 rural households. The Government will establish a revolving fund at RDB\nto channel the fund for NGOs. ADB has been conducting dialogue with these donors for closer\ncoordination during the formulation of the proposed Project. Appendix 4 lists the relevant projects\nand programs of external funding agencies for agriculture and rural development in Cambodia.\n\n                                               \n15 TA 2796-CAM: Enhancing Banking Skills Project, for $400,000, approved on 19 May 1997 and completed on 28\n\nFebruary 1999.\n\n16 These include four municipalities of Phnom Penh, Krong Prean Sihanouk, Krong Kaeb, and Krong Pailin.\n\n\f9\n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\n30.\nIn recent years, a number of NGOs have been engaged in rural microfinance programs in\nCambodia.  These  NGOs  have  demonstrated  their  capability  to  provide  and  expand  effective\nrural financial services if they receive adequate institutional and financial support. Most of these\nNGOs provide both  group  lending  without collateral to  meet  the demand for  smaller  credit and\nmicroenterprise  loans  with  collateral  requirements.  They  have  achieved  substantial  outreach\nwithin their operational areas. Their average loan recovery rates are generally high, at more than\n90 percent. The growth of successful microfinance operations in Cambodia can be attributed to\nthe liberal and market-oriented policy environment that ensured the freedom of market entry and\nminimal  regulatory  requirements.  The  Government  is  committed  to  maintaining  this  policy  and\nencouraging further development of rural microfinance programs.\n\n31.\nNGOs  in  Cambodia,  which  have  been  successful  in  rural  credit  operations,  share\ncommon characteristics. These are (i) significant outreach within localized areas, (ii) high rates\nof  loan  recovery,  (iii)  an  increasingly  large  loan  portfolio  that  enables  overhead  costs  to  be\nadequately covered, (iv) a high annual rate of growth of the loan portfolio, and (v) a significant\ntransformation  toward  becoming  a  domestically  managed  organization.  These  successful\nfeatures have encouraged external funding agencies to increase funds that, in turn, have led to\nincreased efficiency due to a larger scale of activities. On the other hand, the activities of less\nsuccessful  NGOs  are  often  constrained  by  poorly  motivated  part-time  volunteers,  poor\nmanagement information systems, full or partial reliance on Government assistance, and a de-\ncapitalizing  loan  portfolio  because  of  poor  loan  recovery  and  subsidized  interest  rates.  Any\nrural  credit  schemes  that  provide  subsidized  loans  may  bring  in  distortions  in  the  financial\nmarkets and create an unsustainable credit mechanism in Cambodia. It will also undermine the\ninitiatives of NGOs and diminish their outreach in rural areas.\n\nExperience in other countries, such as Bangladesh, India, and Philippines, shows that\n32.\nan apex financial  institution  can  provide  an  effective  mechanism  with  reasonable  success  to\nchannel  funds  from  the  Government  and  external  funding  agencies  to  MFIs  for  onlending  to\nsmall-scale  borrowers  in  rural  areas.  The  key  factors  of  such  success  include  the  assured\nautonomy and  independence of  the  apex  institution that enabled  them  to  secure  its  decision\nmaking  toward  self-sustainability  and financial  viability.  Despite  the  operational  objectives  for\nrural  development,  such  institutions  need  to  have  freedom  in  pricing  products  and  choosing\ntheir  clientele  based  on  the  costs  and  risks  of  individual  transactions.  It  is  also  important  to\nhave enough MFIs to provide loans to subborrowers and to promote sound competition among\nsuch MFIs. The interest rate pricing must be positive in real terms to compensate savers and\ngenerate  enough  profits  to  realize  reasonable  returns  to  the  capital  and  reserve  for  future\ninvestment.\n\n33.\nSuccessful  rural  financial  institutions  in  Asia  have  strong  saving  mobilization  facilities\nthat  sometimes  exceed  their  lending  volume.  In  Cambodia,  most  cash  in  circulation  is  kept\noutside financial institutions, and there is a strong need for safe and credible saving facilities,\nparticularly in rural areas. Successful savings mobilization requires technical  skills  to  develop\nsaving  schemes  that  correspond  well  to  the needs  in the  market as  well  as  sound  legal  and\nregulatory frameworks that authorize these institutions to take deposits. Sound institutional and\nregulatory  development  is  essential  for  the  success  of  sustainable  rural  financial  services.\nSubstantial  training  programs,  technical  support,  and  extension  services  will  initially  be\nrequired  to  improve  and  ensure  the  long-term  sustainability  of  the  MFIs\u2019  financial  services.\n\n\f10\n\nThese lessons and experiences have been fully considered in formulating  the  Project. ADB\u2019s\nTA will provide MFIs with such technical support (para. 25).\n\n34. With  respect  to  implications  for  poverty  reduction,  there  may  be  a  trade-off  between\noutreach to the poor and financial sustainability of MFIs. Licensed financial institutions, which\naim at self-sustainability and are required to meet financial norms, may try to reduce costs by\nproviding larger loans to existing borrowers rather than smaller loans to new borrowers among\nthe  rural  poor.  However,  NGOs  in  Cambodia  provide  credit  to  poor  people  through  group\nlending  for  their  first-cycle  borrowing.  In  this  way,  successful  NGOs  are  able  to  expand  the\nnumber of poor households they serve in the rural area without giving up financial sustainability\nof their credit operations.\n\nThe Project will be ADB\u2019s first rural finance activity in Cambodia. During the formulation\n35.\nof the Project, lessons learned from ADB\u2019s rural finance projects  in  other  countries,  including\nBangladesh,  Indonesia,  Nepal,  Philippines,  and  Thailand,  have  been  carefully  reviewed  and\nincorporated  into  the  project  design.  The  project  performance  evaluation  reports  of  these\nprojects indicate that the interest rate must be high enough to ensure the financial viability of\nlending financial  institutions and  to guarantee  the  long-term  growth of a  sustainable  financial\nsystem. Subsidized lending at below market interest rates tends to result in the misallocation of\nscarce  resources,  encourages  misuse  of funds,  and  often  reaches  the  local  elite  rather  than\nlower-income  borrowers.  ADB\u2019s  experience  in assisting development finance  institutions  also\nsuggests  that  the  attainment  of  managerial  autonomy  and  independence  of  the  financial\ninstitutions from governments should be ensured, while simultaneously the internal control and\naudit  functions  of  the  institutions  should  be  strengthened.  The  greater  degree  of  flexibility  in\noperation  and  administration  helps  such  an  institution  to  grow  into  a  dynamic  and  effective\nfinancial intermediary.\n\n36.\nOne  lesson  to  be  learned  from  Mongolia,  which  has  also  experienced  the  transition\nfrom  a  monobanking  system  to  a  two-tier  banking  system,  is  the  significance  of  an  overall\nsector design approach for reforms of financial institutions. The evaluation of ADB\u2019s TAs also\nemphasizes  the  importance  of  strengthening  the  supervisory  and  regulatory  authority  at  an\nearly stage to maximize the impact of subsequent financial sector reforms and to smoothen the\ntransition process. In this regard, the Project supports the establishment and strengthening of\nthe  regulatory  and  supervisory  framework,  which  is  conducive  to  such  a  sector  design\napproach. ADB  missions  were fully  involved  in  the  preparation  of  relevant  regulations  during\nthe processing of the Project. The Project also envisages the development of a rural financial\nsystem  through  upgrading  of  NGOs  with  a  view  to  their  eventual  interaction  with  the  overall\nbanking sector in the long run.\n\nE.\n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\n37.\nIn view of the lack of extensive financial services in the rural areas, ADB\u2019s rural finance\nstrategy  in  Cambodia  aims  at  facilitating  the  expansion  of  successful  experiences  of\nmicrofinance programs being carried out by NGOs to improve rural livelihoods. There is also a\ngeneral  consensus  among  major  external  funding  agencies  in  Cambodia  that  effective  rural\nfinancial services can be best established through nurturing the existing activities of NGOs and\nupgrading them into licensed MFIs. The establishment of a formal rural finance system should\nbe led by the efforts of the private sector, and the state intervention should be mainly confined\nto  the  establishment  of  a  sound  regulatory  and  supervisory  environment.  While  a  wholesale\nbank  currently  channels  funds  to  MFIs  in  order  to  support  their  operations,  this  should  not\neliminate the potential for commercial banks to finance MFIs\u2019 operations. Rather, the wholesale\n\n\f11\n\nbanking  institution  should  play  a  catalytic  role  and  induce  other  commercial  banks  to\nparticipate in financing MFIs\u2019 operations through the demonstration of viability and successful\ninteractions with MFIs.\n\nADB\u2019s  current  country  operational  strategy  (COS)  for  Cambodia  was  prepared  in\n38.\nNovember 1995. The major thrusts of the COS  include  the promotion  of  economic  growth  as\nthe  principal  means  for  creating  employment  opportunities  and  reducing  poverty,  and  the\nstrengthening of capacity for good governance and improved project management through an\neffective combination of TA and lending modalities. The COS recognizes that  agriculture and\nrural development is the key to sustainable economic growth of Cambodia. In this context, it is\nessential to achieve the substantial improvement of agricultural productivity through (i) a  shift\nfrom  solely  subsistence-oriented  farming  to  the  introduction  of  market-oriented,  commercial\nproduction; (ii) the promotion of private sector participation in input supply, product processing,\nand  marketing;  (iii)  improvement  in  agricultural  research  and  extension  services  based  on  a\nclient-oriented strategy; (iv)  the provision and  proper  maintenance  of  critical  infrastructure for\nrural  transport,  irrigation,  and  drainage;  and  (v)  the  provision  of  adequate  rural  financial\nservices.  The  ADB's  Agriculture  Sector  Program  (footnote  6)  has  been  supporting  these\naspects in Cambodia.\n\n39.\nThe new COS will be formulated in 2000. Its overall strategic objective will be poverty\nreduction  through  economic  growth.  The  new  COS  will  be  based  on  the  reassessment  of\nmeans by which the ADB\u2019s operational strategy is to be implemented, taking into account the\npriorities of  the  new  Government, the  present  absorptive  capacity  of  the  country,  and  ADB\u2019s\noperational  experience  in  Cambodia.  ADB  is  also  formulating  a  microfinance  development\nstrategy to achieve its objective of poverty reduction through effective and  consistent support\nfor  the  expansion  of  microfinance  activities.  The  Project  has  been  prepared  in  line  with  this\napproach through the expansion of MFIs\u2019 outreach to the poor.\n\nMajor  external  funding  agencies  involved  in  rural  credit  in  Cambodia  share  the  same\n40.\nconcern  about  the  financial  sustainability  of  MFIs.  Further  cooperation  with  other  external\nfunding agencies is vital to maintaining  a favorable environment for  NGOs  to be transformed\ninto  licensed  MFIs  and  strengthened.  ADB  will  continue  its  collaboration  with  other  external\nfunding agencies in relation to the Project.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\nADB's dialogue with the Government, which has evolved since the commencement of\n41.\nADB-financed  TAs  and  has  continued  during  the  preparation  of  the  Project  and  the\nimplementation of the Agriculture Sector Program (footnote 6), has resulted in the formulation\nof the Government\u2019s  new  rural credit  policy  and  strategy,  which  were approved  in  December\n1998. The new policy aims at supporting the expansion of rural credit and  the  introduction  of\nsavings  schemes  in  rural  areas  by  encouraging  the  licensed  microfinance  establishments  to\nenter  rural  finance.  Since  then,  there  have  been  rapid  and  notable  developments  in\nestablishing  a  working  relationship  among  the  Government,  NBC,  and  NGOs,  which  is\nfavorable for  the  promotion  of  viable  MFIs.  The  Project  has  been  formulated  in  line  with  the\nnew Government policy. The dialogue on the Government\u2019s policy of rural finance will continue\nduring project implementation.\n\nADB  recognizes \n\ninstitutional\n42.\nframeworks for the sustainable development of rural financial services in the long run. The new\nlaw on banking and financial institutions and NBC\u2019s regulation for the licensing and supervision\n\nimportance  of  establishing  sound \n\nlegal  and \n\nthe \n\n\f12\n\nof MFIs provide the basic regulatory framework for rural finance in Cambodia (para. 14). NBC\nhad  active  consultations  with  the  relevant  parties,  including  NGOs,  before  finalizing  the\nregulation.  ADB  missions  were  fully  involved  in  this  process.  These  undertakings  have  also\nbeen  supported  by  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  which  is  helping  the  Government\nstrengthen the overall financial sector. NBC will ensure  that  a  set of prudential  rules  relevant\nfor  MFIs  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  NBC\u2019s  regulations,  for  a  transparent  and\nenabling operational environment for MFIs.\n\n43. With respect to the institutional set-up relating to the Project, ADB has been engaged in\na  dialogue  with  the  Government  and  NBC.  RDB\u2019s  senior  management  and  the  board  of\ndirectors  have  been  changed  to  introduce  adequate  knowledge  and  skills  in  commercial\nbanking into RDB\u2019s management. ADB considers that these changes will form a critical basis\nfor effective project implementation. In addition, strengthening of the institutional capabilities of\nNBC,  RDB,  and the  prospective  MFIs  is  urgently  required  for  promoting  financial  services  in\nthe  rural  area.  Strengthening  of  NBC\u2019s  capability  to  supervise  MFIs  will  be  particularly\nimportant  after  the  regulatory  framework  for  the  licensing  and  supervision  of  MFIs  is\nintroduced. ADB is providing an advisory TA to help establish the framework (para. 25).\n\nIV.          THE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\n44.\nThe  Project  will  help  fill  the  need  for  increased  access  by  Cambodia\u2019s  rural  poor  to\nreliable  and  effective  financial  services.  About  90  percent  of  the  country\u2019s  poor  live  in  rural\nareas,  which  have  no  reliable  and  effective  financial  services.  There  are  no  branches  of\ncommercial banks in 15 of Cambodia\u2019s 24 provinces. People often need to travel to Phnom Penh\nfor  financial  transactions.  To  make  up  for  this  deficiency,  NGOs  have  been  providing  rural\nhouseholds  with  credit  and  savings  services  and  have  reached  about  11  percent  of  rural\nhouseholds. Most rural households, however, have no access to effective financial services and\nrely solely on relatives, informal moneylenders, and middlemen in agricultural trade, who charge\nhigh  interest  rates.  Poor  households  in  the  rural  areas  are  particularly  handicapped  in  this\nregard. The lack of access to reliable financial services is a major constraint to the reduction of\nrural poverty in  Cambodia.  The need to  resort  to  moneylenders also  makes  it  difficult for the\npoor to escape from the poverty cycle. The Project will build upon the efforts of NGOs to provide\nrural poor households with increased access to effective financial services.\n\nDespite the large unmet demand for  rural  credit  (paras. 9-11), the expansion of  NGOs\u2019\n45.\nrural  credit  is  now  being  constrained  by  the  limited  availability  of  sources  of  financing.  Since\nnonlicensed financial institutions cannot take in savings from the general public, the deficiency in\nmonetary resources severely constrains the credit operations of NGOs, which need to mobilize\nsavings  to  finance  the  expansion  of  their  loan  portfolios  in  rural  areas  and  provide  rural\nhouseholds with better and more profitable access to liquidity.\n\n46.\nThe project financial intermediaries  will operate  close  to the communities they  serve.  A\nnumber of better performing NGOs have expressed strong interest in (i) expanding their services\nto  cover  both  credit  and  savings  services,  and  (ii)  becoming  licensed  as  MFIs.  Through  an\nimproved  regulatory  and  supervisory  environment,  and  enhanced  governance  and  operational\nefficiency,  these  MFIs  will  be  able  to  attract  and  service  broad-based  savings  and  to  increase\ntheir borrowings from commercial banks to allow for further expansion.\n\n\f13\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n B.\n \n47.\nThe primary objective of the Project is to develop effective financial services in the rural\nareas,  which  will  provide  poor  households  with  better  access  to  rural  finance.  The  Project  will\nsupport  the  activities  of  NGOs  that  have  demonstrated  viable  systems  of  credit  delivery  and\nachieved  substantial  outreach.  As  seen  in  the  pattern  of  NGOs\u2019  lending  activities,  most\nsubborrowers  are  from  poor  households  in  the  rural  area.  More  than  50  percent  of  the\nsubborrowers  are  expected  to  be  women  representing  their  households.  ADB\u2019s  operational\nstrategy for rural development emphasizes the need for steady reduction in poverty as a major\nobjective. The Project will help achieve this objective by providing the rural poor with increased\naccess  to  rural  financial  services.  The  Project  will  support  ADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  and\ncontribute to the development of sound regulatory and institutional frameworks for the expansion\nof microfinance services in the rural areas.\n \n 48.\nThe  Project  scope  will  include  (i)  microfinance  for  agricultural  and  microenterprise\nsubprojects, (ii) operational support for licensed financial institutions (LFIs), including MFIs,17 and\n(iii)  project  management  support  for  RDB.  The  Project  will  cover  the  rural  credit  and  savings\noperations of the prospective MFIs over the whole country but will initially be implemented mainly\nin  the  northwestern,  eastern,  and  southern  regions,  where  the  prospective  MFIs  are  currently\nactive.\n\n49.\nUnder the Loan, the Government will provide to RDB lines of credit totaling about $19.0\nmillion equivalent. The credit lines will primarily be financed with proceeds of the ADB loan and\nused for onlending to agricultural and nonfarm income-generating activities of rural subborrowers\nand  for  investment.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  passed  on  to  RDB  under  a  subsidiary  loan\nagreement between the Government and RDB, which will onlend these funds as a wholesaler to\nLFIs.  These credit lines  will be provided  both  in  riels  and  in  US  dollars.  Based  on  the  interest\nexpressed  by  MFIs,  it  is  expected  that  subsidiary  loans  from  the  Government  to  RDB  will  be\nequally divided into riel and US dollars. Disbursement of credit funds will take into account the\nrecovery of loans from subborrowers in previous years and LFIs\u2019 loan programs as defined in\ntheir  business  plans.  The  indicative  types  of  major  activities  to  be  financed  by  these  lines  of\ncredit  include  agricultural  production,  retail  trading,  pig  raising,  rice  milling,  silk  weaving,  brick\nmaking, and  small-scale  irrigation.  The  average  loan  size  is  expected  to  be  about  $100.  LFIs,\nincluding at least five MFIs, will be serving about 260,000 rural households with about two loans\nper household on average by the end of the project implementation period.\n\n50.\nLFIs  will  fund  about  15  percent  of  the  total  credit  for  subborrowers  out  of  their  own\nresources  and  savings  they  mobilize.  RDB  will  assess  savings  schemes  of  LFIs  and  assist\nthem in improving their services. RDB will only allow LFIs to have access to loan funds under\nthe Project if they are able to implement a sound savings program. Such savings programs will\nbe  community based and need  not be dependent  on  or  generated  from  subborrower  groups\nonly.  Although  some  NGOs  in  Cambodia  operate  compulsory  savings  schemes  among  their\ngroup members, the experience of most NGOs indicates that the administrative costs for small-\nvolume compulsory savings schemes are too high to be sustainable.\n\n51.\nA  revolving  fund  for  the  Project  will  be  established  within  six  months  of  loan\neffectiveness,  and  maintained  by  RDB  to  credit  funds  generated  from  repayments  made  by\n\n                                               \n17 An NGO will be licensed as a specialized bank engaged in rural finance, which is allowed to have a wider range\n\nof financial activities than an MFI.\n\n\f14\n\nLFIs.  These  funds  will  be  used  for  onlending  to  LFIs  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s\nsubsidiary loan agreement with RDB. Subborrowers will receive loans as members of groups\nfor their first borrowing. First loans from LFIs to subborrowers under the Project will be about\nKR200,000 ($53) for terms of up to one year. Subsequent loans will be for larger amounts up\nto about KR2.0 million ($526) for group borrowers for longer terms as needed. The terms and\nconditions for loans for individual subborrowers will be determined based on the assessment of\nindividual applications. Based on current patterns,  about  80  percent of the  lending  will  be for\nactivities relating to rural livelihoods, including agricultural production, petty trading, pig raising,\nand  small-scale  irrigation,  with  the  remainder  for  food  processing  and  light  manufacturing\nundertakings.  The  average  recovery  rate  for  loans  to  subborrowers  is  expected  to  be  more\nthan  90  percent.  LFIs  will  be  required  to  adopt  prudent  policies  for  holding  a  reasonable\namount of cash under NBC\u2019s regulations and supervision.\n\n52.\nThe  credit  lines  under  the  Project  will  also  finance  LFIs\u2019  investment  requirements,\namounting to about $1.1 million, for the procurement of service vehicles, equipment, and civil\nworks to establish and rehabilitate their branch offices. The equipment to be procured by LFIs\nwill include computers and other office equipment to facilitate the computerization of financial\nmanagement  between  their  head  offices  and  branches,  and  safes  to  hold  cash  needed  to\nassure  depositors  of  access  to  their  savings.  This  will  strengthen  the  capability  of  LFIs  in\nliquidity  management  and  promote  the  development  of  their  savings  schemes  based  on  a\nbroader  range  of  depositors  than  their  group-based  borrowers  alone.  LFIs  will  be  able  to\ndevelop  savings  schemes  after  they  are  licensed  by  NBC.  The  LFIs  are  required  to  expand\ntheir savings schemes under the Project. Such schemes will initially include facilities for small-\nscale savings deposits and for deposits to meet medium- and long-term investment needs.\n \n53.\nThe Project will also support RDB for its project implementation through the provision of\nservice vehicles, office equipment, and consulting services. Adequate funds will also be provided\nto  meet  incremental  operating  costs,  including  expenses  for  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation\nactivities of the Project. Such support will be provided for RDB\u2019s project management unit (PMU)\nthrough the Government\u2019s annual budget procedures.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n C.\n \n 54.\nThe total cost of the Project  is estimated at $26.56  million,  including physical and price\ncontingencies,  and  the  interest  on  the  ADB  loan  during  project  implementation.  Contingencies\nare provided for the component of project management support only. In view of a large share of\nimported  products  to  be  purchased  for  retail  trading  and  for  agricultural  inputs  by  the\nsubborrowers, the proportion of the direct and indirect foreign exchange costs of the credit  line\nfor microcredit is estimated to be about 50 percent of the total amount required for credit funds.\nThe total foreign exchange cost of the Project is estimated at $13.76 million or 52 percent of the\ntotal project cost, and  the  local currency  cost at $12.80 million  equivalent  or  48  percent  of  the\ntotal  cost.

The loan will be from ADB's Special Funds resources with a maturity of 32 years, including\na grace period of 8 years, and with an interest charge of 1.0 percent per annum during the grace\nperiod and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter. ADB will finance the entire foreign exchange costs\nof  the  Project  and  49  percent  of  the  local  currency  costs.  This  is  necessary  in  view  of  the\nGovernment\u2019s  fiscal  constraints  and  its  difficulties  in  mobilizing  domestic  revenue  effectively,\nwhich averages about 8 percent of GDP. The Borrower will be the Kingdom of Cambodia.  The\nbalance of about $6.6 million will be financed by (i) the Government, mainly in the form of equity\nfor RDB and expenditures to support RDB\u2019s project management; and (ii) LFIs. There will be little\nor  no  cash  contributions  from  subborrowers,  who  will  use  their  family  labor  in  their  subproject\nactivities.  The  amount  of  family  labor  will  vary  depending  upon  the  type  of  subprojects  to  be\nfinanced  under  the  Project,  which  will  be  determined  during  project  implementation.18  The\nfinancing plan is summarized in Table 2 and details are presented in Appendix 5.\n\nFinancing Plan\n\n26.56       103\n\n12.80\n\n  100\n\n  52\n\n  48\n\n                                               \n18 For instance, based on the experience of NGOs\u2019 credit operations, the average contribution of family labor in an\nagricultural subproject, expressed in the market wage rate, is estimated at more than 40 percent of the total cost\nwhile that for pig raising at less than 5 percent.\n\n\f \n\n \n \n \n\nSource\n\n ADB\n Governmenta\n LFIs\n \n               Total\n \n\n16\n\n Table 2:  Financing Plan\n ($ million)\n \nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nPercent\n\n13.76\n  0.00\n  0.00\n\n13.76\n\n  6.24\n  2.72\n  3.84\n\n12.80\n\n20.00     75\n  2.72     10\n  3.84     15\n\n 26.56   100\n\n1.\n\nProject Organization\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n  a  Includes contributions to the credit lines and project management.\n \n E.\n \n \n \n56.\nRDB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  management  of  the  Project  and  the\nmicrocredit component of the Project, assuming overall responsibility for the implementation of\nmicrofinance  operations,  and  NBC  will  be  the  EA  for  LFI  supervision.  RDB  has  been\ndesignated as the EA for microfinance operations in view of the Government\u2019s policy for rural\ncredit and  savings, and  recent  improvements  in  its  managerial  capability.  RDB  established a\nPMU and appointed a project manager in July 1999. The PMU has five officers, including the\nproject manager, and supporting staff.\n\n57.\nThe  Government  will  also  establish  a  project  coordination  committee  (PCC)  with  a\nchairperson at least at the level of undersecretary from the Ministry of Economy and Finance.\nThe PCC will be established as soon as practicable but, in all events,  within  three  months  of\nloan  effectiveness.  The  PCC  will  meet  at  least  twice  yearly  and  function  as  a  central-level\ncoordination  body  to  support  project  activities  by  providing  overall  policy  guidance  and\ndirections  for  project  implementation,  and  by  helping  to  resolve  any  outstanding  issues.\nMembers  of  the  PCC  will  include  representatives  of  NBC;  RDB;  the  Ministry  of  Rural\nDevelopment; the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries; and LFIs participating in the\nProject. The PMU\u2019s project manager will act as the PCC\u2019s secretary.\n \n58.\nRDB will act as a wholesale banking institution to provide funds to LFIs. Some financial\ntransactions  have  taken  place  between  RDB  and  NGOs  since  the  end  of  1998.  RDB  has\nprovided  loans,  amounting  to  a  cumulative  total  of  $1.1  million,  to  NGOs  and  commercial\nbanks for their microcredit operations. Based on the present performance and their interest in\nhaving access  to  project funds,  a  number  of  NGOs  have  been  initially  identified  as  potential\nLFIs  participating  in  the  Project.  In  the  first  and  second  years  of  the  Project,  five  prospective\nLFIs  are  expected  to  borrow  funds  from  RDB,  including  ACLEDA,  Ennatien  Moulethan\nTchonnebat, Cambodia Community Building, Hattha Kaksekar, and a group of NGOs assisted by\nthe Catholic Relief Services (an international NGO). These prospective LFIs are domestic NGOs\nregistered  with the  Ministry of  Interior.  The  Government  will  provide  the proceeds  of  the  ADB\nloan to RDB for the credit line under a subsidiary loan agreement and for expenses relating to\nproject management support for the PMU through normal budgetary procedures.\n\n\f17\n\nRDB, as an EA, will comply with the following requirements unless the Government and\n\n59.\nADB otherwise agree:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nsatisfactory completion of an audit and full compliance with recommendations in\nthe audit;\n\nfull  compliance  with  bank  regulations  and  the  reporting  requirements  set  by\nNBC on its financial performance; and\n\n(iii)\n\nlending activities only to LFIs.\n\nRDB\u2019s  performance  as  the  EA  will  be  fully  reviewed  during  a  comprehensive  midterm  review\n(para. 74).\n\n60.\nNBC  will  assume  overall  responsibility  for  the  supervision  of  MFIs  through  its  MFI\nSupervision Division (MSD).19 A manager will be appointed to head MSD. NBC will act as an\nEA  responsible  for  MFI  supervision  under  the  Project  in  view  of  the  crucial  importance  of\nestablishing the right regulatory and supervisory framework for MFIs. NBC\u2019s Bank Supervision\nDepartment  has  recently  integrated  into  MSD  its  Supervision  Office  of  the  Decentralized\nBanking System, which handled projects of the four NGOs financed by the French Agency for\nDevelopment (AFD). NBC will compile monthly reports on the financial status and microfinance\noperations  of  MFIs.  NBC\u2019s  Bank  Supervision  Department  will  also  be  responsible  for\nmonitoring and  supervising  RDB according  to  NBC\u2019s bank  regulations.  An  organization  chart\nfor the Project is in Appendix 6.\n\n61.\nIn view of the importance of capacity building for sound institutional development, ADB\napproved  an  advisory  TA  project  (para.  25)  to  strengthen  the  technical  and  managerial\ncapabilities  of  key  institutions  involved  in  rural  financial  services.  NBC  is  an  EA  for  this  TA,\nwhich will be implemented for three years starting in early 2000.\n\n2.\n\nLicensed Financial Institutions\n\nThe  Project  will  include  financial  institutions  that  are  able  to  develop  and  provide\n62.\nsustainable microfinance services in rural areas. These institutions are mainly  NGOs  that  will\nbe licensed by NBC as financial institutions. They will develop plans that are for the duration of\nthe  Project  and  that  set  out  the  locations  of  service  outlets,  numbers  of  potential  borrowers,\nloan  volumes,  and  required financing for each  year  within  the  long-term  plan.  All  information\nwill be supported by  complete  and audited financial statements.  RDB  will  review  these  plans\ntwice  yearly  and,  in  consultation  with  the  concerned  institutions,  enter  into  a  loan  agreement\nwith  each  institution  on  a  separate  and  individual  basis.  LFIs  will  provide  rural  credit  and\nsavings services on a full cost recovery basis.\n\nThe  criteria for  an LFI\u2019s  participation  in  the  Project  and  continued  eligibility  will  be  as\n\n63.\nfollows:\n\n(i) \n\nThe  LFI  must  acquire  an  operating  license  from  NBC,  and  maintain  full\ncompliance  with  the  NBC\u2019s  relevant  regulations,  circulars,  and  reporting\nrequirements.  NBC\u2019s  regulation  for  licensing  MFIs  includes,  among  others,\n\n                                               \n19 NBC\u2019s  Bank  Supervision  Department  was  reorganized  in  January  2000  with  the  creation  of  a  division  for  the\n\nsupervision and licensing of specialized banks and MFIs.\n\n\f18\n\n(a)  a  minimum  registered  capital  of  KR250  million  ($65,000),  (b)  a  minimum\ncapital adequacy ratio of 20 percent between eligible capital and weighted risks,\n(c)  a  minimum  liquidity  ratio  of  100  percent,  and  (d)  loan  commitments  to  an\nindividual subborrower below 10 percent of the net worth of the LFI.\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\nThe  LFI  must  have  had  at  least  two  years  of  experience  in  credit  operations,\nwith the average loan recovery rate of more than 90 percent, and adequate staff\nstrength and skills for the appraisal of loan applications from subborrowers.\n\nThe  LFI  must  achieve  the  savings  mobilization  targets  established  by  the\nProject. As a percentage of loan portfolio, these will be 5.0 percent by the end of\nthe third year of participation.\n\n64.\nTo  participate  in  the  Project,  NGOs  will  need  to  become  legal  entities.  Under  the\ncurrent legislation, this is likely to mean that an NGO will become a corporate entity such as a\nlimited  liability  company.  To  register  as  an  LFI,  a  company  must  (i)  issue  a  prospectus,\n(ii)  identify  initial  shareholders,  (iii)  appoint  a  board  of  directors  and  officers,  (iv)  establish\nmemoranda or articles of association, (v) hold an initial general meeting, and (vi) issue shares.\nThe  company  may  then  apply  to  NBC  for  a  license  as  a  financial  institution,  following\nprescribed procedures. NBC\u2019s licensing procedures for an NGO will take at least five months.\nThe  prospective  LFIs,  which  are  expected  to  participate  in  the  Project,  started  preparatory\nactivities in 1998. Participation of an LFI in the Project will be subject to ADB approval.\n\n65.\nAll LFIs will be responsible to RDB for the repayment of funds borrowed from  RDB  in\naccordance  with  appropriate  agreements  to  be  entered  into  with  RDB.  The  agreements  will\nprovide that if an LFI fails to comply with the criteria in para. 63 for at least six months, RDB\nmay require the LFI to accelerate its repayment of outstanding loans to RDB. The criteria have\nbeen  explained  to  RDB  and  the  prospective  LFIs  at  the  workshops  organized  during  project\npreparation.\n\n3.\n\nRelending and Onlending Arrangements\n\nThe Government will make the proceeds of the ADB loan available to RDB in riel and\n66.\nUS dollars for credit lines under a subsidiary loan agreement. The subsidiary loan agreement\nbetween  the  Government  and  RDB  will  cover  a  period  of  20  years  and  include  a  repayment\nschedule similar to that between the Government and ADB. The cost of funds to RDB will be at\na rate not less than the ADB's ordinary capital resources (OCR) rate, which is currently at 6.46\npercent per annum. The OCR rate is considered because (i) RDB is a financial institution and\nshould pay a rate not less than a long-term rate reflected in the OCR rate, (ii) the interest rates\nquoted  in  riel  do  not  adequately  reflect  the  long-term  cost  of  funds  in  view  of  the  current\nposition of riel, and (iii) it will accommodate a fee for the  Government  to assume  any foreign\nexchange risk.\n\n67.\nRDB will onlend funds to LFIs at a rate that covers the administrative and financial risk\ncharges  appropriate  to  and  calculated  for  LFIs.  The  interest  spread  to  be  retained  by  RDB,\nincluding these charges, will be initially up to 4 percent per annum. Any change in the spread\nto be retained by RDB will be subject to approval of the Government and ADB. The loan term\nwill initially be 18 months and may be extended up to five years, including a grace period of up\nto  one  year,  subject  to  satisfactory  performance  of  the  LFI.  RDB  will  maintain  a  project\nrevolving fund  that fully  accommodates and  accounts for  all  project-related  disbursements  to\nand principal repayments from LFIs. The revolving fund will be kept as a long-term source of\n\n\f19\n\nfunds  available  to  LFIs  to  satisfy  their  needs  for  expansion  and  provide  back-up  liquidity\nsupport.\n\n68.\nInterest  rates  on  lending  by  LFIs  to  their  subborrowers  will  be  calculated  and\ndetermined  by  each  LFI  at  a  rate  sufficient  to  recover  all  operating  expenses  including\nadministrative costs, loan losses, and costs of funds. This rate will be affected by the efficiency\nof  the  LFI  and the average  size of  loans.  Based  on  the  cost  of funds from  RDB  at  about  11\npercent  per  annum,  the  expected  administrative  costs  of  15-30  percent  and  a  loan  loss\nprovision of 3-6 percent, the onlending interest rates of loans to subborrowers are expected to\nbe  within  a  common  range  of  30-40  percent  per  annum  or  flat  rates  of  2.5\u20133.3  percent  per\nmonth. These rates are significantly lower than the currently prevailing interest  rates  charged\nby moneylenders. The repayment term of loans under the Project is usually 6 months, with a\nmaximum  term  of  18  months.  The  maximum  size  of  a  loan  to  a  subborrower  will  be  $6,500\nequivalent in line with the NBC's regulation for licensing MFIs, although the average loan size\nunder  this  Project  will  be  $100.  The  interest  rates  charged  to  subborrowers  are  expected  to\ndecline  as  RDB  and  LFIs  improve  their  operational  efficiency  and  through  increased\ncompetition  among  LFIs.  These  rates  will  be  regularly  reviewed  by  the  Government,  ADB,\nNBC, and RDB. Lending to groups will not have collateral requirements while larger individual\nloans  will  require  collateral  in  accordance  with  the  policy  of  each  LFI.  These  relending  and\nonlending arrangements have been discussed with NBC, RDB, and the prospective LFIs at the\nworkshops  organized  during  project  preparation,  and  have  been  generally  accepted  by  the\nconcerned parties.\n\n69.\nRelending  from  the  Government  to  RDB  for  the  credit  line  in  US  dollars  will  also  be\ncovered in the subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and RDB for a period of 20\nyears. The annual interest rate charged to RDB will be not less than ADB's OCR rate, which is\nconsidered  to  reflect  the  long-term  cost  of  funds  in  view  of  the  current  financial  market  in\nCambodia.  Taking  into  account  the  administrative  cost  and  risk  factor  for  lending  to  LFIs,  an\nappropriate interest spread to be retained by RDB will initially be up to 4 percent per annum. The\nrepayment terms of loans for LFIs will be similar to those for the loans in riel.\n\n4.\n\nParticipation of Subborrowers\n\n70.\nSubborrowers will continue to be selected in accordance with the policies and selection\ncriteria  of  individual  LFIs  with  respect  to  the  subborrowers\u2019  business  plans,  socioeconomic\nawareness, entrepreneurial capability, and household income. Poorer households are usually\ngiven priority in the selection since poverty reduction is the most important agenda item of the\nprospective LFIs. New subborrowers will be developed by LFIs through group lending for their\nfirst-cycle borrowing. NGOs, which are currently operating microfinance schemes in Cambodia,\nhave developed their own credit policies and procedures with technical support from  external\nfunding  agencies.  Some  of  them  have  comprehensive  credit  manuals.  Selection  procedures\nusually  include  individual  interviews,  group  meetings,  community  meetings,  and  home  visits.\nCredit officers and agents of these NGOs examine the  income and expenditure patterns  and\nbusiness  plans  of  the  prospective  subborrowers  to  assess  their  loan  applications.  NGOs  in\nCambodia  recognize  the  importance  of  proper  screening  and  selection  of  subborrowers  and\nsubprojects.  They  know  that  rigorous  lending  criteria  will  ensure  viable  and  sustainable\nfinancial  intermediation,  and  the  development  of  cost-effective  savings  schemes.  Loan\nproceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  subprojects  for  the  subborrowers\u2019  income-generating\nactivities, which contribute to agriculture and rural development.\n\n\f20\n\n5.\n\nProject Performance Monitoring\n\nfor \n\ninformation \n\nthe  benchmark \n\nthe  Project.  Such \n\n71.\nRDB will be responsible for monitoring and evaluating project performance. During the\npreparation of the Project, extensive social surveys were conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Incorporation of Social Dimensions in Bank Operations.  This  information  will\nprovide \nthe\ncharacteristics of the prospective subborrowers, clientele needs and demands, capacity for on-\nfarm  and  off-farm  business  activities,  roles  of  men  and  women,  and  access  to  financial\nservices. An appropriate monitoring and evaluation  system  will  be  established at  the  PMU  to\ntrack the progress of project implementation. With assistance from consultants recruited under\nthe Project, RDB will regularly collect and compile from LFIs information on (i) the number of\nto  subborrowers  outstanding  with  LFIs,  (iii)\nsubborrowers,  (ii) \ndisbursement  and  recovery  of  loans  to  subborrowers,  (iv)  savings  mobilized,  and  (v)\nperformance  of  subprojects  financed  by  loans  from  LFIs.  This  information  will  be  used  to\nmonitor the progress of project implementation and to determine whether the Project\u2019s original\npurposes are being achieved.\n\nthe  amount  of \n\ninformation \n\nincludes \n\nloans \n\n72.\nIn  addition  to  the  progress  of  project  implementation,  RDB  will  assess  the  Project\u2019s\nimpact  based  on  data  and  information  received  from  participating  LFIs.  Detailed  benchmark\ninformation on the subborrowers with respect to their income levels, types of jobs, and poverty\nincidence  will  be  collected  and  compiled  from  LFIs.  The  reporting  formats  for  monitoring\nperformance of the Project will be developed at project inception and in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nrecent  publication  on  the  project  performance  management  system.  Enumerators  will  be\nrecruited by the PMU as required under the Project.\n\n6.\n\nProject Implementation Schedule\n\nThe Project will be implemented over five years. Project completion is expected in June\n73.\n2005. Initial activities will include the appointment of the project management staff of the PMU\nand the MFI supervision staff of MSD; procurement of service vehicles, equipment, and small\ncivil works for PMU and LFIs; staff training; and the establishment of management information\nsystems  for  PMU,  MSD,  and  LFIs.  The  project  implementation  schedule  is  summarized  in\nAppendix 7.\n\n7.\n\nComprehensive Midterm Review\n\n74.\nThe Government and ADB will jointly carry out a comprehensive review upon the earlier\nof (i) two years after loan effectiveness, or (ii) an initial amount equivalent to at least $5 million\nis disbursed. The review will cover all parameters used for assessing project performance and\nimpact, and will critically examine (i) the progress of loan disbursement; (ii) the performance of\nthe EAs; (iii) the participation and performance of LFIs and subborrowers; (iv) adequacy of the\nproject \nimplementation  schedule,  and\nprocedures; (vi) the viability of subprojects; and (vii) the project impact. Based on the outcome\nof the review, ADB will decide on the future course of project activities.\n\nimplementation  arrangements;  (v) \n\nthe  project \n\n8.\n\nProcurement\n\nThe  Project  requires  the  procurement  of  service  vehicles,  equipment,  and  small  civil\n75.\nworks for RDB. Supply contracts and civil works envisaged under the Project will be limited in\nsize  and  not  more  than  $100,000.  These  contracts  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  direct\n\n\f21\n\npurchase  or  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for\nProcurement. RDB should ensure that the goods and services procured are reasonably priced\nand suitable for project activities, and that fair  canvassing  is  done  in  selecting  suppliers.  The\nprocurement for LFIs, including service vehicles, office equipment, and safes to be delivered to\ntheir  district  branches,  will  be  done  under  loans  provided  from  RDB  to  LFIs,  and  will  be\nreasonable and cost effective under the circumstances. Procurement of goods and services by\nthe subborrowers under funds onlent from LFIs under the Project will be done through normal\ncommercial  practices  appropriate  to  the  local  trade,  in  view  of  the  large  number  of  small\nprocurement items. Fair competition and pricing among suppliers are expected in local markets\nwhere subborrowers usually purchase inputs and materials for their subprojects.\n\n9.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n76.\nConsulting services will be provided to support the PMU in project implementation. The\nconsultants will include an individual international consultant in accounting information systems\nfor six person-months, and a domestic consultant in monitoring and evaluation for nine person-\nmonths. The consultants will develop an appropriate monitoring and information system in the\nPMU.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic\nconsultants. The outline terms of reference are included in Appendix 8.\n\n10.\n\nDisbursements\n\n77.\nThe  Government  will  establish  an  imprest  fund  account  immediately  after  loan\neffectiveness for  the disbursement of  loan  proceeds  for  credit  and  for  payments  to  suppliers\nand  contractors  under  the  Project.  The  imprest  account  will  be  operated  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. Advances to the imprest account will be made based on\nRDB\u2019s  projected  expenditures.  The  imprest  account  will  be  liquidated  and  replenished\naccording  to  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures  procedures.  The  Government  contribution  for\nproject management support will be provided through its annual budget procedures.\n\n11.\n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit\n\n78.\nAt  present,  NGOs  and  commercial  banks  follow  the  reporting  systems  of  their  major\nexternal funding agencies or foreign shareholders. RDB operates a dual accounting system to\nsatisfy the Government as the owner and NBC as the supervisor. There is no universal use or\nacceptance of a standardized chart of accounts among NGOs or banks. NBC intends to obtain\nfair  and  true  presentation  of  financial  statements  of  the  financial  institutions  under  its\nsupervision by requiring that auditors of banks  (i)  are acceptable  to  NBC, and  (ii)  conform  to\nthe regulations on loan classification and loss provisions.\n\n79.\nUnder these circumstances, NBC faces difficulties in making accurate comparisons on\nthe  performance  of  banks  and  NGOs  due  to  the  differences  in  reporting  and  accounting\nformats and practices. In this regard, NBC plans to develop and require financial institutions to\nuse  a  standard  chart  of  accounts  within  a  few  years.  Since  LFIs  will  have  relatively  simple\naccounting and management information systems, it is feasible and desirable to introduce and\nimplement  a  standardized  chart  of  accounts  among  LFIs.  This  should  be  done  within  three\nyears of project inception in consultation with the Ministry of Economy and Finance, and NBC.\nSome  NGOs  have  already  introduced  the  generally  accepted  accounting  standards  and\nprocedures  with  the  assistance  of  bilateral  funding  agencies,  and  are  considering  improving\ntheir use of these procedures to meet international standards.\n\n\f22\n\n80.\nThe  PMU  will  establish  and  maintain  a  separate  account  for  expenditures  under  the\nProject  in  accordance  with  the  generally  accepted  accounting  procedures  in  Cambodia.  All\nfinancial  transactions  for  the  Project  will  be  recorded  separately  in  the  project  account  in  a\nmanner  that  allows  identification  of  expenditures  on  the  project  facilities  provided  under  the\nloan.  The project  account  and the  revolving fund account,  which  will  be  established  to  credit\nrepayments from  MFIs,  should  be  audited  annually  by  external  auditors  satisfactory  to  ADB.\nLocal  subsidiaries  of  internationally  reputable  accounting  firms  are  available  in  Cambodia.\nRDB\u2019s financial  statements  are  being  audited  annually by one of  such firms.  RDB  and  NBC,\nthrough  the PMU  and  MSD,  will  submit  to  ADB  certified  copies  of  the  audited  accounts  and\nfinancial  statements  in  the  English  language  within  nine  months  after  the  end  of  each  fiscal\nyear.  Audited  accounts  and  financial  statements  of  LFIs  participating  in  the  Project  will  be\nsubmitted to ADB upon request.\n\n81.\nThe PMU and MSD will furnish to ADB and the Government quarterly progress reports\non project implementation in a form and a level of detail that is satisfactory to ADB before the\nend  of  the  month  following  the  quarter  under  review.  These  reports  should  include  (i)\ninformation on the progress of project implementation, (ii) implementation issues encountered\nand  measures  adopted  for  resolution,  and  (iii)  assessment  of  project  goals  and  purposes\nachieved.  The  PMU\u2019s  quarterly  progress  reports  should  also  indicate  detailed  records  and\nquarterly  projections  on  operations  and  performance  of  LFIs  under  the  Project.  MSD\u2019s\nquarterly progress reports should include information on the overall financial status of LFIs and\nother matters relating to the financial sector in Cambodia. The PMU and MSD will also prepare\nand  furnish  to  ADB  and  the  Government  project  completion  reports  in  accordance  with  the\nterms of reference to be agreed between the Government and ADB within three months of the\nloan closing date or such later date as ADB may agree.\n\nF.\n\nThe Executing Agencies\n\n1.\n\nThe Rural Development Bank\n\n82.\nRDB was created by a Government subdecree in January 1998 with an initial capital of\nKR10  billion  ($2.6  million)  provided  from  Government  resources.  Its  paid-up  capital  was\nincreased to KR18.9 billion ($5.0 million) in March 2000. RDB was issued a commercial bank\nlicense  by  NBC  in  June 1998.  Under  the new  law  on banking  and financial  institutions,  RDB\nwill be licensed as a specialized bank engaged in rural finance. RDB\u2019s statute was revised in\nNovember 1999, and includes as its duties (i) provision of financing or refinancing facilities for\nMFI  and  commercial  banks  involved  in  rural  finance,  (ii)  collaboration  with  other  commercial\nbanks for agriculture and rural development, (iii) negotiation with external funding agencies for\nadequate resources to support credit operations for agriculture and rural development, and (iv)\nprovision of technical support and training for microfinance institutions.\n\n83.\nThe amended subdecree and statute of RDB accommodate the participation of private\ncommercial  banks  in  the  management  of  RDB  in  line  with  the  Government  policy  for  rural\nfinance  issued  in  December  1998.  RDB\u2019s  board  of  directors  now  includes  representatives  of\nthe  Government,  commercial  banks,  and  LFIs.  At  present,  RDB  has  a  total  of  25  staff\nmembers, including 6 with banking experience. Four officers in RDB\u2019s Credit  Department are\nprocessing and appraising loan applications.\n\n84.\nSince late 1998, improvements in RDB\u2019s management and operations have included (i)\nthe cessation of all retail lending activities; (ii) the amendment of the subdecree and the statute\n\n\f23\n\nfor RDB being solely engaged in wholesale lending; (iii) the decision to include representatives\nof private  commercial  banks  and  NGOs  on  its  board  of  directors;  and  (iv)  the  recruitment  of\nstaff  with experience  in banking,  NGO  operations,  agriculture,  and  industry.  RDB  also  has  a\nprofessional accountant and a lawyer. These improvements in RDB\u2019s institutional capability are\nexpected to be enhanced under an ADB-financed TA (para. 25). RDB has also demonstrated a\nsignificant degree of autonomy by (i) using a different system for staff salaries from that of civil\nservants, and (ii) rejecting a request from a Government ministry for a loan to expand its public\nlending program. This autonomy has been confirmed in the amended subdecree and statute.\nThe financial viability of RDB is essential for its sustainable operations.\n\n85.\nRDB will borrow funds under the Project based on a subsidiary loan agreement with the\nGovernment,  and  will  onlend  funds  to  LFIs  at  an  interest  rate  that  allows  for  cost  recovery\nrelating  to  credit.  The  amount  of  loans  to  be  disbursed  to  LFIs  will  be  decided  by  RDB  but\nsubject to NBC regulations. The financial risk of onlending to LFIs will be borne by RDB, which\nwill  be  required  to  maintain  a  sound  financial  structure  and  performance  under  the  NBC's\nsupervision. RDB is described in detail in Appendix 9.\n\n2.\n\nThe National Bank of Cambodia\n\n86.\nIn January 1996, NBC became an autonomous central  bank  with a board of directors\nresponsible  for  establishing  operational  policies  and  issuing  decisions,  regulations,  circulars,\nand  other  directives.  NBC  supervises  the  banking  system  and  is  the  banker  for  the\nGovernment.  NBC  has  four  organizational  areas:  (i)  the  General  Cashier,  (ii)  the  General\nDirection,  (iii)  the  General  Secretariat,  and  (iv)  the  General  Inspection.  As  of  the  end  of\nDecember 1998, NBC\u2019s management and staff totaled 1,075 people with 425 in the provincial\nbranches and 87 in the Foreign Trade Bank, which is still managed by NBC.\n\n87.\nBank  supervision  is  one  of  NBC\u2019s  most  important  activities.  Its  Bank  Supervision\nDepartment  was  reorganized  in  December  1999,  and  now  has  four  divisions,  for  (i)  off-site\ninspection of commercial banks; (ii) on-site inspection of commercial banks; (iii) administration,\nregulation, research, and licensing of commercial banks; and (iv) supervision and licensing of\nspecialized banks and MFIs. The Supervision Department has 38 staff including 10 staff who\nwere  recently  assigned  to  three  sections  of  the  on-site  inspection  division  for  commercial\nbanks and received brief training on on-site inspection activities. The six sections of the off-site\ninspection division supervise commercial banks. Each  section  comprising   three staff each  is\nresponsible for five commercial banks. Supervision is done by analyzing the weekly, monthly,\nquarterly, and annual reports of banks.\n\n88.\nUntil the recent reorganization, the Bank Supervision Department had a separate office,\ncalled the Supervision Office for the Decentralized Banking System, which was established by\nan  agreement  between  AFD  and  the  Government  in  November  1997.  This  office,  which\nreceived financial and  technical  support from  AFD  to  assist  four  NGOs,  has  been  integrated\ninto MSD (para. 60). MSD undertakes off-site and on-site inspection of specialized banks and\nMFIs. At present, NBC monitors the financial activities of major NGOs, which submit quarterly\nreports on a voluntary basis. Further details on NBC are in Appendix 10.\n\n\f24\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\nG.\n \n\n1.\n\nEnvironment\n\n89.\nAn  initial  environmental  examination  was  carried  out  over  a  six-week  period  during\nNovember-December 1998. During this period, field visits were undertaken to observe selected\nmicroenterprises,  and  consultations  were  held  with  the  staff  of  the  prospective  LFIs  and\nsubborrowers.  This  examination  indicated  that  adverse  environmental  impacts  from  activities\nfinanced under the Project will be insignificant or very localized individually. The Project will not\nhave  large-scale  or  intensive  adverse  environmental  impacts  unless  the  subborrowers\u2019\nactivities lead to a substantial increase in (i) the use of toxic pesticides, (ii) the exploitation of\nforests, (iii) uncontrolled quarrying, or (iv) unmanaged modification of the hydrological regime.\n\n90.\nTo minimize the risks of adverse environmental impacts, the Project will ensure sound\nenvironmental  management  through  (i)  the  provision  of  environmental  training  designed  for\ncredit  officers  and  managers  of  LFIs,  (ii)  the  dissemination  of  information  and  resources  to\nprovide  LFIs  with  access  to  alternative  measures  of  environmentally  sustainable  production\ntechnologies,  and  (iii)  possible  collaboration  with  the  Ministry  of  Environment  in  adopting\nproper  procedures  for  environmental  monitoring.  These  activities  will  be  also  used  for\nenvironmental monitoring during project implementation and in the project  completion  review.\nOne person in the PMU will be responsible for (i) organizing environmental training programs,\n(ii)  developing  a  database  for  natural  resource  management  relating  to  the  Project,  (iii)\nfacilitating  working  relations  with  LFIs  regarding  their  environment-related  activities,  and  (iv)\npromoting environmental monitoring programs among LFIs. ADB's TA will assist RDB and LFIs\nin this regard (para. 25).\n\n91.\nThe capacity for proper environmental management is still limited in Cambodia in terms\nof both the regulatory framework and skilled personnel. This limited capacity is mostly confined\nto  large-scale  industrial  enterprises.  The  institutions  relating  to  microfinance  operations  are\nnow beginning to acquire  knowledge  and  skills for  proper environmental  management.  Since\nsmall-scale enterprises in rural areas may entail threats to environment, there is a strong need\nfor  enhancing  the  capacity  of  LFIs  in  sound  environmental  management.  Such  needs  were\nfully considered during the preparation of the Project. The initial environmental examination is\nsummarized in Appendix 11.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Analysis\n\n92.\nThe  social  assessment  was  carried  out  during  project  preparation  to  establish  an\nunderstanding  about  the  intended  beneficiaries.  The  social  assessment  specifically  aimed  at\nidentifying  the  clientele,  examining  their  socioeconomic  conditions,  analyzing  their  needs  and\nabsorptive capacity in  relation to  rural financial  services,  and  examining  other  social  concerns.\nThe results of the social assessment were fully taken into account during the formulation of the\nProject.  The  field  surveys  were  conducted  for  three  weeks  during  October  1998  in  four\nrepresentative  provinces.  The  preliminary  social  assessment  results  were  presented  in\nNovember  1998  at  a  workshop  for  the  prospective  LFIs.  The  summary  social  assessment  is\npresented in Appendix 12.\n\nThe project clientele will be rural people living outside Phnom Penh, in provincial towns\n93.\nand  rural  areas.  The  sample  covered  under  the  social  assessment  had  a  high  incidence  of\npoverty or near-poverty. The sample represents a significant portion of subgroups in the client\n\n\f25\n\ngroup of the Project. The household size in the surveyed area averaged  six  people,  which  is\nslightly higher than the national average of 5.2. Eight percent of the total households surveyed\nwere headed by females, whereas the  national  average  is 25  percent.  Ninety  one  percent of\nthe population is literate to some degree. Illiteracy is higher among poorer households. Female\nilliteracy (15 percent) is higher than that of males (5 percent). Households value education for\ntheir children and they regularly save for  school fees,  even  though  this  is a  major burden on\npoor households. The cost of health care limits the access of the rural poor to health services.\nIllnesses and accidents can  result  in  major financial burdens for  the poor, forcing  the  sale  of\nassets such as land and livestock to generate funds.\n\n94.\nRural  roads  are  in  a  generally  deteriorated  condition  due  to  the  lack  of  regular\nmaintenance.  Bicycles  and  animal-drawn  carts  remain  important  modes  of  transportation  for\nmost  rural  households.  Wood,  obtained  from  public  forests,  is  the  main  source  of  energy  for\ncooking  and  other  purposes.  Scarcity  of  wood  is  an  increasingly  serious  problem  in  the  rural\narea. A regular electricity supply exists only in towns. About 30 percent of the households in the\nsurveyed area rely on storage batteries for basic electricity. Five percent own a generator, which\nis  a  highly  valued  asset  in  villages.  Poor  households  without  electricity  rely  on  kerosene  for\nlighting.  Major  economic  assets  include  land,  buildings,  gold,  livestock,  agricultural  equipment,\nand other  items such as  motorcycles,  generators,  and  televisions.  Such  assets  often  serve  as\ncollateral for  individual  loans.  Other  socioeconomic  indicators,  which  were  collected  during  the\nsocial assessment, also reflect conditions of rural poverty in Cambodia. Access to various social\nfacilities  is  limited  or  unavailable  for  most  poor  households  in  the  rural  areas.  The  rural\nhouseholds  that  are  expected  to  participate  in  the  Project  are  facing  these  constraints  to\nimproved livelihoods.\n\n95.\nThe  dominant  livelihood  is  agriculture,  predominantly  rice  farming.  Of  households\nsurveyed, 57 percent are engaged in rice cultivation. Corn, sweet potatoes, cassava, and other\nvegetables are grown as  market  crops,  but generally  on  a  small  scale. Livestock  raising  is a\nsignificant source of secondary household income. To address the needs of the rural poor, the\nProject will support the rural finance activities of NGOs whose agenda are consistent with the\nobjective of the Project to reduce rural poverty.\n\nIt is difficult  to form a  reliable  estimate  of  the poverty  incidence  in  the  surveyed area.\n96.\nHowever, using a daily income of less than KR1,210 ($0.32) per capita and the ownership of\nless  than  0.5  ha  of  agricultural  land  as  indicators  for  rural  poverty,  about  65  percent  of  the\nsurveyed  households  can  be  classified  as  poor.  Generally,  there  is  a  large  gap  between  a\nsmall number of better-off people, and people belonging to the poor and the near-poor groups,\nwho constitute the majority of rural population. Some of the better-off people become sources\nof informal credit for poorer households in the rural area. Poor people are usually engaged in\nwage  labor and  other  off-farm employment  in addition  to  agriculture  as  additional  sources  of\nincome, and need to work hard to avoid a cycle of heavy debt burden.\n\n97. Women in Cambodia have greater equality with men than women in many of ADB\u2019s other\ndeveloping member countries. Women and men have equal status under law, including the right\nto  own  land.  The  legal  status  and  rights  of  women  are  protected  under  the  Cambodian\nconstitution.  At  the  household  level,  women  are  active  and  usually  equal  participants  in\nhousehold  management  and  decision  making.  Wives  usually  handle  household  financial\ntransactions although decisions are jointly made with husbands. Women are full partners in rice\ncultivation, being engaged in activities such as transplanting seedlings from seedbeds to fields.\nBoth men and women are involved in harvesting, transporting, and  threshing.  Many other farm\nactivities are shared, such as carrying water and wood, and tending livestock. However, women\n\n\f26\n\nare traditionally less empowered than men in companies and government offices  in  Cambodia.\nSome social restrictions in terms of transportation and appearance are apparently affecting the\nmobility of women in the rural area.\n\nDuring  the  social  assessment,  nearly  all  households  showed  interest  in  borrowing  to\n98.\nsupport  income-generating  activities.  While  the  decision  to  borrow  is  a  shared  household\ndecision, women, particularly those  who are  single  and widowed,  expressed greater  interest  in\nhaving  better  access  to  credit.  Such  credit  will  be  used  to  increase  agricultural  production  or\nexpand off-farm income-generating activities. The demand for reliable savings facilities is equally\nstrong among households for better management of household budget and consumption.\n\n V.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA.\n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses\n\n99.\nFinancial  and  economic  analyses  were  conducted  for  an  indicative  sample  of\nsubprojects to be financed under the Project. The sample of subprojects used in the analyses\nincludes  retail  trading,  pig  raising,  rice  production,  small-scale  irrigation,  palm  sugar\nproduction,  small-scale  rice  milling,  silk  weaving,  and  brick  making.  These  subprojects  have\nbeen selected based on discussions with people who received loans from  NGOs for  income-\ngenerating  activities,  and on  the  social  survey  conducted during the  project  preparation.  The\nresults of the analyses are discussed below and presented in detail in Appendix 13. A financial\nprojection for RDB has been prepared separately and included in Appendix 9.\n\n1.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\na. \n\nQuantifiable Benefits\n\n100. Quantifiable benefits from the illustrative subprojects have been derived as the values\nof incremental production less the values of incremental costs. Data and information on these\nbenefits and costs were collected from credit-operating NGOs and their borrowers. In the case\nof rice production inputs, where many loans have been provided for a wide range of alternative\ninputs, additional  information  has  been  obtained  from  staff  engaged  in  agricultural  extension\nservices.  Thus,  all  the  illustrative  subprojects  are  considered  to  reflect  accurate  financial\nprojections for subprojects to be financed under the Project. The without-project situation is an\nassessment of what the subborrowers would be doing if they did  not  receive  a  loan.  For  rice\ncropping and small-scale irrigation under the without-project situation, it was assumed that less\nintensive activities would be practiced, while for pig raising it was assumed that fewer animals\nwould be raised. For all other subprojects, it was assumed that subborrowers would be unable\nto  finance  their  activities  without  loans  and  hence  would  neither  incur  costs  nor  receive\nbenefits.\n\n101. All  subproject  models  exclude  any  allowance  for  interest  on  credit  to  calculate  their\nfinancial internal rates of return (FIRR). FIRRs have been calculated for individual subprojects\nwith longer term duration. The FIRRs range from 23 percent to 91 percent, and show that the\nsubprojects are financially viable given the current real interest rate of about 20 percent. These\nsubprojects  use  family  labor,  thus  incurring  substantially  low  labor  costs.  Even  under  the\nfinancially  most  conservative  scenario  for  labor  based  on  the  market  wage  rate  of  about\nKR4,000 ($1) per day, subprojects will  be generally  viable except for  small-scale  rice  milling.\nThe results of calculations are shown in Table A13.1 of Appendix 13.\n\n\f27\n\n102. Sensitivity  analyses  were  carried  out  to  assess  the  financial  viability  of  multiyear\nsubprojects under adverse project scenarios relating to an increase in the investment cost and\na  decrease  in  the  revenue  (Appendix 13).  Although  there  are  considerable  variations  among\nthe  selected  subprojects,  their  financial  viability  remains  strong  under  these  scenarios.\nSubprojects  of  pig  raising,  small-scale  rice  milling,  and  palm  sugar  production  are  relatively\nmore  sensitive  to  changes  in the  investment  cost  and  revenue.  The borrowers\u2019  responses  to\nthe conditions of local markets are usually quick through changes in their types of activities.\n\n103. Based on the business plans of the prospective LFIs, about 260,000 rural households\nare likely to benefit from the Project. More than 70 percent of these households are expected\nto be  poor  households.  The  project  impact  on  employment  will  depend  on  the  numbers  and\ntypes of subprojects to be financed and the incremental labor-days generated. The incremental\nemployment expected from each subproject type is indicated in  Table A13.2  of  Appendix  13.\nAssuming that the composition of types of subprojects under the Project will be similar to that\nof NGOs\u2019 current credit operations and that the Project will have average loans outstanding of\n70  percent  of  disbursement  from  the  total  amount  of  loans  for  subprojects,  the  Project  is\nexpected to generate about 66,000 jobs.\n\nb.\n\nTransaction and Administration Costs\n\nTransaction  costs  are  not  significant  as  most  programs  of  credit-operating  NGOs\n104.\nprovide  services  at  the  village  level,  thus  minimizing  travel  costs  to  their  borrowers  and\nreducing their risk of loan default. Where the borrowers  have  to  travel  to  provincial  or district\ncenters  to obtain  loans,  the  distance  involved  is  relatively  short.  Neither  compulsory  savings\nnor  physical  collateral  are  featured  in  most  of  the  credit  programs.  The  social  assessment\nconducted for the Project reported that only 5 percent of loans from NGOs are secured against\nthe  collateral  of  a  house,  land  certificate,  or  gold,  while  the  remaining  loans  are  secured\nthrough group guarantee. Experience of NGOs is that collateral is of little direct value since it is\ndifficult to seize in cases of default.  Overall transaction  costs  are  minimal and  no  increase  is\nanticipated under the Project.\n\n105. At  present,  the  credit  administration  costs  of  the  prospective  LFIs,  particularly  staff\nexpenses, are still high at more than 40 percent of loans outstanding. With the growth in their\nloan  portfolios,  these  costs  are  expected  to  decline  to  industry  standards  by  the  end  of  the\nProject. Staff expenses account for about half of administration expenses of these prospective\nLFIs. LFI administrative expenses are expected to drop substantially during the project period,\nand  this  reduction  in  the  administrative  expenses  will  be  reflected  in  the  reduction  in  the\ninterest rate to be charged to subborrowers. By expanding the operations of LFIs, the Project\nwill provide the rural poor with easier access to credit facilities.\n\nc.\n\nImpact on Financial Institutions\n\n106.\nLFIs  participating  in  the Project,  including  MFIs,  will  be  strengthened by  their need  to\ncomply  with  financial  structures  and  performance  as  stipulated  in  the  regulations  to  be\nenforced by NBC. By being required to demonstrate profitability, LFIs will be able to attract a\ndiverse  range  of  funding  sources  and  financing  terms  from  depositors,  external  funding\nagencies,  commercial  lenders, and  equity  investors.  This  diversity  will  strengthen  the  liability\nstructure  of  LFIs  necessary  for  their  long-term  and  sustainable  expansion  of  assets  and\nservices.  In  providing  savings  facilities,  LFIs  will  improve  financial  intermediation  within  rural\ncommunities and encourage funds to flow toward better yielding investments. The provision of\nsavings  facilities  will  allow  many  rural  households  to  accumulate  and  hold  liquidity  in  a  safe\n\n\f28\n\nand attractive manner. In playing a more significant role within communities, LFIs will become\nmore responsive to the financial needs and opportunities of rural communities.\n\nd.\n\nWillingness to Pay\n\n107. Excellent repayment records achieved by NGOs in Cambodia provide strong evidence\nof borrowers\u2019 willingness to pay when services are provided in a timely  and  efficient  manner,\nand  where  the  ongoing  availability  of  loans  is  assured.  Seven  of  10  major  NGOs  reported\naverage loan recovery rates in 1997 and 1998 in excess of 90 percent. In situations where a\nfollow-on  loan  cannot  be  assured,  as  has  been  frequently  encountered  with  short-duration\nproject activities, borrowers show some reluctance to repay their loans. The provision of longer\nterm credit lines through RDB is essential to strengthen the activities of LFIs. NGOs also agree\nthat  financing  vehicles  and  equipment  for  their  capacity  building  under  the  Project  on  credit\nrather than as a grant will encourage more rigorous assessments of their own needs.\n\n2.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\nthe  main \n\n108. Economic analyses have been carried out for the same subprojects as those included\nin  the  financial  analysis.  Economic  prices  for \ninputs  and  outputs\n(predominantly  rice  and  fertilizer)  are  based  on  the  latest  World  Bank  commodity  price\nprojections,  adjusted  to  constant  1998  values  prior  to  adjusting  to  farmgate  values.  Minor\ntraded  and  nontraded  inputs  and  outputs  have  been  converted  to  economic  values  using  a\nstandard conversion factor of 0.9 in accordance with the current ADB  practice for  Cambodia.\nThe economic cost of labor is estimated using a shadow wage rate of 0.75 for employed labor,\nwhich  is  usually  unskilled  or  semiskilled,  reflecting  the  limited  alternative  opportunities  in\nCambodia.  The  shadow  wage  rate  for  family  labor  is  0.95,  reflecting  the  availability  of\nalternative wage labor and greater entrepreneurial skills.\n\ntraded \n\nThe  estimated  economic  rates  of  return  are  summarized  in  Table  A13.1  of  Appendix\n109.\n13. The sample subprojects included in the analysis are considered to be economically viable.\nMicro-  and  small-scale  processing  and  manufacturing  appear  to  be  the  most  economically\nviable activities with economic internal rates of return  ranging from  13  percent  to  62 percent.\nSensitivity analyses of the economic internal rates of return were also conducted for changes\nin the investment costs and revenue of subprojects (Table A13.3 of Appendix 13). The results\nshow  that  subprojects  for  pig  raising  and  palm  sugar  production  are  more  sensitive  to  the\nincrease  in  investment  costs  and  the  decrease  in  revenue,  and  require  careful  planning  for\ninvestment. The economic viability of other subprojects remains strong under adverse project\nscenarios.\n\n110. Subborrowers are expected to benefit directly from subprojects, which will provide them\nwith  confidence  for  further  expansion.  LFIs  will  derive  substantial  benefits  by  demonstrating\nsustainable  financial  services  and  expanding  their  clientele.  Similarly,  the  strengthening  of\nRDB\u2019s  banking  skills  and  financial  management,  and  the  supervisory  capacity  of  NBC,  will\nenhance their management of microfinance projects and programs, and support for LFIs.\n\nB.\n\nEnvironment\n\n111.\nThe environmental impact of the Project  will  be positive. By  installing  sound  practices\nfor  environmental  management  in  microfinance  activities  of  the  prospective  LFIs,  the  Project\nwill be able to avoid adverse environmental impacts and to safeguard and enhance the natural\nresource  base  in  the  country.  RDB  staff  engaged  in  credit  operations  and  LFI  staff  will  gain\n\n\f29\n\nawareness  of  environmental  concerns  in  rural  areas.  They  are  expected  to  learn  a  set  of\nanalytical tools for assessing the environmental impact of subprojects. The PMU will have an\nofficer  responsible  for  environmental  concerns  to  ensure  that  subprojects  are  adequately\nmonitored.  Functional  linkages  will  be  developed  between  environmental  and  financial\ninstitutions.  LFIs  participating  in  the  Project  will  gain  improved  access  to  the  existing\nCambodian  technical  expertise  to  support  sustainable  resource  management  approaches  in\ntheir activities.\n\nC.\n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n1.\n\nPoverty Reduction\n\nIn Cambodia, the Government has explicitly  committed to the reduction of rural poverty\n112.\nas its most important development objective (para. 21). The Project will greatly contribute to this\npolicy  objective  by  providing  small-scale  income-generating  activities  and  sustainable  savings\nfacilities  for  rural  households,  which  constitute  about  90  percent  of  the  poor  population  in  the\ncountry. At present, there are no safe and credible savings facilities to hold liquid assets to meet\ntheir  emergency  or  seasonal  needs.  The  financial  needs  of  most  rural  households  are  being\naccommodated by borrowing from individual  lenders, who charge  high  interest  rates  on  funds,\noften up to 10 percent per month. High costs of funds make it difficult to escape from the poverty\ncycle. In view of the strong demand for effective rural financial services, NGOs are considering\nexpanding their  coverage and  transforming  into LFIs.  The five prospective  LFIs  (para.  58)  that\nhave  been  initially  identified  to  participate  in  the  Project  will  be  working  in  at  least  15  larger\nprovinces during the project period, which cover 93 percent of the total  rural households  in  the\ncountry.\n\n113. As  reflected  in  the  social  assessment,  the  prospective  beneficiaries  have  shown  a\nstrong  demand  for  borrowing,  and,  despite  the  NGOs\u2019  expanding  coverage,  there  is  a  large\namount of unmet demand for  credit  in  the  rural  area.  Poor  rural  households  will  benefit from\nthe  Project  through  increased  availability  and  reliability  of  a  range  of  credit  and  savings\nservices  to  be  provided  through  LFIs.  The  availability  of  these  financial  services  will\nsubstantially contribute to the improvement of rural women's livelihoods by providing financial\nsupport for their on-farm and off-farm income-generating activities. The Project will build upon\nthe  initiatives  of  NGOs  to  address  social  issues  among  the  rural  poor  in  line  with  the  LFIs\u2019\nrespective  agenda  for  poverty  reduction.  The  Project  will  support  the  expansion  of  LFIs\u2019\noutreach in both credit and savings, and strengthen LFIs\u2019 operational sustainability.\n\n2.\n\nCommunity-Based Rural Finance\n\n114.\nThe Project will be implemented based on an approach where financial intermediaries\noperate close to the communities they serve. This approach will enable these intermediaries to\nidentify specific constraints to the improvement of the communities\u2019 rural livelihoods. LFIs are\nexpected  to  provide  rural  people  with  a  wide  range  of  services  along  with  rural  finance.  In\naddition, their activities and outreach in community development will be expanded in both width\nand  depth by transforming  themselves  into  LFIs, and  will  contribute  to  the  broadening  of  the\nrural economic base. The mobilization of savings within rural communities will expand the local\nresource  base  for  further  investment  in  economic  activities  and  provide  the  rural  poor  with\nbetter access to safe and credible savings facilities.\n\n\fD.\n\nRisks\n\n30\n\n115.\nThe major risk is that RDB will be used for policy or directed lending operations. If used\nin  this  way,  for  example  to  provide  loans  directly  to  some  farmers  at  below-market  rates  of\ninterest, RDB would not be able to survive as a viable financial institution for many years. As\nseen in other developing countries, such institutions will then require some form of institutional\nrehabilitation,  which  will  usually  result  in  failure.  This  situation  would  actually  be  against  the\nGovernment\u2019s policy and strategy for rural credit in Cambodia. Thus, RDB  will  be  required to\nretain  its  viability  as  a  wholesale  financial  institution  under  the  Project.  RDB\u2019s  role  as  a\nwholesaler of commercially and externally sourced funds is important so that RDB can attract\nand fully service open market funding, especially in domestic markets, for agriculture and rural\ndevelopment.  The  Project  has  included  a  specific  loan  covenant  to  ensure  the  wholesaling\nfunction of RDB. The subdecree and the statute of RDB clearly indicate this function. RDB is\nalso expected to develop financial linkages with other commercial banks by acting as a catalyst\nbetween the overall financial sector in the country and LFIs.\n\n116. ADB also considers that the capabilities of institutions relating to the Project, including\nRDB,  NBC,  and  LFIs,  should  be  strengthened  in  collaboration  with  other  external  funding\nagencies  in  Cambodia.  Sound  institutional  development  is  essential  for  the  establishment  of\nsustainable financial services in the rural area. In conjunction with the Project, an advisory TA\nhas been provided (para. 25).\n\nA.\n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness\n\nVI.\n\n ASSURANCES\n\nThe Government has given the following assurances, which  have  been  incorporated  in\n\n117.\nthe legal documents:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(i)\n\nPrior to loan effectiveness, the subsidiary loan agreement, in form and substance\nsatisfactory  to  ADB,  will  be  duly  executed  and  delivered  on  behalf  of  the\nGovernment  and  RDB,  and  become  fully  effective  and  binding  on  the  parties\nthereto in accordance with its terms.\n\nPrior  to  loan  effectiveness,  RDB  will  provide  ADB  with  a  satisfactory  five-year\ncorporate  plan  that  includes  corporate  goals,  strategies,  and  an  implementation\nplan, and is supported by its projected financial statements.\n\nPrior  to  loan  effectiveness,  NBC  will  assign  at  least  five  full-time  staff  for\nsupervision of LFIs.\n\nB.\n\nOther Specific Assurances\n\n118. Other specific assurances of the Government required during project implementation are\nas follows:\n\nWithin three months of loan effectiveness, the Government will establish a PCC,\nwhich will meet at  least twice yearly and function as a central-level coordination\nbody  to  support  project  activities  by  providing  overall  policy  guidance  and\ndirections  for  project  implementation,  and  by  helping  resolve  any  outstanding\nissues.\n\n\f31\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv) \n\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n\nRDB will confine its role to being a wholesaler of funds only through LFIs. In this\ncontext,  the  Government  and  RDB  will  transfer  any  loans  made  to  any  entities\nthat are not licensed by NBC as financial institutions, from the RDB\u2019s accounts to\nanother bank, financial institution, fund, or organization.\n\nRDB will operate  in  a  self-sustained  manner  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  new\nrural credit policy, and will, at all times, conform fully to  the  law on banking and\nfinancial institutions and banking regulations with respect to its financial structure\nand prudential ratios as stipulated by NBC.\n\nRDB will maintain its policy for the classification of loans and loan write-offs, and\nprocedures for their implementation, in compliance with NBC regulations.\n\nLoan proceeds through the credit line will be held in a revolving fund accessible\nsolely by LFIs.\n\nRDB  will  submit  to  ADB  annual  financial  statements  audited  by  an  external\nauditor satisfactory to ADB, together with the description of specific measures in\nresponse to the auditor\u2019s opinions.\n\nVII.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nI  am  satisfied that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\n119.\nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to\nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  14,872,000  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Rural  Credit  and\nSavings  Project,  with  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  with  an\ninterest charge at the rate of 1.0 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5  percent\nper annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance\nwith those set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the Board.\n\n31 March

NBC\nperformed both central and commercial bank functions through its network of 20 provincial\nbranches. By Decree No. 58 dated 26 July 1989, the Government allowed the formation of\nprivate commercial banks as limited liability companies. In 1991, the first private commercial\nbank  was  established as  a  joint  venture between  NBC  and  the Siam  Commercial  Bank  of\nThailand. Subsequently, a law on the supervision of financial institutions was passed by the\nNational  Assembly  on  27  August  1992,  which  was  followed  on  16  November  1992  by  a\nsubdecree on the supervision of commercial banks. These laws and regulations formed the\nlegal framework for commercial banks in Cambodia until November 1999 when the new law\non banking and financial institutions was enacted.\n\n2.\nWith  the  privatization  of  the  banking  sector  and  the  discontinuance  of  NBC  as  a\ncommercial  bank,  farmers  and  entrepreneurs  with  small  and  medium  landholdings  and\nbusinesses  were  suddenly  deprived  of  access  to  financial  services.  The  impact  of  this\nsudden  disruption  in  the  provision  of  small-scale  finance  was  partly  alleviated  by  the\nintroduction of nonlicensed credit providers under the credit and savings schemes supported\nby  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  and  through  credit-delivery  nongovernment\norganizations  (NGOs).  In  most  areas  outside  Phnom  Penh,  farmers  and  small-scale\nbusinesses  still  depend  for  credit  on  individual  moneylenders,  including  relatives  and\nmiddlemen in trade.\n\n2.\n\nLicensed Commercial Banks\n\n3.\nAs of December 1999, Cambodia had 31 operating licensed banks with total assets\nof  KR2,097  billion  ($552  million),  an  increase  of  about  21  percent  since  the  end  of\nDecember  1998.  Loans  outstanding  at  these  commercial  banks  amount  to  KR751  billion\n($198  million)  or  an  increase  of  14  percent  from  1998.  Of  total  commercial  lending,  more\nthan  90  percent  was  in  foreign  currencies  mostly  in  US  dollars.  Classified  by  type  of\nbusiness,  the  largest  amount  of  lending  was  for  wholesale  and  retail  trade  (26  percent),\nfollowed  by  services  and  personal  consumption  (25  percent),  manufacturing  (22  percent),\nimport and export (14 percent), and other miscellaneous activities (13 percent). Agriculture-\nrelated  businesses  comprised  about  KR31  billion  ($8  million)  or  4  percent  of  total  lending\nthrough 12 banks. As of the end of December 1999, deposits held in banks totaled KR1,150\nbillion  ($303  million),  of  which  93  percent  was  held  in  foreign  currencies,  mainly  in  US\ndollars. There has been  little  change  in  the  proportion  of  deposits held  in foreign  currency\nover the last three years. Demand deposits comprise 37 percent of total deposits.\n\nTwo  banks,  the  Foreign  Trade  Bank  and  the  Rural  Development  Bank  (RDB),  are\n4.\nGovernment-owned while other banks are all privately owned. Of these private commercial\nbanks,  four  are  fully  owned  by  domestic  interests  while  the  remainder  has  full  or  partial\nforeign ownership. Fully domestically owned banks comprise 34 percent of the total assets\nof  the  banking  sector  and  share 19  percent  of  consolidated  profits.  Outside  Phnom  Penh,\nthere  are  18 bank branches  in nine provinces. Since bank  branches  are  located  in  towns,\nonly 10 percent of total households in Cambodia and 64 percent of urban households have\nreasonably good access  to formal banking  services.  In the  nine provinces  served by bank\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 2\n\nbranches  outside  Phnom  Penh,  there  are  about  64,000  households  per  bank  branch  on\naverage while in Phnom Penh, where there are 36 banks and bank branches, the figure is\n4,800 households per bank branch.\n\nThe banking sector grew marginally in real terms from 1998 to 1999 due to political\n5.\nstability  in  Cambodia.  The  average  net  worth  per  bank  is  KR25.0  billion  ($6.6  million).\nAverage  total  assets  per  bank  is  KR68.0  billion  ($17.9  million).  For  the  year  ending  31\nDecember 1999, the 10 largest banks had a return on equity of 4.0 percent and a return on\ntotal  assets  of  1.5  percent.  The  volume  of  total  deposits  increased  by  29  percent  for  the\nbanking sector since the end of December 1998.\n\n3.\n\nNonlicensed Financial Services\n\na.\n\nNongovernment Organizations\n\n6.\nAs  of  the  end  of  December  1999,  25  NGOs  listed  by  NBC  had  total  loans\noutstanding  of  approximately  KR80.3  billion  ($21.1  million),  see  Appendix  3.  The  total\nnumber  of  borrowers  was  about  255,200  or  11  percent  of  total  rural  households.  NGOs\ncurrently  charge  effective  interest  rates  between  36-72  percent,  or  3-6  percent  flat  per\nmonth on their lending. Larger NGOs and those making loans to individual borrowers have\nlower interest rates on their lending. Administrative costs are often more than 40 percent of\naverage loans outstanding with an overall average for the five largest NGOs at 25 percent.\nThis  excludes  the  cost  of  technical assistance financed by  external funding agencies  as  a\ngrant.  Loan  recovery  rates  are  80-100  percent,  and  the  average  rate  for  the  five  largest\nNGOs is 96 percent.\n\nb.\n\nProject-Supported Services\n\nRural  credit  provided  through  the  United  Nations  Children's  Fund,  the  Ministry  of\n7.\nWomen's Affairs, and the European Union, amount to $1.49 million in loans outstanding and\ncovers 47,470 borrowers. The largest portion is under the program of the European Union,\nwith  $1.25  million  in  loans  outstanding  to  28,000  borrowers.  The  initial  focus  of  these\nprograms was the provision of emergency relief, and has now been directed to sustainability\nand institutional issues.\n\nc.\n\nTraders and Individual Moneylenders\n\n8.\nAccording  to  a  recent  socioeconomic  survey  in  1996,  only  1  percent  of  the  rural\nhouseholds  that  took  loans  between  1994  and  1995  received  loans  from  licensed\ncommercial  banks.  The  remaining  households  received  loans  from  NGOs  and  informal\nmoneylenders,  including  traders  and  relatives.  Of  these  loans  from  informal  sources,  37\npercent were used for agricultural production or investment in small-scale businesses. Other\nloans were used for meeting emergency expenses such as medical expenses for the family.\nInterest  rates  on  loans from  informal  sources  are  high,  often  up  to  10  percent  per  month.\nDespite high interest rates, borrowers continue to depend on informal sources for a variety\nof  reasons  including  ease  of  access,  flexibility  in  loan  repayment  terms,  personal\nrelationships, and lack of alternatives.\n\nB.\n\nLegislation\n\n9.\nTo provide a comprehensive legal framework for the banking sector and to  support\nthe  development  and  strengthening  of  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs),  the  Government\n\n\fAppendix 2, page 3\n\nintroduced a new law on banking and financial institutions (in November 1999) and related\nregulations. This was followed by a set of regulations appropriate to MFIs. The Government\nis committed to strengthening NBC's licensing,  regulation, and  supervision of  MFIs.  RDB\u2019s\nsubdecree was revised in November 1999 to stipulate that it would operate as a wholesale\nbank to channel funds to licensed financial institutions, which are engaged in rural finance.\nTo  facilitate  the  provision  of  rural  financial  services  in  remote  areas,  the  Government  will\ncontinue  to  monitor  credit  activities  of  NGOs  and  community-based  organizations,  and  to\nencourage  their  linkage  to  licensed  MFIs  or  their  efforts  to  become  licensed  institutions.\nCommercial interest rates, liberalized by NBC under a subdecree issued on 16 March 1995,\nwill  continue  to  be  determined  by  commercial  banks  according  to  each  bank's  policy  and\nfinancial performance. This liberalized interest policy will be extended to cover MFIs.\n\nUnder the new law on banking and financial institutions, financial services of NGOs\n10.\ncan  be  converted  into  formal  financial  transactions  under  NBC\u2019s  supervision.  This  will\nincrease public confidence in their financial services and encourage  the expansion  of  their\nactivities.  NGOs  are  also  expected  to  register  with  whatever  Government  ministries  are\nrelevant  to  their  scope  of  activities.  Domestic  NGOs  are  registered  with  the  Ministry  of\nInterior, and international NGOs are registered with various ministries including the Ministry\nof  Foreign  Affairs.  Prior  to  applying  for  an  MFI  license,  NGOs  will  need  to  incorporate  as\nlegal  entities,  mostly  as  limited  liability  public  companies.  Since  1998,  NGOs,  which  are\nexpected  to  participate  in  the  Project,  had  started  identifying  shareholders  needed  for\nincorporation as companies. At least five licensed financial institutions will be participating in\nthe Project.\n\n\fCREDIT AND SAVINGS OPERATIONS OF NGOS\n\nAppendix 3, page 1\n\nA.\n\nDescription of Nongovernment Operations\n\nThe Cooperation Committee for Cambodia reports that 296 nongovernment organizations\n1.\n(NGOs) are registered with the  Government, of which 163 are domestic and 133 foreign. In\naddition, 100 NGOs are not registered with the Government but are operating in Cambodia.1\nAbout 90 NGOs are engaged in credit operations. At present, the Supervision Department of the\nNational Bank of Cambodia (NBC) monitors financial activities of major credit-operating NGOs.\nAccording to NBC\u2019s records and individual reports from these NGOs, as of 31 December 1999,\n25 major credit-operating NGOs had KR80.3 billion ($21.1 million) in lending to about 255,200\nborrowers (Table A3.1) and total savings of KR2.2 billion ($579,000) or about 3 percent of loans\noutstanding. NBC also monitors the activities of two project-based rural credit schemes of the\nGovernment. A review of the nine largest NGOs showed that between 1996 and 1999, total\nloans outstanding increased from KR18.2 billion ($4.8 million) to KR76.0 billion ($20.0 million)\nand the number of borrowers from 78,000 to 192,000. Major NGOs in Cambodia confirmed the\nhigh levels of unsatisfied demand for credit and feel that they need to expand their activities\nrapidly at least in the medium term.\n\n2.\nSavings services remain weak, with few NGOs putting emphasis on the mobilization of\npublic savings. In general, borrower groups and communities are reluctant to manage savings\nby  themselves  because  of  security  problems  and  potential  conflicts  that  may  arise  in  their\ncommunities. Access to savings is usually only upon withdrawal from group savings. At present,\nthe  new  law  on  banking  and  financial  institutions  provides  a  legal  basis  for  the  savings\noperations of NGOs for (i) the protection of depositors and creditors; (ii) reporting needs of NBC,\nwhich is charged with the duty of monitoring macroeconomic aggregates including credit creation\nand mobilization of savings; and (iii) the question of clear accountability in the event of legal\ncases. However, NGOs have not launched on full-scale savings schemes.\n\n3.\nNGO lending is usually carried out through village banks and borrower groups, and to\nindividual  borrowers.  A  common  approach  involves  (i)  group  formation,  (ii)  motivation  and\ntraining, and (iii) formation of a larger village-based association consisting of all groups in the\nvillage. Mutual guarantee groups are formed by the villagers themselves with the assistance of\nan NGO and occasionally with the assistance of a village development committee. There are no\nintervillage associations for credit operations. In a village, the membership of the association\nvaries from 90 to 200, often involving most households in the village. One household is usually\nrepresented by one member, who does not have to be a borrower. A credit committee is also set\nup  with  heads  of  all  group  leaders,  from  whose  ranks  a  president  and  a  vice-president  are\nelected. These two people are responsible for major decisions such as the formation of new\ngroups. They are also responsible for collections. Mutual guarantee is now a familiar mechanism\nto ensure loan repayment. Group members are held jointly responsible for loans. Failure of one\nperson to comply with rules and regulations or to meet financial obligations may result in the\nexclusion of all members from the association.\n\nGroup lending is also carried out without the use of a village association, for instance,\n4.\nas  in  the  case  of  the  Association  of  Cambodian  Local  Economic  Development  Agencies\n(ACLEDA). Group loans from ACLEDA are denominated in riel and are provided through groups\nof borrowers, predominantly women, being formed with 3-10 members. At the end of December\n1999, 94 percent of ACLEDA\u2019s active group loan borrowers were women. Prior to receiving loan\n\n                                               \n1  A comprehensive list of NGOs in Cambodia is provided in two documents of Cooperation Committee for Cambodia:\n\nDirectory of International Humanitarian Assistance in Cambodia, and Directory of Cambodian NGOs.\n\n\fAppendix 3, page 2\n\nservices, each group receives six hours of training on the use of credit funds. Groups are formed\nfrom members  within the  same  community following a briefing from ACLEDA staff.  A  group\nleader appointed by group members is responsible for collecting loan repayments weekly or\nmonthly and making these payments to the ACLEDA office. For this service, the group leader\nreceives a commission of 1 percent of repayments.\n\n5.\nMany  NGOs  provide  for  lending  to  individuals  but,  except  for  ACLEDA  and  Hattha\nKaksekar  (HK),  this  is  a  negligible  part  of  their  total  loan  portfolio.  The  size  of  the  loan  for\nindividuals is usually $300-$2,000, mostly denominated in US dollars.\n\nB.\n\nParticipating Licensed Financial Institutions\n\n6.\nBased on the present performance of their credit operations and interest in having access\nto the project funds as licensed financial institutions (LFIs), five NGOs have been identified for\nparticipation in the Project: ACLEDA; Cambodia Community Building (CCB); a group of local\nNGOs affiliated with the Catholic Relief Services (CRS) International and funded by the United\nStates Agency for International Development (USAID); HK; and Ennatien Moulethan Tchonnebat\n(EMT). All of these NGOs are expected to become LFIs during the first two years of the Project.\nThe financial performance and projections for these institutions show that their operations will\ncontinue to be viable over the project period. The Project will cover the operations of LFIs initially\nin  the  northwestern,  eastern,  and  southern  regions  where  major  NGOs  are  currently  active\n(Table A3.2).\n\n7.\nACLEDA is expected to obtain a license from NBC in April 2000 and, for this purpose,\ntechnical assistance is being provided by a consortium of external funding agencies consisting\nof  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  USAID,  and  the  International  Finance\nCorporation. This assistance covers banking management, banking organization, accounting\nsystems,  computer  systems  review,  management \ninformation  systems,  and  product\ndevelopment. Through a head office in Phnom Penh, ACLEDA now provides services at 27\nbranches in 12 provinces. It will open two more branches in Kompong Chhnang and Svay Rieng\nprovinces by 2001. As of 31 December 1999, total loans outstanding were about KR51.8 billion\n($13.6 million) to 58,355 borrowers, of which about 17 percent are individual borrowers. Interest\nrates are 5.0 percent per month for group loans and 4.0 percent per month for individual loans\nboth on a flat basis. Individual loans in US dollars carry lower rates. Average loan disbursement\nper  borrower  in  1999  was  $1,497  for  individual  borrowers  and  $138  for  group  borrowers.\nACLEDA has generated net profits from its financial transactions since 1998. ACLEDA plans to\nachieve a loan portfolio of at least $43 million during the project period with 118,000 borrowers.\n\n8.\nEMT, the local counterpart of the French NGO  Groupe de Recherche et d'Echanges\nTechnologique (GRET), was formed in 1996 to take over its microfinance operations. At present,\nGRET is providing EMT with technical support for its rural finance activities. EMT will apply for\na license as an MFI following its incorporation (expected in 2000), and will have GRET and at\nleast five other major shareholders. EMT is also being assisted for its transformation to an LFI\nby  the  Government  of  France  through  a  technical  assistance  project.  EMT  currently  has\noperations in six provinces through 18 district branches with about 56,600 borrowers, and plans\nto expand its outreach to 150,000 borrowers by the end of the project period. It expects to be\nable  to  expand  loans  outstanding  from  around  $1.8  million  in  1999,  with  an  average  loan\noutstanding per borrower of $32, to $7.6 million in 2005. The interest rate on lending is 4 percent\nper month on a declining basis. For 1998, EMT made a nominal profit subject to interest charges\non  subordinate  loans  received  from  the  Government  of  France  through  the  Government  of\nCambodia.\n\n\fAppendix 3, page 3\n\nThe  CRS,  with  USAID  funding,  carries  out  a  number  of  functions  including  (i)  direct\n9.\nsavings  and  credit  services  through  two  branch  offices  in  two  provinces,  (ii)  a  partnership\nprogram  for  strengthening  domestic  NGOs  in  credit  and  savings  operations,  and  (iii)\ndevelopment of NGOs interested in microfinance operations. For these activities, CRS receives\nsubstantial support from CRS International and USAID. CRS plans to increase its number of\npartner NGOs from 7 to 12 by 2005. In forming a licensed MFI, some of these partners could\nbecome shareholders in a conglomerate MFI. The total number of CRS borrowers is projected\nto rise to over 80,000 in 2005 from the current level of about 31,600. In parallel, the average\nportfolio is expected to increase to about $5.0 million in 2005. There will be a parallel increase\nin the number of borrowers of partner NGOs, which will form a conglomerate MFI. The average\nloan outstanding per borrower is $43. The interest rate on a flat basis is 3.0 percent per month\nfor loans in riel. CRS credit operations are expected to remain viable.\n\n10.\nThe  main  orientation  of  HK  is  the  provision  of  rural  financial  services  involving  both\nsavings  and  credit.  HK  began  as  a  project  of  Oxfam-Quebec  in  1995.  HK  combines  group\nlending  with  individual  loans.  HK's  experience  with  individual  loans  has  been  good  by\nconcentrating its focus on individual loans ranging from $50 to $500 and averaging $162. HK is\nalso considering an increase in the ceiling of the loan amount to about $1,000. Lending is in US\ndollars at a flat interest rate of 3.0 percent per month, has about 3,700 borrowers, and expects\nto have  over  8,000  by  2005.  The  number  of  savers  is  expected  to  grow  more  rapidly,  from\naround  3,200  to  more  than  10,000 over  the  same  period.  The  current  loan  disbursement  is\n$650,000 per year which is also projected to exceed $2 million by 2005. HK has two provincial\nbranches and one district branch, and expects to have four and six respectively, in 2005. HK has\nreceived technical assistance, especially from CARE International, in financial management and\nmanagement  information  systems.  Training  activities  have  included  policy  formulation  for\ncorporate management, asset and portfolio management, management of cash and information\nflows, financial reconciliation, and reporting.\n\n11.\nCCB was created by an international NGO, the World Relief, which has been carrying out\nmicrofinance activities in Cambodia with support from USAID since 1992. CCB will take over the\nfinancial services of the World Relief, which will continue to provide technical support to CCB.\nA board of directors was established for CCB, which envisages being transformed into an LFI.\nHowever, at the end of 1999, CCB had an internal dispute, which will delay the procedures for\nbecoming a licensed institution. CCB has 13,600 clients with KR3.4 billion ($0.9 million) in loans\noutstanding and plans to expand its activities with one new branch each year until 2005. The\ntotal number of borrowers is projected to rise to over 35,000 by the end of the project period with\na loan portfolio of $2.7 million. At present, CCB\u2019s clients are all poor women. The loan size for\nfirst time borrowers ranges from $22 to $39. For subsequent borrowers, the maximum loan size\nis $240 and may rise to about $400 by the end of the project period. Lending in riel is at a flat\ninterest rate of 4.0 percent per month. There is 1.0 percent rebate for prompt repayment. The\ninterest  rate  on  a  dollar  loan  is  2.0  percent  per  month  also  on  a  flat  basis.  CCB\u2019s  savings\nmobilization is modest; constituting some 25 percent of net loans outstanding, but is projected\nto rise to 30 percent during the project period.\n\n\f \n\na\nLFI\n\nKR m.\n\n%\n\nNo.\n\nNGO\n\nProspective\n\n  Loans Outstanding\n\n          Borrowers\n\nAvg.loan out/Borrower\n\nb \n\n \n\nTable A3.1: 25 Large NGO Credit-Providers\n\n     31 December 1999\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n \n\n64.5\n51,790\n8.7\n6,967\n6.4\n5,121\n4.3\n3,425\n2.9\n2,299\n2.7\n2,172\n2.7\n2,155\n1.4\n1,154\n1.1\n885\n1.0\n837\n0.9\n686\n0.6\n489\n0.5\n395\n0.4\n332\n0.4\n299\n0.3\n233\n0.2\n188\n0.2\n169\n0.1\n120\n0.1\n108\n0.1\n106\n0.1\n95\n0.1\n89\n0.1\n89\n0.1\n80\n80,283\n100\n$21.13 million\n\n58,355\n56,646\n31,589\n13,631\n3,741\n17,303\n11,725\n7,737\n3,424\n17,300\n4,117\n11,783\n1,251\n3,318\n2,135\n1,046\n836\n2,635\n1,364\n924\n1,112\n932\n588\n773\n897\n255,162\n\nc\n\n%\n\n22.9\n22.2\n12.4\n5.3\n1.5\n6.8\n4.6\n3.0\n1.3\n6.8\n1.6\n4.6\n0.5\n1.3\n0.8\n0.4\n0.3\n1.0\n0.5\n0.4\n0.4\n0.4\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n100\n\nKR\n\n887,499\n122,992\n162,113\n251,265\n614,542\n125,527\n183,795\n149,153\n258,470\n48,382\n166,626\n41,500\n315,747\n100,060\n140,047\n222,753\n224,880\n64,137\n87,977\n116,883\n95,324\n101,931\n151,361\n115,136\n89,186\n314,635\n\n$\n\n234\n32\n43\n66\n162\n33\n48\n39\n68\n13\n44\n11\n83\n26\n37\n59\n59\n17\n23\n31\n25\n27\n40\n30\n23\n83\n\n1 ACLEDA\n2 Ennatien Moulethan Tchonnebat\n3 Catholic Relief Services\n4 Cambodia Community Buildingd\n5 Hattha Kaksekar\n6 World Vision Int'l Cambodia\n7 Seilaniti\n8 Action Nord Sud\n9 Cambodia Health Committee\n\n10 Concern\n11 Help the Widows\n12 Community Action for Social Development\n13 Camfed\n14 Cambodia Rural Economic Development\n15 Samarkee\n16 Cambodia Women's Development Assoc.\n17 Buddhists for Development\n18 Lutheran World Service\n19 Small Economic Activity Development\n20 Arunreah\n21 Kratie Women's Welfare Association\n22 Khmer Rural Development Association\n23 Social Development in Rural Areas\n24 Rural Development Association\n25 Samarkithor\n\nTotals\n\nACLEDA=Association of Cambodian Local Economic Development Agencies;  LFI=licensed financial institution; NGO=nongovernment organization.\na  Expressed interest in becoming a licensed financial institution and participating in the Project.\nb  Generally, excludes loan loss provisions.\nc  In some cases the numbers refer to members rather than borrowers.\nd  As of 31 August 1999.\nSources: The National Bank of Cambodia and individual NGOs.\n\ni\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n3\n,\n \np\na\ng\ne\n \n4\n\n\f        Table A3.2: Provincial Presence of Formal and Semiformal Credit Providers\n\nProvince\n\nPopulation\n\nPopulation\nDensity \n(people\n/km2)\n\nTotal\nHouseholds\nNo.\n\nRural\nHouseholds\nNo.\n\nACLEDA\n\nEMT\n\nMajor NGOs\nCRS \nPartners\n\nCCB\n\nHattha\nKaksekar\n\nCommercial\nBank\nBranches\n\nBanteay Meanchey\nBattambang\nKompong Cham\nKompong Chhnang\nKompong Speu\nKompong Thom\nKampot\nKandal\nKoh Kong\nKratie\nMondol Kiri\nPhnom Penh\nPreah Vihear\nPrey Veng\nPursat\nRatanak Kiri\nSiem Reap\nKrong P.

The main objective of RDB is to promote agricultural and rural development\nand  other  economic  activities  for  the  improvement  of  rural  livelihoods  and  facilitate  the\nalleviation  of  rural  poverty.  In  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  policy  for  rural  finance,1  the\nsubdecree  and  the  statute  of  RDB  were  modified  in  November  1999  to  promote\nmicrofinance operations,  to facilitate  linkage between  RDB  and  the banking  sector,  and  to\nenhance its professional focus. RDB has ceased retail lending and is operating solely as a\nwholesale  financial  intermediary.  In  addition  to  a  professional  accountant  and  a  lawyer\nappointed  earlier,  RDB  has employed  six  staff  with  banking  experience  and  two  staff  with\nnongovernment  organization  (NGO)  experience.  Autonomy  of  management  has  been\ngradually demonstrated by its board. The governance of RDB is expected to improve with a\nnew  board  of  directors  with  seven  representatives,  having  one  director  each  from  the\nMinistry  of  Economy  and  Finance,  the  Council  of  Ministers,  and  the  Ministry  of  Rural\nDevelopment;  one  representing  commercial  banks;  one  representing  NGOs  or  licensed\nMFIs; the Director General of RDB; and a representative of RDB\u2019s employees.\n\nB.\n\nReview of RDB\u2019s Operations\n\n2.\nAt the beginning, RDB had developed a loan portfolio of $15,340 to 793 farmers  in\nPrey Veng Province. The loans, for terms of five months, were appraised and approved by\nRDB,  and  farmers  made  full  repayments.  No  further  lending  has  been  made  to  these\nfarmers. As of December 1999, RDB had 25 staff, including the director general, the deputy\ndirector  general,  11  officers,  4  secretaries,  and  8  supporting  staff.  The  loan  portfolio  has\nreached  more  than  KR3,355  million  ($0.9  million)  with  lending  to  NGOs  and  commercial\nbanks. The loans are for terms of 6-12 months, at  12-15  percent per annum  in  US  dollars\nand 15-20 percent per annum in riel.\n\nA comprehensive corporate plan for RDB is required so that RDB\u2019s corporate policy\n3.\nwill  become  clear  and  formalized.  Such  a  plan  needs  to  be  prepared  before  the  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  loan  becomes  effective,  and  should  include  (i)  a  specific\nimplementation strategy, (ii) the expected composition of the loan portfolio over the next five\nyears,  and  (iii)  details  on  the  financing  of  asset  growth  from  a  diverse  range  of  debt  and\nequity sources.\n\nC.\n\nParticipation in the Project\n\n4.\nRDB will participate in the Project as an Executing Agency to manage the credit line\nand  provide  support  for  the  participating  licensed  financial  institutions  (LFIs),  including\nmicrofinance  institutions.  It  will  act  as  a  wholesale  banking  institution  drawing  down  funds\nreceived from  the Government and onlending  these funds  to LFIs.  RDB  will  remain  viable\nand maintain an adequate net worth through retained earnings and capital injections. Over\nthe  project period,  RDB  will  provide  lines  of  credit  for  LFIs\u2019  operations  and  for  fixed  asset\npurchases of the participating LFIs. RDB is expected to achieve a loan portfolio of about $21\nmillion after loan loss provisions under the Project by 2005, including loans provided prior to\ninception  of  the  Project.  The  Project  will  support  the  purchase  of  service  vehicles,\n\n                                               \n1 The Council of Ministers approved on 28 December 1998 the policy for rural finance in Cambodia.\n\n\fAppendix 9, page 2\n\nequipment, and computer software. The onlending interest rate of RDB to LFIs is based on\nreceiving  funds  from  the  Government  at  no  less  than  the  rate  of  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital\nresources in riel and US dollars. To this cost of funds, RDB will add a total interest spread\ninitially  up  to 4  percent for  its  administrative expenses and  the  anticipated  LFI  institutional\nrisk.  The  institutional  risk  of  LFIs  is  critical  to  loan  pricing.  In  this  respect,  RDB  will  liaise\nclosely  with  NBC  in  evaluating  LFI  performance  and  their  compliance  with  the  NBC\nregulations.  It  may  be  feasible  to  reduce  the  onlending  rate  to  better-performing  LFIs  and\nincrease the rate for poorer-performing ones.\n\n5.\nAccording to the financial projections for RDB (Table A9), RDB will become profitable\nduring 2000 and will remain profitable in each year of operation, reaching a net profit after\ntax of $684,835 in 2005. The annual return on equity will reach 9.68 percent by 2005. The\ninterest coverage ratio is maintained at a safe level and, is never below a minimum of 1.70\npercent,  and  the  capital  adequacy  ratio  is  maintained  above  30  percent.  Over  the  project\nperiod,  the  administrative  cost  of  lending  steadily  declines  from  10.9  percent  of  loans\noutstanding in 2001 to1.8 percent in 2005.\n\n6.\nThe  financial  performance  and  ratios  indicate  that  RDB  can  be  a  viable  financial\ninstitution as a wholesale bank. Particular attention needs to be given to the pricing of loans\nbased on weighted costs of funds and expected loan losses. This will be crucial as RDB is\nlikely to have a range in sources of funds from various  external funding agencies, and  will\nface  different  levels  of  risk  among  segments  of  its  loan  portfolio.  Administrative  expenses\nwill also require a regular review to ensure they meet  the  banking  standards.  In  particular,\nRDB should not increase its present levels of staffing and administrative expenses until an\nadequate return on equity is achieved. RDB should aim to achieve a return on equity that is\nat least 5.0 percent above the rate of inflation. The operational performance of RDB as the\nExecuting Agency needs to be  reassessed during  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  of  the\nProject. Based on the outcome of the review, remedial measures, if necessary, will be taken\nto improve project implementation.\n\n\fTable A9:  Rural Development Bank Financial Projection:  2000 - 2005 \n ( $, as of 31 December)\n\n   Appendix 9, page 3\n\n2000\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\nLFI Credit Line for Onlending\nLFI Credit Line: Civil Works, Vehicles, Equipment\nOther Programs\n      Total Lending\n\n          \n\n          \n\n750,000\n0\n0\n750,000\n\n       \n          \n\n2,121,000\n380,000\n0\n2,501,000\n\n       \n\n         \n            \n\n3,806,400\n253,500\n0\n4,059,900\n\n         \n\n         \n            \n\n4,822,200\n246,500\n0\n5,068,700\n\n         \n\n         \n            \n\n5,358,000\n117,500\n0\n5,475,500\n\n         \n\n         \n            \n\n3,186,000\n117,500\n0\n3,303,500\n\n         \n\n B.\n\n \n\n \n\n A.\n\nLending program\n\nIncome Statements\nRevenues:\n  Interest on Lending\n  Interest on Deposits\n  Noninterest Income\n      Total Revenues\nExpenses:\n  Interest on Commercial Borrowings\n  Interest on Project Funds\n      Total Cost of Funds\n  Salaries\n  Staff Training\n  Directors Fees\n  Office Rental\n  Communications\n  Audit Fee\n  Office Utilities\n  Software Maintenance\n  Office Expenses\n  Travel \n  Annual License Fee\n  Repairs & Maintenance\n  Sundry\n  Loan Loss Provision\n  Depreciation\n      Total Operating Expenses\n            Net Operating Profit\n  Taxes\n  Dividends\n            Net Retained Earnings\n\n C.

CAMBODIA\n\nA.\n\nOverall Organization\n\nThe National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) is an autonomous central bank as the issuer of\n1.\nthe local currency, the banker of the Government, and the supervisor of banks. NBC\u2019s board of\ndirectors consists of seven members including the governor, the deputy governor, and a staff\nrepresentative. Members are appointed for four years and are eligible for a  further  term.  The\nboard  of  directors  is  responsible  for  establishing  operating  policies  and  issuing  decisions,\nregulations,  circulars,  and  other  directives.  As  of  the  end  of  1998,  NBC  had  a  total  of  1,075\nstaff, including 425 staff working in provincial branches and 87 staff in the Foreign Trade Bank.\nThe number of staff in  provincial  branches  is  being  reduced  by  either  employing  them  in  the\nhead office or by placing them in commercial banks wherever possible.\n\n2.\nThe  NBC\u2019s  balance  sheet  for  31  December  1998,  excluding  provincial  branches,\nshowed total  assets  of  KR2,077  billion  ($547  million),  which  is  an  increase  by  51  percent  as\ncompared with December 1997. Foreign assets, which include foreign exchange, holding bank\naccounts  with  foreign  banks,  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  reserve  position,  and\nspecial drawing rights holdings, comprised 75 percent of its total assets in December 1997 and\n81 percent in December 1998. This increase was due to a large increase in foreign accounts\nwith foreign banks. As regards the IMF reserve position, NBC had a liability of KR224.7 billion\n($59  million)  in  1997  and  KR253.8  billion  ($67  million)  in  1998.  The  total  amount  of  foreign\nliabilities was in both years entirely due to the IMF for  the  General  Reserve  Account  and  the\nenhanced special adjustment facility.\n\n3.\nNBC had a loan amount outstanding to the Government of KR211 billion ($56 million) in\n1997  and  KR289  billion  ($76  million),  an  increase  by  37  percent,  and  liabilities,  held  as  a\nGovernment deposit, of KR153.5 billion ($40 million) in 1997 and KR106.1 billion ($28 million),\na decrease by 31 percent. Since the beginning of 1998, the monetary policy has shifted toward\nsupport  for  the  Government\u2019s  budget  deficit  since  Cambodia  was  not  able  to  receive  any\nassistance  from  IMF  and  was  mainly  concerned  about  the  resolution  of  political  conflicts.\nThese  led  to  a  higher  inflation  and  fast  depreciation  of  the  exchange  rate.  During  1998,\nalthough broad money (M2) grew at a rate of 16 percent, currency outside the banking system\nincreased by 43 percent, resulting in soaring inflation.\n\nB. \n\nOrganization of the Bank Supervision Department\n\n4.\nBank  supervision  is  one  of  the  most  important  activities  of  NBC.  To  ensure  the  well-\nbeing  of  the  banking  sector,  NBC\u2019s  Supervision  Department  supervises  licensed  commercial\nbanks to follow the banking laws and accompanying regulations set by NBC. The department\nwas  reorganized  in  December  1999,  and  now  has  four  divisions  for  (i)  off-site  inspection  of\ncommercial  banks;  (ii)  on-site  inspection  of  commercial  banks;  (iii)  administration,  regulation,\nresearch and licensing of commercial banks; and (iv) supervision and licensing of specialized\nbanks and microfinance institutions (MFIs). The department is headed by a director. Until the\nrecent reorganization, the department had a separate office, called the Supervision Office for\nDecentralized Banking System, which was established by an agreement between  the  French\nAgency  for  Development  and  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  of  the  Government  in\nNovember  1997.  This  office,  which  received  financial  and  technical  support  from  French\nAgency for Development to assist four nongovernment organizations, has been integrated into\n\n\fAppendix 10, page 2\n\nthe new division for the supervision and licensing of specialized banks and MFIs. At present,\nNBC  monitors  the  financial  activities  of  major  nongovernment  organizations,  which  submit\nquarterly reports on a voluntary basis.\n\nThe  Supervision  Department  has  38  staff,  including  10  staff  recently  assigned  to  the\n5.\non-site inspection division for commercial banks. These  staff  members  received  brief  training\non  on-site  inspection  activities.  There  are  18  staff  working  in  six  sections  of  the  off-site\ninspection division for commercial banks. The supervision and licensing division for specialized\nbanks and MFIs will conduct off-site and on-site inspection of these institutions.\n\nC.\n\nSupervision of Commercial Banks\n\nThe  six  sections  of  the  off-site  inspection  division  supervise  31  operating  commercial\n6.\nbanks. Each section of three staff is responsible for about five commercial banks. Supervision\nis  done  by  analyzing  weekly,  monthly,  quarterly,  and  annual  reports  of  banks.  On  a  28-day\nbasis,  banks  are  required  to  provide  daily  balances  of  riel  and  foreign  liabilities  through  their\nrequired  reserve  reports  to  show  compliance  with  the  daily  average  required  balance.  The\npresent reserve requirement is fixed at 8 percent of total liabilities. Banks are penalized by 0.1\npercent  per  month  of  the  refinancing  rate  on  the  deficit  amount  if  they  fail  to  comply  with\nreserve requirements.\n\n7.\nMonthly reports required for banks include information on the statements of assets and\nliabilities,  income  and  expenditures,  credit  granted  by  type  of  business  and  customer,  total\ndeposits  classified  by  type  of  customer,  foreign  exchange  position,  and  calculation  of  net\nworth. Banks also submit quarterly reports on bad and doubtful debts, capital adequacy ratio,\nand organization and administration. Annual reports and audited financial statements of banks\nare  also  submitted  to  NBC.  Action  is  taken  if  banks  are  found  to  fail  to  comply  with  NBC\nregulations.\n\n8.\nThere  is  still  substantial  room  for  improving  the  effectiveness  of  NBC\u2019s  bank\nsupervision.  Details  on  the  liquidity  positions  of  banks,  including  their  liquid  assets  and\nliabilities in the country and abroad, short-term liabilities with local and foreign banks, local and\nforeign demand deposits, and collateral covering outstanding loans, will be required for  more\naccurate analysis. On-site supervision of commercial  banks  has  been  carried  out  by  external\nauditors at the request of NBC if there are suspicions about bank reports. NBC urgently needs\nto  activate  its  in-house  function  for  regular  on-site  supervision  for  the  verification  of  reports\nsubmitted by banks.\n\nD.\n\nMFI Supervision under the Project\n\n1.\n\nOrganization and Staffing\n\nUnder the new law on banking and financial institutions, MFIs are allowed to carry out\n9.\nfinancial transactions, including savings mobilization from the public, under NBC\u2019s supervision.\nSupervision of MFIs requires the same approach and strictness as for commercial banks and\nneeds  to  be  under  a  specialized  division  for  MFI  supervision  at  NBC\u2019s  Bank  Supervision\nDepartment. MFIs will need to be licensed by  the  department  prior  to  being  eligible  to  obtain\ndeposits from the public. MFIs will have to conform to NBC\u2019s requirements with respect to their\ncapital  adequacy  ratios  and  minimum  reserves  with  NBC,  which  are  different  from  those  for\n\n\fAppendix 10, page 3\n\ncommercial  banks.  MFIs  will  not  be  allowed  to  provide  payment  services  through  checking\naccounts or forward dealings in foreign currencies. The assessment of MFIs\u2019 financial positions\nwill require a specialized approach in view of their financial structure, performance, experience,\nand areas of operation. Regular on-site inspection of MFIs, including their branch offices,  will\nbe essential for verifying documents NBC receives from MFIs for assessment and reporting.\n\n10.\nProper  scheduling  of  on-site  inspection  should  be  done  annually.  About  50  days  are\nrequired for on-site inspection during the first year and 60 days in the second year, gradually\nincreasing to 90 days by the fifth year. On-site inspection will focus on the quality of the loan\nportfolio,  including  loan  documentation  such  as  loan  agreements  and  security  obtained,  and\nthe quality of cash and deposit management.\n\n2.\n\nMonitoring and Supervision\n\n11.\nMFIs  may  be  required  to  submit  monthly  reports  to  NBC  on  (i)  loans  outstanding,  (ii)\nsavings  and  deposit  balances,  (iii)  liquidity  balances  in  cash  and  deposits  with  NBC  and\nlicensed  commercial  banks,  (iv)  income  and  expenses  statements,  (v)  percentage  of  liquidity\nreserves in relation to savings and deposits, and (vi) statements of overdue loans classified up\nto  30  days,  from  31-60  days,  61-180  days,  and  beyond  180  days  outstanding.  Quarterly\nreporting  may  include  additional  information  on  (i)  management  accounts,  (ii)  the  number  of\nborrowers  and  depositors,  (iii)  the  calculation  and  evaluation  of  the  net  worth,  (iv)  the\nstatement of investments in fixed assets and in equity participation, and (v) capital  adequacy\nand  liquidity  ratios  as  prescribed  by  NBC.  Annual  reporting  will  be  accompanied  by  audited\nfinancial statements. The financial statements of MFIs need to be audited by an independent\nauditor approved by NBC.\n\n12.\nNBC  will  process  all  reports  received  from  licensed  MFIs.  A  diary  system  will  be\ninstalled to monitor the timeliness of reports. For each MFI, a card will be prepared to  record\nkey  details  such  as  the  address,  contact  person,  legal  form,  main  shareholders,  general\nmanager,  and  auditor.  This  card  will  be  filed  in  a  central  registry  and  will  be  available  to\nauthorized persons only. The cash balances and the overall liquidity position of each MFI will\nbe reviewed on a monthly basis. Monthly reports together with financial statements from MFIs\nshould reach the supervision and licensing division not later than 15th of each month following\nthe  month  under  review.  Analysis  of  current  assets  and  liabilities  by  item,  amount,  and\ncurrency  will  be  required  to  ensure  the  maintenance  of  adequate  liquidity.  Sudden  changes\nmay  be  a  sign  of  financial  deterioration  and  necessitate  NBC\u2019s  dialogue  with  the  concerned\nMFI for remedial actions to be taken.\n\n13.\nRegular meetings need to be organized within NBC\u2019s Bank Supervision Department to\nreview the progress of MFI development. Based on the performance and financial positions of\nMFIs,  NBC  should  flexibly  consider  amendments  of  MFI  regulations  or  new  regulations  if\nnecessary to promote sound development of MFIs.\n\n\fAppendix 11, page 1\n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION\n\nA. \n\nIntroduction\n\nThe initial environmental examination (IEE) of the Project was conducted over a six-\n1.\nweek  period  from  November  1998  to  December  1998.  The  IEE  covers  a  range  of\nsubprojects  that  are  expected  to  be  financed  under  the  Project,  including  rice  production,\nsmall-scale irrigation, pig raising, palm sugar production, rice milling, weaving, brick and tile\nmaking, and trading.\n\nB. \n\nDescription of the Environment\n\nThe  Cambodian  landscape  features  (i)  the  floodplain  of  the  Mekong  River  and  the\n2.\nassociated  basin  of  the  Tonle  Sap  draining  to  the  Mekong  delta  in  the  southeast,  (ii)  the\nCardamon  and  Dangrek  mountains  to  the  southwest  and  northwest,  and  (iii)  the  plateau\nbordering  the Lao  People's  Democratic  Republic and Viet  Nam  in  the northeast.  A narrow\ncoastal belt lies beyond the Cardamon Mountains. The  climate  is  monsoonal,  with  the  wet\nseason from May to November. Marked variation is present from year to year in the onset,\nintensity,  and  duration  of  the  rains.  Over  75  percent  of  the  population  live  in  the  Mekong\nBasin  and  the  Tonle  Sap  Plain,  which  represent  a  very  large  diversity  of  agro-ecological\nconditions.\n\n3.\nCambodian  farms  are  predominantly  subsistence-oriented  in  rice  cultivation.  Soils\ntend  to  be  of  low  fertility  and  deficient  in  nitrogen,  phosphorous,  and  micronutrients.\nProductivity is maintained in many areas by the deposition of silt by annual floods. Some 80\npercent of  rice  cultivation  is  rainfed,  and  resulting  in  a  high  variety  of  rice  yields  and  thus\nhigh risks to farming. Only 17 percent of the rice-growing areas are currently under any form\nof  water  management,  and  the  use  of  fertilizers  and  pest  control  technology  is  limited.\nOpportunities  for  production  increases  through  the  use  of  these  two  chemical  inputs  are\nsignificant, and will have environmental implications.\n\n4.\nThe  rate  of  forest  coverage  in  Cambodia  is  estimated  up  to  65  percent,  including\nevergreen  lowland  and  mountainous,  semi-evergreen,  and  deciduous  communities.  The\nforests provide habitat to a great wealth of animal biodiversity, including wild cats, primates,\nbears,  elephants,  pangolins,  and  about  400  bird  species.  Rapid  and  poorly  managed\ncommercial  logging  degrades  these  forests  at  an  unsustainable  rate.  Moreover,  a  large\nnumber  of  rural  people  depend  on  materials  gathered  from  common  areas  for  their\nnutritional  well-being.  Exploitation  of  forest  species  is  extensive  and  often  uncontrolled.\nDeforestation  is  a  major  contributor  to  flood  disasters,  and  possibly  also  to  changes  in\nrainfall patterns.\n\nC. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n\n5.\nAlthough environmental impacts of many subprojects in the rural area are expected\nto be insignificant, the aggregate impacts of all may become apparent, especially when the\nuse  of  toxic  pesticides  is  increased,  the  extraction  of  trees  or  quarried  material  is\naccelerated, and/or the hydrological regime is modified. The examples of possible  impacts\nof  subprojects  and  mitigative  measures  are  discussed  in  Table  A11.  Societal  means  for\nensuring  a  positive  balance  in  such  circumstances  include  (i)  appropriate  institutional\nmechanisms  for  decision  making,  (ii)  effective  tools  for  sound  technical  analysis,  and  (iii)\ntransparent  and  equitable  procedures  for  monitoring  and  enforcement.  An  adequate\nregulatory  framework  to  ensure  these  is  being  formulated.  The  Project  provides  an\n\n\fAppendix 11, page 2\n\nopportunity  to  contribute  to  these  developments  through  increased  awareness  among\ncommunities and civil institutions in the rural area.\n\n6.\nThe capacity building for environmental management is necessary for line ministries\nand  local  institutions  in  Cambodia  to  conduct  effective  planning  and  monitoring.  Without\nplacing undue burdens on the microfinance institutions (MFIs), the Project will ensure that (i)\nMFI officers are given at least an initial introduction to the potential environmental impacts of\ntheir  portfolios,  (ii)  MFI  officers  will  have  access  to  the  technical  support  programs  of  the\nresource\nGovernment  and  nongovernment  organizations \nmanagement,  and  (iii)  the  monitoring  activities  under  the  Project  will  contribute  useful\ninformation to the country\u2019s overall environmental management efforts by properly compiling\nprogress and impact reports.\n\nfor  sustainable  natural \n\nD. \n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program\n\n1.\n\nInstitutional and Legal Framework\n\n7.\nThe  Ministry  of  Environment,  which  was  established  in  November  1993,  has  major\nresponsibility for environmental  management.  Other  ministries  relevant  in  the area are  the\nMinistry of Health, the Ministry of Tourism, the Ministry of Public Works and Transport, and\nthe Council for the Development of Cambodia. The Government is making efforts to develop\nappropriate  coordination  among  these  ministries  in  environmental  management,  as\nmandated  in  the  five-year  plan.1  Some  collaboration  is  beginning  to  emerge,  both  at  the\nworking  level  among  officials  and  at  senior  levels  among  members  of  the  Environmental\nSteering Committee of the Government. However, it will take some years before an effective\nsystem \nthe  prevailing\ninstitutional  and  resource  constraints.  The  Project  will  facilitate  the  growth  of  the  system\nthrough encouraging environmental awareness on the part of MFIs.\n\nfor  environmental  management  becomes  operational,  given \n\n8.\nThe  law  on  environmental  protection  and  natural  resource  management,  which\nspecifies  the  Ministry  of  Environment's  authority,  public  participation  procedures  in\nenvironmental  protection,  and  penalties  for  pollution  and  related  offences,  was  enacted  in\n1996.  Specific  details  for  implementation  are  left  to  subordinate  regulations  such  as\nsubdecrees  and  circulars,  which  cover  environmental  impact  assessment,  water  pollution\ncontrol, solid waste management, protected area management, and control over the use of\ninsecticides.  Article  6 of the  law  requires  that environmental  impact  assessments  (EIA)  be\ndone  for  all  investment  projects  that  require  Government  approval,  subject  to  criteria  and\nprocedures to be established by a subdecree pursuant to the law. A draft subdecree for the\nEIA process was prepared with technical support from the  Asian  Development Bank  2  and\nUnited Nations Development Programme.3\n\n2.\n\nEIA Process\n\n9.\nDetails  on  how  EIA  and  other  requirements  are  applied  for  investment  projects\nremain unspecified in Cambodia since the relevant regulations are not in place. An EIA will\nbe  required  for  any  project  that  needs  to  be  approved  by  a  Government  institution  by  a\nconstruction  permit,  operating  license,  or  concession  agreement.  The  Government  will\ndetermine  the  level  of  environmental  review  required  for  each  project  based  on  each\n                                               \n1 Royal Government of Cambodia. 1997.

The information required in this application is of the\nsame  kind but  less  comprehensive  than  that  of  an  IEE,  amounting  to  a  brief  study.  For  a\nproposal  judged  likely  to  have  little  or  no  environmental  impact,  the  application  document\nwill  be  sufficient  for  fulfilling  requirements  under  the  law.  Projects  that  are  considered  to\nhave significant environmental impacts will be required to submit their  IEE  results together\nwith their applications. Some will then be judged to require a full-scale EIA before approval\nis  granted.  Most  subprojects  to  be  financed  under  the  Project  are  very  small-scale\nenterprises, and will not require approval from a Government institution for commencement.\nEven  if  some  subprojects  need  to  be  reviewed  by  the  Government,  the  screening  can  be\ndone under summary procedures based on the application documents.\n\n3.\n\nEnvironmental Management Process\n\n10.\nThe  project  management  unit  will  have  an  officer  responsible  for  environmental\nconcerns under the Project. The officer will commission the work of designing environmental\ntraining modules for MFI managers, develop a data base for natural resource management\nprograms, facilitate working relations between the project management unit and MFIs,  and\norganize environmental monitoring activities relating to the Project.\n\nE. \n\nConclusion and Recommendations\n\n11.\nCambodia\u2019s  capacity  to  manage  the  environmental  impacts  of  development  is\nbeginning  to  emerge,  both  in  terms  of  the  legal  framework  for  regulation  and  skilled\npersonnel capable of managing the environmental assessment and monitoring. Appropriate\nenvironmental  management  of  larger  scale  industrial  projects  will  largely  occupy  this  still\nlimited  capacity  for  the  next  several  years.  For  the  majority  of  the  rural  population,  the\ndevelopment of microenterprises is critical for the reduction of poverty, yet these enterprises\ncould pose a threat to the resource base that people depend on for their food  security.  By\nbringing at least a minimum of environmental consideration and technical expertise into the\nplanning process and at the level of investment decision making, the Project will contribute\nto  the  promotion  of  sustainable  development  paths  in  the  rural  area.  In  addition  to  the\nenvironmental  management  process  to  be  institutionalized  into  the  project  management\nunit,  the  adoption  of  mitigative  measures  listed  in  Table  A11  is  recommended  under  the\nProject.\n\nTable A11: Summary of Environmental Impacts of Microenterprises\n\nSubprojects\n1.

The social assessment specifically\naimed  at  (i)  identifying  the  client  group  of  the  Project;  (ii)  examining  the  socioeconomic\ncircumstances  of  the  client  group,  including  the  poor,  the  near-poor,  the  better-off,  and\nwomen;  (iii)  analyzing  the  needs,  demands,  and  absorptive  capacity  of  the  clientele\nidentified  for  rural  financial  services,  including  perceptions  regarding  access  to  credit  and\nresponsibilities  involved;  and  (iv)  examining  social  development  concerns  relevant  to  the\nProject. The field work was carried out for three weeks in October 1998 and November 1998\nin four provinces, which were selected from the plain, Tonle Sap Lake, and plateau regions\nof the country. The four provinces are Kompong Cham, Prey Veng, Banteay Meanchey, and\nKompong  Speu.  Kompong  Speu  and  Prey  Veng  Provinces  are  considered  to  be  poorer\namong the four. The coastal region was not selected since it is characterized differently as a\nprovince mainly for tourist enterprises. These four provinces are considered representative\nof  most  of  Cambodia's  rural  population.  The  survey  was  based  on  a  sample  of  348  rural\nhouseholds  taken  at  random  from  areas  where  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  are\nactive in credit and savings schemes. Preliminary findings were presented and discussed at\na  stakeholder  workshop  involving  NGOs  on  24  November  1998.  The  results  of  the  social\nassessment are summarized in Table A12.\n\nB.\n\nSocial Assessment\n\n1. \n\nRural Poverty\n\n2.\nThe  clientele  of  the  Project  will  be  the  people  living  in  provincial  areas  outside\nPhnom  Penh,  including  provincial  towns.  Outside  towns,  rural  people  live  in  agricultural\nareas and along waterways. The rural population covered under the social assessment was\nmarked by a high incidence of poverty or near-poverty. They represent a significant portion\nof  the  subgroups  in the  client  group  of  the  Project.  Household  sizes  in  the  surveyed  area\nranged from 2 to 15 persons, with an average of 6, which is higher than the national average\nof  5.2.  The  gender  ratio  in  the  households  was  48  percent  male  and  52  percent  female,\nroughly  reflecting  the  country\u2019s  situation.  Households    surveyed  were  mainly  headed  by\nmales with 8 percent of the total households surveyed headed by females, contrasting with\na  national  average of 25  percent.  Most  households  are  centered  on  nuclear  families,  with\nfew  extended  families.  The  dominant  ethnicity  in  the  surveyed  area  is  Cambodian  (95\npercent of the total households surveyed). Cham or Muslim Cambodian  is  the next  largest\nethnic  group  (4  percent).  Other  ethnic  groups  include  indigenous  people,  Thai,  and\nCambodians of Chinese ethnic origin.\n\n3.\nHouseholds  and  villages  are  the  main  bases  for  social  organization.  Temporary\ngroups  on  the  bases  of  kin,  friends,  and  neighbors  often  form  to  deal  with  circumstances\nsuch  as  labor  shortages  and  emergencies,  and  for  important  social  events.  Political  and\nadministrative  units  at  the  village  level  are  village  development  committees,  appointed  by\nGovernment  authorities,  but  comprising  community  members  most  often  recognized  as\nauthority  figures.  Government  hospitals  are  operated  at  provincial  and  district  levels.\nCommune  health  offices  exist  at  the  village  level,  and  private  clinics  operate.  The  cost  of\nhealth care limits the access of the rural poor to health services, and illnesses and accidents\ncan result in major financial burdens, forcing the sale of assets such as land and livestock to\ngenerate funds.\n\n\fAppendix 12, page 2\n\n4.\nNinety-one  percent  of  the  population  is  literate  to  some  degree.  Illiteracy  is  higher\namong poorer households, and higher among females (15 percent) than males (5 percent).\nForty percent of the surveyed respondents reported a primary school education, 28 percent\na  high  school  education,  and  1  percent  a  higher  level  of  education.  Households  value\neducation for their children and save for school fees, though this is a major burden on poor\nhouseholds.\n\nMain roads are generally in poor condition. Access rural roads are also poor or more\n5.\ndeteriorated.  A  very  limited  telephone  system  exists  only  in  towns.  Where  an  electricity\nsupply  exists,  radio  and  television  are  becoming  an  increasingly  important  communication\nmedia, being owned by well-off families in the villages. Postal systems are often inadequate.\nPublic bus and motorcycle taxis are the main modes of personal transportation, and trucks\nfor hire are available for transportation of goods. Bicycles and ox- or horse-drawn carts also\nremain  important  modes of  transportation for  most  rural  households. Wood,  obtained  from\npublic  forests,  is  the  main  source  of  energy  for  cooking  and  other  purposes.  Scarcity  of\nwood  is  an  increasingly  serious  problem.  A  regular  electricity  supply  exists  only  in  towns.\nSome 32 percent of households rely on storage batteries for  basic  electricity.  Five percent\nown  a  generator,  which  is  a  highly  valued  asset  in  villages.  Poor  households  without\nelectricity rely on kerosene as a source of lighting.\n\ninclude \n\nland,  buildings,  gold, \n\nMajor  economic  assets \n\n6.\nlivestock,  agricultural\nequipment, and items such as motorcycles, generators, and televisions. Such assets often\nserve as collateral for individual loans. There are few landless persons in the surveyed area.\nFifty  one  percent  of  total  households  had  less  than  0.5  hectares,  which  accommodate\nhouses  as  well  as  some  land  for  agriculture.  Most  households  own  some  livestock.\nHousehold  livestock  raising  is  a  significant  source  of  secondary  household  income.  The\ndominant  livelihood  is  agriculture,  predominantly  rice  farming.  Fifty-seven  percent  of\nrespondents  are  engaged  in  rice  cultivation.  Corn,  sweet  potatoes,  cassava,  and  other\nvegetables are grown as market crops, but generally on a small scale. Many households are\nengaged  in  a  wide  range  of  nonfarming  activities.  Such  activities  include  a  variety  of\nenterprises, trading, provision of services, and labor. Most households have more than one\nsource of income for their subsistence.\n\n7.\nIt is difficult to form a precise estimation of poverty incidence for the surveyed area.\nA few studies have assessed the poverty situation in Cambodia. United Nations  Children's\nFund estimates that the poor account for about 85 percent of  the population  in  Cambodia.\nAnother study,1 reported 40 percent of rural households below the official poverty  line  of a\nper capita income of KR1,210 ($0.32) per day. Considering an income of less than KR1,210\nper  day  and  the  ownership  of  less  than  0.5  ha  of  agricultural  land2  as  indicators  for  rural\npoverty,  about  65  percent  of  the  surveyed  households  may  be  classified  as  poor\nhouseholds.\n\n8.\nPoor  households  in  rural  Cambodia  are  heavily  handicapped  in  terms  of  (i)\nownership of assets, (ii) access to basic social services, and (iii) access to financial services.\nThey  are  characterized  by  the  inability  to  produce  a  year-round  food  supply  (six  months\naverage of food shortage), small and fragmented landholdings, small or no savings to cover\nemergency needs such as illness, limited or lack of access to health care, lack of access to\nminimum  sanitary  facilities,  and  the  need  for  borrowing  to  support  and  expand  income-\n\n                                               \n1 A Poverty Profile of Cambodia \u2013 1997, the Ministry of Planning, financed by UNDP, the World Bank, and SIDA.\n2  Ownership of 0.5 ha of agricultural land is an informal but accepted indicator of poverty in the rural area.\n\n\fAppendix 12, page 3\n\ngenerating activities. Generally, there is a large gap between a small number of rich people\nand people belonging to the poor and the near-poor groups, who constitute the majority of\nrural  population.  Some  of  wealthy  people  become  sources  of  informal  credit  for  poorer\nhouseholds in the rural area. Poor people are usually engaged in wage labor and other off-\nfarm employment in addition to agriculture as additional sources of cash income, and need\nto work harder to avoid a cycle of heavy debt burden.\n\n2.\n\nRole of Women\n\n9.\nIn Cambodia, women have greater social equality with men than is the case on some\nother Asian countries. Law and practice allow both sons and daughters  to  inherit property.\nThe  legal  status  and  rights  of  women  are  protected  under  the  Cambodian  constitution.  At\nthe  household  level,  women  are  active  and  equal  participants  in  household  management\nand decision making, including decisions related to financial issues. Women and men work\ntogether in the rural areas, although responsibilities of women include household and family-\nrelated  work  in  addition  to  farm  work  or  other  income-generating  activities.  Some  social\nrestrictions  affecting  the  mobility of  women  in  terms  of  appearance  and  transportation  are\napparent in the Cambodian society.\n\n10. Women are full partners in traditional rice agriculture. Women are engaged more in\nactivities  such  as  transplanting  seedlings  from  seedbeds.  Both  men  and  women  are\ninvolved  in  various  degrees  in  the  tasks  of  harvesting,  transporting,  and  threshing.  Many\nother farm activities are shared, such as carrying water and wood, and tending to livestock.\nWomen tend to be involved in other on-farm or off-farm income-generating activities. Rural\nwomen are more active and more skillful in trading and marketing than men, and generally\nare  better  managers  of  household  savings  and  credit.  Women  most  often  are  the  direct\nborrowers when credit is arranged, whether from an informal lender or a credit operator such\nas an NGO. However, there is usually a shared decision-making and agreement between a\nwife and a husband before taking a loan and in enterprise management.\n\n3.\n\nDemand for Credit and Savings\n\nThe  social  assessment  indicated  that  34  percent  of  respondents  actually  received\n11.\nloans from NGOs, and 66 percent borrowed from individual moneylenders. Credit obtained\nwas  mainly  for  production  purposes.  For  emergency  needs,  borrowing  was  mainly  from\ninformal  sources.  Loan  size  varies,  with  small  loans  being  mainly  for  agricultural  and\nlivestock purposes, and medium- and large-sized loans for capital to support enterprises or\ntrading  activities.  Nearly  all  households  showed  interest  in  borrowing  to  support  income-\ngenerating  activities,  and  most  households  identified  loan  terms  and  conditions  and\nrepayment  arrangements  as  key  factors  in  their  decision  making  for  borrowing.  About  80\npercent of the respondents in social assessment indicated their preference for NGOs as the\nsource of credit funds. While the decision to borrow is a shared household decision, women\nrespondents  most  often  expressed  greater  interest  in  borrowing.  It  is  noted  that  rural\nhouseholds  in  Cambodia  are  very  cautious  in  financial  transactions.  NGOs  also  adopt\nprudent  practices  in  their  credit  schemes  by  initiating  them  with  a  very  small  amount  and\nincreasing the amount, if considered feasible, through a few cycles.\n\n12. With respect to savings, the social assessment results show the general distrust in or\nlack  of  access  to  commercial  banks.  About  95  percent  of  the  surveyed  rural  households\nindicated their preference for saving in the form of cash, gold, or other assets because of the\nconvenience of and trust in such form of traditional savings. Compulsory savings schemes\ncurrently practiced by some NGOs are not preferred due to (i) the distance to NGO offices;\n\n\fAppendix 12, page 4\n\n(ii) the very small amount of saving, usually equivalent to one quarter of the monthly interest\npayment  for  NGO  loans;  and  (iii)  unclear  systems  for  withdrawal  and  ownership  of\naccumulated  savings.  About  one  third  of  the  surveyed  households  indicated  that  they\nregularly saved money, another one  third  saved  irregularly,  and the  remaining households\ndid  not  have  surplus  money  to  save.  Rural  people  usually  require  savings  facilities  for\nemergency purposes, which are commonly met through borrowing from moneylenders. The\nsocial assessment  clearly  showed  the  strong  demand among  rural  households  for  reliable\nsavings facilities that are safe, convenient, and attractive.\n\nC.\n\nSome Field Observations\n\n13.\nInteresting  cases  of  microcredit  were  noted  during  the  preparation  of  the  Project.\nPeople  interviewed  indicated  their  general  satisfaction  with  the  rules  and  procedures  of\nNGOs\u2019  credit  operations.  People  who  borrowed  from  moneylenders  were  dissatisfied  and\nuniformly stated preference for NGOs. Subsequent to their successful experience in the first\nborrowing, most beneficiaries request for the second cycle of borrowing funds from NGOs.\n\n14.\nOne  example  is  a  poor  woman  in  Takeo  Town  Market,  who  was  engaged  in  cloth\ntrading. She received a credit of KR75,000 ($20) from the Association of Cambodian Local\nEconomic  Development  Agencies  (ACLEDA).  She  regularly  buys  a  small  amount  of  cloth\nfrom a wholesaler in Phnom Penh once or  twice  a  month depending  upon  the  level  of  the\nprevious sales. Generally, the wholesaler allows her to buy on credit, and she repays during\nher next purchase. Before ACLEDA operated in her area, she made loans from her relatives\nor  moneylenders.  The  interest  charged  by  moneylenders  was  KR1,000  per  month  per\nKR10,000  ($2.63) borrowed, with repayments daily or weekly. The trader indicated that she\nwould  not  borrow  money  from  moneylenders  in  future  as  some  moneylenders  gave\ninformation  about her  financial  transactions  to  other  people  in  the  village.  She  prefers  the\nACLEDA scheme partly because of its businesslike procedures and confidentiality; details of\nher transactions are shared only with her group members (four other women).\n\n15.\nThe trader  was  introduced  to  the  ACLEDA  scheme  during  a  meeting  organized  by\nACLEDA with local traders in the market. All details were explained to them, and those who\nwere interested to take loans applied for registration, and took a short training program. For\nsmall loans, a group of five members is formed,  while individual loans require land or house\ntitles  as  collateral.  Her  trading  budget  and  business  management  were  assessed  by\nACLEDA  to  make  sure  that  she  could  manage  funds  properly  and  make  repayments  in  a\ntimely manner. She also indicated that ACLEDA provided loans to a large number of small\nlocal traders in the market.\n\nD.\n\nConclusion\n\n16.\nThe  survey  and  social  assessment  results  indicate  a  strong  demand  for  reliable\ncredit  and  savings  facilities  in  the  rural  area.  Although  the  level  of  education  among  rural\nhouseholds  is  not  high,  they  generally  have  long  experience  in  financial  transactions  with\nindividual  moneylenders  and  NGOs,  and  in  savings  in  the  form  of  cash,  both  in  local  and\nforeign currencies, or various forms of other assets. They are familiar with foreign exchange\nin US dollars or Thai baht. The lack of access to effective financial services is clearly a major\nconstraint to expansion of small-scale economic activities of the rural poor.

The  analyses  were  undertaken  to  ensure  that  subprojects\nconsidered most likely to be financed under the Project could generate sufficient income to\nrepay their loans and generate surplus, and that they were in the national interest.\n\n2.\nAn economic analysis of the overall project was not done because the process for a\nmicrofinance  project  precludes  accurate  identification  of  all  types  and  numbers  of\nsubprojects  to  be  financed  or  assessment  until  the  Project  is  being  implemented.\nNonetheless, the indicative subprojects were assessed to indicate the overall viability of the\nProject from the national perspective.\n\nA.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\n1.\n\nIndicative Subprojects\n\nFinancial internal rates of return (FIRR) were estimated for subprojects with multiyear\n3.\ninvestments  and  returns.  Some  subprojects  extend  over  only  two  years  with  the  capital\ninvestment at the end of one year and the returns in the following year. For agricultural crop\nsubprojects of a one-year duration, in particular rice inputs and trading, FIRRs could not be\nestimated. Agriculture-related activities include rice inputs for both wet season rice and dry\nseason irrigated rice production, small-scale irrigation, and pig raising. Pond fisheries were\nnot included as the NGOs determined that uncertain production levels and no guarantee of\nsales make them nonbankable. Palm sugar production, rice milling, silk weaving, and brick\nmaking  represent  manufacturing  enterprises.  Retail  trading,  frequently  by  women  to\nsupplement  other  household  incomes,  covers  a  broad  range  of  goods,  including  cakes,\nagricultural  produce,  bicycle  parts,  soft  drinks,  clothing,  and  various  consumer  goods  with\ndaily or weekly turnover cycles and a profit margin for each cycle of 5-15 percent. Based on\nthe  current  experience  of  NGOs,  such  subprojects  are  expected  to  account  for  about  90\npercent of loans provided under the Project.\n\n2. \n\nAssumptions\n\n4.\nPrices  used  were  those  prevailing  during  December  1998  to  January  1999.\nContinuity  in  the  current  Government  policies  and  general  inflation  relating  to  input  and\noutput prices are not expected to have a significant impact on relative prices. Physical input\nand  output  coefficients  are  based  on  data  that  were  collected  from  households  that  have\nalready received loans from NGOs and are thus considered to be indicative of the situation\nin  the  rural  area.  Unpaid  family  labor  has  been  considered  to  incur  no  cost  for  the  initial\nfinancial analysis, and returns to labor were estimated. Subsequently, the analysis has been\nrepeated with family labor calculated at the prevailing wage rate of about KR4,000 ($1) per\nday  near  provincial  towns  to  present  the  financially  most  conservative  treatment  of  labor.\nThe  expected  life  of  each  subproject  is  based  on  the  social  assessment  rather  than  an\nassessment  of  what  could be achieved  so  that  the analysis  will  reflect  the  actual  situation\nmore accurately.\n\n\fAppendix 13, page 2\n\n3.\n\nFinancial Rates of Return\n\nFIRRs for individual subprojects range from 23 percent for a small-scale rice milling\n5.\nto 91 percent for silk weaving (Table A13.1). The financial net present values for single-year\nactivities,  including  rice  inputs  and  trading,  show  positive  results.  There  is  clearly  a  wide\nrange  of  investment  opportunities  for  individual  entrepreneurs,  and  specific  demands  for\ncredit will depend largely on the experience and desires of these entrepreneurs. At the lower\nend of the spectrum are production loans for rice cropping, trading, palm sugar production,\nand pig raising requiring investments of $300 or less. Such loans are expected to be most\ncommon  as  they  support  the  types  of  activities  with  which  rural  households  are  most\nfamiliar. For small-scale irrigation, silk weaving, rice milling, and brick making, loans of $300\nor  more  will  be  required.  A  large  number  of  microenterprises  can  be  undertaken  by  rural\nhouseholds  without  significant  business  experience.  Of  these  activities,  silk  weaving\nappears  to  be  the  most  attractive,  providing  a  good  return  for  households  with  sufficient\nlabor. All of these activities appear to be financially viable and to have returns in excess of\nthe  real  interest  rates,  based  on  a  nominal  interest  rate  of  36  percent  per  annum  and  an\ninflation rate of 13 percent per annum.  Nevertheless, returns could be greatly improved with\nproper attention to technology, minimizing costs, and improved marketing.\n\n6.\nBased  on  the  subproject  budgets,  incremental  costs,  revenue,  and  employment\ngeneration are summarized in Table A13.2. Subprojects for food processing and other light\nmanufacturing  undertakings,  including  palm  sugar  production,  small-scale  rice  milling,  silk\nweaving,  and  brick  making  are  expected  to  increase  employment  opportunities.  Brick\nmaking  is  particularly  heavily dependent  on  nearby  unskilled  labor.  These  subprojects  are\nexpected  to  generate  an  average  of  about  180  person-days  per  loan  for  a  year.  Medium\nemployment subprojects include pig raising, and trading, which would create about  80-100\nperson-days per loan. Pig raising and trading are the most common activities among NGO\nsubborrowers. The medium employment subprojects are expected to account for about  60\npercent of loans. Subprojects  with  low employment  generation  include  rice  production and\nsmall-scale  irrigation,  which  would  generate  an average  of  about 20  person-days  per  loan\nand  are  expected  to  account  for  about  20  percent  of  loans.  Assuming  this  composition  of\ntypes of indicative subprojects, the Project will provide the equivalent of about 66,000 jobs.\n\nB.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n7.\nEconomic  analysis  was  undertaken  for  the  same  subprojects  as  in  the  financial\nanalysis  and  for  the  same  time  spans.  Economic  prices  for  the  main  traded  inputs  and\noutputs (predominantly rice and fertilizer) were based on the latest World Bank commodity\nprice projections and were adjusted to constant 1998 values using the standard index. The\naverage  price  of  rice  was  estimated based  on  the  existing  situation  of  export  to  Viet  Nam\nand  Thailand  during  months  of  surplus  and  imports  from  those  areas  during  months  of\ndeficit. Fertilizer prices were estimated at import parity reflecting the likely ongoing need for\nCambodia to import fertilizer. Border prices were adjusted to farm-gate prices by allowing for\nthe  economic  values  of \nlivestock  and\nmanufactured  goods,  which  all  tend  to  be  nontraded  commodities,  the  market  price  was\nadjusted  by  a  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.9,  and  the  financial  prices  of  all  other\nnontraded inputs were also adjusted by  a  standard  conversion factor  of  0.9  in accordance\nwith the procedures used by the Asian Development Bank in recent studies for Cambodia.\nThe economic cost of labor was estimated using an appropriately defined shadow wage rate\n\ntransport,  processing,  and  marketing.  For \n\n\fAppendix 13, page 3\n\nfor  employees  and  potential  beneficiaries  in  the  rural  area.  Given  the  wide  range  of\nsubprojects  and  the differing  capabilities of potential  subborrowers, a  single  shadow  wage\nrate  did  not  appear  appropriate.  Consequently,  two  rates  (0.95  and  0.75)  were  used\nreflecting the differing alternative  opportunities for  entrepreneurial family  labor  and general\nworkers, respectively.\n\n8.\nEconomic internal rates of return could not be estimated for the two rice production\nactivities and trading as these represented single-year activities. However, the economic net\npresent  values  show  they  are  beneficial  from  the  viewpoint  of  the  national  interest.  The\neconomic  internal  rates  of  return  of  the  remaining  enterprises  also  show  their  economic\nviability  (Table A13.1).  Those  of  small-scale  processing  and  manufacturing  range  from  24\npercent to 62 percent, showing high economic viability.\n\nC.\n\nNonquantifiable Benefits\n\n9.\nA  substantial  level  of  nonquantifiable  benefits  will  accrue  from  the  Project.\nAppropriate  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks  will  be  established  for  rural  finance.\nSubborrowers  will  benefit  from  skill  development  and  environmental  awareness  activities,\nwhich will be beneficial in the long term. Licensed financial institutions (LFI) are expected to\nimprove their management skills, to gain a greater appreciation of environmental issues and\nhow they can be addressed through credit programs, and to achieve financial sustainability.\nThis  will  enable  them  to  expand  their  services  in  a  profitable  and  sustainable  manner.\nFurthermore, they  will  be able  to  apply the  skills  obtained  to all  of  their  clients,  as  well  as\nfuture  clients,  many  of  whom  will  not  be  direct  beneficiaries  of  the  Project.  Similarly,  the\ninstitutional  strengthening  of  the  Rural  Development  Bank  in  banking  and  financial\nmanagement and the National Bank of Cambodia in the supervision of financial institutions\nwill  create  bodies  able  to  manage  microfinance  activities  efficiently  and  in  a  sustainable\nmanner.\n\nD.\n\nRisks and Sensitivity Analysis\n\n10.\nThe  main  project  risks  from  the  subborrowers\u2019  perspectives  are  that  individual\nsubprojects will cost more to implement than expected or will produce lower than expected\nnet benefits. Risks of a 10 percent increase in investment costs and a 10 percent decrease\nin net benefits have been assessed separately for each indicative subproject with multiyear\ninvestments  and  returns.  The  results  show  considerable  variations  between  subprojects\n(Table A13.3).  From a financial perspective, pig  raising,  small-scale  rice  milling,  and  palm\nsugar  production  are  relatively  more  sensitive  to  changes  in  investment  costs  and  net\nbenefits. From an economic perspective, pig raising and palm sugar production are the most\nsensitive ones. Other enterprises appear sufficiently robust.\n\n11.\nThe major  risk for  LFIs  would be for  the  Government  to  limit  interest  rates on  their\nlending. This would, eventually, result in a decrease in very small loans due to difficulties in\ncost recovery. The Government has a free interest rate policy, which needs to be retained.\nSimilarly, the Government should not impose high cost barriers to the opening of provincial\nand  district  branches.  Changes  in  other  financial  variables  such  as  loan  loss  and  cost  of\nfunds  can  be  accommodated  by  LFIs  through  sound  management,  accurate  and  prompt\nfinancial reporting, and flexibility in their pricing of products.\n\n\f0\n\n0\n\n29\n\n54\n\n0\n\n60\n\n23\n\n91\n\n30\n\n0\n\n0\n\nTable  A13.1:  Summary Results of Financial and Economic Analyses\n\nAppendix 13, page 4\n\nFIRR\n(%)\n\nFNPV at 12%\n(KR thousand)\n\nFIRR (%) with\nHired Labora\n\nEIRR\n(%)\n\nENPV at 12%\n(KR thousand)\n\nSmall-Scale Irrigation\n\n         \n\n564\n\n           \n\n13\n\n        \n\n46\n\n       \n\n1,163\n\nSubproject\n\nFertilizer for Rice (wet season)\n\nFertilizer for Rice (dry season, irrigated)\n\nPig Raising\n\nTrading\n\nPalm Sugar Production\n\nSmall-Scale Rice Milling\n\nSilk Weaving\n\nBrick Making\n\n           \n\n45\n\n         \n\n105\n\n         \n\n618\n\n         \n\n607\n\n         \n\n667\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-8\n\n0\n\n0\n\n            \n\n63\n\n          \n\n145\n\n0\n\n          \n\n783\n\n        \n\n24\n\n          \n\n128\n\n        \n\n29\n\n       \n\n1,057\n\n         \n\n843\n\n           \n\n12\n\n        \n\n13\n\n            \n\n18\n\n      \n\n2,728\n\n           \n\n32\n\n        \n\n62\n\n       \n\n1,468\n\n     \n\n16,235\n\n           \n\n23\n\n        \n\n34\n\n     \n\n18,023\n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, ENPV = economic net present value, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, FNPV = financial net present value.\na Hired labor assumed at the wage rate of about KR4,000 per day.
