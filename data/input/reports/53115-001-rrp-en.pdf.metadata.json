The  report  also  describes  the \nproposed  administration  of  a  loan  of  up  to  $25,000,000  to  be  provided  by  the  Leading  Asia\u2019s \nPrivate Infrastructure Fund (LEAP),1 and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under \nthe authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the loan.  \n \n2. \nThe  proposed  loan  will  support  the  construction,  launch,  and  operation  of  a  shared, \ngeostationary  earth  orbit  (GEO),  high-throughput  satellite  (HTS)  (Kacific-1),  featuring  Ka-band \ntechnology, which will be dedicated to low cost, high-speed, easily accessible broadband internet \nin Asia and the Pacific.2 The project will provide wide access to broadband internet connections \nin remote areas, where no or very limited internet coverage is currently available. The project will \nbenefit the population in remote areas of Asia and the Pacific by increasing the availability and \nquality of broadband internet service, which will lead to greater sustainable socioeconomic growth \nand poverty reduction. \n\nA. \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n3. \nProject identification. Universal access to information and communication technologies \n(ICTs)  is  critical  in  fostering  a  country\u2019s  socioeconomic  growth  and  development.  Increasing \ninternet connections can (i) improve access to domestic and regional markets for the local people, \nproducers, and manufacturers; (ii) attract private investment; (iii) reduce urban\u2013rural development \ngaps;  and  (iv)  help  reap  gains  from  regional  connectivity  and  integration.  Internet  coverage  in \nremote villages will provide rural poor people with access to better communication with families \nand communities; access to information, news, finance, health, and education; and better delivery \nof government services.3 Overall, this will stimulate economic development, providing access to \nimproved jobs and small- and medium-sized business opportunities. According to a report of the \nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), concerns continue \nto emerge about growing digital inequalities between countries, sexes, ages, and regions.4 The \ngap  in  internet  availability,  and  the  resulting  gap  in  economic  benefits  of  such  connectivity, \nbetween emerging and developed countries may effectively grow larger every year.   \n \nOver 2 billion people in  Asia and the Pacific do not have access to broadband internet \n4. \nconnections,  either  because  they  live  in  areas  which  are  not  connected  to  a  terrestrial  cable \nnetwork or because internet service currently offered is too expensive.5 At the end of 2018, mobile \ninternet penetration in the Pacific islands was the lowest of any region in the world at just 18% of \nthe population.6 Geographical challenges, as well as a lack of critical user mass, have so far left \nmany Pacific islands, as well as remote areas in Indonesia and the Philippines, underserved by \n\n                                                 \n1  Financing partner: Japan International Cooperation Agency. \n2  The satellite will cover Bangladesh, Bhutan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, New Zealand, the Pacific islands, \n\nPapua New Guinea, and the Philippines. \n\n3  Including  food  security,  disaster  risk  reduction,  natural  resource  management,  trade,  energy,  transport,  public \n\n4  International  Telecommunication  Union.  2018.

Recently, several subsea \ncables have successfully been rolled out, connecting most Pacific island nations as well as some \nof the outer islands of Indonesia. However, these cable connections only reach the main urban \nareas, and do not extend to more rural and remote areas of these countries as the deployment of \na terrestrial distribution network takes time and is very costly. Satellite services could instantly \nextend to most of these markets. However, most of the current satellite services available either \nhave  no  spare  capacity  or  they  provide  a  very  expensive  resource  because  of  the  high  initial \ncapital expenditures and the costly antennas needed. Nevertheless, satellites have proven to be \nable to reach the last mile, connecting remote areas that otherwise remain unserved.   \n \n5. \nKacific Broadband Satellites Limited was created to provide low-cost, high-speed internet \naccess to these unserved and underserved areas in Asia and the Pacific which are hard to reach \nwith conventional terrestrial internet networks. The GEO HTS, equipped with Ka-band payload,7 \nwill be able to operate with standard, low cost, end-user antennas, and therefore Kacific will be \nable to offer internet service at a much lower cost than currently available in the market. Given \nthat long term financing for this subsector in this region remains scarce, the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) was requested to provide a long term, senior, secured loan facility for the project. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n6. \nHTS equipped with Ka-band payload.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n7. \nWholesale  satellite  broadband  internet  service  will  be  sold  to  telecommunication \noperators, internet service providers (ISPs) and governments across Asia and the Pacific. Kacific \nwill take care of the infrastructure upstream of the satellite by signing teleport agreements with \nspecialized teleport operators to connect the satellite to the internet backbone through existing \nfiber networks.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n \n8. \nBorrowers.

Through low cost broadband solutions for rural and remote pockets of demand, \nthe  project  will  extend  broadband  internet  service  and  enable  better  access  to  information, \ncommunication, and social and economic opportunities and therefore directly support Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal (SDG) 9c.10  \n \n12. \ninternet service in unserved and underserved areas increased.  \n \n13. \nAsia and the Pacific including in unserved or underserved areas.   \n \nC. \n\nOutcome.  The  project  will  have  the following  outcome:  availability  of  reliable  broadband \n\nOutput. The project will have the following output: GEO HTS capacity increased across \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n \n14. \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  Strategy  2030  highlights  ICT \nsolutions as a key driver for positive change in various sectors and emphasizes the role of digital \ntechnology more broadly in seven of its operational priorities.11 Also, Strategy 2030 states that \nADB  will  support  countries  to  develop  policies  and  improve  the  regulatory  environment for  the \ndigital economy, expand internet connectivity, and invest in hardware and software, particularly \npromoting  private  sector  participation  in  infrastructure  including  communication  technologies \ntargeting remote areas and populations. The project directly contributes to ADB\u2019s commitment to \nimprove connectivity and access to ICT in rural areas as well as in small island developing states. \nAccess to broadband internet is a vital tool to accelerate progress towards realizing the SDGs \nand  the  resulting  ADB  operational  priorities  such  as  human  development  and  social  inclusion, \nimproved  education,  better  health  access,  gender  equality  and  food  security.  Through  the \navailability  of  broadband  based  technologies,  the  project  can  assist  in  climate  adaptation  and \ndisaster resilience as well as climate-smart agricultural practices.  \n \n15. \nReducing the costs of doing business and providing social services by increasing access \nto  ICT  is  one  of  the  three  strategic  priorities  of  the  ADB  Pacific  Approach  2016\u20132020.  The \nIndonesian  National  Medium-Term  Development  Plan  2015\u20132019  includes  specific  targets  to \nextend broadband technologies to all cities and regions.12 The Philippines National Broadband \nPlan  (2017)  was  developed  to  accelerate  investments  in  broadband  technologies  to  improve \navailability, affordability and quality of broadband internet access throughout the country.13 \n \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  ADB\u2019s  policy  and \n16. \nstrategy framework for the ICT subsector14 states that ICT is widely recognized as a potentially \npowerful tool in the fight against world poverty, with the capacity to provide developing countries \nwith an unprecedented opportunity to meet vital development goals such as poverty reduction, \nbasic  health  care,  and  education. The  ICT  policy  also  states  that  ADB\u2019s assistance  to the  ICT \nsubsector must encourage regional cooperation and networking to enhance local development \nefforts and promote private sector participation in ICT development.

The  project  will  be  ADB\u2019s  first  satellite  financing. \nHowever, the project will benefit from ADB\u2019s experience gained from structuring and implementing \nsubmarine  cable  projects  in  the  Pacific  through  ADB\u2019s  sovereign  lending  window.  ADB\u2019s \nexperience indicates that successful ICT project implementation depends on allocating the right \nproven technology for the target end users and that competition is required to lower the prices by \na  meaningful  magnitude.  Markets  with  only  a  single  submarine  cable  or  satellite  internet \nconnection  remain  very  expensive,  whereas  the  introduction  of  competition  lowers  pricing \nsubstantially.  Delivery  of  submarine  internet  cables  has  increased  the  demand  for  data  usage \nthroughout  any  country,  but  terrestrial  networks  often  remain  expensive  to  roll  out  beyond  a \ncertain  population  density,  while  satellites  have  proven  to  be  able  to  reach  the  last  mile, \nconnecting remote areas at a competitive price using simple, proven technology both in orbit as \nwell as for ground segments.  \n \nD. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements.15 \n\nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n\nAspects \n\nRegulatory framework \n\nManagement \n\nImplementation period \nConstruction arrangements \n\n \nSatellite manufacturer \nOperations arrangements \nRevenue structure \nOfftakers \nLaunch \nOperation and maintenance \n\nTeleports \n\nInsurance \nPerformance monitoring \n\nRights  to  transmit  from  a  particular  orbital  slot  are  granted  by  the \nInternational Telecommunication Union.   \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \nEach of Kacific\u2019s management team members have over 20  years of \nexperience in the satellite, telecommunication, or space industry.

Indeed, access to internet will stimulate economic growth and \ngenerate employment (SDG 8) and, therefore, reduce poverty (SDG 1) and inequality (SDG 10) \nmainly between rural and urban areas, and between developed and developing countries. Access \nto  internet  service  will  likewise  help  make  improvements  under  SDG  5  (gender  equality  and \nwomen\u2019s  empowerment).  The  rapid  deployment  and  space-based  technology  make  satellite-\nbased  internet  highly  suitable  for  providing  emergency  communications  during  disasters, \naddressing SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong \ninstitutions).  Several  government  entities  have  signed  contracts  with  Kacific  to  connect  health \nclinics and schools, supporting SDG 3 (good health and well-being) and SDG 4 (education). \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\n \nADB\u2019s  assistance  consists  of  (i)  a  proposed  direct  loan  of  up  to  $25  million;  and  (ii)  a \n20. \nproposed parallel loan of up to $25 million, to be provided by LEAP and administered by ADB \n(footnote 1).  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nADB\u2019s participation in the project will add substantial value in the following ways: \n(i)  Securing long-term financing necessary for any large-scale infrastructure investments \nremains  a  challenge  in  least  developed  countries,  especially  for  large  and  unusual \nprojects  like  this.  ADB\u2019s  role  as  a  senior  lender,  including  administration  of  the \nproposed loan from LEAP, will enable the project to mobilize a significant amount of \nlong-term debt from senior co-lenders and junior lenders. Without the engagement of \ndevelopment financial institutions, this project would likely not materialize.  \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\nRisks \n\nC. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \n22. \nStatement (2009) as follows: environment category B, involuntary resettlement category C and \nindigenous peoples category C.16 The project categorization is based on the most environmentally \nsensitive component of the project which is the Subic teleport site, located within the Subic Bay \nForest Reserve area. \n\n                                                 \n16 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories  \n\n \n\nB. \n\n \n21. \n\n    \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n23. \nAn environmental and social audit for existing facilities, and environmental assessment \nfor the satellite antennas (teleport gateways), has been undertaken by an external consultant to \nassess  the  project\u2019s  compliance  against  ADB  safeguards  principles. 17  Impacts  and  risks \nassociated  with  each  project  component  were  analyzed  in  the  context  of  the  project\u2019s  area  of \ninfluence.  Arrangements  for  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  satellite  are  defined  in  the \ncondosat agreement between Kacific and JSAT. Kacific has limited influence over the facilities \ninvolved in the construction, launch, and operation of the satellite and they do not fall within the \ndefinition of associated facilities under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The project gateways \nwill connect the satellite to a terrestrial internet connection.18 The gateways will be installed in five \nexisting  teleport  sites  which  are  tailored  for  broadcast,  data  and  communications  services. \nConstruction  of  these  gateways  is  expected  to  result  in  minimal  environmental  impacts  since \nactivities will be small scale, take place for a short duration of 2\u20133 months and will not involve \nland clearing. The existing Subic teleport site is located along an existing road network connected \nto the  Subic  Bay  Freeport  Zone.  Precautions  will  be  undertaken  during the  construction  in the \nSubic teleport site to reduce temporary disturbances (including noise, light and traffic impacts) to \npotentially sensitive fauna which may reside within the vicinity of the teleport site. The very-small-\naperture terminals to receive the satellite signal at the user end will be owned by the ultimate end-\nusers and vary in size from about 0.75 meters for private individuals (through ISPs) up to 4.50 \nmeters for government or corporate offtake. These antennas are not covered in the project scope \nand will have no or minimal environmental, health and safety impacts.  \n \n24. \nThe due diligence identified key corrective actions for the project including development \nof  construction  and  operations  environmental  management  plans  with  a  focus  on  biodiversity \nimpacts; procedures to ensure proper labor and working conditions ; and a simple framework to \noversee the environmental and social monitoring and reporting of the project in accordance with \nthe ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements.  \n \nLand acquisition and involuntary resettlement are not triggered on account of the project\u2019s \n25. \nactivities as only existing facilities will be utilized. Gateway equipment will be installed on available \nland within existing teleport farms; thus, no additional land is required.19 No impact on indigenous \npeoples is anticipated as they are not known to be present at the project sites.   \n \n26. \nOther social aspects. Kacific is a recently established company that has yet to formalize \nits own human resource policies and processes. This does not appear to be a significant issue \ngiven the nature of the project. The environmental and social compliance audit recommends the \npreparation of a policy aligned with applicable standards and the development of mechanisms to \nensure that work undertaken by third parties on the company\u2019s behalf follow such standards.  \n \n27. \nKacific  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection \nStrategy  (2001),  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor \nstandards.20 The  client  will  report  regularly  to  ADB  on  (i)  its  own  compliance  and  that  of  its \n\n                                                 \n17 Due diligence for the Indonesian sites is still pending and will be conducted after the finalization of the agreement \n\nbetween Kacific and respective companies. \n\n18 Gateways  include  the  satellite  antenna,  uplink  and  downlink  radiofrequency  system,  monitor  and  control  data \ninterface equipment, and other electronics required for the Internet protocol inter-site signal transmission system. \n19 The  Indonesia  sites  have  yet  to  be  finalized;  nevertheless,  no  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement  is \n\nanticipated as only existing facilities are being considered. \n\n20 ADB. 2003. Social Protection. Manila (adopted in 2001). \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\ncontractors with such laws, and (ii) the measures taken. Information disclosure and consultation \nwith affected people will follow ADB requirements.21 \n \n28. \nNo  gender  elements.  Kacific\u2019s  operations  are  fairly  limited  to  around  25  management \nprofessionals to date, and up to 45 staff during full operation. Given the nature of the project and \nKacific\u2019s business, there is very limited opportunity for any gender action. However, by the very \nnature  of  this  project  it  will  support  gender  equality  by  providing  low-cost  broadband  internet \nconnection  to  governments  which  intend  to  connect  remote  schools  and  hospitals  (including \nmaternity clinics). These facilities will serve remote people equally, whereas remote women and \ngirls are often more disadvantaged in accessing these kinds of facilities than men and boys are.  \n\nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \n29. \nKacific-1 Limited and Kacific Broadband Satellites International Limited were advised of \nADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to combating corruption, money \nlaundering,  and the financing  of terrorism.  ADB will  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation \nincludes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of \nterrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n\nThe  proposed  loan  is  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single \n\nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\n \n30. \nexposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n\nD. \n\nAssurances \n\n \nConsistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),22 \n31. \nADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon  establishing  that  the  Government  of \nIndonesia and the Government of the Philippines have no objection to the proposed assistance \nto Kacific-1 Limited and Kacific Broadband Satellites International Limited. ADB will enter into a \nsuitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of \nthe proposed assistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n32. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  up  to \n$25,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to Kacific-1 Limited and Kacific Broadband \nSatellites International Limited for the Asia\u2013Pacific Remote Broadband Internet Satellite Project \nwith  such  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  this \nreport, and as may be reported to the Board. \n\n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n2 July 2019 \n\n                                                 \n21 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy; and Safeguards and Social Dimensions (accessible from the list \n\nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n22 ADB. 1966.
