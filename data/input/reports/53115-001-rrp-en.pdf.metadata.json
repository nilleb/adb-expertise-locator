THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $25,000,000 to Kacific-1 Limited and Kacific Broadband Satellites International Limited for \nthe Asia\u2013Pacific Remote Broadband Internet Satellite Project. The report also describes the \nproposed administration of a loan of up to $25,000,000 to be provided by the Leading Asia\u2019s \nPrivate Infrastructure Fund (LEAP),1 and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under \nthe authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the loan.  \n \n2.  The proposed loan will support the construction, launch, and operation of a shared, \ngeostationary earth orbit (GEO), high-throughput satellite (HTS) (Kacific-1), featuring Ka-band \ntechnology, which will be dedicated to low cost, high-speed, easily accessible broadband internet \nin Asia and the Pacific.2 The project will provide wide access to broadband internet connections \nin remote areas, where no or very limited internet coverage is currently available. The project will \nbenefit the population in remote areas of Asia and the Pacific by increasing the availability and \nquality of broadband internet service, which will lead to greater sustainable socioeconomic growth \nand poverty reduction. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Project identification. Universal access to information and communication technologies \n(ICTs) is critical in fostering a country\u2019s socioeconomic growth and development. Increasing \ninternet connections can (i) improve access to domestic and regional markets for the local people, \nproducers, and manufacturers; (ii) attract private investment; (iii) reduce urban\u2013rural development \ngaps; and (iv) help reap gains from regional connectivity and integration. Internet coverage in \nremote villages will provide rural poor people with access to better communication with families \nand communities; access to information, news, finance, health, and education; and better delivery \nof government services.3 Overall, this will stimulate economic development, providing access to \nimproved jobs and small- and medium-sized business opportunities. According to a report of the \nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), concerns continue \nto emerge about growing digital inequalities between countries, sexes, ages, and regions.4 The \ngap in internet availability, and the resulting gap in economic benefits of such connectivity, \nbetween emerging and developed countries may effectively grow larger every year.   \n \n4.  Over 2 billion people in Asia and the Pacific do not have access to broadband internet \nconnections, either because they live in areas which are not connected to a terrestrial cable \nnetwork or because internet service currently offered is too expensive.5 At the end of 2018, mobile \ninternet penetration in the Pacific islands was the lowest of any region in the world at just 18% of \nthe population.6 Geographical challenges, as well as a lack of critical user mass, have so far left \nmany Pacific islands, as well as remote areas in Indonesia and the Philippines, underserved by \n                                                \n1  Financing partner: Japan International Cooperation Agency. \n2  The satellite will cover Bangladesh, Bhutan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, New Zealand, the Pacific islands, \nPapua New Guinea, and the Philippines. \n3  Including food security, disaster risk reduction, natural resource management, trade, energy, transport, public \ngovernance and taxation. \n4  International  Telecommunication  Union.  2018.

Recently, several subsea \ncables have successfully been rolled out, connecting most Pacific island nations as well as some \nof the outer islands of Indonesia. However, these cable connections only reach the main urban \nareas, and do not extend to more rural and remote areas of these countries as the deployment of \na terrestrial distribution network takes time and is very costly. Satellite services could instantly \nextend to most of these markets. However, most of the current satellite services available either \nhave no spare capacity or they provide a very expensive resource because of the high initial \ncapital expenditures and the costly antennas needed. Nevertheless, satellites have proven to be \nable to reach the last mile, connecting remote areas that otherwise remain unserved.   \n \n5.  Kacific Broadband Satellites Limited was created to provide low-cost, high-speed internet \naccess to these unserved and underserved areas in Asia and the Pacific which are hard to reach \nwith conventional terrestrial internet networks. The GEO HTS, equipped with Ka-band payload,7 \nwill be able to operate with standard, low cost, end-user antennas, and therefore Kacific will be \nable to offer internet service at a much lower cost than currently available in the market. Given \nthat long term financing for this subsector in this region remains scarce, the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) was requested to provide a long term, senior, secured loan facility for the project. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n6.  Project design. The project involves the construction, launch and operation of a GEO \nHTS equipped with Ka-band payload.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n7.  Wholesale  satellite  broadband  internet  service  will  be  sold  to  telecommunication \noperators, internet service providers (ISPs) and governments across Asia and the Pacific. Kacific \nwill take care of the infrastructure upstream of the satellite by signing teleport agreements with \nspecialized teleport operators to connect the satellite to the internet backbone through existing \nfiber networks.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n \n8.  Borrowers. The borrowers are Kacific-1 Limited, a Singapore-incorporated company to \nbe established, and Kacific Broadband Satellites International Limited, a Vanuatu-incorporated \ncompany  acting  as  the  operating  entity.  They  are  both  fully  owned  by  Kacific  which  was \nestablished in Singapore in 2013. \n \n9.  Project shareholders.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n  \n10.

Through low cost broadband solutions for rural and remote pockets of demand, \nthe project will extend broadband internet service and enable better access to information, \ncommunication, and social and economic opportunities and therefore directly support Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal (SDG) 9c.10  \n \n12.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: availability of reliable broadband \ninternet service in unserved and underserved areas increased.  \n \n13.  Output. The project will have the following output: GEO HTS capacity increased across \nAsia and the Pacific including in unserved or underserved areas.   \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n14.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. Strategy 2030 highlights ICT \nsolutions as a key driver for positive change in various sectors and emphasizes the role of digital \ntechnology more broadly in seven of its operational priorities.11 Also, Strategy 2030 states that \nADB will support countries to develop policies and improve the regulatory environment for the \ndigital economy, expand internet connectivity, and invest in hardware and software, particularly \npromoting private sector participation in infrastructure including communication technologies \ntargeting remote areas and populations. The project directly contributes to ADB\u2019s commitment to \nimprove connectivity and access to ICT in rural areas as well as in small island developing states. \nAccess to broadband internet is a vital tool to accelerate progress towards realizing the SDGs \nand the resulting ADB operational priorities such as human development and social inclusion, \nimproved  education,  better  health  access,  gender  equality  and  food  security.  Through  the \navailability of broadband based technologies, the project can assist in climate adaptation and \ndisaster resilience as well as climate-smart agricultural practices.  \n \n15.  Reducing the costs of doing business and providing social services by increasing access \nto ICT is one of the three strategic priorities of the ADB Pacific Approach 2016\u20132020. The \nIndonesian National Medium-Term Development Plan 2015\u20132019 includes specific targets to \nextend broadband technologies to all cities and regions.12 The Philippines National Broadband \nPlan (2017) was developed to accelerate investments in broadband technologies to improve \navailability, affordability and quality of broadband internet access throughout the country.13 \n \n16.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. ADB\u2019s policy and \nstrategy framework for the ICT subsector14 states that ICT is widely recognized as a potentially \npowerful tool in the fight against world poverty, with the capacity to provide developing countries \nwith an unprecedented opportunity to meet vital development goals such as poverty reduction, \nbasic health care, and education. The ICT policy also states that ADB\u2019s assistance to the ICT \nsubsector must encourage regional cooperation and networking to enhance local development \nefforts and promote private sector participation in ICT development.

Lessons from previous operations. The project will be ADB\u2019s first satellite financing. \nHowever, the project will benefit from ADB\u2019s experience gained from structuring and implementing \nsubmarine  cable  projects  in  the  Pacific  through  ADB\u2019s  sovereign  lending  window.  ADB\u2019s \nexperience indicates that successful ICT project implementation depends on allocating the right \nproven technology for the target end users and that competition is required to lower the prices by \na  meaningful  magnitude.  Markets  with  only  a  single  submarine  cable  or  satellite  internet \nconnection  remain  very  expensive,  whereas  the  introduction  of  competition  lowers  pricing \nsubstantially. Delivery of submarine internet cables has increased the demand for data usage \nthroughout any country, but terrestrial networks often remain expensive to roll out beyond a \ncertain  population  density,  while  satellites  have  proven  to  be  able  to  reach  the  last  mile, \nconnecting remote areas at a competitive price using simple, proven technology both in orbit as \nwell as for ground segments.  \n \nD.

Projected Financial and Economic Performance \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nG.  Unique Features \n \n19.  Broadband internet is a vital tool to accelerate development and supports several SDGs \ndirectly (SDG 9c) and indirectly. Indeed, access to internet will stimulate economic growth and \ngenerate employment (SDG 8) and, therefore, reduce poverty (SDG 1) and inequality (SDG 10) \nmainly between rural and urban areas, and between developed and developing countries. Access \nto internet service will likewise help make improvements under SDG 5 (gender equality and \nwomen\u2019s empowerment). The rapid deployment and space-based technology make satellite-\nbased  internet  highly  suitable  for  providing  emergency  communications  during  disasters, \naddressing SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong \ninstitutions). Several government entities have signed contracts with Kacific to connect health \nclinics and schools, supporting SDG 3 (good health and well-being) and SDG 4 (education). \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n20.  ADB\u2019s assistance consists of (i) a proposed direct loan of up to $25 million; and (ii) a \nproposed parallel loan of up to $25 million, to be provided by LEAP and administered by ADB \n(footnote 1).  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s participation in the project will add substantial value in the following ways: \n(i)  Securing long-term financing necessary for any large-scale infrastructure investments \nremains a challenge in least developed countries, especially for large and unusual \nprojects  like this.  ADB\u2019s  role  as  a  senior  lender,  including  administration  of  the \nproposed loan from LEAP, will enable the project to mobilize a significant amount of \nlong-term debt from senior co-lenders and junior lenders. Without the engagement of \ndevelopment financial institutions, this project would likely not materialize.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nC.  Risks \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n    \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n22.  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) as follows: environment category B, involuntary resettlement category C and \nindigenous peoples category C.16 The project categorization is based on the most environmentally \nsensitive component of the project which is the Subic teleport site, located within the Subic Bay \nForest Reserve area. \n                                                \n16 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories  \n ", "6 \n \n23.  An environmental and social audit for existing facilities, and environmental assessment \nfor the satellite antennas (teleport gateways), has been undertaken by an external consultant to \nassess  the  project\u2019s  compliance  against  ADB  safeguards  principles.17 Impacts  and  risks \nassociated with each project component were analyzed in the context of the project\u2019s area of \ninfluence. Arrangements for the construction and operation of the satellite are defined in the \ncondosat agreement between Kacific and JSAT. Kacific has limited influence over the facilities \ninvolved in the construction, launch, and operation of the satellite and they do not fall within the \ndefinition of associated facilities under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The project gateways \nwill connect the satellite to a terrestrial internet connection.18 The gateways will be installed in five \nexisting teleport sites which are tailored for broadcast, data and communications services. \nConstruction of these gateways is expected to result in minimal environmental impacts since \nactivities will be small scale, take place for a short duration of 2\u20133 months and will not involve \nland clearing. The existing Subic teleport site is located along an existing road network connected \nto the Subic Bay Freeport Zone. Precautions will be undertaken during the construction in the \nSubic teleport site to reduce temporary disturbances (including noise, light and traffic impacts) to \npotentially sensitive fauna which may reside within the vicinity of the teleport site. The very-small-\naperture terminals to receive the satellite signal at the user end will be owned by the ultimate end-\nusers and vary in size from about 0.75 meters for private individuals (through ISPs) up to 4.50 \nmeters for government or corporate offtake. These antennas are not covered in the project scope \nand will have no or minimal environmental, health and safety impacts.  \n \n24.  The due diligence identified key corrective actions for the project including development \nof construction and operations environmental management plans with a focus on biodiversity \nimpacts; procedures to ensure proper labor and working conditions ; and a simple framework to \noversee the environmental and social monitoring and reporting of the project in accordance with \nthe ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements.  \n \n25.  Land acquisition and involuntary resettlement are not triggered on account of the project\u2019s \nactivities as only existing facilities will be utilized. Gateway equipment will be installed on available \nland within existing teleport farms; thus, no additional land is required.19 No impact on indigenous \npeoples is anticipated as they are not known to be present at the project sites.   \n \n26.  Other social aspects. Kacific is a recently established company that has yet to formalize \nits own human resource policies and processes. This does not appear to be a significant issue \ngiven the nature of the project. The environmental and social compliance audit recommends the \npreparation of a policy aligned with applicable standards and the development of mechanisms to \nensure that work undertaken by third parties on the company\u2019s behalf follow such standards.  \n \n27.  Kacific will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy (2001), will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor \nstandards.20 The client will report regularly to ADB on (i) its own compliance and that of its \n                                                \n17 Due diligence for the Indonesian sites is still pending and will be conducted after the finalization of the agreement \nbetween Kacific and respective companies. \n18 Gateways include the satellite antenna, uplink and downlink radiofrequency system, monitor and control data \ninterface equipment, and other electronics required for the Internet protocol inter-site signal transmission system. \n19 The Indonesia sites have yet to be finalized; nevertheless, no land acquisition and involuntary resettlement is \nanticipated as only existing facilities are being considered. \n20 ADB. 2003. Social Protection. Manila (adopted in 2001). \n \n ", "7 \ncontractors with such laws, and (ii) the measures taken. Information disclosure and consultation \nwith affected people will follow ADB requirements.21 \n \n28.  No gender elements. Kacific\u2019s operations are fairly limited to around 25 management \nprofessionals to date, and up to 45 staff during full operation. Given the nature of the project and \nKacific\u2019s business, there is very limited opportunity for any gender action. However, by the very \nnature of this project it will support gender equality by providing low-cost broadband internet \nconnection to governments which intend to connect remote schools and hospitals (including \nmaternity clinics). These facilities will serve remote people equally, whereas remote women and \ngirls are often more disadvantaged in accessing these kinds of facilities than men and boys are.  \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n29.  Kacific-1 Limited and Kacific Broadband Satellites International Limited were advised of \nADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to combating corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the investment documentation \nincludes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the financing of \nterrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n \n30.  The  proposed  loan  is  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single \nexposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n31.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),22 \nADB  will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of \nIndonesia and the Government of the Philippines have no objection to the proposed assistance \nto Kacific-1 Limited and Kacific Broadband Satellites International Limited. ADB will enter into a \nsuitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of \nthe proposed assistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n32.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of up to \n$25,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to Kacific-1 Limited and Kacific Broadband \nSatellites International Limited for the Asia\u2013Pacific Remote Broadband Internet Satellite Project \nwith such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this \nreport, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n2 July 2019 \n                                                \n21 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy; and Safeguards and Social Dimensions (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 ADB. 1966.
