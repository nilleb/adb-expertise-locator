It \nwill  (i) provide  roads  to  three  district  headquarters  which  are  not \ncurrently connected and upgrade existing connection roads to all-\nweather  condition  in  17  districts  (of  the  country\u2019s  75  districts); \n(ii) enhance capacity building of the Department of Roads (DOR) \nin  carrying  out  road  feasibility  studies\u2014in  terms  of  economic, \nsocial, and safeguard aspects; and (iii) enhance capacity building \nof  local  construction  and  consulting  services  industries  in  road \nconstruction and contract management.   \n\nThe  Project  is  the  first  ADB  sector  modality  intervention  in  the \ntransport  sector  in  Nepal.  A  programmatic  approach  has  been \nadopted  to  identify,  screen,  and  prioritize  candidate  roads.  The \napproach  provides  flexibility  in  project  implementation  under  the \npresent conflict situation in Nepal. \n \nPoor  road  connectivity  is  a  major  development  constraint  for  the \ncountry.  Inadequate  feeder  roads  worsen  the  isolation  of  remote \nrural  areas,  mostly  in  northern  hilly  regions.  Rehabilitating  and \nexpanding  feeder  roads  will  contribute  to  inclusive  social  and \neconomic  development.  Improved  access  of  remote  people  to \nsocial  facilities  and  employment  opportunities  in  major  towns  will \nhelp  foster  a  broad-based  and  inclusive  social  and  economic \ndevelopment  process  to  achieve  a  steady  decline  in  poverty. \nADB\u2019s  support  for  the  inclusive  development  process  will  assist \nthe  Government \nthe \ndevelopment  of  different  regions  of  the  country;  (ii) improving  the \npoor\u2019s  access  to  basic  services,  opportunities  for  economic \nadvancement,  and  participation  in  the  development  process;  and \n(iii) addressing  the  needs  of  disadvantaged,  women,  ethnic \ngroups, and lower castes. \n\n(i)  promoting  greater  balance \n\nin \n\nin \n\nThe  Project  is  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  priority  strategies \nwhich plan to complete road connection to all districts in the next \n10  years,  particularly  in  the  northern  part  of  the  country.  The \ncandidate  roads  are  included  in  the  Government\u2019s  10-Year  Road \n\n \n\n \n\n\fSector Midterm Program (2006\u20132015).  \n\n \n\nThe  Project  recognizes  the  importance  of  preventing  HIV/AIDS \nand  human  trafficking,  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  10th  5-year- \nplan (2002\u20132007). The Project will (i) carry out designed activities \nto  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  groups  at  risk  to  HIV/AIDS  and \ntrafficking, and (ii) increase access to HIV prevention services. \n \nThe  Project  will  (i)  support  economic  growth,  particularly  in  rural \ncommunities;  and  (ii)  help  reduce  the  poverty  of  isolated  people, \nmainly  in  hilly  areas. An  expanded  and  rehabilitated  feeder  road \nsystem  in  remote  areas  is  expected  to  enhance  access  to \nmarkets,  employment  opportunities,  and  health  and  education \nservice  centers  in  major  towns  and  district  headquarters.  It  will \nalso  contribute  to  sustained  and  broad-based  economic  growth \nand  inclusive  social  development.  The  Project  will  construct  new \nfeeder  roads  to  three  district  headquarters  and  upgrade  existing \ndistrict  roads  to  all-weather  condition  in  17  districts,  affecting \nabout  1.4  million  people.  The  capacity  of  DOR  and  local \nconstruction and consulting services industries will be enhanced.  \n \nThe  investment  cost of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  the  equivalent \nof  $80  million,  including  taxes,  duties,  and  interest  and  other \ncharges  during  construction  on  the  loan  cofinanced  by  the \nOrganization  of  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  (OPEC)  Fund  for \nInternational Development (OPEC Fund).  \n \nIt  is  proposed  that ADB  will  provide  a  grant  of  the  equivalent  of \n$55.2 million from the Asian Development Fund IX (ADF IX) grant \nprogram. The grant will finance the project cost except the cost for \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement,  taxes,  and  duties.  The  OPEC \nFund  will  provide  a  loan  of  $10  million  to  finance  the  civil  works \ncost  of  the  road  connectivity  component.  The  OPEC  Fund  loan \nwill  be  administered  by ADB.  The  Government  will  finance  $14.8 \nmillion for the project cost, inclusive of taxes and duties, and the \ncost of land acquisition and resettlement.  \n \nUntil 30 June 2013 \n \n31 December 2012 \n\n \nMinistry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW)  \n \nDOR  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency.  The  existing  project \nimplementation  unit,  which \nimplementing \nongoing ADB-financed  road  projects,  will  be  retained  under  DOR \nfor the Project.  \n \n\nis  responsible \n\nfor \n\nii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\n \n\n\fProcurement \n\n \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n\niii\n\nCivil  works  contracts  estimated  at  more  than  $2 million  will  be \nprocured  through  international  competitive  bidding.  Civil  works \ncontracts worth $2 million or less will be procured through national \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable \nto  ADB.  MPPW \nstandard  bidding  documents  for  procurement  of  civil  works \ndeveloped under ADB technical assistance (TA) will be used for all \nnational competitive bidding contracts.  \n\n \n\nBidders  will  be  post-qualified  by  applying  a  single-stage,  one-\nenvelope  bidding  procedure.  Equipment  will  be  procured  using \n(i) international  competitive  bidding  for  contracts  estimated  at \nmore than $1 million; (ii) limited international bidding for contracts \nestimated  at  $100,000\u2013$1,000,000;  and  (iii)  direct  contracting \narrangements for contracts valued at less than $100,000. \nA  consulting  firm  will  be  recruited  using ADB's  quality-  and  cost-\nbased  selection  procedure  in  accordance  with  Guidelines  on  the \nUse  of  Consultants  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  and  Its \nBorrowers.  About  60  person-months  of  international  consultants \nand 1,322 person-months of national consultants will be required \nfor  the  Project.  Consultants  will  carry  out  (i)  detailed  design  and \nconstruction  supervision  of  sample  roads;  and  (ii)  feasibility \nstudies,  preliminary,  and  detailed  design  and  construction \nsupervision  of  non-sample  roads.  This  will  be  done  in  line  with \ngovernment  and  ADB  policies  and  guidelines,  and  based  on \nto  sample  road \ndemonstrated  sample  methodology  applied \nfeasibility and preliminary design. Consultants will also assist DOR \nin  developing  a  baseline  for  systematic  project  performance \nmanagement systems monitoring and evaluation. Consultants will \n(i)  supervise  and  monitor  the  implementation  of  resettlement \nactivities,  environment  management  plans, \nthe  road  safety \nprogram,  and  the  HIV/AIDS  and  anti-trafficking  program;  and  (ii) \nprepare the overall project completion report.    \n\nLocal  nongovernment  organizations  will  be  recruited  for  about \n36 person-months  to  carry  out  the  HIV/AIDS  and  anti-trafficking \nprogram.  \n\nMPPW  will  recruit  2  person-months  of  international  individual \nconsultants  and  4  person-months  of  domestic \nindividual \nconsultants,  on  the  recommendation  of  the  National  Vigilance \nCentre,  to  carry  out  project  technical  auditing  in  line  with  ADB's \nprocedures and approved terms of reference.  \n \nThe  districts  covered  by  the  Project  have  a  high  poverty \nincidence,  from  37.4%  to  42.9%,  compared  with  the  national \naverage  of  30.8%.  Most  of  these  districts  are  considered  food \ninsecure  districts.  The  social  survey  indicates  that  better  road \nconnectivity  would  help  farmers  sell  agricultural  products  to \nneighboring  markets,  which  would  provide  more  agricultural \nemployment,  particularly  benefiting  the  poor.  The  Project  will \ncreate  employment  opportunities  for  skilled  and  unskilled  labor \nduring implementation. Unskilled labor will be employed directly in \nroad  construction  and  indirectly  in  providing  materials  and \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\niv \n\n \n\n \n\nservices  for  contractors.  The  Project  will  provide  reliable  and \nshortened road access to social services, particularly health care \nservices,  education  facilities,  and  drinking  water  supply.  The \nProject will improve access to hinterlands for business and private \nsector  investments,  especially  agro-industries  and  the  tourism \nindustry. The poverty impact ratio of the sample roads is estimated \nat 0.44, indicating that substantial benefits may accrue to the poor. \n\nADB\u2019s  portfolio  performance  in  Nepal  improved  in  2005,  as \nreflected in increased contract awards and disbursement, in spite \nof  very  challenging  circumstances  caused  by  escalation  of  the \nsecurity  conflict  since  2000.  The  Project  has  been  carefully \nformulated to manage and mitigate risks. Advance recruitment will \nhelp expedite consultant mobilization. The project implementation \nunit  will  be  appropriately  staffed.  Nongovernment  organizations \nwill be selected and engaged to help implement land acquisition, \nthe  resettlement  plan,  and  the  HIV/AIDS  and  anti-trafficking \nprogram.  The  consultants  will  help  procure  land  and  monitor \nproject \nimplementation.  ADB  will  rigorously  monitor  project \nimplementation  and  technical  auditing  throughout  the  project \nthe  Government, \nperiod \nMPPW,  and  other  funding  agencies.  Negative  environmental \nimpacts will be mitigated through the detailed mitigation measures \nset out in the summary  environmental impact assessment, which \nwill  be  monitored  by  the  consultants. The  Government  reassures \nthe  Project\u2019s  priority  I  status  starting  in  FY2007/08  in  terms  of \nbudget  allocation,  particularly  the  cost  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement. \n\ninteractions  with \n\nintensive \n\nthrough \n\nincluding  participants  believed \n\nThe  Project  has  been  prepared  in  full  consultation  with  all  local \ncommunities, which are expected to pass information to all parties \nin terms of the Project\u2019s potential benefits to local poor people. A \nsecurity  assessment  was  carried  out  during  project  preparation. \nLocal  communities, \nto  be \ninsurgents  or  related  to  insurgents,  expressed  support  for  the \nProject.  Lessons  learned  by  major  funding  agencies  active  in \nNepal,  including  ADB,  have  been  incorporated  in  the  project \ndesign. In the past, pro-poor projects had a much better chance of \nbeing  less  disturbed.  Security  risk  mitigation  measures  include \n(i) overprogramming \nencouraging \nemployment  of  local  contractors,  (iii)  incorporating  an  adequate \nconstruction  period  in  civil  works  contracts,  and  (iv)  providing \nflexible  work  program.  Maximum  use  of  local  unskilled  labor  will \nbe  encouraged  by  adopting  labor-intensive  construction  methods \nas much as practicable. All these measures are expected to help \nproject implementation.  \n\ncandidate \n\nroads, \n\n(ii) \n\nThe recent political development and newly declared cease-fire by \nthe  Government  and  insurgents  provide  reasonable  hope  for \ncautious  optimism  for  safe  and  effective  project  implementation. \nThe  Government  confirmed \nits \ncommitment  to  continue  project  implementation,  including  all \n\nthe  Project\u2019s  priority  and \n\n\f \nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n\n \n\nv\n\nagreed  assurances  in  the  report  and  recommendation  of  the \nPresident  and \nfinancing  agreement.  However,  a  cautious \napproach  will  be  adopted  and  a  security  assessment  will  be \ncarried out in the process of contract award and approval of non-\nsample  roads.  This  will  prioritize  sections  that  are  considered \ncapable  of  being  implemented  safely  and  effectively  and  help  in \nawarding contracts accordingly.  \n \nIn  conjunction  with  the  Project,  a TA  is  proposed  to  enhance  the \ncapacity  building  of  (i)  DOR  in  carrying  out  road  feasibility \nstudies\u2014particularly in terms of economic analysis and social and \nsafeguard  aspects;  and  (ii)  local  construction  and  consulting \ncontract \nservices \nmanagement.  The  estimated  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  $351,000,  of \nwhich ADB will finance $300,000 on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding  program.  The  TA  consultants  will  be  recruited \nin \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by the \nAsian Development Bank and Its Borrowers. \n\nconstruction  and \n\nindustries

Development Bank (ADB) of a loan to \nbe  provided  by  the  Organization  of  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  (OPEC)  Fund  for \nInternational  Development  (OPEC  Fund),  both  to  the  Kingdom  of  Nepal  for  the  Road \nConnectivity  Sector  I  Project.  The  report  also  describes  a  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA) \ngrant for capacity building in road feasibility study and construction and contract management, \nand if the ADB\u2019s Board of Directors approves the proposed grant, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.1 \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nNepal's gross domestic product (GDP) growth slipped to 2% in FY2005 after recovering \nmoderately  to  about  3%  in  FY2003  and  FY2004,  from  the  downturn  in  FY2002.  Nepal  is  a \nlandlocked country with a population of approximately 25.4 million people. It ranked 136 out of \n177 countries on the human development index in 2005, one of the lowest in the South Asian \nregion.  It  faces  difficult  challenges  in  reducing  poverty  and  achieving  the  Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals.  While  the  national  poverty  incidence  is  30.8%,  it  is  about  37.4\u201342.9%  in \nnorthern hilly areas.  \n\n3. \nThe transportation system in Nepal depends heavily on the road network which carries \nabout 90% of all passengers and freight within the country. Nepal\u2019s national road network has a \ntotal  of  16,834  kilometers  (km)  of  roads,  comprising  national  highways,  feeder  roads,  urban \nroads, district roads, and village roads. In 2002, the national highways and feeder roads, which \nform the country\u2019s strategic road network (SRN), reached about 4,861 km. There are 51 feeder \nroads  totaling  1,852  km  in  length  which  provide  major  connections  from  highways  to  district \nheadquarters. About two thirds of feeder roads remain unpaved and much remains impassable \nduring the wet season.  \n\nRoad  transport  is  the  dominant  transport  mode  in  Nepal  but  road  density  is  low  at \n4. \n11.40 km of road per 100 square kilometers (km2) and 0.71 km per 1,000 population\u2014less than \nthat in neighboring countries. It is even lower in the northern part of the country at 5.22 km per \n100  km2  and  0.61  km  per  1,000  persons.  In  Nepal,  15  out  of  75  district  headquarters  are  not \nconnected  by  road  and  almost  53%  of  district  headquarters  are  not  connected  by  all-weather \nroads;  the  majority  of  these  are  in  the  northern  hilly  area.  This  is  mainly  due  to  the  country\u2019s \ncomplex  topography  and  insufficient  resources,  which  result  in  lack  of  road  access  for  about \n4 million inhabitants and contribute to rural poverty throughout the country.  \n\n5. \nThe number of road accidents increased by 42% from 2002 to 2003, registering 5,430. \nThis rise was due to increased vehicle density together with lack of road safety measures, poor \ndiscipline,  and  enforcement  and  poor  roadworthiness  of  vehicles. Although  available  statistics \nshow that the road fatality rate has declined significantly in the last few years to 27 deaths per \n10,000 vehicles, it remains one of the highest in the region.  \n\n                                                 \n1  The Project has been prepared through ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Nepal for Preparing the \nTransport Connectivity Sector Project (Financed by the Japan Special Fund). Manila (TA 4347-NEP, approved on 4 \nJune). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  present  road  accident  system  is  clearly  inadequate  in  terms  of  data  records  to \n6. \nanalyze  the  causes  of  accidents,.  The  data  records  can  be  utilized  to  identify  accident \n\u201cblackspots\u201d, detect major causes, and develop countermeasures. The Traffic Engineering and \nSafety Unit (Road Unit) was established in 1994 in the Department of Roads (DOR). It produced \nguidelines  for  road  safety  including  a  traffic  sign  manual,  road  safety  notes,  and  a  highway \ncode;  and  conducted  training  for  traffic  police.  The  Project  will  strengthen  the  accident \ndatabase\u2019s software system and perform capacity training.  \n\nThe bus and freight transport industry is heavily regulated. The majority of operators of \n7. \nroad  passenger  and  freight  services  are  privately  owned.  Over  90%  of  passenger  and  freight \ntraffic is carried by buses and trucks. Route permits  must be issued for the majority of sealed \nroads. Route fares are set by considering terrain and road pavement type and condition.  \n\nDuring  Nepal\u2019s  10th  plan,  five-year  period,  (Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper,  2002\u2013\n8. \n2007)2,  the  Government\u2019s  total  planned  investment  in  the  road  sector  is  $485  million\u2014a \nsignificant  increase  over  the  amount  allocated  in  the  previous  plan  period.  The  investment \nbudget is about $73.1 million for FY2006, about 9.8% higher than that of FY2005.  \n\n9. \nThe National Planning Commission sets overall development objectives and coordinates \nthe  investment  programs  of  external  agencies  and  government  agencies.  The  Ministry  of \nPhysical Planning and Works (MPPW) has prime responsibility for (i) planning and formulating \nroad policies; and (ii) managing all land transport facilities, including roads and bridges. Within \nMPPW, DOR is responsible for network planning, design, construction, and maintenance of the \nSRN; municipalities are responsible for urban roads. The Ministry of Local Development (MLD) \nis  responsible  for  district  and  village  roads.  MLD\u2019s  Department  of  Local  Infrastructure \nDevelopment and Agricultural Roads (DOLIDAR) is responsible for coordinating and facilitating \nrural  infrastructure  development  throughout  the  country.  DOR\u2019s  Project  Directorate  (ADB), \nadministers  ADB-financed  road  projects.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  provides  funds  for \nmaintenance of the SRN through Roads Board Nepal (RBN) and DOR. Since its establishment \non 30 December 2002, RBN approves DOR\u2019s annual road maintenance plan and controls the \npart of DOR\u2019s budget funded by RBN. DOR remains the planning and implementation agency \nfor  maintenance  funded  by  other  sources\u2014such  as  direct  allocation  by  MOF  and  projects \nfunded by ADB and the World Bank. \n\n10. \nRBN\u2019s funding sources are mainly fuel levies (48.7%), vehicle registration fees (33.5%), \nand  tolls  (17.8%).  These  funds  are  used  to  maintain  all  roads.  For  FY2005/06,  the  total  fund \nresources were NRs400 million ($5.6 million) which were allocated to SRN roads, urban roads, \nand district roads. The Government provides an additional NRs290 million ($4.1 million) to DOR \nfor  SRN  maintenance. The  Government  plans  to  provide  adequate  funding  each  year  to  RBN \nand  eventually  budget  all  road  maintenance  funds  through  RBN.  The  Government\u2019s  budget \nsupport for road maintenance will continue until RBN revenue collection can fully meet the road \nmaintenance fund requirement. \n\n                                                 \n2 National Planning Commission, Government of Nepal. 2003.

Its  objectives  include  strengthening  political  and \nadministrative  linkages,  poverty  reduction,  and  minimizing  the  total  transportation  cost  and \nadverse  environmental  impact.  Major  strategies  adopted  in  the  10th  FYP  in  the  road  sector \ninclude  (i) increasing  private  sector  participation  in  road  construction  and  maintenance,  and \n(ii) enhancing the institutional capacities of DOR and the private sector to ensure cost-effective \nsustainability of the road network. \n\n12. \nThe  20-year  Road  Master  Plan  for  SRN  (RMP)  (2002\u20132022)  sets  out  strategies  to \nextend  the  SRN  by  4,040  km  to  improve  north\u2013south  connectivity  to  district  headquarters  and \ncenters of trade, industry, and tourism. Connection of 12 out of 15 district headquarters, which \nare  not  yet  connected  by  road  to  national  highways,  is  proposed  during  the  10th FYP; \nconnection  of  the  remaining  three  is  planned  during  the  11th  FYP.  The  Government\u2019s  10-year \nroad sector Midterm Program (MTP) (2006\u20132015) is the basis for selecting candidate roads for \nthe Project and other external financing agencies. The MTP plans to provide new connections to \nthree district headquarters and improve roads to all-weather condition in 17 districts. During the \nsame  period,  the  SRN  is  to  be  extended  by  200  km  per  year,  and  will  be  maintained  to  the \nrequired  condition.  The  annual  estimated  expenditure  for  extension  and  maintenance  of  the \nSRN  is  about  NRs5,700  million  ($81  million).  The  RMP  required  substantial  funding  agency \nsupport  for  the  budget  in  the  initial RMP  period  for  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction.  However, \nsuch support is expected to decline significantly near the end of the planning period.  \n\n13. \nUntil  1990,  Nepal's  transportation  focus  was  to  develop  basic  transport  infrastructure, \nconstructing  8,328  km  of  roads  by  1991.  By  the  early  1990s,  neglect  of  road  maintenance \nbegan to show and 52% of major roads were in poor condition in 1992. Growing understanding \nof the consequence of poor maintenance and the Government\u2019s focus on maintenance has led \nto  massive  rehabilitation  and  resealing  of  road  networks,  mostly  through  externally  assisted \nprojects.  The  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  strengthen  road  maintenance  include  (i)  preparing  road \nplans,  (ii) establishing  RBN,  and  (iii)  increasing  budget  allocation  for  road  maintenance.  The \nRMP  includes  a  long-term  plan  for  road  maintenance.  It  is  estimated  that  about  NRs1 billion \n($14  million)  will  be  required  each  year  for  SRN  road  maintenance.  In  contrast  to  road \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction,  where  the  Government  is  largely  dependent  on  external \nassistance,  it  currently  provides  budgetary  funding  for  routine,  recurrent,  and  most  periodic \nmaintenance.  The  Government  will  provide  full  funding  for  periodic  maintenance  of  at  least \n500 km each year from 2006 to 2012. This will ensure proper maintenance of all maintainable \nSRN roads and clear up 800 km of deferred maintenance.    \n\nb. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening \n\n14. \nTwo  significant  developments  have  occurred  through  the  Government\u2019s  post-2000 \ninitiatives  on  institutional  strengthening  in  public  infrastructure  construction  and  management: \n(i) the preparation of the public works directives (PWD) and, (ii) the establishment of RBN. The \nobjective  of  the  PWD  is  to  provide  a  set  of  understandable,  effective,  efficient,  and  practical \ndirectives\u2014a  single  source  of  procedures  and  reference  documents  for  implementing  public \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fconstruction  works  (such  as  roads,  irrigation,  and  civil  aviation).  The  PWD  has  been  in  force \nsince 2002 and is the first manual of uniform procedures for public construction works and use \nof  consulting  services  in  Nepal.  The  PWD  combine  Nepal\u2019s  financial  administration  rules  and \nother rules and regulations on technical, social, and environmental matters. \n\n15. \nThe Roads Board Act, 2002, establishes RBN as an autonomous body to (i) manage the \ncollection and expenditure of revenue for repair and maintenance of all road networks (routine, \nrecurrent,  periodic,  rehabilitation,  and  emergency  maintenance);  and  (ii) charge  vehicles  using \nthe  roads.  RBN  formulates  an  integrated  annual  maintenance  plan  each  year  and  allocates \nbudget for road maintenance works. \n\n16.  \nThe  importance  of  capacity  building  in  the  road  sector  has  been  widely  recognized. \nInternational  funding  agencies  supported  capacity  building  in  DOR,  DOLIDAR,  and  RBN \nthrough  several  interventions.  DOR  prepared  training  management  guidelines  based  on  an \nanalysis  of  capacity  building  needs.  ADB  provided  capacity-building  assistance  to  (i)  DOR  in \npreparing  the  PWD;  and  (ii)  RBN  in  strengthening  the  road  tariff  methodology.  The  National \nVigilance  Centre  (NVC)  is  one  of  the  country\u2019s  active  anticorruption  agencies,  specializing  in \nauditing project performance in terms of procurement, contract management, and construction \nquality.  ADB  has  supported  capacity  building  of  NVC\u2019s  technical  audit  to  ensure  transparency \nand  good  governance  in  infrastructure  construction.  The  Swiss  Agency  for  Development  and \nCooperation has focused on capacity building in maintenance activities at the operational level \nof  DOR  division  staff  by  introducing  a  planned maintenance  approach since  1993 through  the \nStrengthening  Maintenance  Divisions  Program.  This  program  trained  staff  in  all  25  DOR \ndivisions under \u201cYearly Plans of Operation\u201d. The United Kingdom\u2019s Department for International \nDevelopment has recently focused on institutional capacity in rural infrastructure development to \nsupport DOLIDAR and district development communities and village development committees, \nwhich plan and manage transport infrastructure in rural areas.  \n\nAs  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  national  transport  policy  (2002),  an  extensive  capacity-\n17. \nbuilding and institutional-strengthening action plan is being carried out, including (i) preparation \nof a long-term institutional strategy for the SRN; (ii) comprehensive DOR corporate planning and \nperformance  management;  (iii)  DOR  planning  and  management,  using  efficient  information \ntechnology  and  management  information  systems;  (iv)  effective  monitoring  and  evaluation \ncapacity; and (v) improved project financial management.  \n\n18. \nDOR has developed basic capabilities to manage road assets and resources allocated to \nthe sector. However, further capacity building is necessary in the economic, environmental, and \nsocial aspects of road feasibility studies. These are important areas which could impede DOR\u2019s \nproject  preparation  efforts.  DOR\u2019s  capacity  also  needs  to  be  enhanced  by  adopting  a  quality \nassurance system (QAS) in construction management. In view of its present capacity and future \ncapacity  building  programs,  it  is  assessed  that  DOR  will  have  the  capacity  to  carry  out  the \nProject. \n\nc. \n\nPrivate Sector Development and Capacity Building \n\n19.  Major road sector strategies adopted in the 10th FYP include (i) increasing private sector \nparticipation in road construction and maintenance, and (ii) enhancing the institutional capacities \nof the private sector to ensure cost-effective sustainability of the road network. The construction \nindustry is important for the economy and employment in Nepal. It is estimated that it employs \nmore  than  140,000  personnel,  ranging  from  unskilled  workers  to  engineers,  and  has  a  total \nannual  turnover  of  NRs18  billion  ($257  million).  About  14,000  contractors  are  currently \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5 \n \n\nregistered  in  Nepal.  They  are  categorized  into  four  classes  according  to  equipment  owned, \nexperience, and financial status. This classification determines the qualification to participate in \nthe bidding process.  \n\nLocal  contractors  in  Nepal  have  improved  their  capability  in  the  last  decade  by \n20. \npurchasing more equipment. Although the Government\u2019s Financial Administration Rules do not \napply to externally funded projects, they state that national competitive bidding should be used \nfor  contracts  up  to  NRs250  million  ($3.5  million).  Experience  from  completed  contracts \ndemonstrates that a large number of local contractors can handle contracts up to that threshold. \n\n21. \nConsulting  firms  are  key  players  in  road  construction  and  maintenance\u2014in  terms  of \nplanning,  design,  and  supervision  of  road  works.  About  a  total  of  240  consulting  firms  are \nregistered with the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies; around 45 firms are actively \nengaged in projects funded by the Government and international funding agencies, although the \nsizes of the local firms are relatively small.  \n\nThe  Federation  of  Contractors\u2019  Association  Nepal  and  the  Society  of  Consulting \n22. \nArchitectural and Engineering Firms were established to advocate activities for the development \nof the construction and consulting services industry. Their main objectives include the following: \n(i)  develop  professional  capabilities,  (ii)  eliminate  unhealthy  and  unfair  competition,  (iii) advise \nmembers on technical and legal matters, (iv) suggest government formulation and amendment \nof all policies related to the construction industry, and (v) provide technical training opportunities \nto members.  \n\nAlthough  local  contractors  and  the  consulting  services  industry  have  improved  their \n23. \ntechnical  capacity  over  the  years\u2014mostly  through  externally  funded  projects\u2014the  need  for \ntraining  has  been  identified  in  the  International  Federation  of  Consulting  Engineers  (FIDIC) \ncontract management and QAS (Appendix 2 and Supplementary Appendix A). \n\n \n\n2. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n24. \nDevelopment of Nepal\u2019s road network is heavily reliant on external funding. Since 1976, \nADB has provided the Government with seven transport projects totaling $219.4 million and TAs \ntotaling over $3.5 million to construct or upgrade about 1,800 km of highways and feeder roads. \nThese  projects  included  (i)  a  large  portion  of  road  upgrading  and  periodic  maintenance  of  the \nEast\u2013West  Highway;  and  (ii)  improvement  of  hilly  roads,  accounting  for  about  25%  of  Nepal\u2019s \nroad development expenditure. Major bilateral funding agencies in Nepal\u2019s road sector include \nGermany,  India,  Japan,  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  Switzerland,  United  Kingdom,  and  United \nStates.  Multilateral  funding  agencies  include  the  World  Bank  and  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme (Appendix 3). \n\n \n\n3. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n25. \nThe  road  sector  presents  progressing  experience  in  terms  of  project  implementation \nperformance.  Over  the  years,  MPPW  has  demonstrated  improved  capacity  to  implement \nprojects.  However,  it  needs  to  strengthen  capacity  building  in  road  feasibility  studies  and \ncontract management.  \n\nEfforts are being made by ADB and the Government to optimize project implementation \n26. \nin  conflict  situations.  Experience  shows  that  problems  caused  by  conflict  situations  for  most \nprojects  tend  to  be  time-  and  site-specific  but  most  were  able  to  continue  without  major \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nconstraints. Although many projects experienced implementation difficulties (such as strikes) to \nsome extent, contract awards and disbursements in 2005 showed improvement over year 2004. \n\n27. \nA  conservative  implementation  schedule  is  provided  with  adequate  contingency. Active \nconsultations and public participations were carried out during project preparation\u2014particularly \nwith respect to land acquisition and prevention of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking\u2014to increase \npublic awareness and address community road-related needs. This will facilitate public support \nfor  the  Project  and  reduce  disruptions  during  implementation.  The  sector  modality  provides \nflexibility in selecting subprojects in accordance  with local conflict levels. Experience in similar \nprojects has shown that maximum use of national competitive bidding provided the possibility of \nbetter  coordination  with  local  parties  and  less  interference  from  insurgents,  especially  when \nlocal unskilled labor from local villages carried out some of the work. Successful implementation \nof  completed  works  suggests  that  local  contractors  are  capable  of  handling  most  types  of \nroadworks  under  the  Project.  The  project  design  considered  lessons  learned  from  previous \nprojects. \n\n \n\n4. \n\nAsian Development Bank Sector Strategy \n\nNepal\u2019s country strategy and program (2005\u20132009)3 sets out the strategy for promoting \n28. \nbroad-based  and  inclusive  social  and  economic  development  to  achieve  a  steady  decline  in \npoverty.  A  key  element  is  the  development  of  the  road  network,  which  will  assist  the \nGovernment in (i) promoting balanced regional development; (ii) improving the poor\u2019s access to \nbasic  services,  opportunities  for  economic  advancement,  and  participation  in  the  development \nprocess;  and  (iii)  addressing  the  needs  of  disadvantaged,  women,  ethnic  groups,  and  lower \ncastes. \n\n29. \nIn the transport sector, the key to mainstreaming excluded regions and social groups in \nthe  economy  is  to  foster  connectivity  between  all  parts  of  the  country  and  facilitate  trade \nbetween  Nepal  and  its  neighbors.  ADB  supports  the  Government  in  (i)  improving  rural \naccessibility, (ii) reducing isolation within the country, and (iii) promoting subregional connectivity \nwith  neighboring  countries.  The  Government  is  committed  to  improving  overall  sector \nperformance and recognizes the need for a combination of network improvements, institutional \nreform,  and  improved  asset  management.  This  approach  is  supported  by  other  external \nagencies.  \n\n30. \nA  programmatic  approach  has  been  adopted  in  identifying,  screening,  and  prioritizing \ncandidate roads (Appendix 4 and Supplementary Appendix B). Selection of candidate roads for \nthe project financing may be further reviewed during the project implementation period. The 10th \n5-year  MTP  is  based  on  the  Government\u2019s  20-year  RMP  by  adopting  multi-criteria  analysis  in \nconsidering  district  headquarters\u2019  connectivity,  economic  worth  and  potential,  population  and \nroad  density,  extent  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  poverty,  environment,  construction \ncost,  and  security  concerns.  The  MTP  consists  of  (i)  a  10-year  road  investment  priority  plan \n(2006\u20132015) in the feeder road network to improve connectivity between rural roads and major \ntowns and district headquarters; (ii) recommendations to strengthen the Government\u2019s capacity \nto  manage  and  operate  the  road  network  safely  and  efficiently;  and  (iii)  capacity  training  to \nstrengthen  the  capabilities  of  DOR,  local  contractors,  and  consulting  services  to  improve  and \nmaintain road construction and management.  \n\n                                                 \n3 ADB.  2004. NEPAL Country Strategy and Program 2005-2009. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n \n\nADB  requirements  for  the  sector  project  are  the  (i)  existence  of  a  sector  development \n31. \nplan, (ii) institutional capability to implement the sector development plan, and (iii) development \nof  policies  to  enable  the  sector  to  improve  its  performance.  It  is  assessed  that  these \nrequirements are satisfactorily met in view of (i) the MTP, (ii) DOR\u2019s current institutional capacity \nand planned strengthening, and (iii) adopted and new policy initiatives in the road sector. \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome  \n\n32. \nThe  Project  will  (i)  support  sustained  and  broad-based  economic  growth  and  inclusive \nsocial development; and (ii) help reduce the poverty of isolated people, mostly in hilly areas. An \nexpanded and rehabilitated feeder road system in remote areas will improve access to markets, \nemployment opportunities, and health and education service centers in major towns and district \nheadquarters. The capacity of DOR and local construction and consulting services industries will \nbe enhanced.  \n\nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n33. \nA total of 25 roads and bridge measuring about 1,383 km  are included in the MTP; 10 \nroads and 1 bridge totaling about 490 km are planned for investment under the Project and the \nremainder  is  envisaged  for  other  projects.  The  Project  will  finance  the  construction  and \nupgrading  of  feeder  roads  covering  17  out  of  75  districts\u2014located  mostly  in  western, \nmidwestern,  central,  and  eastern  regions\u2014affecting  about  1.4  million  people.  Three  district \nheadquarters at Chame, Diktel, and Salleri will be connected by road to national highways for \nthe  first  time.  Existing  roads  will  be  improved  to  all-weather  condition  at  Bhaktapur,  Dhading, \nDolakha, Kapilbastu, Kathmandu, Khotang, Lamjung, Manang, Myagdi, Nuwakot, Okhaldhunga, \nPanchthar, Ramechhap, Rasuwa, Sindhuli, Solukhumbu, and Taplejung.  The districts covered \nby the Project are mostly poor districts. Consulting services will be provided to assist in project \nimplementation and capacity building of DOR, local contractors, and consulting firms.  \n\n \n\n1. \n\nRoad Connectivity Component \n\n34. \nAbout  10  feeder  roads  will  be  constructed  or  upgraded.  Three  sample  roads  (Galchi\u2013\nTrisuli\u2013Dhunche-Syaphrubesi,  Phidim\u2013Taplejung,  and  Tamakoshi\u2013Manthali\u2013Khurkot)  totaling \nabout  227 km  have  been  selected  for  preliminary  engineering,  economic,  social,  resettlement, \nand environmental studies; and will serve as sample for feasibility studies of non-sample roads \n(Supplementary Appendix C). \n\n35.  MPPW  will  prepare  seven  non-sample  roads  measuring  about  263  km  through  project \nimplementation consultants. The non-sample roads will be selected in accordance with selection \ncriteria  adopted  for  sample  roads  and  in  sequence  of  priority  in  the  list. All  subprojects  must \nhave an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of more than 12%, and meet government and \nADB policy social/resettlement and environmental requirements.  \n\n2.  \n\nHIV/AIDS Prevention and Anti-Trafficking Program \n\n36. \nThe  Project  recognizes  the  importance  of  preventing  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking. \nThe Project provides an opportunity to link the transport sector with already existing HIV/AIDS \nand  anti-trafficking  programs  in  support  of  government  strategies,  and  increase  access  to \nHIV/AIDS  services  and  care.  The  anti-trafficking  program  will  help  mitigate  the  spread  of \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fHIV/AIDS,  so  it  is  included  in  the  HIV/AIDS  and  anti-trafficking  program  to  be  financed  by  the \ngrant. The Project will (i) carry out designed activities to reduce the vulnerability of groups at risk \nof  HIV/AIDS  and  trafficking,  and  (ii)  increase  access  to  HIV  prevention  services.  Beneficiaries \nwill  include  road  construction  workers,  transport  drivers,  female  sex  workers,  migrants,  and \npopulations living along the road corridors. DOR officials and local government employees will \nbe  trained.  This  component  has  been  formulated  on  division  of  labor  with  other  funding \nagencies and existing government programs to avoid duplication, and will be financed from the \nAsian Development Fund IX (ADF IX) grant. Background, terms of reference (TORs), and cost \nestimates are in Appendix 5 and Supplementary Appendix D. The HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 6.   \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n37. \nThis is the first ADB sector road project in Nepal and a programmatic approach is used \nto  prepare  a  10-year  road  sector  midterm  program.  This  makes  it  possible  to  select  road \nconnectivity subprojects under a well-prepared and balanced context with a clear picture of the \ninstitutional  capacity,  road  investment  plan,  funding  constraints,  subproject  priority,  and \nmaintenance capability in the country\u2019s road sector.  \n\n38. \nThe  Project  proposes  a  modest  scale  of  pavement  rehabilitation  and  resurfacing  and \nother  supporting  works,  which  present  a  much  more  acceptable  design  in  terms  of  economic \nefficiency and resettlement and environmental impact. \n\n39. \nADB has assisted Nepal in improving road safety by strengthening policy requirements, \ntraining,  and  equipment  applications.  The  road  safety  program  under  the  Project  will  assist  in \nroad  safety  improvement.  Safety  auditing  will  be  carried  out  (i)  during  and  immediately  after \ncompletion of the detailed design, and (ii) before tendering. Improvements will be carried out on \nproject roads, including road signs, and training counterpart staff. The road accident database \nwill  be  strengthened  through  updated  software,  and  staff  will  be  trained  in  its  application  and \nmaintenance.  Other  road  safety  activities  will  be  designed  and  implemented,  including \ncommunity-oriented road safety awareness programs. The new aligned sections will meet road \nsafety  standards  on  road  geometry,  intersections,  and  side  drains.  On  the  exiting  alignment, \naccident-prone  places  or  black  spots  will  be  identified  and  improved.  The  Heavy  Vehicle \nManagement  Policy  to  be  adopted  by  the  Government  will  help  alleviate  the  overloading \nsituation, which damages road safety and the road pavement.  \n\nExtensive consultations were held during project preparation with government agencies \n40. \nand local population on social services, minority development, environmental protection, water \nand  forest  resources  management,  and  resettlement.  Close  consultation  with  external  funding \nagencies active in Nepal helped formulate the HIV/AIDS prevention and anti-trafficking program \nwith a clear division of labor and complementary scheme.  \n\nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nThe project investment cost is estimated at the equivalent of $80 million, including taxes, \n41. \nduties, and interest and other charges on the loan during construction (Table 1 and Appendix 7). \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\n \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nBase Costa \n1.

The  grant  will  finance  the  project  cost  except  the  cost  of  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement,  taxes,  and  duties.  ADB  may  finance  eligible  expenditures  in \naccordance with different ratios specified for each cost category. The OPEC Fund will provide a \nloan  of  $10  million  to  finance  the  civil  works  costs  of  the  road  connectivity  component.  The \nOPEC Fund will have a 20-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 1% \nper annum, and service charge of 1%. This loan will be administered by ADB. The Government \nwill  finance  $14.8  million  of  the  project  cost,  including  the  cost  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement, taxes, and duties.   \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nOPEC Fund \nGovernmenta  \nTotal \n \n\nTotal \n55.2 \n10.0 \n14.8 \n80.0 \n\n% \n69.8 \n12.7 \n17.5 \n100 \n\n     OPEC = Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. \n       a  Including taxes and duties. \n\n            Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nF. \n\nADF IX Grant Financing \n\nUnder the ADF IX Resolution,4 Nepal\u2014with per capita gross national income of $230\u2014\n43. \nwas  classified  as  one  of  the  poorest  and  most  debt-stressed  countries,  and  eligible  for  ADF \ngrant financing for up to 50% of the total assistance program under category B of the ADF IX \nGrants Allocation Framework5 (the Framework). The grant will finance road connectivity and the \nHIV/AIDS  prevention  and  anti-trafficking  program.  Against  the  backdrop  of  deteriorating \ndevelopment,  the  principal  objective  of  the  grant  is  to  reduce  the  isolation  of  remote  rural \ncommunities,  mostly  in  the  hilly  region,  by  enhancing  (i)  the  poor\u2019s  access  to  basic  services, \n(ii) employment opportunities, and (iii) health and education service centers in major towns and \ndistrict  headquarters.  The  project  roads  cover  wide  areas  of  poor  population.  Nepal  is  also \neligible for grant financing for HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases under category C of the \nFramework.6  Proposed  activities  along  the  project  areas  are  fully  supported  by  relevant \ndevelopment  partners,  including  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  and \nthe United Nations Development Programme. ADB and the Government recognize HIV/AIDS as \na crosscutting development theme which is linked to and exacerbated by the human trafficking \nissue. The anti-trafficking program will help mitigate the spread of HIV/AIDS, so it is included in \nthe HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking program to be financed by the grant. Grant effectiveness will \nbe  assessed  within  the  broader  context  of  project  performance.  The  Project\u2019s  design  and \nmonitoring frameworks for the Project and the HIV/AIDS prevention and anti-trafficking program \nhave clear indicators to measure the inputs, activities, and outputs. \n\nG. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nimplementation  and  management, \n\n44.  MPPW  will  be  the  Executing Agency  and  DOR  will  be  the  Implementing Agency.  Both \nhave extensive experience in implementing ADB-financed road projects. The Project Directorate \n(ADB),  established  in  1987,  will  be  maintained  within  DOR  and  serve  as  the  project \nimplementation  unit  (PIU).  The  PIU  director  (the  director)  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  all \naspects  of  project \nincluding  procurement,  progress \nmonitoring,  financial  management,  reporting,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  HIV/AIDS \nand  anti  trafficking  prevention  programs.  The  director  will  act  as  project  coordinator  for \ngovernment  agencies  concerned.  DOR  will  maintain  the  full-time  director  for  at  least  the  first \n2 years of project implementation and promptly inform ADB of any change of director. DOR will \nensure  that  the  person  appointed  will  (i)  be  a  senior  officer  with  adequate  technical  and \nadministration  experience  and  qualifications;  and  (ii)  be  assisted  by  appropriate  and  adequate \ntechnical, financial, and administrative staff. One project office in Kathmandu and at least three \nfield project offices will be set up to be responsible for day-to-day implementation and report to \nthe director (Supplementary Appendix E). \n\n45. \nThe  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  anti-trafficking  component  will  be  implemented  by  local \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  under  the  overall  responsibility  of  the  PIU.  DOR  will \nensure that adequate counterpart facilities and staff assist in the implementation, and essential \nDOR officials will be trained to ensure the sustainability of DOR\u2019s capacity after the Project.  \n\n \n                                                 \n4  Eighth  Replenishment  of  the  Asian  Development  Fund  and  Third  Regularized  Replenishment  of  the  Technical \n\nAssistance Special Fund (ADF IX Resolution). \n\n5 ADB. 2004.

Civil  works  will \ncommence around January 2009. This schedule is dependent on, among others, (i) consultants \nbeing engaged by the end of September 2007; and (ii) land being made available, free from any \nencumbrances, within about 18 months after the Project starts and before construction begins. \n(Appendix 8). \n\n3. \n\nProcurement  \n\n47. \nProcurement  to  be  financed  from  the ADB  grant  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2006).  The  Government  will  prepare  and  update  annually  a \nprocurement  plan  in  the  course  of  finalizing  and  implementing  the  subprojects.  Civil  works \ncontracts  estimated  at  more  than  $2 million  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive \nbidding;  those  estimated  at  $2 million  or  less  will  be  procured  through  national  competitive \nbidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  MPPW  standard  bidding  documents  for  civil  works \nprocurement,  developed  under  an  ADB  TA,  will  be  used  for  all  national  competitive  bidding \ncontracts.  \n\nPackaging  of  sample  roads  reflects  the  consideration  of  engineering  complexity,  local \n48. \ncontractor  capacity,  and  the  local  security  situation.  Contract  packaging  for  non-sample  roads \nwill  be  decided  during  implementation  in  line  with  the  same  approach  (Appendix  9).  Indicative \nProcurement Plan is in Supplementary Appendix M.    \n\n49. \nBidders  will  be  post-qualified  by  applying  a  single-stage,  one-envelope  bidding \nprocedure. Equipment will be procured through (i) international competitive bidding for contracts \nwith  an  estimated  value  of  more  than  $1  million,  (ii)  limited  international  bidding  for  contracts \nestimated  at  $100,000\u2013$1,000,000,  and  (iii)  direct  contracting  arrangements  for  contracts \nvalued at less than $100,000.  \n\n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n50. \nA  consulting  firm  will  be  recruited  using  ADB's  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nprocedure  under  full  technical  proposals,  in  accordance  with  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  and  Its  Borrowers.  About  60  person-months  of \ninternational  consultants  and  1,322  person-months  of  national  consultants  will  carry  out  (i) \ndetailed  design  and  construction  supervision  of  sample  roads;  and  (ii)  feasibility  studies, \npreliminary and detailed design and construction supervision of non-sample roads. This will be \ndone  in  line  with  government  and  ADB  polices  and  guidelines,  and  based  on  demonstrated \nsample methodology applied to sample road feasibility and preliminary design. Consultants will \nalso  assist  DOR  in  developing  a  baseline  for  systematic  project  performance  management \nsystem  (PPMS).  Consultants  will  (i)  supervise  and  monitor  the  implementation  of  resettlement \nactivities, environment management plans, and the HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking program; and \n(ii)  prepare  the  overall  project  completion  report.  Local  NGOs  will  be  recruited  for  about  36 \nperson-months to carry out the HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking program under the supervision of a \ndomestic  social  development  specialist.  MPPW  will  recruit  two  person-months  of  international \nindividual  consultants  and  four  person-months  of  domestic  individual  consultants,  on  the \nrecommendation  of  NVC,  to  carry  out  project  technical  auditing  in  line  with  approved  TORs \n(Appendix  10).  Outline  TORs  for  design  and  construction  supervision  consultants  are  in \nAppendix  11  and  Supplementary  Appendix  F.  All  individual  consultants  will  be  selected  and \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nengaged in line with ADB's procedures for recruiting individual consultants.  \n\n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) was explained to and discussed with the Government \n51. \nand  MPPW.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included in  the  grant regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  MPPW,  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n\n52. \nTechnical auditing will be conducted at key project implementation milestones in terms of \nprocurement,  contract  management  and  payment,  and  construction  quality  to  promote \ntransparency  and  good  governance  in  infrastructure  construction.  Before  the  project  midterm \nreview  (MTR),  DOR  will  carry  out  project  technical  auditing  of  project  procurement,  contract \nadministration,  and  quality  inspection,  in  cooperation  with  NVC.  DOR  will  be  assisted  by \nindividual  international  and  national  consultants  with  expertise  and  experience  in  engineering \nand contract management, who will be appointed by MPPW from among NVC\u2019s nominees. The \nconsultants\u2019  final  report  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  and  NVC  through  MPPW  and  published  in \nMPPW\u2019s  bulletin  board  and  publications.  NVC  will  provide  counterpart  staff  to  help  the \nconsultants  carry  out  the  technical  auditing.  Suspected  irregularities  will  necessitate  further \ngovernment action for full investigation and application of disciplinary procedure, once proven.  \n\n53.  \nTo  promote  good  governance,  the  Government  will  publicize  project  implementation \ninformation  on  DOR\u2019s  website  on  a  pilot  basis.  The  information  will  cover  at  least  the \nprocurement process, progress related to resettlement, social and environmental activities, and \nthe findings of the technical auditing. \n\n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n54. \nAn  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook7  as  amended  from  time  to  time,  and \ndetailed arrangements between the Government and ADB. The initial amount to be deposited in \nthe  imprest  account  will  be  based  on  the  estimated  expenditures  for  6  months  or  10%  of  the \ngrant amount, whichever is lower. The account will be established with Nepal Rastra Bank. To \nexpedite disbursement during implementation, statement of expenditures procedure will be used \nto reimburse or liquidate the imprest account advance for any individual payment not exceeding \n$100,000. \n\n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nA  financial  management  assessment  of  DOR  has  been  carried  out.  DOR  will  maintain \n55. \nseparate  project  records  and  accounts  to  identify  goods  and  services  financed  from  grant \nproceeds, financing resources received, project expenditures, and use of local funds. A separate \naccount  will  be  maintained  for  the  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  anti-trafficking  program  to  be \n\n                                                 \n7 ADB. January 2001. Loan Disbursement Handbook. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n \n\nfinanced  from ADF  IX. Accounts  for  all  project  expenditures  will  be  set  up  in  accordance  with \nconsistent  and  sound  accounting  principles  and  in  line  with  the  applicable  laws  in  Nepal.  An \nindependent auditor satisfactory to ADB will audit the consolidated project accounts and related \nfinancial  statements  annually.  Due  to  the  diversity  of  project  sites\u2014and  procedures  involving \nMPPW,  MOF,  and  the  auditor  general\u2019s  office\u2014unaudited  and  audited  project  accounts  and \nfinancial statements will be submitted to ADB within 6 and 9 months, respectively, after the end \nof the fiscal year. The audit requirements should include an audit with a separate opinion on the \nuse  of  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditure  procedures,  and  account  for  the \nHIV/AIDS prevention and anti-trafficking program. \n\nto  DOR,  MPPW,  and  ADB:  (i) \n\nDOR  will  ensure  that  consultants  include  the  status  of  the  following  in  the  monthly \n56. \nprogress  reports \nland  acquisition,  (ii)  resettlement, \n(iii) environmental management, (iv) training, (v) prevention of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking, \nand (vi) other activities critical to project implementation but not directly included in the scope of \nengineering  services.  Within  3  months  of  physical  completion,  DOR  will  submit  a  project \ncompletion  report  in  a  format  acceptable  to ADB.  DOR  will  monitor  project  implementation  in \naccordance  with  the  implementation  schedule,  and  keep  ADB  informed  of  any  significant \ndeviation that could result in deviation from the schedule. \n\n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n57. \nThe  expected  socioeconomic  impact  will  cover  (i)  income  per  capita  per  district, \n(ii) annual  production  of  main  cash  crops,  (iii)  villages  with  telephone  connections,  (iv)  road \naccess and bus service, (v) primary school dropout rate, (vi) middle school attendance rate and \nunattended  home  births,  and  (vii)  progress  in  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  anti-trafficking.  Road \nroughness,  traffic  counts,  vehicle  ownership,  trip  times  and  cost,  and  bus  frequency  and  cost \nand  accident  data  are  an  essential  part  of  the  overall  performance  monitoring  process  and \nscheduled in  the  PPMS.  Where  relevant,  indicators  will  be  disaggregated  by  gender.  Baseline \nindicators will be collected before constructions start. DOR will monitor these indicators annually \nduring  project  implementation  and  3  months  after  project  completion.  Performance  indicators \nwill be used to assess if development objectives have been attained. \n\n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n58. \nIn addition to regular reviews by ADB staff, the Government and ADB will perform a joint \nMTR to assess the Project\u2019s progress and agree upon any changes to scope or implementation \narrangements. The MTR will be conducted by  the end of third year of  implementation. MPPW \nwill submit to ADB a detailed status report on project implementation 2 months before the MTR.  \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n59. \nA  TA  of  $300,000  for  capacity  building  in  road  feasibility  study  and  construction  and \ncontract  management  (Supplementary  Appendix  G)  will  be  provided  to  (i)  strengthen  DOR\u2019s \ncapacity in road feasibility studies, particularly in social, resettlement, and environmental impact \nanalysis  and  management;  and  (ii)  enhance  the  capacity  of  local  construction  and  consulting \nindustries  in  applying  FIDIC  contract  management  and  QAS  in  road  construction.  The  TA  will \ntrain DOR officials by using one of the non-sample roads  as a pilot case, and develop a road \nfeasibility studies tool kit in line with ADB\u2019s guidelines, with modifications for Nepal. The tool kit \nwill supplement the PWD and help the Government prepare a road development  master plan. \nThe strengthened capacity of local contractors and consulting services will contribute to private \nsector development in the road sector.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nThe TA will be financed on a grant basis by the TA funding program and carried out by \n60. \nindividual  consultants:  (i)  about  3  person-months  each  of  international  input  for  transport \neconomics  and  social  resettlement,  (ii)  2  person-months  of  international  input  for  FIDIC \napplications  and  QAS,  and  (iii)  2  person-months  of  domestic  input  for  environmental \nassessment.  \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nTechnical Aspect \n\n61. \nThe Project will (i) improve road geometric design, surface condition, drainage system, \npavement strength, and bridges; (ii) widen the carriageway; and (iii) provide road signage and \nmarking. This will improve the level of service, reduce vehicle operating costs (VOCs), shorten \ntravel  time,  and  improve  riding  comfort.  The  risk  of  road  accidents  caused  by  increased  and \nfaster  travel  will  be  mitigated  by  provision  of  proper  safety  features.  The  Project  will  also \nincorporate  environmental  consideration \nincluding \nin \nbioengineering in slope protection. \n\nthe  design  and  construction, \n\nB. \n\nPolicy and Institutional Improvements \n\nThe  Project  is  built  upon  agreed  policy  reform,  particularly  in  terms  of  road  safety, \n62. \ntechnical  auditing,  and  the  establishment  and  operation  of  RBN.  Further  capacity  building \nproposed  under  the  Project  will  help  DOR  and  local  construction  and  consulting  industries  to \ndevelop  the  necessary  capacity  to  prepare  feasibility  studies,  construction  management,  and \nquality assurance. The Project will also assist DOR in accumulating capacity in mainstreaming \nHIV/AIDS  prevention  and  anti-trafficking  into  road  sector  development.  Proposed  technical \nauditing will enhance the Government\u2019s capacity and experience in dealing with irregularities in \nroad sector development. \n\nC. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n63. \nUpgraded  sample  roads  will  allow  improved  traffic  flow,  higher  vehicle  speeds,  and \nshorter  travel  times. This  will  lead  to  a  reduction  in  VOCs  and  time  costs,  which  will  stimulate \neconomic growth and increase traffic along sample roads.  \n\n64. \nAn economic assessment (Appendix 12 and Supplementary Appendix H) was conducted \nfor the three individual sample roads and for the sample roads as a whole in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.8 The economic analysis considers the \nestimated costs and benefits over the construction period and 20 years of operation. The costs \ncomprise investment costs and incremental operating costs. The estimated benefits are in terms \nof savings in VOCs and passenger time costs. The estimated EIRR of the overall sample roads \nis 18.0%; the EIRRs of the individual sample roads ranges from 12.7% to 23.4%.  \n\n65. \nSensitivity analysis was carried out for five scenarios to test the economic viability of the \nProject: (i) capital costs increased by 20%, (ii) benefits decreased by 20%, (iii) exclusion of time \nsavings benefits, (iv) exclusion of generated traffic benefits, and (v) capital costs increased by \n20% and benefits decreased by 20%. Under the worst scenario, the EIRR for the sample roads \nas  a  whole  was  13.1%,  above  the  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12%,  indicating  the  economic \n\n                                                 \n8 Economic and Development Resource Center, ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.       \n\nManila.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n \n\nviability of the Project.  \n\n66. \nDistribution  analysis  was  undertaken  to  (i)  assess  the  extent  that  the  direct  economic \nbenefits quantified in the economic analysis would accrue to poor people, and (ii) estimate the \npoverty  impact  ratio  for  the  Project.  Estimates  were  prepared  of  the  distribution  of  quantified \nbenefits among various categories of road users. A user survey was conducted to establish the \nproportion  of  the  poor  among  passenger  users,  freight  users,  and  vehicle  owners/operators. \nEstimates  of  the  poor  in  each  of  the  sample  road  areas  using  passenger  facilities  and  freight \nservices  varied  from  42.5%  to  61.4%. The  estimated  poverty  impact  ratio  was  0.44,  indicating \nthat the total net economic benefits reaching the poor is almost 50% of the total net economic \nbenefits of the sample roads.  \n\nD. \n\nSocial Impacts \n\n \n\n1. \n\nPoverty Reduction and Socioeconomic Impacts \n\nThe districts covered by the Project are the poorest in the country. According to a survey \n67. \nin  2003\u20132004,  the  project  roads  are  located  in  regions  where  poverty  incidence  is  high  (from \n37.4% to 42.9%) compared with the national average (30.8%). Most of these districts are also \nconsidered  food  insecure  districts.  As  transportation  has  been  difficult,  it  has  been  hard  to \nsupply  food  in  time  of  need  or  at  low  cost,  and  people  have  been  unable  to  sell  agricultural \nproducts to neighboring markets. \n\n68. \nThe social survey indicates that better road connectivity will help farmers sell agricultural \nproducts  to  neighboring  markets  so  that  they  can  grow  larger  marketable  surpluses.  It  will \nprovide  more  agricultural  employment,  particularly  benefiting  the  poor.  The  Project  will  also \ncreate employment opportunities for skilled and unskilled labor during implementation. Unskilled \nlabor  will  be  employed  directly  in  road  construction  and  indirectly  in  providing  materials  and \nservices  for  contractors.  The  Project  will  enable  reliable  access  to  social  services,  particularly \nhealth  care  services,  education  facilities,  and  supply  of  drinking  water.  The  direct  (access  to \nservices and markets) and indirect benefits (employment) of the Project will help reduce poverty \nand improve quality of life. The Project will have limited negative social impact (Appendix 13). \n\n \n\n2. \n\nIndigenous Peoples \n\n69.  More than 45% of the population in the 17 districts come from ethnic groups, including \nChepang,  Gurung,  Jirel,  Limbus,  Kala-Rai,  Kumals,  Magar,  Majhis,  Newar,  Rais,  Sherpa, \nSunuwar, Tamang,    and, Thami.    Due  to  language  and  cultural  criteria  used  in  defining  ethnic \ngroups in Nepal, not all ethnic groups are socio or economically marginal. Ethnic groups in the \nproject  areas  are  all  integrated  into  the  social,  cultural,  and  economic  network  of  mainstream \nsociety. A  detailed  social  survey  conducted  in  the  three  sample  road  sections  reveals  that  the \nethnic groups present are Danuwar and Majhi, and there will be no differential impact on these \ngroups from the dominant local population likely to be adversely affected by the Project. All the \npopulation in the areas will benefit equally from the socioeconomic opportunities created by the \nProject.  Improved  roads  will  increase  ethnic  groups\u2019  access  to  socioeconomic  services. \nTherefore,  it  is  not  necessary  to  prepare  an  indigenous  people\u2019s  development  plan.  Special \nmitigation  measures  have  been  included  in  the  resettlement  plans  (RPs)  to  provide  additional \nassistance  to  such  households  in  the  event  of  being  adversely  affected.  In  addition,  if  any \nimpact  is  identified  on  indigenous  people  during  preparation  of  non-sample  subprojects,  an \nindigenous  people\u2019s  development  plan  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nIndigenous  Peoples9 \n(Supplementary Appendix I).  \n\nin \n\nline  with \n\nthe \n\nindigenous  people\u2019s  development \n\nframework \n\n \n\n3. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement Aspects \n\n70. \nThe Project was developed with a view to avoid or minimize the need for land acquisition \nand  involuntary  resettlement.  Road  construction  will  largely  follow  the  existing  alignment.  The \nroads pass mostly through rural areas and markets where settlements along the road are thinly \npopulated rural dwellings. \n\n71. \nBased  on  the  preliminary  technical  design,  a  full  census  was  conducted  for  the  three \nsample roads for all affected persons (APs), land, and structures, assets within the corridor of \nimpact of 8 meters (m), with 4 m on both sides of the existing centerline. The carriageway width \nis about 4.5 m and additional land will be required where government land is not available for \nwidening and realignment. An estimated 212 households and 1,055 persons will be affected by \nthe  three  sample  roads. A  total  of  163  structures  will  be  affected  and  seven  households  may \nlose agricultural land. Other impacts will include loss of community structures and incomes, and \nlivelihoods of tenants and employees. Three RPs for three sample roads have been prepared to \nmitigate  various  impacts  and  the  summary  RP  for  the  three  sample  roads  combined  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix J. \n\n72. \nThe entitlement matrix provides for compensation and resettlement assistance to all APs \nand  small  businesses,  including  those  without  formal  title  in  the  project  corridor  of  impact.  In \naddition, provision has been made for additional assistance to match the replacement costs of \nlost assets, transaction costs, and other cash grants and resettlement assistance. Households \nheaded by females and other vulnerable households will be eligible for further assistance. The \ntotal estimated cost of resettlement and rehabilitation for the Project is about $0.28 million.  \n\n73.  MPPW has translated and disclosed the summary RP to APs and local communities in \nlocal  languages  along  the  sample  roads.  In  addition,  after  completion  of  detailed  designs,  the \nRPs will be updated on the basis of final alignment and approved by ADB prior to the award of \ncivil  works  contracts.  The  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement10  for \npreparing  the  sector  project  required  a  resettlement  framework  (RF)  for  the  remaining  non-\nsample subprojects (Supplementary Appendix K). MPPW/DOR will prepare an RP for each non-\nsample  road  based  on  detailed  design  in  accordance  with ADB\u2019s  policy  and  the  RF. ADB  will \napprove these prior to commencement of civil works. \n\n \n\n4. \n\nGender \n\n74. \nThe  Project  will  benefit  both  men  and  women  by  providing  (i)  direct  employment \nopportunities  in  construction  activities,  (ii)  easier  access  to  markets,  (iii)  better  delivery  of \nservices,  and  (iv)  improved  access  to  health  care  facilities  and  education.  Focus  group \ndiscussions with women and communities revealed that the majority of respondents supported \nthe  construction  of  the  project  roads.  The  civil  work  contracts  will  include  legally  mandated \nprovisions for health; sanitation; and appropriate working conditions (including accommodation, \nwhere  appropriate,  for  construction  workers  at  campsites  during  the  construction  period).  The \nProject will ensure that (i) civil works contractors comply with all applicable labor laws, including \nelimination of gender-differentiated wages; and (ii) both men and women directly affected by the \n                                                 \n9 ADB.

Contractors  will  ensure  that  men  and \nwomen will be given equal wages for work of equal value. A specific clause will be included in \nthe bidding documents and compliance will be strictly monitored during project implementation. \nA separate HIV/AIDS prevention and anti-trafficking program will be undertaken in project areas \nto  address  the  potential  risks  of  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  threats  that  could  be \naggravated by increased connectivity of the project areas. \n\n \n\n5. \n\nHIV/AIDS and Human Trafficking \n\n75. \nA HIV/AIDS prevention and anti-trafficking program has been prepared to (i) reduce the \nvulnerability  of  risk  groups  to  HIV/AIDS  and  trafficking,  and  (ii)  increase  access  to  HIV/AIDS \nprevention  services.  Beneficiaries  include  road  construction  workers,  transport  drivers,  female \nsex  workers,  migrants,  populations living  along  the  road  corridors,  and  DOR  project  staff. The \nfirst  phase  of  work  will  be  carried  out  in  the  three  sample  road  sections.  Based  on  lessons \nlearned, preventive activities for the HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking program will be identified for \nthe remaining road sections.  \n\nThe  HIV/AIDS  and  anti-trafficking  program  will  comprise  (i)  capacity  strengthening  of \n76. \nlocally  based  NGOs \nto  undertake  HIV/AIDS  and  anti-trafficking  awareness  activities; \n(ii) information,  education,  and  communication  on  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  anti-trafficking \nthrough  mass  media  and  bill  boards;  (iii)  advocacy  actions  on  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  anti-\ntrafficking to be organized through workshops targeting local resident communities, contractors \ninvolved  in  the  road  construction,  transportation  companies;  and  (iv)  design  of  a  HIV/AIDS \nprevention and anti-trafficking information campaign to be implemented along the project areas \nonce opened to traffic.  \n\nE. \n\nEnvironment Impact \n\nThe  overall  Project  is  classified  as  category A  because  some  roads  may  pass  through \n77. \nenvironmentally  sensitive  areas  such  as  a  national  park.  Other  roads  may  involve  only \ninsignificant physical interventions in terms of road condition improvement; they will be category \nB subprojects which require only initial environmental examination (IEE) reports. The Project is \nsubject to the Government\u2019s Environmental Protection Rules, 1997. Environmental assessment \nreports  are  required  to  obtain  government  environmental  clearances  before  commencing  civil \nworks of relevant sections. These will be granted by the Ministry of Environment, Science and \nTechnology (MOEST) for category A subprojects and by MPPW for category B roads. MOEST \nwill approve the environmental impact assessment (EIA) for category A subprojects and MPPW \nwill approve IEEs for category B subprojects.   \n\nTo comply with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy,11 the environmental impacts of three sample \n78. \nroads  were  assessed  by  undertaking  IEEs  for  Phidim\u2013Taplejung  and  Tamakoshi\u2013Manthali\u2013\nKhurkot,  and  an  EIA  for  Galchi\u2013Trisuli\u2013Dhunche-Syaphrubesi.  The  first  two  sample  roads \ninvolve  (i)  widening  the  existing  4.5  m  road  to  single-lane  standard  roads;  (ii)  improving \ndrainage;  (iii)  rehabilitating  culverts;  (iv)  constructing  causeways;  and  (v)  improving  road \nalignment,  bioengineering,  landscape,  and  road  accessories.  The  EIA  for  Galchi\u2013Trisuli\u2013\nDhunche-Syaphrubesi was undertaken since about 30 km of the road passes through Lantang \nNational  Park.  Except  for  the  potential  environmental  impacts  to  Lantang  National  Park,  the \noverall  environmental  impacts  of  the  sample  roads  were  mostly  related  to  construction  works \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2002. The Asian Development Bank Environment Policy. Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fsuch  as  increased  dust,  noise,  volatile  gas  due  to  hot-mix  plants,  and  loss  of  roadside  trees. \nThe  summary  environmental  impact  assessment  (SEIA)  covers  (i)  two  IEEs  and  one  EIA  for \nsample  roads,  and  (ii)  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  for  non-\nsample roads. The SEIA was publicized on ADB\u2019s website and submitted to the Board on 4 April \n2006.  MPPW  has  granted  the  environmental  clearance  of  Phidim\u2013Taplejung  and  Tamakoshi\u2013\nManthali\u2013Khurkot  sample  roads  (category  B).  MOEST  environmental  clearance  of  Galchi\u2013\nTrisuli\u2013Dhunche-Syaphrubesi sample road (category A) is in process.  \n\nGenerally, the Project is not expected to have adverse environmental impacts, according \n79. \nto  environmental  assessment  studies  for  sample  roads  which  portray  all  generic  potential \nenvironmental  impacts  related  to  civil  works.  The  sample  road  that  passes  through  the  buffer \nzone  of  Lantang  National  Park  (about  30  km)  is  not  expected  to  have  a  long-term  ecological \nimpact  because  (i)  the  roadside  area  has  no  precious  ecological  value  according  to  the \necological survey, and (ii) the width of the road within Lantang National Park will not be widened. \nRecommended  mitigation  measures  for  the  sample  roads,  presented  in  the  environmental \nmanagement  plans  (EMPs),  will  be  strictly  implemented.  DOR  will  be  responsible  for  carrying \nout  and  monitoring  the  overall  implementation  of  such  measures,  through  the  Geology  and \nEnvironmental  Unit.  Civil  works  contractors  will  implement  the  mitigation  measures  at  the \nconstruction stage.  \n\nThe  EIA\u2019s  of  other  roads  will  be  prepared  and  reviewed  by  following  the  EARF \n80. \n(Supplementary Appendix L), which is formulated to ensure that all other roads will be prepared \nto meet the policy requirements of the Government and ADB.  \n\nF. \n\nProject Risks \n\n81. \nADB\u2019s  portfolio  performance  in  Nepal  improved  in  2005,  as  reflected  in  increased \ncontract  awards  and  disbursement,  in  spite  of  very  challenging  circumstances  caused  by \nescalation  of  the  security  conflict  since  2000.  The  Project  has  been  carefully  formulated  to \nmanage and mitigate risks. Advance recruitment will help expedite consultant mobilization. The \nPIU  will  be  appropriately  staffed.  NGOs  will  be  selected  and  engaged  to  help  implement  land \nacquisition,  the  RP,  and  the  HIV/AIDS  and  anti-trafficking  program.  The  consultant  will  help \nprocure  land  and  monitor  project  implementation.  ADB  will  rigorously  monitor  project \nimplementation  and  technical  auditing  throughout  the  project  period  through  intensive \ninteractions with the Government, MPPW, and other funding agencies. Negative environmental \nimpacts will be mitigated through the detailed mitigation measures set out in the SEIA, which will \nbe further monitored by consultant. The Government reassures the Project\u2019s priority I status of \nstarting in FY2006/07 in terms of budget allocation, particularly the cost of land acquisition and \nresettlement. \n\nThe  Project  has  been  prepared  in  full  consultation  with  all  local  communities  which  is \n82. \nexpected to pass information to all parties in respect of the potential benefits of the Project to \nthe local poor people. A security assessment was carried out during project preparation. Local \ncommunities,  including  participants  believed  to  be  or  related  to  insurgents,  expressed  support \nfor the Project. Lessons learned by major funding agencies active in Nepal, including ADB, have \nbeen incorporated in the project design. In the past, pro-poor projects had much better chance \nof being less disturbed by the insurgency. Risk mitigation measures include (i) overprogramming \ncandidate  roads,  (ii)  encouraging  employment  of  local  contractors,  (iii)  incorporating  an \nadequate construction period in civil works contracts, and (iv) a flexible work program. Maximum \nuse of local unskilled labor will be encouraged by adopting labor-intensive construction methods \nof  construction  as  much  as  practicable.  All  these  measures  are  expected  to  help  project \n\n18 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n \n\nimplementation.  \n\n83. \nThe recent political development and newly declared cease-fire by the Government and \ninsurgents  provide  reasonable  hope  for  cautious  optimism  for  safe  and  effective  project \nimplementation.  The  Government  confirmed  the  Project\u2019s  priority  and  its  commitment  to \ncontinue  project \nthe  report  and \nrecommendation of the President and financing agreement. However, a cautious approach will \nbe adopted and a security assessment will be carried out in the process of contract award and \napproval of non-sample roads. This will prioritize sections that are considered capable of being \nimplemented safely and effectively and help in awarding contracts accordingly.12  \n\nincluding  all  agreed  assurances \n\nimplementation, \n\nin \n\n A. \n\nSpecific Assurances  \n\nVI.    ASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  MPPW  have  given  the \n\n84. \nfollowing assurances which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n\n(i)  \n\n (ii) \n\nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement.

The  Government  will  ensure  that  DOR  shall:  (a)    implement \nmitigation measures and EMP for the sample roads and for non-sample roads as \ndescribed in the IEE, EIA, and SEIA reports in accordance with the environmental \nlaws  and  regulations  of  Nepal  and    ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002);  (b) \nimplement  the  EARF  for  the  non-sample  roads;  (c)  obtain  all  necessary \nenvironmental  statutory  clearance  and  forest  clearance  prior  to  commencement \nof  civil  works  contract;  (d)  implement  and  monitor,  on  a  timely  basis,  all \nconditions attached to these clearances; (e) submit semi-annual reports to ADB \nand  other  relevant  agencies  on  the  implementation  of  EMP  and  conditions  of \nclearance for \u201cA\u201d category roads and annual report for \u201cB\u201d category roads as part \nof the progress report on project implementation; (f) submit SEIA to ADB for \u201cA\u201d \ncategory roads to be disclosed to public through ADB\u2019s website at least 120 days \nprior \nthe \nenvironmental  assessment  reports  including  EMP,  and  ensure  that  contractors \nimplement  the  required  mitigation  measures  and  EMP  as  described  in  such \nreports. \n\nto  sub-project  approval;  and  (g)  provide \n\nthe  contractors  with \n\n (iii)  Governance.    The  Government  will,  in  addition  to  its  application  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998),  undertake  other  measures \nto  ensure  good \ngovernance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  including  (a)  cause  MPPW  to \nengage consultants to conduct technical audit in line with the approved TORs at \nkey  project  implementation  milestones  in  respect  of  procurement,  payment  and \nconstruction  quality;  and  (b)  within  12  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  establish \n\n                                                 \n12 A Board information paper on recent developments in Nepal was circulated on 26 May 2006. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nand  maintain  a  special  website,  in  a  form  acceptable  to  ADB,  to  track  project \nimplementation and administration of funds. \n\n(iv) \n\nRealignment.    If  any  major  realignment  of  the  sample  roads  is  required,  the \nGovernment  will  submit  a  proposal  to  ADB  for  approval  of  the  economic, \nengineering,  environmental  and  social/resettlement  assessment  of  such  a \nchange.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  applicable  environment  clearance  be \nobtained.    RP  will  be  updated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement  and  submitted  to ADB  for  approval  prior  to  commencing  any  land \nacquisition and resettlement activities for the realigned section.  \n\n(v)   Operation and maintenance.  The Government will ensure that (a) DOR will be \nresponsible  for  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  project  roads  through \nproper technical supervision and adequate allocation of funds; and (b) additional \nbudgetary allocations are made available for periodic maintenance of at least 500 \nkm  of  SRN  each  fiscal  year  from  FY2007/08\u20132012/13  and  thereafter  all \nmaintainable roads required as per road conditions. \n\n(vi) \n\nRoad  safety  and  overloading.    The  Government  will  make  effective  and \nimplement  its  Heavy  Vehicle  Management  Policy,  ensure  the  use  of  weighing \nbridges  to  monitor  overloading  and  apply  measures  for  load  enforcement, \nincluding  imposition  of  applicable  penalties  on  violators  in  accordance  with  this \nPolicy,  the  Vehicle  and  Transport  Management  Act  and  Public  Roads  Act  of \nNepal.  DOR  shall  provide  an  annual  report  to  ADB  on  the  status  of  load \nenforcement measures, incidence of vehicle overloading, and other agreed upon \nbenchmarks. \n\n(vii)  HIV/AIDS  and  anti-trafficking.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  civil  works \ncontracts  reflect  the  need  for  an  information  and  education  campaign  on \nHIV/AIDS  and  anti-trafficking  of  women  and  children  as  part  of  the  health  and \nsafety program.   \n\n(viii) \n\nfacilities \n\n Labor laws. The Government will ensure that the civil works contractors comply \nwith  all  applicable  labor  laws  and  regulations  of  Nepal  and,  in  particular,  (a)  do \nnot  employ  child  labor  for  construction  and  maintenance  activities,  and  (b) \nprovide  appropriate \nfor  children  at  construction  campsites.  The \nGovernment  will  set  employment  targets  for  women  and  low  caste  workers  for \nconstruction activities and require contractors not to differentiate wages between \nmen  and  women  for  work  of  equal  value.  The  Government  will  ensure  that \nspecific  clause  will  be  included  in  bidding  documents  to  ensure  adherence  to \nthese  provisions  and  that  compliance  will  be  strictly  monitored  during  project \nimplementation. \n\nB. \n\nConditions for Award of Civil Works Contract \n\nThe  Government  shall  not  award  any  civil  works  contract  financed  under  the  grant \n\nobtained approval of ADB to the RPs for Non-sample Roads, based on detailed \ndesign,  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement \n(1995)  and  the  RF,  and  disclosed  to  the  affected  persons  (APs)  in  the  local \nlanguage; \n\n85. \nunless it has - \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21\n \n\nobtained approval of ADB to the RPs for Sample Roads, updated on the basis of \nthe final alignment after completion of detailed design, and disclosed to the APs \nin the local language; \n\nobtained  approval  of  ADB,  in  case  of  any  impact  on  indigenous  people,    to  the \nindigenous peoples development plan prepared and implemented in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998),  and  as  set  out  in  the  agreed \nindigenous peoples development framework;   \n\nprovided  to  ADB  the  environment  assessment  report  including  environmental \nmanagement plan in accordance with ADB's Environmental Policy (2002) prior to \nits approval of the subprojects; and  \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\nacquired  or  made  available  the  land  and  rights  in  land  free  from  any \nencumbrances, and cleared any obstruction relating to the first section required \nto  be  handed  over  for  commencement  of  construction  in  accordance  with  the \nwork schedule proposed under the relevant civil works contract. \n\n \n86.

Nepal\u2019s transport infrastructure mainly consists of roads and civil aviation. Roads carry \nabout 90% of all passengers and freight within the country. A key part of Nepal\u2019s road system \nis the strategic road network (SRN). The national highways consist of the East\u2013West Highway \nand north\u2013south highways, linking major towns and serving much of the population. The East\u2013\nWest Highway stretches from Gaddachauki at the western border with India, to Kakarbhitta at \nthe  eastern  border  with  India,  runs  the  length  of  the  country  across  the  Terai,  and  is \nconnected  through  north\u2013south  links  to  Kathmandu.  The  Tribhuvan  highway  is  also  vital, \nconnecting  Birganj  at  the  southern  border  with  India,  the  country\u2019s  most  important  trade \nborder, to Kathmandu.  \n\n2.  Road transport is the dominant mode for moving passenger and freight traffic in Nepal\u2019s \ntransport sector. However, road density is low at 11.40 kilometers (km) of road per 100 square \nkilometers  (km2)  and  0.71  km  per  1,000  population\u2014less than  that  in neighboring  countries. \nThis  is  mainly  due  to  the  country\u2019s  complex  topography  and  insufficient  resources,  which \nresult in lack of road access for about 4 million Nepalese. This problem is particularly acute in \nthe north and western remote hilly areas and contributes to rural poverty. \n\nB. \n\nRoad Network \n\n3. \nThe  national  road  network  comprises  national  highways,  feeder  roads,  urban  roads, \ndistrict roads, and village roads. The national highways and feeder roads form the SRN, which \nis the backbone of the national road network. Construction and maintenance of the SRN is the \nresponsibility  of  the  Department  of  Roads  (DOR).  District  roads  and  village  roads  form  the \ndistrict  road  network.  In  2002,  the  national  road  network  had  a  total  of  16,834  km  of  roads, \ncomprising 4,861 km (29%) of strategic roads, 2,198 km (13%) of urban roads, and 9,775 km \n(58%) of district roads. Feeder Roads totaled 2,034 km in length. These roads form the major \nconnections \nto  district  headquarters.  However,  15  district \nheadquarters  are  not  connected  by  road.  About  two  thirds  of  the  road  network  remains \nunpaved and much remains impassable during the wet season, especially in hilly areas. \n\nfrom  national  highways \n\nC. \n\nTraffic and Vehicle Fleet \n\n4. \nAn important feature of road transport within Nepal is the relatively low traffic volume. \nOutside  Kathmandu  Valley,  the  highest  volumes  are  2,500\u20133,000  vehicles  per  day  (vpd)  on \nthe main route to the border with India. On key links in the Terai, volumes are 300\u20131,000 vpd, \nwith flows of 100\u2013200 vpd on the main hill roads. Earth roads at the extremities of the network \nmay  have  traffic  volumes  of  less  than  25  vpd.  Except  around  Kathmandu,  where  cars  are \ncommon,  traffic  is  still  dominated  by  buses  and  trucks  and,  increasingly,  motorcycles.  The \nregistered  motor  vehicle  fleet  in  2005  comprised  432,264  units.  This  represents  an  average \nannual growth rate of about 13%, with the highest growth in motorcycles.   \n\nD. \n\nTransport Planning and Coordination \n\n5. \nThe  National  Planning  Commission  sets  overall  development  objectives  and \ncoordinates  the  investment  programs  of  external  agencies  and  government  agencies.  The \nMinistry  of  Physical  Planning  and  Works  (MPPW)  has  prime  responsibility  for  planning  and \nformulating  policies;  and  managing  all  land  transport  facilities,  including  roads  and  bridges. \nThe Ministry of Local Development (MLD) is responsible for district roads.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f      \n26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\n6. \nWithin  MPPW,  DOR  is  responsible  for  network  planning,  design,  construction,  and \nmaintenance of the SRN; municipalities are responsible for urban roads. The Department of \nTransport  Management  (DOTM)  within  the  Ministry  of  Labor  and  Transport  Management  is \nresponsible  for  regulating  road  transport,  including  vehicle  registration  and  licensing.  The \nDepartment  of  Local  Infrastructure  Development  and  Agricultural  Roads  (DOLIDAR),  within \nMLD,  is  responsible  for  (i)  coordinating  and  facilitating  rural  infrastructure  development \nthroughout the country, and (ii) providing technical guidance and support at the local level. \n\nE. \n\nCapacity Building \n\nSubstantial  efforts  have  been  under  way \n\n7. \nthe \nGovernment and various external funding agencies, as part of ongoing projects, to help DOR \nimprove its road management capacity, planning and monitoring capability, and environmental \nand traffic safety practices. DOR has been able to develop and improve its basic capabilities \nto improve its management of the road capital and resources allocated to the sector.  \n\nthrough  partnerships  between \n\n8. \nThe  Department  for  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom  and  the  Swiss \nAgency for  Development and Cooperation have assisted in establishing and supporting new \nunits to strengthen DOR\u2019s functions, including (i) Maintenance and Rehabilitation Coordination \nUnit,  which  prepared  various  departmental  policies;  (ii)  Road  Sector  Skill  Development  Unit; \n(iii) Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Unit;  and  (iv)  Geo-environmental  Unit.  The  World  Bank \nundertook  a  mechanical  branch  review,  carried  out  management  information  system  and  IT \nneeds  study,  prepared  training  management  guidelines,  and  assisted  in  establishing  Roads \nBoard Nepal (RBN) in 2002. ADB assisted in the introduction of resealing practices in 1987. \nOther important achievements by ADB were (i) technical assistance, including the Road and \nRoad Transport Institutional Development Project, which led to the establishment of the Office \nof  the  Chief  Technical  Examiner  in  MPPW;  and  (ii)  preparation  of  public  works  directives \n(PWD) under the Strengthening Project Implementation Practices1 project. Establishment of a \ntechnical audit system under this project is an important ongoing ADB program at the National \nVigilance Centre. \n\n9. \nOngoing capacity building activities include planned maintenance for SRN under DOR, \nassisted by the Swiss Agency for Development  and Cooperation; and introducing the length \nworker  system  for  routine  maintenance  at  the  divisional  office  level  since  1993.  The  World \nBank  has  continued  involvement  in  capacity  building  and  institutional  strengthening  of  DOR \nthrough  an  institutional  strengthening  component.  An  ongoing  study  contains  an  extensive \ncapacity building and institutional strengthening component, including (i) preparation of a long-\nterm  institutional  strategy  for  the  SRN,  (ii)  comprehensive  DOR  corporate  planning  and \nperformance  management,  (iii)  DOR  planning  and  management  using  efficient  information \ntechnology  and  a  management  information  system,  (iv)  effective  monitoring  and  evaluation \ncapacity, and (v) improved project financial management.  \n\n10. \nSupport for capacity building of DOLIDAR and local bodies in the road sector has only \nbegun  recently.  The  Department  for  International  Development  has  been  focusing  on \nimproving the capacity of institutions associated with rural infrastructure development and has \nsupported  DOLIDAR  and  local  bodies  in  infrastructure  planning.  The  German  Development \nCooperation,  through  Germany  Technology  Cooperation  (GTZ),  also  has  contributed  by \nfor  rural  roads  and  preparing  Rural  Road \nestablishing  a  maintenance  mechanism \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Nepal for the Strengthening Project Implementation  \n  Practices. Manila. . \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27\n\nMaintenance Manual in Nepal in 2005. A new institutional strengthening program in the rural \nroads sector is being funded by the World Bank under the Institutional Strengthening Action \nPlan \nImprovement  and \nfor  Local \nDecentralization Project. \n\nInfrastructure  Development  Sector,  Rural  Access \n\n11.  Many  programs  have  been  carried  out  by  international  funding  agencies,  including \nADB. However, DOR still needs capacity building in certain areas, including (i) feasibility study \nmethodology,  especially  economic,  social,  and  environmental  assessment;  (ii)  contract \nmanagement; and (iii) quality assurance systems. \n\n12. \nThe  Government  has  given  priority  to  routine  and  recurrent  road  maintenance  of  the \nSRN  over  recent  years.  Three  roads  in  Nepal  are  tolled.  At  least  70%  of  the  tolls  will  be \nexclusively  used  for  routine  and  recurrent  maintenance  of  tolled  roads.  Tolling  must  be \napproved by the Government through RBN.  \n\nF. \n\nRoad Transport Services \n\n1. \n\nRoad Passenger Services \n\n13. \nOperators of road passenger services are privately owned. The bus transport industry \nis  regulated  by  DOTM  at  all  levels.  All  bus  operators  must  be  registered  as  an  individual  or \ncompany.  Buses  are  checked  every  6  months  for  roadworthiness.  Tourist  buses  are \nregistered separately and are limited to carrying tourists only.  \n\n14. \nFor  all-weather  roads,  DOTM  designates  the  bus  routes  and  issues  route  permits. \nThere are no conditions on these route permits. Maximum fares for a particular route are set \nby  DOTM  on  a  route  basis,  and  take  account  of  road  pavement  type  and  existing  peak  bus \nloadings.  Changes  in  bus  fares  are  not  immediately  responsive  to  changes  in  operating \nconditions.  Routes  and  fares  are  agreed  between  bus  operators  and  village  development \ncommittees  where  DOTM  has  not  specified  a  route.  Proposals  for  new  services  come  from \noperators or village development committees.  \n\n2. \n\nRoad Freight Services \n\n15. \nCommercial  vehicles  must  be  licensed  by  DOTM  to  operate.  There  are  two  types  of \nroute  permits  for  freight  traffic:  (i)  for  a  specific  route,  and  (ii)  countrywide.  All  route  permits \nmust be renewed every 4 months. DOTM also approves maximum freight rates. \n\n16. \nThe  road  freight  transport  industry,  which  carries  over  90%  of  freight  traffic,  is \ndominated  by  private  operators  who  are  mostly  owner-drivers.  Most  of  these  operators  are \nmembers  of  transport  associations,  although  a  growing  number  of  independent  operators \ncompete for loads and keep the market competitive. \n\n17. \nFreight  rates  reflect  the  condition  of  the  road.  Rates  on  unpaved  sections  in  hilly  or \nmountainous terrain are NRs15\u2013NRs25 per ton-km, compared with around NRs3\u2013NRs10 per \nton-km on paved sections in flat terrain. This general link between road condition and freight \nrates is seen in all areas. \n\nG. \n\nGovernment\u2019s Road Sector Plan \n\n18. \nSince the 1970s, the Government\u2019s main objective in the road subsector has been the \ncompletion  of  the  SRN  as  well  as  integrating  the  country.  Improved  access  and  reduced \n\n \n\n \n\n\f      \n28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\ntransport  costs  are  expected  to  stimulate  economic  development,  particularly  in  agriculture. \nThis will help reduce regional disparities.  \n\nThe main objectives of the 10th five-year plan in the road sector are to (i) develop and \n19. \nmanage the road transport network to support socioeconomic development, and (ii) promote \nprivate sector participation in the construction of new road networks and maintenance. Major \nstrategies  include  (i)  increased  private  sector  participation  in  road  construction  and \nmaintenance,  (ii) enhanced  institutional  capacities  of  DOR  and  the  private  sector  to  ensure \ncost-effective sustainability of the road network, and (iii) transferring the responsibility for rural \nroads to local government. \n\n20. \nTo  encourage  increased  private  sector  involvement,  legislation  will  be  enacted  for \nimplementation  of  BOT  and  BOOT  policies.  An  additional  10  district  headquarters  will  be \nconnected  by  road,  increasing  the  number  of  district  headquarters  with  road  connections  to \n70. The private sector will increasingly participate in road construction and maintenance. \n\nH. \n\nRevenues and Expenditure \n\n21. \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  provides  funds  for  maintenance  of  the  SRN  through \nRBN and DOR. Since the establishment of RBN, it approves DOR\u2019s annual road maintenance \nplan  and  controls  the  part  of  the  budget  funded  by  RNB.  DOR  is  the  planning  and \nimplementation  agency  for  maintenance,  and  uses  other  funds  such  as  direct  government \nallocation  and  externally  funded  projects.  RBN\u2019s  funding  is  sourced  mainly  from  fuel  levies \n(48.7%), vehicle registration fees (33.5%), and tolls (17.8%). These will be used to maintain all \nroads. The total fund resources were NRs400 million for FY2005/06. Of this, NRs270 million \nwas  allocated  for  SRN  roads,  NRs49.8  million  for  urban  roads,  NRs67.4  million  for  district \nroads,  and  NRs13  million  for  administrative  expenses.  In addition,  the  Government  provides \nNRs290 million ($4.1 million) to DOR for SRN maintenance. The Government plans to provide \nadequate funding each year to RBN and eventually budget all road maintenance fund through \nRBN. The Government\u2019s budget support for road maintenance will continue until RBN revenue \ncollection  can  fully  meet  the  road  maintenance  fund  requirement.  The  Government  currently \nprovides full funding for routine, recurrent, and most periodic maintenance. It will provide full \nfunding  periodic  maintenance  of  at  least  500  km  each  year  from  2006  to  2012  to  ensure \nproper  maintenance  of  maintainable  SRN  roads  and  clear  up  all  800  km  of  deferred \nmaintenance.    \n\n22. \nTable  A2.1  details  Nepal\u2019s  road  sector  expenditure  from  2002  to  2004  and  planned \nincome  and  expenditure  for  2005,  and  indicates  that  revenue  for  the  road  sector  currently \nrequires  foreign  assistance.  It  is  anticipated  that  the  transport  sector  will  raise  $31  million  in \nFY2004/05 from transport related taxes and fees. This is about 45% of the current SRN road \nexpenditure allocation.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nItem \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n29\n\nTable A2.1: Road Sector SRN Budget: FY2004\u20132005 \n($ million) \nActual \nExpenditure \nFY2003\u20132004 \n \n\nActual \nExpenditure \nFY2002\u20132003 \n \n\nAllocated Budget  \nFY2004\u20132005 \n\nGovernment  Grant \n\n \nA.

considered for the program were those listed in the Road Master Plan (2002\u2013\n1. \n2022). After initial screening, 20 roads were considered for multi-criteria analysis to prioritize the \nlist and select roads for inclusion in the Program. \n\nMulti-Criteria Analysis \n\nB. \n\n2. \n\nThe criteria used were as follows (weighting in parentheses): \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n(viii) \n(ix) \n(x) \n\ndistrict connectivity (8.3); \neconomic worth (8.2); \ncost per kilometer (6.0); \npotential economic development of the zone or district (especially tourism) (8.7); \ncontribution to the transport master plan and country strategy program (6.3); \nsocial issues and poverty reduction (8.0); \nenvironmental impact (negative worth) (5.2); \nsecurity considerations (4.9); \npopulation served (6.8); and \nrural network connected (7.8). \n\n3. \nThe roads that ranked highest in the analysis were selected for inclusion in the Program. \nBudget  limitations  were  taken  into  account  to  maximize  total  road  length.  Road  projects  that \nwere  planned  for  construction  by  other  funding  agencies,  but  dropped  from  the  prioritized  list, \nwere also considered. A total of 490 kilometers (km) of roads were selected. \n\n4. \nAdditional  roads  are  included  in  an  expanded  list  to  allow  for  possible  changes  in  the \noriginal  list  prior  to  implementation,  particularly  as  the  Government  is  producing  a  revised \npriority investment plan. These additional roads,  if not finally included in the Program, may be \nincluded in any future projects. \n\nC. \n\nSample Road Selection \n\n5. \nGeneral  requirements  for  sample  roads  were  that  they  should  be  representative  of  the \nfinal  roads  package  and,  in  the  case  of  environment  and  resettlement,  the  \u201cworst\u201d  end  of  the \nimpacts. \n\n6. \n\nSelection of sample roads followed these general principles: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nIt should be reasonably certain that they would be part of the package of roads \nselected for the medium-term plan package after prioritization. \nThey should include roads which improved access to district headquarters \n(district connectivity). \nIf any of the prioritized roads were class A environment, then one of the sample \nroads must also be class A. \nThey should be relatively easily accessible and should not be in an existing \nserious conflict area. \nThere should be some new construction but the majority of the work should be \nupgrading of existing roads. \n\n \n\n\f \n \n \n\n7. \n\nAppendix 4 \n \n  \n\n33 \n \n\nBased on the above criteria, three roads were selected: \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nGalchhi\u2013Trishuli\u2013Dhunche\u2013Syaprubesi in the Central Region, \nTamacoshi\u2013Manthali\u2013Kurkhot in the Central Region, and \nPhidim\u2013Taplejung in the Eastern Region. \n\nD. \n\nMedium-Term Road Projects \n\n8. \nThe full list of road projects to be included in the medium-term project is in Table A4. The \nfirst three roads are the sample roads that have been assessed and can now proceed to final \ndesign. Roads 4\u201311 are the remaining non-sample roads and one large bridge for the first road \nsector road, requiring feasibility assessment before detailed design; their inclusion will depend \non  feasibility,  revised  cost  estimation,  and  budget.  Roads  12\u201316  are  additional  roads  that  will \nonly be considered for sector finance if any of the other roads are dropped from the list. Roads \n17\u201325 are the remaining roads to be considered in the overall medium-term plan. \n\nTable A4: Prioritized Project Roads \n\n   Region \n\nRoad \n\nDistricts \nTraversed \n\nRoad \nLength \n(km) \n\n  A.

Recent studies on highway routes highlight that these \ngroups have a higher risk of being exposed to HIV/AIDS. It is estimated that there were 62,000 \npeople  living  with  HIV/AIDS  in  Nepal  in  2003  and  871  reported  AIDS  cases  by  the  end  of \nMarch 2005.  The  current  estimated  HIV  infection  rate  is  0.5%  in  the  economically  productive \nage group of 20\u201349, with higher prevalence reported among migrants from remote rural areas of \nNepal. The HIV epidemic has rapidly changed in the last 3 years and recent data show a very \nlow  level  of  HIV  awareness  and  risk  perception,  especially  among  women.  Most  risk  areas \ninclude  city  centers,  transport  junctions,  corridors  along  highways,  and  areas  where  people \nregularly migrate for work. HIV infection has been noted in all regions of the country, although it \nis concentrated in urbanized areas and districts with high labor migration. Areas supplying more \nmigrants such as the midwest and far-west regions are more vulnerable.  \n\nB. \n\nTrafficking in Women and Children Issues \n\n2. \nAlthough progress has been made in reducing human trafficking in recent years, Nepal \ncontinues  to  be  a  source  country  for  children  and  women  trafficked  overseas.  They  are  often \nsubject to abuse and are vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. Reports indicate that internal trafficking is on \nthe rise because of the insurgency, as rural women and children leave to seek employment and \nsecurity in urban centers. \n\n3. \nAccurate  data  on  trafficking  is  difficult  to  obtain  because  of  its  clandestine  nature,  and \nreported statistics vary considerably. However, 2001 census data highlights that the proportion \nof  male  and  female  absent  from  the  household  without  a  known  reason  is  higher  for  women \nthan  for  men,  indicating  their  possibility  of  being  trafficked.  The  Government  has  identified  26 \nhigh-priority  districts  as  source  areas  for  trafficking  and  established  anti-trafficking  vigilance \ncommittees.  High-risk  areas  for  trafficking  include  cities,  markets,  highway  bus  junctions  or \nareas to or from where migration takes place, areas with low literacy. Girls and women aged 11\u2013\n25 and boys aged 6\u201312 are most vulnerable to trafficking.   \n\nC. \n\nExternal Assistance to HIV/AIDS and Anti-Trafficking   \n\nIn  Nepal, \n\nthere  are  more \n\nthan  50  domestic  and \n\ninternational  nongovernment \n4. \norganizations (NGOs) working in HIV/AIDS prevention, and 57 NGOs working in anti-trafficking \nactivities,  in  addition  to  United  Nations  agencies  and  government  efforts. The  National  Center \nfor  AIDS  and  Sexually  Transmitted  Disease  (STD)  Control,  under  the  Ministry  of  Health, \ncoordinates the activities of all stakeholders in fulfilling commitments made in the National AIDS \nStrategy (2002\u20132006) which emphasizes prevention as the mainstay for an effective response. \nAnti-trafficking activities are coordinated by the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare.  \n\nThe  largest  funding  agency  for  HIV/AIDS  and  anti-trafficking  initiatives  is  the  United \n5. \nStates  Agency  for  International  Development.  In  terms  of  financial  and  human  resources, \ninternational  assistance  has  contributed  significantly  toward  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  anti-\ntrafficking.   \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f      \n36 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n\nAwareness programs on anti-trafficking initiatives have reached 49 districts and there is \n6. \na rich resource of information, education, and communications materials on anti-trafficking. Until \nnow,  the  major  focus  has  been  on  awareness  raising,  advocacy,  networking,  and  social \nmobilization. Most anti-trafficking work has taken place in the Terai districts; the hill districts have \nreceived the least attention. All support is geared toward assisting the Government to implement \nits  national  action  plan  against  trafficking  in  children  and  women  for  sexual  and  labor \nexploitation. Campaigns are made to target potential victims and deter traffickers by advertising \n20-year punishment for trafficking. Such efforts are reported to have resulted in the interception \nand rescue of potential victims. The police have established women\u2019s cells in 17 districts, which \nhave  helped  control  crime  and  improve  investigation,  protect  women  and  children,  and  assist \nrescue efforts. \n\nD. \n\nExisting Situation of HIV/AIDS and Human Trafficking in the Project Districts   \n\n7. \nOf the project areas, roads in the far-west and midwest regions have been identified as \nhighly  vulnerable  to  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  because  of  the  high  level  of  male  out-\nmigration to overseas for seasonal employment. Until now, HIV/AIDS prevention activities have \nbeen  limited  to  awareness  of  schoolteachers,  with  limited  funds.  The  Project\u2019s  social \nassessment,  conducted  along  the  three  sample  road  areas,  reports  a  very  low  level  of  HIV \nawareness and risk perception, especially among women. The districts in the central region are \ntrafficking-prone districts.  \n\nE. \n\nThe Proposed HIV/AIDS and Anti-Trafficking Program for the Project  \n\nThe objective of the HIV/AIDS and Anti-Trafficking Program is to reduce the vulnerability \n8. \nof  population  groups  who  are  at  risk  of  HIV/AIDS  and  trafficking,  and  increase  access  to  HIV \nprevention  services.  Beneficiaries  include  road  construction  workers,  transport  drivers,  female \nsex  workers,  migrants,  populations  living  along  the  road  corridors,  locally  based  government \nemployees,  and  Department  of  Roads  (DOR)  project  staff.  The  program  will  include \n(i) increasing  the  level  of  awareness  about  prevention  of  HIV/AIDS  and  trafficking  among  the \ndifferent  communities,  especially  vulnerable  and  high-risk  groups;  and  (ii)  developing  effective \nprocedures to prevent AIDS and trafficking along the project areas. \n\n9. \nThe  HIV/AIDS  awareness  campaign  includes  key  activities  such  as  (i)  orientation  and \nsensitization  of  project  personnel;  (ii)  HIV/AIDS  awareness  raising  for  contractors  and \nconstruction  workers;  (iii)  a  public  awareness  campaign  and  behavioral  change  of  high-risk \ngroups;  (iv)  condom  promotion;  and  (v)  networking  with  testing,  counseling,  and  treatment \nservices.  Information  will  be  distributed  by  NGOs  regarding  the  nearest  available  services  for \ntesting, counseling, and treatment. \n\nTo  address  the  risks  and  concerns  of  trafficking,  sensitization  will  be  created  in  the \n10. \nproject areas including (i) sensitization and capacity building of project personnel; and (ii) public \nawareness  raising.  NGOs  will  perform  the  awareness  raising  among  the  public  and  target \ngroups through the media and information, education, and communications materials.  \n\nF. \n\nLinkages with Existing Programs on HIV/AIDS and Anti-trafficking \n\n11. \nThe  proposed  activities  along  the  project  areas  are  fully  supported  by  active  funding \nagencies  including  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  and  Joint  United \nNations  Programme  on  HIV/AIDS  in  this  field.  Assistance  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  will  be  carefully  aligned  with  the  resources  of  other  funding  agencies  to  complement \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n \n  \n\n37 \n \n\nexisting work in HIV/AIDS prevention and anti-trafficking and avoid duplication. The Government \nrecognizes  HIV/AIDS  as  a  crosscutting  development  theme.  The  Project  provides  an \nopportunity to (i) link the transport sector with already existing HIV/AIDS prevention programs in \nsupport of the National AIDS Strategy, and (ii) increase access to HIV/AIDS services and care. \nTherefore, the introduction of grant financing provides new opportunities for ADB to collaborate \nand  harmonize  HIV/AIDS  and  anti-trafficking  interventions  with  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders \nand beneficiaries, on a district-by-district basis and in the project districts, leading to enhanced \neffectiveness of the Project. \n\nG. \n\nCost and Financing \n\n12. \nThe program will be financed through Asian Development Fund IX (ADF IX) grant funds \nestimated  at  the  equivalent  of  $200,000.  The  Program  will  be  administered  by  ADB.  The \nGovernment  will  provide  office  accommodation,  counterpart  staff,  and  other  miscellaneous \nexpenditures.   \n\nH. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n13. \nThe program will be executed over a period of 3 years. The Ministry of Physical Planning \nand  Works  (MPPW)  will  be  the  Executing Agency  and  DOR  will  be  the  Implementing Agency. \nThe project implementation unit (PIU) will implement the program. An individual domestic social \ndevelopment  consultant  with  expertise  in  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  anti-trafficking  will  be \nengaged by MPPW for 36 person-months over the project period. \n \nThe  consultant  will  support  DOR  for  overall  implementation  and  monitoring  of  the \n14. \nprogram, and be responsible for identification of suitable NGOs to be engaged by MPPW and \nfinanced  from  the  program  for  implementation  at  DOR  local  field  offices.  The  consultant  shall \ncarry  out  proper  financial  management  and  procurement  of  services  from  NGOs,  civil  society, \nand private firms selected on a competitive basis. The consultant shall be subject to monitoring \nfrom the feasibility study, design, and construction supervision consultant. Separate account will \nbe  established  and  managed  under  the  PIU,  and  subject  to  overall  project  auditing \nrequirements.  The  selection  criteria  of  NGOs  will  include  experience  in  HIV/AIDS  and  anti-\ntrafficking  initiatives,  familiarity  with  the  project  sites  and  districts,  and  sensitivity  to  gender \nissues. Recruitment of the consultant and NGOs requires prior approval from ADB.  \n\n15. \nIn  the  first  phase,  the  program  will  be  implemented  in  three  road  corridors.  Based  on \nlessons  learned,  preventive  activities  for  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  anti-trafficking  activities  will \nbe identified for the remaining road sections.   \n\nI. \n\nReporting, Monitoring, and Evaluation \n\n16. \nThe  consultant  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  an  inception  report  and  quarterly \nprogress reports to be submitted to ADB and DOR. The consultant, through the PIU, will liaise \nwith  DOR  field  offices  for  overall  monitoring  and  supervision.  In  addition  to  regular  ADB \nsupervision, the program will be reviewed in detail during the project midterm review mission to \nassess  progress  and  agree  on  any  changes  in  scope  or  implementation  arrangements.  Two \nmonths prior to the midterm review, the consultant will submit to ADB a detailed status report on \nimplementation of the program.  \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f      \n38 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n \n\nHIV/AIDS AND ANTI-TRAFFICKING DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n\nPerformance Targets/Indicators \n\nDesign \nSummary \n\nImpact \n\n\u2022  Vulnerability of \n\n\u2022  Reduction in HIV-sero prevalence in the \n\npopulation groups \nwho are at risk of \nHIV/AIDS and \ntrafficking because of \nincreased road \nconnectivity is \nreduced \n\ngeneral population and vulnerable \nsubgroups in the project area \n\n \n\u2022  Reduction in the number of trafficking \ncases among the general population \nand vulnerable groups in the project \narea \n\n \n\u2022  HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking issues \nintegrated in future road projects \n\nAssumptions  \nand Risks  \n\n\u2022  Social disturbance, \n\npolitical instability, or \nnatural disasters do not \naffect the project areas. \n\n \n\n \n\nData Sources/  \nReporting \nMechanisms  \n\n \n\u2022  NCASC national \nand district level \nstatistics \n\n \n\u2022  MWCSW \n\nnational and \ndistrict level \nstatistics \n\n \n\u2022  Progress reports \n \n\n \n\u2022  Surveys of \n\n\u2022  HIV/AIDS and anti-human trafficking \n\nawareness reached 90% of target groups\n\ntarget groups \n\n \n\u2022  70% among target groups practice safe \n\n \n\u2022  Condom sales \n\nbehavior  \n\n \n\u2022  Increased access to HIV and anti-\ntrafficking prevention services \n\n \n\u2022  Capacity of DOR and other relevant \n\nagencies related to HIV/AIDS and anti-\ntrafficking increased  \n\n(baseline \ndetermined \nthrough sales \ndata in year 1 of \nthe Project)  \n\n \n\u2022  Progress reports \n \n\n \n\u2022  Strong coordination of \n\nDOR, NCASC, Ministry \nof Health, MWCSW, and \nrelevant district level \nauthorities  \n\n \n\u2022  Adequate financing \n\nmechanisms, availability \nof funds, and timely \npayments to project \nimplementation partners \nand NGOs \n\n \n\n1.1 90% of road construction workers, \ntransport operators, female sex workers, \nlabor migrants, populations living along \nthe road corridors, reached by the project \n \n \n2.1 70% of the male target group and \nfemale sex workers report consistent \ncondom use \n \n2.2 100% of the male target group and \nfemale sex workers know the benefit of \nusing condoms \n \n2.3 Condom sales increased by 50% \n \n2.4 50% of the target groups access TCT \nservices \n \n3.1 100% of girls and women aged 11-25 \nand boys aged 6-12 reached with anti-\ntrafficking messages \n \n4.1 DOR staff sensitized and trained on \n\n \n\u2022  Progress reports \n \n\u2022  Surveys of \n\ntarget \npopulation on \nawareness of \nHIV/AIDS \nprevention and \ntrafficking \n\n \n\u2022  Focus group \n\ndiscussions with \nwomen and \nchildren  \n\n \n\u2022  Types and \n\nnumbers of IEC \nmaterials \nproduces and \ndistributed \n\n \n\u2022  Workshop/ \n\ntraining reports \n\n \n\n \n\u2022  Human resources and \ntechnical capacity of \nNGOs are adequate to \nundertake activities \n\n \n\u2022  Target populations \n\nrespond favorably to \nHIV/AIDS prevention \nand anti-trafficking \ninitiatives \n\n \n\u2022  DOR remains \n\ncommitted to support \nHIV/AIDS and anti-\ntrafficking prevention \nactivities after \ncompletion of the \nProject \n\n \n\u2022  Construction companies \nfacilitate information \nsessions at work sites \nand allow selected \nworkers to attend \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nOutcome \n\u2022  The risk of HIV/AIDS \n\ntransmission HIV/AIDS \nis reduced among \nconstruction workers, \nlocal resident \ncommunities, vulnerable \ngroups (women and \nchildren), ethnic groups, \ncommercial sex \nworkers, truck drivers, \nand migrants in the \nproject area. \n\n \n\u2022  Increased risk of human \ntrafficking in the project \nareas is reduced. \n\n \nOutputs \n1.

Benefits to the road users were estimated by comparing the differences between the \ncosts  in  the  without-project  scenario  with  those  in  the  with-project  scenario  for  each  of  the \nsample  roads.  The  without-project  case  in  the  economic  evaluation  represents  the  current \nsituation. The with-project case is represented by improving the roads to all-weather standard. \nImproved  roads  will  reduce  vehicle  operating  costs  (VOCs)  and  time  costs,  which  stimulate \neconomic growth, resulting in increased traffic along the project roads. The ECEVAL compared \nthe  annual  streams  of  economic  capital  and  operating  costs  and  benefits,  and  computed  the \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR). All costs and benefits were expressed in 2005 constant \nprices. The analysis period is for the construction period followed by 20 years of operation.  \n\nB. \n\nRoad Condition and Traffic \n\n1. \n\nRoad Condition \n\nThe  existing  road  condition  for  the  three  sample  roads  has  been  investigated  by \n2. \ntopographic, pavement condition, and roughness surveys. Based on traffic flow and pavement \ncondition,  the  sample  roads  were  divided  into  homogeneous  sections.  The  average  surface \nroughness level for the existing sample roads, in accordance with the International Roughness \nIndex (IRI), are in Table A12.1. \n\nTable A12.1: Sample Roads and Road Condition Data \n\nRoad  \n\nDescription \n\n1 \n2 \n3 \n\nGalchhi\u2013Syaphrubesi \nTamakoshi\u2013Khurkot    \nPhidim\u2013Taplejung \n\nDistance \n(km) \n89.0 \n55.0 \n83.0 \n\nAverage Roughnessa \n(m/km) \n  16.0 \n  19.0 \n  17.0 \n\n   km = kilometer, m = meter. \n\n \n                          a International Roughness Index. \n                  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n2. \n\nTraffic Volume \n\n3. \nTraffic  volume  on  the  sample  roads  was  measured  at  various  locations.  Each  traffic \ncount  was  taken  for  three  days  for  a  12-hour  period.  Origin\u2013destination  counts  were  also \nundertaken  at  some  traffic  survey  stations.  These  survey  results  were  normalized  through  the \napplication  of  seasonal  factors  to  obtain  annual  average  daily  traffic  for  the  base  year.  The \ntraffic  counts  were  split  into  seven  vehicle  categories:  (i)  car/jeep/pickups,  (ii)  light  bus,  (iii) \nheavy bus, (iv) light truck, (v) heavy truck, (vi) tractor, and (vii) motorcycles. Traffic volumes on \nthe  sample  roads  ranged  from  27  to  168  vehicles  per  day.  The  average  traffic  composition \nshowed that there were approximately 60% passenger vehicles and 40% freight vehicles.  \n\n3.  \n\nTraffic Growth Rate Assumptions \n\n4. \n\nTraffic growth rates were based on  an analysis of various parameters.  Gross domestic \n\n \n\n\f \n \n \nproduct (GDP) growth was examined and future growth was estimated.1 The income elasticity of \ntransport demand was used to determine the traffic growth rate for each vehicle category. The \ntraffic  growth  rates  adopted  varied  between  4%to10%  per  annum  depending  on  vehicle  type \nand  year.  Based  on  the  average  vehicle  composition  for  the  sample  roads,  the  overall  growth \nrate is about 6% for 2005\u20132011, 8% for 2012\u20132021, and 7% beyond 2021.  \n\nAppendix 12 \n \n  \n\n53 \n \n\nC. \n\nCosts \n\nEconomic costs were derived from financial costs and include cost of construction, and \n5. \noperation and maintenance (O&M). Economic costs exclude price contingencies, taxes, duties, \nand  interest  during  construction.  A  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.90  was  calculated  and \napplied to the financial costs of non-traded inputs to calculate economic prices. A shadow wage \nrate  factor  (SWRF)  of  0.70  was  used  to  obtain  the  economic  costs  of  unskilled  labor.  The \nsample  roads  are  expected  to  have  an  average  economic  life  of  20  years.  Incremental  O&M \ncosts  were  calculated  as  the  difference  between  the  maintenance  requirements  for  the \nproposed  new  roads  and  the  existing  road.  In  both  the  without-  and  with-project  scenarios, \nroutine maintenance and periodic surface renewal will be required.  \n\nD. \n\nBenefits \n\nThe upgraded sample roads will allow improved traffic flow, higher vehicle speeds, and \n6. \nshorter  travel  times.  The  major  economic  benefits  to  the  users  of  the  sample  roads  were \nquantified in terms of (i) VOC savings arising from a reduction in the operating cost of vehicles \ncaused  by  improvement  in  the  road  surface  condition,  and  (ii)  time  savings  resulting  from \nshorter trips along each of the sample roads. Typical VOCs of various vehicle types based on \nthe existing surface roughness and the opening year surface roughness of the improved roads \nare in Table A12.2. The rate of road deterioration used in the analysis is based on the IRIs that \nexisted before the sample roads are implemented compared with IRIs in the with-project case. \nThe calculation of VOCs because of the road improvement is calculated.  \n\nTable A12.2:  Vehicle Operating Costs \n(NRs/km) \n\nVehicle Type \n\nCar \nLight Bus \nHeavy Bus \nLight Truck \nHeavy Truck \nTractor \nMotorcycle \n\nWithout \nProject \n(IRI=17) \n17.13 \n15.74 \n26.21 \n18.77 \n28.17 \n8.71 \n3.39 \n\nWith \nProject \n(IRI=4) \n11.40 \n10.12 \n19.72 \n12.88 \n20.85 \n5.88 \n2.24 \n\n \n \n\n \n                        Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n          IRI = International Roughness Index, km = kilometer. \n\nBenefits  also  accrue  to  generated  traffic  that  is  currently  deferred  from  using  the  road \n7. \nbecause  of  poor  conditions.

The  following  were  estimated:  (i)  how \nmuch of the Project\u2019s benefits for each vehicle category in the analysis will be passed on to the \nvehicle  user,  and  (ii)  the  ownership  of  each  vehicle  category.  Field  surveys  were  undertaken \nalong the sample roads; and passengers, drivers, and farmers were interviewed in each district. \nThese surveys yielded a series of assumptions about what will be passed on to the user of the \nservices. The  poverty  impact  ratio  was  estimated  by  determining  how  much  of  the  benefits  to \neach class of user are passed on to the poor. \n\n14. \nThe estimated direct benefits to the economy in present value (PV) terms for the sample \nroads as a whole are in Table A12.6, using a discount rate of 12%. These simply represent the \nsum  of  the  PV  of  benefits  to  passengers,  freight  users,  vehicle  owners,  and  the  Government. \nThe poverty impact ratio for the sample roads as a whole is 0.44. The estimated direct benefits \nof  the  sample  roads  are  NRs2,244.7  million,  in  PV  terms,  representing  the  sum  of  the  PV  of \nbenefits to passengers, freight users, vehicle owners, and the Government. The net benefit to \nthe economy as a whole is NRs882.9 million. These are conservative estimates, because only \ndirect benefits have been considered.  \n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n2   As some of the projects capital expenditure and maintenance costs will be spent on local labor, unskilled laborers \n\nwill gain net benefits to the extent that their paid wages are higher than their opportunity cost of labor.   \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n5\n6\n \n \n \n \n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n2\n \n\ni\n\nTable A12.6: Distribution of Net Benefits and Poverty Impact Ratio \n(NRs million)  \n\nFinancial \nPresent \nValue \n\nEconomic \nPresent \nValue \n\nEconomic \nMinus \nFinancial \n\n \nPassenger \nUsers \n\n \nFreight \nUsers \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n0.0 \n\n2,244.7 \n\n2,244.7 \n\n415.6 \n\n559.2 \n\n \nVehicle \nOwners \n \n \n\n1,228.7 \n\n \nLabor \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \nGov/ \nEconomy\n \n \n\n41.1 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n(1,187.8) \n(25.0) \n(502.9) \n \n(1,715.7) \n \n\n \n \n(987.1) \n(22.7) \n(352.0) \n \n882.9 \n \n\n \n \n200.7 \n2.3 \n150.9 \n \n2,598.6 \n \n\n                Gains and Losses \n               Proportion of the Poor (%) \n                Net Benefits for the Poor \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n415.6 \n \n415.6 \n50.0 \n207.8 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n559.2 \n \n559.2 \n50.0 \n279.6 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n1,228.7 \n \n1,228.7 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n\n \n \n \n \n150.9 \n \n150.9 \n \n150.9 \n80.0 \n120.7 \n \n\n \n \n200.7 \n2.3 \n \n \n244.1 \n \n(1,471.6) \n15.0 \n(220.7) \n\nPoverty Impact Ratio\n\n \n \nNet \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n882.9 \n \n385.9 \n \n0.44 \n\nItem \n\n \nBenefits \nRoad \nUser  \n \nCost \nCapital  \nO&M \nLabor \n \nNPV \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nO&M = operation and maintenance, NPV = net present value. \nNote: The net loss to Government/economy (-1,471.6) is calculated as -1,715.7 + 244.1. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n \n  \n\n57 \n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \n\n \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?  \n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\nIs the sector identified as a \nnational priority in country poverty \npartnership agreement?   \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Nepal: \n\n \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\nOne  of  the  main  reasons  for  the  persistence  of  poverty  is  the  lack  of  access  to  market  centers  and \ngovernment  services  (such  as  education  and  healthcare),  and  economic/employment  opportunities\u2014\ncaused by poor road condition or lack of roads. The physical exclusion created by such lack of access is \nalso responsible for social exclusion of the poor and other residents in remote areas. In this context, the \nProject is primarily aimed at (i) improving the existing roads to improve the movement of people, goods, \nand  services;  and  (ii)  linking  various  important  trade/tourist/production  centers  and  places  so  that \neconomic activities increase and people, especially in excluded and poverty-stricken places, get access to \nmarket and other essential services. The project is expected to (i) improve access of primary producers, \nsuch  as  farmers,  to  market  centers  where  they  can  get  higher  prices  for  their  high  value  perishable \nproducts;  (ii) improve  people\u2019s  mobility  so  that  they  can  access  employment  opportunities  outside  the \ncommunity;  (iii)  improve  access  to  social  services  such  as  education  and  health;  and  (iv)  reduce  travel \ntime  cost. Therefore,  by  removing  physical  barriers  through  road  networks and  improving  the  policy  and \ninstitutional  capacity,  the  Project  will  improve  the  overall  performance  of  the  road  sector\u2014leading  to \nreduction in poverty. The proposed roads under the Project pass through poverty-stricken areas and link \ntrade,  production,  and  marketing  centers  and  other  locations  of  economic  activities  and  socioeconomic \nservices. Therefore, the Project will contribute toward poverty reduction. \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis \n\nTargeting Classification:  General intervention \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n\nThe  proposed  project  covers  17  out  of  Nepal\u2019s  75  districts.  The  project  districts  are  located  mostly  in \nmidwestern hills, central hills, western Terai, and eastern hill regions. The districts covered by the Project \nare  considered  to  be  poor  districts,  except  for  some  roads  which  are  included  because  they  lead  to  the \nnorth\u2013south  connection  of  trade  routes  and  linkage  to  district  headquarters,  also  contributing  to  poverty \nreduction.  \n\nAccording  to  the  2004  Nepal  Living  Standard  Survey  (NLSS)  II,  these  are  the  regions  where  poverty \nincidence is still high\u2014ranging from 37.4% to 42.9% compared with the national average of 30.8%. Most \nof these districts are also considered food insecure districts. Transportation has been difficult because of \nthe poor quality of roads and, in some cases, lack of roads. It has been difficult to supply food in time of \nneed because of increased transportation costs, and people living in these regions have not been able to \nsell agricultural produce to neighboring markets.   \n\nA  socioeconomic  survey  was  conducted  in  three  sample  roads  (covering  seven  districts)  with  466 \nhouseholds  selected  randomly  in  the  roads\u2019  direct  impact  zone.  Considering  the  national  poverty  line \ndefined  by  NLSS  (NRs7695.7  per  capita  income  per  year  or  $110),  49.4%  of  the  sampled  households \nwere under the poverty line. NLSS also specified a poverty line for different regions. Three roads are in the \n\u201crural eastern hills\u201d where a poverty line has been fixed at NRs8,069.6 ($115). Considering this regional \npoverty line, 51.3% of the sample households were found to be below the poverty line. This study shows \nslightly  higher  poverty  incidence  in  the  districts  covered  by  the  Project  compared  with  NLSS  II\u2019s  result \n(42.9% below poverty) for this region. This shows that within the eastern rural hills, districts covered by the \nProject are poorer than the regional average.  \n\nDuring the survey, the majority of primary stakeholders acknowledged the positive impacts of the various \nelements  of  the  Project.  In  particular,  improved  roads  and  better  connectivity  will  enable  farmers  to  sell \nagricultural produce to neighboring markets and grow larger marketable surpluses. This will provide more \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nagricultural wage employment, particularly benefiting the poor. \n\nThe  Project  will  also  create  employment  opportunities  for  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  during  its \nimplementation.  Unskilled  labor  will  be  employed  directly  in  road  construction,  rehabilitation,  and \nmaintenance;  and  indirectly  in  providing  materials  and  services  for  contractors.  The  Project  will  enable \nreliable  access  to  social  services,  particularly  health  care  services,  education  facilities,  and  supply  of \ndrinking  water.  The  direct  (access  to  services  and  market)  and  indirect  benefits  (employment)  of  the \nProject  will  help  to  reduce  poverty  and  improve  the  quality  of  life  of  people  in  these  poverty-stricken \ndistricts. The poverty impact ratio (the proportions of net benefits likely to accrue to the poor) of the sample \nroads is estimated at 0.44, indicating that substantial benefits are expected to go to the poor. \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n\n  Yes \n\n  No \n\nIs there a participation strategy? \n\n  Yes \n\n  No \n\nDuring  project  preparation,  stakeholder  meetings  were  held  both  at  the  institutional  level  in  Kathmandu \nand  with  the  community  and  related  agencies  in  the  districts  and  communities.  Meeting  and  group \ndiscussions  were  held,  and  concerns  and  suggestions  were  taken  into  account.  The  meetings  ensured \nparticipation  of  representatives  from  all  socioeconomic  groups  in  the  community.  Small  meetings  and \nfocused  group  discussions  were  also  held  exclusively  with  vulnerable  groups  comprising  women,  the \ndisadvantaged, and indigenous people. \n\nThe  Project  was  developed  based  on  consultation  with  possible  stakeholders  such  as  government \nagencies,  the  private  sector,  chamber  of  commerce,  civil  society,  the  contractor\u2019s  association,  transport \nassociations, communities, indigenous people and their associations, and women and their associations. \nThe participation of stakeholders in the implementation of the Project has been further emphasized. The \npossibility of including the community\u2014particularly the poor, women, and indigenous people\u2014in the road \nconstruction/improvement has been incorporated. Communities were also consulted to reduce the adverse \nimpacts of the Project in terms of resettlement impact.  \n \nTo  understand  the  concerns  of  people  and  various stakeholders in  the  three  sample  roads,  participatory \ndiscussions  and  studies  (such  as  focus  group  discussions,  social  mapping,  and  key  informant  surveys) \nwere  held  in  seven  districts.  Project  affected  communities,  local  leaders,  women,  indigenous  people, \ntraders,  transport  companies,  laborers,  porters,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  civil  society \nmembers, and government agencies were consulted to understand (i) how they felt about the advantages \nand disadvantages of the roads; (ii) how they were going to be negatively affected; (iii) how that could be \nreduced or mitigated; and (iv) how local people, especially the poor, women, and indigenous people, could \nparticipate  in  the  Project.  The  Project\u2019s  beneficiaries  unanimously  expressed  the  need  for  the  Project \nprimarily  because  of  its  socioeconomic  benefits.  They  also  made  suggestions  with  regard  to  local \ncommunities\u2019 participation in the Project, especially in form of employment. The creation of work through \nthe Project and employment will reduce the need to out-migrate for cash income.  \n\nD.  Gender and Development \n\nThe  Project  will  have  no  negative  gender  impacts.  The  Project  will  benefit  both  men  and  women  by \nproviding  them  with  direct  construction  employment  opportunities,  easier  access  to  markets,  better \ndelivery of services, improved social facilities, and improved access to better quality health care facilities \nand higher education. Focus group discussions with women and communities revealed that the majority of \nrespondents supported the construction of the roads The civil work contracts will include legally mandated \nprovisions  for  health;  sanitation;  and  appropriate  working  conditions,  including  accommodation,  where \nappropriate, for construction workers at campsites during the construction period. The Project will ensure \nthat  civil  works  contractors  comply  with  all  applicable  labor  laws,  including  elimination  of  gender-\ndifferentiated wages; and people (men and women) directly affected by the Project will be given priority to \nbe employed by the Project. Contractors must not vary the wages of men and women employed for work \nof equal value. A specific clause will be included in the bidding documents, and compliance will be strictly \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n \n  \n\n59 \n \n\nmonitored  during  project  implementation.  There are  potential  risks  of  HIV/AIDS  and  women/children \ntrafficking  threats  that may  be  aggravated by  the  increased  connectivity of  the  project  areas. To  address \nthis, a separate HIV/AIDS prevention and anti-trafficking program will be undertaken in the project areas. \n\nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n  No \n\nE.

The  roads  pass  mostly  through  rural \nareas  and  markets  where  settlements  lying  along  the \nroad are thinly populated rural dwellings. An estimated \n212 households and 1,055 persons will be affected by \nthe  three  sample  roads. A  total  of  205  structures  will \nbe  affected,  comprising  91  residential  structures,  31 \ncommercial,  70 \nresidential-cum-commercial;  13 \nstructures residential and commercial are occupied by \ntenants.  In  addition,  7  households  will  be  affected  by \nloss  of  agricultural  land.  Other  impacts  will  include \nloss of community structure comprising 32 community \ntaps  and  loss  of  incomes  and  livelihoods  of  tenants \nand  employees.  One  full  resettlement  plan  and  two \nshort  resettlement  plans  (RPs)  for  three  sample \nsubprojects  have  been  prepared  to  mitigate  the \nimpacts. \n\nA  resettlement  framework  (Supplementary  Appendix \nK)  has  been  prepared  for  the  remaining  non-sample \nsubprojects. In accordance with the framework, an RP \nfor  each  non-sample  road  will  be  prepared  by  the \nDepartment  of  Roads  (DOR)  and  submitted  to  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) for approval. \n\nThe  development  of  the  roads  will  reduce  transport \ncosts and increase the mobility of the local population \nin the project areas. \n\nfor \n\nemployment \n\nopportunities \n\nNo  job  losses  will  occur.  The  Project  is  expected  to \ngenerate \nlocal \ncommunities during the construction and maintenance \nphase.  DOR  will  ensure  that  the  contracts  for  civil \nworks  require  contractors  (i)  not  to  employ  or  use \nchildren  for  labor;  and  (ii)  to  follow  and  implement \nlegally mandated provisions on labor (including equal \npay  for  equal  work),  health,  safety,  sanitation,  and \nworking conditions. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f Yes \n\n  No \n\n(Specific \nActions) \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nConsultations were made with ethnic groups and local \norganizations to understand their views on the Project. \nSome  ethnic  groups  identified  by  the  Government \nwere  found  in  the  three  sample  roads. Among  them, \nthe  key  ethnic  groups  present  are  Danuwar  (locally \nknown  as  Kala  Rai),  and  Majhi.  However,  the  initial \nassessment  and \nthese  groups \nrevealed that they would not be impacted differentially \nfrom  the  rest  of  the  population  and  would  benefit \nequally from the socioeconomic opportunities created \nby the Project. Adequate provisions have been made \nin  the  RPs  to  provide  assistance  to  such  households \nand specific provisions have been included. \n\ninteractions  with \n\nIn  addition,  an  indigenous  people\u2019s  development \nframework  has  been  prepared  for  the  Project,  which \nwill  be  used  as  a  guideline  for  the  preparation  of  an \nindigenous  people\u2019s  development  program  for  non-\nsample  roads,  if  indigenous  people  are  significantly \naffected. \n\nThe  Project  is  likely  to  raise  some  risks  related  to \nHIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking,  primarily  as  a  result \nof improved mobility of the people as well as influx of \nlabor at the time of the construction. However, as local \npeople will be given priority for employment, there will \nbe  less  chance  of  outsiders  coming  in  and  local \npeople going out for work, which will significantly help \nreduce \nis \nconsidered  important  to  make  people  (especially \nvulnerable  groups  like  women  and  children  from \npoorer  families)  aware  of  these  risks. An  action  plan \nhas  been  prepared  with  the  objective  of  increasing \npromotional/awareness activities (through local NGOs \nand  other  agencies)  related  to  HIV/AIDS  prevention \nand human trafficking. \n\nthe  risks.
