Solomon  Islands  is  largely  rural  with  85%  of  its  population  of \n652,000  living  in  villages  in  nine  provinces  spread  across  20  islands.  Income-generating \nopportunities are scarce and predominantly based on natural resources\u2014fisheries, forestry, and \nmining.  Providing  infrastructure  and  services  to  this  dispersed  population  is  difficult  and  costly \nand  helps  constrain business  and investment growth.  Although  poverty  has  declined in recent \nyears, Solomon Islands has the lowest gross national income per  capita among ADB\u2019s Pacific \ndeveloping member countries.4 \n \n4. \nSuccessive reformist governments since 2006 have improved PFM practices, made fiscal \npolicy  sustainable,  and  increased  investment  levels.  This  along  with  robust  economic  growth, \nincluding an average of 3.0% per annum during 2015\u20132017, resulted in per capita incomes almost \ndoubling since the global financial crisis.5 However, economic problems remain. First, the country \ncontinues  to  exhibit  characteristics  of  a  fragile  state.  The  government  has  limited  reach  and \neffectiveness, its economic policy needs to be actively managed, and the country is vulnerable to \nshocks  such  as  civil  unrest  and  natural  disasters. 6  Second,  unsustainable  logging,  which \naccounted for about 17% of domestic revenue and two-thirds of exports in 2017, has been the \nbiggest driver of growth, and it is expected to decline over the medium term (footnote 4). Third, \nannual population growth of about 2.3% means high levels of economic growth are required to \ncontinue per capita income growth. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the main \nmacroeconomic  challenges  facing  policy  makers  in  Solomon  Islands  are  the  need  to  improve \naccess to basic services, strengthen resilience, and generate new sources of economic growth.7 \nThese economic challenges coupled with significant government capacity constraints to develop \nand implement policy effectively, make reform challenging and requiring significant development \npartner support. \n                                                \n1  The  program is  included  in  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2017.

According  to  the  World  Bank, \n\nSolomon Islands is ranked the fourth most vulnerable country to natural disasters among the Pacific islands. \n\n7  IMF. 2018. Solomon Islands 2017 Article IV Consultation Staff Report. Washington, DC. \n\n\fIn  the  wake  of  the  global  financial  crisis  in  2009,  the  government  and  development \n5. \npartners established the Core Economic Working Group (CEWG) to develop a joint framework \nfor mitigating the impacts of the crisis and building resilience to future shocks.8 The CEWG now \ncoordinates the government and development partners on policy reform priorities associated with \nbudget  support.  The  framework,  called  the  policy  reform  matrix,  includes  a  list  of  high-priority \nreform actions from the National Development Strategy (NDS) that will help achieve the country\u2019s \nvision of improving the social and economic livelihoods of all Solomon Islanders.9 ADB helped the \ngovernment  achieve  the  following  reforms  between  2010  and  2015:  (i)  the  establishment  of  a \nBudget Strategy Committee to  improve interagency coordination; (ii) regular consultations with \ncivil  society  organizations,  including  women\u2019s  groups,  on  the  national  budget  to  improve \ncommunity awareness and strengthen budget accountability and transparency; (iii) the adoption \nof a new debt management strategy to improve overall fiscal discipline; and (iv) the amendment \nof the Registration of Business Names Act to facilitate improved processes for registering formal \nbusinesses.10 \n \n6. \nFollowing the November 2014 general election, the country\u2019s fiscal position deteriorated \nbecause of changes in government priorities, a waning commitment to the CEWG process, and \nreform  slippage.  After  several  years  of  surpluses,  fiscal  deficits  emerged  during  2015\u20132017 \n(Table 1). The buildup of cash reserves were drawn down to finance the fiscal expansion.11 The \nlow cash balance fell from 3.6 months of recurrent spending at  the end of 2015 to 0.7 months \nat  the  end  of  2017.  This  was  below  the  2-month  target  of  total  recurrent  expenditure \nrecommended by the IMF, and reduces the government\u2019s fiscal buffers against shocks. Public \ndebt also increased to finance infrastructure investments although the 2017 IMF\u2013World Bank \nDebt  Sustainability  Analysis  concluded  that  the  risk  of  debt  distress  remained  moderate \n(footnote 7). \n \n7. \nSince the leadership changed in November 2017, policy dialogue has resumed through \nthe CEWG and reform momentum has increased.12 The government has made a concerted effort \nto reestablish macroeconomic and fiscal stability by targeting lower budget deficits in 2018 and \n2019. 13 Its  fiscal  consolidation  program  is  a  positive  step.  Although  the  capital  development \nbudget  almost  halved from  11.8% to 6.5%  of gross domestic  product  in  the  2018  budget,  it  is \nunlikely to have substantial adverse economic growth impacts because the development budget \nis perennially under spent.14 Delays in government payments have also had flow-on effects to the \nprivate sector, particularly businesses with government supply contracts.  \n \n8. \nTherefore,  the  government  is  keen  to  prioritize  reforms  that  strengthen  public  sector \nmanagement and service delivery. These objectives are consistent with the (i) first objective of \nthe NDS (sustained and inclusive economic growth); (ii) ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020 and \n\n                                                \n8  The CEWG is comprised of the Ministry of Finance and Treasury, the Ministry of Development Planning and Aid \nCoordination, the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, the governments of Australia and New Zealand, ADB, the World Bank, and \nthe European Union. \n\n9  Government of Solomon Islands. 2016.

The  deterioration  of  the  fiscal \nposition  between  2015  and  2017,  accompanied  by  a  rise  in  expenditure  arrears,  reflects \nchallenges  in  PFM.  In  June  2018,  an  IMF  review  of  the  PFM  Reform  Roadmap,  2014\u20132017 \nrecommended actions to strengthen overall PFM integrity. The Ministry of Finance and Treasury \n(MOFT) has good policies and processes to implement the PFM Act (2013) as envisaged, but the \nfocus  is  to  institutionalize  these  existing  good  practices  by  enacting  regulations  under  this  act \n(e.g.,  ensuring  all  projects  that  require  debt  financing  include  an  economic  analysis  so  that \nmacroeconomic and debt level implications can be assessed). \n \n10. \nEradicating  corruption  is  also  a  critical  element  of  the  government\u2019s  PFM  agenda. \nHowever,  key  mechanisms  to  perform  checks  and  balances  on  executive  powers  are  lacking, \nespecially  in  relation  to  accountability  measures  for  public  office  holders  and  civil  servants. \nCombating  corruption  is  spread  across  various  institutions,  and  this  diffused  approach  has \nweakened anticorruption efforts and contributed to persistent corruption. The Leadership Code \nCommission within the Office of the Prime Minister has a legislative mandate to inquire into the \nconduct of public servants and officers of public agencies, but it has been ineffective. Meanwhile, \nthe ombudsperson, established to deal with maladministration, commenced its operations in 2018. \nThe government recognizes that measures  to improve transparency,  strengthen anticorruption \npractices, and protect persons who report instances of corruption in good faith and on reasonable \n\n                                                \n15 ADB.  2016.

Widening fiscal deficits and the reduced \n2018 development budget in the context of projected declining logging revenues underscore the \nneed to prioritize better expenditure and make careful fiscal adjustments in 2018 and 2019. Fiscal \nbuffers are low, with the cash balance below IMF\u2019s target (footnote 7). Regarding expenditure, \npayment  arrears  have  reemerged.  Greater  restraint  is  also  needed  for  discretionary  recurrent \nexpenditures on Parliamentarian tertiary scholarships and shipping grants, which are all disbursed \nthrough Members of Parliament. Although these programs aim to provide public services unmet \nby  the  government  to  the  rural  population,  there  needs  to  be  greater  accountability  and \ntransparency  in  their  use,  particularly  in  assessing  their  development  impact.  Tertiary \nscholarships and shipping grants, for example, increased as a share of the development budget \nfrom 1.7% to 5.1% between 2014 and 2017. Government debt levels are sustainable and debt \nservicing levels are affordable, but the downside risks are high (footnote 7). \n  \nIn July 2018, a $28.9 million supplementary budget was approved by Parliament to finance \n12. \nadditional expenditure on items identified as being omitted from the 2018 budget. In line with the \ngovernment\u2019s  fiscal  consolidation  efforts,  line  ministries  were  advised  that  new  or  additional \nexpenditures would be accommodated only if there was a commensurate increase in revenues. \nIn  addition,  expenditure  arrears  and  all  legitimate  contractual  commitments  and  ongoing  fixed \ncosts would be prioritized. In this context, the IMF recommended that the government focus on \nmeasures to rebuild the cash balance, strengthen tax compliance, streamline exemptions, and \nclear expenditure arrears (footnote 15). \n \n13. \nIncreased  private  sector  investment.  The  country  needs  increased  private  sector \ninvestment,  particularly  investment  that  will  diversify  the  economy,  to  grow  the  formal  private \nsector to address employment and income challenges.16 The government plays an important role \nin establishing an investment climate where private businesses can thrive. The NDS includes the \nfollowing  reform  priorities:  (i)  encourage  greater  private  sector  involvement  in  delivering \ninfrastructure services; (ii) undertake a comprehensive review of the tax system that encourages \ndomestic  and  foreign  investment;  and  (iii)  encourage  efforts  that  facilitate  business  access  to \nfinance,  in  particular,  by  developing  new  products  to  enable  greater  moveable  asset-based \nlending using the secured transaction registry. ADB-supported reforms between 2010 and 2017 \nto  enhance  the  business  environment  and  improve  private  sector  investment  included \nstreamlining  foreign  investment  processes,  reforming  business  laws,  and  improving  the \ngovernance and commercial performance of state-owned enterprises.17 \n \n14. \nDespite positive growth forecasts (Table 1), there are still many challenges to encouraging \nthe private sector to grow. Policy development processes to achieve effective investment climate \nreforms are fragmented; infrastructure projects need rigorous economic analysis to ensure scarce \npublic  funds  achieve  the  greatest  returns;  investments  in  education,  particularly  vocational \neducation and skills training, need increasing; and the financial sector needs to facilitate greater \naccess  to  finance.  Specifically,  an  impediment  is  that  the  tax  structure  is  outdated,  inefficient, \ncomplex, expensive to administer, and anticompetitive. The tax system imposes high compliance \ncosts  on  taxpayers;  discourages  people  from  becoming  taxpayers,  particularly  women;  and \nencourages tax  avoidance  and  evasion.  Importantly,  the  tax  system  does  not  actively  support \n\n                                                \n16 ADB. 2017. Technical Assistance to Solomon Islands for Private Sector Assessment.

The IMF has stated that the government\u2019s focus \non tax reform will help to significantly improve the investment climate by making the tax system \nmore efficient, fair, and equitable (footnote 15). More generally, the economy is uncompetitive, \nand policy and regulatory settings do not encourage competition, the protection of consumers, or \nthe economic empowerment of women. Finally, Solomon Islands has a narrow economic base \nwith an overdependence on unsustainable logging. The economic base needs to be broadened \nto  reduce  reliance  on  the  forestry  sector  and  to  make  the  economy  more  resilient  to  external \nshocks. The government believes that the minerals sector has the greatest potential to manage \nthe transition away from unsustainable logging. However, several challenges, such as the lack of \ntransparency in issuing mining licenses, disclosing revenues, and applying fiscal incentives, need \nto be effectively addressed. \n \nB. \n \n15. \nThe first ADB mission to start policy dialogue for this program took place in September \n2017.  However,  the  resumption  of  the  CEWG  in  January  2018  increased  momentum.  The \ngovernment  and  development  partners  agreed on  three  strategic  themes  (strengthening  PFM, \nimproving fiscal management  and sustainability,  and  enabling  drivers  of economic growth and \npromoting investment) that would provide the basis for reform priorities to be supported by policy-\nbased operations.18 These are all areas of long-standing ADB policy engagement (footnote 2). \nThe  program  has  completed  the  implementation  of  eight  reforms  critical  to  addressing  the \ndevelopment challenges. \n \nReform area 1: Public financial management. A policy priority of MOFT is to improve \n16. \nbudget  outcomes  and  increase transparency  by  strengthening  PFM.  Coupled  with  institutional \nreforms  to fight  corruption  and  protect  whistleblowers,  this  will  help  protect  the  integrity  of  the \nnational budget and work towards transforming policy priorities into improved service delivery.  \n \n17.  MOFT completed the review of the PFM Reform Roadmap, 2014\u20132017 in August 2018, \nand the Minister of Finance and Treasury endorsed the PFM Action Plan, 2019\u20132020 based on \nthe outcomes of the review. The action plan reflects the government\u2019s most urgent priorities in \nline  with  IMF\u2019s  recommendations  to  (i)  improve  budget  credibility,  (ii)  implement  commitment \ncontrols, (iii) institutionalize a comprehensive approach to cash management, (iv) clear all existing \nexpenditure arrears while executing the 2018 budget, and (v) support greater accountability of \ndiscretionary  funds. 19  MOFT  has  also  developed  a  new  regulation  for  improving  debt \nmanagement that came into force in September 2018. This regulation describes the process to \nraise new debt and will help ensure limited debt funding finances those projects with the greatest \nreturns to the country. MOFT is working to further strengthen PFM processes by developing an \nadditional  eight  regulations  under  the  PFM  Act  (2013)  to  provide  more  detailed  operational \nguidance  on  PFM  practices  such  as  the  budget  process,  management  of  public  funds,  and \nprocurement.  \n \n18. \nThe government\u2019s commitment to anticorruption is evidenced by the successful passing \nof legislation such as the Anti-Corruption Act (2018) and the Whistle-Blower Protection Act (2018). \nAmong other things, these acts will establish the Anti-Corruption Independent Commission, which \nwill  have  the  ability  to  investigate  and  prosecute  corruption,  build  capacity  for  corruption  risk \nassessments,  develop  a clear  code  of  conduct for  public  office  holders and civil  servants,  and \n\n                                                \n18 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of the linked documents Appendix 2). \n19 IMF. 2018.

The  United \nNations  Pacific  Regional  Anti-Corruption  Program  supported  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to \ndevelop these bills and ensure they meet international obligations and are relevant to the \nlocal context.20 \n \n19. \nReform area 2: Fiscal sustainability. In line with IMF\u2019s policy advice (footnote 7), MOFT \nis committed to strengthening the country\u2019s resilience to shocks. This program enabled increases \nin revenues, reduced expenditure and started rebuilding fiscal buffers.  \n \n20.  MOFT  certified  that  expenditure  arrears  totaling  $17.8  million  in  2017  have  been  paid. \nThese arrears to private sector contractors were for public works. The nonpayment of invoices \nwhen  they  are  due  has  implications  for  firms  and  may  discourage  them  from  taking  future \ngovernment  contracts.  However,  some  arrears  have  built  up  again  in  2018,  and  MOFT  has \nconfirmed that all outstanding arrears will be paid by the end of 2018. MOFT has asked for TA to \nimprove cash management to help prevent arrears in the future. \n\n \nOverall domestic revenue levels (excluding budget support) have increased by 4.8% on a \n21. \nyear-on-year basis led by increased logging, improved compliance, and annual updates of excise \ntaxes.  According  to  MOFT  modelling,  amendments  to  the  Goods  Tax  Act  and  reforms  to  the \nadministration of withholding taxes will result in additional annual revenues of $5.1 million. The \nGoods Tax Act amendments will ensure that imported goods are taxed on the value of the goods \nthrough  a  prescribed  formula,  which  is  in  line  with  international  practice.  The  withholding  tax \nreforms  help  to  ensure  that  activities  that  fall  outside  the  pay-as-you-earn  system,  such  as \nprofessional  services,  are  captured  in  the  tax  net.  Similarly,  according  to  MOFT  modelling, \nincreases  in  excise  taxes  collected  on  alcohol  and  tobacco  will  result  in  additional  annual \nrevenues of $1.9 million. In the consultations conducted, the Solomon Islands Women in Business \nAssociation was included to understand the implications for women-owned businesses. \n \nConcerted action has reduced overall public expenditure from $516.8 million in 2017 to \n22. \n$507.1 million in 2018.21 Discretionary expenditure was reduced by 86% on new Parliamentarian \ntertiary scholarship awards and by 84% on shipping grants. The 2019 budget strategy goes further \nand proposes to remove both programs in line with the government\u2019s fiscal consolidation efforts. \nThese policies are in line with the IMF\u2019s recommendations (para. 6). \n\n \n23. \nReform area 3: Private sector investment climate. Solomon Islands needs increased \nprivate  sector  investment  that  will  diversify  the  economy  to  address  employment  and  income \nchallenges. The program has enabled a tax review to start, new policies introduced to broaden \nthe productive base, and a new policy to encourage greater competition in the economy. \n \n24.  MOFT has begun a comprehensive review of the tax system with a view to raising revenue \nin an economically efficient way without discouraging individuals and businesses from contributing \nto  the  national  economy  by  working,  earning  income,  saving,  and  investing.  The  Minister  of \nFinance and Treasury launched the review with discussion documents in November 2017, and \nthese are available for review on  MOFT\u2019s website.  The Cabinet also approved the time-bound \nwork plan for review and consultations, which have commenced, including with women groups \nsuch as the Solomon Islands Women in Business Association. Consultations with women groups \nare important to understand the impact potential reforms will have on women, and adjustments \ncan be made as necessary. MOFT is preparing early drafts of bills, and is targeting bills to be \n\n                                                \n20 Solomon Islands acceded the United Nations Convention on Corruption on 6 January 2012. \n21 Government of Solomon Islands. 2018. 2019 Budget Strategy and Operational Rules.

However, regulation of the sector is weak and current logging volumes\u2014estimated at \n2.7 million cubic meters in 2017\u2014far exceed the sustainable threshold of 350,000 cubic meters. \nThe sustainable forestry policy outlines how current regulations will be better enforced; targets a \nreduction  in  export  volumes;  encourages  sustainable  harvesting  and  forestry  rehabilitation, \nincluding the enforcement of environmental impact assessments; minimizes the misclassification \nof round logs exports; and promotes downstream processing. In addition, to minimize the impact \nof  the  transition  to  lowering  logging  exports,  the  government  has  adopted  a  National  Minerals \nPolicy  that  positions  mining  as  a  new  driver  of  growth.  According  to  the  World  Bank,  mining \nappears to be the only sector with any prospect of filling the macroeconomic space occupied by \nlogging.22 The policy helps achieve this by providing a more certain regulatory environment for \nmining and outlining activities to strengthen institutional capacity for Ministry of Mines staff. \n \nThe Cabinet approved the competition and consumer policy in August 2018 that covers \n26. \nissues such as international best practice principles, government business activities, consumer \nprotection,  competition  law,  institutional  arrangements,  and  international  trade.  The  main \nobjective of the competition and consumer policy is to promote competition in Solomon Islands\u2019 \nmarkets to support economic growth that is sustainable and inclusive. The next step is to examine \nlegislation and regulations to see  what reforms are needed to support a competitive economy. \nADB  will  support  this  work.  The  competition  and  consumer  policy  defines  inclusive  economic \ngrowth  as  economic  growth  that  reduces  poverty,  increases  employment  opportunities,  and \nensures  that  policies  and  practices  facilitate  women\u2019s  access  to  economic  resources  and \nopportunities. \n \n27. \nPost-program  partnership  framework.  The  policy  dialogue  process  made  clear  that, \nacross  the  reform  areas,  several  follow-up  reform  steps  will  be  crucial  and  could  benefit  from \nfurther  ADB  and  development  partner  support.  The  government  and  ADB  agreed  on  a  post-\nprogram partnership framework (PPPF) that would ensure that recently implemented reforms are \nimbedded, there is support for the next phase of associated and more substantive reforms, and \nensure the program\u2019s sustainability beyond 2018. A PPPF has been used successfully in other \nPacific developing member countries to provide the basis for ongoing policy dialogue in years that \nADB does not provide policy financing.23 The PPPF guides the government in sustaining efforts \nin  each  of  the  program  reform  areas,  and  MOFT  and  ADB  will  jointly  monitor  implementation. \nDetails of the PPPF actions are presented in Appendix 4. \n \n28. \nADB value addition. ADB\u2019s experience and strong relationship with the government has \nplayed  an  important  role  in  identifying  and  implementing  critical  reforms.  To  aid  reform \nimplementation  in  2018,  ADB  has  been  engaged  in  joint  analytical  work  and  policy  dialogue \nacross all reform areas and has directly supported the preparation of the PFM Action Plan, 2018\u2013\n2019; the tax policy framework review; and the development of a competition policy. ADB will also \ncontinue  to  support  reform  momentum  including  entrenching  completed  reforms,  program \nsustainability, and implementation of the PPPF through new and ongoing TA (footnotes 10 and \n17)  in  close  collaboration  with  other  development  partners. 24 The  TA  support  will  also  help \novercome the significant government capacity constraints which inhibits reform progress. \n\n                                                \n22 World Bank. 2017.

The program also reflects Strategy 2030 approach to fragile and conflict-affected \nsituations and small island developing states. Strategy 2030 requires ADB\u2019s support in fragile and \nconflict-affected  situations  to  focus  on  institutional  development  and  governance  reforms. \nSimilarly for small island developing states, Strategy 2030 emphasizes institutional strengthening \nto  support  countries\u2019  efforts  to  manage  financial  and  economic  risk;  improve  the  business \nenvironment;  strengthen  the  quality  of  public  service  delivery,  and  promote  private  sector-led \ngrowth.  \n \n30. \nDevelopment partner coordination. The program is fully integrated with the CEWG. The \nprogram is aligned with the policy operations of the governments of Australia and New Zealand, \nthe  European  Union,  and  the  World  Bank.  ADB  and  the  IMF  also  maintain  a  strong  working \nrelationship in Solomon Islands. Based on this cooperation, ADB, the World Bank, and the IMF \nshare a common view on the macroeconomic and structural reform priorities (footnote 15).25 \n \nC. \n \n31. \nThe  effect  of  the  reforms  that  the  program  has  helped  the  government  achieve  is \nstrengthened public sector management and service delivery. Policy actions implemented under \nthe first reform area will help improve the quality of budget systems and institutions. This supports \nthe expectation that the program\u2019s PFM reform actions will help the government maintain fiscal \ndeficits below IMF\u2019s recommended levels. Policy actions implemented under the second reform \narea provide the basis for improved budget execution, expenditure quality, and tax administration \nand compliance. In addition, new tax measures that were introduced have helped generate more \nrevenue, which will rebuild cash reserves and provide fiscal space to respond to shocks. Policy \nactions implemented under the third reform area will support the shift to an economy that is broad-\nbased, competitive, and encourages the participation of women in the economy and a tax system \nthat supports economic growth and is business friendly.26 \n \nD. \n \nThe  government  has  requested  a  grant  not  exceeding  $5.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \n32. \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the program. The World Bank, the \ngovernments of Australia and New Zealand, and the European Union will provide $16.4 million in \ncofinancing.27 The program will help the government meet its 2018 total financing requirements, \nwhich  are  estimated  at  $47.4  million  without  budget  support.  The  proposed  grant  size  was \ndetermined after considering the government\u2019s commitment to stronger fiscal management, the \ncountry\u2019s development financing needs, and the availability of financing from other development \npartners and sources. Without this program, parallel budget support programs from Australia and \nNew Zealand would be unlikely, and the fiscal position would be significantly worse. \n \n33. \nProgram  modality.  A  stand-alone,  policy-based  operation  is  proposed,  and  all  policy \nactions  have  been  completed.  A  policy-based  operation  is  appropriate  given  its  suitability  to \nimprove  the  policy  and  institutional  environment  for  enhanced  efficiency  in  public  sector \nmanagement,  its  use  of  resources,  and  the  government\u2019s  commitment  to  policy  reform  as \n                                                \n25 IMF Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of supplementary documents in Appendix 2). \n27 The European Union disbursed its budget support of \u20ac2.5 million in April 2018. The governments of Australia (A$2 \nmillion) and New Zealand (NZ$3 million) plan to disburse their contributions in the fourth quarter of 2018. The World \nBank plans to disburse its contribution ($10 million) in the second quarter of 2019. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fevidenced by the revival of the CEWG. A stand-alone modality is considered appropriate based \non a number of factors including (i) previous successful ADB operations in Solomon Islands using \nthis modality; (ii) all CEWG development partners used this approach; (iii) the strong incentive \nstructure for the new reformist government following a 2-year lapse of policy dialogue; (iv) with \nnational elections scheduled for early 2019, this modality is appropriate given the potential for a \nchange  in government;  and  (v)  leveraging  reform  when  the  political  environment  is  supportive \nrecognizes  the  country\u2019s  fragile  and  conflict-affected  status  and  the  need  to  build  resilience  to \nexternal  shocks.  The  potential  weakening  of  the  government  reform  commitment  in  2019  has \nbeen mitigated through a PPPF that contains long-standing reform priorities drawn from the NDS \n2016\u20132035, the demonstrated success of previous stand-alone programs that were negotiated \nwith previous governments, and new TA to support implementation of the PPPF (footnotes 9 and \n24). The program is aligned with a government-led, multi-partner reform effort.  \n \nE. \n \n34. \nThe program period is from September 2017 to December 2018. Program funding will be \nprovided as a single tranche grant of $5.0 million and will be withdrawn  when the government \nmeets the conditions for effectiveness. The proceeds of the policy-based grant will be disbursed \nin  accordance  with  the  ADB  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime).28 MOFT is the executing agency and one of the implementing agencies. The Office of the \nPrime Minister; the Ministry of Forestry and Research; the Ministry of Mines, Energy and Rural \nElectrification;  and  the  Ministry  of  Commerce,  Industry,  Labor  and  Immigration  will  also  be \nimplementing agencies.  \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n35. \nFollowing ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program is classified category C \nfor the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. No activity will result in or \nlead to involuntary resettlement or negatively affect indigenous peoples or the environment. \n \n36. \nThe program is classified effective gender mainstreaming. Although women and men are \nboth  active in the  labor force  in  almost  equal  numbers,  women  only  account for  3  of  every  10 \nwaged or salaried employees. Women tend to be employed in more informal and vulnerable types \nof work and, on average, earn 37% less in wages per year than men.29 There are many barriers \nto women\u2019s economic empowerment in Solomon Islands including the lack of parity in education, \nthe burden of unpaid care and housework, unequal decision-making power and limited control of \nfinancial resources, and challenges in accessing finance. The program supports the improvement \nof  gender  outcomes  across  all  three  reform  areas  and  will  support  women\u2019s  economic \nempowerment by (i) including a gender analysis and consultations with women organizations in \nthe tax review as well as a gender analysis in the PFM Action Plan, 2018\u20132019; (ii) approving a \ncompetition  policy  that  ensures  that  reviews  of  policies  and  practices  will  facilitate,  not  hinder, \nwomen\u2019s  access  to  economic resources  and  opportunities;  (iii)  approving  an  anticorruption  act \nthat supports an environment that is safe and fair for women to do business and ensures that at \nleast two out of the six members of the Independent Anticorruption Commission are women; and \n(iv) reducing women\u2019s time burden of unpaid care and housework by ensuring sufficient revenue \nfor investments in social services. \n \n\n                                                \n28 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Ministry of Women, Youth, Children and Family Affairs and National Statistical Office. 2016.

Improved fiscal management \nwill help ensure that the government has the resources to respond to future economic shocks, \nwhich tend to have an adverse effect on the poor, while maintaining critical public services. The \ngovernment agreed to comply with ADB\u2019s information disclosure and consultation requirements. \n \n38.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 2 and described in detail in \nthe  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.31 PFM  systems  are  assessed  as  capable  of \nsupporting  mostly  reliable  service  provision.  Policy  reforms  and  TA  support  will  address  other \nfiduciary risks. The overall risk of the operation is moderate. To mitigate the risks, the proposed \nprogram focuses on areas where the government has a strong record and has selected options \nfor policy actions in the PPPF that would help maintain reform momentum beyond 2018. ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with MOFT. \n \n\nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigation Measures \n\nRisks \nPolitical instability may weaken fiscal \ndiscipline and policy commitment. \n\nThe Asian Development Bank will continue policy engagement with \nthe government and its development partners. Policy engagement \nwith the government on its reform program consists of three main \nelements: (i) discussions on the design and implementation of the \nprogram policy matrix, (ii) Core Economic Working Group meetings, \nand (iii) joint review missions assessing program performance. \nOngoing technical assistance activities have been supporting the \ngovernment in meeting the policy actions. \nThe government, particularly the Ministry of Finance and Treasury, \nhas provided a firm commitment to the program, including the \nachievement of the policy actions under the program. \n\nThe government\u2019s capacity to implement \nreforms effectively may prove insufficient. \nThe government may limit its \nengagement or withdraw completely from \nengaging with development partners. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n39. \nThe government and MOFT have assured ADB that implementation of the program shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement, as described in detail \nin the grant agreement.32 \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  policy-based  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n40. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \ngrant not exceeding $5,000,000 to Solomon Islands from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian \nDevelopment  Fund)  for  the  Improved  Fiscal  Sustainability  Reform  Program,  on  terms  and \nconditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n                                                \n30 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 Grant Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n31 October 2018\n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objectives \nRate of inclusive economic growth reinvigorated and increased \nEnvironment  for  private  sector  development  improved  and  investment  opportunities  for  all  Solomon  Islanders \nincreased \n \n(National Development Strategy, 2016\u20132035)a \n \nResults Chain \nEffect of the Reform \n\nPerformance Indicators with \nTargets and Baselines \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n\n \nRisks \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nStrengthened public \nsector management and \nservice delivery \n\nb.
