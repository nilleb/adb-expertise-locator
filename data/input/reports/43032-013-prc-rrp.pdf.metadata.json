The  project  will  finance  investment  in  road  network  improvements, \npedestrian  mobility  and  safety,  multimodal  interchange  facilities,  intelligent  transport  system \n(ITS), and low emissions fuelling infrastructure. To support this project, an ADB-financed project \npreparatory  technical  assistance2  was  approved  in  2009  to  produce  an  agreed  design  and \nimplementation arrangements for an urban transport project suitable for ADB financing.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nXi\u2019an, the provincial capital and economic and cultural center of Shaanxi Province, is one \nof the most important growth poles in the western region of the PRC. The city is expanding and \ndeveloping rapidly and 72% of its 8.4 million residents in 2009 were categorized as urban. The \nurban  population  grew  at  an  annual  rate  of  2.5%  during  2000\u20132009  and  the  city\u2019s  gross \ndomestic product rose by 13.5% per annum over the same period. With this growth has come a \nrapid expansion of motorized vehicle traffic, along with the urban transport problems this often \nbrings.  On  average,  the  number  of  vehicles  registered  in  Xi\u2019an  increased  by  14.1%  a  year \nduring  2003\u20132007.  Annual  passenger  vehicles  growth  was  21.8%.3  The  city  is  experiencing \nworsening  traffic  congestion  and  its  strategic  road  network,  especially  the  arterial  roads \nnecessary  to  service  urban  expansion  between  its  Second  and  Third  ring  roads,  needs \ndevelopment to meet rising demand. The city\u2019s transport system is poorly integrated and does \nnot serve the needs of the entire community adequately or equitably. Roads are often unsafe for \npedestrians and bicyclists. Air quality is deteriorating as vehicle emissions grow.  \n\n4. \nXi\u2019an  is  trying  to  address  these  problems  by  expanding  its  road  network  and  transport \ninfrastructure  and  services  with  its  own  financial  resources  and  support  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)4  and  the  World  Bank.5  These  efforts  have  fallen  short  of  what  is \nneeded to meet the growing volume of travel within the city, however. Economic and population \ngrowth and overcrowding within the historic walled city have led to increasing demand for new \noffices,  commercial  space,  and  social  infrastructure  in  urban  growth  poles  beyond  the  central \narea  in  the  band  between  the  Second  Ring  Road  and  the  Third  Ring  Road  on  the  city\u2019s \nperiphery. The change in traffic patterns and surging transport requirements that have resulted \nfrom  urban  growth  here,  combined  with  limited  existing  connectivity,  have  created  transport \nbottlenecks that could constrain the city\u2019s further economic growth and development. The city\u2019s \nmaster plan has identified the need to complete missing sections of its strategic road network to \nprovide access to these emerging growth poles and to do so in a way that serves the needs of \nall road users, including public and private transport modes and pedestrians. \n\n                                                      \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB.  2009.

Xi\u2019an Statistical Yearbook. PRC. \n4  ADB.  2003.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for the Xi\u2019an Urban Transport Project. Manila. \n\n5  World Bank. 2008. Project Appraisal Document: Xi\u2019an Sustainable Urban Transport Project. Washington, DC.  \n\n\f2 \n\nThe city is finding it difficult to manage its overstretched transport system effectively. Its \n5. \ntraffic  control  center  primarily  covers  only  areas  inside  the  Second  Ring  Road  and  lacks \nequipment  in  the  new  areas  of  urban  growth  beyond.  This  results  in  (i)  poor  system \nmanagement,  (ii)  policing  and  enforcement  issues,  (iii)  conflict  between  vehicles  and \npedestrians, and (iv) a system that fails to give proper priority to public transport and emergency \nvehicles.  \n\n6. \nA lack of suitable equipment, capacity, and enforcement has also left Xi\u2019an struggling in \nthe  face  of  mounting  traffic  to  regulate  vehicle  standards,  driver  behavior,  and  emissions.  It \nneeds more equipment to check the city\u2019s motorized vehicle fleet for compliance with emissions \nstandards and to monitor and report on these emissions, as it is required to do by national law. \nGreater vehicle-related emissions now account for 50% of poor ambient air quality, highlighting \na need to develop the city\u2019s capacity to manage and police its traffic better. \n \n7. \nTo help address its transport challenges, Xi\u2019an is expanding its public transport network \nto provide a more balanced range of travel choices and limit reliance on private vehicles. Two \nsubway  lines  are  under  construction  and  four  more  are  in  development.  The  World  Bank  is \nsupporting the establishment of 13 bus priority corridors, primarily inside the Second Ring Road. \nPublic transport is made less attractive, however, by a lack of integration between its different \nmodes and by the poor standard of the public transport connections to the areas beyond the old \ncity center.  \n \n8. \nWeaknesses in interagency coordination compound the city\u2019s urban transport problems. \nThey  also  contribute  to  the  lack  of  integration  between  various  modes  of  travel,  especially \nbetween the public transport and the nonmotorized modes most used by the poor, who walk or \nuse bicycles for most of their trips.  \n \n9. \nAddressing these complex, interrelated urban transport issues\u2014and others, such as the \ngrowing  number  of  vehicle  collisions\u2014will  require  a  concerted,  comprehensive  effort  over \nseveral  years.  The  Xi\u2019an  authorities  recognize  that  a  holistic  approach  that  can  balance \nconflicting  pressures  and  demands  is  needed  to  provide  solutions  and  build  on  the  progress \nmade through earlier ADB and World Bank assistance (footnotes 4 and 5). Lessons from past \nassistance  have  been  incorporated  into  the  project  design,  notably  the  need  for  improved \ncoordination  between  line  agencies,  greater  emphasis  on  integrated  management  of  the \ntransport system, and timely approval of resettlement plans. \n \nThe  project  supports  the  PRC\u2019s  search  for  suitable,  sustainable  solutions  to  its  urban \n10. \ntransport problems and fits emerging urban priorities of its Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015. \nIt  is  also  focuses  the  key  development  agendas  of  inclusive  and  environmentally  sustainable \ndevelopment  under  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  20206  and  aligns  with  the  proposed  PRC  country \npartnership  strategy  now  being  prepared.  By  addressing  urban  transport,  it  covers  one  of  the \nfocus areas of ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative Operational Plan.7  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n11. \nThe impact will be support for inclusive,  environment-friendly economic growth in Xi\u2019an \nby  facilitating  the  movement  of  goods  and  people.  By  contributing  to  comprehensive \n\n                                                      \n6  ADB.  2008.  Strategy  2020:  The  Long-Term  Strategic  Framework  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  2008\u20132020. \n\nManila. \n\n7  ADB. 2010. Sustainable Transport Initiative Operational Plan. Manila.  \n\n\f3 \n\nimprovement  of  integrated  urban  mobility  and  transport  system  management,  the  project  will \nsupport the continued economic growth of the city. The outcome will be an efficient, safe, and \nenvironmentally sustainable integrated urban transport system developed in Xi\u2019an. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n12. \nThe  project  will  provide  missing  road  links,  improved  interchanges,  bus  prioritization, \nnonmotorized  transport  routes,  better  pedestrian  safety,  multimodal  interchange  facilities, \nadvanced traffic management, and vehicle emission control strategies. This will support better \nroad  use  and  transport  access  for  all.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  summarizes  the \nmain features of the project (Appendix 1). The five project outputs are described below.  \n \nOutput  1:  Road  network  improvements.  Output  1  will  construct  and/or  rehabilitate \n13. \n12.92 kilometers (km) of urban roads along Keji 2nd Road (6.2 km), Kunming Road (4.39 km), \nand  Dazhai  West  Road  (2.33  km)  in  the  southwest  part  of  the  city.  These  roads  will  include \n21.57  km  of  bus  priority  corridors,  21.57  km  of  nonmotorized  transport  lanes,  and  a  4.2 km \nlinear green park along Kunming Road. This output will also include six urban interchanges of \nsuitable  sizes  and  configurations  at  current  critical  bottlenecks  on  the  road  network.  They  will \nprovide sufficient access to the new urban growth centers between ring roads 2 and 3. The bus \npriority corridors will include lanes for the exclusive use of buses, traffic signals that give priority \nto  bus  transit,  station improvements,  and  traffic management  measures.  They  will  significantly \nimprove  travel  conditions  for  bus  passengers.  The  roads  will  include  facilities  for  cyclists  and \npedestrians as part of the project\u2019s aim to have street design and traffic operations cater to all \nroad  users.  The  road  network  improvements  will  provide  better  links  to  the  Second  and  Third \nring roads, making them more functional, and improve road connections between the city\u2019s new \ngrowth poles, the commercial business area in the southwest, and the government offices to the \nnorth. \n \nOutput 2: Pedestrian crossing and safety improvements. Output 2 will upgrade 110 \n14. \nurban  intersections  and  15  mid-block  pedestrian  crossing  facilities,  improving  crossing  signals \nand  visibility  and  safety  for  pedestrians.  Safety  equipment  using  advanced  information \ntechnology will be introduced and safety rules enforced. These improvements will promote the \nuse  of  nonmotorized  transport,  make  it  safer,  and  better  serve  low-income  city  residents  who \nare unlikely to have access to private modes of transport and rely on walking or public transport. \nWomen pedestrians on domestic errands and children are expected to benefit in particular.  \n \nOutput 3: Multimodal interchange facilities. Output 3 will construct (i) four multimodal \n15. \ntransport hubs, (ii) five multilevel parking facilities, and (iii) five compressed natural gas (CNG) \nstations.  The  four  transport  hubs  (Xi\u2019an  North  Train  Station,  Xi\u2019an  National  Civil  Aerospace \nIndustrial  Base,  Xi\u2019an  Yuhua  Zhai,  and  Xi\u2019an  International  Logistics  Park)  will  provide  easy \nconnections between subway, bus, taxi, car, motorcycle, and bicycle travel. The hubs will thus \nlink  other  transport  modes  from  and  to  the  surrounding  areas  with  key  public  transport  routes \nand provide staging and control facilities for public transport vehicles. The five multilevel parking \nfacilities will provide off-street parking for 2,249 vehicles and for motorcycles and bicycles. Two \nwill be built at the multimodal interchange facilities for Xi\u2019an Yuhua Zhai and Xi\u2019an International \nLogistics  Park  to  promote  modal  interchange  and  the  use  of  public  transport.  Three  parking \ngarages will be located on the edge of the old walled city (Leju Chang, South Guoshang Village, \nand  Xizhan  Community).  This  will  help  manage  traffic  demand  by  allowing  motorized  vehicle \nusers to park outside the city wall instead of driving into the congested central part of the city. \nThe  parking  subcomponent  will  also  provide  parking  management  and  enforcement  on  the \nstreets  around  the  parking  structures  and  address  the  serious  issue  of  illegal  parking  on \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nsidewalks. One CNG station will be incorporated into each of the project multimodal interchange \nfacilities and the fifth will be established close to the Third Ring Road at Mujiangwang. They will \nprovide efficient fueling for buses, taxis, and private vehicles and encourage further switching to \nthis  more  environmentally  sustainable  fuel  source.  Electric  charging  stations  will  also  be \nprovided  at  the  multimodal  interchange  facilities  to  service  the  expected  growth  in  electric \nvehicles and an existing large fleet of electric motorcycles.  \n \n16. \nOutput 4: Intelligent transport system and road user safety program. Output 4 will \nextend the  coverage of the existing ITS to the Third Ring Road and the urban growth poles it \nserves.  It  will  also  develop  an  implementation  plan  for  improving  the  use  and  management  of \nthe ITS; improve traveler information dissemination for both private and public transport modes; \nand  implement  a  road  safety  education  program  to  support  the  pedestrian  crossing  safety \nproject  output,  including  toolkits,  training  materials,  and  safety  campaigns  targeted  at  such \nvulnerable road users as children and the elderly. This output includes capacity development to \nmore effectively operate the ITS to achieve improved control of traffic and pedestrian crossings, \nas well as information dissemination and policing and enforcement. The output will include 20 \nvariable  traffic  message  signs,  140  microwave  detectors,  66  closed-circuit  televisions,  31  red-\nlight cameras, and 10 speed violation cameras.  \n \n17. \nOutput 5: Environmental protection enhancement. Output 5 will enhance the vehicle \nemissions  inspection  program  by  providing  random  inspection  capacity  and  five emission \nregulation  enforcement  vehicles,  10  black  smoke  stations, and  four  pieces  of  mobile  emission \nenforcement  equipment.  It  will  also  improve  air  quality  monitoring  by  establishing  four \nmonitoring substations along the Third Ring Road equipped with air quality and noise monitoring \nsystems connected to the environment information center and a remote sensing data receiving \nsystem  to  provide  city  wide  air  quality  status  in  the  city.  It  will  establish  a  computerized \nenvironment and vehicle emission information-sharing system, an emission regulation violation \nsystem,  public  sector  vehicle  management,  obsolete  vehicle  scrapping  enforcement \nadministration assistance, and a system for environmental information disclosure. It will also set \nup an environmental information center. The city government is committed to raising the number \nof days each year that it records air quality better than grade II8 to more than 300 by reducing \nthe emission of pollutants by industry, households, and vehicles. This output will help achieve \nthat  commitment  by  supporting  more  effective  management  and  enforcement  of  vehicle \nstandards.  \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\n18. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $558.06  million  (including  taxes  and  duties  of \n$17.54 million).  The  government  requested  a  loan  of  $150  million  from ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to finance 26.9% of the project cost. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  annum,  and \nsuch terms and conditions as may be set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. ADB\u2019s \nloan  will  cover  civil  works,  equipment,  project  management  consulting  services,  capacity \nbuilding,  the  road user safety program,  and taxes and duties  on the expenditures  financed by \n\n                                                      \n8  Grade  II  is  defined  as  ambient  air  quality  suitable  for  residential,  commercial,  education,  general  industrial,  and \nfarming areas.

The government will make the loan proceeds available to \nthe  Shaanxi  provincial  government,  which  will  relend  the  proceeds  to  the  XMG.  The  XMG  will \nonlend the loan proceeds to the Xi\u2019an Infrastructure Investment Group as the IA. The XMG will \nassume the foreign exchange and interest rate variation risks for the ADB loan. The Government \nof the PRC has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-\nbased lending facility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) assurance that these choices \nwere  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  based  on  any  communication  or  advice  from \nADB.

The implementing agency will be \nthe Xi\u2019an Infrastructure Investment Group, which will be responsible for all project outputs and \nday-to-day  project \nimplementation.  The  executing  agency  has  established  a  project \nmanagement office (PMO) with suitable staff to report to the executing agency and coordinate \nand oversee project implementation. The PMO will (i)  ensure that the project activities comply \nwith safeguard requirements; (ii) supervise procurement; (iii) monitor utilization of the ADB loan \nand the counterpart funding; (iv) prepare and submit reports to ADB and XMG; (v) ensure that \ncomplaints  received  from  the  project  stakeholders  are  addressed  adequately;  (vi)  submit \nprogress, audit, and other reports to ADB; and (vii) coordinate with ADB review missions.  \n\n22. \nThe XMG has established a project leading group to address lessons from the previous \nADB  project  (footnote  4).  It  will  be  responsible  for  project  oversight  and  ensuring  coordination \nacross the various agencies that have responsibility for urban development and urban transport \nin Xi\u2019an. The project leading group will be chaired by the vice mayor of the XMG, with heads of \nconcerned  municipal  agencies  as  members.  The  vice  mayor  will  chair  project  leading  group \nmeetings,  which  will  be  held  every  3  months  or  more  often  if  necessary  to  review \nimplementation, resolve coordination issues, and ensure timely completion of the project. \n \n\n                                                      \n10 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f7 \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nProject management \n(i) Oversight body \n\n(ii) Executing agency \n(iii) Key implementing agency \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \nAdvance contracting approved. \nRetroactive financing will apply up to \n20% of the loan amount, with respect \nto the expenditures incurred prior to \nloan effectiveness but not earlier \nthan 12 months before signing of the \nloan agreement.a \n\nDisbursement  \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nOctober 2011\u2013December 2016 \n31 December 2016 \n\nProject leading group \nVice mayor of Xi\u2019an Municipal Government (chair) \nHeads of concerned municipal agencies (members) \nXi\u2019an Municipal Urban and Rural Construction Commission \nXi\u2019an Infrastructure Investment Group  \nInternational competitive bidding \nNational competitive bidding \nQCBS/QBS \nPackage C03 Kunming Road \n\n19 contracts \n23 contracts \n109 person-months  $1.8 million \n\n$256.8 million \n$51.6 million \n\nPackage C04 Zhuhong Road and North Second Ring Road interchange \n\nPackage C09 Fengcheng 8th Road and Taihua Road interchange \n\nConsulting services \n\nCapacity development  \n\nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB.  \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection, QBS = quality-based selection. \na  Advance contracting will be conditional upon approval of the resettlement plan(s). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nThe  capacity  of  XMG  to  deliver  and  in  the  operation  of  the  project  is  considered \n23. \nadequate to implement the project\u2019s advanced technical aspects, based on its performance on \nsuch  aspects  in  the  past.  These  aspects  relate  to  the  multimodal  transport  facilities,  ITS, \npedestrian safety, and environment outputs, as well as capacity and stakeholder involvement in \nsystem  operations  and  road  safety.  The  project  is  technically  viable  with  technology  choices \nbased on efficient and proven designs. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n24. \nThe  project  is  economically  viable,  with  an  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return \n(EIRR) of 22.6% and net present value of CNY2,896.9 million discounted at 12%. The estimate \ncovered  all  five  outputs  for  the  period  2011\u20132035.  The  estimated  costs  include  investment  in \ncivil  works  and  equipment,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  periodic  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M). The estimated benefits include normal, generated, and diverted traffic and \ninclude  savings  in  vehicle  operating  cost,  travel  time,  and  reductions  in  road  accidents  and \nemissions.  Sensitivity  analysis  produced  a  favorable  EIRR  after  tests  assuming  cost  overruns \nand benefit reductions and showed that the project\u2019s economic viability is robust.  \n \n25. \nThe  project  has  both  revenue  and  nonrevenue  components.  The  nonrevenue \ncomponents include road network improvements, ITS upgrades, pedestrian crossing and safety \nimprovements, environmental protection enhancement, and multimodal transport facilities. The \ntwo revenue-generating components consist of (i) the five CNG fueling stations, and (ii) the five \nparking facilities, which also include some revenue-producing retail space. The total estimated \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\ncost for the CNG stations is CNY62.6 million. O&M is estimated at CNY12.9 million (CNY12.3 \nmillion after subtracting depreciation) per annum and is assumed to increase with inflation. The \nfinancial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the CNG stations component is 3.8%, which is higher \nthan the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 1.6%. The financial net present value at \nthis WACC is CNY15.6 million. The CNG stations are considered financially feasible. The total \nestimated  cost  of  the  five  multilevel  parking  structures  is  CNY137.2  million.  Annual  O&M  is \nestimated  at  CNY12.6  million  (CNY7.3  million  after  subtracting  depreciation)  at  the  start  of \noperation.  The  FIRR  for  the  parking  component  is  3.2%,  which  is  higher  than  the  WACC  of \n1.6%. The financial net present value at this WACC is CNY35.5 million. The multilevel parking \ngarages are considered financially feasible. \n\n26. \nAnnual  debt  service  and  O&M  are  forecast  to  be  about  0.5%  of  the  XMG\u2019s  projected \nannual revenues in 2016 and to decline thereafter. Fiscal revenues of the municipal government \nwill  grow  in  line  with  economic  development,  providing  more  resources  for  the  municipal \ngovernment to finance the proposed project components. O&M and debt service for the project \nwill account for about 3.4% of the Xi\u2019an Infrastructure Investment Group\u2019s projected revenues in \n2016 and will decline thereafter. This is considered adequate for the proposed loan. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance  \n\nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \n27. \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). The relevant sections of \nthe ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all procurement \ndocument and contracts. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the \nGovernment  of  the  PRC,  the  XMG,  the  executing  agency  (including  the  PMO),  and  the \nimplementing agency, including the project implementing unit. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n28. \nA  poverty  and  social  assessment  has  been  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  ADB \nHandbook on Social Analysis.11 The assessment indicated that the project will contribute directly \nand indirectly to poverty reduction in Xi\u2019an through the creation of an estimated 700 temporary \njob-years for construction and 300 permanent jobs for operation of the project outputs. Indirect \nbenefits will accrue from lower health costs associated with reductions in vehicular emissions, \nroad  accidents,  and  travel  times.  It  is  envisaged  that  the  project\u2019s  largest  impact  will  be  the \nsocial benefits of making greater convenient, affordable, and safe transport options available in \na  more  equitable  way  for  all  road  users,  including  women,  children,  the  elderly,  and  the \ndisabled. Dedicated PMO staff will be responsible for implementation and monitoring of a social \naction plan that has been developed on the basis of the assessment\u2019s findings.  \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n29. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  under  environment  category  A.  In  compliance \nwith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), an environmental impact assessment (EIA) was \ndisclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website  on  24  June  2011  and  prepared  using  (i)  feasibility  study  reports, \n(ii) applicable  PRC  laws  and  requirements,  and  (iii)  a  cultural  relic  survey  report.  The  major \npotential environmental impacts involve emissions and noise from the increases in vehicle fleet \nsize during the operational period. The project will address this through vehicle inspection and \n\n                                                      \n11 ADB. 2007. Handbook on Social Analysis. Manila. \n\n\f9 \n\nenforcement  of  vehicle  emission  standards,  as  well  as  such  mitigation  measures  as  noise \nbarrier  installation  where  noise  levels  exceed  standards  defined  in  the  environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP).  While  no  significant  impacts  are  predicted  on  cultural  relic  sites, \nvibration  and  dust  will  be  closely  monitored  at  the  sites  during  construction,  a  cultural  relic \nexpert  will  be  engaged  by  the  implementing  agency,  and  the  chance  finds  procedures  as \ndefined in the EMP will be followed. \n\n30. \nXMG  will  be  required  to  observe  the  EIA  and  EMP  and  experience  from  past  ADB \nprojects  indicate  that  it  has  the  capacity  to  properly  execute  the  plans.  To  ensure  all  potential \nadverse  environmental  impacts  of  the  project  are  mitigated,  the  implementing  agency  will \nimplement  the  EMP  as  specified  in  the  EIA.  The  EMP  will  be  incorporated  in  the  bidding \ndocuments and contracts for civil works and monitored through semiannual reports submitted to \nADB. A grievance redress mechanism has been developed, details of which are provided in the \nEIA.12 \n \n31. \nResettlement. The project is classified as category A for involuntary resettlement. The \nproject will acquire 58.67 hectares (ha) of state-owned land. It will also acquire about 46.5 ha of \ncollective  land,  of  which  10.2  ha  (22%)  is  classified  as  cultivated.  A  total  of  73,350  square \nmeters  (m2)  of  residential  housing  and  267,257  m2  of  buildings  used  by  institutions  and \nenterprises will be demolished. The permanent land acquisition and house demolition required \nwill affect 277 households and 9,576 people, including staff and workers. No land external to the \nproject construction sites will be required for temporary use during construction. \n \n32. \nThe cost of land acquisition and resettlement is CNY993 million. The executing agency \nhas assured ADB that adequate counterpart funding will be made available for land acquisition \nand  resettlement,  in  line  with  the  annual  funding  requirements  stipulated  in  the  resettlement \nplan. Resettlement implementation will be monitored both internally and externally. Experience \nfrom  past  ADB  projects  indicates  that  the  executing  agency  has  the  institutional  capacity  to \ncarry out the plan effectively. The PMO's land acquisition and resettlement unit will coordinate \ninternal  supervision  and  reporting  of  plan  implementation  with  the  relevant  local  government \nagencies. The executing agency will engage an external institute for semiannual monitoring and \nreporting.  The  executing  agency  will  finance  all  of  the  monitoring  costs  from  their  counterpart \nfunds. The monitoring details and costs are included in the resettlement plan.  \n \n33. \nIndigenous peoples. As Han Chinese, who makes up the PRC\u2019s majority ethnic group, \ncomprises 99% of Xi\u2019an\u2019s population, the project is classified under category C. The remaining \n1% of the city\u2019s residents is mostly Hui but no intrinsic difference exists in the way the project \nwill  affect  the  two  ethnic  groups.  Both  will  benefit.  No  construction  activities  will  occur  near  a \nmosque,  the  most  common  place  of  religious  worship  for  the  predominantly  Muslim  Hui.  No \nethnic  minority  people  have  been  identified  whose  assets  will  be  adversely  affected  by  the \nproject. Measures to enhance the participation of the city\u2019s Hui people are included in the social \naction plan. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures  \n\n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the assessment and risk management plan.13 \n \n\n                                                      \n12 Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nWeak project coordination between the \nPMO, executing agency, and \nimplementing agency \n\nMitigating Measures\nThe risk will be mitigated through the project leading group, which will \ncoordinate among various agencies and appropriate actions. \n\nPoor integration of land use and transport  The project is designed to improve transport mode connectivity and \n\nconnection to local areas through multimodal interchange hubs. \n\nDelays in the provision of counterpart \nfunding, particularly for the road \nsubcomponents  \n\nThe risk will be mitigated through covenanted assurances from local \ngovernments for timely provision of counterpart funding and direct \nPMO coordination with them. \n\nLack of long-term commitment to \nsustainable operation and maintenance  \n\nThe risk will be mitigated through significant long-term capacity \nbuilding in urban infrastructure maintenance agencies. \n\nLimited promotion of safe and inclusive \ntransport modes \n\nThe project will provide demonstration and capacity development to \nensure safe and inclusive sustainable transport delivery. \n\nChance encounters with archeological \nremains during construction, given that \nXi\u2019an is a city of historical significance \n\nProject monitoring procedures will ensure that any cultural or \narcheological remains will be properly handled and preserved. \n\nDelays in approval of resettlement plans, \nleading to delays in project activities \n\nProcessing schedules and timing of approvals will be monitored to \navoid delays. \n\nIncreases in land values resulting in a \ncost overrun for resettlement \n\nDiscussions have been held with the government on this issue and \nprovisions for additional finances, if required, are being sought by the \nXi\u2019an Municipal Government.  \n\nPMO = project management office.  \nSources: Asian Development Bank. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n35. \nThe Government of the PRC and the XMG have assured ADB that implementation of the \nproject  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement,  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n36. \nfor the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement.  \n \n\nThe Government of the PRC and the XMG have agreed with ADB on certain covenants \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION  \n\n37. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove the loan of $150,000,000 to the People's Republic of China for the Xi\u2019an Urban Road \nNetwork  Improvement  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility;
