THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  to  India  for  the  Rajasthan  State  Highway  Investment \nProgram.1 \n \n2.  The investment program will improve the efficiency and safety of transport on the state \nhighways of Rajasthan, thereby providing good quality connectivity for social and economic \nactivities. The investment program will (i) upgrade about 2,000 kilometers (km) of state highways \nand major district roads (MDRs) to two-lane or intermediate-lane standards in keeping with road \nsafety requirements; and (ii) enhance the capacity of the Public Works Department of the \nGovernment of Rajasthan (RPWD) by (a) improving the business processes and procedures of \nits  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP)  division  and  (b)  implementing  a  project  performance \nmonitoring  system.  The  investment  program  will  catalyze  the  sustainable  development  of \nRajasthan through the collaboration of the public and private sectors. \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  India is the world\u2019s seventh-largest economy by nominal gross domestic product and the \nthird-largest by purchasing power parity.2 Since FY2013 when the growth rate slowed to 5.1%, \nthe economy has been gradually recovering, attaining 7.3% growth in FY2015.3 The poverty head \ncount  ratio  has  also  steadily  decreased.  To  sustain  this  growth,  India  must  expand  and \nconsolidate its structural reforms, eliminate its infrastructure deficit, and improve the quality and \ncoverage of basic social services. India\u2019s transport infrastructure in particular requires significant \nimprovements. Various modes of transport must be sustainably developed to provide an efficient, \nsafe, and regionally balanced transport system. \n \n4.  Rajasthan is India\u2019s largest state by area, accounting for about 10% of the country\u2019s total \narea and nearly 5.6% of the total population (around 68.5 million people).4 However, in 2015 the \nstate\u2019s economy only represented about 4.8% of India\u2019s gross domestic product, and its per capita \nincome was only about 87% of the national average.5 Around 75% of the state's inhabitants live \nin rural areas and depend primarily on agriculture for their livelihood. The per capita development \ncost in the state is very high because the population is widely dispersed. Although the state has \nstrong potential for growth\u2014e.g., in agriculture and agro-based industries, mining and minerals \nprocessing, tourism, handicrafts, and cottage industries\u2014this potential remains underutilized due \nto poor connectivity to markets and social services. \n \n5.  Sector road map. Rajasthan\u2019s road network covers about 217,707 km, including 8,168 \nkm of national highways, 15,607 km of state highways, 7,647 km of MDRs, 30,313 km of other \ndistrict roads, and 155,973 km of rural roads. Road density in Rajasthan is only around 63.61 km \nper 100 square km, compared with the national average of 166.47 km. The number of vehicles \nregistered in Rajasthan has increased dramatically. Statistics from the Transport Department of \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Jaipur. \n ", "2 \nRajasthan show that the state registered about 13.4 million vehicles in 2015, 48.6% more than in \n2011. \n \n6.  To support Rajasthan\u2019s development through economic growth, poverty reduction, and \ninclusiveness, the state government aims to provide a safe, sound, environment-friendly and \nsustainable state-of-the-art road infrastructure network.6 To achieve this objective, the following \nkey factors must be addressed: \n(i)  Sector funding level. The state budget for capital road works is less than 3% of \nthe state\u2019s total planned budget, which is inadequate to undertake large-scale road \ndevelopment programs. Thus, a significant increase in capital investments will be \nrequired from the public and private sectors. \n(ii)  Maintenance. The premature deterioration observable on the state highways \nreflects the maintenance backlog. It is essential to develop adequate policies, \nprocedures,  and  institutional  capacity  to  plan,  fund,  and  implement  the \nmaintenance works. \n(iii)  Road safety management. The road safety situation in Rajasthan is serious and \ndeteriorating. In 2014, road accidents were the fifth leading cause of accidental \ndeath in Rajasthan.7 Thus, it is necessary to strengthen both the engineering and \nnon-engineering aspects of road safety management capacity in Rajasthan. \n(iv)  Capacity development. It is the first time for RPWD to implement an ADB-funded \nproject. Although RPWD has adequate technical capacity for project management, \nit needs supports on complying with ADB\u2019s policies on procurement, safeguards, \nand other related areas. As the owner of most of the roads in Rajasthan, the RPWD \nneeds to strengthen its capacity with regard to road asset management, road \nsafety, and information management.  \n \n7.  Strategic context. India\u2019s Twelfth Five Year Plan identified transport as a priority sector.8 \nDue to public resource constraints, private participation must supplement public investment. The \nplan encourages state governments to implement state highway development programs (SHDPs) \nsimilar to the National Highway Development Program. It is estimated that developing these \nprograms will cost \u20b94.9 trillion, of which at least 20% is expected to be funded by private \ninvestment. In 2014, Rajasthan announced its SHDP, which aims to upgrade about 20,000 km of \nstate highways and MDRs to two-lane or intermediate-lane state highway standards using three \nPPP models: (i) toll-based PPP concessions; (ii) annuity-based PPP concessions; and (iii) \nengineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contracts.9 All SHDP projects will be assessed \naccording to the contracts\u2019 financial models and the strategic priority of road improvement to \nselect the most appropriate contract model and procurement approach. \n \n8.  Public\u2013private partnership. The road subsector in India is shifting away from traditional \nrate-based contracts with the private sector to output-, performance-, and even partnership-based \ncontracts. Since the late 1990s, the public and private sectors in India have made substantial \n                                                \n6  Government  of  Rajasthan.  2014.

Delhi. \n9  While the PPP viability gap funding model will transfer to the private sector concessionaire the risk of recovering the \ncapital investment from toll revenue, the PPP annuity model keeps the risk in the public sector. The annuity model \ndefers the payment of a portion of construction and maintenance costs to the concession period as annuity payments, \nwhich will be made in compliance with performance metrics. Therefore, the PPP annuity model essentially follows \nthe principles of performance-based road contracts. \n ", "3 \nefforts to develop PPP models and resolve many issues in the road subsector.10 However, this \nsubsector has shown diminishing interest in toll-based PPP projects in light of overextended \nfinancial and engineering risks with regard to design and execution. This model will only suit a \nsmall number of SHDP projects since traffic volumes on most roads are not adequate to ensure \nfinancial viability. Instead, most SHDP projects are expected to adopt the annuity-based PPP and \nthe EPC models, which transfer the engineering risks to the private sector using output-based \ncontract forms.  \n \n9.  Value addition from ADB. Asian Development Bank (ADB) will finance part of the \nconstruction costs for the annuity-based PPP concessions and EPC contracts, enhance the \nstability  of  the  contract  regime  with  the  loan  and  project  agreements,  and  ensure  good \ngovernance during project implementation, particularly on procurement and safeguards. The \nannuity-based PPP model attracts private sector financing to address the capital investment \nrequirements, where a proportion of initial capital expenditure is paid during construction while \nthe balance is serviced by annuity payments during the operation and maintenance (O&M) phase. \nThe SHDPs require EPC contracts to balance the risks of PPP projects because they enable the \nstate government to (i) manage the risk of financial closure in PPP projects due to fluctuating \nmarket interests, (ii) maintain the government\u2019s extended liability to annuity payments at an \nacceptable level, and (iii) deliver high-priority projects with a short procurement period.  \n \n10.  Policy framework. The RPWD manages about 149,080 km of national highways, state \nhighways, MDRs, and rural roads in Rajasthan. Other agencies that manage roads in the state \ninclude  (i)  the  Rajasthan  State  Road  Development  and  Construction  Corporation,  which \nimplements  projects  on  about  2,000  km  of  state  highways;  (ii)  the  Road  Infrastructure \nDevelopment Company of Rajasthan, a special purpose vehicle created through a partnership \nbetween the state government and the private sector, which manages another 2,000 km of roads; \n(iii) the National Highways Authority of India; and (iv) the Border Roads Organisation. \n \n11.  In 2014, a high-level council for infrastructure development was formed to decide on \nSHDP-related policy and institutional issues. In 2015, the state legislature enacted the Rajasthan \nState Highways Act to empower the state government to develop and operate state highways \nwith provisions for access control, traffic regulation, and toll collection, to be executed by the \nRPWD. The state government also adopted the Road Safety Action Plan, which has initiated road \nsafety awareness campaigns, and started engineering and enforcement actions. \n \n12.  The investment program, an integral part of the SHDP, aligns with India\u2019s country strategy, \nthe Twelfth Five Year Plan, and ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017, which both aim \nto improve the transport sector to increase the movement of people and goods in a more efficient, \nsafe, and sustainable manner.11 The investment program has been prepared to address the key \nsuccess factors (para. 6)  by  (i)  catalyzing  private  sector  investment, (ii)  strengthening the \nmaintenance and road safety arrangements during the operation period, and (iii) enhancing the \nRPWD\u2019s capacity for project implementation and as a long-term asset manager.  \n \n13.  An MFF is proposed as the financing modality because it better suits a large-scale \nprogram requiring long-term engagement and partnership between the government and ADB on \npolicy dialogue and capacity development.12 The modality also allows a phased approach for the \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2015.

Impact and Outcome \n14.  The impact will be good quality connectivity provided in all areas, aligned with India\u2019s \nTwelfth Five Year Plan. The outcome will be the improved efficiency and safety of transport on \nthe state highways of Rajasthan. \n \nC.  Outputs \n15.  The investment program will deliver two outputs\u2014(i) improved state highways and MDRs, \nand (ii) the enhanced capacity of the RPWD\u2014through the following components: \n(i)  Road  improvement.  About  2,000  km  of  state  highways  and  MDRs  will  be \ndesigned, constructed, rehabilitated, operated, and maintained. The project roads \nwill be constructed or rehabilitated to two-lane or intermediate-lane standards and \nwill become part of the Rajasthan state highway network.13 \n(ii)  Capacity  development.  This  component  will  build  the  RPWD\u2019s  road  asset \nmanagement, road safety, and project management capacity. Consulting services \nwill be engaged to help the RPWD\u2019s PPP division develop its capacity.14 \n \n16.  The first tranche will deliver the following outputs: \n(i)  Road improvement. About 1,000 km of state highways and MDRs in Rajasthan \nwill be upgraded to two-lane or intermediate-lane standards. \n(ii)  Capacity development. The capacity of the RPWD\u2019s PPP division will be built by \npreparing and piloting streamlined business processes and procedures covering \nroad  asset  management,  road  safety,  and  project  management.  A  project \nperformance monitoring system will also be developed to manage PPP projects for \nroads. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n17.  The investment program is estimated to cost $1,415 million, including taxes and duties, \nphysical and price contingencies, interest, and other charges during implementation (Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Investment Program \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

The ADB loan will finance the milestone \npayments during the construction period. ADB will finance eligible expenditures up to 100% of every claim it receives, \nas long as sufficient undisbursed loan amounts remain. If the remaining amount is not sufficient to cover 100% of the \nclaim, only the remaining amount will be disbursed. The associated risks and control mechanism are described in \nthe financial management section of the FAM. \n16 The government will pay 50% of the construction costs to the concessionaire during the construction period. During \nthe construction period, the concessionaire will be required to finance the remaining 50% of the construction costs, \nwhich will be disbursed, along with interest, as annuity payments in 20 biannual instalments spread over 10 years, \nstarting from the date when commercial operations commenced. The procurement of annuity-based PPP concession \nis at an advanced stage, with three packages already having completed the evaluation process. \n17 Periodic Financing Request for Project 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The implementation arrangements for the investment program are summarized in Table \n3 and described in detail in the facility administration manual (FAM).18 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  May 2017 \u2013 March 2024 \nEstimated completion date  31  March  2022  (first  tranche);  the  first  tranche  will  close  on  30 \nSeptember 2022, while the MFF will close on 30 September 2024. \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Empowered Committee for Road Projects, Government of Rajasthan \n(ii)  Executing agency  Government of Rajasthan through the RPWD \n(iii)  Key implementing agency  RPWD \n(iv)  Implementation unit  The PPP division of the RPWD, 41 staff \nProcurement  International  8\u201310 contracts  About $1,284 million \ncompetitive bidding \nConsulting services  Project management  About 132  About $10 million \nconsultants (QCBS  international and 292 \n80:20)  national person-\nmonths (2 contracts) \nRetroactive financing and/or  Retroactive financing and/or  advance contracting  will be used for \nadvance contracting  goods, civil works, and consulting services financed by the first tranche. \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon by the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, MFF = multitranche financing facility, PPP = public\u2013private partnership, RPWD = Public \nWorks Department of the Government of Rajasthan, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n21.  The engineering designs are optimized for economy, construction efficiency, and road \nsafety following applicable international and national design standards. The construction method \nwill use proven technology and standard materials compatible with local conditions. The first \ntranche includes the following civil works contracts: (i) three annuity-based PPP concessions, \nincluding the construction and a 10-year commercial operation period; and (ii) one EPC contract \nfor  construction  and  5  years  of  performance-based  maintenance.  A  dedicated  road  safety \nconsultant will be engaged for each concession or contract to undertake road safety audits during \nthe design, construction, and maintenance stages. Climate risks of the project roads have been \nassessed and addressed in the environmental management plan (EMP). \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n22.  Economic analysis for the first tranche was carried out by comparing the societal cost of \ntransportation with and without the project, taking into consideration the benefits of improved \nlevels of service on the project road sections. The project benefits will include reduced vehicle \noperating costs, travel time, accidents, vehicle emissions, and congestion at some of the built-up \nareas that will be provided with bypasses. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) (taking into \n                                                \n18 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nconsideration vehicle operating cost and travel time savings) is estimated at 17.4%, indicating \nthat the investment is viable in social cost\u2013benefit terms. The EIRR for individual road sections is \n14.0%\u201320.8%. A sensitivity analysis testing the effects of possible unfavorable scenarios resulting \nfrom changes in the key parameters that determine the project costs and benefits indicated that \nthe economic viability remained satisfactory, with an EIRR of 13.1% or above. \n \n23.  The project roads will be developed with the concessionaires or contractors responsible \nfor maintenance over an extended period. The state government plans to collect user fees for all \nroad sections under the SHDP (para. 10). It has announced the toll rates, and started toll collection \non a number of state highways. Financial analysis found that project roads under the first tranche \nwould generate sufficient liquid cash resources to allow the project to fully meet its O&M costs \nand contribute to the maintenance needs of the state highways. The state government has \nconsistently used its budget well in 2011\u20132015 by fully executing the approved budget for planned \nmaintenance, and has committed to funding project O&M in case user fees are not collected. \n \nC.  Governance \n24.  Financial management. An assessment of financial management has been undertaken. \nThe state government has established financial management systems in its agencies such as the \nRPWD. The risk is rated as moderate, primarily due to a lack of proper internal audits, delays in \ncompleting the external audit, and the RPWD\u2019s lack of experience in implementing ADB-funded \nprojects. A financial management specialist will be recruited to strengthen the RPWD\u2019s financial \nmanagement capacity. The investment program will provide training on and support for ADB \nprocedures and financial management systems. The FAM details the risks and related mitigating \nmeasures, based on which the financial management arrangements are considered adequate. \n \n25.  Procurement and anticorruption. The civil works will be procured through annuity-based \nPPP  concessions  or  EPC  contracts,  and  will  be  undertaken  following  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). Consultants will be recruited following ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Annuity-based PPP \nconcessions and EPC contracts financed by ADB will use a procurement process and bidding \ndocuments that follow ADB policies and will include a policy statement on avoiding corrupt \npractices. The bidding documents, concession agreements, and contract agreements developed \nby the Government of India may be used as appropriate and with necessary revisions on eligibility, \nsafeguards,  anticorruption,  and  other factors  to meet  ADB  procurement requirements. The \ngovernment will publish information relating to the  investment program\u2014including business \nopportunities and information on the procurement of goods, works, and consulting services\u2014on \nthe RPWD\u2019s website. The capacity development component will help the RPWD improve its \nbusiness process and project monitoring system, which will also help enhance good governance. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was discussed with the national and \nstate governments. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are in the \nFAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n26.  The project roads under the first tranche spread across Rajasthan\u2019s rural areas, which are \ncharacterized by the predominance of traditional farming and a lack of reliable road connectivity, \nwhich limits access to health and education institutions, commercial facilities, and government \ndevelopment agencies. The 1,199 surveyed households along the project roads indicated that \npoor road conditions prevent safe and reliable travel, especially at night and during bad weather. \nThese communities indicated that positive benefits will include (i) improved access to health and \n ", "8 \neducation facilities, (ii) faster access to marketplaces, (iii) increased job opportunities, and (iv) \nbetter public and private transport options. An efficient road network connecting villages, towns, \nand  cities  will  provide  stronger  links  between  rural  communities  and  urban  hubs.  Road \ndevelopment encourages other development initiatives that can stimulate economic growth. The \nimprovements  are  expected  to  improve  the  socioeconomic  situation  and  reduce  poverty \nsignificantly in the beneficiary districts and the state. The first tranche roads will pass through 156 \nvillages in 15 districts where about 39.5 million people reside. \n \n27.  Gender and development. Except for those in very poor households, rural women in \nproject areas rarely engage in outside work. The project will improve connectivity and provide \nwomen with better access to health services, higher levels of education, economic opportunities, \nand social interaction. Land acquisition and resettlement will affect 22 households headed by \nwomen. Special attention will be given to these households to ensure that their situation is the \nsame as or better than pre-project levels. For first tranche project roads, implementable gender-\nproactive features include (i) constructing (a) more than 150 bus stop shelters in locations that \nwill be finalized after community consultations, (b) 2 km of raised sidewalk, and (c) more than 90 \nkm of hard shoulder that will benefit pedestrians, especially the elderly, women, and children; (ii) \nintegrating into the road design safety features for the elderly, women, children, and people with \ndisabilities,  such  as  proper  signage  and  marked  crossings  throughout  the  alignment;  (iii) \npromoting road safety and safe mobility campaigns in affected communities (with a target \naudience of 50% women); (iv) conducting awareness-building sessions for HIV/AIDS, basic health \nand hygiene, and human trafficking in project-affected villages (with a target audience of 50% \nwomen); and (v) encouraging civil works contractors to engage women as wage laborers and \nensure equal pay for equal work. The contracts include provisions to ensure compliance with all \napplicable  labor  laws,  including  not  employing  children  or  forced  labor  for  construction, \nencouraging increased employment of women and local poor people, and paying men and women \nthe same wages for work of equal value. \n \n28.  HIV/AIDS and trafficking. Based on an assessment by the National AIDS Control \nOrganisation of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the State AIDS Prevention and \nControl Society, Rajasthan has an estimated adult HIV prevalence of 0.32%, which is lower than \nthe national prevalence of 0.35%. Key efforts on awareness-building, prevention, and treatment \nare being undertaken by the health department and the Rajasthan AIDS Control Society in the \nstates, districts, and blocks. Government initiatives and mitigating measures are in place to \naddress all health and social risks and impacts associated with infrastructure development in the \nproject area. The poverty and social assessment indicated that the project will not increase HIV \nincidence, as all improved roads will be along the existing corridor. The RPWD will ensure that \ncivil works contractors conduct awareness programs on HIV/AIDS, human trafficking, and child \nlabor at construction campsites and workplaces. All contracts will have clauses concerning these \ninitiatives,  and  the  state  government  will  monitor  compliance  during  implementation.  The \nconcessionaires or contractors will conduct awareness-raising activities on HIV/AIDS, basic \nhygiene, and human trafficking in villages along the project roads. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n29.  Involuntary Resettlement. A resettlement framework has been prepared to guide the \nscreening and preparation of subprojects.19 The first tranche is classified as category A for \ninvoluntary resettlement following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The engineering \ndesign was optimized to minimize land acquisition. Four resettlement plans corresponding to the \n                                                \n19 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \ncivil works packages have been prepared following India\u2019s Right to Fair Compensation and \nTransparency  in  Land  Acquisition,  Rehabilitation,  and  Resettlement  Act,  2013  and  ADB's \nSafeguard Policy Statement, and have been disclosed on ADB\u2019s website.20 About 237 hectares \nof private land will be acquired, which will affect 781 private structures. In total, 2,994 households \ncomprising 18,411 people will be impacted, of which 1,292 households will experience economic \ndisplacement  and  217  households  will  experience  physical  displacement.  The  displaced \nhouseholds  will  be  entitled  to  replacement  compensation,  shifting  cost,  and  other  income \nrestoration assistance for the loss of land and structures. Impacts have been thoroughly assessed \nand the proposed measures in the resettlement plans are commensurate with these. The RPWD \nis experienced in implementing projects funded by international development banks and has \ncommitted to provide resources to implement the resettlement plans in a timely manner. The \nRPWD will engage a nongovernment organization to assist with the implementation of the \nresettlement plans, and the project management consultant\u2019s resettlement specialist will act as \nthe external monitor. \n \n30.  Indigenous peoples. The first tranche is classified as category C following the Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. Due diligence has confirmed that there are no indigenous peoples groups in \nthe project area. An indigenous peoples planning framework has been prepared.21 \n \n31.  Environmental impact. An environmental assessment and review framework has been \nprepared.22 The first tranche is classified as category B following the Safeguard Policy Statement. \nMost of the adverse impacts are coterminous with the construction stage, site-specific, limited \nwithin the right-of-way, and easily mitigated. Anticipated environmental impacts under the first \ntranche entail typical road construction-related issues such as the generation of dust, noise, \nexhaust, and waste from construction and worker camps; water contamination; restrictions on \nanimal movement; and occupational health and safety hazards. The EMP included mitigation \nmeasures. To minimize adverse impacts on the movements of animals such as the chinkara, \nnilgai, and road users, particularly in the Thar Desert, the road design includes signboards and \npipes turned into box culverts with vegetation camouflage to serve as underpasses. The number \nof trees cut down was minimized through eccentric road widening along \u201cgreen tunnels\u201d where \nadequate RPWD land is available. A road-specific EMP and concomitant costs are part of the \nbidding  documents.  Meaningful  consultations  with  key  environmental  agencies,  roadside \ncommunities, and nongovernment organizations were conducted during the project preparation \nstage, and all concerns of the affected persons and stakeholders were incorporated in the initial \nenvironmental examination and EMP.23 An integrated social and environmental grievance redress \nmechanism has been formed to continue receiving feedback and complaints from affected parties \nand addressing them during the construction and operation stages. The initial environmental \nexamination is disclosed on the ADB and RPWD websites. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n32.  The overall risk assessment is moderate without mitigation and low with mitigation. \nIntegrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh costs. Major risks and mitigating \nmeasures are described in Table 4, while a complete assessment is in the risk assessment and \nrisk management plan.24 \n                                                \n20 Resettlement Plans (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22  Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Major Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisk \nRisks  Assessment  Mitigating Measures \nSafeguards  Substantial  Before starting construction, a due diligence mission will be fielded to \nnoncompliance  ensure safeguards compliance and create awareness among the \nproject stakeholders about the Asian Development Bank\u2019s pertinent \nsafeguard requirements (timeline: during project implementation). \nImplementation  High  The implementation delay is likely caused by slow land acquisition and \ndelay  resettlement or the procurement progress. For the first tranche, the \nRPWD initiated land acquisition and resettlement in April 2016, and \nthe procurement of civil works in January 2016 (timeline: ongoing). \n RPWD = Public Works Department of the Government of Rajasthan. \n Source: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n33.  The central government, state government, and RPWD have assured ADB that the \nproject\u2019s implementation shall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the FAM and loan documents. \n \n34.  The  central  government,  state  government,  and  RPWD  have  given  ADB  certain \nundertakings for the MFF, which are set forth in the framework financing agreement. Specific \ncovenants agreed upon by the central government and the state government with respect to \nindividual tranches under the MFF are set forth in the loan and project agreements for the \nrespective tranches. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n35.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the multitranche financing facility to India for the Rajasthan State Highway Investment \nProgram in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000,000, which \ncomprises the provision of loans from ADB's ordinary capital resources, with interest and other \nterms to be determined in accordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate-based lending \nfacility, and is subject to such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the framework financing agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n \n \n12 April 2017\n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK FOR THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nImpact the Program is Aligned with: \nGood quality connectivity in all areas provided (Twelfth Five Year Plan)a \n  Performance Indicators \nwith Targets and  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome  By 2025     \nEfficiency and safety  a.
