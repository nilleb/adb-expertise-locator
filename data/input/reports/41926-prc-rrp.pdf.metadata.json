Annually, the Project will generate 250.9 \ngigawatt-hours  of  electricity  from  wind  resources,  replace  the \nusage  of  86,118  tons  (t)  of  standard  coal  for  power  generation, \nreduce  carbon  dioxide  emissions  by  242,127  t,  and  conserve \n5,900 t of freshwater. \n \nThe Project supports the strategy of the Government of the PRC \n(the  Government)  to  promote  renewable  energy  development, \naiming  to  increase  the  total  installed  capacity  of  wind  power  by \nabout five times, from 6.1 gigawatts in 2007 to 30.0 gigawatts by \n2020,  and  to  enlarge  the  share  of  renewable  energy  in  the \ncountry\u2019s  power  generation  portfolio  from  8%  in  2007  to  20%  in \n2020.  The  Project  will  lessen  reliance  on  coal  burning  for  power \ngeneration  and  abate  greenhouse  gas  emissions, \nthereby \ncontributing  to  the  mitigation  of  global  warming  and  climate \nchange.  The  Project  will  enhance  the  utilization  of  indigenous \nrenewable  energy  resources,  improve  wind  farm  management \npractices,  provide  opportunities  for  job  creation  and  income \ngrowth,  raise  fiscal  revenues,  upgrade  local  infrastructure,  and \nprotect  the  regional  ecological  environment,  thereby  contributing \nto poverty alleviation and sustainable development in the region. \n \n\n \nBorrower \n\n \nClassification  \n \n\n \nEnvironment and \nSocial Assessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \nDevelopment Impact \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nProject Sponsors and \nGuarantors \n\nCECIC  is  the  only  national-level  enterprise  owned  by  the \nGovernment  that  is  specifically  tasked  with  improving  energy \nefficiency,  developing  renewable  energy,  and  protecting  the \nenvironment in the PRC. CECIC started as a government agency \nin  the  former  State  Planning  Commission  and  was  registered  in \n1988 as a company under the PRC Company Law. Since 2003, it \nhas consolidated its operations in (i) wind power development; (ii) \nwaste  management,  including  biomass  power  generation;  (iii) \nwater  supply  and  sanitation;  and  (iv)  energy  efficiency  projects. \nCECIC  attaches  high  priority  to  wind  power  development  in  its \nlong-term  corporate  development  strategy.  With  a  total  of  996.5 \nmegawatt wind power facilities under operation, construction and \npreparation, CECIC has accumulated the capacity and experience \nto become an industry leader in designing, building, and operating \nlarge wind farms in the PRC.  \n \nEstablished in 1973 as Kumagai Gumi (Hong Kong) Limited, HKC \nhas  grown  over  the  last  35  years  into  one  of  Asia\u2019s  most \nspecialized \nfor  civil  engineering, \ninfrastructure construction, and energy development. Listed on the \nHong Kong Stock Exchange, HKC has focused its developmental \nstrategy  on  commercial  properties,  infrastructure  extension,  and \nalternative energy.  \n \nWithout  taking  into  consideration  revenues  from  the  sale  of \ncertified  emission  reductions,  the  Project  is  expected  to  yield  a \nfinancial  internal  rate  of  return  of  7.49%,  which  is  above  the \nweighted average cost of capital. The Project\u2019s economic internal \nrate  of  return  is  17.4%, which  indicates  strong  positive  economic \nexternalities and is higher than the social discount rate of 12.0%.  \n\ninvestors  and  contractors \n\nThe  Project  harnesses  wind  resources  on  undeveloped  land  and \naffects no indigenous peoples. As the site is vacant, resettlement \nis  not  needed.  Disturbances  during  construction  will  be  small, \ntransient,  and  properly  managed.  Perceptible  environmental \nimpacts during operation will be mostly noise and visual intrusion, \nbut  both  are  minimal  because  of  the  distance  between  the  wind \nturbines and the nearest settlements and the relatively low scenic \nvalue  of  the  project  site.  The  Borrower  has  formulated  a  social \nand  environmental  management  plan  and  allocated  sufficient \nfunds  to  implement  it  to  further  minimize  negative  environmental \nand  social  impacts  and  to  restore  and  protect  the  ecology  of  the \nproject site. \n \n\n \nFinancial and Economic \nPerformance of the \nProject \n \n \n \n \nEnvironmental and \nSocial Issues \n\n \n\n\fJustifications  \n\n \n\n \n\niii\n\ntoward \n\nresources \n\nrenewable \n\nThe  Project  merits  ADB  support  because  it  helps  promote \nin  Hebei  Province  and  diversifies \nsustainable  development \nelectricity  production \nin  an \nenvironmentally friendly way. The Project enhances public\u2013private \npartnerships  and  encourages  foreign  participation  in  wind  power \ngeneration,  which  is  crucial  for  the  further  development  of  the \nnascent sector. The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s strategies for \nthe  country  and  the  energy  sector.  Meanwhile,  the  Project  will \nsupport  the  efforts  of  leading  clean  energy  developers  to  adopt \nand  deploy  advanced  low-carbon  technologies  and  generate \nsignificant  demonstration  effects  to  encourage  other  renewable \nenergy projects in the country. \n \n\n \n\n\f115  00'Eo\n\n118  00'Eo\n\nZHANGBEI WIND POWER PROJECT\nIN THE\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\nProject County\n\nHebei Province\n\nNational Capital\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nProject Site\n\nNational Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nCounty Boundary\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\n42  00'No\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\n42  00'No\n\nN\n\n0\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nKilometers\n\n40  00'No\n\nS H A N X I\n\n0\n8\n-\n4\n2\n5\n5\na\n \nE\nG\n\nI N N E R     M O N G O L I A\n\nGuyuan\n\nFengning\n\nWeichang\n\nLonghua\n\nChengde\n\nKangbao\n\nZhangbei\n\nShangyi\n\nWangquan\n\n,\nHuai an\n\nYangyuan\n\nYu Xian\n\nChongli\n\nChicheng\n\nZhangjiakou\n\nXuanhua\n\nHuailai\n\nZhuolu\n\nPingguan\n\nKuancheng\n\nL I A O N I N G\n\nXinglong\n\nQinglong\n\nZunhua\n\nQianxi\n\nSanhe\n\nBEIJING\n\nYutian\n\nLulong\n\nTangshan\n\nFengnan\n\nLeting\n\nYongqing\n\nTianjin\n\nTanghai\n\nQinhuangdao\n\nChangli\n\n40  00'No\n\nB o h a i     S e a\n\nLaiyuan\n\nLaishui\n\nZhuozhou\n\nYixian\n\nDingxing\n\nGaobeidian\n\nXushui\n\nRongcheng\n\nMancheng\n\nShunping\n\nXongxian\n\nBazhou\n\n,\nWen an\n\nAnxin\n\nBaoding\n\nQingyuan\n\nGaoyang\n\nDaicheng\n\nRenqiu\n\nHejian\n\nFuping\n\nTang Xian\n\nQuyang\n\nXingtang\n\n115  00'Eo\n\nDingzhou\n\nLixian\n\nQing Xian\n\n118  00'Eo\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe  CECIC  HKE  Wind  Power  Co.,  Ltd.,  for  the  Zhangbei  Wind  Power  Project  (the  Project)  in  the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  and  the  development \neffectiveness framework are in Appendixes 1 and 2. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nEnergy Sector Performance and Challenges in the PRC \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe PRC has Asia\u2019s largest and fastest-growing energy sector, which has expanded at an \naverage  annual  rate  of  5.5%  since  1988  to  support  rapid  economic  growth  and  massive \nurbanization. The PRC\u2019s developmental goal of quadrupling its per capita gross domestic product \n(GDP)  by  2020  from  its  2000  level  and  its  currently  low  energy  consumption  per  capita  indicate \npotential for strong growth in demand for energy for many years to come.1 The PRC attained a low \naverage energy\u2013GDP elasticity of 0.47 between 1980 and 2000. However, this elasticity increased \nsharply  to  1.4  during  the  period  between  2001  and  2005,  due  mainly  to  swift  industrialization, \ninfrastructure  development,  and  expanded  household  and  commercial  consumption.  To  alleviate \nchronic  electricity  shortages  that  had  constrained  economic  development  in  many  provinces,  the \nPRC  installed  over  205  gigawatts  (GW)  of  power  generation  capacity  in  2006  and  2007. 2 \nExcessive reliance on coal (accounting for 69% of the total primary energy supply) and increasing \ndependence  on  imported  oil  (accounting  for  more  than  40%  of  the  total  oil  consumption)  have \ncaused  serious  concerns  about  environmental  degradation  and  energy  insecurity  and  could \nsignificantly affect global climate change and world energy markets.  \n \n3. \nCoal,  the  most  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)-intensive  fossil  fuel,  has  been  dominating  energy \nproduction and power  generation in the PRC.3 About 82%  of electricity was produced by burning \ncoal in 2007. The costs in terms of resource depletion, environmental deterioration, mining safety, \nand  public  health  associated  with  producing,  transporting,  and  consuming  coal  are  not  fully \nreflected  in  coal  prices.  Cleaner  and  renewable  energy  has  been  put  at  a  disadvantage  vis-\u00e0-vis \ncoal,  which  has  been  implicitly  subsidized  for  decades.  Pollution  caused  by  high  coal  usage  is \naggravated by the economy\u2019s relatively low energy efficiency, which requires about 3.5 times more \nenergy  per  unit  of  economic  output  than  the  world  average.  Acid  rain  falls  on  one  third  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  territory  and  nearly  half  of  its  farmland.  If  current  trends  are  not  effectively  curtailed, \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will increase rapidly, which will exacerbate global warming and \ninflict  heavy  social,  economic,  and  environmental  damage.  The  poor  would  suffer  first  and \nforemost, and remain the most vulnerable. \n \n4. \nRecognizing  that  the  current  energy  growth  trajectory  dominated  by  fossil  fuels  is  neither \nenvironmentally  sustainable  nor  economically  desirable,  the  Government  of  the  PRC  (the \nGovernment)  has  made  strong  commitments,  established  a  series  of  mandatory  targets,  and \nadopted incentive-based policies to improve energy efficiency, diversify the energy supply mix into \nrenewable  sources,  reduce  emissions,  and  abate  global  warming  and  climate  change.  In  its \nmedium- and long-term renewable energy development program promulgated in August 2007, the \nGovernment set the goal of producing 15% of its primary energy from renewable sources by 2020, \n\n                                                 \n1  Annual per capita electricity consumption in the PRC was relatively low at 2,500 kWh in 2007, which is about a quarter \n\nof the 9,786 kWh in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries in 2005.  \n\n2  The  incremental  capacity  of  205  GW  is  larger  than  the  combined  generation  capacity  of  Germany  and  the  United \n\nKingdom in 2005 (198 GW) and is equivalent to building two 1.0 GW power plants every week. \n\n3  As the world\u2019s largest coal-producing and -consuming country, the PRC doubled its coal use within 5 years between \n2002  and  2007,  when  the  total  coal  production  reached  2.6  billion  tons.  More  than  55%  of  coal  is  used  to  generate \nelectricity, with the rest used for industrial processes, space heating, and household consumption. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n  \n\nWind Power Development in the PRC \n\nup  from  7.5%  in  2005.  Development  plans  have  been  formulated  to  raise  the  share  of  electricity \nproduction  from  renewable  sources  from  8%  in  2007  to  20%  by  2020,  mainly  by  constructing  30 \nGW of wind power (an increase of nearly 5 times from 6.1 GW in 2007), 20 GW of biomass and \nbiogas power, and 300 GW of hydropower. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nThe PRC\u2019s vast land area and long coastline are endowed with abundant wind resources. \nThe  China  Meteorology  Bureau  concluded  that,4 without  taking  into  account  the  Qinghai-Tibetan \nPlateau,  technically  exploitable  wind  energy  resources  at  a  height  of  10  meters  (m)  above  the \nground  could  reach  2,548  GW.  About  75%  of  the  PRC\u2019s  rich  onshore  wind  resources  are \nconcentrated in the northwestern grasslands and the Gobi Desert, stretching from Inner Mongolia \nthrough  Hebei,  Ningxia,  and  Gansu  to  Xinjiang.5 A  summary  on  wind  power  development  in  the \nPRC is presented in Appendix 3. \n \n6. \nThe  legal  and  regulatory  environment  for  renewable  energy  development  has  steadily \nimproved in recent years. The Renewable Energy Law, which became effective in January 2006, \nand  its  implementing  policies  provide  financial  stimulation  for  renewable  energy,  including  the \nestablishment  of  national  and  regional  renewable  energy  funds,  the  improvement  of  access  to \nproject  financing,  and  specific  tax  preferences.  It  has  reduced  risks  for  project  developers  by \nmandating  power  grid  interconnection  and  full  power  offtake,  as  well  as  by  providing  guaranteed \nminimum  prices  or  subsidies  for  certain  types  of  renewable  energy.  For  wind  power  projects \napproved by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the Renewable Energy \nLaw and its implementing policies require that (i) the grid utility be responsible for the construction \nof  interconnecting  transmission  lines;  (ii)  the  grid  utility  purchase  all  electricity  generated;  (iii)  the \ntariff  for  uploading  electricity  to  the  power  grid  be  determined  through  a  nationwide  concession \nbidding process; and (iv) the gap between the wind electricity tariff and the average electricity tariff \nbe  shared  across  the  whole  power  grid  through  a  levy  on  each  kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  of  electricity \npurchased by end users.  \n \n7. \nFiscal incentives are provided to accelerate wind power development. The value-added tax \n(VAT) for wind power projects was reduced from 17% to 8.5%, since no fuel costs can be deducted \nfor wind power generation. The corporate income tax (at 25% of the gross profit) is waived for the \nfirst  3  years  for  wind  farms  constructed  in  the  underdeveloped  western  region,  which  includes \nHebei  and  Inner  Mongolia.  Interest  during  construction  is  partly  subsidized.  Further,  the \nGovernment  is  considering  adopting  a  mandatory  quota  system  on  renewable  energy  generation \nfor  independent  power  producers.  Meanwhile,  wind  power  development  is  a  high-priority  of  the \nnational  Clean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM),  enabling  wind  farms  with  more  than  50% \ndomestic  ownership  to  sell  certified  emission  reduction  (CER)  certificates  under  the  terms  of  the \nUnited Nations\u2019 Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change. By September 2008, 39 wind power projects \nwere successfully registered with the United Nations\u2019 CDM executive board. \n \n8. \nThe  PRC  has  strived  to  develop  its  wind  resources  over  the  last  2  decades  but  had \naccumulated  only  345  megawatt  (MW)  of  installed  capacity  by  2000,  equivalent  to  a  small  coal-\nfired  power  plant.  However,  since  the  enactment  of  the  Renewable  Energy  Law,  the  PRC  has \nmade rapid strides in harnessing wind resources, doubling its wind power generation capacity each  \n \n\n                                                 \n4  The PRC National Climate Center. 2006. The China Wind Resource Assessment Report. Beijing. \n5  Within  this  narrow  strip  of  about  200  km,  the  wind  power  density  normally  ranges  from  200  watts  per  square  meter \n\n(W/m2) to 300 W/m2 and can reach above 500 W/m2 in some regions with more favorable conditions. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nyear.6 According  to  the  Global  Wind  Energy  Council,  3,155  wind  turbines  with  a  total  capacity  of \n3.45 GW were installed in the PRC in 2007. This addition raised the PRC\u2019s cumulative wind power \ncapacity  to  6.1  GW,7 which  consists  of  158  wind  farms  across  21  provinces.  Another  4.2  GW  of \nwind power projects had been approved by the Government and were under construction in 2007.8   \n \nDespite  its  rapid  development  in  recent  years,  wind  power  remains  insignificant  in  the \n9. \nnation\u2019s  overall  power  mix,  accounting  for  only  0.9%  in  its  overall  power  generation  capacity  of \n713.6  GW  and  a  meager  0.4%  in  its  total  electricity  output  of  3,263.2  terawatt-hours  (TWh)  in \n2007.9 Even doubling the current national target for wind power development by 2020 to 60.0 GW \nwill leave the wind power share below 5.0% of the estimated total power generation capacity in the \ncountry,  which  could  grow  to  1,200.0  GW  at  a  moderate  average  annual  growth  rate  of  4.1% \nduring the 13-year period between 2007 and 2020.  \n \nCurrently,  more  than  90%  of  wind  farms  are  developed  by  large  state-owned  enterprises \n10. \n(SOEs),  especially  large  power  companies.  Many  private  sector  companies  have  demonstrated \ninterest  in  developing  wind  farms  but  have  found  that  the  financial  returns  on  wind  power \ninvestment  are  low,  up-front  costs  for  conducting  wind  resource  assessment  and  obtaining  all \nnecessary  permits  and  authorizations  are  high,  and  technological  uncertainties  are  difficult  to \nhandle.  Large  SOEs  have  clear  mandates  from  the  Government  to  implement  the  medium-  and \nlong-term  renewable  energy  development  program.  They  also  have  relatively  stronger  technical \ncapacity to undertake big wind power projects and larger asset portfolios to achieve economies of \nscale and absorb the risks of deploying new and advanced technologies.   \n \nC. \n \n11. \nHebei has a fast-growing but energy-intensive economy.  With a population of 67.4 million \non  a  land  area  of  188,000  square  kilometers  (km2),  Hebei  had  a  GDP  of  CNY1,386.4  billion  in \n2007, having achieved an average annual growth rate of 12.8% during the previous 5 years. More \nthan  80%  of  the  province\u2019s  total  industrial  outputs  are  produced  by  seven  leading  industries.10 \nEnergy consumption per CNY10,000 of GDP in Hebei was 1.84 tons (t) of standard coal equivalent \nin 2007, which is 59% higher than the national average of 1.16 t.   \n \nHebei faces substantial challenges for poverty alleviation and sustainable development. In \n12. \nspite of its fast growth, Hebei\u2019s per capita consumption in 2006 of CNY4,945 was 19% below the \nnational average of CNY6,111. Still, 39 of 592 nationally recognized impoverished counties are in \nHebei,  including  Zhangbei  County,  where  the  Project  is  located.  About  83%  of  Zhangbei\u2019s \npopulation of 370,800 in 2007 lived in rural areas, earning subsistence income from poor soils and \nremaining vulnerable to inclement climate. In 2006, the county\u2019s GDP was CNY2.5 billion, and the \nnet income per farmer was merely CNY2,773, which is less than $1 per day and among the lowest \nlevels  in  the  PRC.  To  ensure  the  sustainability  of  its  economic  growth,  Hebei  needs  to  carefully \n                                                 \n6  In the medium- and long-term renewable energy development program, the national target for cumulative wind power \ncapacity  was  set  at  5  GW  by  2010  and  30  GW  by  2020.  The  original  goal  for  2010  was  achieved  3 years  early,  in \n2007, and was therefore raised to 10 GW. The reality is evolving so fast that this revised goal of 10 GW is likely to be \nexceeded in 2008 and could be raised again to a level surpassing 20 GW. \n\nDevelopment Challenges in Hebei Province \n\n7  The PRC\u2019s total wind power capacity ranked fifth in the world in 2007, after Germany (22.3 GW), United States (16.8 \n\nGW), Spain (15.1 GW), and India (8.0 GW). \n\n8  While the wind power capacity addition accounted for about 30% of the total incremental power generation capacity in \nthe United States and 40% in Europe in 2007, wind power accounted for less than 3% of newly commissioned capacity \nin  the  PRC  in  2006  and  2007.  Most  new  power  generation  facilities  are  going  to  burn  coal  and  emit  CO2  for  many \ndecades to come. \n\n9  The current ratio between the electricity output and the generation capacity of wind power in the PRC reflects serious \nwind resource underutilization in existing wind farms, mainly caused by inadequate wind farm management, obsolete \ntechnologies, and poor equipment reliability. \n\n10 These  industries  are  (i)  iron  and  steel,  accounting  for  more  than  20%  of  the  national  total;  (ii)  machinery;  (iii) \npetrochemicals; (iv) chemicals and pharmaceuticals; (v) food processing; (vi) construction materials; and (vii) textiles. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n  \n\naddress such constraining issues as limited water resources, sharp increases in energy demand, \nand rising pressures for environmental protection. \n \n13. \nEnergy  consumption  has  severely  outpaced  energy  production  in  Hebei  in  recent  years, \ncausing frequent brownouts. Electricity production in Hebei grew by 12.7% in 2007, amounting to \n164.6  TWh  generated  from  a  total  installed  capacity  of  30.2  GW.  However,  this  expansion  could \nsatisfy only 80% of electricity consumption in the province, which grew by 16.1% in 2007 to 204.1 \nTWh, leading to a high electricity\u2013GDP growth ratio of 1.26.11 This boom in demand for electricity \npushed  up  prices  on  coal  for  power  generation  in  Hebei  by  18.4%,  from  CNY380/t  in  2006  to \nCNY450/t in 2007. \n \n14. \nRapid growth in electricity demand in the northern PRC will continue. According to the 11th \nFive-Year  Development  Plan  for  the  North  China  Power  Grid  (NCPG),  both  the  load  volume  and \nelectricity usage in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan area are estimated to double between 2006 and \n2020.  \n \n\nElectricity Demand Forecast, Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Tangshan Power Grid \n \n\nItem \nElectricity Usage (GWh) \nGrowth Index (2005=100) \n \nMaximum Load (GW) \nGrowth Index (2005=100) \n\n2005 \n 1,305 \n 100  \n\n 23 \n 100  \n\n2010 \n 1,740  \n 133  \n\n  32 \n 139  \n\n2015 \n 2,194 \n 168  \n\n  42 \n 183  \n\n2020 \n 2,663 \n 204 \n\n52 \n 226 \n\nGW = gigawatt, GWh = gigawatt-hour. \nSource: The North China Grid Company Limited. \n\nADB Operations \n\n \n15. \nAbout 97% of power distributed by the NCPG is generated from coal-burning. Hydropower \noptions  are  scant  in  the  region.  Significant  capacity  expansion  in  thermal  power  generation \nsubstantially  increased  demand  for  coal  and  GHG  emissions.  To  diversify  electricity  supply  into \nrenewable  sources,  abundant  wind  resources  in  Hebei  and  Inner  Mongolia  must  be  effectively \nutilized, as pioneered by wind power development in Zhangbei. Because of its rich wind resources, \nproximity to Beijing, excellent transportation network, and convenience for power grid integration, \nZhangbei was selected by NDRC as the PRC\u2019s first 1.0 GW wind power development district.  \n  \nD. \n \n16. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  promotes  inclusive,  efficient,  equitable,  and \nsustainable  economic  growth  to  eliminate  poverty  across  the  Asia  and  Pacific  region.  In  its  long-\nterm  strategic  framework  2008\u20132020  (Strategy  2020),  ADB  identified  energy  as  one  of  five  core \noperational areas and achieving environmental sustainability as one of three strategic development \npriorities.12 ADB\u2019s  operational  focus  for  the  energy  sector  hinges  on  addressing  energy  security \nand climate change by improving energy efficiency and enlarging the use of indigenous clean and \nrenewable energy. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC (2008\u20132010) concentrates on \nachieving  balanced  and  sustainable  growth  with  more  efficient  uses  of  resources  and  more \nstringent protection of the environment.13 In recent years, ADB has introduced new initiatives (e.g., \nthe  Energy  Efficiency  Initiative  and  the  Carbon  Market  Initiative  [CMI])  and  adopted  more  client-\noriented operational modalities (e.g., multitranche financing facilities) to reinforce its assistance to \ndeveloping  member  countries\u2019  acquisition  of  low-carbon  technologies  and  implementation  of \nenergy efficiency and renewable energy projects. \n\n                                                 \n11 Electricity consumption per CNY10,000 of GDP in Hebei actually increased from 1,487.6 kWh in 2005 to 1,515.9 kWh \n\nin 2006 and then to 1,579.8 kWh in 2007, for an increase of 6.2% in 2 years. \n\n12  ADB. 2008.

The ensuing \nproject loan, approved in 2000, included three wind power projects with a total capacity of 78 MW \nin Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and the provinces of Heilongjiang and Liaoning.15 However, \nin 2004, the Government withdrew the request and sought termination of the loan, mainly for lack \nof  agreement  with  the  provincial  governments  regarding  appropriate  tariffs.  ADB  continued  its \npolicy dialogue with the Government on the need for a better regime to select wind power project \ndevelopers  competitively  and  to  establish  the  wind  power  tariff  transparently,  with  greater \nparticipation  by  the  private  sector  and  improved  capacity  in  the  domestic  manufacturing  industry. \nThese issues have been largely addressed following the enactment of the Renewable Energy Law. \n \n18. \nThe Project will extend ADB\u2019s continued support for the implementation of the PRC\u2019s 11th \nFive-Year  Development  Plan  (2006\u20132010),  which  attaches  high  priority  to  energy  efficiency, \nrenewable energy, and pollution reduction, as well as specifically requiring that financial assistance \nfrom  international  financial  institutions  be  used  for  resource  conservation,  environmental \nimprovement, and infrastructure development. The Project will learn and incorporate lessons from \nADB\u2019s earlier renewable energy projects, with the emphasis on improving project design, financing \nstructure, risk mitigation, implementation arrangements, and demonstration effects. \n \n19. \nADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  operations  have  traditionally  focused  on  assisting  private  sector \nenterprises.  The  proposed  Project  explores  an  innovative  approach  to  support  renewable  energy \ndevelopment led by a large SOE and implemented by a Sino-foreign joint venture. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nProject Description \n\n \nA. \n \n20. \nThrough  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  organized  by  NDRC,  China  Energy \nConservation  Investment  Corporation  (CECIC)  won  concession  rights  for  25  years  to  develop  a \nwind  power  project  of  100.5  MW  on  a  build-operate-own  basis  at  L\u00fcnaobao  in  Zhangbei.  The \nProject is the sixth wind power farm developed by CECIC in Zhangbei and is strategically situated \nbetween the load centers of Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan and the southeastern rim of the Inner \nMongolia  Plateau,  where  wind  energy  resources  are  exceptionally  abundant. 16  More  than  10 \ncompanies are currently developing or operating wind farms in or near Zhangbei. The project site \nis well connected by road and close to the main power transmission network. \n \n21.  Within  a  land  area  of  4,182  km2,  Zhangbei  experiences  frequent  and  strong  southbound \nwinds,  which  rapidly  sweep  from  Siberia  toward  the  North  China  Plain.  The  commercially \nexploitable  wind  resources  in  Zhangbei  are  estimated  to  be  5.0  GW.  The  average  annual  wind \nvelocity is 8.4 meters per second (m/s), and the average annual wind energy density is 492.3 watts \nper  square  meter  (w/m2)  at  a  height  of  70  m.  The  frequencies  for  five  wind  directions  sum  up  to \n71.5%. The probability for the wind velocity ranging between 3 m/s and 25 m/s stands at 99.96%. \n\n                                                 \n14 ADB. 1998.

Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for the Wind Power Development Project. Manila (Loan 1818-PRC for $58 million). \n\n16 The  project  site  is  centered  at  114o32\u201930\u201d  east  longitude  and  41o03\u201950\u201d  north  latitude,  about  242  km  northwest  of \n\nBeijing. The altitude of the project site ranges from 1,500 m to 1,600 m above the mean sea level. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n  \n\nThe once-every-50-years maximum wind velocity averaged over a 10-minute interval is estimated \nto be 41.1 m/s. \n \n22. \nThe  Project  will  install  67  wind  turbine  generators  (WTGs)  on  ridges  ascending  from \nnorthwest to southeast, perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction. Each WTG will have a rotor \ndiameter of 77.0 m, a hub height of 61.5 m, and a rated output of 1.5 MW. Under the equipment \nsupply contract, the manufacturer provides a 24 month warranty, which guarantees a per unit WTG \nyield  curve  of  no  less  than  95%  of  the  guaranteed  value  and  an  average  WTG  availability  of  no \nless than 95% of the applicable availability percentage for all units of the wind farm collectively.  \n \n23. \nThe  power  generated  by  WTGs  will  be  stepped  up  from  0.69  kilovolts  (kV)  to  35  kV  and \nthen pooled through a power collection system to a substation located inside the wind farm.  The \npooled  power  will  be  further  stepped  up  to  220  kV  and  metered  at  the  substation.  Finally,  the \npower will be fed from the substation into NCPG through 220 kV lines.  \n \n24. \n\nThe main activities for the Project consist of the following: \n(i) \n\nconstructing a paved access road of 1.8 kilometers (km) from the main road to the \nwind farm and internal service roads branching to individual WTGs; \nlaying  foundations  for  67  towers,  67  transformers,  and  1  substation,  including \nexcavation,  backfilling  thick  slabs  of  reinforced  concrete,  and  restoring  the \nsurrounding ground; \nerecting 67 towers and installing and testing 67 WTGs; \ninstalling and testing 67 box-type 35 kV transformers of 1.6 megavolt amperes and \na 220 kV voltage-upstaging substation of 120 megavolt amperes;  \ninstalling power collection cables and lightning protection devices;  \ninstalling a monitoring, control, and data-collection system to serve all WTGs; \nconstructing offices, warehouses for spare parts, and a dormitory for 30 workers and \ntechnicians who will carry out daily operation and maintenance (O&M) works; and \nconducting site vegetation recovery and maintenance.  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n \n25. \nIn addition to adopting advanced WTGs that can extract more energy from the same swept \narea  than  most  conventional  designs,  the  Project  will  introduce  two  new  features:  (i)  weather \npattern  analysis  that  will  improve  predictability  and  thus  dispatch  scheduling  of  wind  power \ngeneration, which is a key concern regarding most forms of renewable energy, and (ii) an improved \nO&M  regime  that  strengthens  reliability,  reduces  WTG  downtime,  and  enhances  overall  cost-\neffectiveness during the whole operation period of the wind farm. \n \n26. \nThe Project has obtained certain regulatory and statutory approvals and permits, including \nthe  formal  project  approval  from  NDRC,  power  grid  integration  agreement  from  the  State  Power \nGrid  Company  and  approval  on  the  environmental  impact  assessment  from  the  Hebei \nEnvironmental Protection Bureau.  \n \n27. \nSite preparation for the Project started in early 2008. The contracts for procuring WTGs and \ntowers  were  concluded  in  mid-2008  through  NCB.  Civil  and  electric  works  will  be  completed  by \nqualified  contractors  selected  on  a  quality  and  cost  basis  through  NCB.  An  experienced \nindependent project-supervision team is engaged to ensure implementation on time, within budget, \nand of high quality. Project completion is planned for the end of 2009. Procurement processes so \nfar meet all governmental requirements. The main goods and services are procured competitively \nfrom the market, and all are from ADB member countries. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nProject Sponsors \n\nB. \n \n28. \nThe  project  sponsors  are  CECIC  and  HKC  (Holdings)  Limited  (HKC).  Both  have  vast \nindustry experience and strong financial capability for developing renewable energy projects in the \nPRC. They are now jointly developing three wind power projects with a combined capacity of 500 \nMW.17 CECIC  and  HKC  have  also  collaborated  in  implementing  and  operating  a  waste-to-energy \ncogeneration project in Linyi, Shandong Province.18  \n \n29. \nA Sino\u2013foreign joint venture indirectly owned by CECIC and HKC will be established under \nthe name of the CECIC HKE Wind Power Co., Ltd., and registered with the Ministry of Commerce \nof the PRC as a special purpose vehicle to implement the Project. Such a joint-venture structure \nlays down a solid foundation for enhancing corporate governance, ensuring financial transparency, \nand  channeling  foreign  borrowings.19 The  joint  venture  will  derive  strong  management,  technical, \nand  financial  support  from  its  parent  companies.  A  description  of  the  joint-venture  partners  is \npresented in the following sections and Appendix 4. \n \n\n1. \n\nThe China Energy Conservation Investment Corporation \n\n \n30.  With  headquarters  in  Beijing,  CECIC  is  a  Government-owned  corporation  administered \ndirectly  by  the  State-Owned  Assets  Supervision  and  Administration  Commission  of  the  State \nCouncil. CECIC is the sole national SOE in the PRC specifically tasked with designing, financing, \nand  operating  projects  to  improve  energy  efficiency,  develop  renewable  energy,  and  protect  the \nenvironment. CECIC started in the early 1980s in response to the second international oil crisis as \nthe  Energy  Conservation  Planning  Bureau  in  the  former  State  Planning  Commission,  the \nforerunner of NDRC. It was empowered with the responsibility to allocate and manage state energy \nconservation  investment  funds.  In  1988,  the  State  Council  commercialized  these  functions  and \nregistered CECIC as a corporation with its own legal identity under the PRC Company Law. \n \ntoward  comprehensively  utilizing  and \n31. \nconserving resources, including energy and water, and building an environmentally friendly society, \nCECIC  has  pioneered  new  technologies  and  developed  demonstration  projects  for  energy \nefficiency and pollution control. In the past 20 years, CECIC has completed more than 3,000 large \nand important energy conservation and renewable energy development projects in 13 subsectors \nin  more  than  300  municipalities. 20  Total  accumulated  investment  exceeded  CNY55.0  billion, \nserving  both  fast-growing  coastal  provinces  and  resource-abundant  inland  regions.  Currently, \nCECIC  treats  and  recycles  more  than  2.0  million  ton  (Mt)  of  industrial  wastes  and  260  Mt  of \nwastewater per year. These projects have delivered significant environmental benefits, including (i) \nannual  energy  savings  equal  to  45.8  Mt  of  standard  coal,  (ii)  annual  chemical  oxygen  demand \nreductions  amounting  to  75,000  t,  and  (iii)  annual  CO2  emission  reductions  of  105.0  Mt.  Looking \nahead,  CECIC  has  set  new  investment  targets  that  can  additionally  save  4.3  Mt  of  coal,  reduce \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  commitments \n\nTo  support \n\n                                                 \n17 The  other  two  wind  power  projects  are  (i)  the  2006  national  concession  project  of  200  MW  at  Danjinghe,  Zhangbei, \nHebei, with a total investment of CNY1.6 billion by CECIC (60%) and HKC (40%), which is less than 20 km away from \nthe proposed project site, and (ii) the 2007 national concession project of 200 MW at Changma, Gansu.  \n\n18 This  waste-to-energy  plant,  operational  from  2007,  is  jointly  owned  and  operated  by  CECIC  (60%)  and  HKC  (40%). \nThe total investment was CNY260 million. Using circulating fluidized bed technology, the plant processes 300,000 t of \nwaste, generates 200 GWh of electricity, and supplies 1.8 million gigajoules of heat annually. It derives revenues from \nthe garbage processing fee and sales of electricity, steam, and ash, as well as from CDM credits. \n\n19 According to existing investment guidelines, a joint venture with more than 25% foreign equity is authorized to borrow \nlong-term from foreign sources up to the gap between the total project cost and the sponsors\u2019 equity contributions. \n20 These include  450 cogeneration projects  with a combined capacity of 10,000 MW, more than 100 urban natural gas \nsupply and distribution projects with a combined capacity of 13.93 million cubic meters per day, district heating projects \nservicing more than 200 million square meters, coal washing and treatment with the capacity of 59.7 Mt per year, and \nwastewater  treatment  with  the  capacity  of  110  million  cubic  meter  per  year  for  paper  making  and  food  processing \nindustries.  \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n  \n\nCO2  emissions  by  11.1  Mt,  cut  chemical  oxygen  demand  by  0.4  Mt,  and  process  5.0  Mt  of \nindustrial wastes per year by 2012.  \n \n32. \nCECIC  currently  owns  or  holds  majority  shares  of  15  second-level  subsidiary  companies \nand more than 60 third-level subsidiary companies. To grow further, CECIC intends to raise more \nequity  capital  through  an  initial  public  offering  in  a  domestic  or  international  stock  exchange  in \nabout  3  years.  In  its  long-term  corporate  development  strategy,  CECIC  concentrates  80%  of  its \ntotal  assets  in  the  following  four  areas:  (i)  wind  power  development;  (ii)  waste  management, \nincluding biomass power generation; (iii) water supply, wastewater treatment, and sanitation; and \n(iv)  energy  efficiency  improvement  and  resource  conservation.  In  recent  years,  CECIC  has \nimproved  its  corporate  governance  structure  and  formulated  an  action  plan  to  fulfill  its  corporate \nsocial responsibilities. \n \nTo break bottlenecks in WTG supplies and to absorb advanced wind power technologies, \n33. \nCECIC  acquired  50%  of  the  second-largest  domestic  WTG  manufacturer,  the  Zhejiang  Windey \nWind  Generating  Engineering  Co.,  Ltd.,  (Zhejiang  Windey)  in  June  2006.  Zhejiang  Windey  has \nmature technologies for 800 kilowatt (kW) WTGs and is now designing and manufacturing 1.5 MW \nWTGs in cooperation with a leading European wind turbine design company.  \n \n34. \nCECIC\u2019s  investment  in  wind  power  development  is  channeled  through  its  wholly  owned \nsubsidiary specialized in wind energy investment, the CECIC Wind Power Investment Co. (CECIC-\nWPI),  which  was  established  in  January  2006.  For  specific  projects  in  different  locations,  project \ncompanies are set up to work with different equity partners and long-term debt providers. \n\n \n\nCECIC-WPI  has  accumulated  sufficient  capacity  and  experience  to  become  an  industry \n35. \nleader  in  implementing  and  operating  large  wind  farms.  CECIC-WPI  now  takes  the  lead  in  (i) \noperating  four  wind  farms  with  a  combined  capacity  of  244.5  MW  in  Hebei  and  Xinjiang; \n(ii) constructing  two  new  wind  farms  with  a  combined  capacity  of  249.5  MW  in  Zhangbei,  Hebei; \nand (iii) developing three wind farms with a combined capacity of 502.5 MW in Hebei and Gansu. \nAiming to occupy 10% of the PRC\u2019s wind power market, CECIC-WPI has conducted wind resource \nmeasurement and reserved developmental rights in Inner Mongolia, Hainan, and Fujian for about \n2,000  MW  and  has  plans  to  harness  1,500  MW  of  wind  power  by  2012.  CERs  from  five  CECIC \nwind farms have been successfully registered with the CDM executive board.  \n \n36. \nCooperation  between  CECIC  and  ADB  started  in  1998  when  ADB  funded  a  small-scale \ntechnical  assistance  project  to  assess  and  enhance  CECIC\u2019s  capacity. 21  While  CECIC  was \ngenerally  considered  to  be  a  strong  SOE,  certain  internal  requirements  of  the  PRC  prevented \nADB\u2019s sovereign assistance. \n \n\n2. \n\nHKC (Holdings) Limited \n\n \n37. \nEstablished in 1973 as Kumagai Gumi (Hong Kong) Limited, HKC has grown over the past \n35  years  to  become  one  of  Asia\u2019s  specialized  investors,  developers,  and  contractors  in  civil \nengineering,  infrastructure,  energy,  and  building  development.  HKC  has  gained  reputation  and \nexperience  in  designing  and  implementing  large  infrastructure  projects,  most  notably  in  Hong \nKong,  China,  and  the  PRC.  It  has  built  or  engineered  some  of  the  world\u2019s  most  impressive \nconstruction projects, including the world\u2019s 7th, 8th, and 11th tallest buildings.  \n \n\n                                                 \n21 ADB.  1997.

The technical assistance assessed CECIC\u2019s capacity \nto serve as an intermediary utilizing ADB financing. \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\n38. \nHKC\u2019s long-term development strategy focuses on property, infrastructure, and alternative \nenergy in the PRC and other regions in Asia. Its investments in the PRC have focused mainly in \nthe following areas:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\ninvestment.  Capitalizing  on \n\nProperty \nits  extensive  PRC  relationships  and \nconstruction  expertise,  HKC  has  made  large  investments  in  real  estate  markets  in \nBeijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Tianjin, and Nanxun.  \nInfrastructure development.  HKC has invested in several infrastructure projects in \nthe PRC, including a toll road in Guilin and a water treatment facility in Hainan. \nAlternative  energy.  HKC  has  made  sizeable investments  in  clean  and  renewable \nenergy in the PRC, expanding its involvement in the wind power, biofuel, and waste-\nto-energy  businesses,  and  planning  to  develop  more  wind  farms  in  Heilongjiang, \nHebei, Gansu, and Inner Mongolia.   \n\nProject Operational and Financial Performance \n\nHKC\u2019s financial practices and information disclosure are regulated by the Stock Exchange \n\n \nHKC  conducted  its  initial  public  offering  in  1987  on  the  Stock  Exchange  of  Hong  Kong \n39. \n(Stock No. 0190). In April 2004, Creator Holdings Limited became HKC\u2019s majority shareholder. As \npart  of  HKC\u2019s  restructuring,  Cerberus  Asia  Capital  Management,  LLC,  and  Penta  Investment \nAdvisers, Ltd., took major equity stakes in October 2007, and are now the second and third largest \nstakeholders  in  HKC,  respectively.  In  recognition  of  its  rapid  growth  and  increasing  business \ninfluence, HKC was selected as a constituent stock in the Hang Seng composite indexes, effective \nfrom 15 October 2008. \n \n40. \nIn  March  2008,  HKC  acquired  a  74.99%  interest  in  JIC  Technology  Company,  Ltd,  which \nwas also listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (Stock No. 987). The latter's name was then \nchanged  to  Hong  Kong  Energy  (Holdings),  Ltd.  (HKE).  All  of  HKC\u2019s  new  investment  in  the \nalternative  energy  business,  including  its  equity  contribution  to  the  proposed  Project,  will  be \nchanneled through HKE, which is now a majority-owned specialized subsidiary of HKC. \n \n41. \nof Hong Kong. \n \nC. \n \nThe  capacity  factor  of  the  Project  is  projected  to  be  28.5%,  yielding  2,497  hours  (h)  of \n42. \noperation at full-capacity equivalent to supply 250.9 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of clean electricity per \nyear. In accordance with the Renewable Energy Law, NCPG will construct transmission lines and \npurchase all the electricity generated by the Project. Recently, NDRC decided to implement a new \nscheduling and dispatch system to encourage energy-efficient and environmentally friendly power \ngeneration.  This  new  system  gives  first  priority  to,  and  maximizes  the  use  of,  renewable  energy \nthat  cannot  be  stored,  such  as  wind,  solar,  and  marine  energy,  as  well  as  run-of-the-river \nhydropower.  \n \n43. \nAs  one  of  five  regional  grids  under  the  State  Power  Grid,  NCPG  bears  responsibility  for \nsafeguarding  power  supply  to  the  PRC  capital,  Beijing,  and  providing  reliable  power  services  to \nsupport economic and social development in the northern PRC. Its grid covers a land area of 1.63 \nmillion  km2  and  serves  a  population  of  230  million.  By  2007,  the  total  installed  power  generation \ncapacity on NCPG was 145 GW, of which about 30% was in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan area. A \nbrief introduction to the power offtaker is provided in Appendix 5. \n \nA  tariff  of  CNY0.5006/kWh  for  the  first  30,000  h  of  full-capacity  operation,  including  the \n44. \nVAT,  has  been  determined  through  the  concession  bidding  process  and  approved  by  the \nGovernment. At this tariff, the Project's annual electricity sales revenue will be CNY125.6 million. \nAfter the first 30,000 h of full-capacity operation, which lasts for about 12 calendar years, the tariff \nwill be adjusted to the average for electricity uploaded to the power grid. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n  \n\n45. \nOn  29  June  2008,  NDRC  raised  the  tariff  for  thermal  power  plants  in  northern  Hebei  by \nCNY0.016/kWh  to  reflect  the  increased  coal  price.  For  new  thermal  power  plants  with \ndesulphurization  facilities  in  northern  Hebei,  the  upload  tariff  was  raised  to  CNY0.3664/kWh,  an \nincrease of 4.57%. A review of historic tariff adjustments yields a conservative assumption that the \nupload  tariff  will  continue  to  be  gradually  adjusted  by  an  average  annual  rate  of  2.5%.  This \nindicates that the average upload tariff for NCPG will be around CNY0.5177/kWh when the Project \nhas completed its first 30,000 h of full capacity equivalent operation.  \n \n46.  With  normal  wind  conditions,  the  Project  will  start  to  generate  financial  profits  in  the  first \nyear of its full operation, since it has stable sales revenues with a predetermined tariff and zero fuel \ncosts. Its direct operational costs are mainly for maintenance and repairs, and thus relatively small.  \nDue to the large up-front capital investment for the Project, depreciation and interest payments will \naccount for a big portion of the operational costs, especially in the early years during the Project's \noperational  period.  The  Project's  financial  asset  structure  will  improve  gradually  with  a  declining \ndebt\u2013equity ratio, since the long-term debts will be amortized over time.  \n \n47.  Without considering the revenues from the sale of CERs, the Project is expected to yield a \nfinancial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  of  7.49%,  which  is  above  the  weighted  average  cost  of \ncapital  at  2.75%.  With  revenues  from  CERs,  the  FIRR  will  be  enhanced  to  9.24%.  The  risk \ntolerance  levels  of  the  Project  have  been  stress-tested  with  breakeven  analysis,  sensitivity \nanalysis, and scenario comparison. The financial evaluation of the Project is presented in Appendix \n6. \n \n48. \nStrong  growth  in  electricity  consumption  in  the  northern  PRC  means  that  all  power \ngenerated  by  the  Project  will  be  used  to  meet  incremental  demand.  Value-added  and  corporate \nincome  taxes  from  the  Project  amount  to  CNY554.6  million  over  the  project  life,  contributing \nsubstantial fiscal revenues to support local development,22 which helps solidify government support \nfor  the  Project.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  stands  at  17.4%,  which  indicates  strong \npositive  economic  externalities  and  is  higher  than  the  social  discount  rate  of  12.0%.  Sensitivity \nanalyses  and  scenario  simulations  demonstrate  that  the  Project  is  economically  justifiable  and \nrobust under all foreseeable circumstances. The economic evaluation of the Project is presented in \nAppendix 7. \n \nD. \n \n49. \nThe  Project  has  been  classified  as  category  B  under  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002) \nbecause it is unlikely to create any significant adverse environmental impact during construction or \noperation.  A  comprehensive  environmental \nincluding \nenvironmental  and  social  site  visits  and  community  consultations,  was  completed  in  November \n2008  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  safeguard  policies  for  environmental  category  B  projects. \nThe summary initial environmental examination for the Project is presented in Appendix 8. \n \n50. \nThe  perceptible  negative  environmental  impacts  such  as  noise  and  visual  intrusion  are \nnegligible,  mainly  because  of  the  considerable  distance  between  the  turbines  and  the  nearest \nsettlements.  WTGs  will  not  endanger  migratory  birds  or  bats,  as  there  are  few  in  the  wind  farm \narea, which is not located in the main habitat or along the main migration routes of migratory birds. \nIn fact, extensive wind power development will help reduce wind speeds by extracting energy from \nair  flows,  and  thus  help  mitigate  the  sandstorms  that  frequently  affect  the  northern  PRC  and \nland \nthereby  reverse  desertification.  Disturbances  associated  with  construction  such  as \ndisturbance, vegetation clearance, construction noise, traffic congestion, and waste generation are \n\nEnvironmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n\nimpact  assessment \n\nthe  Project, \n\nfor \n\n                                                 \n22 Tax  contributions  from  businesses  related  to  wind  power  are  estimated  to  account  for  up  to  60%  of  the  total  fiscal \n\nrevenues of Zhangbei County. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nnormally  temporary  and  limited  in  scope.  Implementing  a  carefully  designed  social  and \nenvironmental  management  plan,  which  includes  monitoring  arrangements,  will  further  mitigate \nthese negative impacts. \n \n51. \nThe Project is classified as category C under ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). \nLand  acquired  for  it  is  mostly  barren  and  undeveloped,  requiring  minimal  arrangements  for  land \nacquisition  and  preparation.  WTGs  and  transmission  towers  will  be  erected  on  uninhabited  land \nand  will  not  cause  displacement,  affect  any  physical  structures,  necessitate  any  resettlement,  or \ncause any loss of livelihood. No indigenous or forest-dependent people live close to or within the \nproject  site.  Hence,  the  Project  is  classified  as  category  C  under  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous \nPeoples (1998), and an indigenous peoples\u2019 plan is not required. \n \nE. \n \n\nDevelopment Impact \n\n1. \n\nImpact, Outcome, and Output \n\n \nThe impact of the Project is reduced GHG emissions per unit of GDP in the PRC by at least \n52. \n15% by 2015 from its 2005 level. The outcome of the Project is an increased share of renewable \nenergy in total energy consumption in the PRC, from 7.5% in 2005 to 10% by 2010. The output of \nthe Project is the 100.5 MW wind power generation facility, power transformers, a booster station, \na  control  and  monitoring  system,  and  associated  infrastructure  and  ancillary  works  completed  on \ntime and within budget.  \n \n\n2. \n\nDevelopment Effectiveness \n\n \n53. \nThe  development  effectiveness  of  the  Project  has  been  assessed  in  terms  of  sustainable \neconomic  development,  inclusive  growth,  business  success,  and  private  sector  development, \nfollowing  the  guidelines  for  implementing  the  Good-Practice  Standards  for  Evaluation  of  Private \nSector Investment Operations as prepared by the Evaluation Cooperation Group of the multilateral \ndevelopment banks.23  \n \n54. \nThe  Project  promotes  sustainable  economic  development  by  (i)  providing  a  large  and \npredictable  amount  of  zero-emission  electricity  to  mitigate  power  shortages  in  the  northern  PRC \nthat have frequently constrained the development of regional manufacturing and service industries; \n(ii) replacing  the  usage  of  2.0  Mt  of  standard  coal  for  electricity  production  and  reducing  CO2 \nemissions  by  5.6  Mt  during  its  concession  period,  thereby  improving  the  local  environment  and \nabating  global  warming  and  climate  change;  and  (iii)  enhancing  the  country\u2019s  energy  security  by \nsubstituting energy imports with indigenous renewable energy sources equivalent to up to 1.5 Mt of \noil during its concession period. \n \nThe  Project  contributes  to  inclusive  growth  by  (i)  creating  job  opportunities  for  local \n55. \ncommunities  during  construction  and  operation  and  stimulating \nlocal \nmanufacturing  and  service  industries,  mostly  related  to  assembling,  transporting,  installing,  and \nrepairing  wind  power  equipment,  constructing  access  roads  and  foundations,  and  developing \necotourism  focused  on  wind  energy  capture  and  utilization;  (ii)  increasing  the  income  of  rural \nfamilies  through  land-lease  fees  and  the  purchase  of  local  products  and  services;  (iii)  improving \nphysical infrastructure by upgrading transport, power transmission, and telecommunication facilities \nin the region; (iv) enlarging the revenues of the local government by paying various local taxes and \nsurcharges, as well as fees for resource use; and (v) facilitating poverty alleviation targeted at the \n\nthe  expansion  of \n\n                                                 \n23 Multilateral  Development  Banks  Evaluation  Cooperation  Group.  2001.

The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is presented in Appendix 9. \n \n56. \nThe  Project  encourages  and  catalyzes  more  proactive  participation  by  the  private  sector \nand foreign investors in renewable energy development by (i) establishing a business model that \nprovides financial and technical assistance to enable a Sino-foreign joint venture to construct and \noperate a large wind power project, with the goal of quickly replicating this model in other relatively \nunderdeveloped  northwestern  provinces;  (ii)  delivering  demonstration  effects  for  future  private \nsector  investments  in  the  wind  power  sector  on  the  optimal  exploitation  of  wind  resources, \ndeployment of more efficient and reliable technologies, adoption of more prudent risk identification \nand  mitigation  practices,  and  introduction  of  international  standards  for  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards; and (iii) developing a nonsovereign financing modality to accelerate renewable energy \nprojects.  In  addition,  the  Project  helps  to  remove  uncertainties  for  wind  power  project  financing, \ngives  potential  investors  and  financiers  a  better  understanding  of  the  intrinsic  risk factors  in  wind \npower  development,  and  encourages  large  wind  power  projects  that  would  deliver  economy-of-\nscale benefits to reduce unit costs.   \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Proposed Loan \n\n \nA. \n \n57. \nThe proposed ADB loan will consist of a direct loan funded by ADB from its ordinary capital \nresources and, to the extent that cofinancing is made available under ADB\u2019s B loan program, a B \nloan funded by international banks. The loan funded by ADB from its ordinary capital resources will \nbe  for  up  to  $34.3 million,  with  a  tenor  of  14.5  years  from  the  date  of  the  first  disbursement, \nincluding  a grace  period  of  18  months.  The  interest  rate  and  finance charges  for the  loan  will  be \napproved  by  ADB\u2019s  pricing  and  credit  enhancement  committee.  To  the  extent  that  cofinancing  is \nmade available under ADB\u2019s B loan program, the loan will include a B loan for up to $56.2 million \nfunded by international banks. Any B loan will have a tenor of up to 14.5 years from the date of the \nfirst disbursement and be subject to such other terms and conditions as may be mutually agreed to \nby the Borrower and the participating banks, with the concurrence of ADB.     \n\n \nCertain  domestic  financial  institutions  have  expressed  interest  in  providing  local  currency \n58. \nfunding  to  the  Borrower  through  a  parallel  loan.  If  domestic  financial  institutions  participate  in \nfinancing the Borrower, the amount available for participation under the B loan will be diminished to \nthe extent of that participation. \n \n59. \nThe  proposed  loan  will  be  documented  in  a  loan  agreement  containing  terms  and \nconditions typically included in loans to private sector borrowers without governmental guarantees, \nas well as representations and covenants confirming or requiring compliance with ADB\u2019s policies. \nThe  loan  will  be  subject  to  conditions  precedent  to  disbursement,  including  all  contractual  and \nfinancial arrangements satisfactory to ADB. \n \nB. \n \n60. \n\nThe Project is suitable for ADB support mainly for the following reasons: \n(i) \n\nJustification \n\nIt  is  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  strategies  for  power  sector  reform  and \nrenewable  energy  development,  supporting  economic  growth  and  energy \ndiversification in an environmentally sustainable manner, and reducing the country\u2019s \ndependence  on  fossil  fuels.  The  Project  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy and energy sector road map, complementing ADB\u2019s efforts to help the PRC \nachieve a low-carbon growth pattern.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nIt stimulates financial innovation for renewable energy development. The CMI will be \nutilized to provide up-front financing against future credits from CERs.  \nThe  Project  promotes  public\u2013private  partnerships  in  clean  and  renewable  energy \ndevelopment.  ADB  plays  a  catalytic  role  to  mobilize  financing  and  risk-taking \ncapacity  from  reputable  international  and  domestic  financial  institutions  and  to  cut \ntransaction costs through appropriate loan syndication. \nThe Project directly contributes to mitigating global warming and climate change by \nconserving resources and reducing GHG emissions, as compared with a business-\nas-usual approach for generating electricity by combusting fossil fuels. \nThe  Project  helps  deliver  ADB\u2019s  value  addition.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  will  generate \nsignificant  demonstration  effects  for  other  wind  farms,  especially  in  the  areas  of \ndeploying  advanced  technologies,  improving  risk  identification  and  management, \nand introducing international standards for environmental and social safeguards. \nThe Project contributes to poverty reduction and promotes sustainable development \nin the project area. \n\n \nLarge  specialized  SOEs  in  the  PRC\u2019s  energy  sector  have  relatively  strong  financial  and \n61. \ninstitutional  capacity  to  implement  projects  that  adopt  advanced  technologies  carrying  certain \ninherent uncertainties. Once these advanced technologies have been successfully deployed, more \npublic and private sector sponsors and financiers will have a better understanding on the intrinsic \nrisks and be encouraged to develop and operate similar projects.   \n \nC. \n \nfinancially  viable,  economically  sustainable, \n62. \nenvironmentally  friendly,  and  fully  protected  by  the  national  Renewable  Energy  Law  and \nGovernment support for tariff determination, power grid integration, and uploading 100% of output. \nThe  main  risks  of  the  transaction  have  been  identified  and  their  mitigation  measures  have  been \ndesigned.  \n\nMain Risks and Mitigation Measures \n\nThe  Project \n\ntechnically \n\nreliable, \n\nis \n\n \nInvestment Limitations \n\nD. \n \nThe proposed loan will be within ADB\u2019s single, group, sector, and country exposure limits \n63. \nfor nonsovereign investments.

vast area and long coastline of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) are endowed \nwith  abundant  wind  resources.  According  to  the  Third  Nationwide  Survey  of  Wind  Energy \nResources organized by the China Meteorological Administration in 2004\u20132005, the PRC has a \ntotal  exploitable  wind  energy  reserve  of  4,350  gigawatts  (GW).  About  1,000  GW  onshore  and \n200  GW  offshore  can  be  commercially  developed  with  currently  existing  technologies.  The \nonshore wind resources, with wind power intensity of over 150 watts per square meter (W/m2), \nare located across 200,000 square kilometers (km2), at an average intensity of 5.0 megawatts \n(MW)  per  km2.  The  United  Nations  Environment  Program  concluded  in  2006  that  the  PRC\u2019s \ntechnically exploitable wind energy resource at 50 meters (m) above ground would reach 1,400 \nGW. The China Wind Resource Assessment Report by the National Climate Center of the China \nMeteorology  Bureau,  published  in  December  2006,  demonstrated  a  much  higher  estimate, \nconcluding that technically exploitable wind energy resources at a height of 10 m above ground \ncould reach 2,548 GW, without taking into account the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.  \n \n2. \nAbout  75%  of  the  PRC\u2019s  rich  onshore  wind  resources  are  concentrated  in  the \nnorthwestern  grasslands  and  the  Gobi  Desert,  stretching  from  Inner  Mongolia  through  Hebei, \nNingxia, and Gansu to Xinjiang. Within this narrow strip about 200 kilometers (km) wide, wind \npower density normally ranges from 200 W/m2 to 300 W/m2 and can reach above 500 W/m2 in \nsome regions with the most favorable conditions. \n \n3. \nWith  low  population  density  on  large  territories,  these  northwestern  provinces  are \nrelatively underdeveloped, with lower per capita gross domestic product (GDP) than the eastern \nand  coastal  provinces  but  holding  abundant  natural  resources  for  future  development.  Land \nsuitable  for  wind  power  development  in  these  provinces  is  mostly  barren,  requiring  minimal \narrangements  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Environmental  harm  such  as  avian \ncasualties,  noise,  and  visual  intrusion  are  negligible.  Extensive  wind  power  development  will \nhelp  reduce  wind  speeds  by  extracting  energy  from  air  flows  and  thus  help  alleviate  the \nsandstorms that frequently affect the northern PRC and thereby reverse desertification. \n \nZhangbei  County,  Hebei  Province,  where  the  proposed  Project  is  located,  is  242  km \n4.  \nnorthwest of Beijing. It is strategically situated between the load centers of Beijing, Tianjin, and \nTangshan  and  the  southeastern  brim  of  the  Inner  Mongolia  Plateau,  where  wind  energy \nresources are exceptionally abundant. The average wind speed in a typical year at a height of \n65 m is 7.64 meter per second, and the average wind energy density is 378.6 W/m2. Zhangbei \nhas an estimated 5.0 GW of wind resources that can be commercially developed with existing \ntechnologies, of which 1.5 GW will be developed by the end of 2010. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nRecognizing  the  staggering  challenge  of  ensuring  that  ongoing  energy  growth  be  both \nenvironmentally  sustainable  and  economically  desirable,  the  Government  of  the  PRC  (the \nGovernment)  has  made  a  strong  commitment  to  improving  energy  efficiency  on  the  demand \nside  and  developing  renewable  energy  on  the  supply  side,  to  enhance  energy  security  and \naddress global warming and climate change. The Government has articulated a clear vision as \nreflected in its target of quadrupling the per capita GDP while only doubling energy use in 2000\u2013\n2020, requiring that energy elasticity be maintained at 0.3 over the next 12 years. In its medium- \nand  long-term  renewable  energy  development  program  promulgated  in  August  2007,  the \nGovernment set a goal to produce 15% of its primary energy from renewable sources by 2020, \nup from 7.5% in 2005. The share of renewable sources for electricity production will be raised to \n\nSteady Improvement of the Regulatory Framework \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nRapid Development of the PRC Wind Power Sector \n\n20% by 2020, including plans to develop 30 GW of wind power, 20 GW of biomass and biogas \npower, and 300 GW of hydropower capacity. \n \n6. \nThe legal and regulatory environment for renewable energy development in the PRC has \nsteadily improved in recent years. The value-added tax for wind power projects was reduced in \n2001 from 17% to 8.5%, which is very important for wind farm developers as no fuel costs are \nattached  to  wind  power  generation.  The  Government  is  considering  the  application  of  a \ncompulsory  quota  on  renewable  energy  generation  for  independent  power  producers.  No \nlicensing  is  required  for  importing  wind  power  equipment.  The  Renewable  Energy  Law  was \nformulated in February 2005 and put into effect in January 2006, stipulating financial incentives \nfor renewable energy projects such as a national fund to foster renewable energy development, \nimproved  access  to  financing,  and  specific  tax  preferences.  It  reduces  risks  for  project \ndevelopers  by  mandating  power  grid  interconnection  and  full  power  offtaking,  as  well  as  by \nproviding guaranteed minimum prices or subsidies for certain types of renewable energy. \n \n7. \nWind  power  development  is  a  priority  area  in  the  national  Clean  Development \nMechanism  (CDM),  enabling  wind  farms  with  more  than  50%  domestic  ownership  to  sell \ncertified emission reduction certificates under the terms of the United Nations\u2019 Kyoto Protocol on \nClimate  Change.  By  September  2008,  39  wind  power  projects  in  the  PRC  had  successfully \nregistered with the CDM executive board. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nThe  PRC  has  been  developing  its  wind  resources  for  over  2  decades  but  by  2000 \ninstalled only 345 MW of capacity, equivalent to a small coal-fired plant. Since the preparation \nand  adoption  of  the  Renewable  Energy  Law  in  2005,  the  PRC  has  made  rapid  strides  in \nharnessing  wind  resources,  doubling  its  wind  power  generation  capacity  each  year.  In  the \nmedium-  and  long-term  renewable  energy  development  program,  the  national  target  for \ncumulative wind power capacity was originally set at 5 GW by 2010 and 30 GW by 2020. The \ngoal  for  2010  was  achieved  3  years  early,  in  2007,  and  has  therefore  been  lifted  to  10  GW. \nReality is evolving so quickly that this revised goal of 10 GW is likely to be exceeded in 2008 \nand could be raised to a level surpassing 20 GW. \n \nAccording to the Global Wind Energy Council, 3,155 wind turbines with a total capacity \n9. \nof 3.45 GW were installed in the PRC in 2007. This addition raised the PRC\u2019s cumulative wind \npower capacity to 6.1 MW in 158 wind farms across 21 provinces. Meanwhile, about 4.2 GW of \nwind  power  projects  had  been  approved  by  the  Government  and  were  under  construction  in \n2007.  Currently,  Inner  Mongolia  leads  the  country  by  having  erected  1,543  wind  turbines  by \n2007. It plans to install 8 GW by 2010, or 80% of the national goal, and 18 GW by 2015, or 60% \nof  the  national  goal  for  2020,  with  Huitengxile  alone  doubling  its  capacity  to  1  GW  by  2010. \nGansu  has  put  forward  proposals  to  develop  by  2020  along  the  Hexi  Corridor  20  GW  of  wind \npower, or 66% of the national goal. \n \n10. \nThe newly installed turbines in the PRC are much smaller than those in Europe and the \nUnited States, averaging 1.1 MW in 2007. According to the China Wind Industry Association, in \n2006, only 11% of operating wind turbines had rated capacities larger than 1.0 MW, and about \n79%  of  turbines  still  had  rated  capacities  of  600  kilowatts  (kW),  750  kW,  or  850  kW.  Many  of \nthese small wind turbines occupy good sites with strong wind resources and may be targets for \nreplacement with larger and more efficient turbines in the near future.  \n \n11. \nThe PRC\u2019s total installed wind power capacity ranked fifth in the world in 2007 and may \nmove  up  one  or  two  places  by  2010.  In  fact,  wind  power  is  the  fastest-growing  renewable \nenergy source in the world, expanding by about 30% per annum. Global Wind Energy Council \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n21\n\ndata indicates that more than 20 GW of wind turbines were installed worldwide in 2007, bringing \nglobal capacity to 94 GW, up by 27% from 2006. This nearly doubles the 2004 capacity of 48 \nGW and is more than five times the 2000 capacity of 18 GW. The top five countries in terms of \ninstalled capacity are Germany with 22 GW, United States with 17 GW, Spain with 15 GW, India \nwith 8 GW, and the PRC with 6 GW, jointly accounting for 72.6% of the world total. In terms of \neconomic value, the global wind market was worth $36 billion in 2007. In capacity addition, the \nUnited States took the lead in 2007, followed by the PRC and Spain.  \n \n12. \nDespite its rapid development in recent years, wind power has achieved an insignificant \nshare  in  the  PRC\u2019s  overall  power  mix,  occupying  only  0.6%  of  the  country's  overall  power \ngeneration  capacity  of  713.6  GW  and  a  meager  0.2%  in  its  total  electricity  output  of  3,263.2 \nterrawatt-hours  in  2007,  according  to  the  PRC  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission.  While  wind \npower capacity addition accounted for 30% of total incremental power generation capacity in the \nUnited  States  in  2007,  and  40%  in  Europe,  wind  power  accounted  for  less  than  3%  of  newly \ncommissioned capacity in the PRC in 2006 and 2007. Most new power generation facilities are \ngoing to burn coal of deteriorating quality and emit carbon dioxide for many decades to come.  \n \nThe current ratio between electricity output and the generation capacity of wind power in \n13. \nthe  PRC  indicates  serious  wind  resource  underutilization by  existing  wind  farms.  The  average \ncapacity  factor  of  wind  farms  was  less  than  20%,  or  1,787  hours  (h)  of  operation  at  full-load \nequivalent,  in  2007,  or  less  than  the  global  average  of  25%\u201330%  (2,200\u20132,600  h).  This  partly \nreflected  delays  in  commissioning  power  generation  facilities  and  implementing  transmission \nnetworks  and  power  grid  congestion,  but  also  lack  of  wind  farm  management  experience  and \nequipment reliability issues.   \n \nRapid  capacity  expansion  and  the  70%  localization  requirement  of  the  National \n14. \nDevelopment  and  Reform  Commission  (NDRC)  have  stimulated  the  domestic  wind  equipment \nindustry,  which  is  expanding  quickly  to  meet  high  demand  for  wind  turbines.  More  than  40 \ndomestic manufacturers, including joint ventures,  now assemble wind turbines of various size. \nThey are gradually enlarging their combined share of the PRC turbine market, rising to 45% in \n2006 from less than 10% in 2000. Jinjiang Gold Wind, Inc., in Xinjiang has the biggest market \nshare, accounting for 33% of newly installed capacity in the PRC and 75% of domestic turbine \noutput. Foreign manufacturers shared the remaining 55% of the turbine market in 2006, among \nwhich Vestas of Denmark, Gamesa of Spain, and General Electric of the United States took the \nbiggest  shares,  jointly  accounting  for  about  half  of  newly  installed  capacity  and  over  90%  of \nforeign turbine imports. \n \nThe  PRC  is  the  global  leader  in  small  wind  turbines  with capacity  below  50  kW,  which \n15. \nare used mostly for off-grid applications in remote areas. According to the World Wind Energy \nAssociation, the PRC operates 300,000 small wind turbines, accounting for 80% of the world's \ntotal. \n \nD. \n \n16. \nNDRC promotes large-scale wind power development through a wind power concession \nprogram aiming to accelerate the pace of development and lower wind power generating costs \non  one  hand,  and  to  increase  the  use  of  domestic  wind  power  equipment  on  the  other  hand. \nNDRC  allows  authorities  in  provinces  with  abundant  wind  resources  to  invite  international  and \ndomestic investors to participate in competitive tendering. The major elements of a wind power \nconcession include the following: \n \n \n\nCompetitive Bidding for Concession Rights to Develop Wind Power Projects \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n25-year concession duration. This is sufficient to cover the economic life of the \nwind farm. \nMinimum capacity. Each project should have a capacity larger than 100 MW to \nachieve  economies  of  scale.  Wind  farms  under  100  MW  can  be  approved  by \nprovincial  governments  on  a  case  by  case  basis.  The  unit  capacity  of  wind \nturbines should be greater than 600 kW. \nLocal  components.  Seventy  percent  of  wind  turbine  components  must  be \nmanufactured domestically. \nSupporting  infrastructure.  Local  authorities  are  responsible  for  building  main \naccess roads to wind farms.  \nGrid  connection.  The  power  grid  company  is  responsible  for  constructing \ntransmission  lines  to  connect  the  wind  farm  substations  and  must  sign  a  grid \nconnection agreement with the wind power generating companies. \nConcession assignment. Project investors are selected by national open public \nbidding.  Invitations  to  bid  are  announced  in  national  newspapers  and  important \nbidding websites, and the results are similarly made public.  \nFull uploading. All electricity produced by wind farms must be purchased by the \nprovincial power grid company, through a long-term power purchase agreement.  \nTariff  determination.  The  wind  power  tariff  is  determined  through  competitive \ntendering. The winner's quoted tariff is authorized as the feed-in tariff of that wind \nfarm  project.  After  the  turbines  have  finished  their  first  30,000  h  of  operation  at \nfull capacity equivalent, the feed-in tariff is adjusted to the grid average. \n\nAccelerating Wind Power Development in the PRC \n\n \n17. \nThe concession contract and long-term power purchase agreement protect the interests \nof  wind  power  investors  and  help  minimize  risks  in  recovering  investment  costs.  The  NDRC \napproved 15 large wind power projects with a total capacity of more than 2,600 MW under five \nrounds  of  concessions  held  annually  between  2003  and  2007.  Most  were  awarded  to \nsubsidiaries  of  the  big  five  power  generating  companies.  Once  the  tariff  for  wind  power  is \nestablished  through  a  competitive  bidding  process,  developers  have  the  option  to  expand  the \ncapacity  of  wind  farms  in  the  vicinity,  provided  that  the  tariff  and  other  key  conditions  of  the \nconcession remain the same. \n \nE. \n \n18.  Wind power development is expected to accelerate in the near future mainly because of \nthe improved regulatory framework, including the Renewable Energy Law and its implementing \npolicies; technological progress; rising coal and oil prices in the long run; more stringent control \nof  environmental  pollution;  and  the  Government\u2019s  stronger  commitment  to  achieving  greener \nand  low-carbon  economic  growth.  With  good  results  coming  during  the  11th  Five-Year \nDevelopment Plan period, the national goal for cumulative wind power capacity by 2020 can be \nraised to 120 GW, equivalent to the total capacity of seven Three Gorges hydropower facilities, \nor  120  coal-fired  power  plants  of  1.0  GW  each.  This  target  would  be  considerably  larger  than \nthe International Energy Agency projection of 56 GW by 2020 but still account for less than 5% \nof the total technically exploitable wind energy resources in the PRC of 2,548 GW and will not \naffect the stability and reliability of the power grid. To achieve this target, 10 GW of wind power \nneeds to be installed annually for 10 years between 2011 and 2020. \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n23\n\nTHE SPONSORS OF THE ZHANGBEI WIND POWER PROJECT \n\nChina Energy Conservation and Investment Corporation \n\n \n1. \nThe  Zhangbei  Wind  Power  Project  (the  Project)  of  100.5  megawatts  (MW)  will  be \nimplemented by a special purpose vehicle organized as a Sino-foreign joint venture, which will \nbe  indirectly  70%  owned  by  China  Energy  Conservation  Investment  Corporation  (CECIC)  and \nindirectly  30%  owned  by  HKC  (Holdings)  Limited,  Inc.  (HKC).  Both  sponsors  have  extensive \nindustry experience and strong financial capability for developing renewable energy projects in \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  The  proposed  Project  is  the  sixth  wind  power  project \nundertaken  by  CECIC  in  Zhangbei,  Hebei.  It  is  also  one  of  three  wind  power  projects,  with  a \ncombined  capacity  of  500  MW,  codeveloped  by  CECIC  and  HKC. 1  CECIC  and  HKC  also \ncollaborated to build a waste-to-energy cogeneration project in Linyi, Shandong Province. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nHeadquartered in Beijing, CECIC is a large corporation owned by the Government of the \nPRC (the Government)  and administered directly by the State-Owned Assets Supervision and \nAdministration  Commission  of  the  State  Council.  CECIC  is  the  sole  state-owned  enterprise  in \nthe  PRC  at  the  national  level  specifically  tasked  with  designing,  financing,  and  operating \nprojects for energy efficiency, renewable energy, and environmental protection. CECIC started \nin  early  1980s,  in  response  to  the  second  international  oil  crisis,  as  the  Energy  Conservation \nPlanning  Bureau  in  the  former  State  Planning  Commission,  the  forerunner  of  the  National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission. It was empowered with the responsibility to allocate and \nmanage  state  energy  conservation  investment  funds.  In  1988,  the  PRC  State  Council \ncommercialized these functions and registered CECIC as a corporation with its own legal rights \nand financial responsibilities under the PRC Company Law.  \n \n\n1. \n\nBusiness Operations and Development Strategy \n\n \nTo support the Government\u2019s increasingly strengthened commitment to efficiently utilize \n3. \nand  conserve  resources,  including  energy  and  water,  and  build  an  environmentally  friendly \nsociety,  CECIC  has  pioneered  in  introducing  new  technologies  and  developing  demonstration \nprojects for energy efficiency and pollution control.  \n \n4. \nDuring the past 20 years since its establishment, CECIC has completed more than 3,000 \nlarge and important energy conservation and renewable energy projects in 13 sectors in more \nthan 300 municipalities.2 The total accumulative investment exceeded CNY55.0 billion, serving \nboth  fast-growing  coastal  provinces  and  resource-abundant  western  inland  regions.  Currently, \nCECIC treats and recycles more than 2 million tons (t) of industrial wastes and 260 million t of \nwastewater per year. These projects have delivered significant environmental benefits, including \n(i)  annual  energy  savings  amounting  to  45.8  million  t  of  standard  coal;  (ii)  annual  chemical \noxygen demand reductions amounting to 75,000 t; and (iii) annual reductions of carbon dioxide \n(CO2) emissions of 105.0 million t. CECIC has the goal to additionally save by 2012 through its \n\n                                                 \n1  The other two wind power projects are (i) the 2006 national concession project of 200 MW with a total investment \nof  CNY1.6  billion  through  a  60:40  joint  venture  at  Danjinghe,  Zhangbei,  and  (ii)  the  2007  national  concession \nproject of 200 MW at Changma, Gansu Province. \n\n2  These  include  450  cogeneration  projects  with  a  combined  capacity  of  10,000  MW,  more  than  100  urban  natural \ngas supply and distribution projects with a combined capacity of 13.93 million cubic meters per day, district heating \nprojects servicing more than 200 million square meters, coal cleansing and treatment capacity of 59.69 million t per \nyear,  and  wastewater  treatment  capacity  of  110  million  cubic  meters  per  year  for  paper  making  and  food \nprocessing industries. \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nnew  investment  4.3  million  t  of  standard  coal,  reduce  CO2  emissions  by  11.1  million  t,  cut \n400,000 t of chemical oxygen demand, and process 5.0 million t of industrial wastes per year.  \n \n5. \nCECIC  wholly  owns  or  holds  the  majority  shares  of  15  second-level  subsidiary \ncompanies and more than 60 third-level subsidiary companies. To grow further, CECIC plans to \nraise  more  equity  capital  through  an  initial  public  offering  in  a  domestic  or  international  stock \nexchange  in  about  3  years.  In  its  long-term  corporate  development  strategy,  CECIC \nconcentrates  80%  of  its  assets  in  four  key  areas:  (i)  wind  power  development;  (ii) waste \nmanagement; (iii) water supply, wastewater treatment, and sanitation; and (iv) energy efficiency \nimprovement  and  resource  conservation.  In  recent  years,  CECIC  has  improved  its  corporate \ngovernance structure and formulated an action plan to fulfill its corporate social responsibilities.  \n\n \nCECIC\u2019s investment in wind power development is channeled through its wholly owned \n6. \nsubsidiary  specialized  in  wind  energy  investment,  the  CECIC  Wind  Power  Investment  Co. \n(CECIC-WPI),  which  was  established  in  January  2006  and  now  has  total  assets  valued  at \nCNY4.5 billion. For specific projects in different locations, project companies are set up to work \nwith various equity partners and debt financiers. \n \n7. \nTo  break  bottlenecks  on  wind  turbine  supply  and  absorb  advanced  wind  power \ntechnologies,  CECIC  acquired  in  June  2006  half  of  the  second  largest  domestic  wind  turbine \nmanufacturer,  Zhejiang  Windey  Wind  Generating  Engineering  Co.,  Ltd.,  which  has  mature \ntechnologies for 800 kilowatt wind turbines and is now testing 1.5 MW turbines in cooperation \nwith a leading European turbine design company.  \n \n\n2. \n\nOperational Performance on Wind Power Development \n\n \n8. \nCECIC-WPI has accumulated the capacity and experience to become an industry leader \nin  designing,  building,  and  operating  large-scale  wind  farms  in  the  PRC.

On 29 December 2002, the PRC State \nCouncil  established  the  State  Grid  Corporation  of  China  (SGCC)  to  inherit  most  power \ntransmission and distribution assets and business of the former State Power Company,  which \nowned  all  thermal  power  generation  facilities  and  transmission  networks  in  the  country.    Five \npower  generation  companies\u2014Datang,  Guodian,  Huadian,  Huaneng,  and  China  Power \nInvestment  Corporation\u2014were  established  to  manage  and  develop  the  thermal  power \ngeneration business. \n \n2. \nAs  a  backbone  state-owned  enterprise  with  clear  mandates  to  ensure  national  energy \nsafety and to support economic lifelines, SGCC's core business is to build and operate power \ngrids  and  to  provide  sufficient,  secure,  and  reliable  electricity  supply  for  socioeconomic \ndevelopment. With a registered capital of CNY200 billion, SGCC has a service area covering 26 \nprovinces, or 88% of the national territory.1 SGCC is the owner and operator of the State Power \nGrid, which consists of five regional power grids (northeast, north, northwest, east, and central) \nand three independent provincial power grids (Shandong, Fujian, and Tibet). \n \n3. \nSGCC  is  the  world's  largest  public  utility  company,  with  1.5  million  workers  (72%  for \noperations; 22% for construction; 2% for design, research, and development; and 4% for other \nmanagement and logistic support). At the end of 2007, SGCC served 128 million customers and \na  total  population  over  1  billion,  with  467,700  kilometers  (km)  of  transmission  line  at  110 \nkilovolts (kV) or above and 1,350.8 million kilovolt amperes of power transformation capacity at \n110 kV or above. Its total assets were CNY1,366 billion, with a debt\u2013asset ratio of 60.4%.  \n \n4. \nIn  2007,  SGCC\u2019s  electricity  sales  were  1,974.2  terawatt-hours  (TWh),  an  increase  by \n34.8% from that in 2005. Its revenue was CNY1,016 billion from main businesses (42.5% more \nthan in 2005), which ranked it 24th in the Fortune Global 500. Electricity supply reliability rates \nin both urban and rural areas exceeded 99.5%, and the line loss rate was 6.3%.  \n \n\nTable A5.1: Key Performance Indicators of the State Grid Corporation of China \n \nPerformance               \n2007 \n2006 \n1,464.6  1,709.7  1,974.2 \n467.7 \n413.2 \n\nGrowth (2005=100) \n2006 \n116.7 \n108.2 \n\nUnit \nTWh \nThousand km \n\n2005 \n100.0 \n100.0 \n\n381.8 \n\n2005 \n\n2007 \n134.8 \n122.5 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nItem \nElectricity Sales \nTransmission line at 110 kV or \nabove \nTransformation capacity at 110 \nkV or above \n \nRevenues from main businesses \nTotal assets \nUrban electricity supply reliability \nRural electricity supply reliability \nLine loss \n\nmillion kVA \n\n983.4  1,137.8  1,350.8 \n\n100.0 \n\n115.7 \n\n137.4 \n\n \nCNY billion \nCNY billion \n% \n% \n% \n\n \n712.7 \n\n \n \n1,015.7 \n854.5 \n1,169.7  1,212.8  1,365.9 \n99.9 \n99.5 \n6.3 \n\n99.8 \n99.5 \n6.4 \n\n99.8 \n99.4 \n6.6 \n\n \n100.0 \n100.0 \n100.0 \n100.0 \n100.0 \n\n \n119.9 \n103.7 \n100.1 \n100.1 \n97.1 \n\n \n142.5 \n116.8 \n100.1 \n100.2 \n95.4 \n\nkm = kilometer, kV = kilovolt, kVA = kilovolt ampere, TWh = terawatt-hour. \nSource: The State Grid Corporation of China. \n\n                                                 \n1  The  China  Southern  Power  Grid  Co.,  Ltd.,  manages  the  transmission  and  distribution  business  in  five  southern \n\nprovinces: Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Hainan. \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n29\n\nThe  total  power  generation  capacity  connected  to  the  State  Power  Grid  in  2006  was \n5. \n435.9 gigawatts (GW), 82% of which was coal fired.

Its  registered  capital  stood  at \nCNY60 billion. Now NCGC consists of five provincial branch companies (Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, \nShanxi, and Shandong) and more than 30 other subsidiaries. \n \n7. \nAs the second largest among the five regional power grids under SGCC, NCGC bears \nresponsibility for safeguarding power supply to the PRC\u2019s capital, Beijing, and providing reliable \npower  and  services  for  economic  and  social  development  in  the  northern  PRC.  Its  power  grid \ncovers  1.63  million  square  kilometers  and  serves  a  population  of  230  million.  NCGC\u2019s  power \ngrid  has  48  transformation  stations  and  111  500-kV  transmission  lines  totaling  to  13,783  km. \nNCGC had total assets of CNY239 billion and net assets of CNY86 billion by the end of 2005.  \n \n8. \nBy the end of 2007, the total installed power generation capacity connected to the North \nChina  Power  Grid  (NCPG)  was  145  GW,  of  which  about  30%  was  in  the  Beijing-Tianjin-\nTangshan area.  This compares with the total installed power generation capacity in France of \n112.2 GW, Germany (118.9 GW), Italy (71.4 GW), Russian Federation (215.3 GW), Spain (61.0 \nGW), and United Kingdom (76.2 GW) in 2004.2  \n \n9. \nCoal dominates power generation in the northern PRC, creating severe greenhouse gas \nemissions. About 97% of the power generation capacity covered by NCPG is coal fired, as the \nregion  has  scant  hydropower  resources.  To  diversify  electricity  supply  toward  renewable \nsources,  abundant  wind  energy  potential  in  Hebei  and  Inner  Mongolia  must  be  effectively \nexploited, as pioneered by wind power development in Zhangbei. Demand for electricity in the \nnorthern PRC will continue to grow rapidly. According to the 11th Five-Year Development Plan \nfor the NCPG, both the load volume and electricity usage in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan area \nare estimated to double in the 15-year period from 2006 to 2020. \n  \n\n                                                 \n2  Energy Information Administration. 2007. International Energy Annual 2005. \n\nhttp://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/international/iealf/table64.xls \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nFINANCIAL EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT  \n\n \n1. \nThe financial evaluation of the Zhangbei Wind Power Project (the Project) uses 2008 as \nthe base year. The main assumptions for financial projections are built on the project sponsors' \nfinancial model, with adjustments to reflect findings from due diligence. The analysis was carried \nout over 25 years in line with the length of the concession period for the wind power project as \nawarded by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). \n \n2. \nBusiness  Model.  Wind  farm  management  is  straightforward.  All  equipment  is  highly \nautomated and can be monitored and operated remotely. The modular structure of wind farms \nmeans  that  a  few  turbines  can  be  kept  idle  for  maintenance  without  significantly  reducing \nelectricity output. No raw materials need to be procured, inventory handled, logistics or transport \narranged, products advertised or marketed, or emissions controlled. No post-sale services are \nrequired.  The  volume  of  electricity  output  and  sales  follow  a  seasonal  pattern  but  cannot  be \nprecisely scheduled. One hundred percent electricity output is sold to only one client, the North \nChina Power Grid (NCPG). Financial settlements with NCPG are normally completed within 45 \ndays,  since  the  premium  on  tariff  for  wind  power  is  shared  by  all  end-users  across  the  entire \npower grid.  \n \n3. \nThe Project's FIRR and DSCR were tested under various scenarios. Overall, the Project \nis  considered  to  be  bankable  under  different  scenarios,  sustaining  adequate  debt  service \ncoverage. \n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n31\n\nECONOMIC EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT \n \n\nBackground \n\nA. \n \n1. \nThe economic analysis of the Zhangbei Wind Power Project (the Project) was carried out \nin  line  with  a  standard  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  framework  and  in  accordance  with  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.1 All  economic  costs  and \nbenefits are expressed in constant November 2008 domestic prices. The analysis was carried \nout over 25 years, in line with the length of the concession period for the Project as authorized \nby the National Development and Reform Commission. \n \n2. \nDemand for power in the People's Republic of China (PRC) has risen rapidly in tandem \nwith economic growth. Total power generation capacity in the PRC exceeded  712  gigawatts in \n2007,  dwarfing  the  installed  capacity  of  100.5  megawatts  of  wind  power  for  the  proposed \nProject.  \n \nEconomic Costs. Capital costs include physical contingencies but exclude taxes, price \n3. \ncontingencies,  and  financial  charges  during  construction.  Direct  operational  costs  are  paid  to \nworkers, contractors, and service providers and are expected to increase in real terms by 2.5% \nannually.  Project  inputs  are  domestic  and  valued  through  shadow  pricing  using  a  standard \nconversion factor of 1.14. The Project is considered environmentally and socially benign and is \nunlikely to have external costs.  \n\n \n4. \nEconomic  Benefits  in  Meeting  Power  Demand.  Strong  demand  growth  in  the  PRC \nmeans  that  all  the  electricity  generated  by  the  Project  will  meet  unmet  demand,  rather  than \nsubstitute for power from any existing generation capacity. Therefore, the entire project output \nis  considered  incremental,  amounting  to  250.9  gigawatt-hours  (GWh)  of  clean  electricity \nannually.  The  economic  value  of  the  incremental  electricity  generation  is  taken  to  be  the \nweighted  average  willingness-to-pay  for  power  across  the  customer  classes,  which  was \nestimated at CNY0.76 per kilowatt-hour (kWh).2 \n \n5. \nEconomic Benefits in Reducing GHG Emissions. As the Project employs renewable \nenergy technologies, its production of electricity without greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will \ngenerate global benefits in terms of avoided climate change. The Project is expected to reduce \nGHG emissions by 242,127 tons (t) of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent per annum relative to a \ncoal-fired  plant  baseline.  The  global  environmental  benefit  of  the  Project  is  estimated  using \ncertified emission reductions (CERs) as a proxy. The value of CERs is assumed to be $15 per \nton of CO2 before 2012 and $6 thereafter. However, the literature on climate change suggests \nthat  avoided  global  damage  from  reducing  CO2  emissions,  or  the  social  value  of  carbon,  is \nlikely to be significantly larger than the carbon market value.3 The Project\u2019s economic internal \nrate of return (EIRR) improves dramatically when the social value of carbon is included on the \nbenefit side. \n \n6. \nEconomic  Benefits  in  Pollution  Control  and  Resource  Conservation.  The  Project \nwill  reduce  other  emissions,  such  as  sulfur  dioxide,  nitrogen  oxide,  and  particulate  matters, \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997.

The  estimate  in  the  paper  is \nCNY0.68 per kWh. This figure was adjusted to the 2008 price using inflation rates of 4.77% in 2007 and 6.43% in \n2008. \n\n3  Social value of carbon is estimated as the present value of the total damages inflicted or reduced globally when an \n\nadditional unit of CO2 is emitted into or taken out of the atmosphere. \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nwhich are generated by thermal power production. The Project will conserve scarce resources, \nmainly coal and freshwater. However, in the absence of a market for emission reductions and \nresource conservation, these benefits are not quantifiable and are therefore not captured in the \neconomic  analysis.  The  EIRR  of  the  Project  would  be  even  higher  when  these  benefits  were \nincluded. \n \nB. \n\nTax Contributions \n\n7. \nTaxation.  The Government has given fiscal incentives to develop renewable energy in \nunderdeveloped  areas  such  as  Zhangbei,  halving  the  value-added  tax  (VAT)  to  8.5%. \nCorporate income tax is exempted for the first 3 years of operations and, thereafter, is levied at \n25.0%. Two surcharges for education and urban construction are based on the VAT at 5% and \n4%, respectively. After the 3-year tax holiday, the corporate income tax increases together with \nthe  gross  profit.  It  accelerates  at  the  points  when  interest  payments  on  long-term  debt  are \nphased  out  and  again  when  the  fixed  assets  are  completely  depreciated.  The  VAT  and  the \nsurcharges sum to slightly more than CNY10 million per year. Total taxes amount to CNY554.6 \nmillion over the project life, contributing substantial fiscal revenue to support local development \nand solidifying support for the Project from the central and local governments. \n \nC. \n\nLeast-Cost Analysis \n\nCoal-fired thermal power plants currently dominate electricity generation in the northern \n8. \nPRC.  About  97%  of  the  power  generation  capacity  in  Hebei  Province  is  coal-fired,  as  scant \nhydropower resources exist there. Hence, a coal-fired power plant is set as a baseline project \nfor least-cost analysis. The investment cost for a traditional coal-fired power plant in the PRC is \nrelatively low at $600/kilowatt, or less than half of that of the Project, which is $1,364/kilowatt. \nHowever, a coal-fired power plant needs to purchase and combust coal continuously and emits \na significant amount of CO2. \n \nThe  analysis  considers  a  subcritical  coal-fired  power  plant,  which  has  a  CO2  intensity \n9. \nlevel of 1,100 t of CO2 emissions per GWh of electricity generated. Taking account of the social \ndamage from CO2 emissions, the average incremental cost of the coal power unit is estimated \nto be $0.60/KWh of electricity generated. On the other hand, the average incremental cost of \nthe  Project  is  only  $0.49/KWh.  A  coal-fired  power  plant  also  emits  local  pollutants  such  as \nsulfur dioxide and particulates that have adverse impacts on health. The estimate of average \nincremental cost for the coal-fired power plant will be even higher when these social costs are \nincluded. The analysis shows that the Project has the least economic and social cost. \n \nD. \n \n10. \nThe  EIRR  of  the  Project  is  conservatively  estimated  to  be  17.4%,  which  is  above  the \nbenchmark  social  discount  rate  of  12%.  When  the  benefits  from  avoided  GHG  emissions  is \nadded the EIRR increases to 33.6%.  \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n33\n\nTable A7.1: Estimates of Economic Costs and Benefits \n(CNY million) \n \n\nTotal \nEconomic \nCost \n\nOperation and \nMaintenance \nCost \n\nTotal \nEconomic \nBenefit \n\nElectricity \nSales \n \n\nCDM \nBenefit \n \n\nNet \nEconomic \nBenefit \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0    \n\n0.0 \n\n 0.0    \n\n0.0 \n\n(447.2) \n\n 0.0    \n\n(562.4) \n\nCapital \nCost \n \n\n(447.2) \n\n(559.9) \n\n0.0 \n\n   (2.5) \n\n   (4.8) \n\n   (6.2) \n\n (21.2) \n\n (21.6) \n\n (21.9) \n\n (22.3) \n\n (22.7) \n\n (23.1) \n\n (23.6) \n\n (24.0) \n\n (24.5) \n\n (24.9) \n\n (25.4) \n\n (25.9) \n\n (26.4) \n\n (26.9) \n\n (27.5) \n\n (28.0) \n\n (28.6) \n\n (29.2) \n\n (29.8) \n\n (30.6) \n\n (77.9) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 210.4  \n\n 210.4  \n\n 210.4  \n\n 210.4  \n\n 210.4  \n\n 210.4  \n\n 210.4  \n\n 210.4  \n\n 210.4  \n\n 210.4  \n\n 210.4  \n\n 210.4  \n\n 210.4  \n\n 210.4  \n\n 210.4  \n\n 210.4  \n\n 210.4  \n\n 210.4  \n\n 210.4  \n\n 210.4  \n\n 210.4  \n\n 210.4  \n\n 210.4  \n\n \n\n 190.7  \n\n 190.7  \n\n 190.7  \n\n 190.7  \n\n 190.7  \n\n 190.7  \n\n 190.7  \n\n 190.7  \n\n 190.7  \n\n 190.7  \n\n 190.7  \n\n 190.7  \n\n 190.7  \n\n 190.7  \n\n 190.7  \n\n 190.7  \n\n 190.7  \n\n 190.7  \n\n 190.7  \n\n 190.7  \n\n 190.7  \n\n 190.7  \n\n 190.7  \n\n   19.8  \n\n   19.8  \n\n   19.8  \n\n   19.8  \n\n   19.8  \n\n   19.8  \n\n   19.8  \n\n   19.8  \n\n   19.8  \n\n   19.8  \n\n   19.8  \n\n   19.8  \n\n   19.8  \n\n   19.8  \n\n   19.8  \n\n   19.8  \n\n   19.8  \n\n   19.8  \n\n   19.8  \n\n   19.8  \n\n   19.8  \n\n   19.8  \n\n   19.8  \n\n205.6  \n\n204.3  \n\n189.2  \n\n188.9  \n\n188.5  \n\n 188.1  \n\n 187.7  \n\n 187.3  \n\n 186.9  \n\n 186.4  \n\n 186.0  \n\n 185.5  \n\n 185.0  \n\n 184.6  \n\n 184.0  \n\n 183.5  \n\n 183.0  \n\n 182.4  \n\n 181.8  \n\n 181.2  \n\n 180.6  \n\n 179.9  \n\n 132.5  \n\n( ) = negative, CDM = clean development mechanism, EIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE. \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\n \n\nEIRR = \n\n17.4% \n\n11. \nA sensitivity analysis of the project EIRR was undertaken using @Risk 4.5 software.

The total project cost is estimated to \nbe CNY932.0 million, 34% of which will be financed by equity from two sponsors and 66% by \nlong-term  debts  provided  through  a  proposed  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  loan.  Special \nfunds have been allocated for environmental protection and conservation of water and soil in the \nproject area. \n \n3. \nThe  Project  will install 67  wind  turbine  generators  (WTGs),  each  with a  rated  output  of \n1.5 MW, on ridges ascending from northwest to southeast, perpendicular to the prevailing wind \ndirection  from  the  north.  The  Project  is  the  sixth  wind  power  project  developed  by  CECIC  in \nZhangbei and planned to be fully commissioned by early 2010. The Project\u2019s capacity factor is \nprojected  to  be  28.5%,  providing  2,497  hours  (h)  of  operation  at  full-capacity  equivalent  and \nsupplying 250.9 gigawatt-hours of clean electricity from renewable wind resources per annum to \nmitigate chronic shortage on the North China Power Grid (NCPG).  \n \n4. \nCoal-fired thermal power plants currently dominate electricity generation in the northern \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), accelerating resource depletion, exacerbating environmental \ndeterioration,  and  causing  ever-rising  costs  of  electricity  for  industrial,  commercial,  and \nresidential uses. The Project's main objective is to utilize abundant local wind resources more \neffectively  to  replace  86,118  tons  (t)  of  standard  coal  per  year  and  to  abate  greenhouse  gas \n(GHG) emissions by avoiding more than 5.5 million ton of carbon dioxide emissions during the \n25-year concession.

Abutting  on  the  southern  rim  of  the  Inner  Mongolia  Plateau,  the \n10. \nproject  site  is  centered  at  114o32\u201930\u201d  east  longitude  and  41o03\u201950\u201d  north  latitude.  The  project \nsite  altitude  ranges  from  1,500  meters  (m)  to  1,600  m  above  the  mean  sea  level.  It  is  17 \nkilometers  (km)  from  Zhangbei  County  Town  and  242  km  northwest  from  Beijing,  making  it \nclose to the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan load centers. The project site is 21 km from the national \nhighway connecting Beijing to Hohhot, the capital of the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region.  \n \n11. \nThe project area has a semi-arid, intermediate temperate continental monsoon climate, \nfeaturing a long and cold winter, dry and windy spring, and short and hot summer. The project \nsite  and  its  environs  are  the  driest  and  coldest  area  in  Hebei.  Its  annual  rainfall  is  300 \nmillimeters, and its annual average air temperature is 2.6 degrees Celsius. \n \nZhangbei  has  some  of  the  richest  wind  resources  in  the  northern  PRC,  as  it  is  on  the \n12. \nregular route for frequent southbound cold highs from Siberia and the Mongolian Plateau, which \nrapidly  sweep  toward  the  North  China  Plain  with  strong  winds.  Total  commercially  exploitable \nwind  power  resources  in  Zhangbei  are  estimated  to  be  around  5,000  MW.  NDRC  selected \nZhangbei  as  the  PRC\u2019s  first  1,000  MW  wind  power  development  district.  More  than  10 \ncompanies  are  currently  developing  or  operating  wind  farms  in  or  near  Zhangbei.  CECIC  has \ndeveloped five winds farms nearby, including one at Danjinghe as a joint venture with HKC. \n \nThe  project  site  is  favorable  for  wind  power  development.  The  average  annual  wind \n13. \nvelocity at 70 m above ground is 8.42 m per second (m/s) and the annual wind energy density \nat  70  m  is  492.3  watts  per  square  meter.  The  frequencies  for  the  five  wind  directions  (west-\nnorthwest, northwest, north-northwest, southeast, and south-southeast) sum to 71.5%, and the \nprobability  for  the  wind  velocity  ranging  between  3  m/s  and  25  m/s  stands  at  99.96%.  The \nestimated maximum wind velocity averaged over a 10-minute interval occurring once every 50 \nyears is 41.1 m/s.  \n \nPhysical Environment. The project site is mostly uninhabited and degraded grassland, \n14. \nwith many rock outcrops and gravel areas with scarce vegetation. The soil is arid, mainly sand \nand silt with little agricultural value. The project area has certain natural water sources, including \nboth  surface  and  groundwater,  but  does  not  enclose  any  identified  archeological,  historical, \ncultural, or religious sites or commercial deposits of mineral resources. The air and water quality \nis typically average for the region. The background noise comes mainly from wind. \n \n15. \nBiological  Environment.  Because  of  the  dry  climate,  the  project  site  and  its \nsurrounding areas have no large trees apart from those planted in villages. There are no wildlife \nsanctuaries,  reserve  forests,  bird  sanctuaries,  and  rare  or  endangered  species  of  animals  or \nplants in the vicinity. There are no specific migration paths of birds near the project area.  \n \nSocioeconomic  Environment.  Human  settlements  are  found  only  in  areas  below \n16. \nwhere the wind farm is located. With an area of 4,185 square kilometers (km\u00b2), Zhangbei had a \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement  \n\npopulation of 370,800 in 2007, 83% of which depend on agriculture and animal husbandry1 and \nare thus vulnerable to the harsh climate. In 2006, the county\u2019s GDP stood at CNY2.5 billion, and \nthe  net  income  per  farmer  was  merely  CNY2,773  ($347),  which  is  less  than  $1  per  day  and \namong of the lowest in the PRC. \n \nD. \n \nLand  Acquisition.  The  land  to  be  affected  by  the  Project  will  total  0.71  km2,  of  which \n17. \n0.39 km2 (54%) will be permanently occupied and 0.32 km2 (46%) temporarily used. Most lands \nare  on  currently  unproductive  ridges  and  have  been  acquired  through  negotiations  with  the \nvillagers as willing sellers.  \n \nIndigenous  Peoples  and  Resettlement.  No  indigenous  people  live  close  to  or  within \n18. \nthe sites identified for the wind farm. As the sites are vacant, there is no need for resettlement \narrangements.  Therefore,  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  Policy  on \nIndigenous Peoples (1998) are not triggered. \n \nE. \n \n19. \nEnvironmental protection standards in the PRC have been strengthened in recent years. \nThe construction and operation of wind farms must strictly follow a series of national standards, \nincluding the following: \n\nEnvironmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nAmbient Air Quality Standards (GB3095-1996) Grade II; \n(i) \nSurface Water Quality Standards (GB3838-2002) Grade III;  \n(ii) \nStandard of Environmental Noise in the Urban Area (GB3096-1993) Grade I; \n(iii) \nEcology Quality Standards; \n(iv) \nAir Pollutant Discharge Standards (GB16297-1996) Grade II; \n(v) \n(vi) \nSewage Discharge Standards (GB8978-1996) Grade I; \n(vii)  Construction Site Noise Limits (GB12523-1990) Grade III; and \n(viii) \n\nIndustrial Sector Noise Standards (GB12348-1990) Grade II. \n\n \n\n1. \n\nImpacts and Mitigation Measures during Construction \n\n \n20. \nProject  construction  entails  only  minor  civil,  mechanical,  and  electrical  works  over  a \nrelatively  short  period  on  several  small  areas  scattered  over  a  wide  area.  Construction, \nparticularly  the  construction  of  a  1.8  km  road  from  the  main  road  to  the  wind  farm,  will  create \nsome  small  and  transient  environmental  disturbances  such  as  noise,  exhaust  emissions,  and \nflying  dust  from  moving  trucks  and  heavy  equipment.  No  groundwater  will  be  tapped  for \nconstruction work. The effect on vegetation, animals, water and soil loss, and the atmosphere \nare  scant.  Earth  excavated  during  road  construction  will  be  used  for  road  embankments  and \nminor leveling of the site during site restoration after construction. The wastes from about 150 \nworkers, estimated to be 37.5 kilograms per day, will be collected and transported to the county \ngarbage treatment site. \n \nThe  67  WTGs  will  be  erected  sequentially  using  only  two  to  four  cranes.  Construction \n21. \nand installation equipment will be removed upon completion, and the ground will be cleaned so \nthat  the  land  can  be  reused.  Vegetation  cover  spoiled  during  temporary  land  uses  will  be \nregenerated within 3 years. The nearest residence is at least 500 m away from the project site, \nand noise from the operation of heavy equipment will be below 50 decibels (dB). \n\n                                                 \n1  The rural population is distributed in 18 towns, 366 administrative villages, and 1,167 natural villages. \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n39\n\nConstruction will generate direct and indirect temporary employment for both casual and \n22. \nskilled labor. Health and safety measures will be implemented, including AIDS prevention. The \nexisting culture and health of the local populations will not be affected as the construction period \nwill be very short. \n \n\n2. \n\nImpacts and Mitigation Measures during Operation \n\nThe  operation  and  maintenance 2  of  wind  farms  does  not  involve  any  atmospheric \n23. \nemissions  or  effluent  discharges.  Fluids  and  other  waste  materials  associated  with  typical \nmaintenance will not be stored on site and will be disposed of off site in approved landfills.  \n \n24. \nmitigation measures are as follows: \n\nThe main environmental impacts of the Project during operation and the corresponding \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nLand  use.  The  land  occupied  by  the  wind  farm  is  not  arable,  and  the \npermanently occupied land is very small and properly purchased.  \nBird fatalities. The WTGs will not endanger migratory birds or bats as there are \nfew in the wind farm area, which is not located in the main habitat or along the \nmain migration routes of migratory birds. According to the project EIA, the death \nrate of birds and bats will not rise because of the Project.  \nNoise.  The  operating  noise  of  1.5  MW  WTGs  ranges  from  90  to  102  dB,  and \ndrops quickly to 45 dB at a distance of 500 m. As the nearest residences are at \nleast 500 m away from the wind farm, they will not be affected by the noise. \nAir pollution. The WTGs do not generate any air pollution emissions. \nVisual  intrusion.  WTG  towers  erected  far  from  inhabited  areas  will  not  create \nadverse  visual  impacts,  as  the  ridge  on  which  the  wind  farm  is  located  is  not \nknown for its natural beauty. The turbine design minimizes the flickering effects \nof  blade  rotation.  Villagers  plan  to  develop  ecotourism  using  the  wind  farms  to \nattract tourists interested in clean energy development. \nAir  traffic  safety.  The  Project  will  strictly  adhere  to  regulations  regarding  air \ntraffic  safety  relevant  to  tall  WTG  towers.  In  line  with  regulations  for  air \nnavigational markings, the upper section of the towers and turbine blades will be \nmarked with bands of a specified width to enhance their visibility. Blinking lights \nwill  provide  clear  identification  at  night.  No  impact  on  air  traffic  safety  is \nanticipated. \nSoil  erosion.  Transformers  at  each  WTG  tower  and  the  substation  have  been \ndesigned, and will be properly maintained, to avoid soil erosion. \n\n(viii)  Magnetic  radiation. Magnetic radiation from a wind farm is low, and the health \n\nof residents and local electrical equipment will not be affected. \n\n(ix)  Waste management. The 24 cubic meters of wastewater and 12.5 kilograms of \ntrash  generated  per  day  during  operation  are  minimal.  The  wastewater  will  be \ntreated on site for recycling, and the garbage will be collected and disposed of at \nthe county\u2019s garbage collection station, with little impact on the environment.  \n\n \n25. \nThe project area has experienced seismic tremors ranging from 2.0 to 6.2 on the Richter \nscale. The WTGs, towers, and buildings have therefore been designed, and will be constructed, \nto be able to withstand lateral ground movements caused by seismic shocks. Insurance policies \nare required to cover possible losses from natural disasters. \n\n                                                 \n2  Routine  maintenance  will  be  conducted  throughout  the  lifetime  of  the  wind  turbines,  generally  amounting  to \n80 hours a year and mainly being the maintenance of the turbine, rotor, and electrical components; lubrication of \nparts; and full generator overhaul. \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Management Plan \n\nF. \n \n26. \nOrganizational  Structure,  Roles,  and  Responsibilities.  As  the  project  company  is \nresponsible for constructing, operating, and maintaining the WTGs and the facilitating system, it \nwill  be  accountable  for  environmental  management  and  monitoring.  The  project  company  will \nensure  that  it  and  all  subcontractors  comply  with  all  regulations  and  conditions  for  various \nconstruction  and  operation  activities.  The  Hebei  Provincial Environment  Protection Bureau  will \nvalidate  at  the  end  of  project  construction  that  all  environmental  issues  have  been  properly \nhandled  and  will  issue  a  formal  certificate  if  the  handling  fully  meets  national  requirements. \nWithout such a certificate the wind farm cannot be commissioned. During the operation period, \nthe  Zhangbei  County  Environment  Protection  Bureau  is  required  by  the  Hebei  Provincial \nEnvironment  Protection  Bureau  to  conduct  periodic  examinations  on  the  environmental  issues \nrelated to the Project. \n \n27. \nEnvironmental  Management  Plan.  A  social  and  environmental  management  plan \n(SEMP) has been formulated to articulate potential impacts, corresponding mitigating measures, \nand  the  implementation  timeframe,  with  carefully  designed  monitoring  arrangements.  Carrying \nout  the  SEMP  will  minimize  environmental  and  social  disturbances  associated  with  the \nconstruction,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  the  Project.  The  general  manager  of  the  project \ncompany,  assisted  by  the  heads  of  operations  and  administration  departments,  will  bear  the \nresponsibility  for  satisfactory  implementation  of  the  SEMP.  The  SEMP  and  the  environmental \nmonitoring program are presented in Tables A8.3 and A8.4. \n \nG. \n \n28. \nCECIC has conducted many activities to raise awareness on wind energy development \nin the project vicinity. Local communities have demonstrated good understanding of the nature \nand scope of wind energy projects. Formal public consultation sessions were held during project \ndue  diligence  in  November  2008  and  were  attended  by  relevant  stakeholders,  including \nrepresentatives of local residents and governments, to solicit their views on the Project and its \nenvironmental  and  social  aspects.  The  outcome  of  these  consultations  has  verified  that  the \nProject  has  no  significant  negative  environmental  and  social  impacts.  In  fact,  the  local \nfor  emerging  economic \ncommunities  welcome  wind  power  projects  with  expectations \nopportunities and additional tax revenues to support social welfare programs that directly benefit \nlocal low-income groups. Furthermore, CECIC  will exercise its social corporate responsibilities \nto provide assistance for community development. \n \nH. \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure \n\nConclusions \n\n29. \nSufficient  data  and  analyses  exist  to  conclude  that  the  Project,  generating  renewable \nenergy from wind resources on marginal land with insignificant economic and ecological value, \ncontributes  to  reducing  GHG  emissions  and  delivers  long-term  economic,  environmental,  and \nsocial benefits. Disturbances during construction will be small and transient and can be properly \nmanaged. The perceptible environmental impacts during operation are mostly noise and visual \nintrusion,  but  both  are  considered  to  be  minimal  given  the  WTGs\u2019  distance  to  the  nearest \nsettlements and the limited landscape value of the project site. If the project company properly \nimplements  the  SEMP,  the  Project  is  unlikely  to  cause  any  significant  or  lasting  negative \nenvironmental  or  social  impacts.  Existing  information  is  adequate  to  justify  environmental  and \nsocial clearance of the Project without requiring further environmental or social assessments. \n \n\n\fAppendix 8

POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry/Project Title: People\u2019s Republic of China: Zhangbei Wind Power Project \n\nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\nDirect Loan \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\nEast Asia Department, Energy Division \nPrivate Sector Operations Department, Infrastructure Finance \n\nDivision 2 \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nEnergy  conservation  and  environmental  protection  are  two  major  challenges  for  sustainable  development  in  the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  The  proposed  Zhangbei  Wind  Power  Project  (the  Project)  extends  continued \nsupport of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to implementing the PRC\u2019s 11th Five-Year Development Plan (2006\u2013\n2010),  which  attaches  top  priority  to  improving  energy  efficiency,  developing  renewable  energy,  and  controlling \npollution emissions, and specifically requires that financial assistance from international financial institutions be used \nfor  resource  conservation,  environmental  improvement,  and  infrastructure  development.  The  Project  supports  the \nPRC\u2019s  Country  Program  on  Climate  Change  toward  cutting  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  replacing  coal \nconsumption and diversifying electricity supply into renewable sources.  \n \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC concentrates on achieving balanced and sustainable growth with the \nmore efficient use of resources and more stringent environmental protection. The proposed Project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s overarching aims for inclusive, efficient, equitable, and sustainable economic growth to eliminate poverty. In \nits long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020), ADB identified energy as one of five core operational \nareas and achieving environmental sustainability as one of three strategic development priorities.a ADB\u2019s operational \nfocus  for  the  energy  sector  is  to  address  energy  security  and  climate  change  by  improving  energy  efficiency  and \nenlarging the use of indigenous, clean, and renewable energy. In recent years, ADB has introduced new initiatives \nand  adopted  new  and  more  client-oriented  operational  modalities  (e.g.,  nonsovereign  operations)  to  reinforce  its \nassistance  to  its  developing  member  countries  as  they  acquire  low-carbon  technologies  and  implement  projects \npromoting energy efficiency and renewable energy development. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                        Targeting Classification:  General Intervention  \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe Project is located in Zhangbei, Hebei, one of the PRC\u2019s nationally recognized poverty counties, with infertile soil \nand  a  harsh  climate.  Generating  electricity  by  burning  coal  damages  local  air  quality  and  the  natural  environment. \nThe Project will improve local and regional air quality and reduce acid rain by replacing 86,118 tons (t) of standard \ncoal  for  power  generation  and  thus  cut  emissions  by  1,984  t  of  sulfur  dioxide,  1,126  t  of  nitrogen  dioxide,  and \n242,127 t of carbon dioxide per  year. It  will also contribute to conserving the local natural environment by annually \nsaving 5,900 t of freshwater and eliminating 21,530 t of coal ash residues, which cause soil deterioration.  \n \nAgriculture  is  the  main  economic  activity  of  most  of  the  population  in  the  project  county.  Tax  revenues  from  local \nindustries are very limited. The county  government needs to  widen and  strengthen sources of revenues to provide \nbasic social services to residents.  \n \n2.   Design Features \nThe proposed Project will increase the electricity supply from clean and renewable sources to mitigate chronic power \nshortages and to booster the development of local manufacturing and service industries; encourage the participation \nof private sector and foreign investors in renewable energy development; create job opportunities and income growth \nduring  construction  and  operation;  enlarge  revenues  to  enhance  welfare  programs;  upgrade  physical  infrastructure \n(e.g.,  roads,  power  transmission  networks,  and  telecommunication  facilities);  and  improve  the  regional  ecological \nenvironment.  The  Project  will  generate  demonstration  effects  for  wind  power  projects  in  the  PRC  by  deploying \nadvanced  wind  power  technologies  and  adopting  international  practices  on  corporate  governance  and  risk \nmanagement.  The  low-income  group  in  the  project  area  will  directly  benefit  from  the  social,  economic,  and \nenvironmental impacts of the proposed Project. \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nThe  project  county,  Zhangbei,  is  situated  in  the  northern  part  of  Hebei  Province,  bordering  the  Inner  Mongolia \nAutonomous Region to the north, with a land area of 4,185 square kilometers and a population of 375,000 in 2007. \nThe gross domestic product of Zhangbei  was CNY1.7 billion in 2005, of  which  primary  industries (including  wheat, \nbeans, potato, and livestock) contributed CNY900 million, or 53%; secondary industries (including leather and meat \nproducts  and  construction  materials)  contributed  CNY350  million,  or  21%;  and  tertiary  industries  (mainly  tourism) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\ncontributed CNY450 million, or 26%. The annual revenue in 2005 was CNY446 million, of which only CNY40 million \nwas generated by local businesses. It is estimated that the project will generate CNY13.3 million in revenues during \na normal operation year through value-added taxes, corporate income taxes, and other surcharges.  \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nStakeholders  have  been  consulted  to  identify  the  environmental  and  social  costs  and  benefits  of  the  project. \nMitigation action plans have been adopted through a participatory process to minimize environmental damage during \nconstruction and operation. The project company has adopted a corporate social responsibility mechanism to assist \nsocioeconomic development and environmental enhancement in the project area. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring? \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.
