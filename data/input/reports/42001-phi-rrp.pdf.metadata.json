The  environmental  implications  were  reviewed  and \nno significant adverse impacts were identified.  \n \nThe  Project  will  (i)  retrofit  about  40  government-owned  office \nbuildings  with  efficient  lighting;  (ii)  procure  13  million  compact \nfluorescent  lamps  (CFLs)  for  distribution  to  residential  and  other \ncustomers  to  reduce  peak  power  demand;  (iii)  introduce  energy-\nefficient lamps for public lighting; (iv) set up a laboratory for testing \nenergy-efficient  appliances  and  a  lamp  waste  management \nfacility; (v) establish a super energy service company (ESCO)  to \nsupport  ESCO  development;  (vi)  promote  an  efficient-building \ninitiative;  and  (vii)  develop  and  implement  a  communication  and \nsocial mobilization program. \n \nPhilippine  consumers  spend  a  large  part  of  their  household \nincome  on  energy;  the  country\u2019s  electricity  tariffs  are  among  the \nhighest in the region. This situation has become even worse with \nrecent  oil  price  increases  and  is  likely  to  continue  in  the  short  to \nmedium term as the Government cannot influence high oil prices. \nThe introduction of competition through open access and targeting \nexisting subsidies can only reduce electricity tariffs in the medium \nto long term. The Government is focusing on increasing the use of \nindigenous  renewable  energy  generation  (such  as  geothermal, \nbiomass, wind, and hydropower) and promoting energy efficiency \nto meet these challenges.  \n \nThe  Government  recognizes  that  it  alone  cannot  identify  and \nfinance  the  various  energy-efficiency  initiatives.  Studies  carried \nout by the Department of Energy (DOE) with assistance from the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  demonstrate  that  by  investing \n$46.5  million  in  energy  efficiency,  the  Government  could  defer \n$450 million of investments in new power plants, and save about \n$100 million annually in fuel cost.   \n \n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\nThe  Project\u2019s  purpose is  to  reduce the  peak load  power  demand \nby  implementing  an  energy-efficiency  program,  with  particular \nfocus  on  efficient  lighting  that  will  contribute  to  greenhouse  gas \nreduction. Carbon credits will be sought following the methodology \napproved  by  the  executive  board  of  the  Clean  Development \nMechanism.  The  Project  is  economically  and  financially  sound \nwith  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  99%  and  a  financial \ninternal  rate  of  return  of  206%  compared  with  the  weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital  of  2.4%.  For  the  CFL  distribution \ncomponent,  the  payback  period  is  less  than  1 year,  making  the \ninvestment cash flow positive in the first year. The economic and \nfinancial  internal  rates  of  return  calculations  do  not  include  the \nvalue of Clean Development Mechanism credits generated by the \nProject. \n \nThe  final  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  reduced  cost  of  energy \nproduction. As electricity cannot be stored, its supply and demand \nhas  to  be  met  instantaneously.  During  peak  times,  the  marginal \ncost  of  generation  is  usually  about  5\u201310  times  more  than  the \naverage  cost  of  generation.  Therefore  when  the  peak  demand  is \nreduced by using efficient lighting, the average cost of generation \nis reduced.  \n \nConsumers\u2019 energy costs will be reduced with the use of efficient \nlighting.  With  reduced  electricity  demand,  the  overall  need  for \nsupply  (generation)  will  be  reduced.  Also,  a  large  amount  of \ngreenhouse gas emissions\u2014and the associated cost of importing \nfuel\u2014will be avoided, creating carbon credits for the Project under \nthe CDM. The Project will establish sustainable business models \nfor  large-scale  implementation  of  energy-efficiency  programs.  It \nwill \nlocal  government  energy \nexpenditure, reduce health risks associated with residual mercury \nand  kerosene  (in  off-grid  areas),  enhance  livelihoods  of  rural \ncommunities,  facilitate  a  viable  ESCO  industry,  and  establish  a \ncertification  process  for  energy  and  environmentally  efficient \ncommercial buildings. \n  \nThe  estimated  cost  of  the  Project  is  $46.5  million,  including \nphysical  and  price  contingencies,  interest  and  other  charges \nduring implementation, and taxes and duties of $2.4 million. \n \n\nreduce  public  sector  and \n\n\fFinancing Plan \n\nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\nRetroactive Financing \n\nlending \n\nA loan of $31,100,000 from the ordinary capital resources of ADB \nwill  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in \nfacility,  a \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \ncommitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  annum,  and  such  other  terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \nThe Asian Clean Energy Fund (established by the Government of \nJapan)  will  provide  a  grant  of  $1.5 million  equivalent  under  the \nClean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility.  ADB  will  administer \nthe grant. The Government will provide financing of $13.9 million. \n \nUnder  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement  that  will  be  on  terms  and \nconditions  satisfactory  to  ADB,  the  Government  will  relend \n$7.5 million equivalent to the super ESCO that will be established \nas  a  subsidiary  corporation  of \nthe  Philippine  National  Oil \nCompany. The super ESCO will bear the foreign exchange risk for \nthis subsidiary loan agreement. \n \nRetroactive financing is proposed for an initial supply of CFLs that \nwill  be  ordered  between  1  August  2008  and  loan  effectiveness, \nwith  a  ceiling  of  up  to  $3.1  million  (10%  of  the  loan  amount),  in \naccordance with Innovation and Efficiency Initiative: Cost Sharing \nand  Eligibility  of  Expenditures  for  Asian  Development  Bank \nFinancing\u2014A  New  Approach  (2005).  The  Government  and  the \nImplementing  Agency  were  advised  that  approval  of  advance \naction  or  retroactive  financing  does  not  commit  ADB  to  financing \nthe Project.  \n \nUntil October 2011 \n \nApril 2011  \n\nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \n\n \nDepartment of Energy \n \n\niii \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\nfor \n\nthe \n\ncomponents \n\nDOE  will  be  responsible  for  overall  technical  supervision  and \nexecution  of  the  Project.  DOE  will  also  be  the  Implementing \nAgency for the following subcomponents: (i) retrofit of government \noffice  buildings,  (ii)  testing  laboratory  and  lamp  waste  recovery \nplant,  (iii)  efficient-building  initiative,  and  (iv)  public  lighting \nretrofits. The other implanting agencies are (i) the super ESCO for \nthe  National  Electrification \nthe  ESCO  component;  and  (ii) \nAdministration \nelectric \ninvolving \ncooperatives\u2014national  residential  lighting  initiative  except  in  the \nfranchise  areas  of  the  private  utilities.  As  the  Executing  Agency, \nDOE  will  establish  a  project  management  unit,  headed  by  a \ndirector and appropriately staffed for day-to-day coordination. The \nfor  supporting \nunit  director  will  have  overall  responsibility \nimplementation  and  providing  guidance,  administrative  and \ntechnical  support,  counterpart  staff,  documentation,  and  other \nservices that may be required. \n \nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan and the Asian \nClean  Energy  Fund  grant  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing \nPartnership  Facility  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time), \nand  the  procurement  plan  prepared  and  agreed  between  the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  All  procurement  contracts  will  contain \nanticorruption provisions as specified by ADB.  \n \nAdvance  action  will  allow  DOE  to  initiate  its  communication  plan \nand  the  first  stage  of  CFL  distribution.  The  Government  was \nadvised that approval of advance action does not commit ADB to \nfinancing the Project. \n \nConsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \nThey  will  provide  support  for  project  implementation.  Advance \ncontracting will be applied for consulting services. \n \nThe direct economic benefits of the Project include reduced peak \ndemand and overall reduction of imported oil for power generation \nby  use  of  energy-efficient  lighting  devices.  This  will  result  in \nsavings  of  about  $100  million  per  annum  from  avoided  fuel  cost \nand deferral of an investment of $450 million in power generation \nand  associated  network  capacity  of  450  megawatts,  which  is \nabout  3%  of  the  Philippines\u2019  total  generation  capacity.  Poor \ncustomers  will  particularly  benefit,  as  lighting  is  a  significant \ncomponent of their electricity consumption. These households will \nbenefit from improved quality lighting.  \n \n\n\fRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n\nthe \n\nThe  CFL  distribution  component  has  some  risks:  (i)  the  efficient \nand timely procurement of CFLs and their distribution without any \nleakage  to  the  commercial  market;  and  (ii)  the  Government\u2019s \nability  to  implement  and  enforce  strict  controls  on  energy-\nefficiency labeling and testing of CFLs. These risks are mitigated \nby  ensuring  that  (i)  distribution  of  CFLs  to  customers  is  done  at \nthe  payment  points  of  the  electric  cooperatives  and  private \ndistribution  utilities,  (ii)  each  CFL  is  marked  \u201cnot  for  sale,\u201d  and \n(iii) suppliers deliver the CFLs directly to the distribution points.  \n \nEach customer will receive a coupon with their electricity bill and \nbe  made  aware  of \nfree  distribution  via  mass  media \ncommunication.  Appropriate  monitoring  mechanisms  for  effective \ndistribution  and  reporting  of \nthe  CFL  component  will  be \ndeveloped. All electric cooperatives participated in developing the \nproposed  distribution  mechanism.  The  mechanism  will  be \noptimized during implementation of the first phase. Lessons from \nthe distribution of the first lot will be incorporated in the distribution \nof subsequent lots. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  ability  to  create  enough  competition  among  the \nmajor  lighting  manufacturers  is  not  considered  a  significant  risk. \nAbout 3 to 5 million units will be procured in each of the three lots \nto ensure strong competition and to discourage market dominance \nby any single brand.  \n \nEstablishment  of  a  super  ESCO  has  some  risks.  The  risks \nassociated  in  opening  up  the  public  sectors\u2014hospitals,  schools, \nand office buildings\u2014to private suppliers may (i) take longer than \nplanned  during  design;  (ii)  meet  unforeseen  legal  barriers; \n(iii) need  much  more  incentives  and  encouragement  for  public \nsector  managers  to  participate  in  the  process;  and  (iv)  be \ndominated by several existing suppliers, thus inhibiting the growth \nof  the  market.  DOE  will  address  all  these  risks  in  the  detailed \nbusiness plan. \n \nThe  super  ESCO  will  face  some  risks  in  developing  the  ESCO \nmarket  for  industry  and  commercials  sectors,  for  example:  (i) an \ninsufficient number of ESCOs are interested in the super ESCO\u2019s \noffers (financing and capacity building), (ii) end consumers do not \ntrust  a  government-supported  ESCO  on  grounds  of  perceived \nbureaucracy,  (iii)  not  enough  competent  staff  are  available  to \nimplement \nlegal  and \nthe  super  ESCO  business  plan,  (iv) \nprocedural  complications  slow  needed  quick  disbursement,  and \n(v)  the  ESCOs  are  not  able  to  design  benefit-sharing  contracts \nthat will encourage all parties\u2014the super ESCO, private ESCOs, \nand  end  users\u2014to  continue  energy-efficiency  related  activities \nand make it a sustainable program. \n \n \n\nv \n\n \n\n\f16  00'No\n\n16  00'No\n\n119  00'Eo\n\n125  00'Eo\n\nBabuyan  Channel\n\nPHILIPPINES\nPHILIPPINE ENERGY\nEFFICIENCY PROJECT\n\nN\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nKilometers\n\no\n122  00'E\n\no\n21  00'N\n\no\n21  00'N\n\nBasco\n\nItbayat\n\nBATANES\n\nSabtang\n\no\n122  00'E\n\nS o u t h     C h i n a     S e a\n\nBangued\n\nKALINGA\n\nTuguegarao\n\nABRA\n\nCAR\n\nTabuk\n\nREGION II\nCagayan Valley\n\nILOCOS NORTE\n\nLaoag\n\nAPAYAO\n\nKabugao\n\nCAGAYAN\n\nREGION I\nIlocos\n\nILOCOS SUR\nVigan\n\nLA UNION\nSan Fernando\n\nLagawe\n\nBENGUET\nLa Trinidad\n\nMT.

The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA.   \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nMacroeconomic Performance \n\n2. \nGross domestic product growth improved gradually from 4.4% in 2002 to 7.2% in 2007\u2014\nthe highest growth in 3 decades. This growth was fueled largely by consumer spending (about \n70%) and partly by public sector expenditures on current and capital outlays. Implementation of \nfiscal reforms in 2004\u20132006 coupled with receipts from privatization permitted the Government \nto increase expenditures, estimated at 17% of gross domestic product in 2007. However, growth \nslowed to 4.6% during the first quarter of 2008. This is largely due to rising commodity prices; \nincrease in international oil prices; and a slowdown in global growth, which will impact exports. \nOverall  economic  growth  for  2008  is  likely  to  be  around  4.5%.  In  March  2008,  the  Philippine \nDevelopment Forum emphasized the importance of physical infrastructure in increasing regional \ncompetitiveness and market access, attracting investments needed to sustain economic growth, \nand reducing poverty. In this regard, the Government\u2019s 2009 budget proposal calls for continued \nfiscal consolidation and priority for key physical infrastructure projects. The 2005\u20132007 country \nstrategy and program of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) emphasizes support for removing \ninfrastructure bottlenecks in power, transport, and agriculture to increase the competitiveness of \nprivate sector-led manufacturing and service sectors.1 \n \n\n2. \n\nEnergy Sector Performance \n\n3. \nThe  National  Power  Corporation  (NPC),  a  vertically  integrated  utility,  had  primary \nresponsibility for power generation and transmission in the Philippines until the power subsector \nwas  restructured  in  February  2002.  Prior  to  the  restructuring,  NPC  and  several  independent \npower producers shared electricity-generating functions in the country. Privately owned Manila \nElectric  Company  (Meralco),  16  privately  owned  utilities,  7  municipal  systems,  and  119 rural \nelectric cooperatives distributed electricity across the country. The power supply system in the \nPhilippines  is  divided  into  three  grids\u2014Luzon,  Mindanao  and  Visayas.  The  Luzon  grid  covers \nMetro Manila and accounts for about 70% of total power demand in the country; the Mindanao \ngrid  is  the  second  largest.  The  National  Electrification  Administration  (NEA)  is  responsible  for \nrural  electrification.  It  manages  electrification  targets  and  maintains  the  operation  of  rural \nnetworks through the electric cooperatives.  \n \n4. \nBurdened  with  excessive  debt,  lack  of  competition,  and  stranded  generation  capacity \nwith expensive take-or-pay contracts, the Government decided to restructure and privatize the \npower industry. In 1998, ADB supported the Government\u2019s initiative through the Power Sector \nRestructuring Program2 with financing of $300 million. The program\u2019s principal objective was to \ncreate competitive electricity markets by unbundling generation and transmission, and providing \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nopen  and  equal  access  to  transmission  and  distribution.  By  March  2003,  NPC\u2019s  assets  were \norganized into two state-holding companies: (i) National Transmission Corporation, which took \non  much  of  the  company\u2019s  transmission  assets;  and  (ii)  Power  Sector  Assets  and  Liabilities \nManagement Corporation, which assumed control of the power-generating assets. \n \n5. \nThe Electric Power Industry Reform Act, passed by Congress in 2001, was the blueprint \nfor  the  2002  restructuring.  The  act  required  the  breakup  of  NPC\u2019s  integrated  assets  into \nseparate units for electricity generation and transmission. By March 2008, the Government had \nfinalized a 25-year concession to operate the national power grid, and the Power Sector Assets \nand  Liabilities  Management  Corporation  had  formally  approved  the  sale  of  more  than  \n1,855  megawatts  (MW)  or  44%  of  NPC\u2019s  generation  assets  in  support  of  the  Government's \nrevised target of 70% privatization before the end of 2008. In 2001, the Government established \nan  independent  regulator,  the  Energy  Regulatory  Commission  to  oversee  competition  and \nmonopoly regulation of the sector. Detailed analysis of the power subsector is in Appendix 2. \n \n6. \nTotal energy demand is projected to double by 2030 (from 2007), growing at about 4% \nper annum. Electricity demand growth3 will be similar. Growth will be strongest in the residential \nsector (at 6.5% annually), as compared to the commercial (5.7%) and industry sectors (4.7%). If \nthe status quo continues, most of this demand growth will have to be met by imported oil and \ncoal. Both coal and oil consumption grew by 10% between 2006 and 2007. Coal will continue to \nbe the dominant4 fuel for electricity generation and will account for 54% of electricity generation \nby 2030. The transport sector\u2019s demand is currently exclusively met by oil and will account for \nabout 44% of total final energy demand by 2030. \n \nThe total installed power-generating capacity in the Philippines was 15,937 MW in 2007, \n7. \ngenerating  about  59,600  gigawatt-hours,  a  20%  increase  since  2001.  Natural  gas  (32%), \ngeothermal  energy  (17%),  and  hydropower  (14%)  are  the  main  domestic  primary  energy \nsources used for generation. Oil-based and coal-fired generation contribute the remaining 37%. \nThe  electricity  tariffs  in  the  Philippines  are  among  the  highest  in  the  region5 and,  as  a  result, \nconsumers spend a large part of their household income on energy. Recent oil price increases \nhave  exacerbated  the  situation,  especially  for  poor  consumers  in  rural  areas.  Global  energy \nprices will continue to be high in the short to medium term.  \n \n8. \nIn  response  to  these  challenges,  the  Government  organized  the  Philippine  Energy \nSummit in February 2008 to discuss options for mitigating the impact of high energy prices on \nthe  general  public.  The  summit  concluded  that  while  the  introduction  of  competition  through \nopen  access6 and  better  targeting  of  existing  subsidies  could  reduce  electricity  tariffs  in  the \nmedium term, a more effective solution would be a combination of increased use of indigenous \nrenewable  energy  generation  (such  as  geothermal,  biomass,  wind,  and  hydropower)  and \npromotion  of  energy  efficiency  because  of  its  quick  implementation  ability.  The  summit \nparticipants agreed to pursue energy efficiency as the short-term strategy to combat the impact \n                                                 \n3   Projections  of  energy  demand  and  electricity  consumption  are  taken  from  various  reports  published  by  the \nPhilippine  Department  of  Energy  and  International  Energy  Agency,  including  International  Energy  Agency.  2007. \nWorld Energy Outlook 2007. Paris. \n\n4   National  coal-based  generation  was  about  28%  in  2007  (35%  in  Luzon,  10%  in  the  Visayas,  and  20%  in  the \n\nMindanao grids). \n\n$0.065 per kWh. \n\n5   Philippines  $0.22  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh),  Cambodia  $0.20  per  kWh,  Viet  Nam  $0.06  per  kWh,  and  Indonesia \n\n6   Open access means that the utility\u2019s wires are \u201copen\u201d and can be used by a customer to receive electricity from an \nalternative source. Open access gives a customer the choice to shop around for a \u201ccheaper\u201d source of electricity, \nswitch  directly  to  the  cheaper  alternative,  and  pay  the  incumbent  utility  only  for  regulated  transmission  and \ndistribution charges. \n\n\fof high energy prices. The Government recognizes that it alone cannot identify and finance the \nvarious  energy-efficiency  initiatives,  and  therefore,  developed  a  two-pronged  implementation \nplan. Under this plan, the Government will make residential customers aware of the economic \nbenefits of energy efficiency; and for commercial and industrial customers, the Government will \ncreate an enabling policy and lending environment to encourage private sector investments in \nenergy efficiency. These measures will ensure efficient use of electricity by all consumers, thus \nlowering consumer cost and costs of the government and private corporations for electricity; and \nultimately reduce the import of fossil fuels. \n \n9. \nthe impact of high energy prices and the overall carbon footprint of the energy sector.  \n \nB.    Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities  \n\nTo  implement  this  plan,  the  Government  requested  ADB  support.  The  plan  will  reduce \n\n1. \n\nKey Problems and Constraints  \n\nPower Shortage. Electricity demand is projected to increase by about 6% during 2008\u2013\n10. \n2014. This will require adding 4,000 MW of new generation capacity.7 By 2012, power shortages \nare  expected  in  the  Luzon  and  Visayas  grids  as  demand  growth  will  catch  up  with  current \nexcess  generation  capacity.  In  January  2008,  the  Government,  in  its  updated  energy  sector \ndevelopment  plan,  identified  14  power  projects  with  a  total  capacity  of  2,534  MW.  The \nGovernment expects the private sector to invest in these generation projects and to trade power \nin the power pool or sell directly to distribution utilities.  \n \nBenefits of Competition Delayed. Unbundling power ensures appropriate investments \n11. \nand  efficient  operation  through  (i)  competition  in  generation  and  retail;  and  (ii) effective \nregulation, as  a  surrogate  for  competition,  for monopoly  transmission and  distribution.  Despite \nthe facts that (i) power restructuring is well advanced, (ii) the Philippines is a role model for the \nregion, and (iii) the Government has been successful in attracting private investors to purchase \nold  NPC  generation  plants  at  higher  than  expected  prices,8 consumers  have  not  yet  benefited \nfrom  the  reforms  in  terms  of  lower  electricity  prices.  The  main  competitive  element\u2014open \naccess\u2014has not yet been implemented.  \n \n12. \nSystem  Peak.  The  system  peak  in  most  rural  electric  cooperatives  is  driven  by  the \nevening  lighting  load;  unlike  Meralco,  where  the  late  afternoon  system  peak  is  driven  by \ncommercial  air-conditioning  load.  A  large  part  of  the  rural  system  peak  is  contributed  by \nincandescent  bulbs  in  households,  inefficient  linear  fluorescents  in  commercial  buildings  and \nsmall factories, and inefficient public lighting. Widespread use of inefficient lighting (residential \nand  commercial)  has  created  capacity  constraints  within  the  rural  electric  cooperatives \n(particularly  in  remote  rural  areas)  by  increasing  system  peak  demand,  and  eroding \ntransmission  reserve  capacity  and  generation  capacity.  This  inefficient  lighting  has  not  only \nburdened  end  consumers  with  excess  electricity  bills,  it  also  contributes  to  additional \ngreenhouse gas emissions caused by the excess generation needed (from diesel or fuel oil) for \nthe extra electricity to supply the inefficient lighting.  \n \n13. \nLack of ESCO Development. An energy service company (ESCO) is a private business \nthat  engages  in  a  performance-based  contract  with  a  client  to  identify  and  implement  energy-\nefficiency measures to reduce the client\u2019s energy consumption at the client\u2019s premises. A super \n\n                                                 \n7   Department of Energy. 2008. Power Development Plan 2006 Update. Philippines. \n8   Prices ranged from $1.55 million to $2.03 million per megawatt. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fESCO  aggregates  activities  of  other  ESCOs  and  brings  financing  for  projects.  It  can  take  the \nform of a leasing or financing company to provide ESCOs and/or customer\u2019s energy equipment \non  lease  or  benefit-sharing  terms.  It  will  also  lead  efforts  to  develop  the  ESCO  industry  with \ncapacity building, knowledge management, and market development. \n \n14.  With one of the region\u2019s highest electricity tariffs (after Japan), the Philippines should be \nthe  one  of  the  most  attractive  places  for  investments  by  ESCOs.  The  high  electricity  prices \nprovide  excellent  incentives  for  establishing  ESCOs  to  undertake  energy-efficiency  projects; \nunfortunately, this is not the case and only a few ESCOs are operating in the country. To date, \nvery  few  energy-efficiency  projects  have  been  implemented.  The  main  barriers  to  ESCOs  are \n(i) limited  or  no  access  to  funds  (without  collateral  or  guarantees),  (ii)  lack  of  technical \nevaluation capacity in commercial banks, (iii) lack of flagship projects and general awareness of \nenergy efficiency by end users, and (iv) inadequate policy support.  \n \n15. \nESCOs  need  to  promote  energy-efficiency  ideas  and  concepts  to  commercial  and \nindustrial  customers  where  electricity  represents  only  about  10%\u201315%  of  their  operating  cost. \nBusiness  managers  are  either  not  aware  or  do  not  consider  energy  efficiency  as  a  priority \ndespite high returns on energy-efficiency investments. \n \n16.  Mercury  Pollution.  The  compact  fluorescent  lamp  (CFL)  contains  2\u20135  milligrams  of \nmercury.  A  typical  linear  fluorescent  lamp,  used  commonly  in  offices  and  houses,  contains \nabout 12 milligrams of mercury. These lamps have been in use for the last 40 years, and only \nrecently  have  governments  begun  addressing  issues  of  their  safe  disposal.  Mercury  poses  a \nhazard  to  pregnant  women,  infants,  and  children.  People  in  the  Philippines,  as  in  many \ndeveloping countries, dispose of fluorescent lamps in landfills, ultimately polluting groundwater. \nThe Government plans to institute measures that will address mercury content in CFLs sold in \nthe Philippines, and to collect mercury from old fluorescent lamps before disposal.  \n \n\n2. \n\nOpportunities \n\n17. \nEfficient  lighting  reduces  electricity  demand  for  lighting  by  around  40%.  In  the \nPhilippines, where the domestic and commercial lighting base is large, lighting is the main driver \nof the peak load. About 1,300 MW of the peak demand can be saved by switching to the use of \nenergy-efficient  lights.  More  than  40  million  incandescent  lights  are  in  operation,  according  to \nthe  Philippines  Lighting  Industry  Association.  Only  20%  of  the  electricity  used  by  an \nincandescent  bulb  produces  light;  the  remaining  80%  is  wasted  as  heat.  A  CFL  uses  all  of its \nelectricity  input  to  produce  light,  saving  about  80%  of  power  consumption.  Because  of  their \ndesign, CFLs last about 10 times longer than incandescent lamps.  \n \n18. \nGovernments, worldwide, are encouraging customers to use more CFLs, as the savings \nare  much  more  than  the  avoided  cost  of  adding  new  generation  capacity.  The  additional \nbenefits  are  environmental,  including  avoided  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Perusahaan  Listrik \nNegara,  the  national  electricity  utility  in  Indonesia,  started  distributing  CFLs  to  its  residential \ncustomers  in  2007.  Australia,  Canada,  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  Thailand,  Viet  Nam,  and \nmany  other  countries  have  used  a  CFL  distribution  program  as  an  effective  alternative  to \nbuilding  new  power  stations  to  meet  growing  demand.  Put  simply,  if  1  million  incandescent \nbulbs  are  replaced  with  CFLs  at  a  cost  of  about  $1.5  million,  the  electricity  demand  will  be \nreduced by 50 MW. The impact on the power system will be the same as building a new 50 MW \npower  station,  which  may  cost  at  least  $50  million,  another  $2  million\u2013$3  million  each  year  to \noperate, and 3\u20134 years for construction.  \n \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f19.   Efficient Lighting Choices for Off-Grid Customers. Off-grid customers, with their high \ncost  of  generation,  are  looking  for  choices  beyond  CFLs.  Light-emitting  diodes  (LED) 9 can \nproduce the same amount of light as a 40-watt incandescent bulb or a 13-watt CFL, with only \nabout  8\u20139  watts  and  have  an  effective  life  of  more  than  50,000  hours  (replacement  of  a  light \nbulb every 30  years).10 Projects are being undertaken in Africa to replace inefficient kerosene \nlanterns  with  LEDs  in  off-grid  areas.11 LED  lighting,  coupled  with  a  small  solar  panel,  is  an \nenvironment-friendly  alternative  for  remote  populations  with  no  access  to  grid-connected \nelectricity.  This  technology  can  bring  large  benefits  for  off-grid  communities  in  the  Philippines \nwho are dependent on kerosene lamps.  \n \n20.   Efficient  Public  Lighting. In the Philippines, public lighting (street lighting and lighting \nof  public  areas)  is  subsidized  and  local  government  units  are  responsible  for  managing  it.12 In \nthe  provinces,  most  street  lighting  uses  inefficient  lighting  technologies,  such  as  fluorescent \nlights,  incandescent  bulbs,  and  low-pressure  mercury  vapor  lamps.  India,  Thailand  and  Viet \nNam  have  developed  national  efficient  public  lighting  programs.  The  Philippines  could  use \nefficient  lights  for  public  lighting  to  reduce  the  need  for  energy  generation  and  avoid  the \nassociated carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.  \n \n21. \nEfficient Buildings. Commercial buildings consume large amounts of energy estimated \nat  about  25%\u201340%  of  energy  used  globally,  generating  30%\u201340%  of  greenhouse  gases  and \n30%\u201340%  of  solid  waste.  According  to  a  recent  publication,  improving  energy  efficiency  in \nbuildings  by  implementing  (i)  lighting  retrofits;  (ii)  improved  heating,  ventilation,  and  air-\nconditioning systems; and (iii) building control systems can reduce more than 700 million tons of \ngreenhouse gases, mostly at net negative marginal costs. 13   \n \nIn many countries, this priority area is addressed through efficient-building initiatives14 by \n22. \nencouraging adoption of efficient-building practices through (i) incorporating better designs such \nas  building  orientation  and  construction;  (ii)  implementing  improved  operation  systems \n(maintenance,  control  systems,  monitoring,  communication,  and  waste  disposal);  and  \n(iii)  improving  overall  building  management,  including  ventilation  and  air-conditioning.  In  the \nPhilippines,  four  major  professional  groups  are  involved  in  developing  efficient-building \ninitiatives.  These  groups  share  common  long-term  goals  and  plan  to  align  their  short-term \nactivities. Together, they plan to develop a building rating system for the country. This has the \npotential  to  avoid  emissions  of  about  2.2  million  tons  of  CO2  over  the  next  10  years. \nDevelopment  of  an  acceptable  rating  system  for  the  Philippines\u2014both  for  new  and  retrofitted \nbuildings\u2014is  a  priority  for  the  Government.  The  proposed  efficient-building  system  will  be \nimplemented as a national voluntary rating scheme.  \n \n\n3. \n\nGovernment Strategy for Energy Efficiency and Tackling Climate Change  \n\nIn  2004,  the  Government  launched  its  National  Energy  Efficiency  and  Conservation \n23. \nProgram,  which  includes  activities  supporting  energy-efficiency  standards  and  labeling, \ndemand-side management, energy management, recognition programs, advisory services, and \nmonitoring. The Department of Energy (DOE) implemented the Philippine Efficient Lighting and \n\n                                                 \n9  Light-emitting diode is commonly seen as a tiny orange or red display light in electronic products. \n10 Usually, the life of light bulbs is shorter\u2014incandescent bulbs last for 800 hours, while CFLs last for 8,000 hours.  \n11 \u201cLighting Africa\u201d is an initiative of the World Bank Group and the International Finance Corporation.  \n12  Consumption is not metered and charges are based on P6 per kWh tariff fixed charge per light.  \n13  McKinsey  &  Company.  2007.  Reducing  US  Greenhouse  Gas  Emissions:  How  Much  at  What  Cost?

In the context of the later this proposed \nproject was formulated at the request of the Government.  \n \nAt about 1.0 ton per capita, the Philippines\u2019 emissions of CO2 are among the lowest in \n24. \nSoutheast  Asia.16 The  country\u2019s  greenhouse  gas  emissions  totaled  100 million  tons  equivalent \nof CO2 in 1994. The Philippines, being a nonannex I17 country in the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change, does not have any immediate restrictions and is not expected \nto implement its climate change commitments unless developed countries provide funding and \ntechnology.  However,  the  Philippines  was  among  the  first  countries  to  create  a  dedicated \norganization to tackle climate change. In May 1991, the Government created the Inter-agency \nCommittee  on  Climate  Change  comprising  15 government  agencies  and  nongovernment \norganization representatives, and in August 2007 the Government established the Presidential \nTask Force on Climate Change, with the DOE secretary as chair.  \n \n25. \nThe task force\u2019s mandate includes (i) undertaking strategic approaches and measures to \nprevent  or  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  including  fuel  efficiency,  energy  conservation, \nuse of renewable energy, and waste management; and (ii) conducting a comprehensive public \ninformation  and  awareness  campaign  nationwide  to  educate  the  public  on  the  climate  change \nsituation and its adverse effects. The task force organized the Energy Summit in January 2008 \nwith ADB as its technical advisor, and led the development of a road map for energy efficiency \n(Appendix 2 and Supplementary Appendix A).  \n \n26. \nPrivate  Sector  Investment  in  Energy  Efficiency.  Since  the  oil  crisis  of  the  1970s, \nESCOs  have  flourished 18  worldwide,  and  despite  low  oil  prices  in  the  last  5\u201310  years, \ninvestments  in  energy  efficiency  have  continued  with  newer  technology.  Recently,  Thailand\u2019s \nEnergy  Efficiency  Revolving  Fund  Program  implemented  200  projects  without  any  credit \ndefaulters  over  5  years.  In  the  United  States,  the  Federal  Energy  Management  Program \ninvested  about  $20  billion  in  energy-efficiency  projects  between  1990  and  2000.  ESCO \nrevenues from these investments were estimated at about $2 billion for 2000.  \n \n27. \nThe  Federal  Building  Initiative  (launched  in  1991  by  the  Government  of  Canada) \nsupported  federal  departments  to  contract  with  ESCOs  to  develop  and  implement  energy-\nefficiency retrofits through performance contracts. By 2006, it delivered 7,500 retrofitted federal \nbuildings  and  other  facilities  attracting  about  $240  million  of  private  sector  investment  and \nannual savings of $33 million. Many other similar programs are supporting ESCO development, \nfor  example,  the  Australian  Government  Energy  Efficiency  Investment  Program,  the  Hungary \nEnergy  Efficiency  Guarantee  Fund,  Bulgarian  Energy  Efficiency  Fund,  and  Energy  Efficiency \n                                                 \n15  The project seeks to encourage consumers in the Philippines to switch from the use of incandescent bulbs to more \n\nenergy-efficient lighting systems. \n\n16  Indonesia  (1.4  tons  per  capita),  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (0.2),  Malaysia  (6.4),  Philippines  (1.0), \n\nSingapore (11.3), Thailand (3.9) and Viet Nam (0.9). \n\n17  Annex  I  countries  include  the  industrialized  countries  that  were  members  of  the  Organisation  for  Economic  \nCo-operation  and  Development  in  1992,  plus  countries  with  economies  in  transition,  including  the  Russian \nFederation, the Baltic States, and several central and eastern European states (http://unfccc.int). \n\n18  An  international  survey  of  the  ESCO  industry,  published  by  the  Lawrence  Berkeley  National  Laboratory  in \nBerkeley, California, in November 2003, collected ESCO activities in 38 countries outside of the United States and \ncalculated the total amount of ESCO activity to be between $560 million and $620 million. \n\n\fLoan  Fund  in  India.19   The  strategy  of  the  Government  of  the  Philippines  is  to  attract  private \ninvestments  in  implementing  energy  efficiency  by  creating  a  conducive  policy  environment  for \nsuch investments.  \n \nClean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM)  Credits.20 The  increase  in  concentration  of \n28. \ngreenhouse  gases  (mainly  carbon  dioxide,  methane,  nitrous  oxide,  hydrofluorocarbons, \nperfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride) in the atmosphere has increased heat retention and \ncaused  changes  in  the  climate.  In  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  the  common  but  differentiated \nresponsibilities  are  recognized  and  emission  reduction  targets  set  for  developed  countries, \nwhich creates a market in emissions reductions. The CDM was defined in the Kyoto Protocol to \npromote lower emissions from projects in developing countries.  \n \nThe  CDM  is  a  market-based  financial  instrument  that  assists  developing  countries  to \n29. \nachieve sustainable development and industrialized countries to meet their emission reduction \ntargets.  It  encourages  investments  in  \u201cclean\u201d  projects  in  developing  countries  that  reduce \nemissions below the baseline scenario. These emission reductions, once verified and certified \n(called certified emission reductions [CERs]), can be acquired by developed countries to comply \nwith  their  commitments  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol.  CERs  are  measured  in  terms  of  carbon \ncredits.  The  advantages  of  the  CDM  are  (i)  a  reduction  in  global  emissions  of  greenhouse \ngases; (ii) assistance to developing countries to meet their sustainable development objectives \nand  promote  cleaner  projects;  (iii)  help  for  industrialized  countries  to  meet  their  emission \nreduction  targets;  and  (iv)  use  of  a  market-based  approach  to  ensure  efficient  reduction  of \ngreenhouse  gases.  The  actual  emission  reductions  have  to  be  monitored,  verified  by \nindependent  parties,  and  then  certified  by  the  CDM  executive  board  to  capture  a  project\u2019s \nbenefit  as  CERs,  which  can  be  traded  in  the  carbon  market.  Each  CDM  project  requires  a \nbaseline  and  monitoring  methodology.  All  energy-efficiency  projects  qualify  for  the  CDM \nmechanism. \n \n\n4. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy  \n\n30. \nADB  has  been  a  partner  in  developing  power  in  the  Philippines,  and  contributed  to \nincreasing the country\u2019s electrification rate of barangays (villages) from 55% in 1986 to 94% in \n2006,  and  of  households  from  less  than  50%  in  1986  to  75%  in  2006.  ADB  assistance  has \neffectively  brought  about  sector  reform;  an  independent  energy  regulator  was  established, \nsubstantial  progress  was  made  in  privatization,  and  the  wholesale  electricity  spot  market  is \noperating. \n \n31. \nHowever, in an environment where global concerns for the threat of climate change are \nwell established, a strategy based solely on conventional energy is no longer sustainable on its \nown.  Making  electricity  rates  more  affordable,  averting  power  shortages  beyond  2012,  and \npromoting  clean  energy  and  energy  efficiency  are  today\u2019s  challenges.  ADB\u2019s  new  strategy  for \nthe  Philippine  energy  sector  will  supplement  its  efforts  in  conventional  energy  with  energy-\nefficiency  and  climate  change  mitigation  initiatives.  ADB  has  been  working  closely  with  DOE \nand the Presidential Task Force on Climate Change to formulate a road map for implementing \n\n                                                 \n19  International  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development/The  World  Bank.  2008.

The road map is being developed with other stakeholders. For energy efficiency, in \n2008,  ADB  proposes  to  finance  a  range  of  pilot  initiatives  that  will  be  scaled  up  as  a  larger \nintervention  in  subsequent  years.  The  pilot  initiatives  cover  proven  energy-efficiency  activities \nthat generate high return on investments, and are included in the Government\u2019s draft road map.  \n \n\n5. \n\nPolicy Dialogue  \n\n32. \nADB acted as technical advisor for the 2008 energy summit and developed an energy-\nefficiency road map for the sector, which encourages all consumers to switch to more efficient \nforms of lighting. Based on ADB\u2019s technical analysis and advice, the Government has decided, \nas a policy, to be the first country in Asia to phase out incandescent bulbs from January 2010.21  \nIf implemented, this will generate considerable savings: $1.3 billion in deferred new generation \ninvestments22 and a reduction of about 900,000 tons of CO2 emissions per year. Despite these \nhigh savings by society, some consumers may see this policy as a burden as the initial cost of a \nquality  CFL\u2014that  actually  lasts  about  10,000  hours\u2014is  more  than  five  times  the  cost  of  an \nincandescent  bulb.  Since  customers  are  not  fully  aware  of  the  energy  savings  potential,  they \nconsider CFLs an expensive choice compared with the cheap incandescent bulb.  \n \n33. \nThe  Government\u2019s  initiatives  to  (i)  phase  out  incandescent  bulbs,  (ii)  implement \nefficiency improvements in government buildings, and (iii) support the development of ESCOs to \nhelp implement energy-efficiency projects need immediate direct investments.  \n \n\n6. \n\nExternal Assistance  \n\nADB is the lead development partner in the Philippine energy sector, with a focus on the \n34. \nelectricity  subsector.  Over  the  last  30  years,  ADB  provided  about  $2.9  billion  in  loans  and \naround $15 million in technical assistance to the sector, mostly focused on conventional energy. \nADB\u2019s assistance to power includes (i) 20 loans to NPC ($1.6 billion) for power generation and \ntransmission  projects,  (ii)  program  loans  for  power  subsector  restructuring  and  debt  liabilities \nmanagement ($1.3 billion), and (iii) 34 technical assistance grants for institutional strengthening \nand various studies (about $15 million).  \n \nADB  takes  the  lead  in  providing  policy  advice  to  the  Government  on  power  subsector \n35. \nrestructuring,  while  continuing  support  to  NPC.  The  World  Bank  has  a  more  prominent  role  in \nrural  electrification  programs.  Other  major  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies  involved  in  the \nsector include the Japan Finance Corporation, Japan International Cooperation Agency, United \nStates  Overseas  Private  Investment  Corporation,  and  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment.  ADB  has  been  coordinating  its  assistance  to  the  sector  with  other  agencies, \nparticularly  the  World  Bank  and  Japan  Finance  Corporation.  In  recent  years  the  Swedish \nInternational Development Cooperation Agency,  United Nations Environment Programme, and \nUnited  Nations  Industrial  Development  Organization  have  provided  assistance  to  the  industry \nsector. A summary of major external assistance to the sector is in Appendix 3. \n \n\n                                                 \n21  In her closing remarks at the 2008 Philippine Energy Summit, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo announced the \n\ncountry\u2019s plans to phase out incandescent bulbs by January 2010. \n\n22  Conservatively, 40 million incandescent bulbs (average 60 watts), replaced by 13-watt CFL, with 70% coincidence \nfactor, or 1,300 MW of deferred investment; 3 hours per day, 1,600 gigawatt-hours; 0.54 kilograms CO2/kilowatt-\nhour, 900,000 tons of CO2. \n\n\f7. \n\nLessons  \n\n36. \nADB\u2019s  recent  involvement  in  the  Philippine  power  subsector  has  been  in  the  form  of \nprogram support related to subsector restructuring. With ADB support, the Philippines is among \nthe first of ADB\u2019s developing member countries to implement fundamental power restructuring, \nwith  substantive  privatization  of  generation  assets,  and  concession  agreements  with  private \nparties to operate transmission assets and achieve a competitive market for electricity. This is \nan  ambitious  and  complex  task  involving  coordinated  actions  on  legislative,  regulatory,  and \npolicy measures spread over a reasonably long period. The process started around 1998 and is \ncontinuing.  \n \n37. \nADB\u2019s interaction with the Government during its Energy Summit and other policy work \nclearly  demonstrates  the  Government\u2019s  willingness  to  support  investments  in  projects  to \nmitigate  the  impact  of  climate  change.  With  volatile  oil  prices  and  strong  Government \ncommitment,  a  broad-based,  energy-efficiency  project  will  set  the  foundation  for  future  ADB \ninvestment,  and  if  implemented  effectively,  will  generate  an  opportunity  for  large-scale \ninvestment in the medium term. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA.   \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n38. \nThe  final  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  reduced  cost  of  power  generation.  As  electricity \ncannot be stored, its supply and demand has to be met instantaneously. During peak times, the \nmarginal  cost  of  generation  is  usually  about  5\u201310  times  more  than  the  average  cost  of \ngeneration. Therefore when the peak demand is reduced by using efficient lighting, the average \ncost of generation is reduced.  \n \nConsumers\u2019 energy costs will be reduced with the use of efficient lighting. With reduced \n39. \nelectricity  demand,  the  overall  need  for  supply  (generation)  will  be  reduced.  Also,  a  large \namount  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions\u2014and  the  associated  cost  of  importing  fuel\u2014will  be \navoided,  creating  carbon  credits  for  the  Project  under  the  CDM.  The  Project  will  establish \nsustainable  business  models  for  large-scale  implementation  of  energy-efficiency  programs.  It \nwill  reduce  public  sector  and  local  government  energy  expenditure,  reduce  health  risks \nassociated with residual mercury and kerosene (in off-grid areas), enhance livelihoods of rural \ncommunities, facilitate a viable ESCO industry, and establish a certification process for energy \nand environmentally efficient commercial buildings. \n \n \nB.    Outputs \n\n(ii)  provision  of  13  million  CFLs \n\nThe  Project  will  have  the  following  outputs:  (i)  implementation  of  lighting  retrofits  in \n40. \nselected  government  buildings, \nto  consumers, \n(iii) implementation  of  energy-efficient  public  lighting  programs,  (iv)  expansion  of  testing \nlaboratory  capacity  and  establishment  of  a  mercury  waste  management  plant  for  fluorescent \nlighting,  (v)  establishment  of  a  super  ESCO,  (vi)  implementation  of  a  certification  scheme  for \nenergy-efficient  buildings,  and  (vii)  development  and  implementation  of  a  communication  and \nsocial mobilization program.  \n \n41.  \nsubsequently scaled up as components of a future project.  \n \n\nThe  Project  has  four  components,  some  of  which  are  pilot  programs  that  could  be \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n1. \n\nComponent 1: Efficient Lighting Initiative \n\n42. \nLighting  accounts  for  more  than  50%  of  the  evening  peak  power  load  in  the  rural \nPhilippines, where unlike in Metro Manila, use of air-conditioning (residential or commercial) is \nrelatively modest. The use of proven technology in efficient lighting can reduce this demand by \n40%\u201380%. The efficient lighting initiative will pilot the use of various efficient lighting options\u2014\nfluorescent  lamps,  CFLs,  LEDs,  sodium  lamps,  and  electronic  ballasts\u2014to  reduce  peak \ndemand. \n \n\na. \n\nSubcomponent 1.1: Retrofit of Government Office Buildings \n\n43. \nThe  goal  of  this  component  is  to  reduce  wasted  energy  in  government  office  buildings \nbecause  of  inefficient  lighting  equipment.  Older-style  fluorescent  lamps,  incandescent  bulbs, \nand  inefficient  magnetic  ballasts  will  be  replaced  by  energy-efficient  alternatives\u2014new  T8 \nfluorescent  lamps,  CFLs,  and  electronic  ballasts,  respectively.  This  will  supplement  DOE\u2019s \ncurrent initiative under the Philippine Efficient Lighting and Market Transformation Project, and \ntarget  about  40  (of  an  estimated  300  nationwide)  selected  government  office  buildings  for  the \nretrofit. Within the limited budget of $3 million, this pilot will save about 7,000 megawatt-hours \nannually,  equivalent  to  about  $1.7  million;  and  avoid  5,000  tons  per  annum  of  greenhouse \nemissions.  \n \n\nb. \n\nSubcomponent 1.2: National Residential Lighting Program \n\n44.  Many residential customers use at least two 40-watt incandescent bulbs. The objective \nof  this  component  is  to  replace  these  two  incandescent  bulbs  with  CFLs:  collect  the  working \nincandescent  bulbs,  gather  them  as  evidence  of  a  government-led  program,  and  claim  CDM \ncredits for the program. The electricity consumption for lighting will be reduced by 80% for these \ncustomers when they switch to energy-efficient CFLs. Overall, this initiative will distribute about \n13 million CFLs, free of charge, to residential and other customers of four private utilities23 and \nabout  108  electric  cooperatives  nationwide.  This  initiative  will  help  customers  to  more  easily \nadjust to the Government\u2019s proposal to phase out incandescent bulbs by 2010. \n \n45. \nCustomers in some off-grid areas will be provided with LED lights under a pilot program \nto  evaluate  the  use  of  LED  lights  in  place  of  kerosene,  candles,  and  other  nonelectric \nalternatives.  \n \nA  budget  of  $18  million,  including  $250,000  for  the  LED  program,  is  allocated  for  this \n46. \ncomponent. Under this component, for example, by replacing two incandescent bulbs with two \nCFLs at no cost, each customer will save about P800 each year. This savings can continue for \nabout 7 years (life of a 10,000-hour lamp for 3\u20134 hours a day average  use), and overall save \neach customer about P6,000 over the next 7 years. The Project will defer investment of about \n$450 million in new power plants in addition to the savings in fuel cost, and avoid about 300,000 \ntons  of  CO2  emission  annually  from  reduced  power  generation,  the  market  value  of  which  is \nabout $3.0 million per year. Households switching to LEDs will save about P600 net per month \nfrom  avoided  use  of  kerosene  lamps.  A  detailed  plan  for  distribution  of  CFLs  and  LEDs  is  in \nAppendix 4. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n23  Manila  Electric  Company,  Cagayan  Electric  Power  and  Light  Company,  Visayan  Electric  Company,  and  Davao \n\nElectric Company. \n\n \n\n\fc. \n\nSubcomponent 1.3: Public Lighting Retrofit Program \n\n47. \nIncandescent bulbs and mercury vapor lamps are used for public lighting in most parts of \nthe  country  outside  the  large  cities.  Under  this  subcomponent,  efficient  CFLs  will  replace \nincandescent bulbs, while high-pressure sodium lamps will replace mercury vapor lamps, thus \nsaving about 60% of the electricity presently used. This component will demonstrate the use of \nLEDs as a replacement for incandescent lamps currently used in traffic lights. Within the limited \nbudget  of  $1.5  million,  this  pilot  can  save  about  9,000  megawatt-hours  annually,  or  about \nP54 million in electricity costs, and avoid greenhouse gas emissions of 5,000 tons per annum.  \n \n\nd. \n\nSubcomponent 1.4: Energy Efficiency Testing and Lamp Waste \nManagement  \n\n48.  Minimum  performance  efficiency  standards  are  commonly  used  to  control  efficiency \nstandards of everyday use appliances. This requires a country to be able to test for compliance \nagainst  a  set  of  technical  standards.  The  Government  introduced  minimum  performance \nefficiency standards for a range of appliances beginning in 1993 and has facilities to test room \nair-conditioners, small refrigerators, and CFLs. It plans to expand the capability of the existing \ntesting laboratory to enable it to test televisions, washing machines, large refrigerators, freezers, \nand  a  range  of  other  consumer  products.  The  budget  for  upgrading  the  appliance-testing \nlaboratory  is  $2.5  million.  The  Government  estimates  that  the  energy-labeling  initiative  could \navoid generation of about 8 million tons of CO2 over 10years.  \n \n49. \nIn  addition, $1.5  million is  allocated to  establishing  a  new  mercury  waste  management \nplant  for  recovery  of  mercury  from  used  fluorescent  lamps,  and  for  preventing  the  residual \nmercury  from  entering  the  food  chain  through  landfill  dumps  leeching  into  groundwater.  The \nGovernment  plans  to  use  a  form  of  extended  producer  responsibility,  which  requires  the \nmanufacturer  or  importer  to  be  responsible  for  waste,  obliging  them  to  internalize  waste \nmanagement  costs  in  their  product  prices,  as  an  option  for  making  the  recovery  of  mercury  a \nviable  commercial  business  model  that  will  attract  private  investors. 24  DOE  has  signed  a \ncommercial  lease  agreement  with  a  private  waste  management  company,  which  has  all \nnecessary permits and clearances to deal with mercury and other hazardous wastes, to locate \nthe facility on its site. \n \n\n2. \n\nComponent 2: Efficiency Initiatives in Buildings and Industries \n\na. \n\nSubcomponent 2.1: Super ESCO  \n\n50. \nDespite  the  high  prices  of  energy,  and  well-established  private  banking  system,  the \nESCO  industry  is  not  well  developed  in  the  Philippines  compared  with  other  countries  in  the \nregion. Lack of access to financing and lack of technical understanding by potential clients are \ntwo  of  the  main  reasons.  Through  this  project  component,  the  Government  will  introduce \nincentives and technical expertise to the industry.  \n \nVarious  models  of  ESCO  operations  have  been  tried  globally.  The  most  appropriate \n51. \nmodel  needs  to  take  account  of  local  conditions  and  participants\u2019  capacity  (footnote  20).  As  a \n\n                                                 \n24 Extended  producer  responsibility  is  a  strategy  designed  to  promote  the  integration  of  environmental  costs \nassociated  with  products  throughout  their  life  cycles  into  the  market  price  of  the  products.  Organisation  for \nEconomic  Co-operation  and  Development.  1999.  Fact  Sheet:  Extended  Producer  Responsibility.  Available: \nhttp://www.oecd.org \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\npilot  under  this  subcomponent,  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  is  to  develop  a  working  model  of  a \nsuper  ESCO  as  a  subsidiary  of  the  Philippine  National  Oil  Company  (PNOC)\u2014a  government-\nowned  corporation  under  DOE.25 This  newly  established  super  ESCO  will  develop  projects  for \nits own implementation (for the public sector) and support development of other ESCOs (for the \nprivate  sector)  by  providing  financial  and  technical  advisory  support.  The  range  of  services \noffered by a typical ESCO includes (i) preliminary feasibility analysis including detailed audits of \nfacilities  and  design  of  energy-efficiency  options  and  financing;  (ii)  installation  services  and \nmanagement;  (iii)  operation,  maintenance,  and  performance  monitoring;  and  (iv)  promotion  of \nenergy-efficiency  technologies  and  services.  A  single  organization  leading  all  ESCO-related \nactivities  will  minimize  transaction  costs  often  necessary  for  successful  implementation  of  a \nbenefit-sharing  mechanism  between  a  range  of  participants  through  financial,  technical,  and \nperformance guarantees. \n \n52. \nPrivately owned ESCOs and end users may be able to utilize both finance and technical \nexpertise of the super ESCO. This component has funding of $8.0 million. The proposed design \nof the super ESCO is presented in Appendix 5.  \n \n\nb. \n\nSubcomponent 2.2: Efficient-Building Initiative \n\n53. \nThis  component  will  accelerate  implementation  of  the  building  rating  system  by \nstreamlining  existing  initiatives  into  a  single  nascent  building  rating  system.  The  system  will \ninclude sustainable site development, indoor air quality improvement, efficient energy and water \nuse  and  management,  solid  waste  management,  preference  for  green  materials,  and \npreservation  of  cultural  contexts.  This  will  be  enforced  through  voluntary  agreements  and \nsupported by developing awareness of the rating system. \n \n54. \nThe Government plans to extend the industry-rating system to (i) rate new and retrofitted \nbuildings, and (ii) expand it in harmony with other initiatives within the Association of Southeast \nAsian  Nations  region.  New  buildings  certified  by  the  rating  system  could  save  up  to  20%  and \nretrofitted  buildings  will  save  up  to  6%  in  energy  costs  annually.  At  least  200  new  and  200 \nretrofitted  buildings  in  each  of  the  commercial  and  industry  sectors,  10 upper-middle-class \ngreen residential projects of 200 units each, and 10 low-cost green residential projects of 1,500 \nunits each are expected to be certified under the new efficient-building rating system over the \nnext 5 years. In addition, all government buildings that have completed energy savings retrofits \ncan apply for certification under the rating system. \n \n\n3. \n\nComponent 3: Communication and Social Mobilization  \n\n55. \nCommunication  and  social  mobilization  activities  will  be  grouped  into  two  streams: \n(i) communication  for  efficient  lighting,  and  (ii)  promotion  of  efficiency  in  everyday  life.  An \nintegrated campaign will be launched based on the detailed marketing plan developed with the \nGovernment  during  project  preparation.  The  communication  plan  themes  are  (i)  widespread \nawareness,  (ii)  widespread  understanding,  (iii)  cooperation  and  participation,  (iv)  development \nof  a  sense  of  urgency,  and  (v)  community  ownership.  A  list  of  communication  and  social \nmobilization requirements for each project component is in Appendix 6. \n\n                                                 \n25  A  super  ESCO  aggregates  activities  of  other  ESCOs  and  brings  financing  for  projects.  It  can  take  the  form  of  a \nleasing  or  financing  company  to  provide  ESCOs  and/or  customers  with  energy-efficiency  equipment  on  lease  or \nbenefit-sharing terms.  \n\n\f4. \n\nComponent 4: Project Implementation Support \n\n56. \nDOE,  the  Executing  Agency,  will  recruit  consultants  under  this  component  to  support \nproject  implementation,  preparation  of  bidding  documents  (including  technical  specifications), \nbid evaluation, and program implementation coordination; and supervision. \n \nC.   \n\nSpecial Features \n\nLinkage  with  Global  Environmental \n\nLinkage with the Philippines\u2019 Climate Change Initiatives. The Government\u2019s planned \n57. \nphase out of incandescent lamps by 2010 has a direct impact on some of the efficient lighting \ninitiatives  proposed  in  this  Project.  Beyond  the  lighting  initiatives,  the  ESCOs  and  potential \nscaled-up projects are the core DOE medium-term programs.  \n \n58. \nInitiatives.  Most  of  the  energy-efficiency \nprograms are inherently linked to global environmental initiatives, including the Kyoto Protocol, \nwhich the Government ratified in 2002. The national residential lighting program (paras. 44-46) \nqualifies for the CDM. The cash payment made in return for the CERs created by the program, \nonce it is registered as a CDM project, will enhance the commercial viability of the program and \nothers like it, and encourage private sector participation in energy-efficiency investment. \n \nD.   \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n59. \nThe project cost is estimated at $46.5 million, including physical and price contingencies, \ninterest and other charges during implementation, and taxes and duties of $2.40 million (Table 1 \nand Appendix 7). \n \nE.   \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $31,100,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \n60. \nresources to help finance the Project. Consideration has been given to the amount of taxes and \nduties, and these do not constitute an excessively high share of project costs. The loan will have \na 25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge \nof 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project \nagreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany  communication  or  advice  from  ADB.  The  Asian  Clean  Energy  Fund 26 under  the  Clean \nEnergy  Financing  Partnership  Facility  will  provide  grant  cofinancing  equivalent  to  $1.5  million.  \nThe Government will finance $13.9 million (Table 2).  \n \n61. \nUnder a subsidiary loan agreement, the Government will make $8 million equivalent of \nthe  ADB  loan  proceeds  available  through  relending  arrangements  to  the  super  ESCO.  The \nsuper  ESCO  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange  risk  for  this  subsidiary  loan  agreement.  The \nBorrower will be the Republic of the Philippines. \n \n\n                                                 \n26 Established by the Government of Japan and administered by ADB. \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\fTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n \n\n  \n \n\nAmount \n\n2.1 Super ESCO  \n2.2 Efficient Building Initiative \n\n1.1 Retrofit Government Office Buildings \n1.2 National Residential Lighting Program \n1.3 Public Lighting Retrofit Program \n1.4 Energy Efficiency Testing and Lamp Waste Management \n\n \nBase Costa \n1.

DOE  will  establish  a  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  to  be \nchaired  by  the  Secretary  of  DOE  or  a  designated  DOE  representative,  which  shall  be \nresponsible for the overall policy guidance. The PSC shall meet at least on a quarterly basis to \nensure  that  the  objectives  of  the  Project  are  being  achieved.  In  addition,  DOE  will  be  the \nImplementing  Agency  for  the  following  subcomponents:  (i) retrofit  of  government  office \n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fbuildings, (ii) testing laboratory and mercury waste recovery plant, (iii) efficient-building initiative, \nand  (iv)  public lighting  retrofits.  Once  incorporated  as  a  subsidiary  of  PNOC,  the  super  ESCO \nwill  be  the  Implementing  Agency  for  the  ESCO  component.  NEA  will  be  the  Implementing \nAgency  for  the  components  involving  the  electric  cooperatives\u2014national  residential  lighting \ninitiative  except  in  the  franchise  areas  of  the  private  utilities.  DOE  will  establish  a  project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU),  headed  by  a  director  and  appropriately  staffed  for  day-to-day \ncoordination.  The  PMU  director  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  supporting  implementation \nand providing guidance, administrative and technical support, counterpart staff, documentation, \nand other required services. \n \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  2  years  from  April  2009.  The  detailed \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n63. \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 8.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n64.  \nAll  procurement  to  be financed  under  the  ADB  loan  and the  Asian  Clean  Energy  Fund \ngrant  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  the \nprocurement  plan  prepared  and  agreed  between  the  Government  and  ADB.  All  procurement \ncontracts  will  contain  anticorruption  provisions  as  specified  by  ADB.  The  procurement  plan  is \nattached as Appendix 9.  \n \n\n4. \n\nAdvance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing  \n\n65.  \nThe  Government  asked  ADB  to  approve  advance  action  to  expedite  the  recruitment  of \nconsultants  and  procurement  of  equipment.  Management  approved  advance  action  for \nprocurement of goods and services, and retroactive financing for an initial supply of CFLs that \nwill be ordered between 1 August 2008 and loan effectiveness, for up to $3.1 million (10% of the \nloan amount). This will cover tendering and bid evaluation for the equipment packages, but not \ninclude  signing  of  contracts,  except  for  the  initial  supply  of  CFLs  under  retroactive  financing. \nAdvance  action  will  allow  DOE  to  initiate  its  communication  plan  and  the  first  stage  of  CFL \ndistribution.  The  Government  and  the  implementing  agencies  were  advised  that  approval  of \nadvance action or retroactive financing does not commit ADB to financing the Project.  \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n66.   Consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  under  the  Project  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  An  international \nconsulting  firm  will  be  engaged  to  manage  implementation  of  the  Project.  The  firm  will  deliver \n127  person-months  of  consulting  services  (40  person-months  of  international  and  87  person-\nmonths of national consulting) following ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection method. Two to \nthree  individual  consultants  will  be  hired  under  the  advance  action  to  develop  bidding \ndocuments for CFL and the waste management facility. They will assist the PMU in managing \nthe Project, preparing the detailed implementation plan (where necessary), developing bidding \ndocuments, supporting procurement-related activities, and preparing progress reports.  \n \nThe  consulting  team  will  closely  work  with  the  professional  media  firm  that  will  be \n67.  \nseparately hired to deliver the communication and social mobilization component. Appendix 10 \nprovides the outline terms of reference for the consultants.  \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n68. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  DOE.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n \n69. \nTo ensure transparency and good governance, DOE will publicly disclose on its website \nand  the  Philippine  Government  Electronic  Procurement  System  information  on  how  loan \nproceeds  are  being  used.  For  each  procurement  contract,  DOE  will  disclose  (i)  the  list  of \nparticipating  bidders,  (ii)  name  of  the  winning  bidder,  (iii)  basic  details  on  bidding  procedures \nadopted,  (iv)  amount  of  the  contract  awarded,  (v)  list  of  goods  and  services  purchased,  and \n(vi) intended  and  actual  utilization  of  loan  proceeds  under  each  contract  being  awarded.  DOE \nwill  ensure  that  all  project  staff  are  fully  aware  of  ADB  procedures,  including  procedures  for  \n(i)  implementation,  (ii)  procurement,  (iii)  use  of  consultants,  (iv)  disbursement,  (v) reporting,  \n(vi) monitoring, and (vii) prevention of fraud and corruption. To strengthen field monitoring of the \ndistribution  of  CFLs  to  customers  under  the  national  residential  lighting  program,  where \npossible,  the  electric  cooperatives  will  enter  into  memorandum  of  agreements  with  qualified \nnon-governmental organizations that are acceptable to ADB to ensure their participation in the \ninspection and monitoring of CFL deliveries. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n70. \nFor  activities  to  be  implemented  by  NEA  and  DOE,  the  ADB  loan  will  be  disbursed  as \ndirect  payments  to  contractors  and  equipment  suppliers.  The  Government  will  establish  two \nimprest  accounts\u2014the  first  managed  by  DOE  to  cover  Project  expenditures  other  than  those \nexpenditures  related  to  subcomponent  2.1  (Super  ESCO),  and  the  second  managed  by  the \nsuper  ESCO  to  cover  Project  expenditures  related  to  subcomponent  2.1  (Super  ESCO).  The \naccount will facilitate timely release of funds for making payments, particularly for expenditures \nunder  small  contracts.  Both  DOE  and  the  super  ESCO  will  operate  and  maintain  the  imprest \naccount in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time \nto  time).  The  advance  to  the  imprest  accounts,  in  aggregate,  will  be  limited  to  10%  of  its \nallocation  financed  by  the  ADB  loan  or  6  months  projected  expenditure  of  the  component, \nwhichever is less. ADB\u2019s statement-of-expenditure procedure will be followed to liquidate and/or \nreplenish  funds  advanced  to  the  imprest  accounts,  and  will  apply  to  individual  payments  less \nthan $100,000. Larger amounts will be disbursed as direct payments.  \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n71. \nAll  agencies  involved  in  project  implementation  will  maintain  separate  accounts \nexclusively  for  project-related  disbursements.  The  PMU  will  review  and  consolidate  these \naccounts  and  have  them  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing  practices  by  the \nsovereign  audit  agency  of  the  Government  or  other  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audit \nreport will include a statement verifying whether or not the funds disbursed by ADB were used \nfor the purpose for which they were provided. The report will include the auditor's opinion on the \n\n \n\n\fuse  of  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditure  procedure.  Copies  of  the  audited \naccounts  and  auditor\u2019s  report  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  6  months  after  the  end  of  each \nfiscal year. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n72. \nThe PMU will prepare quarterly progress reports and submit them to ADB within 20 days \nof the end of the applicable period. The reports will be prepared in a format acceptable to ADB \nand  include  the  following:  (i)  project  progress  in  each  project  area,  (ii)  status  of  institutional \ndevelopment  activities,  (iii)  delays  and  problems  encountered  and  actions  taken  to  resolve \nthem, (iv) compliance with loan covenants, and (v) expected progress during the next 6 months. \nA project performance management system will be developed on the basis of the project design \nand monitoring framework to examine the Project\u2019s technical performance, evaluate delivery of \nProject  facilities,  assess  achievement  of  Project  objectives  and  measure  the  Project\u2019s  social, \neconomic, financial and institutional impacts. Baseline and periodic surveys will be carried out to \ncollect  data  disaggregated  by  income  group,  gender,  types  of  vulnerability  and  other \ncharacteristics as appropriate. Within 12 months of the Project\u2019s physical completion, DOE will \nprepare  and  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  in  ADB\u2019s  standard  format,  including \ncosts and status of compliance with loan covenants.  \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n73. \nIn  addition  to  regular  monitoring,  ADB  and  the  Government  will  jointly  review  project \nperformance  at  least  twice  a  year.  The  review  will  assess  implementation  performance  and \nachievement of project outcomes and objectives, review financial progress, identify issues and \nconstraints affecting the Project, and work out a time-bound action plan for their resolution.  \n \n74. \nIn  2010,  ADB  and  the  Government  will  undertake  a  midterm  review  to  assess \nimplementation  status;  review  project  parameters;  and  take  appropriate  measures  including \nmodifying  the  scope  and  implementation  arrangements,  and  reallocating  loan  and  grant \nproceeds, as appropriate given implementation experience, to achieve the project objectives. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA.   \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\nThe financial viability of the Project was assessed by conducting a financial internal rate \n75. \nof  return  (FIRR)  analysis.  The  FIRR  analysis  compared  the  project  financial  return  to  the \nweighted average cost of capital. The analysis was carried out in real terms using 2008 prices \nand  the  costs  include  capital  investment  and  physical  contingency.  The  financial  analysis \nexamined  the  aggregate  costs  and  benefits  from  the  efficient  lighting  initiatives.  The  financial \nbenefits are measured from the volume of energy savings of each efficient lighting component \nmultiplied  by  energy  costs.  For  the  whole  Project,  the  financial  analysis  shows  an  FIRR  of \n206%, which exceeds the weighted average cost of capital of 2.4%, indicating that the Project is \nfinancially viable (Appendix 11). \n \nB.   \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nThe  value  of  reduced  electricity  consumption\u2014or  savings\u2014due  to  the  use  of  more \n76. \nefficient  lighting  systems  (CFL,  efficient  ballast)  is  evaluated    as  equivalent  to  the  economic \nvalue  of  the  avoided  supply  generation  costs.  Electricity  consumption  in  the  with-project \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\fscenario  is  534  gigawatt-hours  per  year  lower  than  in  the  without-project  scenario.  Apart  from \nthe benefits accrued to society by way of avoided generation costs, the Project is credited with \nenvironmental benefits.  \n \nThe economic internal rate of return of the Project is 99%, implying that the investment \n77. \nwould  be  recovered  once  the  Project  is  implemented.  The  Project\u2019s  net  present  value  is  \n$106 million after 5 years of operation (Appendix 12). \n \nC.   \n\nPotential Carbon Credits \n\n78. \nThe national residential lighting program component has the potential to generate about \n300,000  tons  of  CERs  each  year  (paras.  44\u201346).  ADB\u2019s  carbon  market  initiative  will  help  the \nGovernment register the Project as a CDM project; this is anticipated by March 2009. \n \nD.   \n\nEnvironmental Benefits and Social Safeguards \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment Aspects \n\n79. \nEnvironmental benefits include less air pollution through the reduction of local emissions \nof  sulfur  dioxides;  nitrogen  oxides;  particulate  matters;  and  most  importantly,  CO2.  The \ncomponent addressing lamp waste management will include the collection of spent fluorescent \nlamps  from  households,  institutions,  and  business  establishments.  The  facility  will  enable \nconsumers  to  dispose  of  fluorescent  lamps  without  damaging  the  environment.  Disposal  of \nspent  CFLs  and  fluorescent  tube  lamps  in  landfills  is  among  the  primary  sources  of  mercury \npollution that could migrate to groundwater and also become airborne. Recovery of glass tubes, \naluminum, mercury, and other lamp components by the recycling facility would reduce the need \nfor  production  of  raw  materials.  Mercury  emission  during  recycling  is  negligible.  The  recycling \nfacility has air emission control equipment to ensure that mercury levels comply with applicable \nstandards.  Regular  monitoring  of  indoor  air  quality  will  be  undertaken  during  operation. \nTransport,  storage,  handling,  and  packaging  of  recycled  materials\u2014mercury  in  particular\u2014will \nbe  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  the  Republic  Act  6969  (an  act  to  control  toxic \nsubstances and hazardous and nuclear wastes).  \n \n\n2. \n\nSocial Aspects  \n\n80.  \nThe  project  impacts  were  assessed  in  terms  of  quality  and  reliability  of  access  to \nelectricity.  The  Project\u2019s  social  impact  relates  to  household  and  social  service  organizations. \nThe replacement of incandescent lamps (25\u201360 watts) with 13- to 15-watt CFLs is expected to \nhelp  poor  customers  improve  the  lighting  in  their  houses.  This  is  especially  important  for \nchildren, since reading and doing homework with low lighting can cause eye strain and lead to \npoor  eyesight.  Better  lighting  will  improve  the  household  environment  for  social  and  economic \nactivities. In addition, CFLs will benefit poor customers directly by electricity cost savings. The \nsocial  marketing  and  awareness,  and  motivational  campaign  on  promotion  of  CFLs  will  be \ntargeted  at  both  men  and  women.  The  grassroots  campaigns  will  use  local  social  and \nnongovernment  organizations  to  provide  effective  adoption  and  monitoring  of  CFLs.  Appendix \n13 provides a summary poverty reduction and social strategy. \n \nE.   \n\nSustainability  \n\n81. \nThe project design involved participation of a wide range of stakeholders, including the \nelectric  cooperatives  that  will  be  implementing  the  Project  under  the  leadership  of  NEA.  The \n\n18 \n\n \n\n\fwide range of consultation has helped develop a sense of ownership by all. The Department of \nFinance  has  allocated  the  necessary  amount  of  counterpart  funding  for  the  Project.  The \ndistribution  of  CFLs  will  accelerate  the  switching  from  incandescent  bulbs  to  CFLs  by  all \ncustomers.  \n \nF.    Risks \n\nThe  Project\u2019s  ability \n\nto  create  enough  competition  among \n\n82. \nRisks  that  may  affect  project  implementation,  constrain  attainment  of  objectives,  and \nultimately  impact  project  success  include  (i)  lack  of  political  will  to  support  ongoing  project \nactivities, (ii) institutional weaknesses, and (iii) significant reduction of the price of carbon credits, \nalthough the Project is viable without these.  \n \nThe CFL distribution component has some risks. Risk relates to the efficient and timely \n83. \nprocurement  of  CFLs  and  their  distribution  without  any  being  sold  by  the  commercial  market. \nRisk also relates to the Government\u2019s ability to implement and enforce strict controls on energy-\nefficiency labeling and testing of CFLs. These risks are mitigated by ensuring that (i) the electric \ncooperatives  distribute  the  CFLs  to  customers  at  their  payment  points,  (ii)  each  CFL  will  be \nmarked \u201cnot for sale\u201d, and (iii) suppliers directly deliver the CFLs to the electric cooperatives.  \n \n84. \nEach customer will use their electricity bill as a coupon and be made aware of the free \ndistribution  via  mass  media  communication.  Appropriate  monitoring  mechanisms  for  effective \ndistribution  and  reporting  of  the  CFL  component  will  be  developed.  All  electric  cooperatives \nparticipated  in  developing  the  proposed  distribution  mechanism.  The  mechanism  will  be \noptimized during implementation of the first phase. Lessons from the distribution of the first lot \nwill be incorporated in subsequent distributions. \n \n85. \nlighting \nmanufacturers is not considered a significant risk. About 3 to 5 million units will be procured in \neach of the three lots to ensure strong competition and to discourage market dominance by any \nsingle brand.  \n \n86. \nEstablishment of a super ESCO has some risks. The risks associated in opening up the \npublic sectors\u2014hospitals, schools and office buildings\u2014to private suppliers may (i) take longer \nthan planned during design, (ii) face unforeseen legal barriers, (iii) need many more incentives \nand  encouragement  for  public  sector  managers  to  participate  in  the  process,  and  (iv) be \ndominated by several existing suppliers, inhibiting the growth of the market. DOE will address all \nthese risks in its detailed business plan. \n \n87. \nThe super ESCO will face several risks in developing the ESCO market for the industry \nand  commercial  sectors,  for  example:  (i)  not  enough  ESCOs  will  be  interested  in  the  super \nESCO\u2019s offers (financing and capacity building), (ii) end consumers may not trust a government-\nsupported ESCO because of perceived bureaucracy, (iii) competent staff may not be available \nto implement the super ESCO business plan, (iv) legal and procedural complications may slow \nthe needed quick disbursement, and (v) the ESCOs may not be able to design a benefit-sharing \ncontract  that  will  encourage  all  parties\u2014super  ESCO,  private  ESCOs,  and  end  users\u2014to \ncontinue  energy  efficiency-related  activities  to  make  it  a  sustainable  sector  despite  the  high \ntariffs. Appropriate measures are being developed to address these risks in the ESCO business \nplan. \n \n88. \nInstitutional  Weaknesses.  DOE  does  not  have  an  adequate  number  of  qualified  staff \nfamiliar with ADB procedures; this may affect project implementation.

The  National  Power  Corporation  (NPC),  a  vertically  integrated \n1. \nutility, was set up with the generation and transmission of electricity as its primary responsibility \nPrior  to  the  restructuring  of  the  power  subsector  in  February  2002,  NPC  and  several \nindependent  power  producers  (IPP)  shared  electricity-generating  functions  in  the  country. \nPrivately  owned  Manila  Electric  Company  (Meralco),  16 privately  owned  utilities,  7  municipal \nsystems, and 119 rural electric cooperatives distributed electricity. Thirty-five IPPs (about 8,000 \nmegawatts [MW]) have contracts with NPC for the sale of electricity, while three others (about \n2,000 MW) have contracts with Meralco.  \n \n2. \nPower  Transmission.  The  National  Transmission  Company  (TransCo)  manages  the \ncountry\u2019s  power  transmission  network.  It  manages  approximately  21,319  circuit-kilometers  of \ntransmission lines including a submarine cable system, 93 substations, about 24,310 million volt \namperes substation capacity\u2014a total of about $2.5 billion in assets. As of June 2008, TransCo\u2019s \ngross  reserve  capacity  in  the  Visayas  is  low:  about  50  MW  (peak  load  1,135  MW),  while \nsufficient  margin  exists  in  the  other  two  national  grids\u2014Luzon  reserve  2,751 MW  (peak  load \n8,763 MW) and Mindanao reserve 504 MW (peak load 1,126 MW). Transco plans to double its \ntransmission  infrastructure  by  2014  with  an  estimated  cost  of  $3.70 billion.  According  to \nTransCo\u2014as  committed  by  the  2005\u20132014  Power  Development  Program\u2014the  required \ntransmission  infrastructure  expansion  and  upgrading  needed  to  support  new  generation \ncapacity is nearly 10,475 circuit kilometers of transmission lines and 22,785 megavolt-amperes \nof substation capacity. Long-term plans for a 500-kilovolt system include a meshed grid network \nfor  Luzon.  Meshed  grid  networks  at  138  kilovolts  are  also  planned  for  the  Visayas  and \nMindanao islands. \n \nRural Electrification. In 1969, the Republic Act 6038 created the National Electrification \n3. \nAdministration  (NEA)  as \nthe  rural \nelectrification policy. Within this framework, the rural electricity cooperatives are responsible for \nimplementing  electrification  targets,  and  for  operating  and  maintaining  the  rural  networks.  In \n1999,  NEA  launched  the  Accelerated  Barangay  Electrification  Program, 1 aimed  at  providing \nelectricity to 90% of barangays (villages) by 2004 (and 100% by 2008). Subsequent programs \ngave momentum to renewable electrification, particularly for providing basic lighting services to \nbarangays  in  remote  areas  by  using  solar  photovoltaic  battery  charging  systems  and  home \nlighting systems. In 2004, NEA went through its own restructuring initiative, and reduced its staff \nfrom 730 to 313. It also moved from a loss of P5.6 billion in 2003 to breakeven in 2004. \n \n4. \nBy 2006, the rural electrification program had achieved the following electrification rates: \nan increase from 55% in 1986 to 94% in 2006 in the barangays; and from less than 50% in 1986 \nto  75%  in  2006  for  households.  The  Government  plans  to  continue  the  rural  electrification \nprogram as a priority.  \n \nPower  Shortage  and  High  Electricity  Prices.  In  the  early  1990s,  customers  in  the \n5. \nLuzon  grid  experienced  severe  power  shortages,  leading  to  prolonged  blackouts  and  adverse \nimpacts on the economy. At the peak of the shortage, the blackouts averaged 12\u201314 hours per \n\nthe  primary  agency  responsible \n\nimplementing \n\nfor \n\n                                                 \n1   The  initiative  was  initially  a  partnership  of  the  Department  of  Energy,  National  Electrification  Administration, \nNational Power Corporation through its Small Power Utilities Group, and Philippine National Oil Company\u2013Energy \nDevelopment Corporation. \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nday.  NPC  and  Meralco  contracted  IPPs  to  invest  in  new  power  generation.  The  IPP  contracts \nincluded high-cost premiums to compensate for the high risk perceived by these investors. Most \nhad a take-or-pay feature requiring the power purchasers (NPC or Meralco) to pay even when \nthe  IPPs  were  unable  to  generate  electricity  because  of  transmission  and  other  constraints. \nAccordingly,  NPC  had  to  pay  25%\u201380%  of  the  agreed-on  prices  irrespective  of  the  power \ngenerated,  which  made  IPP  power  25%  more  expensive  than  NPC\u2019s  own  generation  at  the \ntime. In 2001, the actual electricity demand was 55% below the forecast for 2001 provided by \nthe  precrisis  Philippines  Development  Plan  of  1993  (and  revised  high  scenario  of  1996).  This \nmight be part of the reason for the huge surplus of stranded generation capacity of a very high \ntake-or-pay  contract.  This  contingent  liability  for  the  Government  and  a  combination  of  other \nproblems resulted in Philippine power rates being among the highest in the region. \n \nRestructuring  to  Reduce  Debt.  Burdened  with  excessive  debt,  lack  of  competition  in \n6. \nthe  power  subsector,  and  stranded  generation  capacity  with  high  take-or-pay  contracts,  the \nGovernment  decided  to  restructure  and  privatize  the  power  industry.  In  1998,  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  supported  the  Government\u2019s  initiative  with  the  Power  Sector \nRestructuring Program2 for $300 million, which was supplemented by a partial credit guarantee \nin December 2002. The principal objective of the program was to create competitive electricity \nmarkets by unbundling generation and transmission, and providing open access to transmission \nand distribution.  \n \n7. \nUnbundling  and  Privatization.  The  Electric  Power  Industry  Reform  Act,  passed  by \nCongress in 2001, was the blueprint for the 2002 restructuring. The act required the breakup of \nNPC\u2019s  integrated  assets  into  separate  units  for  electricity  generation  and  transmission.  It  also \nmandated the sale of the Government\u2019s equity holding in Meralco, the publicly listed company \nthat  owns  and  operates  the  country\u2019s  largest  electricity  distribution  network.  In  2001,  the \nGovernment  established  an  independent  regulator,  the  Energy  Regulatory  Commission  (ERC) \nto oversee competition and monopoly regulation. \n \n8. \nBy  March  2003,  NPC\u2019s  assets  were  organized  into  two  state  holding  companies: \n(i) TransCo, which took on much of NPC\u2019s transmission assets, and (ii) the Power Sector Assets \nand  Liabilities  Management  Corporation,  which  assumed  control  of  the  power-generating \nassets.  The  restructuring  initiative  reached  an  important  juncture  by  2006  as  the  legal, \nregulatory,  and  institutional  framework  for  privatization  and  competition  were  largely  in  place. \nHowever,  for  the  restructuring  to  succeed,  financial  viability  had  to  be  restored,  regulatory \nperformance improved, and the confidence of private sector investors increased. In November \n2006,  ADB  support 3  consolidated  the  restructuring  process  by  (i)  correcting  the  long-term \nfinancial  problems  of  the  subsector,  (ii)  strengthening  regulatory  performance,  (iii)  enhancing \nconditions for privatization, and (iv) improving public confidence in the reforms.  \n \nBy  early  2008,  the  Government  awarded  a  25-year  concession  to  operate  the  national \n9. \npower  grid  to  a  consortium  for  $3.95  billion,  and  the  Power  Sector  Assets  and  Liabilities \nManagement Corporation formally approved the sale of more than 1,855 MW or 44% of NPC\u2019s \ngeneration assets in support of the Government's revised target of 70% privatization before the \nend of 2008.  \n \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB.  1998.

As  part  of  its  sector  restructuring  policy \npackage, the Government established a competitive electricity spot market to facilitate electricity \ntrading  among  market  participants.  The  Luzon  WESM  began  commercially  operations  in  mid-\n2006.  During  6  months  from  June  to  December  2006,  the  volume  of  electricity  traded  in  the \nLuzon  WESM  reached  approximately  21  gigawatt-hours  (GWh),  with  20 generators  and  15 \ncustomers participating in the market.  \n \n11. \nIn April 2008, the Department of Energy (DOE) deferred the proposed launching of the \nVisayas WESM on the grounds that although the market operator and its technical systems are \nin  place,  DOE  needed  to  review  the  situation  given  the  Visayas  inadequate  capacity  in \ntransmission  and  generation.  DOE\u2019s  decision  was  based  on  a  study  highlighting  the  tight \ndemand and supply balance situation in Cebu, Negros, and Panay; and indicating that some of \nthe Visayas participants are not ready to effectively operate in an extended WESM.4   \n \n12. \nCross-Subsidies  Removed.  Beginning  in  2002,  the  energy  regulator,  ERC,  removed \nthe  intergrid  cross-subsidies  to  make  prices  more  reflective  of  the  underlying  cost  and  to \nimprove pricing signals to end consumers. This was followed by ERC\u2019s approval of the removal \nof  interclass  cross-subsidies  for  Meralco  customers.  With  the  removal  of  the  cross-subsidies, \nMeralco\u2019s  rates  for  each  kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  were  reduced  for  commercial  customers  (P0.70) \nand across a range of industrial customers (P0.27\u2013P0.89). These decreases were accompanied \nby rate increases to residential and other customers: residential and general service customers \n(P0.71), small industrial customers (P1.01) and government hospitals (P1.08). Cagayan Electric \nPower and Light Company (Cepalco) and Bukidnon II Electric Cooperative (Buseco) were also \ndirected to remove interclass cross-subsidies. As of 2004, ERC had approved unbundled rates \nfor  133  utilities  (including  Meralco)  to  bring  transparency  in  electricity  pricing;  showing \ngeneration,  transmission,  distribution,  and  supply  costs  separately  on  customers\u2019  bills.  The \nlifeline  subsidy\u2014a  subsidy  paid  to  consumers  using  less  than  100  kWh  per  month\u2014was \nexempted from the phaseout for 10 years, as mandated by the Electric Power Industry Reform \nAct.  As  of  October  2007,  Meralco  had  1.7  million  lifeline  customers,  about  43%  of  all  its \nresidential customers. The lifeline rate is supported by a contribution of P0.1132 per kWh by all \nother Meralco customers. \n\n \nTable A2.1: System Peak Demand \n( i n  megawatts) \n \nVisayas  Mindanao \n\nLuzon \n2,311 \n2,973 \n3,920 \n5,450 \n6,443 \n6,466 \n6,643 \n\n256 \n380 \n628 \n749 \n1,037 \n1,066 \n1,102 \n\n470 \n621 \n780 \n939 \n1,149 \n1,228 \n1,241 \n\nTotal Noncoincident Peak \n3,037 \n3,983 \n5,351 \n7,150 \n8,632 \n8,763 \n8,993 \n\nYear \n1985 \n1990 \n1995 \n2000 \n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n\n               Source: Department of Energy. \n\n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n4   Intelligent  Energy  Systems.  2008.

public, and how some of the options could assist in addressing climate change. \nStakeholders  acknowledged  that  while  the  introduction  of  competition  and  open  access  in  the \nwholesale  electricity  market  and  better  targeting  of  existing  subsidies  can  reduce  electricity \ntariffs in the short term, a more effective solution for the longer term would focus on increasing \nthe use of indigenous renewable energy sources  (such as geothermal energy, biomass, wind, \nand hydropower) and promoting energy efficiency. \n\n \n3.00 \n6.00 \n4.00 \n8.00 \n4.00 \n(9.00) \n14.00

Since 1971, ADB has provided 28 loans for \na  total  of  $2.9  billion  to  the  energy  sector.  This  includes  20  loans  to  the  National  Power \nCorporation  (NPC),  guaranteed  by  the  Government,  with  a  combined  value  of  $1.6  billion.  In \naddition,  ADB  provided  two  program  loans  for  power  sector  restructuring  and  debt  liabilities \nmanagement  totaling  $750  million  and  a  partial  credit  guarantee  of  $500  million.  ADB  also \nof  \nprovided \n$15.5  million,  covering  areas  such  as  (i)  coal  industry  development,  (ii)  rural  electrification,  \n(iii)  energy  conservation,  (iv)  tariff  and  pricing  studies,  (v) regulation,  (vi)  consumer  impact \nassessment,  (vii)  geothermal  steam  and  natural  gas  pricing  studies,  (viii)  power  development \nplanning, (ix) feasibility studies, and (x) environmental assessments. \n \n2. \nThe World Bank also has been active in the power subsector. To improve coordination \nof their operations, ADB and the World Bank reached an understanding in 1998 on the division \nof  responsibility  for  power.  ADB  would  take  the  lead  in  providing  policy  advice  to  the \nGovernment  on  power  restructuring,  while  continuing  support  to  NPC  before  its  privatization. \nThe World Bank would assume a more prominent role in rural electrification programs. ADB has \nbeen coordinating its assistance with other agencies, including the Japan Bank for International \nCooperation.  Other  major  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies  involved  include  the  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, United States Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and \nUnited States Agency for International Development (Table A3).  \n \nis  scaling  up  energy-efficiency  market \n3. \ntransformation  efforts  by  building  on  the  legacy  outputs  of  previous  and  ongoing  capacity \nbuilding,  technology  demonstration,  and  barrier  removal  projects  funded  by  the  Global \nEnvironment Facility (through its implementing agencies, the International Finance Corporation \nof the World Bank Group and the United Nations Development Programme), Japan International \nCooperation  Agency  and  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development.  The  Swedish \nInternational Development Cooperation Agency,  United Nations Environment Programme, and \nUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization have provided smaller grant assistance to \nthe  industry  sector  in  recent  years.  While  these  programs  were  useful  in  clearing  the  market \nbarriers  to  commercializing  energy-efficiency  technologies  and  mainstreaming  demand-side \nmanagement  measures,  none  was  able  to  scale-up  and  sustain  the  desired  transformation  of \nthe local energy-efficiency market. \n\nfield  of  energy  efficiency,  ADB \n\nthe \n\nIn \n\n \nTable A3: Summary of External Assistance \n \n\nMultilateral and Bilateral \nAgencies \nThe World Bank Group \n\nGlobal Environment Facility  \n\n \nActivities \nIn  2003,  the  World  Bank  approved  the  Rural  Power  Project  with  a \ncredit  line  of  $20  million  to  support  rural  electrification  projects.  The \nInternational  Finance  Corporation,  as  the  Government-appointed \ntransaction  advisor,  assists  the  Government  in  implementing  private \nsector  participation  in  areas  currently  served  by  the  National  Power \nCorporation\u2019s Small Power Utilities Group. \n\nDuring 2000\u20132005, the Global Environment Facility provided $2 million \nfor  the  Efficient  Lighting  Initiative:  Philippines  country  program, \n$10  million  for  the  Philippine  Electric  Cooperative  System  Loss \nReduction  Project,  $3  million  for  the  Philippine  Efficient  Lighting \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nMultilateral and Bilateral \nAgencies \n\nJapan Finance Corporation  \n\nJapan International Cooperation \nAgency \n\nUnited States Overseas Private \nInvestment Corporation \n\nUS Agency for International \nDevelopment \n\nOther Bilateral Assistance \n\n \nActivities \nMarket  Transformation  Project,  and  $3  million  for  the  Capacity \nBuilding to Remove Barriers to Renewable Energy Project. \nThe bank is providing financing for transmission systems particularly in \nthe  Visayas  and  Mindanao;  and  is  involved  in  supporting  private \ninvestors for power generation plants. \n\nThe  agency  is  providing  institutional  support  to  the  Department  of \nEnergy for the preparation of the power sector development program \n(including  demand  forecast  methodology),  transmission  development \nplan, and missionary electrification development plan. \n\nThe corporation\u2019s substantial exposure to the power subsector is well \ndiversified  and  all  of  its  National  Power  Corporation  related  risk  is \ncounterguaranteed by the Government of the Philippines. In 2003, the \ncorporation insured a $250 million 15-year National Power Corporation \nand  Power  Sector  Assets  and  Liabilities  Management  Corporation \nbond with non-honoring of sovereign guarantee coverage.  \n\nThe  agency,  through  the  United  States  Department  of  Energy, \nprovides  technical  assistance  to  the  Energy  Regulatory  Commission \n(and its predecessor Energy Regulatory Board) in utility demand-side \nmanagement,  tariff  setting,  rate  unbundling,  and  removal  of  cross-\nsubsidies;  guidelines  on  open  access;  and  relevant  institutional \nstrengthening, including training. \n \nBilateral aid agencies from Australia, Denmark, France, Germany, and \nUnited Kingdom have been providing support to strengthen the Energy \nRegulatory  Commission,  and  to  develop  new  and  renewable  energy \nand  rural  electrification.  The  Swedish  International  Development \nCooperation  Agency  provided  assistance \nto  accelerate  energy-\nefficiency retrofits in the industry sector. \n \n\nSources: Asian Development Bank, Department of Energy, and World Bank. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 4     33      \n\nCOMPACT FLUORESCENT LAMP DISTRIBUTION PLAN \n \n\nCFL Market Impact \n\n1. \nThe Philippine Energy Efficiency Project provides for the purchase of 13 million energy-\nefficient compact fluorescent lamps (CFL) for free distribution to the customers in metropolitan \nareas of Manila; the cities of Cebu, Cagayan de Oro, and Davao; and approximately 108 electric \ncooperatives covering all regions. The program will be implemented under programmatic Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism (CDM) guidelines, and involve the adoption of independent monitoring \nand  verification  of  savings  consistent  with  the  methodology  of  the  United  Nations  Framework \nConvention on Climate Change. This includes the collection of the replaced incandescent bulbs, \npreparation of inventories, certification, and safe disposal. \n \n2. \nThe  free  distribution  will  be  on  the  basis  of  two  CFLs  of  13,  14,  or  15-watt  capacity \n(equivalent to 60\u201375 watt incandescent lamps) to residential and other customers in the electric \ncooperatives.  \n  \nA.  \n \n3. \nThe  Government  intends  to  phase  out  incandescent  bulbs  by  2010.  It  estimates  that \nabout 40 million incandescent bulbs are currently in the Philippines market.1 Although the use of \nCFLs  has  significantly  increased  over  the  past  few  years,  the  availability  of  low-quality  lamps \nhas distorted customer perceptions of CFLs. The distribution of free CFLs (international quality, \n10,000  hours  life)  to  residential  consumers  predominantly  in  rural  areaswill  provide  an \nopportunity  to  influence  their  adoption  of  CFLs.  The  current  retail  cost  of  CFLs  is  expected  to \ndecrease  because  of  economies  of  scale  from  increasing  popularity,  which  would  assist  in \naddressing the current price gap between CFLs and incandescent bulbs. The quality of CFLs in \nthe market will increase as the market will look for CFLs with long lives\u2014similar to the 10,000-\nhour bulbs to be distributed under the Project. \n \nB.  \n \n4. \nProcurement  of  the  13  million  CFLs  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB). In view of the multiple packages to be procured and the profusion of CFL manufacturers \nin  the  world  (many  of  whom  are  inexperienced,  have  limited  capacity,  and  offer  inferior \nproducts),  ADB\u2019s  single-stage,  two-envelope  procurement  procedure,  wherein  bids  with \nseparate envelopes for technical and financial proposals are submitted simultaneously, will be \nused. The project management unit (PMU) will open the technical proposal first and review the \nresponsiveness  of  the  bidding  documents.  Only  financial  proposals  of bidders  with  responsive \ntechnical  proposals  will  be  opened  for  evaluation  and  comparison.  The  financial  proposals  of \nbidders  whose  technical  proposals  are  not  responsive  will  be  returned  unopened.  CFLs \nprocured will meet relevant international standards.  \n \n5. \nCertain  manufacturers  adopt  their  own  individual  standards  within  the  13-  to  15-watt \nrange for \u201cwatts per lumen\u201d output criteria, with other manufacturers producing 13-, 14-, or 15-\nwatt  CFLs  as  standard  with  slight  variance  in  lumen  output.  A  consultant  expert  in  efficient \nlighting  and  its  procurement  will  help  the  PMU  prepare  specifications  and  tender  documents. \nThe bidding documents will incorporate the following special provisions: \n \n\nProcurement Procedures \n\n                                                 \n1   The  Philippines  Lighting  Industry  Association  estimates  68  million,  but  other  industry  experts  have  lower \n\nestimations. The report and recommendation of the President assumes 40 million for all calculations. \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nCFLs must meet the highest international technical and environmental standards. \nBidding will be undertaken in specified batches to provide phased CFL regional \ndeliveries  to  accommodate  implementation  and  coordination  abilities,  not  to \nexceed 1 year. \nOnly screw fixings will be specified. \nDelivery time frames for individual batches and explicit delivery locations will be \nprovided. \nCriteria will be included for evaluating 13- to 15-watt CFLs (watts versus lumen \noutput) for bid equalization. \n\nPreparatory Works \n\n \n6. \nThe  CFLs  will  be  procured  in  three  lots  with  about  3  million\u20135  million  in  each  lot.  The \nCFLs will be delivered by the winning bidder to each electric cooperative and distribution utility \nin  the  quantities  specified  in  each  package.  The  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  will  finalize  the \nallocation during preparation of specifications and bidding documents.  \n \nC.  \n \n7. \nIn  preparation  for  the  procurement  and  distribution  of  the  CFLs,  the  PMU  (with  the \nassistance  of  its  energy-efficiency  lighting  expert)  will  undertake  the  following  preparatory \nactions:  (i) prepare  a  detailed  list  of  all  eligible consumers  in  each  of  the  participating  utilities; \n(ii) design vouchers for distribution to eligible consumers for collection of CFLs in exchange for \nworking  incandescent  bulbs;  (iii)  prepare  monitoring  sheets  and  reporting  formats  for  sales \nmonitoring,  inventories  of  incandescent  lamps,  breakages,  and  lamp  failures  (and  warranty \nreplacements);  (iv)  design  and  specify  appropriate  labeling  for  each  CFL  (to  be  indelibly \nattached  in  the  factory)  and  that  the  CFL  is  \u201cnot  for  sale\u201d; 2  and  (v)  prepare  draft  bidding \ndocuments for CFL procurement under advance action. \n\n \nDistribution and Installation  \n\nD.  \n \n8. \nTo determine the most secure and efficient method of CFL distribution in the Philippines, \na  consultative  workshop  was  undertaken  with  representatives  from  participating  distribution \nutilities and electric cooperatives. They recommended the following distribution methodology as \nbeing the most efficient and secure in the Philippine context:  \n \n\n(i)  \n\n(ii)  \n(iii)  \n\n(iv)  \n\n(v)  \n\nThe appointed suppliers will deliver the CFLs in prearranged quantities (batches) \nto all the distribution utilities.  \nThe distribution utilities are responsible for internal distribution to their suboffices.  \nVouchers in the form of electricity bill inserts or \u201ctear-off\u201d slips with the customer \naccount number will be issued to all eligible customers in one billing cycle. The \nvouchers can be exchanged for the CFLs on a first-come first-served basis. New \nconnections will not be eligible for the program.  \nEach  distribution  utility  will  distribute  the  CFLs  by  having  eligible  consumers \ncollect  the  CFLs  at  the  utility\u2019s  payment  points  (or  other  designated  secure \ndistribution points) in exchange for appropriate CFL vouchers.  \nEach  consumer  account  will  be  eligible  to  exchange  two  working  incandescent \nbulbs (of any wattage) for two CFLs (of single wattage).  \n\n                                                 \n2  CFLs distributed will be certified accredited laboratory protocol, and branded with a program logo and the product \nbrand  name.  The  CFL  should  have  a  hologram  (or  similar)  with  a  unique  serial  number  that  can  be  used  during \nprogram monitoring and guarantee follow-up. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4     35      \n\n(vi)  \n\nAny excess CFLs will be returned to the National Electrification Administration for \nredistribution and not sold to the market.  \n\n(vii)   The incandescent bulbs collected will be made inoperable without damaging the \nglass  and  stored  in  specially  designed  colored  containers  for  each  wattage  \n(e.g., green for 25 watts, red for 40 watts, orange for 50 watts, blue for 60 watts, \nyellow  for  75  watts,  and  brown  for  100  watts).  Using  this  simple  method  for \ncollecting  incandescent  bulbs  will  help  distribution  utilities  and  the  National \nElectrification  Administration  calculate  the  loads  taken  off  the  system.  The \ndistribution utility will keep an inventory of the incandescent bulbs.  \n\n(viii)   The  incandescent  bulbs  will  be  audited  independently  under  CDM-approved \n\n(ix)  \n\narrangements to enable carbon credits to be obtained.  \nA  contractor  will  be  appointed  to  crush  the  incandescent  lamps  so  that  they \ncannot find their way back into the market. \n\n \n9. \nDOE  will  finalize  the  mode  of  distribution  of  light-emitting  diodes  in  off-grid  areas  and \nCFLs in the metropolitan areas of Manila and the Cities of Cebu, Cagayan de Oro, and Davao \nduring implementation of the project.  \n\n \n\nPreparation of Baseline  \n\nE. \n \nDuring the preparatory works and the distribution process, a baseline will be prepared to \n10. \nassist in determining the peak reduction resulting from the CFL initiative and for submission to \nthe  CDM  authorities  to  justify  appropriate  CDM  credits.  The  consultant with  DOE  will  carefully \nresearch  all  the  CDM  requirements  and  prepare  all  checklists,  questionnaires,  and  databases \nfor preparation of the baseline. \n \nF.   \n \nDOE,  with  the  assistance  of  the  energy-efficiency  expert,  will  establish  a  scheme  for \n10. \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  after  program  implementation  begins.  An  independent  entity  is \nproposed  for  this  work,  which  would  reinforce  the  CDM  procedural  requirements,  particularly \nauditing.   \n \n\nPost Installation Monitoring  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \nFinancing Facility in the Form of a Super Energy Service Company  \n\nA. \n\nSUPER ENERGY SERVICE COMPANY \n\nAn energy service company (ESCO) promotes energy efficiency for end users. A super \n1. \nESCO supports capacity development and activities of others ESCOs, and brings financing for \nprojects. It can also take the form of a leasing or financing company to provide ESCOs and/or \ncustomers with energy-efficiency equipment on lease or on benefit-sharing terms. ESCOs can \nbe  an  important  institutional  mechanism  for  the  delivery  of  energy-efficient  investment.1 The \nGovernment plans to promote the ESCO industry by setting up a super ESCO, which will act as \nan  ESCO  for  the  public  sector  (hospitals,  schools,  and  other  public  facilities)  and  as  a  super \nESCO  for  the  private  sector  (industrial  and  commercial  customers).  For  the  private  sector \nclients, it will work through the smaller ESCOs. It will support independent ESCOs working with \ncustomers to design and install energy-efficiency projects on a fee-for-service basis. They may \neither use their own equity or borrow funds to finance energy-efficiency projects using a shared \nsavings or equipment rental contracting arrangement.   \n \nB. \n\nJustification for Creating a Super ESCO \n\n2. \nThe Philippines ESCO industry is a case of market failure. Despite high power tariffs, the \nESCO industry is limited to a few utility-owned (3), independent (consultants) (4), and vendor-\nowned  (6)  businesses.  Lack  of  access  to  financing,  and  lack  of  understanding  of  energy \nefficiency  are  the  main  reasons  for  this.  Of  13  participants,  only  6  are  capable  of  organizing \nfinancing.  A  super  ESCO  can  remove  these  barriers  by  bringing  new  risk  capital  for  project \nfinancing.  In  the  Philippines,  a  super  ESCO  can  easily  operate  with  a  quasi-banking  license2 \nissued by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the central bank, allowing it to borrow for onlending. \nThis  is  not  allowed  in  many  countries,  for  example  Brazil.  The  Brazilian  constitution  limits  the \nability of a \u201cservice\u201d company to invest in project finance. Leasing is a financial function and is \nlimited to financial corporations, which are regulated by the Brazilian Central Bank. This is one \nreason why Brazil had to take the relatively expensive financial guarantee route for promoting \nenergy  efficiency.  International  experience  suggests  that  the  presence  of  a  large  number  of \nESCO-like  companies  is  a  prerequisite  for  the  success  of  any  guarantee  fund  for  energy \nefficiency. If ESCOs are not present, then the market will not likely be able to produce quality \ndeal flow for the funds to survive. This is one other reason why the Government has decided to \nset up a super ESCO, rather than a simple financing facility. \n \nSuper ESCO models are common is the United States. The state of California was one \n3. \nof the pioneers of the super ESCO concept in the world. Countries like Australia, Canada and \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China also use public-owned ESCOs to promote this sector. Since in \nthe  energy-efficiency  business,  the  ESCOs\u2019  clients  usually  have  stronger  balance  sheets  than \nthe  ESCOs,  the  loan  to  the  client  is  often  used  as  an  option,  a  common  practice  in  North \nAmerica. This creates two types of projects: shared savings projects, and guaranteed savings \nprojects when the loan is to the client. In the long term, the super ESCO would build its balance \nsheet  for  evaluation  by  lending  institutions  by  raising  equity  capital.  The  investor  in  the  super \nESCO  will  receive  a  risk-adjusted  rate  of  return.  When  access  to  other  forms  of  financing \nbecomes  easily  available,  and  the  ESCO  market  expands,  the  Government  may  transfer  the \nsuper ESCO to the private sector.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1   World Bank. 2008.

The  project  costs  include  all  the  capital \ninvestments  for  efficient  lighting  (component  1),  efficiency  initiatives  in  buildings  and  industries \n(component 2), and communication and social mobilization (component 3). The investments for the \nefficient  lighting  initiative  include  36-watt  fluorescent  tube  lightings  for  government  buildings;  13, \n14,  or  15-watt  compact  fluorescent  lamps  (CFL)  for  residential  users; and  70-watt,  150-watt,  and \n250-watt  high-pressure  sodium  vapor  lamps  with  poles  for  public  lighting.  All  capital  costs  are \nexpressed  in  real  terms  using  mid-2008  prices.  The  FIRR  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  base \ncosts, excluding price contingency and financial charges during implementation. \n \nThe project component of efficient lighting initiatives is to distribute energy-efficient lights for \n4. \ngovernment buildings, residential use, and public lighting retrofit. Financial benefits are measured \nby  energy  cost  savings  from  replacing  old  lighting  with  new  fixtures.  The  energy  savings  is \n                                                 \n1   Calculation of ADB\u2019s cost of funds is conducted as follows: (i) 5-year swap rate as of December 2008 = 2.4%; (ii) ADB \n\n \n  \n\n  \n  \n\nloan spread = 0.20%; (iii) nominal cost of ADB funds = 2.4 + 0.2 = 2.6% \n\n2   Referring to the market rate of the Government\u2019s 5-year local currency bonds.  \n3   Source: ADB estimates on domestic cost escalation factor for the Philippines and World Bank manufacturers unit value \n\nindex. \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\ncomputed from the volume of electricity savings from the use of efficient lighting multiplied by the \nGovernment\u2019s  energy  costs.  Energy  costs  for  government  buildings  and  CFL  distribution  were  \nP8  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  ($0.16  per  kWh)  and  public  lighting  of  P6  per  kWh  ($0.12  per  kWh), \nwhich were used during the periods of analysis.  \n \nThe payback period and FIRR of each efficient lighting fixture were calculated. The financial \n5. \nbenefits of using efficient lighting are very high with short payback periods (capital cost divided by \ncost savings) of 2.0 years for government buildings, 2.1 months for CFL distribution, and 4.1 years \nfor public lighting (Table A11.2).4  \n \n\nTable A11.2: Financial Benefit by Efficient Lighting \n \n\n \n\nComponents \nInvestment amount ($ million) \nCost per fixture (P) \nAnnual savings/fixture (kWh/year) \nAnnual savings per fixture (P/year) \nPayback period (year) \nFIRR (%) \nCFL = compact fluorescent lamp, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, kWh = kilowatt-hour. \na  The FIRR of CFL distribution was not calculated because it produces positive net benefit from the initial year.

This high FIRR is due to \nthe  strong  financial  benefits  of  CFL  distribution,  and  reflects  the  short  payback  period  of  \n2.1 months. The FIRR exceeds the weighted average cost of capital, and therefore, the Project is \nfinancially viable. \n \n\nTable A11.3: Financial Analysis of the Project \n \n2011 \n\n2009 \n\n2010 \n\n2012 \n\n2008 \n\n2013 \n\nItem \n\n2014 \n\n2015 \n\n2016 \n\n2017 \n\nInvestment cost ($ million) \n\n(5.4) \n\n(33.6) \n\n(3.6) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEnergy savings from the \n\n53.4 \n\n534.0 \n\n534.0 \n\n534.0 \n\n534.0 \n\n534.0 \n\n480.9 \n\n3.0 \n\n2.7 \n\nProject (gigawatt-hour) \n\nEnergy cost (P/kilowatt-hour) \n\nEnergy cost saving ($ mil) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNet benefit ($ million) \n\n(5.4) \n\n(24.8) \n\n \n\nFinancial internal rate of return  = 206% \n\n( ) = negative. \nNotes:   (i) Life of CFL and lighting fixture is 6\u20138 years. \n \nSources: Asian Development Bank and consultants estimates. \n\n(ii) Energy cost of P6/kilowatt-hour is used for public lighting component. \n\n \n\n8.0 \n\n8.8 \n\n8.0 \n\n87.8 \n\n84.2 \n\n8.0 \n\n87.8 \n\n87.8 \n\n8.0 \n\n87.8 \n\n87.8 \n\n8.0 \n\n87.8 \n\n87.8 \n\n8.0 \n\n87.8 \n\n87.8 \n\n8.0 \n\n79.0 \n\n79.0 \n\n8.0 \n\n0.4 \n\n0.4 \n\n8.0 \n\n0.3 \n\n0.3 \n\n                                                 \n4   Assumption of  the benefit calculation (case  of compact fluorescent lamp  (CFL) distribution A1.2): A  14-watt CFL  will \nreplace 50.7-watt incandescent lamps, saving 36 watts.

Annual \nsavings in $ = 40.2 kWh x $0.16 per kWh = $6.4 per year. Therefore, the payback period will be $1.17/$6.4 = 0.18 year \nor 2.1 months. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 12     53      \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\nProject Costs \n\nProject Cost\u2013Benefit Analysis \n\nNational Residential Lighting Program \n\nEvaluation of Project Costs and Benefits \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  project  components  complement  each  other  to  reduce  electricity  consumption  for \n1. \nlighting  in  the  country.  Three  components\u2014retrofitting  of  government  buildings,  distribution  of \ncompact  fluorescent  lamps  (CFL),  and  efficient  lamps  for  public  lighting\u2014directly  result  in \nreduction  of  electricity  consumption.  The  other  components  facilitate  this  reduction.  In  this \nanalysis,  the  physical  benefit  of  the  Project  is  the  amount  of  electricity  saved  by  introducing \nmore efficient lighting systems in households, government buildings, and public lighting.  \n \nB. \n \n \n \n2. \nThe  costs  of  the  Project  (to  society)  are  the  costs  of  equipment  (lamps),  labor,  and \nimplementation.  They  include  physical  contingencies  but  exclude  interest  during  construction \nand price contingencies. The total project cost is estimated at $42.6 million expressed in 2008 \nprices.  \n \n \n \n3. \nThe program will distribute 13 million CFLs throughout the country. By procuring these at \nwholesale price, the price per lamp will be reduced by almost 50% of the retail price. A survey \nconducted  during  the  implementation  of  a  Philippines\u2019  demand-side  management  project \ndetermined  the  average  wattage  of  incandescent  bulbs  to be  around  50  watts.  Based  on  this, \nsingle  wattage  CFLs  will  be  procured  (13,  14,  or  15  watts),  equivalent  to  at  least  60-watt \nincandescent bulbs. Each replacement results in a saving of 39 watts. With 3 hours of use per \nday,  each  replacement  saves  about  42.7  kilowatt-hours  (kWh)  annually  contributing  to  total \nannual energy savings amount to 534 gigawatt-hours (GWh)/year and capacity savings to 450  \nmegawatts (MW). \n \n \n \n4. \nThis  program  will  replace  the  standard  T12  fluorescent  tube  lamps  with  standard \nmagnetic  ballasts  with  efficient  36-watt  T8  fluorescent  tube  lamps  and  electronic  ballasts.  Any \nincandescent lamps will be replaced with CFLs. The savings result from lower consumption of \nelectricity  of  the  electronic  ballasts  (1  watt)  as  compared  to  the  magnetic  ballasts  (40  watts). \nThis program results in savings of 9 GWh. \n \n \n \n5. \nThis program will use high-pressure sodium lamps as a replacement for mercury vapor \nlamps;  and  the  use  of  light-emitting  diodes  for  traffic  signals.  The  program  is  based  on  an \nimplementation model established between the Department of Energy (DOE), City of Cagayan \nDe Oro (local government unit), and Cagayan Electric Power and Light Company (electric utility) \nunder  the  Philippine  Efficient  Lighting  Market  Transformation  Project.  The  program  will  yield \nannual energy savings of 1.5 GWh.  \nAmong  the  three  components,  the  CFL  program  yields  the  greatest  savings  and  thus \n6. \nplays a predominant role in the viability of the whole Project. To evaluate the project benefits, \nthe societal value of electricity savings resulting from the Project must be estimated. \n\nRetrofitting of Lighting Systems in Government Buildings \n\nRetrofitting of Public Lighting Systems \n\n4. \n\n3. \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n7. \nEconomic  assessment  of  a  demand-side  management  program  can  look  at  different \nperspectives of the parties involved, e.g., utility, customers, regulator, and society. For society, \nthe  total  resource  cost  (also  known  as  economic  efficiency)  approach  is  used.  This  measures \nnet  costs  of  a  demand-side  management  program  based  on  the  total  cost  of  the  program \nincluding  both  participant  and  utility  costs,  and  compares  these  costs  with  the  total  benefits, \nsuch  as  avoided  supply  costs,  avoided  participant  costs,  and  societal  benefits  such  as \nenvironmental externalities.1  \n \n8. \nAccording  to  the  stated  approach,  the  value  of  reduced  electricity  consumption  (or \nsavings) due to the use of more efficient lighting systems (CFL, efficient ballast) is equivalent to \nthe avoided supply costs. Since savings occur at the end user level, the avoided supply should \nbe evaluated by looking at the mix of generation source in the Philippines. A data collection of \ngeneration charge for 14 power companies in three regions\u2014Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao\u2014\nreveals that the generation charge ranges between P2.37 per kWh and P7.06 per kWh, with an \naverage  of  P3.7  per  kWh.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  and  net  present  value \ncalculations are based on the average nationwide cost. \n \n9. \nAs  savings  are  made  by  existing  consumers,  they  will  not  affect  the  transmission  and \ndistribution  systems.  The  avoided  supply  costs  therefore  consist  of  avoided  generation  costs \nand avoided system losses. The resulting value of kWh electricity saved for the Manila Electric \nCompany (Meralco) is P5.68.2 \n \n10. \nApart  from  the  benefits  accrued  by  society  by  way  of  avoided  generation  costs,  the \nProject  is  credited  with  environmental  benefits.  As  electricity  consumption  in  the  with-project \nscenario  compared  with  the  without-project  scenario  would  be  lower  by  534  GWh  every  year, \nemissions  from  power  generation  would  also  be  reduced.  The  environmental  benefits  include \nless air pollution causing local impacts such as sulfur dioxides, nitrogen oxides, and particulate \nmatters.  But  most  important  is  the  reduction  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  emissions.  With  the \naverage  CO2  emission  factor  of the  Philippines  power  system  estimated  at  0.54  kilogram  CO2 \nper  kWh,3 the  annual  electricity  savings  of  534  GWh  is  accompanied  with  reduction  of  about \n300,000 tons of CO2 per year.  \n \n11. \nThe  internal  rate  of  return  and  net  present  value  of  this  investment  are  obtained  by \ncomparing  the  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  against  its  costs  (Table  A12).  The  average \neconomic internal rate of return of the Project is high at 99 %, with investment recovered early \nduring  project  implementation.  This is  due  to  the  very  high  electricity  savings  from  a  relatively \ninexpensive CFL program. The Project earns a net present value of $106 million after 5 years of \noperation. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1   See  for  example:  US  Congress,  Office  of  Technology  Assessment.  1993.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n\n \nThe  Family  Income  and  Expenditure  Survey  of  1997  showed  that  poverty  incidence  declined  from  49.3%  of  the  total \npopulation  in  1985  to  40.6%  in  1994  and  36.8%  in  1997.  Between  1994  and  1997,  urban  poverty  incidence  in  the  total \npopulation declined from 28% to 21.5%, while rural poverty incidence fell only from 53.1% to 50.7%; thus, more than half of \nthe rural population is still poverty stricken.  \n \nThe lowest incidence of poverty is in the National Capital Region and surrounding areas; while the highest, exceeding 50%, is \nin  the  Autonomous  Region  for  Muslim  Mindanao,  the  central  and  northern  regions  of  Mindanao,  and  the  Bicol  region.  The \npoor tend to be self-employed in agriculture and related activities in rural areas, and casual laborers of all types in urban and \nrural  areas.  The  link  between  rural  and  urban  poverty  is  strong  as  the  urban  poor  are  mainly  rural  migrants.  The \nGovernment\u2019s Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan 1999\u20132004 emphasizes poverty reduction through measures such \nas  promotion  of  equitable  growth,  rural  development,  and  increased  social  sector  investments.  In  1998,  the  Government \nestablished the National Anti-Poverty Commission and the Presidential Commission for the Urban Poor. A poverty reduction \ntarget envisaging a reduction in the incidence of poor families from 32% in 1997 to 25%\u201328% by 2004 was projected in the \nMedium-Term Philippine Development Plan.  \n \nAccording  to  the  2003  Family  Income  and  Expenditure  Survey,  the  country  had  16  million  families,  with  an  average  of  five \nmembers, and an average annual income of P148,757 (increase of only 2.5% in nominal terms from 2000 or income declined \nin real terms by 10%), 84% of family income went to expenditures, and average annual saving of families was about P20,615. \n \nThe  Philippines  is  suffering  from  a  deteriorating  infrastructure  sector.  Although  electrification  rates  are  higher  than  in  many \ncountries  in  the  region,  a  large  proportion  of  the  population  still  does  not  have  access  to  electricity.  For  those  who  have \naccess,  the  high  price  of  electricity  discourages  its  use.  Poor  consumers  using  electricity  for  lighting  use  one  of  the  most \ninefficient forms of lighting\u2014the incandescent bulb that uses 80% of its energy input to produce heat and 20% for lighting.  \n \nRecently, with the increase of international oil prices, poor consumers are increasingly burdened with the growing expense of \nmeeting  their  energy  needs.  In  this  context,  the  Government  organized  the  Philippine  Energy  Summit  in  February  2008  to \ndiscuss options for mitigating the impact of high energy prices on the general public and decided to promote energy efficiency \nto help residential customers with their growing energy cost.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nIn  the  Philippines,  a  typical  lifeline  customer  uses  about  100  kilowatt-hours  (kWh)  of  electricity  per  month.  Many  of  the \ncustomers  use  at  least  two  40-watt  incandescent  bulbs.  One  of  the  objectives  of  the  Project  is  to  replace  these  two \nincandescent bulbs with compact fluorescent lamps (CFL), collect the working incandescent bulbs, gather them as evidence \nof a government-led program, and claim Clean Development Mechanism credits. The electricity consumption for lighting will \nbe reduced by 80% for these customers when they switch to energy-efficient CFLs. Overall, this initiative will distribute about \n13  million  CFLs,  free  of  charge,  to  residential  and  other  customers  of  four  private  utilities  and  108  electric  cooperatives \nnationwide. This will prepare these customers to more easily adjust to the Government\u2019s proposal to phase out incandescent \nbulbs by 2010. \n \nCustomers in some off-grid areas will be provided with light-emitting diode (LED) lights under a pilot program to evaluate the \nuse of LED lights in place of kerosene, candles, and other nonelectric alternatives. LED is a third-generation lighting system; a \ntypical 9-watt LED light can produce as much light as a 13-watt CFL or a 60-watt incandescent bulb. Good quality LEDs can \noperate  between  10,000  and  50,000  hours  compared  with  8,000  hours  for  a  typical  CFL  or  800  hours  for  an  ordinary \nincandescent bulb. \n \nThis initiative will increase the environment's carrying capacity to support the country's sustained economic growth, reducing \npoverty  in  the  process.  The  Philippine  Energy  Efficiency  Project  will  distribute  good  quality  and  reliable  power  to  existing \nconsumers with lower losses. An objective of the Project is to promote energy-efficient bulbs.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 13     57      \n\n \nThe  Project\u2019s  objective  in  terms  of  contribution  to  the  sector  to  reduce  poverty  was  assessed.  The  Project  will  not  have \nsignificant  direct  impacts  on  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  as  it  will  not  support  new  connections.  The  Project\u2019s \ncontribution in the energy sector will be mainly on energy saving during peak hours. The loss reduction and energy savings \nwill reduce the cost of power generation. Under the demand-side management program, the promotion of CFL lamps through \nbulk purchase and free distribution will help to expand the CFL market and increase revenue for small distributors and small \nretailers in the long term.       \n \nMost of the users of CFL lamps are from higher- and middle-income groups as the cost of a good quality CFL bulb is high. \nHowever,  in  recent  years,  more  poor  households  have  been  using  CFL  lamps,  although  they  are  limited  by  the  cost.  Poor \nhouseholds  use  both  CFLs  and  incandescent  lamps,  and  balance  spending  on  light  bulbs  with  energy  consumption.  The \nincandescent  lamp  is  much  cheaper  but  consumes  more  energy.  The  longevity  of  incandescent  lamp  is  very  low  in \ncomparison to a CFL. The CFL lamp lasts 5 times longer than an incandescent lamp. Although the incandescent bulb needs \nto be replaced quite often, poor people prefer to buy them because of their low price. Since no form of certification exists for \nefficiency claims, rural households often become victims of fraud. Most poor people use 5-watt incandescent bulbs, which in \nreality are 20 watts with poor efficiency. Low-quality CFL lamps are also prevalent in the market and targeted to low-income \nand poor households that would be reluctant to buy high-quality and higher priced lamps.  \n \nThe  main  beneficiary  of  the  Project  will  be  rural  households,  specifically  households  on  lifeline  tariffs,  consuming  less  than \n100  kWh  a  month.  The  same  households  will  also  learn  about  other  affordable  energy-efficient  choices  for  reducing \nhousehold expenditures on energy from the communication and social mobilization component. Remote rural households that \ndepend  on  kerosene-based  lighting  will  have  the  opportunity  to  test  LED-based  lighting.  The  public  lighting  component  will \nincrease mobility of these households by increasing net light output in rural areas using less energy overall. \n \n2.  Design  Features.  Households  will  save  up  to  80%  of  their  electricity  cost  on  lighting.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  allow \nabout  3.7  million  households  to  switch  to  CFLs  without  incurring  any  additional  cost\u2014about  P200  by  2010  when  the \nGovernment\u2019s proposed phaseout of incandescent bulbs will be implemented. \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nCFLs will be distributed to more than 5 million households by 108 electric cooperatives and 4 private distribution utilities. The \naverage  consumption  of  many  of  these  households  is  below  the  100  kWh  per  month  threshold  for  lifeline  customers.  For \nexample, a lifeline customer qualifying for a lifeline tariff receives a bill of P360 for consumption of 40 kWh in a month; with the \naverage discount of about 40% for a lifeline customer, the customer will be required to pay about P220.  \n \nIf the electricity consumed by lighting in that household is P200, use of two CFLs will reduce the consumption by more than \nP100  each  month.  Distribution  of  high-quality  CFL  lamps  to  poor  households  to  replace  incandescent  lamps  would  benefit \npoor  customers  in  lower  electricity  bill,  and  improved  lighting  in  their  houses.  This  is  especially  important  for  children  since \nreading  and  doing  homework  with  low  lighting  can  cause  eyestrain  and  lead  to  poor  eyesight.  Reliable  and  improved \nhousehold lighting would have a positive impact on the household\u2019s economic and social activities in the evening. The savings \nin energy bills might have an impact on the households\u2019 expenditure or savings.  \n \nThe  social  marketing  and  community  awareness  of  the  energy-efficiency  program  will  be  used  to  develop  customer\u2019s \nconfidence  in  using  CFLs  through  nongovernment  organizations,  social  organizations,  television,  and  radio.  The  impact  of \npromotion of CFLs depends on affordability and effective distribution channels. \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\nThe 108  electric cooperatives were consulted on the distribution model for CFLs. Management of the cooperatives gave their \nassurance  that  they  will  work  closely  with  local  social  organizations  and  the  National  Electrification  Administration  to  make \ndistribution as effective as possible.  \n \n    \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n Yes    \n\n No     C&P will be prepared during implementation. \n\n \n3.

Social mobilization, consultation, and participation will specifically target women and children. In many cases, \npurchase  decisions  at  the  household  are  made  by  women.  Children  will  be  made  aware  of  energy-efficient  lighting  through \nbrochures and other promotional materials distributed at schools. \n \n2.  Key  Actions.

This  will  contribute  to  greenhouse  gas \nreduction.  Carbon  credits  will  be  sought  following  the  methodology  approved  by  the  executive \nboard  of  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism.  The  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  will  be  the \nExecuting Agency. The proposed Project will be implemented over 2 years from April 2009. \n \n2. \nThe  Project  will  (i)  retrofit  about  40  government-owned  office  buildings  with  efficient \nlighting;  (ii)  procure  13  million  compact  fluorescent  lamps  (CFLs)  for  distribution  to  residential \nand  other  customers  to  reduce  peak  power  demand;  (iii)  introduce  energy-efficient  lamps  for \npublic lighting; (iv) set up a laboratory for testing energy-efficient appliances and a lamp waste \nmanagement facility; (v) establish a super energy service company (ESCO)  to support ESCO \ndevelopment;  (vi)  promote  an  efficient-building  initiative;  and  (vii)  develop  and  implement  a \ncommunication and social mobilization program.  \n \n3. \nADB  classifies  the  Project  as  environmental  category  B.  An  initial  environmental \nexamination was prepared consistent with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and Environmental \nAssessment  Guidelines  (2003).  This  summary  IEE  examination  focuses  on  the  proposed  pilot \nlamp waste management facility and includes descriptions of existing environmental conditions, \nthe  Project,  assessment  of  environmental  impacts,  recommended  mitigation  measures, \nenvironmental monitoring, and public consultation.  \n \nA. \n\nProject Description \n\n4. \nUse  of  energy-efficient  fluorescent  lamps  will  increase  significantly,  especially  in  the \nPhilippines.  Since  a  CFL  contains  2\u20135  milligrams  (mg)  of  mercury  and  a  typical  linear \nfluorescent  tube  lamp  (FTL)  used  commonly  in  offices  and  houses  contains  about  12  mg  of \nmercury, safe disposal of spent lamps is a critical issue from a public health and environmental \nperspective. Mercury is known for its high toxicity and its significant adverse impacts on human \nhealth  are  well  documented.  As  in  many  developing  countries,  locals  dispose  of  FTLs  in \nlandfills,  ultimately  polluting  groundwater.  The  implementation  of  the  pilot  lamp  waste \nmanagement  facility  will  address  the  health  and  environmental  issues  through  proper \nawareness, and collection. This will give customers a choice for recycling of mercury in lamps.  \n \nThe  lamp  waste  management  facility  subcomponent  will  include  the  collection  of  spent \n5. \nlamps from households, institutions, and business establishments. The pilot facility will have a \ncapacity  of  processing  6  million  lamps  per  year.  For  every  1  million  lamps,  approximately \n900,000 intact glass tubes, 2.2 tons of aluminum, 120 kilograms (kg) of tin, 944 kg of copper, \n360  kg  of  chloride  salts,  and  10  kg  of  mercury  will  be  recovered.  Practically  all  of  the \ncomponents of the spent lamps will be recycled into reusable raw materials. \n \n6. \nIt will consist of a compact crush and separation plant built into a 20-foot container and a \nmaximum  capacity  of  about  300  kg  of  tube  material  per  hour,  equal  to  approximately  2,000 \ntubes per hour. The compact crush and separation plant is designed for processing fluorescent \ntubes  of  various  length  and  shapes.  The  machine  crushes  and  separates  the  material  into  a \nglass fraction, a metal end (end cap) fraction, and a fluorescent powder fraction.  \n \n7. \nThe  facility  will  be  located  in  one  of  the  existing  warehouses  of  DoloMatrix  Philippines \nwithin the Angeles Industrial Park in Calibutbut, Bacolor, Pampanga. The warehouse has a total \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\narea of 2,520 square meters. The room will be ventilated by fresh air\u2014at least three exchanges \nper  hour.  The  compact  crush  and  separation  plant  generates  negligible  amounts  of  mercury \nconcentration in the room during operation. The maximum concentration of mercury emission in \nthe  atmosphere  (inside  the  room)  during  processing  is  0.025  milligrams/cubic  meter  (mg/m3). \nThe permissible limit set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration1 is 0.05 mg/m3. \nThe process air will be discharged through two series of connected carbon filters. \n \n8. \nRecycled  materials  will  be  sold  as  raw  materials  to  various  establishments.  Transport, \nstorage,  handling,  and  packaging  of  recycled  materials,  mercury  in  particular,  will  be  in \naccordance with the requirements of the Republic Act 6969 (an act to control toxic substances \nand hazardous and nuclear wastes) and the requirements of the occupational safety and health \ncenter of the Department of Labor and Employment.  \n \nB. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n9. \nThe  facility  will  be  installed  in  an  existing  warehouse  surrounded  by  other  warehouses \nwithin  the  industrial  park.  The  project  area  and  its  immediate  vicinity  are  devoid  of  vegetation \nand  wildlife.  The  nearest  residential  area  is  about  500  meters  away  from  the  project  site.  The \nindustrial park is being serviced by the Angeles Electric Power and Theresa Water Works. \n \nC. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n5. \nNo  environmental  impact  is  anticipated  during  construction  since  as  equipment  will  be \ninstalled within an existing warehouse. During operation, mercury concentration in the work area \nwill  dependent  on  the  manner  in  which  materials  for  recycling  are  handled  and  how \nmaintenance work on the equipment is executed. Most equipment generates negligible amounts \nof  mercury  concentration  in  the  room  during  operation.  The  process  air  will  be  discharged \nthrough  two  series  of  carbon  filters.  Filters  will  be  subjected  to  retorting 2  or  treated  using \ndolocrete technology.3 The materials to be processed should be dry, clean, and stored indoors \nprior to the process. The equipment instructions for plant operation must always be followed. \n \n6. \nNo  significant  volume  of  wastewater  will  be  generated  since  the  retorting  process  is \nsomewhat  similar  to  distillation  processes  where  water  is  only  used  for  cooling.  Cooling  water \nwill be recycled back into the process. \n \n7. \nApplicable  provisions  of  the  Republic  Act  6969  and  requirements  of  the  occupational \nhealth and safety center will be implemented. Appropriate protective equipment will be provided \nfor  personnel  and  good  housekeeping  will  be  observed  through  implementation  of  the  5S \nmethodology.4 Only  trained  staff  will  be  allowed  to  operate  the  equipment.  The  operator  will \nensure annual medical checkups of staff as well as testing for blood mercury levels.  \n \nD. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n\n8. \nFor  the  lamp  waste  management  component,  a  working  group  will  be  established \ncomprising DOE (chair) and a representative from key stakeholders such as the Environmental \n\n                                                 \n1   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration is an agency of the United States Department of Labor. \n2   Retorting  is  a  process  which  makes  use  of  an  airtight  vessel  in  which  substances  are  heated  for  a  chemical \n\nreaction to produce gaseous products that can be collected for other uses or for further processing. \n\n3   Dolocrete  technology  is  an  innovative  waste  treatment  technology  that  binds  toxic  and  hazardous  wastes  into  a \npseudomineral matrix, which stabilizes the contaminant species and prevents its release into the environment.  \n\n4   5S is a methodology for efficiently organizing and managing the work space and work flow.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n                                                                                                     Appendix 14 \n\n61 \n\nManagement  Board,  Department  of  Environment  and  Natural  Resources,  local  government \nunits, nongovernment organizations, private sector, and waste management operators. DOE, as \nthe  interim  owner  of  the  lamp  waste  management  facility,  will  obtain  the  necessary \nenvironmental  permits  and  clearances  from  the  Department  of  Environment  and  Natural \nResources  and  the  Environmental  Management  Board  prior  to  project  implementation.  The \nPMU  will  conduct  semiannual  monitoring  of  the  operator\u2019s  implementation  of  mitigation \nmeasures. \n \nA  consultant  expert  in  lamp  waste  management,  energy-efficiency  standards,  and \n9. \nlabeling will assist DOE in preparing specifications, and prequalification and tender documents. \nThe bidding documents will specify, among others, that the lamp waste management facility will \nmeet the highest international technical and environmental standards. \n \n10. \nThe  pilot  facility  will  be  implemented  under  a  turnkey  arrangement  including  supply, \nshipping, installation, commissioning, operator training, and regular maintenance. The supplier \nof the facility will operate the lamp waste management facility for 2 years under DOE direction. \nThe  operator,  under  the  supervision  of  DOE,  will  conduct  indoor  air  quality  monitoring  and \nanalytical testing of the glass and aluminum end caps to ensure that mercury levels are within \napplicable standards. The cost for environmental monitoring during operation is included in the \nproject budget. \n \nE. \n\nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure \n\n11. \nA  public  consultation,  involving  20  representatives  of  the  local  government  unit, \nnongovernment  organization,  DoloMatrix  Philippines,  Philippine  Economic  Zone  Authority,  and \nDOE,  was  conducted  on  3  July  2008  at  the  Angeles  Industrial  Park.  Details  of  the  pilot  lamp \nwaste  management  facility,  its  potential  impacts  and  mitigation  measures  were  presented  by \nDOE. The participants raised issues related to the safety and health of the community, and the \nenvironmental  compliance  and  safety  aspects  of  the  equipment.  DOE  and  DoloMatrix \nPhilippines addressed these issues and elaborated on equipment specifications and procedures \nor systems to be implemented during its operation.  \n \nF. \n\nConclusions \n\n17. \nThe  Project  will  result  in  reduced  costs  for  energy  production.  With  reduced  electricity \ndemand,  the  overall  need  for  supply  (generation)  will  be  reduced  and  a  large  amount  of \ngreenhouse gas emissions\u2014and the associated cost of importing fuel\u2014will be avoided, creating \ncarbon credits for the Project under the Clean Development Mechanism. \n \n18. \nThe lamp waste management facility subcomponent, in particular, will enable consumers \nto dispose of FTLs without damaging the environment. The disposal of spent CFLs and FTLs in \nlandfills  is  among  the  primary  sources  of  mercury  pollution  that  could  migrate  to  groundwater \nand could become airborne. Recovered materials through the recycling facility will also reduce \nthe need for the production of raw materials.  \n \n19. \nThe predicted environmental impacts of the lamp waste management facility have been \nidentified  and  appropriate  mitigation  measures  are  included  in  this  initial  environmental \nexamination. Responsibilities for implementation and monitoring of mitigation measures and the \nmonitoring  plan  are  defined  clearly.  The  need  for  further  environmental  study  is  deemed  not \nnecessary. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 9 December 2008) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "peso (P) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "P1.00\n$1.00\n", "$0.0206 \nP48.607 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \nClean Development Mechanism \ncertified emissions reduction \ncompact fluorescent lamp \ncarbon dioxide \nDepartment of Energy \neconomic internal rate of return \nEnergy Regulatory Commission  \nenergy service company \nfinancial internal rate of return \nfluorescent tube lamp \ninternational competitive bidding \nindependent power producer  \nlight-emitting diode \nLondon interbank offered rate \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Manila Electric Company \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "national competitive bidding \nNational Electrification Administration \nNational Power Corporation  \nproject management unit \nPhilippine National Oil Company \nquality- and cost-based selection \nNational Transmission Corporation  \nwholesale electricity spot market \n", " \nWEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n", "ADB \nCDM \nCER \nCFL \nCO2 \nDOE \nEIRR \nERC  \nESCO \nFIRR \nFTL \nICB \nIPP  \nLED \nLIBOR \nMeralco \nNCB \nNEA \nNPC  \nPMU \nPNOC \nQCBS \nTransCo  \nWESM  \n", "GWh (gigawatt-hour) \nkg (kilogram) \nkWh (kilowatt-hour) \nm3 (cubic meter) \nmg (milligram) \nmm (millimeter) \nMW (megawatt) \nMWh (megawatt-hour) \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "1,000 megawatt-hours \n1,000 grams \n1,000 watt-hours \n1,000 liters \n0.001 gram \n0.001 meter \n1,000 kilowatts \n1,000 kilowatt-hours \n", "NOTES \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December.  \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \n", "C.
