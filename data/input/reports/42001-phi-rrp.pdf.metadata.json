The environmental implications were reviewed and \nAssessment  no significant adverse impacts were identified.  \n   \nProject Description  The  Project  will  (i)  retrofit  about  40  government-owned  office \nbuildings  with  efficient  lighting;  (ii)  procure  13  million  compact \nfluorescent lamps (CFLs) for distribution to residential and other \ncustomers to reduce peak power demand; (iii) introduce energy-\nefficient lamps for public lighting; (iv) set up a laboratory for testing \nenergy-efficient  appliances  and  a  lamp  waste  management \nfacility; (v) establish a super energy service company (ESCO)  to \nsupport  ESCO  development;  (vi)  promote  an  efficient-building \ninitiative; and (vii) develop and implement a communication and \nsocial mobilization program. \n   \nRationale  Philippine  consumers  spend  a  large  part  of  their  household \nincome on energy; the country\u2019s electricity tariffs are among the \nhighest in the region. This situation has become even worse with \nrecent oil price increases and is likely to continue in the short to \nmedium term as the Government cannot influence high oil prices. \nThe introduction of competition through open access and targeting \nexisting subsidies can only reduce electricity tariffs in the medium \nto long term. The Government is focusing on increasing the use of \nindigenous  renewable  energy  generation  (such  as  geothermal, \nbiomass, wind, and hydropower) and promoting energy efficiency \nto meet these challenges.  \n \nThe  Government  recognizes  that  it  alone  cannot  identify  and \nfinance the various energy-efficiency initiatives. Studies carried \nout by the Department of Energy (DOE) with assistance from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) demonstrate that by investing \n$46.5 million in energy efficiency, the Government could defer \n$450 million of investments in new power plants, and save about \n$100 million annually in fuel cost.   \n \n ", "ii \n  The Project\u2019s purpose is to reduce the peak load power demand \nby  implementing  an  energy-efficiency  program,  with  particular \nfocus on efficient lighting that will contribute to greenhouse gas \nreduction. Carbon credits will be sought following the methodology \napproved  by  the  executive  board  of  the  Clean  Development \nMechanism.  The  Project  is  economically  and  financially  sound \nwith an economic internal rate of return of 99% and a financial \ninternal  rate  of  return  of  206%  compared  with  the  weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital  of  2.4%.  For  the  CFL  distribution \ncomponent, the payback period is less than 1 year, making the \ninvestment cash flow positive in the first year. The economic and \nfinancial internal rates of return calculations do not include the \nvalue of Clean Development Mechanism credits generated by the \nProject. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The final impact of the Project will be reduced cost of energy \nproduction. As electricity cannot be stored, its supply and demand \nhas to be met instantaneously. During peak times, the marginal \ncost of generation is usually about 5\u201310 times more than the \naverage cost of generation. Therefore when the peak demand is \nreduced by using efficient lighting, the average cost of generation \nis reduced.  \n \nConsumers\u2019 energy costs will be reduced with the use of efficient \nlighting.  With  reduced  electricity  demand,  the  overall  need  for \nsupply  (generation)  will  be  reduced.  Also,  a  large  amount  of \ngreenhouse gas emissions\u2014and the associated cost of importing \nfuel\u2014will be avoided, creating carbon credits for the Project under \nthe CDM. The Project will establish sustainable business models \nfor large-scale implementation of energy-efficiency programs. It \nwill  reduce  public  sector  and  local  government  energy \nexpenditure, reduce health risks associated with residual mercury \nand  kerosene  (in  off-grid  areas),  enhance  livelihoods  of  rural \ncommunities, facilitate a viable ESCO industry, and establish a \ncertification  process  for  energy  and  environmentally  efficient \ncommercial buildings. \n    \nProject Investment Plan   The  estimated  cost  of  the  Project  is  $46.5  million,  including \nphysical  and  price  contingencies,  interest  and  other  charges \nduring implementation, and taxes and duties of $2.4 million. \n   ", "iii \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $31,100,000 from the ordinary capital resources of ADB \nwill  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \nThe Asian Clean Energy Fund (established by the Government of \nJapan) will provide a grant of $1.5 million equivalent under the \nClean Energy Financing Partnership Facility. ADB will administer \nthe grant. The Government will provide financing of $13.9 million. \n \nAllocation and Relending  Under a subsidiary loan agreement that will be on terms and \nTerms  conditions  satisfactory  to  ADB,  the  Government  will  relend \n$7.5 million equivalent to the super ESCO that will be established \nas  a  subsidiary  corporation  of  the  Philippine  National  Oil \nCompany. The super ESCO will bear the foreign exchange risk for \nthis subsidiary loan agreement. \n \nRetroactive Financing  Retroactive financing is proposed for an initial supply of CFLs that \nwill be ordered between 1 August 2008 and loan effectiveness, \nwith a ceiling of up to $3.1 million (10% of the loan amount), in \naccordance with Innovation and Efficiency Initiative: Cost Sharing \nand  Eligibility  of  Expenditures  for  Asian  Development  Bank \nFinancing\u2014A New Approach (2005). The Government and the \nImplementing  Agency  were  advised  that  approval  of  advance \naction or retroactive financing does not commit ADB to financing \nthe Project.  \n \nPeriod of Utilization  Until October 2011 \n   \nEstimated Project  April 2011  \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Department of Energy \n   \n ", "iv \nImplementation  DOE  will  be  responsible  for  overall  technical  supervision  and \nArrangements  execution  of  the  Project.  DOE  will  also  be  the  Implementing \nAgency for the following subcomponents: (i) retrofit of government \noffice buildings, (ii) testing laboratory and lamp waste recovery \nplant,  (iii)  efficient-building  initiative,  and  (iv)  public  lighting \nretrofits. The other implanting agencies are (i) the super ESCO for \nthe  ESCO  component;  and  (ii)  the  National  Electrification \nAdministration  for  the  components  involving  electric \ncooperatives\u2014national residential lighting initiative except in the \nfranchise areas of the private utilities. As the Executing Agency, \nDOE  will  establish  a  project  management  unit,  headed  by  a \ndirector and appropriately staffed for day-to-day coordination. The \nunit  director  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  supporting \nimplementation  and  providing  guidance,  administrative  and \ntechnical  support,  counterpart  staff,  documentation,  and  other \nservices that may be required. \n \nProcurement  All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan and the Asian \nClean  Energy  Fund  grant  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing \nPartnership Facility will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time), \nand  the  procurement  plan  prepared  and  agreed  between  the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  All  procurement  contracts  will  contain \nanticorruption provisions as specified by ADB.  \n \nAdvance action will allow DOE to initiate its communication plan \nand  the  first  stage  of  CFL  distribution.  The  Government  was \nadvised that approval of advance action does not commit ADB to \nfinancing the Project. \n   \nConsulting Services  Consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \nThey  will  provide  support  for  project  implementation.  Advance \ncontracting will be applied for consulting services. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The direct economic benefits of the Project include reduced peak \nBeneficiaries  demand and overall reduction of imported oil for power generation \nby  use  of  energy-efficient  lighting  devices.  This  will  result  in \nsavings of about $100 million per annum from avoided fuel cost \nand deferral of an investment of $450 million in power generation \nand  associated  network  capacity  of  450  megawatts,  which  is \nabout  3%  of  the  Philippines\u2019  total  generation  capacity.  Poor \ncustomers  will  particularly  benefit,  as  lighting  is  a  significant \ncomponent of their electricity consumption. These households will \nbenefit from improved quality lighting.  \n   ", "v \nRisks and Assumptions  The CFL distribution component has some risks: (i) the efficient \nand timely procurement of CFLs and their distribution without any \nleakage  to  the  commercial  market;  and  (ii)  the  Government\u2019s \nability  to  implement  and  enforce  strict  controls  on  energy-\nefficiency labeling and testing of CFLs. These risks are mitigated \nby ensuring that (i) distribution of CFLs to customers is done at \nthe  payment  points  of  the  electric  cooperatives  and  private \ndistribution utilities, (ii) each CFL is marked \u201cnot for sale,\u201d and \n(iii) suppliers deliver the CFLs directly to the distribution points.  \n \nEach customer will receive a coupon with their electricity bill and \nbe  made  aware  of  the  free  distribution  via  mass  media \ncommunication. Appropriate monitoring mechanisms for effective \ndistribution  and  reporting  of  the  CFL  component  will  be \ndeveloped. All electric cooperatives participated in developing the \nproposed  distribution  mechanism.  The  mechanism  will  be \noptimized during implementation of the first phase. Lessons from \nthe distribution of the first lot will be incorporated in the distribution \nof subsequent lots. \n \n  The  Project\u2019s  ability  to  create  enough  competition  among  the \nmajor lighting manufacturers is not considered a significant risk. \nAbout 3 to 5 million units will be procured in each of the three lots \nto ensure strong competition and to discourage market dominance \nby any single brand.  \n \nEstablishment  of  a  super  ESCO  has  some  risks.  The  risks \nassociated in opening up the public sectors\u2014hospitals, schools, \nand office buildings\u2014to private suppliers may (i) take longer than \nplanned  during  design;  (ii)  meet  unforeseen  legal  barriers; \n(iii) need  much  more  incentives  and  encouragement  for  public \nsector  managers  to  participate  in  the  process;  and  (iv)  be \ndominated by several existing suppliers, thus inhibiting the growth \nof the market. DOE will address all these risks in the detailed \nbusiness plan. \n \nThe super ESCO will face some risks in developing the ESCO \nmarket for industry and commercials sectors, for example: (i) an \ninsufficient number of ESCOs are interested in the super ESCO\u2019s \noffers (financing and capacity building), (ii) end consumers do not \ntrust  a  government-supported  ESCO  on  grounds  of  perceived \nbureaucracy,  (iii)  not  enough  competent  staff  are  available  to \nimplement  the  super  ESCO  business  plan,  (iv)  legal  and \nprocedural complications slow needed quick disbursement, and \n(v) the ESCOs are not able to design benefit-sharing contracts \nthat will encourage all parties\u2014the super ESCO, private ESCOs, \nand  end  users\u2014to  continue  energy-efficiency  related  activities \nand make it a sustainable program. \n \n \n \n ", "119 o 00'E 125 o 00'E\nBabuyan  Channel\n122o  00'E PHILIPPINES\n21o  00'N 21o  00'N PHILIPPINE ENERGY\nItbayat EFFICIENCY PROJECT\nILOCOS NORTE\nBATANES\nBasco Laoag APAKYaAbOugao\nSabtang CAGAYAN\n122o  00'E REIlGocIOosN I Bangued KALINGA Tuguegarao REGION II\nABRA CAR Cagayan Valley\nTabuk N\nILOCOS SUR\nVigan BontoMcT.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan to the Republic of the Philippines; and (ii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided \nby the Asian Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility  for the \nPhilippine Energy Efficiency Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.    Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Macroeconomic Performance \n2.  Gross domestic product growth improved gradually from 4.4% in 2002 to 7.2% in 2007\u2014\nthe highest growth in 3 decades. This growth was fueled largely by consumer spending (about \n70%) and partly by public sector expenditures on current and capital outlays. Implementation of \nfiscal reforms in 2004\u20132006 coupled with receipts from privatization permitted the Government \nto increase expenditures, estimated at 17% of gross domestic product in 2007. However, growth \nslowed to 4.6% during the first quarter of 2008. This is largely due to rising commodity prices; \nincrease in international oil prices; and a slowdown in global growth, which will impact exports. \nOverall economic growth for 2008 is likely to be around 4.5%. In March 2008, the Philippine \nDevelopment Forum emphasized the importance of physical infrastructure in increasing regional \ncompetitiveness and market access, attracting investments needed to sustain economic growth, \nand reducing poverty. In this regard, the Government\u2019s 2009 budget proposal calls for continued \nfiscal consolidation and priority for key physical infrastructure projects. The 2005\u20132007 country \nstrategy and program of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) emphasizes support for removing \ninfrastructure bottlenecks in power, transport, and agriculture to increase the competitiveness of \nprivate sector-led manufacturing and service sectors.1 \n \n2.  Energy Sector Performance \n3.  The  National  Power  Corporation  (NPC),  a  vertically  integrated  utility,  had  primary \nresponsibility for power generation and transmission in the Philippines until the power subsector \nwas restructured in February 2002. Prior to the restructuring, NPC and several independent \npower producers shared electricity-generating functions in the country. Privately owned Manila \nElectric Company (Meralco), 16 privately owned utilities, 7 municipal systems, and 119 rural \nelectric cooperatives distributed electricity across the country. The power supply system in the \nPhilippines is divided into three grids\u2014Luzon, Mindanao and Visayas. The Luzon grid covers \nMetro Manila and accounts for about 70% of total power demand in the country; the Mindanao \ngrid is the second largest. The National Electrification Administration (NEA) is responsible for \nrural  electrification.  It  manages  electrification  targets  and  maintains  the  operation  of  rural \nnetworks through the electric cooperatives.  \n \n4.  Burdened with excessive debt, lack of competition, and stranded generation capacity \nwith expensive take-or-pay contracts, the Government decided to restructure and privatize the \npower industry. In 1998, ADB supported the Government\u2019s initiative through the Power Sector \nRestructuring Program2 with financing of $300 million. The program\u2019s principal objective was to \ncreate competitive electricity markets by unbundling generation and transmission, and providing \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

", "2 \nopen and equal access to transmission and distribution. By March 2003, NPC\u2019s assets were \norganized into two state-holding companies: (i) National Transmission Corporation, which took \non much of the company\u2019s transmission assets; and (ii) Power Sector Assets and Liabilities \nManagement Corporation, which assumed control of the power-generating assets. \n \n5.  The Electric Power Industry Reform Act, passed by Congress in 2001, was the blueprint \nfor  the  2002  restructuring.  The  act  required  the  breakup  of  NPC\u2019s  integrated  assets  into \nseparate units for electricity generation and transmission. By March 2008, the Government had \nfinalized a 25-year concession to operate the national power grid, and the Power Sector Assets \nand  Liabilities  Management  Corporation  had  formally  approved  the  sale  of  more  than  \n1,855 megawatts (MW) or 44% of NPC\u2019s generation assets in support of the Government's \nrevised target of 70% privatization before the end of 2008. In 2001, the Government established \nan  independent  regulator,  the  Energy  Regulatory  Commission  to  oversee  competition  and \nmonopoly regulation of the sector. Detailed analysis of the power subsector is in Appendix 2. \n \n6.  Total energy demand is projected to double by 2030 (from 2007), growing at about 4% \nper annum. Electricity demand growth3 will be similar. Growth will be strongest in the residential \nsector (at 6.5% annually), as compared to the commercial (5.7%) and industry sectors (4.7%). If \nthe status quo continues, most of this demand growth will have to be met by imported oil and \ncoal. Both coal and oil consumption grew by 10% between 2006 and 2007. Coal will continue to \nbe the dominant4 fuel for electricity generation and will account for 54% of electricity generation \nby 2030. The transport sector\u2019s demand is currently exclusively met by oil and will account for \nabout 44% of total final energy demand by 2030. \n \n7.  The total installed power-generating capacity in the Philippines was 15,937 MW in 2007, \ngenerating  about  59,600  gigawatt-hours,  a  20%  increase  since  2001.  Natural  gas  (32%), \ngeothermal  energy  (17%),  and  hydropower  (14%)  are  the  main  domestic  primary  energy \nsources used for generation. Oil-based and coal-fired generation contribute the remaining 37%. \nThe electricity tariffs in the Philippines are among the highest in the region5 and, as a result, \nconsumers spend a large part of their household income on energy. Recent oil price increases \nhave exacerbated the situation, especially for poor consumers in rural areas. Global energy \nprices will continue to be high in the short to medium term.  \n \n8.  In  response  to  these  challenges,  the  Government  organized  the  Philippine  Energy \nSummit in February 2008 to discuss options for mitigating the impact of high energy prices on \nthe general public. The summit concluded that while the introduction of competition through \nopen access6 and better targeting of existing subsidies could reduce electricity tariffs in the \nmedium term, a more effective solution would be a combination of increased use of indigenous \nrenewable  energy  generation  (such  as  geothermal,  biomass,  wind,  and  hydropower)  and \npromotion  of  energy  efficiency  because  of  its  quick  implementation  ability.  The  summit \nparticipants agreed to pursue energy efficiency as the short-term strategy to combat the impact \n                                                 \n3  Projections of energy demand and electricity consumption are taken from various reports published by the \nPhilippine Department of Energy and International Energy Agency, including International Energy Agency. 2007. \nWorld Energy Outlook 2007. Paris. \n4  National coal-based generation was about 28% in 2007 (35% in Luzon, 10% in the Visayas, and 20% in the \nMindanao grids). \n5  Philippines $0.22 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), Cambodia $0.20 per kWh, Viet Nam $0.06 per kWh, and Indonesia \n$0.065 per kWh. \n6  Open access means that the utility\u2019s wires are \u201copen\u201d and can be used by a customer to receive electricity from an \nalternative source. Open access gives a customer the choice to shop around for a \u201ccheaper\u201d source of electricity, \nswitch directly to the cheaper alternative, and pay the incumbent utility only for regulated transmission and \ndistribution charges. \n ", "3 \nof high energy prices. The Government recognizes that it alone cannot identify and finance the \nvarious energy-efficiency initiatives, and therefore, developed a two-pronged implementation \nplan. Under this plan, the Government will make residential customers aware of the economic \nbenefits of energy efficiency; and for commercial and industrial customers, the Government will \ncreate an enabling policy and lending environment to encourage private sector investments in \nenergy efficiency. These measures will ensure efficient use of electricity by all consumers, thus \nlowering consumer cost and costs of the government and private corporations for electricity; and \nultimately reduce the import of fossil fuels. \n \n9.  To implement this plan, the Government requested ADB support. The plan will reduce \nthe impact of high energy prices and the overall carbon footprint of the energy sector.  \n \nB.    Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities  \n1.  Key Problems and Constraints  \n10.  Power Shortage. Electricity demand is projected to increase by about 6% during 2008\u2013\n2014. This will require adding 4,000 MW of new generation capacity.7 By 2012, power shortages \nare expected in the Luzon and Visayas grids as demand growth will catch up with current \nexcess generation capacity. In January 2008, the Government, in its updated energy sector \ndevelopment  plan,  identified  14  power  projects  with  a  total  capacity  of  2,534  MW.  The \nGovernment expects the private sector to invest in these generation projects and to trade power \nin the power pool or sell directly to distribution utilities.  \n \n11.  Benefits of Competition Delayed. Unbundling power ensures appropriate investments \nand  efficient  operation  through  (i)  competition  in  generation  and  retail;  and  (ii) effective \nregulation, as a surrogate for competition, for monopoly transmission and distribution. Despite \nthe facts that (i) power restructuring is well advanced, (ii) the Philippines is a role model for the \nregion, and (iii) the Government has been successful in attracting private investors to purchase \nold NPC generation plants at higher than expected prices,8 consumers have not yet benefited \nfrom the reforms in terms of lower electricity prices. The main competitive element\u2014open \naccess\u2014has not yet been implemented.  \n \n12.  System Peak. The system peak in most rural electric cooperatives is driven by the \nevening  lighting  load;  unlike  Meralco,  where  the  late  afternoon  system  peak  is  driven  by \ncommercial  air-conditioning  load.  A  large  part  of  the  rural  system  peak  is  contributed  by \nincandescent bulbs in households, inefficient linear fluorescents in commercial buildings and \nsmall factories, and inefficient public lighting. Widespread use of inefficient lighting (residential \nand  commercial)  has  created  capacity  constraints  within  the  rural  electric  cooperatives \n(particularly  in  remote  rural  areas)  by  increasing  system  peak  demand,  and  eroding \ntransmission reserve capacity and generation capacity. This inefficient lighting has not only \nburdened  end  consumers  with  excess  electricity  bills,  it  also  contributes  to  additional \ngreenhouse gas emissions caused by the excess generation needed (from diesel or fuel oil) for \nthe extra electricity to supply the inefficient lighting.  \n \n13.  Lack of ESCO Development. An energy service company (ESCO) is a private business \nthat engages in a performance-based contract with a client to identify and implement energy-\nefficiency measures to reduce the client\u2019s energy consumption at the client\u2019s premises. A super \n                                                 \n7  Department of Energy. 2008. Power Development Plan 2006 Update. Philippines. \n8  Prices ranged from $1.55 million to $2.03 million per megawatt. \n ", "4 \nESCO aggregates activities of other ESCOs and brings financing for projects. It can take the \nform of a leasing or financing company to provide ESCOs and/or customer\u2019s energy equipment \non lease or benefit-sharing terms. It will also lead efforts to develop the ESCO industry with \ncapacity building, knowledge management, and market development. \n \n14.  With one of the region\u2019s highest electricity tariffs (after Japan), the Philippines should be \nthe one of the most attractive places for investments by ESCOs. The high electricity prices \nprovide excellent incentives for establishing ESCOs to undertake energy-efficiency projects; \nunfortunately, this is not the case and only a few ESCOs are operating in the country. To date, \nvery few energy-efficiency projects have been implemented. The main barriers to ESCOs are \n(i) limited  or  no  access  to  funds  (without  collateral  or  guarantees),  (ii)  lack  of  technical \nevaluation capacity in commercial banks, (iii) lack of flagship projects and general awareness of \nenergy efficiency by end users, and (iv) inadequate policy support.  \n \n15.  ESCOs  need  to  promote  energy-efficiency  ideas  and  concepts  to  commercial  and \nindustrial customers where electricity represents only about 10%\u201315% of their operating cost. \nBusiness managers are either not aware or do not consider energy efficiency as a priority \ndespite high returns on energy-efficiency investments. \n \n16.  Mercury Pollution. The compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) contains 2\u20135 milligrams of \nmercury. A typical linear fluorescent lamp, used commonly in offices and houses, contains \nabout 12 milligrams of mercury. These lamps have been in use for the last 40 years, and only \nrecently have governments begun addressing issues of their safe disposal. Mercury poses a \nhazard  to  pregnant  women,  infants,  and  children.  People  in  the  Philippines,  as  in  many \ndeveloping countries, dispose of fluorescent lamps in landfills, ultimately polluting groundwater. \nThe Government plans to institute measures that will address mercury content in CFLs sold in \nthe Philippines, and to collect mercury from old fluorescent lamps before disposal.  \n \n2.  Opportunities \n17.  Efficient  lighting  reduces  electricity  demand  for  lighting  by  around  40%.  In  the \nPhilippines, where the domestic and commercial lighting base is large, lighting is the main driver \nof the peak load. About 1,300 MW of the peak demand can be saved by switching to the use of \nenergy-efficient lights. More than 40 million incandescent lights are in operation, according to \nthe  Philippines  Lighting  Industry  Association.  Only  20%  of  the  electricity  used  by  an \nincandescent bulb produces light; the remaining 80% is wasted as heat. A CFL uses all of its \nelectricity input to produce light, saving about 80% of power consumption. Because of their \ndesign, CFLs last about 10 times longer than incandescent lamps.  \n \n18.  Governments, worldwide, are encouraging customers to use more CFLs, as the savings \nare  much  more  than  the  avoided  cost  of  adding  new  generation  capacity.  The  additional \nbenefits are environmental, including avoided greenhouse gas emissions. Perusahaan Listrik \nNegara, the national electricity utility in Indonesia, started distributing CFLs to its residential \ncustomers in 2007. Australia, Canada, People\u2019s Republic of China, Thailand, Viet Nam, and \nmany other countries have used a CFL distribution program as an effective alternative to \nbuilding new power stations to meet growing demand. Put simply, if 1 million incandescent \nbulbs are replaced with CFLs at a cost of about $1.5 million, the electricity demand will be \nreduced by 50 MW. The impact on the power system will be the same as building a new 50 MW \npower station, which may cost at least $50 million, another $2 million\u2013$3 million each year to \noperate, and 3\u20134 years for construction.  \n \n ", "5 \n19.   Efficient Lighting Choices for Off-Grid Customers. Off-grid customers, with their high \ncost of generation, are looking for choices beyond CFLs. Light-emitting diodes (LED)9 can \nproduce the same amount of light as a 40-watt incandescent bulb or a 13-watt CFL, with only \nabout 8\u20139 watts and have an effective life of more than 50,000 hours (replacement of a light \nbulb every 30  years).10 Projects are being undertaken in Africa to replace inefficient kerosene \nlanterns with LEDs in off-grid areas.11 LED lighting, coupled with a small solar panel, is an \nenvironment-friendly  alternative  for  remote  populations  with  no  access  to  grid-connected \nelectricity. This technology can bring large benefits for off-grid communities in the Philippines \nwho are dependent on kerosene lamps.  \n \n20.   Efficient Public Lighting. In the Philippines, public lighting (street lighting and lighting \nof public areas) is subsidized and local government units are responsible for managing it.12 In \nthe provinces, most street lighting uses inefficient lighting technologies, such as fluorescent \nlights, incandescent bulbs, and low-pressure mercury vapor lamps. India, Thailand and Viet \nNam have developed national efficient public lighting programs. The Philippines could use \nefficient  lights  for  public  lighting  to  reduce  the  need  for  energy  generation  and  avoid  the \nassociated carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions.  \n2\n \n21.  Efficient Buildings. Commercial buildings consume large amounts of energy estimated \nat about 25%\u201340% of energy used globally, generating 30%\u201340% of greenhouse gases and \n30%\u201340% of solid waste. According to a recent publication, improving energy efficiency in \nbuildings  by  implementing  (i)  lighting  retrofits;  (ii)  improved  heating,  ventilation,  and  air-\nconditioning systems; and (iii) building control systems can reduce more than 700 million tons of \ngreenhouse gases, mostly at net negative marginal costs. 13   \n \n22.  In many countries, this priority area is addressed through efficient-building initiatives14 by \nencouraging adoption of efficient-building practices through (i) incorporating better designs such \nas  building  orientation  and  construction;  (ii)  implementing  improved  operation  systems \n(maintenance,  control  systems,  monitoring,  communication,  and  waste  disposal);  and  \n(iii) improving overall building management, including ventilation and air-conditioning. In the \nPhilippines,  four  major  professional  groups  are  involved  in  developing  efficient-building \ninitiatives. These groups share common long-term goals and plan to align their short-term \nactivities. Together, they plan to develop a building rating system for the country. This has the \npotential  to  avoid  emissions  of  about  2.2  million  tons  of  CO   over  the  next  10  years. \n2\nDevelopment of an acceptable rating system for the Philippines\u2014both for new and retrofitted \nbuildings\u2014is  a  priority  for  the  Government.  The  proposed  efficient-building  system  will  be \nimplemented as a national voluntary rating scheme.  \n \n3.  Government Strategy for Energy Efficiency and Tackling Climate Change  \n23.  In 2004, the Government launched its National Energy Efficiency and Conservation \nProgram,  which  includes  activities  supporting  energy-efficiency  standards  and  labeling, \ndemand-side management, energy management, recognition programs, advisory services, and \nmonitoring. The Department of Energy (DOE) implemented the Philippine Efficient Lighting and \n                                                 \n9  Light-emitting diode is commonly seen as a tiny orange or red display light in electronic products. \n10 Usually, the life of light bulbs is shorter\u2014incandescent bulbs last for 800 hours, while CFLs last for 8,000 hours.  \n11 \u201cLighting Africa\u201d is an initiative of the World Bank Group and the International Finance Corporation.  \n12  Consumption is not metered and charges are based on P6 per kWh tariff fixed charge per light.  \n13  McKinsey & Company. 2007. Reducing US Greenhouse Gas Emissions: How Much at What Cost?

In the context of the later this proposed \nproject was formulated at the request of the Government.  \n \n24.  At about 1.0 ton per capita, the Philippines\u2019 emissions of CO  are among the lowest in \n2\nSoutheast Asia.16 The country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions totaled 100 million tons equivalent \nof CO  in 1994. The Philippines, being a nonannex I17 country in the United Nations Framework \n2\nConvention on Climate Change, does not have any immediate restrictions and is not expected \nto implement its climate change commitments unless developed countries provide funding and \ntechnology.  However,  the  Philippines  was  among  the  first  countries  to create  a  dedicated \norganization to tackle climate change. In May 1991, the Government created the Inter-agency \nCommittee  on  Climate  Change  comprising  15 government  agencies  and  nongovernment \norganization representatives, and in August 2007 the Government established the Presidential \nTask Force on Climate Change, with the DOE secretary as chair.  \n \n25.  The task force\u2019s mandate includes (i) undertaking strategic approaches and measures to \nprevent or reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including fuel efficiency, energy conservation, \nuse of renewable energy, and waste management; and (ii) conducting a comprehensive public \ninformation and awareness campaign nationwide to educate the public on the climate change \nsituation and its adverse effects. The task force organized the Energy Summit in January 2008 \nwith ADB as its technical advisor, and led the development of a road map for energy efficiency \n(Appendix 2 and Supplementary Appendix A).  \n \n26.  Private Sector Investment in Energy Efficiency. Since the oil crisis of the 1970s, \nESCOs  have  flourished18 worldwide,  and  despite  low  oil  prices  in  the  last  5\u201310  years, \ninvestments in energy efficiency have continued with newer technology. Recently, Thailand\u2019s \nEnergy  Efficiency  Revolving  Fund  Program  implemented  200  projects  without  any  credit \ndefaulters  over  5  years.  In  the  United  States,  the  Federal  Energy  Management  Program \ninvested  about  $20  billion  in  energy-efficiency  projects  between  1990  and  2000.  ESCO \nrevenues from these investments were estimated at about $2 billion for 2000.  \n \n27.  The  Federal  Building  Initiative  (launched  in  1991  by  the  Government  of  Canada) \nsupported federal departments to contract with ESCOs to develop and implement energy-\nefficiency retrofits through performance contracts. By 2006, it delivered 7,500 retrofitted federal \nbuildings and other facilities attracting about $240 million of private sector investment and \nannual savings of $33 million. Many other similar programs are supporting ESCO development, \nfor example, the Australian Government Energy Efficiency Investment Program, the Hungary \nEnergy Efficiency Guarantee Fund, Bulgarian Energy Efficiency Fund, and Energy Efficiency \n                                                 \n15  The project seeks to encourage consumers in the Philippines to switch from the use of incandescent bulbs to more \nenergy-efficient lighting systems. \n16  Indonesia  (1.4  tons  per  capita),  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (0.2),  Malaysia  (6.4),  Philippines  (1.0), \nSingapore (11.3), Thailand (3.9) and Viet Nam (0.9). \n17 Annex I countries include the industrialized countries that were members of the Organisation for Economic  \nCo-operation and Development in 1992, plus countries  with economies in transition, including the Russian \nFederation, the Baltic States, and several central and eastern European states (http://unfccc.int). \n18  An international survey of the ESCO industry, published by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in \nBerkeley, California, in November 2003, collected ESCO activities in 38 countries outside of the United States and \ncalculated the total amount of ESCO activity to be between $560 million and $620 million. \n ", "7 \nLoan Fund in India.19  The strategy of the Government of the Philippines is to attract private \ninvestments in implementing energy efficiency by creating a conducive policy environment for \nsuch investments.  \n \n28.  Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Credits.20 The increase in concentration of \ngreenhouse  gases  (mainly  carbon  dioxide,  methane,  nitrous  oxide,  hydrofluorocarbons, \nperfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride) in the atmosphere has increased heat retention and \ncaused  changes  in  the  climate.  In  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  the  common  but  differentiated \nresponsibilities are recognized and emission reduction targets set for developed countries, \nwhich creates a market in emissions reductions. The CDM was defined in the Kyoto Protocol to \npromote lower emissions from projects in developing countries.  \n \n29.  The CDM is a market-based financial instrument that assists developing countries to \nachieve sustainable development and industrialized countries to meet their emission reduction \ntargets.  It  encourages  investments  in  \u201cclean\u201d  projects  in  developing  countries  that  reduce \nemissions below the baseline scenario. These emission reductions, once verified and certified \n(called certified emission reductions [CERs]), can be acquired by developed countries to comply \nwith their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. CERs are measured in terms of carbon \ncredits. The advantages of the CDM are (i) a reduction in global emissions of greenhouse \ngases; (ii) assistance to developing countries to meet their sustainable development objectives \nand  promote  cleaner  projects;  (iii)  help  for  industrialized  countries  to  meet  their  emission \nreduction targets; and (iv) use of a market-based approach to ensure efficient reduction of \ngreenhouse  gases.  The  actual  emission  reductions  have  to  be  monitored,  verified  by \nindependent parties, and then certified by the CDM executive board to capture a project\u2019s \nbenefit as CERs, which can be traded in the carbon market. Each CDM project requires a \nbaseline  and  monitoring  methodology.  All  energy-efficiency  projects  qualify  for  the  CDM \nmechanism. \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy  \n30.  ADB has been a partner in developing power in the Philippines, and contributed to \nincreasing the country\u2019s electrification rate of barangays (villages) from 55% in 1986 to 94% in \n2006, and of households from less than 50% in 1986 to 75% in 2006. ADB assistance has \neffectively  brought  about  sector  reform;  an  independent  energy  regulator  was  established, \nsubstantial progress was made in privatization, and the wholesale electricity spot market is \noperating. \n \n31.  However, in an environment where global concerns for the threat of climate change are \nwell established, a strategy based solely on conventional energy is no longer sustainable on its \nown. Making electricity rates more affordable, averting power shortages beyond 2012, and \npromoting clean energy and energy efficiency are today\u2019s challenges. ADB\u2019s new strategy for \nthe Philippine energy sector will supplement its efforts in conventional energy with energy-\nefficiency and climate change mitigation initiatives. ADB has been working closely with DOE \nand the Presidential Task Force on Climate Change to formulate a road map for implementing \n                                                 \n19  International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank. 2008.

The road map is being developed with other stakeholders. For energy efficiency, in \n2008, ADB proposes to finance a range of pilot initiatives that will be scaled up as a larger \nintervention in subsequent years. The pilot initiatives cover proven energy-efficiency activities \nthat generate high return on investments, and are included in the Government\u2019s draft road map.  \n \n5.  Policy Dialogue  \n32.  ADB acted as technical advisor for the 2008 energy summit and developed an energy-\nefficiency road map for the sector, which encourages all consumers to switch to more efficient \nforms of lighting. Based on ADB\u2019s technical analysis and advice, the Government has decided, \nas a policy, to be the first country in Asia to phase out incandescent bulbs from January 2010.21  \nIf implemented, this will generate considerable savings: $1.3 billion in deferred new generation \ninvestments22 and a reduction of about 900,000 tons of CO  emissions per year. Despite these \n2\nhigh savings by society, some consumers may see this policy as a burden as the initial cost of a \nquality CFL\u2014that actually lasts about 10,000 hours\u2014is more than five times the cost of an \nincandescent bulb. Since customers are not fully aware of the energy savings potential, they \nconsider CFLs an expensive choice compared with the cheap incandescent bulb.  \n \n33.  The  Government\u2019s  initiatives  to  (i)  phase  out  incandescent  bulbs,  (ii)  implement \nefficiency improvements in government buildings, and (iii) support the development of ESCOs to \nhelp implement energy-efficiency projects need immediate direct investments.  \n \n6.  External Assistance  \n34.  ADB is the lead development partner in the Philippine energy sector, with a focus on the \nelectricity subsector. Over the last 30 years, ADB provided about $2.9 billion in loans and \naround $15 million in technical assistance to the sector, mostly focused on conventional energy. \nADB\u2019s assistance to power includes (i) 20 loans to NPC ($1.6 billion) for power generation and \ntransmission projects, (ii) program loans for power subsector restructuring and debt liabilities \nmanagement ($1.3 billion), and (iii) 34 technical assistance grants for institutional strengthening \nand various studies (about $15 million).  \n \n35.  ADB takes the lead in providing policy advice to the Government on power subsector \nrestructuring, while continuing support to NPC. The World Bank has a more prominent role in \nrural electrification programs. Other major multilateral and bilateral agencies involved in the \nsector include the Japan Finance Corporation, Japan International Cooperation Agency, United \nStates Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and United States Agency for International \nDevelopment. ADB has been coordinating its assistance to the sector with other agencies, \nparticularly  the  World  Bank  and  Japan  Finance  Corporation.  In  recent  years  the  Swedish \nInternational Development Cooperation Agency, United Nations Environment Programme, and \nUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization have provided assistance to the industry \nsector. A summary of major external assistance to the sector is in Appendix 3. \n \n                                                 \n21  In her closing remarks at the 2008 Philippine Energy Summit, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo announced the \ncountry\u2019s plans to phase out incandescent bulbs by January 2010. \n22  Conservatively, 40 million incandescent bulbs (average 60 watts), replaced by 13-watt CFL, with 70% coincidence \nfactor, or 1,300 MW of deferred investment; 3 hours per day, 1,600 gigawatt-hours; 0.54 kilograms CO /kilowatt-\n2\nhour, 900,000 tons of CO . \n2\n ", "9 \n7.  Lessons  \n36.  ADB\u2019s recent involvement in the Philippine power subsector has been in the form of \nprogram support related to subsector restructuring. With ADB support, the Philippines is among \nthe first of ADB\u2019s developing member countries to implement fundamental power restructuring, \nwith substantive privatization of generation assets, and concession agreements with private \nparties to operate transmission assets and achieve a competitive market for electricity. This is \nan ambitious and complex task involving coordinated actions on legislative, regulatory, and \npolicy measures spread over a reasonably long period. The process started around 1998 and is \ncontinuing.  \n \n37.  ADB\u2019s interaction with the Government during its Energy Summit and other policy work \nclearly  demonstrates  the  Government\u2019s  willingness  to  support  investments  in  projects  to \nmitigate  the  impact  of  climate  change.  With  volatile  oil  prices  and  strong  Government \ncommitment, a broad-based, energy-efficiency project will set the foundation for future ADB \ninvestment,  and  if  implemented  effectively,  will  generate  an  opportunity  for  large-scale \ninvestment in the medium term. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.    Impact and Outcome \n38.  The final impact of the Project will be reduced cost of power generation. As electricity \ncannot be stored, its supply and demand has to be met instantaneously. During peak times, the \nmarginal  cost  of  generation  is  usually  about  5\u201310  times  more  than  the  average  cost  of \ngeneration. Therefore when the peak demand is reduced by using efficient lighting, the average \ncost of generation is reduced.  \n \n39.  Consumers\u2019 energy costs will be reduced with the use of efficient lighting. With reduced \nelectricity demand, the overall need for supply (generation) will be reduced. Also, a large \namount  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions\u2014and  the  associated  cost  of  importing  fuel\u2014will  be \navoided, creating carbon credits for the Project under the CDM. The Project will establish \nsustainable business models for large-scale implementation of energy-efficiency programs. It \nwill  reduce  public  sector  and  local  government  energy  expenditure,  reduce  health  risks \nassociated with residual mercury and kerosene (in off-grid areas), enhance livelihoods of rural \ncommunities, facilitate a viable ESCO industry, and establish a certification process for energy \nand environmentally efficient commercial buildings. \n   \nB.    Outputs \n40.  The Project will have the following outputs: (i) implementation of lighting retrofits in \nselected  government  buildings,  (ii)  provision  of  13  million  CFLs  to  consumers, \n(iii) implementation  of  energy-efficient  public  lighting  programs,  (iv)  expansion  of  testing \nlaboratory capacity and establishment of a mercury waste management plant for fluorescent \nlighting, (v) establishment of a super ESCO, (vi) implementation of a certification scheme for \nenergy-efficient buildings, and (vii) development and implementation of a communication and \nsocial mobilization program.  \n \n41.   The Project has four components, some of which are pilot programs that could be \nsubsequently scaled up as components of a future project.  \n \n ", "10 \n1.  Component 1: Efficient Lighting Initiative \n42.  Lighting  accounts  for more  than  50%  of  the  evening  peak  power load  in  the  rural \nPhilippines, where unlike in Metro Manila, use of air-conditioning (residential or commercial) is \nrelatively modest. The use of proven technology in efficient lighting can reduce this demand by \n40%\u201380%. The efficient lighting initiative will pilot the use of various efficient lighting options\u2014\nfluorescent  lamps,  CFLs,  LEDs,  sodium  lamps,  and  electronic  ballasts\u2014to  reduce  peak \ndemand. \n \na.  Subcomponent 1.1: Retrofit of Government Office Buildings \n43.  The goal of this component is to reduce wasted energy in government office buildings \nbecause of inefficient lighting equipment. Older-style fluorescent lamps, incandescent bulbs, \nand  inefficient  magnetic  ballasts  will  be  replaced  by  energy-efficient  alternatives\u2014new  T8 \nfluorescent lamps,  CFLs,  and  electronic  ballasts,  respectively.  This  will  supplement  DOE\u2019s \ncurrent initiative under the Philippine Efficient Lighting and Market Transformation Project, and \ntarget about 40 (of an estimated 300 nationwide) selected government office buildings for the \nretrofit. Within the limited budget of $3 million, this pilot will save about 7,000 megawatt-hours \nannually, equivalent to about $1.7 million; and avoid 5,000 tons per annum of greenhouse \nemissions.  \n \nb.  Subcomponent 1.2: National Residential Lighting Program \n44.  Many residential customers use at least two 40-watt incandescent bulbs. The objective \nof this component is to replace these two incandescent bulbs with CFLs: collect the working \nincandescent bulbs, gather them as evidence of a government-led program, and claim CDM \ncredits for the program. The electricity consumption for lighting will be reduced by 80% for these \ncustomers when they switch to energy-efficient CFLs. Overall, this initiative will distribute about \n13 million CFLs, free of charge, to residential and other customers of four private utilities23 and \nabout 108 electric cooperatives nationwide. This initiative will help customers to more easily \nadjust to the Government\u2019s proposal to phase out incandescent bulbs by 2010. \n \n45.  Customers in some off-grid areas will be provided with LED lights under a pilot program \nto  evaluate  the  use  of  LED  lights  in  place  of  kerosene,  candles,  and  other  nonelectric \nalternatives.  \n \n46.  A budget of $18 million, including $250,000 for the LED program, is allocated for this \ncomponent. Under this component, for example, by replacing two incandescent bulbs with two \nCFLs at no cost, each customer will save about P800 each year. This savings can continue for \nabout 7 years (life of a 10,000-hour lamp for 3\u20134 hours a day average use), and overall save \neach customer about P6,000 over the next 7 years. The Project will defer investment of about \n$450 million in new power plants in addition to the savings in fuel cost, and avoid about 300,000 \ntons of CO  emission annually from reduced power generation, the market value of which is \n2\nabout $3.0 million per year. Households switching to LEDs will save about P600 net per month \nfrom avoided use of kerosene lamps. A detailed plan for distribution of CFLs and LEDs is in \nAppendix 4. \n \n \n                                                 \n23  Manila Electric Company, Cagayan Electric Power and Light Company, Visayan Electric Company, and Davao \nElectric Company. \n ", "11 \nc.  Subcomponent 1.3: Public Lighting Retrofit Program \n47.  Incandescent bulbs and mercury vapor lamps are used for public lighting in most parts of \nthe  country  outside  the  large  cities.  Under  this  subcomponent,  efficient  CFLs  will  replace \nincandescent bulbs, while high-pressure sodium lamps will replace mercury vapor lamps, thus \nsaving about 60% of the electricity presently used. This component will demonstrate the use of \nLEDs as a replacement for incandescent lamps currently used in traffic lights. Within the limited \nbudget of $1.5 million, this pilot can save about 9,000 megawatt-hours annually, or about \nP54 million in electricity costs, and avoid greenhouse gas emissions of 5,000 tons per annum.  \n \nd.  Subcomponent 1.4: Energy Efficiency Testing and Lamp Waste \nManagement  \n48.  Minimum performance efficiency standards are commonly used to control efficiency \nstandards of everyday use appliances. This requires a country to be able to test for compliance \nagainst  a  set  of  technical  standards.  The  Government  introduced  minimum  performance \nefficiency standards for a range of appliances beginning in 1993 and has facilities to test room \nair-conditioners, small refrigerators, and CFLs. It plans to expand the capability of the existing \ntesting laboratory to enable it to test televisions, washing machines, large refrigerators, freezers, \nand  a  range  of  other  consumer  products.  The  budget  for  upgrading  the  appliance-testing \nlaboratory is $2.5 million. The Government estimates that the energy-labeling initiative could \navoid generation of about 8 million tons of CO  over 10years.  \n2\n \n49.  In addition, $1.5 million is allocated to establishing a new mercury waste management \nplant for recovery of mercury from used fluorescent lamps, and for preventing the residual \nmercury from entering the food chain through landfill dumps leeching into groundwater. The \nGovernment  plans  to  use  a  form  of  extended  producer  responsibility,  which  requires  the \nmanufacturer  or  importer  to  be  responsible  for  waste,  obliging  them  to  internalize  waste \nmanagement costs in their product prices, as an option for making the recovery of mercury a \nviable  commercial  business  model  that  will  attract  private  investors.24 DOE  has  signed  a \ncommercial  lease  agreement  with  a  private  waste  management  company,  which  has  all \nnecessary permits and clearances to deal with mercury and other hazardous wastes, to locate \nthe facility on its site. \n \n2.  Component 2: Efficiency Initiatives in Buildings and Industries \na.  Subcomponent 2.1: Super ESCO  \n50.  Despite the high prices of energy, and well-established private banking system, the \nESCO industry is not well developed in the Philippines compared with other countries in the \nregion. Lack of access to financing and lack of technical understanding by potential clients are \ntwo  of  the  main  reasons.  Through  this  project  component,  the  Government  will  introduce \nincentives and technical expertise to the industry.  \n \n51.  Various models of ESCO operations have been tried globally. The most appropriate \nmodel needs to take account of local conditions and participants\u2019 capacity (footnote 20). As a \n                                                 \n24\nExtended  producer  responsibility  is  a  strategy  designed  to  promote  the  integration  of  environmental  costs \nassociated with products throughout their life cycles into the market price of the products. Organisation for \nEconomic  Co-operation  and  Development.  1999.  Fact  Sheet:  Extended  Producer  Responsibility.  Available: \nhttp://www.oecd.org \n \n ", "12 \npilot under this subcomponent, the Government\u2019s strategy is to develop a working model of a \nsuper ESCO as a subsidiary of the Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC)\u2014a government-\nowned corporation under DOE.25 This newly established super ESCO will develop projects for \nits own implementation (for the public sector) and support development of other ESCOs (for the \nprivate sector) by providing financial and technical advisory support. The range of services \noffered by a typical ESCO includes (i) preliminary feasibility analysis including detailed audits of \nfacilities and design of energy-efficiency options and financing; (ii) installation services and \nmanagement; (iii) operation, maintenance, and performance monitoring; and (iv) promotion of \nenergy-efficiency technologies and services. A single organization leading all ESCO-related \nactivities will minimize transaction costs often necessary for successful implementation of a \nbenefit-sharing mechanism between a range of participants through financial, technical, and \nperformance guarantees. \n \n52.  Privately owned ESCOs and end users may be able to utilize both finance and technical \nexpertise of the super ESCO. This component has funding of $8.0 million. The proposed design \nof the super ESCO is presented in Appendix 5.  \n \nb.  Subcomponent 2.2: Efficient-Building Initiative \n53.  This  component  will  accelerate  implementation  of  the  building  rating  system  by \nstreamlining existing initiatives into a single nascent building rating system. The system will \ninclude sustainable site development, indoor air quality improvement, efficient energy and water \nuse  and  management,  solid  waste  management,  preference  for  green  materials,  and \npreservation  of  cultural  contexts.  This  will  be  enforced  through  voluntary  agreements  and \nsupported by developing awareness of the rating system. \n \n54.  The Government plans to extend the industry-rating system to (i) rate new and retrofitted \nbuildings, and (ii) expand it in harmony with other initiatives within the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations region. New buildings certified by the rating system could save up to 20% and \nretrofitted buildings will save up to 6% in energy costs annually. At least 200 new and 200 \nretrofitted  buildings  in  each  of  the  commercial  and  industry  sectors,  10 upper-middle-class \ngreen residential projects of 200 units each, and 10 low-cost green residential projects of 1,500 \nunits each are expected to be certified under the new efficient-building rating system over the \nnext 5 years. In addition, all government buildings that have completed energy savings retrofits \ncan apply for certification under the rating system. \n \n3.  Component 3: Communication and Social Mobilization  \n55.  Communication  and  social  mobilization  activities  will  be  grouped  into  two  streams: \n(i) communication  for  efficient  lighting,  and  (ii)  promotion  of  efficiency  in  everyday  life.  An \nintegrated campaign will be launched based on the detailed marketing plan developed with the \nGovernment during project preparation. The communication plan themes are (i) widespread \nawareness, (ii) widespread understanding, (iii) cooperation and participation, (iv) development \nof a sense of urgency, and (v) community ownership. A list of communication and social \nmobilization requirements for each project component is in Appendix 6. \n                                                 \n25  A super ESCO aggregates activities of other ESCOs and brings financing for projects. It can take the form of a \nleasing or financing company to provide ESCOs and/or customers with energy-efficiency equipment on lease or \nbenefit-sharing terms.  \n ", "13 \n4.  Component 4: Project Implementation Support \n56.  DOE, the Executing Agency, will recruit consultants under this component to support \nproject implementation, preparation of bidding documents (including technical specifications), \nbid evaluation, and program implementation coordination; and supervision. \n \nC.    Special Features \n57.  Linkage with the Philippines\u2019 Climate Change Initiatives. The Government\u2019s planned \nphase out of incandescent lamps by 2010 has a direct impact on some of the efficient lighting \ninitiatives proposed in this Project. Beyond the lighting initiatives, the ESCOs and potential \nscaled-up projects are the core DOE medium-term programs.  \n \n58.  Linkage  with  Global  Environmental  Initiatives.  Most  of  the  energy-efficiency \nprograms are inherently linked to global environmental initiatives, including the Kyoto Protocol, \nwhich the Government ratified in 2002. The national residential lighting program (paras. 44-46) \nqualifies for the CDM. The cash payment made in return for the CERs created by the program, \nonce it is registered as a CDM project, will enhance the commercial viability of the program and \nothers like it, and encourage private sector participation in energy-efficiency investment. \n \nD.    Project Investment Plan \n59.  The project cost is estimated at $46.5 million, including physical and price contingencies, \ninterest and other charges during implementation, and taxes and duties of $2.40 million (Table 1 \nand Appendix 7). \n \nE.    Financing Plan \n60.  The Government has requested a loan of $31,100,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. Consideration has been given to the amount of taxes and \nduties, and these do not constitute an excessively high share of project costs. The loan will have \na 25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge \nof 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project \nagreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB. The Asian Clean Energy Fund26 under the Clean \nEnergy Financing Partnership Facility will provide grant cofinancing equivalent to $1.5 million.  \nThe Government will finance $13.9 million (Table 2).  \n \n61.  Under a subsidiary loan agreement, the Government will make $8 million equivalent of \nthe ADB loan proceeds available through relending arrangements to the super ESCO. The \nsuper  ESCO  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange  risk  for  this  subsidiary  loan  agreement.  The \nBorrower will be the Republic of the Philippines. \n \n                                                 \n26 Established by the Government of Japan and administered by ADB. \n ", "14 \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n \nItem    Amount \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n62.   As the Executing Agency, DOE will be responsible for the overall technical supervision \nand execution of the Project. DOE will establish a project steering committee (PSC) to be \nchaired  by  the  Secretary  of  DOE  or  a  designated  DOE  representative,  which  shall  be \nresponsible for the overall policy guidance. The PSC shall meet at least on a quarterly basis to \nensure that the objectives of the Project are being achieved. In addition, DOE will be the \nImplementing  Agency  for  the  following  subcomponents:  (i) retrofit  of  government  office \n ", "15 \nbuildings, (ii) testing laboratory and mercury waste recovery plant, (iii) efficient-building initiative, \nand (iv) public lighting retrofits. Once incorporated as a subsidiary of PNOC, the super ESCO \nwill be the Implementing Agency for the ESCO component. NEA will be the Implementing \nAgency for the components involving the electric cooperatives\u2014national residential lighting \ninitiative except in the franchise areas of the private utilities. DOE will establish a project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU),  headed  by  a  director  and  appropriately  staffed  for  day-to-day \ncoordination. The PMU director will have overall responsibility for supporting implementation \nand providing guidance, administrative and technical support, counterpart staff, documentation, \nand other required services. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n63.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  2  years  from  April  2009.  The  detailed \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 8.  \n \n3.  Procurement \n64.   All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan and the Asian Clean Energy Fund \ngrant under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility will be carried out in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  the \nprocurement plan prepared and agreed between the Government and ADB. All procurement \ncontracts will contain anticorruption provisions as specified by ADB. The procurement plan is \nattached as Appendix 9.  \n \n4.  Advance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing  \n65.   The Government asked ADB to approve advance action to expedite the recruitment of \nconsultants  and  procurement  of  equipment.  Management  approved  advance  action  for \nprocurement of goods and services, and retroactive financing for an initial supply of CFLs that \nwill be ordered between 1 August 2008 and loan effectiveness, for up to $3.1 million (10% of the \nloan amount). This will cover tendering and bid evaluation for the equipment packages, but not \ninclude signing of contracts, except for the initial supply of CFLs under retroactive financing. \nAdvance action will allow DOE to initiate its communication plan and the first stage of CFL \ndistribution. The Government and the implementing agencies were advised that approval of \nadvance action or retroactive financing does not commit ADB to financing the Project.  \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n66.   Consultants will be selected and engaged under the Project in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). An international \nconsulting firm will be engaged to manage implementation of the Project. The firm will deliver \n127 person-months of consulting services (40 person-months of international and 87 person-\nmonths of national consulting) following ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection method. Two to \nthree  individual  consultants  will  be  hired  under  the  advance  action  to  develop  bidding \ndocuments for CFL and the waste management facility. They will assist the PMU in managing \nthe Project, preparing the detailed implementation plan (where necessary), developing bidding \ndocuments, supporting procurement-related activities, and preparing progress reports.  \n \n67.   The  consulting  team  will  closely  work  with  the  professional  media  firm  that  will  be \nseparately hired to deliver the communication and social mobilization component. Appendix 10 \nprovides the outline terms of reference for the consultants.  \n ", "16 \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy  \n68.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  DOE.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n \n69.  To ensure transparency and good governance, DOE will publicly disclose on its website \nand  the  Philippine  Government  Electronic  Procurement  System  information  on  how  loan \nproceeds are being used. For each procurement contract, DOE will disclose (i) the list of \nparticipating bidders, (ii) name of the winning bidder, (iii) basic details on bidding procedures \nadopted, (iv) amount of the contract awarded, (v) list of goods and services purchased, and \n(vi) intended and actual utilization of loan proceeds under each contract being awarded. DOE \nwill ensure that all project staff are fully aware of ADB procedures, including procedures for  \n(i) implementation, (ii) procurement, (iii) use of consultants, (iv) disbursement, (v) reporting,  \n(vi) monitoring, and (vii) prevention of fraud and corruption. To strengthen field monitoring of the \ndistribution  of  CFLs  to  customers  under  the  national  residential  lighting  program,  where \npossible, the electric cooperatives will enter into memorandum of agreements with qualified \nnon-governmental organizations that are acceptable to ADB to ensure their participation in the \ninspection and monitoring of CFL deliveries. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n70.  For activities to be implemented by NEA and DOE, the ADB loan will be disbursed as \ndirect payments to contractors and equipment suppliers. The Government will establish two \nimprest accounts\u2014the first managed by DOE to cover Project expenditures other than those \nexpenditures related to subcomponent 2.1 (Super ESCO), and the second managed by the \nsuper ESCO to cover Project expenditures related to subcomponent 2.1 (Super ESCO). The \naccount will facilitate timely release of funds for making payments, particularly for expenditures \nunder small contracts. Both DOE and the super ESCO will operate and maintain the imprest \naccount in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time \nto time). The advance to the imprest accounts, in aggregate, will be limited to 10% of its \nallocation financed by the ADB loan or 6 months projected expenditure of the component, \nwhichever is less. ADB\u2019s statement-of-expenditure procedure will be followed to liquidate and/or \nreplenish funds advanced to the imprest accounts, and will apply to individual payments less \nthan $100,000. Larger amounts will be disbursed as direct payments.  \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n71.  All  agencies  involved  in  project  implementation  will  maintain  separate  accounts \nexclusively  for  project-related  disbursements.  The  PMU  will  review  and  consolidate  these \naccounts and have them audited annually in accordance with sound auditing practices by the \nsovereign audit agency of the Government or other auditors acceptable to ADB. The audit \nreport will include a statement verifying whether or not the funds disbursed by ADB were used \nfor the purpose for which they were provided. The report will include the auditor's opinion on the \n ", "17 \nuse of the imprest account and statement of expenditure procedure. Copies of the audited \naccounts and auditor\u2019s report will be submitted to ADB within 6 months after the end of each \nfiscal year. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n72.  The PMU will prepare quarterly progress reports and submit them to ADB within 20 days \nof the end of the applicable period. The reports will be prepared in a format acceptable to ADB \nand include the following: (i) project progress in each project area, (ii) status of institutional \ndevelopment activities, (iii) delays and problems encountered and actions taken to resolve \nthem, (iv) compliance with loan covenants, and (v) expected progress during the next 6 months. \nA project performance management system will be developed on the basis of the project design \nand monitoring framework to examine the Project\u2019s technical performance, evaluate delivery of \nProject facilities, assess achievement of Project objectives and measure the Project\u2019s social, \neconomic, financial and institutional impacts. Baseline and periodic surveys will be carried out to \ncollect  data  disaggregated  by  income  group,  gender,  types  of  vulnerability  and  other \ncharacteristics as appropriate. Within 12 months of the Project\u2019s physical completion, DOE will \nprepare and submit to ADB a project completion report in ADB\u2019s standard format, including \ncosts and status of compliance with loan covenants.  \n \n10.  Project Review \n73.  In addition to regular monitoring, ADB and the Government will jointly review project \nperformance at least twice a year. The review will assess implementation performance and \nachievement of project outcomes and objectives, review financial progress, identify issues and \nconstraints affecting the Project, and work out a time-bound action plan for their resolution.  \n \n74.  In  2010,  ADB  and  the  Government  will  undertake  a  midterm  review  to  assess \nimplementation status; review project parameters; and take appropriate measures including \nmodifying  the  scope  and  implementation  arrangements,  and  reallocating  loan  and  grant \nproceeds, as appropriate given implementation experience, to achieve the project objectives. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.    Financial Analysis \n75.  The financial viability of the Project was assessed by conducting a financial internal rate \nof  return  (FIRR)  analysis.  The  FIRR  analysis  compared  the  project  financial  return  to  the \nweighted average cost of capital. The analysis was carried out in real terms using 2008 prices \nand  the  costs  include  capital  investment  and  physical  contingency.  The  financial  analysis \nexamined the aggregate costs and benefits from the efficient lighting initiatives. The financial \nbenefits are measured from the volume of energy savings of each efficient lighting component \nmultiplied by energy costs. For the whole Project, the financial analysis shows an FIRR of \n206%, which exceeds the weighted average cost of capital of 2.4%, indicating that the Project is \nfinancially viable (Appendix 11). \n \nB.    Economic Analysis \n76.  The value of reduced electricity consumption\u2014or savings\u2014due to the use of more \nefficient lighting systems (CFL, efficient ballast) is evaluated  as equivalent to the economic \nvalue  of  the  avoided  supply  generation  costs.  Electricity  consumption  in  the  with-project \n ", "18 \nscenario is 534 gigawatt-hours per year lower than in the without-project scenario. Apart from \nthe benefits accrued to society by way of avoided generation costs, the Project is credited with \nenvironmental benefits.  \n \n77.  The economic internal rate of return of the Project is 99%, implying that the investment \nwould  be  recovered  once  the  Project  is  implemented.  The  Project\u2019s  net  present  value  is  \n$106 million after 5 years of operation (Appendix 12). \n \nC.    Potential Carbon Credits \n78.  The national residential lighting program component has the potential to generate about \n300,000 tons of CERs each year (paras. 44\u201346). ADB\u2019s carbon market initiative will help the \nGovernment register the Project as a CDM project; this is anticipated by March 2009. \n \nD.    Environmental Benefits and Social Safeguards \n1.  Environment Aspects \n79.  Environmental benefits include less air pollution through the reduction of local emissions \nof  sulfur  dioxides;  nitrogen  oxides;  particulate  matters;  and  most  importantly,  CO .  The \n2\ncomponent addressing lamp waste management will include the collection of spent fluorescent \nlamps  from  households,  institutions,  and  business  establishments.  The  facility  will  enable \nconsumers to dispose of fluorescent lamps without damaging the environment. Disposal of \nspent CFLs and fluorescent tube lamps in landfills is among the primary sources of mercury \npollution that could migrate to groundwater and also become airborne. Recovery of glass tubes, \naluminum, mercury, and other lamp components by the recycling facility would reduce the need \nfor production of raw materials. Mercury emission during recycling is negligible. The recycling \nfacility has air emission control equipment to ensure that mercury levels comply with applicable \nstandards.  Regular  monitoring  of  indoor  air  quality  will  be  undertaken  during  operation. \nTransport, storage, handling, and packaging of recycled materials\u2014mercury in particular\u2014will \nbe in accordance with the requirements of the Republic Act 6969 (an act to control toxic \nsubstances and hazardous and nuclear wastes).  \n \n2.  Social Aspects  \n80.   The  project  impacts  were  assessed  in  terms  of  quality  and  reliability  of  access  to \nelectricity. The Project\u2019s social impact relates to household and social service organizations. \nThe replacement of incandescent lamps (25\u201360 watts) with 13- to 15-watt CFLs is expected to \nhelp  poor  customers  improve  the  lighting  in  their  houses.  This  is  especially  important  for \nchildren, since reading and doing homework with low lighting can cause eye strain and lead to \npoor eyesight. Better lighting will improve the household environment for social and economic \nactivities. In addition, CFLs will benefit poor customers directly by electricity cost savings. The \nsocial marketing and awareness, and motivational campaign on promotion of CFLs will be \ntargeted  at  both  men  and  women.  The  grassroots  campaigns  will  use  local  social  and \nnongovernment organizations to provide effective adoption and monitoring of CFLs. Appendix \n13 provides a summary poverty reduction and social strategy. \n \nE.    Sustainability  \n81.  The project design involved participation of a wide range of stakeholders, including the \nelectric cooperatives that will be implementing the Project under the leadership of NEA. The \n ", "19 \nwide range of consultation has helped develop a sense of ownership by all. The Department of \nFinance  has  allocated  the  necessary  amount  of  counterpart  funding  for  the  Project.  The \ndistribution  of  CFLs  will  accelerate  the  switching  from  incandescent  bulbs  to  CFLs  by  all \ncustomers.  \n \nF.    Risks \n82.  Risks that may affect project implementation, constrain attainment of objectives, and \nultimately impact project success include (i) lack of political will to support ongoing project \nactivities, (ii) institutional weaknesses, and (iii) significant reduction of the price of carbon credits, \nalthough the Project is viable without these.  \n \n83.  The CFL distribution component has some risks. Risk relates to the efficient and timely \nprocurement of CFLs and their distribution without any being sold by the commercial market. \nRisk also relates to the Government\u2019s ability to implement and enforce strict controls on energy-\nefficiency labeling and testing of CFLs. These risks are mitigated by ensuring that (i) the electric \ncooperatives distribute the CFLs to customers at their payment points, (ii) each CFL will be \nmarked \u201cnot for sale\u201d, and (iii) suppliers directly deliver the CFLs to the electric cooperatives.  \n \n84.  Each customer will use their electricity bill as a coupon and be made aware of the free \ndistribution via mass media communication. Appropriate monitoring mechanisms for effective \ndistribution and reporting of the CFL component will be developed. All electric cooperatives \nparticipated  in  developing  the  proposed  distribution  mechanism.  The  mechanism  will  be \noptimized during implementation of the first phase. Lessons from the distribution of the first lot \nwill be incorporated in subsequent distributions. \n \n85.  The  Project\u2019s  ability  to  create  enough  competition  among  the  major  lighting \nmanufacturers is not considered a significant risk. About 3 to 5 million units will be procured in \neach of the three lots to ensure strong competition and to discourage market dominance by any \nsingle brand.  \n \n86.  Establishment of a super ESCO has some risks. The risks associated in opening up the \npublic sectors\u2014hospitals, schools and office buildings\u2014to private suppliers may (i) take longer \nthan planned during design, (ii) face unforeseen legal barriers, (iii) need many more incentives \nand  encouragement  for  public  sector  managers  to  participate  in  the  process,  and  (iv) be \ndominated by several existing suppliers, inhibiting the growth of the market. DOE will address all \nthese risks in its detailed business plan. \n \n87.  The super ESCO will face several risks in developing the ESCO market for the industry \nand commercial sectors, for example: (i) not enough ESCOs will be interested in the super \nESCO\u2019s offers (financing and capacity building), (ii) end consumers may not trust a government-\nsupported ESCO because of perceived bureaucracy, (iii) competent staff may not be available \nto implement the super ESCO business plan, (iv) legal and procedural complications may slow \nthe needed quick disbursement, and (v) the ESCOs may not be able to design a benefit-sharing \ncontract  that  will  encourage  all  parties\u2014super  ESCO,  private  ESCOs,  and  end  users\u2014to \ncontinue energy efficiency-related activities to make it a sustainable sector despite the high \ntariffs. Appropriate measures are being developed to address these risks in the ESCO business \nplan. \n \n88.  Institutional Weaknesses. DOE does not have an adequate number of qualified staff \nfamiliar with ADB procedures; this may affect project implementation. DOE plans to address this \n ", "20 \nissue by restructuring to improve its effectiveness in meeting growing needs by redeploying staff, \nenhancing their skills through in-house training, and hiring contractual staff.  \n \nV.

Conditions for Disbursement  \n90.  No disbursement will be made from the loan account for subcomponent 2.1 (Super \nESCO) until: \n \n(i)  the super ESCO is established as a subsidiary corporation of PNOC with an \nindependent legal corporate personality under the Government\u2019s relevant laws \nand regulations, including the Corporation Code of the Philippines (1980); \n(ii)  a management team is appointed for the super ESCO; \n(iii)  the super ESCO has entered into a project agreement with ADB in terms and \nconditions proposed by ADB; and \n(iv)  the Government has entered into a subsidiary loan agreement with the super \nESCO in terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. \n \nVI.

Overview \n1.  Power  Generation.  The  National  Power  Corporation  (NPC),  a  vertically  integrated \nutility, was set up with the generation and transmission of electricity as its primary responsibility \nPrior  to  the  restructuring  of  the  power  subsector  in  February  2002,  NPC  and  several \nindependent  power  producers  (IPP)  shared  electricity-generating  functions  in  the  country. \nPrivately owned Manila Electric Company (Meralco), 16 privately owned utilities, 7 municipal \nsystems, and 119 rural electric cooperatives distributed electricity. Thirty-five IPPs (about 8,000 \nmegawatts [MW]) have contracts with NPC for the sale of electricity, while three others (about \n2,000 MW) have contracts with Meralco.  \n \n2.  Power Transmission. The National Transmission Company (TransCo) manages the \ncountry\u2019s power transmission network. It manages approximately 21,319 circuit-kilometers of \ntransmission lines including a submarine cable system, 93 substations, about 24,310 million volt \namperes substation capacity\u2014a total of about $2.5 billion in assets. As of June 2008, TransCo\u2019s \ngross reserve capacity in the Visayas is low: about 50 MW (peak load 1,135 MW), while \nsufficient margin exists in the other two national grids\u2014Luzon reserve 2,751 MW (peak load \n8,763 MW) and Mindanao reserve 504 MW (peak load 1,126 MW). Transco plans to double its \ntransmission  infrastructure  by  2014  with  an  estimated  cost  of  $3.70 billion.  According  to \nTransCo\u2014as  committed  by  the  2005\u20132014  Power  Development  Program\u2014the  required \ntransmission  infrastructure  expansion  and  upgrading  needed  to  support  new  generation \ncapacity is nearly 10,475 circuit kilometers of transmission lines and 22,785 megavolt-amperes \nof substation capacity. Long-term plans for a 500-kilovolt system include a meshed grid network \nfor  Luzon.  Meshed  grid  networks  at  138  kilovolts  are  also  planned  for  the  Visayas  and \nMindanao islands. \n \n3.  Rural Electrification. In 1969, the Republic Act 6038 created the National Electrification \nAdministration  (NEA)  as  the  primary  agency  responsible  for  implementing  the  rural \nelectrification policy. Within this framework, the rural electricity cooperatives are responsible for \nimplementing electrification targets, and for operating and maintaining the rural networks. In \n1999, NEA launched the Accelerated Barangay Electrification Program,1 aimed at providing \nelectricity to 90% of barangays (villages) by 2004 (and 100% by 2008). Subsequent programs \ngave momentum to renewable electrification, particularly for providing basic lighting services to \nbarangays in remote areas by using solar photovoltaic battery charging systems and home \nlighting systems. In 2004, NEA went through its own restructuring initiative, and reduced its staff \nfrom 730 to 313. It also moved from a loss of P5.6 billion in 2003 to breakeven in 2004. \n \n4.  By 2006, the rural electrification program had achieved the following electrification rates: \nan increase from 55% in 1986 to 94% in 2006 in the barangays; and from less than 50% in 1986 \nto 75% in 2006 for households. The Government plans to continue the rural electrification \nprogram as a priority.  \n \n5.  Power Shortage and High Electricity Prices. In the early 1990s, customers in the \nLuzon grid experienced severe power shortages, leading to prolonged blackouts and adverse \nimpacts on the economy. At the peak of the shortage, the blackouts averaged 12\u201314 hours per \n                                                 \n1  The initiative was initially a partnership of the Department of Energy, National Electrification Administration, \nNational Power Corporation through its Small Power Utilities Group, and Philippine National Oil Company\u2013Energy \nDevelopment Corporation. ", "26  Appendix 2 \nday. NPC and Meralco contracted IPPs to invest in new power generation. The IPP contracts \nincluded high-cost premiums to compensate for the high risk perceived by these investors. Most \nhad a take-or-pay feature requiring the power purchasers (NPC or Meralco) to pay even when \nthe IPPs were unable to generate electricity because of transmission and other constraints. \nAccordingly, NPC had to pay 25%\u201380% of the agreed-on prices irrespective of the power \ngenerated, which made IPP power 25% more expensive than NPC\u2019s own generation at the \ntime. In 2001, the actual electricity demand was 55% below the forecast for 2001 provided by \nthe precrisis Philippines Development Plan of 1993 (and revised high scenario of 1996). This \nmight be part of the reason for the huge surplus of stranded generation capacity of a very high \ntake-or-pay contract. This contingent liability for the Government and a combination of other \nproblems resulted in Philippine power rates being among the highest in the region. \n \n6.  Restructuring to Reduce Debt. Burdened with excessive debt, lack of competition in \nthe power subsector, and stranded generation capacity with high take-or-pay contracts, the \nGovernment  decided  to  restructure  and  privatize  the  power  industry.  In  1998,  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  supported  the  Government\u2019s  initiative  with  the  Power  Sector \nRestructuring Program2 for $300 million, which was supplemented by a partial credit guarantee \nin December 2002. The principal objective of the program was to create competitive electricity \nmarkets by unbundling generation and transmission, and providing open access to transmission \nand distribution.  \n \n7.  Unbundling and Privatization. The Electric Power Industry Reform Act, passed by \nCongress in 2001, was the blueprint for the 2002 restructuring. The act required the breakup of \nNPC\u2019s integrated assets into separate units for electricity generation and transmission. It also \nmandated the sale of the Government\u2019s equity holding in Meralco, the publicly listed company \nthat  owns  and  operates  the  country\u2019s  largest  electricity  distribution  network.  In  2001,  the \nGovernment established an independent regulator, the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) \nto oversee competition and monopoly regulation. \n \n8.  By  March  2003,  NPC\u2019s  assets  were  organized  into  two  state  holding  companies: \n(i) TransCo, which took on much of NPC\u2019s transmission assets, and (ii) the Power Sector Assets \nand  Liabilities  Management  Corporation,  which  assumed  control  of  the  power-generating \nassets.  The  restructuring  initiative  reached  an  important  juncture  by  2006  as  the  legal, \nregulatory, and institutional framework for privatization and competition were largely in place. \nHowever, for the restructuring to succeed, financial viability had to be restored, regulatory \nperformance improved, and the confidence of private sector investors increased. In November \n2006,  ADB  support3 consolidated  the  restructuring  process  by  (i)  correcting  the  long-term \nfinancial problems of the subsector, (ii) strengthening regulatory performance, (iii) enhancing \nconditions for privatization, and (iv) improving public confidence in the reforms.  \n \n9.  By early 2008, the Government awarded a 25-year concession to operate the national \npower  grid  to  a  consortium  for  $3.95  billion,  and  the  Power  Sector  Assets  and  Liabilities \nManagement Corporation formally approved the sale of more than 1,855 MW or 44% of NPC\u2019s \ngeneration assets in support of the Government's revised target of 70% privatization before the \nend of 2008.  \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1998.

Manila.  \n ", "Appendix 2        27 \n10.  Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM). As part of its sector restructuring policy \npackage, the Government established a competitive electricity spot market to facilitate electricity \ntrading among market participants. The Luzon WESM began commercially operations in mid-\n2006. During 6 months from June to December 2006, the volume of electricity traded in the \nLuzon WESM reached approximately 21 gigawatt-hours (GWh), with 20 generators and 15 \ncustomers participating in the market.  \n \n11.  In April 2008, the Department of Energy (DOE) deferred the proposed launching of the \nVisayas WESM on the grounds that although the market operator and its technical systems are \nin  place,  DOE  needed  to  review  the  situation  given  the  Visayas  inadequate  capacity  in \ntransmission  and  generation.  DOE\u2019s  decision  was  based  on  a  study highlighting  the  tight \ndemand and supply balance situation in Cebu, Negros, and Panay; and indicating that some of \nthe Visayas participants are not ready to effectively operate in an extended WESM.4   \n \n12.  Cross-Subsidies Removed. Beginning in 2002, the energy regulator, ERC, removed \nthe  intergrid  cross-subsidies  to  make  prices  more  reflective  of  the  underlying  cost  and  to \nimprove pricing signals to end consumers. This was followed by ERC\u2019s approval of the removal \nof interclass cross-subsidies for Meralco customers. With the removal of the cross-subsidies, \nMeralco\u2019s rates for each kilowatt-hour (kWh) were reduced for commercial customers (P0.70) \nand across a range of industrial customers (P0.27\u2013P0.89). These decreases were accompanied \nby rate increases to residential and other customers: residential and general service customers \n(P0.71), small industrial customers (P1.01) and government hospitals (P1.08). Cagayan Electric \nPower and Light Company (Cepalco) and Bukidnon II Electric Cooperative (Buseco) were also \ndirected to remove interclass cross-subsidies. As of 2004, ERC had approved unbundled rates \nfor  133  utilities  (including  Meralco)  to  bring  transparency  in  electricity  pricing;  showing \ngeneration, transmission, distribution, and supply costs separately on customers\u2019 bills.

Road Map \n \n1.  Philippines Energy Summit \n13.  The recent Philippines Energy Summit provided a forum in which all stakeholders could \ndiscuss and develop a consensus on the options for mitigating the impact of high-energy prices \non the general public, and how some of the options could assist in addressing climate change. \nStakeholders acknowledged that while the introduction of competition and open access in the \nwholesale electricity market and better targeting of existing subsidies can reduce electricity \ntariffs in the short term, a more effective solution for the longer term would focus on increasing \nthe use of indigenous renewable energy sources (such as geothermal energy, biomass, wind, \nand hydropower) and promoting energy efficiency. \n ", "30  Appendix 2 \n \n14.  The summit topics included (i) attaining energy security and sustainable development, \n(ii) accelerating oil and gas exploration  and development, (iii) promoting renewable energy \ndevelopment and utilization, and (iv) easing the burden of increasing prices on energy and \npower users. \n \n15.  The  summit  workshop  identified  three  strategies:  introducing  innovative  market \ninterventions, strengthening energy-efficiency and conservation efforts already under way, and \nestablishing an institutional framework to mainstream energy efficiency and conservation within \nthe operation of the energy market. \n \n16.  The  road  map  (Supplementary  Appendix  A)  draws  heavily  on  the  thoughts  and \nrecommendations  of  the  summit\u2019s  energy-efficiency  workshop.  The  main  recommended \ninitiatives are to  \n \n(i)  reinstate demand-side management practice by distribution utilities; \n(ii)  undertake large-scale replacement of incandescent bulbs by CFLs; \n(iii)  establish a legal framework for demand-side energy efficiency through policy; \n(iv)  establish a retrofit program and guidelines for commercial and industry sectors; \n(v)  create comprehensive and innovative financial facilities, e.g., loan guarantees, \nand fund for energy efficiency and renewable energy; \n(vi)  implement lighting retrofit in government office buildings; \n(vii)  encourage public lighting retrofit programs; \n(viii)  scale-up information, education, and communication efforts on energy efficiency; \nincluding promotion of energy efficiency in everyday life; \n(ix)  introduce higher taxes for inefficient technologies; \n(x)  support implementation of Administrative Order 183; \n(xi)  develop a lamp waste management policy; \n(xii)  develop a policy study on the calibrated phaseout of inefficient technologies \n(initially incandescent lamps); \n(xiii)  introduce a fleet management program for public transport operators; \n(xiv)  establish baseline data and benchmarks; \n(xv)  develop curriculum integration and instructional material; \n(xvi)  include social mobilization program for market monitoring; \n(xvii)  mandate  designation  of  energy  manager  in  all  energy-intensive  consumers \n(consuming at least 1 million liters of oil equivalent per year); and \n(xviii)  study and, where appropriate, promote nonmotorized transport.  \n \n ", "    Appendix 3     31      \nSUMMARY OF MAJOR EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ENERGY SECTOR \n \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is the lead official development partner in the \nenergy sector, with a focus on the power subsector. Since 1971, ADB has provided 28 loans for \na total of $2.9 billion to the energy sector. This includes 20 loans to the National Power \nCorporation (NPC), guaranteed by the Government, with a combined value of $1.6 billion. In \naddition, ADB provided two program loans for power sector restructuring and debt liabilities \nmanagement totaling $750 million and a partial credit guarantee of $500 million. ADB also \nprovided  35  technical  assistance  grants,  with  a  combined  value  of  \n$15.5 million, covering areas such as (i) coal industry development, (ii) rural electrification,  \n(iii) energy conservation, (iv) tariff and pricing studies, (v) regulation, (vi) consumer impact \nassessment, (vii) geothermal steam and natural gas pricing studies, (viii) power development \nplanning, (ix) feasibility studies, and (x) environmental assessments. \n \n2.  The World Bank also has been active in the power subsector. To improve coordination \nof their operations, ADB and the World Bank reached an understanding in 1998 on the division \nof  responsibility  for  power.  ADB  would  take  the  lead  in  providing  policy  advice  to  the \nGovernment on power restructuring, while continuing support to NPC before its privatization. \nThe World Bank would assume a more prominent role in rural electrification programs. ADB has \nbeen coordinating its assistance with other agencies, including the Japan Bank for International \nCooperation.  Other  major  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies  involved  include  the  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, United States Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and \nUnited States Agency for International Development (Table A3).  \n \n3.  In  the  field  of  energy  efficiency,  ADB  is  scaling  up  energy-efficiency  market \ntransformation  efforts  by  building  on  the  legacy  outputs  of  previous  and  ongoing  capacity \nbuilding,  technology  demonstration,  and  barrier  removal  projects  funded  by  the  Global \nEnvironment Facility (through its implementing agencies, the International Finance Corporation \nof the World Bank Group and the United Nations Development Programme), Japan International \nCooperation Agency and United States Agency for International Development. The Swedish \nInternational Development Cooperation Agency, United Nations Environment Programme, and \nUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization have provided smaller grant assistance to \nthe industry sector in recent years. While these programs were useful in clearing the market \nbarriers  to  commercializing  energy-efficiency  technologies  and  mainstreaming  demand-side \nmanagement measures, none was able to scale-up and sustain the desired transformation of \nthe local energy-efficiency market. \n \nTable A3: Summary of External Assistance \n \nMultilateral and Bilateral   \nAgencies  Activities \nThe World Bank Group  In 2003, the World Bank approved the Rural Power Project with a \ncredit line of $20 million to support rural electrification projects. The \nInternational  Finance  Corporation,  as  the  Government-appointed \ntransaction advisor, assists the Government in implementing private \nsector participation in areas currently served by the National Power \nCorporation\u2019s Small Power Utilities Group. \nGlobal Environment Facility   During 2000\u20132005, the Global Environment Facility provided $2 million \nfor  the  Efficient  Lighting  Initiative:  Philippines  country  program, \n$10  million  for  the  Philippine  Electric  Cooperative  System  Loss \nReduction  Project,  $3  million  for  the  Philippine  Efficient  Lighting \n ", "32  Appendix 3 \nMultilateral and Bilateral   \nAgencies  Activities \nMarket  Transformation  Project,  and  $3  million  for  the  Capacity \nBuilding to Remove Barriers to Renewable Energy Project. \nJapan Finance Corporation   The bank is providing financing for transmission systems particularly in \nthe  Visayas  and  Mindanao;  and  is  involved  in  supporting  private \ninvestors for power generation plants. \nJapan International Cooperation  The agency is providing institutional support to the Department of \nAgency  Energy for the preparation of the power sector development program \n(including demand forecast methodology), transmission development \nplan, and missionary electrification development plan. \nUnited States Overseas Private  The corporation\u2019s substantial exposure to the power subsector is well \nInvestment Corporation  diversified and all of its National Power Corporation related risk is \ncounterguaranteed by the Government of the Philippines. In 2003, the \ncorporation insured a $250 million 15-year National Power Corporation \nand Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation \nbond with non-honoring of sovereign guarantee coverage.  \nUS Agency for International  The  agency,  through  the  United  States  Department  of  Energy, \nDevelopment  provides technical assistance to the Energy Regulatory Commission \n(and its predecessor Energy Regulatory Board) in utility demand-side \nmanagement, tariff setting, rate unbundling, and removal of cross-\nsubsidies;  guidelines  on  open  access;  and  relevant  institutional \nstrengthening, including training. \n \nOther Bilateral Assistance  Bilateral aid agencies from Australia, Denmark, France, Germany, and \nUnited Kingdom have been providing support to strengthen the Energy \nRegulatory Commission, and to develop new and renewable energy \nand  rural  electrification.  The  Swedish  International  Development \nCooperation  Agency  provided  assistance  to  accelerate  energy-\nefficiency retrofits in the industry sector. \n \nSources: Asian Development Bank, Department of Energy, and World Bank. \n \n \n ", "    Appendix 4     33      \nCOMPACT FLUORESCENT LAMP DISTRIBUTION PLAN \n \n1.  The Philippine Energy Efficiency Project provides for the purchase of 13 million energy-\nefficient compact fluorescent lamps (CFL) for free distribution to the customers in metropolitan \nareas of Manila; the cities of Cebu, Cagayan de Oro, and Davao; and approximately 108 electric \ncooperatives covering all regions. The program will be implemented under programmatic Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism (CDM) guidelines, and involve the adoption of independent monitoring \nand verification of savings consistent with the methodology of the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change. This includes the collection of the replaced incandescent bulbs, \npreparation of inventories, certification, and safe disposal. \n \n2.  The free distribution will be on the basis of two CFLs of 13, 14, or 15-watt capacity \n(equivalent to 60\u201375 watt incandescent lamps) to residential and other customers in the electric \ncooperatives.  \n  \nA.   CFL Market Impact \n \n3.  The Government intends to phase out incandescent bulbs by 2010. It estimates that \nabout 40 million incandescent bulbs are currently in the Philippines market.1 Although the use of \nCFLs has significantly increased over the past few years, the availability of low-quality lamps \nhas distorted customer perceptions of CFLs. The distribution of free CFLs (international quality, \n10,000  hours  life)  to  residential  consumers  predominantly  in  rural  areaswill  provide  an \nopportunity to influence their adoption of CFLs. The current retail cost of CFLs is expected to \ndecrease because of economies of scale from increasing popularity, which would assist in \naddressing the current price gap between CFLs and incandescent bulbs. The quality of CFLs in \nthe market will increase as the market will look for CFLs with long lives\u2014similar to the 10,000-\nhour bulbs to be distributed under the Project. \n \nB.   Procurement Procedures \n \n4.  Procurement  of  the  13  million  CFLs  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB). In view of the multiple packages to be procured and the profusion of CFL manufacturers \nin  the  world  (many  of  whom  are  inexperienced,  have  limited  capacity,  and  offer  inferior \nproducts),  ADB\u2019s  single-stage,  two-envelope  procurement  procedure,  wherein  bids  with \nseparate envelopes for technical and financial proposals are submitted simultaneously, will be \nused. The project management unit (PMU) will open the technical proposal first and review the \nresponsiveness of the bidding documents. Only financial proposals of bidders with responsive \ntechnical proposals will be opened for evaluation and comparison. The financial proposals of \nbidders  whose  technical  proposals  are  not  responsive  will  be  returned  unopened.  CFLs \nprocured will meet relevant international standards.  \n \n5.  Certain manufacturers adopt their own individual standards within the 13- to 15-watt \nrange for \u201cwatts per lumen\u201d output criteria, with other manufacturers producing 13-, 14-, or 15-\nwatt CFLs as standard with slight variance in lumen output. A consultant expert in efficient \nlighting and its procurement will help the PMU prepare specifications and tender documents. \nThe bidding documents will incorporate the following special provisions: \n \n                                                 \n1  The  Philippines  Lighting  Industry  Association  estimates  68  million,  but  other  industry  experts  have  lower \nestimations. The report and recommendation of the President assumes 40 million for all calculations. \n ", "34  Appendix 4 \n(i)  CFLs must meet the highest international technical and environmental standards. \n(ii)  Bidding will be undertaken in specified batches to provide phased CFL regional \ndeliveries  to  accommodate  implementation  and  coordination  abilities,  not  to \nexceed 1 year. \n(iii)  Only screw fixings will be specified. \n(iv)  Delivery time frames for individual batches and explicit delivery locations will be \nprovided. \n(v)  Criteria will be included for evaluating 13- to 15-watt CFLs (watts versus lumen \noutput) for bid equalization. \n \n6.  The CFLs will be procured in three lots with about 3 million\u20135 million in each lot. The \nCFLs will be delivered by the winning bidder to each electric cooperative and distribution utility \nin the quantities specified in each package. The Department of Energy (DOE) will finalize the \nallocation during preparation of specifications and bidding documents.  \n \nC.   Preparatory Works \n \n7.  In preparation for the procurement and distribution of the CFLs, the PMU (with the \nassistance  of  its  energy-efficiency  lighting  expert)  will  undertake  the  following  preparatory \nactions: (i) prepare a detailed list of all eligible consumers in each of the participating utilities; \n(ii) design vouchers for distribution to eligible consumers for collection of CFLs in exchange for \nworking incandescent bulbs; (iii) prepare monitoring sheets and reporting formats for sales \nmonitoring, inventories of incandescent lamps, breakages, and lamp failures (and warranty \nreplacements);  (iv)  design  and  specify  appropriate  labeling  for  each  CFL  (to  be  indelibly \nattached in the factory) and that the CFL is \u201cnot for sale\u201d;2 and (v) prepare draft bidding \ndocuments for CFL procurement under advance action. \n \nD.   Distribution and Installation  \n \n8.  To determine the most secure and efficient method of CFL distribution in the Philippines, \na consultative workshop was undertaken with representatives from participating distribution \nutilities and electric cooperatives. They recommended the following distribution methodology as \nbeing the most efficient and secure in the Philippine context:  \n \n(i)   The appointed suppliers will deliver the CFLs in prearranged quantities (batches) \nto all the distribution utilities.  \n(ii)   The distribution utilities are responsible for internal distribution to their suboffices.  \n(iii)   Vouchers in the form of electricity bill inserts or \u201ctear-off\u201d slips with the customer \naccount number will be issued to all eligible customers in one billing cycle. The \nvouchers can be exchanged for the CFLs on a first-come first-served basis. New \nconnections will not be eligible for the program.  \n(iv)   Each distribution utility will distribute the CFLs by having eligible consumers \ncollect  the  CFLs  at  the  utility\u2019s  payment  points  (or  other  designated  secure \ndistribution points) in exchange for appropriate CFL vouchers.  \n(v)   Each consumer account will be eligible to exchange two working incandescent \nbulbs (of any wattage) for two CFLs (of single wattage).  \n                                                 \n2  CFLs distributed will be certified accredited laboratory protocol, and branded with a program logo and the product \nbrand name. The CFL should have a hologram (or similar) with a unique serial number that can be used during \nprogram monitoring and guarantee follow-up. \n ", "    Appendix 4     35      \n(vi)   Any excess CFLs will be returned to the National Electrification Administration for \nredistribution and not sold to the market.  \n(vii)   The incandescent bulbs collected will be made inoperable without damaging the \nglass  and  stored  in  specially  designed  colored  containers  for  each  wattage  \n(e.g., green for 25 watts, red for 40 watts, orange for 50 watts, blue for 60 watts, \nyellow for 75 watts, and brown for 100 watts). Using this simple method for \ncollecting  incandescent  bulbs  will  help  distribution  utilities  and  the  National \nElectrification  Administration  calculate  the  loads  taken  off  the  system.  The \ndistribution utility will keep an inventory of the incandescent bulbs.  \n(viii)   The  incandescent  bulbs  will  be  audited  independently  under  CDM-approved \narrangements to enable carbon credits to be obtained.  \n(ix)   A contractor will be appointed to crush the incandescent lamps so that they \ncannot find their way back into the market. \n \n9.  DOE will finalize the mode of distribution of light-emitting diodes in off-grid areas and \nCFLs in the metropolitan areas of Manila and the Cities of Cebu, Cagayan de Oro, and Davao \nduring implementation of the project.  \n \nE.  Preparation of Baseline  \n \n10.  During the preparatory works and the distribution process, a baseline will be prepared to \nassist in determining the peak reduction resulting from the CFL initiative and for submission to \nthe CDM authorities to justify appropriate CDM credits. The consultant with DOE will carefully \nresearch all the CDM requirements and prepare all checklists, questionnaires, and databases \nfor preparation of the baseline. \n \nF.    Post Installation Monitoring  \n \n10.  DOE, with the assistance of the energy-efficiency expert, will establish a scheme for \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  after  program  implementation  begins.  An  independent  entity  is \nproposed for this work, which would reinforce the CDM procedural requirements, particularly \nauditing.   \n \n \n ", "36  Appendix 5 \nSUPER ENERGY SERVICE COMPANY \n \nA.  Financing Facility in the Form of a Super Energy Service Company  \n1.  An energy service company (ESCO) promotes energy efficiency for end users. A super \nESCO supports capacity development and activities of others ESCOs, and brings financing for \nprojects. It can also take the form of a leasing or financing company to provide ESCOs and/or \ncustomers with energy-efficiency equipment on lease or on benefit-sharing terms. ESCOs can \nbe an important institutional mechanism for the delivery of energy-efficient investment.1 The \nGovernment plans to promote the ESCO industry by setting up a super ESCO, which will act as \nan ESCO for the public sector (hospitals, schools, and other public facilities) and as a super \nESCO for the private sector (industrial and commercial customers). For the private sector \nclients, it will work through the smaller ESCOs. It will support independent ESCOs working with \ncustomers to design and install energy-efficiency projects on a fee-for-service basis. They may \neither use their own equity or borrow funds to finance energy-efficiency projects using a shared \nsavings or equipment rental contracting arrangement.   \n \nB.  Justification for Creating a Super ESCO \n2.  The Philippines ESCO industry is a case of market failure. Despite high power tariffs, the \nESCO industry is limited to a few utility-owned (3), independent (consultants) (4), and vendor-\nowned  (6)  businesses.  Lack  of  access  to  financing,  and  lack  of  understanding  of  energy \nefficiency are the main reasons for this. Of 13 participants, only 6 are capable of organizing \nfinancing. A super ESCO can remove these barriers by bringing new risk capital for project \nfinancing. In the Philippines, a super ESCO can easily operate with a quasi-banking license2 \nissued by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the central bank, allowing it to borrow for onlending. \nThis is not allowed in many countries, for example Brazil. The Brazilian constitution limits the \nability of a \u201cservice\u201d company to invest in project finance. Leasing is a financial function and is \nlimited to financial corporations, which are regulated by the Brazilian Central Bank. This is one \nreason why Brazil had to take the relatively expensive financial guarantee route for promoting \nenergy efficiency. International experience suggests that the presence of a large number of \nESCO-like  companies  is  a  prerequisite  for  the  success  of  any  guarantee  fund  for  energy \nefficiency. If ESCOs are not present, then the market will not likely be able to produce quality \ndeal flow for the funds to survive. This is one other reason why the Government has decided to \nset up a super ESCO, rather than a simple financing facility. \n \n3.  Super ESCO models are common is the United States. The state of California was one \nof the pioneers of the super ESCO concept in the world. Countries like Australia, Canada and \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China also use public-owned ESCOs to promote this sector. Since in \nthe energy-efficiency business, the ESCOs\u2019 clients usually have stronger balance sheets than \nthe ESCOs, the loan to the client is often used as an option, a common practice in North \nAmerica. This creates two types of projects: shared savings projects, and guaranteed savings \nprojects when the loan is to the client. In the long term, the super ESCO would build its balance \nsheet for evaluation by lending institutions by raising equity capital. The investor in the super \nESCO will receive a risk-adjusted rate of return. When access to other forms of financing \nbecomes easily available, and the ESCO market expands, the Government may transfer the \nsuper ESCO to the private sector.  \n \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2008.

Capital  Costs  and  Financial  Benefits.  The  project  costs  include  all  the  capital \ninvestments for efficient lighting (component 1), efficiency initiatives in buildings and industries \n(component 2), and communication and social mobilization (component 3). The investments for the \nefficient lighting initiative include 36-watt fluorescent tube lightings for government buildings; 13, \n14, or 15-watt compact fluorescent lamps (CFL) for residential users; and 70-watt, 150-watt, and \n250-watt high-pressure sodium vapor lamps with poles for public lighting. All capital costs are \nexpressed in real terms using mid-2008 prices. The FIRR is calculated on the basis of the base \ncosts, excluding price contingency and financial charges during implementation. \n \n4.  The project component of efficient lighting initiatives is to distribute energy-efficient lights for \ngovernment buildings, residential use, and public lighting retrofit. Financial benefits are measured \nby  energy  cost  savings  from  replacing  old  lighting  with  new  fixtures.  The  energy  savings  is \n                                                 \n1  Calculation of ADB\u2019s cost of funds is conducted as follows: (i) 5-year swap rate as of December 2008 = 2.4%; (ii) ADB \nloan spread = 0.20%; (iii) nominal cost of ADB funds = 2.4 + 0.2 = 2.6% \n2   Referring to the market rate of the Government\u2019s 5-year local currency bonds.  \n3  Source: ADB estimates on domestic cost escalation factor for the Philippines and World Bank manufacturers unit value \nindex. \n ", "52  Appendix 11 \ncomputed from the volume of electricity savings from the use of efficient lighting multiplied by the \nGovernment\u2019s energy costs. Energy costs for government buildings and CFL distribution were  \nP8 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) ($0.16 per kWh) and public lighting of P6 per kWh ($0.12 per kWh), \nwhich were used during the periods of analysis.  \n \n5.  The payback period and FIRR of each efficient lighting fixture were calculated. The financial \nbenefits of using efficient lighting are very high with short payback periods (capital cost divided by \ncost savings) of 2.0 years for government buildings, 2.1 months for CFL distribution, and 4.1 years \nfor public lighting (Table A11.2).4  \n \nTable A11.2: Financial Benefit by Efficient Lighting \n \n  A1.1: Government  A1.2: CFL  A1.3: Public \nComponents  Buildings  Distribution  Lighting \nInvestment amount ($ million)  3.0  13.0  1.5 \nCost per fixture (P)  1,020.0  57.0  4,274.0 \nAnnual savings/fixture (kWh/year)  63.0  40.0  176.0 \nAnnual savings per fixture (P/year)  507.0  321.0  1,054.0 \nPayback period (year)  2.0  0.2  4.1 \nFIRR (%)  41.0  Positivea  16.0 \nCFL = compact fluorescent lamp, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, kWh = kilowatt-hour. \na  The FIRR of CFL distribution was not calculated because it produces positive net benefit from the initial year. Cost of \npublic lighting includes cost of lamps, poles, and installation fees. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n6.  The FIRR of the Project is 206%, calculated by including the capital costs of the Project and \nthe consolidated benefits from efficient lighting initiatives (Table A11.3). This high FIRR is due to \nthe  strong  financial  benefits  of  CFL  distribution,  and  reflects  the  short  payback  period  of  \n2.1 months. The FIRR exceeds the weighted average cost of capital, and therefore, the Project is \nfinancially viable. \n \nTable A11.3: Financial Analysis of the Project \n \nItem  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015  2016  2017 \nInvestment cost ($ million)  (5.4)  (33.6)  (3.6)               \nEnergy savings from the    53.4  534.0  534.0  534.0  534.0  534.0  480.9  3.0  2.7 \nProject (gigawatt-hour) \nEnergy cost (P/kilowatt-hour)    8.0  8.0  8.0  8.0  8.0  8.0  8.0  8.0  8.0 \nEnergy cost saving ($ mil)    8.8  87.8  87.8  87.8  87.8  87.8  79.0  0.4  0.3 \nNet benefit ($ million)  (5.4)  (24.8)  84.2  87.8  87.8  87.8  87.8  79.0  0.4  0.3 \n  Financial internal rate of return  = 206% \n( ) = negative. \nNotes:   (i) Life of CFL and lighting fixture is 6\u20138 years. \n  (ii) Energy cost of P6/kilowatt-hour is used for public lighting component. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and consultants estimates. \n \n                                                 \n4  Assumption of the benefit calculation (case of compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) distribution A1.2): A 14-watt CFL will \nreplace 50.7-watt incandescent lamps, saving 36 watts. Cost of one CFL = $1.17, 3 hours/day, 1,095 hours/year, with \nenergy cost of $0.16 per kWh, the annual savings: (50.7 watts\u201314 watts) x 1,095 (hours/year) = 40.2 kWh/year. Annual \nsavings in $ = 40.2 kWh x $0.16 per kWh = $6.4 per year. Therefore, the payback period will be $1.17/$6.4 = 0.18 year \nor 2.1 months. \n ", "    Appendix 12     53      \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Project Cost\u2013Benefit Analysis \n \n1.  The project components complement each other to reduce electricity consumption for \nlighting in the country. Three components\u2014retrofitting of government buildings, distribution of \ncompact  fluorescent  lamps  (CFL),  and  efficient  lamps  for  public  lighting\u2014directly  result  in \nreduction of electricity consumption. The other components facilitate this reduction. In this \nanalysis, the physical benefit of the Project is the amount of electricity saved by introducing \nmore efficient lighting systems in households, government buildings, and public lighting.  \n \nB.  Evaluation of Project Costs and Benefits \n \n  1.  Project Costs \n \n2.  The costs of the Project (to society) are the costs of equipment (lamps), labor, and \nimplementation. They include physical contingencies but exclude interest during construction \nand price contingencies. The total project cost is estimated at $42.6 million expressed in 2008 \nprices.  \n \n  2.  National Residential Lighting Program \n \n3.  The program will distribute 13 million CFLs throughout the country. By procuring these at \nwholesale price, the price per lamp will be reduced by almost 50% of the retail price. A survey \nconducted  during  the  implementation  of  a  Philippines\u2019  demand-side  management  project \ndetermined the average wattage of incandescent bulbs to be around 50 watts. Based on this, \nsingle wattage CFLs will be procured (13, 14, or 15 watts), equivalent to at least 60-watt \nincandescent bulbs. Each replacement results in a saving of 39 watts. With 3 hours of use per \nday, each replacement saves about 42.7 kilowatt-hours (kWh) annually contributing to total \nannual energy savings amount to 534 gigawatt-hours (GWh)/year and capacity savings to 450  \nmegawatts (MW). \n \n  3.  Retrofitting of Lighting Systems in Government Buildings \n \n4.  This  program  will  replace  the  standard  T12  fluorescent  tube  lamps  with  standard \nmagnetic ballasts with efficient 36-watt T8 fluorescent tube lamps and electronic ballasts. Any \nincandescent lamps will be replaced with CFLs. The savings result from lower consumption of \nelectricity of the electronic ballasts (1 watt) as compared to the magnetic ballasts (40 watts). \nThis program results in savings of 9 GWh. \n \n  4.  Retrofitting of Public Lighting Systems \n \n5.  This program will use high-pressure sodium lamps as a replacement for mercury vapor \nlamps; and the use of light-emitting diodes for traffic signals. The program is based on an \nimplementation model established between the Department of Energy (DOE), City of Cagayan \nDe Oro (local government unit), and Cagayan Electric Power and Light Company (electric utility) \nunder the Philippine Efficient Lighting Market Transformation Project. The program will yield \nannual energy savings of 1.5 GWh.  \n6.  Among the three components, the CFL program yields the greatest savings and thus \nplays a predominant role in the viability of the whole Project. To evaluate the project benefits, \nthe societal value of electricity savings resulting from the Project must be estimated. \n ", "54  Appendix 12 \n \n7.  Economic assessment of a demand-side management program can look at different \nperspectives of the parties involved, e.g., utility, customers, regulator, and society. For society, \nthe total resource cost (also known as economic efficiency) approach is used. This measures \nnet costs of a demand-side management program based on the total cost of the program \nincluding both participant and utility costs, and compares these costs with the total benefits, \nsuch  as  avoided  supply  costs,  avoided  participant  costs,  and  societal  benefits  such  as \nenvironmental externalities.1  \n \n8.  According  to  the  stated  approach,  the  value  of  reduced  electricity  consumption  (or \nsavings) due to the use of more efficient lighting systems (CFL, efficient ballast) is equivalent to \nthe avoided supply costs. Since savings occur at the end user level, the avoided supply should \nbe evaluated by looking at the mix of generation source in the Philippines. A data collection of \ngeneration charge for 14 power companies in three regions\u2014Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao\u2014\nreveals that the generation charge ranges between P2.37 per kWh and P7.06 per kWh, with an \naverage  of  P3.7  per  kWh.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  and  net  present  value \ncalculations are based on the average nationwide cost. \n \n9.  As savings are made by existing consumers, they will not affect the transmission and \ndistribution systems. The avoided supply costs therefore consist of avoided generation costs \nand avoided system losses. The resulting value of kWh electricity saved for the Manila Electric \nCompany (Meralco) is P5.68.2 \n \n10.  Apart from the benefits accrued by society by way of avoided generation costs, the \nProject is credited with environmental benefits. As electricity consumption in the with-project \nscenario compared with the without-project scenario would be lower by 534 GWh every year, \nemissions from power generation would also be reduced. The environmental benefits include \nless air pollution causing local impacts such as sulfur dioxides, nitrogen oxides, and particulate \nmatters.  But  most  important  is  the  reduction  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO )  emissions.  With  the \n2\naverage CO  emission factor of the Philippines power system estimated at 0.54 kilogram CO  \n2 2\nper kWh,3 the annual electricity savings of 534 GWh is accompanied with reduction of about \n300,000 tons of CO  per year.  \n2\n \n11.  The internal rate of return and net present value of this investment are obtained by \ncomparing the economic benefits of the Project against its costs (Table A12). The average \neconomic internal rate of return of the Project is high at 99 %, with investment recovered early \nduring project implementation. This is due to the very high electricity savings from a relatively \ninexpensive CFL program. The Project earns a net present value of $106 million after 5 years of \noperation. \n \n \n                                                 \n1  See for example: US Congress, Office of Technology Assessment. 1993.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \na.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Family Income and Expenditure Survey of 1997 showed that poverty incidence declined from 49.3% of the total \npopulation in 1985 to 40.6% in 1994 and 36.8% in 1997. Between 1994 and 1997, urban poverty incidence in the total \npopulation declined from 28% to 21.5%, while rural poverty incidence fell only from 53.1% to 50.7%; thus, more than half of \nthe rural population is still poverty stricken.  \n \nThe lowest incidence of poverty is in the National Capital Region and surrounding areas; while the highest, exceeding 50%, is \nin the Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao, the central and northern regions of Mindanao, and the Bicol region. The \npoor tend to be self-employed in agriculture and related activities in rural areas, and casual laborers of all types in urban and \nrural  areas.  The  link  between  rural  and  urban  poverty  is  strong  as  the  urban  poor  are  mainly  rural  migrants.  The \nGovernment\u2019s Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan 1999\u20132004 emphasizes poverty reduction through measures such \nas promotion of equitable growth, rural development, and increased social sector investments. In 1998, the Government \nestablished the National Anti-Poverty Commission and the Presidential Commission for the Urban Poor. A poverty reduction \ntarget envisaging a reduction in the incidence of poor families from 32% in 1997 to 25%\u201328% by 2004 was projected in the \nMedium-Term Philippine Development Plan.  \n \nAccording to the 2003 Family Income and Expenditure Survey, the country had 16 million families, with an average of five \nmembers, and an average annual income of P148,757 (increase of only 2.5% in nominal terms from 2000 or income declined \nin real terms by 10%), 84% of family income went to expenditures, and average annual saving of families was about P20,615. \n \nThe Philippines is suffering from a deteriorating infrastructure sector. Although electrification rates are higher than in many \ncountries in the region, a large proportion of the population still does not have access to electricity. For those who have \naccess, the high price of electricity discourages its use. Poor consumers using electricity for lighting use one of the most \ninefficient forms of lighting\u2014the incandescent bulb that uses 80% of its energy input to produce heat and 20% for lighting.  \n \nRecently, with the increase of international oil prices, poor consumers are increasingly burdened with the growing expense of \nmeeting their energy needs. In this context, the Government organized the Philippine Energy Summit in February 2008 to \ndiscuss options for mitigating the impact of high energy prices on the general public and decided to promote energy efficiency \nto help residential customers with their growing energy cost.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nIn the Philippines, a typical lifeline customer uses about 100 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity per month. Many of the \ncustomers use at least two 40-watt incandescent bulbs. One of the objectives of the Project is to replace these two \nincandescent bulbs with compact fluorescent lamps (CFL), collect the working incandescent bulbs, gather them as evidence \nof a government-led program, and claim Clean Development Mechanism credits. The electricity consumption for lighting will \nbe reduced by 80% for these customers when they switch to energy-efficient CFLs. Overall, this initiative will distribute about \n13 million CFLs, free of charge, to residential and other customers of four private utilities and 108 electric cooperatives \nnationwide. This will prepare these customers to more easily adjust to the Government\u2019s proposal to phase out incandescent \nbulbs by 2010. \n \nCustomers in some off-grid areas will be provided with light-emitting diode (LED) lights under a pilot program to evaluate the \nuse of LED lights in place of kerosene, candles, and other nonelectric alternatives. LED is a third-generation lighting system; a \ntypical 9-watt LED light can produce as much light as a 13-watt CFL or a 60-watt incandescent bulb. Good quality LEDs can \noperate between 10,000 and 50,000 hours compared with 8,000 hours for a typical CFL or 800 hours for an ordinary \nincandescent bulb. \n \nThis initiative will increase the environment's carrying capacity to support the country's sustained economic growth, reducing \npoverty in the process. The Philippine Energy Efficiency Project will distribute good quality and reliable power to existing \nconsumers with lower losses. An objective of the Project is to promote energy-efficient bulbs.  \n ", "    Appendix 13     57      \n \nThe Project\u2019s objective in terms of contribution to the sector to reduce poverty was assessed. The Project will not have \nsignificant direct impacts on economic growth and poverty reduction as it will not support new connections. The Project\u2019s \ncontribution in the energy sector will be mainly on energy saving during peak hours. The loss reduction and energy savings \nwill reduce the cost of power generation. Under the demand-side management program, the promotion of CFL lamps through \nbulk purchase and free distribution will help to expand the CFL market and increase revenue for small distributors and small \nretailers in the long term.       \n \nMost of the users of CFL lamps are from higher- and middle-income groups as the cost of a good quality CFL bulb is high. \nHowever, in recent years, more poor households have been using CFL lamps, although they are limited by the cost. Poor \nhouseholds use both CFLs and incandescent lamps, and balance spending on light bulbs with energy consumption. The \nincandescent lamp is much cheaper but consumes more energy. The longevity of incandescent lamp is very low in \ncomparison to a CFL. The CFL lamp lasts 5 times longer than an incandescent lamp. Although the incandescent bulb needs \nto be replaced quite often, poor people prefer to buy them because of their low price. Since no form of certification exists for \nefficiency claims, rural households often become victims of fraud. Most poor people use 5-watt incandescent bulbs, which in \nreality are 20 watts with poor efficiency. Low-quality CFL lamps are also prevalent in the market and targeted to low-income \nand poor households that would be reluctant to buy high-quality and higher priced lamps.  \n \nThe main beneficiary of the Project will be rural households, specifically households on lifeline tariffs, consuming less than \n100 kWh a month. The same households will also learn about other affordable energy-efficient choices for reducing \nhousehold expenditures on energy from the communication and social mobilization component. Remote rural households that \ndepend on kerosene-based lighting will have the opportunity to test LED-based lighting. The public lighting component will \nincrease mobility of these households by increasing net light output in rural areas using less energy overall. \n \n2. Design Features. Households will save up to 80% of their electricity cost on lighting. In addition, the Project will allow \nabout 3.7 million households to switch to CFLs without incurring any additional cost\u2014about P200 by 2010 when the \nGovernment\u2019s proposed phaseout of incandescent bulbs will be implemented. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nCFLs will be distributed to more than 5 million households by 108 electric cooperatives and 4 private distribution utilities. The \naverage consumption of many of these households is below the 100 kWh per month threshold for lifeline customers. For \nexample, a lifeline customer qualifying for a lifeline tariff receives a bill of P360 for consumption of 40 kWh in a month; with the \naverage discount of about 40% for a lifeline customer, the customer will be required to pay about P220.  \n \nIf the electricity consumed by lighting in that household is P200, use of two CFLs will reduce the consumption by more than \nP100 each month. Distribution of high-quality CFL lamps to poor households to replace incandescent lamps would benefit \npoor customers in lower electricity bill, and improved lighting in their houses. This is especially important for children since \nreading and doing homework with low lighting can cause eyestrain and lead to poor eyesight. Reliable and improved \nhousehold lighting would have a positive impact on the household\u2019s economic and social activities in the evening. The savings \nin energy bills might have an impact on the households\u2019 expenditure or savings.  \n \nThe social marketing and community awareness of the energy-efficiency program will be used to develop customer\u2019s \nconfidence in using CFLs through nongovernment organizations, social organizations, television, and radio. The impact of \npromotion of CFLs depends on affordability and effective distribution channels. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \nThe 108  electric cooperatives were consulted on the distribution model for CFLs. Management of the cooperatives gave their \nassurance that they will work closely with local social organizations and the National Electrification Administration to make \ndistribution as effective as possible.  \n \n    \n2.

To promote energy efficiency in the country, the Department of Energy (DOE) with \nassistance  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  proposes  to  implement  a  range  of \nprograms  that  would  reduce  peak  power  demand.  This  will  contribute  to  greenhouse  gas \nreduction. Carbon credits will be sought following the methodology approved by the executive \nboard of the Clean Development Mechanism. The Department of Energy (DOE) will be the \nExecuting Agency. The proposed Project will be implemented over 2 years from April 2009. \n \n2.  The Project will (i) retrofit about 40 government-owned office buildings with efficient \nlighting; (ii) procure 13 million compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) for distribution to residential \nand other customers to reduce peak power demand; (iii) introduce energy-efficient lamps for \npublic lighting; (iv) set up a laboratory for testing energy-efficient appliances and a lamp waste \nmanagement facility; (v) establish a super energy service company (ESCO)  to support ESCO \ndevelopment; (vi) promote an efficient-building initiative; and (vii) develop and implement a \ncommunication and social mobilization program.  \n \n3.  ADB  classifies  the  Project  as  environmental  category  B.  An  initial  environmental \nexamination was prepared consistent with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines (2003). This summary IEE examination focuses on the proposed pilot \nlamp waste management facility and includes descriptions of existing environmental conditions, \nthe  Project,  assessment  of  environmental  impacts,  recommended  mitigation  measures, \nenvironmental monitoring, and public consultation.  \n \nA.  Project Description \n4.  Use of energy-efficient fluorescent lamps will increase significantly, especially in the \nPhilippines.  Since  a  CFL  contains  2\u20135  milligrams  (mg)  of  mercury  and  a  typical  linear \nfluorescent tube lamp (FTL) used commonly in offices and houses contains about 12 mg of \nmercury, safe disposal of spent lamps is a critical issue from a public health and environmental \nperspective. Mercury is known for its high toxicity and its significant adverse impacts on human \nhealth  are  well  documented.  As  in  many  developing  countries,  locals  dispose  of  FTLs  in \nlandfills,  ultimately  polluting  groundwater.  The  implementation  of  the  pilot  lamp  waste \nmanagement  facility  will  address  the  health  and  environmental  issues  through  proper \nawareness, and collection. This will give customers a choice for recycling of mercury in lamps.  \n \n5.  The lamp waste management facility subcomponent will include the collection of spent \nlamps from households, institutions, and business establishments. The pilot facility will have a \ncapacity of processing 6 million lamps per year. For every 1 million lamps, approximately \n900,000 intact glass tubes, 2.2 tons of aluminum, 120 kilograms (kg) of tin, 944 kg of copper, \n360  kg  of  chloride  salts,  and  10  kg  of  mercury  will  be  recovered.  Practically  all  of  the \ncomponents of the spent lamps will be recycled into reusable raw materials. \n \n6.  It will consist of a compact crush and separation plant built into a 20-foot container and a \nmaximum capacity of about 300 kg of tube material per hour, equal to approximately 2,000 \ntubes per hour. The compact crush and separation plant is designed for processing fluorescent \ntubes of various length and shapes. The machine crushes and separates the material into a \nglass fraction, a metal end (end cap) fraction, and a fluorescent powder fraction.  \n \n7.  The facility will be located in one of the existing warehouses of DoloMatrix Philippines \nwithin the Angeles Industrial Park in Calibutbut, Bacolor, Pampanga. The warehouse has a total ", "60  Appendix 14 \narea of 2,520 square meters. The room will be ventilated by fresh air\u2014at least three exchanges \nper hour. The compact crush and separation plant generates negligible amounts of mercury \nconcentration in the room during operation. The maximum concentration of mercury emission in \nthe atmosphere (inside the room) during processing is 0.025 milligrams/cubic meter (mg/m3). \nThe permissible limit set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration1 is 0.05 mg/m3. \nThe process air will be discharged through two series of connected carbon filters. \n \n8.  Recycled materials will be sold as raw materials to various establishments. Transport, \nstorage,  handling,  and  packaging  of  recycled  materials,  mercury  in  particular,  will  be  in \naccordance with the requirements of the Republic Act 6969 (an act to control toxic substances \nand hazardous and nuclear wastes) and the requirements of the occupational safety and health \ncenter of the Department of Labor and Employment.  \n \nB.  Description of the Environment \n9.  The facility will be installed in an existing warehouse surrounded by other warehouses \nwithin the industrial park. The project area and its immediate vicinity are devoid of vegetation \nand wildlife. The nearest residential area is about 500 meters away from the project site. The \nindustrial park is being serviced by the Angeles Electric Power and Theresa Water Works. \n \nC.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n5.  No environmental impact is anticipated during construction since as equipment will be \ninstalled within an existing warehouse. During operation, mercury concentration in the work area \nwill  dependent  on  the  manner  in  which  materials  for  recycling  are  handled  and  how \nmaintenance work on the equipment is executed. Most equipment generates negligible amounts \nof mercury concentration in the room during operation. The process air will be discharged \nthrough  two  series  of carbon  filters.  Filters  will  be  subjected  to  retorting2 or  treated  using \ndolocrete technology.3 The materials to be processed should be dry, clean, and stored indoors \nprior to the process. The equipment instructions for plant operation must always be followed. \n \n6.  No significant volume of wastewater will be generated since the retorting process is \nsomewhat similar to distillation processes where water is only used for cooling. Cooling water \nwill be recycled back into the process. \n \n7.  Applicable provisions of the Republic Act 6969 and requirements of the occupational \nhealth and safety center will be implemented. Appropriate protective equipment will be provided \nfor  personnel  and  good  housekeeping  will  be  observed  through  implementation  of  the  5S \nmethodology.4 Only trained staff will be allowed to operate the equipment. The operator will \nensure annual medical checkups of staff as well as testing for blood mercury levels.  \n \nD.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n8.  For  the  lamp  waste  management  component,  a  working  group  will  be  established \ncomprising DOE (chair) and a representative from key stakeholders such as the Environmental \n                                                 \n1  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration is an agency of the United States Department of Labor. \n2  Retorting is a process which makes use of an airtight vessel in which substances are heated for a chemical \nreaction to produce gaseous products that can be collected for other uses or for further processing. \n3  Dolocrete technology is an innovative waste treatment technology that binds toxic and hazardous wastes into a \npseudomineral matrix, which stabilizes the contaminant species and prevents its release into the environment.  \n4  5S is a methodology for efficiently organizing and managing the work space and work flow.  \n ", "                                                                                                       Appendix 14  61 \nManagement Board, Department of Environment and Natural Resources, local government \nunits, nongovernment organizations, private sector, and waste management operators. DOE, as \nthe  interim  owner  of  the  lamp  waste  management  facility,  will  obtain  the  necessary \nenvironmental  permits  and  clearances  from  the  Department  of  Environment  and  Natural \nResources and the Environmental Management Board prior to project implementation. The \nPMU  will  conduct  semiannual  monitoring  of  the  operator\u2019s  implementation  of  mitigation \nmeasures. \n \n9.  A  consultant  expert  in  lamp  waste  management,  energy-efficiency  standards,  and \nlabeling will assist DOE in preparing specifications, and prequalification and tender documents. \nThe bidding documents will specify, among others, that the lamp waste management facility will \nmeet the highest international technical and environmental standards. \n \n10.  The pilot facility will be implemented under a turnkey arrangement including supply, \nshipping, installation, commissioning, operator training, and regular maintenance. The supplier \nof the facility will operate the lamp waste management facility for 2 years under DOE direction. \nThe operator, under the supervision of DOE, will conduct indoor air quality monitoring and \nanalytical testing of the glass and aluminum end caps to ensure that mercury levels are within \napplicable standards. The cost for environmental monitoring during operation is included in the \nproject budget. \n \nE.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n11.  A  public  consultation,  involving  20  representatives  of  the  local  government  unit, \nnongovernment organization, DoloMatrix Philippines, Philippine Economic Zone Authority, and \nDOE, was conducted on 3 July 2008 at the Angeles Industrial Park. Details of the pilot lamp \nwaste management facility, its potential impacts and mitigation measures were presented by \nDOE. The participants raised issues related to the safety and health of the community, and the \nenvironmental  compliance  and  safety  aspects  of  the  equipment.  DOE  and  DoloMatrix \nPhilippines addressed these issues and elaborated on equipment specifications and procedures \nor systems to be implemented during its operation.  \n \nF.  Conclusions \n17.  The Project will result in reduced costs for energy production. With reduced electricity \ndemand,  the  overall  need  for  supply  (generation)  will  be  reduced  and  a  large  amount  of \ngreenhouse gas emissions\u2014and the associated cost of importing fuel\u2014will be avoided, creating \ncarbon credits for the Project under the Clean Development Mechanism. \n \n18.  The lamp waste management facility subcomponent, in particular, will enable consumers \nto dispose of FTLs without damaging the environment. The disposal of spent CFLs and FTLs in \nlandfills is among the primary sources of mercury pollution that could migrate to groundwater \nand could become airborne. Recovered materials through the recycling facility will also reduce \nthe need for the production of raw materials.  \n \n19.  The predicted environmental impacts of the lamp waste management facility have been \nidentified  and  appropriate  mitigation  measures  are  included  in  this  initial  environmental \nexamination. Responsibilities for implementation and monitoring of mitigation measures and the \nmonitoring plan are defined clearly. The need for further environmental study is deemed not \nnecessary. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20090108142330+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "rrp: phi 42001, philippines, philippines energy efficiency projects, energy efficiency projects, philippines energy development projects", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0.5 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20090130143442+08'00'", "Title": "Philippine Energy Efficiency Project"}}
