Almost  70%  of  the \npopulation lives in rural areas, in a largely mountainous territory where only 10% of the land is \nsuitable for cultivation. The road transport sector suffers from low quality, long travel times, and \npoor reliability. Four CAREC regional corridors (2, 3, 5, and 6) cross parts of Tajikistan, offering \nthe opportunity for Tajikistan to enhance its connectivity and trade competitiveness. \n \n4. \nThe  government  has  requested  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  assistance  to \nprogressively upgrade the 82 km Dushanbe\u2013Kurgonteppa road, for which ADB has programmed \ntwo  projects:  one  in  2016  (current  project)  and  one  in  2018  (proposed  additional  financing).4 \nThe road is a strategic north\u2013south link, and one of the most heavily traveled roads in the country, \nas well as the confluence of CAREC corridors 2, 5, and 6. The project road passes through terrain \nthat varies from flat to mountainous. A further 90 km beyond Kurgonteppa, connects Dushanbe \nto  Afghanistan.  The  government  has  also  requested  ADB  assistance  through  the  project  to \nimprove several short sections of the national highway network that have substantial road safety-\nrelated deficiencies. \n \n5. \nCurrent project. The current project that is improving 33 km of the road from Dushanbe \nto  Chashmasoron  was  approved  on  31  October  2016,  with  a  combined  loan,  grant,  and \nadministration of a grant of $67.2 million equivalent. The ADB loan and grants were signed on \n15 November 2017 and declared effective on 26 May 2017, with a closing date of 30 September \n2021. In addition, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries Fund for International \nDevelopment (OFID) provided a $12 million loan for the current project, which is not administered \nby ADB. The OFID loan is effective and also has a closing date of 30 September 2021. \n \n\n                                                \n1  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2016.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors: \nProposed  Loan,  Grant,  and  Administration  of  Grant  to  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  for  the  Central  Asia  Regional \nEconomic Cooperation Corridors 2, 5, and 6 (Dushanbe\u2013Kurgonteppa) Road Project. Manila. \n\n2  Kurgonteppa was renamed Bokhtar in January 2018. \n3  ADB  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  the  CAREC  Corridors  2,  5,  and  6  Road  (Dushanbe\u2013\n\nKurgonteppa) Project (TA 8945-TAJ). \n\n4  ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: Tajikistan, 2018\u20132020. Manila. \n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n6. \nThe current project is rated on track to deliver its expected outputs and meet its intended \noutcome,  with  cumulative  contract  awards  amounting  to  $42.3  million  (61%  of  total  loan  and \ngrants  financing)  and  cumulative  disbursements  amounting  to  $6.3  million  (9%)  against  an \nelapsed time of 26% as of 13 February 2018. Disbursements will increase by the end of 2018, as \nhigh-value pavement works will have commenced by that time.5 \n \n7. \nThe  project  management  and  contract  supervision  consultant  (PMCSC)  contract  was \nawarded  on  28  June  2017  and  the  civil  works  contract  was  awarded  on  28  September  2017. \nThe  PMCSC  was  mobilized  in  August  2017  and  the  civil  works  contractor  was  mobilized  in \nOctober 2017. The works commenced in November 2017 and are expected to be completed by \nOctober  2020.  The  resettlement  plan  has  been  fully  implemented  and  the  environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP)  is  being  implemented  without  major  issues.  A  grievance  redress \nmechanism  was  established  and  there  are  currently  no  unresolved  grievances  or  complaints. \n(output  1).  Capacity  building  activities  on  financial  management,  road  safety,  and  road  asset \nmanagement are progressing as planned (output 2). The current project, through the PMCSC\u2019s \nsupport, has contributed to substantially improving the readiness of the additional financing, which \nwill  help  synchronize  the  award  of  the  PMCSC  and  main  civil  works  contracts  with  the \neffectiveness of ADB-provided financing (output 3). The risks identified during project preparation \nare being adequately managed with the PMCSC\u2019s assistance. \n \nProposed additional financing. Additional financing is sought to scale up the project by \n8. \nimproving a contiguous 40 km road section (Chashmasoron\u2013Kurgonteppa) to the current project\u2019s \n33 km road section. It is expected that the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) will \nhelp finance, through collaborative parallel financing, the remaining 9 km section in Kurgonteppa \nto complete the project road improvement. The additional financing will also support the MOT\u2019s \nprogram to improve the road safety situation on selected priority sections of the national highway \nnetwork,  which  may  include  existing  tunnels,  intersections,  black  spots,  and  failed  lengths  of \npavement. \n \n9. \nThe  proposed  additional  financing  will  continue  strengthening  the  MOT\u2019s  capacity  on \nfinancial management, road safety, and road asset management. The MOT will revisit and update \nits  current  standard  technical  specifications,  which  follow  the  highway  construction  standards \n(1998), to improve quality of bidding documents for typical road rehabilitation projects. The MOT \nwill also inventory and geo-reference the main bridges on the national highway network to build \nup the bridge module of the road asset management system, which is being developed with the \nWorld Bank\u2019s assistance.6 \n \n10. \nSuitability  of  additional  financing.  The  proposed  additional  financing  meets  the \neligibility  criteria  for  additional  financing,  as  the  overall  project  is  (i)  technically  feasible, \neconomically viable, and financially sound based on the due diligence carried out; (ii) accorded \nhigh priority by the government as reflected by its inclusion in the National Development Strategy;7 \n(iii) consistent with the transport development objectives of the current project, as it will enhance \nthe outcome and outputs of the current project; and (iv) consistent with the country partnership \nstrategy,  2016\u20132020  for  Tajikistan,  which  aims  to  improve  physical  connectivity  and  enhance \nregional  integration. 8 Given  the  strong  links  with  the  original  project  in  terms  of  design  and \n                                                \n5  Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  World Bank. 2015.

Dushanbe. \n\n \n\n\fimplementation  arrangements,  the  additional  financing  will  offer  substantial  efficiency  gains  in \nproject processing and help meet the project outcome in a timely manner.  \n \n11. \nValue added by ADB assistance. The current project enabled the introduction of clean \nenergy  technology,  in  the  form  of  solar-based  LED  road  lighting  and  enhanced  road  safety \nfacilities, such as traffic calming and speed reduction elements, and much improved edge of road \ndrainage  and  protection  features.  These  are  essential  and  comply  with  current  international \npractice.  They  would  not  have  been  incorporated  without  ADB  assistance.  The  proposed \nadditional  financing  will  scale  up  these  design  elements  to  the  entire  project  road  (73  km). \nThe  use  of  high-level  technologies  to  inventory  the  main  highway  bridges,  which  may  include \ndrone-based inspections and cloud database systems, will also be explored. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n12. \nThe  overall  aggregate  impact  of  the  project  will  remain  unchanged  as  a  result  of  the \nadditional financing. The overall project will be aligned with the following impacts: (i) the strategic \npillar on promotion of economic growth of the Tajikistan National Development Strategy (footnote \n7),  and  (ii)  CAREC\u2019s  strategic  goal  of  establishing  competitive  corridors  across  the  CAREC \nregion.9 The overall aggregate outcome will be improved efficiency and safer movement of goods \nand people on selected sections of the Dushanbe\u2013Kurgonteppa road, and improved safety on the \nnational highway network.10 \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe proposed additional financing will enable expansion of existing outputs and include a \n13. \nnew output to address safety deficiencies on the national highway network. The overall aggregate \noutputs will be (i) improved road conditions, facilities, and safety along, and in the vicinity of, the \nproject  road  (expanded);  (ii)  strengthened  institutional  capacity  of  the  MOT  regarding  financial \nmanagement, road safety, and road asset management (expanded); (iii) completed procurement \nreadiness  for  the  Chashmasoron\u2013Kurgonteppa  road  section  (unchanged);  and  (iv)  improved \nsafety on selected priority sections of the national highway network (added). \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n14. \n\nThe overall project is estimated to cost $203.9 million (Table 1). \n\n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\n1.

Present  traffic  volumes  range  from  approximately  7,000  to  9,000 \nvehicles  per  day.  As  with  the  current  project,  the  civil  works  under  the  proposed  additional \nfinancing will consist of (i) expanding the road width from two to four lanes to address projected \ncapacity  constraints,  (ii)  improving  the  road  surface  condition  through  construction  of  new \npavements,  and  (iii)  providing  well-designed  safety  facilities  to  address  existing  road  safety \ndeficiencies. \n \nThe  completed  road  will  have  two  carriageways,  each  with  two  traffic  lanes  typically \n24. \n3.5 meters wide, separated by a median typically 2.0 meters wide in rural areas and narrower \nwhere the road passes through villages and difficult mountain terrain. The project road alignment \nwill  follow  the  existing  road  alignment  because  of  terrain  considerations  and  to  minimize  land \nacquisition,  with  some  adjustments  to  horizontal  and  vertical  alignments  to  meet  the  required \nstandards. The design speed will typically be 100 km per hour, which is appropriate for a road of \nthis class in the terrain through which it passes. \n \n25. \nThe  completed  road  will  have  a  flexible  pavement  with  asphaltic  concrete  surfacing. \nThe pavement structure has been designed using appropriate design methods based on the traffic \nprojected  to  use  the  road  over  a  20-year  period  (2021\u20132040)  following  project  completion, \nassuming  one  asphaltic  concrete  overlay  during  this  period  to  provide  the  additional  strength \nrequired for traffic loading for the latter part of the road\u2019s service life. The road design takes into \naccount  the  severe  weather  conditions  that  the  road  will  experience,  which  range  from  high \ntemperatures in summer to below freezing temperatures and heavy snowfall in winter. Adverse \nweather  events  beyond  projected  parameters  may  however  be  a  risk  that  could  delay \nconstruction. \n \n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fRelevant disaster risks and climate change adaptation measures have also been factored \n26. \ninto  the  design,  which  are  estimated  to  cost  $900,000.  The  road  design  meets  internationally \naccepted standards and practices in terms of road safety, which have been introduced and piloted \nthrough  the  current  project.  The  design  will  be  subjected  to  detailed  road  safety  audits  before \nconstruction  commences,  during  construction,  and  prior  to  final  acceptance  of  the  completed \nroad. The road safety audits will be conducted in close coordination with the traffic police. The \nroad design also reflects consultations with communities living adjacent to the road, which have \nresulted in the inclusion in the project road\u2019s design of several underpasses for people, livestock, \nand agriculture, as well as pedestrian crossings with appropriate warning devices. The smaller \nsafety-related works will be designed in accordance with the same standards as the project road \ndesign.  \n \nThis  technical  due  diligence  has  confirmed  that  the  project  road\u2019s  technical  design, \n27. \nalignment,  cross-section,  drainage  structures,  pavements,  and  road  safety  provisions  are \nappropriate for a road of this standard in this location, and for the volume of traffic that is projected \nto use it. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n28. \nEconomic viability.  The economic  evaluation  of the  project  was undertaken  using the \nhighway development and management model, and following ADB guidelines.13 For the economic \nanalysis, the with-project scenario assumed the improvement of the 39.6 km road section from \nChashmasoron  to  Kurgonteppa.  Without  the  project,  the  road  is  expected  to  deteriorate  to  an \naverage international roughness index value of 9 within about 7 years, rendering it in very poor \ncondition. Future traffic was estimated based on classified traffic counts conducted in 2016 and \n2017, and available gross domestic product growth forecasts. The project is economically viable \nwith an estimated economic internal rate of return of  15.4%, with a net present value of $20.1 \nmillion at a 12% discount rate. The principal quantifiable benefits are reduced vehicle operating \ncosts, reduced travel time, and reduced maintenance costs. Sensitivity tests confirmed that the \neconomic  viability  of  the  project  is  robust  against  project  cost  increases  of  up  to  34%  and \ndecreases in vehicle operating costs savings of up to 27%. \n \nFinancial sustainability. The project is nonrevenue generating. The design of the project \n29. \nroad pavement and structures has been carefully developed with a view to ensuring the road\u2019s \nlong-term  sustainability.  The  project  will  support  the  development  of  a  tailored  road  asset \nmanagement system in close coordination with other development partners (e.g., the European \nBank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  JICA,  and  the  World  Bank),  all  of  which  have \noperations that involve some forms of operation and maintenance. The government is committed \nto  maintaining  the  project  road  and facilities  at  the  required  standard  as  reflected  in  the  grant \nagreement.14 The  financial  analysis  concluded  that  the  MOT  has  sufficient  financial  capacity, \nwithin the  government\u2019s budgetary  procedures, to meet recurrent  expenditures  to  operate  and \nmaintain the project road in a sustainable manner. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n30. \nFinancial management. The proposed additional financing does not entail any changes \nin the existing financial management arrangements. Financial management functions under the \nproposed additional financing will remain the  responsibility of the PIURR,  as under the current \n\n                                                \n13 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2); ADB. 2017. Guidelines \n\nfor the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n14 Grant Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fproject. The original financial management assessment concluded that the financial management \nrisk of the implementing agency is substantial, which remains relevant for the overall project. The \nPMCSC  team for the  current  project  includes an  international financial  management  specialist \nand a national financial management specialist who will both assist the PIURR in implementing \nkey  actions  and  measures  to  address  the  deficiencies  identified  in  the  financial  management \nassessment.  The  MOT  and  PIURR  will  maintain  adequate  and  separate  project  records  and \naccounts, which will be audited annually by an independent auditor. \n \nProcurement. The procurement classification for the current project (category B) remains \n31. \nrelevant  for  the  overall  project  since  procurement  arrangements  will  not  be  changed. \nThe  MOT  and  PIURR  have  an  adequate  understanding  of  ADB\u2019s  procurement  and  financial \nmanagement  policies  and  procedures  as  a  result  of  the  sizeable  portfolio  of  ADB-supported \ntransport  operations  in  Tajikistan.  The  PMCSC  team  for  the  current  project  includes  an \ninternational procurement specialist who will assist the PIURR with procurement of contracts for \nthe proposed additional financing, including for small road safety works. \n \nADB\u2019s  Integrity  Principles  and  Guidelines  and  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \n32. \namended  to  date)  were  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government,  the  MOT,  and  the \nPIURR.15 The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the \nproject administration manual (footnote 12). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n33. \nThe  project  will  directly  benefit  residents  in  Dushanbe,  Kurgonteppa,  and  19  villages \nlocated along the project road by improving access to jobs, markets, and public services while \nreducing the likelihood and severity of road collisions. The project will also enhance the reliability \nand efficiency of power solutions along the project road by introducing solar-based street lighting \nand power backup systems for communities living adjacent to the project road. Socioeconomic \nsurveys  were  carried  out  for  project  preparation  and  a  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social \nstrategy was prepared.16 \n \n34. \nThe  gender  categorization  for  the  current  project  (some  gender  elements)  remains \nrelevant for the overall project since the additional financing is essentially scaling up the project \nfollowing the  same  project  design  elements. The  current  project  design  already  addresses the \ngender issues identified during the project preparation, which include increasing safety features, \nenhancing connectivity of villages (pedestrian crossings and livestock underpasses), constructing \nbus  stops,  improving rest  areas  and road bazaars,  and promoting  confidence in the  new  road \nconfiguration  through road  safety  awareness training  and  workshops.  The  current  project  also \ncontributes to reducing women\u2019s household drudgery with improved access to electricity through \nthe installation of power backup solutions. The MOT and PIURR are taking all necessary actions \nto encourage women living in the project area to participate in planning and implementing project \nactivities in line with ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998). \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nInvoluntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  A  for  involuntary \n35. \nresettlement impacts. The census carried out during project preparation identified approximately \n246  affected  households\u2014including  private  agriculture  plots,  owners  and  users  of  land  and \nbuildings, business owners, renters, and employees\u2014with 1,956 household members affected. \nOf the 246 affected households, 92 households with 766 members will experience severe impacts \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2015. Integrity Principles and Guidelines. Manila. \n16 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fon  their  livelihood  and  66  households  with  632  members  were  found  to  belong  to  vulnerable \ngroups.  A  total  of  18  residential  buildings  and  39  main  business  buildings  will  be  permanently \nimpacted. The small road safety-related works will not have impacts on resettlement. \n \nA  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  (LARP)  has  been  prepared  to  mitigate  and \n36. \naddress all the associated losses in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and \nrelevant  national  legislation.17 The  LARP  was  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  in  January  2018. \nConsultations with the project stakeholders and displaced persons were undertaken during LARP \npreparation and will continue throughout implementation. If modification of the LARP is required, \nor additional land requirement or involuntary resettlement impacts are identified, the LARP will be \nupdated in accordance with applicable laws, and ADB approval will be obtained prior to any further \nimplementation.  All  displaced  people  will  receive  compensation  in  accordance  with  the  LARP \nprovisions. The land required for the project will be made free of encumbrances in sections prior \nto commencement of construction. A grievance redress mechanism is in place in accordance with \nthe LARP to assist affected persons in resolving grievances and complaints. The MOT will submit \nsemiannual safeguards monitoring reports to ADB for review and disclosure. \n \n37. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environmental  impacts. \nThe environmental assessment established that the project will have site-specific environmental \nimpacts related to air and water pollution, noise and vibration, soil erosion, loss of roadside trees, \nrelocation of utilities, and traffic disruption during the construction stage. Additionally, it was found \nthat the project could result in split communities, disruption of farming patterns, and loss of access \nto roadside businesses during road operation. \n \n38. \nAn initial environmental examination and an EMP have been prepared for the project and \nwere  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  in  January  2017,  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement.18 Public consultations were conducted during initial environmental examination \npreparation  involving  people  from  roadside  villages,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  other \nproject  stakeholders.  Adequate  mitigation  measures  are  included  in,  and  will  be  implemented \nthrough, the EMP. The project design incorporates measures for preserving community cohesion \nsuch as improved road crossings, access to public facilities, and access of agricultural machinery \nto fields and  livestock to  pastures.  The  cost for  implementing the EMP  will  be financed  by  the \nproject  through  the  civil  works  contract  (mitigation  measures)  and  the  PMCSC\u2019s  contract \n(environmental monitoring). \n \n39. \nIndigenous peoples. There are no indigenous peoples, as defined in the ADB Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement,  in  the  project  area,  and  thus  the  project  is  classified  as  category  C  for \nindigenous peoples\u2019 impacts. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n40.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.19 The project risks are considered manageable \nthrough  the  prescribed  mitigating  measures.  Integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to \noutweigh the costs. \n \n\n                                                \n17 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nInadequate financial monitoring \nand reporting systems \n\nInsufficient allocation of funds to \nmaintain the project road and \nfacilities \n\nInadequate attention given to \nroad safety on the project road \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe  PMCSC  team  for  the  current  project  includes  an  international  financial \nmanagement specialist and a national financial management specialist who will \nboth support the PIURR in reviewing and strengthening its financial reporting \nand  monitoring  system  by  providing  adequate  tools  and  on-the-job  training \nduring project implementation. \nThe government and ADB have agreed on a covenant to ensure that the project \nroad and facilities will receive timely and adequate maintenance. A road asset \nmanagement system is being developed with World Bank assistance to assist \nthe MOT in prioritizing its maintenance and financing programs.a \nThe  government  and  ADB  have  agreed  on  a  covenant  to  ensure  that \nrecommendations  identified  in  project  road  safety  audits  are  effectively \nimplemented by the works contractor and monitored by the PIURR with PMCSC \nassistance.
