The Government  of  Timor-Leste will  construct  a new  international \nport at Tibar west of Dili, which is currently served by a road included in the scope of the original \nproject.  To  provide  sufficient  capacity,  5.0  kilometers  (km)  of  the  road  will  be  designed  and \nconstructed to a significantly higher standard than originally envisaged. The additional financing \nwill also help finance cost overruns in the original project arising from civil works costs that were \nhigher than expected. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nIn  2011,  the  government  published  its  strategic  development  plan  (SDP),  2011\u20132030, \nwhich  aims  to  sustain  economic  growth  and  fast-track  economic  development  to  achieve  a \nmodern  and  diversified  economy  with  high-quality  infrastructure. 1 The  SDP  envisages  three \npillars  for  development:  social  capital  development,  infrastructure  development,  and  economic \ndevelopment. Public investment (including roads) over the first 5 years of the SDP is intended to \ncreate  the  conditions  to  attract  private  investment  and  ensure  that  the  economy  is  led  by  the \nprivate sector by 2030. An efficient and safe transport system is essential to achieving the three \ndevelopmental  pillars.  The  SDP  and  the  operational  plans  of  the  government  emphasize  the \nupgrading of roads. \n \nSince 1999, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been the lead development agency \n4. \nin the road subsector, for which it has provided six technical assistance projects, three project \ngrants, one sector grant, and two loans. The country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 continues \nADB\u2019s  strategic  directions  by  concentrating  on  infrastructure  development  and  management. \nADB plans to provide complementary assistance in the core specializations of finance, regional \ncooperation and integration, and education. 2 ADB will also support the private sector as a key \ndriver  of  change  to  help  make  the  transition  from  an  economy  led  by  the  public  sector.3 ADB \nsupport  for  infrastructure,  financial  services,  and  skills  training  will  help  meet  the  needs  of  a \ngrowing  economy.  An  emphasis  on  the  provision  of  services  outside  the  capital  will  support \ngrowth of the rural economy. Poverty will be reduced, particularly in rural areas, by connecting \nthe poor to markets and expanding the availability of basic public services.  \n \nThe original project was approved in March 2012, and became effective in June 2012. 4 \n5. \nThe  original  project  intended  to  (i)  reconstruct  or  upgrade  and  climate  proof  about  59  km  of \nprincipal  national  roads,  (ii)  expand  the  road  maintenance  program  of  the  Ministry  of  Public \nWorks  (MPW),  and  (iii)  complete  a  feasibility  study  and  detailed  design  for  81  km  of  principal \n\n                                                \n1   Government of Timor-Leste. 2011.

The executing agency is the Council for the Administration of the Infrastructure \nFund (CAFI) through its Major Projects Secretariat, and the implementing agency is the MPW. 5 \n \n6. \nThe  original  project  includes  a  component  for  upgrading  the  existing  road  between  Dili \nand  Liquica.  This  responded  directly  to  the  SDP  which  envisages  completion  of  this  28  km \nsection by 2015. The road is part of the north coast road linking Dili with the Indonesian border \nat Mota Ain and with the western towns of Maliana and Bobonaro. The component is intended \nto facilitate  increased  and  more  efficient  movement  of people and goods  between the  districts \nand the capital as well as cross-border trade with Indonesia. \n \n7. \nThe  government  has  confirmed  its  intention  to  relocate  the  international  port  in  Dili  to \nTibar  with  operations  envisaged  to  commence  by  2018.  Tibar  is  situated  on  the  Dili\u2013Liquica \nroad,  the  upgrading  of  which  is  included  in  the  project.  There  has  been  substantial  growth  in \nfreight  volumes  through  Dili  port  and  it  is  expected  to  reach  its  capacity  by  2015.  Accelerated \nconstruction and operation of a new port under a public\u2013private partnership is now planned. The \ncurrent  project  scope  includes  only  rehabilitation  between  Dili  and  Tibar  following  the  existing \nroad.  However,  the  winding  alignment,  coastal  exposure,  and  areas  of  hillside  instability  will \nbecome  a  constraint  on  future  upgrading,  which  will  be  required  in  light  of  the  planned  port \ndevelopment. \n \nA reassessment of the scope of the original component has been undertaken. In addition \n8. \nto the traffic  now  expected  to  be generated  by the  port  development,  the reassessment found \nthat  there  had  been  higher-than-expected  growth  in  the  base  traffic,  averaging  19%  per  year \nsince  2009.  This  growth  is  attributable  to  population  growth  in  the  immediate  area  of  8%  per \nannum  and  development  of  business  (particularly  warehousing)  in  Tibar.  The  reassessment \nfound  that  a  road  of  significantly  higher  geometric  standard  than  that  currently  included  in  the \nproject  scope  is  required.  A  dual  carriageway,  5.0  km  long  (partly  on  a  new  alignment),  has \nbeen  found  to  be  feasible  as  a  long-term  solution.  It  will  improve  the  alignment  and  avoid  the \ncoastal and unstable areas. It will also shorten the distance between Dili and the new port by 2 \nkm  (see  map).  The  construction  cost  is  estimated  to  be  significantly  higher  than  the  cost  of \nconstruction of the originally envisaged scope. However, economic and financial analysis shows \nthe  changed  project  to  be  viable,  with  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  27.3%.  The \ngovernment  has  requested  additional  financing  to  finance  additional  costs  arising  from  the \nchanged scope as the proposed changes can readily be implemented under the existing project \narrangements. \n \nIn  addition,  bids  received  for  civil  works  under  the  original  project  were  approximately \n9. \n30%  higher  than  anticipated  and  the  additional  cost  cannot  be  fully  met  by  the  contingency \namount  included  in  the  original  financing  plan.  The  components  continue  to  be  economically \nviable  and  are  high government  priorities.  The  government  has  therefore  requested  additional \nfinancing to also help finance this cost overrun. \n \n10. \nRegarding the performance of the project to date, procurement of civil works (output 1) \nhas  suffered  delay  because  of  capacity  constraints  in  the  National  Procurement  Commission \n(NPC),  which  is  responsible  for  managing  all  major  public  procurement.  A  newly  established \nbody with responsibility for final endorsement of government contracts (the Audit Court) caused \ndelays  in  meeting  contractual  conditions  precedent  to  commencement  of  work.  Progress  on \noutput  1  was  14  months  behind  schedule  by  the  time  construction  commenced  in  November \n2013.  Disbursement  performance  in  2013  was  therefore  significantly  affected  and  behind  the \noriginal projections ($4.7 million versus $17.0 million projected as of February 2014). Revisions \n\n                                                \n5   The MPW is the successor to the Ministry of Infrastructure. \n\n \n\n\fto  the  disbursement  forecast  have  been  made  based  on  the  status  of  disbursements  in \nFebruary  2014,  and  disbursements  since  then  have  been  satisfactory.  However,  the  original \nproject  is  considered  to  be  not  performing  well  because  the  original  disbursement  projections \nwere  not  met  in the  12-month  period  preceding cross-departmental  review  of this  proposal for \nadditional financing.6 \n \n  \n11. \nA  contract  for  the  supervision  of  construction  of  the  two  roads  and  for  the  design  of  a \nfurther  81 km  of  road  was  procured  and  awarded  without  significant  delay  by  December  2012 \nand  work  commenced  in  January  2013.  The  consulting  firm  has  performed  satisfactorily  and \ncompleted  the  required  feasibility  study  and  detailed  engineering  design  (output  2)  by  August \n2013. This has supported processing of subsequent ADB loans.7  \n \nThe  delays  may  be  ascribed  to  a  learning  period  within  the  various  government \n12. \nagencies,  as  new  processes  are  bedded  into  government  systems  and  capacity  to  use  the \nsystems effectively is improved. Recent experience is that the NPC is competent and is steadily \nreducing  the  time  required  to  conduct  bid  processes. 8  The  Audit  Court  must  now  review \ngovernment  contracts  within  30  days.  Works  contracts  under  the  original  project  are  now \nproceeding satisfactorily and are expected to be completed by end of 2015. There is no current \nimpediment  to  achieving  the  project  outputs.  Successful  completion  of  civil  works  is  the  key \nfactor  in  achieving  the  project  outcome.  Compliance  with  safeguards  is  satisfactory.  Project \nperformance  and  associated  issues  are  described  in  more  detail  in  the  summary  of  project \nperformance.9 \n \nThe  changed  project  meets  all  eligibility  criteria  for  additional  financing.10 The  project \n13. \nremains  technically  feasible,  economically  viable,  and  financially  sound  and  infrastructure \ndevelopment, including upgrading of roads and construction of a new port, are high government \npriorities.  The  changed  project  remains  consistent  with  the  development  objectives  of  the \noriginal  project  and  is  consistent  with  the  current  country  partnership  strategy.  The  existing \nproject implementation arrangements remain satisfactory (though some additional resources are \nrequired)  and  an  extension  of  the  existing  loans  of  only  1  year  is  needed  to  accommodate \naccrued delays and the changed scope of work. All components are being executed within the \nsame geographical area, therefore arrangements for construction supervision can be extended \nto the changed project. The safeguards categorization of the project is unchanged.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe impact of the project will be increased and more efficient movement of people and \n14. \ngoods. The outcome will be that the MPW provides a more reliable and safer road network. The \nimpact  and  outcome  are  unchanged  by  the  changed  output.  New  performance  targets  for  the \nchanged  output  (the road  section  connecting  Dili  to the  new  international  port)  are included  in \nthe revised design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1).  \n \n\n                                                \n6   ADB. 2011.

All \n\n15. \noutputs with the exception of output 1 are unchanged: \n\n(i)  Output 1: National roads will be upgraded and climate proofed. Upgrading of \nthe roads from Dili to Liquica (28.6 km) and Tibar to Gleno (31.0 km) are original \ncomponents  of  Output  1.  The  Dili  to  Liquica  components  will  be  changed  from \nupgrading of the road from Dili airport road junction to Liquica to upgrading of the \nroad from Tacitolu to Liquica. The changed component will therefore comprise: (i) \nrealignment  and  upgrading  to  four  lanes  from  Taciltolu  to  the  junction  with  the \nTibar  to  Gleno  road  including  construction  of  a  roundabout  at  this  junction  (3.2 \nkm),  (ii)  upgrading  to  four  lanes  from  the  roundabout  to  Tibar  Port  entrance  (2 \nkm)  including  provision  for  port  access  and  (iii)  widening  to  6  meters  (m)  and \nstrengthening  of  the  road  from  Tibar  Port  entrance  to  Liquica  (19.1  km).  The \nTibar  to  Gleno  component  which  commences  at  the  junction  with  the  above \ncomponent  will  be  unchanged  from  its  present  strengthening  and  widening \nexisting sealed pavements from a width of generally less than 4.5 m to 6 m with \nasphalt surfacing. Vulnerability to damage from severe rainfall, sea level rise, and \nother  potential  effects  of  climate  change  for  all  roads  will  be  reduced  through \nengineering  counter-measures, \nincluding  ensuring  suitably-sized  drainage \nstructures,  raising  of  road  levels  that  are  flood-prone,  and  bio-engineering  to \npromote slope stability. \nOutput  2:  A  feasibility  study  and  detailed  design  will  be  prepared.  A \nfeasibility  study  and  detailed  design  suitable for  ADB  financing  will  be  prepared \nfor the road from Manatuto to Natarbora (81.0 km). The additional loan will help \nfinance  the  detailed  design  of  the  road  from  Comoro  roundabout  to  Tibar  Port \nentrance. \nOutput 3: Performance-based road maintenance will be introduced. The civil \nworks  contractors  will  be  responsible  for  maintenance  of  the  upgraded  road \nsections for 2 years after physical completion. Local contractors will be trained in \nperformance maintenance, and period performance-based contracts will be used \nfor future maintenance. \nOutput 4: Awareness of road safety and transport-related social issues will \nbe  raised.  The  awareness  of  road  safety  will  be  increased  by  implementing  a \ncommunity-based  road  safety  awareness  program,  including  an  education \nprogram for schools, drivers, road users, and the community, and implementing \nan HIV/AIDS prevention and a human trafficking awareness program. \nOutput  5:  Efficient  project  management  will  be  provided.  The  project \nincludes  project  management  support  for  the  implementing  agency  through \nstrengthening of its project management unit (PMU). \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\n \nD. \n \n16. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  project  after  additional  financing  is  estimated  to  be  $79.88  million \n(Table  1). 11 Collaborative  cofinancing  from  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  for \n$93.0 million is excluded from Tables 1 and 2 for clarity.12  \n\n                                                \n11 The additional financing will be for the upgrading and construction supervision of the road from  Tasitolu to Tibar, \ncost overruns for the Tibar to Liquica and Tibar to Gleno components, and strengthening the capacity of the PMU \nand government agencies for land acquisition and resettlement. \n\n12  The  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  has  provided  a  loan  to  the  Government  of  Timor-Leste  for  the \nupgrading  of  the  road  from  Dili  to  Baucau,  and  this  was  included  as  collaborative  financing  in  the  original.

The  PMU  is  headed  by  a project  manager \nand staffed with key professionals on a full-time basis, including a chief technical advisor, road \nconstruction  advisor,  road  maintenance  engineer,  and  financial  administrator.  Supplementary \nstaff have been recruited to the PMU and financed under the original project, and also under the \nADB-financed Road Network Upgrading Sector Project (footnote 7). The supplementary staff of \ninternational and national specialists provide for a full-time safeguards unit within the PMU. The \nPMU  will  continue  to  be  responsible  for  financial  management  and  preparing  withdrawal \napplications. The existing Road Network Upgrading Project design and supervision consultant is \nresponsible for construction supervision of the Tibar to Liquica and Tibar to Gleno components \n(under its existing contract) and for the additional Tasitolu to Tibar component (under a contract \nvariation).  \n \n20.  While  the  day-to-day  management  of  the  project  will  be  undertaken  by  the  PMU,  the \ngovernment\u2019s  National  Development  Agency  will  review  quality,  costs,  and  payments  in \naccordance with the government\u2019s internal procedures. While the PMU, assisted by the design \nand  supervision  consultants,  will  prepare  draft  bidding  documents  for  procurement  of  the \nadditional component, the NPC will be responsible for conducting the bidding process, including \nbid evaluation. \n \n21. \nTable 3 and described in detail in the project administration manual.14 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe implementation arrangements, updated for the changed project, are summarized in \n\n                                                \n14  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n\n(ii)   Executing agency  \n(iii)  Key implementing agency \n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \n\nDisbursement  \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nMarch 2012\u2013December 2017 (extended by 12 months) \n31 December 2017   \n\nCAFI  \nPrime minister (chair)  \nMinister  of  finance,  minister  of  public  works,  minister  of  transport \nand communication (members) \nCAFI  \nMinistry of Public Works (unchanged) \nProject Management Unit; Department of Roads, Bridges, and Flood \nControl;10 staff  \nInternational \ncompetitive bidding \n\n$62.20 million \n\nShopping \n\n$0.20 million \n\n$7.50 million \n$2.50 million \n$0.36 million \n\nQCBS \nICS \nLCS and/or CQS \nAdvance contracting will be allowed for procurement of civil works or \nconstruction of a dual carriageway from Tasitolu to Tibar.   \nRetroactive financing will be allowed for eligible expenditures \nincurred for consulting services and procurement of goods, services \nand civil works, project management, and project administration up \nto 12 months before the loan signing date, and not exceeding 20% \nof the loan amount. \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and \nADB. \n\n3 contracts (2 \nprocurements \ncompleted) \n2 contracts (1 \nprocurement \ncompleted) \n417 person-months \n403 person-months \n5 contracts \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  CAFI  =  Conselho  de  Administra\u00e7\u00e3o  do  Fundo  Infraestrutura  (Council  for  the \nAdministration  of  the  Infrastructure  Fund),  CQS  =  consultant\u2019s  qualifications  selection,  ICS  =  individual  consultant \nselection, LCS = least-cost selection, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical  \n\nUpgrading  of  roads  will  include  side  slope  stabilization,  drainage  improvement,  and \n22. \npavement reconstruction and widening. This will involve construction of retaining structures and \nuse  of  bioengineering  works  for  slope  stabilization,  improved  drainage,  and  strengthened  and \nwidened road pavements. Widening will be carried out only where technically and economically \nfeasible in light of challenging geotechnical conditions in some locations. In the changed project, \nthe road from Tasitolu to Tibar port entrance will be upgraded to dual carriageway standard to \nincrease its capacity. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n23. \nEconomic  assessment  of  the  components  has  been  undertaken  utilizing  the  roads \neconomic  decision  model,  a  derivative  of  the  highway  development  and  management  model. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nThe original project was found to have a rate of return of 16%. Sensitivity tests were applied and \nthe  economic  internal  rates  of  return  remained  above  10%  under  all  scenarios  analyzed.  The \nchanged Liquica to Tibar road was found to have a rate of return of 27.3% and remained above \n12.0%  under  all  sensitivity  scenarios.  Maintaining  the  unimproved  road  to  a  basic  serviceable \nstandard  is  estimated  to  cost  $0.25  million  per  year,  compared  with  $0.09  million  per  year  for \nthe upgraded road. The government has adequate financial capacity to finance maintenance of \nits infrastructure assets.  \n\n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n\n24. \nThe  public  financial  management  system  is  heavily  centralized  with  numerous  controls \nthat  have  resulted  in  bottlenecks  that  slow  payment  processes.  Decentralization  of  noncore \nfinancial  management  functions  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance  to  line  ministries  has  been \npromoted,  as  capacity  within  these  agencies  has  increased  but  the  system  for  contract \npayments continues to involve a number of agencies. \n \nThe NPC was established in 2011 and is responsible for all procurement over $1 million. \n25. \nIts  performance  to  date  has  been  satisfactory,  albeit  slow  because  of  internal  capacity \nconstraints.  The  transparency  and  efficiency  of  procurement  still  needs  improvement,  and  a \nbalance between risk and accountability for projects without development partner oversight has \nnot yet been achieved. \n \n26. \nThe  executing  agency,  CAFI,  was  established  in  2011  to  oversee  the  use  of  the \ninfrastructure fund.15 The Civil Service Act (2004) provides standards, principles, definitions, and \nguidelines  for  civil  service  administration;  a  code  of  ethics  for  civil  servants;  and  an \nadministrative  disciplinary  mechanism.  A  law  creating  the  new  Anti-Corruption  Commission \nbecame  effective  in  2009,  and  the  first  anticorruption  commissioner  was  appointed  in  2010. \nHowever,  the  independence  of  this  commission  needs  to  be  assured  and  it  needs  to  be \nresourced effectively. \n \n27. \nThe MPW has implemented a number of ADB-supported infrastructure projects through \nits  PMU  since  2010,  including  the  Road  Network  Development  Sector  Project,  the  Road \nNetwork  Upgrading  Project,  and the  Road Network  Upgrading  Sector  Project.  Its  performance \nwith  regard  to  financial  management  has  been  satisfactory,  though  delays  have  been \nexperienced  because  of  controls  and  reviews  of  certified  payments  conducted  by  other \nagencies,  including  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  The  PMU  has  sufficient  capacity  to  manage  the \nchanged project. \n \n28. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and CAFI. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the project administration manual (footnote 14). \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\nThe  primary  beneficiaries  of  the  original  project  are  (i)  road  users,  including  vehicle \n29. \ndrivers  and  passengers  and/or  nonmotorized  transport  users;  (ii)  households  living  in \ncommunities in the catchment areas of the upgraded road links that sell a range of cash crops \nand  other  agricultural  produce;  (iii)  passenger  and  goods  transport  service  providers  and \ncommercial  truck  drivers;  and  (iv)  small  businesses  and  traders  including  vendors  at  local \n\n                                                \n15 The  infrastructure  fund  is  derived  from  the  petroleum-revenue-financed  sovereign  wealth  fund  and  is  used  for \n\nfinancing infrastructure development. \n\n \n\n\fmarkets,  trade  store  owners,  coffee  and  other  produce  buyers,  and  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises in the district capitals and towns. The changed project will  also benefit businesses \nengaged  in  import  and  export  of  goods  through  provision  of  a  shorter  and  more  efficient  land \ntransport link between the port and Dili. Lower transport costs will contribute to lower prices for \nimported goods, which will benefit all segments of society, especially the poor. \n \n30.  \nThe  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming  and  is  designed  to  ensure \ngender equality and allow women\u2019s empowerment by ensuring that the views and requirements \nof  women  are  fully  considered  in  the  design  of  the  components.  Women\u2019s  involvement  in  all \nemployment  and  training  opportunities  under  the  changed  project  will  continue  to  be  actively \npromoted.16 Specifically, the project will encourage and facilitate (i) incorporation of the views of \nwomen in the project design; (ii) awareness of gender and transport security, human trafficking, \nand  HIV/AIDS,  (iii)  a  reasonable  quota  for  women\u2019s  involvement  in  the  construction  work, \ndirected  toward  unemployed  widows,  female  heads  of  households  with  large  numbers  of \ndependents,  and  other  vulnerable  groups;  and  (iv)  a  quota  for  women\u2019s  involvement  in \nbioengineering and maintenance works. \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n\n31. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  category  B.  An  environmental  assessment  and \nreview  framework  and  initial  environmental  examinations  were  prepared  for  both  original \ncomponents.  An  initial  environmental  examination  has  been  prepared  for  the  changed \ncomponent. The original project\u2019s environmental impacts are site specific and temporary. They \ninclude  (i)  disturbance  from  dust  arising  from  loading,  unloading,  and  transportation  of \nconstruction  materials; (ii)  noise;  (iii)  erosion  and  sedimentation from  exposed  surfaces  during \nconstruction  that  may  affect  water  courses;  (iv)  risks  from  the  use  and  disposal  of  hazardous \nmaterials such as fuel and lubricants; and (v) increased risk of accidents from increased vehicle \nmovements. The new component has more significant but manageable impacts, including loss \nof  vegetation  in  the  area  of  the  new  alignment  and  widening  alongside  200  m  of  coastline. \nMitigation measures have been incorporated in all components as outlined in the environmental \nmanagement plans. The PMU will implement the environmental management plans and employ \na full-time national environment specialist and a full-time international specialist in its safeguards \nunit to monitor and report on progress.  \n \n32. \nResettlement.  The  additional  financing  project  is  classified  category  B  on  involuntary \nresettlement.  The  road  widening  under  the  additional  financing  will  impact  private  land  (0.71 \nhectares) and assets, including 11 houses, eight kiosks, four fences, and several trees. A total \nof  15  households  (109  persons)  will  be  affected.  A  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  in \naccordance  with  the  government-endorsed  resettlement  framework  for  the  Road  Network \nUpgrading  Project  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009). 17  The  resettlement  plan \nincludes  necessary  measures  on  compensation  and  resettlement  assistance  to  enhance  or \nrestore the living standards of affected persons.18 The plan will be updated, and compensation \nand relocation activities completed before the start of civil works on the affected land. The PMU \nwill  implement  the  resettlement  plans  and  employ  a full-time  national  specialist  and  a  full-time \ninternational specialist in its safeguards unit to monitor and report on progress. The project will \nalso  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  PMU  and  government  agencies  on  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement. Additional consultant services will include a resettlement specialist, a legal advisor, \nand a resettlement coordinator. \n\n                                                \n16  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17  Resettlement Plan for Tasitolu\u2013Tibar (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 The resettlement plan has been posted on the ADB website and disclosed locally to affected persons. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nIndigenous  persons.  The  additional  financing  project  is  classified  category  C  for \n33. \nindigenous  peoples.  No  distinct  and  vulnerable  indigenous  peoples  as  defined  under  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement are expected to be affected by the project. \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nF. \n\n34. \nNo  significant  additional  issues  have  arisen  from  the  risks  identified  for  the  original \nproject.  Slow  procurement  and  delayed  disbursement  have  affected  project  implementation. \nProcurement  performance  has  improved  (footnote  6)  and  disbursement  will  be  dependent  on \nphysical progress which is now satisfactory. Major risks and mitigating measures are described \nin  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 19  The  integrated  benefits  and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nThe government and CAFI have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \n\n35. \nThe  government  and  CAFI  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n36. \nwhich are set forth in the loan agreement.  \n \n37. \nThe  government  has  agreed  that  no  withdrawals  can  be  made  from  the  loan  account \nsubcategory  for  Works  in  respect  of  any  works  from  Tibar  roundabout  to  Gleno  and  Tibar \nroundabout to Liquica until all of the allocated funds for the works and unallocated categories of \nthe original loans have been fully disbursed.   \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n38. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$11,780,000 to the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste for the additional financing of the Road \nNetwork  Upgrading  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility;  for  a  term  of  25  years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n \n \n3 October 2014 \n\n \n\n                                                \n19 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan
