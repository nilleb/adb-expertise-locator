An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was \nundertaken, and the summary IEE is a core appendix. \n \nThe Tonle Sap Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project \n(the Project) will provide rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) \nfacilities to about 1,760 villages in five provinces around the Tonle \nSap  basin.  It  will  include  community  mobilization,  sanitation  and \nhygiene education programs, and capacity building and institution \nstrengthening.  The  Project  will  provide  an  estimated  1.09  million \npeople  with  safe  drinking  water,  of  whom  about  0.72  million  will \nalso  benefit  from  improved  sanitation  facilities.  It  has  been \nformulated  as  a  sector  project.  Subproject  selection  combines \nelements of poverty targeting with a demand-responsive approach \nto ensure the sustainability of the facilities.  \n \nCambodia  has  made  some  progress  in  providing  water  and \nsanitation services to its people, but rural water coverage remains \nthe  second  lowest  in  Asia.  Providing  access  to  water  and \nsanitation is integral to the Government\u2019s efforts to improve health \nand  living  conditions  in  Cambodia  and  meet  the  Cambodian \nMillennium  Development  Goals  (CMDGs).  The  great  majority  of \nrural  and  poor  households  still  rely  on  self-provision  through \ngroundwater  abstraction,  rainwater  collection,  or  the  use  of \nsurface  water,  with  little  government  investment  to  ensure \nsustainable  quantity  or  monitor  water  quality.  Sanitation  in  rural \nareas  is  almost  nonexistent  (limited  to  simple  on-site  facilities), \nand the majority of the rural population still continues to defecate \nin the open. \n\nPartly  due  to  the  lack  of  access  of  safe  water  and  sanitation, \nCambodia\u2019s infant mortality rate is the second highest in Asia and \nhas increased in the past decade. Many rural areas in Cambodia \nshow  high  rates  of  waterborne  and  water-related  diseases.  Poor \npeople\u2014particularly  women,  children,  and  the  elderly\u2014suffer \ngreatly  from  using  water  unfit  for  human  consumption  and  from \npoor hygiene.  \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nGrant Amount \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \n\nthe  need \n\nfor  change \n\nto  enhance \n\nfacilities;  (iii)  promoting \n\nThe Government developed a national policy for water supply and \nsanitation  in  2003  that  highlights  the  need  for  a  demand-\nresponsive  approach  to  RWSS.  In  line  with  this  policy,  the \nproposed  Project  addresses  the  key  issues  that  the  sector \ncurrently  faces:  (i)  financing  of  investment  funds;  (ii)  building \nownership,  and  the  capacity  of  communities  to  implement  and \nmaintain \nin \nassociated  hygiene  behavior,  which  reinforces  the  health  impact \nof  investments;  (iv)  increasing  the  capacity  of  local  authorities  to \nplan  and  facilitate  sustainable  investments;  (v)  increasing  private \nsector  participation;  and  (vi)  developing  sector  strategies  and \nguidelines and partnerships. \n \nThe  Project  aims \nlow-income \ncommunities  in  rural  areas  by  improving  their  hygiene  and \nsustained  access  to  safe  drinking  water  and  effective  sanitation. \nThe  specific  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  (i)  strengthen  the \ncommunity  capability  to  design,  cofinance,  build,  operate,  and \nmanage  community-based  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities \nand  increase  hygiene  awareness  through  information,  education, \nand communication campaigns; (ii) improve access to safe water \nthrough \nfacilities  based  on \ncommunity demand; (iii) expand access to sanitation facilities; and \n(iv) improve  the  capacity  of  government  agencies,  particularly  at \nthe  local  level,  to  plan  and  facilitate  provisions  for  quality  water \nand sanitation services in target communities. \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  to  be  $24.00 million, \ncomprising  $7.36 million  (30.67%)  in  foreign  exchange  and  the \nequivalent of $16.64 million (69.33%) in local currency. \n \n\nthe  construction  of  adequate \n\nthe  health  of \n\nSource \n\nADB \nGovernment \nBeneficiaries \nTotal \n\n($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n7.36 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n7.36 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n10.64 \n2.06 \n3.94 \n16.64 \n\nTotal Cost \n\n% \n\n18.00 \n2.06 \n3.94 \n24.00 \n\n75.0 \n8.6 \n16.4 \n100.0\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nA grant of $18.0 million is proposed to be provided from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s Asian Development Fund. \n \nUntil 30 June 2012 \n \n31 December 2011 \n\n \nMinistry of Rural Development (MRD) \n \n\n \n\n\fImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\n  v\n\nMRD  has  established  a  project  management  unit  (PMU).  The \nPMU  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  policy  and  implementation \ncoordination between MRD and other central agencies, provincial \nagencies, international development agencies, the private sector, \nand  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB);  (ii)  overall  project \nplanning  and  coordination;  (iii)  setting  standards  for  technical \ndesign,  construction,  and  quality  of  services;  (iv)  developing \nstandard subproject documents; (v) review and implementation of \n(PPMS)  and \nthe  project  performance  monitoring  system \nparticipation  in  procurement  committees  in  the  provinces  for \ncontract packages in excess of $50,000; (vi) undertaking national \nawareness  campaign  on  water  use  and  hygiene  education;  (vii) \nstandardization  and  consolidation  of  project  reports;  and  (viii) \nproviding  information  to  the  private  sector  on  project  business \nopportunities.  Each  provincial  department  of  rural  development \n(PDRD)  in  the  participating  provinces  has  established  a  project \nimplementation  unit  (PIU).  Each  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  the \ndaily  coordination  and  implementation  of  the  subprojects  in  its \nprovince,  including  (i)  liaison  with  commune  councils  and  water \nand sanitation user groups (WSUGs); (ii) collection and screening \nof  initial  subproject  applications;  (iii)  preparation  of  provincial \nproject  implementation  plans;  (iv)  carrying  out  of  subproject \nfeasibility  assessments, \ntechnical  design,  appraisal,  and \npreparation  of  bidding  documents  for  civil  works  contracts;  (v) \nselection  and  contracting  with  civil  works  contractors  and \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) as well as supervising and \ncertifying  contractors\u2019  and  NGOs\u2019  work;  (vi)  establishing  a \nprocurement  committee;  (vii)  implementation  of  land  acquisition, \nresettlement,  and  environmental  activities;  (viii)  with  PDRD, \nproviding  technical  support  to  communities  for  operation  and \nmaintenance of water supply systems; (ix) collection of monitoring \nand evaluation information; and (x) report preparation. \n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nfollowing \n\nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  under  the  Project  will  be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement \nand  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB. \nEquipment and material packages valued at $100,000 equivalent \ninternational  shopping \nor  more  may  be  procured \nprocedures  or  Government  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB. \nPackages  valued  at  less  than  $100,000  equivalent  will  be \nprocured  under  direct  purchasing  procedures.  Civil  works \nestimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  $50,000  or  more  may  be \nawarded  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive  bidding  among \nprequalified contractors according to Government procedures and \nacceptable  to  ADB.  Civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  the \nequivalent of less than $50,000 may be awarded on the basis of \nlocal  competitive  bidding  among  contractors  in  accordance  with \nGovernment  procedures  and  acceptable  to  ADB.  Civil  works \ncontracts  for  household  sanitation  with  a  total  value  of  $5,000 \nequivalent  or  less  may  be  procured  at  the  commune  level \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  Guide  on  Community  Participation \nin \nProcurement. The first two civil works contracts in each province \n will  be  subject  to  ADB  approval.  Subsequently,  each  PIU  will \nmaintain specified documents for review by ADB. \n \nAn  international  firm  will  be  engaged  by  the  PMU  to  support \nproject management and implementation. An individual consultant \nwill be recruited for independent monitoring and evaluation. A total \nof 548 person-months of consulting services (98 international and \n450  domestic)  will  be \nin  project \nmanagement,  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  design  and \nresettlement,  gender,  social  and  community \nconstruction, \ndevelopment,  environment  management,  management  of \ncommunity  water  supply  systems,  training  and  capacity  building, \nand  monitoring  and  evaluation.  In  addition,  about  1,440  person-\nmonths of services will be required for carrying out the community \nmobilization  and  skills  development  component.  These  services \nwill  be  procured  from  qualified  NGOs,  one  for  each  province. \nConsulting  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants.  \n \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  quality  of  life  and  health  of  rural \nCambodian  people  through  improved  access  to  safe  drinking \nwater  and  sanitation  based  on  community  demand  and  needs. \nImproved  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  hygiene  practices  are \nexpected to enhance health and productivity. The Project will also \nimprove the capacity of government institutions and communities \nto  plan,  construct,  manage,  operate,  and  maintain  village  water \nand sanitation infrastructure.  \n\nrequired  with  expertise \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n  vii\n\nleading \n\nto  a  reduction \n\nimproved  hygiene  will  reduce \n\nthe \nBetter-quality  water  and \nprevalence  and  severity  of  waterborne  and  water-related \ndiseases,  particularly  among  infants,  young  children,  and  the \nelderly, \nin  sick  days  and  health \nexpenditures. This will improve social welfare and facilitate efforts \nto improve the economic welfare of beneficiaries. Reliable access \nto  safe  water  and  sanitation  will  reduce  the  time  and  effort \ncurrently  required  to  obtain  clean  water,  increasing  the  time  and \ncapacity available for income-generating activities.

The SSTA, \nimplemented by Department of Rural Water Supply in the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD), \nwas built upon the previous ADB-supported project preparatory technical assistance2 completed \nin  August  2002.  The  SSTA  was  completed  on  20  May  2005.  The  Government  officially \nexpressed interest in availing ADB funds for the ensuing grant.3  \n \nADB\u2019s overarching goal for Cambodia, as defined in its CSP (2005\u20132009), is sustainable \n3. \npoverty  reduction.  To  achieve  this, the  CSP  focuses  on  three  strategic  pillars:  (i)  broad-based \neconomic growth, (ii) inclusive social development, and (iii) good governance. The provision of \nrural  water  supply  and  sanitation  (RWSS)  facilities  is  highlighted  as  one  means  by  which \ninclusive social development can be achieved, and the RWSS sector is identified as a sector in \nwhich ADB will play a catalytic role. The CSP also stresses three crosscutting themes\u2014private \nsector  development,  gender,  and  the  environment\u2014that  help  support  poverty  reduction.  The \nProject will contribute to all of these crosscutting themes. The Tonle Sap basin is identified as \nthe priority area where ADB interventions will be progressively focused. The Project will support \nthe  development  of  RWSS  in  five  provinces  around  the  Tonle  Sap  basin:  Battambang, \nKampong Chhnang, Kampong Thom, Pursat, and Siem Reap. The Project will contribute to the \nachievement  of  Cambodian  Millennium  Development  Goals  (CMDGs)4  to  provide,  by  2015, \naccess to safe water to half of the rural population and access to sanitation facilities to 30%. \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nRWSS  has  been  an  integral  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  overall  strategy  for  rural \n4. \ndevelopment and poverty reduction. The Rectangular Strategy,5 the National Poverty Reduction \nStrategy6  and  the  CMDGs  place  high  priority  on  RWSS.  Rural  households  account  for  almost \n90% of the total poor. The poverty rate in rural areas, estimated at 40.1%, is much higher than \nin  urban  areas,  where  29.7%  of  the  population  is  poor.  Under-5  child  mortality  in  the  country \nstands  at  a  high  124  per  1,000  live  births,  and  maternal  mortality  is  estimated  at  437  per \n100,000  live  births.  While  the  number  of  people  with  access  to  safe  water  and  sanitation  has \nincreased since 1989, mainly as a result of external assistance, Cambodia remains the country \nwith the lowest water and sanitation coverage in East Asia and one of the lowest in the world. \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

RWSS assistance by \nexternal funding agencies has been quite limited in the five provinces.

The  Government  is  committed  to  increasing  improved  water  supply \ncoverage to 50%, and sanitation coverage to 30%, of rural areas by the year 2015, in line with \nthe CMDGs, as stated in its RWSS Sector Investment Plan (2005\u20132015). Details of the sector \nanalysis are in Appendix 1. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nThe major constraint to the sustainable development of RWSS in Cambodia is the lack \n7. \nof  investment  funds.  Significant  investments  in  the  sector  started  in  1989,  when  the  United \nNations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF)  provided  $8.4  million  in  relief  assistance  to  improve  water \nsupply  in  15  provinces.  Over  the  past  17  years,  the  total  external  investment  in  RWSS \namounted  to  $110  million.  Local  communities  contributed  $11  million  in  the  form  of  local \n\n                                                 \n7  World Bank. 2002. World Development Indicators. Washington, DC. \n8  Improved sanitation is defined as access to adequate excreta disposal facilities, such as a connection to a sewer or \nseptic tank system, a pour-flush latrine, a simple pit latrine, or a ventilated improved pit latrine, along with a high \npercentage  of  good  practice  of  hygiene.  Improved  water  is  defined  by  the  Government  as  reasonable  access \n(within  150  meters  throughout  the  year)  to  household  connections,  public  standpipes,  boreholes,  protected  dug \nwells, protected springs, or rainwater collection.  \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nconstruction  materials  and  labor.  Details  of  external  assistance  to  the  sector  are  presented  in \nAppendix 2. The investment funds required to meet the goals of the Government for 2015 are \nestimated  at  $116  million.  Given  the  very  tight  fiscal  position  of  the  Government  and  the  low \nlevel of cost recovery for RWSS investment, a large part of it is expected to come from external \nsources. \n \n8. \nMost of the infrastructure provided by earlier assistance to RWSS in Cambodia suffered \nfrom  inadequate  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  which  contributed  to  the  failure  of  the \nsystems  within  a  few  years.  Community  management  structures  were  not  established  in  most \ncases  and,  when  they  were,  did  not  receive  the  necessary  technical  support  and  training  to \nensure efficient functioning. Lack of community involvement, especially of women, has been the \nmain reason for poor sustainability. Communities\u2019 lack of easy access to spare parts, especially \nfor water pumps, has also been a constraint. To improve the O&M of the RWSS systems, the \nProject  will  assist  in  the  formation  and  capacity  building  of  water  and  sanitation  user  groups \n(WSUGs). National guidelines on WSUGs were drafted during project preparation. The WSUG \nguidelines state that all users must contribute to the capital and O&M costs of the systems by \nlinking  the  right  to  use  the  water  with  these  financial  contributions.  The  poorest  households, \nidentified and verified by the community, will be exempted from O&M cash contributions but will \nbe  required  to  contribute  in-kind.  At  least  40%  of  WSUG  board  members  will  be  women,  who \nwill  account  for  at  least  half  of  the  members  receiving  technical  O&M  training.  The  ethnic \nmakeup of WSUG boards will reflect WSUG membership. \n \n9. \nBeneficiaries\u2019 lack of choice on the different technological and cost options available has \nled to the construction of RWSS systems that are either inadequate or unaffordable. As a result, \nmany  water  systems  have  failed.  The  NWSSP  stresses  the  importance  of  informing  the \npopulation, both men and women, about all feasible domestic water and sanitation choices, and \nof  providing  solutions  that  guarantee  the  availability  of  safe  water  that  suits  the  drinking, \ncooking,  and  washing  needs  of  the  population. The  improvement  of  access  to  safe  water  and \nsanitation  in  areas  where  the  quality  or  the  quantity  of  the  water  is  not  adequate  will  require \ntesting  new  technologies  such  as  (i)  very  deep  tube  wells,  (ii)  treatment  of  surface  water,  (iii) \nnew  methods  of  storing  and  filtering  water  in  individual  households,  and  (iv)  new  types  of \nlatrines. The Project will support these innovations on a pilot basis. \n \n10. \nThe participation of the Cambodian private sector in the construction and O&M of RWSS \nsystems,  which  could  improve  the  sustainability  and  efficiency  of  the  RWSS  sector,  remains \nvery  limited.  Although  the  number  of  private  drilling  companies  is  increasing,  their  technical \ncapabilities and size are limited by the lack of training and the scarcity of affordable access to \ncredit. In a few cases, community infrastructure is managed by the private sector. Although this \nsolution  seems  promising  and  is  a  good  alternative  to  the  many  cases  of  failed  community \nmanagement, little effort has been made so far to help communities and private entrepreneurs \nto  enter  into  public\u2013private  partnerships.  The  NWSSP  defines  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of \nthe  private  sector  as  providing  \u201cRWSS  infrastructure  related  services  to  communities  with \nefficiency, accountability, and in response to community demand.\u201d The same policy emphasizes \nthe  importance  that  MRD  delegate  planning  and  direct  implementation  to  PDRDs,  and  so \nconcentrate on monitoring and regulation, while at the same time promoting the participation of \nthe private sector. \n \n11. \nImproved  community  water  supply  will  not  result  in  full  economic  and  health  benefits \nwithout  due  attention  to  hygiene  and  sanitation  education.  Very  low  sanitation  awareness  in \nrural  Cambodia  hinders  the  development  of  good  sanitation  practices and  the  improvement  of \npublic and household sanitation infrastructure. In rural areas, few people are aware of how good \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\nsanitation improves health. Very few people use latrines, regularly clean water jars, boil drinking \nwater,  or  use  soap  when  washing  their  hands.  A  comprehensive  sanitation  awareness \ncampaign and the participation of local communities in the design of sanitation solutions must \naccompany or occur prior to the development of sanitation infrastructure. \n \n12. \nInformation is lacking about present RWSS coverage in Cambodia, the extent of which \nvaries  greatly  according  to  the  source  and  the  indicators  used  in  the  different  surveys  and \nanalyses. At least five different sources9 are used to define RWSS coverage. Each source uses \ndifferent  definitions  of  coverage  according  to  the  distance  of  users  from  the  source,  the \navailability of the source throughout the year, and the amount and quality of the water available. \nSetting  up  a  nationwide  RWSS  database  that  uses  uniform  criteria  and  is  accessible  to  all \nstakeholders would allow reliable assessment of RWSS provision in Cambodia. \n \n13.  While MRD has gained substantial knowledge of RWSS since its creation in 1993, much \nof  this  knowledge  rests  with  a  few  qualified  staff,  often  seconded  to  various  externally  funded \nprojects. At provincial and district levels, this situation may cause a recurrent lack of capacity to \nimplement  projects.  At  the  local  level,  the  commune  councils  that  were  legally  established \nnationwide after the elections of February 2002 require significant time and resources to enable \nthem  to  perform  their  delegated  functions.  MRD,  PDRDs,  and  district  offices  of  rural \ndevelopment  (DORD)  staff  require  capacity  building,  as  do  village  and  commune  personnel. \nAlthough  the  NWSSP  and  the  RWSS  Sector  Investment  Plan  (2005\u20132015)  provide  a \ncomprehensive  framework  to  develop  the  sector,  the  preparation  of  an  RWSS  strategy  and \nimplementation guidelines are necessary to ensure the appropriate application of the policy and \ninvestment plan. Establishing a specific strategic unit within MRD is required for this purpose, as \nis a development partners\u2019 forum to support the development of the sector.  \n \n14. \nThe  poorest  are  often  forgotten  in  the  decision-making  mechanisms  regarding  water \nsupply and sanitation and, in many cases, are excluded from service. Several nongovernment \norganization (NGO)-supported projects10 have recently developed, and experimented on a pilot \nbasis, sustainable mechanisms to identify and integrate the poorest households. The Project will \nbuild upon the experiences of these organizations to identify and target the poorest 20% in each \nvillage. \n \n15. \nLack  of  access  to  safe  and  reliable  supply  of  drinking  water,  inadequate  sanitation \nfacilities,  and  poor  sanitation  awareness  result  in  poor  health  for  rural  people,  lost  productive \ntime  due  to  sickness  or  the  need  to  care  for  sick  family  members,  missed  schooling \nopportunities  for  children,  and  increased  medical  expenditures.  Women  (especially  female \nheads of households) and children, primarily bear the responsibility for collecting water and are \nthe  worst  affected  by  this  situation.  The  socioeconomic  survey  carried  out  during  project \npreparation  shows  that  water-related  diseases  are  common  among  the  households  surveyed. \nThe  most  common  of  them  is  diarrhea,  whose  prevalence  in  most  participating  provinces  is \nhigher than the national average. \n \n16. \nKey lessons learned from RWSS projects in Cambodia and other Asian countries focus \non the importance of (i) promoting the construction of water points on private land owned by one \n\n                                                 \n9  Ministry  of  Rural  Development.  2005.

Appendix  3  describes \nthese lessons in detail and how they have been incorporated in the Project. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n17. \nThe  Project  will  assist  the  Government  in  achieving  its  RWSS  Sector  Investment  Plan \n(2005\u20132015) national targets of increasing the percentage of the rural population with access to \nsafe water to 50%, and of sanitation facilities to 30%, in the provinces of Battambang, Kampong \nChhnang,  Kampong  Thom,  Pursat,  and  Siem  Reap.  The  five  participating  provinces  were \nselected  based  on  the  following  criteria:  (i)  low  water  supply  and  sanitation  coverage,  (ii)  high \nincidence  of  poverty,  (iii)  high  prevalence  of  water-borne  diseases,  and  (iv)  geographical \nlocation  around  the  Tonle  Sap  basin  and  synergy  with  other  ADB  interventions.  The  Project \naims to improve the quality of life and health of rural residents of the project areas. The Project \nis expected cover about 1,760 villages in the five provinces, providing access to safe water to \n1,087,000  people  and  access  to  sanitation  to  720,000  people  in  the  rural  areas  in  the \nparticipating  provinces.  The  Project  will  empower  communities  to  take  responsibility  for \ndeveloping  and  maintaining  RWSS  facilities  according  to  their  needs;  increase  awareness  of \nhealthy  and  hygienic  behavior;  and  improve  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  facilitate,  regulate \nand plan basic water and sanitation services. The project design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 4. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n18. \nThe  Project  will  consist  of  four  components:  (i)  community  mobilization  and  skills \ndevelopment,  (ii)  water  supply  improvement,  (iii)  sanitation  improvement,  and  (iv)  capacity \nbuilding and institutional support. \n \n\n1. \n\nCommunity Mobilization and Skills Development \n\n19. \nThe  component  will  (i)  strengthen  community  capabilities  to  plan,  develop,  cofinance, \noperate, and maintain community-based RWSS facilities; (ii) provide communities with tools to \nimprove  their  knowledge  of  hygiene  and  sanitation;  and  (iii)  help  women  and  the  poorest \nresidents  to  develop  their  livelihoods  through  information  on  water  and  sanitation-related \nactivities.  Activities  will  be  designed  and  implemented  with  the  support  of  NGOs  applying  a \nuser-friendly approach that takes into account gender issues and the cultures and languages of \nethnic  groups.  The  Project  will  train  NGOs  on  participatory,  gender,  and  technical  issues  and \ntools. Where appropriate, existing materials available in Cambodia and from other countries will \nbe used, and links to the activities of other organizations will be established. These activities will \noccur before, during, and after the construction of RWSS facilities to ensure maximum benefits. \nThe mobilization and skills component will do the following: \n\n\f(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n \n(v) \n \n(vi) \n\nRun  an  awareness  campaign  in  the  project  area  to  explain  to  the  leaders  of \npotentially  participating  communes  and  villages \nthe  project  objectives, \ncomponents, implementation arrangements, and requirements for participation.  \n\nIdentify and select target areas (districts, communes, and villages) based on the \nexisting commune planning process, when feasible, and the subproject selection \ncriteria. \n\nFormulate  water  supply  and  sanitation  village  plans  (WSSVP).  For  each  pre-\nselected  village,  the  following  activities  will  be  carried  out:  (a)  information \ndissemination  on  project  activities  and  ADB  policies  on \nresettlement, \nenvironment,  and  ethnic  minorities;  (b)  rapid  appraisal  of  village  water  and \nsanitation  needs  and  demands;  (c)  village  mapping  and  identification  of \nvulnerable  socioeconomic  groups  and  special  needs;  (d)  identification  of  very \npoor  households  using  participatory  and \n(e) \npreparation  of  a  baseline  survey  on  the  RWSS  situation  and  waterborne \ndiseases;  (f)  assessment  of  land  acquisition  and  environment  issues;  (g) \nidentification of technical options based on informed choice and the lowest cost; \n(h)  identification  of  potential  WSUGs;  and  (i)  preparation  and  submission  of  the \nRWSS village plans to the communes for submission, in turn, to the PIU. \n\ntransparent  methodology; \n\nOrganize and support the formation of WSUGs. \n\nRun an education program on hygiene and sanitation. \n\nOrganize  a  community  skills  development  program  for  women  and  the  poorest \nresidents to develop RWSS-related livelihood opportunities. The program will (a) \nraise  awareness  of  economic  and  employment  opportunities  arising  from  WSS-\nrelated  activities;  (b)  identify  potential  participants;  (c)  assist  the  PIU  in \nimplementing  capacity-building  activities  in  skills  development  for  WSS-related \nactivities (installation, construction and O&M of latrines, wells, rainwater and filter \nequipment, sludge removal, etc.); and (d) provide linkage or referral to livelihood \nimprovement projects. \n\n2. \n\nWater Supply Improvement \n\nThe  Project  will  finance  the  rehabilitation  or  construction  of  water  supply  systems  in \n20. \napproximately  1,760  villages.  It  will  strengthen  provincial  capacity  to  test  water,  including \ngroundwater  testing  in  difficult  areas,  and  support  the  introduction  of  new  technologies.  With \nassistance  and  advice  from  NGOs,  the  WSUGs  will  choose  from  a  menu  of  technical  options \nthat they consider to be the most appropriate based on information they receive regarding the \nsource  of  raw  water;  environmental,  social,  and  institutional/management  issues;  and  O&M \ncosts.  WSUGs  will  contribute,  in  cash  and  in  kind,  10%  of  construction  costs  and  bear \nresponsibility  for  all  O&M  costs.  Household  surveys  undertaken  during  the  project preparatory \ntechnical assistance and the SSTA suggest that the average willingness and capability to pay \nmonthly fees are sufficient to finance the O&M costs of most technical options. The component \nwill include the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\nthe  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  existing  water  supply  systems  by  replacing \nbroken  parts,  covering  open  wells  and  installing  pumps,  repairing  platforms, \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n\n7\n\nproviding  simple  water  treatment  facilities  where  water  quality  problems  are \nexperienced, and augmenting the coverage of the systems; \n\nthe  construction  of  new  water  supply  systems  such  as  wells,  tube  wells,  ponds \nwith  treatment  facilities,  and,  in  exceptional  cases,  small  piped  water  systems \n(household  equipment  such  as  filters  or  improved  rainwater-harvesting  systems \nwill be provided where community options are not suitable or affordable);  \n\ngroundwater  testing  and  soil  resistivity  surveys  to  improve  the  drilling  success \nrate, especially in difficult areas where the water table is very low; \n\nthe introduction of innovative water supply and sanitation technologies, including \npilot trials of new water treatment facilities, pumping systems, rainwater storage \nunits,  and  latrine  types  to  assess  how  appropriate  they  are  to  Cambodian \nenvironmental and cultural conditions; and \n\nwater  quality  testing  of  all  water  supply  systems  constructed  under  the  Project, \nincluding the initial testing for chemical impurities and the supply of equipment for \nregularly scheduled biological testing. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nSanitation Improvement \n\n21. \nThe Project will finance the rehabilitation or construction of private and public sanitation \nsystems  and  raise  awareness  of  water  use  and  hygiene  issues  nationally.  It  will  support  the \ndevelopment  of  sanitation  facilities  by  providing  different  levels  of  subsidy  for  latrine \nconstruction, depending on the type and cost of the latrine. It will include: \n \n\na nationwide awareness campaign on water use and hygiene education using TV \nand radio broadcasts; \n\nthe  construction  of  hygienic  latrines  for  private  households,  preceding  or \nconcurrent with the hygiene education program, where beneficiaries select from \na broad spectrum of latrine types (pour-flush, sealed, ventilated improved pit, and \ndry  pit)  whose  standard  designs,  technical  specifications,  and  estimated  unit \ncosts have been prepared by the Project; \n\nthe  construction  and  rehabilitation  of  public  latrines  in  schools,  markets,  health \ncenters,  pagodas,  mosques,  prisons,  and \nthe \ndetermination of sustainable O&M arrangements. \n\ntourist  spots, \n\nfollowing \n\n4. \n\nCapacity Building and Institutional Support \n\n22. \nThe  Project  will  (i)  improve  MRD,  PDRD,  DORD,  and  commune  council  capacity  for \nfacilitating,  regulating,  planning,  supervising  and  monitoring  the  delivery  of  quality  water  and \nsanitation services in target villages; (ii) strengthen and support private sector participation; (iii) \ndevelop  a  comprehensive  RWSS  database;  (iv)  support  the  development  of  the  policy  and \ninstitutional  framework  of  the  sector;  and  (v)  facilitate  the  Government\u2019s  cooperation  with \ndevelopment partners. It will include: \n \n\n(i) \n\na  capacity-building  program  for  MRD,  PDRDs,  DORDs,  and  commune  councils \non  RWSS  policies,  planning,  budgeting,  financial  management  and  accounting, \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\nproject  administration,  economic  analysis,  gender  awareness,  community \nparticipation  techniques,  environmental  management,  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement,  private  sector  participation, \nissues,  and  data \nmanagement;  \n\ntechnical \n\nsupport for the private sector through the establishment of a database of private \nentrepreneurs  participating  in  supply  and  management  contracts  in  the  RWSS \nsector, along with capacity building on technical and managerial issues; \n\nthe  establishment  of  a  nationwide  RWSS  database  to  serve  as  a  reference  on \ncoverage; and \n\ninstitutional  support  to  MRD  for  the  establishment  of  a  RWSS  strategic  policy \nunit,  a  development  partners  forum  for  RWSS,  and  the  preparation  of  RWSS \nstrategy and policy guidelines.  \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \nSpecial Features \n\nC. \n\n23. \nOperation and Maintenance of RWSS Facilities. WSUGs are responsible for the O&M \nof the water supply systems. The wells will be constructed on private property except where it is \ntechnically not feasible. The property owner is expected to play a critical role within the WSUG \nfor the maintenance of the facilities. NGOs, through the community mobilization component, will \nhelp  villages  establish  WSUGs,  identify  the  locations  of  wells,  and  reach  an  agreement  with \nproperty  owners,  in  coordination  with  commune  councils,  regarding  O&M  responsibility,  which \nclearly  specifies  the  communal  ownership  of  the  facilities.  PIUs  will  ensure  that  civil  works \ncontractors  prepare  a  plan  to  supply  spare  parts.  Contracts  will  require  private  suppliers  of \npumps  to  secure  a  fixed  number  of  spare  parts  in  a  private  outlet  situated  in  every  district \nserved  by  them  under  the  Project.  PIUs  will  inform  WSUGs  of  the  outlets\u2019  addresses,  price \nschedules, and agreed mode of payment. The contractors will be required to guarantee at least \n6 months of successful operation after commissioning and will provide basic training to WSUGs \non O&M. Women in particular will be encouraged to participate in O&M training. \n \nPIUs and consultants will provide technical support to WSUGs and piped water system \n24. \noperators during project implementation, and PDRDs will provide it thereafter. The O&M cost of \nthe  piped  systems  will  be  covered  by  contributions  to  be  collected  from  WSUG  members. \nSimple  manuals  explaining  the  O&M  of  each  technological  option  will  be  prepared  and \ndistributed to WSUGs. The O&M of private latrines will be the responsibility of each household. \nThe O&M of public latrines will be done by institutions (schools, health centers, and pagodas) or \nprivate  operators  hired  by  commune  councils.  Clearly  defined  O&M  responsibilities  for  public \nlatrines will be a precondition for providing project funds for public latrine construction.  \n \n25. \nPoverty  Focus.  The  poorest  residents  will  be  targeted  in  three  ways.  Most  broadly, \nparticipating  provinces  have  been  selected  based  on  high  poverty  incidence.  More  narrowly, \nsubproject pre-selection criteria give priority to villages in the poorest 20% of communes in each \nprovince.  Within  villages,  residents  will  identify  the  poorest  20%  of  residents  during  the \npreparation  of  their  WSSVPs,  with  the  verification  of  village  chiefs,  commune  councils,  and \nsupporting NGOs. The Project will ensure that the poorest households are included in WSUGs \nor as recipients of a household solution. Household water supply systems will be provided when \ncommunity  options are not possible. All households will be able to select affordable sanitation \noptions,  as  the  options  are  subsidized  based  on  the  technology  used.  The  poorest  residents, \nwho  have  been  identified,  will  be  exempted  from  contributing  cash  but  will  still  be  required  to \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nmake  contributions  in-kind  toward  the  cost  of  water  supply  systems.  Sanitation  options  will  be \nsubsidized based on the levels of technology and cost, so that even the poorest will be able to \nafford  the  most  basic  latrine.  The  skills  development  subcomponent  under  component  1  will \ntarget the poorest and women in generating awareness about RWSS-related job opportunities \nand training in construction and O&M for civil works supported under the Project (e.g., resource \ngroups). A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 5. \n \n26. \nGender Focus. The Project will increase access to safe water and proper sanitation for \nrural men and women. A gender analysis was conducted for the Project to determine the water \nuse  and  hygiene  education  needs  of  both  men  and  women.  About  52%  of  the  combined \npopulation  of  the  five  provinces  is  female,  and  close  to  27%  of  all  households  are  headed  by \nwomen. Women will experience greater benefits in terms of time-savings, a reduced burden of \nlabor, and improved family health. The gender working group within MRD will develop national \nguidelines  for  mainstreaming  gender  in  the  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  sector.  As  water \nusers, women will constitute at least 40% of the WSUG board and about half of board members \nthat attend training on the O&M of water supply systems. In addition, the Project supports the \nincreased participation of men in hygiene education programs, which are traditionally attended \njust  by  women.  At  least  40%  of  all  participants  in  hygiene  education  will  be  men.  A  summary \ngender action plan has been prepared (Appendix 6).  \n \nSupport  to  Private  Sector  Participation.  The  Project  will  encourage  private  sector \n27. \nparticipation in the RWSS sector. All civil works and supply of equipment and materials for the \nProject  will  be  awarded  through  competitive  bidding  to  private  companies.  Where  necessary, \nthe Project will provide assistance to the commune councils to enter into partnership with private \nsector  operators  to  help  them  manage,  in  coordination  with  the  WSUGs,  the  water  supply \nfacilities,  particularly  piped  water  systems,  through  standardized  service  or  management \ncontracts  developed  by  the  Project.  Training  on  the  potential  and  modalities  for  private  sector \nparticipation in RWSS will be provided to MRD, PDRD, DORD, and commune council staff, and \ntraining  on  technical  standards  will  be  provided  to  private  sector  companies.  The  Project  will \nalso  establish  a  database  of  private  sector  contractors,  equipment,  and  service  providers  and \nwill pass this information to PIUs, commune councils, and WSUGs. \n \nGeographical Focus on the Tonle Sap Basin. The geographical focus of the Project is \n28. \nconsistent with the CSP geographical priorities and will contribute to the implementation of the \nTonle  Sap  Basin  Strategy.11  In  particular,  the  Project  will  contribute  to  two  of  the  strategic \nprinciples  of  the  strategy.  First,  it  will  improve  the  livelihoods  of  the  local  population  by \nincreasing their (i) physical capital in terms of water supply and sanitation facilities; (ii) human \ncapital  through  improved  health;  (iii)  social  capital  by  giving  more  power  to  the  villages  and \nsupporting the establishment of WSUGs; and (iv) natural capital by educating beneficiaries on \nenvironment-friendly  methods  of  water  use  and  disposal  of  human  waste.  Second,  it  will \ncontribute to improved social justice by giving special priority to the poor and vulnerable groups \nand by supporting equal access for women to opportunities created by the Project. The Project \nwill  also  contribute  to  the  core  areas  of  intervention  of  the  strategy,  particularly  human \ndevelopment,  by  reducing  waterborne  and  water-related  diseases  associated  with  the  lack  of \nsanitation and safe water. \n \n29. \nDecentralization  and  Deconcentration.  Subprojects  will  be  pre-selected  according  to \nthe  national  commune  planning  process  that  aims  to  encourage  democratic  decision-making \nprocesses at the local level. However, there will be some flexibility to select subprojects outside \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2005. The Tonle Sap Basin Strategy. Manila. \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nthe commune planning process. Community procurement, managed by communes and villages, \nwill  be  promoted  by  the  Project  for  those  communes  with  enough  management  capacity  for \nhousehold  sanitation  projects  of  less  than  $5,000.  The  identification  of  the  targets  areas  and \nsubprojects,  preparation  of  annual  plans,  and  selection  of  NGOs  and  contractors  will  be  done \nprimarily at the provincial level with adequate support from the PMU and consultants. Provincial \nrural  development  committees  will  have  the  opportunity  to  review  the  proposed  annual  plan \nprepared by the PIU, and the governor of each province will approve it. \n \nTransparency and Quality Control. The Project will maximize transparency and quality \n30. \ncontrol  in  the  RWSS  sector  in  general,  and  in  the  implementation  of  the  Project  in  particular. \nMRD  will  set  up  a  website  to  disseminate  the  national  sector  policy,  RWSS  strategy,  sector \nguidelines,  investment  plans,  projects,  and  business  opportunities  for  the  private  sector.  The \nwebsite will also provide detailed information about project activities such as project documents, \nimplementation arrangements, rights and responsibilities of each stakeholder, selected villages, \nprocurement  information,  contract  awards,  and  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation \nindicators. The community mobilization component will help rural communities understand and \nmonitor the Project. PIUs in each of the participating provinces will inform the rural communities \nabout the Project and possibilities for their participation and monitoring. NGOs implementing the \ncommunity  mobilization  plan  will  discuss  the  rights  and  responsibilities  of  the  villagers  and \ngovernment  agencies,  the  available  technical  options  for  water  supply  and  sanitation,  and  the \nneed  for  sustainable  O&M.  Village  and  commune  representatives  will  witness  the  opening  of \nfinancial proposals received from bidders for the civil works affecting their communities. \n \n31. \nIdentification  and  Selection  of  Subprojects.  The  identification  and  selection  of \nsubprojects  will  follow  the  commune  planning  process  set  by  the  Government  within  the \ndecentralization process. Each PIU will select an appropriate NGO active in rural water supply \nand sanitation in the participating province to carry out community mobilization activities. They \nwill perform, on an annual basis, the following actions: (i) issue a notice to all commune councils \nin  the  participating  province  and,  through  them,  to  the  villages  in  the  participating  provinces, \ndescribing  the  Project,  its  objectives,  scope,  and  organization:  (ii)  in  conjunction  with  the \nselected  NGO,  invite  representatives  from  the  commune  councils  and  villages  in  the \nparticipating province to a district meeting to explain procedures and conditions to participate in \nthe  Project;  (iii)  attend  the  district  integration  workshops  to  determine  a  village\u2019s  interest  in \nbecoming a subproject and thereby participating in the Project; (iv) pre-select the villages to be \nincluded in the Project during that year and prepare an annual plan for circulation to the PDRD \nand  approval  of  the  provincial  governor;  (v)  ensure  that  the  selected  NGO  assists  each  pre-\nselected  village  in  preparing  a  WSSVP  suitable  for  inclusion  in  the  Project;  and  (vi) oversee \nsubmission of the village plan to the applicable commune council for approval. In the event that \na village is justifiably not represented at the district workshop but is interested in participating in \nthe Project, it may still apply to the PIU directly. \n \n32. \nCriteria for Selection of Subprojects. PIUs will select subprojects for each village and \nprepare  annual  plans  based  on  the  following  criteria:  (i)  the  depth  of  poverty  of  the  village  as \ndemonstrated by the poverty ranking of its commune12; (ii) existing water supply coverage in the \nvillage as demonstrated by the initial project proposal submitted by the village and confirmed by \nthe commune council13; (iii) geographic coherence and contiguousness of the proposed villages \nfor  each  year  of  project  implementation;  (iv)  village  commitment  as  demonstrated  by  (a) a \nrequest  by  the  village  for  inclusion  in  the  Project,  (b)  availability  of  necessary  land,  (c)  a \n\n                                                 \n12 Priority will be given to villages found in the poorest 20% of communes in each province.  \n13 Priority will be given to villages in communes where the safe water supply coverage is 20% or less.  \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nimpacts  or  require  significant \n\nresolution to form at least one WSUG, and (d) resolution to meet the required contributions for \ncapital cost and O&M for the project facilities to ensure their sustainability; (v) health indicators \nas demonstrated by the prevalence of diarrhea; (vi) ethnic balance between proposed villages; \nand  (vii)  the  absence  of  duplicative  assistance  in  RWSS  from  another  donor.  A  village  will  be \nexcluded  from  the  Project  if  the  requested  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities  will  cause \nsignificant  adverse  environmental \nland  acquisition  and \nresettlement  (LAR).  The  criteria  will  be  explained  to  the  representatives  of  communes  and \nvillages during the district meetings organized by the PIUs. The names of the selected villages \nincluded in each provincial annual plan will be published in the project website.  \n \n33. \nLand  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  Past  experience  with  RWSS  projects  suggests \nthat subprojects can be designed without severely affecting people and households. Preliminary \nLAR  investigation  has  been  built  into  the  community  decision-making  process.  Each  WSSVP \nwill include a LAR investigation for the selected civil works in that village. Community wells and \nhousehold  latrines  will  be  built  on  private  land,  where  land  acquisition  will  not  be  necessary. \nHowever,  very  minor  land  acquisition  may  be  required  for  bigger  water  supply  systems  (e.g., \nponds and small piped water systems) and public latrines. The PIU will prepare a LAR plan for \neach cluster of subprojects for ADB concurrence. A LAR framework has been prepared to guide \nany land acquisition. A summary is in Appendix 7. \n \nEnvironment. The Project may have some minor and temporary environmental impacts, \n34. \nresulting mainly from the construction of water supply facilities and latrines. Drilling of wells will \ngenerate  noise,  dust,  and  fumes,  and  the  construction  process  will  produce  solid  waste  and \nother  debris.  Initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  were  conducted  for  the  Project  as  a \nwhole  and  two  sample  subprojects.  As  the  IEE  summary  states,  these  impacts  will  be  minor, \ntemporary,  and  confined  to  the  area  immediately  surrounding  the  drilling  and  construction.  An \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  has  been  prepared  to  ensure  that \nfuture  subprojects  will  be  screened  with  appropriate  environmental  screening  criteria,  and  the \nrequired  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  plans  with  adequate  budgets  will  be  developed \nand implemented. A summary IEE is in Appendix 8. \n \n35. \nSector Approach. The Project follows a sector approach based on the three pillars for \nsector  projects:  (i)  a  15-year  sector  investment  plan  prepared  by  MRD,  (ii)  a  basic  policy \nframework  established through  the  NWSSP,  and  (iii)  sufficient  institutional  capacity  in  MRD  to \nimplement  the  investment  program.  The  Project  will  support  each  of  those  aspects  by \n(i) improving MRD and PDRD planning capacities for investment in the sector in project areas; \n(ii) expanding the policy framework through the preparation of a RWSS strategy and guidelines; \nand (iii) improving the institutional capacity of MRD and PDRDs in project management, finance \nand accounting, gender, environment, resettlement, and technical aspects. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n36. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  to  be  $24.00  million  equivalent,  comprising \n$7.36  million  (30.67%)  in  foreign  exchange  and  $16.64  million  (69.33%)  equivalent  in  local \ncurrency.  The  cost  estimates  include  the  provision  of  $1.84  million  for  taxes  and  duties.

The  Government  will  provide  $2.06  million  equivalent,  and  the \nbeneficiaries $3.94 million equivalent, respectively amounting to 8.6% and 16.4% of the project \ncost. Grant financing by ADB is justified by the nature of the Project, which addressed poverty, \ngender  concerns,  and  environmental  health  issues  in  the  project  areas,  as  well  as  assists  in \nachieving the water and sanitation-related CMDGs. Justification for grant financing is provided \nin Appendix 10.

MRD will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the Project. MRD has established a project \nsteering  committee  comprising  the  departments  concerned  within  MRD  and  representatives \nfrom the participating provinces\u2019 PDRDs. The committee will be chaired by an MRD secretary of \nstate and meet at least every 3 months to coordinate project activities. MRD has established a \nPMU  with  a  part-time  project  director,  full-time  project  manager,  and  other  full-time  staff  with \nappropriate technical qualifications, including an environmental and a resettlement officer. The \nPMU will be responsible for coordinating with ADB and other central, provincial and international \nagencies; overall project planning and coordination; monitoring of gender and social safeguard \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nissues;  setting  standards  for  technical  design, construction  and  quality  of  services;  developing \nstandard subproject documents; standardizing and consolidating project reports; policy reforms, \nand providing information to the private sector on project business opportunities. \n \nEach PDRD in participating provinces has established a PIU with a part-time director, a \n39. \nfull-time PIU project manager, and other full-time staff with appropriate technical qualifications, \nincluding  an  environmental  officer.  Each  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  daily  coordination  and \nimplementation  of  the  subprojects  in  the  participating  provinces,  including  (i)  liaison  with \ncommune  councils  and  WSUGs;  (ii)  collection  and  screening  of  initial  subproject  applications; \n(iii) preparation of provincial project implementation plans; (iv) carrying out subproject feasibility \nassessments, technical design, appraisal, and preparation of bidding documents for civil works \ncontracts; (v) preparation of a LAR plan and IEE for each cluster of subprojects; (vi) selection \nand  contracting  with  civil  works  contractors  and  NGOs,  as  well  as  supervising  and  certifying \ncontractors'  and  NGOs'  work;  (vii)  provision  of  technical  support  to  communities  for  O&M  of \nwater  supply  systems;  (viii)  collection  of  monitoring  and  evaluation  information;  and  (ix)  report \npreparation.  The  roles  and  responsibilities  of  each  project  institution  are  in  Appendix  11. \nDetailed terms of reference have been prepared for each member of the PMU and PIUs. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  6  years  commencing  in  2006.  An \n\n40. \nimplementation schedule is presented in Appendix 12. \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n41. \nProcurement of goods and services under the Project will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB's Guidelines for Procurement and local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to \nADB.  Equipment  and  material  packages  valued  at  $100,000  equivalent  or  more  may  be \nprocured  under  international  shopping  or  Government  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB. \nPackages  valued  at  less  than  $100,000  equivalent  will  be  procured  under  direct  purchasing \nprocedures. Civil works estimated to cost the equivalent of $50,000 or more may be awarded on \nthe basis of local competitive bidding among prequalified contractors according to Government \nprocedures  and  acceptable  to  ADB.  All  civil  work  contracts  with  a  total  value  of  $50,000 \nequivalent or more will require the presence of a PMU member in the procurement committee \nand will be submitted to ADB for approval. Civil works contracts estimated to cost the equivalent \nof  less  than  $50,000  may  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive  bidding  among \ncontractors  in  accordance  with  Government  procedures  and  acceptable  to  ADB.  Civil  works \ncontracts  for  household  sanitation  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  $5,000  or  less  can  be \nprocured following ADB\u2019s Guide on Community Participation in Procurement. The first two civil \nworks  contracts  in  each  province  will  be  subject  to  ADB  approval.  Subsequently,  the  PIU  will \nmaintain  specified  documents14  for  review  by  ADB.  PIUs  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  the \nbidding documents and contracts, chair the procurement committees and awarding contracts for \nall civil works. The proposed procurement packages are in Appendix 13.  \n \n\n                                                 \n14 These  include  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  village  plan,  bid  invitation  letters,  bid  opening  statements,  bid \nevaluation  reports  or  approval  documents,  and  signed  contracts  between  the  project  implementation  units  or  the \ncommune council and the contractors. \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n42. \nAn  international  firm  will  be  engaged  by  PMU  to  support  project  management  and \nimplementation  following  the  quality  and  cost-based  system.  An  individual  consultant  will  be \nrecruited for independent monitoring and evaluation. A total of 548 person-months of consulting \nservices  (98  international  and  450  domestic)  will  be  required  with  expertise  in  project \nmanagement, rural water supply and sanitation design and construction, resettlement, gender, \nsocial  and  community  development,  environment  management,  management  of  community \nwater  supply  systems,  training  and  capacity  building,  and  project  performance  monitoring.  In \naddition, about 1,440 person-months of services will be required for carrying out the community \nmobilization and skills development component. These services will be procured from qualified \nNGOs, one in each province, selected through a competitive process. Consulting services will \nbe procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nIt is envisaged that payment of eligible expenditures from the proceeds of the grant will \n43. \nbe  made  either  through  direct  payment  or  imprest  account  procedures  in  accordance  with  the \nADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  of  January  2001.  To  ensure  the  timely  release  of  grant \nproceeds,  and  to  expedite  project  implementation,  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  will, \nimmediately  upon  grant  effectiveness,  open  an  imprest  account  in  the  National  Bank  of \nCambodia and authorize the PMU to use it. The PMU and each PIU will also set up a second-\ngeneration  imprest  account,  at  the  provincial  level,  with  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  the \nGovernment and ADB for disbursement of eligible funds for small contracts. The PMU and PIUs \nmay use the statement of expenditure procedure for replenishing the imprest accounts, provided \nthat each individual payment does not exceed $50,000. \n \n44. \nThe imprest accounts will be used, managed, replenished, and liquidated by the PMU in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The initial deposit to the imprest account \nwill be based on estimated expenditures for the first 6 months of project implementation, to be \nprepared  by  the  PMU  and  PIUs,  but  will  not  exceed  the  combined  ceiling  equivalent  of  $1.3 \nmillion,  with  a  ceiling  of  $200,000  for  each  second-generation  imprest  account.  Withdrawal \napplications,  including  imprest  account  replenishment  requests,  will  be  prepared  by  the  PIUs \nand sent through the PMU to the Ministry of Economy and Finance for approval. Each imprest \naccount will be managed by the PMU or PIU with the validation of the consultant team leader, in \naccordance with detailed arrangements agreed by the Government and ADB. No disbursement \nof grant proceeds will be made to a participating province if misprocurement has been found by \nADB  or  procurement  has  been  identified  as  irregular,  until  the  misprocurement  or  other \nirregularity has been corrected by the province concerned to the satisfaction of the Government \nand ADB. Each WSUG will provide a contribution of 10% of the total project cost, of which 3% \nwill be in cash and 7% in-kind. The cash contribution from WSUGs will be deposited in a bank \naccount at the provincial level, which is managed by the PIU. Poorest households will be able to \nmake their entire 10% contribution in kind with no cash contribution required. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n45. \nA  separate  accounting  system  for  project  expenditures  will  be  established  and \nmaintained in accordance with sound accounting principles. The consultant will provide training \non the use of the imprest accounts and operating support to PMU and PIU accounting staff. All \nproject  accounts,  will  be  audited  annually  as  part  of  the  regular  audit by  a  single auditing  firm \nacceptable  to  ADB,  using  international  accounting  and  auditing  standards.  The  consolidated \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nthe  project \n\naudit reports will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of the close of the Government's fiscal \nyear.  The  audit  opinion  will  include  (i)  an  assessment  of  the  adequacy  of  accounting  and \ninternal control systems regarding project expenditures and transactions to ensure safe custody \nof  project-financed  assets;  (ii)  a  determination  as  to  whether  the  Government,  MRD,  and \nparticipating  provinces  have  maintained  adequate  documentation  for  all  financial  transactions, \nspecifically  including  the  statement  of  expenditure  and  imprest  account  procedures;  and  (iii) \nconfirmation  of  compliance  with \nfinancial  management  system  and  ADB \nrequirements for project management.  \n \n46. \nThe PIUs will submit quarterly reports and data to the PMU within 15 days of the end of \neach quarter. The PMU will (i) collect and consolidate all project progress reports, site reports, \ntechnical  and  financial  reports  and  submit  them  to  ADB  and  (ii)  prepare  quarterly  progress \nreports within 30 days of the end of each quarter, a midterm project evaluation report, and an \noverall  project  completion  report.  The  quarterly  report  will  include  (i)  a  narrative  description  of \nprogress  made  during  the  reporting  period;  (ii)  modifications,  if  any,  to  the  implementation \nschedule;  (iii)  details  of  land  use  and  resettlement;  (iv)  information  on  preparation  and \nimplementation of IEEs; (v) major project activities by PMU, PIUs, and NGOs; (vi) financial and \nprocurement-related  information;  (vii)  problems  experienced  and  remedial  actions  proposed; \n(viii)  the  work  to  be  carried  out  during  the  upcoming  reporting  period;  and  (ix)  a  summary  of \nexpenditures during the quarter, year-to-date expenditures, and total expenditures to date.  \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n47. \nA comprehensive project performance monitoring system (PPMS) has been prepared. A \nset of PPMS indicators have been developed. The PPMS will be integrated into the information \nmanagement  system  of  the  MRD  and  PDRDs,  to  be  developed  under  the  institutional \ndevelopment  component,  so  that  the  monitoring  of  social and  economic  benefits  can  continue \nbeyond project implementation. During project implementation, the PIUs in each province will be \nresponsible  for  ensuring  that  the  PPMS  is  implemented  and  updated,  in  consultation  with  the \nlocal communities, to (i) examine the project\u2019s technical performance, (ii) evaluate the delivery \nof  the  planned  facilities,  (iii)  assess  the  achievement  of  the  Project\u2019s  objectives,  (iv)  ensure \ncompliance  with  social  safeguards,  and  (v)  measure  the  Project\u2019s  benefits.  Annual  PPMS \nreports will be prepared by each PIU, then consolidated by the PMU and submitted to ADB. The \nintegrated  system  for  the  management,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  of  project  impacts, \noutcomes, and outputs accords with ADB\u2019s Project Performance Monitoring System  Handbook. \n \nProject  outputs  will  be  monitored  in  the  regular  course  of  the  Project  in  terms  of \n48. \nefficiency  (quantities  delivered,  trained  persons,  meetings)  and  effectiveness  (quality  of  the \ngoods and services delivered). The PPMS will generate data on the immediate effects and the \nbroader impacts of project investments on socioeconomic development, poverty reduction, and \nthe level that women and vulnerable groups participate and the degree to which they benefit. A \nbaseline  survey  will  be  carried  out  within  each  community  at  the  start  of  activities.  Data \ncollection will be organized by the NGOs through villages and communes, and the data stored \nin a database maintained by the PIUs and PMU. The PPMS expert will provide guidelines and \ntraining for the design and maintenance of these databases. All monitoring data and indicators \nwill  be  disaggregated  by  gender,  ethnicity,  and  income.  In  addition  to  the  normal  PPMS,  an \nexternal  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  individual  consultant  acceptable  to  ADB  will  be \nrecruited to independently assess project effectiveness. The PMU will also appoint an external \nmonitoring entity, acceptable to ADB, for LAR activities. \n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n49.  MRD  and  ADB  will  conduct  joint  project  reviews  at  least  twice  a  year  and  a \ncomprehensive  project  review  about  36  months  after  grant  effectiveness.  The  comprehensive \nproject review will evaluate (i) the actual progress of each project component in each province, \n(ii)  implementation  procedures,  (iii)  feedback  from  PPMS  activities,  (iv)  the  functioning  and \nperformance of the PMU and PIUs, (v) the performance of consultants and NGOs, and (vi) the \nfinancial performance and cost recovery of WSUGs will be evaluated.  \n \n\n9. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n50. \nDuring  project  processing,  ADB\u2019s  Anti-corruption  Policy  was  explained  to  government \nofficials.  Attention  was  drawn  to  the  newly  revised  section  on  fraud  and  corruption  added  to \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  particularly  the \nneed  for  bidders,  suppliers,  contractors,  and  consultants  to  observe  the  highest  standards  of \nethics  in  procuring  and  executing  ADB-financed  contracts,  and  the  sanctions  if  fraud  and \ncorruption are discovered. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n51. \nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  an  estimated  1.09  million  people  with  improved  safe \ndrinking  water  facilities,  of  which  about  0.72  million  will  also  benefit  from  improved  sanitation \nfacilities  in  the  project  area.  The  Project  is  expected  to  realize  its  anticipated  benefits  without \nsignificant adverse impacts. Limited adverse impacts identified in the analyses were eliminated \nor mitigated in the design of the Project. \n \nPoverty  Reduction  Impacts.  The  five  provinces  have  a  combined  population  of  3.5 \n52. \nmillion  people  in  2005,  of  whom  1.35  million  (39%)  live  below  the  official  poverty  line.  About \n85%  of  the  total  population  in  the  five  provinces  is  rural.  Rural  households,  whose  primary \nsource  of  income  comes  from  agriculture,  account  for  almost  90%  of  Cambodia\u2019s  poor.  The \nProject is expected to meet the CMDG targets 7.10 (50% of the rural population to have access \nto safe water) and 7.12 (30% of the rural population to have access to improved sanitation) in \nthe five provinces by 2011. About 50\u201370% of the project beneficiaries are expected to be poor \ngiven  the  high  proportion  of  poor  engaged  in  agriculture  in  the  project  provinces,  and  the \ntargeting of the poorest households and communes in the project area. The provision of RWSS \noptions will not discriminate against any communities or households due to ethnicity. \n \n53. \nGender and Social Impacts. Improved access to safe and reliable water and sanitation \nwill  result  in  time  savings,  a  reduced  burden  of  labor,  and  improved  family  health.  Women  in \nparticular will benefit from the time savings and improved access to safe water by having more \ntime to participate in income-generating activities, and to attend to school. As active members of \nWSUGs  and  WSUG  boards,  women  will  have  equal  opportunities  to  receive  technical  training \nand  RWSS-related  skills  development  under  the  Project.  Better-quality  water  and  access  to \nimproved  sanitation  will  also  reduce  the  prevalence  and  severity  of  waterborne  and  water-\nrelated diseases. Hygiene and sanitation education for both men and women will complement \nthe RWSS infrastructure. Improved access to infrastructure and better understanding of proper \nhygiene  practices  will  contribute  to  fewer  days  lost  due  to  sickness  and  a  reduction  in  related \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nhealth  expenditures.  The  Project  will  also  contribute  indirectly  to  achieving  CMDG  target  4.1 \n(reducing by half the mortality rate among children under the age of 5).  \n \n54. \nEnvironmental  Impacts  and  Benefits.  The  Project  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the \nlocal environment of project areas due to improved access to safe drinking water and sewerage \nmanagement  based  on  new  latrines  and  septic  tanks.  The  quantity  of  sewage  and  waste \ndisposed of into rivers will reduce. The IEE found that potentially adverse environmental impacts \nare  minor,  temporary,  and  possible  to  mitigate.  An  EARF  has  been  developed  to  guide  the \nenvironmental assessment and implementation of environmental mitigation, as well as monitor \nenvironmental conditions during project implementation. \n \n55. \nCommunity  Empowerment.  The  Project  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  communities\u2019 \ncapacity  to  promote  their  own  development.  Their  active  involvement  in  selecting,  planning, \ncofinancing, and implementing project interventions, and their taking responsible for the O&M of \nthe  facilities,  will  drive  their  empowerment.  The  communities  will  subsequently  be  able  to  use \nthese skills and enhanced social capital to undertake other community improvement activities. \n \n56. \nEthnic  Minority  Groups/Indigenous  Peoples.  The  Project  will  benefit  all  ethnic \nminority  groups  and  indigenous  households  equally.  Specific  actions  have  been  incorporated \ninto  the  project  design,  which  include  (i)  subproject  selection  criteria  that  consider  ethnic \nbalance  in  the  selection  of  subproject  villages,  (ii)  village  mapping  to  identify  where  different \nethnic  groups  live,  (iii)  WSUG  boards  are  representative  of  the  ethnic  composition  of  the \nWSUGs, (iv) water use and hygiene education to incorporate the water and sanitation needs of \ndifferent ethnic groups, and (v) the inclusion of ethnicity issues in the project guidelines.  \n \n57. \nIncreased  Government  Capacity  and  Coordination.  MRD  and  the  participating \nPDRDs  and  DORDs  will  improve  their  performance  to  better  plan,  regulate,  and  facilitate  the \ndevelopment of the RWSS sector. Provinces, districts, communes, and villages will develop the \ncapacity  to  take  new  responsibilities.  The  Project  will  promote  greater  transparency  regarding \nthe  provision  of  information  and  decision-making  processes  at  all  administrative  levels.  The \ncapacity  of  government  officials  working  in  RWSS  will  be  improved  in  such  areas  as  project \nmanagement  planning  and  administration,  financial  management  and  accounting,  community \nparticipation  techniques  and  gender  awareness,  data  collection  and  management,  public\u2013\nprivate  partnerships,  environmental  and  resettlement  issues,  and  such  technical  aspects  as \nmonitoring  water  quality  and  supervising  drilling  operations.  The  establishment  of  a  strategic \nunit  on  RWSS  and  a  development  partners  forum  will  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  sector  by \nproviding  new  opportunities  for  better  flow  of  information  among  all  stakeholders,  increased \ncoordination and sharing of good practices and lessons learned.    \n \n58. \nEconomic Benefits. The economic benefits of the water supply component include both \ncost savings relative to current water use and welfare improvements from increased water use. \nWater supplied by the Project has a lower total economic cost (based on storage costs and time \nspent  in  collection)  than  current  supplies,  so  the  Project  will  reduce  the  resources  that \nhouseholds are required to commit to maintain their current, minimal water use. The lower cost \nwill  enable  households  to  increase  their  water  consumption,  providing  additional  benefits  that \nwould  not  be  available  without  the  Project.  The  economic  analyses  of  sample  subprojects \nconfirm that the Project's benefits will exceed its costs. It shows that the proposed investments \nfor each village have a strong economic basis, with an economic internal rate of return of 19.5\u2013\n23.9%, well above the assumed economic opportunity cost of capital of 12%. As the benefit-cost \nanalysis  did  not  include  many  potentially  important  environmental  and  health  benefits,  the \neconomic internal rate of return is a conservative estimate of economic benefits in each village. \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\nDetails of subproject economic analysis are in Appendix 14. Communities will be responsible for \nchoosing from among the available options the water supply system that best suits their needs \nand circumstances. Construction and O&M costs will be significant factors contributing to their \ndecisions. Household surveys undertaken during the PPTA suggest that the average willingness \nto  pay  a  monthly  fee  is  sufficient  to  finance  the  O&M  costs  of  most  technical  options.  The \napplication of the economic criteria described in Appendix 14 identifies the least-cost option for \neach  village.  However,  villages  can  opt  for  a  higher-level  system  that  provides  easier  access \nand costs more, as long as they agree to shoulder the additional costs. \n \nB. \n\nRisks \n\n59. \nChanges  to  the  Decentralization  and  Deconcentration  Processes.  The  Project \nassumes continued Government support for the decentralization and deconcentration policies. \nHowever, uncertainty exists regarding the modalities and depth of these policies that may affect \nthe  responsibilities  of  provincial  or  commune  authorities.  The  Project  has  been  designed  with \nenough flexibility to allow a smooth transition to a different model and easy adaptation of project \nimplementation arrangements.  \n \n60. \nLack of WSUG Participation and Ownership Negatively Affect the Sustainability of \nthe Systems. The social cohesion required within the WSUGs to manage RWSS schemes on a \nsustainable basis is not always present in the rural communities in Cambodia. The community \nmobilization  component  will  support  the  establishment  and  sound  operation  of  the  WSUG  to \nensure  that  they  mobilize  sufficient  resources  and  are  willing  to  pay  their  O&M  costs.  Each \nWSUG  will  cofinance,  participate  in  the  design  of,  and  take  full  responsibility  for  the  O&M  of \nRWSS facilities to ensure its long-term sustainability. A contribution plan is in Appendix 15. \n \n61. \nInsufficient Availability of Experienced and Efficient NGOs. The key to the effective \nempowering  of  communities  lies  with  NGOs.  However,  experienced  NGOs  are  generally \nexpensive  and  in  short  supply  in  Cambodia.  Intensive  training  of  NGOs,  coupled  with  close \nsupervision,  monitoring,  and  back-stopping,  will  be  required  to  ensure  quality  control  and \neffective  community  mobilization.  The  Project  has  allocated  sufficient  resources  to  intensively \ntrain NGOs and supervise their performance.  \n \n62. \nLack of Access to Safe Water Sources. For particular villages, especially those where \nsurface and shallow groundwater is of very poor quality due to higher contents of arsenic, iron, \nor other pollutants, or where the water table is very low, finding an appropriate and affordable \ntechnical solution for RWSS may be difficult. The Project will undertake an initial environmental \nscreening for each village before the communities finalize a WSSVP. Pilot groundwater testing \nwill be done under the Project for the difficult cases, and new technologies will be tested. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n63. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\nWithin  3  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  MRD  will  have  established  an  RWSS \nstrategic  unit  with  two  full-time  professional  staff  in  charge  of  developing  an \nRWSS strategy and a set of guidelines for its effective implementation. MRD will \nalso  establish,  within  6  months  of  the  effective  date,  an  RWSS  development \n\n\f \n\n19\n\npartners\u2019 forum with representatives of the key development partners and NGOs \nactive  in  the  Cambodian  RWSS  sector,  to  support  the  work  of  the  RWSS \nstrategic unit. \n\n \n(ii)  Within  24  months  of  the  grant  effectiveness,  MRD  will  have  promulgated  an \n\nRWSS strategy. \n\n \n\n(iii)  Within  36  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  and  pursuant  to  the  RWSS  strategy \nreferred  to  above,  MRD  will  promulgate  the  following:  (a)  guidelines  on \nmainstreaming  gender  in  the  RWSS  sector,  (b)  guidelines  on  community \nparticipation for RWSS systems, (c) guidelines on contributions and subsidies for \nRWSS  systems,  (d)  guidelines  on  private  sector  participation  in  RWSS,  (e) \nguidelines  on  planning  for  the  RWSS  sector,  (f)  guidelines  on  water  monitoring \nand  water  quality  testing,  (g)  guidelines  on  participatory  monitoring  and \nevaluation,  and  (h)  guidelines  on  the  O&M  of  RWSS.  In  the  same  timeframe, \nMRD will update the 1995 Guidelines on Water Use and Hygiene Education. \n\n \n(iv)  MRD will ensure that the contribution of WSUGs cover at least the cost of O&M \nof the RWSS systems. PDRDs will provide technical support to the communities \nin the project areas to ensure continued O&M of the systems. \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\nMRD will ensure that the gender action plan agreed by the Government and ADB \nis fully implemented. This includes, but is not limited to, ensuring that (a) at least \n40% of each WSUG board is female, and (b) women account for 50% of WSUG \nboard  members  trained  in  water  supply  O&M.  MRD  will  ensure  that  contracts \nwith  NGOs  carrying  out  community  mobilization  require  that  (a)  at  least  25%  of \nthe NGOs\u2019 community mobilization team is female; (b) the training carried out by \nNGOs  and  the  PIU  as  part  of  the  skills  development  subcomponent  is  directed \ntoward  the  poor  and  vulnerable,  and  that  at  least  40%  of  those  trained  are \nfemale; and (c) at least 40% of all hygiene and sanitation education participants \nare male. \n\nits \n\nthat \n\nlaws  and \n\nregulations  governing \nThe  Government  will  ensure \nenvironmental impact assessments, as well as ADB's Environment Policy (2002), \nare  followed.  If  there  are  any  discrepancy  between  the  Government  laws  and \nregulations  and  ADB's  Environment  Policy,  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy \nrequirements will apply. Each PIU will conduct an environmental assessment for \neach subproject based on the EARF and will prepare an IEE based on a cluster \nof subprojects. MRD will ensure that IEEs (a) are based on the sample IEE made \nduring project preparation, (b) meet ADB\u2019s Environment Policy requirements, (c) \ninclude details of local consultation carried out, and (d) are submitted to ADB for \napproval  prior  to  civil  works  contracts  being  awarded  for  the  subproject  if  any \ncritical  environmental  issues  are  recognized.  The  Government  must  provide \ncertification that unexploded ordnance has been cleared before it submits an IEE \nto  ADB  for  approval\u2014or,  if  an  IEE  has  already  been  approved,  before \ncommencement of civil works. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  all  LARPs  are  approved  by  ADB  prior  to  the \naward of civil works contracts for clusters of subprojects, in accordance with the \nLARF  agreed  upon  by \nlaws, \nregulations, and procedures, and ADB\u2019s requirements as defined in ADB\u2019s Policy \n\nthe  Government  and  ADB,  Government\u2019s \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n64. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\non  Involuntary  Resettlement.  In  case  of  discrepancies  between  Government\u2019s \nlaws, regulations, and procedures and ADB\u2019s requirements, the latter will apply. \n\nin  project  activities, \n\n \n(viii)  The  Government  will  promote  the  full  participation  of  ethnic  minorities  and \nthings, \nindigenous  peoples \ndeveloping  mechanisms  to  include  them  in  capacity  building  and  training  under \nthe  Project.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  activities  are  consistent  with \nADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  and  that  participation  in  the  Project  is \nappropriately  adapted  to  meet  the  particular  needs  of  areas  with  a  high \nproportion of ethnic minority people. The WSUG board will be representative of \nethnic composition of the WSUG. \n\nincluding,  among  other \n\nB. \n\nConditions for Grant Effectiveness \n\nThe following are conditions for grant effectiveness: \n\nMRD will have revised the Guidelines on the Establishment of WSUG (dated 21 \nAugust  2004)  including,  but  not  limited  to,  the  organization  and  registration, \nstatutes, rights and responsibilities of a WSUG and its members, and the election \nand composition of WSUGs board, to the satisfaction of ADB. \n\nEach PIU will have established procurement committees and an NGO selection \ncommittee in accordance with Government regulations. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n65. \nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove the grant not exceeding $18 million equivalent to the Government of Cambodia for the \nTonle  Sap  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources, on terms and conditions substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nGrant Agreement presented to the Board. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nJoseph Eichenberger \nVice President \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n27 September 2005  \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n21\n\nRURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR ANALYSIS \n\nSector Profile \n\n \nA. \n \nRural Water Supply and Sanitation Coverage. Despite increased access to services, \n1. \nCambodia  has  one  of  the  lowest  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  (RWSS)  service  levels  in \nSoutheast Asia. Access to safe water in rural areas stands at 31.7%, and access to sanitation at \n12.5%,  according  to  the  Sector  Investment  Plan  20051  (Table  1).  In  the  five  provinces \nparticipating in the Tonle Sap Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project (the Project)\u2014\nBattambang, Kampong Chhnang, Kampong Thom, Pursat, and Siem Reap\u2014the rate of access \nto  safe  water  is  20.0%  and  to  sanitation  is  9.6%.  The  safe  water  indicators  are  the  use  of \nprotected  water  sources  (protected  wells,  tube  wells,  or  piped  water  systems),  and  the \nsanitation  indicators  refer  to  the  use  of  household  latrines.  The  present  coverage  data  vary \ngreatly  according  to  the  source2.  As  a  result,  the  estimates  of  access  to  safe  water  and \nsanitation may be overoptimistic, and the actual sustained coverage is probably lower.  \n \n\nTable A1.1: Rural Water and Sanitation Coverage in Cambodian Provinces \n(%) \n\n \n\nRural Households with Access \nto Safe Drinking Water \n\n \nArea Name \nBanteay Meanchey \nBattambang \nKampong Cham \nKampong Chhnang \nKampong Speu \nKampong Thom \nKampot \nKandal \nKoh Kong \nKratie \nMondul Kiri \nOddar Meanchey \nPhnom Penh rural \nPreah Vihear \nPrey Veng \nPursat \nRatanak Kiri \nSiemreap \nStung Treng \nSvay Rieng \nTakeo \nAverage for Cambodia \nSource: Ministry of Rural Development (MRD). 2005.

Since 1989, \nconsiderable  financial  and  technical  efforts  have  been  made  in  the  sector  to  increase  the \n\n                                                 \n1  Ministry  of  Rural  Development.  2005.

However,  many  of  these  wells  do  not  function  because  of \nmaintenance  problems  arising  from  the  weaknesses  of  the  community  management  systems \nand the lack of spare parts. The need exists to introduce stronger mechanisms for maintenance, \nencourage  the  participation  of  the  private  sector,  intensify  contributions  to  operation  and \nmaintenance, and develop a spare-parts network on a market basis. \n \n3. \nSanitation. Latrine use is uncommon in most rural areas of Cambodia. The high cost of \nlatrines ($50 for the most common pour-flush latrine) and the lack of information and awareness \non water use and hygiene are the major obstacles to the dissemination of latrines in rural areas. \nSanitation facilities are generally considered a lower priority than water supply systems. For this \nreason, the Department of Rural  Health Care (DRHC) of  MRD and several agencies, such as \nthe  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF),  have  recently  focused  on  education  and \nawareness to stimulate demand for adequate sanitation facilities. \n \n4. \nHealth  and  Hygiene  Education.  Most  rural  Cambodians  are  unaware  of  the  adverse \nhealth  effects  of  unsafe  water  use  and  the  lack  of  hygiene.  They  continue  to  drink  untreated \nsurface  water,  prefer  to  defecate  in  the  open,  and  rarely  wash  their  hands  (less  than  half  use \nsoap  in  the  project  provinces).  DRHC  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  have \ndeveloped  several  information,  education  and  communication  (IEC)  materials,  but  financial \nsupport has been insufficient to organize comprehensive countrywide education campaigns. \n \n5. \nGovernment  Goals.  In  line  with  the  Cambodia  Millennium  Development  Goals \n(CMDGs),3  the  primary  objective  of  the  Government  is  to  improve  the  well-being  of  people \nthroughout  the  country,  with  a  focus  on  the  rural  areas  home  to  85%  of  the  population.  The \nGovernment  has  developed  the  national  water  supply  and  sanitation  policy  (NWSSP),  which \nhas established the objective that \u201cevery person in rural communities has sustained access to \nsafe water supply and sanitation services and [is] living in a hygienic environment by 2025\u201d and \nis committed to expanding improved water supply coverage from 24% in 1998 to 50% in 2015, \nand  sanitation  coverage  from  8.6%  in  1998  to  30.0%  in  2015,  according  to  the  RWSS  Sector \nInvestment Plan 2005\u20132015. \n \nB. \n \n6. \nAgencies  Involved  in  Rural  Water  Supply.  Several  government  agencies  are \nresponsible for the provision, management, and regulation of water. The overall water sector is \ndivided  into  different  areas,  with  a  lead  agency  generally  responsible  for  each.  The  Sector \nCoordinating Committee for the Development of Water Supply and Sanitation is chaired by the \nMinistry  of  Industry,  Mines  and  Energy  (MIME).  The  Committee  includes  11  other  institutions, \nnamely (i) MRD (vice chair), (ii) Ministry of Public Works and Transport (vice chair), (iii) Ministry \nof Water Resources and Meteorology (MOWRAM), (iv) Ministry of Health (MOH), (v) Ministry of \nEnvironment,  (vi)  Council  of  Ministers,  (vii)  Council  for  the  Development  of  Cambodia,  (viii) \nMinistry  of  Economy  and  Finance,  (ix)  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  (x)  Phnom  Penh  Water  Supply \nAuthority, and (xi) Ministry of Planning. \n \nCentral Government Agencies. The various government ministries and agencies with \n7. \nwater sector-related responsibilities are MRD, MOWRAM, MIME, and to a lesser extent MOH. \nMOWRAM  has  overall  responsibility  for  water  resource  planning  and  management.  MRD  is \nspecifically responsible for RWSS. MIME is in charge of water supplies to provincial and small \ntowns, as well as the regulation of the private sector involved in piped water systems. Although \n\nSector Institutions  \n\n                                                 \n3  Ministry of Planning. 2003. Cambodian Millennium Development Goals (targets 7.10 and 7.12). Phnom Penh. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n23\n\nthe mandate of each ministry is fairly clear, there remains an overlap in responsibilities on the \nground  that  can  be  subjected  to  ad  hoc  agreements  between  the  concerned  ministries.  For \nexample, community-owned small-scale piped water systems remain in the scope of MRD, but \nMIME has responsibility for privately owned piped water systems regardless of location, based \non an agreement between MRD and MIME signed in February 2005. MOH is responsible for the \nquality of public water supply sources, while MIME has set the drinking water quality standards. \n \n8. \nInter-ministerial relationships remain weak, partly due to the requirement that staff follow \nwell-established  vertical  lines  of  communication.  Exchange  of  data  or  information  is  slow  and \noften limited. Although MOWRAM and MRD have shared a groundwater database since 1994, \nand  MRD  keeps  a  separate  record  of  wells  installed  with  the  support  of  UNICEF  and  other \nagencies, these records are incomplete. All existing data need to be verified and updated. The \ninformation  is  inadequate  for  managing  the  RWSS  sector  because  of  the  short  periods  of \nobservation,  insufficient  monitoring  sites,  or  lost  records.  This  weakness  is  recognized  by  the \nGovernment, and steps are being taken to reestablish national capacity to acquire and manage \ndata and information related to RWSS and the environment. \n \n9. \nMinistry of Rural Development. MRD was established in 1994 with staff originating in \nother ministries (the water supply and sanitation department come from MOH). The role of MRD \nnationally  is  to  plan  and  coordinate  assistance  to  the  RWSS  sector,  though  it  still  carries  out \nsome well drilling and installation. Within MRD, responsibilities for RWSS are shared between \nthe Department of Rural Water Supply and DRHC, which is responsible for sanitation and health \neducation.  While  these  departments  have  gained  some  knowledge  of  rural  development  by \nworking  on  projects  with  NGOs  and  bilateral  development  agencies  over  the  years,  they  still \nneed  considerable  capacity  building  and  assistance,  especially  provincially.  MRD,  like  other \ngovernment agencies, has traditionally been an implementer, with operational drilling teams and \nequipment.  Following  the  new  NWSSP  signed  in  February  2003,  the  ministry  is  increasingly \ntaking on policy, planning and regulatory functions, while construction, supervision, and service \nprovision are gradually being taken over by private enterprises. \n \n10. \nProvincial Structures. MRD implements projects either through provincial departments \nof  rural  development  (PDRDs)  or  provincial  rural  development  committees  (PRDCs).  PDRDs \nare  deconcentrated  provincial  agencies  of  MRD  that  implement  projects  in  direct collaboration \nwith commune councils and village development committees (VDCs) where they exist. PDRDs \nhave six sections, namely: (i) rural water supply, (ii) rural health care, (iii) rural credit, (iv) rural \nroads, (v) rural community development, and (vi) administration and finances. They have 40\u201380 \nstaff  members,  depending  on  the  importance  of  the  province,  of  whom  many  are  attached  to \nprojects  or  NGOs  when  not  on  leave  for  private  sector  activities.  PRDCs,  chaired  by  the \ngovernor and constituted by representatives of seven provincial line agencies (health, women\u2019s \naffairs,  rural  development,  agriculture,  water  resources,  planning,  and \ninterior),  bear \nresponsibility  for  coordinating  development  initiatives  through  the  formulation  of  the  provincial \nstrategic  development  plan  and  the  provincial  investment  plan.  As  such,  all  qualifying \ninvestments  are  referred  to  PRDCs  to  ensure  compliance  with  provincial  plans.  The  PDRD \ndirector is vice chair of the PRDC. The executive committee of the PRDC is in charge of PRDC \noperational activities. \n \n11. \nDistrict  Structures.  The  district  office  of  rural  development,  which  is  part  of  MRD, \nperforms PDRD functions in districts. The office is underutilized, however, as projects generally \nintervene directly with the commune councils, village chiefs, and VDCs. \n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nCommune  Councils.  The  election  of  commune  councils  in  2002  gave  them  greater \n12. \nresponsibilities  regarding  the  planning,  implementation,  and  financing  of  rural  infrastructure. \nEvery  year,  commune  councils  plan  and  formulate  their  needs  and  submit  them  to  the \nGovernment  and  donors.  The  Government  gives  each  commune  council  $6,000\u2013$10,000  per \nyear for district workshops and rural projects. However, the analysis of commune plans shows \nthat RWSS receives less consideration than other infrastructure such as roads. \n \n13. \nVillages  Structures.  The  village  institutional  framework  remains  generally  weak. \nCommittee members of the village development committees are volunteers who were not part of \nthe Government structure. In the commune planning process, the identification and planning of \nprojects  are  now  the  responsibility  of  planning  and  budgeting  committees,  which  include \ncommune  council  members  and  two  representatives  from  each  village,  one  male  and  one \nfemale. \n \n14.  Water and Sanitation Users Groups. In line with the NWSSP, responsibility for RWSS \nlies  with  water  and  sanitation  user  groups  (WSUGs),  which  have  the  authority  to  perform \nmanagerial tasks and carry out the operation and maintenance of the systems. MRD has issued \nguidelines  for  establishing  WSUGs.  The  ownership  of  systems,  agreements  with  the  private \nsector, and legal aspects regarding the user service remain the responsibility of communes. \n \nLocal  NGOs  and  Entrepreneurs.  Local  NGOs  and  entrepreneurs  are  becoming  more \n15. \nactively involved in the provision of RWSS services. However, capacity in this area is limited as \nthe business environment essential to successful large-scale involvement remains hampered by \na  lack  of  business  services  or  affordable  credit,  and  by  unclear  regulations  regarding  the \nparticipation  of  the  private  sector  in  infrastructure  development.  MRD  realizes  that  engaging \nlocal NGOs and the private sector in the provision of services is needed if sector targets are to \nbe met, and it is including provision in sector plans and strategies for this eventuality.  \n \nCoordination  in  the  Sector  on  Technical  Issues.  The  RWSS  sector  working  group, \n16. \nchaired  by  the  director  of  DRWS,  includes  NGOs  and  meets  every  month  to  discuss  RWSS \ntechnical  issues.  The  water  use  and  health  education  forum  is  an  annual  event  organized \nnationally by DRHC to disseminate information and share the experiences of sector initiatives. \nHowever,  no  entity  currently  exists  to  coordinate  the  implementation  of  policy  and  the \npreparation of the strategy and guidelines. \n \n17. \nThe Institutional Development Plan. The Institutional Development Plan for the RWSS \nSector (2003\u20132007) prepared by MRD stresses that a major retraining and recruitment will be \nneeded  for  MRD  and  PDRDs.  Retraining  will  be  based  on  a  needs  assessment  indicating \nrequired competencies for jobs in rural development, especially RWSS. The needs assessment \nwill also suggest the optimal way to achieve the required competency. Capacity building within \nall  levels  of  MRD  will  aim  to  strengthen  MRD  and  PDRDs  and  enable  them  to  make  the \ntransition from their traditional role of implementer to that of facilitator. Their emerging role will \nrequire  them  to  be  able  to  collaborate  with  other  partners  that  enjoy  comparative  advantages, \nsuch  as  the  private  sector,  whose  advantage  is  in  the  technical  area,  and  NGOs,  whose \nadvantage is in community mobilization.  \n \nC. \n \nRWSS  in  the  Overall  Government  Policy:    RWSS  has  been  an  integral  part  of  the \n18. \nGovernment\u2019s  overall  strategy  for  rural  development  and  poverty  reduction.  The  Rectangular \n\nSector Policies, Strategies, and Plans \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n25\n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nStrategy4 states that \u201cthe Royal Government of Cambodia will focus on providing all citizens with \nclean  and  safe  water,  protecting  all  citizens  from  water  related  diseases,  providing  adequate \nwater supply to ensure food security economic activities and appropriate living standards.\u201d The \nNational  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy5  states  that  \u201cRWSS  is  a  key  effort  of  the  Royal \nGovernment  of  Cambodia  policy  aimed  at  poverty  reduction,\u201d  and  the  Cambodian  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals note that \u201cincreasing the proportion of rural population with access to safe \nwater  to  50%  in  2015,  and  access  to  sanitation  to  30%  in  2015,  place  [a]  high  priority  on \nRWSS.\u201d \n \n19. \nThe Sector Policy. The National Water and Sanitation Policy prepared jointly by MIME \nand MRD in February 2003 states that every rural Cambodian should have access to safe water \nand sanitation in 2025 and insists on three major aspects:  \n \n \n\nthe  role  of  the  ministries  as  regulatory  and  monitoring  agencies  as  opposed  to \ntheir previous role in direct implementation;  \n\n(i) \n\nthe provision of RWSS services based on user demand, a process that includes \n\u201cvoice  and  choice\u201d  in  technology  selection  and  the  willingness  of  the  users  to \nshare the related cost; and  \n\nthe importance of private sector participation.  \n\n \n \n20. \nThe policy recognizes the importance of four major guiding principles: (i) the social and \neconomic value of water, (ii) the promotion of safe behaviour, (iii) the importance of sustainable \nmanagement  of  rural  water  resources,  and  (iv)  community  participation  and  local  decision \nmaking. \n \n21. \nStrategy  and  Guidelines.  Following  the  approval  of  the  policy,  MRD  has  initiated  the \nprocess  of  developing  and  adapting  guidelines,  especially  regarding  informed  choice  and \nprivate sector participation. However, MRD has not yet developed an overall RWSS strategy to \nimplement the policy, and only a few guidelines have been developed. Several implementation \nmanuals  have  been  prepared  to  classify  and  guide  RWSS  contractors  with  the  support  of \nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (the French Development Agency). Guidelines regarding \nthe  establishment  of  water  user  groups  were  prepared  by  MRD  in  2004,  but  they  must  be \nimproved to clarify the roles and responsibilities of WSUGs. The Water and Sanitation Program \nand UNICEF have provided regular support to MRD regarding sanitation guidelines. \n \nRWSS  Investment  Plan:  2005\u20132015.  MRD  approved  a  sector  investment  plan  in \n22. \nJanuary 2005. The plan describes overall sector financing requirements and expected levels of \ncoverage  based  on  the  CMDGs:  50%  of  rural  population  with  access  to  safe  water,  and  30% \nwith  access  to  improved  sanitation,  by  2015  (present  levels,  based  on  the  Inter-Censal \nPopulation  Survey  2004,  are  31.7%  with  access  to  safe  water  and  12.5%  with  sanitation \ncoverage). Resources equivalent to $116 million in capital investment costs and $4.8 million of \nrecurrent  costs  will  be  needed  to  reach  the  objectives  by  2015.  Communities  are  expected  to \ncontribute  33%  (covering  the  maintenance  cost  of  water  facilities,  and  total  investment  and \nmaintenance costs of sanitation), government 9%, and external assistance 58%. \n \n \n                                                 \n4  Royal Government of Cambodia. 2004.

Community-based  systems  will  not  necessarily \nensure  sustainability  unless  the  incentives  are  properly  addressed  in  the  project  design  and \nimplementation. The impact assessment1 of a rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) project, \ncarried  out  in  130  selected  villages  in  the  poorest  areas  of  six  provinces  of  Cambodia,  found \nthat  water  supply  systems  solely  managed  by  a  community  structure  failed  shortly  after  their \nconstruction.  Except  where  there  are  active  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  rural \nCambodians rarely act as communities. The above survey also found that the externally driven \ncommunity-based organizations, such as water point committees created to manage the hand \npumps,  failed  to  perform  their  management  functions  effectively,  despite  a  strong  capacity-\nbuilding process in the program, when the water points were placed on public land. In contrast, \nthe community systems constructed on private land or managed by a member of the community \nwith  a  direct  personal  interest  in  the  management  of  the  system  is  better  maintained  and,  in \nmost cases, accessible by all.  \n \n2. \nInclude a wide range of simple technology options for open choice by communities and \nhouseholds.  As  most  wells  will  be  maintained  by  local  people,  technologies  recommended  for \nthe systems should be locally appropriate. Direct access and easy availability of spare parts at \naffordable prices should be guaranteed. In certain areas where sparse coverage is due to the \nlack  of  suitable  options  or  equipment,  it  is  necessary  to  test  new  solutions  and  prepare \npackages of civil works contracts that allow the private sector to buy adequate equipment. The \nchoice  of  options,  especially  for  deep  pumps,  should  be  open,  and  people  should  decide  the \ntype  of  equipment  they  are  ready  to  pay  for.  Type  of  deep  pumps  that  were  promoted  in \nCambodia,  with  the  aim  of  facilitating  maintenance,  has  had  its  limitations  and  has  not \ngenerated  the  expected  countrywide  deep-pump  spare-part  network.  The  Project  will  offer  a \nrange options with different costs, and water and sanitation user groups (WSUGs) will choose. \n \n3. \nEncourage  private  sector  participation  in  the  management  of  piped  water  systems. \nWhereas  rural  communities  have  difficulties  managing  community  infrastructure  and  collecting \nlocal  contributions,  rural  Cambodians  are  well  disposed  toward  private  sector  participation. \nThere are many successful private sector initiatives in rural water supply (private vendors, small \npiped water systems). In the case of rural piped water systems managed by the private sector,2 \nsatisfaction  and  payment  rates  are  excellent,  respectively  85%  and  99%.  The  assistance  of \nprivate  sector  in  managing  community  water  infrastructure  offers  a  chance  to  increase  the \nsustainability of water systems, with appropriate conditions guaranteeing access for the poorest \nresidents. The Project will provide training to private sector operators and develop a database of \ncompanies to facilitate private sector participation. \n \nStress the importance of operation and maintenance (O&M) of RWSS facilities. Projects \n4. \nand  NGOs  have  provided  free  water  equipment  without  any  consideration  for  the  necessity  of \ncovering the cost of O&M, even when people were willing and able to pay. Water infrastructure \nwill  be  sustainable  only  if  rural  people  pay  for  O&M,  with  access  conditional  upon  effective \npayment,  except  for  the  very  poor.  The  Project  will  include  an  awareness  campaign  on  the \neconomic value of water and encourage WSUGs to take full financial responsibility for the O&M \nof water supply systems. \n                                                           \n1   Kosan Engineering. 2001.

Phnom Penh. \n\n2    Program  for  small  piped  water  systems  implemented  by  the  Research  and  Technological  Exchange  Group  and \n\nKosan Engineering in Takeo and Kampot provinces. \n\n\f \n28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n5. \nIntegrate  water,  sanitation,  and  hygiene  education  in  RWSS  projects.  In  many  cases, \nimproving community water supply does not result in full economic and health benefits due to a \nlack of attention to hygiene education and sanitation. The very low level of sanitation awareness \nin rural Cambodia hinders the development of good sanitation practices and the improvement of \npublic  and  household  sanitation  infrastructure.  In  rural  areas,  few  people  are  aware  of  the \nrelationship  between  good  sanitation  practices  and  improved  health.  Very  few  people  use \nlatrines, regularly clean water jars, boil drinking water, or use soap when washing their hands. \nThe  Project  will  implement  a  national  campaign  that  aims  to  change  hygiene  behavior  with \npractical  information  and  demonstrations.  The  Project  will  include  a  comprehensive  sanitation \nawareness  campaign  in  the  participating  provinces,  to  take  place  before  or  during  the \ndevelopment of sanitation infrastructure. \n \n6. \nEncourage  the  deconcentration  and  decentralization  of  decision  making.  International \nexperience  shows  that  planning  and  managing  RWSS  is  better  done  by  local  authorities  and \ncommunities, with the central Government taking the role or regulator and policy developer. The \nProject  will  promote  the  current  decentralization  process,  which  gives  more  power  to  the \ncommunes to decide their priorities and enter into contracts directly with NGOs and the private \nsector.  The  selection  of  projects  will  be  done,  in  principle,  through  the  current  commune \nplanning  process.  The  Project  will  also  promote  deconcentration  from  the  center  to  the \nprovinces. Planning and supervision of project implementation will be done provincially.  \n \n7. \nPlace  the  community  at  the  forefront  of  decision  making  and  management  and \nencourage  community  contributions.  The  participation  of  communities  is  a  key  condition  for \nsustainable RWSS systems. The Project will place villages and commune councils at the center \nof  the  decision-making  process  regarding  the  selection,  preparation,  and  implementation  of \nsubprojects.  The  Project  will  help  villages  and  commune  councils  understand  and  actively \nparticipate in all the phases of the project cycle. WSUGs will contribute 10% of the capital cost \nof water supply infrastructure and about 50% of the capital cost of sanitation facilities. Villages \nand communes will prepare and approve village water and sanitation plans with the assistance \nof NGOs. To improve the transparency of the process, special procedures will be put in place to \nreceive and deal with complaints from local individuals openly and fairly. \n \n8. \nRecognize women as the primary users of water, hygiene educators, and managers of \nRWSS  systems,  and  involve  women  in  their  development  and  O&M.  Although  women\u2019s \npriorities are often tied to the provision of water supply and private latrines, their formal role in \nRWSS  remains  limited.  The  Project  will  mainstream  gender  at  the  institutional  level  and \nenhance women\u2019s role in daily decision making and technical skills development. It will build the \ncapacity  of  the  gender  working  group  within  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  by  developing \nnational  guidelines  for  gender  mainstreaming  in  RWSS.  The  Project  will  encourage  the  equal \nparticipation and representation of women in formal decision-making units at all administrative \nlevels. As discussions with school officials reveal that girls, especially adolescent girls, are often \nshy  to  use  the  same  block  of  latrine  facilities  as  boys,  the  Project  will  construct  and  locate \nseparate school latrines that are clearly marked for girls.  \n \n9. \nDevelop  partnerships  and  information  sharing  among  all  stakeholders  to  benefit  the \nRWSS  sector.  Several  pilot  projects  involving  local  partnerships  between  communes,  NGOs, \nand  the  private  sector  have  improved  RWSS  sustainability.  Nationally,  the  organization  of \nworkshops  between  the  different  government  ministries,  NGOs,  and  development  partners  for \nthe preparation of the NWSSP has been very beneficial to the sector. The Project will promote \nthe establishment of partnerships nationally and locally.  \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n  29\n\nData \nSources/Reporting \nMechanisms \n\u2022  Reports and \n\nstatistics from \ngovernment \nagencies, \ndevelopment \npartners, and \nNGOs \n\u2022  ADB project \nperformance \naudit report \n\n \nAssumptions and Risks \n\nAssumptions \n\u2022 \n\nThe Government is \ncommitted to the \nimplementation of the \nMDGs. \n\n\u2022  Communities have \n\nsustained interest in \nparticipating in the \nProject. \n\n\u2022  MRD reports \n\u2022  Quarterly reports \n\u2022  Project baseline \n\nsurvey \n\u2022  Data from \n\ncommune health \ncenters \n\u2022  Project \n\nevaluation after \nproject \ncompletion \n\n\u2022  External \n\nevaluation \n\n \n\n \n\u2022  Commune \n\ninvestment plans \n\n\u2022  Commune \nreports \n\u2022  Project \n\nmonitoring  \nreports \n\u2022  NGO reports \n \n\n \n\n \n\nAssumptions \n\u2022  MRD is committed to \nimplementing the \nproject goals. \n\u2022  Communities will \ncontribute and \nparticipate. \n\nAssumption \n\u2022  NGOs are committed \nto the Project and will \ncollaborate with the \nGovernment. \n\n \nRisks \n\u2022  WSUGs may not \nfunction because \nvillagers have little \nexperience working \ntogether in an \norganized manner. \nLocal people may be \noverburdened by \nparticipation in and \ncontributions to the \nProject. \n\n\u2022 \n\n \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \n\nImpact \nImproved health and quality of \nlife for rural people in line with \nthe Cambodian Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (CMDGs) \ntargets for safe water supply \nand sanitation (WSS) \n \n \n \n \n \n\nOutcome \nSustained access for all \ncommunities and their \nmembers, including the \npoorest, to safe water and \nsanitation and better hygiene  \n\nOutputs \nComponent 1: \nCommunity mobilization \nand skills development \n1.

The  SEDP  II  and  the  NPRS  introduced  new  approaches  to  development  planning,  including  open  and \nextensive  participation  by  stakeholders.  By  implementing  the  SEDP  II  and  the  NPRS,  the  Rectangular  Strategy \nfocuses  on  promoting  economic  growth  through  agriculture,  infrastructure,  private  sector  growth  and  employment, \nand  human  resource  development.  The  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  overarching  goal  for  Cambodia,  as \ndefined  in  its  Country  Strategy  and  Programa,  is  sustainable  poverty  reduction.  The  CSP  is  in  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  Rectangular  Strategy  and  focuses  on  (i)  broad-based  economic  growth,  (ii)  inclusive  social \ndevelopment,  and  (iii)  good  governance.  Provision  of  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  (RWSS)  facilities  is \nhighlighted  as  a  means  by  which  inclusive  social  development  can  be  achieved.  The  CSP  also  stresses  four \ncrosscutting themes\u2014governance, private sector development, gender, and the environment\u2014that help support the \npoverty reduction objectives of the Rectangular Strategy. The Project will support the development of RWSS in five \nprovinces  around  the  Tonle  Sap  basin:  Battambang,  Kampong  Chhnang,  Kampong  Thom,  and  Siem  Reap.  b The \ngeographical focus is consistent with the CSP and the Tonle Sap Initiative (2005). The Project will also contribute to \nthe  achievement  of  the  Cambodian  Millennium  Development  Goals  (CMDGs)  to  provide,  by  2015,  access  to  safe \nwater to 50% of rural residents and access to sanitation facilities to 30% of rural residents.  \n\n \n\n \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\nTargeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n\nB. \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nCambodia had a total population of 13 million in 2004, with an annual population growth rate of 1.8%. The country\u2019s \ngross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average rate of 5.2% in 2003, with a GDP per capita of $296. The highest \ngrowth was seen in agriculture. About 84% of the population resides in rural areas, with a population density of 268 \npersons per km2 of arable land. The Tonle Sap basin covers about 44% of Cambodia's total area and has about one \nthird of the country\u2019s total population. During 1993\u20131999, Cambodia experienced a slight reduction in poverty from \n39% to 36%. c  The poverty rate is estimated at 29.7% in urban areas and at 40.1% in rural areas. Rural households \n(i.e., those whose primary source of income is agriculture) account for almost 90% of the total poor. The net primary \nschool  enrollment  rate  increased  from  76%  in  1997  to  91%  in  2003.  Under-5  child  mortality  remained  at  120  per \n1,000 live births. From 1995 to 2000, maternal mortality fell from 590 to 437 per 100,000 live births. \n \nCambodia has one of the lowest levels of water and sanitation coverage in southeast Asia. According to the RWSS \nSector Investment Plan (SIP, 2005\u20132015), an estimated 31.7% of the rural population has access to safe water, and \n12.5% to sanitation. The development of RWSS improves the health of the rural people by reducing the incidence of \nwater-related diseases and the associated costs of health care and treatment. RWSS contributes to the economic \nproductivity of men and women, especially in terms of time savings, and it reduces burden of labor. It also provides \nopportunities for private sector participation in the development of rural infrastructure and generates employment in \nrural communities for construction, operation and maintenance. \n \nThe Project is expected to meet the CMDGs in the five provinces by providing, by 2011, safe water to 1.09 million \nrural  people  and  latrine  access  to  0.72  million  rural  people.  The  current  rural  population  in  the  five  provinces  is \nestimated to  be 2.96 million in 2005 and expected to reach 3.36 million  by 2011. The  Project  will rehabilitate  and \nupgrade existing  water supply  and sanitation infrastructure and provide capital for  new  community  and household \ninfrastructure.  Family  water  supply  systems  will  be  provided  when  community  options  are  not  possible.  Project \ncomponents  include  (i)  community  mobilization  and  skills  development,  (ii)  development  of  water  supply  systems; \n(iii)  development  of  sanitation  facilities;  and  (iv)  capacity  building  and  implementation  support.  The  water  use  and \nhygiene education program will learn from past campaigns and coordinate with ongoing efforts.  \n \nThe five provinces were selected on the basis of their low RWSS coverage, high poverty rate, and population size, \nas  well  as  a  regional  focus.  The  poor  are  targeted  in  three  ways:  (i)  at  the  macro  level,  provinces  have  been \nselected based on high poverty incidence; (ii) at the meso level, the subproject pre-selection criteria will give priority \nto villages found in the poorest 20% of communes in each province; and (iii) at the micro level, villagers will identify \nthe  poorest  20%  of  residents  during  the  preparation  of  their  village  water  supply  and  sanitation  plans,  with  that \nidentification verified by the village chief, commune council, and participating NGOs. The Project will ensure that the \npoorest  households  are  exempt  from  cash  contribution  while  participating  in  a  water  and  sanitation  user  group \n(WSUG) or receiving a household solution. All households  will be able to select an effective sanitation option that \nthey can afford, as sanitation options are subsidized based on technology. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n  33\n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nA  stakeholder  analysis  was  conducted  for  the  Project  to  help  identify  the  key  project  stakeholders  and  their \ninterests.  Primary  stakeholders  include  rural  residents,  resettlement-affected  people,  the  poorest  people  and \nvulnerable  groups,  water  and  sanitation  users,  village  authorities,  planning  and  budgeting  committees,  commune \ncouncils,  the  private  sector,  gender  working  groups,  and  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  (MRD)  at  all \nadministrative levels. Secondary stakeholders include provincial rural development committees, the Inter-Ministerial \nResettlement  Committee,  mass  organizations,  and  relevant  line  agencies.  The  analysis  was  helpful  in  conducting \nstakeholder consultations during project preparation. \n \nThe  Project  was  developed  through  public  consultations,  workshops,  and  meetings  with  different  stakeholders. \nDuring  project  design,  community  meetings  were  held  with  potential  beneficiaries  to  discuss  water  supply  and \nsanitation issues, poverty levels, beneficiary contribution and affordability issues, land acquisition and environmental \nconcerns, hygiene practices, and operation and maintenance challenges. To complement the findings from surveys \ncompleted  in  Kampong  Thom  and  Pursat  in  2002,  additional  socioeconomic  surveys  were  conducted  in \nBattambang,  Kampong  Chhnang,  and  Siem  Reap  provinces.  Household  information  and  individual  views  were \ngathered on current water and sanitation situations and future preferences. Participatory rapid appraisal was used to \ncapture community attitudes and perceptions of water use and hygiene education. Consultations were also held with \nhouseholds  that  were  poor,  ethnically  diverse,  vulnerable,  and  headed  by  females.  Consultations  helped  in \ndesigning the component on community mobilization and skills development. Discussions and surveys also helped \ndetermine how much beneficiaries can afford to contribute to RWSS infrastructure. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nThe  Project  supports  community-based  public  services  that  will  enable  greater  village  participation  in  planning  to \nbetter respond to local needs. A participation strategy has been incorporated into the community mobilization and \nskills development component to help build community ownership of water supply systems and sanitation options. \nThe  component  takes  into  consideration  different  levels  of  cooperation  and  collaboration  among  stakeholders  in \ndeveloping village water supply and sanitation plans. For instance, a rapid appraisal will be conducted to identify (i) \nvillage  water  and  sanitation  needs;  (ii)  poor,  ethnic,  and  vulnerable  households;  (iii)  water  supply  and  sanitation \ncoverage  and  access;  and  (iv)  water  and  sanitation-related  illness.  Steps  for  stakeholder  participation  and \nconsultation  have  also  been  integrated  into  other  project  components  and  individual  social  plans.  Appendix  16 \ndescribes the different levels of beneficiary contributions.  \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No \n\nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nAbout 52% of the total population in the five provinces is female, with a male\u2013female ratio of 94:100 in 2005. The \npercentage of female-headed households (FHHs) in Cambodia was 29% in 2004, an increase from 26% in 1998. In \nthe five provinces, the percentage of FHHs was about 27%--higher than the national average of about 26% in 1998. \nWomen in Cambodia play important roles in the RWSS sector. In households, they are responsible for a variety of \ntasks related to water, sanitation, and hygiene (e.g., collection of water). Within MRD, a gender working group has \nbeen established to oversee the mainstreaming of gender into rural development activities. A gender analysis was \nconducted for the project to determine the water use and hygiene education needs of both men and women. Unsafe \nwater heavily infused  with iron or calcium may harm the health of  women (e.g., with reproductive tract infections). \nMost participants of hygiene education  programs are  women. Efforts to increase male  participation are needed. It \nwas  suggested  that  public  school  latrine  facilities  be  constructed  and  located  separately  for  girls.  This  would  help \nincrease latrine access and privacy for girls at schools, while positively influencing their enrollment rates. A gender \nanalysis and action plan has been prepared for the Project (see Appendix 6).  \n\nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nResettlement \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\n \n\nE.

A  sample  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  plan  has  not  been  prepared  as  the  location  of \nthese water supply systems and sanitation options is unknown. \nIssues pertaining to affordability are not expected to arise. The \nProject  has  prepared  standard  design  options  with  associated \ncost  estimates, \nlevels.  Water  user \nhouseholds will contribute 10% (3% cash and 7% in-kind) for a \nselected  water  supply  system  and  about  50%  (in-kind)  for \nsanitation  options,  depending  on  the  latrine  type  selected  and \nhousehold affordability. Through informed choice, communities \nwill  learn  about  the  different  options  and  select  water  supply \nsystem  and  sanitation  options  that  they  can  afford.  Additional \nsafeguards  are  in  place  to  ensure  equal  access  to  the  poor, \nethnic minorities, and other vulnerable groups.  \nLabor  is  not  a  potential  issue.  The  Project  helps  to  generate \nthe  construction, \nlocal  employment  opportunities  during \ncomponents. \noperation,  and  maintenance  of  project \nlivelihood \nCommunities  will  be \nopportunities  resulting \nto  water  and \nimproved sanitation (e.g., homestead gardening). Women, the \nto \npoor,  and  ethnic  minorities  will  have  equal  access \nemployment  opportunities.  In  particular,  the  poor  and  women \nwill  be  eligible  for  special  training  in  water  and  sanitation-\nrelated jobs created by the Project (e.g., technical skills training \nand  operation  and  maintenance).  The  private  sector  will  use \nlocal labor during civil works construction. \nEthnic  minority  groups  in  the  Project  area  include  the  Cham, \nChinese,  Thai,  and  Vietnamese.  A \nfew  households  of \nindigenous  Chorng,  Khuy,  and  Por  were  found  in  Pursat \nProvince  during  the  socioeconomic  survey.  The  Project  will \nbenefit  all  ethnic  minority  groups  and  indigenous  households \nequally.  Specific  actions  that  have  been  incorporated  into  the \nproject design  include (i) subproject selection criteria that give \nconsideration  to  ethnic  balance  in  the  selection  of  subproject \nvillages,  (ii)  village  mapping  that  identifies  where  different \nethnic groups live, (iii) WSUG boards that are representative of \nethnic  composition  of  its  WSUG  members;  (iv)  water  use  and \nhygiene  education  incorporating  the  water  and  sanitation \nneeds  of  different  ethnic  groups,  and  (v)  issues  of  ethnicity  in \nRWSS  incorporated  in  the  guidelines.  Water  supply  systems \nand  sanitation  options  will  not  discriminate  against  any \ncommunities or household due to ethnicity.  \nThe  increased  risk  to  HIV/AIDS  due  to  the  Project  is  minimal. \nTo  keep  risks  low,  the  Department  of  Rural  Health  Care \n(DRHC) within MRD will integrate HIV/AIDS awareness into its \nhealth  and  hygiene  programs.  The  Project  will  also  require \ncontractors  to  disseminate  HIV/AIDS  information  among  their \nlaborers, with the assistance of DRHC. \n\n \n\nPlan \nRequired \n\n \n\n Yes \n  No \n\n Yes \n  No  \n\n Yes \n  No  \n\n Yes \n  No  \n\na  ADB. 2005.

The  Project  is  expected  to \nprovide, by 2001, safe water to 1.09 million rural people and latrine access to 0.72 million rural \npeople.  A  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  has  been  prepared  to  highlight  the  different  rural  water \nsupply and sanitation (RWSS) needs of men and women in Cambodia. It also helps to ensure \nthat  both  men  and  women  have  equal  opportunities  for  employment  and  to  participate  in \ntraining  at  all  levels.  The  GAP  is  based  on  gender  analysis  prepared  for  the  Project,  and  is \ndesigned according to ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nFemales make up 51.5% of the total population in the project area. About 85% of the \ntotal population resides in rural areas. The male:female ratio is estimated at 94:100 in 2005. \nLife  expectancy  in  the  project  provinces  is  62  years  for  women  and  56  years  for  men,  both \nfigures  lower  than  the  national  average  of  64  for  women  and  58  for  men.  In  1998,  the \npercentage of female-headed households (FHHs) was higher in four of the project area\u2019s five \nprovinces than the national average of about 26%, ranging from 27% in Kampong Chhnang to \n29% in Battambang. Pursat was the exception with 24%. Categories of FHHs often identified \nby  commune  council  leaders  include  those  headed  by  (i)  widows,  (ii)  divorcees,  (iii) women \nwhose  husbands  do  not  contribute  to  household  management;  and  (iv)  women  whose \nhusbands  are  absent  migrant  workers.  The  high  percentage  of  widows  is  a  consequence  of \nCambodia\u2019s historical political conflict.  Most female household heads are aged 40 and older.  \n \n3. \nGender  analysis  is  intricately  linked  with  issues  of  ethnicity  and  poverty.  The  Khmer \nmajority has a matrifocal bias, in which (i) newly married couples live in the brides\u2019 households \nduring the first few years and (ii) daughters inherit household assets, including land, on equal \nterms as sons. Age plays an important role in that the youngest offspring often receives more \nproperty  than  older  children.  However,  women  customarily  cede  the  responsibility  of  signing \ndocuments and title papers to men because these are public and official functions. The Cham \nminority follow Muslim norms where inheritance is divided 2:1 in favor of sons over daughters. \nThe Vietnamese follow a custom that provides equal inheritance for both sons and daughters. \nThe Chinese generally practice a patrifocal system, where brides live with their in-laws.  \n \nB. \n \nMen and women are responsible for different types of work that define their social roles. \n4. \nWomen  engage  in  productive  work,  household  activities,  and  family  care.  Demands  on  their \ntime  and  a  lack  of  access  to  resources  hinders  their  ability  to  participate  in  household  and \ncommunity decisions. Women\u2019s priorities are often associated with the provision of water and \nprivate  latrines.  The  socioeconomic  surveys  found  75%  of  respondents  reported  that  the \nburden of collecting water falls on women and children. Findings revealed that men and boys \nalso collect water,  especially  during  the  dry  season  when  water  sources  are  remote.  Limited \naccess  to  potable  water  in  the  dry  season  significantly  affects  the  living  conditions  of  poor \nhouseholds  and  FHHs.  Discussions  with  women  in  Kampong  Chhnang  and  Kampong  Thom \nindicated that, in the dry season, women and children spend up to 3 hours per day collecting \nwater due to the remoteness of the source, the need for frequent trips, or long queues at water \n\nGender Water Use and Hygiene Behavior \n\n\f \n36 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nRepresentation in Public Institutions \n\npoints.  The  socioeconomic  survey  found  that  35%  of  households  have  to  fetch  water  from \nsources more than 100 meters away. \n \n5. \nMen  and  women  also  engage  in  different  hygiene  and  sanitation  practices.  The \nsocioeconomic  surveys  found  that  65\u201375%  of  respondents  said  women  are  responsible  for \nproper hygiene and for cleaning water jars and around the well area. Unsafe water with high \nconcentrations  of  iron  or  calcium  harm  women\u2019s  health  (e.g.,  by  causing  reproductive  tract \ninfections).  Most  participants  in  hygiene  education  programs  are  women.  Efforts  to  increase \nmale  participation  in  hygiene  education  are  needed.  Ethnic  groups  have  particular  practices \nthat  have  water  use  and  hygiene  implications.  For  instance,  the  Cham  wash  before  praying \nfive times per day. Some claim to use up to 100 liters of water per day for this purpose. \n \nSchool  hygiene  education  programs  are  important  for  long-term  improvement  in \n6. \nsanitation  practices.  School  is  a  critical  entry  point  for  targeting  children\u2019s  hygiene  behavior. \nChildren are able to learn and transfer best hygienic practices to other children and relatives. \nDiscussions with school officials in Kampong Chhnang revealed that girls are often shy to use \nthe same block of toilets as boys. It was suggested that public school latrines be constructed \nand  located  separately  for  girls.  This  would  help  increase  access  to  latrines  and  improve \nprivacy for girls, thereby positively influencing their enrollment rates. \n \nC. \n \n7. \nGender  disparities in  leadership  exist  at  all  levels  of  the  government.  Women  tend  to \nbe  excluded  from  the  decision-making  process in  the  administrative  and  institutional  system. \nProvincial government departments have few female staff members, and even fewer females \nin managerial positions, with the exception of the provincial departments of women\u2019s affairs. A \nlack of female leaders is a consequence of low education, obsolete recruitment and promotion \nprocedures,  and  poor  understanding  of  women\u2019s  potential.  However,  the  need  for  gender \nmainstreaming is being realized at all levels. Within the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD), \na  gender  working  group  (GWG)  of  three  women  and  four  men  has  been  established  to \noversee the mainstreaming of gender into rural development activities.  \n \n8. \nMRD  administers  about  8,000  village  development  committees  (VDCs)  in  the  country \nas  part  of  the  rural  development  structure.  At  least  40%  of  VDC  members  are  female.  Less \nthan  10%  of  village  chiefs  are  women.  The  VDCs  have  several  subcommittees  on  specific \ntasks  (e.g.,  planning,  health,  water,  and  law  and  order),  and  women\u2019s  participation  is  more \nvisible  in  subcommittees  such  as  health.  Women\u2019s  groups  exist  in  some  villages,  especially \nwhere  the  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  have  made  inroads.  They  are  mainly  self-\nhelp and microfinance groups, such as the traditional savings and credit groups (tontin).  \n \n9. \nThe  lowest  level  of  elected  governance  is  the  commune  council,  which  has  5  to  11 \nelected  members,  depending  on  the  commune  size.  There  is  no  quota  for  women\u2019s \nparticipation, as members are voted into office. Women are nominated to become members of \ndifferent  subcommittees  within  the  councils  (e.g.,  health).  The  commune  budgeting  and \nplanning committee includes two representatives from each village, one of whom is a woman.  \n \nD. \n \n10. \nand women, and how the Project will address gender disparities in the RWSS sector.  \n\nThe summary GAP has been prepared to show how the Project will benefit both men \n\nSummary Gender Action Plan and Implementation Arrangements \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Appendix 6 \n\n \n\n37\n\nProject Component \n\nActions Proposed \n\nTable A6.1:  Summary Gender Action Plan \n \n\nA.

The  purpose  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  access  to  safe  water  and  sanitation  for  the \nrural  population  of  the  five  provinces  of  Battambang,  Kampong  Chhnang,  Kampong  Thom, \nPursat,  and  Siem  Reap.  The  Project  specifically  aims  to  achieve  the  Cambodian  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (CMDGs) in the target areas by its completion in 2011, by which time 50% \nof  rural  residents  shall  have  access  to  safe  water  and  30%  shall  have  access  to  proper \nsanitation.  \n \nA. \n \nThe scope of land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) for the Project is not significant.1 \n2. \nCommunity  wells  and  household  latrines  will  be  built  on  private  land,  making  land  acquisition \nunnecessary.  However,  very  minor  land  acquisition  may  be  required  for  bigger  water  supply \nsystems  (e.g.,  ponds  and  small  piped  water  systems)  and  public  latrines.  No  person  will  be \nphysically  relocated  from  their  place  of  residence  or  severely  affected  by  any  subproject \nfinanced  under  the  Project.  Past  experience  with  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  projects \nsuggest  that  subprojects  can  be  designed  without  severely  affecting  people  or  households.  A \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  (LARF)  has  been  prepared  for  the  sector  project \naccording  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  and \nGovernment  of  Cambodia  laws  and  regulations  (Supplementary  Appendix  A).  A  sample  land \nacquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) has not been prepared as the location of these water \nsupply systems and sanitation options is unknown.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe  LARF  and  compensation  entitlements  have  been  built  upon  (i)  the  laws  of  the \nGovernment,  principally  the  Constitution  (1993)  and  the  Land  Law  (2001),  and  a  number  of \nother  laws,  regulations,  and  decrees  relevant  to  land  acquisition  and  resettlement;  (ii)  ADB\u2019s \nPolicy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995);  and  (iii)  Government-approved  resettlement  plans \nfor other ADB projects. The provisions and principles in the LARF will supersede the provisions \nof relevant decrees currently in force in Cambodia wherever a gap exists between Government \nregulations and ADB policy. \n \nThe  LARF  for  the  Project  (i)  identifies  the  legal  and  policy  frameworks  of  the \n4. \nGovernment and appropriate ADB policies and guidelines; (ii) sets out procedures and policies \non LAR to guide impacts during subproject design  and implementation; and (iii) outlines steps \nnecessary for preparing preliminary LAR investigations and provincial LARPs. The LARF guides \nany  minor  land  acquisition  and  ensures  that  any  loss  of  land,  income,  or  assets  is  either  (i) \nvoluntarily contributed, or (ii) compensated to the affected person (AP) at full replacement cost \nat current market value. Compensation for loss of structures will be in cash or materials at full \nreplacement  cost  at  current  market  value  with  no  deduction  in  compensation  for  age, \ndepreciation,  or  salvageable  materials,  sufficient  to  cover  the  cost  of  materials  and  labor.  All \nAPs are eligible for the same entitlements, regardless of gender and ethnicity.  \n \n\nLegal Framework, Project Principles, and Entitlements \n\n                                                 \n1  Not  significant  means  that  the  number  of  affected  persons  experiencing  major  impacts  in  each  subproject  is  200 \npersons  or  less.  Households  experiencing  major  impact  are  relocated  and/or  lose  10%  or  more  of  their  total \nproductive assets. \n\n\f \n40 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nGuidelines for Land and Asset Acquisition \n\nIn cases where local communities or individuals elect to make voluntary contribution of \n5. \naffected land without compensation, the process shall be acceptable only if (i) there has been \nfull  consultation  with  landowners  and  any  non-titled  affected  people  on  site  selection;  (ii) \nvoluntary donations do not severely affect the living standards of affected people and are linked \ndirectly to benefits for the affected people, with community-sanctioned measures to replace any \nlosses that are agreed through verbal and written record by affected people; (iii) the voluntary \ndonation  is  confirmed  through  a  verbal  or  written  record  and  verified  by  an  independent  third \nparty; and (iv) adequate grievance redress mechanisms are in place. \n \nC. \n \n6. \nLand  acquisition  will  be  kept  to  a  minimum.  The  location  of  water  supply  systems  and \npublic latrines will be determined through a community-based approach. Site selection for water \nsupply systems and latrines shall be made in full consultation with any people living on land (title \nand non-title holders) that is deemed suitable for use by a water supply system, latrine, or other \ninfrastructure facility built by the Project. \n \n7. \nA  preliminary  LAR  investigation  will follow  the  entitlement  matrix  in  the LARF,  for  each \nsubproject.  Identification  of  APs  will  be  carried  out  as  part  of  the  social  assessment  during \nsubproject preparation or preparation of the water supply and sanitation village plan (WSSVP). \nThe  cutoff  date  will  be  established  when  the  WSSVP  is  developed  and  the  technical  options \nselected.  \n \n8. \nThe preliminary LAR investigation will be part of the community decision-making process. \nThe investigation shall include (i) details of the water supply and sanitation infrastructure to be \nbuilt in a village (e.g., the type, number, and size); (ii) types of losses, including any land tenure \nissues;  (iii)  categories  of  APs  (e.g.,  persons,  households,  businesses);  (iv)  estimated \ncompensation  amounts,  or  voluntary  contribution  forms;  (v)  a  list  of  consultations  on  LAR \ndiscussions  and  issues;  and  (vi)  agreement  by  villages  affected  by  any  LAR.  Once  the \ninvestigation is prepared, it shall be shared with the APs for their information. This investigation \nshall be attached to the WSSVP for agreement by the commune council and submitted to the \nPIU for appraisal and implementation. \n \nA provincial LARP will be prepared to consolidate all preliminary LAR investigations for a \n9. \nsingle civil works contract. The LARP will be based on detailed designs, will include a summary \nof  socioeconomic  data  of  APs,  and  information  on  land  and  other  assets  in  the  affected  area. \nThe provincial LARP will be disclosed to the APs after preparation and approved by appropriate \nentities before the commencement of LAR-related activities.  \n \nD. \n \nParticipating  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs) 2  will  work  with  a  commune  land \n10. \nacquisition  committee  (CLAC)  to  prepare  preliminary  LAR  investigations,  as  part  of  the \nWSSVPs.  The  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  at  provincial  departments  of  rural \ndevelopment  (PDRDs)  will  review  and  consolidate  these  investigations.  The  PIU/PDRD  will \nprepare  the  provincial  LARP  for  each  cluster  of  subprojects  according  to  a  single  civil  works \ncontract. The PIU/PDRD will also conduct additional consultations with APs in the villages. They \nwill  submit  the  LARP  to  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  within  the  Ministry  of  Rural \nDevelopment  (MRD).  MRD  will  then  endorse  the  LARP  and  submit  it  to  the  Inter-Ministerial \n\nImplementing Arrangements \n\n                                                 \n2 NGOs will be contracted to help implement the community mobilization and skills development component, in which \nvillage water supply and sanitation plans will be prepared. \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n  41\n\nResettlement  Committee  (IRC),  or  any  successor  agency,  for  review  and  approval.  The \nchairman  of  the  IRC  is  responsible  for  LARP  approval.  MRD  will  then  submit  the  approved \nLARP  to  ADB  for  concurrence.  Approval  will  be  given  before  LAR-related  activities  can \ncommence. All LAR activities must be completed before ADB can issue a \u201cno objection\u201d to the \nawarding of civil works contracts.  \n \n11. \nA  national  resettlement/social  specialist  will  be  recruited  for  6  person-months.  The \nspecialist  will  conduct  awareness  meetings  and  training  workshops  for  project  officers, \ngovernment officials, and villagers on the LARF and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. \nThese meetings will be part of the overall project implementation arrangements. The specialist \nwill  also  assist  in  the  preparation  and  supervision  of  provincial  LARPs  and  preliminary \ninvestigations. A resettlement/social officer will participate in the PMU and each of the PIUs. \n \n12. \nThe Project will provide rural water supply and sanitation improvements in an estimated \n1,760 subprojects or villages. An estimated LAR budget of $125 per subproject, including 20% \ncontingency,  has  been  assumed  and  is  part  of  the  overall  project  budget  (approximately \n$220,000 in total). Incremental implementation costs, including project staff and consultant costs, \nare included in the overall project implementation costs. The Government will provide adequate \nstaff  to  manage  LAR  and  additional  budget  support  to  cover  LAR-related  costs  that  are \nunforeseen at the time of LARF preparation. \n \n13. \nInternal monitoring of the progress of provincial LARPs will be conducted by PMU/MRD \nthrough the PIU/PDRDs and CLACs. Coordination with IRC and the provincial resettlement unit \nis important to ensure the timely payment of compensation to APs. The PIU/PDRD will prepare \nmonthly  monitoring  reports  and  include  the  findings  in  its  overall  quarterly  progress  report  to \nPMU/MRD and IRC. The PMU/MRD will then consolidate the information and submit updates in \ntheir reports to ADB. An independent external monitor acceptable to ADB will be appointed by \nthe Government for about 18 person-months to monitor LAR. External monitoring reports will be \nsubmitted to ADB, PMU/MRD, and IRC simultaneously. \n \nE. \n \nThe LARF will be disclosed on the ADB website upon Board approval, and subsequent \n14. \nprovincial  LARPs  will  be  posted  following  ADB  approval.  To  meet  the  requirements  for \ncommunity  consultation,  information  about  LAR  will  be  shared  with  villagers:  (i)  initially,  when \nrepresentatives  of  commune  council  and  villages  are  informed  of  the  Project,  its  components, \nand relevant social and safeguard issues; (ii) during the identification of village water supply and \nsanitation needs, so that villagers can make informed choices about different water supply and \nsanitation  options  in  their  villages;  and  (iii)  after  the  provincial  LARP  has  been  prepared,  and \ncompensation amounts have been determined.  \n \nF. \n \n15. \nAffected  people  will  be  informed  of  the  process  and  their  right  to  lodge  grievances \nverbally  and/or  in  writing  during  initial  consultations,  social  surveys,  and  at  the  time  of \ncompensation.  They  will  be  exempted  from  all  taxes  and  administrative  and  legal  fees. \nComplaints and grievances will be filed first with CLACs. If no settlement is reached within 15 \ndays, the complaint will be raised to the district officer. If no settlement is reached within 15 days, \nthe  complaint  will  be  submitted  to  the  provincial  grievance  committee  within  the  provincial \nresettlement unit for consideration. If no settlement is reach within 30 days, the complaint will be \nsubmitted to the provincial courts for resolution. \n\nConsultations and Disclosure \n\nComplaints and Grievances \n\n\f \n42 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n\nIntroduction \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nThe  objective  of  the  proposed  Tonle  Sap  Rural  Supply  Water  and  Sanitation  Sector \nProject  (the  Project)  is  to  improve  the  safe  water  supply,  sanitation  systems,  and  general \nhygienic  environment  for  people  living  in  1,760  villages  in  the  five  project  provinces  of \nBattambang,  Kampong  Chhnang,  Kampong  Thom,  Pursat,  and  Siem  Reap.  The  proposed \nProject is a sector project classified as environmental category B under the Asian Development \nBank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines.  The  initial  environmental  examination \n(IEE)  was  conducted  for  the  Project  as  a  whole  and  two  subprojects  in  Tnaot  and  Trapeang \nChhuk  villages.  Under  Cambodia\u2019s  Sub-decree  of  Environmental  Impact  Assessment1,  IEE  is \nnot required for each subproject2 of the proposed Project. To ensure appropriate environmental \nscreening,  however,  a  preliminary  environmental  evaluation  will  be  prepared  for  each \nsubproject, and IEEs for a cluster of subprojects will be prepared and submitted to the PMU for \nits  review  and  endorsement.  If  there  are  any  critical  environmental  issues  recognized  by  the \nPMU, IEEs will be submitted to ADB for its review and approval prior to the award of civil works \ncontracts.  \n \nB. \n \nThe  proposed  Project  has  five  components,  as  presented  in  Table  A8.1.  The \n2. \nenvironmental  assessment  has  been  conducted  for  components  B  and  C,  and  environmental \nconsiderations are included in the other components to strengthen the environmental mitigation \nmeasures  and  monitoring,  and  enhance  the  ownership,  of  the  project-affected  communities  to \nsustain the environmental benefits of the Project.  \n \n\nDescription of the Project \n\nTable A8.1: Summary of Proposed Project Components \n\n \n\nActivities \n\nComponent \nA.

Annual \n\n                                                 \n1  Royal  Government  of  Cambodia.  1999.  Sub-decree  in  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  Process  (No. \n\n72.ANRK.BK/August 11). Phnom Penh.  \n\n2  A  subproject  is  defined  by  the  scope  of  the  rehabilitation  or  construction  of  water  supply  and  sanitation \n\nimprovements per village. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n43\n\nrainfall is typically 1,200-1,900 millimeters in the lowland area around the Tonle Sap to as high \nas  2,500-3,000  millimeters  in  the  western  mountainous  area  and  the  eastern  plateau.  About \n80% of the rainfall occurs during the southwest monsoon.  \n \nSurface  water  elevations  in  the  project  area  are  controlled by  the  river  elevation  in  the \n4. \nMekong\u2013Tonle Sap system and Tonle Sap lake. Groundwater resources are plentiful throughout \nthe  country.3  The  World  Health  Organization-Cambodia  nationwide  groundwater  quality \ninvestigation4  reported  elevated  iron,  manganese,  nitrite,  and  arsenic  concentrations  in  a  well \ninstalled in 1998 by the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) in the Kampong Svay district, \nclose  to  Stoeng  Sen.  Residents  drink  both  surface  water  and  groundwater,  but  groundwater \nremains more popular in rural areas.   \n \nCambodia harbors great biological diversity, both terrestrial and aquatic. The provinces \n5. \nof Kampong Thum and Pousat border Tonle Sap lake and encompass extensive flooded forests \ngenerally recognized as a composition of several distinctive vegetation types and floristic zones, \nincluding  short  trees  and  scrub;  tall,  dense  gallery  forests;  and  herbaceous,  floating,  or \nemergent  aquatic  vegetation.  Subprojects  under  the  proposed  Project  will  be,  however,  within \nestablished village areas, and ecological and archaeological resources are likely to be outside \nthe village areas and unlikely to be affected by the proposed improvements.   \n \n\n2. \n\nHuman and Economic Development  \n\n \n6. \nThe  population  of  the  target  villages  varies  from  around  2,000\u20132,100  persons  in  406 \nhouseholds (Trapeang Chhuk) to 368 persons in 74 households (Stoeng Leu). The villages are \nmostly rural in character and are engaged in farming and livestock rearing. About 40\u201350% of the \npopulation in the project areas is poor, which is above the national average of 36%.    \n \n7. \nThe villages rely on a combination of existing water sources for current supply including \nsurface ponds, shallow wells, and occasional deep wells. The use of latrines in rural areas is still \nuncommon, with the exception people living in flooded areas. Sanitation conditions in the vicinity \nof  wells  are  generally  poor.  The  data  collected  during  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance  in  2002  showed  that  30\u201480%  of  the  households  surveyed  had  water-related \ndiseases over the past year.  The most prevalent are diarrhoea and other intestinal infections.   \n \nD. \n \nPotential negative impacts associated with the design, construction and operation of the \n8. \nproposed  subprojects  will  be  temporary,  minor,  and  localized  and  can  be  mitigated  to \nacceptable  levels.  Potential  impacts  include  (i)  location-specific  impacts,  (ii) the  availability  of \ngroundwater  and  its  quality,  (iii)  construction  impacts,  and  (iv)  sustainability  of  drinking  water \nquality.  \n \n9. \nThe  rehabilitation  and/or  installation  of  wells  will  be  carried  out  within  existing  villages. \nEnvironmental screening criteria will eliminate any subprojects located in ecologically sensitive \nareas. Screening for unexploded ordnance will eliminate the risk of accidents. Very minor land \nacquisition  may  be  required,  and  a  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  to \nguide  compensation.  Groundwater  resources  are  plentiful  throughout  the  country  (footnote  2). \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n                                                 \n3  According to the 1999 information database system of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations \n\n(AQUASTAT), total renewable groundwater resource is 17.6 km3 per year. \n\n4  Feldman, Peter and Rosenboom. 2000. Cambodia Drinking Water Quality Assessment (final report), supported by \n\nWHO-Cambodia. \n\n \n\n\f \n44 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nThe  proposed  water  wells  will  penetrate  to  sufficient  depth  to  provide  safe  yield  to  meet \nprojected demand in the target villages. Water quality testing will be required at the time of well \ndevelopment, to ensure that groundwater meets the drinking water quality standards set by the \nMinistry of Industry, Mines and Energy. A set of environmental specifications will be included in \nconstruction  contracts.  Extensive  environmental  and  hygiene  training,  together  with  water  and \nsanitation monitoring programs, will ensure sustainable project environmental benefits.    \n \nE. \n \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Laws \n\n \n10. \nThe Department of Environmental Impact Assessment within the Ministry of Environment \n(MOE)  administers  the  Environmental  Protection  Law  (EPL).  MOE  is  responsible  for  policy, \nrules, regulations, and guidelines related to environmental quality. A department of environment, \nestablished in each province, is responsible for implementing the EPL in the province, including \nmonitoring,  enforcement,  and \nfor  small-scale  projects.  The \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) subdecree of the MOE stipulates that all development \nprojects are subject to environmental impact assessment. However, the subdecree requires IEE \nor  EIA  only  for  listed  projects  including  piped  water  supply  projects  serving  more  than  10,000 \npeople. A subproject under a rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) project does not meet \nthis criterion.    \n \n\nreview/approval  of \n\nIEEs \n\n2. \n\nInstitutional Responsibilities \n\n \nThe  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  (MRD)  is  the  Executing  Agency,  where  the  project \n11. \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  is  established.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project \nplanning,  coordination,  and  implementation.  An  environment/health  education  officer  will  be \nappointed  within  the  PMU.  A  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  will  be  set  up  within  each \nprovincial  department  of  rural  development  (PDRD).  At  each  PIU,  a  sanitation/health \neducation/environment  officer  will  be  recruited.  Water  and  sanitation  user  groups  (WSUGs)  in \ncharge  of  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  project  facilities  will  be  established  for  each \nwater  point  within  each  community  and  registered  at  the  commune  councils.  PIUs  assume \nincluding  preparation  of  preliminary  environmental \noverall  environmental  responsibility \nevaluations and IEEs and environmental monitoring.  \n \n\n3. \n\nEnvironmental Monitoring Plan \n\n \n12. \nAs  no  formal  monitoring  programs  for  wells  or  sanitation  facilities  are  in  place,  the \nproposed  Project  will  provide  a  number  of  measures  to  strengthen  the  PDRDs\u2019  monitoring \ncapacity  including  groundwater  testing,  water  quality  testing,  and  the  establishment  of  a \nnationwide  RWSS  database.  Relevant  guidelines  and  manuals  will  be  developed.  Based  on \nthese  guidelines,  specific  indicators  for  water  and  sanitation  will  be  developed  to  help \nenvironmental  officers  in  the  PIUs  carry  out  monitoring  activities  during  construction  and \noperation,  and  ensure  compliance  with  the  monitoring  requirements  set  forth  in  the  IEE  and \nadherence to drinking water quality standards set forth in Table A8.2. Monitoring results will be \nrecorded  in  the  database.  PIUs  will  monitor  and  report  quarterly  to  the  PMU  the  progress  of \nimplementation. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n45\n\nTable A8.2: Priority Parameters \n \n\nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure \n\nMaximum Value \n6.5\u20138.5 \n5 NTU \n0.05 mg/l \n0.30 mg/l \n800 mg/l \n0 per 100 ml \n\nParameters \npH \nTurbidity \nArsenica \nIron \nTotal Dissolved Solids \nThermo Tolerant Coliforms or E.

In general, \nparticipants  welcomed  the  proposed  design  of  the  Project.  The  main  environmental  concerns \ninclude lack of water during the dry season, groundwater quality, and related health concerns. \nDisturbances  and  inconveniences  to  the  villagers  during  construction  were  also  mentioned. \nThose concerns were taken into account in the overall project design, groundwater testing and \nmonitoring plans, and environmental provision of civil works.  \n \n15. \nPublic consultation is an ongoing and integral part of project implementation. Continuous \ndialogue  with  project-affected  and/or  beneficiary  communities,  as  well  as  with  relevant \nimplementation.  During \ngovernments,  will  be  carried  out  during  detailed  design  and \nimplementation, the environment/health education officer at the PMU and the sanitation/health \neducation/environment  officers  at  each  PIU  will  work  closely  work  with  local  NGOs  to  ensure \nthat any concerns and issues raised by project communities are addressed.  \n \nG.  \n \nAn  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)5  has  been  developed  to \n17. \nto  carry  out  environmental \nspecify \nassessment  for  each  subproject,  and  institutional  responsibilities.  The  Project  is  classified  as \nenvironmental category B, and no subprojects to be classified for category A or environmentally \nsensitive B will be selected. PIUs have the overall responsibility of screening, conducting, and \npreparing  IEEs  and  submitting  them  to  the  PMU  for  review  and  approval.  PIUs  are  also \nresponsible for reporting to the PMU and ADB as part of the quarterly reporting.  \n \nH.  \n \n18. \nThe proposed Project will have significant positive impacts on the quality of life and the \nenvironment of the project communities. Potential negative impacts associated with the design, \nconstruction, and operation of the proposed subproject activities will be temporary, minor, and \nlocalized and can be mitigated to acceptable levels  It is determined that a detailed EIA for the \nsubproject is not warranted. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment and Review Procedures \n\nthe  subproject  selection  criteria,  procedural  steps \n\nConclusions \n\n                                                 \n5 Detailed in Supplementary Appendix B. \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \n\nForeign \ncurrency \n \n\nLocal \ncurrency \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nSubtotal C \n \n\nSubtotal A \n \n\nSubtotal B \n \n\n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n \n \n914 \n2,950 \n0 \n36 \n63 \n41 \n4,003 \n\n  \nA.

This  translates  into  a \n$52.15  million  grant  for  the  2-year  period  or  about  $26  million  yearly.  It  is  recommended  that \nADB  provide  the  proposed  Tonle  Sap  Rural  Supply  Water  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project  (the \nProject) with $18 million in grant financing from ADF IX grant facilities. This appendix describes \nthe  rationale  and  justifications  for  grant  financing  of  the  Project.  The  proposed  grant-financed \nactivities  are  described  in  paragraphs  17\u201322  of  the  main  text.  Allocation  to  activities  is \npresented  in  Appendix  9,  and  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  plan  for  grant-funded  activities  is \ndescribed in Supplementary Appendix Q. \n \n2. \nAlignment with country\u2019s development strategies. Rural water supply and sanitation \n(RWSS)  have  been  integral  to  the  Government\u2019s  overall  strategy  for  rural  development  and \npoverty  reduction.  The  Rectangular  Strategy,1 National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  (NPRS),2 \nand  Cambodian  Millennium  Development  Goals 3  place  high  priority  on  RWSS.  ADB\u2019s \noverarching  goal  for  Cambodia,  as  defined  in  its  Country  Strategy  and  Program  (2005\u20132009) \n(CSP), 4  is  sustainable  poverty  reduction.  To  achieve  this  goal,  the  CSP  focuses  on  three \nstrategic  pillars:  (i)  broad-based  economic  growth,  (ii)  inclusive  social  development,  and  (iii) \ngood governance. Provision of RWSS facilities is highlighted as one means to achieve inclusive \nsocial development, and the RWSS sector is identified as one in which ADB will play a catalytic \nrole.  The  CSP  also  stresses  three  crosscutting  themes\u2014private  sector  development,  gender, \nand  the  environment\u2014that  support  poverty  reduction.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  all  three \ncrosscutting  themes.  The  Tonle  Sap  basin  is  identified  as  the  priority  area  where  ADB \ninterventions will be progressively focused. The CSP (para. 72) identifies rural water supply and \nsanitation  as  one  of  the  two  sectors  for  grant  financing,  together  with  the  control  of \ncommunicable diseases. \n \n3. \nAlignment  with  the  national  poverty  reduction  strategy.  Rural  households  account \nfor almost 90% of the total poor. The poverty rate in rural areas, estimated at 40.1%, is much \nhigher  than  in  urban  areas,  where  29.7%  of  the  population  is  poor.  Under-5  child  mortality  in \nCambodia remains one of the highest in Asia, at 124 per 1,000 live births, and has increased in \nthe last decade. Maternal mortality is estimated at 437 per 100,000 live births. While the number \nof people with access to safe water and sanitation has increased since 1989, mainly as a result \nof  external assistance  to  the sector,  Cambodia  remains  the  country  with  the lowest  water  and \nsanitation  coverage  in  East  Asia  and  one  of  the  lowest  in  the  world  (34%  for  access  to  safe \nwater  and  16%  for  access  to  improved  sanitation).5 About  60%  of  the  urban  population  has \naccess to a safe water source, and 49% has access to improved sanitation. In the rural areas, \nthe  overall  coverage  is  much  lower,  at  only  about  32%  for  rural  water  supply  and  13%  for \nsanitation.  For  the  poorest  20%,  the  percentage  with  access  to  safe  water  falls  to  4%.6 The \n\n                                                 \n1  Royal Government of Cambodia. 2004.

The  five  project  provinces  around  the  Tonle  Sap  basin \n4. \nhave  a  combined  population  of  3.5  million  people  in  2005,  of  whom  1.35  million  (or  39%)  are \nbelow  the  official  poverty  line.  About  85%  of  the  total  population  in  the  five  provinces  is  rural. \nThe Project is expected to meet the Cambodian Millennium Development Goal (CMDG) targets \n7.10 and 7.12 in the five provinces by providing safe water to 1.1 million rural people and latrine \naccess  to  0.7  million  rural  people  by  2011.  Some  50\u201370%  of  the  Project\u2019s  expected \nbeneficiaries are poor, given the high proportion of poor in the project area and the targeting of \nthe  poorest  households  and  communes.  Because  poor  households  suffer  disproportionate \nsickness and consequently have disproportionately high expenditures on health care, the poor \nwill gain the most from the supply of safe water and the project activities promoting health. \n \n5. \nWater  as  a  basic  human  need  and  the  Millennium  Development  Goals. Access to \nsafe water is a fundamental human need and, therefore, a basic human right. The lack of clean \nwater  jeopardizes  people\u2019s  physical  and  social  health  and  is  an  affront  to  human  dignity.  The \nProject aims to reduce poverty by improving access to clean water for the rural poor, particularly \nfor the vulnerable groups including women and children. The Project will assist the Government \nin its efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 4 (reducing child mortality), \n6  (combating  malaria  and  other  diseases),  and  7  (halving  the  proportion  of  people  without \nsustainable access to safe drinking water) and will contribute directly to the MDG targets 5, 8, \nand 10.  \n \n6. \nSector  investment  demand  and  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal  situation.  The investment \nfunds required to meet the goals of the Government for 2015 are estimated at $116 million by \nthe sector investment plan (2005). Given the very tight fiscal position of the Government and the \nlow level of cost recovery for RWSS investment, a large part of the funding is expected to come \nfrom external sources. The demand is well beyond the Government's fiscal capacity. While the \nGovernment recorded an estimated debt service ratio (relative to exports of goods and services) \nof  only  2.9%  in  2003,  the  ratio  of  debt  service  to  government  revenue  was  14.8%,  placing \nCambodia in the category of debt-stressed countries.   \n \n7. \nThe  Government\u2019s  strong  commitment  with  the  sector.  The  National  Water  and \nSanitation  Policy  approved  by  the  Government  in  February  2003  states  that  every  rural \nCambodian should have access to safe water and sanitation by 2025 and insists on three major \naspects: (i) the role of the ministries as regulatory and monitoring agencies, as opposed to their \nprevious  role  in  direct  implementation;  (ii)  the  provision  of  RWSS  services  based  on  user \ndemand, a process that includes \u201cvoice and choice\u201d in technology selection and the willingness \nof the users to share costs; and (iii) the importance of private sector participation.  \n\n \n8. \nThe policy recognizes the importance of four major guiding principles: (i) the social and \neconomic value of water, (ii) the promotion of safe behavior, (iii) the importance of sustainable \nmanagement  of  rural  water  resources,  and  (iv)  local  community  participation  and  decision \nmaking.  A  sector  investment  plan  was  approved  by  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  in  January \n2005. The plan describes overall sector financing requirements. Resources equivalent to $116 \nmillion  of  capital  investment  will  be  needed  to  reach  the  government  objectives  by  2015,  of \nwhich  the  Government  has  committed  to  contribute  9%  despite  its  difficult  financial  situation. \nThis demonstrates the Government\u2019s strong commitment to the sector. \n\n\fAppendix 11   \n\n 49\n\nPROJECT MANAGEMENT \n \n\nProject Steering Committee \n\nA. \n \nThe Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) will be responsible for overall implementation \n1. \nof  the  proposed  Tonle  Sap  Rural  Supply  Water  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project  (the  Project), \ntaking  charge  of  physical  implementation  and  financial  disbursement.  A  secretary  of  state  of \nMRD  (the  coordinator)  will  coordinate  the  Project  and  chair  a  project  steering  committee \ncomprising, as permanent members, the rural health care, community development, rural water \nsupply,  and  planning  departments;  the  gender  working  group  in  MRD;  and  the  provincial \ndepartments  of  rural  development  (PDRDs)  of \nfive  participating  provinces.  Other \ndepartments  or  ministries  may  also  attend  as  necessary.  The  project  steering  committee  will \nmeet every 3 months and will have the following tasks: \n \n\nthe \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nEnsure the timely implementation of the policy and institutional reforms included \nin the Project. \nReport  to  the  Government  on  progress  in  project  implementation  and  sector \nreforms. \nValidate the general orientation, objectives and procedures of the Project and the \nplanning of intervention in the five participating provinces. \nEnsure effective coordination among the different departments of MRD and with \nother ministries, participating provinces, and development partners working in the \nRWSS sector. \nApprove  and  supervise  the  plans  and  activities  of  the  project  management  unit \n(PMU) and project implementation units (PIUs). \n\nProject Management Unit  \n\n \nB. \n \nThe  PMU  has  been  established  at  the  Department  of  Rural  Water  Supply  of  MRD  in \n2. \nPhnom Penh. It is led by the project director. A full-time project manager will be responsible for \nday-to-day  operations.  In  addition,  the  PMU  comprises  13  technical  and  support  staff  and \ninternational and domestic consultants. The director of the Department of Rural Health Care will \nprovide  policy  guidance  to  sanitation  staff  in  the  PMU.  The  team  leader  of  the  consultants  will \nassist the project director and the project manager for the duration of the Project. The main roles \nand responsibilities of the PMU are the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\nEnsure that the Project is implemented in accordance with rural water supply and \nsanitation  (RWSS)  policy,  the  project  principles,  and  the  strategic  crosscutting \nissues. \nPropose general orientation, planning, and procedures for the Project. \nAllocate funds according provincial needs and plans. \nProvide technical and management support to the five PIUs. \nParticipate  in  procurement  committees  in  the  provinces  when  the  value  of  the \ncontract package is higher than $50,000. \nSupervise, facilitate, and expedite Project implementation. \n\n(vi) \n(vii)  Help  the  MRD  national  and  provincial  departments  introduce  in  their  operations \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\nthe national RWSS strategy and the guidelines prepared by the Project. \n\n(viii)  Review and implement the project performance monitoring system. \n(ix) \n\nEnsure  that  a  national  RWSS  database,  accessible  to  all  users,  is  established \nand regularly updated. \n\n\f \n50 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nUndertake  the  national  awareness  campaign  on  water  use  and  hygiene \neducation. \nTogether  with  the  MRD\u2019s  gender  working  group,  develop  a  gender  strategy  for \nRWSS. \nEstablish a selection committee for the recruitment of the consulting firm. \n\n(xii) \n(xiii)  Report to the steering committee and ADB.  \n(xiv)  Coordinate  and  supervise \n\nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR)  and \nenvironment  activities  as  outlined  in  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nframework  (LARF)  and  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework \n(EARF).  Facilitate  approval  of  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans \n(LARPs) and IEEs prepared by the Project. \n\n \nC. \n\nProject Implementation Unit \n\n3. \nPIUs  will  be  established  in  each  participating  province,  located  within  the  PDRD.  Each \nPIU will be headed by a part-time provincial project director, a senior official of the PDRD. A full-\ntime provincial project manager will be in charge of operational aspects and will be assisted by a \ndomestic  consultant.  Each  PIU  will  accommodate  the  domestic  consultant,  the  counterparts \nseconded  to  the  Project,  and  supporting  staff  recruited  for  project  implementation.  The  main \ntasks of the PIU include the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nImplement the Project in accordance with the Project principles and the strategic \ncrosscutting issues. \nPlan  activities  locally  by  selecting  the  district,  communes  and  villages  for \nintervention  according  the  project  selection  criteria  and  the  provincial  and \ncommune development plans. \nSelect,  contract  and  supervise  local  NGOs,  which  will  assist  the  PIU  in  the \nimplementation of the community mobilization and skills development component. \nOrganize  project \ninvite  all \nrepresentatives from commune councils and villages. \nEstablish  procurement  committees  to  pre-qualify  and  select  private  sector \ncontractors for implementing civil works. \nAdapt technical designs according to the needs of the province. \nSupervise field officers in charge of Project\u2019s district operations. \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n(viii)  Collect provincial progress and monitoring data for timely correctional action and \n\nin  each  district  and \n\ninformation  meetings \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(ix) \n(x) \n(xi) \n(xii) \n\nimprovement and updating the project performance monitoring system. \nSupervise the technical quality of RWSS facilities constructed under the Project. \nCoordinate all field work by regularly sharing the inputs of relevant stakeholders. \nReport to the PMU and the provincial rural development committee. \nImplement LAR and environment activities as outlined in the LARF and EARF for \neach  subproject.  These  activities  include  preparing  and  submitting  LARPs  and \nIEEs  for  clusters  of  subprojects  and  addressing  stakeholders\u2019  complaints  and \ngrievances. \n\nDistrict Office of Rural Development \n\n \nD. \n \n4. \nOne  district  officer  from  each  district  in  participating  provinces  will  allocate  a  full-time \nofficer to assist project implementation. The tasks of each district office of rural development will \ninclude the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\nAssist the PIU in the implementation and supervision of project activities. \n\n\fAppendix 11   \n\n 51\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nHelp water and sanitation user groups (WSUGs) supervise and monitor physical \nconstruction. \nEnsure that the quantity and quality of construction are in line with the standards \nstipulated by the Project. \n\nCommune Councils \n\n \nE. \n \n5. \nThe  Project  will  reinforce  the  commune  planning  process  by  supporting  the  priorities \nidentified  by  commune  councils.  Annually,  each  commune  council  collates  the  development \npriorities  of  the  villages  under  its  jurisdiction  through  the  planning  and  budgeting  committee \n(PBC) sessions. Each village sends two representatives\u2500usually the village chief and a female \nvillager\u2500to participate in budgeting and planning sessions and present the village priorities. The \noutput of these sessions is the commune development and investment plan. The plan includes \nall  prioritized  infrastructure  and  other  items  perceived  to  be  important  for  the  village.  All \ncommune  development  plans  are  submitted  at  the  district  integration  workshop  for  potential \ndonor, agency and government funding. The PIUs take part in the district integration workshop to \nidentify  potential  project  interventions,  based  on  project  selection  criteria.  Where  the  regular \ncommune and district planning process proves ineffective at identifying project interventions, an \nalternative option is to provide project support directly at to communities with the participation of \nthe  village  and  commune  concerned.  The  main  tasks  on  the  commune  council  will  be  the \nfollowing: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n(vii) \n\nParticipate in district project information meetings organized by the PIUs. \nCollect  demands  from  the  village  and  present  them  at  the  district  integration \nworkshop. \nApprove water supply and sanitation village plans (WSSVPs) and submit them to \nthe PIU. \nRegister the WSUG. \nAssume ownership of the facilities constructed under the Project. \nEstablish a commune land acquisition and environment committee to help the PIU \ncoordinate  and  implement  LAR  and  environment  issues.  The  committee  will  be \nthe first point of contact for any complaints or grievances related to LAR and the \nenvironment. \n\nVillages \n\n \nF. \n \nThe  Project  will  work  with  villages  authorities,  PBC  members,  village  development \n6. \ncommittees  (VDCs)  where  they  exist,  pagoda  committees,  teachers,  and  customary  leaders  to \ndevelop  a  WSSVP  based  on  a  rapid  appraisal  of  water  needs,  identification  and  location  of \nsocioeconomic  groups  in  the  village,  informed  choice  of  technical  options,  identification  of \nWSUGs,  and  commitment  to  contribute  financially  to  capital  costs  and  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  of  RWSS  facilities.  The  Project  seeks  to  ensure  that  the  WSSVP \nrealistically responds to demand and includes very poor households, ethnic/indigenous minority \ngroups, and women. The tasks in villages will include the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  village chief,  PBC  members,  VDC  members,  and  key  informants  attend  the \ndistrict information meeting organized by the PIU and NGO. \nThe village chief, PBC members, VDC members, and key informants organize a \nmeeting of the whole population to solicit water and sanitation needs and prepare \na  project  proposal.  The  PBC  members  refer  the  needs  of  the  village  to  the \ncommune. \n\n\f \n52 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\nPBC members provide feedback to villagers about the decision of the commune \ncouncil, the district, and the PIU. \nAll  interested  villagers  participate  in  the  community  mobilization  program \norganized by the NGO. \nAll  villagers (a)  prioritize  their  water  supply  and  sanitation  needs,  (b)  prove  their \nwillingness  and  ability  to  contribute  to  capital  investment  and  operation  (O&M) \nand  maintenance  costs,  (c)  identify  the  very  poor  households  in  the  village,  and \n(d)  identify  water  users\u2019  catchments  and  good  positions  for  water  points,  which \nwill provide the basis for establishing WSUGs. \nThe village chief, PBC members, and VDC members approve the WSSVPs and \nsubmit  them  to  the  commune  council  for  approval.  The  plan  will  include  a \npreliminary LAR investigation and a preliminary environmental investigation. \n\nBoard of the Water and Sanitation Users\u2019 Group \n\n \nG. \n \n7. \nThere  will  be  a  WSUG  for  each  water  system.  The  roles  and  responsibilities  of  WSUG \nmembers and its board will be specified in the guidelines for WSUGs prepared and approved by \nMRD. The WSUG will nominate users to establish a board, the main tasks of which will be the \nfollowing: \n \n\nSupervise and certify the construction of the water and sanitation systems. \nEnsure  proper  O&M  of  the  system  built  under  the  Project  and  ensure  that  the \nwater  system  is  functioning  and  providing  safe  water  throughout  the  year  to  all \nhouseholds in its catchment. \nCollect users\u2019 contributions for construction and maintenance. \nAppoint a private operator, if necessary, to help operate the system. \n\nHouseholds, Users \n\nThe main tasks and duties of the households will be the following: \n\nParticipate  in  identification  and  planning  meetings  in  villages  and  in  awareness \nand  hygiene  education  activities  and  select  the  type  of  water  supply  and \nsanitation solution that meets their needs. \nProvide 10% of the capital cost for constructing the water supply facility and part \nof the cost for sanitation infrastructure, in cash and in-kind.  \nElect a WSUG board. \nProvide financial contributions to the WSUG.  \nMaintain household latrines and household water equipment, such as jumbo jars \nand filters. \n\n \nH. \n \n8. \n \n\n \n\n\fIMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE\n\nAppendix 12       53\n\nTask Description\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2012\nQ3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2\n9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26\n\n-2 -1\n\n2011\n\n2008\n\n2010\n\n2007\n\n2009\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nA.

The proposed Tonle \nSap  Rural  Supply  Water  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project  (the  Project)  will  ultimately  include \nhundreds of similar small-scale investments in other villages. The different types of investments \nwill  be  determined  through  a  participatory  process  of  informed  choice  during  project \nimplementation.  As  such,  a  complete  economic  analysis  of  the  Project  as  a  whole  is  not \npossible  at  this  stage.  In  addition  to  demonstrating  the  economic  justification  of  such \ninvestments,  the  economic  analysis  provides  a  model  and  guidelines  for  further  economic \nanalysis and selection of additional investments. \n \n\nRationale for Government Involvement, and the Role of Private Sector \n\nB. \n \n2. \nThe economic rationale for Government involvement in rural water supply and sanitation \nis  based  largely  on  poverty  reduction.  In  theory,  the  private  sector  should  be  able  to  develop \nand supply water and sanitation services, and private investment has in fact occurred in some \nvillages. The main obstacles to widespread private investment are the dispersed, diffused and \ndiverse  nature  of  the  market,  the  lack  of  an  efficient  private  sector,  and  the  low  income  of \npotential consumers. \n \nThe main quantifiable benefits of the water supply component are reductions in the cost \n3. \nof buying and conveying water to private homes, and of medical expenses, and increases in the \ntime available for education, generation income, and recreation. These benefits will be realized \nby  improving  or  developing  new  permanent  water  sources  close  to  people's  homes.  As  the \npopulation density of rural Cambodia is quite low, developing rural water supply requires many \nvery  small  investments,  each  investment  serving  few  people.  The  low  income  of  the  people \nserved  means  that  they  are  neither  willing  nor  able  to  pay  enough  for  water  and  sanitation \nservices to generate sufficient profits to attract private investors. \n \n4. \nAs part of its water supply and sanitation policy, the Government therefore intervenes to \nprovide most of the initial capital investment to develop rural water supply and sanitation. Water \nand  sanitation  user  groups  (WSUGs)  will  manage  the  facilities  from  the  outset  and  be \nresponsible for all operating and maintenance (O&M) costs. In all cases, a user contribution will \nbe  required  to  sustain  the  facility  and  cover  O&M  costs.  The  Project  expects  and  encourages \nthe  development  of  a  private  market  for  managing  water  supply  facilities  and  that,  when \nnecessary,  villages  will  contract  individuals  or  small  private  firms  to  help  them  to  maintain  the \nfacilities. \n\n \n\nMain Assumptions \n\nC. \n \nAll monetary values are constant 2004 US dollars, the common currency in Cambodia, \n5. \ndespite the existence of the domestic riel (KR). The horizon for each investment is taken as 20 \nyears,  with  no  residual  value  at  the  end.  The  market  exchange  rate  is  KR4,000/$1.00,  and  a \nstandard exchange rate factor of 1.11 was applied to the price of tradable goods. All taxes and \nduties were excluded from market prices, and the opportunity cost of unskilled labor was taken \nas 70% of the market wage rate. \n \n\n\f56 \n\n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nLeast-Cost Analysis \n\nD. \n \n6. \nAs  the  Project  will  serve  hundreds  of  small  communities  in  various  hydrologic  and \nsocioeconomic  conditions,  it  does  not  propose  a  single,  specific  technology  for  either  water \nsupply or sanitation. Instead, it offers a set of recommended options, from which communities \nthemselves will choose their preferred option.   \n \n7. \nThe  Project  will  provide  a  variety  of  options  for  both  water  supply  and  sanitation. \nAlternatives for water supply include both private and communal systems, with alternatives for \ncommunal supply focusing mainly on groundwater, and alternatives for private supply including \nboth groundwater and household equipment. Alternatives for sanitation include pit latrines and \npour-flush toilets. \n \n8. \nIn  the  case  studies,  two  water  supply  alternatives  were  identified  for  each  of  the  three \nvillages, and each option was further refined and developed using the results of socioeconomic \nsurveys.  Table  A14.1  shows,  for  each  village,  the  least-cost  water  supply  alternative,  the \nalternative that was considered, and the ratio of the present value of the total cost of the least-\ncost  alternative  to  the  present  value  of  the  total  cost  of  the  other  alternative.  The  benefit-cost \nanalysis below is based on the least-cost alternative. \n \n\nTable A14.1:  Least-Cost Analysis of the Two Alternatives for Water Supply \n\nVillage \n\nLeast-Cost Alternative \n\nOther Alternative \n\nRatio of Costs \n\nTrapeang Chouk \n\nThree deep boreholes with \nhand pumps \n\nFour deep boreholes with \nhand pumps \n\nThnot \n\nSteung Leu \n\nOne borehole with four \nstandpipes \n\nFour deep boreholes with \nhand pumps \n\nIndividual boreholes with \nhand pumps \n\nIndividual rain water \ncollection and storage \n\n0.81 \n\n0.78 \n\n0.81 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nBenefits \n\nA least-cost analysis for the sanitation component is not applicable, as each household \n\n9. \nwill itself choose its preferred alternative. \n \nE. \n \nThe  water  supply  component  of  the  Project  will  reduce  the  total  economic  cost  of \n10. \nobtaining water for each household. Water supplied by the Project will replace some water used \nin  each  household  (a  non-incremental  output),  and  will  enable  households  to  increase  their \nwater consumption (an incremental output). During the dry season, the Project will replace all of \nthe water currently used by households, estimated to be 10-15 liters per capita per day (lpcd).  \nDuring  the  wet  season,  households  will  continue  to  obtain  some  water  from  their  current \nsources; the socioeconomic surveys indicate that households can continue to obtain 30\u201340% of \ntheir water from these sources. \n \n11. \nThe socioeconomic surveys indicate that the Project will enable households to increase \ntheir water consumption up to an average of 25 lpcd. On a yearly average, then, households will \nobtain 20 lpcd from the Project.1 The non-incremental component of the 20 lpcd is determined \nby current water use, which is shown for each village in Table A14.2. The Project will not affect \nthe use of water outside the house, so this is not considered in the economic analysis. \n                                                 \n1  That is, (6 months*25 lpcd + 6 months*0.65*25 lpcd)/12 months. \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n \n57\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nTable A14.2: Data Required to Calculate Non-Incremental and Incremental Benefits of the \nWater Supply Component for Each Village, and the Willingness to Pay for a Private Latrine \n\nVillage \n\nCurrent Use  \n(lpcd) \n\nCurrent cost  \n($/m3) \n\nCost with Project  \n($/m3) \n\nWTP for latrine ($) \n\nTrapeang Chouk \n\nThnot \n\n \n\n \n\n17 \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n2.01 \n\n1.28 \n\n1.93 \n\n1.16 \n\n0.76 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1,067 \n\n607 \n\n76 \n\nSteung Leu \n\n0.86 \nlpcd = liters per capita per day, WTP = willingness to pay \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n  Source: Asian Development Bank. \n \n12. \nThe  total  economic  cost  of  non-incremental  water  depends  on  the  time  spent  in \ncollection,  storage,  and  any  other  identified  costs.  Time  spent  in  collection,  determined  from \nsocioeconomic  surveys,  was  20\u201365  hours  per  household  per  month.  The  value  of  time  was \nmeasured  at  70%  of  the  official  average  rural  wage  of  KR4,500  per  day.  The  cost  of  storage \nwas estimated at KR83,850 for 2 cubic meters of storage capacity in drum(s), with an average \nlifespan of 20 years per drum. Households will continue to store water under the Project but use \nsmaller and fewer storage containers. The Project therefore offers some savings from the cost \nof  replacing  storage  containers.  Table  A14.2  shows  the  average  cost  of  current  water  per \nvillage, as well as the cost under the Project. \n \nThe sanitation component of the Project provides many private and social benefits, but \n13. \nthe economic analysis focuses only on private benefits. Private benefits were measured using \nthe  households'  willingness  to  pay  for  a  private  facility.  Table  A14.2  shows  the  average \nwillingness to pay for each village. The Project has many other benefits that, due to constraints \non time and information, were not quantified. The water supply component may provide water of \nbetter quality, and so reduce the incidence of waterborne diseases. Other social benefits may \nfollow from the reduced expenditure on collecting water, to the extent that the time and money \nsaved  are  allocated  to  socially  beneficial  activities  like  education.  The  sanitation  component \nmay also improve public health as well as the local environment. \n\nBenefit-Cost Analysis \n\nF. \n \nTable A14.3 shows the economic internal rate of return for each village. This is shown \n14. \nseparately  for  the  water  supply  component  and  the  sanitation  component,  as  well  as  for  the \nProject  as  a  whole  in  that  village,  including  the  cost  of  the  technical  assistance  component. \nTable A14.3 makes clear that each component of the Project has a very strong economic basis, \neven  when  including  the  cost  of  technical  assistance,  for  which  no  benefits  have  been \nestimated. \n \n\nTable A14.3: Economic Internal Rate of Return for each Component in Each Village, and \nfor the Village as a Whole, Including the Cost of Technical Assistance \n\nVillage \n\nWater supply \n\nSanitation \n\nCombined, Plus Technical \nAssistance \n\nTrapeang Chouk \n\nThnot \n\n21.9 \n\n26.2 \n\n21.6 \n\n14.2 \n\n14.0 \n\n12.8 \n\n21.5 \n\n23.9 \n\n19.5 \n\n \n\nSteung Leu \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n\n\f58 \n\n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nDistribution and Poverty Impact Analysis \n\n \nG. \n \n15. \nThe Project will benefit various groups. The direct beneficiaries are the households that \nuse  the  Project's  water  and  those  that  choose  to  acquire  private  latrines.  For  these \nbeneficiaries, the benefit will be greater the closer they are to the water source. Households that \nchoose  not  to  acquire  private  latrines  may  benefit  from  the  latrines  acquired  by  other \nhouseholds, if environmental quality improves from the increased use of private latrines. Other \nbeneficiaries  include  those  employed  in  managing  water  supply  facilities  and  the  owners  and \nemployees of firms engaged in constructing water supply facilities and private latrines. \n \n16. \nA  few  groups  will  suffer  from  adverse  effects  of  the  Project.  The  people  most  likely  to \nsuffer  directly  from  adverse  impacts  are  the  owners,  employees,  and  individuals  that  are \ncurrently supplying water, and who could be displaced by the Project. These groups are small \nand limited mostly to those carrying water during the dry season. The Project will not select any \nvillage  where  private  water  supply  systems  already  exist.  It  is  unlikely  to  generate  significant \nnew tax revenues, so the Government and taxpayers will not recover much of the Project cost.  \n \n17. \nTable A14.4 shows the poverty impact analysis for each of the three villages. The poor \nbenefit as consumers and by supplying labor. Like other groups, some of the project costs for \nthe poor will be borne by the Government. The poverty impact ratio for two of the three villages \nis greater than the 22.6% share of the national gross domestic product generated by the poor. \n \n\nTable A14.4: Net Benefits Accruing to Consumers, Government, and Labor, and the \nPoverty Impact Ratio for the Village as a Whole \n($) \n\nVillage \n\nConsumers \n\nGovernment \n\nLabor \n\nPIR \n\nTrapeang Chouk \n\nThnot \n\n33,118 \n\n5,895 \n\n(15,964) \n\n(5,083) \n\n383 \n\n122 \n\n0.32 \n\n0.19 \n\n22 \n\n0.28 \n\n(922) \n\n1,312 \n\nSteung Leu \n \nPIR = poverty impact ratio. \n             Source: Asian Development Bank.  \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\n \n \n \nH. \n \nTable  A14.5  shows,  for  each  village,  the  percentage  change  in  capital  costs,  gross \n18. \nbenefits, and asset lifetime that would drive the net present value of the total project to zero, at a \n12%  discount  rate  (switching  values).  The  economic  benefits  are  generally  less  sensitive  to \ncapital costs than to gross benefits and asset lifetime. These results indicate that the success of \nthe Project will depend heavily on adequate operation and maintenance of the facilities, to keep \nthe cost of supply below that of current water sources, and to maintain the expected lifespan of \nthe facilities. \n \n\nTable A14.5: Switching Values for Capital Costs, Gross Benefits, and Asset Lifespan \n(% change from base) \n\nVillage \n\nCapital Costs \n\nBenefits \n\nLifespan \n\nTrapeang Chouk \nThnot \nSteung Leu \n\n32 \n45 \n36 \n\n12 \n16 \n13 \n\n18 \n21 \n17 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n  59\n\nCONTRIBUTION PLAN \n\n \n1. \nThe  purpose  of  requiring  contributions  from  the  community  for  rural  water  supply  and \nsanitation  (RWSS),  as  in  the  proposed  Tonle  Sap  Rural  Supply  Water  and  Sanitation  Sector \nProject (the Project), is to ensure ownership and sustainability of the infrastructure provided by \nthe  Project.  Community  contribution  toward  capital  cost  is  often  used  to  measure  community \nownership. Discussions with villagers about their contribution often revolve around payment for \nthe cost of construction and rarely focus on operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. However, \ninitial  contributions  for  the  construction  of  facilities  do  not  guarantee  that  users  will  be  able  to \noperate  and  maintain  them.  A  water  and  sanitation  user  group  (WSUG)  will  be  established \nunder the project for each water point and will include households within a 150-meter catchment \nradius.  WSUGs  are  not  usually  homogenous.  Differences  between  the  better-off  and  the \npoorest households warrant special consideration, as the Project risks marginalizing the poorest \nhouseholds  and  vulnerable  groups.  The  poorest  20%  will  be  exempted  from  making  cash \ncontributions.  Identification  of  the  poorest  20%  of  households  within  a  village\u2014and  of  other \nvulnerable  households  including  ethnic  minority or  indigenous  groups  and  households  headed \nby  women\u2014will  be  carried  out  by  the  village  during  the  preparation  of  the  water  supply  and \nsanitation  village  plans.  The  identification  of  the  poorest  will  be  verified  by  the  village  chief, \ncommune  council,  and  participating  nongovernment  organization  (NGO).  This  is  imperative  to \nminimize dissatisfaction among other households and avoid exempting ineligible households. \n \n2. \nCommunity  wells  and  household  sanitation  facilities  will  be  built  on  private  land.  This \nland will be considered a contribution by the private landowner, who will be required to sign a \nvoluntary  contribution  consent  form  according  to  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nframework (LARF). The landowner will be required to sign an agreement with the water users of \nthe WSUG providing direct access to the water point. This agreement will be countersigned by \nthe  commune  council  chief.1  Other  water  supply  systems  and  sanitation  options  (e.g., \ncommunity  wells  on  public  land,  ponds,  simple  piped  water  systems,  and  public  latrines)  will \nfollow the principles set out in the LARF. In cases where systems are built on public land, the \ncommune council will sign an agreement providing right of access to all WSUG members.  \n \n3. \nCapital contribution for the construction of water supply systems. Each WSUG will \nprovide a contribution of 10% of the total project cost, of which 3% will be in cash and 7% in-\nkind  (Table  A15.1).  This  percentage  has  been  set  in  accordance  with  current  rules  set  by  the \nNational  Committee  to  Support  Communes.  The  WSUG  will  collect  the  cash  contribution  from \nits members and deliver it to the project implementation unit (PIU), after informing the commune \ncouncil. The PIU will manage the cash contribution of communes, which will be deposited in a \nbank  account  at  the  provincial  level.  Cash  contributions  will  be  collected  before  the \nimplementation phase of each subproject. Individual household contributions for a given water \npoint  may  vary  among  the  users,  with  the  landowners  and  other  residents  living  close  to  the \nwater points paying more than those living further away. The contribution of each household will \nbe  decided  by  each  WSUG.  The  poorest  20%,  identified  during  the  rapid  appraisal,  will  be \nexempted from cash contribution but required to provide contribution in-kind (e.g., materials or \nconstruction labor).  \n \n4. \nOperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  water  supply  systems.  Many  existing  water \nsystems do not function because of inadequate or irresponsible maintenance. The Project will \nassist  in  the  formulation  and  capacity  building  of  WSUGs.  Users  will  be  asked  to  adhere  to \nWSUG  rules  that  explicitly  state  the  need  for  all  users  to  contribute  to  O&M,  and  the  right  of \n                                                 \n1  This may be the same agreement that the commune council signs with the landowner and WSUG members, where \n\nthe commune council owns the water point, but agrees to transfer management responsibilities to the WSUG. \n\n\f60 \n\n \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nHousehold \n(HH) or \nCommunity \nOption \nCommunity \n(20\u201330 HHs) \nCommunity \n(10\u201315 HHs) \nCommunity \n(10 HHs) \nCommunity \n(200\u2013250 HHs) \nCommunity \n(200 HHs) \nHousehold \nHousehold \nHousehold \n\naccess  to  the  water  will  depend  on  these  payments.

No guidelines exist for household contributions to \nsanitation  in  Cambodia.  Different  projects  have  their  own  approach  and  requirements.  In  past \nprojects,  contributions  from  households  have  been  50\u201370%  of  total  capital  cost.  Experience \nshows that people are willing and able to pay if they understand the benefits of hygienic latrines. \nThe  Project  will  require  households  to  contribute  on  average  50%  of  the  cost  of  the  hygienic \nlatrine of their choice, with a varying degree of subsidy depending on the system (Table A15.2). \nA  higher-technological  option  will  receive  a  smaller  subsidy  than  a  more  basic  latrine  option. \nThe poorest 20% of households will be exempted from cash contributions but will be required to \ncontribute in-kind (e.g., labor and basic materials for walls and roofs). The contractor selected \nfor latrine construction will receive the full project payment only at completion, validated by the \nlocal WSUG. Each household will be responsible for the O&M of its individual household latrine.  \n \n\nTable A15.2: Sanitation Options \n\n \n\n \n\n \nPrice \n\nProject Subsidy \nPer Unit \n\nHousehold or \nPublic Option \nHousehold \nHousehold \nHousehold \nHousehold \nHousehold \nPublic \n\nBeneficiary \nContribution a \n60% \n$30 \n40% \n$14 \n40% \n$14 \n10% \n$2 \n20% \n$12 \n50% \n$150 \n\n$20 \n$21 \n$21 \n$18 \n$48 \n$150 \n\nTechnical Option \nPour-flush latrine \nVentilated improved pit latrine \nSealed pit latrine \nDry pit latrine \nLatrines for disabled people \nPublic latrine/washing station \n\n$50 \n$35 \n$35 \n$20 \n$60 \n$300 \na Depends on selected latrine technology and household income. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nO&M  of  public  latrines.
