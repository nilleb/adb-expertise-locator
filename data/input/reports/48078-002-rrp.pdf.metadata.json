The  investment  program \nconsists of staged physical investments in the transmission system, including the rehabilitation, \naugmentation,  and  expansion  of  transmission  lines,  substations,  and supporting  infrastructure. \nThe  physical  investments  will  support  evacuation  of  new  generation,  including  renewables; \nimprove system reliability and quality of supply through reinforcement and improved monitoring \nand control; and meet increasing consumer demand. The capacity development component will \nfurther improve the financial management, regulatory relations,  planning, project management, \nand  procurement  capacity  of  the  transmission  system  owner  and  operator,  the  National \nTransmission  and  Despatch  Company  Limited  (NTDC),  and  the  sector\u2019s  newly  established \ncommercial  operator,  the  Central  Power  Purchasing  Agency  (Guarantee)  Limited  (CPPA-G). \nThese investments will increase institutional efficiency, cost recovery, competition, transparency, \nand good governance within the power sector.2  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale  \n\nStrategic context. A reliable and sustainable energy sector is essential to the economic \n3. \ngrowth  and  well-being  of  Pakistan.  A  persistent  gap  between  the  end-user  and  cost-recovery \ntariffs  has  led  to  an  enduring  shortfall  in  funds  within  the  sector.  As  a  result  there  has  been \ninsufficient investment across the sector.3 The average daily shortfall is 4,500\u20136,000 megawatts \n(MW), resulting in routine load shedding of 8\u201310 hours per day in urban areas and up to 18\u201320 \nhours  per  day  in  rural  areas.4 Chronic  power  shortages  constrain  gross  domestic  product  and \npoverty  reduction,  and  increases  security  issues  and  social  unrest.  The  rural  poor  are \ndisproportionately  affected  by  the  shortages  because  of  their  dependence  on  agriculture.  The \nagriculture  sector  employs  44%  of  the  labor  force,  of  which  74%  are  women. 5 Insufficient \ninvestment  in  the  transmission  system,  which  links  generation  to  large  end  users  and \ndistribution companies, has resulted in an overloaded system that is incapable of providing the \nreliable  and  quality  supply  required  by  the  national  grid  code.  The  overloaded  transmission \nsystem has contributed to major blackouts and supply constraints experienced by end users.6 \n \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB.  2014.  Technical  Assistance  to  Pakistan  for  the  Power  Transmission  Enhancement  Investment  Program  II. \n\nManila.  \n\n3   The government\u2019s targeted average cost of generation is $0.10/kilowatt-hour (kWh), down from $0.12/kWh in 2013. \nThis compares with an average notified user tariff of  $0.11/kWh.  The government has not passed on the cost of \nelectricity to consumers for sociopolitical reasons. The gap between the end-user and cost-recovery tariffs is the \ndifference between (i) cost recovery and National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA)-determined tariffs, \nand (ii) NEPRA-determined and government-notified tariffs. Tariff structure is being addressed in concert with the \nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank through a combined systematic program approach. \n\n4  NEPRA. 2015.

Lahore.   \n\n6   NEPRA. 2015. Performance Evaluation Report. Islamabad. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n \n4. \nSector  structure.  Pakistan\u2019s  power  sector  consists  of  10  regional  distribution \ncompanies,  four  thermal  and  one  hydro  generation  company,  NTDC,  and  CPPA-G,  which  are \ngovernment-owned.  The  private  sector  owns  48.5%  of  the  23,663  MW  of  installed  generation \ncapacity,  and  K-Electric,  which  is  responsible  for  power  generation  and  distribution  in  the \nKarachi  area.    The  National  Electric  Power  Regulatory  Authority  (NEPRA)  determines  tariffs, \nissues  licenses,  and  regulates  the  energy  sector  to  ensure  its  long-term  sustainability.    The \nMinistry of Water and Power sets policy, including the tariffs paid by consumers. \n \n5. \nIn 2015, the central power purchasing agency division of the NTDC was separated and \nestablished  as  the  CPPA-G.  The  new  entity  provides  a  transparent  settlement  system  for  the \npower  sector,  which  will  evolve  into  a  competitive  electricity  pricing  platform  as  the  regulatory \nframework develops.7 In addition, the government has released policy frameworks to encourage \nprivate sector investment in transmission projects, and regulations to facilitate third party access \nto the existing transmission system. The proposed investment program will assist the NTDC and \nCPPA-G to operationalize the new market structure and comply with evolving regulations. \n \nSector  strategy  and  road  map.  The  government\u2019s  strategy  to  address  the  persistent \n6. \nenergy crisis is set out in Vision 2025, Pakistan\u2019s comprehensive vision  for economic growth.8 \nVision  2025  aims  to  (i)  increase  new  power  generation  with  a  more  balanced  generation mix, \n(ii) provide uninterrupted electricity to all, (iii) increase electricity access to 90% of the population \nby 2025, and (iv) improve demand management. This is supported by the 2013 National Power \nPolicy (NPP), a broad energy sector policy, which includes a detailed assessment of the issues \nand an action plan to address them (para. 8).9 The NTDC has a detailed long-term investment \nplan to support the policy actions, which addresses the physical investments required (para. 9). \nThe  nonphysical  investments,  including  policy  reforms  and  broader  sector  issues,  are \naddressed  under  the  government\u2019s  energy  sector  policy  reforms.  This  provides  a  strong \nstrategic, policy, and investment program to implement the sector reforms.10 \n   \nThe proposed MFF supports the reforms through the expansion and reinforcement of the \n7. \ntransmission backbone, which is required to meet quality and reliability of supply standards and \nservice  the  increasing  customer  demand.  Investments  in  advanced  control  equipment  and \nsystem  strengthening  are  also  required  to  facilitate  the  government\u2019s  targeted  increase  in \nrenewable  energy  generation.  Policy  reforms,  including  increased  institutional  efficiency, \ncompetition, \nthe  capacity \ndevelopment  component.  Operationalization  of  the  CPPA-G,  which  is  essential  for  the \ndevelopment of a transparent and efficient power sector, is also supported. \n \n8. \nPolicy framework. The NPP aims to apply the principles of efficiency, competition, and \nsustainability  to  establish  an  efficient,  consumer-focused  power  sector  that  is  capable  of \nmeeting  the  needs  of  Pakistan  and  boosting  the  economy  in  a  sustainable  and  affordable \nmanner.  Key  strategies  include  (i)  expanding  and  strengthening  the  transmission  grid  to \nincrease  access  and  improve  the  quality  and  reliability  of  supply;  (ii)  reducing  losses  through \nimproved  planning,  design,  and  implementation  of  improved  monitoring  equipment  and \nsoftware; and (iii) establishing transparency and controls for dispatch and payment. The need to \nimprove  governance,  rationalize  energy  prices,  ensure  the  efficient  use  of  energy  such  as \nreducing  technical  losses  in  transmission  and  distribution  systems,  and  rehabilitate  the  aging \n\ntransparency,  and  good  governance  are  supported \n\nthrough \n\n                                                \n7  ADB. 2014.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f3 \n \npower  infrastructures  are  also  reflected  in  the  government\u2019s  broader  Vision  2025  policies  and \nPoverty Reduction Strategy Paper II.11 These policies are aligned with the strategic context. \n \n9. \nInvestment program. Prior to the start of each year, NTDC prepares an investment and \npower  procurement  program  (IPPP),  outlining  the  staged  physical  investments  in  the \ntransmission  system,  for  the  approval  of  NEPRA. 12  Each  IPPP  will  include  the  physical \ninvestments  planned for  the  power  transmission  system for the  next  5  to  10  years.13 The  MFF \nwill  support  physical  investments  detailed  in  the  IPPP  approved  by  NEPRA  from  time  to  time. \nSpecific  projects  will  be  selected  based  on  their  readiness  (including  in  respect  of  required \ngovernment  approvals;  procurement;  and  technical,  economic,  and  financial  feasibility);  and \ncompliance with Asian  Development Bank (ADB) requirements. The NTDC\u2019s 2016\u20132026 IPPP \nincludes physical investments in excess of $11.0 billion. \n\n \nThe MFF\u2019s nonphysical investments support the NPP by assisting the NTDC and CPPA-\n10. \nG  to  achieve  institutional  efficiency,  cost  recovery,  competition,  transparency,  and  good \ngovernance.  A  capacity  development  plan  will  be  prepared  under  tranche  1  to  identify  the \ntraining, resources, and capacity support required for the successful implementation of this MFF, \nincluding  the  (i)  planning,  construction,  operation,  maintenance,  and  management  of  the \ntransmission system; and (ii) segregation and transfer of certain functions from the NTDC to the \nCPPA-G, and the ongoing operationalization of the CPPA-G. A facility management consultant \nwill be engaged to assist the NTDC in preparing subsequent tranches, and in implementing and \nmonitoring the MFF. Additional resources will be engaged to assist the NTDC and CPPA-G to \nupdate their internal procedures and policies to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. \n\n \nADB  interventions.  The  proposed  investment  program  supports  ADB\u2019s  Sustainable \n11. \nEnergy  Sector  Reform  Program  through  targeted  loss  reduction,  regulatory  compliance,  and \nimproved  tariff  submission  processes.14 The  expansion  and  reinforcement  of  the  transmission \nsystem  provides  the  critical  connecting  infrastructure  required  for  the  successful  use  of  ADB \nsupport  in  generation,  renewables,  and  distribution  subsectors.  The  investment  program  is \naligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy,  country  partnership  strategy  for  Pakistan,  and  the  Midterm \nReview  of  Strategy  2020.15\n   It  is  included  in  the  country  operations  business  plan,  2016\u20132018 \nfor  Pakistan,  and  is  consistent  with  the  Development  Coordination  Framework. 16  It  is  also \naligned  with  Sustainable  Development  Goal  No.  7:  Affordable  and  Clean  Energy,  and  the \ncountry\u2019s intended nationally determined contribution through its contribution to Vision 2025.17  \n\n \n12. \nThe  proposed  investment  program  will  build  on  the  Power  Transmission  Enhancement \nInvestment Program approved in 2006.18 Transmission system losses have reduced from 7.6% \n\n                                                \n11 Government of Pakistan, Finance Division. 2008.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the Islamic \n\nRepublic of Pakistan for the Power Transmission Enhancement Investment Program. Manila. \n\n \n\n\fInvestment  Program.  The \n\n4 \n \nto less than 3.0%, with energy supplied increasing from 55,000 GWh to 98,000 GWh during the \ntransformer  capacity \nPower  Transmission  Enhancement \n(11,000 megavolt-amperes)  and  transmission  lines  (500  kilometers  [km])  added  have  reduced \noverloading,  removed  bottlenecks,  and  improved  compliance  with  the  grid  code.  Compliance \nwith most undertakings in the framework financing agreement (FFA) and covenants in the loan \nagreements  is  ongoing.  While  substantial  progress  in  procurement,  project  management,  and \noutcomes  has  been  made  under  the  Power  Transmission  Enhancement  Investment  Program, \nfurther  improvements  could  be  achieved. 19 Lessons  learned  have  been  incorporated  in  the \ndesign  of  this  MFF.  The  dedicated  project  management  unit  (PMU)  has  been  strengthened, \nproject  readiness  has  been  improved,  and  a  facility  management  consultant  and  capacity \ndevelopment plan have been included to address the issues and associated delays experienced \nduring the previous MFF.20 The long-term engagement has enabled ADB to have consistent and \nconstant policy dialogue as the leading partner in the sector.   \n \n13. \nJustification for the multitranche financing facility. The required MFF constituents\u2014\na  road  map,  investment  program,  strategic  context,  and  policy  framework\u2014are  in  place.  The \nMFF  modality  provides  critical  mass,  and  continuity  to  the  NTDC  for  long-term  investment \nplanning, and enables ADB to align financing with project readiness and sector reforms.21  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n14. \nThe  impact  will  be  improved  transmission  infrastructure  and  management,  and  energy \nmarket  transparency  and  efficiency.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  coverage,  reliability,  and \nquality of the power transmission service in Pakistan. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n15. \nThe  outputs  of  the  investment  program  will  be  (i)  the  rehabilitation,  augmentation,  and \nexpansion of the high-voltage transmission network; and (ii) strengthening of the operations and \nmanagement of the NTDC and CPPA-G. Tranche 1 will have the same physical output as the \ninvestment  program.  This  will  be  achieved  through  the  construction  of  transmission  lines, \nextension  and  augmentation  of  substations,  and  replacement  of  protection  equipment.  The \nnonphysical output of tranche 1 will be the strengthening of the operations and management of \nNTDC. This will be achieved through the preparation of a safety manual, capacity development \nplan,  and  an  action  plan  to  meet  the  government-mandated  quota  of  10%  employment  of \nwomen, and implementation of a project management and information system, among others.  \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\n16. \nThe  overall  financing  need  for  the  government\u2019s  investment  program  is  in  excess  of \n$11.0  billion.  The  MFF  will  finance  a  portion  of  this  investment  program  worth  $1.01  billion. \nTable 1 shows the portion of the investment program to be financed by the MFF. \n \n\n                                                \n19  ADB. 2015.

Detailed  due  diligence  confirmed  the  project  justification  and \nload flow analysis, technical viability, and suitability for application within the NTDC system. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nSubproject 1 will upgrade and augment three substations (Sahiwal, Lahore South, \nand Rewat) to supply power to the distribution systems, complying with the \nsecurity and reliability criteria indicated in the grid code.  \nSubproject 2 will install event and fault recorders and fault locators at strategically \nimportant transmission substations in the southern area of the grid. Modern digital \nprotection relays will replace the existing relays, which are no longer fit for purpose. \nTo ensure the grid system stays intact, under-frequency relays are to be installed. \nThe Dadu 500 kilovolt (kV) substation shunt reactor will be replaced to improve the \nvoltage stability of the surrounding 500 kV system. \nSubproject 3 is the Faisalabad West substation phase II expansion, including the \ninstallation of 32 km of 500 kV transmission line, along with the associated 500 kV \nline  bay  equipment  at  Faisalabad  West,  and  84  km  of  220  kV  transmission  line, \nalong  with  the  associated  220  kV  line  bay  equipment  at  Faisalabad  West  and \nLalian, to meet the growing demand in the Faisalabad distribution system. \nSubproject  4  will  install  500  kV  transmission  lines  to  disperse  power  generated \nfrom the Guddu gas-fired power plant to the load centers.31  \n\n                                                \n31  The  equipment  for  the  Guddu  transmission  line  was  procured  under  the  Power  Transmission  Enhancement \n\nInvestment Program Tranche 4. http://www.adb.org/projects/37192-044/main \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial  \n\n25. \nEconomic and financial analysis will be carried out separately for each tranche under the \ninvestment  program.  The  main  benefits  derived  from  tranche  1  are  (i)  improved  reliability  and \navoided  unserved  energy  while  ensuring  compliance  with  the  grid  code,  (ii) reduced  technical \nlosses from transformers, and (iii) increased flow of power from increased substation capacity. \nThe analyses compare the incremental costs and benefits of with- and without-project scenarios.  \n \nA  financial  evaluation  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the \n26. \nFinancial Management and Analysis of Projects.32 Tranche 1 is financially viable, with a financial \ninternal  rate  of  return  of  13.1%,  which  is  greater  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of \n7.8%.33 Sensitivity  analysis  found  that  the  project\u2019s  financial  viability  remained  robust  in  the \ncases of (i) a 10% increase in capital costs, (ii) a 10% increase in operation and maintenance \ncosts, (iii) a 10% decrease in revenues, and (iv) a 1-year delay in completion. \n   \n27. \nThe  economic  evaluation  was  completed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the \nEconomic  Analysis  of  Projects.34 The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  18.6%  justifies  the \nviability  of  tranche  1.  Sensitivity  analysis  found  that  the  project\u2019s  economic  viability  remained \nrobust in the cases of (i) a 10% increase in capital costs, (ii) a 10% decrease in benefits, and \n(iii) a 1-year delay in completion. The results compared favorably with the economic opportunity \ncost of capital of 12% in all cases. \n \n28. \nThe  NTDC\u2019s  financial  performance  was  assessed  for  tranche  1.  Its  operating \nperformance improved from PRs6 billion in profit before tax in 2012 to PRs9 billion in 2015. Its \nliquidity is also improving, since the central power purchasing agency division\u2019s activities, which \nheld large outstanding receivable from distribution companies, were transferred to the CPPA-G \nin  May  2015.  As  a  regulated  entity,  with  a  regulated  rate  of  return  on  equity  of  13.11%,  the \nNTDC\u2019s financial operation is expected to remain stable throughout the proposed MFF.  \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nThe  financial  management  assessment  for  tranche  1  was  conducted  in April  2016  and \n29. \nthe  pre-mitigation  risks  are  substantial.  An  action  plan  was  agreed  to  assist  the  NTDC  to \nstrengthen its financial management.35 Although the NTDC has significant experience with ADB \nprojects  and  the  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  capacity \ndevelopment  and  support  are required  to  prevent the  delays  experienced  in previous  projects. \nThis will be provided through a strengthened, dedicated PMU, facility management consultant, \nand capacity development support. \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n30. \nwith  the  government  and  the  NTDC.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the FAM (footnote 22). \n \n\n                                                \n32 ADB. 2005.

Poor  and  vulnerable  consumers,  who  make  up \nabout  half  of  the  population,  will  particularly  benefit  as  they  are  often  the  most  affected  by \ninadequate power supply, load shedding, and poor power quality. The rural poor, especially the \nwomen who comprise 74% of agricultural workers, will benefit from reduced power outages as it \nwill  improve  crop  water  distribution.  Hospitals  and  schools  will  improve  their  services  with \nreduced  power  outages.  Increases  in  the  Human  Development  Index  are  strongly  correlated \nwith access to reliable electricity supplies.36  \n\n \n\n32.  Women will benefit from the use of time-saving electrical appliances, which will cut the \ntime they spend on household chores. Specific benefits will include an action plan for the NTDC \nto meet the government\u2019s 10% quota of employed women. Women will also be targeted in the \nenergy  conservation  and  safety  awareness-raising  activities,  which  will  coincide  with  the \ncommunity awareness campaign on the project.   \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n33. \nAccording to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), tranche 1 has been categorized \nB  for  environment.  Civil  works  in  tranche  1  will  be  limited  to  the  substations  and  the  final \nalignment  of  the  transmission  lines.  Environmental  impacts  will  be  limited  to  the  construction \nphase of these projects. The proposed alignments do not traverse any environmentally sensitive \nareas.  Separate  initial  environmental  examination  studies  have  been  performed  for  the \ncomponents and disclosed on the ADB website.37 The project has been rated a medium risk to \nclimate  change.  A  climate  change  assessment  will  be  undertaken  for  each  tranche  to  ensure \nthat appropriate risk mitigating measures are incorporated into the project design. \n \nNo physical displacement of persons from housing or loss of more than 10% of income-\n34. \ngenerating resources will occur. Project areas have no indigenous peoples. Environment, land \nacquisition, and resettlement impacts are assessed as insignificant. Tranche 1 is classified B for \nenvironment,  B  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  C  for  indigenous  peoples.38 An  environment \nand  social  impacts  cell  staffed  with  environment,  social,  and  resettlement  officials  has  been \nestablished  in  the  PMU.  Capacity  will  be  strengthened  through  the  facility  management \nconsultant until the environment and social impacts cell has sufficient resources. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n35. \nThe  investment  program\u2019s  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs. \nMajor risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4, and described in detail in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.39   \n \n\n                                                \n36  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development.  2007.
