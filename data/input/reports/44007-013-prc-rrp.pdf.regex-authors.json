I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Jiangxi Fuzhou Urban Integrated Infrastructure \nImprovement Project.1 \n \n2.  The outputs of the project will be (i) a 12.2-kilometer (km) bus rapid transit (BRT) system, \n(ii) an urban transport hub at the new Jiangxi Fuzhou Railway Station, (iii) river rehabilitation \nand  \u201cgreenway\u201d  development,  (iv)  10  km  of  station  access  roads,  and  (v) institutional \nstrengthening and capacity building. The proposed project will contribute to inclusive growth and \nenvironmentally sustainable development in Jiangxi Fuzhou by improving the efficiency and \nsustainability of urban transport. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Sustainably supporting rapid urbanization is a key development challenge for the PRC, \nwhere 300 million people are expected to move to cities by 2020. Such mass migration will \nrequire a major expansion of second-tier cities such as Jiangxi Fuzhou to relieve pressure on \nexisting urban centers and provide economic opportunities for vast numbers of low-income \npeople now engaged in agriculture. Major investments in urban infrastructure, transport, and \nrelated  services  will  be  necessary  to  accommodate  development  in  second-tier  cities  and \nsupport sustainable urbanization and inclusive growth. \n \n4.  Fuzhou is a prefectural level city in Jiangxi Province. It has a total population of 3.8 \nmillion, of which 1.0 million is urban. The Fuzhou urban district where the project is located has \na  current  population  of  about  500,000  and  is  expected  to  grow  to  750,000  by  2020. \nEconomically, Fuzhou lags behind nearby provinces and remains relatively poor. In 2010, per \ncapita disposable income was CNY14,445 ($2,275) in the urban areas and CNY5,848 ($921) in \nthe rural areas which was less than 50% of the national average. \n \n5.  The  new  Xiangpu  High-Speed  Railway,  now  under  construction,  will  begin  at  the \nprovincial capital Nanchang and pass through Fuzhou on the way to central Fujian Province. \nThe current railway service consists of one train in each direction per day and takes over 2 \nhours to travel the 90 km from Fuzhou to Nanchang. The new railway service will initially run \nabout 50 passenger trains each direction daily, offering Fuzhou a major increase in accessibility. \nWith the opening of the high-speed railway, Fuzhou will be about 30 minutes from Nanchang, \nwhich will allow the city to transform itself from a small city dependent on agriculture and related \nprocessing into a suburb of Nanchang. Fuzhou will become better connected as well to fast-\ngrowing and relatively prosperous cities in the eastern PRC. The opening of the new railway \noffers a significant opportunity to improve the economy of this region. To realize the opportunity, \nhowever, the new station in Fuzhou must be efficiently linked to existing and planned residential \nand employment areas in the city. \n \n6.  The new station is 6 km south of the existing city center and 2 km from the currently \ndeveloped city area. The new station is planned to become Fuzhou\u2019s southern gateway and to \nanchor a new development area that will include a major business center, hotels, logistics \nfacilities, and housing for nearly 100,000 people by 2020. Through the proposed project, the \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. ", "2 \nstation and surrounding area will be linked to the existing city with well-designed multimodal \ntransport infrastructure and integrated public transport services. This will reduce transport costs, \nincrease  the  efficiency  and  attractiveness  of  the  public  transport  system,  expand  travel \nopportunities and regional accessibility to jobs and services, promote sustainable urbanization \nand poverty reduction, and encourage a shift to modes of travel with lower and even zero \nemissions. \n \n7.  The project aligns with Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance to the PRC under the \ncountry partnership strategy, strengthening (i) inclusive growth and balanced development by \npromoting sustainable urbanization and (ii) resource efficiency and environmental sustainability \nby promoting efficient and sustainable urban transport.2 The focus on public transport and \nmultimodal integration directly supports ADB\u2019s sustainable transport initiative. The project aligns \nwith the priorities of the Ministry of Transport, which is promoting the development of multimodal \npassenger transport hubs under ongoing ADB policy advisory technical assistance.3 The project \nwas selected to take advantage of the opportunity presented by the impending opening of the \nnew high-speed railway and seizes an early opportunity to establish a model for urban transport \nand development integration that can be replicated in other cities. \n \n8.  This  project  is  ADB's  second  to  support  BRT  in  the  PRC,  following  the  Lanzhou \nSustainable  Urban  Transport  Project,  and  applies  lessons  learned  in  developing  and \nimplementing that project.4 The Lanzhou Sustainable Urban Transport Project benefitted from \nthe involvement of the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy,5 which helped to \nbuild local support and encourage an integrated approach to BRT design, road development, \nand urban planning. In Fuzhou, ADB again worked with the institute to train local officials in BRT \ndesign, implementation, and operations and to help the team prepare the BRT feasibility study. \nThe complexity of BRT system planning, design, and operations demanded that the project \ninclude a program of institutional strengthening and capacity building in the municipal bus \ncompany and the project management office (PMO). The BRT corridor in Fuzhou will not only \nserve the new railway station area but also run through the center of the city, where passenger \ndemand is highest and bus service is slowed by heavy mixed traffic on narrow streets. As such, \nthe project is expected to be a model for sustainable transport development in small and \nmedium-sized cities. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the project will be an efficient, inclusive, and sustainable urban transport \nsystem in Jiangxi Fuzhou. The outcome of the project will be efficient multimodal access to the \nnew main railway station.  \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2012.

Outputs \n10.  The project includes the following five main outputs intended to substantially improve the \nurban transport system in Fuzhou. \n \n11.  Output 1: Bus rapid transit system. The BRT corridor will extend 12.2 km from the \nnorth of Fuzhou through the central business district to the urban transport hub at the new \nrailway station (output 2). Ten kilometers of the corridor will be created by reconstructing and \nreconfiguring existing roads, and the remaining 2.2 km will be new roads built under output 4. \nThe BRT corridor will have dedicated center-running bus lanes with a proposed 22 stations on \nisland platforms. The project will include the procurement of 51 BRT buses, which will constitute \nabout a quarter of the municipal bus company\u2019s fleet. \n \n12.  Output 2: Urban transport hub. The urban transport hub will link the BRT and regular \nbus systems to the new railway station. The hub will incorporate a station for BRT and local \nbuses with four bus bays; BRT ticketing and support facilities; a bus staging area; parking for \ncars, motorcycles, and bicycles; and pedestrian walkways linking the BRT station to the railway \nstation. New bus company offices, a control center, and bus storage and maintenance facilities \nwill be constructed adjacent to the bus transfer facility. \n \n13.  Output 3: Fenggang River greenway. The Fenggang River is a winding waterway on \nthe west side of the Fuzhou urban area. The river is now integrated into the irrigation system for \nrice cultivation. During the rainy season, farmland on both sides of the river floods. The river \nruns through the new development area, past the front of the new railway station, to the old city. \nThe river must be improved to ensure that the new development area will not flood. Phase 1 of \nthe Fenggang River Improvement Project has already been completed enabling flood control \nnear the city center and providing within Fuzhou recreation areas, parkland, and a path for \nnonmotorized  vehicles.  As  part  of  this  project,  the  Fenggang  River  improvement  will  be \nextended by 4.1 km, passing directly in front of the railway station. This output will enable flood \ncontrol and provide parks and a continuous nonmotorized transport corridor between the old city \nand the development area adjacent to the new station. \n \n14.  Output  4:  Station  access  roads.  The  road  component  will  develop  the  transport \nnetwork to connect the new railway station to BRT (output 1), the urban transport hub (output 2), \nthe Fenggang River greenway (output 3), and major road and bus corridors in the existing urban \narea. The four road sections under the ADB-financed project are urban trunk roads in the \napproved master plan for the new development area. Altogether, 10 km of new roads will be \nconstructed and will include utilities, streetscape improvements, pedestrian enhancements, and \nlanes for nonmotorized vehicles. \n \n15.  Output 5: Institutional strengthening and capacity building. Capacity development \nand institutional strengthening will be implemented to ensure that the executing agency and \nimplementing agency have sufficient capacity to manage the project and that the municipal bus \ncompany is able to plan, implement, and effectively operate the BRT system. This output will \nhave two parts. The first part will support project management and implementation to ensure \nthat project outputs are delivered on time and within budget in accordance with ADB policies \nand procedures; develop and maintain the project performance monitoring system; assist with \nprocurement and disbursement; oversee detailed design; and ensure that safeguard measures \nare  implemented,  monitored,  and  reported.  The  second  part  will  build  capacity  in  traffic \nmanagement, road safety, and BRT operation and management. \n \n ", "4 \n16.  Environmental  improvement.  Additional  funding  is  being  sought  from  the  Global \nEnvironment Facility (GEF) to support measures to maximize the energy efficiency of bus \noperations on the BRT and feeder services. This will mitigate climate change by reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions, and provide benefits by improving local air quality and reducing \npublic transport operating costs. In particular, GEF funding will support upgrading BRT buses to \nadvanced compressed natural gas technology; scrapping and replacing old, highly polluting \nbuses  on  local  routes;  and  training  bus  drivers  in  eco-driving  and  maintenance  staff  in \ntechniques that reduce fuel consumption. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n17.  The  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $226.46  million,  including  $100  million  from  ADB \n(Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \nTotal Cost Share of Total Cost \nItem  ($ million)  (%) \nA.

Price contingencies are computed by year and expenditure type \nbased on cumulative domestic and foreign price inflation assumptions and amount to 9.4% of base cost. \nc  Includes interest charges during implementation and commitment charges. Interest on the loan during \nimplementation has been computed at the London interbank offered rate plus a spread of 0.4% and a \nmaturity premium of 0.1%. Commitment charges for the ADB loan are computed at 0.15% on the projected \nundisbursed loan amount. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n18.  The Government of the PRC requested a loan of $100 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to finance 44.16% of the project cost. The loan will have a 25-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% \nper year; and such terms and conditions as may be set forth in the draft loan and project \nagreements.6 ADB\u2019s  loan  will  cover  civil  works,  equipment,  institutional  strengthening  and \ncapacity  building,  financing  charges  during  implementation,  and  taxes  and  duties  on  the \nexpenditures financed by ADB.7 The Fuzhou Municipal Government (FMG) will provide $126.46 \nmillion to finance civil works, resettlement, detailed design, supervision, and contingencies. \n \n                                                 \n6  Interest includes a maturity premium of 0.10%. This is based on the above loan terms and the government\u2019s choice \nof repayment option and dates. \n7  The amount of taxes and duties to be financed in the project has been determined based on the principles that \n(i) the amount of taxes and duties financed by the ADB loan, which represents 2.6% of the project cost, does not \nrepresent an excessive share of the project; (ii) taxes and duties apply only with respect to ADB-financed \nexpenditures; and (iii) the financing of the taxes and duties is material and relevant to the success of the project. \n ", "5 \n19.  The borrower will be the PRC. The government will make the loan proceeds available to \nthe Jiangxi provincial government, which will relend the proceeds to the FMG. The FMG will \ntransfer the loan proceeds and government counterpart funds to the Fuzhou Investment and \nDevelopment Company (FIDC). The FMG will assume the risk of foreign exchange and interest \nrate variation for the ADB loan. The government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its \ndecision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  based  on  these  terms  and \nconditions, and (ii) assurance that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade based on any communication or advice from ADB. The financing plan is in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of \nSource  ($ million)    Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank  100.00    44.16 \nGovernment  126.46    55.84 \n  Total    226.46    100.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\n \n20.  The project is expected to receive a $2.75 million grant from the GEF to finance the \nenvironmental improvement component. Upon approval of the GEF board, the component will \nbe incorporated into the project as additional financing. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  The executing agency is the FMG. The implementing agency is the FIDC. Advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing have been approved. The implementation arrangements \nare summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the project administration manual.8 \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  August 2012\u2013December 2017\nEstimated completion date  31 December 2017\nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Fuzhou Municipal Project Leading Group \nVice-Mayor, Fuzhou Municipal Government (chair) \nHeads of all municipal agencies concerned (members) \n(ii)   Executing agency  Fuzhou Municipal Government \n(iii)  Implementing agency  Fuzhou Investment and Development Company \nProcurement  International  6 contracts  $36.52 million \ncompetitive bidding \nNational competitive  10 contracts  $75.37 million \nbidding \nConsulting services  Various  102 person-months  $1.44 million \nRetroactive financing and/or advance  ADB has approved advance contracting and retroactive financing for road \ncontracting  contracts and consulting services incurred no earlier than 12 months before \nsigning of the Loan Agreement.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n22.  The (i) BRT system, (ii) urban transport (multimodal) hub, (iii) Fenggang River greenway, \nand (iv) four station access roads are technically viable with technology choices based on \nefficient  and  proven  designs.  The  component  for  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity \nbuilding will assist and advise the FMG during detailed design and implementation. The capacity \nof  the  FMG  is  considered  adequate  to  implement  the  project\u2019s  advanced  technical  and \nsustainable transport aspects, based on its performance on past and ongoing urban transport \ndevelopment projects.9 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n23.  The project is economically viable, with an estimated economic internal rate of return of \n14.0% and net present value of CNY132.69 million at a 12.0% discount rate. The estimate \ncovered the three transportation-related outputs for which quantitative economic benefits could \nbe  estimated  (excluding  the  Fenggang  River  greenway  and  institutional  strengthening  and \ncapacity building). The estimated costs include investment in civil works and equipment, land \nacquisition and resettlement, and operation and maintenance. The estimated benefits include \nsavings in vehicle operating cost and travel time. Sensitivity analysis of potential cost overruns \nand  benefit  reductions  demonstrates  that  the  project\u2019s  economic  viability  is  robust.  Other \nbenefits that could not be quantified include reduced costs of flooding, additional land to be \nmade available for urban development, improved air quality, and better quality of life. \n \n24.  The project has both revenue-generating and nonrevenue components. The nonrevenue \ncomponents include road network improvements, the urban transport hub, and the Fenggang \nRiver  greenway.  The  BRT  component  will  generate  revenue  by  collecting  bus  fares  and \nadvertising fees. The financial internal rate of return for the BRT component was estimated to \nbe 7.5% before corporate income tax and 5.2% after tax. As the financial internal rate of return \nafter tax is higher than the 2.2% weighted average cost of capital, the BRT component is \nconsidered financially viable. \n \nC.  Governance \n25.  All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). The relevant sections of \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all procurement \ndocuments and contracts. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment,  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  and  the  PMO.  Specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual \n(footnote 8). An assessment of financial management capacity indicates that the implementing \nand  executing  agencies  carefully  follow  PRC  policies  and  procedures  for  accounting  and \nfinancial  management.  The  implementing  agency  has  strong  accounting  and  financial \nmanagement capacity, as well as experience managing multiple large construction projects. \n \n                                                 \n9  Project Technical Description (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nD.  Poverty and Social \n26.  A poverty and social assessment was conducted during project preparation. The project \nwill benefit a population of over 450,000, of which 65% is urban. Per capita income remains low \nin both rural and urban areas of Jiangxi Province. In Fuzhou, per capita gross domestic product \nis only 48% of the national average, and 6% of the people in the project area are poor\u201478% of \nthe poor living in rural areas and 22% urban. The rural population increasingly depends on \nnonfarm activities for livelihoods. Better economic and employment opportunities, training to \nenhance skills, and social security programs are the main needs of the poor and vulnerable. \n \n27.  An integrated urban transport system will improve mobility and enhance accessibility to \nemployment for all residents. It will contribute to inclusive and balanced development, facilitate \nurbanization, and reduce income disparity. Poor and lower-income residents rely on public and \nnonmotorized transport, which will receive the majority of the project investment. The project is \ndesigned to meet the transport requirements of the rapidly growing urban areas of Fuzhou and \nwill contribute to strengthening industrial growth and generating economic and employment \nopportunities for the local population. Project-affected people will be provided training and skills \nenhancement programs to help them gain employment in emerging industry. Vulnerable groups \naffected by the project will receive special assistance. The project will facilitate the creation of a \nsustainable integrated public transport system for Fuzhou, including road safety measures. A \nsocial development action plan has been prepared to ensure that local people are protected \nfrom construction disturbances and health risks like HIV/AIDS. \n \n28.  Women  have  particular  transport  needs  arising  from  their  various  social  roles  and \npatterns  of  mobility.  Women\u2019s  responsibilities  often  combine  farm  work  and/or  urban \nemployment with travel to markets or taking children to and from school. Women are more likely \nthan men to have personal safety concerns when using public transport. These considerations \nhave important implications for the physical design and operation of public transport systems. \nTo maximize positive gender impacts, the project is designed to meet ADB\u2019s effective gender \nmainstreaming categorization. A project gender action plan has been prepared with a focus on \n(i)  ensuring  women\u2019s  equitable  participation  in  public  consultation  regarding  the  project, \n(ii) incorporating gender-responsive features in the design of urban transport infrastructure that \nwill benefit all vulnerable users, and (iii) promoting increased employment opportunities for \nwomen and building institutional capacity for gender mainstreaming. 10 The implementation of \nthe gender action plan will be financed through the project budget. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n29.  Environment.  The  project  is  category  A  for  environment.  An  environmental  impact \nassessment was prepared and disclosed in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009).11 The introduction of BRT and support for replacing and upgrading of the current bus \nfleet with compressed natural gas technology will provide cleaner and more environmentally \nsustainable  travel  options.  The  Fenggang  River  greenway  will  reduce  the  flood  risk  while \ncreating  a  new  urban  park  and  will  encourage  a  shift  to  nonmotorized  transport.  Project \ndevelopment will occupy an area that is principally agricultural and residential land, scattered \nwoodland, and habitats along the Fenggang River. These habitats are modified and do not have \nsignificant biodiversity value but will be compensated for with the creation of habitats and \nfeatures  of  value  for  biodiversity  in  the  design  of  the  park  and  river-improvement  works. \n                                                 \n10 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nFenggang River improvement will have short-term, localized adverse impacts on hydrology, \nwater quality, and biodiversity but is expected to offer medium- to long-term benefits by reducing \nflood risk and creating a new urban amenity. No cultural relics or historical sites are affected by \nthe project. The project will contribute to cumulative urban development effects on ambient air \nquality and noise levels, greenhouse gas emissions, and pressures on resources and services.  \n \n30.  An environmental management plan has been prepared and sufficient funds (3% of the \nproject cost) allocated for its implementation. This budget includes support for detailed design, \ncapacity  building,  and  independent  monitoring.  Assuming  the  effective  implementation  of \nmitigation measures and monitoring requirements as per the environment management plan, \nthe project is unlikely to have significant adverse environmental impacts but will offer a number \nof benefits. Two rounds of public consultation and a community survey were undertaken. A \ngrievance-redress mechanism has been established to address any issues and complaints that \nmay arise. \n \n31.  Resettlement. The project is category A for involuntary resettlement.12 It will acquire \n216.57  hectares  of  land,  including  153.10  hectares  of  farmland.  Land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  will  affect  7,461  people  in  1,843  households,  including  2,450  people  in  569 \nhouseholds affected by house demolition and relocation. The project does not require any \ntemporary acquisition of land. The project will significantly affect 5,550 people with physical \ndisplacement or the loss of more than 10% of their land and other productive assets. \n \n32.  The cost of land acquisition and resettlement is CNY418.22 million, which includes land \ncompensation, housing relocation, and livelihood support, as well as various taxes, fees, and \ncontingency  funding.  The  executing  agency  has  assured  ADB  that  adequate  counterpart \nfunding will be made available for land acquisition and resettlement, in line with the annual \nfunding requirements stipulated in the resettlement plan. Resettlement implementation will be \nmonitored both internally and externally. A resettlement consultant will be engaged to aid and \nguide the executing agency in effectively implementing the resettlement plan. The PMO's land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  unit  will  coordinate  internal  supervision  and  reporting  of  plan \nimplementation with relevant local government agencies. The executing agency will engage an \nexternal institute for semiannual monitoring and reporting. Public consultations were undertaken \nat  project  preparation  and  will  continue  throughout  the  project  cycle  as  per  the  public \nconsultation schedule prepared under the resettlement plan. A grievance-redress mechanism \nhas been established to address affected people\u2019s concerns. \n \n33.  Indigenous peoples. The project is category C for indigenous peoples. Han Chinese, \nthe PRC\u2019s majority ethnic group, are 99% of Jiangxi Province\u2019s population. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n34.  The  project  is  formulated  to  minimize  potential  risk.  The  FMG  and  FIDC  have \nsuccessfully carried out many large infrastructure projects and have substantial experience in \nproject implementation and management but no experience with ADB-financed projects. To \naddress the lack of experience with ADB procedures, training on ADB safeguards and project \nprocurement and monitoring procedures has been provided during project preparatory technical \nassistance.13 In addition, an estimated 102 person-months of consulting services will further \n                                                 \n12 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 ADB. 2010.
