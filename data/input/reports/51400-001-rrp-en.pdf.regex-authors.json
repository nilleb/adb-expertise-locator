I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed equity \ninvestment  of  up  to  $60,000,000  in  Summit  Power  International  Limited  (Summit)  for  the \nCornerstone Investment in a Leading Power Developer in Bangladesh. The report also describes \nthe proposed administration of an equity investment of up to $15,000,000 to be provided by \nLeading Asia's Private Infrastructure Fund (LEAP)1, and if the Board approves the proposed \nequity investment by ADB, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve \nthe administration of the equity investment by LEAP. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n2.  Project identification. With about 161 million people, Bangladesh has the 8th largest \npopulation in the world. It is also the 10th most densely populated country with 1,090 people per \nsquare kilometer.2 The country has delivered steady economic growth in recent years and remained \nresilient despite recent global economic cycles since 2008; its real gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrowth was 6.6% in 2015 and 7.1% in 2016, led by the industrial sector, which accounts for almost \none-third of GDP.3 Poverty has halved since 2000, the gender gap has narrowed, and the country \nhas made progress in providing access to health and basic social services.4 \n \n3.  Notwithstanding its achievements and economic resilience in recent years, Bangladesh \nfaces major challenges in its effort to maintain this growth trend and move closer to upper middle-\nincome status\u2014and the country\u2019s infrastructure deficiencies remain a major constraint and a top \npriority that needs to be addressed. It ranked 107th in quality of infrastructure in the World \nEconomic Forum\u2019s Global Competitiveness Report, 2017\u20132018, behind India (66th), Sri Lanka \n(85th), and Bhutan (89th) in South Asia.5 Electricity consumption was 304.0 kilowatt-hours (kWh) \nper capita in 2016 and is relatively low by global standards. In comparison, electricity consumption \nper capital is 718.3 kWh in the Philippines, 730.0 kWh in India, and 2,728 kWh in Thailand.6 To \naddress this issue\u2014and to promote a stable power supply that underpins economic growth\u2014the \nGovernment of Bangladesh has prioritized efforts to increase generation capacity, as well as to \nexpand and improve the country\u2019s power transmission and distribution network. To support the \ngovernment\u2019s initiatives, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other international financial \ninstitutions have made investing in Bangladesh\u2019s power infrastructure a strategic priority. \n \n4.  Project design. Independent power producers (IPPs) and quick rental plants own about \n40% of Bangladesh\u2019s current installed capacity. Summit and its group subsidiaries (the Group) \ntogether comprise the largest IPP with a portfolio of 15 power plants and an installed capacity of \n1,201 megawatts (MW).7 Established in 1997, the Group cosponsored Bangladesh\u2019s first power \nplant and was the first IPP to supply electricity to the Bangladesh national grid. Its portfolio \nrepresents 21% of Bangladesh\u2019s privately installed capacity and 9% of total installed capacity.

(KPCL), a company with three heavy fuel oil (HFO) \npower plants. The aggregate installed capacity of KPCL\u2019s portfolio is 277 MW.  \n ", "2 \n \n2016, Summit was established as a Singaporean holding company for the Group to enable it to \nbroaden its access to global financial markets.  \n  \n5.

Market advantages. Bidders for power development projects must demonstrate sufficient \ntechnical expertise and operational experience. As the largest IPP in Bangladesh, the Group has \ncertain competitive and comparative market advantages over its peers in winning bids to develop \npower projects. Therefore, ADB has an opportunity to participate in the imminent expansion of a \nproven power company that is poised to capitalize on business prospects in Bangladesh\u2019s vibrant \nand dynamic power market. This would allow ADB to achieve both developmental and financial \nobjectives, while transferring international best practices in safeguards and governance to the \nGroup as a key shareholder of Summit. \n \n7.  Investee. This proposal involves an equity investment as a cornerstone investor8 and as \npart of an expected initial public offering (IPO) of Summit\u2019s shares on the Singapore Exchange \nLimited (SGX). At the time of Summit\u2019s establishment in 2016, a consortium of international \ninvestors including the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Islamic Development Bank \n(IDB) invested in Summit.9 (Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public \nCommunications Policy) \n \n8.  Integrity due diligence was conducted.10 The results of such analysis are set out in the \nintegrity disclosure document.11 ADB\u2019s review of the entity does not give ADB cause to believe \nthat such entity has been established or is being used for money laundering or terrorism financing \nin  the  jurisdictions  involved  in  the  project.  Enhanced  tax  integrity  due  diligence  was  also \nconducted.12 The  results  of  such  analysis  are  likewise  set  out  in  the  integrity  disclosure \ndocument.13 ADB's review does not give ADB cause to believe that the transaction is being used \nfor cross-border tax evasion. \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n9.  Impact. The project is aligned with the Power System Master Plan for Bangladesh,14 \nespecially the plan to enhance imported energy infrastructure and to construct a robust, high-\nquality power network. It will help address a widening gap between the demand and supply of \nelectricity and natural gas, both of which are critical for continued industrial and economic growth.  \n10.  Outcome. The project's outcome will be increased delivery of affordably priced energy. \n                                                \n8 A cornerstone investor generally refers to a class of investors who commit in advance to invest a fixed amount of \nmoney or buy a fixed number of shares in an IPO under a cornerstone subscription agreement. \n9 IFC invested in Summit both directly and via the IFC Emerging Asia Fund, L.P.; IDB invested via EMA Power \nInvestment Ltd., a joint venture between the IDB Infrastructure Fund II and Daelim Energy Co.

The outputs of the project are (i) new capital raised through an IPO, (ii) installed \ncapacity of power plants increased, (iii) growth of the local economy supported.  \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n12.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nseveral of ADB\u2019s strategic priorities. It is a private sector investment supporting inclusive growth \nand infrastructure development.15 The project is also aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy for Bangladesh16 from both a strategic and thematic perspective as it is envisaged to \nease infrastructure constraints, develop resilient energy infrastructure, encourage private sector \ninvestment, and improve governance.17 The project is in line with ADB\u2019s operational plan for \nregional cooperation and integration given the potential cross-border economic benefits resulting \nfrom (i) the integration of a Bangladesh-focused IPP with global financial markets, via the listing \nin  Singapore,  which  will  help  enhance  the  company\u2019s  governance  by  harmonizing  it  with \ninternational standards, and (ii) the company\u2019s envisaged expansion of its operations into LNG \nimportation, which may involve regional cross-border trade of LNG.18 \n \n13.  Lessons from previous operations. In November 2014, ADB approved a $75 million \nproject finance loan for a 341 MW combined cycle gas turbine power plant promoted by the \nGroup.19 ADB played a catalytic role in helping the company access international lenders to reach \na  successful  financial  close  for  this  project.  The  project  realized  the  envisaged  output  of \ncommissioning additional grid-connected power generation capacity. ADB has also approved \nother private and public sector projects in support of the Bangladesh energy sector, including \nadditional generation capacity, LNG import facilities, and gas transmission networks.20 Therefore, \nthe proposed participation in Summit\u2019s IPO as a cornerstone investor is an example of the ADB\u2019s \nefforts to evolve from a reliable financier of single, private sector projects into an enabler of future \ngrowth, i.e., to assist ADB\u2019s established private sector partners in substantially expanding their \noperations by accessing global equity capital markets and mobilizing sufficient capital to develop \nan entire pipeline of projects. ADB has succeeded with this approach in several peer markets, \nsuch as India and Thailand. \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n14.

For the power sector, \nrelevant laws and regulations include the Electricity Act (1910), the Bangladesh Energy \nRegulatory Commission Act (2003), the Private Sector Power Generation Policy of \nBangladesh (1996, revised in 2004), and the Quick Enhancement of Electricity and Energy \nSupply (Special Provision) Act (2010, amended in 2015). Such laws and regulations \ngovern aspects including electricity generation, transmission, and marketing, as well as \nprovide frameworks for establishing tariffs, incentives, and penalties. For future LNG \noperations, relevant laws include the Bangladesh Petroleum Act (1974), the Bangladesh \nGas Act (2010), and the Petroleum Act (2016). LNG regulations provide a legal framework \nfor all aspects of managing petroleum, gas, liquid hydrocarbons, and other related fuels\u2014\nfrom exploration and importation to storage and transmission. \nOfftake arrangements  (Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications \nPolicy) \nTariff regime  Energy tariffs in Bangladesh are generally regulated according to the negotiated and \nagreed tariff charge between a project bidder and the contractual offtaker, which in \nBangladesh\u2019s power sector is either the BPDB or the BREB. The agreed tariff is enshrined \nin the PPA and typically contains a formula comprising capacity payments, energy \npayments, and start-up payments. These tariffs may vary from one PPA to another, but \ngenerally contain (i) capacity payments for making energy capacity available, (ii) energy \npayments for the net electrical output that is dispatched, and (iii) start-up payments for \nsynchronizing turbines to the grid system.  \nOperations arrangements    \nConstruction  The  Group  relies  on  third-party  contractors  for  the  construction,  operation,  and \narrangements  maintenance of its power plants\u2014particularly for large-scale power plants. In some \ninstances, the Group will enter into turnkey, fixed-price, lump-sum EPC contracts where \nthe contractor assumes total responsibility from plant design to plant performance, and will \nbe liable for penalties if certain parameters or obligations are not met. To that end, the \nGroup has established several long-term strategic partnerships with top-tier suppliers and \ncontractors, such as General Electric and W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4. \nOperation and  Typically, the Group\u2019s plants are able to generate power 24 hours a day, although the \nmaintenance   capacity generated and electricity produced may vary hour-to-hour based on dispatch \ninstructions. For reciprocating engine power plants, the Group\u2019s in-house operating team \ncarries out operation and maintenance (O&M). For CCGT projects, third-party contractors \ntypically manage O&M under medium-term agreements. All plants are professionally \nmaintained on a planned annual schedule and in accordance with the original equipment \nmanufacturer\u2019s recommendations. Gas and liquid fuels that are required to run the power \nplants are procured through gas supply agreements and fuel supply agreements, as \napplicable. Plants are run and monitored during the operations phase, in compliance with \ncommercial contracts, financing agreements, and regulatory requirements. PPA tenors \ngenerally range from five years to 22 years, and the company typically initiates a renewal \nprocess (for each expiring PPA) about two years before the expiry date. \nBPDB = Bangladesh Power Development Board; BREB = Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board; CCGT = combined \ncycle gas turbine; EPC = engineering, procurement, and construction; LNG = liquefied natural gas; O&M = operation \nand maintenance; PPA = power purchase agreement.  \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Summit.  \n \nF.

THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n17.  (Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications \nPolicy) \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n18.  ADB adds significant value as a cornerstone investor, particularly in the book-building \nprocess leading up to the IPO.22 ADB\u2019s presence provides comfort to other potential investors, \nespecially in the areas of corporate governance, and environmental and social safeguards. The \nGroup is the first Bangladesh-based IPP to tap the international equity markets through the SGX. \nThe  project  is  expected  to  yield  significant  developmental  impacts  in  Bangladesh.  With  a \nsuccessful capital raising, Summit can mobilize additional long-term project financing, which is \ncurrently limited and hampers the company\u2019s growth and its investments into Bangladesh\u2019s power \nsector. The IPO also sets a precedent for other emerging markets IPPs with future growth plans \nthat are intending to list their companies on regulated and well-developed exchanges such as the \nSGX. \n \nC.  Risks  \n (Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy) \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n26.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified \ncategory  A  for  environment,  category  A  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  B  for \nindigenous peoples. ADB\u2019s equity investment will be earmarked for Summit\u2019s future pipeline of \nprojects that comply with ADB policy requirements, including safeguards requirements 1\u20133 of the \nSafeguard Policy Statement. ADB\u2019s investment will not be applied towards any existing projects \nor any future HFO-based power projects.23 This will be reflected in the investment documentation. \nThe risks and impacts associated with Summit\u2019s future pipeline of projects are not clear (i.e., \nunknown and/or not identified at this stage). Therefore, the proposed categorizations consider the \npotential risks of any future projects resulting in significant environment, involuntary resettlement, \nor indigenous people impacts. \n \n \n27.

These plants, and \nany future HFO plants, are not expected to comply with the emission requirements under Safeguards requirement 1, \nbut will not be financed by ADB. \n \n ", "6 \n \n28.   An  independent  consultant  conducted  a  corporate  audit  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement requirements.24 (Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) \nof ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy) \n \n29.   (Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications \nPolicy) \n \n30.  The  independent  consultant  documented  these  and  other  audit  findings  and \nrecommendations in a corrective action plan. In line with the requirements of the corrective action \nplan,  Summit  will  update  its  ESMS  and  align  it  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \nrequirements as a condition precedent to ADB\u2019s commitment. Safeguards requirements 1\u20133 and \nthe environmental and social requirements in the ESMS (e.g., categorization checklists, initial \nenvironmental examinations, environmental impact assessment reports, social audit reports, \ndisclosures, and internal and/or third-party reporting) will be mandatory for all future projects using \nADB proceeds. The ESMS will be updated and adopted by Summit before any commitment of \nADB funds. The company will also report to ADB\u2014semiannually for projects under construction \nand annually thereafter\u2014on ongoing compliance with the ESMS and Safeguard Policy Statement \nrequirements. These obligations will be documented to ADB\u2019s satisfaction. \n \n31.  The Group will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy (2001), will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor \nstandards.25 Summit will report yearly to ADB on its compliance with such laws and the measures \ntaken. The project is classified as having some gender elements. It will increase the proportion of \nwomen targeted for jobs during operations to 7.5% (from 5%) and ensure at least 30% of \ncommunity engagement initiatives benefit women. Information disclosure and consultation with \naffected people will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements.26  \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy  \n32.  ADB has advised Summit of its policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations  \n33.  The proposed equity investment is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and \nsingle-project exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n34.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),27 \nADB  will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of \nBangladesh has no objection to the proposed assistance to Summit. ADB will enter into suitable \nfinance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the \nproposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n                                                \n24 AECOM India Private Limited, a qualified and experienced independent expert, conducted the audit.  \n25  ADB. 2003.
