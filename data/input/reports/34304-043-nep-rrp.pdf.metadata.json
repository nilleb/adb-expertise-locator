The  project  will  also  support  and  consolidate \ninstitutional  development  and  improvement  of  governance  in  the  water  sector  in  Kathmandu \nValley. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nCurrent  status.  Kathmandu  Valley  is  characterized  by  high  population growth  of  more \nthan 6% per annum and high population density of more than 10,000 per square kilometer.3 The \npopulation  of  Kathmandu  Valley  is  estimated  at  2.72  million  in  2011  and  3.50  million  in  2016. \nRapid and largely unplanned urban growth, lack of sustainable water sources, and inadequate \npast investments have resulted in poor availability and quality of drinking water.4 Moreover, poor \naccess  to  water  has  caused  increased  disease  incidence,  health  risks,  and  associated \neconomic burdens that disproportionately impact the poor and vulnerable.5\n \n \nDevelopment  partnership.  Earlier  efforts  of  the  Government  of  Nepal  and  various \n4. \ndevelopment partners to improve water supply services in Kathmandu Valley have now started \nto  achieve  the  desired  results.6  The  progress  of  the  Melamchi  Water  Supply  Project  and  the \nKathmandu Valley Water Services Sector Development Program7\n has been encouraging in the \nlast  2  years  despite  frequent  political  disturbances  and  institutional  weaknesses.  These  loans \nwere adversely affected from 2000 to 2006, when several development partners withdrew due \nto the then-prevailing volatile sociopolitical situation and internal conflict in the country leading to \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2006. Technical Assistance to Nepal for Preparing the Kathmandu Valley Water \nDistribution, Sewerage, and Urban Development Project. Manila (TA 4893-NEP). Due to restructuring of ongoing \nloans, the work of the project preparatory TA started in 2009 and the final report was submitted in May 2010. \n\n3   Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Water  Supply  and  Other  Municipal  Infrastructure  and  Services  (accessible  from \n\nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n4   A  2010  baseline  survey  by  an  independent  consultant  (CRISIL)  under  the  project  preparatory  TA  (footnote  2) \nestimates water availability as 20 liters per capita per day and average duration of water supply as 0.4 hours per \nday. Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited, the operator, assesses availability as 45 liters per capita per day. \n5   The World  Health  Organization  has  estimated  that  environmental  factors  account  for  24%  of  the  total  burden  of \ndisease in Nepal. World Health Organization. 2009. Country Profiles of Environmental Burden of Disease. Geneva. \nThe  World  Bank  has  estimated  annual  health  costs  from  inadequate  urban  water  and  sanitation  in  Nepal  to  be  \n$12 million. World Bank. 2007.

Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nKingdom  of  Nepal  for  the  Melamchi  Water  Supply  Project.  Manila  (Loan  1820-NEP,  approved  on  21  December \n2000 and effective on 28 November 2001); and ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the \nBoard  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loans  to  the  Kingdom  of  Nepal  for  the  Kathmandu  Valley  Water  Services  Sector \nDevelopment  Program.  Manila  (Loans  2058-NEP[SF]  and  2059-NEP[SF],  approved  on  18  December  2003  and \neffective  on  7  December  2004).  The  closing  date  of  Loan  1820-NEP  was  31  March  2007  and  was  extended  to  \n31  December  2013.  Loan  2058-NEP(SF)  was  closed  on  31  December  2008.  The  closing  date  of  Loan  2059-\nNEP[SF] was 30 June 2011 and was extended to 31 December 2014. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nreduction  of  the  project  financing  by  $133  million  from  the  estimated  $464  million. 8\n \nConsequently,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  a  major  change  in  scope  and \nimplementation arrangements of these loans in February 2008 to prioritize the use of available \nfunds  for  source  augmentation,  i.e.,  Melamchi  tunnel.  The  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency (JICA), in a parallel financed project, is providing support for a water treatment plant to \nutilize water from Melamchi tunnel. To fully utilize the benefits of ongoing projects, investments \nin the project are necessary and timely. \n \nLessons.  The  project  was  developed  using  lessons  from  previous  ADB  interventions, \n5. \nand country assistance program evaluation9\n which pointed to the need for strategic clarity and \nprioritization of urban infrastructure investments. The implementation arrangements have been \nkept simple with a focus on using the institutional arrangements created under previous projects \nto  ensure  continued  capacity  building  and  sustainability.  An  important  lesson  from  earlier \nprojects  was  to  give  importance  to  rehabilitation  of  networks  along  with  creation  of  assets. \nAccordingly,  the  project  will  focus  on  reducing  nonrevenue  water  (NRW)  and  improving  the \nexisting network. Another lesson is to involve stakeholders; the project has  provided adequate \nresources for participation of various stakeholders. Further, as learned from earlier projects, civil \nworks packages have been kept sufficiently large to attract qualified international bidders. \n \n6. \nFocus  on  improvement  of  efficiencies  and  service  delivery.  The  project  will  utilize \nthe district metering areas10 approach to improve efficiencies and reduce NRW from the level of \nmore  than  50%  to  less  than  20%  in  areas  where  distribution  network  improvement  will  be \ncarried out. With the completion of Melamchi tunnel, Kathmandu Valley will receive an additional \n170 million liters per day (MLD) of water, while the current average availability is only 100 MLD \nagainst a demand of 367 MLD.11\n The project will introduce 24-hour water supply in at least 10% \nof the service area, which will be selected on techno-economic considerations. The project will \nintroduce a comprehensive asset management plan to minimize the lifecycle costs of procuring \nand  maintaining  assets.  The  project  will  adopt  contracts  with  adequate  provisions  to  monitor \nNRW reduction, and develop geographical information system (GIS) to maximize benefits.  \n \n7. \nContext in  country  programming. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Nepal country \npartnership  strategy,12  which  aims  to  support  Nepal\u2019s  peace  and  development  aspirations  by \npromoting the following four pillars: (i) broad-based and inclusive economic growth, (ii) inclusive \nsocial  development,  (iii)  governance  and  capacity  building,  and  (iv)  climate  change  adaptation \nand environmental sustainability. The project fits into the priority sector \u201cwater supply and other \nmunicipal  infrastructure  and  services\u201d  identified  in  the  country  partnership  strategy  and  will \nsupport the country\u2019s peace and development through improved access to basic services. The \nproject is included in the country operations business plan of Nepal.13\n \n \n \n\n                                                \n8  The total project cost was estimated as $464 million at 2000 prices, which was to be funded by the Government of \nNepal and a consortium of development partners: ADB, $120 million; the World Bank, $80 million; Japan Bank for \nInternational  Cooperation,  $52  million;  JICA,  $18  million;  Norwegian  Agency  for  International  Cooperation, \n$28 million; Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, $25 million; the Nordic Development Fund, \n$9  million;  and  the  Organization  of  the  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  Fund  for  International  Development,  \n$14 million. The World Bank withdrew in 2002, the Norwegian Agency for International Cooperation in 2005, and \nthe Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency in 2006 causing a shortfall of $133 million. \n\n9   ADB. 2009.

The  expected  outcome  is  improved  access,  efficiency,  and  reliability  of \nwater  supply  services  to  the  residents  of  Kathmandu  Valley  including  poor  women  and  men. \nThe project will prioritize underserved areas and poor sections of the population in Kathmandu \nValley. Piped water through individual household connection will relieve women of the drudgery \nof  managing  water,  thereby  giving  them  more  time  for  social  and  economically  productive \nactivities.  The  impact  and  outcome  of  the  project  will  be  closely  linked  with  the  success  of \nongoing projects. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  project  will  follow  the  investment  priorities  identified  in  the  government\u2019s  capital \n  for  annual  investments  in  water  supply \n\n9. \ninvestment  and  asset  management  program,  2010,14\ninfrastructure in Kathmandu Valley. The project outputs will include the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nOutput 1: Rehabilitation and expansion of the water supply system. This will \ninclude  (a)  a  bulk  distribution  system  (BDS),  distribution  network  improvement \n(DNI),  and  service  reservoirs;  (b)  provision  of  individual  connections  to  citizens, \nespecially  the  poor  and households  headed  by women;  (c)  provision  of 24-hour \nwater supply in at least 10% of the service area; and (d) efficiency improvement \nin  water  supply  through  provision  of  bulk  and  individual  meters,  reduction  of \nNRW,  and  reduction  of  energy  losses  in  electromechanical  machinery.  This \noutput  will  have  two  distinct  geographic  areas.  DNI  areas  will  be  the  areas  in \nwhich both BDS and DNI works will be implemented and non-DNI areas15\n will be \nthe areas in which only BDS works will be implemented. \n \nOutput  2:  Support for operating  and financial  improvements,  and  capacity \nbuilding. This will include (a) capacity building; improvement of governance; and \nachievement  of  time-bound  targets  as  per  the  agreed  business  plan  of \nKathmandu  Upatyaka  Khanepani  Limited  (KUKL),  the  Kathmandu  Valley  Water \nSupply  Management  Board  (KVWSMB),  and  the  Water  Supply  Tariff  Fixation \nCommission;16\n (b) operationalization of the NRW assessment and reduction plan;  \n(c)  operationalization  of  the  asset  management  plan;  (d)  updating  of  the  water \nsupply GIS database; (e) improvement of KUKL\u2019s responsiveness to customers; \n(f)  community  participation  and  public  education  for  health,  hygiene,  and \nbehavior  change  in,  for  example,  water  conservation,  good  water  management \npractices  including  3Rs  (reduce,  reuse,  and  recycle),  rainwater  harvesting;  \n(g)  a  gender  equality  and  social  inclusion  action  plan;  (h)  monitoring  and \nevaluation; and (i) support for project management. This output will continue and \nenhance support being provided under the ongoing loans. \n\n                                                \n14 The Capital Investment and Asset Management Program 2010\u20132025 was prepared with ADB assistance under the \nproject preparatory TA (footnote 2) and was endorsed by all stakeholders in May 2010. The estimated investment \nrequirements  are  $250  million  for  water  supply  in  Kathmandu  Valley  in  addition  to  the  ongoing  Melamchi  Water \nSupply Project and Kathmandu Valley Water Services Sector Development Program (footnote 7) loans. The project \nwill meet the priority investment needs for 2011\u20132016. \n\n15 The capital investment and asset management program proposes covering distribution network improvement in a \nphased manner. While a substantial part of KUKL\u2019s service area will be covered with DNI works under this project, \nthe remaining parts of service areas (non-DNI areas) will benefit from increased availability of water.  \n\n16 KVWSMB is the owner of water supply and wastewater assets. The Water Supply Tariff Fixation Commission is the \nregulator  of  water  supply  and  wastewater  services.  The  business  plan  of  KUKL,  the  asset  operator,  will  include \nactions for  operating and financial  improvements  and  is  under  preparation by  a  team  of consultants  recruited  by \nKUKL under the Kathmandu Valley Water Services Sector Development Program (Loan 2059-NEP[SF]). \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nD. \n \n10. \nexpenditure category are in the project administration manual (PAM).17\n \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $130  million  (Table  1).

The loan will have a 32-year term, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an  interest  charge  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan \nand project agreements. The ADB loan, which is 61.5% of the total project cost, will be used to \nfinance part of the civil works and equipment (output 1) and all components of output 2 including \nconsultants, recurrent costs, transportation, insurance, and financing charges.  \n \n12. \nThe government  will  contribute  $50 million  or  38.5%  of the total  project  cost to finance \ntaxes and duties, resettlement costs, and part of the civil works and equipment. The government \nwill provide the loan proceeds to KVWSMB in a loan\u2013grant mix of 50:50 at an interest rate of 9% \nper annum on the loan portion and a term of 30 years, including a grace period of 7 years. The \ngovernment will provide the counterpart government funds to KVWSMB in a loan\u2013grant mix of \n50:50 at an interest rate of 3% per annum on the loan portion for a term of 20 years, including a \ngrace  period  of  5  years.  KVWSMB  will  provide  the  loan  proceeds  and  the  government \ncounterpart  funds  to  KUKL  based  on  the  existing  30-year  lease  and  operating  agreement \nbetween KVWSMB and KUKL. These arrangements will be described in a subsidiary financing \nagreement,  acceptable  to  ADB,  to  be  signed  and  effective  before  KUKL  can  receive  the  loan \nproceeds  and  the  counterpart  funds.  The  government  will  assume  the  foreign  exchange  risk. \nThe financing plan is in Table 2.  \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan  \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \nTotal \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n80.00 \n50.00 \n130.00 \n\n \n \n \n \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n61.5 \n38.5 \n100.0 \n\n                                                \n17 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5 \n\n13. \nThe government has requested parallel cofinancing of $40 million as a loan from JICA to \nfinance  part  of  the  project.

Nonrevenue  water  assessment  and  reduction  plan.  The  water  supply  system  in \nKathmandu  Valley  is  characterized  by  high  NRW.19\n  Lack  of  proper  metering  compounds  the \nproblem  of  NRW  assessment.  To  ensure  sustainability  of  the  project  operations,  KUKL  will \nimplement  a  comprehensive  NRW  assessment  and  reduction  plan  with  specific  time-bound \ntargets. The project will facilitate integration of the NRW reduction approach in DNI packages as \npart of output 1 and will support KUKL, under output 2, to implement the NRW assessment and \nreduction plan. \n \n16. \nAsset  management  plan.  Currently, KUKL lacks focus on timely repair and preventive \nmaintenance  of  assets.  To  ensure  sustainability  of  project  operations,  KUKL  will  implement  a \ncomprehensive asset management plan focusing on an integrated approach to repair, maintain, \nrehabilitate, and replace assets with the objective of minimizing lifecycle costs. The project will \nhelp KUKL implement the asset management plan. \n \nUpdating  of the water supply  geographical information  system. Some efforts have \n17. \nbeen  made  to  develop  a  water  supply  GIS, 20\n  which  requires  integration  on  a  proper  GIS \nplatform.  The  project  will  support,  under  output  2,  updating  and  operationalizing  the  existing \nGIS. This will be coordinated with an asset condition survey to ensure a consistent approach to \nfuture network development. A proper GIS will improve operationalization of the NRW reduction \nplan and asset management plan. \n \n18. \nCoordination  with  Melamchi  tunnel.  The  project  assumes  availability  of  170  MLD \nwater  from  Melamchi  tunnel.  Assessment  of  current  progress  reveals  that  completion  of  the \ntunnel  is  likely  to  be  delayed  from  its  scheduled  completion  in  September  2013,  but  is \nanticipated  to  be  completed  by  2014.  The  utility  of  BDS  and  reservoirs  is  dependent  upon \navailability  of  water  from  the  tunnel.  The  project  will  prioritize  implementation  of  the  DNI \ncomponents, which will be useful even without water from Melamchi tunnel. The government will \nmonitor progress of Melamchi tunnel to ensure completion with minimum delay. \n \n19. \nContracts  for  monitoring  nonrevenue  water  reduction.  Special  provisions  for \nmonitoring  NRW  reduction  in  DNI  packages  will  be  developed  and  proper  conditions  will  be \nincorporated in the DNI bidding documents to provide incentives for NRW reduction. \n \n \n\n                                                \n19 The 2010 baseline survey (footnote 4) estimates NRW as high as 55%, though KUKL claims NRW to be around \n40%. These estimates are based on intermittent supply, which will have to be increased substantially if NRW is to \nbe benchmarked against similarly situated water utilities with continuous water supply. \n\n20 A GIS database of KUKL\u2019s water supply was prepared in 2008 based on computer-aided design digital maps with \nJICA support. Also, the Kathmandu Valley Town Development Committee prepared detailed digital land use maps \nof municipalities in Kathmandu Valley based on aerial photographs taken from late 2006 to early 2007.  \n\n\f \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \n\n7 \n\n20. \nEconomic  analysis.  The  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  is  18.1%; \nthe net present value is $20.1 million. The EIRR is higher than the economic opportunity cost of \ncapital  estimated  at  12.0%  indicating  sufficiently  high  economic  return.  The  result  is  robust \nagainst  downside  risks,  as  brought  out  by  sensitivity  analysis  carried  out  with  (i)  capital  costs \nincreased  by  10%,  (ii)  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  increased  by  10%,  and  \n(iii)  benefits  reduced  by  10%.  The  EIRR  varies  from  14.8%  to  18.1%;  the  most  sensitive  risk \nfactor is a delay in completing Melamchi tunnel.21\n \n \n21. \nFinancial  analysis.  The estimated financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is 7.46%; the \nnet present value is $29.37 million. The FIRR is higher than the weighted average cost of capital \nestimated at 3.5% indicating reasonable financial return. The result is robust against downside \nrisks, as brought out by sensitivity analysis carried out with (i) capital costs increased by 10%, \n(ii)  O&M  costs  increased  by  10%,  and  (iii)  revenues  reduced  by  10%.  The  FIRR  varies  from \n6.64% to 7.46%; the most sensitive risk factors are an increase in capital costs and decrease in \nrevenues.  Based  on  the  proposed  tariff  schedule,  monthly  water  bills  will  account  for  0.7%  to \n1.4%  of  monthly  income,  which  is  significantly  below  the  5%  ratio  generally  assumed  to \ndetermine  household  affordability.  The  project  is  financially  viable  and  affordable  for  all, \nincluding poor households.22\n \n \nFinancial  sustainability.  The  capacity  building  and  public\u2013private  partnership  (CBP) \n22. \nteam,  mobilized  in  KUKL  under  the  ongoing  Kathmandu  Valley  Water  Services  Sector \nDevelopment  Program,  will  support  operating  and  financial  improvements  of  KUKL.  The  CBP \nteam  will  prepare  a  business  plan  for  KUKL  for  long-term  financial  sustainability  focusing  on  \n(i) rationalization of tariffs to recover O&M costs, depreciation, and financing costs in a phased \nmanner;  (ii)  improvement  of  collection  efficiency;  (iii)  recovery  of  arrears  with  adequate \nprovisioning for bad debts; (iv) adoption of prudential financial norms; and (v) computerization of \noperations and financial management. The operationalization of the asset management plan will \nhelp  KUKL  achieve  higher  operating  efficiencies,  and  better  financial  performance.  The \ngovernment  will  ensure  that  KUKL,  with  support  from  the  CBP  team,  undertakes  preparation, \nadoption,  and  effective  implementation  of  the  business  plan.  Further,  the  government  will \nensure that the tariffs are revised every year to achieve financial sustainability. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n23. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  PID.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 17). Risk assessment was made with the help of three tools \nspecifically  developed  for  Nepal:  (i)  peace  filter  for  design  and  implementation  of  project,  (ii) \ngovernance risk assessment tool, (iii) disaster and climate change risks screening tool.23\n Based \non these assessments, some of the mitigation measures incorporated in project design are to (i) \nestablish a mechanism for regular voluntary disclosure of project-related information to citizens; \n(ii) develop and utilize a system of e-procurement; (iii) develop and update a project website to \nenhance  transparency  in  project  implementation,  procurement,  and  safeguards;  and  (iv) \nestablish a grievance redress mechanism to ensure quick and effective relief. \n \n\n                                                \n21 Details are included in the Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Details are included in the Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Peace Filter for Design and Implementation of Project; Governance Risk Assessment and Management Plan; and \nDisaster and Climate Change Risks Screening Tool (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n24. \nKUKL\u2019s  institutional  arrangements.  KUKL\u2019s  institutional  structure,  designed  at  the \ntime  of  unbundling  the  urban  water  subsector  in  2006,  is  ready  for  further  refinements.  The \ngovernment will establish a proper institutional structure to enforce accountability of KUKL to the \ngovernment and citizens, and to ensure sustainability of operations. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n25. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  A  poverty  and  social \nanalysis  has  been  completed 24   and  the  project  gives  priority  to  connecting  all  poor  and \nhouseholds  headed  by  women  to  the  piped  water  supply  system  in  the  project  area.  The \ngovernment  and  KUKL  will  reform  the  current  water  connections  policy  (2008)  to  facilitate \nindividual  water  connections  to  the  poor,  socially  excluded,  and  households  headed  by \nwomen.25  Connection  fees  will  be  reduced  for  poor  households  under  the  project.  A  gender \nequality and social inclusion26 action plan was prepared with clear targets, responsibilities, and \nresource  allocation.  The  project  has  also  prepared  a  community  awareness  and  participation \nplan27\n  to  involve  key  stakeholders  for  widespread,  ongoing,  and  meaningful  participation.  PID \nwill  implement  the  gender  equality  and  social  inclusion  and  community  awareness  and \nparticipation  plan,  with  support  from  the  community  awareness  and  participation  consultant \nrecruited under the project. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n26. \nSocial  safeguards. The project is classified as category B for involuntary resettlement \nand  category  C for  indigenous  peoples  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009). 28     The  project  does  not  require  any  land  acquisition.  The  impacts  are  limited  to \ntemporary  disruption  of  business  activities,  and  temporary  shifting  of  vendors  and  hawkers \nduring  construction  works  within  the  right-of-way  for  the  BDS,  and  DNI  works.  A  resettlement \nplan,29  including  the  grievance  redress  mechanism,  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement.  A  resettlement  framework 30   was  prepared  to  address  small \ncomponents  to  be  defined  through  detailed  design  after  approval  by  the  ADB  Board  of \nDirectors.31\n Temporary impacts will be limited and compensation for lost income will be provided \nto  those  affected  as  per  the  resettlement  plan.  Land  required  for  service  reservoirs  for  the \nproject was acquired under the ongoing Melamchi Water Supply Project. All land is to be made \nready for construction before the first disbursement. No adverse impacts on indigenous peoples \nare  anticipated  as  the  project  focuses  on  rehabilitating  the  existing  water  supply  network  in \nurban areas. Meaningful and widespread consultations will continue with all communities in the \nproject area. \n \nEnvironmental safeguards. The project is classified as category B for environment. An \n27. \ninitial  environmental  examination  (IEE) 32\n  and  environmental  management  plan  including  a \ngrievance  redress  mechanism  were  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement. The IEE concludes that no significant adverse impacts are anticipated and that the \n                                                \n24 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 KUKL\u2019s existing water connection policy (2008) requires a land ownership certificate and certificate of construction \ncompletion  from  the  respective  local  authorities.  Several  poor  households  cannot  meet  these  requirements  and, \ntherefore, are not provided with water connections. \n\n26 Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Community Awareness and Participation Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 ADB. 2010.

Manila. \n29 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Small capital expenditures to be defined after ADB Board approval are primarily related to improving the existing \n\nwater system not covered under the main DNI and BDS packages being implemented by the project. \n\n32 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9 \n\nnet environmental benefits will be positive and large with fewer waterborne diseases and better \npublic  health.  To  mitigate  adverse  impacts  of  increased  generation  of  wastewater,  the \nKathmandu  Urban  Environment  Improvement  Project  has  been  proposed  to  focus  on \nrehabilitating  and  expanding  the  sewerage  network  and  wastewater  treatment. 33   An \nenvironmental assessment and review framework34\n was prepared to address small components \nto  be  defined  through  detailed  design  after  ADB  Board  approval.  Additional  oversight  and \nmitigation  measures  will  be  taken  for  pipe-laying  works  along  roads  passing  through  heritage \nareas including permission from the Department of Archaeology prior to construction. The IEE \nand  the  environmental  management  plan  will  be  updated  during  detailed  design  and  be \nincorporated in contract documents. \n \nClimate  change  adaptation  and  mitigation.  Based  on  the  analysis  carried  out  using \n28. \nthe  disaster  and  climate  change  risks  screening  tool, 35\n  the  project  will  incorporate,  during \ndetailed technical designs, adequate climate change adaptation measures for the risks related \nto  earthquakes,  landslides,  floods,  and  climate  change.  The  project  will  facilitate  water  and \nenergy savings, which will help mitigate the impacts of climate change. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n29.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.36\n The integrated benefits and impacts of the \nproject are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nTransition to a federal \nstructure, the peace process, \nand political instability may \naffect project implementation. \nWater from Melamchi tunnel \nmay not be available in time. \n\nDelays in project \nimplementation, including \navailability of clear sites, may \nresult in cost and time \noverruns. \n\nLack of coordination among \nvarious agencies may result in \nsuboptimal outcome. \n\nKUKL may not implement the \nproposed institutional \narrangements, staffing, and \nmeasures for financial \nsustainability. \n\nMitigating Measures \nDevelopment partners will maintain close dialogue with the government and other \nstakeholders to ensure that the development and reform process is not derailed \nand keeps its momentum beyond the political challenges. The project will involve \nkey stakeholders to generate consensus for its successful implementation. \nMPPW and ADB will monitor strongly to ensure that the tunnel work is completed \nwith minimum delays. Priority will be given to distribution network improvement \npackages, which will benefit citizens even without water from Melamchi tunnel. \nRegular ADB missions will be fielded to update the risk assessment and suggest \nfurther mitigation measures. \nMPPW and KUKL will assign qualified staff to PID and minimize staff turnover. \nThe design, supervision, and management consultant will support project \nmanagement, safeguards, reporting, and training on FIDIC contracts. Large \ncontract packages will be designed to attract international bidders. MPPW will \nensure possession and security of lands acquired for project works. Regular ADB \nmissions and the participation of the Nepal Resident Mission in meetings will be \nensured. \nThe project steering committee will provide direction and guidance for \ncoordination. The roles, responsibilities, and functions of PID, KUKL, and MPPW \nfor project implementation will be clearly delineated. The interagency coordination \ncommittee will ensure effective coordination. \nMPPW and KUKL will review and establish a proper institutional structure for \nKUKL to ensure its accountability to the government and citizens. MPPW will \nensure competent staff in KUKL. The capacity building and public\u2013private \npartnership team will support KUKL to improve its operating and financial \nsystems. Preparation of a business plan including financial reforms is a condition \nfor disbursement. \n\n                                                \n33  Project preparatory TA for the Kathmandu Urban Environment Improvement Project is scheduled for management \n\napproval in 2011. \n\n34 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 Disaster and Climate Change Risks Screening Tool (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n36 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nLack of proper oversight for \nutilization of funds \n\nPID will proactively disclose project information (including citizens\u2019 charter) and \nconduct public audits.

PID will widely disseminate ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) to citizens. \nThe NRW assessment and reduction plan is an important assurance given by the \ngovernment. Adequate resources are provided and suitable mechanisms will be \ndeveloped in the project. Amendment of the water connection policy is a condition \nfor disbursement. \n\nNRW reduction targets may \nnot be achieved and the water \nconnection policy may not be \namended. \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank;  FIDIC  =  F\u00e9d\u00e9ration  Internationale  Des  Ing\u00e9nieurs-Conseils,  French  for  the \nInternational  Federation  of  Consulting  Engineers;  KUKL  =  Kathmandu  Upatyaka  Khanepani  Limited;  MPPW  = \nMinistry of Physical Planning and Works; NRW = nonrevenue water; PID = Project Implementation Directorate. \nSources: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n30. \nThe  government  and  KUKL  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  will \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  the \nPAM (footnote 17) and loan documents.
