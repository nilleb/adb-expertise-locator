The  project  will \nenhance  climate  resilience  and  will  be  in  line  with  the  \u201c3Es\u201d  of  economy,  environment,  and \nequity as outlined in the Urban Operational Plan of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe six countries of the GMS form a geographically contiguous region and an important \ncluster  of  economic  activity. 4  Despite  wide  divergence  in  their  current  level  of  economic \ndevelopment,  the  GMS  countries  are  following  increasingly  similar  urban  development \ntrajectories. Key drivers of urban development and regional integration include the anticipation \nof  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  Economic  Community  in  2015, \nincreased domestic and international migration within the region, the continued economic rise of \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  significant  improvements  in  road  networks  and \nconnectivity, increasingly ubiquitous and improving cellphone and internet coverage, and great \npotential  and growing  demand for  tourism  and  related  activities. The  three  economic  corridors \ndefined under the GMS framework form a network of important routes that connect some of the \nlargest cities in the GMS, including Bangkok, Ha Noi, Ho Chi Minh City, Kunming, Nanning, and \nPhnom Penh.5 \n \n4. \nThe project, covering Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), and \nViet  Nam,  represents  the  second  phase  of  the  ongoing  GMS  Corridor  Towns  Development \nProject  in these  countries,  which  supports  urban  development  along the East\u2013West  Economic \nCorridor  and  the  SEC. 6 The  focus  on  developing  towns  along  economic  corridors  aims  to \nmaximize  the  benefits  of  increased  trade  and  traffic  flows  so  as  to  strengthen  their \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Second Greater Mekong Subregion Corridor Towns \n\nDevelopment Project (TA 8425-REG). \n\n3  ADB. 2013.

Manila. \n4  The  GMS  countries  are  Cambodia,  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (specifically  Yunnan  province  and  Guangxi \n\nZhuang Autonomous Region), the Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n\n5  The three economic corridors are the North\u2013South Economic Corridor, the East\u2013West Economic Corridor, and the \nSouthern Economic Corridor.

The  development  of \nenvironmental  infrastructure  will  promote  green  growth  and  improve  the  climate  resilience  of \nthese  towns  in  the  future.  The  project  supports  the  first  four  strategic  thrusts  of  the  GMS \nstrategic  framework,  2012\u20122022:  (i)  strengthening  infrastructure  linkages;  (ii)  facilitating  cross-\nborder  trade,  investment,  and  tourism;  (iii)  enhancing  private  sector  participation  and \ncompetitiveness; and (iv) developing human resources. 7 \n \n5. \nTowns along the SEC, which links Thailand with southern Viet Nam through Cambodia, \nand the North\u2013South Economic Corridor, with one branch that links the Lao PDR with the PRC, \nThailand, and Myanmar and another which links Ha Noi to the cities of Kunming and Nanning in \nthe PRC, are well-positioned to serve as dynamic centers of investment and economic growth.8 \nThe  strategic  location  of  the  corridor  towns  provides  the  stimulus  for  increased  trade  and \ninvestment. Access to markets will provide incentives for local economies in the hinterlands of \nthe  corridor  towns.  Given  these  development  opportunities,  and  with  the  rapid  growth  of  the \nurban  population  and  expansion  of these  areas, several  corridor  towns,  including  Kampot  and \nSihanoukville  in  Cambodia  along  the  SEC,  are  facing  demands  for  urban  infrastructure  and \nessential support services. \n \n6. \nKampot  is  a  provincial  capital  and  an  agricultural,  commercial,  service,  and  regional \ntourism  center,  with  a  population  of  about  35,000  in  2013  and  an  average  population  growth \nrate  of  about  0.5%  (compared  with  the  national  average  of  just  under  2.0%).  Its  strategic \nlocation  provides  excellent  road-based  connections  in  the  SEC  area  and  to  the  capital  city \nPhnom  Penh.  The  town  has  significant  opportunities  for  increased  economic  activities  and \ninvestments.  While  tourism  development  is  at  an  early  stage,  visitor  numbers  are  rising \nsignificantly,  with  tourism  potential  linked  to  Kampot\u2019s  heritage  architecture,  proximity  to  the \nBokor National Park, and a new river port that will offer seaborne access to the outlying holiday \nislands.  Currently,  there  is  no  reticulated  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  in  Kampot,  and \nurban flooding during the wet season is not uncommon as most drainage infrastructure was built \nduring  the  French  colonial  times.  Solid-waste  collection  is  contracted  out  to the  private  sector, \nwith collected waste being disposed of in a poorly managed dump site. \n \n7. \nSihanoukville is a regional center and provincial capital with an expanding economy and \nsignificant levels of urbanization, with an average population growth rate of about 2.5%. With a \npopulation  of  just  over  77,500  in  2013,  the  city\u2019s  recent  investment  in  strategic  infrastructure, \nincluding  an  international  port  (Cambodia\u2019s  only  deep-sea  port),  an  airport,  and  a  special \neconomic  zone,  coupled  with  a  beach  environment  that  has  given  the  town  an  international \nresort  status,  has  led  to  an  expansion  of  its  services,  transport  logistics,  tourism,  and  industry \nsectors. More than 85% of the working population is engaged in the services sector, and gross \ndomestic  product  per  capita  ($1,345  in  2013)  is  about  25%  higher  than  the  national  average. \nHowever,  the  pace  of  economic  growth  has  not  been  matched  by  investment  in  essential \nsupporting environmental infrastructure. In particular, environmental degradation means that the \nvisual  environment  is  poor  in  most  places  (affecting  both  the  resident  environment  and  water \nquality  at  the  tourist  beaches),  and  poor  urban  planning  and  governance  has  led  to  urban \nsprawl,  scattered  developments,  and  unsustainable  land  use.  Most  roadside  drains  are  either \nmissing or in need of repair and most of the town is affected by periodic flooding during the rainy \nseason. Solid-waste collection is contracted out to the private sector, with collected waste being \ndisposed of in a makeshift dump site. \n\n                                                \n7  ADB.  2011.

Key  lessons  learned  from  completed  or  ongoing  ADB-financed \nprojects  in  urban  development,  including  the  first  phase  of  the  GMS  Corridor  Towns \nDevelopment  Project  in  Cambodia,  are  that  (i)  civic  participation  and  demand-driven \ndevelopment activities enhance local ownership; (ii) capacity building requires proper planning, \nadequate targeting, and up-front implementation as it is a long-term effort; (iii) institutional and \npolicy  reform  should  be based  on realistic  assessments  of  timing, resource  requirements,  and \npolitical  will;  (iv)  financial  cost  recovery  is  critical  to  project  sustainability;  (v)  streamlined \napproaches  to  procurement  and  contract  packaging  secures  effective  project  implementation; \nand (vi) strong executing agency leadership and adequate selection of project staff with clearly \ndefined  roles  and  responsibilities  are  crucial  for  effective  implementation.  These  lessons  are \nclosely aligned to the project, which has a strong capacity development component, optimizes \nthe value of community involvement, and adopts a business plan approach to revenue collection \nand operation and maintenance (O&M). Executing agencies will also receive start-up support on \nADB procedures upon project commencement. \n \nRelated  policies  and  strategies. The project is in conformity with government policies \n9. \nand  strategies,  including  the  National  Strategic  Development  Plan  (NSDP)  and  other  national \npolicies  and  strategies,  including  the  National  Policy  on  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation. 9 The \nproject  is  consistent  with  the  NSDP\u2019s  policy  to  promote  balanced  regional  distribution  of \nstrategically  located  small  and  medium-sized  towns  and  the  context  provided  by  the  Law  on \nAdministrative Management of the Capital, Provinces, Municipalities, Districts and Khans.10 \n \n10. \nThe  project  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  Cambodia,  ADB\u2019s \nUrban Operational Plan, the GrEEEn Cities approach, ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, the GMS \nEconomic  Cooperation  Program  Strategic  Framework, the GMS  Urban  Development  Strategic \nFramework  2015\u20132022,  and  the  GMS  Regional  Investment  Framework  Implementation  Plan \n(2014\u20132018). 11  The  towns  under  this  project  were  prioritized  under  the  GMS  Regional \nInvestment Framework as key towns located along the GMS economic corridors. In addition, as \npart  of  project  preparation,  strategic  local  economic  development  plans  (SLEDPs),  which \npresent  the  medium-term  strategy,  planning,  and  investment  plan  for  each  town,  have  been \nprepared.  The  SLEDPs  are  based  on  technical  assessments  of  potential  investments  in  four \ndimensions  (economic  development,  environment,  equity,  and  good  governance),  as  well  as \nextensive  stakeholder  consultations  and  discussions.  The  SLEDPs,  which  enhance  existing \nprovincial  master  plans  and  anchor  these  to  the  larger  regional  context  of  the  GMS  economic \ncorridors, will be refined and endorsed during project implementation. \n \n\n                                                \n9  Government  of  Cambodia,  Ministry  of  Planning. 2014.

This \n22. \nwill  be  achieved  through  improved  wastewater  management  in  Kampot  and  improved  solid-\nwaste management and urban drainage upgrading in both towns. The selected projects match \nthe priorities accorded by the government. These investments are technically feasible and use \noptimum  design  solutions  and  standards  and  where  the  technology  for  undertaking  the  civil \nworks and O&M can be managed by the provincial and municipal authorities. Climate resilient \ndesign  has  been  ensured  including,  for  example,  through  constructing  a  retaining  wall  around \nthe  wastewater  treatment  plant  in  Kampot  to  provide  additional  flood  protection,  and  by  sizing \nroad  drainage  in  both  Kampot  and  Sihanoukville  to  allow  for  future  rainfall  increases. \nAppropriate levels of capacity building and training are assured in the project loan.  \n \n23. \nThe  project  recognizes  the  weak  institutional  capacity  of  the  provincial  and  municipal \nauthorities  to  plan  and  manage  urban  sector  development,  implement  and  operate  urban \ninfrastructure,  and  deliver  essential  urban  services.  This  will  be  addressed  through  targeted \ntraining and institutional capacity building. \n \nB. \n \n24. \nAn economic analysis was undertaken for all of the subproject components to determine \ntheir viability, using the computation of economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as the indicator. \nThe base-case results indicate all components are economically viable with an estimated EIRR \nexceeding  the  assumed  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12%.  The  EIRR  results  range \nfrom  14.5%  to  18.1%  for  Kampot  and  13.9%  to  14.3%  for  Sihanoukville.  All  subprojects  were \ngenerally  also  viable  under  adverse scenarios  in  which  costs  were  higher or  benefits  lower  by \n10% than the base case.12 This included a 10% increase in capital cost, 10% increase in O&M, \n10% reduction in benefits, and a 1-year delay in realization of benefits. \n \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                \n12 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f8 \n\nA financial analysis was conducted for both the revenue- and the nonrevenue-generating \n25. \nsubprojects  of  each  town  to  confirm  the  sustainability  of  the  investment.  The  analysis \nestablished that, for all towns, sufficient counterpart funds for their investment components will \nbe  available.  None  of  the  public  entities  involved  in  the  operation  of  the  respective  project \ncomponents such as, for example, sanitation or solid-waste management, is corporatized. They \nare  all  general  government  sector  units  without  separate  accounts.  Therefore,  a  financial \ninternal rate of return has not been calculated. The tariffs collected for the revenue-generating \ncomponents (e.g., sanitation and solid-waste management) currently do not fully cover cost for \nO&M, but will be adjusted over time to meet these requirements. Any funding gap for meeting \nfull  O&M  cost  will  be  covered  by  the  provincial  governments,  a  commitment  that  has  been \ncovenanted in the loan agreement \n \nC. \n \n26. \nAssessment  shows  that  the  executing  agency  in  Cambodia  has  experience  with  the \nfinancial  management  and  fund  disbursement  systems  applicable  to  ADB  projects.  It  has \ndeveloped  institutional  capacity  to  undertake  international  and  national  competitive  bidding  for \ncivil  works  and  goods.  The  project  financial  management  risk  is  considered  high  primarily  at \nprovincial  and  city  levels. This  refers  particularly  to tariff setting  and  the allocation  of sufficient \nfunding for O&M  of  urban  infrastructure.  Capacity  development  and  training  assistance  will  be \nprovided  to  the  PMU  and  PIUs  on  financial  and  procurement  management  and  fund \ndisbursement.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the Government of Cambodia and the MPWT. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (PAM).13 \n\nGovernance \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n \n27. \nFrom  the  poverty  and  social  analysis  conducted,  the  project  is  classified  as  general \nintervention.14 The overall project social impacts are expected to be positive, with improvements \nto the quality of life for people in both towns. The project will result in improved climate-resilient \ninfrastructure for the participating towns benefitting the full range of social strata, including the \nurban poor and other vulnerable groups in each town. The proposed tariffs for both wastewater \nand  solid-waste  management  have  been  assessed  as  affordable  for  low-income  groups.  The \nsubproject for  improving  urban  drainage  in  Kampot  and  Sihanoukville  towns  will  improve flood \nprotection for the project-affected people, their homes, and their property at a local level. Poor \nand  vulnerable  households  located  in  low-lying  flood-prone  areas  and  who  experience \ninsufficient and/or lack basic environmental sanitation services stand to benefit the most. \n \n28. \nThe  subprojects  will  create  employment  opportunities  during  construction  and  skills \ncapacity  development  for  local  people,  especially  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  such  as \nfemale  heads  of  households  or  ethnic  minorities  groups.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and \nsocial  strategy  includes  measures  to  address  social  impacts  and  enhance  distribution  of \nbenefits resulting from the project. \n \nThe  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  gender  analysis \n29. \nconcluded  that  women  in  the  subproject  areas  are  at  potential  risk  of  not  realizing  the  full \npotential of project benefits and opportunities if gender issues concerning women\u2019s employment \n\n                                                \n13 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 Summary  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social  Strategy,  and  Gender  Action  Plan  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n\f9 \n\nopportunities  and  sector  representation  in  decision  making  are  not  mainstreamed  in  project \nactivities.  Accordingly,  a  gender  action  plan  has  been  prepared  aiming  at  (i)  ensuring  gender \nissues  are  mainstreamed  in  project  planning  and  implementation;  (ii)  addressing  specific \nimpacts  and  risks,  which  may  affect  women  differently  or  disproportionally  compared  to  men; \nand (iii) enhancing participation of women in project benefits. \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n \nSocial  safeguards.  The  safeguard  category  for  involuntary  resettlement  is  B  in \n30. \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  One  resettlement  plan  has  been \nprepared  for  Kampot  where  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR)  impacts  are  triggered.  A \ntotal of 6.1 hectares of land will be acquired affecting 13 households (65 affected people) with a \ntotal  of  6  households  (30  affected  people)  severely  affected.  A  total  of  19  households  (95 \naffected people) will be affected with loss of trees in the solid-waste management site owned by \nthe government. The total LAR cost is estimated to be $1.52 million.15  All affected households \nare  entitled  to  compensation  and  rehabilitation  assistance.  Severely  affected  and  vulnerable \nhouseholds will be provided income restoration through cash assistance and skills training, and \nreceive priority for employment in project-related construction works.  \n \n31. \nIndigenous  peoples.  Indigenous  peoples  safeguards  are  not  triggered  by  any  project \ncomponent in Kampot or Sihanoukville, and the safeguard category for indigenous peoples is C \nin accordance with the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n32. \nEnvironmental  safeguards.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  environment  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  One  initial  environmental  examination \n(IEE)  report  and  two  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs)  (one  per  town)  have  been \nprepared.  The  proposed  subprojects  are  not  expected \nirreversible  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts.  Mitigation  measures  for  identified  impacts  related  to  siting,  design, \nconstruction, and operation have been incorporated in the EMPs. In addition, potential impacts of \nclimate  change  and  natural  hazards  (e.g.,  flooding  and  earthquake)  on  the  project  are \nrecommended for integration into the design and engineering stage as part of the IEE assessment \nwhenever feasible and appropriate.16 \n \n33. \nClimate change projections and climate change impacts on the project are discussed in \nthe climate vulnerability and risk assessment section of the IEE. Costs that may be attributed to \nclimate  change  adaptation  have  been  estimated  at  $1  million  for  Cambodia,  representing  about \n2%\u20133% of the ADB loan.  \n \nF. \n \nThe integrated benefits and impacts from the project are expected to outweigh the costs. \n34. \nThe overall risk is assessed as medium.
