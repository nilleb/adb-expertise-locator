An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was \nAssessment  undertaken and the summary EIA was circulated to the Board in \nJuly 2002.  \n \nProject Description  The Project will reduce water pollution; protect water resources; \npromote  sustainable  economic  development;  and  improve  the \nenvironmental  quality,  living  conditions,  and  public  health  of \nWuhan,  the  capital  city  of  Hubei  Province.  Wuhan  has  a \npopulation  of  7.3 million,  with  an  urban  center  population  of \n3.8 million. The Project includes three infrastructure components \nto provide wastewater collection and treatment in the  areas of \nSanjintan (33 km of sewers; capacity 300,000 m3), Huangjiahu \n(48 km of sewers; capacity 100,000 m3), and Luobuzui (24 km of \nsewer; capacity 120,000 m3), in Wuhan; and a fourth capacity-\nbuilding component, including (i) project management, corporate \nmanagement,  and  related  institutional  and  wastewater \nmanagement;  (ii) expanded  environmental  monitoring; \n(iii) development of a water quality model; and (iv) establishment \nof a wastewater management training center. \n \nRationale  Wuhan is a center of industry, transportation, and communications \nwith an urban built-up area of 208 km2 out of its total area of \n8,467 km2.  It  is  strategically  located  about  halfway  along  the \nseveral  thousand kilometer  reach  of  the  Changjiang  (Yangtze \nRiver). The Changjiang basin is the largest river basin in the PRC \nand it receives the largest total wastewater volume of the seven \nmajor rivers. Though the river is often seen as having a high \nassimilative capacity, the cumulative effect of the innumerable \npoint  and  nonpoint  discharges  is  deteriorating  water  quality. \nEffects of the cumulative pollution are felt throughout downstream \nreaches and the East China Sea. The growing pollution belt along \nthe river\u2019s banks in and near cities is evidence of localized near-\nshore  pollution.  Water  quality  in  the  Wuhan  section  of  the \nChangjiang has significantly decreased over the last 15 years. In \nthe middle 1980s, water quality exceeded its designated standard. \nSince  2000,  water  quality  has  not  attained  the  standard \nthroughout the dry season and 67% of the river is below the \nstandard  throughout  the  year.  In  2000,  Wuhan\u2019s  wastewater \ndischarge totaled about 2.05 million m3/d with domestic sewerage \nand about one fourth of that was industrial wastewater. The two \nexisting wastewater treatment plants can only treat 6% of the \nwastewater generated. About 56% of the rivers and 89% of the \nlakes in Wuhan have been polluted by organic, nitrogen, and \nphosphorous  wastes.  Further  existing  septic  tanks  cannot \neffectively treat wastewater due to the high population  density, \nhydrologic  conditions,  and  soil  conditions.  This,  together  with ", "ii \nhydrologic  conditions,  and  soil  conditions.  This,  together  with \ninadequate  sewers,  results  in  sewage  overflows  and  resultant \npoor environment/sanitary conditions. The people living in Wuhan \nare  adversely  affected  by  the  lack  of  adequate  wastewater \nmanagement and water resources protection through the effect of \npoor water quality on public health, the living environment, risks to \ndrinking water supplies, and the negative influence on economic \ndevelopment. \n \n  The proposed wastewater collection and treatment systems are \nan integral part of the Wuhan Urban Wastewater Management \nMaster Plan. The goal of the master plan, which includes a total of \n13 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), five of which are in \noperation or under construction, is to bring Wuhan\u2019s wastewater \ntreatment  rate  to  approximately  70%  by  2010.  The  systems, \ntogether with the Project\u2019s capacity-building activities for corporate \ngovernance,  wastewater  management,  and  environmental \nmonitoring,  will  contribute  significantly  to  pollution  control and \nenvironmental management in Wuhan and the Changjiang basin. \nBeneficiaries  will  include  residents  of  Wuhan  and  those  living \ndownstream.  \n \nObjectives and Scope  To achieve sustainable wastewater management and protection \nof  water  resources,  the  overall  objective  of  the  WWMP  is  to \nincrease  wastewater  treatment  capacity  in  Wuhan  from  the \ncurrent  6%  (19%  after  completion  of  an  ongoing  World  Bank \nproject)  to  approximately  45%  of  generated  wastewater. \nAchievement of this objective will be key to achievement of the \nrelated objectives of the WWMP to (i) improve water quality of \nrivers and lakes in Wuhan; (ii) protect drinking water resources; \n(iii) strengthening  the  capacity  and  efficiency  of  the  Wuhan \nMunicipal  Wastewater  Company  (WMWC);  (iv) improve  health \nand living standards of residents in Wuhan; and (v) improve water \nquality in downstream reaches of the Changjiang. Specifically, the \nproposed  WWMP  includes  construction  of  three  WWTPs  and \nassociated collection systems as well as develop institutional and \nmanagement  capacity  in  the  following  areas:  (i) project \nmanagement,  (ii) financial  management,  (iii) business planning, \n(iv) environmental  monitoring,  (v) water  quality,  (vi) operator \ntraining,  and  (vii) public  awareness  programs.  The  linkage \nbetween the goals, objectives, outputs, and inputs for the Project \nare given in the project framework. \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  project  cost  is  $193.6 million equivalent, including a \nforeign exchange cost of $86.8 million (45%) and a local currency \ncost of $106.8 million (55%) \n   ", "  iii \nFinancing Plan  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will fund 96% of the foreign \nexchange  cost,  with  $83.0 million  (43%  of  total  project  cost). \nCounterpart funds will be provided by WMWC through wastewater \ntariff  revenue  of  $86.8 million  (45%)  and  local  bank  loans  of \n$23.8 million (12%).  \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $83.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will \nbe provided under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility. The loan \nwill have a 25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, an \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a \nfront-end fee of 1.0%, and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft Loan Agreement. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The loan proceeds will be re-lent by the central Government to the \nTerms  Hubei provincial government (HPG); HPG will onlend the loan \nproceeds  to  the  Wuhan  municipal  government  (WMG)  on  the \nsame terms and conditions as the ADB loan. WMG will onlend the \nloan proceeds to WMWC. All onlending agreements be on the \nsame terms and conditions as the ADB loan. WMWC will assume \nthe foreign exchange and interest rate variation risks for the loan \nand  reimburse  HPG  and  WMG  for  any  intermediation  and \ntransaction costs. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2008 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2008 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  WMG, with the Wuhan project management office (WPMO) under \nArrangements  the guidance of the project leading group that is headed by the \nvice  mayor  and  includes  key  provincial  and  municipal \nrepresentatives  of  Wuhan  water  environmental,  planning,  and \nfinance  agencies,  will  serve  as  the  secretariat  responsible  for \noverall  project  coordination.  WMWC  will  be  the  implementing \nagency. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Wuhan municipal government \n   \nProcurement  ADB-financed  equipment  and  materials  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Major \ncontracts  will  be  rendered  through  international  competitive \nbidding  or  international  shopping,  depending  on  the  contract \namount.  Civil  works  estimate  to  cost  $5 million  or  less  per \npackage will be carried out under local competitive bidding in \naccordance with the PRC\u2019s Tendering and Bidding Law. \n   ", "iv \nConsulting Services  $2.24 million  for  65  person-months of international consultants \nand  130  person-months  for  domestic  consultants.  Additional \nconsulting services, for which detailed terms of reference and \nbudget will be developed by the implementation consultancy to \ndevelop a water quality model for Wuhan wastewater and water \nresources management, will be procured. All consulting services \nwill be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants. \n \nProject Benefits and  Beneficiaries  include  residents  (1.8 million)  and  enterprises \nBeneficiaries  located  in  the  project  areas  of  Sanjintan,  Huangjiahu,  and \nLuobuzui who will be provided with a new or improved wastewater \ncollection system. All residents of Wuhan (7.4 million) will benefit \nfrom an improved living environment and reduction in risk to their \ndrinking  water  supplies  and  better  prospects  for  economic \ndevelopment and growth. Approximately 24% of the service area \nbeneficiaries fall below ADB\u2019s established poverty lines. As an \nenvironmental project, the benefits will accrue to the population \nsubgroup approximately proportionally to their ratio to the entire \npopulation. This Project supports poverty reduction directly and \nindirectly  through  improved  living  conditions,  job  creation \n(permanent and temporary), reduction in risk of  job losses from \nindustry  closures,  and  promotion  of  sustainable  economic \ndevelopment in areas where the poor are particularly likely to \ngain, such as tourism and agriculture. Due to higher vulnerability \nto poor environmental conditions, the poor will particularly benefit \nfrom improvements in living conditions and environmental quality. \n \n  Urban  and  rural  residents  in  downstream  reaches  of  the \nChangjiang  will  benefit  from  improved  river  water  quality,  a \nreduction  in  pollution  with  associated  public  health,  amenity, \ntourism, and recreational benefits. The number of downstream \nbeneficiaries  exceeds  30 million,  including  the  over  20 million \nresidents of Shanghai. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Project management risk will be mitigated by the existence of the \nproject leading group within WMG and the coordination to be \nprovided by WPMO, which is experienced in overseeing large \ninternationally funded projects. Financial risks include (i) failure to \nincrease  tariffs  on  time  and  to  the  required  amount, \n(ii) nonpayment of  wastewater charges, (iii) significant errors in \nestimates  of  water  sales,  (iv) lack  of  WMWC  autonomy,  and \n(v) failure of WMWC to secure local loans. These risks affect \nproject construction since tariff revenues and loans will provide \nthe counterpart funding, as well as long-term financial viability of \nthe Project on the implementing agency. These risks have been \nmitigated through (i) WMG guarantee to provide counterpart funds \nif WMWC cannot do this; (ii) assurances and requirements for \nloan  effectiveness,  including  tariff  increases  and  financial \nautonomy; and (iii) rigorous and conservative estimates of water \nsales and conservative financial planning. ", "  v\n  The  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual  technical  and \nenvironmental risks. This conclusion has been reached on the \nbasis of (i) thorough investigation, which minimizes the risk of \nunforeseen  construction  conditions;  (ii) thorough  review  of \ndesigns; (iii) consideration of operation and maintenance issues; \n(iv) consideration  strategic  master  plan;  and  (v) inclusion  of \nenvironmental analysis as an integral part of project design. The \nsewers and WWTPs included in the Project will use standard \ntechnology  common  throughout  the  PRC  that  conforms  to \ninternational  standards.  Specific  construction  and  other \nimplementation risks will be mitigated by the use of experienced \ndomestic  and  international  consultants  to  give  implementation \nadvice and support.  \n \nResettlement  risks  are  minimal  and  have  been  mitigated  by \n(i) early consultation; (ii) early integration of resettlement planning \ninto project design; and (iii) full disclosure of resettlement planning \ndocuments  including  distributing  the  resettlement  information \nbooklet  to  village  offices  in  May  2002,  placement  of  the \nresettlement plan in village offices after approval, and posting of \nthe resettlement plan on ADB\u2019s web site, after domestic project \napproval.  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Wuhan Wastewater Management Project \n(WWMP). \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.    The PRC has made significant economic progress over the last 20 years. Real economic \ngrowth has averaged about 8% in this period and gross domestic product exceeded $1 trillion in \n2000.  The  urban  population  has  also  grown  rapidly:  from  190 million  in  1980  to  almost \n456 million in 2000, representing 36% of the total PRC population. Rapid economic growth and \ncontinuing urbanization (forecast to be 50% of the total population by 2030) are putting pressure \non overloaded urban infrastructure and are causing a rapid increase in the demand for urban \nservices and in environmental threats from pollution. The need for urban services is outgrowing \nthe physical and financial capacity of most cities to provide adequate urban infrastructure. \n \n3.    In 1999, total wastewater generated was 30.1 billion cubic meters (m3) per year. Total \nwastewater is increasing: growth in domestic1 wastewater generation (about 65% of the total) is \noutweighing the reductions achieved in industrial wastewater (about 35% of the total), as \nenterprises  improve  their  wastewater  management  practices.  Municipal  wastewater \nmanagement is still in an early stage, with only 35% of urban wastewater treated in 2000. \nMunicipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are the key to water pollution control, since the \nindustrial treatment plants typically provide only pretreatment to a low effluent standard, prior to \ndischarge to a municipal sewer. In the absence of a municipal WWTP, a mixture of raw \ndomestic sewage and partially treated industrial wastewater is discharged from the municipal \nsewer to the nearest water body.  \n \n4.    As is the practice in industrialized countries, the PRC increasingly manages urban \nmunicipal  wastewater  with  sewerage  systems  and  treatment  plants  capable  of  treating \npretreated industrial wastewater. The practice results in large savings to municipalities and \nindustries because of economies of scale. It is particularly beneficial in the PRC as municipal \nWWTPs have suffered from poor performance as a result of weak wastewater, which results in \nlower treatment efficiency, and underutilized capacity. Risks of toxic and hazardous materials to \nWWTP  operations  and  the  environment  are  mitigated  through  regulation  of  industrial \ndischarges, to the municipal system, including effluent limitations, pretreatment, and permit \nsystems. In additional to national regulations,2 Wuhan has developed a permit system for all \nnondomestic discharges to the municipal system that will be implemented during this Project. \n \n5.    Municipal wastewater is a major contributor to pollution of the PRC\u2019s rivers and lakes, \nwith the most severe pollution impacts in the water-short northern region of the country. In \nregional and administratively higher-level cities only approximately 30% of the rivers meet their \ndesignated water quality standards compared with the objective of 60% established by the \n                                                 \n1  Residential, commercial, administration, and others. \n2  National Standards \u2013 GB8978. ", "2 \nGovernment in its 10th Five-Year Development Plan (FYP). In seven major river basins,3 52% of \nriver courses do not meet the Class III standard. For river courses in urban areas, 16% are at \nthe lowest Class V standard, and 36% are worse than the Class V standard. Eutrophication is \noccurring in 75% of major freshwater lakes.  Surface-water sources serving municipal water \nsupply systems are polluted to levels unacceptable under water quality standards.  \n \n6.    The Government has recognized that adequate environmental protection and pollution \ncontrols are essential for sustainable economic growth. As a result, the PRC has undertaken a \nhost of programs in wastewater management. Industries were ordered to treat their wastewater \nto acceptable standards by end-December 2000; municipalities have been required under \nsuccessive  FYPs  to  address  wastewater  collection,  treatment,  and  disposal;  and  pollution \ncontrol plans have been developed and partially implemented for several key water basins. The \ncurrent  FYP  directs  a  domestic  wastewater  treatment  rate  of  45%  for  regional  and \nadministratively higher-level cities and a rate of 60% for cities discharging more than 500,000 \ncubic meters per day (m3/d). National guidelines further require that major cities, such as \nprovincial capitals, have a wastewater treatment rate of 70% by 2010.4 The treatment  level \nrequired is dependent on water quality class for the receiving water. For water quality Classes I, \nII, and III, the treatment level typically expected from secondary treatment is required. \n \n7.    The Changjiang5 Valley Water Resources Protection Bureau has developed a basin-\nwide management plan, which is in the final approval stage at the national level. The draft plan \ncites the deteriorating water quality of the Changjiang. Though the river is often seen as having \na  high  assimilative  capacity,  the  cumulative  effect  of  the  innumerable  point  and  nonpoint \ndischarges is causing the water quality to deteriorate. Effects of the cumulative pollution are felt \nthroughout downstream reaches and the East China Sea. Bureau monitoring data demonstrate \na growing pollution belt in and around cities. The plan sets out a number of general pollution \ncontrol targets with specific targets to be developed by individual provinces and cities.6  \n \n8.    Wuhan\u2019s extensive water resources take up one fourth of the urban built-up area. In \n2000, wastewater discharge was about 2.05 million m3/d and about 25% of that was industrial \nwastewater. The two existing WWTPs are only able to treat 6% of the wastewater generated. \nThe large quantity of untreated wastewater discharged into rivers and lakes has caused a \nsignificant deterioration of water quality. About 56% of the rivers and 89% of the lakes have \nbeen polluted by organic, nitrogen, and phosphorus wastes. In the middle 1980s, 100% of the \nWuhan section of the Changjiang was Class II. Currently, none of the river reach attains Class \nIII during the dry season and 67% of the river reach does not attain Class III at other times. The \nFu River, recipient of Sanjintan\u2019s effluent, is designated as Class IV, but generally only achieves \nClass V; eutrophication of East Lake is increasingly serious.7 Surveys carried out during project \npreparation activities noted poor environmental conditions and showed that the majority of the \npublic believed that unsanitary disposal of sewage has affected public health. According to \nmunicipal health data, 8,463 cases of hepatitis and dysentery were reported in 2000. Wuhan is \nadversely  affected  by  the  lack  of  adequate  wastewater  management  and  drinking  water \nresources protection through the effect of poor water quality on public health, the urban living \nenvironment,  risks  to  drinking  water  supplies,  and  the  negative  influence  on  economic \ndevelopment.  \n                                                 \n3  Haihe, Huaihe, Liaohe, Changjiang (Yangtze River), Zhujiang, Songhuajiang, and Huanghe (Yellow River). \n4  Publication of Urban Wastewater Treatment and Control Technology Advice. 2000.

", "3 \n9.    The State Council, in its approval notice of the Wuhan Urban Master Plan, indicated that \nurban wastewater treatment facilities need to be constructed to control wastewater discharges \ninto rivers and lakes. In line with this, the Plan\u2019s water quality target is Class II. To meet this \ngoal, Wuhan Municipal Government (WMG) has developed a wastewater master plan, which \nincludes the construction of a total of 13 WWTPs and associated sewer systems.8 WMG has \nalso developed other environmental management improvement programs including the \u201cClean \nWater \u2013 Blue Sky Action Plan\u201d and \u201cSustainable Wuhan\u201d plan (developed with United Nations \nEnvironment Programme assistance). Also, WMG has drafted an overall policy for improved \nwastewater management including business management.9 \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n10.   The  current  status  of  wastewater  management  in  the  PRC  provides  numerous \nopportunities to reduce water pollution, protect water resources, promote sustainable economic \ndevelopment, and improve the living conditions and public health of urban residents, including \nthe poor. \n \n11.    The Government has recognized the need for a focus toward environmental protection \nto be implemented alongside economic growth policies to meet the vision of clean, modern, and \nsustainable cities competitive in the global market place. In the past, the Government was the \nsole provider of urban services. Wastewater management practice was based on septic tanks, \ndesignated  open  drainage  ditches,  and  no  treatment.  Services  were  funded  through  tax \nrevenue, with minimal or no charges levied on consumers. The use of septic tanks has been \nshown to be inadequate for many urban areas, including Wuhan, due to high population \ndensities and local hydrogeological conditions that do not allow for adequate treatment and \nresult in unsanitary overflows. Over the last decade, there has been a fundamental shift toward \na market-based approach, enterprise provision in the delivery of infrastructure services, and an \nintegrated  approach  to  urban  management.  PRC  policy  incorporates  the  need  for \ncomplementary reforms to support investment in physical assets. Improvements in service \ndelivery through investment in wastewater systems are matched by financial, governance, and \nenterprise reform, as well as education, awareness, and social responsibility. Although much \nprogress has been made, it is clear that the Government considers that the pace of change has \nnot been quick enough and recently stated a policy requiring wastewater companies to finance \noperations  and  investments  without  government  subsidies.10  Investment  in  wastewater \nmanagement systems is urgently needed, and social surveys demonstrate that city populations \nare  becoming  increasingly  concerned  about  the  impact  of  wastewater  pollution.  Although \nwastewater companies have been established in many cities, few are financially or managerially \nautonomous and implementation of tariff increases has been slow. \n \n12.   WMG\u2019s commitment to management and financial reforms responds to this need. This is \ndemonstrated by WMWC\u2019s responsibility for 100% of the Project\u2019s counterpart funding. \n \n13.   One of the ADB strategic objectives in its PRC operations is to improve the environment \nand  the  management  of  natural  resources.  ADB\u2019s  water  policy  calls  for  integrated  water \nresources  management,  through  the  improvement  and  expansion  of  water  services,11 \n                                                 \n8  Appendix 2 contains additional details. \n9  The draft policy, which is still in the approval process, is included in Supplementary Appendix A. \n10 Jointly issued by the State Development Planning Commission, State Environmental Protection Administration, \nand the Ministries of Construction, Finance, and Water Resources (July 2002). \n11 ADB\u2019s forthcoming TA3749-PRC: Wastewater Tariffs and Management Study will assist in forming appropriate \npolicy reform, regulation targets, and plant at a state level. ", "4 \nenvironmental  protection  (including  monitoring),  improved  governance,  strengthened \ninstitutional  capacity,  and  improved  public  awareness.  The  Project  supports  these  policy \nelements by (i) recognizing the basin-wide implications of Wuhan\u2019s wastewater management \nprograms and (ii) using an inter-disciplinary approach including financial, institutional, and social \naspects to improve water quality. \n \n14.    ADB has made more than $1 billion-worth of investment in wastewater and water supply \nprojects in the PRC.12,13 Loan projects have generally been implemented well. Lessons learned \nfrom wastewater projects throughout the region include requirements for (i) thorough review of \ntechnical designs; (ii) consideration of strategic master planning in industrial structure and \nconsumer behavior; (iii) consideration of operation and maintenance (O&M), particularly local \nexperience; (iv) addressing of implementation constraints to financial reform, particularly in \nestablishing autonomous wastewater entities and tariff increases; (v) addressing constraints to \ninstitutional strengthening, particularly  in  establishing  managerial  autonomy;  (vi) inclusion of \nmonitoring, enforcement and regulation issues; (vii) inclusion of education and training needs, \nincluding management and senior level; (viii) strong consultation and community participation, \nmore focus on education and awareness; (ix) early incorporation of resettlement issues; and \n(x) recognition of political constraints to government, economic and enterprise reform. All of \nthese relate directly to achieving strategic environmental management improvements and have \nbeen specifically considered in project design. A key lesson to be addressed with regard to ADB \nloan implementation and disbursement delays is the need to (i) reconcile differences in ADB \nand domestic processing procedures and (ii) initiate policy reforms during project processing so \nthat these can be in place in the early phases of project implementation. This has been \naddressed through careful coordination of processing schedules and regular, close consultation \nwith the Executing Agency (EA) on policy reforms, and recognition that these are key project \nreadiness indicators. \n \n15.   Technical  and  environmental  assessment  has  confirmed  the  need  for  centralized \nwastewater  treatment  and  choice  of  sites  and  treatment  technology.  Among  others,  the \ntechnical  design  considers  the  Wuhan  wastewater  master  plan,  wastewater  flows  and \nappropriate plant capacity, cost-effectiveness, sludge disposal, training, and operations.14 \n \n16.   Institutional and financial reforms are currently being implemented in Wuhan, supported \nby loan requirements under the ongoing World Bank Project.15 Specific assurances, prior to loan \neffectiveness, are included to ensure that these and further reforms, including tariff increases, \nare achieved earlier than is usually achieved under ADB loans. \n \n17.   WMG is already undertaking consultation, education, and public awareness programs on \nenvironmental protection and wastewater management. The Project includes support for these \nprograms that will assist in harnessing popular support for environmental improvements and in \nimproving willingness to pay for wastewater tariffs. Politically, there is high-level support within \n                                                 \n12 ADB has provided 48 TA studies for $3.8 million for water sector and environmental issues and 10 loans. \n13 ADB\u2019s Private Sector Department\u2019s involvement in the PRC wastewater sector is a recent focus though there has \nbeen significant involvement in the water supply sector and growing interest in the wastewater sector. The \naforementioned wastewater tariff TA and institutional and managerial reforms promoted under public sector loans \nto the wastewater sector are helping build the foundation for private sector participation. \n14 ADB. 2001.

", "5 \nWMG and Hubei provincial government (HPG) for continued reform and specific strong support \nfor the Project, including implementation of the necessary institutional and financial reforms.  \n \n18.   The Project is an integral part of the WWMP. Wuhan\u2019s strategic location along the \nChangjiang, and WMG\u2019s commitment to improved wastewater management and achievement of \ngovernment environmental policies provide an opportunity for ADB to invest in environmental \nmanagement and promote autonomous and accountable wastewater service provision. Surveys \nshow that both the poor and the nonpoor are broadly in support of environmental projects and \nconsider improvements in their living environment as a priority for improving their quality of life. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n \n19.   To achieve sustainable wastewater management and protection of water resources, the \noverall objective of the WWMP is to increase wastewater treatment capacity in Wuhan from the \ncurrent 6% (21% after completion of the ongoing World Bank project) to approximately 45% of \ngenerated wastewater. With an additional confirmed investment by the Government of Poland, \nthe rate will be 50%.16 Achievement of this objective will be key to achievement of the related \nobjectives of the Project to (i) improve water quality of rivers and lakes in Wuhan; (ii) protect \ndrinking  water  resources;  (iii) strengthen  the  capacity  and  efficiency  of  Wuhan  Municipal \nWastewater  Company  (WMWC)  in  commercial  principles;  (iv) improve  health  and  living \nstandards of residents in Wuhan; and (v) benefit the Changjiang. Specifically, the Project \nincludes construction of three WWTPs and associated sewers as well as development of \ninstitutional  and  management  capacity  in  the  following  areas:  (i) project  management, \n(ii) wastewater  company  autonomy,  (iii) financial  management,  (iv) business  planning, \n(v) environmental  monitoring,  (vi) water  quality,  (vii) operator  training,  and  (viii) public \nawareness programs. The linkage between the goals, objectives, outputs, and inputs for the \nProject are given in the project framework (Appendix 1). \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n20.   The Project has three infrastructure components, consisting of improved wastewater \ncollection and treatment systems in the Sanjintan, Huangjiahu, and Luobuzui service areas of \nWuhan. As well as technical studies and facilities to enhance O&M and long-term wastewater \nmanagement (see Supplementary Appendix G for details on the components). The outputs of \nthe Project include (i) construction of WWTPs in three service areas that would otherwise \ndischarge about 418,000 m3/d of raw or partially treated industrial and domestic wastewater to \nsurface waters in the design year 2010; (ii) provision of more than 100 kilometers (km) of \nsewers and interceptors that will improve the urban environment for 1.8 million urban residents \nin 2010; and (iii) assistance in improving the water quality to achieve standards in the receiving \nwaters for the treated effluents. \n \n                                                 \n16 WMG has initiated discussions with both international and domestic investors to utilize build-operate-transfer \n(BOT) investments for WWTP in two new economic development zones, which will bring the rate to 56%. WMG is \nalso discussing the use of World Bank loan savings to fund an additional WWTP, which would bring the treatment \nrate to 70%.  ", "6 \n1.  Component A: Wastewater Collection and Treatment in Sanjintan  \n \n21.   Component A will serve the Sanjintan area (61.4 km2) and is located on the west side of \nthe  Changjiang.  Sanjintan  is  estimated  currently  to  have  a  population  of  824,000  and  is \nprojected to have a population of 921,000 in 2010. The facilities will include 33 km of sewers \n(400-millimeter (mm) diameter to 2 meter (m) x 2.8 m box culvert), and a WWTP of 300,000 \nm3/d capacity. The proposed Sanjintan WWTP will be a primary plus secondary biological \nanaerobic plus aeration (A/O) treatment plant with adequate sludge treatment and disposal. \nSewer rehabilitation will include the dredging and bank improvements to the Huangxiao River, \nwhich has served as a combined sewer. The Wuhan section of the Fu River receives 90% of the \nwastewater of the Sanjintan area and is ranked as the second most polluted river in the Main \nUrban District of Wuhan. During the dry season, the flow from the Fu River has caused the \nshutdown of the Dijiao water treatment plant (WTP) on the Changjiang (1 km south of Fu River \nand Changjiang confluence) due to its poor water quality. \n \n2.  Component B: Wastewater Collection and Treatment in Huangjiahu \n \n22.   Serving an area of 56.5 km2, the Huangjiahu system is ol cated in the southeastern \nportion of the city and consists mainly of rural and urban districts, containing 347,000 people in \n2000 and a projected 425,000 in 2010. The facilities include 48 km of sewers (400 mm diameter \nto 1.6 m x 2.2 m box culvert), and a WWTP of 100,000 m3/d capacity. The proposed Huangjiahu \nWWTP will be a secondary biological (modified carrousel oxidation ditch) treatment plant with \nadequate sludge treatment and disposal. Wastewater is currently discharged untreated into the \nXunsi River, which is a tributary stream to the Changjiang. During the dry season, wastewater \nfrom Xunsi River causes the water quality at the intake for the Pinghu WTP to deteriorate, and \nduring wet season it pollutes South, Qingnin, and Tangxun lakes. South Lake is one of the main \ntourist areas and Tangxun Lake is a drinking water resource for neighboring residents. \n \n3.  Component C: Wastewater Collection and Treatment in Luobuzui \n \n23.   The Luobuzui service area encompasses approximately 30.1 km2 and is located on the \neast side of the Changjiang. The Luobuzui area population is expected to increase from \n401,000 in 2000 to 445,000 in 2010. The proposed facilities include 24 km of sewers, 600 mm \nto 1,600 mm in diameter, and a WWTP of 120,000 m3/d capacity. The proposed Luobuzui \nWWTP will be a secondary biological (modified carrousel oxidation ditch) treatment plant with \nadequate sludge treatment and disposal. Depending on the season, the untreated wastewater \nfrom this area either flows into Qingshan Gang and then to the Changjiang, or into East Lake. \nThere have been problems at the Gangdong WTP due to wastewater discharges. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n24.   Wuhan project management office (WPMO) has requested that a portion of the loan \nproceeds be used for the development of a water quality model for the Wuhan reach of the \nChangjiang, including its tributaries of the Changjiang in the area. This will be an important tool \nfor improving the comprehensive wastewater management strategy for the area and predicting \nchanges in water quality. A geographic information system would be included in this effort, as \nwell as development of supervisory control and data acquisition system. The terms of reference \nfor the modeling effort would be developed by the loan implementation consultants. The water \nquality model is key to integrated water resources management that is advocated by ADB\u2019s \nwater policy. \n ", "7 \n25.   To improve its water quality and wastewater characteristics monitoring, WPMO has \nrequested that a portion of the loan be used to purchase monitoring and sampling equipment. \nThis equipment will be used for monitoring wastewater discharges to the sewage collection \nsystem,  WWTP  effluents,  and  receiving  water  quality;  it  will  provide  WPMO  and  relevant \ngovernment agencies with data needed to (i) confirm design assumptions, (ii) implement a \ndischarge permit system, and (iii) provide data input for the water quality modeling work and \noperation guidelines. \n \n26.   WMWC does not currently have a centralized facility for personnel training. With loan \nconditions requiring WMWC to become operationally and financially autonomous, it will be \nimportant  that  facilities  are  available  to  provide  the  instruction  necessary  to  effectively \nimplement plant O&M. To provide for staff development and training, WPMO has requested that \nconstruction of a training center be included in the loan. WMWC will use the training center for \nmanagement, financial, and O&M training. WPMO and WMWC are developing a staff training \nprogram and its projects will be reported to ADB in regular project progress reports. \n \n27.   Sewer rehabilitation is essential for an efficient collection system and transition to a \nseparate  sewer  system.  WPMO  has  developed  a  draft  long-term  program  for  sewer \nrehabilitation. This program will be finalized during final design and certain components will be \nimplemented  under  the  Project.  Sewer  rehabilitation  will  involve  (i) conversion  of  some \ncombined sewers to separate sewers; (ii) repair/replacement of sewers in poor condition; and \n(iii) limited dredging of two open channels that had served as combined sewers and where the \nProject  will  include  interception  of  much  of  sewage  that  had  entered  the  channels.  The \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) addressed these sewer rehabilitation activities. \n \n28.   To increase support for wastewater management improvements and associated tariff \nincreases, the project includes a comprehensive community awareness program. The program \nwill enhance the public\u2019s awareness of environmental and wastewater problems. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n29.   The Project cost estimate is $193.6 million, comprising $86.8 million foreign exchange \ncost (45%) and $106.8 million local currency cost (55%). The interest rate used to calculate the \ninterest during construction on the ADB loan was 3.95%, which is based on the current US$ 5-\nyear swap rate plus ADB\u2019s fixed spread of 0.6%. Interest during construction for local loans was \nalso included.17 A summary of the cost estimates is given in Table 1. Detailed cost estimates \nare included in Appendix 4.  \n \n                                                 \n17 Local bank loans are assumed to have a 5-year term and an interest rate of 5.3%, based on current available \nterms.

These have not been included in the government estimates. \nc  Interest during construction, commitment fee, and front-end fee. \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n \n30.   The Government has requested a loan of $83.0 million, about 43% of the total project \ncost, to finance 96% of the foreign exchange cost of the Project, including financing charges. \nThe loan will be from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources at ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based variable lending \nrate for loans, with a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum and a front-end fee of 1.0%. \nInterest during construction, the commitment fee, and the front-end fee will be capitalized under \nthe loan. The loan will have a maturity of 25 years, which includes a grace period of 5 years.  \n \n31.   The Government provided ADB with the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, indicating that the \ncurrency of borrowing would be the US dollar and noting that these choices were its own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n32.   The Borrower will be the PRC, which will relend the funds to HPG. HPG will onlend to \nWMG, which will onlend to WMWC. All relending will be on the same terms and conditions as \nthe ADB loan. WMWC will assume the foreign exchange and interest rate variation risks for \nADB\u2019s  loan  and  reimburse  HPG  and  WMG  for  any  intermediation  and  transaction  costs. ", "9 \n33.  Counterpart funding will provide about 57% of the total project cost and be used to finance \n100% of the local currency cost and the escalation contingency for the foreign exchange cost. \nCounterpart funding will be provided by WMWC through tariff revenues and PRC bank loans. \nWMWC is responsible for 100% of the counterpart funding which will assist in the progression \ntoward financial autonomy of the company, in line with PRC and ADB policy. In support of the \nProject, HPG and WMG have also provided guarantees to provide counterpart funds, in the event \nthat WMWC cannot provide the necessary contribution. This guarantee, included in the assurances, \nmitigates the financing risk and ensures that counterpart funding will be available for the Project, \nwhile promoting commercial principles in wastewater management. An analysis of the affordability of \ncounterpart funds is included in Appendix 7. \n \n34.   The financing plan for the Project is summarized in Table 2 and detailed in Appendix 7.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n  Foreign  Local   Total  Total \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Cost  Percentage \n         \nAsian Development Bank Loan  83.0  0.0  83.0  43 \nCommercial Cofinancing         \n    Commercial & Industrial Bank of China  0.0  23.8  23.8  12 \n         \nCounterpart Funds         \n    Wuhan Municipal Wastewater Companya  3.8  83.0  86.8  45 \n         \nTotal Cost to be Financed  86.8  106.8  193.6  100 \na   Foreign exchange costs represent the escalation allowance on foreign exchange that WMWC is not required to finance \nuntil such time as it may be required. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n35.   WMG will be EA. A project leading group (PLG), chaired by a vice mayor of WMG, has been \nformed to provide overall guidance and support to the Project. WPMO has been established to be \nthe secretariat to the PLG. The staffing and organization of the PLG includes representatives from \nWuhan  Municipal  Water  Authority,  Provincial  Finance  Bureau,  Wuhan  Municipal  Planning \nCommission, Wuhan Municipal Finance Bureau, Wuhan Municipal Price Bureau, Wuhan Municipal \nEnvironmental Protection Bureau, and related agencies. The deputy director or other officials of the \nsame level of Wuhan Municipal Water Authority will be the director of WPMO. WPMO will have full-\ntime qualified staff. WPMO will be in charge of overall project coordination.  \n \n36.   The designated  project  implementing  agency  will  be  WMWC.  It  will  set  up  a  project \nimplementation unit, headed by the general manager, to coordinate with WPMO and facilitate timely \nimplementation  of  project  activities.  WMWC  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  implementation \nactivities. The organization of WMWC is shown in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n \n37.   During project implementation, WMWC will be supported by experienced domestic and \ninternational consultants. WMWC will retain the services of design institutes, specialist procurement \nagencies, and construction supervision companies to assist in implementation activities. WMWC will \nhave a number of their staff trained in project management and relevant ADB procedures. Outline \nterms of reference for the loan consultancy service are given in Appendix 13. \n ", "10 \n2.  Implementation Period \n38.   The Project will be implemented over a period of 5 years from June 2003 to June 2008 \n(Appendix 5). This schedule is considered realistic because the project implementation structure is \nalready in place, and  preparatory works are under way. ADB\u2019s successful experience in similar \nprojects in the PRC and WPG\u2019s in-depth knowledge and experience in wastewater pollution control \nand wastewater collection and treatment projects using international financing indicate  that this \nschedule is realistic and achievable. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n39.   ADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. Major contracts for civil works and supply of equipment will be undertaken through \nADB\u2019s  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures,  and  equipment  packages  valued  at \n$500,000 or less will be procured following ADB\u2019s procedures for international shopping (IS). Civil \nworks estimated to cost $5 million or less per package will be carried out under local competitive \nbidding (LCB) procedures acceptable to ADB, and in accordance with the PRC\u2019s Tendering and \nBidding Law and procurement regulations.18 For LCB packages, local contractors have the expertise \nand capacity to undertake such works. Since such civil works will involve mainly labor costs, \ninternational contractors are unlikely to be interested in the works and the use of LCB is considered \nacceptable. In accordance with ADB requirements, foreign contractors may participate in the bidding \nfor LCB contracts. Prequalification, selection, and engagement of contractors will be subject to the \napproval of ADB.19 As soon as the bids received have been evaluated, the proposal for award of \ncontracts will be submitted to ADB for approval. For this purpose, ADB will be furnished with three \ncopies of (i) an account of the public opening of bids; (ii) summary evaluation of bids; (iii) the \nproposal for award; and (iv) a draft contract or letter of acceptance. Promptly after such award, ADB \nwill be furnished with three copies of the contract as executed. Indicative procurement packages are \nprovided in Appendix 6. The mode of procurement will be decided by WMG in consultation with \nADB. The internationally tendered equipment packages will include the technical support necessary \nfor ensuring proper installation, testing, commissioning, and training of operational staff as part of \nthe related contracts. This approach assures quality control in equipment installation and operator \ntraining, utilizing the manufacturers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 technical experts who are most knowledgeable \nabout the equipment. \n \n40.   WMG has requested ADB to approve advance action to initiate the early start of preparatory \nworks  so  that  mandated  treatment  rate  goals  can  be  achieved  as  soon  as  possible.20 The \npreparatory works include (i) prequalification of contractors, tendering, and bid evaluation for civil \nworks contract packages; (ii) preparation of tender documents for the procurement of materials, \nplant, equipment, and vehicles; and (iii) recruitment of international consultants for construction \nsupervision, project implementation, and training.21 WMG, WPMO, and WMWC were advised that \nissuance of invitations to bid or to prequalify under advance procurement action will be subject to \napproval by ADB. All advance procurement actions will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement, and advance recruitment of consultants will be carried out in conformity \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The Government, WMG, WPMO, and WMWC \nwere advised that approval of advance action does not commit ADB to approve or to finance \nprocurement and recruitment costs or to finance the Project. \n                                                 \n18 ADB assisted in the establishment of national procurement regulations for the public sector under TA 2845-PRC: \nEstablishment of National Procurement Regulation for the Public Sector, for $565,000, approved on 20 August 1997, \nincluding the drafting of six regulations and three sample bidding documents.   \n19 ADB will encourage the EA to use ADB-approved standard bidding documents (to be developed as necessary) to \nensure high quality and consistency of the documents, which will hasten ADB\u2019s review. \n20 Approval of advance action was published in ADB Business Opportunities on 2 October 2002. \n21 Recruitment up to but not including sending of invitation letters to short-listed firms. ", "11 \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n41.   The staff of WMWC need to strengthen their expertise, or make arrangements with other \nspecialized agencies and private companies, with respect to (i) project management, (ii) efficient \noperating procedures; (iii) preventive maintenance; (iv) financial management; (v) social impact and \nenvironmental  monitoring;  (vi) business  planning  and  management  information  system  (MIS) \ndevelopment; (vi) human resources development; and (vii) corporate governance. Capacity building \nfor WMWC will be achieved through consultant inputs, hands-on training on project facilities, training \nin the PRC, and international training financed from the loan. \n \n42.   Provision has been made for 65 person-months of international and 130 person-months of \ndomestic consulting services to support WPMO and WMWC in project implementation and capacity \nbuilding to be funded under the loan. These consultants, recruited as a firm, will provide assistance \nto WPMO in the areas of ADB procedures and reporting, design review, procurement, quality \ncontrol, construction supervision, start-up testing, commissioning, O&M, and implementation of the \nproject performance monitoring management system (PPMS). The consulting firm will also provide \nadvice, guidance, and training for capacity building necessary to strengthen WMWC in the relevant \nareas. Outline terms of reference for the consulting services are in Appendix 13. In addition to \ntraining provided directly by the consulting firm, WMWC will use loan funds to finance broader \ntraining-related  activities.  WPMO  will  submit  detailed  training  programs  and  budgets  for  ADB \napproval  prior  to  proceeding  with  such  training  activities  and  will  subsequently  report  the \neffectiveness of this training.  \n \n43.   The  Project  also  includes  a  provision  of  additional  consulting  services,  which  will  be \nseparately  contracted  and  engaged  as  a  firm,  to  develop  a  water  quality  model  for  Wuhan \nwastewater and water resources management. The terms of reference for these services will be \ndeveloped by the project implementation consultancy and submitted to ADB for approval prior to \nproceeding with consultant recruitment. \n \n44.   Recruitment of both of the above consultant services teams will be undertaken in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants using the quality and cost-based selection method, \nand other arrangements satisfactory to the ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. The \nfirms will be required to submit a full technical proposal. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n45.   An imprest account will be established by HPG immediately after loan effectiveness in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement Handbook (January 2001). Disbursements from the \nimprest  account  will  be  supported  by  an  appropriate  withdrawal  application  and  related \ndocumentation. Such documentation will demonstrate, among other things, that the goods and/or \nservices were (i) produced in and procured from ADB's members and are (ii) eligible  for  ADB \nfinancing. The initial amount to be deposited in the imprest account will not exceed $500,000. The \nstatement of expenditures procedure may be used for reimbursement of eligible expenditures; any \nindividual contract to be reimbursed or liquidated under the procedure will not exceed $200,000.22  \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n46.   HPG,  WMG,  and  WMWC  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  Project.  WMWC  will \nmaintain records of all project expenditures and forward these regularly to HPG, WMG, and WPMO  \nwill  prepare  consolidated  project  accounts.  The  consolidated  project  accounts  will  be  audited \n                                                 \n22 Limits for the imprest account and statement of expenditures are in accordance with a recent review (unpublished and \nundated)of ADB\u2019s PRC portfolio and are intended to facilitate improved efficiency in loan disbursement. ", "12 \nannually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. Certified copies of such audited accounts in \nEnglish will be submitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the end of the financial year to which \nthey relate. As the ADB loan will be onlent to HPG and further onlent to WMG and WMWC, an \nexternally audited financial statement of WMWC will also be submitted to ADB annually, no later \nthan 6 months after the end of the relevant financial year, for the entire implementation period plus 3 \nyears after completion of the Project.23 HPG, WMG, WPMO and WMWC were informed about ADB's \npolicy on submission of audited financial statements and possible penalties for delays in submission. \nThe submitted audited project accounts and financial statements must be of acceptable quality; i.e., \nfinancial statements with adverse opinions or disclaimers of opinion from auditors are not acceptable \nand  cannot  be  submitted  for  this  purpose.  Independent  review  and  scrutiny  of  project \nimplementation will be undertaken for (i) environmental monitoring and adherence to EIA provisions; \n(ii) compliance with the resettlement plan (RP); and (iii) audit of project accounts and compliance \nwith loan covenants. \n \n47.   WPMO will submit to ADB reports and information concerning the use of the loan proceeds, \nproject implementation, and WMWC performance. The reports will include (i) quarterly progress \nreports on project implementation; (ii) annual reports; and (iii) a project completion report, no later \nthan 3 months after completion of the project facilities. Progress reports will emphasize progress \nmade  in  the  areas  of  policy  dialogue,  including  (i) wastewater  tariff  changes  and  financial \nmanagement, (ii) environmental and water quality monitoring, (iii) resettlement, and (iv) capacity \nbuilding and financial management of WMWC. \n \n7.  Project Performance Management System (PPMS) \n48.   The PPMS indicators that have been agreed during project preparation include service \nlevels, treated wastewater quality and other measures of operational performance, percentages of \nwastewater  collected  and  treated,  user  satisfaction  with  the  urban  environment,  and  relevant \neconomic data to monitor project impacts. The relevance and practicability of data collection for the \nproposed measures have been confirmed with WMWC. At the beginning of the Project, WPMO and \nWMWC,  with  the  assistance  of  consultants,  will  develop  comprehensive  PPMS  procedures  to \nsystematically generate data on inputs and outputs of the three project components and the agreed \nsocioeconomic and environmental indicators to be used to measure project impacts. WPMO and \nWMWC will refine the PPMS framework, confirm achievable goals, firm up monitoring and recording \narrangements,  and  establish  systems  and  procedures  no  later  than  6  months  after  loan \neffectiveness. \n \n49.   Under the PPMS framework, baseline and progress data will be reported at the requisite time \nintervals by WMWC. WMWC will be responsible for analyzing and consolidating the data through its \nMIS. The PPMS will be designed to permit adequate flexibility to adopt remedial action regarding \nproject design, schedules, activities, and development impacts. WPMO, with the assistance of the \nconsultants,  will  monitor  and  assess  activities,  and  report  to  ADB  quarterly  on  the  physical \nimplementation and financial aspects of the Project as well as resettlement and environmental \naspects  to  ensure  that  progress  and  impacts  are  monitored  and  reported  in  line  with  ADB \nrequirements. \n \n8.  Project Review \n50.   Regular ADB review missions are envisaged, and a mid-term review will also be undertaken \nby ADB and the Government, 2 years after project implementation begins. This review will include a \ndetailed evaluation of  the  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  resettlement,  achievement  of \nscheduled targets, and progress on the agenda for policy reform and capacity-building measures. A \n                                                 \n23 WMWC currently has three tiers of audit: internal, WMG, and external. ", "13 \ndetailed review of the wastewater tariffs of WMWC will also be undertaken. Feedback from  the \nPPMS activities will be analyzed. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \n51.   To achieve national wastewater treatment targets, WMG plans to complete construction of \nnine new WWTPs24 and expand one plant to increase capacity from the present 0.38 million m3/d to \n1.4 million m3/d by 2010. The Project involves construction of three of these new WWTPs and their \nassociated sewers and pumping stations. The total capacity of the three plants is 520,000 m3/d to \nserve a population of 1.8 million by 2010. These project components will collect, transport, and treat \nwastewater for their catchment areas and will provide secondary treatment for effluent to reach \nrelated national standards. Assuming a construction period of 5 years, the Project, together with the \ncompletion of ongoing and confirmed projects, will allow Wuhan to achieve treating approximately \n56% of its wastewater by 2007. This is slightly less than the nationally mandated 2010 objectives; \nhowever, additional WWTPs in the planning stages are expected to bring the treatment rate to 70%. \nMunicipal wastewater treatment is a key element in control of point-source water pollution, which is a \nfirst step toward meeting water quality standards. \n \n52.   Wastewater interception, treatment, and disposal provide the best long-term prospect for \nreducing waterborne pollution and improving water quality conditions in the rivers and lakes within \nand  downstream  of  Wuhan.  The  WWTPs,  which  will  use  the  same  treatment  processes  as \nsuccessfully used in other treatment plants, will be cost effective and reliable, and will have sufficient \nland area to accommodate plant expansion through 2020. Sewer capacities to be installed will \naccommodate growth in wastewater flows to 2020, thus guarding against the risk of overflows of \nsewage within the urban service area and allowing any unanticipated flows in excess of the initially \ninstalled biological treatment capacity to receive preliminary treatment in the head works of the \nWWTP. Thus, the risk from underestimation of the flows expected in the early years of operation can \nbe accommodated by technical features to be incorporated in the WWTPs. The risks of low-strength \nwastewater causing operational problems has been addressed through the inclusion of primary \ntreatment and other technical features incorporated into the design.  \n \n53.   The Project directly benefits the 1.8 million residents and enterprises located in the project \narea. It indirectly benefits the entire city of Wuhan, which is the capital of Hubei Province and a \ncenter  for  industry,  transport,  and  communications.  Residents  of  Wuhan  will  benefit  from  an \nimproved living environment and reduction in risk to drinking water supplies and better prospects for \neconomic  development  and  growth.  Urban  and  rural  residents  in  downstream  reaches  of  the \nChangjiang will benefit from improvement in water quality and associated public health, amenity, \ntourism, and recreational benefits. The number of downstream beneficiaries exceed 30 million, \nincluding the 20 million residents of Shanghai. \n \nA.  Policy Reforms \n \n54.   The  Project  supports  and  strengthens  several  ADB  policy  initiatives:  (i) comprehensive \npollution  prevention  and  control;  (ii) improved wastewater management to create a sustainable \nurban environment; (iii) enterprise reform and corporate governance; (iv) cost recovery and tariff \nreform; and (v) private sector participation. The institutional strengthening and training component of \nthe  Project  will  enhance  enterprise  reform  and  corporate  governance  through  institutional \ndevelopment,  financial  management  improvement,  industrial  pollution  control,  and  construction \nsupervision and training.  \n \n                                                 \n24 Three of the nine planned WWTPs are already under construction through World Bank financing. ", "14 \nB.  Institutional Strengthening \n \n55.   Consultant  advisory  services  will  be  provided  to  develop  WMWC  to  (i) be a properly \nconstituted enterprise company, established under the provisions of PRC law and managerially and \nfinancially autonomous; (ii) act as the implementing agency, working and liaising closely with the \nvarious departments and agencies of local government; (iii) assume management responsibility for \nfuture O&M of project facilities, including responsibility for debt servicing and the repayment of loan \nprincipal; and (iv) assume ownership of all municipal wastewater assets including all permanent \nworks constructed under the Project. The proposed corporate structure of WMWC is given in \nSupplementary Appendix C.  \n \n56.   Potential risks to developing a strong WMWC include (i) the failure of HPG, WMG, and \nWMWC to implement institutional reforms; (ii) the failure of WMG and WMWC to generate adequate \npublic support to increase wastewater tariffs to meet cost recovery targets; and (iii) the failure of \nWuhan Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau to enforce industrial pollution control regulations \nand plans, thus affecting the ability of WMWC to meet treatment standards. These risks have been \nmitigated by (i) assurances from WMG on the financial and managerial autonomy of WMWC; (ii) the \ndiversity and frequency of public participation conducted to date and that WMG is committed to \ncontinue, in combination with regular tariff reviews and the oversight of Wuhan Price Bureau; and \n(iii) relevant  ongoing  experience  of  WPMO,  including  the  World  Bank  project  in  Wuhan,  the \npreparation of a city-wide environmental improvement plan, which incorporates a \u201cClean Water \u2013 \nBlue Sky\u201d and a \u201cSustainable Wuhan\u201d plan, the latter of which was developed with the assistance of \nthe United Nations Environment Programme.  \n \nC.  Social Dimensions \n \n1.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n57.   The construction of the Project will require the permanent acquisition of 52 hectares (ha) of \nland and the temporary acquisition of 112 ha. In total, 500 households and 1,919 affected persons \n(APs) will be disturbed by land acquisition and resettlement with 179 households and 666 APs \npermanently affected. The main cost item for resettlement is land compensation. The total cost for \nboth  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  estimated  to  be  CNY244 million  or  $29.3 million. \nResettlement impacts have been identified and a RP prepared in accordance with PRC Land Law \nand the ADB \u201cHandbook on Resettlement. The RP provides a socioeconomic profile of APs and \naddresses  issues  related  to  entitlements  of  APs\u2019  grievance  procedures,  legal  framework, \nenvironmental protection, and implementation milestones (Appendix 12). Resettlement requirements \nhave been carefully considered and incorporated into project design. WMG has confirmed its \nsupport for the RP, including making up any financing shortfalls of the implementing agency, \nWMWC. Given the relatively small number of permanent APs, good experience in other projects, \nand the strong commitment of local authorities to the safeguard policies, it is unlikely that any \nsignificant problems will be encountered. \n \n58.   WMG  and  WMWC  have  implemented  ADB\u2019s  full  disclosure  policy  for  the  resettlement \nactivities, including (i) summary resettlement plan (SRP) attachment to the summary EIA, which was \ncirculated to the Board in July 2002; (ii) distribution of the resettlement information booklet (RIB) to \nvillage offices, with appropriate notifications to APs that the booklet became available in June 2002; \n(iii) posting of the SRP on ADB\u2019s web site; and, (iv) posting of the full RP in village offices and on the \nADB web site upon its approval by the national Government. WPMO will establish a specific project \nresettlement  office  to  continue  public  information  activities  and  respond  to  any  questions  or \ngrievances. \n ", "15 \n2.  Poverty Reduction \n \n59.   The Project has significant poverty reduction impacts. It provides direct benefits to living \nconditions, health, and job creation, and indirect benefits to income poverty that accrue from \nreduced health cure costs, increased productivity, and economic development. The Project directly \nand indirectly contributes to poverty alleviation. Poverty considerations are an integral part of project \ndesign. The poor, representing 24% of the service area population, make up a significant portion of \nthe population served. Based on ADB\u2019s established poverty line for the PRC, the proportion of poor \nin the project service area is higher than Wuhan as a whole, which has a city-wide ratio of 4.2%.25 \nThere will be a far wider impact than this since beneficiaries also include residents downstream of \nthe WWTPs who will also benefit from improved water quality for many uses including drinking \nwater, irrigation of food crops, fishing, and recreation. \n \n60.   As an environmental project, the living conditions for all in the service area of the Project will \nimprove. Thus, since the service area includes 24% poor, and by definition the project benefits \naccrue proportionally, about 24% of the benefits will accrue to the poor.26 \n \n61.   The Project will directly benefit poverty reduction through the provision of 7,750 person-years \nof construction jobs for skilled and unskilled laborers. WPMO has prioritized approximately 45% of \nthese jobs for the poor, which will result in approximately CNY19.9 million salary accrual to the poor. \nDuring operations 77 full-time permanent jobs for the poor with an estimated CNY4.5 million/year in \nsalaries will be generated. Project related services, such as procurement of construction materials \nand  equipment  is  expected  to  provide  an  additional  840  person-year employment, valued at \nCNY16.0 million and with targeted training and microcredit programs the poor and women could \nreap up to 50% of these wages. Those temporarily employed in construction operations will benefit \nfrom  additional  training  and  experience  that  will  provide  them  with  greater  opportunities  in \nconstruction of planned infrastructure development activities. By preventing the closure of industries \nthat would not be able to afford the treatment requirements to river than lakes rather than the less \nsevere pretreatment charges for discharge to municipal wastewater systems, the Project assists in \nthe prevention of job losses. \n \n62.   Existing Wuhan social protection programs ensure that the poor will be enabled to have \naccess to wastewater systems and continued service. Subsidies to the poor include no charge for \nconnection and up to CNY5 per month for the service tariff. Loan assurances require that these \nsubsidies  be  maintained  throughout  project  implementation.  In  addition,  under  the  RP  special \nprovisions have been made for the most vulnerable group through a CNY100,000 special fund that \nwill provide additional monetary assistance to resettled persons in extreme poverty.27 \n \n63.   Improved environmental quality will promote sustainable urban development, for example \nthrough tourism. The improvement in water quality will ensure the steady development of a water-\nbased tourism industry that depends directly on good water quality. The poor and women will benefit \nespecially from the tourism activities as they make up a larger proportion of operators and vendors. \n \n                                                 \n25 The 24% figure is based on the household survey of the service area utilizing ADB\u2019s poverty line, which, at the time of \nthe project preparatory TA, was CNY3,000 for urban areas and CNY1,000 for rural areas. This survey also visually \nobserved poor living conditions at approximately the same ratio; however, these observations have not been quantified. \nCity-wide statistics data apply to districts that are not geographically consistent with the project service area, thus \nmaking it impossible to obtain an accurate poverty ratio from city data. Using the PRC\u2019s poverty line, or Minimum Living \nStandard Scheme, city statistics indicate a poverty ratio of 4.2% for the entire city. Observations during project \npreparation indicate that the household survey data best indicate the poverty situation. \n26 Since the economic analysis primarily used property values as a proxy for improved living conditions, it is reasonably \nassumed that the poor have similar tenancy rights. \n27 The special fund is financed by a project resettlement budget. ", "16 \nD.  Financial Aspects \n \n64.   Institutional reform to improve the financial autonomy of WMWC through direct receipt of \nwastewater tariffs is required prior to loan effectiveness. Tariff increases are required both for the \nlong-term viability of WMWC and to provide counterpart funding for the Project. Incorporating the \nother ongoing investment commitments of WMWC, tariff increases are required prior to the end of \n2002 and again in 2005. Based on tariff increases from CNY0.4/m3 (current) to CNY0.75/m3 (2002) \nand CNY0.91/m3 (2005), local loans of $8.4 million are also required to fund the financing cash \nshortfall in the first 2 years. These tariffs represent realistic increases,28 and an analysis of WMWC \nshows that the local loans are affordable. \n \n65.   The financial rate of return (FIRR) is estimated at 10.4%, which compares favorably with the \nweighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 4.6%. The FIRR exceeded the WACC under sensitivity \ntests and the 6-month dollar LIBOR rate would have to double to affect the WACC. \n \n66.   An affordability analysis has been undertaken based on city-wide official income data and \nincome data from the project preparatory TA household survey. For all levels of income, the \ncombined water and wastewater tariff was less than 5% and is thus affordable. In addition, WMG \nCivil Affairs Bureau operates a social support program for the very poorest households, which \nincludes assistance in paying utility charges, including water and wastewater. \n \n67.   HPG and WMG have agreed to provide counterpart funds in the event that WMWC cannot \nmeet the financing requirements under the Project. HPG and WMG have also agreed to support \nproposals for tariff increases, provided they satisfy PRC procedures for utility price increase. WMG \nhas also agreed to minimum levels of financial performance for WMWC, which will be included as \nloan covenants and include capital structure (debt to equity), debt service cover, and liquidity. In \naddition, WMWC has agreed to undertake annual tariff reviews to mitigate the risk of poor financial \nperformance or unexpected changes in operating income. \n \nE.  Economic Aspects \n \n68.   In accordance with PRC and ADB policy for sustainable economic growth, the Project \nprovides  necessary  infrastructure  for  environmental  protection  and  economic  development  in \nWuhan. Central to the economic analysis is the fact that the many of the benefits of wastewater \nmanagement projects in large cities contribute  to wider economic and environmental objectives, \nwhich in this case will be jointly achieved through the Project and other investment projects and \nprograms.  \n \n69.   The economic analysis therefore provides an in-depth economic rationale for the Project, \nbased on policy, sector, and local area analysis. First, the rationale assesses the institutional \nframework for environmental protection, which is currently set through legal standards and targets, \npolicies, regulations, and plans. Second, the rationale examines the Project\u2019s role as a component of \nan overall master plan for achieving economic and environmental objectives, in the PRC, the \nChangjiang river basin, Hubei Province, and Wuhan. It establishes in qualitative terms that the \nProject is a cost-effective approach for achieving those objectives and is the least-cost option for \nwastewater  treatment.  The  strength  of  the  economic  rationale  and  choice  of  cost-effective \ninvestment is sufficient to establish the economic viability of the Project. \n \n                                                 \n28 Wuhan Municipal Water Authority, Wuhan Municipal Finance Bureau, and WPMO consider that the proposed tariff \nincrease would be acceptable and implementable, provided that it was justified in the usual PRC hearing procedure for \ntariff increases. ", "17 \n70.   Despite the general difficulties associated with attributing benefits to wastewater projects, the \neconomic analysis includes a project economic evaluation. The evaluation uses the domestic price \nnumeraire and assumes an economic opportunity cost of capital of 12%. Valued economic benefits \nincluded (i) the environmental and public health improvements resulting from improvements to the \ncollection system, using property value increases as a proxy value; and (ii) resource cost savings to \nindustries. There are significant economic benefits that were not valued such that the calculated \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) is a lower-bound estimation of the true EIRR. Benefits that \nwere considered qualitatively were (i) the economic growth impacts of new city development and \nimprovement  to  water  quality,  (ii) water  resources  protection,  and  (iii) downstream benefits of \nnonindustrial wastewater treatment. The EIRR was calculated at 16.4% for Sanjintan, 17.5% for \nHuangjiahu, 16.6% for Luobuzui, and 16.9% for the Project as a whole. Sensitivity tests showed that \nthe EIRR was robust, even under adverse cost and benefit scenarios. \n \nF.  Environmental Aspects \n \n71.   The Project will improve the environmental quality of Wuhan, and the living conditions and \npublic health of its citizens. Environmental improvements from the Project will provide opportunities \nfor sustainable local economic and social development, improved recreation, development of the \ntourism  industry,  and  will  promote  sustainable  urban  development.  The  Project  will  make \nappreciable contributions to the water pollution control program in Wuhan. The Project will also have \npositive impacts on the South, Tangxun, and East Lakes and the Chang, Fu, Qingling, Xunsi, and \nHuanghu rivers and Shahu Gang, and will help safeguard the water quality of water supply sources \nand downstream cities. Adverse impacts will be minimal and will be mitigated. WMG and WMWC \nhave  assured the implementation of the comprehensive monitoring and environmental management \nprograms that have been developed to ensure (i) adherence to PRC laws and ADB policies, and \n(ii) that  mitigation  measures  outlined  in  the  EIA  and  Supplementary  summary  EIA  will  be \nincorporated into design and bidding documents.  \n \n72.   The Project will serve urban areas that are without WWTPs.  Without the  Project, water \nquality will continue to deteriorate since individual systems cannot effectively treat wastewater given \nthe population density, hydrologic conditions, and soil conditions, etc.  The biological treatment \nprocesses selected are cost-effective  for BOD, COD, SS, and phosphorus; it will contribute to \nreductions in eutrophication in Wuhan surface water as well as downstream waters. There is an \naccepted risk that the river reaches of the project area will not achieve water quality targets without \nthe completion of many other pollution control projects in Wuhan and in upstream areas. This risk \nhas been reduced to manageable levels by the strong impetus and support of  the PRC and WMG \nfor  environmental  improvement,  and  the  support  of  related  projects  by other external funding \nagencies.29  \n \n73.   Detailed environmental monitoring programs, which address monitoring of all environmental \nmedia, have been developed and will be implemented by WMWC, WPMO, and Wuhan Municipal \nPrice Bureau. The summary EIA presents completed and planned public participation activities, \nagency  responsibilities,  staffing  needs,  major  monitoring  equipment  requirements,  a  sludge \nmanagement plan, and monitoring programs. Necessary review and approvals of the EIA by Hubei \nEnvironmental Protection Bureau and State Environmental Protection Administration have been \ncompleted.30 The summary EIA was circulated to the Board on 15 July 2002. \n \n                                                 \n29 Appendix 3 lists other external assistance, including World Bank and Government of Poland funded WWTP. \n30 Full EIA approval by the State Environmental Protection Administration occurs concurrently with the Project Feasibility \nStudy approval by State Development Planning Commission. ", "18 \nG.  Overall Assessment \n \n74.   From the available evidence, it is clear that the integrated benefits and impacts of the Project \nwill outweigh the costs, and that the Project is sufficiently robust to be beneficial under the likelihood \nof various risks occurring. The Project contributes to ADB\u2019s long-term strategy and the international \ndevelopment goals. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n75.   In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and WMG have given the following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The Government, through HPG and WMG, will ensure that the counterpart financing \n(in the form of tariff revenues and cash advances) necessary for the Project is \nprovided and disbursed in a timely manner to enable completion of project activities, \nand that additional counterpart funding will be provided for any shortfall in funds or \ncost overruns.  \n \n(ii)  WMG will ensure that WMWC will (a) have appropriate financial and managerial \nautonomy  operating  as  an  integrated  wastewater  management  company  with \nresponsibility for the entire sewer network and all WWTPs serving any part of the \nurban area of Wuhan, and (b) be entitled to receive all monies collected by levying \nthe appropriate wastewater tariff.  \n \n(iii)  WMG will ensure that the Board of Directors of WMWC operates effectively and fully \ndischarges  its  supervisory  and  management  responsibilities.

WMWC  will  establish  and  maintain  financial  control  and \nmanagement arrangements compatible with the relevant ADB guidelines. \n \n(iv)  The Government, through HPG and WMG, will ensure that throughout the Project, no \nmaterial organizational changes (either financial, operational, or structural) to, nor \nmaterial asset transfers to or from, WMWC will be formally approved or implemented \nwithout the prior approval of ADB, if such changes would affect the ability of WMWC, \nWMG, or HPG to perform its obligations under the Project Agreement and onlending \nagreements. \n \n(v)  The Government, through HPG and WMG, will ensure that (a) review of wastewater \ntariffs is undertaken annually;  (b) wastewater tariffs are determined in accordance \nwith  project  financing  needs  to  achieve  and  maintain  the  financial  autonomy  of \nWMWC (full cost recovery of O&M, interest payments, depreciation, and a profit \nmargin)  for  all  operations  by  end  2007,  subject  to  compliance  with  laws  and \nregulations; (c) no entity, whether any government agency, institution, or enterprise, \nregardless of ownership, will be granted an exemption from the wastewater tariff \nestablished pursuant to the above, or granted a preferential rate, or excused for \ndelays in payments without penalties; (d) the impact of increased wastewater tariffs \non the poor is reviewed and appropriate measures are introduced to protect the basic \nliving standards of the urban poor; and (e) summaries of these reviews are furnished \nto ADB within 3 months of completion.  \n ", "19 \n(vi)  HPG and WMG will ensure that WMWC will, from the start of commercial operation of \nthe project facilities, maintain a minimum debt service ratio of 1.2:1; a maximum debt-\nequity ratio of 70:30; and a minimum current ratio of 2:1 or a quick ratio of 1:1. \n \n(vii)  WMG  and  WMWC  will  ensure  that  all  applicable  PRC  environmental  laws  and \nregulations  are  adhered  to  throughout  the  project  implementation  and  that  all \nenvironmental mitigation measures identified in the EIA and summary EIA are fully \nimplemented. WMWC will further ensure that environmental mitigation measures are \nincorporated into design and bidding documents. WMWC will monitor and record the \nimplementation of the environmental monitoring program under the guidance and \nsupervision  of  Wuhan  Municipal  Environmental  Protection  Bureau  and  Wuhan \nMunicipal Water Authority and will include monitoring information in project progress \nreports submitted to ADB. \n \n(viii)  WMG  will  ensure  that  local  regulations  for  management  of  the  local    \nwastewater/drainage systems are reviewed annually to define clear responsibilities \nbetween  agencies  involved  and  appropriate  penalties  for  non-compliance,  and \neffectiveness of such regulation is reviewed on a bi-annual basis and adequately \nmodified in accordance with applicable legal procedures. \n \n(ix)  HPG, WMG, and WMWC will ensure that (a) the RP, including land acquisition, is \nfully  carried  out  promptly  and  efficiently,  in  line  with  all  applicable  laws  and \nregulations of the Borrower, and ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement; (b) all APs, \nincluding host people who provide land to the affected persons, are provided with \nadequate  information  and  regularly  consulted  in  advance  of  signing  household \ncompensation agreements and other decisions that affect their livelihood and living \nconditions as a result of the Project.

Introduction and Scope \n1.  The sector/subsector analysis addresses water resources protection and wastewater \nmanagement, in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) generally, the Changjiang basin, and \nWuhan  municipality.  The  analysis:  (i) sets  out  PRC  government  policy  and  targets  for \nenvironmental protection; (ii) sets out the policy and programs of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) for the PRC, water resources, and wastewater management; (iii) examines the current \nsituation of water resources protection and wastewater management in the PRC and the \nChangjiang basin; and (iv) examines the current situation in Wuhan, as well as targets, plans, \nand opportunities for water resources protection and wastewater management.  \n \nB.  Sector Context  \n \n2.  Urban development and economic growth in the PRC over the last two decades have \nbeen dramatic. Real economic growth has averaged about 8% over the last 20 years and gross \ndomestic product exceeded $1 trillion in 2000. The urban population has also grown rapidly, \nfrom 190 million in 1980 to almost 456 million in 2000, representing 36% of the total PRC \npopulation. Rapid economic growth and continuing urbanization (50% of total population by \n2030) have put pressure on overloaded urban infrastructure and have caused a rapid increase \nin  the  demands  for  urban  services  and  the  environmental  threats  from  pollution.  Water \nresources protection and environmental management have become key issues in the drive for \nsustainable economic growth and improved living conditions for the population. \n \nC.  Government Policy  \n \n3.  In the past, the Government was the sole provider of urban services. Wastewater \nmanagement practice was based on septic tanks, designated open drainage ditches, and no \ntreatment. Services were funded through tax revenue, with minimum or no charges levied on \nconsumers. With a rapid economic growth and urban expansion, the Government recognized \nthe need for environmental protection to be implemented alongside economic growth policies to \nmeet the vision of clean, modern, and sustainable cities, competitive in the global market place.  \n \n4.  At the same time, there was a fundamental shift toward a market-based approach and \nenterprise provision in the delivery of  infrastructure services and an integrated approach to \nurban management. PRC policy incorporates the need for complementary reforms to support \ninvestment  in  physical  assets.  Improvements  in  service  delivery  through  investment  in \nwastewater  collection  systems  and  treatment  are  matched  by  financial,  governance,  and \nenterprise reform, as well as education for awareness and social responsibility.  \n \n5.  The 1996 Water Pollution and Prevention Law authorizes setting standards for ambient \nsurface water quality31 and uses these standards to set targets for individual water courses. The \nState Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) defines the technical standards at a \nnational level, including what standards apply to sections of rivers or other water courses of \n                                                 \n1  The PRC Environmental Quality Standards have five classes for surface water quality based on their use. Class I \nis for water resources and nationally protected bodies of water. Class II is for high-value fish production areas, \nclass A protection areas, and spawning habitats for fish. Class III is for potable water resources, class B protection \nareas, general fish protection areas, and swimming areas. Class IV is for general industrial water sources and non-\ncontact recreation areas. Class I water sources are the best in quality and Class V are the worst.      ", "  Appendix 2  27 \nstrategic significance. For other rivers and water courses, the relevant environmental protection \ndepartment at either the municipal or provincial level sets the targeted water quality class. \n \n6.  Successive five-year plans (FYPs) set out targets and requirements for achieving the \ndesignated  water  quality  classes,  calling  for  action  from  provincial,  municipal,  and  city \ngovernments  to  draw  up  specific  plans  to  address  wastewater  collection,  treatment,  and \ndisposal. Pollution control plans have also been drawn up and partially implemented for several \nkey river basins and areas, but responsibility for the preparation of wastewater management \nplans and the implementation of investment programs clearly lies at local government level. \n \n7.  Regulations are provided for effluent standards for industries prior to discharge to a \nmunicipal sewer. Industrial facilities were required to provide adequate wastewater treatment to \nmeet specific regulatory pollution limits by 31 December 2000. For municipal wastewater, the \nlevel of treatment is determined by the water quality class of the receiving water and specific \ntarget treatment rates. The Tenth FYP directed a wastewater treatment rate of 45% for regional \nand  administratively  higher-level  cities  and  rates  of  60%  for  cities  discharging  more  than \n500,000 m3/day. Ministry of Construction (MOC) guidelines  32 set more stringent targets for \nlarger cities, such that major cities, including provincial capitals, should have a treatment rate of \n70% by 2010.    \n \n8.  Several other policies, regulations, and plans also support the PRC\u2019s framework for \nwater quality management. Building regulations from the MOC (dating back to the 1980s) \nrequire  the  construction  of  septic  tanks  for  all  new  residential  and  other  nonindustrial \ndevelopments; new developments are excused from this requirement if the discharge is to a \nmunicipal sewer connected to a wastewater treatment plant. The Tenth FYP also requires \nsubstantial  progress  in  establishing  systems  of  discharge  permits,  installing  continuous \nmonitoring for larger industrial discharges, and setting discharge limits based on total pollution \nloads. \n \n9.  Clear policy direction on cost recovery and institutional reform is set out in State Circular \n1192, issued in September 1999. Wastewater management is to be undertaken by enterprise \ncompanies,  and  tariffs  for  wastewater  should  be  set  at  full  cost  recovery,  although  local \ngovernments can implement tariff increases at a rate appropriate to local circumstances.  \n \nD.  Asian Development Bank Assistance \n \n10.  The ADB Country Strategy and Program (CSP) promotes continued economic growth as \nthe primary means to reduce poverty and recognizes that in the past these achievements have \ncome at a considerable cost to the environment. Improving environmental protection is a main \nthematic priority. Wastewater treatment is one of the specific investments identified as an \noperational focus. ADB's water policy supports integrated water resources management for \nsurface water quality and an operational strategy for infrastructure, calls for market-oriented \nreforms, and directs attention to urban environmental problems. The market-oriented reforms \nemphasized in the CSP include the principle of cost recovery through user charges.  \n \n11.  ADB has made more than $1 billion-worth of investment in wastewater and water supply \nprojects in the PRC.33  Loan  projects  have  generally  been  implemented  well.  Projects  are \n                                                 \n32 Urban Wastewater Treatment and Control Technology Advice, Ministry of Construction, 2000. \n33 ADB has provided 48 technical assistance studies for $3.8 million for water sector and environmental issues and \n10 loans. ", "28  Appendix 2 \nimplemented without delays and usually involve loan savings. Successive wastewater treatment \nprojects have also sought to encourage financial and enterprise reform with limited success. \nADB\u2019s  ongoing  TA3749-PRC:  National  Guidelines  for  Urban  Wastewater  Tariffs  and \nManagement Study will assist in forming appropriate policy reform,  regulation, targets, and \nplans at the state level. \n \nE.  Wastewater Management in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n12.  Considerable progress in environmental management was made during the period of the \nNinth FYP (1995-2000). By 1999 the total discharge volume of major pollutants, including \nchemical oxygen demand (COD) and petroleum-related products declined by 15-25% compared \nto 1995 levels. Much of the progress was made in industrial pollution in line with government \npolicy to target major point source polluters first. Many polluting industries (about 5,500 state-\nowned enterprises) were closed down and others undertook investment in on-site wastewater \ntreatment, including some supported by ADB. Considerable investment has also taken place in \nmunicipal treatment plants. By 2000, there were around 400 municipal wastewater treatment \nplants (WWTPs) treating approximately 10 billion m3/day.  \n \n13.  Despite  the  gains  made,  total  wastewater  generation  continues  to  grow.  In  1999, \nwastewater generated was 30.1 billion m3 per year. Growth in domestic34 wastewater generation \n(about 65% of the total) is outweighing the reductions achieved in industrial wastewater (about \n35%).  About 35% of the total wastewater generated is treated, leaving an annual volume of \nover 20 billion m3 of wastewater untreated. In the absence of a municipal WWTP, a mixture of \nraw  domestic  sewage  and  partially-treated  industrial  wastewater  is  discharged  from  the \nmunicipal sewer to the nearest water body. Designated open wastewater ditches are still \ncommon in cities. Municipal wastewater is a major contributor to pollution of rivers and lakes, \nwith the most severe pollution impacts in the water-short northern region of the country. \n \n14.  In regional and administratively higher-level cities, only approximately 30% of the rivers \nmeet their designated water quality standards compared to the Tenth FYP objective of 60%. In \nseven major river basins,35 52% of river courses do not meet the Class III standard required for \npotable water. For river courses in urban areas, more than half are either the lowest quality \nClass V or below.  Eutrophication is occurring in 75% of major fresh water lakes. Surface-water \nsources serving municipal water supply systems are polluted to levels unacceptable under \nwater quality standards and there is deterioration of water quality in groundwater aquifers.  \n \n15.  It is clear that, at state level, the Government considers that the progress has not been \nquick enough.36 Considerable investment in collection systems and municipal treatment plants \nremains urgently needed. WWTPs are the key to water pollution control, since the industrial \ntreatment plants typically provide only pretreatment to a low effluent standard, prior to discharge \nto  a  municipal  sewer.  Social  surveys  demonstrate  that  city  populations  are  becoming \nincreasingly concerned about the impact of wastewater pollution. Similarly, although wastewater \ncompanies  have  been  established  in  many  cities,  few  are  financially  or  managerially \nautonomous and tariff increases have been slow to be implemented.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n34 Including residential, commercial, administration, and others.   \n35 Haihe, Huaihe, Liaohe, Changjiang (Yangtze River), Zhujiang, Songhuajiang, and Huanghe (Yellow River). \n36 Report from WPMO on a meeting of five key ministries involved in wastewater management. ", "  Appendix 2  29 \nF.  Wastewater Management in Changjiang Basin \n \n16.  The Changjiang is the largest river in the PRC. The Changjiang Valley Water Resources \nProtection Bureau has developed a basin-wide management plan, which is undergoing review \nat the national level. The draft plan cites the deteriorating water quality of the Changjiang. \nThough the river is often seen as having a high assimilative capacity, the cumulative effect of \nthe innumerable point and nonpoint discharges  is deteriorating water quality. Effects are felt \nthroughout downstream reaches and the East China Sea. Red tides37 have occurred and are \nbecoming more frequent. Bureau monitoring data demonstrate a growing pollution belt of near-\nshore pollution in cities along the river. The plan sets out a number of general pollution control \ntargets with specific targets to be developed by individual provinces and cities. \n \nG.   Wastewater Management in Wuhan  \n \n17.  Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province, lies about halfway along the course of the \nChangjiang. Wuhan has extensive water resources, which take up 25% of the urban built-up \narea.  In  response  to  state  requirements  and  in  accordance  with  the  basin  plan,  Wuhan \nMunicipal Government (WMG) adopted a target of Class II for the Wuhan stretch of the river, set \nout in the Wuhan Urban Master Plan. To meet the water quality target for the Changjiang and \ncomply with government regulations to treat 70% of municipal wastewater by 2010, WMG is \nimplementing the Wuhan Municipal Wastewater Master Plan. The plan divides the city into 13 \ndrainage areas and targets the dense urban areas for priority investment in a cost-effective \napproach.  Wuhan  has  also  developed  other  environmental  management  improvement \nprograms including the \u201cClean Water \u2013 Blue Sky Action Plan\u201d and \u201cSustainable Wuhan\u201d plan. It \nhas also drafted regulations for lake protection and pollution discharges as well as a sewer \ndischarge  permit  ordinance,  and  is  developing  comprehensive  sewer  connection  and \nrehabilitation programs.  \n \n18.  The Wuhan Municipal Wastewater Management Company (WMWC) was established in \n1995 and wastewater tariffs were introduced in 1996. Two wastewater treatment plants were \ncompleted  in  1998  but  they  are  only  able  to  treat  about  6%  of  the  2.05  million  m3/day \nwastewater generated. About 56% of the rivers and 89% of the lakes have been polluted by \norganic,  nitrogen,  and  phosphorus  wastes.  Water  quality  in  the  Wuhan  section  of  the \nChangjiang has deteriorated. In the middle 1980s it was Class II. Currently, none of the river \nreach attains Class III during the dry season and 67% of the river reach fails to attain Class III at \nother times. The Fu River, recipient of Sanjintan\u2019s effluent, is classified as Class IV, but \ngenerally only achieves Class V. Drinking water resources are at risk. Eutrophication of East \nLake is increasingly serious.38  \n \n19.  Figure A2.1 and Table A2.1 show the progress and location of the 13 planned treatment \nplants for the drainage areas that make up the Wastewater Master Plan. From a slow start, the \nMaster Plan is well under way but further investment is urgently needed. Tariffs have increased \nbut, as part of World Bank loan assurances for an ongoing WWTP project, remain well below \nfull cost recovery levels. Implementation of financial and enterprise reforms are overdue but will \nbe completed by the end of the year. The Project will assist in funding three WWTPs and \nassociated wastewater collection systems and further implement tariff and enterprise reform. \n                                                 \n37 Algae bloom, usually harmful to the aquatic environment and public health. \n38 Degradation of a water body as a result of elevated concentrations of nutrients, which upset the original ecological \nbalance by the prolific growth of algae. ", "30  Appendix 2 \nUnder the Project, about 26% of total wastewater will be treated, bringing the total to 45% by \nend-2007. Tariffs are proposed to be at full cost recovery by collecting revenue from the users.  \n \n20.  Wuhan will meet the 70% target if other WWTPs in the planning stage are implemented. \nThese include one funded out of World Bank loan savings, one funded by the Government of \nPoland, and two proposed build-operate-transfer  schemes for economic development zones. \n \n21.  The Project therefore is a critical component of the Wuhan Municipal Wastewater Master \nPlan,  which  is  also  a  fundamental  part  of  the  Wuhan  Urban  Master  Plan,  since  without \ninvestment in wastewater facilities, the planned urban expansion will not go ahead. While the \nProject will not enable WMG to immediately reach the target rate of 70%, it is an important step \nin enabling that target to be met in conjunction with other projects. The Project will also assist in \nthe implementation of other investments through cost recovery reform and assisting WMWC in \nachieving financial and corporate autonomy.  \n ", "  Appendix 2  31 \nFigure A2.1: Wuhan Wastewater Master Plan, Wastewater Treatment Plant Location \n \n Table A2.1: Wuhan Wastewater Master Plan, Wastewater Treatment Plants \nImplementation  \nPlant  Drainage  WWTP Capacity  WWTP  Funding  Completion  \nNo.  Area  (m3/day)  Status  Support   Date \n1  Huangpulu  100,000  In operation  WMG  1998 \n2  Shahua  50,000  In operation  WMG  1998 \n50,000  U/construction  World Bank  July 2002 \n3  Erlangmiao  180,000  U/construction  World Bank  July 2002 \n4  Longwangzui  150,000  U/construction  World Bank  July 2002 \n5  Sanjintan  300,000  In preparation  ADB  Est. 2007 \n6  Luobuzui  120,000  In preparation  ADB  Est. 2007 \n7  Huangjiahu  100,000  In preparation  ADB  Est. 2007 \n8  Nantaizihu  100,000  In preparation  Poland  Est. 2004 \n9  Zankou  50,000  Planned  BOT  Est. 2008 \n10  Miaoshan  60,000  Planned  BOT  Est. 2008 \n11  Hanxi  290,000  In preparation  World Bank  Est. 2005 \n12  Beihu  \u2014  Planned  \u2014  \u2014 \n13  Huangjiadawan  \u2014  Planned  \u2014  \u2014 \n\u2014 = not available, BOT = [xx ], WMG = Wuhan Municipal Government, WWTP = wastewater treatment plant  \na Shahu WWTP is expanding from the existing 50,000 to 100,000 m3/day.   \nSource: Information provided by  Wuhan Project Management Office, May 2002.

Introduction and Scope \n \n1.  The financial analysis includes: assessment of cost estimates and loan size; assessment \nof the affordability of the financing plan; tariffs and cost recovery; financial appraisal; and \naffordability. Important to the financial analysis was consideration of other recent and ongoing \nwastewater investment being undertaken by Wuhan Municipal Wastewater Company (WMWC), \nincluding projects supported by loans from the World Bank and the Government of Poland. \n \nB.  Cost Estimates and Asian Development Bank Loan Size \n \n2.  Total project costs are $193.6 million, including $83 million in foreign exchange costs to \nbe funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). In line with the ADB graduation policy for the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) (group A), the loan size is determined subject to financing \npercentages for specific items; the overall foreign exchange component; and the amount the \nGovernment wishes to borrow. Since ADB will finance the interest during construction, the \nestimated loan size will change with fluctuations in the interest rate. The interest used for loan \npreparation was the current 5-year swap rate plus the ADB fixed spread of 0.6%, giving a total \ninterest charge of 3.95%. \n \nC.  Financing Plan \n \n3.  PRC policy on wastewater management is fast moving toward commercial principles, \nsupported by institutions including the ADB. Recent ADB projects in the PRC generally included \nequity contributions from the Government as a major source of counterpart funds, whilst tariff \nincreases were proposed to increase gradually to reach full cost recovery by project completion, \nthereby ensuring long-term financial viability. Government policy is evolving quickly and a recent \nstatement from key Ministries39 involved in wastewater management has strengthened the PRC \npolicy  commitment  to  raising  tariffs  and  establishing  commercially  sound  wastewater \ncompanies.  Government  funding  for  wastewater  investment  projects  is  now  discouraged. \nRather, in an effort to speed up enterprise and tariff reform, wastewater companies are now \nexpected  to  fund  all  activities  from  their  own  resources,  including  finance  for  capital \nconstruction.  \n \n4.  In addition to the policy direction from State level, Wuhan Municipal Government (WMG)  \nhas also provided commitments to the World Bank for financial autonomy of WMWC. WMG has \ninterpreted this to mean that WMG should not provide counterpart funds for the ADB Project. \nThe proposed financing plan includes counterpart funds financed 100% by WMWC, through \ntariff revenues and local loans. Taking into consideration the financing requirements of other \nprojects, the plan requires that tariffs increase from the current CNY0.4/m3 to CNY0.75/m3 \nbefore the end of 2002 and 0.95/m3 before 2005. Recognizing that the increases are subject to \nthe normal procedures for price increases in the PRC, Wuhan Municipal Water Authority \n(WMWA),  WPMO,  Wuhan  Municipal  Finance  Bureau  and  Wuhan  Municipal  Price  Bureau \nconsidered that these increases are reasonable and subject to the normal procedures for price \nincreases in the PRC, would be socially and politically acceptable. Tariff revenues in the first \nyear of Project construction are supplemented by local loans of CNY69.6 million ($8.4 million), \n                                                 \n39 Information provided to the Mission by Wuhan Project Management Office, based on a meeting of five ministries: \nMinistry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of  Construction,  Ministry  of  Water  Resources,  State  Development  Planning \nCommission, and State Environmental Protection Administration, April 2002.   ", "38  Appendix 7 \nwhich are considered to be affordable given that the debt service coverage ratio remains \nsatisfactory. \n \n5.  Since  tariff  increases  are  required  for  Project  construction,  WMG  has  provided  a \nguarantee that if WMWC cannot provide the necessary counterpart funds then WMG will fund \nthe shortfall. This guarantee, included in the assurances, mitigates the financing risk and \nensures that counterpart funding will be available for the Project, while promoting commercial \nprinciples in wastewater management. A detailed analysis of the affordability of counterpart \nfunds, including the cash-flow requirement, is included in Supplementary Appendix I.  \n \n \nD.  Tariffs and Cost Recovery \n \n6.  Wastewater  tariffs  are  collected  by  the  Wuhan  Municipal  Water Supply Company \n(WMWSC). Although bills for water supply and wastewater are issued separately, they are \ndelivered together. Currently, wastewater revenue is passed from WMWSC to the Wuhan \nMunicipal  Finance  Bureau.  WMWC  is  given  a  part  of  that  revenue  as  a  direct  subsidy, \ndepending on estimated operational costs and investment plans. In accordance with assurances \nprovided to the World Bank as part of the Hubei Urban Environment Project, tariff revenues will \nbe passed directly to WMWC, which will be responsible for its own finances. This arrangement, \nwhich is a condition of ADB loan effectiveness, will be in place before the end of 2002 and will \nassist in ensuring financial autonomy of WMWC. \n \n7.  Wastewater tariffs have been in place in Wuhan for more than 5 years and tariffs for \nwater  and  wastewater  have  gradually  increased.  Tariffs  for  wastewater  are  relatively  low \ncompared to other cities in the PRC, reflecting the low rate of treatment (currently at only 6%). \nTable A7.1 shows water and wastewater charges since 1997. \n \nTable A7.1: Wuhan Water and Wastewater Tariffs, 1997-2002, CNY/m3 \n  1997  1998  1999  2000  2001a  2002 \nWater Supply \n Residential  0.45  0.45  0.62  0.62  0.70  0.70 \n Industrial  0.60  0.60  0.88  0.88  1.00  1.00 \n Commercial  1.00  1.00  1.46  1.46  1.70  1.70 \n Administration      0.69  0.69  0.80  0.80 \n Special      1.66  1.66  1.90  1.90 \nWastewaterb \n Residential  0.14  0.18  0.18  0.22  0.40  0.40 \n Industrial  0.14  0.18  0.18  0.22  0.40  0.40 \na 2001 tariffs from October. \nb Wastewater charges are based on 100% of water volume. \n \n8.  In  accordance with government policy and ADB recommendations, tariffs have been \nestimated, based on the principle of full cost recovery for WMWC by 2007. This includes \noperational expenditure, maintenance, depreciation, a profit margin, and interest on all loans, \nincluding the ADB loan. Allowances are made for doubtful debts at 15%. Calculated required \ntariffs in 2008 are  CNY0.83/m3 (constant 2002 prices) and CNY0.95/m3 (current prices).40 \nBased on tariffs calculated for other World Bank and ADB projects in the PRC, required tariffs \nfor cities with 100% treatment are usually in the range of CNY1.3/m3 to CNY1.8/m3. Since, after \n                                                 \n40 Inflation is assumed to be 2.5% domestic and 2.0% international. ", "  Appendix 7  39 \nthe Project, the treatment rate is about 45%, the calculated tariffs are consistent with other cities \nin the PRC. \n \n9.  Given the requirement for tariff revenues to also provide counterpart funding for the \nProject, tariff increases will need to take place before the end of 2002 and 2003 to provide funds \nfor  2003  and  2004  respectively.  The  tariffs  used  in  calculating  the  financing  plan  are \nCNY0.75/m3 for 2003\u20132004 and CNY0.95 for 2005\u20132007, which are very similar to those \nrequired for full cost recovery. Under the Project therefore, long-term full cost recovery tariffs will \nbe in place early in the Project, during the third year of project construction. \n \nE.  Financial Appraisal \n \n10.  Project financial appraisal was undertaken jointly for the project components since they \nwill be operated by WMWC and the same tariff will apply across the city. Since WMWC also \nowns and operates other wastewater facilities, including treatment plants, funded by the single \ntariff, the project financial appraisal assesses the viability of this Project to WMWC. \n \n11.  The financial appraisal compares the financial internal rate of return (FIRR)41 to the \nweighted average cost of capital (WACC); and the average incremental cost (AIFC) to the \naverage incremental revenue (AIFR). Sensitivity tests were undertaken for increases in costs, \ndecreases in revenues, and delays in revenues. The appraisal was conducted using constant \n2002 prices. A detailed analysis is included in Supplementary Appendix I.  \n \n12.  The WACC was calculated based on ADB\u2019s latest guidelines.42 The nominal costs of \nfunds were assumed to be 2.73% for the ADB loan, based on the 5-year swap rate of 3.35% \nplus ADB\u2019s fixed spread of 0.6%; 8.0% for internal cash, and 6.3% for the local commercial \nbank loans. Nominal costs were adjusted for tax and inflation. For both the ADB loan and the \ncommercial bank-funded portions, the calculated rate was less than 4% and thus the minimum \nallowable rate of 4% was applied to these funding sources. The overall WACC was 4.6%.  \n \n13.  Incremental revenue was calculated using total WMWSC water sales since the proposed \nwastewater tariffs will apply to all water users, not just those living in the project area. However, \nnot all the tariff increase from the existing level (CNY0.4/m3) can be attributed to the Project. \nUnder the ongoing World Bank project, tariff increases are also required. The calculation of \nincremental revenue assumed that an increase in the tariff to CNY0.6/m3 was attributable to the \nWorld Bank project43 and the residual increase was attributable to this Project. \n  \n14.   Operation  and  maintenance  costs  include  personnel  (10%  of  total  operation  and \nmaintenance),  energy  costs  (36%),  chemicals  (7%),  administration  (2%),  repairs  and \nmaintenance (44%), and other (1%).  \n \n15. The FIRR was 10.4%, which exceeds the WACC of 4.6%. The FIRR exceeds the WACC for \nall sensitivity tests. Interest rate sensitivity for the ADB loan was calculated. The FIRR and \nassociated sensitivity tests are given in Table A7.2.  \n \n                                                 \n41 The FIRR calculation uses project capital costs and additional operation and maintenance costs associated with \nthe Project. \n42 Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by the ADB. 2001.  \n43 Assumption  based  on  the  required  average  tariff  calculated  by  the  World  Bank  consultants,  Ecology  & \nEnvironment, Inc.

Affordability  \n \n16.  An affordability analysis was undertaken to assess whether the Project is affordable to \nresidential consumers. In line with ADB guidelines, the affordability criteria were set at a \nmaximum of 5% of monthly household income for combined water and wastewater charges.  \nHousehold income data from the project preparatory technical assistance household survey, \nwhich covered the project area, was compared to official citywide household income distribution \ndata from the Wuhan Statistical Yearbook 2001. The two data sets were reasonably similar, with \nthe household survey showing slightly lower levels of income than the official citywide data, \nparticularly at the low income range.  \n \n17.  The residential water sales data were extracted from domestic water sales, which \nincludes other categories. Residential water sales were 269 million m3 in 2001. The population \nserved is estimated at 6.7 million, including 5.4 million registered population (11 urban districts) \nand 1.3 unregistered population. Water sales are estimated at 110 liters per capita per day \n(lpcd). To be conservative, no allowance was made for lower water use for lower income \nfamilies and income growth was assumed to be zero. Household charges were calculated using \nthe proposed wastewater tariff and existing water tariffs. It was possible to use existing water \ntariffs as a proxy for future water tariffs since there are no plans for water tariff increases and \nWMWA considers that water tariffs are already at the full cost recovery rate.  \n \n18.   Table A7.3 shows the affordability analysis using the city-wide official income data. For \nthe average household, the charges amount to 0.9% of monthly income. The results show that \nthe proposed charges are also affordable at all income levels, since the combined charge \nconstitutes less than 5% of monthly household income. Although the income data from the \nhousehold survey was lower, using the same approach, the results show that even for the \npoorest 10% of households, the combined charge is less than 5%. In addition, for the very \npoorest households, WMG has an established subsidy program, run by the Civil Affairs Bureau, \nwhich assists in paying for basic services, including water and wastewater.

Financial statements have been prepared for Wuhan Municipal Wastewater (WMWC) for \n2003 to 2017. Projections include existing operations of WMWC, including the ongoing World \nBank project; the proposed Government of Poland project; and the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) Wuhan Wastewater Management Project (WWMP). Projections are undertaken in local \ncurrency, using current prices. Detailed performance review, assumptions, and results are \nshown in Supplementary Appendix I.  \n \n2.  WMWC was established in 1995. Since 2000, WMWC has produced accounts under the \nenterprise accounting system and these have been audited at three levels: internally, by Wuhan \nMunicipal Government (WMG) and an external audit.  \n \n3.  The profit and loss accounts show a healthy profit but it is misleading to use this as a \njudge of future performance since currently WMWC does not receive wastewater revenues \ndirectly from WMWSC but relies solely on operational subsidies from WMG. By the end of 2002, \nWMWC will be the direct recipient of wastewater charges and, as such, will have far greater \nfinancial autonomy. \n \n4.  Long-term average tariffs are estimated for full cost recovery for 2008 at CNY0.95/m3 \n(current prices) including operation and maintenance, interest on loans, depreciation, and a \nprofit margin. During project implementation, tariffs are assumed to be 0.75/m3 (2003-2004) and \n0.90/m3 (2005-2007). Together with the local loans, these tariffs provide funds for project \ncounterpart funding. After 2008, tariffs are assumed to stay constant in real terms.  \n \n5.  Loans include (i) the World Bank loan at 6.7% interest, a term of 20 years, a grace \nperiod of 5 years; (ii) the ADB loan, at 3.95%, a loan term of 25 years, and a 5-year grace \nperiod; (iii) Government of Poland loan at 1.98% interest, a term of 14 years, and a 2-year grace \nperiod; and (iv) local loans at 5.3%, 5-year term, and no grace period. \n \n6.  Wastewater collection assets are assumed to be transferred to WMWC prior to the end \nof 2002, at a value of about CNY1.3 billion. Depreciation is charged at 4.8%.

WMWC proposes to borrow short-term funds if necessary. However, it \nis likely that the Polish project and the World Bank extension project will happen later than \nassumed in the financial analysis and this should help the funds flow situation and negate the \nneed for additional borrowing.

Introduction, Approach, and Scope  \n \n1.  The  economic  analysis  was  undertaken  using  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nguidelines.44 The approach takes into consideration the fact that the proposed Project is not a \nstand-alone investment, but is an integrated part of an ongoing city, municipal, and basin-wide \nenvironmental program, whereby overall environmental goals are jointly achieved with other \ninvestments. For projects of this nature, where the impact is very difficult to attribute to specific \nprojects or components, often the economic justification relies on strong rationale, consideration \nof alternatives and appropriate assessment of project risk. The economic analysis therefore \nprovides an in-depth economic rationale based on policy, sector, and local area analysis, which \nexamines the least-cost approach to achieving environmental objectives. Despite the general \ndifficulties associated with attributing and valuing benefits of wastewater management, the \neconomic analysis also includes a project economic evaluation and calculation of economic \ninternal rates of return (EIRRs); and an assessment of project sustainability and risk. A detailed \neconomic analysis is included as Supplementary Appendix H.  \n \nB.  Project Description and Beneficiaries \n \n2.  The proposed Project forms an integral component of the Wuhan Municipal Wastewater \nMaster Plan. The Project will provide collection systems and secondary wastewater treatment \nplants for three of the 13 identified drainage areas in Wuhan. There are two existing wastewater \ntreatment plants (WWTPs)  in Wuhan, which currently provide a treatment rate of 6%; three \nWWTPs are under construction, which will increase the treatment rate to 19% by the end of \n2002. The proposed Project will add an additional 26%, giving a total treatment rate of 45%. \nFour more WWTPs are in various stages of preparation, including two build-operate-transfer \n(BOT)  schemes,  but  these  are  unlikely  to  be  completed  before  the  end  of  project \nimplementation. Together, all the proposed WWTPs will bring the total treatment rate to 70%. \n \n3.  The Project will directly serve a collection area of 148 km2 and 1.8 million people (by \n2010).  However, the impact of the Project is far wider. The investment in wastewater facilities \nundertaken by Wuhan Municipal Government (WMG) is a fundamental part of the Wuhan Urban \nMaster Plan (WUMP) through (i) providing necessary infrastructure for new development areas; \n(ii) improving  the  existing  living  environment  and  public  health;  (iii) contributing  to  urban \ndevelopment schemes; and (iv) contributing to the overall vision for a clean, modern city through \nsustainable  economic  growth.  The  number  of  indirect  beneficiaries  includes  the  urban \npopulation of Wuhan (5.4 million) and the municipality (7.5  million). Populations downstream \ninclude the municipality of Shanghai with a population of over 20 million. There are also \nproposals to undertake a project that will divert part of the Changjiang to the Taihu Lake, to \nassist in water quality and this would link the Project to the ADB Suzhou Creek Project, which \naddresses the pollution of the downstream water course, flowing from Taihu through Shanghai \nto the Huangpu River. \n \n                                                 \n44 Including Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects  and Handbookfor the Economic Analysis of Water \nSupply Projects. ", "  Appendix 9  45 \nC.  Economic Rationale, Policy Analysis, and Assessment of Alternatives  \n4.  The  institutional  framework  for  managing  environmental  quality45  in  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) consists of two main components: (i) legal standards and targets; and \n(ii) policies regulations and plans, aimed at meeting those targets. The 1996 Water Pollution \nand Prevention Law provides the legal basis, under which the State Environmental Protection \nAdministration designates standards (or targets) that apply to key water courses, through a \nrigorous technical process. Although public consultation in setting the targets was limited, there \nis general public support for environmental policies, and thus the justification for chosen targets \nis sound.  \n \n5.  The target for the Wuhan section of the Changjiang under WUMP is Class II. In addition, \nthe state guidelines require that Wuhan reaches a wastewater treatment rate of 70% by 2010. \nThe Changjiang Valley Water Resource Bureau draft management plan cites the deteriorating \nquality of the river and the growing pollution belt and calls for individual cities and municipalities \nto draw up their own plans for pollution control. The Wuhan Wastewater Master Plan, including \nthe Project, is a key component of WMG\u2019s environmental program.46 While the Changjiang has \na high assimilative capacity, the cumulative effects of numerous point and nonpoint discharges \nare deteriorating water quality. While it is not possible to measure the incremental impact of the \nProject on water quality, it is clear that without the Project, neither the ambient water quality \ntarget nor the target treatment rate will be achieved.  \n \n6.  PRC environmental policy adopts a cost-effective approach to wastewater management. \nMajor point source polluters were targeted first and much progress was made through the \nimplementation of the Ninth Five-Year Plan. In Wuhan, this included Wuhan Steel Mill and a \npetrochemical plant. The next targets for wastewater management have been industries, which \nwere required to provide adequate wastewater treatment by December 2000 and large centers \nof population including Wuhan. Selection of projects within Wuhan has focused on the areas of \ndense population first, with the proposed Project providing necessary collection and treatment \nfor the next three areas of identified priority. The chosen projects were also the least-cost \nsolution in terms of technical treatment options.  \n \nD.  Project Economic Evaluation \n \n7.  Project evaluation was undertaken for each component separately and for the Project as \na  whole.  The  economic  evaluation  was  undertaken  using  the  domestic  price  level  and \nnumeraire and constant 2002 prices. Financial costs are converted to economic costs using a \nstandard conversion factor of 0.89. Valued economic benefits included (i) the environmental and \npublic health improvements resulting from rehabilitation and extension of the collection system, \nusing property value increases as a proxy value; and (ii) resource cost savings to industries. \nThe timing of property value increases were based on a conservative view of the pace of \ndevelopment. There are significant economic benefits  that were not valued such that the \ncalculated EIRR is a conservative estimate of the true EIRR. Benefits that were considered \nqualitatively were (i) the economic growth impacts of new city development, (ii) water resources \nprotection, and (iii) downstream benefits of nonindustrial wastewater treatment. The EIRR was \ncalculated at 16.4% for Sanjintan, 17.5% for Huangjiahu, 16.6% for Luobuzui, and 16.9% for the \nProject as a whole. \n                                                 \n45 The policy analysis focused on surface water quality as the key objective in wastewater management. Water \nresources management, including groundwater, is also an objective.  \n46 WMG has also developed other programs including the \u201cClean Water - Blue Sky\u201d action plan and \u201cSustainable \nWuhan\u201d plan.

Introduction  \n \n1.  Population growth and economic development have contributed to the degradation of \nthe quality of the aquatic environment in Wuhan. Fifty-six percent of the rivers and 89% of the \nlakes in Wuhan have been polluted to different levels by organic materials and nutrients. the \nChangjiang water quality has deteriorated, which has led to adverse impacts to water supply \nsources, reduced suitability of the rivers for their classified use as well as general environmental \ndegradation. The majority of wastewater is now treated in individual systems before it is \ndischarged to drainage channels (including open channels and streams), soil, and groundwater. \nA full environmental impact assessment (EIA) has been prepared in accordance with People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) Law and Asian Development Bank (ADB) policies.47 The  summary \nenvironment impact assessment (SEIA), with the summary resettlement plan (SRP) as an \nattachment was circulated in June 2002. \n \nB.  Description of the Environment \n \n2.  Key features relevant to wastewater management are as follows. The Project area has \n(i) a subtropical monsoon climate with abundant rainfall; (ii) many rivers, lakes, and ponds with \nmore than 25% of the municipality covered by water; (iii) mostly clay and sandy clay soil; and \n(iv) shallow groundwater. Groundwater is the major water source for industries; surface water is \nsource for all other uses. The major water bodies affected include the Changjiang (Wuhan \nsection), the Fu River (Wuhan section), and East and Tangxun lakes. Aquaculture is a major \nactivity in the area. The Changjiang is the ultimate receiving water body for all wastewater \ntreatment plant (WWTP)  effluents. The cumulative effect of point and nonpoint discharges have \ncontributed to its degradation. Local pollution is common in river reaches in major cities. Table \nA10.1 summarizes existing water quality. \n \nTable A10.1: Existing Water Quality of Receiving Water Bodies \nWWTP  Receiving Water Bodies  Water Quality Requirementa  Existing Water Quality \nSanjintan  Fu River  Class IV  Worse than Class V \nHuangjiahu  Qingling River  Class IV  Class V \n     \nLuobuzui  Shahu Gang  Class IV  Worse than Class V \nReceiving Water Body  Changjiang  Class II  Class IV \nWWTP = wastewater treatment plant \na National water quality classes are I to V, of which I and II are pristine and can be used as a source for potable \nwater, and V is the worst. The PRC Environmental Quality Standards have five classes for surface water quality \nbased on their use. Class I is for water resources and nationally protected bodies of water. Class II is for high-\nvalue fish-production areas, class A protection areas, and spawning habitats for fish. Class III is for potable water \nresources, class B protection areas, general fish protection areas, and swimming areas. Class IV is for general \nindustrial water sources and noncontact recreation areas. Class I water sources are the best in quality and Class V \nare the worst. \n \nC.   Alternatives \n \n3.  Without the Project, water  quality will continue to deteriorate since individual systems \ncannot effectively treat wastewater given the population density, hydrologic conditions, soil \nconditions, etc. With the Project, living conditions and aquatic environmental quality in the \nWuhan urban area will be improved and drinking water source protection will be enhanced.  \n                                                 \n47 To be included as Supplementary Appendix B.

Based on various conditions and \nrequirements, particularly effluent quality requirements, the anaerobic plus modified carousel \noxidation ditch process was proposed for Sanjintan WWTP and the oxidation ditch process was \nproposed for Huangjiahu and Luobuzui WWTPs. Two alternative sites were evaluated for each \nWWTP.  Alternative  effluent  outfall  locations  were  evaluated.  Sludge  disposal  will  be  to  a \nsanitary landfill.  \n \nD.

Poverty Analysis   Proposed Classification: Other  \nPoverty analysis has been treated as an integral part of project design and based on quantitative and qualitative \nmethodologies. The project design has included the analysis of poverty data at country and province levels and involved \nfield-poverty assessments and stakeholder consultations.  \n \nThe Project will have direct and indirect poverty reduction effects on its rural and urban beneficiaries. Based on the project \npreparatory technical assistance (PPTA) household survey of the beneficiary population in the project area, approximately \n23.7% of those live below the Asian Development Bank (ADB) poverty line (5.4% rural, 24.3% urban).48 The construction \nand operation of the Project will create many employment opportunities for the local population. During construction, 7,750 \nperson-years of employment will be generated with an estimated 3,340 person-years to be filled by the poor; during \noperations 77 full-time jobs for the poor with an estimated CNY4.5 million/year in salaries will be generated. Project-related \nservices, such as procurement of construction materials and equipment, are expected to provide an additional 840 person-\nyears of employment, valued at CNY16.0 million and with target training and microcredit programs the poor and women \ncould reap up to 50% of these wages. The implementation of the Project will lead to improvement in sewage service and \nsanitary conditions and will contribute to the reduction in morbidity and mortality rates of waterborne diseases and savings \nin associated medical costs and loss of healthy working days. As an example, each case of dysentery results in \napproximately CNY480 of direct medical costs and 30 lost workdays. These benefits are greater for children, elderly, \nwomen, and the poor as they are more vulnerable to these diseases. Improved health and quality of life will promote local \neconomic development. Moreover, agricultural production losses will be reduced and depressed prices for agricultural \nproducts will be mitigated through the improved quality of irrigation water. The improvement in water quality will ensure the \nsteady development of the water-based tourism industry, which is to a large extent water-based and depends directly on the \nwater quality. Tourism brings multiple benefits, including increased income and employment opportunities, to the local \ncommunities. Women and poor will benefit from the tourism activities, as they are involved in tourism as operators and \nvendors. The reduced pollution and improved water quality in the receiving waters will reduce the costs of treatment for \nWuhan\u2019s existing and future water treatment plants, which will be passed onto the consumers. Socioeconomic loss from \nsevere water logging can be mitigated. The improved environment can serve as a major contributing factor to increased \ninvestment. Wuhan has demonstrated that improving the environment is an effective way for reducing poverty and \nimproving living conditions (TA5939-REG: Strategies for Poverty Reduction Through Urban Environmental Improvements). \nImportantly, subsidies will be provided to households below income poverty levels. \n \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder Analysis Prepared:  YES \nPublic consultation/participation is the core element of the project design and planning and is prepared through community \ndriven design mechanisms involving beneficiaries. A community participation and awareness program will be formulated \nand implemented to serve as ongoing consultation mechanism with the involvement of all stakeholders. \nParticipation Strategy  YES \nOngoing consultations will be carried out on a regular basis to ensure that Wuhan Municipal Wastewater Company \nunderstands and meets the evolving needs and expectations of the users; increases the awareness of the public, especially \nthe beneficiaries, about the benefits of the Project; and raises the social acceptance of user tariff and charges. Health \neducation campaigns will also be carried out. The consultations can take the form of annual surveys by consumer category, \ncombined with ad hoc community forums. Possible public information mechanisms will include information programs on \nlocal television, radio, newsletters, web sites, and community meetings. Women\u2019s organizations and schools usually have \nextensive networks, and, therefore, can be used for the distribution of information materials and survey questionnaires.  \n                                                 \n48 Based on the household survey, the poverty ratio utilizing ADB\u2019s poverty line in the service area is approximately \n24%, while interpolation of city-wide statistics data indicate a poverty ratio of approximately 15%. Using the PRC\u2019s \npoverty line, or \u201cminimum living standard\u201d scheme, city statistics indicate a poverty ratio of 4.2%. Observations \nduring project preparation suggest that the true poverty ratio lies between the interpolated data and the household \nsurvey data. ", "  Appendix 11  51 \nD.

The RP details the  Resettlement \nrehabilitation approach and implementation with close consultation with  Information \nlocal officials and village committees during the feasibility studies. The  Booklet, by \nresettlement strategy encompasses the replacement of housing,  EA \ninfrastructure, and income.

Most  Supp-\nAPs will be resettled within their own villages to provided new housing  lementary RP \nsite free of charge, and connected with essential infrastructure. \nRelocated, urban APs will be given cash compensation sufficient to \npurchase replacement apartments in the project areas. The three \nrelocated enterprises will be provided with cash compensation for lost \nstructures, lost wages, and lost profit and alternative site for \nreconstruction to restore their operation. APs affected by the permanent \nland acquisition will receive generous cash compensation. The limited \nremaining farmland within two of three villages makes it difficult to carry \nout land redistribution among these villages. Following consultation with \naffected villages and local government, the approach is to provide full \nresettlement subsidy equal to 10 times average annual output value to \nthose APs, which could be used for various nonfarm activities. According \nto the social economic survey, most APs are currently engaged in \nvarious nonfarm activities, and farming income accounted for less than \n20% of their total income.

Along  with  land  acquisition,  a  total  of  70,803  m2 of structures will be demolished, \nincluding 2% frame structures, 77% brick concrete, 14% brick wood, and the rest as earth wood \nor simple structures. A total of 321 households and 1,253 APs will be temporarily affected, \nincluding 236 households (839 persons) from rural areas and 83 households (365 persons) from \nurban areas. Rural households will only need to be relocated within their own villages to the \nhousing plots provided by the villages. Urban households will be assigned new apartments \nwithin the same area. A total of 25 enterprises will be affected by the land acquisition and \nbuilding demolition  and only three of them will be relocated within the existing village. The \nremaining enterprises are affected through loss of supplemental structures, like warehouses \nand storage facilities. The buildings will be restored with cash compensation provided under the \nProject.  \n  \nC.   Policy Framework and Compensation Standards \n \n5.  For people unavoidably affected by the Project, the resettlement objective is to ensure \nattainment of equal, or better, livelihoods and living standards than without the Project. The \nExecuting  Agency  (EA), Wuhan project management office (WPMO), will ensure that any \npeople losing land, housing, or other assets due to the Project will be assisted in restoring their \nincome  and  living  standards.  Following  consultation  with  local  governments  and  general \npractice in Wuhan, a set of generous compensation standards that are near the top of the 1998 \nLand Law range was adopted by WPMO. For permanent land acquisition, a total of 21 times \naverage  annual  output  value  (AAOV) will  be  provided  with  10  times  AAOV  for  land \ncompensation, 10 times AAOV for resettlement subsidy, and 1 time AAOV for green crop \ncompensation. Based on average yields, the compensation rates will be set at CNY126,000/mu \nfor vegetable land, dry lands, and other noncultivated land, and CNY80,000/mu for fish pond. \nFor temporary land occupation, 2 times AAOV will be provided with 1 time for annual loss and 1 \ntime for restoring land to original conditions. For lost structures, replacement value will be \nprovided with CNY1,400/m2 for frame structure, CNY900/m2 for brick concrete, CNY600/m2 for \nbrick wood, and CNY400/m2 for earth wood structure. In addition, relocated households will be \nprovided with transfer assistance, including moving allowance, early moving bonus, etc. \n \nD.   Rehabilitation Approach and Measures \n \n6.  In order to avoid land acquisition in the most densely populated areas, efforts were \nmade in close consultation with local officials and village committees during the feasibility \nstudies to minimize the resettlement impacts. For APs, the resettlement strategy encompasses \nthe replacement of housing, infrastructure, and income. People losing housing will receive direct \ncompensation  based  on  replacement  value  of  their  lost  structures.  Due  to  limited  land \nacquisition, most of these people will be resettled within their own villages, provided with new \nhousing sites free of charge, and connected with essential infrastructure (e.g., water, sewer, \nroad, gas, and electricity). Relocated urban households will be given cash compensation that is \nsufficient to purchase replacement apartments in the project area. Affected enterprises will be \nprovided  with  cash  compensation  covering  lost  structures,  lost  wages,  lost  profit,  and  an \nalternative site for reconstruction.  \n \n7.  Those affected by permanent land acquisition who are primarily concentrated in the \nWWTP site will receive compensation. Two approaches for economic rehabilitation will be taken \nbased on different village conditions. For Sanjintan, since the affected Zhangjiadun Company \nwill have sufficient farmland left after land acquisition, land redistribution will be carried out to \nensure that each individual still has 1.5 mu farmland after land acquisition. In addition, the \nresettlement subsidy will be distributed equally among all members in the company, and land \ncompensation will be used to improve farm conditions and create nonfarm opportunities for the ", "54  Appendix 12 \nAPs. For the other two affected villages, land redistribution after land acquisition is difficult due \nto limited land holdings. Following consultation with affected villages and local government, a \nfull resettlement subsidy equal to 10 times AAOV will be provided to those APs for expanding \nnonfarm activities. According to the socioeconomic survey, which covered 33% of total affected \nhouseholds, most of the affected villagers are currently engaged in various nonfarm activities, \nwith farming income accounting for less than 20% of their total income. In addition, the affected \nvillages  will  use  70%  of  the  land  compensation  (10  times  AAOV) to  develop a range of \nemployment opportunities, such as small shops and gas stations, to set up village enterprises, \nwhich will provide about 240 employment opportunities for the APs. To facilitate the process, the \nWPMO has committed to provide up to 77 employment opportunities in these WWTPs. In \naddition, some APs will also benefit from temporary employment during project construction and \nthere are provisions for direct payments to pay the resettlement subsidy direct to APs opting for \nself-employment where workers obtain enterprise jobs rather than to the village committee.  \n \nE.   Institutional Arrangements  \n \n8.  Wuhan  municipal  government  will  assume  full  responsibility  for  implementing \nresettlement according to the approved RP. Within WPMO under Wuhan Municipal Wastewater \nCompany, a project resettlement office (PRO) with 7-8 full time staff will be set up to be \nresponsible  for  coordinating  resettlement  planning  and  supervising  implementation  for  the \nProject. The PRO will be responsible for monitoring and supervision, coordinating an impact \nsurvey,  carrying  out  consultation,  contracting  with  an  independent  monitor,  allocating \nresettlement funds, and inspecting the utilization of funds by local government. A resettlement \ncoordination group to respond to requests for ni formation and grievances will be formally \nestablished and is now operating informally. The township resettlement officers, together with \naffected village officials, are responsible for the payment of entitlements, the selection of new \nhousing  sites,  the  redistribution  of  remaining  farmland,  the  development  of  economic \nrehabilitation measures, and the provision of livelihood support. Land compensation will be paid \ndirectly to the affected villages, while resettlement subsidy compensations for housing and \nyoung crops will be paid directly to the APs.  \n \nF.   Vulnerable Groups \n \n9.  A  sample  socioeconomic  survey  identified  vulnerable  households,  including  welfare \nhouseholds, households headed by women, and households headed by people with disabilities. \nFrom  the  survey  of  272  households,  three  vulnerable  households  of  five  persons  were \nidentified, accounting for 1.2% of surveyed population. Any vulnerable households identified \nduring  resettlement  implementation  will  receive  CNY  5,000  additional  financial  assistance \nbesides the provided resettlement compensation. In addition, they will also receive assistance \nfor house construction and relocation during resettlement implementation. Special measures are \nalso provided to support creation of new small enterprises by women from affected households. \n \nG.   Consultation, Disclosure, and Grievance Redress \n \n10.  The PRC 1998 Land Administration Law provides for disclosure and consultation with \nthe APs. A series of consultation meetings were carried out during the RP preparation where \nAPs  were  consulted  about  the  key  elements  of  the  resettlement  plan  and  rehabilitation \nmeasures. Additional consultations will be made during the resettlement implementation to \nensure suitable relocation sites and economic rehabilitation options, and subsequent planning, \nincluding the designation of project-related jobs for affected persons. At least 3 months prior to \nland acquisition and relocation, the approved RP will be disclosed to all affected villages and \nindividuals. Specifically, upon State Development Planning Commission approval of the Project ", "                                                                                                                        Appendix 12        55    \nand prior to project negotiation, copies of the RP will be placed in the affected village offices and \nWPMO for people to review. A resettlement information booklet including key resettlement \npolicies and grievance procedures was distributed to all affected townships and villages in May \n2002. The PRO will be responsible for receiving the comments of the APs and addressing their \nconcerns.  \n \n11.  The RP includes grievance redress arrangements. In the case of grievance, AP submits \nan oral or written complaint first to the village committee. If the complaint cannot be settled \nwithin 2 weeks, then the AP can go to the township government for redress. If still unresolved \nwithin 2 weeks, the PRO or Wuhan Municipal Land Administration Bureau will try to achieve a \nsolution  directly  within  3  weeks.  The  final  redress  could  be  sought  in  the  civil  courts  in \naccordance with the PRC Civil Procedure Act, within 15 days of receipt of the PRO decision. \n \nH.   Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n12.  A  systematic  procedure  for  internal  supervision,  reporting,  and  evaluation  of  key \nresettlement activities will be developed. The system will comprise regular reporting from the \nresettlement  staff  at  the  township  level  to  PRO.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  include  APs\u2019 \nfeedback, including external monitor access to grievance redress records. A qualified institution \nwill be employed to carry out independent resettlement monitoring and evaluation for the \nProject. The selected institution, whose qualifications will be reviewed and confirmed, will \nconduct an undated baseline survey, carry out semiannual inspection and surveys updates \nduring  the  period  of  resettlement  implementation,  prepare  reports,  and  evaluate  the \nresettlement results 2 years after completion. The PRO will report to ADB on progress in land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  through  quarterly  progress  reports.  WPMO  will  also  submit \nindependent resettlement monitoring and evaluation reports prepared by the selected institution \nto ADB every 6 months during project implementation.  \n \nI.   Finance and Implementation Schedule \n \n13.  The total cost of land acquisition and resettlement, including contingencies, is estimated \nat CNY244.1 million ($29.3 million equivalent). This includes the cost of asset compensation, \nother assistance, income restoration, land occupation taxes, temporary land disturbance, and \nresettlement supervision, management, monitoring, and evaluation. Annual adjustment in the \ncost estimates, including compensation rates, will be made based on the inflation rate for the \nprevious year. The land acquisition and resettlement costs are included in the project cost \nestimates. The Project will be implemented from June 2003 to June 2008. Land acquisition and \nresettlement activities will need to be completed prior to the end of 2004 for the wastewater \ncollection and treatment facilities construction. Three months prior to construction, the APs will \nbe officially informed of the effects to them and compensation entitlements; a compensation \nagreement  will  be  signed  between  WPMO  and  affected  villages  and  individuals;  and \ncompensation funds will be paid to the affected villages, enterprises, and individuals. New \nhousing  construction,  acquisition  and  hand-over  of  land  for  construction  purposes,  and \ndemolition and ground leveling will proceed sequentially in sections, and will precede the start of \nconstruction work involving acquisition. Supervision, auditing, monitoring, and evaluation will be \ncontinuous throughout the Project. \n \n14.  The source of funding for resettlement will be $29.3 million equivalent from WMWC, with \nWMG to make up any shortfalls as agreed in loan assurances. Section 10 of the RP provides \ndetailed flow of funds information. ", "56  Appendix 13 \nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR LOAN CONSULTING SERVICES \n \nA.  Scope of Work \n1.
