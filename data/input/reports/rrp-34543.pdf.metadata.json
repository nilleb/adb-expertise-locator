As  natural  resources  underpin  economic  development  and\npoverty  reduction  prospects,  the  Government  attaches  priority  to\nconserving  the  environment  and  ensuring  the  environmental  and\nsocial sustainability of all development activities.\n\nImproving  environmental  management  and  social  safeguards\nperformance  has  been  the  subject  of  considerable  policy  dialogue\nand  technical  assistance.  Enactment  of  the  Environment  Protection\nLaw (EPL) in 1999 was a breakthrough. Together with environmental\nprovisions  in  laws  on  electricity,  roads,  land,  water  resources,  and\nforests, the EPL provides a framework for implementing safeguards.\nHowever,  effective  enforcement  requires  the  adoption  of  enabling\nregulations,  compliance  mechanisms,  and  measures  to  enhance\nGovernment capacity and financial sustainability. Without these, the\nintegration  of  environmental  management  and  social  safeguard\nissues across sectors will remain elusive.\n\nThe Government aims to go beyond case-by-case remedial action on\nenvironmental and social impacts, toward a proactive approach that\nintegrates  these  concerns  within  national,  sectoral,  and  area-based\nplanning.  The  Government  has  sought  Asian  Development  Bank\n(ADB)  assistance  to  develop  and  implement  a  program  aimed  at\nputting  the  country  on  a  more  sustainable  development  trajectory,\nfocusing initially on the energy and transport sectors. This will require\naddressing  five  closely  related  sets  of  constraints:  (i)  incomplete\npolicy and regulatory framework; (ii) lack of implementation capacity\nat  sectoral  and  provincial  levels;  (iii)  inadequate  compliance  and\nenforcement  mechanisms;  (iv)  absence  of  integrated  area-based\nplanning  frameworks  to  guide  investments  in  energy  and  transport;\nand (v) insufficient attention to sustainable finance for environmental\nmanagement.\n\nObjectives and\nScope\n\nThe  objective  is  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  policy  reform  agenda\nfor  improved  environmental  management  and  social  safeguards  in\nthe  energy  and  transport  sectors.  The  Program  covers  five  closely\nlinked priority areas for policy action: (i) strengthening national policy\n\n\fiii\n\nand regulatory framework for environmental management and social\nsafeguards;  (ii)  enhancing  policy  implementation  measures  and\ncapacity at sectoral and provincial levels; (iii) improving  compliance\nand enforcement; (iv) promoting river basin management as a multi-\nsectoral and integrated planning framework for energy and transport\nfinancing\ndevelopment; \nmechanisms, including an environment fund.\n\nestablishing \n\nsustainable \n\nand \n\n(v) \n\nClassification\n\nEnvironmental protection\n\nEnvironmental\nAssessment\n\nThe Program is classified as category B.  Environmental implications\nwere reviewed, and no significant negative impacts were identified.\n\nThe ADB Loan\n\nLoan Amount\nand Terms\n\nProgram\nPeriod and\nTranching\n\nExecuting\nAgency\n\nProcurement\n\nA  loan  of  SDR15,648,000  ($20  million  equivalent)  is  proposed  from\nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources.  The  loan  will  have  a  repayment\nperiod  of  24  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years.  An  interest\nrate of 1 percent will be charged per annum during the grace period\nand 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\n\nThe  program  period  will  be  36  months  (2002-2004).  The  proposed\nloan  is  to  be  disbursed  in  three  tranches.  The  first  tranche  of  $5.0\nmillion  will  be  made  available  upon  loan  effectiveness.  The  second\ntranche of $10.0 million will be disbursed within 14 months after the\nfirst  tranche,  subject  to  the  Government\u2019s  compliance  with  the\nconditions  set  for  the  release  of  that  tranche.  The  third  tranche  of\n$5.0 million will be made available when the Government establishes\nan environment fund during the 36 months of loan utilization.\n\nThe  Science,  Technology,  and  Environment  Agency  (STEA)  will  be\nthe Executing Agency for the Program, in close coordination with the\nCommittee for Planning and Cooperation (CPC); Ministry of Finance\n(MOF); Ministry of Communication, Transport, Post and Construction\n(MCTPC); Ministry of Industry and Handicrafts (MIH); and Ministry of\nAgriculture and Forestry (MAF). STEA will have overall responsibility\nfor  ensuring  effective  implementation  of  the  Program.  MOF  will\nmonitor the use of the loan proceeds and counterpart funds.\n\nThe  loan  proceeds  will  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs,\nexcluding  local  duties  and  taxes,  of  imports  procured  in  and  from\nADB  member  countries,  other  than  items  specified  in  the  ineligible\nlist  and  those  financed  by  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  official\nsources.  Procurement  of  eligible  items  under  ADB\u2019s  loan  will  be\nbased  on  normal  commercial  practices  for  procurement  by  the\nprivate  sector,  or  standard  Government  procurement  procedures\nacceptable to ADB for procurement by the public sector. In the case\n\n\fCounterpart\nFunds\n\nRisks and\nSafeguards\n\niv\n\nof  goods  commonly  traded  on  international  commodity  markets,\nprocurement  will  follow  procedures  appropriate  to  the  trade  and\nacceptable to ADB.\n\nThe Government will use counterpart funds generated by the loan to\n(i)  finance  additional  public  investment  costs  in  the  transport  and\npower  projects  to  ensure  strengthened  social  and  environmental\nsafeguards;  (ii)  build  institutional  capacity  to  plan,  design,  and\nenforce  environmental  and  social  safeguards;  (iii)  provide  local\ncounterpart resources for development projects aimed at river basin\nplanning  and  management;  (iv)  address  the  mitigation  costs  of\nexisting infrastructure where social and environment costs were not\nadequately addressed;  and (v) establish an environment fund.\n\nSustained  political  commitment  is  essential  to  effective  program\nimplementation.  A  risk  is  that  more  immediate  economic  problems,\nsuch  as  the  reemergence  of  regional  and  domestic  economic\ninstability,  could  divert  policy  makers\u2019  attention.  However,  ADB\nexperience  in  financing  energy  and  transport  projects  has  shown\nthat  major  social  and  environmental  risks  will  continue  to  be  the\nsubject  of  high-profile  attention  among  stakeholders.  Continued\ndialogue,  solid  analysis  of  the  longer  term  benefits  of  social\nsafeguards \nconsultative\nmechanisms  with  aid  agencies  and  civil  society,  and  public\nawareness  campaigns  are  built  into  the  Program  to  maintain\ncommitment.\n\nenvironmental  management, \n\nand \n\nIt can be expected that weak institutional capacity and limited human\nresources will handicap efforts to address environmental and social\nimpacts.  The  Program  therefore  reflects  an  incremental  approach\nthat is tailored to the realities of limited implementation capacity, and\nthe  need  to  introduce  policy  reforms  in  a  structured  and  sequential\nfashion.  The  Program  has  been  designed \nto  combine  both\nimmediate policy actions, where there is sufficient basis to proceed,\nand  flexibility  to  progressively  adapt  and  expand  initiatives  in\nresponse to increased information and lessons from implementation.\n\nEffective  environmental  management  and  rigorous  enforcement  of\nsocial  safeguards  will  require  continued  allocation  of  adequate\nresources across a wide spectrum of activities. To minimize the risk\nof insufficient resource allocation, the Program includes measures to\nstrengthen  compliance  monitoring,  reviews  of  longer  term  resource\nneeds  and  priority  setting,  a  range  of  measures  and  mechanisms\nfor  environmental\naimed  at  ensuring  sustainable \nmanagement,  and  the  priority  allocation  of  counterpart  funds  for\nProgram-related  activities.  Program  measures  to  track  environment\nallocations  in  the  annual  budgetary  process  will  allow  greater\ntransparency and enrich continued policy dialogue on this issue.\n\nfinance \n\n\f1.\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  a  proposed\nloan  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  for  the  Environment  and  Social\nProgram.\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nIn September 2000, the Government of the Lao PDR requested the Asian Development\nBank (ADB) to provide program assistance to strengthen social safeguards and environmental\nmanagement  in  the  energy  and  transport  sectors.  This  request  followed  a  process  of  policy\ndialogue  and  capacity  building  that  included  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)1  to  strengthen\ninstitutional  capacity  in  the  energy  and  transport  sectors  and  to  develop  strategies  and\nguidelines  for  improved  performance.  Subsequently,  a  small-scale  TA2  was  implemented\nbetween December 2000 and March 2001 to help the Government further develop the proposed\nenvironment and social program, including consultations with a wide range of stakeholders. The\nGovernment  informed  the  May  2001  Country  Programming  Mission  that  the  preliminary\nprogram  proposal  was  generally  acceptable  and  requested  that  the  proposed  Program  be\nprocessed  for  approval  in  2001.  The  Program  and  its  policy  matrix  were  further  developed\nduring  a  Fact-Finding  Mission  in  June  2001  and  confirmed  by  an  Appraisal  Mission3  in\nSeptember 2001.\n\nIII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT\n\nA.\n\nDevelopment Objectives, Strategy, and Plans\n\nin \n\nits  Strategies \n\nThe  Government\u2019s  development  priorities  are  presented \n\nfor\n3.\nSocioeconomic  Development  until  2020  and  5th  Five-Year  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan\n(2001-2005). The Government aims to reduce the proportion of poor families by more than half\nby 2005; to eradicate poverty and stop shifting cultivation by 2010; and to graduate from being a\nleast  developed  country  by  2020  by  transforming  a  mostly  subsistence  economy  to  a  natural\nresource-based industrialized economy. The strategy is to reduce poverty through sustainable\neconomic  growth  by  focusing  on  (i)  agriculture  and  forestry,  (ii)  education,  (iii)  health,  and  (iv)\nroad  infrastructure.  The  strategy  calls  for  greater  people\u2019s  participation  in  development\nprocesses and the gradual decentralization of Government responsibilities. Accelerated human\nand institutional developments are seen as prerequisites to realizing the development of goals.\nThe  Government  recognizes  that  governance  is  a  vital  link  between  economic  growth  and\npoverty reduction, and that environmental sustainability is a prerequisite to sustaining economic\ngrowth and reducing poverty.\n\n                                                \n1  TA  3133-LAO:  Strengthening Social and Environmental Management Project,  for  $950,000,  approved  on  22\n\n2  TA 3535-LAO: Energy and Transport Socio-Environmental Management, for $150,000, approved on 10 November\n\nDecember 1998.\n\n2000.\n\n3  The  Mission  comprised  N.  J.  Ahmad  (Senior  Policy  Coordinator,  ENVD/Mission  Leader);  S.  Chander  (Senior\nProject  Engineer,  IWEN);  S.  Lateef  (Senior  Social  Development  Specialist,  SOCD);  G-H  Kim  (Programs  Officer,\nPW3); R. O'Sullivan (Counsel, OGC); and A. Siddiq (Project Economist, AWFN).\n\n\f2\n\nB.\n\nRecent Economic Performance and Prospects\n\n4.\nMacroeconomic instability in 1997-1999, triggered by the regional crisis and exacerbated\nby  expansionary  fiscal  policies,  threatened  to  undermine  economic  development.  Foreign\ninvestment  inflows  and  Government  revenues  dropped  sharply  after  1997.  Tighter  fiscal  and\nmonetary  policies  from  mid-1999  helped  to  stabilize  the  economy  and,  despite  three  years  of\neconomic  instability,  economic  growth  averaged  6.2  percent  per  annum  during  the  last  five\nyears.  Annual  inflation  fell  from  128  percent  in  1999  to  less  than  10  percent  by  mid-2001.\nDespite recent improvement, average per capita income was only about $330 in 2000. The Lao\nPDR  and  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  entered  into  an  agreement  for  loan  financing\nunder IMF\u2019s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility in April 2001. Successful implementation of\nthe reforms agreed-upon under this facility will lay the foundation for greater economic stability,\nand more sustainable and equitable economic growth.\n\n5.\nThe  Government  targets  broad-based  economic  growth  of  7.0\u20137.5  percent  per  annum\nover the next five years. Past performance and regional experience suggest this is an ambitious\ntarget,  not  the  least  in  the  context  of  the  international  economic  slowdown.  In  the  longer  term\nsuch  growth  rates  may  be  achievable,  but  would  require  that  the  following  challenges  be\naddressed:  developing  a  competitive  and  open  market  economy,  improving  labor  productivity\nthrough  improved  health  and  education,  and  strengthening  the  capacity  to  deliver  more\nsustainable  benefits  from  the  management  of  natural  resources  and  the  environment.  Recent\ninitiatives  to  attenuate  policy,  institutional,  and  infrastructure  constraints  to  regional  integration\nprovide  improved  opportunities  for  investments  in  energy,  transport,  trade,  tourism,  and  other\nservices.  In  particular,  the  Lao  PDR  is  well  placed  to  develop  energy  as  a  major  source  of\nexport earnings due to its substantial hydropower resources and strategic location. To achieve\nnational  socioeconomic  development  goals  in  public  finance  and  investment  appropriate\nenvironmental  management  and  social  safeguards  can  help  attract  the  necessary  increased\ncommercial investments from established international investors.\n\nC.\n\nPublic Finance and Investment\n\n6.\nA major challenge in realizing development goals is the domestic resource constraints to\nfinancing  recurrent  and  development  expenditure.  Weaknesses  in  tax  collection,  public\nexpenditure planning and management, and reliance on official development assistance (ODA)\nfinancing  of  public  capital  expenditure  remain  problematic.  The  Government  recognizes  that  it\nwill need to attract increased private investment to help bridge the domestic investment-savings\ngap in financing its ambitious development agenda. This is particularly important because of the\nurgent  need  to  increase  the  share  of  current  spending  in  total  public  expenditure  so  as  to\nensure the sustainability of capital investments. This need for increased current expenditure is\nparticularly  evident  in  the  social  sectors,  and  also  for  environmental  management  purposes.\nThe  current  capital/current  expenditure  ratio  is  partly  the  result  of  a  very  high  dependence  on\nexternal financing of budget expenditure. The Government targets call for an increase in current\nexpenditure from 6.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1999 to more than 10 percent\nin 2003.\n\n7.\nProgram lending can assist in relieving the most pressing recurrent expenditure needs,\nbut the Government recognizes that the only sustainable solution is to increase public revenue.\nThe  external  financing  gap  is  currently  projected  at  about  $110 million  during FY2001/03.4\nGrowth  in  foreign  exchange  earnings  is  an  essential  element  of  the  Government's  efforts  to\n\n                                                \n4 Government of Lao PDR. 2001. Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy. 20 March.\n\n\f3\n\nreduce ODA dependence. Socially appropriate and environmentally sustainable investments in\ntransport  infrastructure  and  hydropower  generation  capacity  to  facilitate  the  development  of\ntrade, tourism, and hydropower exports are required to increase market opportunities and boost\nfiscal revenue in the medium term. To jointly address public finance concerns, the Government,\nADB,  IMF,  and  World  Bank  will  complete  a  public  expenditure  review  (PER)  in  late 2001  that\ncovers  the  poverty  focus  of  public  expenditures,  the  balance  between  recurrent  and  capital\nexpenditures  allocations,  fiscal  transparency,  and  mechanisms  for  expenditure  planning  and\nmanagement.  An  action  plan  will  be  developed \nthe  agreed-upon\nrecommendations  of  the  PER.  Given  that  provinces  account  for  about  30  percent  of  public\ninvestment, it will be important to improve efficiency by building capacity at this level, including\nintroducing  social  and  environmental  safeguards  in  provincial  planning,  implementation,  and\nmonitoring activities.\n\nimplement \n\nto \n\nD.\n\nThe Socioeconomic Setting\n\n8.\nThe  Lao  PDR  ranks  132nd  out  of  162  countries  according  to  the  United  Nations\nDevelopment Programme's (UNDP\u2019s) 2001 human development index. Poverty incidence in the\nLao  PDR  declined  from  45  percent  in  FY1992/93  to  39  percent  in  FY1997/98,  but  there  is\nconsiderable  disparity  in  poverty  incidence  across  regions  and  provinces  as  well  as  between\nurban and rural areas. The concentration of poor and ultrapoor households and communities is\nhighest in the northern provinces and lowest in Vientiane Municipality. The incidence of poverty\nis  greatest  among  communities  in  rural,  more  remote,  and  mountainous  areas.  While\nconsumption  inequality  is  less  than  that  in  many  other  Asian  countries,  it  has  increased\nmarkedly in the last five years. The Gini coefficient increased from 28.7 percent in FY1992/93 to\n34.3  percent  in  FY1997/98.  According  to  the  2001  participatory  poverty  assessment  (PPA),\npoverty  in  the  Lao  PDR  is  generally  linked  to  livelihood  systems,  including  agriculture  and\nforestry  production,  rural  infrastructure,  basic  education,  and  primary  health  care.  Most  of  the\npopulation  depend  directly  on  natural  resources  for  their  livelihood.  Poorer  communities  are\nespecially vulnerable to negative environmental and social impacts of large-scale infrastructure\ndevelopment  projects.  Improved  management  of  environmental  and  social  concerns  will  be\nessential to protect and improve the livelihoods of the poor and to increase the options available\nfor poverty reduction. This is important in an economy where a few large hydropower projects\nare  likely  to  dominate  export  earnings  and  budget  revenue,  but  will  create  relatively  few  jobs\ndirectly.\n\nIV. \n\nENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS IN\nENERGY AND TRANSPORT\n\nA.\n\nBackground\n\n1. \n\nEnvironment\n\nThe  Lao  PDR  has  a  land  area  of  236,800  square  kilometers  (km2),  bounded  by\n9.\nMyanmar  to  the  northwest,  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  to  the  north,  Viet  Nam  to  the  east,\nCambodia  to  the  south,  and  Thailand  to  the  west.  Two  main  physical  features,  rivers  and\nmountains,  dominate  the  topography,  and  their  interaction  accounts  for  most  of  the  country\u2019s\ngeographic,  biological,  and  social  variation.  A  total  of  1,865  km  of  the  4,000  km  long  Mekong\nRiver flows through the Lao PDR or along its border with Thailand. The Lao PDR contributes 26\npercent of the drainage area of the Mekong River and 40 percent of its water resources, thereby\n\n\f4\n\nmaking the country the largest single contributor of water to the Mekong River. The country also\nhas the largest per capita volume of freshwater at 66,000 cubic meters/person, which amounts\nto 20 times the regional average.\n\nA  broad  range  of  natural  systems  representing  many  vegetation  types  is  found  in  the\n10.\ncountry.  These  are  a  variety  of  forest  types,  grasslands,  water  bodies,  and  wetlands,  all  of\nwhich are habitats for a wide range of wildlife. Most of the indigenous vegetation in the Lao PDR\nis associated with forests. According to official data from the National Forest Inventory, forests\ncover  approximately  11.2  million  hectares,  or  47.2  percent  of  the  country.  The  dominant\nevergreen  forest  types  are  dry  or  semievergreen  forests  and  hill  evergreen  forests.  The\ndominant  forest  types  are  mixed  deciduous.  About  half  of  these  woodlands  \u2013  a  very  high\nproportion  \u2013  can  be  classified  as  primary  forest,  while  another  30  percent  or  so  represent\nsecondary growth. The Lao PDR ranks 11th in the world in terms of percentage of natural forest\ncover. However, deforestation is occurring at an annual rate of 0.6-0.8 percent.\n\n11.\nForests,  wetlands,  and  other  natural  areas  harbor  approximately  10,000  species  of\nanimals and vascular plants. Within Southeast Asia, the Lao PDR is second only to Cambodia\nin the number of species by land area. Twenty-five species found in the Lao PDR are globally\nendangered.  Most  of  the  fauna  belongs  to  the  Indochina  zoogeographic  realm.  In  terms  of\nfaunal  biodiversity,  the Wildlife  in  Lao  PDR:  1999  Status  Report  produced  by  the  World\nConservation  Union  (IUCN)  states  that  319  out  of  1,140  species  included  in  the  review  are\nsignificant for national or global conservation, i.e., 67 percent of the large mammals, 53 percent\nof the bats, 6 percent of the insectivora, 14 percent of the murid rodents, 22 percent of the birds,\n25  percent  of  the  reptiles,  and  2  percent  of  the  amphibians.  The  Lao  PDR  is  thought  to  have\nsome of the last populations of Javan rhinoceros, kouprey, and Siamese crocodiles in the world.\nThree large mammal species new to science were discovered in the Lao PDR and neighboring\nareas of Viet Nam in the past decade, an unparalleled event in modern science. The Lao PDR\nhas established 20 national biodiversity conservation areas (NBCAs) covering 13 percent of the\ncountry.\n\n12.\nThe  population  of  the  Lao  PDR  consists  of  some  48  distinct  ethnolinguistic  groups\ncomprising  three  main  groups  who  respectively  populate  the  lowlands,  the  medium  altitudes,\nand  the  more  remote  highlands  and  mountainous  areas.  Each  group  has  developed  a\nsignificant culture, knowledge, and experience that is tailored to the natural resources available\nto  them,  and  that  is  reflected  in  their  dominant  livelihood  systems.  These  groups  have  strong\nties to the land and natural resource base. Forests and rivers provide the rural people with food\nplants,  meat,  medicines,  fish,  resins,  building  materials,  and  other  products  for  domestic\nconsumption and income generation. These natural resources serve as buffer stocks in times of\nhousehold food insecurity, and when natural disasters occur.\n\nthe  Lao  PDR  confronting \n\nincreasing  environmental  and  natural  resource\n13. With \nmanagement issues that impact across all economic sectors, the Government has undertaken\nsome  important  policy  and  institutional  measures  to  bolster  its  capacity  to  manage  its  rich\nnatural  resources  in  a  sustainable  manner.  Several  laws  addressing  natural  resource  and\nenvironmental management issues have been passed in recent years: the Forestry Law (1996),\nthe Water and Water Resources Law (1996), the Land Law (1997), the Electricity Law (1997),\nthe  Mining  Law  (1997),  the  Road  Law  (1999)  and  the  Environment  Protection  Law  (EPL)\nadopted  in  1999.  These  laws  provide  the  foundations  to  better  protect  the  environment  and\npeople from the potential adverse impacts of economic development.  However, their effective\n\n\f5\n\nenforcement has been hampered to a large extent by the absence of implementing regulations\nand frameworks for implementation.\n\n14.\nThe  EPL  stipulates  the  fundamental  principles,  regulations,  and  measures  required  for\npreserving  and  managing  the  environment  as  well  as  for  the  efficient  and  sustainable  use  of\nnatural resources. The fundamental principles of the EPL include (i) emphasizing environmental\nconservation  before  mitigation  and  restoration,  (ii)  integrating  environmental  protection  into\nsocioeconomic development planning, (iii) requiring all persons and organizations to contribute\nto  environmental  protection,  (iv)  requiring  those  who  cause  damage  to  the  environment  to  be\nresponsible for mitigation and compensation, and (v) avoiding pollution and waste through the\ncareful  use  of  natural  resources.  The  EPL  also  foresees  the  establishment  of  an  environment\nprotection fund to finance environmental management activities.\n\n15.\nThe  EPL  assigns  to  the  Science,  Technology,  and  Environment  Agency  (STEA)  the\nmandate  to  monitor  and  coordinate  all  environment-related  actions.  STEA  coordinates  and\nsupervises  environmental  impact  assessments  (EIAs)  for  industrial,  agricultural,  forestry,  and\nhydropower  development.  STEA  also  prepares,  coordinates,  oversees,  and  monitors\nenvironmental  policies,  regulations,  and  guidelines,  and  the  preparation  and  dissemination  of\nenvironmental  information.  As  part  of  its  coordination  role,  STEA  houses  the  Water  Resource\nCoordinating  Committee  (WRCC)  and  provides  the  secretariat  for  the  Interministerial  Working\nGroup  on  Environment  (IMWGE).  The  WRCC,  formed  in  1998  with  STEA  as  chair,  is  tasked\nwith coordinating activities associated with the Water and Water Resources Law and includes\nall major ministries in its membership. The IMWGE is a mid-level group that meets occasionally\nto discuss technical issues related to environmental management.\n\n16.\nThe  mandate  of  the  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Handicrafts  (MIH)  covers  a  number  of\nsectors,  including  electricity,  geology,  mines,  and  industry  and  handicrafts.  MIH  is  responsible\nfor  (i)  administering  the  EIA  process  for  industry  sector  and  energy  sector  projects,  and  (ii)\nissuing  regulations  and  establishing  standards  for  wastewater  discharge,  air  emissions,  noise,\nand  industrial  waste.  The  Ministry  of  Communication,  Transport,  Post  and  Construction\n(MCTPC)  has  a  mandate  that  encompasses  urban  development  and  the  planning  and\nmanagement  of  transport  and  communication  infrastructure.  MCTPC  is  responsible  for\naddressing  environmental  management  and  social  concerns  in  infrastructure  planning  and\ndevelopment, and administers the associated EIA process.\n\n17.\nThe  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry  (MAF)  has  a  crucial  role  in  promoting  the\nsustainable  use  of  natural  resources  (soil,  forest,  water,  fish,  and  biodiversity)  for  rural\ndevelopment.  The  Ministry  of  Justice  has  wide-ranging  influence  in  preparing,  enforcing,  and\nmonitoring  all  laws,  decrees,  and  guidelines,  including  those  dealing  with  social  and\nenvironmental concerns. The Committee for Planning and Cooperation (CPC) is responsible for\nnational  planning  processes.  Augmenting  CPC\u2019s  role  are  the  National  Land  Use  and  Forest\nLand Allocation Committee, and the National Rural Development Committee. These committees\nhave  important  roles  in  involuntary  resettlement  and  compensation  procedures,  especially  in\nallocating land in upland areas.\n\n2. \n\nThe Energy Sector\n\n18.\nThe  Lao  PDR  has  a  technically  exploitable  hydropower  potential  of  about  18,000\nmegawatts (MW), of which 623 MW of generation capacity has been developed through seven\nhydropower  plants.  Public  investment  has  financed  the  development  of  263  MW, with two\n\n\f6\n\nindependent  power  producers  (IPPs),  Theun  Hinboun  (210  MW)  and  Houay  Ho  (150  MW),\naccounting  for  the  remainder.  The  country's  rich  hydropower  resource  endowment  already\nprovides  an  important  source  of  foreign  exchange  earnings  and  budget  revenue.  Annual\nGovernment  revenues  from  electricity  exports  are  expected  to  increase  from  $44.9  million  in\n2000  to  $136  million  in  2010.  However,  opportunities  for  tapping  the  remaining  potential  are\ntempered  by  the  emergence  of  competing  energy  sources  in  export  markets,  a  less  buoyant\ninvestment  climate,  and  legitimate  social  and  environmental  concerns  about  inappropriate\nhydropower  development.  The  Lao  PDR  has  one  of  the  lowest  levels  of  electrification  in  Asia\nwith only 30 percent of the population and 2 percent of rural households connected to the power\ngrid.  Low  domestic  tariff  rates  mean  that  export  sales  are  subsidizing  the  few,  mostly  urban,\ndomestic consumers who are connected to the power grid.\n\nOverall  responsibility  for  the  power  sector  is  vested  in  the  Department  of  Electricity\n19.\n(DOE) in MIH. Under the Electricity Law (approved 1997), DOE is responsible for preparing and\nimplementing  sector  legislation  and  regulations,  overseeing  the  performance  of  electricity\nenterprises, and for  formulating policies and strategic planning. Within DOE, the Hydro Power\nOffice (HPO) is responsible for strategic power planning, identifying projects, and evaluating IPP\nproject  proposals,  while  the  Rural  Electrification  Division  is  the  focal  unit  for  off-grid\nelectrification.  A  small  environmental  management  and  monitoring  unit  is  attached  to  HPO.\nElectricit\u00e9 du Lao (EdL), a state-owned corporation, develops, and partly owns and operates the\ncountry\u2019s  main  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  assets;  and  manages  electricity\nimports to its grids and exports from its stations. Responsibility for off-grid projects rests with the\nrelevant local authorities or concessionaires. The Lao National Committee for Energy manages\nthe  development  and  marketing  of  export  power  projects  and  negotiates  on  behalf  of  the\nGovernment. It monitors and reports on power sector issues. The Electricity Law requires that\nall  projects  greater  than  50  MW  be  approved  by  the  Government  and  the  National  Assembly,\nand  that  all  projects  between  2  and  50  MW  be  licensed  by  the  Government.  Smaller  projects\ncan be licensed by the relevant local authorities.\n\n20.\nEleven  major  hydropower  projects,  with  a  total  design  capacity  of  4,000  MW,  are  in  the\nplanning or advanced planning stage for implementation during the next 10 years. Eight projects\nare  expected  to  be  built  on  an  IPP/build-operate-transfer  basis.  The  total  capital  cost  of  the\ncurrently proposed IPP projects over the period to 2010 is about $5 billion in current prices, with\nanother  $350  million  required  to  develop  a  500-kilovolt  (kV)  line  to  Thailand.  However,  it  is\nunlikely that all projects will be implemented in the next decade. Preparations for the largest IPP,\nNam  Theun  2  (1,088  MW),  are  well  advanced  and  construction  is  expected  to  be  completed  in\n2006. EdL plans to develop four of the smaller projects.\n\n3. \n\nThe Transport Sector\n\nRoad transport development has absorbed a large share of public investment and ODA\n21.\nexpenditure  during  the  last  decade.  Progress  in  expanding  transport  infrastructure  has\nfacilitated  all-weather  road  access  for  most  of  the  north-south  corridor  of  the  country.  The\ncountry has 26,000 km of roads. However, only 4,600 km of the roads are all-weather routes, of\nwhich 2,400 km are paved. Only half the national roads are paved, most provincial roads remain\nunpaved,  and  many  provincial  roads  are  impassable  during  the  rainy  season.  Most  rural\ncommunities  do  not  have  year-round  road  access  to  markets.  Poor  transport  infrastructure\nremains a constraint to poverty reduction and economic development.\n\n\f7\n\nResponsibility  for  transport  planning  and  regulation  in  the  Lao  PDR  rests  with  the\n22.\nMCTPC.  The  organization  and  activities  of  MCTPC  are  defined  in  Decree  66/PM  (12  May\n1999).  The  Road  Law,  approved  by  the  National  Assembly  in  April  1999,  provides  the  legal\nframework for road sector development and assigns MCTPC responsibility to manage land for\nroad  development  as  stipulated  in  the  Land  Law.  MCTPC  works  with  CPC  and  STEA  in\ndeveloping transport strategies and investment plans. Within MCTPC, the Department of Roads\n(DOR)  is  responsible  for  road  transport  development.  Responsibilities  for  social  and\nenvironmental  mitigation  activities  in  the  road  sector  currently  rest  with  a  small  environmental\nmanagement  and  monitoring  unit  in  an  administrative  division  of  DOR.  During  the  last  five\nyears,  MCTPC  has  delegated  some  responsibilities  to  provincial  level  departments  of\ncommunication,  transport  post  and  construction  (DCTPC)  so  as  to  increase  local  participation\nand a sense of ownership.\n\n23.\nThe development and improved maintenance of road transport infrastructure are the main\nelements of the Government  strategies to increase rural access to market opportunities, and to\nincreased national and regional economic integration. MCTPC estimates that it will require $90\nmillion  per  annum  over  the  next  10  years  to  fund  road  sector  development  and  maintenance.\nAnnual  funding  for  the  next  five  years  is  directed  toward  (i)  routine  and  periodic  maintenance\n($11.5  million  per  year);  (ii)  rehabilitation  of  secondary  roads  and  three  national  roads  (route\n13N  from  Phonhong  to  Pakmong,  route  13S  from  Paksan  to  Savannakhet,  and  route  6)  and\nstrategic national roads linking population centers ($6.6 million per year); (iii) development of all-\nweather links to all provincial capitals and national roads providing regional, cross-border links\n($47.6  million  per  year);  (iv)  priority  secondary  and  rural  roads  to  provide  all-weather  access\nbetween district centers and  the national network and other priority projects ($16.6 million per\nyear); (v) Mekong bridge crossing ($5 million per year); and Vientiane City roads ($2.8 million\nper year). This ambitious transport development program is not fully funded.\n\nB.\n\nEnvironmental Management and Social Safeguard Issues and Constraints\n\n1.\n\nIssues\n\n24.\nNatural  resources  play  a  central  role  in  the  economy  of  the  Lao  PDR.  Forestry\ncontributes  7-10  percent  of  GDP  and  is  the  only  major  agricultural  export.  Water  resources\n(through  hydropower  generation)  now  account  for  an  important  share  of  foreign  exchange\nearnings. Hydropower export earnings are expected to remain a major source of growth in the\nfiscal  revenues  needed  to  fund  service  delivery  and  basic  infrastructure  to  improve  health,\neducation, and other social services. Rural access roads, designed with appropriate safeguards\nand  nested  within  integrated  rural  development  strategies,  can  promote  resource-based\neconomic  development  and  reduce  poverty.  They  can  simultaneously  decrease  pressure  on\nnatural resources by providing access to markets, services, and technology that allow farmers\nto intensify agriculture and turn away from sometimes destructive shifting cultivation practices.\nAppropriately  designed  roads  can  also  provide  opportunities  for  ecotourism  development,\nincluding access to NBCAs for tourists whose user fees can contribute to their protection.\n\nThe quality and productivity of the natural resource base is also vital to the well-being of\n25.\nrural communities, which account for 85 percent of the country\u2019s population. Forests and rivers\nprovide rural people with food plants, meat, medicines, fish, resins, building materials, and other\nproducts  for  home  consumption  and  income  generation.  Fish  harvested  from  rivers  and  other\nwetlands provide a significant proportion of total animal protein consumed in the country. These\nnatural \u201call-purpose shops\u201d serve a vital social security function, especially during times of rice\n\n\f8\n\ndeficit and when natural calamities decimate agricultural harvests. For many rural households,\naccess to these resources can mean the difference between maintaining their homes and being\nforced to move to new lands or urban areas.\n\nExperience  in  the  Lao  PDR  confirms  that  road  and  hydropower  projects  can  pose\n26.\nsubstantial environmental and social risks. Many such risks are associated with direct impacts\nin the projects\u2019 zones of influence that result from decisions regarding project location, design,\nand  construction  activities.  Such  impacts  are  in  principle  identifiable,  if  not  always  easily\navoided  or  mitigated.  Risks  include  loss  of  forest  cover;  changes  in  hydrological  regimes,\ndeterioration in water quality, and loss of fisheries; degraded agricultural land due to riverbank\nerosion  or  displacement  by  alternative  development;  and  involuntary  resettlement,  social\ndislocation, and impingement on rural livelihood systems.\n\n27.\nIndirect impacts during project implementation are similar, but often more insidious and\nlonger term in nature. They may include widespread environmental degradation, including loss\nof watershed cover and a collapse of river ecology. Profound changes to community health and\ncultural traditions may be induced due to new or improved access to previously isolated areas:\nincreased  illegal  trafficking  in  women  and  children;  spread  of  infectious  diseases  such  as\nsexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including HIV/AIDS;5 and unplanned development and in-\nmigration that displace, marginalize, or impoverish existing communities.\n\n28. Where environmental and social impacts are not foreseen and addressed appropriately,\nthe outcomes can undermine national development goals and contribute to increased economic\nand social hardship among the affected populations. Populations most affected by hydropower\nand  roads  developments  are  often  subsistence  ethnic  minority  communities  living  in  the  least\naccessible  parts  of  the  country.  They  often  have  little  capacity  to  cope  with  potential  adverse\nimpacts that large infrastructure projects can have on production, productive assets and income\nsources;  community  structures,  social  networks,  and  cultural  identity.  Infrastructure  projects\ndisperse kin and other mutual support groups; and introduce new diseases and/or aggravating\nendemic diseases such  as malaria,  dysentery, and measles. Given the fragile nature of these\ncommunities and the resources on which they depend, even minor impacts can result in severe\nand long-term economic and social hardships that exacerbate their impoverishment.\n\n29.\nThe  recently  conducted  PPA  identified  relocation  due  to  development  projects  as  a\ndirect  cause  of  poverty  in  some  communities.  The  Houay  Ho  project  is  one  example  of  a\ncompleted  hydropower  project  with  no  resettlement  plan,  resulting  in  people  suffering  from  a\nsevere  shortage  of  food  and  arable  land,  and  insufficient  water  supply.  Remedial  action  to\nalleviate the most pressing hardships was finally undertaken in 1999 at an approximate cost of\n$2.4 million.6 Likewise, the ADB-financed Theun-Hinboun Hydropower Project7 has decreased\nfisheries  and  fundamentally  changed  water  regimes,  thereby  affecting  the  capability  of  about\n3,000  households  to  maintain  their  pre-project  livelihoods.  Late  mitigation  can  be  costly,  as\nevidenced  by  the  $5  million  budget  required  for  the  new  Theun-Hinboun  mitigation  plan.  The\ncosts  of  fishery  and  terrestrial  habitat  loss  in  the  Nam  Kading  NBCA  downstream  of  the  dam\nhave yet to be fully assessed.\n\n30.\nThe  problems  associated  with  previous  hydropower  development  projects  must  be\navoided  in  the  future.  Reactive  responses  to  correct  problems  are  not  in  the  national  interest.\n\n                                                \n5  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\n6 World Bank Hydropower Development Strategy Study, Volume D.\n7 Loan 1329-LAO, for $60 million, approved on 8 November 1994.\n\n\f9\n\nUnless  measures  are  carefully  planned  and  implemented,  poverty  reduction  efforts  will  be\nnegated and the Government risks not meeting its goal of halving the level of poverty incidence\nby  the  year  2005.  Conversely,  potential  contributions  of  infrastructure  development  toward\nimproving livelihoods, increasing market access, extending the delivery of social services, and\ngenerally stimulating economic development will be lost. In today\u2019s investment climate, failure to\ndemonstrate  an  overall  framework  and  capacity  to  manage  social  and  environmental  impacts\nwill  deter  much-needed  external  financing  by  private  sector  interests  as  well  as  bilateral  and\nmultilateral sources.\n\n31.\nThere  are  also  regional  and  international  dimensions  to  these  risks.  The  way  natural\nresources  are  used  in  the  Lao  PDR  can  have  strong  ripple  effects  in  neighboring  countries.\nThailand  now  imports  2,682  gigawatt-hours  (GWh)  of  power  from  the  Lao  PDR  and\nunderstandings has been reached for future imports requiring an additional generating capacity\nof 1,500\u20133,300 MW. Cambodia and Viet Nam rely on the Lao PDR to protect its rivers, fisheries,\nand  forested  uplands  from  development  activities  that  could  profound  by  impact  on  the  diet,\ncommerce,  and  safety  of  large  downstream  populations.  Plans  to  develop  ecotourism  in  the\nGreater  Mekong  subregion  will  fall  short  of  expectations  if  the  country  is  unable  to  attract\ntourists  due  to  degraded  landscapes  and  decreasing  wildlife.  At  an  international  level,  Lao\nPDR\u2019s  stewardship  of  internationally  endangered  species  and  biodiversity  conservation  are\ncentral to global environmental objectives. Emerging concerns are also being expressed about\nthe  potential  incremental  emission  of  greenhouse  gases  from  reservoirs  due  to  rotting\nvegetation and carbon inflows from the catchments.\n\n32.\nIndications  of  the  magnitude  of  potential  problems  are  detailed  in  the  Lao  PDR\nhydropower  development  strategy  which  estimated  that  16  of  the  30  potential  hydropower\ndevelopment  sites  would  affect  NBCAs  and/or  areas  of  significant  biodiversity  value.  If\nimplemented,  projects  would  affect  varying  numbers  of  people.  Together,  the  projects  could\ninvolve  the  relocation  of  33,000  people.  Transmission  lines,  access  roads,  or  construction\nactivities could affect another 14,000 people. Another 390,000 people downstream, and another\n190,000  upstream  in  immediate  catchment  areas  could  also  be  affected  (footnote  5).  The\nhydropower strategy study estimates that the total cost of social and environmental impacts for\nthese projects could be between $770 million and $2.8 billion, depending on the standards that\nare followed. While few of the 30 potential sites may be developed within the foreseeable future,\nand many will never be developed, the estimates from the study are illustrative.\n\n33.\nRoad  transport  sector  development  plans  call  for  some  $734  million  to  be  invested  in\ndeveloping and maintaining the road network over the next 10 years. Past experience with road\ndevelopment in the Lao PDR suggests that, without substantial improvements in planning and\nmitigation  measures  to  address  environmental  and  social  concerns,  the  potential  social  and\nenvironmental  impacts  of  future  road  developments  are  likely  to  be  significant.  Without\nimproved safeguards, there are strong risks of increased erosion, illegal logging, deforestation,\nand  biodiversity  losses,  and  there  will  be  inadequate  safeguards  for  persons  or  communities\nadversely  affected  by  road  development.  Failure  to  implement  improved  planning,  public\nconsultations,  environmental  management,  and  social  safeguards  in  the  road  sector  would\nmean that potential synergies in public investment will be lost, and potential benefits, especially\nin terms of reducing poverty and increasing economic opportunities, will not be fully realized.\n\nA  river  basin  planning  approach  will  allow  policy  makers  to  optimize  the  benefits  of\n34.\nnatural resource management within the whole basin\u2014from upper watersheds that are prone to\nerosion,  to  lower  plains  that   are  affected  by  frequent  floods. In  the  longer term,  such  an\n\n\f10\n\nintegrated  approach  will  yield  considerable  benefits  by  facilitating  sustainable  watershed\nmanagement  and  soil  conservation,  flood  protection  and  mitigation,  fisheries  preservation  and\ndevelopment, and irrigation development.  Resource management in these subsectors has not\nbeen  optimized  in  the  past  due  mainly  to  lack  of  a  legal  framework  that  will  govern  the  water\nrights  and  allocations  to  different  sectors,  and  the  unclear  delineation  of  roles  and\nresponsibilities  of  relevant  line  agencies.  Lack  of  integrated  area-based  planning  in  the  Lao\nPDR has also affected development in the power sector. A recently completed study8 indicates\nthat  uncoordinated  development  may  have  hampered  growth  and  resulted  in  delays  in\nhydropower  development.  As  one  immediate  component  of  an  eventual  river  basin  approach,\nimproved management of the watersheds that cover 80 percent of the country will be vital to the\nsuccess  of  planned  and  current  hydropower  projects.  Area-based  planning  activities  in  critical\nwatersheds will also be needed to ensure that potential direct and indirect impacts of rural roads\ndevelopment can be avoided or managed.\n\n2.\n\nConstraints\n\na. \n\nIncomplete Policy and Regulatory Framework\n\nThe  Government  has  taken  important  steps  toward  a  comprehensive  framework  for\n35.\nenvironmental  management  and  social  safeguards  by  adopting \nin  1999.\nNotwithstanding  the  progress  made,  in  the  absence  of  the  relevant  enabling  decrees  and\nsectoral implementing regulations to underpin stated policies on the environment, Government\nagencies  and  others  can  be  presented  from  ensuring  that  social  and  environmental\nconsiderations  are  properly  addressed  by  developers  and  contractors  of  major  infrastructure\nprojects.  The  overall  framework  needs  further  strengthening  so  that  roles,  functions,  and\nresponsibilities are clear; regulations, standards, and procedures are articulated; and necessary\nbudgetary  and  human  resources  are  allocated  to  address  these  concerns.  Limited  capacity\nneeds to be used more efficiently and effectively through better interministerial coordination and\ndivision of labor, as well as through enhanced coordination of external support to environmental\nprograms.\n\nthe  EPL \n\n36.\nThe  Government  is  aware  that  it  must  address  gaps  in  involuntary  resettlement  and\ncompensation  policies  for  major  projects.  Currently,  no  national  policy  exists  that  articulates\nuniform  standards,  although  the  fundamental  principles  of  protecting  affected  people,  the\npayment of compensation, and restoration of livelihoods are enshrined in the Constitution and\nother  laws.  However,  none  of  these  laws  deals  coherently  and  systematically  with  the  entire\nprocess  of  resettlement  and  compensation,  or  assigns  oversight  responsibility  to  any\nGovernment  agency  or  institution.  Consequently,  social  and  resettlement  impacts  are\naddressed  either  as  salvage  operations,  or  at  best,  in  an  ad  hoc  and  unplanned  manner.\nPlanning, managing, and monitoring social impacts remain a secondary, low-priority, side-effect\nof  infrastructure  development.  A  significant  barrier  to  making  the  transition  from  project-by-\nproject  reactive  responses  to  well-planned  proactive  interventions  is  the  lack  of  a  clear  policy\nand institutional framework for mitigating and managing adverse social impacts. Without such a\npolicy the Government risks not meeting the safeguard provisions in their own policies and the\ninternational standards required to attract external financing and to foster investor confidence.\n\n37.\nRecognition and support for public involvement and participation are contained in all key\nlegislation. The EPL has a specific provision on the need to consult with project-affected people\nin the EIA process. Yet, a clear Government policy that provides the framework for the conduct\n\n                                                \n8 TA 3374-LAO: Power Sector Strategy Study. Draft final report, August 2001.\n\n\f11\n\nof public consultations is absent. Without a policy framework that codifies the adoption of public\ninvolvement  and  participation,  directives  contained  in  other  legislation  will  remain  unrealized.\nProjects  will  continue  to  be  developed  and  implemented  without  proper  consultation  and\nparticipation  of  affected  communities  in  decisions  relating  to  their  social  and  economic  well-\nbeing.  A  pressing  constraint  to  the  development  of  appropriate  and  culturally  suitable\ndevelopment  projects  and  mitigation  packages  for  large  infrastructure  projects  is  the  lack  of\nunderstanding  and  knowledge  about  the  needs,  priorities,  and  willingness  and  capacity  of\naffected  communities  to  adapt  to  new  economic  conditions  and  physical  environments.  In  the\nabsence  of  institutionalized  processes  for  consultation  and  participation  of  stakeholders,\nincluding affected communities, proper planning, implementation, and monitoring of projects will\nnot be achieved.\n\nb. \n\nWeak Capacity at Sector and Subnational Levels\n\n38. Weak  or  nonexistent  capacity  for  social  and  environmental  protection  is  a  reality  in  all\ndevelopment  sectors.  The  situation  needs  urgent  improvement,  especially  in  the  hard  sectors\nwhere  the  scope  and  magnitude  of  impacts  are  wide-ranging,  significant,  and  sometimes\nirreversible. In addition to creating direct impacts on the environment and people's lives, major\ninfrastructure  projects  can  alter  the  dynamics  of  natural  resource  management  and  livelihood\nsystems at a local level and can have a profound influence on the spatial patterns of agricultural\nand  rural  development.  Generally,  mechanisms  for  integrating  the  environment  into  strategic\nplanning  are  absent,  procedures  are  not  clear,  guidelines  not  formalized,  and  criteria  not\ndisclosed. The relevant line agencies have neither formally adopted sector-specific regulations\nnor issued guidelines. They also lack the corresponding institutional arrangements to coherently\naddress the issues from a project-specific, let alone strategic planning, perspective.\n\n39.\nIn  the  energy  and  transport  sectors  specifically,  some  progress  has  been  made  in  EIA\ntraining and the drafting of EIA guidelines, and practical experience has been gained in working\nwith multilateral financed projects. Technical assistance has been useful, although it has been\nfragmented and not always tailored precisely to meet institutional needs. Against this backdrop,\nMIH and MCTPC continue to deal with environmental and social concerns on a reactive and ad\nhoc basis depending on the specific due diligence requirements, if any, of the private sector and\naid  agencies.  Sector-specific  ministerial  guidance  on  project-related  involuntary  resettlement\nand  compensation  is  absent,  and  public  involvement  procedures  are  lacking.  Although\nrudimentary  environment  units  have  been  established  within  the  two  ministries  and  are\nbeginning  to  play  a  useful  role,  they  are  not  yet  equipped  with  the  relevant  institutional\nmandates, appropriate human resources, and necessary budget to perform an adequate job.\n\n40. While  more  effective  institutional  arrangements  for  environmental  policy  and  regulation\nwill  continue  to  be  needed  at  the  central  level,  the  absence  of  fully  functioning  provincial  and\ndistrict institutions is a cause for concern. The EPL assigns to agencies at subnational level a\nsubstantial role in managing the environment and in enforcing safeguards; however, under the\nGovernment's  decentralization  strategy,  provincial  agencies  are  called  upon  to  perform  a\nnumber  of  mandates,  and  provincial  budgetary  processes  have  not  tended  to  favor\nenvironmental  regulatory  functions  over  other  competing  priorities.  As  a  result,  provincial\nscience, technology, and environment offices (STEOs) have been created in several provinces,\nbut  are  not  in  a  position  to  discharge  their  responsibilities  under  the  EPL.  One  such\nresponsibility  is  preparing  of  provincial  environmental  action  plans,  which  could  provide  a\nreasoned  and  credible  basis  for  prioritizing  tasks  and  allocating resources across agencies\n\n\f12\n\nconcerned with environmental management. In addition, the functional linkages and distribution\nof tasks between STEA and the STEOs need to be further clarified.\n\nc.\n\nInsufficient Compliance and Enforcement\n\n41.\nThere is a need to promote compliance with and enforcement of the EPL and other laws\nwith provisions for environmental management. Lack of awareness among civil society and the\nGovernment  of  environmental  and  social  safeguards  embodied  in  the  law  is  one  fundamental\nconstraint.  A  related  constraint  is  lack  of  codification  and  knowledge  of  legal  mandates  and\nimplications of the EPL; legal recourse for enforcement and compliance; and civil and criminal\nsanctions such as warnings, fines, revocation of licenses, civil sanctions, and criminal charges.\n\nIn  the  energy  and  transport  sectors,  measures  are  needed  to  enhance  transparency,\n42.\npredictability,  accountability,  oversight,  and  control.  The  adoption  and  application  of  sectoral\nregulations  and  guidelines  on  EIA,  involuntary  resettlement  and  compensation,  and  public\ninvolvement will be necessary, but not sufficient conditions. MIH and MCTPC need to ensure a\nsatisfactory  compliance  record  in  their  respective  sectors.  Neither  agency  currently  tracks\ncompliance  on  a  systematic  basis,  nor  issues  sector  compliance  reports.  In  response  to  the\nrequirements of project financiers, the Government has on occasion accepted third-party project\nmonitoring  arrangements.  These  arrangements  have  been  tested  in  the  case  of  the  World\nBank-supported  Nam  Theun  2  Hydropower  Project,  the  ADB-financed  Nam  Leuk  Hydropower\nProject,  and  the  recently  approved  Rural  Access  Roads  Project.9  However,  the  Government\ncurrently  lacks  an  established  system  and  procedures  for  third-party  monitoring  that  would  be\nrequired  for  all  sensitive  projects.  The  Government  could  also  usefully  explore  new  and\ninnovative ways of achieving compliance. One option is the use of performance bonds that will\nbe an incentive for developers and contractors to implement environmental and social mitigation\nmeasures and will provide insurance in the event of noncompliance.\n\nd.\n\nNeed for Integrated Resource Management Approaches\n\n43. With few exceptions, road and hydropower projects to date have been designed within a\nrelatively  limited  definition  of  \u201cproject  zone  of  influence.\u201d  For  roads,  this  has  normally  meant  a\nnarrow band between major nodal points corresponding to larger settlements. For hydropower\nprojects,  it  has  been  restricted  to  the  area  of  project  works,  sometimes  extending  to  the\nimmediate  upstream  and  downstream  river  environs.  Roads  and  energy  sector  plans  and\nprojects  need  to  be  situated  within  a  broader  area-based  planning  context,  if  cumulative  and\nsynergistic  impacts  are  to  be  adequately  addressed,  and  if  trade-offs  are  to  be  appropriately\nmanaged.  The  Government  has  yet  to  fully  adopt  a  holistic  area-based  planning  and\nmanagement approach to ensure the best use of land and water resources.\n\nAn integrated resource management approach is desirable to promote awareness of the\n44.\nlinks  between  water  and  land  use,  the  environment  and  sustainable  development.  The\nGovernment's initiatives to introduce this approach have been assisted by ADB through several\nTAs leading to the preparation of the Water Law and elaboration of issues relevant to river basin\nplanning  and  management.  Consultations  with  the  stakeholders  have  helped  the  Government\ndevelop  the  National  Water  Sector  Profile  and  Water  Sector  Strategy  and  Action  Plan\n(WSSAP).  The  WSSAP  addresses  cross-sectoral  issues  by  emphasizing  appropriate  policy,\ncommunity  education,  and  data  management.  As  a  first  step  toward  building  capacity  to\n\n                                                \n9 Loan 1456-LAO: Nam Leuk Hydropower Project, for $52 million, approved on 10 September 1996; and Loan 1795-\n\nLAO: Rural Access Roads Project, for $25 million, approved on 7 December 2000.\n\n\f13\n\nimplement  its  new  policies  and  plans,  the  Government  established  the  Water  Resources\nCoordinating Committee in February 1998.10 The Government has been implementing the most\nimportant  elements  of  the  WSSAP  through  policy  development,11  and  has  already  prepared  a\ndraft water policy. The upper Nam Ngum watershed area has also been studied in detail, and\ndraft policies and investment proposals for expanded development opportunities and enhanced\nenvironmental  mitigation  efforts  have  been  prepared.12  Under  the  ongoing  project  preparatory\nTA  for  Nam  Ngum  River  Basin  Development,13  the  river  basin  profile,  a  river  basin  action\nagenda, and a medium-term investment strategy and plan for the river basin will be prepared.\nThe  proposed  project  will  include  investment  components  relating  to  sustainable  soil\nconservation and fisheries development, integrated irrigation management, and flood control.\n\n45.\nThe  Government  has  made  steady  progress  in  water  sector  reforms  since  1997  by  (i)\ncarrying out a sector study, (ii) adopting the Water and Water Resources Law; (iii) establishing\nthe WRCC as a water sector apex body, and (iv) initiating the formulation of a water policy and\na draft implementing decree. A critical next step is to issue the decree to implement the Water\nLaw, which will clarify agency responsibilities and formalize the river basin planning approach.\nIn  view  of  the  capacity  constraints,  the  Government  recognizes  that  further  sector  reforms\nshould  be  implemented  progressively  under  an  integrated  resource  management  approach  in\nthe country's most important river basins, starting gradually with the Nam Ngum river basin and\nother  basins  where  hydropower  might  come  onstream.  In  the  short  to  medium  term,  the\nGovernment  will  simultaneously  pursue  area-based  planning  and  watershed  management\nactivities consistent with an overall river basin approach.\n\ne.\n\nLack of Sustainable Financing\n\n46.\nA  continuing  constraint  to  implementing  the  country\u2019s  development  strategy  is  poor\ndomestic  resource  mobilization  and  utilization.  Budget  revenues  are  low  as  a  percentage  of\nGDP and, despite recent improvements, weaknesses remain in public investment planning and\npublic  expenditure  management.  These  constraints,  coupled  with  a  high  dependence  on\nexternal  assistance,  have  resulted  in  inordinate  imbalances  between  current  and  capital\nexpenditure.  Limited  availability  of  current  budget  resources  constrain  social  service  delivery,\nand means that public infrastructure is often underutilized and poorly maintained. Compounding\nthese  problems  is  the  lack  of  systematic  incorporation  of  environmental  management\nconsiderations  in  sector  planning,  public  investment  planning,  and  public  expenditure\nmonitoring.  Appropriate  planning  to  address  environmental  concerns  is  constrained  by  lack  of\ninformation  on  national  and  provincial-level  spending  on  the  environment.  Given  the  limited\nresources  and  a  growing  focus  on  allocating  limited  public  resources  to  human  development\nand  poverty  reduction,  the  Government  wants  to  attract  increased  private  sector  financing  for\nhydropower  and  transport  sector  development.  Recent  economic  difficulties  and  institutional\nweaknesses  leave  policy  makers  especially  vulnerable  to  pressures  to  accept  investment\narrangements  that  may  be  suboptimal  in  terms  of  long-term  sustainable  development.\nProcedural  and  regulatory  reforms,  combined  with  capacity  building  and  human  resource\ndevelopment,  are  required  to  mitigate  these  risks.  However,  lack  of  adequate  financial\nresources  for  critical  environmental  management  and  regulatory  tasks  will  constrain  the\nintroduction  and  enforcement  of  environmental  management  and  social  safeguards.  The\n\n                                                \n10 TA  3006-LAO:  Institutional  Strengthening  for  the  Water  Resources  Coordination  Committee,  for  $260,000,\n\napproved in o5 April 1998.\n\n11 TA 3205-LAO: Implementation of the Water Sector Action Plan, for $300,000, approved on 9 June 1999.\n12 TA 2734-LAO: Nam Ngum Watershed Management, for $800,000, approved on 23 December 1996.\n13 TA 3544-LAO: Nam Ngum River Basin Development, for $850,000, approved on 14 November 2000.\n\n\f14\n\nGovernment recognizes that establishment of an environment fund as contemplated under the\nEPL can provide a predictable source of finance for priority environment actions.\n\nC.\n\nGovernment Objectives and Strategy\n\nThe  Government's  overall  environment  strategy \n\n47.\nthe  National\nEnvironment  Action  Plan  (NEAP).  First  adopted  by  the  Government  in  1994,  the  NEAP  was\nupdated with ADB assistance (footnote 1) in 2000 after a consultation process that incorporated\nthe  views  of  national  and  local  stakeholders.  NEAP  2000  provides  a  guide  to  STEA,  sector\ndevelopment  agencies,  and  others  at  the  central  and  local  levels  for  taking  actions  that  foster\nsustainable development. It highlights priorities for environmental protection during 2001-2005:\n(i)  strengthening  the  policy  and  institutional  framework;  (ii)  improving  capacity  within  sectoral\nand subnational agencies; (iii) issuing environmental quality standards on water, air, and land;\nand (iv) capacity building and training.\n\nis  presented \n\nin \n\n48.\nIn  the  energy  sector,  the  Government  aims  to  accelerate  power  development  and\nsubstantially increase power exports. The Government's Power Sector Policy Statement (March\n2001) sets out two overall goals: (i) promote economic and social development by providing an\naffordable,  reliable,  and  sustainable  electricity  supply;  and  (ii)  promote  power  generation  for\nexport  as  an  additional  revenue  base  for  meeting  development  objectives.  To  achieve  these\ngoals the Government intends to reform the legal and regulatory framework to facilitate power\ndevelopment,  and  optimize  the  institutional  structures  so  as  to  clarify  responsibilities  and\nstreamline  administration.  The  Government's  Strategic  Directions  for  the  Development  of  the\nRoad Sector (June 2000) sets out the long-term goals of MCTPC, together with objectives and\nstrategies  over  the  period  2000-2015.  The  main  objectives  concern  (i)  poverty  reduction,  (ii)\ngood  governance,  (iii)  private  sector  participation,  (iv)  regional  transport  network,  (v)  financial\nsustainability, and (vi) minimizing environmental and social impacts.\n\nD.\n\nExternal Assistance\n\n49.\nExternal assistance has financed about 80 percent of public investment in recent years.\nMost  funding  agencies  have  addressed  environmental  management  and  social  safeguard\nissues as an integral part of broader development activities. ADB, Global Environment Facility,\nUNDP,  United  Nations  Environment  Programme  (UNEP),  Australia,  Denmark,  Germany,\nNorway,  and  Sweden  are  supporting  and/or  planning  technical  assistance  to  improve  the\ninstitutional,  policy,  and  regulatory  framework  for  environmental  protection,  as  well  as  to\nenhance  implementation  capacity  at  central,  sectoral,  and  provincial  levels  (Appendix  1).  The\nWorld  Bank,  Finland,  Sweden,  and  the  European  Commission  (EC)  have  been  active  in  the\nforestry  sector.  Several  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  such  as  IUCN  and  the  World\nWildlife  Fund,  are  supporting  environmental  conservation,  raising  public  awareness  of\nenvironmental  issues,  and  helping  monitor  and  identify  adverse  impacts  of  development\nprojects. Denmark, Norway, and Sweden are expected to continue to support the strengthening\nof  central  and  provincial  institutions  responsible  for  planning  and  enforcing  social  and\nenvironmental safeguards, and thereby contribute to program implementation.\n\n50.\nThe transport sector has absorbed a large share of ODA in recent decades, receiving 56\npercent  of  all  ODA  between  1996  and  2000.  Major  external  development  partners  in  the\ntransport  sector  are  ADB,  Australia,  Germany,  Japan,  Sweden,  UNDP/United  Nations  Capital\nDevelopment  Fund,  and  World  Bank.  External  assistance  for  transport  has  been  directed\ntoward  road  development  and  maintenance,  plus  development  of  some  airports. ADB  has\n\n\f15\n\nplayed  a  leading  role  in  supporting  Government  efforts  to  improve  subregional  transport\nlinkages. Most aid agencies have addressed resettlement, social, and environmental issues as\npart of transport development projects, but there has been little progress toward developing and\nimplementing national standards for transport development.\n\n51.\nADB  has  been  the  major  multilateral  funding  agency  in  the  energy  sector,  supporting\ninstitutional  development,  subregional  cooperation,  private  investment,  power  generation  and\ndistribution, and rural electrification. UNDP and Australia have been working with DOE of MIH\nand EdL to improve social and environmental safeguards in the power sector. The World Bank\nis  involved  in  rural  electrification  in  the  southern  provinces  and  the  preparation  of  the  Nam\nTheun  2  Hydropower  Project.  International  private  developers  are  actively  involved  in  energy\nsector development, and NGOs are active in raising awareness of the social and environmental\nimplications of hydropower developments.\n\nE.\n\nADB\u2019s Country and Sector Strategies\n\n1.\n\nPast Operations and Strategy\n\n52.\nADB\u2019s involvement in the energy and transport sectors in the Lao PDR spans 30 years\nduring  which  it  extended  some  22  loans  and  funded  45  TA  projects.  Energy  and  transport\nsectors together have accounted for 60 percent of project lending and about 30 percent of TAs\nsince  ADB  started  country  operations  in  1968.  Both  sectors  remain  high  priorities  to  achieve\nsustainable pro-poor economic growth, and remain a major focus of ADB operations.\n\n53.\nIn the energy sector, ADB-financed power sector projects have contributed to increases\nin budget revenue and foreign exchange earnings. ADB support has also played a catalytic role\nin attracting additional private financing and cofinancing. The sector strategy will entail support\nto the Government's efforts to (i) develop capacity to manage power sector development in an\nenvironmentally  sustainable  and  socially  conducive  manner;  (ii)  support  the  rationalization  of\ntariff structures; (iii) develop hydropower projects, where technically and financially feasible, for\nboth  export  and  domestic  consumption  purposes;  (iv)  develop  transmission  and  distribution\nsystems;  (v)  extend  rural  electrification  and  use  renewable  energy  wherever  feasible;  (vi)\npromote private sector involvement; and (vii) further regional cooperation.\n\n54.\nIn  the  transport  sector,  ADB  has  contributed  to  substantial  progress  in  expanding\ntransport infrastructure, increasing the access of many towns to national and regional markets,\nand  developing  institutional  capacity  of  transport  agencies.  ADB\u2019s  sector  strategy  foresees\ncontinuing  its  role  to  support  transport  development  with  the  objectives  of  poverty  reduction,\nprivate  sector  development,  and  national  and  regional  integration.  ADB  will  focus  on  (i)\ndeveloping economic corridors with subregional linkages, and (ii) improving rural access roads\nto facilitate market linkage. The strategy also emphasizes ADB's commitment to pay increased\nattention  to  ensuring  that  social  and  environmental  concerns,  as  well  as  opportunities  to\nmaximize  economic  benefits,  are  integrated  at  the  early  stages  of  the  transport  planning\nprocess.\n\n55.\nADB  has  been  active  in  providing  TA  for  national  environmental  planning  and\nmanagement,  as  well  as  socio-environmental  management  in  the  transport  and  energy\nsectors.14 This has included assistance in revising the NEAP, support for drafting national and\n\n                                                \n14 TA 2734-LAO (footnote 11), TA 3133-LAO (footnote 1), and TA 3535-LAO (footnote 2).\n\n\f16\n\nsectoral  regulations  and  guidelines  on  EIA  and  involuntary  resettlement,  assistance  in\nformulating  draft  environment  quality  standards,  and  institutional  strengthening  and  human\nresource  development  within  STEA,  DOE  in  MIH,  and  DOR  in  MCTPC.  ADB  is  currently\nprocessing a TA for capacity building for environmental and social management in energy and\ntransport,  which  will  be  implemented  in  parallel  with  the  Program.  The  TA  will  cover  (i)\nstrengthening compliance and enforcement mechanisms; (ii) establishing sustainable financing\nmechanisms for environmental and social management, including an environment fund; and (iii)\nrefining the policy framework for involuntary resettlement and compensation, and seeking public\ninvolvement in these processes.15\n\n56.\nSustainable  environmental  management  is  a  thematic  priority  of  ADB's  2002-2004\nCountry Strategy and Program (CSP) for the Lao PDR. The CSP identifies a number of areas\nfor potential priority support: (i) strengthening institutional capacity for policy implementation and\nregulatory enforcement, including social and environmental impact assessments; (ii) systematic\nconsultations with all stakeholders on social and environmental issues, and increased capacity\nand transparency in environmental monitoring and assessment; (iii) investment support for river\nbasin  development  and  stabilization  of  shifting  cultivation;  (iv)  community-based  natural\nresource management; and (v) continued involvement in regional environmental initiatives.\n\n2.\n\nRelevant Lessons Learned\n\n57.\nADB has provided four program loans to the Lao PDR, two each in the agriculture and\nfinancial  sectors.16  Despite  delays  in  meeting  some  agreed-upon  conditions,  the  loans\ncontributed to pushing forward key policy and institutional reforms in the two sectors. Lessons\nlearned from these programs as well as country-specific lessons on environmental management\nand social issues in the energy and transport sectors are summarized in Appendix 2. Lessons\nlearned from program lending to the Lao PDR include the need to (i) ensure country ownership\nof the program; (ii) provide clear analysis of the rationale for proposed policy reforms; (iii) allow\nadequate  lead  time  for  consultative  processes  before  issuance  of  new  legislation  and/or\nregulations  and  to  specifically  address  enforcement  issues;  (iv)  correctly  assess  absorptive\ncapacity  and  incorporate  capacity-building  activities  as  an  integral  part  of  the  program;  (v)\nprovide  well-designed  TAs  before  and  during  program  formulation,  to  sustain  policy  reform\ndevelopment;  (vi)  focus  reform  efforts  on  a  manageable  package  of  priority  reforms  that  are\ncritical  to  realizing  program  objectives;  (vii)  better  sequence  and  integrate  reforms  within  the\nnational  development  agenda;  (viii)  recognize  limited  national  capacity  to  monitor  program\nimplementation; and (ix) establish clear performance criteria to facilitate program monitoring.\n\nMost  transport  and  energy  projects  in  the  Lao  PDR  have  had  adverse  social  and\n58.\nenvironmental \nidentification  and\nformulation,  and  generally  were  inadequately  addressed  during  project  construction  and\noperation. The oversight has caused unnecessary environmental damage and human hardship,\nand has weakened investor and aid agency confidence. Experience in  the  Lao  PDR  suggests\n\nimpacts  were  not  anticipated  during \n\nimpacts.  These \n\n                                                \n15 TA 3746-LAO: Capacity Building for Environment and Social Management in Energy and Transport, for $600,000,\n\napproved on 22 October 2001.\n\n16 Loan 0965-LAO: Agriculture Program Loan, for $20 million, approved on 3 August 1989; Loan 1061-LAO: Financial\nSector Program, for $25 million, approved on 6 December 1990; Loan 1180-LAO: Second Agriculture Program, for\n$30 million, approved on 8 October 1992; and Loan 1458-LAO: Second Financial Sector Program, for $25 million,\napproved on 12 September 1996.\n\n\f17\n\nthat  a  regulatory  framework  and  clear  rules  of  the  game  are  needed  to  ensure  that  potential\nsocial and environmental impacts are identified at an early stage, and that adequate mitigation\nmeasures are incorporated in project designs. A second problem is that inadequate account is\ntaken  of  existing  and  planned  developments,  natural  resources,  existing  land  use,  and  local\ninstitutional  capacity  during  infrastructure  planning.  This  increases  costs  and  eliminates\npotential  beneficial  synergies,  reducing  economic  and/or  financial  returns.  It  has  become\nobvious that efforts to avoid or minimize social and environmental impacts at the project  level\nmust begin at the time that sector strategies and programs are being formulated.\n\n59.\nThe  quality  of  social  and  environmental  impact  assessments  and  resettlement  action\nplans  has  varied  greatly  depending  on  the  amount  of  time,  expertise,  and  funding  available.\nWith  the  promulgation  of  the  EPL,  the  aim  is  for  all  projects  to  meet  the  same  national\nstandards, depending on the magnitude and scale of the project. This will require consistency in\napproach and application of regulations. In addition, many projects in the transport and energy\nsectors  were  identified  and  designed  with  inadequate  social,  environmental,  economic,\ninstitutional,  and  spatial  baseline  information.  A  coordinated  effort  is  required  to  develop  a\nrational  and  structured  national  information  management  system.  A  final  lesson  is  that  public\ninvolvement  during  planning,  construction,  and  implementation  stages  has  been  rudimentary,\nwith  no  national  guidelines  to  direct  this  process.  Consequently,  planners  often  failed  to\nunderstand the full range of project impacts on local residents and village life, and thus missed\nopportunities  for  maximizing  development  impact.  Heightened  awareness  by  the  population  of\ntheir rights and responsibilities can help increase transparency and accountability, and facilitate\nincreased compliance.\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nV. \n\nTHE PROGRAM\n\n60.\nThe  Lao  PDR  is  a  small  landlocked  country  with  mountainous  terrain,  low  population\ndensity,  limited  pool  of  skilled  human  resources,  and  a  wealth  of  natural  resources  and\nenvironmental  assets,  including  globally  significant  biodiversity.  The  Government  aims  to\ntransform and diversify the country's predominantly resource-based economy while maintaining\nmacroeconomic  stability  and  promoting  economic  growth.  The  country's  economy  depends\nprimarily  on  natural  resources  in  the  forest,  mining,  tourism,  fisheries,  agriculture,  and\nhydropower  sectors.  Since  natural  resources  underpin  economic  development  and  poverty\nreduction  prospects,  the  Government  is  acutely  aware  of  the  importance  of  conserving\nenvironmental  resources  and  ensuring  the  environmental  and  social  sustainability  of  all\ndevelopment activities.\n\nAdoption  of  a  policy  and  regulatory  framework  for  environmental  management  and\n61.\nsocial safeguards has been the subject of considerable policy dialogue and TA over the last few\nyears.  A  major  accomplishment  has  been  the  enactment  of  the  EPL,  which  together  with\nrelevant  environmental  provisions  in  the  laws  on  electricity,  roads,  land,  water  resources  and\nforests,  provides  a  relatively  sound  basis  for  environmental  management  in  the  country.  The\nnext  phase  in  pursuing  environmental  conservation  and  ensuring  effective  enforcement  of  the\nEPL  will  require  the  adoption  of  an  enabling  framework  for  regulation  and  compliance,\nsupported by measures to enhance Government capacity and address financial and institutional\nsustainability. Without such a framework, the adequate integration of environmental and social\nissues across all sectors will remain elusive.\n\n\f18\n\nLack of an adequate framework for policy implementation is especially evident in major\n62.\nenergy  and  transport  infrastructure  development.  The  projects,  which  can  have  wide-ranging,\ncross-sectoral,  and  long-term  social  and  environmental  impacts,  have  often  lacked  effective\nplanning,  design,  and  implementation  of  environmental  and  social  safeguards.  Improved\nenvironmental  performance  in  these  sectors  will  require  overcoming  five  related  sets  of\nconstraints: (i) incomplete policy and regulatory framework at the national level; (ii) lack of policy\nimplementation  and  institutional  capacity  at  sectoral  and  provincial  levels;  (iii)  inadequate\ncompliance  and  enforcement  mechanisms;  (iv)  absence  of  integrated  area-based  planning\nframeworks to guide investments in energy and transport, and provide a strategic framework for\nreconciling  competing  interests  in  the  use  of  resources;  and  (v)  insufficient  attention  to\nsustainable financing for environmental management and social safeguards.\n\nThe Government wants to make a transition from essentially reactive and case-by-case\n63.\nremedial  action  on  environmental  and  social  impacts  toward  a  proactive  approach  that\nintegrates  these  concerns  at  national,  sectoral,  and  area-based  levels.  The  Government  has\nsought  ADB's  assistance  to  undertake  a  program  of  policy  implementation  measures  that  will\nshift  the  country  on  a  more  sustainable  development  trajectory,  beginning  with  actions  to\naddress identified constraints facing the energy and transport sectors. ADB has had a long and\nextensive association with these sectors as well as environmental management in the Lao PDR\nand has been able to gain relevant sector knowledge to pursue substantive policy dialogue with\nthe  Government  in  this  regard.  The  Program  will  assist  the  Government  to  implement  the\nnecessary  preconditions  for  improved  environmental  management  and  social  safeguard\nperformance.  While  the  Program  will  focus  primarily  on  energy  and  transport,  the  policy  shifts\nwill have beneficial effects beyond these sectors.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n64.\nThe  proposed  Program  will  assist  the  Lao  PDR  to  implement  a  targeted  policy  reform\nagenda  for  environmental  management  and  social  safeguards  in  the  energy  and  transport\nsectors,  with  particular  focus  on  hydropower  and  roads.  The  Program  encompasses  five\nmutually  reinforcing  policy  objectives:  (i)  strengthening  national  policy  and  a  regulatory\nframework for environmental management and social safeguards, (ii) undertaking measures to\nenhance  policy  implementation  and  capacity  at  sectoral  and  provincial  levels,  (iii)  improving\ncompliance  and  enforcement,  (iv)  promoting  river  basin  management  as  a  multisectoral  and\nintegrated  planning  framework  for  energy  and  transport  development,  and  (v)  establishing\nsustainable financing mechanisms, including an environment fund.\n\n65.\nThe program framework is in Appendix 3. The Government's intention to implement the\nProgram is summarized in the draft development policy letter shown in Appendix 4. The scope\nof  the  proposed  reforms,  the  specific  policy  actions,  and  their  sequencing  are  detailed  in  the\npolicy  matrix  shown  in  Appendix  5.  The  Government  is  committed  to  undertake  these  policy\nactions as an integral part of the Program.\n\nC.\n\nPolicy Framework and Actions\n\n66.\nThe  policy  framework  and  the  specific  actions  included  in  the  Program  have  been\ndesigned through a participatory process that involved field surveys, workshops, and extensive\nconsultations  with  stakeholders  at  the  national,  regional,  and  local  levels,  including  the  major\nfunding agencies involved in supporting environment, transport, and energy (Appendix 6). As a\nresult, the  reforms  and  specific  policy  actions  detailed  in  the  draft  policy matrix are directly\n\n\f19\n\nsupportive of the Government's environment and development objectives, and are intended to\ncomplement  and  actively  promote  relevant  programs  of  the  international  aid  community  in  the\nLao PDR.\n\nIn view of the linkages across sectors and their bearing on environmental management\n67.\nand social safeguards in energy and transport development, a multisectoral approach was used\nto  identify  and  develop  the  intended  policy  measures.  In  developing  the  policy  matrix,  it  was\nrecognized that the process of strengthening policy implementation will extend beyond the time\nhorizon of the Program. Current capacity to implement the policy agenda is limited and can only\nimprove progressively in the short term to medium term. As such, the policy matrix reflects an\nincremental  approach  that  is  consistent  with  the  realities  of  implementation  capacity  in  the\ncountry.\n\n1. \n\nNational Policy and Regulatory Framework\n\n68.\nThe  EPL  and  relevant  provisions  of  the  laws  on  electricity,  roads,  forestry,  and  water\nresources  provide  an  overall  legal  framework  to  protect  environmental  resources  in  the  Lao\nPDR and safeguard the rights of affected people. Effective implementation and enforcement of\nthese laws are predicated on the development of appropriate regulatory frameworks. The EPL\ncannot  achieve  its  full  operational  significance  in  the  absence  of  implementing  decrees  and\nregulations that clarify roles, mandates, responsibilities, and operational measures. Recognizing\nthe  urgency  of  an  implementing  decree  for  the  EPL  that  will  underpin  the  Program,  the\nGovernment  took  action  to  issue  this  on  4  June  2001.  In  addition,  national  EIA  regulations\nissued by STEA in October 2000 need to be updated to place greater emphasis on mechanisms\nfor  public  involvement  in  the  EIA  process.  The  revised  regulations  will  be  issued  as  a  Prime\nMinister's  decree  to  demonstrate  political  commitment  and  to  ensure  the  regulations  carry  the\nnecessary  administrative  weight  to  facilitate  adoption  and  governance  of  sectoral  EIA\nregulations  and  the  environmental  certification  process.  Similarly,  as  an  essential  element  in\nmeeting  program  objectives,  the  Government  will  take  steps  to  ensure  that  the  overall  public\ninvestment plan (PIP) adequately addresses environmental management and social safeguard\nconcerns.  The  coverage  will  be  reflected  in  the  decree  on  preparing  and  monitoring  the  PIP,\ncurrently being developed with ADB assistance. Overall progress in addressing the environment\nwill be captured in annual state-of-the-environment reports to be issued by STEA, for which it is\nreceiving support from UNEP.\n\n69.\nA  comprehensive  policy  on  resettlement  and  compensation  is  required  to  provide  a\nframework  for  effectively  addressing  the  resettlement  impacts  of  major  projects  (Appendix  7).\nAs  another  essential  element  of  the  Program,  the  adoption  of  the  policy  will  provide  a  single\nnationwide standard applicable to all major projects that will meet both national objectives and\ninternational  standards.  The  policy  will  consist  of  (i)  an  outline  of  the  legal  framework;  (ii)\nprinciples  that  address  vulnerable  groups,  and  public  consultations  and  participation;  (iii)\nprinciples,  rights,  obligations,  and  entitlements  for  compensation;  (iv)  financial  resources  and\nbudgetary \ninstitutional  and\nadministrative  setup;  and  (vi)  steps  for  policy  implementation.  Accompanying  regulations  will\nconsist of requirements for statistical data collection, contents of the implementation schedule,\ndispute resolution mechanisms, and provisions for monitoring.\n\nissues;  (v)  management  of  resettlement \n\nterms  of \n\nthe \n\nin \n\n70. While the principles of public involvement and participation are enshrined in a number of\nGovernment  policies,  laws,  and  sector  strategies,  no  clear  national  policy  provides  the\nframework  and  standards  for  the  conduct  of  public  consultations  to  promote  participation,\ntransparency,  and  accountability.  In  the  absence  of  such  a  policy  framework,  projects  and\n\n\f20\n\ninterventions  sometimes  may  have  been  developed  and  implemented  without  adequate\nconsultations  and  participation  of  beneficiaries  and  affected  communities.  In  keeping  with  the\nGovernment's commitment to participatory planning that caters to people's needs, priorities, and\naspirations, the Government will issue a policy statement and guidelines on public involvement\nand  participation  that  provide  for  planning,  facilitating,  and  monitoring  the  involvement  of\naffected communities in the preparation and implementation of major projects.\n\n71.\nSTEA  is  responsible  for  interministerial  coordination  among  line  agencies  concerned\nwith  environmental  protection.  It  has  been  doing  this  to  a  limited  extent  through  the  informal\nefforts  of  the  IMWGE  set  up  with  the  assistance  of  the  UNDP.  While  the  IMWGE  has  been  a\nuseful body in the early stages of environmental policy formulation, it suffers from a dichotomy\nbecause it has an essentially technical membership but faces increasingly policy-based issues\nin  interministerial  coordination.  The  Government  is  committed  to  formally  establishing  a\npermanent  high-level  Environmental  Coordinating  Committee  (ECC)  to  address  policy-level\nissues and reconcile competing interests in the use of environment and natural resources. The\nGovernment envisages that the ECC will be serviced by working groups on technical issues.\n\n72.\nOver the medium term, the institutional architecture for environmental management may\nneed  to  evolve  to  reflect  the  complex  challenges  and  cross-sectoral  linkages  facing  the  Lao\nPDR  in  managing  land,  water,  and  forest  resources,  biodiversity  protection,  environmentally\nsustainable  agriculture  and  rural  development,  and  urban  environmental  improvement.  The\nroles of STEA and line ministries, both at national and subnational levels, will need to continue\nto respond to these challenges and the Government's decentralization strategy. As an integral\npart  of  the  Program,  the  Government  plans  to  review  current  institutional  arrangements  to\ndetermine  whether  adjustments  are  warranted  in  institutional  mandates,  structures,  and\nrelationships, and to assess long-term institutional development needs. The ECC will coordinate\nthe review, whose recommendations will be adopted during the Program. The Government will\nundertake a parallel review of provisions of relevant laws and decrees to clarify ambiguities and\ninconsistencies with the EPL and its implementing regulations.\n\n73.\nAs evidenced by the most recent funding agency roundtable meeting (RTM) in 2000, the\nGovernment  is  taking  steps  to  improve  aid  coordination  and  consultation  for  key  development\nsectors.  STEA  will  establish  a  mechanism  for  regular  funding  agency  consultation  on\nenvironmental  issues  to  facilitate  exchange  of  information  and  sharing  of  knowledge,  update\nfunding agencies on the progress of ongoing or planned projects, and discuss constraints and\nopportunities for improved implementation of the EPL and the NEAP across all sectors. STEA\nwill also establish a forum for civil society consultation to open a window for regular dialogue on\nemerging policy or project issues with all stakeholders.\n\n2. \n\nPolicy Implementation at Sector and Provincial Levels\n\n74.\nEnvironmental management in the Lao PDR needs to be better integrated into sectoral\ndevelopment strategies, programs and projects. The required policy integration can occur only if\nline  ministries  take  a  more  active  role  in  ensuring  that  environment  and  social  measures  are\nfully reflected in their work. Within the framework of the EPL and its implementing decree, line\nministries  are  required  to  issue  sectoral  EIA  regulations  and  establish  environmental\nmanagement and monitoring units.\n\nUnder  the  Program,  the  Government  intends  to  take  a  number  of  steps  to  strengthen\n75.\nsectoral performance, building on analysis and products  prepared  under  ADB TA (footnote 1).\n\n\f21\n\nMIH  and  MCTPC  will  issue  implementing  regulations  on  the  EIA  process,  and  formally  adopt\ntechnical EIA guidelines for the energy and roads sectors, respectively. Both sets of regulations\nwill stipulate that the relevant ministry and STEA must approve the environmental management\nplan before an environmental certificate can be issued. MCTPC and MIH will also develop and\nissue  regulations  and  guidelines  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  compensation  for  major\nprojects.  Within  MIH  and  MCTPC,  DOE  and  DOR  will  be  restructured  to  upgrade  the  existing\nenvironmental  management  units  to  fully  functioning  social  and  environmental  management\ndivisions reporting directly to the respective directors of DOE and DOR. Mandate, budget, terms\nof  reference,  staffing,  and  training  programs  for  both  divisions  will  be  developed  to  meet  the\nneed  for  improved  environmental  management  and  social  safeguards.  A  similar  process  of\ninstitutional strengthening will be undertaken at EdL.\n\nIn addition to strengthening the review and monitoring functions of DOE and DOR, the\n76.\nconcerned  ministries  will  issue  binding  environmental  and  social  safeguard  codes  of  practice\ndirected  at  contractors  and  works  supervisors,  together  with  practical  instructions.  Under  the\nProgram, the Government will explore the scope for introducing selected market arrangements\nto secure efficiency gains. This will include assessing the feasibility of contracting to the private\nsector  certain  environmental  management  and  social  safeguard  review,  monitoring,  and\nimplementation  functions.  The  assessment  will  involve  market  analysis  of  private  sector\ncapacity  to  implement  selected  environmental  services  for  the  Government  under  contract,\nincluding  examination  of  certification,  licensing,  regulation,  and  incentives.  It  will  also  look  at\nhow the private sector by giving on-the-ground training during contracted review and monitoring\nexercises, can build capacity in STEA and the environmental units of line agencies.\n\nIn  the  context  of  the  Government's  decentralization  strategy,  increasing  emphasis  is\n77.\nbeing  given  to  building  relevant  capacity  at  provincial  and  district  levels,  and  defining\nappropriate linkages among line agencies. The EPL assigns a significant role to provincial and\ndistrict  STEOs  in  ensuring  that  environment  objectives  are  reflected  in  provincial  and  district\ndevelopment  planning,  and  that  environmental  provisions  are  complied  with  and  enforced.\nDecentralization will take some time to become effective because existing capacities are weak\nand  will  remain  inadequate  in  the  medium  term.  Nevertheless,  the  Program  will  ensure  that\nnecessary  steps  are  taken  to  strengthen  and  equip  STEOs,  beginning  in  a  limited  number  of\nprovinces\u2014at least seven\u2014 within the period of the Program. In these provinces, the respective\nSTEOs  will  coordinate  the  preparation  of  environment  action  plans  to  provide  a  basis  for\nprioritizing tasks, allocating Government resources, and budgeting purposes. The environment\naction  plans  will  be  updated  periodically  and  reflected  in  provincial  development  plans  and\nbudgets. The overall process will be supported by TA from bilateral sources already committed\nto assisting the Government in this area.17\n\n78.\nThe  Program  will  also  lay  the  foundations  for  longer  term  and  more  comprehensive\nstrengthening of provincial STEOs. In this regard, STEA will prepare and submit to the Cabinet\na  detailed  assessment  and  realistic  recommendations  on  priority  medium-term  human  and\nfinancial resource requirements to effectively implement the EPL at provincial and district levels.\nIn  undertaking  the  assessment,  STEA  will  also  review  and  implement  improvements  in  the\nfunctional linkages between STEA and provincial STEOs.\n\n                                                \n17  A  Swedish-funded  project  based  at  the  Science,  Technology,  and  Environment  Agency  (STEA),  which  started\nimplementation in early 2001, will include support for STEA and at least four science, technology, and environment\noffices (STEOs), and a second phase of a Danish-funded project at Committee for Planning and Cooperation will\ninclude support for a number of STEOs.\n\n\f22\n\n3. \n\nCompliance and Enforcement\n\n79.\nThe Program as a whole is concerned with improved implementation, compliance, and\nenforcement of the EPL and related regulations. At the same time, a number of specific policy\nactions  are  envisaged  to  further  promote  compliance  and  enforcement,  and  to  ensure  that\ncompliance  is  subject  to  independent  and  transparent  review  when  this  is  appropriate.  To\nsupport transparency and accountability in social and environmental decision making, STEA will\nmaintain  an  environmental  and  social  impact  assessment  register  and  establish  a  fully\nfunctioning  public  information  center,  which  will  catalogue  and  make  available  to  the  public\ncopies  of  all  EIAs,  environment  management  plans  (EMPs),  and  resettlement  action  plans\n(RAPs) submitted and approved. An environmental gazette will be published twice yearly. The\ngazette will record notices related to environment clearance certificates, licenses, decisions on\napprovals  and  required  mitigation  actions  for  development  projects,  enforcement  actions\nagainst  industrial  and  mining  polluters.  The  gazette  will  list  projects  related  to  social  and\nenvironmental management. STEA, in close consultation with the ECC, will prepare a strategy\nfor  initiating  and  producing  the  environmental  gazette.  STEA  will  be  responsible  for  managing\nits twice yearly publication on a continuous basis. Information to be disclosed in the gazette will\nbe provided by Government agencies, coordinated by STEA.\n\n80.\nMIH  and  MCTPC  will  prepare  annual  sector  reports  on  social  and  environmental\nperformance and compliance  and submit them to STEA and the ECC. The sector compliance\nreports  will  cover  (i)  environment  certificate  conditions  included  in  concession  agreements,\nlicenses,  permits,  tenders,  and  bidding  documents;  (ii)  state  of  compliance  with  the  EPL  and\nproject-specific EMPs as well as RAPs; and (iii) implementation plan and budget for addressing\nany identified deficiencies. Other ministries will also be encouraged to submit such reports, on\nthe  basis  of  experience  gained  at  MIH  and  MCTPC.  MIH  and  MCTPC  will  also  institute\nprocedures  to  ensure  that  the  social  and  environmental  mitigation  programs  and  associated\nbudgets as shown in the EMPs, special assistance projects, and involuntary resettlement action\nplans  are  properly  incorporated  into  project  concession  agreements,  financial  arrangements,\nand other relevant contractual documents.\n\n81.\nThe need both to comply and to be seen to comply with EMPs and RAPs is especially\nimportant for successful implementation of transport and energy projects. The Government has\nhad a generally positive experience with third-party monitoring, which it has employed for three\nmajor  hydropower  and  road  infrastructure  projects.  Third-party  monitoring  is  also  important  in\nproviding  comfort  to  investors  and  funding  agencies  that  funding  provided  for  major\ninfrastructure  projects  will  result  in  socially  and  environmentally  acceptable  outcomes.  As\nenvisaged  under  the  Program,  a  third-party  monitoring  system  will  be  designed  and\ninstitutionalized  to  ensure  technically  competent,  transparent,  and  independent  compliance\nmonitoring  of  all  complex  and  sensitive  infrastructure  projects.  The  design  of  the  third-party\nmonitoring system will place emphasis on mentoring approaches to build national capacities for\nmainstream  monitoring.  STEA  will  be  responsible  for  organizing  the  basic  framework  for  the\nthird-party monitoring system in close conjunction with relevant line agencies. The Government\nhas decided that the third-party monitoring system will be put in place in the course of program\nimplementation  for  all  sensitive  and  complex  projects,  beginning  with  all  hydropower  projects\nand  those  roads  projects  that  may  impact  negatively  on  protected  areas  or  involve  significant\ninvoluntary resettlement.\n\nAs  part  of  the  Program,  the  Government  will  test  arrangements  to  strengthen\n82.\nperformance  bond  systems   to   provide  a   means  of   enforcing   developer   and  contractor\n\n\f23\n\ncommitments  and  obligations  on  environmental  and  social  mitigation,  and  to  improve  the\nincentive structure for compliance. Such performance bonds financially guarantee meeting the\ncosts of such mitigation, or will be called upon in the event of noncompliance. Potential activities\nfor which a bond could apply include resettlement and compensation, environmental mitigation\nworks,  monitoring,  and  decommissioning.  The  bonds  will  be  targeted  to  specific  activities\nidentified in the project EMP and RAP, and will apply to developers of major sensitive projects.\nA number of issues will be addressed on a case-by-case basis such as (i) the form of security,\nits  irrevocable  nature,  and  the  appropriate  level  of  financial  assurance;  (ii)  the  triggers  for\nrelease of the bond; and (iii) arrangements for holding the bond. The Government will apply the\nrecommendations  of  its  study  of  these  options  to  configure  and  implement  the  performance\nbond system.\n\nA  crucial  element  in  ensuring  compliance  with  environmental  rules  and  regulations  is\n83.\npublic knowledge of rights and responsibilities. Building on previous efforts to inform the public\nabout the EPL at national, provincial, and district levels, STEA will launch and conduct together\nwith  relevant  ministries  an  ongoing  national  public  awareness  campaign.  The  campaign  will\ninvolve  the  media,  educational  institutions,  and  mass  organizations  such  as  Lao  Women's\nUnion  in  raising  awareness  of  environmental  management  and  social  safeguards,  and  the\nprovisions of the public involvement policy. STEA is already receiving support from bilateral aid\nagencies to expand this process and ensure systematic coverage across provincial and district\nlevels.\n\n84.\nThe  Government  will  also  pursue  capacity  strengthening  in  the  field  of  administration\nand justice, with support from bilateral aid agencies. The activities will include (i) an overview of\nlegal  mandates  and  implications  of  the  EPL;  (ii)  legal  approaches  to  enforcement  and\ncompliance;  and  (iii)  civil  and  criminal  sanctions,  such  as  warnings,  fines,  civil  sanctions,  and\ncriminal charges. Specialized training workshops will be held for members of the judiciary, legal\nofficials  in  the  National  Assembly,  Prime  Minister's  Office,  Ministry  of  Justice,  Public\nProsecutor's Office, and faculty of the National University Law School.\n\n4. \n\nIntegrated Framework for Resource Management\n\nThe Program includes a number of policy actions to ensure that planning of energy and\n85.\nroads  programs  can  take  place  within  an  integrated  resource  management  framework.  The\nGovernment  has  issued  on  10  October  2001  a  decree  to  implement  the  Water  and  Water\nResources Law, and establish river basin planning as the overall framework for natural resource\nmanagement.  The  decree,  which  was  developed  with  ADB  assistance  and  has  undergone\nconsiderable  consultations  through  the  WRCC  mechanism,  will  define  the  structure  of  water\nresources planning and management at the national and river basin levels. At the national level,\na  National  Water  Resources  Plan  (NWRP)  will  define  the  national  objectives,  strategies,  and\npriorities  for  water  resources  development  and  management,  including  institutional  issues.  At\nthe level of at least one major river basin, plans will be produced to address (i) assessment of\nthe  resources  available  and  obligations  to  downstream  areas,  (ii)  allocation  of  water  to\nsubsectors,  (iii)  declaration  of  preserved  and  reserved  areas,  (iv)  controls  for  managing  water\nquality, and (v) institutional arrangements and coordination responsibilities.\n\n86. Within  the  overall  river  basin  management  approach,  MAF  will  take  necessary  actions\nas  adopted  under  the  Nam  Ngum  river  basin  action  agenda  and  management  strategy.  It  will\nalso  finalize  and  begin  to  implement  a  master  plan  to  promote  watershed  management\nactivities and  prepare  integrated  frameworks  for  area-based  planning. Within  the  integrated\n\n\f24\n\nplanning  context,  MIH  and  MCTPC,  in  close  consultation  with  other  relevant  agencies,  will\nreview  their  medium-term  sector  plans  to  identify  strategic  environmental  management  and\nsocial safeguard issues. As a support measure, the Government wishes to develop an improved\nsystem  for  interministerial  data  collection,  access,  and  use  to  assist  in  planning  and\nimplementing projects with an integrated resource management approach. The process will be\nguided by the following principles: (i) a framework for the information system will be developed\nand  agreed  to  by  the  ECC,  and  (ii)  the  data  collection  and  storage  system  will  preserve  the\nintegrity of existing databases. Finally, the preparation of the National Biodiversity Conservation\nStrategy and Action Plan (NBCSAP) is linked to the long-term success of the Program, in view\nof  the  need  to  ensure  that  priority  biodiversity  conservation  objectives  are  properly  articulated\nand taken into account in national and sector development planning. To formulate the NBCSAP,\nthe  Government  has  secured  financial  support  and  technical  assistance  from  the  Danish\nInternational Development Assistance (Danida).\n\n5. \n\nSustainable Financing Mechanisms\n\nTo  achieve  its  ambitious  socioeconomic  development  targets,  the  Government  intends\n87.\nto  (i)  increase  budget  revenue  as  a  percentage  of  GDP;  (ii)  mobilize  private  investment  in\nproviding  public  services  and  infrastructure;  (iii)  ensure  that  public  expenditure  is  directed\nefficiently  to  investments  that  maximize  long-term  social  and  economic  returns;  and  (iv)\nincrease the share of current expenditure in total public expenditure. A core program focus is to\nsupport  Government  efforts \nin  socially  and\nenvironmentally responsible hydropower development, and transport, trade, and tourism-related\nactivities.  These  sectors  have \nin\nGovernment revenue.\n\nto  generate  substantial \n\nincreased  private \n\nimprovements \n\nthe  potential \n\ninvestment \n\nto  attract \n\nThe  Program  will  benefit  from  actions  to  finalize  a  joint  Government-ADB-IMF-World\n88.\nBank  public  expenditure  review  (PER)  of  plans  and \nimplementation  and  monitoring\nmechanisms,  and  to  implement  agreed-upon  actions  resulting  from  the  PER  as  they  relate  to\nProgram objectives. The Program includes measures to strengthen public investment planning\nprocesses and to ensure that the overall PIP is formulated and monitored in compliance with the\nEPL.  Policy  actions  will  be  initiated  to  develop  reporting  systems  to  provide  information  on\nconsolidated  national  spending  on  the  environment  to  be  published  by  MOF.  Other  measures\nrelated  to  increased  transparency,  public  consultation  processes,  compliance  reporting,  and\nthird-party  monitoring  of  investments  in  the  transport  and  energy  sectors  will  contribute  to\nincreased  public  expenditure  accountability  and,  thus,  to  increased  public  expenditure\nefficiency.  Counterpart  funds  generated  from  the  program  loan  will  be  used  to  fund  increased\nallocations of current expenditure in total public expenditure.\n\n89.\nEffective  implementation  of  environmental  and  social  measures  in  the  energy  and\ntransport  sectors  will  benefit  from  a  sustainable  financing  mechanism  to  provide  targeted\nsupport over the long term. As an integral part of the Program, and as foreseen under the EPL,\nthe Government will establish an environment fund to respond to this need. The proceeds of the\nfund will be used to finance appropriate entities that would undertake these activities in the Lao\nPDR:  (i)  capacity  building  and  human  resource  development  for  environmental  management\nand  social  safeguards;  (ii)  third-party  monitoring  of  environmental  and  social  implications  of\ncomplex  and  sensitive  infrastructure  projects;  (iii)  planning  frameworks  for  integrated  resource\nmanagement;  (iv)  conservation  and  sustainable  use  of  biodiversity;  (v)  participatory  natural\nresource management initiatives; and (vi) enabling measures to ensure that environmental and\n\n\f25\n\nsocial  mitigation  in  energy,  transport,  and  other  infrastructure  projects  is  in  place  and\nimplemented.\n\n90.\nIn consultation with ADB, the Government has decided on the basic principles that will\ngovern  the  design  and  operations  of  the  fund  (Appendix  8).  The  fund\u2019s  final  design,  size,\ngovernance  structure,  and  operating  mechanisms  will  be  based  on  an  extensive  consultation\nprocess, and will be consistent with international best practice and experience with environment\nfunds.  The  fund  will  be  tailored  to  reflect  the  country\u2019s  basic  fabric  of  legal  and  financial\npractices,  including  supporting  institutions  such  as  banking,  auditing,  and  contracting,  and  the\ncapacity  to  implement  the  environmental  and  social  mitigation  measures  envisaged.  It  will  be\nconfigured to ensure a sustained flow of income over its life span. ADB TA is being processed\nin  parallel  to  the  Program  to  assist  the  Government  in  reviewing  options  and  configuring  the\nFund (footnote 14).\n\n91.\nThe Government also believes it would be desirable to implement the recovery of costs\nof enforcing the environmental and social mitigation regulations. The imposition of user charges\ncould  contribute  to  realizing  equity  and  sustainability  objectives.  The  Government  will  make  a\nstudy to identify appropriate services for which user charges could be levied, and to assess the\nfeasibility of a user charge system. The study will analyze a range of options for imposing user\ncharges. The options will be prepared in consultation with relevant stakeholders.\n\nD.\n\nProgram Adjustment Costs\n\n92.\nProgram  adjustment  costs  are  estimated  at  about  $37  million  over  a  five-year  period.\nThis indicative estimate is based on assumptions about (i) the incremental investment costs of\nimproved  compliance  with  stricter  environmental  and  social  safeguards  in  the  power  and\ntransport sectors, (ii) the costs of undertaking watershed planning and pilot projects to improve\nwatershed management, (iii) indicative estimates of direct institutional strengthening costs, and\n(iv) the initial capitalization of the environment fund.\n\n93.\nThe  major  adjustment  costs  of  the  proposed  program  result  from  the  additional  public\ninvestment  costs  needed  to  ensure  that  environmental  and  social  safeguards  are  built  into\ninfrastructure  projects.  Incremental  compliance  costs  for  road  transport  development  projects\nare  estimated  at  0.5-1.5  percent  of  total  investment  costs.  The  additional  development  costs\nresult  from  improved  resettlement  programs,  increased  public  consultations  and  information\ndissemination,  social  and  environmental  expertise  in  contract  supervision  and  project\nmonitoring,  unexploded  ordnance  (UXO)  clearance,  and  regenerating  the  construction  areas.\nIncremental costs are higher for new and reconstructed roads than for rehabilitation of existing\nroads.  Given  the  financing  gaps  in  the  transport  sector  investment  plan  and  recent  levels  of\ninvestment,  it  is  assumed  that  only  75  percent  of  the  transport  investment  plan  is  actually\nimplemented.  For  the  power  sector,  incremental  compliance  costs  are  estimated  to  be  in  the\norder  of  about  2  percent  of  total  hydropower  investment  costs.  The  base  case  assumption  is\nthat  only  20  percent  of  planned  IPP  projects  are  actually  developed  in  the  next  10  years\n(excluding Nam Theun 2,  which is expected to be implemented but with full compliance costs\nassumed  in  the  without-Program  situation).  Estimated  adjustment  costs  are  sensitive  to\nassumptions  regarding  development  costs  and  the  percentage  of  planned  investment  actually\nimplemented.  Approximately  half  the  infrastructure  adjustment  costs  would  be  incurred  under\npublicly financed projects (i.e., the roads and domestic power projects).\n\n\f26\n\nThe  Government  will  incur  additional  costs  in  implementing  river  basin  and  watershed\n94.\nmanagement  studies  and  pilot  projects.  The  MAF  draft  master  plan  for  its  watershed\nmanagement program estimates that $5.22 million will be required over the next five years for\nwatershed management planning and pilot activities, and $3.19 million for agro-zoning, land use\nplanning,  and  mapping  in  key  watersheds.  To  implement  new  guidelines;  to  increase  public\nawareness  of  rights  and  obligations  with  respect  to  social  and  environmental  safeguards;  to\neffectively address social and environmental issues in national, sectoral, river basin, provincial,\nand project planning exercises; and in third-party monitoring of sensitive infrastructure projects,\nthe  Government  plans  to  reorganize  and  strengthen  the  capacity  of  Government  agencies  at\ncentral and provincial levels. Adjustment costs will also be incurred in implementing systematic\nstakeholder  consultations  in  sector  and  public  investment  planning.  Summary  estimates  of\nprogram adjustment costs over a medium-term horizon of five years are presented in Table 1.\n\nTable 1: Indicative Program Adjustment Costs (Over 5 years)\n\nItem\n\nCosts ($ million)\n\nInfrastructure\n  Public Investment in Road Transport\n    - Rehabilitation projects\n    - Strategic projects\n    - Local projects\n    - Mekong bridges\n    - Vientiane City\n\n  Public Investment in Domestic Power\n    - Domestic generation\n    - Domestic transmission\n    - Domestic distribution\n\n  Export Power (IPP)\n\nIntegrated Area-Based Planning/Management\n   Watershed management\n   Land use planning\n\nInstitutional Strengthening\n  STEA and investment planning\n  DOR/MCTPC\n  DOE/MIH\n  EdL\n  STEOs\n\nEnvironment Fund\n   Fund\n   Counterpart costs of studies\n\nTotal\n\n20.56\n4.96\n0.17\n3.57\n0.83\n0.25\n0.14\n\n5.60\n4.20\n0.80\n0.60\n\n10.00\n\n8.41\n5.22\n3.19\n\n2.46\n0.70\n0.36\n0.05\n0.14\n1.21\n\n5.25\n5.00\n0.25\n\n36.68\n\nDOE = Department of Electricity, DOR = Department of Roads, EdL = Electricit\u00e9 du Lao,\nIPP = independent power producer, MCTPC = Ministry of Communication, Transport, Post and Construction,\nMIH = Ministry of Industry and Handicrafts, STEA = Science, Technology, and Environment Agency,\nSTEOs = science, technology, and environment offices.\n\n\f27\n\nVI. \n\nTHE PROPOSED LOAN\n\nA.\n\nAmount of Loan, Source of Funds, Interest, Maturity, and Utilization Period\n\nThe Government has requested ADB to provide a loan of $20 million from ADB\u2019s Special\n95.\nFunds  resources.  The  amount  was  determined  through  ADB\u2019s  continued  dialogue  with  the\nGovernment. It takes into account the depth and scope of the proposed policy reforms, and the\nestimated short- and medium-term adjustment costs associated with adopting the policy matrix.\nThe Borrower will be the Lao PDR. The loan will have a repayment period of 24 years, including\na  grace  period  of  8  years.  An  interest  rate  of  1  percent  per  annum  interest  will  be  charged\nduring  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per  annum  thereafter.  The  loan  is  expected  to  be\nutilized over 36 months from loan effectiveness.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\nB. \n \n 96.\nSTEA  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Program,  in  close  coordination  with  CPC,\nMOF,  MCTPC,  MIH,  and  MAF.  STEA  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  ensuring  effective\nimplementation  of  the  Program,  and  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports.  MOF  will  be\nresponsible  for  monitoring  the  use  of  loan  proceeds  and  counterpart  funds,  including  the\nadministration and disbursement of the loan proceeds and maintenance of accounts.\n \n 97.\nAn  interministerial  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the  president  of  STEA,  will  be\nestablished to oversee program implementation. It will be composed of representatives of CPC,\nMAF,  MCTPC,  MIH,  MOF,  and  STEA.  It  will  meet  quarterly  and  also  in  conjunction  with  ADB\nreview missions.\n \nC. \n \nThe loan will finance the full foreign exchange costs, excluding local duties and taxes, of\n 98.\nimports procured in and from ADB\u2019s member countries, other than those specified in the list of\nineligible items (Appendix 9) and those items financed by other multilateral and bilateral official\nsources. Procurement of  eligible  items under ADB\u2019s loan will be based on normal commercial\npractices  for  procurement  by  the  private  sector,  or  standard  Government  procurement\nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB  for  procurement  by  the  public  sector.  In  the  case  of  goods\ncommonly traded on international commodity markets, procurement will be done in accordance\nwith procedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB. ADB will ensure that standard\npublic  and  private  sector  procurement  procedures  used  in  the  country  are  adequate  in  the\ninterest of economy and efficiency.\n \nD. \n\nDisbursement\n\nProcurement\n\n 99.\nLoan proceeds will be utilized to finance the foreign exchange cost of items produced in\nand  procured  from  ADB\u2019s  member  countries  (other  than  those  items  specified  in  Appendix  9\nand imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources). The loan utilization period will\nbe  36  months  after  loan  effectiveness.  On  the  basis  of  ADB\u2019s  simplified  procedures  for  the\ndisbursement of program loans,18 the Borrower will be required to submit with each withdrawal\nrequest  a  certification  confirming  the  Borrower\u2019s  compliance  with  the  following  formula  for  the\nperiod covered by the withdrawal request: for each year in which the proceeds are expected to\nbe  disbursed,  the  value  of  the  country\u2019s  total  imports  minus  (i)  imports  from  nonmember\n\n                                                \n 18 R50-98: Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans, 16 April 1998.\n\n\f28\n\ncountries, (ii) ineligible imports, and (iii) imports financed under other ODA. This must be equal\nto or greater than the amounts expected to be disbursed during the year. The Government will\nopen an account (the deposit account) at the Bank of Lao PDR into which part of the proceeds\nof the loan from the first and second tranches will be deposited and through which  withdrawals\nwill be made. Monthly statements of the deposit account will be attached to the quarterly reports\nof STEA. The balance of the loan proceeds under the third tranche will be used to capitalize the\nproposed environment fund. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to\nverify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification.\n \nE. \n\nCounterpart Funds\n\n 100.\nThe  Government  will  use  counterpart  funds  generated  by  the  loan  to  (i)  finance\nadditional public investment costs in transport and power projects to ensure strengthened social\nand  environmental  safeguards;  (ii)  build  institutional  capacity  to  plan,  design,  and  enforce\nenvironmental and social safeguards; (iii) provide local counterpart resources for development\nprojects aimed at river basin planning and management, and area-based planning; (iv) address\nthe  mitigation  costs  of  existing  infrastructure  where  social  and  environmental  costs  were  not\nadequately addressed; and (v) capitalize the environment fund.\n \nF. \n\nTranching and Monitoring\n\n101.\nThe proceeds of ADB's loan will be released in three tranches when ADB is assured that\nthe  conditions  for  their  release  are  satisfied.  The  first  tranche  of  $5  million  will  be  made\navailable upon loan effectiveness. It is envisaged that the second tranche of $10 million will be\ndisbursed  within  14  months  after  the  first  tranche  release,  subject  to  the  Government's\ncompliance with the conditions set for the release of the second tranche. A third tranche of $5\nmillion will be used to finance the environment fund when it is established during the 36-month\nperiod  of  loan  utilization.  The  policy  matrix  (Appendix  5)  lists  the  conditions  for  the  release  of\neach tranche. The compliance requirements for each policy condition are detailed in Appendix\n10.\n\n102. Program  implementation  will  be  monitored  closely  by  the  Government  and  by  ADB\nthrough  its  regular  loan  review  missions.  Program  performance  indicators  are  included  in  the\nprogram  framework  (Appendix  3).  ADB  monitoring  of  the  Program  will  go  beyond  monitoring\ncompliance  with  tranche  conditions  and  other  actions  included  in  the  policy  matrix,  to  deepen\nand  sustain  the  dialogue  with  the  Government  on  the  overall  effectiveness  of  the  Program  in\nimproving  environmental  and  social  safeguards  while  developing  the  transport  and  energy\ninfrastructure.  The  Government  will  submit \nreports  on  program\nimplementation, particularly on policy actions set out in the policy matrix and development policy\nletter, as well as on the achievement of the program objectives. The reports will be submitted in\nsuch  form  and  in  such  detail  and  within  such  period  as  ADB  may  request,  and  must  include\nprogress  made  and  problems  encountered  during  the  three  months  in  review,  steps  taken  or\nproposed to be taken to remedy problems encountered, and the proposed detailed activity for\nprogram  implementation  and  expected  progress  during  the  next  three  months.  A  joint  ADB-\nGovernment  midterm  policy  review  will  be  undertaken  before  the  second  tranche  is  released,\nand will cover the relevance and effectiveness of the policy actions as well as compliance. On\ncompletion  of  the  Program,  but  in  any  event  not  later  than  six  months,  the  Government  will\nprepare and submit to ADB a comprehensive report on the overall impact of the policy reforms\nimplemented.\n\nto  ADB  quarterly \n\n\f29\n\nVII. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS\n\nA.\n\nImpacts and Benefits\n\nThe  Program  will  strengthen  the  policy  and  regulatory  framework  for  environmental\n103.\nmanagement  and  social  safeguards;  enhance  institutional  capacity  at  sectoral  and  provincial\nlevels  to  identify,  analyze,  and  address  social  and  environmental  issues;  bolster  compliance\nwith  and  enforcement  of  laws  and  regulations;  foster  improved  sector  planning  within  an\nintegrated  natural  resource  management  framework;  and  promote  sustained  financing  for\npriority environmental management activities.\n\n104.\nThe  Program  will  reduce  or  avoid  the  high  social  and  environmental  costs  of\ninappropriately  designed  infrastructure  development  in  the  energy  and  transport  sectors.  This\nwill result from the strategic environment assessment at the level of the PIP, improved upstream\nplanning  of  sectoral  development  and  reconciliation  of  competing  uses  of  natural  resources\nwithin  a  river  basin  context,  better  policy  integration  across  the  sectors,  and  more  systematic\nattention  to  environmental  and  social  safeguards  in  project  preparation  and  implementation.\nStricter enforcement, combined with incentives for compliance such as performance bonds, will\nfacilitate  internalization  of  externalities.  Recent  analysis  shows  that  the  actual  costs  of\nresettlement can be 5-10 times higher than the amounts provided by developers. Where social\nand environmental costs cannot be avoided, more equitable distribution of these costs will result\nfrom  inclusion  of  appropriate  mitigation  measures  in  project  design.  This  will  help  ensure  that\nsocial  and  environmental  costs  will  be  borne,  not  by  the  local  communities  but  by  the  project\ndevelopers.\n\n105.\nIntroducing a coherent and more transparent regulatory framework for addressing social\nand  environmental  concerns  will  reduce  uncertainty  and  delays  associated  with  investment  in\nlarge infrastructure projects in the Lao PDR. This in turn will help make projects more attractive\nto potential investors. It will also provide an enabling environment for international investors with\nglobal  reputations  to  protect.  Such  investors  will  often  prefer  a  regulatory  framework  that\nensures that environmental and social mitigation activities can be planned and implemented in a\npredictable manner, with clear definition of the rights and obligations of all partners.\n\n106.\nImplementing  public  participation  guidelines  will  substantially  improve  the  identification\nof  potential  environmental  and  social  issues  associated  with  infrastructure  developments,  and\nthe  design  of  appropriate  measures  to  address  these  concerns.  Improved  public  participation\nwill  also  generate  additional  economic  benefits  by  (i)  creating  a  better  understanding  of  local\nconditions, which will facilitate improved project designs, reduce risks, and increase efficiency;\n(ii)  identifying  opportunities  to  maximize  economic  benefits  from  infrastructure  developments;\n(iii) enhancing a sense of ownership and sustainability of new infrastructure; and (iv) increasing\nthe accountability of developers and contractors.\n\n107.\nThe Program will enhance prospects for adequate and sustained allocation of resources\nfor  environmental  management  and  social  safeguards  by  introducing  of  user  fees  for\nenvironmental services and establishing the environment fund. It will also increase the efficiency\nof  resource  use  through  prioritization  and  improved  budgetary  processes  that  properly  reflect\nthe  requirements  of  sectoral  and  provincial  agencies  concerned  with  environmental\nmanagement and the implementation of social safeguards.\n\n\f30\n\nThus,  program  benefits  include  (i)  reducing  the  environmental  and  social  costs  of\n108.\nprojects  developed  with  inappropriate  safeguards;  (ii)  increasing  equity  and  resource  use\nefficiency  by  internalizing  social  and  environmental  considerations  in  sector  development;  (iii)\nreducing the costs associated with \u201cfixing\u201d environmental and social problems resulting from an\ninadequate regulatory framework and weak enforcement of safeguards; (iv) attracting increased\ncommercial  investment  in  infrastructure  development;  and  (v)  ensuring  more  sustainable  and\nless risky project designs that better reflect local concerns, needs, and opportunities.\n\nThe  Program  will  also  contribute  to  the  country's  poverty  reduction  goals.  Improved\n109.\nenvironmental  management  will  help  maintain  and  enhance  the  livelihood  base  of  the  rural\npoor. Land use planning and watershed management will improve prospects for sustainable use\nof  natural  resources.  Road  transport  developed,  conceived  within  an  area-based  planning\nframework, will directly benefit isolated communities by improving market linkages and access\nto services. Over the medium term, it is expected that revenues from hydropower projects will\nalso  allow  the  government  to  increase  the  share  of  public  expenditure  allocated  to  health,\neducation,  and  social  development. \ninfrastructure\ndevelopment  will  ensure  that  vulnerable  groups  are  not  impoverished  or  marginalized  by\nadverse impacts.\n\nIntroducing  of  social  safeguards \n\nin \n\n110.\nFinally,  the  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  allow  the  Government  to  temporarily\nincrease  current  expenditure  to  correct  the  existing  imbalance  between  current  and  capital\nexpenditure  and  this,  combined  with  program  expenditure  reforms,  will  help  increase  and\nensure more sustainable returns on public investment.\n\nB.\n\nRisks and Safeguards\n\n111. A strong political will and commitment are essential to effective program implementation.\nMore  immediate  economic  and  social  problems,  such  as  the  reemergence  of  regional  and\ndomestic  economic  instability,  could  divert  policy  makers\u2019  attention  from  the  commitment\nneeded to enforce improved social and environmental safeguards. ADB experience with earlier\nprogram  loans  to  the  Lao  PDR  indicates  that  it  can  be  difficult  to  sustain  commitments  to\nagreed-upon  measures  as  new  priorities  emerge.  However,  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  financing\nenergy  and  transport  projects  has  also  shown  that  social,  economic,  and  environmental  risks\nwill  continue  to  be  the  subject  of  high-profile  attention  among  both  national  and  international\nstakeholders. Sustained and regular dialogue, solid analysis of the longer term benefits of social\nsafeguards  and  environmental  management,  consultative  mechanisms  with  funding  agencies\nand civil society, and public awareness raising are built into the program design to help maintain\npolitical commitment and to reduce the risk of ineffective implementation. ADB and Government\nmonitoring  of  the  Program  needs  to  extend  beyond  routine  monitoring  to  entail  an  ongoing\nprocess of assessment to ensure the continued relevance and effectiveness of program actions.\n\n112.\nThere are no blueprints for developing appropriate policies and institutions to effectively\ndesign and enforce environmental and social safeguards for energy and transport development.\nInstruments  and  best  practices  are  evolving  and  need  to  be  adapted  to  local  conditions  and\nconstraints.  In  addition,  it  can  be  expected  that  weak  institutional  capacity  and  limited  human\nresources  in  the  Lao  PDR  will  handicap  efforts  to  properly  address  environmental  and  social\nimpacts. Against this backdrop, the Program reflects an incremental approach that is tailored to\nthe  realities of limited implementation capacity, and  the  need  to  introduce  policy reforms in a\n\n\f31\n\nstructured  and  sequential  fashion.  The  Program  builds  on  substantial  TA  that  has  laid  the\ngroundwork  for  the  policy  reforms  and  built  the  capacity  to  implement  them.  The  Program  will\nalso  benefit  from  the  ongoing  TA  (footnote  14)  that  will  allow  the  Government  to  tailor  policy\nresponses during implementation. The Program has been designed to combine both immediate\npolicy  actions,  where  there  is  sufficient  basis  to  proceed,  and  flexibility  to  progressively  adapt\nand  expand  initiatives  in  response  to  increased  information,  implementation  lessons,  and\ninternational  experiences.  An  example  is  the  restructuring  of  environmental  and  social  units\nwithin  sectoral  agencies  in  the  short  term,  supplemented  by  a  broader  review  of  overall\ninstitutional arrangements for environmental management during program implementation.\n\n113. Effective  environmental  management  and  rigorous  enforcement  of  environmental  and\nsocial  safeguards  will  require  the  continued  allocation  of  adequate  resources  across  a  wide\nspectrum  of  activities,  from  public  awareness  campaigns  to  community-based  resource\nmanagement  and  biodiversity  conservation,  as  well  as  to  more  specialized  social  and\nenvironmental regulatory functions in central, sectoral, and provincial government agencies. To\nminimize  the  risk  of  insufficient  resource  allocation,  the  Program  includes  measures  to\nstrengthen  monitoring  of  compliance  with  social  and  environmental  safeguards,  studies  on\nlonger term resource needs, priority setting within provincial environmental action plans, a range\nof  measures  and  mechanisms  aimed  at  ensuring  sustainable  finance  for  environmental\nmanagement  and  social  safeguards,  and  the  priority  allocation  of  counterpart  funds  for\nProgram-related activities. In addition, program measures to track environmental allocations in\nthe  annual  budgetary  process  will  allow  greater  transparency  and  will  facilitate  continued\ndialogue.\n\nVIII.

This has caused unnecessary environmental damage and human hardship, and has\nweakened investor and funding agency confidence. These problems have arisen because of (i)\nweak policy and regulatory mechanisms; (ii) inadequate attention to the environment and social\nissues  in  sector  and  project  planning;  (iii)  inadequate  involvement  of  civil  society  in  planning,\nimplementation,  and  monitoring  activities;  (iv)  weak  enforcement  of  regulations  and  contract\nagreements  dealing  with  environmental  and  social  safeguards;  (v)  weak  capacity  of\nimplementation and monitoring agencies; and (vi) lack of sustainable financing mechanisms.\n\nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  experience  with  policy-based  lending  in  the  Lao\n2.\nPDR  has  been  partly  satisfactory.  While  there  have  been  delays  and  some  policy  reversals,\nprogram  loans  have  helped  push  forward  important  policy  and  institutional  reforms  in  the\nagriculture and finance sectors. Among the key lessons from program lending to the Lao PDR\nare the need to (i) ensure country ownership of the program, (ii) provide clear analysis for the\nrationale for proposed policy reforms, (iii) allow adequate lead time for consultative processes\nbefore  the  issuance  of  new  legislation  and/or  regulations  and  to  directly  address  enforcement\nissues, (iv) correctly assess absorptive capacity and incorporate capacity building as an integral\npart  of  the  program,  (v)  provide  well-designed  technical  assistance  to  sustain  policy  dialogue,\n(vi) focus reform efforts on a manageable package of priority reforms that are critical to realizing\nprogram  objectives,  (vii)  sequence  and  integrate  reforms  within  the  national  development\nagenda,  (viii)  recognize  limited  national  capacity  to  monitor  program  implementation,  and  (ix)\nestablish clear performance criteria to facilitate program monitoring. These lessons are reflected\nin the program design.\n\nB.\n\nRecent National Experiences in Transport and Energy Development\n\n1.\n\nPolicy and Regulatory Mechanisms\n\n3.\nBecause  of  past  inadequacies  in  the  policy,  regulatory,  and  institutional  framework,\nsocial  safeguard  and  environmental  management  measures  have  been  implemented  in  an  ad\nhoc basis, mostly in response to the requirements of financial backers. Significant progress has\nbeen  made  in  the  last  five  years  in  establishing  the  foundations  to  address  this  problem,  with\nthe National Assembly approving major legislation.\n\n4.\nMajor regulatory gaps are in providing national directions for (i) involuntary resettlement\nand  compensation,  and  (ii)  procedures  for  public  participation.  Without  such  directions,  local\ncommunities  risk  bearing  the  external  environment  and  social  costs  of  infrastructure  projects.\nWhile  regulations  on  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  issued  by  the  president  of\nScience,  Technology,  and  Environment  Agency  (STEA)  provide  a  framework  for  improved\nenvironmental  and  social  management,  resettlement  and  public  participation  issues  are  not\naddressed. Experience suggests that enforcement will remain problematic until EIA regulations\nare  issued  with  additional  administrative  weight  of  a  Prime  Minister's  decree.  Moreover,  rapid\npromulgation  of  this  new  body  of  law  has  resulted  in  some  overlap  and  inconsistencies.  For\nexample, it is unclear who is responsible for compensating personal losses in road rights-of-way\n\n\f37\n\nAppendix 2, page 2\n\nthrough  forested  areas.  Sectoral  laws  need  to  be  reviewed  to  ensure  consistency  with  the\nEnvironment Protection Law (EPL) to avoid future delays and improve enforcement.\n\n5.\nImplementing guidelines have been drafted to provide direction on how to address social\nand  environmental  issues  in  the  roads  and  hydropower  sectors.  Most  have  gone  through  an\nextensive  consultation  process,  but  have  not  yet  received  ministerial  approval.  Without\nministerial  approval,  environment  staff  will  have  to  continue  to  seek  clearance  from  higher\nauthorities \nin\nimplementing social and environmental programs.\n\nfor  routine  operations,  resulting \n\ninefficiencies  and  delays \n\nin  continuing \n\n2.\n\nSectoral Planning, Project Design, and Impact Assessment\n\na. \n\nIntegrated Area-Based Planning and Sectoral Planning\n\n6.\nTransport  and  energy  developments  have  often  taken  place  with  inadequate  account\ntaken of existing and planned developments, natural resource concentrations (e.g., biodiversity\nareas, water sources, mineral deposits, cultural sites), existing land use, and local institutional\ncapacity during infrastructure planning. This increases costs and causes that potential beneficial\nsynergies  to  be  lost,  reducing  economic  and  financial  returns.  Efforts  to  minimize  social  and\nenvironmental  impacts  at  the  project  level  must  begin  at  the  time  that  sectoral  strategies  and\nprograms are being formulated (i.e., at project identification), when location and design changes\ncan  take  place  at  minimal  cost.  Addressing  social  and  environmental  concerns  during  energy\nsector planning can facilitate identification of least-cost options. This is crucial when significant\nresettlement  may  be  required  or  when  cumulative  downstream  impacts  might  affect  major\nincome-generating  activities  such  as  agriculture,  which  will  require  significant  compensation\ncosts.  The  recent  Hydropower  Development  Strategy  Study  is  a  useful  and  precedent-setting\nstudy for the Lao PDR using this approach, but additional work is required.\n\nb. \n\nInconsistent Project-Level Social and Environmental Assessments\n\n7.\nThe quality and implementation of social and environmental assessments have a major\nbearing on whether road or hydropower projects achieve their development goals. The quality of\nsocial and environmental impact assessments and resettlement plans vary greatly because of\ninadequate  time,  expertise,  and  limited  funding.  Presently,  projects  funded  by  bilateral  and\nmultilateral sources generally require higher quality assessments, but even these assessments\nvary  greatly  in  quality.  With  the  promulgation  of  the  EPL,  and  the  planned  issuance  of\nregulations  and  other  supporting  instruments,  all  projects  will  be  required  to  meet  the  same\nnational standards and undergo the same authorizing procedures, depending on the magnitude\nand scale of the project.\n\nc. \n\nAdequacy of Baseline Information\n\n8. \nIn  the  past,  many  transport  and  energy  projects  were  identified  and  designed  with\ninadequate social, environmental, economic, institutional, spatial information in terms of (i) data\navailability,  (ii)  accessibility  of  existing  data,  (iii)  data  accuracy,  (iv)  capacity  to  integrate  data\ninto  early  design,  and  (v)  ability  to  identify  and  fill  key  data  gaps.  Integrated  area  planning\nrequires  such  information  to  be  available  prior  to  initiating  any  major  future  infrastructure\ndevelopment. Given that implementation of area-based planning processes will take time, and\nthat there are pressing infrastructure development needs, the priority is to ensure that planners\n\n\f38\n\nAppendix 2, page 3\n\nand designers are able to access existing information and minimum data sets for all provinces\nso that sectoral planning can be based on more than episodic studies.\n\n9.\nDuring the past decade, databases established in central and sectoral agencies to meet\nthe discrete needs of particular agencies proliferated. Lack of a national coordination framework\nhas  resulted  in  compatibility  problems,  overlaps  in  data  collection,  differences  in  data\ndefinitions,  and  inadequate  cataloguing  of  information.  This  perpetuates  the  inefficient  use  of\nscarce financial and human sources. There is no national reference point enabling planners to\nreadily  locate  databases.  Data  collection  standards  are  largely  absent.  Data  collection  and\nstorage  need  to  be  coordinated  and  standardized  so  that  data  are  accessible  and  useful  to\nplanners  and  decision  makers.  Initial  steps  have  been  taken  with  the  establishment  at  the\nNational Agriculture and Forestry Research Institute of a database with information on forestry,\nsoils/land  use/land  capability,  watersheds,  and  protected  areas.  However,  a  high-level\ncoordinated  effort  is  required  to  develop  a  rational  and  structured  national  information\nmanagement system that brings databases under common rules and definitions.\n\n3.\n\nPublic Involvement\n\n10.\nPublic  involvement  during  planning,  construction,  and  implementation  stages  has  been\ncarried out with no national guidelines to direct the process. STEA has informally used United\nNations/Economic  and  Social  Commission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific  guidelines  for  public\nconsultations,  but  these  are  not  practiced  universally  in  the  transport  and  energy  sectors.\nConsequently,  planners  often  failed  to  fully  understand  project  impacts  on  local  residents  and\nvillage  life.  Villagers  and  non  government  organizations  have  an  in-depth  knowledge  of  local\nresources,  capacities,  and  development  needs  that  can  help  to  improve  project  benefits  and\navoid  negative  impacts  when  identified  early  through  consultation.  At  a  broader  level,  the\nchanging regulatory and institutional environment means that people often are unaware of their\nrights  and  responsibilities.  Getting  this  message  to  people  (and  potential  project  owners,\ncontractors,  and  consultants)  throughout  the  country  needs  to  be  undertaken.  Heightened\nawareness by the population of their rights and responsibilities can help increase transparency\nand facilitate compliance.\n\n4.\n\nCompliance and Monitoring\n\n11.\nCompliance with and monitoring of social and environmental regulations in infrastructure\ndevelopment remain weak. Effective compliance and monitoring of major infrastructure projects\nare  particularly  vital  in  the  Lao  PDR  because  the  projects  are  often  located  in  remote  areas\nwhere  communities  live  at  a  subsistence  level,  and  where  there  are  often  important  biological\nresources.\n\n12.  When a dispute arises with the contractor or project owner, the reference point is not the\nEIA  or  environmental  action  plan  per  se,  but  the  contracts  entered  into  by  the  parties.  The\nGovernment  and  funding  agencies  have  faced  difficulties  in  forcing  compliance,  as  detailed\nmanagement  measures  normally  are  not  included  in  the  various  contractual  documents,  such\nas  tenders,  bills  of  quantity,  concession  agreements,  and  financial  documents.  Consequently,\nimpacts often go unmitigated and uncompensated unless additional funds are provided or until\nsufficient  other  pressure  is  brought  to  bear  on  the  offending  party,  by  which  time  the  damage\nmay be significant. Thus, environmental management plans and social action plans need to be\nclearly  incorporated  in  contractual  documents,  with   penalties   for   noncompliance  that  are\n\n\f39\n\nAppendix 2, page 4\n\nsufficiently  strong  to  ensure  that  compliance  is  in  the  best  interest  of  the  contractor  or  project\nowner.\n\n13.\nRegular  supervision  and  monitoring  are  just  as  important  for  social  and  environmental\nimpacts  as  for  the  engineering  aspects  of  project  construction.  Otherwise,  small,  easily\nremedied  problems  can  become  major  problems  requiring  costly  remedial  measures.\nSupervision  and  monitoring  of  social  and  environmental  programs  require  expertise  that  is\nmostly  lacking  in-country.  Where  project  supervisory  and  monitoring  staff  perceive  that\nmonitoring results may lead to recommendations for additional mitigation requiring funding from\nproject contingencies, or that rectifying problems may delay construction schedules, there is a\nstrong tendency to put monitoring in abeyance or to ignore or rationalize monitoring results.\n\nIndependent  monitoring  in  the  Lao  PDR  has  been  limited  to  a  few  projects,  but  has\n14.\nworked  well  for  them.  When  local  people  and  officials  have  been  involved  in  monitoring,  the\nlocal perspective has contributed to improved performance. Monitoring by local people can be a\ncost-effective  way  to  identify  impacts  early  before  they  get  out  of  hand.  Effective  supervision\nand  reporting  procedures  must  be  clearly  identified  and  undertaken  by  trained  professionals.\nThe ultimate objective should be to build an indigenous capacity for supervision and monitoring,\nthough the need for independent monitoring of large, complex projects will always remain.\n\n5.\n\nInstitutional Capacity\n\ninstitutional  capacity \n\nis  a  pervasive  constraint \n\n15. Weak \nimproving  social  and\nenvironmental  management  of  infrastructure  projects  in  the  Lao  PDR.  STEA,  through  the\nDepartment of Environment (DOE), has ultimate responsibility for ensuring project compliance\nwith  social  and  environmental  standards.  This  is  done  by  reviewing  and  approving  EIAs;\nworking with line agencies to develop relevant laws, regulations, and guidelines; and providing\nenvironmental  oversight  of  projects.  The  DOE  currently  has  a  staff  of  120,  of  which  only  a\nhandful have been trained in the fields in which they work.\n\nto \n\n16.\nDOE,  Electricit\u00e9  du  Lao  (EdL),  and  Department  of  Roads  (DOR)  have  established\nenvironment management units (EMUs) with a staff of five, four, and five, respectively, but most\nEMU  staff  are  engineers  with  no  background  in  social  or  environmental  fields.  Environment\nunits  are  situated  on  the  administrative  fringes  of  their  respective  agencies  and  have  limited\nability  to  influence  decisions.  DOR  has  provincial  offices  throughout  the  country.  EdL\u2019s  local\noffices are limited to areas where there are hydropower plants, and DOE has no local offices.\nThe  EMUs  need  to  be  restructured  and  upgraded  to  fully  functional  social  and  environmental\nmanagement  divisions  with  trained  staff,  resources,  and  direct  access  to  senior  departmental\ndecision  makers.  Interim  measures  are  needed  while  capacity  is  being  developed.  Another\nneed  is  for  the  capacity  to  identify  and  recruit  expertise  from  outside  Government  to  conduct\nnecessary  studies,  assist  in  reviewing  complex  environmental  documentation,  undertake\ncompliance  monitoring,  and  provide  the  technical  know-how  that  may  be  required  for  special\nmitigation programs. A mentoring system should be used to closely involve environmental staff\nfrom the responsible central and line agencies in such activities.\n\nThe  Government\u2019s  decentralization \n\n17. \ntransfer  major  planning,\nimplementation,  and  monitoring  responsibility  to  the  local  level.  Provincial  STEA  offices  are  to\nbe  established  in  each  province  as  Government  focal  points  for  local  environmental  action.\nThese offices are to be financed by, and report to, the provincial governor\u2019s office with technical\nsupport from STEA. Despite the formal establishment of a number of provincial offices, none is\n\ninitiative  aims \n\nto \n\n\f40\n\nAppendix 2, page 5\n\nyet fully functioning. External support to build capacity at seven provincial offices is expected in\nthe  near  term.  Some  limited  training  has  been  provided  for  central  and  local  staff,  but  a  long-\nterm effort is needed to develop the capacity that will be required during the coming decades.\n\n6.\n\nSustainable Financing\n\n18.\nSustainable  financing  is  needed  to  redress  most  of  the  cited  deficiencies.  This  is\nespecially  true  for  up-front  planning  (e.g.,  river  basin  planning),  studies  (e.g.,  fisheries),  and\nother  actions  (environmental  rehabilitation,  community  preparation)  that  are  prerequisites  for\ninformed  sector-level  decision  making,  and  are  needed  to  ensure  the  veracity  of  project-level\nenvironmental and social impact assessments. These assessments should ensure that project\ndesigns avoid or minimize adverse impacts and allow major environmental and social costs to\nbe  included  in  project  costs,  and  thus  be  borne  by  the  project  owners  rather  than  being\nexternalized.  Funds  are  also  required  to  develop  the  human  resources  needed  for  social  and\nenvironmental  management,  to  promote  greater  public  involvement  and  awareness,  and  to\nsupport  independent  compliance  monitoring.  Funds  could  also  address  long-term  and\nunforeseen impacts during project operation, though with better up-front planning, the need for\nsuch  funds  should  be  limited.  Several  sectoral  laws  and  the  EPL  mention  environment  funds.\nOther mechanisms, such as user charges, have been introduced but are not widely understood\nor practiced. This is an area worth exploring, especially in terms of a national fund that obviates\nduplication and complications inherent in the various sectoral laws.\n\n19.\nThere  is  also  need  for  a  more  transparent  system  of  public  expenditure  on\nenvironmental  protection  and  environmental  programs.  Currently  it  is  not  possible  to  relate\nenvironmental budget approvals with actual expenditures, nor is it possible to determine where\nthe funds to meet these expenditures were derived.\n\nC.\n\nRecent Experiences and Lessons from Policy-Based Lending\n\n20.\nADB has financed four program loans to the Lao PDR: two to support agriculture sector\nreforms, and two to support financial sector reforms. ADB experience with policy-based lending\nin the Lao PDR has been partly satisfactory. While there have been implementation delays and\nsome  policy  reversals,  program  loans  have  helped  push  forward  some  important  policy  and\ninstitutional reforms in the agriculture and finance sectors.  A  recent  ADB  evaluation  of  the\nsecond  agriculture  program  loan  concluded  that  the  agreed-upon  policy  reforms  were\nimplemented  and  that  agriculture  production  increased,  but  that  there  was  concern  about  the\nsustainability  of  the  policy  measures  and  the  program  was  rated  as  only  partly  successful.\nLessons  learned  from  the  program  include  the  need  to  (i)  allow  longer  lead  time  for  reform\nmeasures  that  depend  on  the  issuance  of  new  legislation  or  regulation,  (ii)  take  into  account\ninstitutional capacity when designing privatization programs, (iii) focus policy reforms on fewer\nreforms  that  can  realistically  be  implemented,  (iv)  recognize  the  executing  agency  monitoring\ncapacity  in  the  program  design,  and  (v)  establish  performance  criteria  to  facilitate  program\nassessment.\n\nA  series  of  technical  assistance  (TA)  laid  the  foundations  for  the  two  financial  sector\n21. \nprogram loans. A recent ADB evaluation concluded that despite ADB TA and program lending,\nthe  sector  remains  constrained  by  poor  loan  recovery,  management  weaknesses,  and\ninadequacies in prudential control. Basic market institutions that play a critical role in financial\nsector  development  (land  mortgage  systems,  foreclosure  systems,  auditing  and  accounting\nprofessions) remain poorly developed. The Operations Evaluation Department concluded that\n\n\f41\n\nAppendix 2, page 6\n\nADB experiences highlighted the importance of (i) correctly assessing absorptive capacity and\npolitical support for change; (ii) appropriate sequencing and priority in implementation; (iii) less\ncomprehensive TAs that require substantial achievement of prior targets for continued funding;\n(iv)  strengthened  accountability  at  all  levels  through  agreed-upon  performance  monitoring;  (v)\nclear designation of all responsibilities in TA design (terms of reference for consultants and key\ncounterparts);  (vi)  timely  and  accurate  translations;  (vii)  full-time  counterpart  assistance;  and\n(viii) avoiding overlapping TA or multi-component TAs where executing agencies lack qualified\nstaff.  ADB  and  the  Government  needed  to  better  document  and  build  on  the  results  of  earlier\nTAs  in  subsequent  assistance.  The  report  also  concluded  that  greater  continuity  of  ADB  staff\ncould  also  assist  in  developing  institutional  memory  and  expertise,  and  assist  in  reducing\ninconsistencies in policy advice.\n\n\f42\n\nAppendix 3, page 1\n\nPROGRAM FRAMEWORK\n\nDesign Summary\n\nPerformance Targets\n\nMeans of Verification\n\nAssumption/Risks\n\nGoal\nTo promote sustainable\nand equitable\ndevelopment in the Lao\nPDR\n\nPurpose\nTo improve\nenvironmental social\nmanagement in the\nenergy and transport\nsectors\n\nSustainable economic and\nsocial development while\nmaintaining environment\nquality and natural resources\nendowment\n\nState of the Environment\nreports\n\nRegular sector reviews\n\nStakeholders workshops\n\nPolitical will to address\nenvironment and social\ndevelopment continues to\ndeepen.\n\nNational policy and\nregulatory framework\nstrengthened\n\nOfficial notification,\ncatalogue of regulations,\ngovernment reports\n\nAdoption of appropriate\npolicy recommendations\nand legislation\n\nPolicy implementation\nmeasures and capacity at\nsectoral and provincial levels\n\nStakeholders' workshops,\nsector analysis, monitoring\nand evaluation reports\n\nSufficient resources\navailable and allocated\n\nObjectives\n\n1.

A combination of meetings with\nkey individuals involved in development activities at the province or district level, and workshops\nin  the  northern  (Luang  Nam  Tha),  central  (Pakxan)  and  southern  (Pakse)  regions  were\nconducted  to  discuss  environmental  and  social  management  of  large  infrastructure  projects.\nCommunity-level  discussions  at  10  project  sites  were  held  with  planners,  Government\nrepresentatives, and implementing agencies (NGOs, funding agencies, and project managers),\non  the  one  hand,  and  affected  populations  on  the  other.  The  various  views,  concerns,  and\nperspectives were analyzed and integrated into the loan design.\n\nA.\n\nNational Consultations\n\n4.\nNumerous  national  consultations  were  held  from  the  start  of  the  project  to  assess\nenvironmental  and  social  impact  issues  and  to  develop  a  draft  of  the  policy  matrix.  Ongoing\ndiscussions  with  various  Government  ministries  and  departments  were  held  throughout  the\ntechnical  assistance.  The  results  of  the  discussions  guided  the  design  of  the  loan  and  policy\nmatrix.\n\n5.\nNational workshops held at the STEA offices in Vientiane were attended by Government\nrepresentatives from STEA, energy and transportation line agencies, domestic and international\nconsultants, and NGOs. The workshop included presentation of drafts of the policy matrix and\npreliminary findings from regional and local consultations, as well as, problem-solving sessions\nand discussion groups and feedback.\n\n6.\nDuring  the  loan  fact-finding  mission,  further  public  consultations  were  conducted  at  a\nworkshop attended by Government representatives, funding agencies, and NGOs to discuss the\nAsian  Development  Bank's  (ADB\u2019s)  draft  environment  policy.  Individual  consultations  on  the\npolicy  matrix  were  also  conducted  with  key  Government  agencies  and  funding  agencies.  At\nappraisal,  a  stakeholders  workshop,  involving  the  Government,  funding  agencies,  and  NGOs\ntook  place  at  ADB's  Lao  Resident  Mission  on  13  September  2001.  The  Program  objectives,\nscope, policy matrix, and environment fund were discussed and validated.\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 6, page 2\n\nB.\n\nRegional Consultations\n\n7.\nWorkshops  were  carried  out  in  the  northern  (Luang  Nam  Tha),  central  (Pakxan),  and\nsouthern (Pakse) regions of the country with key individuals involved in development activities\nat  the  province  or  district  levels.  Formats  and  techniques  were  similar  to  those  used  in  the\nnational workshops. Meetings were also held with individuals to obtain background information\non  the  province\u2019s  development  strategies,  aid  agency  involvement,  and  priorities.

At the community level, the\nfollowing information was solicited:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nBackground information on the village or community\n\nCommunity\u2019s  experience  with  a  specific  project  intervention  or  series  of\ninterventions \u2013 satisfaction with project results\n\nAn  account  of  public  consultations  undertaken  during  the  planning  stage  and\ncarried on throughout the project implementation stage\n\n(iv) \n\nFurther needs or aspirations directly or indirectly associated with the project\n\n8. \nThe format of the consultations varied considerably, depending on the communities and\nthe  availability  of  people.  Meetings  were  held  with  village  leaders,  local  professionals  such  as\nteachers,  doctors,  and  paramedics,  as  well  as  groups  of  villagers.  The   settings   for   the\n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 6, page 3\n\nconsultations were the verandas of houses, local shops, clinics and community buildings. The\natmosphere  was  informal,  and  interviews  aimed  to  assess  the  project  components  and  obtain\ninformation  from  a  local  perspective.

Recent poverty assessments identified these communities as\nthe  poorest  in  the  country:  they  have  the  lowest  education  and  health  indicators,  and  many\nexperience  food  deficit  3-6  months  of  the  year.3  These  communities  have  limited  capacity  to\nabsorb external shocks and cope with even minor impacts and disruptions. Large infrastructure\nprojects can and sometimes do result in dismantling of production systems; loss of productive\nassets  and  income  sources;  weakening  of  community  structures,  social  networks  and  cultural\nidentity; dispersal of kin and other mutual support groups; and introduction of new diseases or\naggravation  of  endemic  diseases  such  as  malaria,  dysentery,  measles,  etc.  The  recently\nconducted PPA identified relocation due to development projects as one of the direct causes of\npoverty  in  some  of  these  communities.  Given  the  fragile  nature  of  these  groups,  even  minor\nimpacts  can  result  in  severe  long-term  economic  and  social  hardships,  exacerbating  their\nimpoverishment. It may take years for them to recover from the setback and shock.\n\nThe  Houay  Ho  project  is  one  example  of  a  completed  hydropower  project  with  no\n3.\nresettlement plan. As a result, people suffered from a severe shortage of food and arable land,\nand  insufficient  water  supply.  Remedial  action  to  alleviate  the  most  pressing  hardships  was\nfinally  undertaken  in  1999  at  an  approximate  cost  of  $2.4  million.  Likewise,  in  the  Theun\nHinboun Hydropower Project, decreased fisheries downstream and significant changes in water\nflows  have  adversely  impacted  the  livelihoods  of  approximately  26,000  people.  Remedial  and\ncorrective actions are likely to cost in the vicinity of $5 million.\n\nMistakes  such  as  these  should  not  be  repeated,  and  reactive  responses  to  correct\n4.\nproblems  as  an  after-thought  are  not  in  the  national  interest  of  the  Lao  PDR.  It  is  critical  that\nsocial  and  resettlement  impacts  are  managed  in  a  carefully  planned  and  sensitive  manner  to\nminimize  the  social  risks  associated  with  large-scale  infrastructure  development.  Failure  to  do\nso can contribute to exacerbating poverty and to potentially higher costs of correcting problems\nnot  addressed  earlier.  Efforts  aimed  at  poverty  reduction  will  be  undermined  and  the\nGovernment risks not meeting its own development goal of reducing poverty by half by the year\n2005.\n\n5.\nWhile resettlement impacts and social risks are generally more significant in hydropower\nprojects,  road  projects  are  not  immune  from  generating  such  impacts,  albeit,  often  on  a  lower\n\n                                                          \n1 With the exception of the Nam Theun 2 project and possibly Nam Ngiep 1, Rural Access Roads and East-West\n\nTransport Corridor project.\n\n2 World Bank Hydropower Development Strategy Study, Volume D: Annex 4.\n3 ADB\u2019s participatory poverty assessment (draft) and World Bank Poverty in Lao PDR. March 2001.\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 7, page 2\n\nscale.  Development  of  major  road  networks  and  rural  access  roads  also  involve  social  and\nresettlement impacts. If such impacts are not anticipated and managed, any potential benefits to\nimprove livelihoods, increase market access, improve delivery of social services, and generally\nstimulate  economic  development  will  be  lost.  The  potential  benefits  can  be  realized  only  if\nproper measures are in place to safeguard the interests of affected populations and ensure that\nbenefits are channeled to communities in the vicinity of such projects. Missed opportunities to\nenhance  the  material  and  social  welfare  of  rural  communities  could  have  potentially  broader\nadverse economic and social costs that the Lao PDR can ill afford.\n\n6.\nA bad track record of managing social and resettlement impacts can put at risk potential\nexternal  financing  of  infrastructure  development.  International  lending  agencies  review  a\ncountry\u2019s track record, as well as its legislative and policy framework in assessing the capacity\nto  carry  out  resettlement  without  adverse  affects  to  those  resettled  and  negatively  affected.\nGood social impact and resettlement plans can prevent impoverishment and can even reduce\npoverty  and  improve  livelihoods  by  building  sustainable  livelihoods.  World  Bank  and  ADB\nexperience  demonstrates  that  political  commitment  of  borrowers  in  the  form  of  laws,  policies,\nand \nin\nimplementation;  sound  social  analysis  and  appropriate  technical  expertise  in  planning\nresettlement;  and  people\u2019s  participation \nidentifying\nreestablishment  solutions,  and  implementing  them  are  factors  that  contribute  to  good\nresettlement.  The  track  record  currently  being  created,  with  the  exception  of  that  for  the\nproposed World Bank-financed hydropower Nam Theun 2 (NT2) project,4 can put at risk future\ninternational funding for large infrastructure projects in the Lao PDR.\n\nto  established  guidelines  and  procedures \n\nin  setting  resettlement  objectives, \n\nresource  allocations;  adherence \n\n7.\nWhile  it  is  possible  under  the  current  situation\u2014with  no  national  resettlement  policy  or\nguidelines in place\u2014to carry out resettlement at lesser standards, this is not considered to be in\nthe  best  national  interest.  The  Lao  PDR  requires  a  national  policy  that  enshrines  a  standard\napproach to addressing social impacts and resettlement comprehensively to include mitigation,\nmonitoring,  and  enforcing  compliance.  This  will  contribute  to  establishing  an  acceptable  track\nrecord in this field that meets national objectives and international standards.\n\nB.\n\nNational Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and Compensation for Major Projects\n\nthe \n\n8.\nThe Government is aware that it must address the glaring gap in the area of involuntary\nresettlement  and  compensation  for  major  projects.  Currently,  no  national  policy  articulates\nfundamental  principles  of  protecting  affected  people,\nuniform  standards,  although \ncompensating them, and restoring livelihoods are enshrined in the Constitution and other laws.\nHowever,  none  of  these  laws  deal  coherently  and  systematically  with  the  entire  process  of\nresettlement and compensation, or assign oversight responsibility to any Government agency or\ninstitution.  Responsibility  for  resettlement  planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring  remains\nvague. A comprehensive national policy on resettlement and compensation issued as a Prime\nMinister\u2019s  decree  is  required  to  provide  a  policy  and  institutional  framework  for  effectively\naddressing resettlement impacts that meet national objectives and international standards.\n\n9.\nA  draft  National  Resettlement  Policy  for  Major  Projects  in  the  Lao  PDR,  together  with\ndraft  Resettlement  Regulations  was  prepared  on  behalf  of  the  Government  by  the  NT2\nResettlement  Committee  as  part  of  the  NT2  Resettlement  Action  Plan  (RAP).  Following  the\npreparation of the draft policy, extensive consultations through workshops were conducted with\n                                                          \n4 Although even the NT2 project has been criticized for its inadequate attention to downstream impacts.\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 7, page 3\n\nGovernment  officials  from  national,  provincial,  and  district  levels;  local  communities;  and\nrepresentatives  of  other  organizations.  In  1999,  after  incorporation  of  comments  and\nsuggestions the draft was finalized and included in the NT2 RAP. The Government adopted the\nNT2 RAP, but not the draft national policy that provides a single nationwide standard applicable\nto all major projects in the Lao PDR.\n\n10.\nThe draft national policy on resettlement prepared under the NT2 RAP defines key terms\nand consists of (i) the objectives of the policy, such as improved livelihood, compensation and\nentitlements  of  affected  persons;  (ii)  an  outline  of  the  legal  framework;  (iii)  principles  of  the\npolicy that address the issues of compensation, vulnerable groups, and consultations; (iv) rights\nof compensation; (v) financial resources and budget; (vi) management of resettlement, that is,\nthe  administrative  and  institutional  setup;  and  (vii)  steps  in  implementing  the  policy.  The  draft\nregulations consist of requirements for statistical data collection, contents of the implementation\nschedule, a dispute resolution mechanism, and provisions for monitoring. Adoption of the policy\nwill  ensure  uniform  national  standards  for  dealing  with  social  risk  and  involuntary  resettlement\nimpacts. It will also bring the Lao PDR into line with international standards and with the World\nBank\u2019s OD.4.3 on involuntary resettlement and ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement.\n\n11.\nThe  draft  policy  is  an  important  document  as  it  clearly  outlines  the  Lao  Government\u2019s\npolicy  and  standards  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  compensation.  Formal  adoption  of  the\npolicy by the Government is critical if involuntary resettlement and compensations issues are to\nbe  addressed  in  a  consistent  and  systematic  manner  for  all  major  projects,  in  line  with  the\nGovernment\u2019s own laws and international standards. Without the adoption of the national policy\nas  a  Prime  Minister\u2019s  decree,  involuntary  resettlement  and  compensation  will  continue  to  be\nplanned  and  implemented  in  an  ad  hoc, project-by-project  basis  as  a  secondary  low-priority\nactivity. A single nationwide standard applicable to all major projects needs to be established.\nOtherwise, sectoral resettlement and compensation guidelines to be adopted by the energy and\ntransport  sectors  as  second  tranche  conditions  for  this  program  loan  may  be  compromised  if\nthey are not derived from and supported by a national policy issued in the form of a decree.\n\nC.\n\nInvoluntary Resettlement and Compensation Guidelines\n\n12.\nThe  draft  involuntary  resettlement  and  compensation  guidelines  for  the  energy  and\ntransport  sectors  attempt  to  incorporate  international  standards  on  resettlement  planning,\nimplementation, and monitoring within the Lao PDR\u2019s development context. Although not legally\nbinding, the guidelines aim to facilitate compliance with existing policies and regulations.\n\n13.\nDetailed  resettlement  guidelines  for  the  hydropower  sector  were  prepared  under  the\nWorld  Bank-assisted  Hydropower  Development  Strategy  for  the  Lao  PDR.  Consultations  and\ndiscussion of these guidelines should be conducted so that they can be finalized and issued as\na  ministerial  guideline  for  implementation  in  MIH/DOE.  Likewise,  resettlement  guidelines  were\ndeveloped  for  the  transport  sector  under  ADB\u2019s  TA  3133-LAO.5  The  latter  guidelines  need\nrefining and editing, together with stakeholder consultations, prior to finalizing and issuing them\nas a ministerial guideline for MCTCP/DOR.\n\n14.\nThe  resettlement  guidelines  in  both  sectors  outline  preconstruction  activities  at  the\nplanning  stage,  socioeconomic  and  cultural  information  required  for  planning,  institutional\narrangements  for  resettlement,  activities  in  the  implementation  phase,  resettlement  and\n                                                          \n5  TA  3133-LAO:  Strengthening Social and Environmental Management Project,  for  $950,000,  approved  on  22\n\nDecember 1998.\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 7, page 4\n\ncompensation for rights-of-way (roads and transmission lines), monitoring of resettlement in the\nimplementation and operational phases, and funding issues. Guidelines that address the issue\nof  improving  livelihoods  of  project-affected  persons  are  also  included.  Examples  of  good\npractice in the Lao PDR are outlined under many of the specific guidelines.\n\n15.\nCurrently, the guidelines are incorporated into the energy and road sector environment\nimpact assessment (EIA) guidelines and are planned to be issued along with the EIA guidelines.\nImproving international standards for addressing resettlement combined with the complexities of\naddressing  a  myriad  of  potential  social  impacts,  it  is  more  appropriate  to  issue  separate\nministerial guidelines on involuntary resettlement and compensation for the two sectors.\n\nD.\n\nNational Policy on Public Involvement and Participation\n\n16.\nIn the Lao PDR, all key legislation mentioned earlier, recognize and support to varying\ndegrees  the  need  for  public  involvement  and  participation.  The  EPL  specifically  refers  to  the\nneed  to  consult  with  project-affected  people  in  the  EIA  process  while  the  draft  resettlement\npolicy states that \u201cthe affected persons are to take part in public consultation and to participate\nin the decision process on resettlement activities and on compensation entitlements prior to the\nimplementation  of  the  process.\u201d  While  the  need  for  public  involvement  and  participation  is\nendorsed in a number of Government policies, laws, and sector strategies, a clear Government\npolicy  on  public  involvement  and  participation  that  provides  the  framework  for  the  conduct  of\nconsultations to promote participation, transparency, and accountability is absent.\n\nA major constraint to the development of appropriate and culturally suitable development\n17.\nprojects and mitigation packages for large infrastructure projects is the lack of knowledge about\nthe  needs,  priorities,  willingness,  and  capacity  of  affected  communities  to  adapt  to  new\neconomic and physical environments. In the absence of an institutional mechanism to facilitate\nroutine consultation and participation of all stakeholders, including affected communities, proper\nplanning,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  project-related  impacts  will  not  be  achieved.\nConsistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  participatory  planning  to  determine  people\u2019s\nneeds, priorities, and aspirations, the principle of public involvement and participation should be\nenshrined  in  a  broad  Government  policy.  To  encourage  and  support  routine  and  regular\nconsultation  of  communities  in  preparing  and  implementing  projects  that  affect  them,  the\nGovernment  should  issue  a  policy  statement  and  guidelines  on  public  involvement  and\nparticipation.\n\n18.\nPublic involvement guidelines for natural resource development projects were prepared\nby United Nations Development Programme/Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the\nPacific  in  1997.  Under  ADB\u2019s  TA  3133-LAO  (footnote  5),  completed  in  October  2000,  public\ninvolvement  guidelines  were  prepared  based  on  lessons  learned  from  the  NT2  experience,\nwhere considerable public participation was undertaken by the project developer in accordance\nwith  international  best  practice.  The  guidelines  include  key  definitions  and  guidance  on\nplanning,  implementing,  and  monitoring  the  involvement  of  affected  communities  during  the\nproject  cycle.  To  promote  and  institutionalize  public  involvement,  these  guidelines  should  be\nrefined after further public and stakeholder consultations, adopted, and issued by the President\nof Science, Technology and Environment Agency.\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 8\n\nPRINCIPLES FOR THE DESIGN AND ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT FUND\n\n1.
