I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Republic of Tajikistan for the Road Network Sustainability Project. \n \n2.  The project will enhance connectivity, safety, sustainability, and women\u2019s livelihoods in \nsouthern  Tajikistan  by  (i)  rehabilitating  two  existing  road  sections:  Dangara\u2013Okmazor  and \nHulbuk\u2013Kangurt; (ii) supporting the Ministry of Transport (MOT) to operationalize its road asset \nmanagement  system  (RAMS);  and  (iii)  providing  an  empowerment  program  to  women  on \nbusiness development and household financial management.1 The project augments the efforts \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help strengthen international and national road networks \nin the country, leading to inclusive economic growth and promoting regional connectivity. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Importance of road transport to Tajikistan\u2019s development. Tajikistan is landlocked and \nbordered by Afghanistan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan. \nThe country had a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of $871 in 2019, and the poverty rate \nin the country is about 27% of the total population.2 Most of the population categorized as poor \nlive in rural areas that are isolated from main economic mainstream because of underdeveloped \ntransport networks. Because of underdeveloped railway and aviation subsectors, the country \nrelies heavily on road transport for international and domestic movement of goods and people. \n \n4.  Need for balanced development of the road network. The road network under the \nMOT\u2019s jurisdiction totals 14,339 kilometers (km), comprising 3,348 km of international roads \n(23%), 2,127 km of national roads (15%), and 8,864 km of local roads (62%). About 77% of roads \nare paved.3 To strengthen connectivity with surrounding countries, the government has prioritized \nimproving international highway networks, which comprise Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation (CAREC) corridors 2, 3, 5, and 6 and Asian Highway (AH) 7, AH65, and AH66.4 \nMost of these international roads are in good or fair condition. On the other hand, national roads \nhave  deteriorated  and  remain  unsafe  because  of  disaster-prone  topography,  dysfunctional \nmaintenance systems, overloaded trucks, and the poor quality of the original construction works \ncarried out in the 1970s. \n \n5.  Weak economic and physical connectivity in southern Tajikistan. Unbalanced road \ndevelopment is reflected in the poor state of roads in the southern oblast (province) of Khatlon. \nWith 37.2% of the country\u2019s population, it is the country\u2019s most populous oblast. It is also the \ncountry\u2019s largest agricultural producer. For these reasons, the oblast is critical to the overall \neconomic growth of Tajikistan. Meanwhile, the poverty rate in the oblast is the highest in the \n \n1  The Asian Development Bank provided small-scale transaction technical assistance to prepare the project: ADB. \n2020. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Tajikistan for Preparing the Road Network Sustainability Project. \nManila. \n2  World Bank. World Bank Open Data: GDP per capita [current US$] of Tajikistan (accessed 3 October 2020); and \nADB. 2020. Basic Statistics 2020. Manila. \n3  Sector Assessment (Summary): Transport (Road Transport [Nonurban]) (accessible from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 2). \n4  The Asian Highway Network is a regional initiative to improve major road networks among countries in Asia and \nEurope, and is overseen by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific. \n ", "2 \ncountry, while the human development and income indexes are the lowest.5 Poor transport \ninfrastructure is a key factor behind these socioeconomic challenges. \n \n6.  Several international corridors traverse South Tajikistan, including AH66 and CAREC \ncorridors 5 and 6. Most of the corridors have been rehabilitated with the assistance of ADB and \nother development partners and facilitate the region\u2019s economic development by linking major \neconomic centers.6 However, national roads connecting these international corridors have not \nbeen well developed, limiting the local population\u2019s use of these corridors. The project will address \nthe immediate needs for strengthening domestic connectivity by improving two national road \nsections: (i) Dangara\u2013Okmazor and (ii) Hulbuk\u2013Kangurt. These sections are vital as they both \nlink up with AH66 (at Dangara and Hulbuk). Furthermore, the Dangara\u2013Okmazor section is part \nof a key corridor intersecting with CAREC corridors 5 and 6 at Bokhtar; and the Hulbuk\u2013Kangurt \nsection serves as a local economic corridor passing through the region\u2019s key economic centers. \nTraffic volume on the Hulbuk\u2013Kangurt road is about 1,300 vehicles per day in 2020, while traffic \nvolume on the Dangara\u2013Okmazor section is about 4,200 vehicles per day.7 At completion, the \nsections will form a new economic network around Dangara, which the government plans to \ndevelop as the oblast\u2019s new capital city.8 Despite their strategic importance, these sections have \nnot been equipped with sufficient road safety facilities and disaster-proof measures. Inadequate \nroad maintenance has led to their continuous deterioration and to heavy dust pollution. Improving \nthe sections would strengthen economic connectivity in southern Tajikistan, enhance people\u2019s \naccess to socioeconomic opportunities, and reduce local dust pollution. \n \n7.  Immediate  need  to  operationalize  road  asset  management  system. \nUnderdevelopment of the country\u2019s road network has been compounded by long-standing neglect \nof road maintenance, with insufficient budget allocations and an absence of a well-developed \nRAMS. The annual budget for routine road maintenance throughout the year and snow removal \nduring winter seasons has risen from TJS34.0 million in 2010 to TJS73.2 million in 2020. However, \nthis accounts for only about 0.1% of GDP, and is insufficient to cover actual needs. Given the \nresource  constraints,  several  development  partners,  including  ADB,  have  assisted  the \ngovernment in optimizing the use of limited resources and eliminating the inefficiencies arising \nfrom mechanical allocation of the budget. With ADB support, the country has introduced a RAMS \nand piloted performance-based road maintenance.9 The pilot revealed several issues that need \nto be overcome prior to expanding such schemes: (i) strengthening the government\u2019s capacity for \nproper implementation, (ii) strengthening local contractors\u2019 capacities to carry out maintenance, \nand (iii) pursuing flexibility in contracting schemes. To overcome such challenges in a step-wise \nmanner, the government, with support from ADB, is developing a RAMS Action Program that will \ninstitutionalize a RAMS and establish a dedicated road maintenance fund to secure budget for \nroad maintenance. The government is expected to approve the RAMS Action Program in 2020. \nA dedicated RAMS unit is expected to be established by the end of 2020 to implement the RAMS \nAction Program, while the road maintenance fund will be established by June 2024.  \n \n8.  Critical need to improve road safety. The World Health Organization estimates that \nthere were 1,577 fatalities from road crashes in 2016, which equates to 18.1 fatalities per 100,000 \n \n5  Global Data Lab: GDL Area Profiles (accessed 3 October 2020). \n6  Sector Assessment (Summary): Transport (Road Transport [Nonurban]) (accessible from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 2).  \n7  The traffic volume of each section was counted in May 2020 by the due diligence consultant (footnote 35). \n8  Rehabilitation of the Bokhtar\u2013Okmazor section is planned after the project to complete the entire corridor. The \nDangara\u2013Kangurt section was rehabilitated in 2014 with financial assistance from the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n9  ADB. 2013. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant to the Republic \nof Tajikistan for the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Corridors 3 and 5 Enhancement Project. Manila. \n ", "3 \npeople.10 Costs associated with road crashes equate to about 4.3% of Tajikistan\u2019s GDP.11 These \nfigures are slightly higher than those of other CAREC member countries.12 This suggests a need \nto raise people\u2019s awareness of road safety, promote behavioral change, and embed crash \nprevention measures in road infrastructure and roadside facilities. Under the ongoing projects \n(footnote 6), ADB has supported the MOT in developing guidelines on safe road design and \nrectifying black spots on selected national roads. The guidelines were developed in line with \ninternational best practices collated through CAREC.13 \n \n9.  Addressing disaster risk. Tajikistan is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate \nchange in Central Asia. Its unique terrain, geology, and hydrological features make it prone to \nnatural disasters and hazards. Specific to the project area, the climate change assessment \nidentified rising temperatures and intense precipitation as major potential causes of extreme \nclimate events, such as landslides and mudflows.14 Climate adaptation features were therefore \nincorporated into the design of the project roads. \n \n10.  Alignment with government strategies. The project is aligned with the government\u2019s \nNational Development Strategy, which targets sustainable economic growth of Tajikistan.15 The \nproject is also in line with the Transport Sector Master Plan,16 developed with ADB assistance in \n2011 as the basis for the government\u2019s strategic sector planning. The project will contribute \ndirectly to the State Program on Transport Sector Development, 2010\u20132025,17 which includes a \nlist of short-, medium-, and long-term investments that is regularly reviewed and updated, and \naims to further the country\u2019s transport sector development by enhancing the efficiencies of various \ntransport modes, maximizing the country\u2019s transit potential, and increasing the competitiveness \nof transport services. Furthermore, the project will address climate vulnerability (para. 9) in \naccordance with Tajikistan\u2019s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution,18 which emphasizes \nthe need for incorporating climate adaptation measures in the design of transport infrastructure. \nThe project also supports the United Nations\u2019 Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked \nDeveloping Countries for the Decade of 2014\u20132024.19 \n \n11.  Strategic fit. The project is fully aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.20 It supports four of \nthe  strategy\u2019s  seven  operational  priorities:  (i)  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing \ninequalities (para. 36); (ii) accelerating progress in gender equality (para. 37); (iii) tackling climate \nchange, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability \n(para. 26); and (iv) fostering regional cooperation and integration, prioritizing countries that face \ngeographic and disaster-related vulnerabilities (paras. 9 and 12).

Promoting regional connectivity. The project will contribute to the goals of CAREC \n203023 and the CAREC Transport Strategy 2030 by improving connectivity and improving the \ncompetitiveness of key national roads that connect to international corridors (para. 6).24 In 2019, \nTajikistan acceded to the Convention on the Contract for the International Carriage of Goods by \nRoad. With the support of ADB, Tajikistan has promoted national single window systems that \nhave increased trade volumes and diversified products transported along the country\u2019s roads.25 \nThe project will help accelerate the momentum for turning southern Tajikistan into an international \nand domestic transit and business hub. \n \n13.  Lessons.  Lessons  from  previous  and  ongoing  projects  (footnote  6)  include:  (i)  the \naccuracy of engineering designs and cost estimates for road infrastructure and associated \nfacilities should be ensured during project appraisal, (ii) executing and implementation agencies \nshould have a proper understanding of ADB\u2019s procurement procedures and requirements, and \n(iii) developing a RAMS is an urgent need for Tajikistan\u2019s road transport subsector to sustain the \nquality of the improved international highway network. \n \n14.  Impact of coronavirus disease. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has \nweakened Tajikistan\u2019s economy and increased unemployment and poverty. In response to \nCOVID-19, the government imposed a nationwide lockdown that lasted about 2 months, with \nclosures of all airports. Overseas remittances, international trade, and foreign direct investment \nall declined.26 Food prices increased.27 The pandemic has exacerbated the many socioeconomic \nchallenges in the project area, which relies heavily on external support being delivered via the \nexisting road network. The project-supported road improvements will be essential to reversing the \nrecent economic downward trend. Measures are in place to minimize the impact of COVID-19 on \nproject implementation. Under the project, civil works will commence in early 2021, by which time \nit is expected that the spread of COVID-19 will have subsided because of the government\u2019s \ncontinuing response measures. However, if the spread of COVID-19 continues and domestic and \ninternational travel remain restricted, the MOT and the Project Implementation Unit for Roads \nRehabilitation (PIURR: the project\u2019s implementation agency) will enact measures to steadily \nmobilize resources at a reduced pace, so that construction works can continue without threatening \nthe health and safety of construction workers. After completion, the improved project roads will \nplay an essential role in delivering basic needs and reviving the economy in the project area. \n \n \n21 ADB. 2016.

The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) economic growth promoted (footnote \n \n15), and (ii) safe and competitive connectivity established across the CAREC region (footnote \n24). The project will have the following outcome: safety and reliability of road network improved \nin southern Tajikistan.28  \n \n16.  Output  1:  Roads  in  southern  Tajikistan  improved.  This  output  will  consist  of  \n(i) rehabilitating the two-lane road sections Dangara\u2013Okmazor (28.7 km) and Hulbuk\u2013Kangurt \n(59.5 km) on their existing alignments, and (ii) carrying out a road-safety-awareness campaign \nfor  roadside  residents.  The  two  road  sections  will  be  rehabilitated  following  their  existing \nclassifications based on SNIPs.29 The classification of the Dangara\u2013Okmazor section is category \nIII (road width of 3.5 meters [m] for each lane and 2.5 m paved shoulders). The Hulbuk\u2013Kangurt \nsection will be split at Temurmalik into two subsections: the Hulbuk\u2013Temurmalik section is \ncategory III, while Temurmalik\u2013Kangurt section is category IV (width of 3 m for each lane and  \n2 m paved shoulders). The average travel speed on project road sections is expected to increase \nfrom 58 km per hour to 73 km per hour.  \n \n17.  Output 2: Road asset management system database developed. This output will be \naligned  with  the  MOT\u2019s  RAMS  Action  Program  (para.  7)  and  will  support  the  MOT  in \noperationalizing its RAMS by developing a data inventory of the country\u2019s arterial highways. The \nMOT maintains no comprehensive inventory, making it difficult to estimate maintenance needs \nand plan the optimal use of available resources. ADB has coordinated with development partners \nin developing a framework for a RAMS database.30 An international consultancy firm will be \nrecruited to help the RAMS unit to collect condition data for the selected highways. The firm will \nprovide hands-on training to the RAMS unit staff on (i) preparing formats for data collection,  \n(ii) carrying out road condition surveys, (iii) validating the collected data for entering into the \ndatabase, and (iv) analyzing the data as the basis for annual and multiyear planning. \n \n18.  Output 3: Women\u2019s access to socioeconomic opportunities enhanced. This output \nwill promote women\u2019s participation in economic activities in the project area through three \ncomponents:  (i)  designing  and  implementing  a  knowledge  distribution  program  on \nentrepreneurship and household financial management, (ii) providing skills training on business \ndevelopment  and  income-generation  activities  in  areas  of  high  business  demand,  and  \n(iii) facilitating local women\u2019s access to grants for starting new business. A local consulting firm \nwill help implement the output in coordination with the National Committee of Women and Family \nAffairs. As part of the first component, mobile phone applications or short message services will \nbe devised to distribute the contents of the knowledge distribution program, enabling local women \nto obtain information at their convenience.31 Supplementary workshops will be held regularly to \nrecap the knowledge distributed and foster mutual-aid networks among the participants. \n \n19.  Lessons from previous and ongoing projects (para. 13) were taken into account in the \ndesign of outputs 1\u20133. Civil works cost estimates were based on the detailed engineering design \n \n28 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n29 SNIP is the construction norms and standards that were developed during the Soviet period. \n30 The MOT received technical and financial assistance in developing a framework for a RAMS database from ADB. \n2016.

During appraisal, ADB held a \nprocurement workshop to staff of the MOT and PIURR to enhance their knowledge of ADB\u2019s \nprocurement guidelines and policies. To ensure the effectiveness of output 2, ADB has facilitated \ndialogue among government agencies and other financiers on the development of the MOT\u2019s \nRAMS. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n20.  The project will build on ADB\u2019s successful implementation of various road projects in \nTajikistan. First, the project will ensure that adequate features on climate change adaptation, \ndisaster risk management, and road safety are incorporated into the engineering design. Second, \nthe project will help accelerate the government\u2019s ongoing RAMS-related initiatives that are \nsupported by ADB. The project will help enhance the functionality of the RAMS database, which \nis being developed in accordance with the RAMS Action Program (para. 7). Third, the project will \nintroduce gender-inclusive measures as outlined in the gender action plan by incorporating the \nneeds of women residing along the project roads.32 ADB is the largest development partner in \nTajikistan\u2019s transport sector and has been actively involved in coordinating with development \npartners to improve the country\u2019s transport networks and introduce the RAMS (footnote 3). \n \nD.

Implementation Arrangements\n24. The MOT will be the executing agency and PIURR will be the implementing agency. The\nimplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM.\n25. The PIURR will be assisted during implementation by the relevant MOT departments and\nby the construction supervision and implementation support consultants. All contracts will be\nprocured in accordance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time),\nProcurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time), and its\nassociated staff instructions.

", "8 \nIII. DUE DILIGENCE\nA. Technical\n26. Road design. The rehabilitation of roads will be carried out along existing rights-of-way\n(without  involving  expansion)  as  road  widths  have  been  confirmed  to  be  sufficient  to\naccommodate the anticipated increases in traffic volumes. Asphalt concrete surfacing will be\nused, and its design was confirmed to suit existing roadbed soil conditions and to be able to\nwithstand the forecasted traffic load. The engineering design will incorporate climate-resilient\nfeatures to sustain the quality of the project roads and roadside facilities during their design life.\nSuch features are incorporated in the design of retaining walls, drainages and ditches based on\nthe possibility of extreme precipitation and subsequent landslides or mudflows in the next 100\nyears. Roadside facilities such as shoulders, sidewalks, and lighting will be improved or newly\ninstalled to ensure road users\u2019 safety and comfort. These features have been selected in close\ncoordination with local traffic police.\nB. Economic and Financial Viability\n27. The  economic  evaluation  of  the  project  has  been  undertaken  using  the  highway\ndevelopment and management model, in accordance with ADB guidelines.34 The due diligence\nconsultant obtained traffic volumes for the evaluation in May 2020.35 An economic evaluation was\nmade for each road section, and these were combined to confirm the project\u2019s overall economic\nviability. The incremental benefits of reductions in vehicle operating costs, travel times, and\nemissions were compared with the capital costs and changes in operation and maintenance costs\nover a 27-year appraisal period, comprising 2 years for civil works and 25 years for operation.\nRoad safety benefits were excluded from the analysis since credible data was not available. All\nproject benefits were expressed in 2020 economic prices, in United States dollars, using the world\nprice numeraire.\n28. The results indicate that the combined project is economically viable, with an economic\ninternal rate of return of 15.7%, a benefit\u2013cost ratio of 1.9, and a net present value of $46.4\nmillion.36 Sensitivity tests confirmed that the combined project would remain feasible should the\nenvisaged project costs increase by 20% or benefits decline by 20%.37\nC. Sustainability\n29. The project roads will not be tolled and will not generate revenue. After civil works are\ncompleted, they will be maintained under the government\u2019s maintenance program. The required\nroutine maintenance expenditure for the project roads will total about $1,900 per km per year after\ncompletion. The current budget allocation for the country\u2019s road network will barely cover this\nroutine maintenance, let alone the additional periodic maintenance that will be required every 5\u2013\n7  years.  Insufficient  maintenance  funds  is  by  far  the  most  serious  issue  threatening  the\nsustainability of the project roads.\n34 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n35 The incumbent construction supervision consultant (CSC) under an ongoing project\u2014the Central Asia Regional \nEconomic Cooperation Corridors 2, 5, and 6 (Dushanbe\u2013Kurgonteppa) Road Project\u2014assisted the MOT in carrying \nout due diligence for the project. \n36 The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for Dangara\u2013Okmazor section is 24.5%, while the EIRR for the Hulbuk\u2013\nKangurt section is 9.0%. \n37 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "9 \n30. To tackle these long-standing challenges, the government, in parallel with its effort to\nsecure more budget resources for road maintenance, has redoubled its efforts to establish a\nRAMS through its 5-year RAMS Action Program (para. 7). The program clearly outlines the\nfollowing directions to transform the country\u2019s road maintenance system: (i) establishing a RAMS\nunit within the MOT with the sole responsibility to implement the program; (ii) streamlining the\nbudgetary system by establishing a dedicated road maintenance fund to secure budget funds for\nroad maintenance; and (iii) building a database to store the profiles of international and national\nroads, which will help the government identify needs for timely maintenance and program the\nannual  maintenance  plan  and  budget.  The  project  will  directly  contribute  to  item  (iii).\nImplementation of the RAMS Action Program is expected to be completed by 2024\u2014the year of\nthis project\u2019s scheduled completion. Thus, by the time of project completion, the MOT will have\nimproved its fiscal and institutional capacity to meet recurrent expenditures and adequately\noperate and maintain the project roads over the economic life of the project.38\nD. Governance\n31. Financial management. The due diligence consultant (footnote 35) undertook a financial\nmanagement assessment of the PIURR in June 2020, confirming that its financial management\narrangement is appropriate to implement the project in compliance with ADB requirements. The\nassessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is substantial because of the PIURR\u2019s existing\nfinancial management system, which remains the same from the previous assessment. The\nPIURR has built on its experience implementing ADB-financed projects, and improvements have\nbeen made with an adequate accounting manual in place and accounting software (1C)39 fully\noperationalized.  PIURR\u2019s  residual  weaknesses  in  financial  management  are  (i)  insufficient\nfinancial management skills, including limited technical capacity and experience to transition to\nInternational  Financial  Reporting  Standards;  (ii)  inadequate  formalization  of  operational\nprocedures, including no explicit policy to report inappropriate asset management; (iii) absence\nof  internal  audit  function;  and  (iv)  an  unintegrated  accounting  system.  To  mitigate  such\nweaknesses, the PIURR will (i) hire adequately qualified and skilled financial management staff\nto support the transition to International Financial Reporting Standards and undertake training on\nfinancial management, (ii) develop and implement a comprehensive operations manual, (iii) bring\nitself within the scope of the MOT\u2019s internal audit process in consultation with the MOT and MOF,\nand (iv) accelerate the integration of the accounting system. The PIURR will maintain adequate\nand separate project records and accounts, which will be audited annually by independent\nauditors.\n32. Procurement. ADB prepared an updated project procurement risk assessment (PPRA)\nin June 2020 in accordance with ADB guidelines.40 The PPRA examined the PIURR\u2019s capacity\nwith  regard  to  organization  and  staffing,  information  management,  procurement  practices,\ncomplaint and dispute resolution mechanisms, and accountability measures. The updated PPRA\nconcluded that the procurement risk is moderate because (i) a growing portfolio of externally\nfunded projects may stretch the staffing resources of the PIURR, (ii) record management systems\nand procedures have been paper-based, and need to be improved by introducing electronic\nsystems, and (iii) the PIURR lacks adequate internal procurement and contract administration\nguidelines and manuals to refer to during project implementation, which may cause ad hoc and\n38 Tolling options will be developed together with the preparation of priority and viable tolling projects under ADB. 2019. \nReport and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant to the Republic of Tajikistan: \nfor the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Corridors 2, 3, and 5 (Obigarm\u2013Nurobod) Road Project. Manila. \n39 1C is an international accounting software which is widely used in the Commonwealth of Independent States. \n40 Based on the PPRA carried out for a previous project approved in 2019 (footnote 38). ", "10 \ninconsistent responses. The PPRA concluded that, if these issues are addressed, the PIURR has \nsufficient procurement capacity to implement the project. \n33. The strategy guiding procurement for the project has been to define works packaging that\nwill allow local contractors to bid for at least one contract without discouraging international\ncontractors to bid for that or other contracts. Thus, for the civil works, procurement will be\nconducted for two contract packages (one with two lots for the Hulbuk\u2013Kangurt section, and the\nother with one lot for Dangara\u2013Okmazor section) through open competitive bidding using the one-\nstage,  two-envelope  method,  with  each  contract  to  be  awarded  to  the  lowest  evaluated\nsubstantially responsive bidder. For the consultant services under the project, the quality- and\ncost-based selection approach (90% for quality and 10% for cost) will be used for outputs 1 and\n2, and fixed budget selection will be used for output 3. The advertisements for all contracts will be\nposted in the third and fourth quarters of 2020.\n34. Institutional capacity. The MOT and PIURR have an adequate understanding of ADB\u2019s\npolicies and guidelines on procurement and consultant recruitment, safeguards, and financial\nmanagement, based on their 2 decades of experience implementing ADB-supported transport\nprojects. The PIURR will be assisted during implementation by the construction supervision\nconsultant (CSC) for output 1, implementation support consultants for outputs 2 and 3, and the\nrelevant MOT departments. ADB will continue to assist the MOT and PIURR to ensure that the\nproject will be implemented in accordance with relevant ADB policies and procedures.\n35. Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained\nto and discussed with the government, the MOT, and the PIURR. The specific policy requirements\nand supplementary measures are described in the PAM.\nE. Poverty, Social, and Gender\n36. With help of the due diligence consultant, the government carried out socioeconomic\nsurveys and a gender assessment in May\u2013July 2020 to identify the issues and needs of the\npopulation, including women, residing along the project roads.41 The project area is in the poorest\nand most populous oblast in the country (para. 5). The majority of the population along the project\nroads are engaged in the informal economy, mainly farming activities and/or selling agricultural\ncommodities  (cotton,  vegetables,  and  fruits)  or  hand-made  products  at  markets.  Such  an\neconomic structure has been observed as being vulnerable to external shocks like COVID-19.42\nImproving the project roads will help attract external traders from outside the project area and\nboost and diversify trade to generate more economic opportunities in a sustainable manner. The\nproject roads and roadside facilities will reduce road traffic fatalities and injuries, and will improve\nthe comfort and reliability of road travel for all users.43\n37. The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. The project will address\ngender issues identified through group discussions focused on women during project preparation.\nIt was confirmed that women residing along the project roads are concerned about inadequate\nroad safety measures on the project roads and limited opportunities to participate in the local\n41 Socioeconomic surveys were carried out using a structured questionnaire with 332 households along the Hulbuk\u2013\nKangurt section and 107 households along the Dangara\u2013Okmazor section, of which 16.6% were female respondents. \nIn addition, 300 women were interviewed during focus group discussions using semi-structured questionnaires. \n42 The median daily income among those surveyed was TJS66.67 (equivalent to $6.47) for the Hulbuk\u2013Kangurt section \nand TJS50 (equivalent to $4.85) for the Dangara\u2013Okmazor section; both figures are lower than the oblast\u2019s gross \nnational income of $9.53 (2018 figure, footnote 5). \n43 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "11 \neconomy. The gender action plan (footnote 32) will include provisions that (i) support gender-\nresponsive and socially inclusive features to be included in the project roads and roadside \nfacilities, such as rest areas and bus stops equipped with gender-separated spaces; and (ii) \nfacilitate  the  distribution  of  knowledge  and  resources  to  enhance  women\u2019s  access  to \nsocioeconomic opportunities and strengthen their economic status. The CSC will employ a gender \nspecialist to help the PIURR implement item (i), while a local consultant will be recruited to \nimplement  item  (ii).  These  consultants  will  be  responsible  for  periodically  monitoring  and \ndocumenting implementation progress against the gender action plan. \nF. Safeguards\n38. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard\ncategories are as follows.44\n39. Environment (category B). The draft initial environmental examinations for both project\nroads with environmental management plans were disclosed in September 2020. The draft initial\nenvironmental examinations confirmed that there will be only insignificant environmental impacts,\nwhich can be either avoided or adequately mitigated. During construction, temporary, site-specific\nimpacts  may  arise  from  construction  works,  and  from  mining  and  hauling  of  construction\nmaterials. These impacts include dust and noise pollution, waste and equipment on local roads,\nand other occupational health and safety hazards. Such impacts will be addressed in site-specific\nenvironmental management plans to be prepared by the civil works contractors after mobilization.\nThe PIURR has appointed a staff member responsible for supervising the project\u2019s compliance\nwith environmental safeguards. No civil works will be allowed before the CSC and the PIURR\napprove the site-specific environmental management plans. All statutory permits and clearances\nwill be obtained prior to the awarding of the works contracts. Stakeholder engagement and\nconsultations will continue throughout implementation. A grievance redress mechanism will be\nestablished to handle any project-related grievances or complaints, which the CSC will monitor\nand  document.  The  MOT  will  submit  biannual  environmental  monitoring  reports  during\nimplementation.\n40. Involuntary resettlement (category B). Civil works will generally follow alignments within\nexisting rights-of-way. Impacts will generally be limited to loss of marginal portions of agricultural,\nresidential, and commercial land; fences; secondary structures; and trees. Project works will affect\n18 people and two legal entities along the Dangara\u2013Okmazor section and 371 people and 8 legal\nentities along the Hulbuk\u2013Kangurt section. Of these, eight business owners and two farmers are\nconsidered severely affected. The eight business owners will lose commercial structures and the\ntwo farmers will lose more than 10% of their dehkan farms.45 All other affected persons are\nconsidered  marginally  affected.  The  MOT  conducted  detailed  measurement,  census,  and\nsocioeconomic surveys, and prepared draft land acquisition and resettlement plans (LARPs) for\nboth road sections based on ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and Tajikistan regulations. The\nMOT submitted the LARPs to ADB and they were disclosed on the ADB website in September\n2020. The LARPs will be finalized after independent valuations are completed and follow-up\nconsultations are held.46\n44 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n45 Dehkan farm is a plot of land allocated by the government to an individual, group of individuals, or legal entity for \nuse-rights for agriculture. \n46 These are conditions for awarding civil works, as stipulated in the draft grant agreement. The full disbursement of \ncompensation related to land acquisition and resettlement and the submission of a LARP implementation compliance \nreport summarizing the disbursement will be a condition for handing over of sites for civil works. ", "12 \n41. Indigenous peoples (category C). There are no indigenous peoples in the project area\nas defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. No further action will be required.\nG.
