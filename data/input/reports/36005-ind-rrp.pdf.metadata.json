The  summary  IEE  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix E.  \n   \nProject Description  The Project will improve the connectivity of the state road network \nin Chhattisgarh. It will provide a more effective institutional and \npolicy framework; and the capacity to ensure that investments in \nroads are implemented successfully, and that project-generated \nimpacts  in  road  development  are  sustained  through  improved \ngovernance and accountability. \n   \nRationale  The  Public  Works  Department,  Government  of  Chhattisgarh \n(PWDGOC), with its existing institutional and technical capability \nand capacity, is reaching its limit in effective sector management \nand efficient management of investments in state roads. This, and \nthe  inherited  10  years  of  neglect  of  investment  in  road \nimprovement and maintenance, has caused serious deterioration \nof most state roads. The riding quality of most roads ranges from \npoor to very poor. Poor road quality has undermined the long-term \ngrowth  potential  of  Chhattisgarh  economy.  Bad  roads  have \nincreased  transport  capacity  bottlenecks,  and  meant  poorer \ntransport services for the entire economy, especially the rural poor \nand tribal populations.  \n \n  Better management of the road sector is crucial to support the \npolicy  initiative  of  the  Government  of  Chhattisgarh  (GOC)  to \nimprove this situation. Better road management will improve the \ninstitutional  and  policy  framework.    It  will  help  ensure  that \ninvestments  in  road  sector  development  are  successfully \nimplemented and the road improvements generated by the Project \ncan be sustained through better governance and accountability. \nThe road sector investment is expected to help GOC significantly \nimprove  the  connectivity  of  Chhattisgarh\u2019s  road  network,  to \ndirectly  support  the  state\u2019s  economic  growth.  Meanwhile,  the \ninvestment will also provide a vehicle through which Chhattisgarh \ncan establish a transparent and conducive environment for more \ncompetition and increased private sector participation in the road \nsector.  That  in  turn,  will  ensure  better  infrastructure  and \ndecreased recurrent costs for road maintenance over the medium \nand long terms.  That will allow higher expenditures for priority \nsocial sectors, and for poverty reduction. ", "iv   \n   \nObjectives and Scope  The main objective of the Project is to support economic growth \nand  reduce  poverty  by  providing  improved  connectivity  and \naccess  to  development  opportunities  and  social  services, \nincluding  health  and  education.  The  Project  will  also  support \nGOC\u2019s initiative to improve state management of the road sector \nby improving effectiveness and efficiency. Thus, the Project will \nprovide  the  capacity  required  to  ensure  the  efficiency  and \nsustainability of road investments and development to support \nsocial and economic development. The objective will be achieved \nthrough  (i)  improving  priority  state  roads  between  economic \ngrowth centers and rural areas, (ii) instituting measures to improve \ngovernance and accountability for road sector management, (iii) \nimproving sector capability and building capacity for more efficient \nresource  and  asset  management,  and  (iv)  initiating  steps  to \nincrease  private  sector  participation  in  road  development  and \nmaintenance projects. \n \nThe  Project,  through  sector  lending  modality,  will  finance \nimprovement of about 1,700 km of state roads in Chhattisgarh. It \nwill improve the connectivity of the road network, and of priority \nroad links among national highways, state highways, and rural \nroads to improve access of rural and underdeveloped populations \nto the mainstream economy and development opportunities. The \nProject  will  defer  huge  reconstruction  costs  that  will  result  if \nimprovement and rehabilitation are not undertaken immediately. It \nwill also complement the Rural Roads Sector I Project of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). \n \nConsulting services will be provided to help PWDGOC prepare \nand implement the road improvement subprojects, construction \nsupervision, capacity building and training in project management \nand quality control. Consulting services will also be provided to \nhelp GOC improve the institutional and policy frameworks of the \nstate  road  institutions  for  good  governance  and  better \naccountability of sector management, (ii) establishing sustainable \nsystems of asset management, and (iii) capacity building and \ntraining in modern sector management and operation. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total Project cost in 2003 prices is estimated at $285.7 million \nequivalent, of which the foreign exchange cost is estimated at \n$199.52 million, or 70%. The local currency cost, including taxes \nand duties, is estimated at $86.18 million equivalent, or 30% of \nthe total. The cost estimate includes contingencies; a front-end \nfee of 0.5% of the total loan amount of the Project; and interest \ncharge during construction (IDC); and the commitment charge.  \n   \n ", "  v\nFinancing Plan  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $180 million from its \nordinary capital resources, which will be 63% of the total project \ncost.  The  loan  will  finance:  (i)  the  Project\u2019s  entire  foreign \nexchange cost, excluding front-end fee, the commitment charge, \nand interest during construction; and (ii) part of the local currency \ncosts for domestic consulting services to prepare the subprojects \nto be selected during project implementation, and to help GOC \nimplement the institutional reform. \n   \n  GOC will provide the remaining local currency cost of about $85.7 \nmillion equivalent. Appendix 6 summarizes the proposed Project \nfinancing  plan.  GOC  has  assured  that  it  will  secure  the \ncounterpart financing as committed. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $180,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will \nbe provided under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility. The loan \nwill have a 25-year term, including a 5-year grace period; an \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility; a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum; a \nfront-end fee of 0.5%; and other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft Loan and Project Agreements. \n  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  July 2009 \n   \nEstimated Project  January 2009 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency   PWDGOC will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the Project.  \n   \nImplementation  Within PWDGOC, the Agency for Road Development (ARD) will \nArrangements  be established to be responsible for the overall project execution \nand  supervision.  The  Project  Implementation  Unit  (PIU), \nestablished in September 2003, will be responsible for day-to-day \nimplementation. The PIU field offices will be established at key \nlocations to help implement and manage the improvement works. \n \nThe Road Management Committee (RMC) to be formed in March \n2004, will oversee and provide policy support and coordination for \ntimely implementation of institutional reform and capacity building, \nand help monitor project implementation. \n   \nProcurement  ADB has approved advance procurement action for the sample \nsubproject civil works. All procurement to be financed under the \nProject will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement.  \n   \n ", "vi   \nConsulting Services  Consulting  services  to  be  financed  under  the  Project  will  be \nrecruited using quality- and cost-based selection in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and other \nprocedures satisfactory to ADB for the recruitment of domestic \nconsultants. \n   \nProject Benefits and  Social  and  poverty  assessments  show  that  the  main  project \nBeneficiaries  beneficiaries will be people living in areas that are predominantly \nagricultural,  rural,  and  economically  backward.  The  Project  is \nexpected to benefit 1.7 million people in a 30-km zone of influence \naround the state roads to be improved. Of these, an estimated \n0.77 million people, or 45%, will be direct beneficiaries. \n \nThe main quantifiable benefits of the Project are (i) savings in \nvehicle operating costs, which will be passed on to the rural poor \nthrough service providers; and (ii) savings in travel time. Non-\nquantifiable benefits will be realized through improved access to \nmarkets and social services for the agricultural population and \nrural poor, which reflects higher profits for poor farmers; and lower \ntransport costs and better access to schools, medical clinics, and \nemployment centers. \n \nThe Project will help reduce poverty by lowering transport costs \nfor poor farmers, and lower costs and more timely access to \nschools, medical clinics and employment centers. \n \nThe lower transport costs will also increase mobility among the \npoor, especially poor women going to social centers. That will \nallow them to become more politically active, thus increasing their \nempowerment. \n   \n  The institutional improvement will enhance the institutional and \npolicy framework of sector management and provide the capacity \nto  ensure  efficiency  of  investment  and  sustain  the  Project\u2019s \ndevelopment impacts. Its proposed support for asset management \nand road maintenance will ensure that roads built or improved \nunder the Project will be adequately maintained. \n   \n ", "  vii \nRisks and Safeguards  The risk that the economic evaluation will not prove the Project \nfeasible has been examined in detail. The economic analysis has \nbeen subjected to a comprehensive risk analysis to examine the \neffects  of  the  following  key  variables:  (i)  base  yearly  traffic \nvolumes,  (ii)  traffic  growth  rates,  (iii)  capital  costs,  (iv) \nmaintenance costs, and (v) generated traffic. The risk analysis \nwas undertaken using @Risk computer program. Results of the \nanalysis indicated that the probability of the economic internal rate \nof return (EIRR) of Option 1 falling below 12% is only 4.8%, and \nthe probability of the EIRR of Option 2 falling below 12% is only \n11.5%.  These  low  probabilities  indicate  that  the  economic \nevaluation  is  robust  to  a  variety  of  variations  in  the  main \nparameters  used  to  determine  economic  viability.  The \nmethodology  and  assumptions  used  in  the  risk  analysis  are \ndescribed  fully  in  Supplementary  Appendix  K,  Project  Risk \nAnalysis. \n \nRisks to institutional improvement relate to GOC\u2019s commitment, \nownership of the Project, and ability to change policies. As one of \nthe  ADB\u2019s  focal  states,  GOC  is  reform-oriented,  and  has \nenvisaged good governance and good infrastructure as primary \ndevelopment goal for Chhattisgarh. GOC has initiated institutional \nreform to establish the Dedicated Road Authority (DRA) and to \nimprove its business procedures and management of state roads. \nGOC  has  also  requested  ADB  assistance  in  designing  and \nimplementing  the  sector  reform.  GOC  has  confirmed  and \nreassured  its  commitment  to,  and  ownership  of  the  reform \nthroughout  project  processing,  and  through  intensive  policy \ndialogue  and  that  the  sector  reform  is  the  top  priority  of \nChhattisgarh\u2019s road development program.  \n \nTo further mitigate the risks, a time-bound policy action plan has \nbeen prepared, which highlights the major milestones of policy \nmeasures and policy changes that GOC is to make within the time \nframe agreed with ADB. A condition for loan negotiations is that \nGOC  will  approve  and  submit  the  action  plan  to  ADB  before \nnegotiations begin. All other policy measures will be covenanted \nin the Loan and Project Agreements. \n \n \n \n ", "viii  \n  Risks  for  investment  are  limited  to  quality  control  because  of \nCGPWD\u2019s  capacity  constraints  in  contract  management  and \nsupervision  of  works,  and  limited  experience  in  working  with \ninternational  contractors  and  applying  conditions  of  the \nInternational Federation of Consulting Engineers for construction \nsupervision. But this can be mitigated by the use of consulting \nservices  for  construction  supervision,  and  capacity  building \nprograms  for  CGPWD  in  contract  management  and  quality \ncontrol.  Contracts  are  in  relatively  large  packages  to  attract \ninternational and large domestic contractors, and to ensure good \nperformance and high quality of construction.  Lessons learned \nfrom similar projects include that concerns will arise about quality \ncontrol and consultant performance during project implementation. \nThese will be addresses by identifying potential problems before \nimplementation starts so that the CGPWD is able to handle them \nshould they occur. Meanwhile, ADB will strengthen it prior review \nand  approval  of  scope  of  works,  technical  specifications,  and \ntender  documents.  The  GOC  has  agreed  with  ADB  to  have \nintensive  reviews  of  implementation  progress  and  issues,  and \nperformance of consultants and contractors.   \n \nIntensive preparatory work and studies were carried out on the \nrisks  of  social  and  environmental  impacts  in  the  sample \nsubproject, which represents the main technical specifications, \ntype  of  improvement  works,  and  social  and  environmental \nfeatures  of  the  main  road  network  in  Chhattisgarh.  GOC  has \nprepared  and  approved  a  resettlement  plan,  an  initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE),  an  indigenous  people\u2019s \ndevelopment program, and a resettlement policy framework, and \nan indigenous people\u2019s development framework. ADB reviewed \nand found those safeguard documents acceptable. Furthermore, \nspecific  requirements  are  reflected  in  the  subproject selection \ncriteria to ensure full compliance with the ADB\u2019s safeguard policy \nrequirements and guidelines.  \n \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto India for the Chhattisgarh State Roads Development Sector Project. \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \n \nA.  Sector Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n1.  Introduction \n \n2.  Chhattisgarh was established on 1 November 2000 through bifurcation from Madhya \nPradesh state. It is one of India\u2019s poorest states1. About 38% of Chhattisgarh\u2019s population of 21 \nmillion lives below the national poverty line2. About 44% of Chhattisgarh\u2019s population is tribal \nand scheduled caste3. Chhattisgarh has an area of 135,237 square km, and is known as a tribal \nand forest state. Forests cover about 44% of Chhattisgarh\u2019s land area.  \n \n3.  The Chhattisgarh railway network4 does not give adequate coverage. The railway serves \ncross-country traffic more than it serves the needs of Chhattisgarh. Railway services are \navailable to only a few major districts. Civil aviation is limited. Thus, roads are the main mode of \ntransportation. National highways (NH6, NH16 and NH78) provide good east-west connections \nwith  neighboring  states,  and  NH43  and  NH200  provide  improved  north-south  connection \nbetween Raipur, Bilaspur and Jagdalpur. But, Chhattisgarh lacks a network of high-standard \nroads to provide the required mobility between areas with natural resources and industrial \ncenters and economic development zones, and to provide better access to social amenities to \nlarge tribal and scheduled caste populations. \n \n2.  Road Administration and Responsibilities \n4.  The Public Works Department Government of Chhattisgarh (PWDGOC) is responsible \nfor road sector management and road development. Its institutional setup and division of \nresponsibilities follow the standard Public Works Department (PWD) manual covering zones of \nclassified works for national highways, state highways, and major district roads, as well as other \npublic infrastructure facilities, mainly buildings. \n \n5.  PWDGOC oversees the planning, design, construction, and maintenance of all state \nroads, major bridges, and government and public service buildings. Jointly with local district \ngovernments, PWDGOC is responsible for other district roads, some rural roads, small bridges \nand other public buildings. Under the authority and responsibility delegated by the Ministry of \n                                                 \n1  The per-capital gross domestic product (GDP) in 2000, at 1994 constant prices, was Rs6,692 ($152)\u2014 about 2% \nhigher than the GDP in 1994, according to the Chhattisgarh Directorate of Economics and Statistics in 2001. \n2  A poverty impact assessment (PIA) study is being finalized. Preliminary findings and recommendations of the PIA \nwere presented to, and discussed with, ADB\u2019s transport and poverty groups at a presentation organized by the \nEconomics and Research Department and Regional and Sustainable Development Department. Comments will be \nincorporated into the final PIA report and will be reflected in the draft report and recommendation of the President \n(RRP) for the management review meeting. \n3  Census 2001. \n4 The 1,038-km railway connecting the eastern and western regions of India passes through Chhattisgarh via Raipur \nand Bilaspur. ", "2     \nRoad Transport and Highways (MORTH), PWDGOC is also responsible for maintenance of \nChhattisgarh\u2019s  national  highways.  Responsibility  for  construction  and  maintenance  of  rural \nroads rests with the Chhattisgarh Rural Engineering Services (CGRES). \n \n3.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n6.  Road Network. Chhattisgarh inherited the road network from Madhya Pradesh of about \n35,000 km under PWDGOC jurisdiction, and 15,000 km of rural roads and tracks under the \njurisdiction of other government departments or local governments. The core road network \ncomprises two north-south corridors and four east-west corridors. The remaining roads, except \nfor the six main corridors, are mostly in poor or very poor condition, and not passable in the \nmonsoon season.  This is especially true for roads in southern and northern Chhattisgarh, \nwhere most of the tribal people live in forest areas. \n \n7.  Road Density. Chhattisgarh has 14,535 habitations that are not connected to the road \nnetwork; 1,168 of the habitations have populations of more than 1,000 and 3,730, of 500 to \n1,000 persons. Many districts, particularly those in the north and the south, have very poor road \ncoverage. The average density of blacktop and water-bound-macadam road is 16 km/100 km2. \nIndia\u2019s  average  is  42  km/100  km2.  This  may  be  partly  explained  by  extensive  forests  in \nChhattisgarh. Nevertheless, there are still many non-forested areas without roads, and more \nthan 15,000 villages have no connection to the main road network5. Excluding tracks, there is \nabout 1 km of road for every 570 persons. \n \n8.  Road  Capacity  and  Traffic  Volumes.  Apart  from  NH6  and  NH43,  the  remaining \nnational highways and most state roads are of single lane (3.75m carriageway width). Some \nstate highways (e.g., SH9) have been widened to intermediate lane (5.5-m width). National \nhighways are programmed for widening to two and four lane over time. Traffic counts on several \nstate highways show that traffic levels are generally low (<2000 PCUs per day), and hence \nwithin  the  Indian  Roads  Congress  (IRC)  capacity  definition  of  a  single  lane  road  (2,500 \nPCUs/day). But some state highways carry traffic volumes that exceed single-lane capacity and, \ntherefore, require immediate widening. \n \n9.  Road Conditions.  PWDGOC does not have a computerized database with information \non the condition of state highways and district roads. The only quantitative measurements of \nroad condition are surveys carried out in recent feasibility studies of 1,300 km of state highways. \nThose surveys showed that these roads have poor riding quality with International Roughness \nIndex  (IRI) values in the range of 6 to greater than 12. PWDGOC has a program to build about \n500 bridges in the next 15 years. Many existing bridges are in poor or unsafe condition. \n \n10.  Road Safety. Road safety has become a serious concern in Chhattisgarh,even though \nits death rate per 100,000 vehicles is about 60% of the national average. About 1,240 deaths \nfrom road accidents were reported in the 12 months ending in March 2002.6 The highest death \nrate was from accidents involving trucks, tankers and other heavy vehicles. Chhattisgrh\u2019s death \nrates are comparable to those of other Indian jurisdictions but significantly higher than those of \ndeveloped countries, especially if one considers vehicle ownership and volume of road traffic \n(Table 1). \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB is preparing a sector loan of $400 million to India to finance rural road development, including improvement of \n5,000 km of rural road each in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. Loan approval is expected in 2003. \n6  Statistics for 2003 are not yet available. \n ", "     3\nTable 1.  Road Death Rates \n  Deaths per \nLocation  100,000 vehicles \nChhattisgarh, India   144a \nMadhya  Pradesh,  142a \nIndia  250 \nIndia (all)  110 \nThailand  55 \nMalaysia  17 \nJapan  14 \nUnited Kingdom \na Includes two-wheelers \nSource: PPTA and India Road Safety Statistics \n \n11.  The number of road deaths involving two-wheelers skews the death rate significantly. \nThe death rate for two-wheeler passengers is lower than for other motorized vehicles: 39 per \n100,000 vehicles. If two-wheelers are ignored, the death rate for motorized vehicles increases to \n560 deaths per 100,000 vehicles.  \n \n12.  Sector Regulations. The Transport Department Government of Chhattisgarh (TDGOC) \nis responsible for the licensing, registration, and regulation of motor vehicles, drivers, and \npassenger  and  freight  transport.  As  a  result  of  GOC\u2019s  effort  to  encourage  private  sector \nparticipation, private sector operators provide all passenger and freight transport services, at \nmarket rates. TDGOC is also responsible for enforcing axle load regulations. Traffic police are \nresponsible for enforcing traffic and road safety regulations. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Sector Management \n13.  Road management in Chhattisgarh today is based on a general development strategy \non performance. PWDGOC\u2019s current performance is mainly evaluated by the spending of GOC \nbudget allocations. That means that incentives are limited for both PWDGOC management and \nstaff to adopt modern managerial systems and skills, or to improve quality of management or \nefficiency of operations. The system has also resulted in a lack of transparency and competition \nnecessary to encourage domestic contractors to develop their capacities and competitiveness. \nMeanwhile,  the  deficiencies  in  investment  and  maintenance  of  state  roads  have  been \naggravated  by  a  lack  of  updated  capacity  and  capability  in  master  planning  and  project \nprogramming,  sector  management,  quality  control  in  construction  and  maintenance,  and \nmanagement of financial resources. \n \n14.  Procedural delays in administrative processes have reduced the efficiency of use of \nfunds. Most bookkeeping for financial accounting and management is done manually.  Records \nare kept in a loose archive system. The system does not generate analysis of information for \nPWDGOC management to use for resource and asset management, and to support planning \nand decision-making. Road planning focuses on composing budget requirements by following \nitemized budget entries. There is no clearly specified process for identifying needs and planning \nresponses based on the application of economic criteria and a development strategy. The \nplanning process also suffers from a serious lack of reliable and updated data on the inventory \nand condition of the road network and its assets. Appendix 1 gives a supplementary sector \nanalysis. \n ", "4     \n \n2.  Challenges \n15.  In 2002, GOC formulated a road policy to embark on a medium-term program (2003\u2013\n2012) for road sector development. The road policy envisaged that good governance is key for \nsuccessful development of all social and economic  sectors, and that improved roads and \ntransport services are crucial support for Chhattisgarh\u2019s socioeconomic development.  \n \n16.  To improve governance, GOC has taken a holistic approach to address development \nneeds through efforts to (i) establish an integrated road development and management system \nby  creating  a  dedicated  road  authority,  (ii)  create  an  enabling  environment  to  provide \nadministrative support and encourage private sector participation in all financially viable road \nprojects,  (iii)  establish  a  dedicated  state  road  fund  for  road  maintenance,  and  (iv)  build \ninstitutional capacity for management of the state roads. \n \n17.  Funding of road maintenance in Chhattisgarh is not currently a major concern because \nof the better-off fiscal status of GOC. Analysis of the FY2001\u20132002 and FY2002\u20132003 budget \nallocations  and  actual  expenditures  showed  that  Non-Planned  Budget  and  workloads \nimplemented took about 63% of the total budget, which demonstrated a reasonable emphasis \non road maintenance, although the quality management needs substantial improvement.  \n \n18.  For long-term funding of road maintenance, the GOC has identified ways to establish a \nstate road fund through (i) earmarking revenue sources, (ii) creating legislation to establish the \nlegal status of the fund, and (iii) defining funding criteria. Fuel taxes are the main source of \ncollection for the Central Road Fund, so collection of any additional fuel taxes has become \npolitically sensitive to both the Government of India (GOI) and state governments.7 Toll roads \nare accepted in India, but Chhattisgarh has only a few toll roads and bridges because of the \nmoderately low traffic on most roads. Tolling will mainly be an alternative for the future, because \ntoday\u2019s road users cannot afford to pay much, and traffic forecasts for the near- and medium- \nterms indicate that more time is needed for the economy to develop and greater traffic to be \ngenerated. Thus, state budget allocations will be the main source of road maintenance in the \nnear term of 5 to 8 years.  \n \n3.  State Roads Development Program \n \n19.  To improve state roads, PWDGOC, in 2002\u20132003, prepared a 10-Year Master Plan for \nRoad Sector Development (MPRSD) for the years 2003 to 2012. MPRSD is based on social \nand economic development needs, development priorities for the road sector, and alternative \ninvestment strategies to support social and economic development priorities. It aims to (i) \npromote development of six main road corridors, (ii) remove capacity bottlenecks from the \nnetwork  to  better  connect  rural  areas,  and  (iii)  support  socio-economic  development  by \nimproving  road  access  and  connectivity  among  growth  centers.  For  road  maintenance,  a \ncomputer-based  pavement  management  system  such  as  Highway  Development  and \nMaintenance Tool 4 (HDM-4) will be adopted.  That will enable PWDGOC to evaluate the \neconomic effects of road maintenance alternatives and optimize road maintenance strategies. \n \n20.  Based on MPRSD, GOC prepared and approved a priority investment program to \nimprove about 5,000 km of state roads at an estimated cost of about Rs105 billion ($2.3 billion). \n                                                 \n7 More in-depth analysis of potential sources of collection is now being conducted by the GOC, and will be continually \nassisted by the Project.  \n ", "     5\nThe MPRSD identified 3,760 km of priority state roads sections for ADB financing. Most of these \nroads are single-lane, with worn crusts and pavements. The roads need to be reconstructed \nwithin  the  existing  alignments,  with  limited  expansion  of  capacity  and  changes  in  lane \nconfigurations. \n \n21.  The total budget available for road improvement projects for the next 10 years is \nprojected at about Rs61 billion ($1.3 billion), based on recent analysis, assuming that the \nbudget allocation to PWDGOC remains at the current level of 8% of the total state expenditure, \nand  that  Chhattisgarh\u2019s  economic  performance  keeps  up  with  the  national  average.  This \nanalysis does not include construction of new roads or projects for major capacity expansion \n(e.g., from two lanes to four lanes), which will probably happen in the next 10 years. A more \ndetailed needs assessment will be made in late 2003 and 2004 when the MPRSD is updated to \nreflect  achievements  of  GOC\u2019s  recent  investments  in  road  improvements.  GOC  has  also \nrecognized  that  needs  for  investment  in  roads  may  increase  substantially  to  support \nChhattisgarh\u2019s long-term social and economic development. Therefore, ADB\u2019s assistance in \nfinancing the Project is important to support GOC in achieving its road development objectives.  \n \n4.  Road Sector Expenditures and Revenues \n \n22.  The budgeted expenditure in Chhattisgarh\u2019s road sector for FY2002\u20132003 was Rs4.22 \nbillion ($87 million), equal to 8% of the total state budgeted expenditure (Appendix 1). The road \nexpenditures  include  amounts  provided  by  MORTH  for  improvement  and  maintenance  of \nnational  highways.  The  Non-Planned Budget8 includes maintenance of roads, PWDGOC\u2019s \nadministration (salary for regular and non-regular employees,9 and office operating costs), part \nof the funds are spent on state building and guesthouse maintenance, and operations that \ncannot be separated from roads. Appendix 1 includes a summary of PWDGOC\u2019s planned and \nNon-Planned Budgets and actual expenditures, and the annual expenditure by the end of March \n2003. \n \n5.  Public-Private Partnership (PPP) and Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) \n \n23.  GOC has established the Chhattisgarh Infrastructure Development Corporation (CIDC) \nto interface with the private sector, to commission feasibility studies and to invite proposals for \nspecific private sector participation and public-private partnership road projects. About 690 km \nof high-priority roads have been identified for built-operate-transfer (BOT), with pre-qualification \ncompleted and financial proposals prepared for submission to CIDC. PWDGOC has also signed \nagreements with developers to improve and operate about 297 km of state highways. \n \n24.  It has been noted that there will be difficulties and uncertainties for BOT projects on state \nroads due to low traffic volumes. Except for limited number of road sections with high traffic \nvolumes, the majority of road network will unlikely be attractive to private sector, or will require a \nhigh government subsidy10 to make them attractive to the private sector. This has become a \nmajor challenge for GOC in the near- and medium- terms, until its economy develops and traffic \nincreases on most state roads. \n                                                 \n8  The non-planned budget is for recurrent expenditures. \n9 \u201cNonregular employees\u201d includes timekeepers, work charge employees, and gang laborers. \n10 The GOC has set a ceiling of its subsidy for the private sector operators of no more than 30% of the total project \ncosts. \n ", "6     \n \n6.  ADB Sector Strategy \n \n25.  Roads in India consists of (i) key national highway links under the jurisdiction of the \nNational Highway Authority of India, (ii) other national highway links under the Ministry of Road \nTransport and Roads, (iii) state and district roads under state PWDs, and (iv) rural roads. Given \nthe potential scale of lending, ADB has developed a programmatic approach to the development \nof projects in a sequential and progressive manner to fulfill long-term policy objectives of \nfostering an enabling environment for efficient and sustainable development of roads to meet \npublic needs for increased mobility and efficient freight movement. Another major feature of \nroad sector lending is to firmly link a sector reform with a succession of investment to improve \nthe total connectivity of road networks. This overall lending strategy is  implemented through \ncoordinated lending to roads at the levels specified above. \n \n26.  A state road sector reform plan has been prepared and agreed upon with the GOI to \nguide ADB\u2019s lending operation in the sector for the next 10 years to achieve the following policy \nobjectives: \n \n(i)  separation of the government\u2019s policy and regulatory functions in the state road \nsector from project implementation, and operation and management of project \nfacilities, by establishing an interim road development agency within PWDs to \nintegrate all responsibilities and functions of sector management and project \nimplementation; \n(ii)  institutional strengthening and capacity building to improve business processes \nand  accountability,  and  to  enhance  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  sector \nmanagement; \n(iii)  full transition of sector management from the outdated PWD system, through the \ninterim road development agency, to the proposed Dedicated Road Authority \n(DRA) with improved governance and accountability; \n(iv)  Initiation of an enabling environment through outsourcing and other modalities to \nbring  about  better  private  sector  participation  in  road  development  and \nmaintenance; and \n(v)  establishment of a mechanism for road asset management and sustainable \nfunding for road maintenance. \n \n27.  The sector reform plan will be implemented programmatically, starting with separation of \nthe Government\u2019s policy and regulatory functions from project implementation and operation \nand management of project facilities, and by integrating all road functions and responsibilities \ninto a self-contained road development agency in the current PWD. That agency will later be \ntransformed into a dedicated road authority to take over development and management of the \nentire sector. Along with the progress of institutional reform, it will introduce and institutionalize \nimproved  business  processes  and  procedures,  install  modern  sector  management  and \noperational capability and tools, and training and skills upgrade to make DRA fully functional for \nfurther improvement until further review and improvement of the sector reform plan and strategy \nat the end of the 10-year period. \n \n28.  ADB operations in India and coordination with other major donors are discussed in \nAppendix 2 and Supplementary Appendix A. The proposed project is the second state-level \n ", "     7\nADB intervention in the state road sector following the Madhya Pradesh State Road Sector \nDevelopment Program approved in 200211. \n \n  7.  Lessons Learned \n \n29.  Operational  and  institutional  shortcomings  have  delayed  past  ADB-financed  road \nprojects in India, both for national highways and state roads. A lesson learned is that ADB\u2019s \nclose  supervision  and  consulting  services  in  project  preparation  and  implementation  are \ncritically important to the transfer of modern technology and skills to PWD staff, and to the \nbuilding of capacity for project implementing agencies. Meanwhile, continued policy dialogue \nwith the state government and PWD management is equally important to ensure institutional \nsupport and allocation of adequate resources for implementation of projects. The lessons \nlearned and experiences gained were taken into consideration in the Project\u2019s formulation and \ndesign, and in its implementation. \n \n8.  Rationale \n30.  PWDGOC, with its institutional and technical capability and capacity, is reaching a limit \nto perform more effective sector management and more efficient management of investments in \nstate roads. This, and a 10-year neglect of investment in road improvements and maintenance, \nhas caused serious deterioration of most state roads.  Riding quality is mostly from poor to very \npoor. This has undermined the long-term growth potential of the state\u2019s economy and resulted in \nincreasing transport capacity bottlenecks and poorer transport services for the economy, rural \npoor and tribal populations. \n \n31.  Improvement of road sector management is crucial to support GOC\u2019s policy initiatives. \nBetter governance and accountability will improve the institutional and policy framework, and \nprovide  the  capacity  to  ensure  that  investments  in  sector  development  are  implemented \nsuccessfully,  and  that  impacts  of  road  development  can  be  sustained.  The  road  sector \ninvestment  is  expected  to  help  GOC  improve  connectivity  of  Chhattisgarh\u2019s  road  network \nsignificantly, thus directly supporting the state\u2019s economic growth. Meanwhile, road sector \ninvestment will also provide a vehicle for Chhattisgarh to establish a transparent and conducive \nenvironment for more competition and increased private sector participation. That in turn will \nensure better infrastructure facilities and decreased recurrent costs for road maintenance over \nthe medium and long term to allow higher capital and expenditure for priority social sectors and \npoverty reduction. \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \n \nA.  Objectives \n \n32.  The main objective of the Project is to support economic growth and reduce poverty by \nimproving connectivity and access to development opportunities and social services, including \nhealth and education. The Project will also support GOC\u2019s initiative to improve the effectiveness \nand efficiency of state road sector management, and provide the sector with the capacity to \nensure efficiency of road investments and sustainable road development impacts to support \n                                                 \n11 ADB, 2002.

The objective will be achieved through (i) \ninstituting measures for good governance in the administration and management of the sector, \n(ii) improving sector capability and building capacity for more efficient resource and asset \nmanagement, (iii) initiating steps to increase private sector participation in road development \nand maintenance, (iv) improving road safety, (v) enhancing social awareness for prevention of \nHIV/AIDS,12  and  (vi)  improving  priority  state  roads  to  provide  better  connectivity  between \neconomic growth centers and rural areas, and to complement ADB\u2019s Rural Roads Sector \nIProject. Appendix 3 gives the project framework. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n33.  The Project will finance improvement of about 1,700 km of state roads in Chhattisgarh. \nConsulting services will be provided to assist PWDGOC in preparing and implementing the road \nimprovement subprojects, construction supervision, capacity building and training in project \nmanagement and quality control. Consultants will also assist GOC in detailing and implementing \nthe institutional reforms, and building the required policy and institutional capacity for state road \nmanagement.  Consulting  services  will  support  the  adoption  and  implementation  of  the \ncommunity  road  safety  program,  development  of  road  safety  plans  and  a  road  accident \ndatabase, and the conduct of road safety audit for all subprojects. \n \n  1.  Institutional Reform and Capacity Building \n \n34.  Project implementation will follow the sector reform plan (para. 25-27) to achieve policy \nobjectives  (i),  (ii)  and  (iii);  to  improve  governance  and  accountability  of  road  sector \nmanagement, to identify alternative asset management systems; and to build capacity, through \ntraining, in modern sector management and operations. Policy objectives (iv) and (v) will  be \nfulfilled through a follow-up operation to be financed either by the GOC or through external \nassistance, for full implementation of private sector participation in road development and \nmaintenance projects, and through the establishment of a sustainable road asset management \nsystem, including a funding mechanism for road maintenance. The institutional reform was \ndesigned by the project participatory technical assistance (PPTA),13 and accepted by GOC and \nADB. The design involved significant policy dialogue with GOC and participation of the state \ndepartments and staff concerned through daily interaction, seminars, and workshops, as well as \ndissemination of information and project preparation experiences of a similar PWD institutional \nreform through a 2002 ADB loan for Madhya Pradesh. These important policy activities helped \nthe GOC and its staff better understand the envisaged development goals and objectives for the \nsector, and benefits of the institutional reform. Intensive policy dialogue and consultation among \nADB,  GOC,  and  the  consultants  served  as  fora  for  discussions  of  every  detail  of  policy \nobjectives  and  measures,  implementation  arrangements,  and  risks  and  benefits  of  the \ninstitutional reform. The reform will improve the current institutional and policy framework, and \nprovide the capacity to ensure successful implementation of the investment under the sector \napproach, and that project-generated impacts of road development are sustained through better \ngovernance and accountability. The Time-bound Policy Action Plan14 in Appendix 4 reflects \nGOC\u2019s commitment and milestone policy measures to be implemented under the Project. \nImprovement  in  governance  and  institutional  strengthening  in  planning  and  resource \nmanagement for sector development will be key interventions to ensure more accountable \nbudget allocation and use, and more sustainable development and maintenance of state roads. \n                                                 \n12 Human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \n13 ADB.2002.

Supplementary Appendix B summarizes the reengineering and transition plans, and \nimplementation arrangements. More detailed implementation plans and guides are in the PPTA \nconsultant\u2019s final report, which was discussed in depth and agreed upon with GOC. Based on \nthis, reform consultants financed under the Project, jointly with GOC, will prepare a  detailed \nwork program and specific implementation arrangements for reform in three main clusters: (i) \nestablishing an interim agency for state road management\u2014 the Agency for Road Development \n(ARD) and transform it to the DRA; (ii) instituting new business processes and procedures and \ninstalling modern capability and tools for sector management and operation; and (iii) institutional \nstrengthening through recruitment of new engineers, training, and acquisition of equipment \nessential for road management. \n \n36.  By the end of 2006, ARD will be transformed to DRA, which will be tested through daily \noperations from 2007 onward. Areas that need further improvement will be identified through the \npilot operation of the new sector management system, improved business procedures, and \nmanagement tools and systems installed for DRA.  Needs for assistance to further improve \nmanagement and operation of the sector will also be identified, to ensure achievement of policy \nobjectives under the sector reform plan until it is reviewed and further improved. Implementation \nprogress of the reform will be monitored using the key milestone events and deliverables \ndescribed in the Time-Bound Policy Action Plan. \n \n  2.  Road Improvements \n \n37.  The Project will finance improvements15 of about 1,700 km of state roads, which are part \nof the MPRSD, of parts of the two north-south and four east-west corridors, or connectivity \nroads linking with development centers and improved rural roads under the Prime Minister\u2019s \nRural Road Development Program - Pradham Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY).  \n \n38.  ADB\u2019s  sector  lending  procedures  were  followed.  A  detailed  feasibility  study  and \nengineering design of a sample subproject were conducted. ADB reviewed and evaluated them \nto ensure they complied with ADB\u2019s policies, guidelines, and procedures for project preparation, \nincluding the technical, operational, economic, environmental, social and resettlement aspects. \nThe sample subproject consists of road sections between Konta and Jagdapur in southern \nChhattisgarh connecting with Andhra Pradesh. The subproject represents the common features \nof project improvement works, including pavement reconstruction for the entire length, and the \nwidening of roads from single lane to intermediate lanes, and from intermediate lanes to two \nlanes.  The  subproject  roads  pass  through  a  reserve  forest,  and  by  a  tribal  community. \nSupplementary Appendix C describes the Indigenous People\u2019s Development Program for the \nsample  subproject;  Supplementary  Appendix  D  describes  the  resettlement  plan;  and \nSupplementary  Appendix  E  describes  environmental  assessment.  The  sample  subproject \npreparation will be a model for GOC in the preparation of remaining subprojects during project \nimplementation. \n \n39.  The remaining subprojects will be selected, prepared, and approved during project \nimplementation in accordance with selection criteria and approval procedures agreed by GOC \nand ADB (Appendix 5 and Supplementary Appendix F). All subprojects must meet evaluation \nrequirements,  including  that:  (i)  technical  specifications  and  design  criteria  are  met  in \n                                                 \n15 Road improvement works under the Project include mainly reconstruction of pavement, repair and strengthening of \nmajor bridges and culverts, improvement of cross drainage systems, and reconfiguration of pavement (if traffic \nvolumes and existing right-of-ways justify it). \n ", "10     \naccordance with the IRC standard for state highways and major district roads, as well as IRC \ndesign codes, (ii) a road safety audit is conducted on all subprojects to identify areas of major \nconcern, and review recommendations to be incorporated into the detailed engineering designs; \n(iii) compliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard policies on environmental and social impacts of project, \nincluding policies on involuntary resettlement, indigenous people, gender, and HIV/AIDS, and \n(iv) an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) greater than 12%. ADB will review and approve \nthe  selection  of  all  subprojects  until  ADB  has  full  confidence  in  PWDGOC\u2019s  capacity  to \nindependently select and evaluate subprojects.  ADB may in the future, decide to revise the \nsubproject  review  and  approval  process  for  delegation  of  the  approval  of  subprojects  to \nPWDGOC. \n \n40.  The Project will implement a road safety program, including a community road safety \nprogram developed under the Rural Roads Sector I Project through close coordination and \ncooperation with CGRES. Road safety measures will include (i) to conduct road safety audits for \nall subprojects to identify problem areas and recommend improvements of engineering designs; \n(ii) to develop road safety plans that involve education, enforcement, driver training, standards \nof vehicle mechanical fitness, seatbelt and safety helmet requirements, and other measures to \nreduce damage from road accidents, and (iii) to develop a road accident database and conduct \nroad safety audit on all major roads. \n \nC.  Special Features \n41.  Chhattisgarh needs road improvements immediately. As the government of a new state, \nGOC has taken advantage of a dynamic momentum of development, and a better-off fiscal \nposition since its founding, to initiate an ambitious program to improve the riding quality of \narterial road corridors and priority roads. This has resulted in changes in road inventories and \nroad conditions. Therefore, the MPRSD, which GOC approved earlier needs to be updated to \nprovide an up-to-date base map to select the remaining subprojects (selection of the sample \nsubproject and first group of subprojects was based on GOC\u2019s priority investment program \nunder the MPRSD). The sector lending modality provides the Project the flexibility to support \nthis dynamic process of project preparation, and improve its readiness and implementation. \n \n42.  Construction quality and lack of maintenance after improvement are often concerns on \nthe sustainability of development impacts of road projects in India. To address this, the Project \nwill include, on a pilot basis, provisions in civil works contracts to require contractors to continue \nmaintaining the same scope of works for a variable period of time from 6 to 8 years to include \nthe first periodic maintenance. \n \n43.  The reform will enable GOC to more effectively manage state roads and ensure more \nreliable road transport to support Chhattisgarh\u2019s social and economic development through two \nmain channels. The first channel includes improving governance in public administration and \naccountability in public resource and asset management for state roads. Improving the sector \ncapability and capacity will create a transparent and conducive environment for increased \nefficiency and competition. This, in turn, will  promote higher-quality construction and road \nmaintenance and more sustainable road infrastructure, and decrease recurrent costs of road \nmaintenance over the medium and long terms. The second channel includes identifying sources \nof road sector revenue to support the establishment of a sustainable funding mechanism for \nroad maintenance. The institutional improvement will provide better transparency and higher \nlevels of competition to encourage private sector participation in road projects. That will offset \nGOC\u2019s financial burden, and enable more funding of priority social sectors such as health and \neducation to support poverty reduction. \n ", "    11\n \nD.  Cost Estimates  \n44.  The total cost of the Project, in 2003 prices, is estimated at $285.7 million equivalent, of \nwhich the foreign exchange cost is estimated at $199.52 million, or 70% of the total cost of the \nProject. The local currency cost is estimated at $86.18 million equivalent, or 30% of the total \ncost of the Project. The cost estimate includes local taxes and duties, contingencies, a front-end \nfee of 0.5 % of the total loan amount, interest during construction (IDC), and a commitment \ncharge. Appendix 6 summarizes the project cost estimates. \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n \n45.  It  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  $180,000,000,  from  its  ordinary  capital \nresources. That will cover 63% of the total Project cost. The loan will finance the entire foreign \nexchange cost of the Project, excluding the front-end fee, commitment fee and IDC16, as well as \npart of the local currency costs of domestic consulting services for subproject selection and \npreparation, and assistance to GOC in implementing the institutional reforms. GOC will provide \nthe remaining local currency cost of $85.7 million equivalent. Appendix 6 includes a summary of \na proposed financing plan. GOC has assured that it will secure the counterpart financing as \ncommitted. India will be the Borrower. \n \n46.  The loan will have (i) a 25-year term, including a 5-year grace period; an interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a commitment charge of \n0.75% per annum; a front-end fee of 0.5%; conversion options that may be exercised in \naccordance with the terms of the Loan Agreement, the loan regulations, and ADB\u2019s conversion \nguidelines; and other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. \nThe Government of India has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were independent decisions and not made in reliance on any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements  \n1.  Project Management  \n47.  PWDGOC will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the Project. Within PWDGOC, ARD will \nbe responsible for overall project execution and supervision. A project implementation unit \n(PIU),  with  field  offices  at  key  locations,  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  project \nimplementation and management. The Road Management Committee (RMC), to be formed in \nMarch 2004, will oversee and provide policy support and coordination for timely implementation \nof institutional reform and capacity building, and help monitor project implementation.  \n \n48.  PWDGOC established the PIU, with four full-time staff, in September 2003 as the first \nstep in creating ARD. PWDGOC will transfer more full-time staff to PIU in January 2004 for \nproject  management  functions  in  accounting,  planning,  engineering,  procurement, \nenvironmental  planning  and  management,  social  analysis  and  management,  resettlement \nplanning and implementation, road maintenance, and road safety. These staff will form the core \nof ARD, and will be transferred to the ARD functional units as they are established. \n \n                                                 \n16 The Borrower will pay separately the front-end fee, commitment charge and interest during construction. \n ", "12     \n49.  The RMC will, be chaired by the chief secretary, or his designate, with representatives \nfrom FDGOC, PWDGOC, CIDC,  the Chhattisgarh Home (Police) Department, CGRES, the \nChhattisgarh Planning Department, and selected external road stakeholders. RMC will meet at \nthe state level monthly to monitor project performance and, use of funds from both the ADB loan \nand counterpart funds, and to ensure coordination among the key agencies. When needed, \nother agencies such as Department of Forestry and Environment, agencies for resettlement, \nand consultants may be invited to RMC meetings. \n \n2.  Implementation Arrangements and Schedule  \n50.  Appendix 7 summarizes the implementation schedule. Besides the sample subproject, \nanother 670 km of priority roads have been identified as candidate subprojects for further \nevaluation  in  accordance  with  the  subproject  selection  criteria.  The  remaining  970  km  of \nsubproject roads will be identified from the updated MPRSD, using the selection procedures and \ncriteria  agreed  upon  by  ADB  and  GOC.  To  ensure  satisfactory  project  readiness  for \nimplementation and timely preparation of the remaining subprojects, PWDGOC has assured its \nfull support to updating of MPRSD and providing all required inputs and analyses to the \nimplementation consultants.   \n \n51.  PWDGOC will prepare bidding documents and draft contracts for ADB\u2019s review and \napproval  for  civil  works  and  consulting  services  for  institutional  reform  and  construction \nsupervision. Pre-construction activities, including the tendering of civil works contracts for the \nsample subproject, began in the third quarter of 2003, and will be completed by the second \nquarter of 2004. Project implementation is expected to take 5 years, from January 2004 to \nJanuary 2009. The loan account will be financially closed in July 2009, 6 months after physical \ncompletion of the Project. \n \n52.  Considering that Chhattisgarh is a forest state and sensitive to environmental impacts of \nconstruction works, ADB\u2019s safeguard policy requirements must be complied with strictly. To \nensure that compliance, ADB will review and approve the selection of subprojects, especially \nassessments of social and environmental impact, mitigation measures, and implementation \nplans. \n \n3.  Procurement  \n53.  ADB has approved advance procurement of civil works for the sample subproject. GOC \nhas been advised that ADB\u2019s approval of advance procurement actions does not commit ADB to \napprove the loan. All procurement to be financed under the loan will be in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The  road improvement works will be packaged into a \nnumber of contracts according to the nature of works, technical requirements, geographical \nlocation, and size of contracts. Appendix 8 has indicative contract packages, which will be \nfinalized for ADB\u2019s prior approval, and will be used during project implementation. Civil works \ncontracts will be procured using international competitive bidding (ICB) for contracts of $1.0 \nmillion equivalent or more. Civil works contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of less than \n$1,000,000 will be procured through local competitive bidding (LCB). Civil works for the sample \nsubproject will be tendered through ICB in one contract package. Packaging of the remaining \nworks will be finalized during project implementation, with ADB\u2019s concurrence before bidding. To \nexpedite procurement, and considering that the nature of most civil works of most of the \nsubprojects may be similar, pre-qualification (PQ) of contractors will be based on different \nthresholds  of  contract  size\u2014$10  million,  $20  million,  and  $30  million\u2014  so  PQ  can  start \nimmediately. The PQ will remain valid for 18 months after the conclusion of PQ evaluation. \n ", "    13\n \n54.  Procurement  of  equipment  to  strengthen  PWDGOC\u2019s  road  management  capacity \nincludes that for (i) traffic counting and road condition survey; (ii) laboratory and material testing \nequipment; (iii) pavement management; and (iv) equipment for operation of the proposed \nARD/DRA, including the financial accounting system, management information system, and \nenvironmental monitoring. Equipment financed under the Project will be procured using ICB \nprocedures if the estimated contract amount is equal to or above $500,000, and international \nshopping  if  the  estimated  contract  amount  is  less  than  $500,000.  Contract  packaging  for \nequipment will be based on required technical features and timing of procurement. Detailed \nspecifications will be finalized during project implementation. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n55.  Under the Project,  consulting services will be required to help PWDGOC implement \ninstitutional reforms and supervise construction. Separate teams of international consultants will \nbe contracted in association with domestic consultants. Supplementary Appendix G has terms \nof reference for the institutional reform and Supplementary Appendix H has terms of reference \nfor construction supervision. \n \n56.  Institutional reform will required about 60 person-months of international and 20 person-\nmonths of domestic consultants. The consultants will provide expertise in governance and \nsector policy, transport economics, road engineering, road safety, financial analysis, project \nfinancing, financial accounting and management, and social and environmental management. \nThe consultants will provide training in these areas to help GOC build capacity for better sector \nmanagement. The consultants will also provide training through seminars and workshops on \ndissemination of findings and recommendations on the institutional reform and its impacts on \nstate roads management. \n \n57.  About 198 person-months of international consulting services will be required for (i) \nsubproject  selection  and  preparation  (30  person-months);  (ii)  construction  supervision  and \nproject implementation (160 person-months); (iii) monitoring and evaluation, using criteria of the \nproject performance management system (PPMS) (3 person-months); and (iv) an environmental \nspecialist  (5  person-months)  for  environmental  management  and  monitoring.  Under  each \nservice,  the  consultants  will  provide  on-the-job  training  to  counterpart  staff  and  domestic \nconsultants. Domestic consulting services will be provided for construction supervision (1,080 \nperson-months),  and  contract  management  and  technical  advisory  assistance  (20  person-\nmonths). Fifteen person-months of domestic consulting will be required to help the international \nconsultants monitor projects on social and poverty reduction. \n \n58.  Training will be organized for staff of the ARD in construction supervision for bridge \nmaintenance, pavement management, quality control, maintenance planning, and social and \nenvironmental monitoring and management. The supervision consultants will design training \nprograms and select suitable training institutions for those subjects. GOC will submit a list of \nproposed  candidates,  together  with  the  training  programs,  to  ADB  for  prior  review  and \nconcurrence. \n \n59.  International consultants financed under the Project will be recruited through quality and \ncost-based  selection,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants. \nPWDGOC  has  agreed  to  incorporate  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  anti-corruption  policy  in  all \ninvitation documents and contracts for consultants. Domestic consultants will be recruited in \naccordance with procedures satisfactory to the ADB. \n ", "14     \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n60.  Loan disbursements will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursment Handbook, \nJanuary  2001,  and  Interim  Guidelines  for  Disbursement  Operations,  LIBOR-Based  Loan \nProduct, July 2002. Loan funds for civil works, procurement of equipment, and consulting \ncontracts will be disbursed using direct payment and reimbursement procedures, in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n61.  PWDGOC will make arrangements that are satisfactory to ADB for reporting progress of \nproject implementation. PWDGOC will submit to ADB quarterly progress reports on project \nimplementation  in  such  form  and  detail  as  ADB  may  reasonably  require.  The  results  of \nmonitoring of the social and environmental impacts of the Project should be incorporated in the \nquarterly  reports.  PWDGOC  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB,  within  3  months  of  project \ncompletion,  the  project  completion  report  with  detailed  assessment  of  the  design; \nimplementation;  costs;  performance  of  PWDGOC  and  ADB  consultants,  and  contractors; \nattainment of benefits; economic reevaluation; socioeconomic and environmental impacts; and \nother information that ADB requests. \n \n62.  PWDGOC will maintain for the Project separate records on goods and services financed \nfrom the loan, financial resources received, expenditures, and use of local funds. The accounts \nwill be set up in accordance with sound accounting principles. Independent auditors, acceptable \nto ADB, will audit the accounts. PWDGOC will submit the audited project accounts to ADB \nwithin 9 months from the end of the previous fiscal year. GOC and PWDGOC have been \nadvised of ADB\u2019s requirements for improving compliance with timely submission of audited \nproject accounts, and the possibility of suspending disbursements if submission is delayed. \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation (PPMS) \n63.  Supplementary Appendix I gives a set of indicators and target values for monitoring \nproject  performance  and  estimating  attainment  of  the  envisaged  project  goals,  purposes, \noutputs, and conditions. PWDGOC will input baseline indicators when the Project begins. \nConsultants  for  construction  supervision  will  provide  expertise  in  the  PPMS  design, \nimplementation, maintenance, monitoring, and performance evaluation. Assistance and training \nwill be provided in establishment of the PPMS database, data identification and collection, data \nscreening  and  entry,  data  processing  and  analysis,  PPMS  system  management  and \nmaintenance, project performance monitoring and evaluation, and reporting. Subsequently, \nindicator values will be observed during project implementation, at project completion, 1 year \nafter project completion, and 5 years after project completion. \n \n8.  Project Review  \n64.  GOC and ADB will carry out a midterm review by the end of 2006, in addition to ADB\u2019s \nregular and special reviews of project implementation. At the midterm review, GOC and ADB \nwill  review  in  detail  the  project  design  and  implementation  progress  to  identify  areas  for \nstrengthening, and improvements to ensure smooth implementation and achievement of the \nproject objectives. The review will focus on specific measures agreed with PWDGOC on making \npolicy changes and institutional improvements, assessing funding requirements and budget \nallocations for road maintenance, updating the MPRSD, and improving quality management. \n ", "    15\nThe measures include ADB\u2019s monitoring and supervision of institutional improvement; prior \nreview and approval of subproject selection; implementation of action plans for mitigation of \nadverse project impacts on environmental and social aspects, and of involuntary resettlement; \nbidding documents; bid evaluations; and contract execution. The project review will also include \nreview  of  project  progress  reports,  to  be  prepared  by  PWDGOC  and  implementation \nconsultants, and review of the performance of supervision consultants and contractors. \n \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \n \n65.  The project benefits and impacts, and potential risks, were assessed. The  integrated \nbenefits and impacts will outweigh the costs, and the Project will bring net benefits. \n \nA.  Policy and Institutional Improvements \n66.  Improving management of the state road sector will enable GOC to more efficiently \nmanage state roads and ensure more reliable road transport services to support Chhattisgarh\u2019s \nsocial and economic development.  Development will be through improving governance in \npublic administration and accountability in sector resource and road asset management, and \nimproving sector capability and capacity to create a transparent environment that is conducive \nto increased efficiency and competition. This, in turn, will ensure higher quality of construction \nand  maintenance  and  more  sustainable  road  infrastructure.  Road  improvement  will  also \ndecrease recurrent costs of road maintenance over the medium and long terms, and enable \nmore  funding  of  priority  social  sectors  such  as  health  and  education  to  support  poverty \nreduction.  \n \n67.  Institutional reform will result in more reliable institutional and policy frameworks. Reform \nwill also provide the capacity to ensure that the investments under the sector approach will be \nimplemented successfully, and that project-generated development can be sustained through \nimproved  governance  and  accountability.  Support  proposed  for  asset  management  and \nimprovement of sector management will ensure that roads improved under the Project are \nadequately maintained. \n \nB.  Economic Benefits \n68.  The EIRR was calculated by comparing the with-Project and without-Project situations \nfor the sample subproject. Without the Project, traffic volume would exceed the capacity of the \nroads, which would then become congested, leading to increase in travel time and vehicle \noperating costs (VOCs). With the Project, higher speeds will reduce travel time and faster and \nsmoother rides) on the improved project roads will reduce VOCs. \n \n69.  Economic analysis was carried out using HDM-4. The model evaluates the project \ninvestment, considering capital and recurrent costs as well as benefits derived from savings in \nroad user costs for the \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d project cases. In the economic analysis the project \nlife was assumed to be 20 years. The economic costs of the Project include the resource costs \nfor construction, operation, and maintenance; and the social costs of compensation for land \nacquisition and resettlement. The economic benefits were quantified in terms of VOC savings \nfor existing traffic. \n  \n ", "16     \n70.  The economic analysis subdivided the project road into three homogeneous sections, \nwhich were defined based on traffic volumes derived from the traffic analysis, roughness \nobserved during the surveys, and altitude and gradient of the roads. The analysis investigated \ntwo  project  road  improvement  options.  Option  1  was  to  improve  the  existing  road  to  an \nintermediate lane standard of 5.5 m. Option 2 was to improve to the project road to a two-lane \nstandard of 7.0 m. The estimated EIRR for the Option 1 road is 18.3%; and for Option 2, 17.5%. \nthat  indicates  that  the  Project  is  economically  viable  under  either  option.  The  Project \nrecommends Option 2 for improvement of the sample subproject. Appendix 8 summarizes the \neconomic analysis. Supplementary Appendix J gives further details. \n \n71.  Sensitivity of the Project road for each option was analyzed with respect to changes in \nthe benefit and cost streams. Seven sensitivity test cases were examined: (i)a 20% increase in \nconstruction costs, (ii) a 20% reduction in benefits,(iii) a 50% decrease in traffic growth rates,  \n(iv) no generated traffic benefits, (v) a 2-year project implementation delay, (vi) less than optimal \nroad maintenance, and (vii) a combination of a 20% increase in capital costs and a 20% \nreduction of benefits. Results show that the quantified economic benefits are quite robust to the \nvarious sensitivity tests, and the Project remains economically viable. The only test in which the \nEIRR falls below 12% is for Option 2, if the traffic growth rates decreased by 50%. Switching \nvalues were determined for capital costs and economic benefits. The capital cost would have to \nincrease by 75% in Option 1, and by 66% in Option 2, to reduce the EIRR to 12%. The benefit \nlevel would have to decrease by 42% in Option 1, and by 38% in Option 2, to achieve the same \neffect on the EIRR. A risk analysis using the @Risk computer program was undertaken to \ndetermine the risk of the EIRR falling below 12% for the two options. The probability of the EIRR \nof Option 1 falling below 12% is 4.8%; but the probability of the Option 2 EIRR falling below 12% \nis  only  11.5%.  Supplementary  Appendix  K,  Project  Risk  Analysis  fully  describes  the \nmethodology and assumptions used in the risk analysis. \n \nC.  Poverty Reduction \n1.  Poverty and Socioeconomic Impacts \n \n72.  Chhattisgarh is one of India\u2019s poorest states. About 45% of Chhattisgarh\u2019s population \nlives below the official poverty line compared to 35% for India as a whole.17  The Project is \nclassified as \u201cpoverty intervention\u201d and will contribute directly to poverty reduction by lowering \ntransport  costs.  The  benefits  will  become  evident  in  higher  profit  margins  for  agricultural \nproducts for poor farmers, and cheaper and faster access to schools, medical clinics, and \nemployment centers. Lower transport costs will increase mobility among the poor, especially \npoor women, who will be able to reach social centers easier, and become more politically active, \nthus increasing the empowerment of the poor. \n \n73.  Improving the 100-km sample subproject in Dantewada district will have a large effect on \nreducing poverty, it will directly benefit 236,000 people in a 30-km zone of influence. About \n116,000 poor people will be direct beneficiaries, or about 50% of the total direct beneficiaries.18 \nEstimates of beneficiaries include only those who will benefit in the long run from the lower \ntransport costs and induced economic and social development. This head-count approach gives \na higher estimate of poor beneficiaries in the Project\u2019s influence area than the incidence of \npoverty in Chhattisgarh. \n                                                 \n17 The poverty line used to define the \u201cpoor\u201d is India\u2019s nationally recognized estimate of income of Rs400/person per \nmonth. \n18 Final Report on Poverty Impact Assessment for the Government of Chhattisgarh under ADB TA 3995-IND.  \n ", "    17\n \n74.  Analysis of the level of benefits going to the poor has been examined by varying the \ncompetition levels and changes in freight rates and passenger fees. The analysis indicated that \nproject benefits, as envisaged, are expected to be passed on to the poor. Supplementary \nAppendix K gives details.  \n \n2.  Poverty Impact Ratio \n \n75.  Based on field work results, and many survey responses, distribution analyses and \ncalculation of a poverty impact ratios (PIRs) were conducted for Options 1 and 2. The PIR for \nOption 1 is 1.07 and for Option 2, 1.17. The PIRs indicate that the total net economic benefits \nreaching the poor will exceed the Project\u2019s net economic benefits.19 This ratio is higher than \nIndia\u2019s incidence of poverty, and income share of the poor. These findings strongly indicate that \nthe  Project  is  highly  pro-poor.  Appendix  8  and  Supplementary  Appendix  J  describes  the \nanalyses. The PIRs calculated were also subjected to a risk analysis, which is further described \nin Supplementary Appendix K, Project Risk Analysis. \n \n76.  The estimates do not include the expected benefits to the poor of improving tertiary \nroads  for  rural  connectivity,  a  project  component.  Additional  benefits  will  probably  be \nsubstantial, because the tertiary roads link poor farmers and their villages with state roads that \nare now impassable during the monsoon season. Selection of the rural connector roads to be \nincluded in the Project will be based mainly on criteria for poverty reduction.   \n \nD.  Social and Environment Impacts \n1.  Social Impacts \n \n77.  An initial social assessment (ISA) was conducted for the entire scope of the proposed \nproject.  ADB  reviewed  and  confirmed  the  ISA  findings  and  recommendations  through \ncommunity consultations and further social assessment, which indicated unanimous support for \nroad improvements. Key reasons for public support of the road network include poor road \nconditions and, resulting traffic accidents, and road congestion, particularly in urban areas. Also, \nsmall roadside businesses offer the poor a valuable source of income. Improvement of the \nsample  subproject  from  Konta  to  Jagdalpur,  a  seriously  deteriorated  link  to  NH43,  which \nconnects Chhattisgarh and Andra Pradesh, is expected to facilitate through traffic for intra- and \ninter- state freight and passenger traffic, and reduce travel time substantially. \n \n78.  Detailed engineering design, based on community consultations and social assessments \nfor selected state highways, will improve road shoulders to enable safe access for pedestrians \nand slow traffic, bus stops with seating, wayside amenities, and truck stops that cause minimal \nroad congestion. Such amenities will be included as long as they do not entail land acquisition \nand resettlement. The design will include information signs, and speed breaks near schools, \nhospitals, and congested areas. Assessment of the social and poverty impacts provides the \nbasis  for  integrating  social  concerns,  and  is  part  of  the  criteria  for  selecting  subprojects \n(Appendix 5 and Supplementary Appendix L). \n                                                 \n19 The poor will receive most of the gross economic benefits, but will contribute only a small share of gross  \ninvestment costs.  \n ", "18     \n \n2.  Resettlement \n \n79.  The  subproject  selection  criteria  and  technical  design  have  recommended  road \nimprovements that will not entail land acquisition and involuntary resettlement. PWDGOC has \nprepared a resettlement plan for the sample subproject and a resettlement framework for the \nsample subproject. ADB\u2019s policy requirements were followed for involuntary resettlement under \nsector lending, and for the mitigation of adverse effects on affected people. GOC will prepare a \nresettlement plan for each subproject, and submit them to ADB for approval before awarding of \ncivil works contracts. \n \n80.  An institutional assessment showed that PWDGOC\u2019s capacity to undertake resettlement \nresponsibilities should be strengthened. The Project will contribute, through consulting services \nfor  institutional  improvement,  to  strengthening  of  the  capacity  to  manage  resettlement  by \nconducting workshops and seminars to create social awareness and strengthen coordination \namong government and civil societies that address resettlement problems, particularly those \nthat concern road improvements.  \n \n81.  To support the initiative for road sector development, a project environment and social \nunit (ESU) will be established within ARD, then within DRA. Through its responsibilities for \nsocial impacts and safeguards, ESU will be responsible for assessments of social impact, \nincluding (i) monitoring the implementation of resettlement plans and social mitigating measures \nfor  projects,  (ii)  implementing  measures  to  mitigate  social  and  resettlement  impacts,  (iii) \nimplementing resettlement plans that GOC has approved, and are acceptable to ADB, and, (iv) \ncapacity  building  for  ARD  and  DRA  in  undertaking  those  responsibilities.  Supplementary \nAppendix D gives the resettlement framework and Supplementary Appendix M, the summary \nresettlement action plan for the sample subproject. \n \n3.  Indigenous People \n \n82.  About 44% of Chhattisgarh\u2019s population is tribal and scheduled castes.20 The Project is \nconfined to existing road alignment, so it will not affect such groups within its area of influence. \nThe improved road network will improve access to services and economic opportunities for tribal \npeople and scheduled caste groups, as well as all segments of the state\u2019s population. Because \nof  the  high  percentage  of  tribal  and  scheduled  caste  populations  in  the  areas  of  project \ninfluence, a detailed analysis of the status of, and a review of GOC\u2019s current policies for, the \ndevelopment of indigenous people was conducted under the PPTA (Supplementary Appendix \nN). That was to enhance distribution of project benefits and to recommend practical measures \nto  promote  the  development  of  indigenous  people.  A  framework  Indigenous  People \nDevelopment Plan (IPDP) was also prepared (Supplementary Appendix C). \n \n4.  Environmental Aspects \n \n83.  The Project is categorized as a \u201cB\u201d project in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines 2003. The Project, which mostly involves improving existing roads \nwithin the right-of-way, is not subject to the 1994 India Environmental Assessment Notification. \n                                                 \n20 A \u201cscheduled tribe\u201d is among the weaker sectors of India\u2019s population.  Article 342 of India Fundamental Rights, \nwhich are enshrined in the Constitution, defines \u201cscheduled tribes\u201d as specific tribes or tribal communities, or parts \nof or groups within tribes or tribal communities. \"Scheduled caste\u201d is defined as the lowest caste in the Hindu caste \nsystem. \n \n ", "    19\nThe initial environmental examination (IEE), which included an environmental management plan \nfor the sample subproject, was prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment \nGuidelines 2003.  \n \n84.  The IEE shows that the sample subproject may generate minor environmental impacts \nduring construction. But with construction activities limited to improvement of the existing road \nsections, environmental impacts will be limited to effects associated with earthwork, and the \nmovement and storage of construction materials. Most environmental impacts during operation \nwill  be  related  to  vehicle  emission  and,  in  some  road  sections,  to  embankment  erosion. \nMitigation measures related to construction, specified in the environmental management plan, \nwill  be  incorporated  into  civil  works  contracts.  Implementation  of  mitigation  concerning \nconstruction  will  be  the  contractors\u2019  responsibility.  But  PWDGOC  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementing the environmental management plan. \n \n85.  For the remaining subprojects, the environmental assessment and review procedures \nwill follow the model of the sample subproject, including that (i) PWDGOC will prepare the IEE \nincluding the environmental management plan for each remaining subproject, and submit the \nIEE reports to ADB; (ii) PWDGOC will hire an environmental consultant to prepare IEE reports \nfor the remaining subprojects; (iii) PWDGOC will review, then submit the IEE reports to ADB; \n(iv) PWDGOC will supervise and monitor implementation of the environmental management \nplans,  including  environmental  mitigation  measures  described  in  the  IEE  reports;  and  (v) \nPWDGOC will submit to ADB progress reports on the implementation of the environmental \nmanagement plans. The Project will finance no subprojects that pass through national parks or \nsanctuaries, or that widen road sections within reserve forests. \n \n86.  To address environmental concerns related to the Project, and future road projects, \nPWDGOC will establish the ESU. During the first year of project implementation, the embryo of \nESU will be part of the PIU, with staff assisted and, trained by domestic consultants. The ESU is \nexpected to operate fully in the second year of project implementation. \n \n  5.  HIV/AIDS and Human Trafficking \n \n87.  Appendix 9 gives a detailed analysis of HIV/AIDS. Given the status of HIV/AIDS in \nChhattisgarh and ongoing activities of the Chhattisgarh AIDS Control Society (CACS), the \nProject will use existing resources in the best manner possible to support HIV/AIDS preventive \nmeasures in connection with CACS\u2019s established activities. Project support will include (i) \nconducting awareness campaigns among targeted risk groups and the general public, and (ii) \nlinking and coordinating with CACS and its ongoing  HIV/AIDS programs.  Non-government \norganizations that have worked through ongoing projects of CACS are conducting awareness \ncampaigns  for  high-risk  groups.  The  Project  will  address  HIV/AIDS  concerns  during \nconstruction. The contractors will conduct awareness training on HIV/AIDS for construction \nworkers. The training programs and materials should be designed and conducted by staff of \nCACS or qualified non-government organizations (NGOs) in accordance with ongoing CACS \ncampaigns and awareness programs. This  requirement will be stipulated in all civil works \ncontracts.  Consultants  for  construction  supervision  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  the \ncontractors\u2019 implementation of programs. Findings and recommendations of the monitoring \nshould be reflected in project progress reports and submitted to ADB for review. \n \n88.  There is no official evidence of human trafficking in Chhattisgarh. No donors have \nsponsored studies to confirm official data on human trafficking. The human trafficking issue \nremains to be studied through continued policy dialogue with GOC, field surveys and social \n ", "20     \nworks, surveillance and monitoring by state agencies, and NGOs to identify problem areas and \nmeasure their implications for future projects. \n \nE.  Project Risks and Safeguards \n89.  Projected risks that the economic evaluation will not prove the Project feasible have \nbeen  examined  in  detail.  The  Project\u2019s  economic  analysis  has  been  subjected  to  a \ncomprehensive risk analysis to examine the effects of several key variables, namely (i) traffic \nvolumes in the base year, (ii) traffic growth rates, (iii) capital costs, (iv) maintenance costs, and \n(v) generated traffic. The @Risk computer program was used for risk analysis. Results indicated \nthat the probability that the EIRR of Option 1 will fall to less than 12% is only 4.8%, and the \nprobability of the EIRR of Option 2 falling below 12% is only 11.5%. These low probabilities \nindicate that the economic evaluation is \"robust\" to variations  in main parameters used to \ndetermine economic viability. The methodology and assumptions used in the risk analysis are \ndescribed fully in Supplementary Appendix K Project Risk Analysis. \n \n90.  Risks to institutional reform relate to GOC\u2019s commitment to, and ownership of, the \nProject, and GOC\u2019s abilities in make policy changes. As an ADB focal state, GOC is reform-\noriented. Good governance and good infrastructure are primary development goals. GOC has \ninitiated  institutional  reforms  to  establish  the  DRA  and  improve  its  business  process  and \nmanagement  of  state  roads,  and  has  requested  ADB\u2019s  assistance  in  designing  and \nimplementing the reform. During the entire Project processing, and through intensive policy \ndialogue, GOC has confirmed that reform is Chhattisgarh\u2019s priority for road development. To \nfurther mitigate the risks, the Time-bound Policy Action Plan was prepared, and agreed upon by \nADB and GOC (Appendix 4). The plan highlights milestones of policy measures and policy \nchanges that GOC will make within the timeframe.  It will be covenanted in the Loan and Project \nAgreements for the Project. \n \n91.  Risks  for  investment  are  limited  to  quality  control  because  of  PWDGOC\u2019s  current \ncapacity constraints on contract management and work construction supervision, and limited \nwork experiences with international contractors. This can be mitigated by consulting services for \nconstruction supervision and capacity building for PWDGOC on contract management and \nquality control. Contracts have been divided into relatively large packages to attract both \ninternational and large, qualified domestic contractors, to ensure good performance and high-\nquality construction. GOC and ADB have agreed to have intensive reviews of implementation \nprogress and issues, and of performance of consultants and contractors.  \n \n92.  Intensive preparatory works and studies were carried out on the impacts of the sample \nsubproject, which represents the main technical, social, and environmental features of the \nmajority Chhattisgarh road network.  GOC has prepared and approved a resettlement plan, an \nIEE, an indigenous people\u2019s development program, a resettlement policy framework, and an \nindigenous  people\u2019s  development  framework.  ADB  reviewed  and  found  those  safeguard \ndocuments acceptable. Furthermore, specific requirements were incorporated in the subproject \nselection criteria and covenanted in the Loan and Project Agreements, to ensure full compliance \nwith ADB\u2019s safeguard policy requirements and guidelines. \n ", "    21\nV.

I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  $180,000,000  to  India  for  the \nChhattisgarh State Roads Development Sector Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nwith interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a term of \n25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \nTadao Chino \n                       President \n24 November 2003 \n ", "24  Appendix 1 \nSUPPLEMENTARY SECTOR ANALYSIS \n \n \n1.  The sector analysis in this appendix supplements the analysis in the main text, and \nfocuses on the current road maintenance system. Chhattisgarh\u2019s road network has deteriorated \nseriously because of a 10-year neglect of investment in road development and maintenance. Of \n35,000 km of state roads, about 25% are in very poor condition and only 10% are in fair \ncondition. The other 65% of the state roads are in poor condition. This situation was caused \nmainly by three factors: \n \n(i)  Lack of quality control and supervision of road maintenance works, which is \noutsourced to private contractors, is poor.  \n(ii)  Lack of capability and capacity in modern road maintenance. Equipment for \nroutine road maintenance is inadequate and obsolete; and  \n(iii)  PWDGOC\u2019s capacity and qualified expertise for road maintenance management \nneeds immediate improvement and modernization.  \n \n2.  Since the founding of Chhattisgarh state, the Government of Chhattisgarh (GOC) has \nallocated necessary budget to improve the riding quality (IRQ) of state roads through major \nrepairs and periodic maintenance. The IRQ program will be continued for all state roads. \nAnalysis of the actual budget allocation for road maintenance over the past 3 years shows that \nGOC has given a reasonable emphasis on road maintenance as a whole. Also, analysis of labor \nuse and employee assignment showed that all casual labors and 50% of work charges were \nassigned for road maintenance. The main problems with road maintenance are quality control \nand the planning and management of maintenance.  \n \nA.  Existing Road Maintenance Activities \n3.  Chhattisgarh\u2019s  road  maintenance  system  is  based  on  the  standard  Public  Works \nDepartment  Manual  (PWDM),  which  was  published  almost  a  century  ago  and  has  been \nmodified periodically. The PWDM includes guidelines on duties and, working and administrative \nprocedures,  but  lacks  instructions  for  financial  authority  and  indicators  of  performance \nmonitoring  and  evaluation.  The  PWDM  specifies    (i)  establishment  of  the  Public  Works \nDepartment, (ii) works it will carry out, (iii) special rules for irrigation and navigation, and (iv) \nwork accounts. The PWDM categorizes PWDGOC operations as (i) original works, new works, \nalterations, and additions; and (ii) repairs and maintenance. \n \nB.  Organizational Arrangement for Road Maintenance \n4.  The  following  positions  form  a  management  tree  with  key  responsibilities  for  road \ndevelopment and maintenance. They cover decisions on planning, budget preparation and \nallocation, assignment of tasks, implementation arrangements, monitoring, and performance \nevaluation. The positions comprise (i) secretary, (ii) engineer-in-chief, (iv) chief engineers for \nzones, (iv) superintendent engineers, (v) executive engineers, (vi) sub-divisional engineers, and \n(vii) sub-engineers, or technical assistants.  \n \n5.  Detailed responsibilities of the positions, with its specific road maintenance activities, are \nin the following sections. \n ", "  Appendix 1  25 \nC.  Working Procedures \n6.  Three steps are required before PWDGOC can begin any work, other than repair, with \nits own funds: \n \n(i)  administrative  approval  (concurrence  from  the  responsible  and  competent \nauthority), \n(ii)  technical sanction (based on detailed estimates by the responsible authority), \nand \n(iii)  appropriation and re-appropriation of funds (allotment or rejection of funding \nrequirements). \n \n7.  The two types of maintenance activities are: \n \n(i)  routine maintenance, performed by casual labor with minimal technical guidance \nand little supervision, and with no clear budget allocation except salary for labor \nand materials; and \n(ii)  periodic maintenance, carried out either on schedule or in response to needs.  \n \nD.  Routine Maintenance Activities \n8.  Laborers have traditionally carried out routine road maintenance. The labor crews have \nnot been provided with appropriate tools and equipment because of scarcity of funds, or \nbecause the tools provided are obsolete. \n \n9.  The distance that the crews cover is more than they can handle with the equipment \nprovided. The crews usually walk or bicycle to their work. All routine maintenance work is \nthrough direct engagement of local contractors who, in turn, hire the labor. PWDGOC provides \nmaterials for routine maintenance, or PWDGOC procures the materials locally through its local \nbranch offices. \n \n10.  Routine maintenance normally includes patching; sealing of cracks; cleaning of ditches; \ndressing of slopes; trimming of tree branches; and white washing of safety posts, parapets, and \nhill cut slopes. \n \nE.  Periodic Maintenance \n11.  For periodic maintenance, officers in charge of each section prepare proposals based on \ninspections, which are mostly visual and with no appropriate testing. The officers then prepare \nassessment  reports  and  itemized  estimates  of  materials  needed.  Most  drawings  for \nsupplementary reference to the detailed estimates are done manually. \n \n12.  The estimates are prepared mostly for periodic maintenance, scheduled over 6\u20138 years. \nIn most cases, the type of treatment is predetermined, with no substantiating investigations of \nactual road conditions or performance indicators. \n \n13.  PWDGOC has trucks, bitumen boilers, static rollers, and drum mix plants for periodic \nmaintenance activities generally known as renewals. But the equipment has not been fully used \nor maintained, and has become obsolete, because of ineffective recovery of costs of capital, \nmaintenance, and operations. Because GOC decided to outsource road maintenance and other ", "26  Appendix 1 \nroad works to the private sector, no further budget allocations have been made to operate or \nrefurbish the equipment. \n \n14.  The PWDGOC publishes it normal rates for manual and mechanized works. The rates \nare estimated based on approved sources of material and established average lead distances \nto the nearest sources. \n  \nF.  Business Process for Periodic Maintenance \n15.  The  business  process  for  periodic  maintenance  is  initiated  at  the  section  level  by \ncollecting data on road conditions and updating the maintenance activity chart, based on the \nlast periodic maintenance. The estimates are then forwarded for scrutiny and verification, then \nto  the  sub-divisional  officers,  then  to  the  divisional  officers  or  executive engineers. The \nexecutive engineers compile data, with details of the previous year\u2019s allocations to concerned \nsections. \n \n16.  The chief engineers further compile zonal-level details from each division. The chief \nengineers prepare summary estimates detailing the number of kilometers to be maintained, and \nstructures to be repaired or replaced. These details are forwarded to the engineer-in-chief who \ncompiles the data, assisted by chief engineer (planning), and issues job orders for periodic \nmaintenance. PWDGOC maintains no database on road sections for either long-term or short- \nterm planning. \n \n17.  The  PWDM  specifies  the  following  data  collection  frequencies  for  preparing  cost \nestimates for periodic maintenance, and to rationalize the maintenance program: (i) traffic count: \ntwice yearly, (ii) road condition: once yearly, and (iii) surface condition: once yearly.  But these \ndata collections are not being implemented because funding and expertise are lacking. \n \nG.  Budget Approval \n18.  The estimates, prepared by the engineer-in-chief, are proposed to the Secretary, along \nwith other requirements for budget approval. Based on the approved budget, the engineer-in-\nchief consults with the zonal chief engineers and chief engineer (planning) about distributing the \nfunds. The main PWDGOC criteria for distributing funds are: \n  \n(i)  review of bar charts for the past 5 years on periodic renewal, \n(ii)  condition of the road and severity of the problems, and their effects on delaying \nplanned activities. \n(iii)  intervention criteria based on road condition and available funds, \n(iv)  implementation arrangements, and \n(v)  identification of eligible contractors. \n \n19.  Contractors are registered according to financial capability and equipment capacity. The \nregistrations are renewed or cancelled, based on contractors\u2019 performance. The registration and \nclassification of contractors have been revised following the provisions in the PWDM. The \nrevised thresholds for registration of contractors by class and person delegated authority to \nregister these contractors are given in Table A1.1. ", "  Appendix 1  27 \n \nTABLE A1.1: Registration Thresholds \nClass  Financial Capability  Authorized  Contact  Person  for \n  Contractor\u2019s Registration \n     \nA-I  Rs1 million  Chief engineer \nA-II  Rs5 million  Chief engineer \nA-III  Rs10 million  Engineer-in-chief \nA-IV  Rs40 million  Engineer-in-chief \n  Unlimited  Engineer-in-chief \nRs= Indian rupee(s) \nSource:  project participatory technical assistance (PPTA) final report and loan processing missions. \n \n \n20.  As part of the registration requirements, contractors must supply the certificates certified \nby the executive engineers. \n \nH.  Tendering \n21.  Periodic maintenance works are tendered to short-listed contractors based on sealed \ntenders that have been invited in an open and public manner by advertising in local or national \nnewspapers. The criteria for advertising are (i) as much as Rs500,000 for publication in regional \nor local newspapers in regional languages; (ii) Rs500,000 to Rs2,000,000 for publication at the \ndistrict level in two newspapers and at the state level in the regional language; and (iii) higher \nthan  Rs2,000,000  for  publication  in  English-language  newspapers,  and  in  two  regional \nnewspapers.  \n \nI.  Bid Evaluation \n22.  Bids are evaluated based on guidelines in the PWDM. The guidelines were recently \nupdated for implementation. For bid evaluation, a committee is formed including PWDGOC and \nFDGOC. \n \n23.  Bids  are  invited  from  qualified  and  registered  contractors.  Based  on  the  financial \nproposals and bid evaluation guidelines specified in the PWDM, PWDGOC is considering the \nadoption of bid evaluation procedures and applications for national highways projects. \n \nJ.  Quality Control  \n24.  Combined teams of representatives of PWDGOC and the contractor\u2019s normally carry out \nquality control. This mechanism is not practical for small works. In most cases, the mechanism \nis not implemented, so there is a lack of supervision or quality control. \n \nK.  Monitoring System for Contractor\u2019s Performance \n25.  Contractors  that  perform  poorly  are  not  allowed  to  bid  for  future  contracts.  New \nguidelines with special conditions to address non-performing contractors, or irregularities in their \nexecution of contracts, have not yet been implemented. Payments are monthly, but are usually \nlate because of funding constraints. Contractors can neither claim extra payment for the delays, ", "28  Appendix 1 \nnor choose the mode of compensation. The superintending engineers and chief engineers \narbitrate claims for the PWDGOC. \n \nL.  Recording and Measurement \n26.  Sub-engineers record measurements to be agreed upon by contractors. Sub-divisional \nengineers check the measurements. The agreed-upon and verified measurements are entered \ninto a measurement book. The divisional accountants verify the bills of payment before the bills \nare forwarded to the executive engineers (payment officers) for final check and payment. The \nexecutive engineers check 10% of the total payments made. \n \n27.  The current road maintenance system needs major reform and restructuring. Current \nguidelines should be revised and updated substantially, following international norms and other \nmore effective models in India, such as that implemented by the National Highway Authority of \nIndia. \n \nM.

Introduction \n1.  The Project involves improvement of about 1,700 km of priority sections of the \nexisting state roads. The subprojects will be selected during implementation according to \nthe selection criteria agreed by the Government of Chhattisgarh (GOC) and the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). Using the sector approach for the investment, a sample \nsubproject was selected as representative of the remaining state roads. The sample \nsubproject runs from Chhindgarh to Konta, a distance of 100.3 km. \n \n2.  Economic evaluation of the sample subproject was carried out by using the \nHighway and Design Maintenance Model (HDM-4). The benefits to road users were \nestimated by comparing the differences between the costs in the \u201cwithout-project\u201d case \nwith those in the \u201cwith-project\u201d case. The improved road will reduce operating costs, \nwhich will stimulate economic growth. The model compared the annual streams of \neconomic capital and operating costs and benefits and computes the net present values \n(NPV) and the economic internal rates of return (EIRR). All costs and benefits were \nexpressed in 2003 constant prices. The analysis period is for the construction period, \nfollowed by 20 years of operation.  \n \nB.  Road Condition and Traffic \n1.  Road Condition \n3.  The  existing  road  condition  has  been  investigated  through  topographic, \npavement condition, and roughness surveys. After a review of the traffic flows and \ncondition of the existing pavement, the project road was divided into three homogeneous \nsections.  Table  A8.1  shows  surface  roughness  levels  in  accordance  with  the \ninternational roughness index (IRI) for each section of the existing road. The rate of road \ndeterioration used in the economic analysis is based on the levels of surface roughness \nbefore project implementation (i.e., the \u201cwithout project\u201d case, which are compared with \nroughness values in the \u201cwith project\u201d case, and savings in vehicle operating costs \nbecause of road improvement are calculated.  \n \nTable A8.1 Road Condition Data \n \nRoad Section  Description  Distance (km)  Roughness (IRI) m/km \n       \nSection 1  Chhindgarh to Sukma  20.3  8.6 \nSection 2  Sukma to MDR 37  36.3  9.2 \nSection 3  MDR 37 to Konta  43.7  9.3 \n        IRI = International Roughness Index \n        MDR = Major District Road \n \n2.  Traffic Volume \n4.  Classified traffic volumes on the Project road were determined from 2003 traffic \nsurveys.  Six  3-day  counts  were  conducted;  three  included  1-day  origin-destination \nsurveys.  These survey results were normalized by applying seasonal factors to obtain \n ", "50   Appendix 8 \nannual average daily traffic for the base year. The traffic counts were split into motorized \ntraffic (cars and utility vehicles, buses, trucks, tractors, motorized rickshaws, and motor-\ncycles) and non-motorized traffic (bicycles). Traffic volumes on the project road sections \nranged from 1,600 2,340 vehicles per day. The average traffic composition was about \n72% motorized and 28% non-motorized vehicles.  \n \n3.  Assumptions for Growth of Traffic Rates \n5.  Traffic growth rates were based on an analyses of various parameters. Current \nand future growth in net state domestic product (NSDP) were estimated. The income \nelasticity of transport demand was used to determine the future traffic growth rate for \neach vehicle category. Traffic growth rates varied from 3 to 12% per annum, depending \non vehicle type and year. Based on the average vehicle composition for the project road, \nthe overall growth rate is projected at about 7% for 2003 to 2009, 6.6% for 2010 to 2014, \nand 6.5% beyond 2015.  \n \nC.  Costs \n6.  The Project\u2019s economic costs were derived from the financial costs, and include \nconstruction,  maintenance,  and  social  costs  from  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \ncompensation. Economic costs exclude price contingencies, taxes, duties, and interest \nduring construction. A standard conversion factor of 0.90 was applied to financial costs \nof nontraded inputs to calculate economic prices. The average economic life of the \nproject road is projected as 20 years.  \n \n7.  Two investment options were tested for the project road.option 1 was to widen \nthe existing road to an intermediate-lane standard of 5.5 m over the three identified \nsections; Option 2 was to widen the existing one-lane road to two lanes of 7.0 m.    \n \nD.  Benefits \n8.  The Project\u2019s main economic benefits were quantified in terms of savings in \nvehicle  operating  costs  (VOCs),  because  better  road  surface  can  improve  VOCs. \nSavings in VOCs accrue to \u201cnormal\u201d traffic, or traffic that would continue on the road \neven with no mi provements; and to generated traffic, or traffic that was not there \npreviously, but road improvements will make possible. The benefits due to generated \ntraffic are considered to be 50% of the savings in normal traffic. Time savings were not \nevaluated in the analysis. The reasoning is that, in economic theory, the savings in time \nwould have to be put to another productive use in order to be included in the evaluation. \nIt can be argued, for example, that farmers in the project area could put some of the time \nsaved to a productive use through more intensive cropping. But this economic evaluation \nhas estimated benefits conservatively, by concentrating only on VOC cost savings to \nnormal and generated traffic. \n \n9.  The benefits to road users were estimated by calculating the differences between \nthe costs in the \u201cwithout project\u201d case and the \u201cwith project\u201d case. The HDM-4 model \nwas used to estimate the benefits over time. The model predicts pavement deterioration \nand estimates yearly VOCss over the life of the investment for various improvement \nstrategies. In both the \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d project cases, the road roughness level varies \nfrom  year  to  year  depending  on  traffic  and  maintenance.  The  roughness  level, \nexpressed as IRI, has a direct impact on VOCs and thus, on benefits. The model then \n ", "Appendix 8   51 \ncompares life cycle costs for the \u201cwith\u201d project and \u201cwithout\u201d project situations, and \ncomputes the NPV and estimates the EIRR.  \n \nE.  Economic Internal Rate of Return \n10.  The economic evaluation discounts the stream of costs and benefits over the \nperiod 2004 to 2025, and values them at present 2003 levels.  The EIRR was calculated \nfor each project road options. TheEIRR for Option 1 (intermediate land, 5.5 m) was 18.3; \nthe EIRR for Option 2 (twolands, 7m) was 17.5. Supplementary Appendix J gives details \non the individual economic evaluations for each project road option.  \n \nF.  Sensitivity Analysis and Risk Analysis \n11.  The sensitivity of the project road EIRR for each option was analyzed with \nrespect to changes in the benefit and cost streams. Seven sensitivity test cases were \nexamined: (i) a 20% increase in construction costs, (ii) a 20% reduction in benefits, (iii) a \n50% decrease in traffic growth rates, (iv) no generated traffic benefits, (v) a 2-year \nproject implementation delay, (vi) less than optimal road maintenance,1, and (vii) a \ncombination of a 20% increase in capital costs and a 20% reduction of benefits. Results \nshow that the quantified economic benefits are quite robust to various sensitivity tests, \nand the project remains economically viable (Table A9.2). The only test in which the \nEIRR falls below 12% is if the traffic growth rates decreases by 50%. The probability of \nthis occurring is relatively small, as the risk analysis will show. \n \nTable A8.2 Results of Sensitivity Tests  \n \nOption 1  Option 2 \nIntermediate  Two  \nSection  Lanes  Lanes \n  EIRR (%)  EIRR (%) \nBase Case  18.3  17.5 \n     \nCapital Costs increase by 20%  16.1  15.4 \nBenefits Reduced by 20%  15.6  14.9 \nDecrease in Traffic Growth Rates by 50%  9.9  8.2 \nNo Generated Traffic Benefits  18.0  17.2 \nTwo-year Implementation Delay  15.9  15.3 \nLess than Optimal Maintenance   13.8  14.9 \nCapital Costs Increase 20% & Benefits  13.6  12.9 \nDecrease \u2013 20% \nEIRR = economic international rate of return \nSource: PPTA and ADB Loan Fact-Finding Mission \n \n12.  A risk analysis was also undertaken for both options, using the @Risk computer \nsoftware program. The risk analysis enables an analysis based on the uncertainty in \n                                                 \n1  In the \u201cbase\u201d situation the maintenance in the \u201cwith\u201d project situation allowed for an overlay when the IRI \nwas greater than or equal to 6.0 m/km. For the sensitivity test for less than optimal maintenance the \noccurrence of an overlay has been removed from the analysis i.e. no overlay will occur on the project \nroad. Although this is an extreme case it indicates the worst effect on the EIRR of the project under this \nsensitivity test. \n ", "52   Appendix 8 \nestimates of input parameters. The risk analysis was based on triangular probability \ndistributions for the main input parameters. The risk analysis runs a simulation, in which \npossible values of the variables were randomly sampled 5,000 times using a Monte \nCarlo non-stratified technique. Risk analysis then uses this information to analyze every \npossible outcome, executing hundreds of \u201cwhat-if\u201d scenarios. In each scenario, random \ninputs following the defined input probability distribution are generated, and the resulting \nfrequency distributions are presented graphically. Results from the analyses indicated \nthat the probability of the EIRR for Option 1 falling below 12% is 4.8% and the probability \nof the EIRR for Option 2 falling below 12% is 11.5%. The @Risk model calculated the \nnew mean EIRR for Option 1 as 14.3%. The minimum and maximum value of the EIRR \nfor Option 1 was calculated as 10.5% and 17.8% respectively. The mean value of the \nEIRR for Option 2 was calculated as 13.6%. The minimum and maximum value of the \nEIRR for Option 2 was calculated as 9.8% and 17.0% respectively. A description of the \nmethodology used in the risk analysis is described in Supplementary Appendix K, \nProject Risk Analysis, describes the methodology used in the risk analysis. \n \nG.  Distribution Analysis and Poverty Impact Ratio \n13.  The economic benefits of the two options for the project road are road-user \nbenefits: voc savings for normal and for generated traffic. The distribution analysis \ndisaggregates  those  economic  benefits  to  passenger  and  freight  users,  vehicle \nowners/operators, labor,2, and the GOC.  \n \n14.  It was necessary to estimate (i) how much of the benefits for each vehicle \ncategory in the analysis will be passed on to vehicle users, and (ii) ownership of each \nvehicle category. To do this, field  surveys of passengers, drivers, and farmers were \nconducted in the project road area. From survey results, assumptions were made of \nwhat benefits will be passed on to the service users. (Supplementary Appendix J).  \n \n15.  Distribution analysis of the project road was used to estimate a poverty impact \nratio (PIR) by determining how much of the benefits to each user class passed on to the \npoor. Supplementary Appendix J describes, in detail the assumptions made from the \nfield surveys.  \n \n16.  The estimated direct benefits of the two options to the economy in present value \nterms, and the PIR calculations, are in Supplementary Appendix J, Table SAJ.13 for \nOption 1 and in Table SAJ.14 for Option 2. A discount rate of 12% is used in both \noptions. The estimated direct benefits of Option 1 are Rs702.87 million, in present value \nterms. These figures simply represent the sum of the present value of benefits to \npassengers, freight users, vehicle owners, and GOC. The net benefit to the economy as \na whole is Rs 300.18 million. For Option 2, the estimated direct benefits are Rs759.12 \nmillion and the net benefit to the economy is Rs292.46 million. The PIR for Option 1 is \n1.07 and for Option 2, is 1.17. These are conservative estimates, because only direct \nproject benefits have been considered. Based on the somewhat-uncertain assumptions \nin the PIR calculation, a sensitivity analysis of some key assumptions was conducted. \nThe sensitivity tests were (i) a 50% increase in competition, and (ii) a 50% decrease in \n                                                 \n2  As some of the projects capital expenditure and maintenance costs will be spent on local labor, unskilled \nlaborers will gain net benefits to the extent that their paid wages are higher than their opportunity cost of \nlabor (reflected in the SWRF).  \n ", "Appendix 8   53 \ncompetition. Table SAJ.15 shows that an increase in competition leads to an increase in \nthe PIR. \n \n17.  Results of a risk analysis on the PIR show that the expected PIR, based on the \nweighted average of all simulated combinations, is 1.24 for Option 1 and 1.01 for Option \n2. PIR\u2019s range from a minimum of 0.56 to a maximum of 2.26 for Option 1 and from a \nminimum of 0.58 to a maximum of 1.52 for Option 2. The risk analysis undertaken is \ndescribed in Supplementary Appendix K. \n \n18.  Further  details  of  the  assumptions  and  calculations  used  for  the  economic \nanalysis  and  distribution  analysis  for  both  Option  1  and  Option  2  are  given  in \nSupplementary Appendix J gives more details of the assumptions and calculations used \nfor the economic analyses and distribution analyses for Options 1 and 2. \n \n \n \n ", "54   Appendix 9 \nSUMMARY OF POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY \n \n \nA.  Contribution of the Project to Reduce Poverty \n1.  Chhattisgarh is one India\u2019s poorest state. Studies show that about 45% of the \nstate\u2019s population of 21 million is poor, living below the official poverty line, compared \nwith about 35% of India\u2019s population as a whole. \n \n2.  The Project involves improvement of about 1,700 km of priority state roads. The \nsubprojects will be selected during implementation according to criteria agreed between \nthe  Government  of  Chhattisgarh  (GOC)  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB). \nBecause of the sector approach taken for the Project, a sample subproject was selected \nas  representative  of  the  remaining  subprojects.  The  sample  subproject  runs  from \nChhindgarh to Konta, a distance of 100.3 km. \n \n3.  The Project is classified as poverty intervention, and will directly reduce poverty \nby lowering transport costs for the poor traveling to labor markets, farmers\u2019 markets, and \nhealth and education centers.  \n \n4.  Rehabilitating the representative sample subproject in Dantewada district will \nhave a large effect on reducing poverty, directly benefiting 237,000 people in a 30-km \nzone  of  influence.  Of  these,  an  estimated  117,000  poor  people  will  be  direct \nbeneficiaries,  or  about  50%  of  the  total  direct  beneficiaries.  These  estimates  of \nbeneficiaries  include  only  those  who  will  benefit  in  the  long  run  from  the  lowered \ntransport  costs  and  induced  economic  and  social  development.  This  headcount \napproach  gives  an  estimate  of  poor  beneficiaries  that  is  higher  than  the  poverty \nincidence in Chhattisgarh. The poverty line used to define the \u201cpoor\u201d is the nationally \nrecognized maximum estimated expenditure of Rs.311/ person per month. \n \n5.  Benefits to the poor from lower transport costs will become evident through \nhigher profit margins for agricultural product profit margins for poor farmers, as well as \nlower costs and more timely access to schools, medical clinics and employment centers. \nFurthermore, the lower transport costs will increase mobility among the poor, especially \npoor women, to reach social centers and become more politically active, thus increasing \nthe social and political activities of the poor.  \n \n6.  To obtain information on use of the Project road, passengers, drivers, freight \nshippers, and local residents in its zone of influence were surveyed. The surveys, \ncompleted in May 200,3 showed that 95% of the population in the zone of influence use \nthe project road. The surveys also showed that and that half the passengers and \nhouseholds within the impact zone are poor, and a fourth very poor, based on the official \nnational poverty line.  \n \n7.  Survey  results  for  the  remaining  project  roads  were  based  on  direct  field \nobservations of a carefully selected representative sample of 10 road links in the state \nroad system that the Project may improve. The road samples selected for the survey \nrepresent about 30% of the 1,700 km of state roads that the Project should improve. \n \n8.  The survey of passengers showed that the poor are heavy users of the roads. \nAverage per-capita passenger income is estimated at Rs384 per month; the nation\u2019s \n ", "Appendix 9   55 \nofficial poverty level is Rs311 per month. Classifying those whose per-capita incomes is \nless than or equal to Rs311 per month as very poor, 35 to 40% of Chhattisgarh\u2019s state \nroads are very poor. Using Rs400 per month as the line to define poor, about 55 to 60% \nof the passengers are poor.  \n \n9.  The  surveys  showed  that  farmers  comprise  90%\u2014and  subsistence  farmers, \n78%\u2014of those in the zone of influence for the sample subproject. The survey also show \nthat of the remaining 22% of farmers who sell agricultural produce, high transport costs \nforce all poor and very poor to sell their products only in markets that are nearby; they \ncannot access more distant markets where prices are higher. The surveys also showed \nthat non-poor farmers use these roads to ship their products to more distant markets, \ndespite bad road conditions. Better road conditions will improve access for the poor to \nthese more distant and larger markets. The improved roads will also reduce spoilage of \nagricultural produce benefiting both poor and non-poor farmers. The surveys and focus \ngroups showed that the degree of competition in the transport services market, including \npassenger and freight services, varies depending on the road condition. Competition is \ngreater on roads in better condition, but traffic is low and competition is weak on roads in \nvery worn condition, traffic is low and competition is weak on roads in very worn \ncondition. That competition will become much stronger as the roads are improved \nthrough  the  Project.  With  the  poor  being  such  heavy  road  users,  and  competition \nhindered by poor roads, the Project will catalyze competition and service frequency, thus \nreducing freight rates.  That will cause even more intense use of the Project roads by the \npoor. This finding substantiates estimates of the Project\u2019s effects on the poor.   \n \n10.  A poverty impact ratio (PIR) was calculated for the sample subproject for both of \nthe improvement options: Option 1 which improves the project road to an intermediate \nstandard of 5.5 m, and Option 2, which improves the project road to a two-lane standard \nof 7.0 m. The PIR calculated for Option 1 is 1.07 for Option 2, 1.17. These results \nassume  the  prevailing  level  of  competition  in  the  passenger  and  freight  transport \nmarkets. Descriptions of the distribution analysis and the resulting PIR calculation are in \nAppendix 8 and Supplementary Appendix J. Because of the level of uncertainty in \nchanges to key variables in the PIR computation, (e.g., the level of competition in the \ntransport  market  etc.),  both  a  sensitivity  analysis  and  a  risk  analysis  were  also \nundertaken. The sensitivity analysis is described in Appendix 8 and Supplementary \nAppendix J. The risk analysis is described in more detail in Supplementary Appendix K, \nProject Risk Analysis.  \n  \nB.  Participatory Process \n11.  Community consultations and the social assessment showed unanimous support \nfor improving state highways, major district roads and rural roads. According to the \nresidents, poor road conditions increase the costs of access by the poor to health clinics, \nschools, labor markets, and farmers\u2019 markets.  By improving the Project roads, the poor \nresidents see that costs will decline and they will have easier access to key institutions \nthat determine their quality of life. In the focus groups, improved access ranked among \nthe  top  three  critical  needs  that  participants  identified.  Other  top  needs  included \nimproving the water management system, increasing the electricity supply, and lowering \nthe costs of education. The consultations also showed that the poor, especially poor \nwomen, are concerned about road safety, and the lack of bus stops in villages and \nhamlets. Residents are aware that bad road conditions and lack of access increases the \n ", "56   Appendix 9 \ncosts of farm inputs and delivery of farm products to markets and the resulting high \ntransport costs cuts their farm incomes. \n \n12.  Improved access ranked among the top three critical needs that participants \nidentified. Other top needs include improving the water management system, increasing \nthe supply of electricity, and lowering the cost of education. The consultations also \nshowed that the poor, especially poor women are concerned about road safety, and the \nlack of bus stops in the villages and hamlets.  Residents are aware that the low-quality \nroad conditions and lack of access increases the cost of retrieving farm inputs, delivering \nfarm products to market, and that these high transport costs cut their farm incomes.   \n \n13.  Based on findings and recommendations from the community consultations, the \nProject  design  will  incorporate  improvements  to  shoulders  to  improve  safety  for \npedestrians  and  non-motorized  traffic;  covered  bus  stops  with  seating;  wayside \namenities;  and  truck  stops,  to  reduce  road  congestion  where  necessary.  The \nimprovements will be made if they do not entail land acquisition  or resettlement. To \naddress concerns about road safety, the design will include information signs and speed \nbreaks near schools, hospitals, and areas with heavy pedestrians traffic, such as towns \nand markets. Also, the Project will adopt a community road safety program designed for \nrural roads in Chhattisgarh for implementation on state roads, especially on accident- \nprone zones near urban and large settlement areas. \n \nC.  Gender Issues \n14.  Research elsewhere in Madhya Pradesh and in South Asia has shown that when \naccess is difficult, men participate more actively in society than women.  When access \nimproves, as it will through the Project, women become more mobile and more socially \nactive;  they  are  better  able  to  reach  centers  of  political  activity,  and  gain  political \nempowerment. Thus, the Project will thus increase women\u2019s empowerment. \n \n15.  The public consultations showed that men receive substantially higher wage than \nwomen who provide the same labor. The Project will encourage employment targets for \nwomen to participate in road construction, and require contractors to pay the same \nwages to men and women for work of equal value. Targeting and providing a quota for \nwomen in road rehabilitation will provide employment where such opportunities are \nscarce, and allow women to increase family incomes. During the rehabilitation phase the \ncontractors  will  be  required  to  provide  service  stations  that  will  improve  working \nconditions for women who take on road works jobs.  A gender strategy is not required as \na project component. \n \nD.  Resettlement \n16.  The subproject selection criteria and technical design include recommendations \nfor road improvements that will not entail land acquisition. Involuntary resettlement will \nbe limited to the dismantling of a small number of encroachments3 at a few spots. \nFollowing ADB\u2019s policy requirements for involuntary resettlement under sector lending, \nand to mitigate adverse impacts on affected people, The Chhattisgarh Public Works \nDepartment  (PWDGOC)  prepared  a  resettlement  plan  and  a  resettlement  policy \n                                                 \n3 Less than 200 persons affected with insignificant impacts for all subprojects including the core Project \nroad. \n ", "Appendix 9   57 \nframework for implementation in the sample subproject. GOC will prepare and submit \nresettlement plans for each subproject to ADB for approval civil works contracts are \nawarded. \n \n17.  An institutional assessment on PWDGOC\u2019s capacity to undertake resettlement \nresponsibilities  showed  that  a  need  to  strengthen  such  capacity.  The  Project will \ncontribute, through consulting services for institutional improvement, to strengthen the \ncapacity to manage the resettlement by conducting workshops and seminars to create \nsocial awareness and strengthen coordination among the government and civil societies \nconcerned  in  addressing  resettlement  problems,  particularly  those  related  to  road \nimprovements.  \n \n18.  To  support  the  sector  development  initiative,  a  social  and  environment \nmanagement unit will be established within the Agency for Road Development\u2019s (ARD) \nPIU for the Project, following the example of the National Highway Authority of India. The \nunit will be responsible for social impact assessment, including (i) monitoring of the \nimplementation of resettlement plans and social mitigating measures for projects, (ii) \nimplementation  of  measures  to  mitigate  social  and  resettlement  impacts,  (iii) \nimplementation of resettlement plans approved by ADB, and (iv) capacity building for \nARD and the Dedicated Road Authority (DRA) for undertaking those responsibilities. \nSupplementary  Appendix  D  provides  the  Resettlement  Policy  Framework  and \nSupplementary Appendix M provides the Summary Resettlement Action Plan for the \nsample subproject. \n \nE.  Indigenous People \n19.  About 44% of Chhattisgarh\u2019s population  is tribal and scheduled castes.4  The \nProject is confined to existing road alignment, so such groups with its influence area will \nnot be affected. The improved road network will improve their access to services and \neconomic opportunities for tribal and scheduled castes, and for all segments of the \npopulation. But because the high percentage of tribal and scheduled caste population in \nthe Project influence areas, a detailed analysis of the status of indigenous people, and a \nreview of GOC\u2019s current policies for their development were conducted under the Project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  (Supplementary  Appendix  C).  The  purpose  is  to \nenhance distribution of project benefits and recommend practical measures to promote \nindigenous people development. A Framework Indigenous People Development Plan \n(IPDP) was also prepared (Supplementary Appendix N).  \n \nF.  HIV/AIDS and Human Trafficking \n \n20.  According to the statistics of the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO), \nmore than 4.5 million people in India were infected by HIV/AIDS5 by late 2002. That is a \n15% increase over 2001. Only 55 cases of HIV/AIDS were reported in Chhattisgarh in \n2002, in a population of about 21 million. The low incident rates could be partly related to \nChhattisgarh\u2019s isolation, but it might also partly be explained by the absence, until \n                                                 \n4 \u201cScheduled Tribe\u201d is one of the weaker sections of Indian population.  Article 342 of India Fundamental \nRights, which are enshrined in the Constitution that Scheduled Tribe is defined as specific tribes or tribal \ncommunities or parts of or groups within tribes or tribal communities. \"Scheduled Caste\u201d is defined as the \nlowest caste in the Hindu caste system. \n \n5 human immunodeficiency virus/ acquired immunedeficiency syndrome \n ", "58   Appendix 9 \nrecently, of HIV/AIDS testing and surveillance facilities in Chhattisgarh. In July 2003, the \nChhattisgarh State AIDS Control Society (CACS) established nine centers for HIV/AIDS \ntesting and counseling through GOC\u2019s programs on HIV/AIDS prevention. After the \ncenters\u2019  first  full  year  of  operation,  more  accurate  data  on  HIV/AIDS  is  expected. \nMeanwhile, CACS, in an interim report, identified 428 sites at risk of HIV/AIDS, including \nlocation frequented by truck drivers, brothels and floating facilities for commercial sex \nworkers. Given the current status of HIV/AIDS in Chhattisgarh, and CACS\u2019 established \nand ongoing activities, the Project will make best use of the existing resources to support \nHIV/AIDS prevention. Project activities will include (i) conducting awareness campaign \namong targeted risk groups and the general public, and (ii) linking and coordinating with \nCACS and its ongoing HIV/AIDS programs. \n \n21.  Some non-government agencies (NGOs) are working through CACS projects to \nconduct awareness campaigns for high-risk groups, so the Project will focus on the \nHIV/AIDS issue during the construction period. The contractors will be required to \nprovide awareness training on HIV/AIDS for construction workers. The training materials \nand  programs  should  be  designed  and  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  CACS \ncampaigns and awareness programs. This requirement will be stipulated in all civil works \ncontracts. Consultants for construction supervision will be responsible for the monitoring \nthe contractors\u2019 implementation of the programs. Findings and recommendations of the \nmonitoring  should  be  reflected  in  the  project  progress  reports  prepared  by  the \nconstruction supervision consultants and submitted to the ADB for review. \n \n22.  At the PWDGOC level, the consultants or CACS or NGO staff will train staff of \nthe social and environmental unit in HIV/AIDs prevention by for implementation of the \ninstitutional improvement, and to coordinate with CACS and other concerned state \nagencies. \n \n23.  Regarding human trafficking, there is no official evidence of human trafficking \ncases in Chhattisgarh as of today. Neither there is any study undertaken by donors to \nconfirm official data on human trafficking. The issue of human trafficking will remain to \nbe studied through continuing policy dialogue with the GOC, field surveys and social \nworks, surveillance and monitoring by various state agencies and NGOs concerned to \nidentify areas of problems and measure the magnitude of impacts for development of \nmitigating measures in future projects. \n \nG.  Labor Issues \n24.  The Project will ensure that the civil works contractors comply with all applicable \nlabor laws and will not employ children for construction or maintenance jobs. Contractors \nwill be required to provide appropriate facilities for child dependants in construction \ncampsites. \n \nH.  Other Social Risks and Vulnerabilities \n25.  The primary risks to project implementation are: (i) executing agencies and other \nstakeholders  may  lack  the  capacity  to  address  social  and  poverty  issues;  (ii)  the \nabsorptive capacity of PWDGOC may be lower than initially assessed and thus, require \ninstitutional strengthening beyond that proposed for the Project; (iii) a lack of competition \nin the bus transport services market may arrests the flow of benefits to the poor; and (iv) \n ", "Appendix 9   59 \nadditional regulation of the freight services market may set freight rates so high that \nbenefits are not passed to the poor.   \n \n26.  The project design incorporates countermeasures to mitigate these risks.  To \nmitigate the remaining risks, the Project will: \n \n(i)  design  and  implement  a  strong  project  monitoring  system  to  provide \nfeedback for timely remedies, \n(ii)  provide institutional support to PWDGOC during implementation,  \n(iii)  provide  a  long-term  institutional  specialist  to  help  implement  the \nrestructuring of PWDGOC;  \n(iv)  provide  consulting  services  for  institutional  strengthening  to  the \nChhattisgarh Transport Department to assist in deregulation, and \n(v)  involve  ADB  in  close  project  supervision  to  correct  flaws  in  design  or \nimplementation. \n \n27.  A specific risk is that the poor may not be enabled to realize the expected \nbenefits.  To ensure that the poor are able to share these benefits, the design consultant \nwill develop a program based on strong public participation in a number of workshops \nthat will educate: \n \n(i)  poor farmers on to how to use commercial inputs,  \n(ii)  poor farmers on how to best market their surplus products, \n(iii)  poor passengers on how to negotiate lower fares to reflect the cost savings \ngoing to the bus and taxi drivers,  \n(iv)  poor  shippers  of  products  on  how  to  negotiate  lower  freight  charges \nreflecting the improved road conditions, and \n(v)  poor women on increasing their political and social involvement in the \ncommunity. \n \n28.  The  design  consultant,  together  with  the  Executing  Agency  and  ADB,  will \ndevelop and implement the project performance management system. The system will \nprovide feedback on a number of indicators to show that the benefits are being passed \nto the road users, particularly poor users, as well as residents in the zone of influence. \nSome illustrative indicators that show the benefits being passed to the poor will include \n \n(i)  use of improved construction materials by residents, and poor residents, for \ndwellings in the zone of influence; \n(ii)  increased commercial sales of specific farm products, including rice, wheat, \ngram, and sorghum from the zone of influence; \n(iii)  lower passenger fares on improved roads; and \n(iv)  lower freight rates on improved roads. \n \n "], "metadata": {"Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 5.0.5 (Windows)", "Author": "", "ModDate": "D:20071128160553+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20031125184313+08'00'", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 5.0 for Word", "Title": "Chhattisgarh State Roads Development Sector Project", "Keywords": "indian roads development project, chhattisgarh roads development, indian roads highways project"}}
