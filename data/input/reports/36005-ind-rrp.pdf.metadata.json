The  summary  IEE  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix E.  \n \nThe Project will improve the connectivity of the state road network \nin  Chhattisgarh.  It  will  provide  a  more  effective  institutional  and \npolicy  framework;  and  the  capacity  to  ensure  that  investments  in \nroads  are  implemented  successfully,  and  that  project-generated \nimpacts  in  road  development  are  sustained  through  improved \ngovernance and accountability. \n \nThe  Public  Works  Department,  Government  of  Chhattisgarh \n(PWDGOC),  with  its  existing  institutional  and  technical  capability \nand capacity, is reaching its limit in effective sector management \nand efficient management of investments in state roads. This, and \nthe \nin  road \nimprovement and maintenance, has caused serious deterioration \nof most state roads. The riding quality of most roads ranges from \npoor to very poor. Poor road quality has undermined the long-term \ngrowth  potential  of  Chhattisgarh  economy.  Bad  roads  have \nincreased  transport  capacity  bottlenecks,  and  meant  poorer \ntransport services for the entire economy, especially the rural poor \nand tribal populations.  \n \nBetter  management  of  the  road  sector  is  crucial  to  support  the \npolicy  initiative  of  the  Government  of  Chhattisgarh  (GOC)  to \nimprove  this  situation.  Better  road  management  will  improve  the \ninstitutional  and  policy  framework.    It  will  help  ensure  that \ninvestments \nroad  sector  development  are  successfully \nimplemented and the road improvements generated by the Project \ncan  be  sustained  through  better  governance  and  accountability. \nThe road sector investment is expected to help GOC significantly \nimprove  the  connectivity  of  Chhattisgarh\u2019s  road  network,  to \ndirectly  support  the  state\u2019s  economic  growth.  Meanwhile,  the \ninvestment will also provide a vehicle through which Chhattisgarh \ncan  establish  a  transparent and conducive environment for more \ncompetition and increased private sector participation in the road \nsector.  That \ninfrastructure  and \nturn,  will  ensure  better \ndecreased recurrent costs for road maintenance over the medium \nand  long  terms.    That  will  allow  higher  expenditures  for  priority \nsocial sectors, and for poverty reduction. \n\ninvestment \n\nin \n\nin \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nObjectives and Scope  \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \n\n \n\nthrough  sector \n\nlending  modality,  will \n\n \nThe  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  support  economic  growth \nand  reduce  poverty  by  providing  improved  connectivity  and \naccess \nto  development  opportunities  and  social  services, \nincluding  health  and  education.  The  Project  will  also  support \nGOC\u2019s initiative to improve state management of the road sector \nby  improving  effectiveness  and  efficiency.  Thus,  the  Project  will \nprovide  the  capacity  required  to  ensure  the  efficiency  and \nsustainability  of  road  investments  and  development  to  support \nsocial and economic development. The objective will be achieved \nthrough  (i)  improving  priority  state  roads  between  economic \ngrowth centers and rural areas, (ii) instituting measures to improve \ngovernance  and  accountability  for  road  sector  management,  (iii) \nimproving sector capability and building capacity for more efficient \nresource  and  asset  management,  and  (iv)  initiating  steps  to \nincrease  private  sector  participation  in  road  development  and \nmaintenance projects. \n \nThe  Project, \nfinance \nimprovement of about 1,700 km of state roads in Chhattisgarh. It \nwill  improve  the  connectivity  of  the  road  network,  and  of  priority \nroad  links  among  national  highways,  state  highways,  and  rural \nroads to improve access of rural and underdeveloped populations \nto  the  mainstream  economy  and  development  opportunities.  The \nProject  will  defer  huge  reconstruction  costs  that  will  result  if \nimprovement and rehabilitation are not undertaken immediately. It \nwill  also  complement  the  Rural  Roads  Sector  I  Project  of  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). \n \nConsulting  services  will  be  provided  to  help  PWDGOC  prepare \nand  implement  the  road  improvement  subprojects,  construction \nsupervision, capacity building and training in project management \nand  quality  control.  Consulting  services  will  also  be  provided  to \nhelp GOC  improve  the  institutional  and  policy  frameworks  of  the \nstate \nfor  good  governance  and  better \naccountability of sector management, (ii) establishing sustainable \nsystems  of  asset  management,  and  (iii)  capacity  building  and \ntraining in modern sector management and operation. \n \nThe total Project cost in 2003 prices is estimated at $285.7 million \nequivalent,  of  which  the  foreign  exchange  cost  is  estimated  at \n$199.52  million,  or  70%.  The  local  currency  cost,  including  taxes \nand  duties,  is  estimated  at  $86.18  million  equivalent,  or  30%  of \nthe  total.  The  cost  estimate  includes  contingencies;  a  front-end \nfee  of  0.5%  of  the  total  loan  amount  of  the  Project;  and  interest \ncharge during construction (IDC); and the commitment charge.  \n \n\ninstitutions \n\nroad \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  $180  million  from  its \nordinary capital resources,  which  will  be  63%  of  the  total  project \ncost.  The  loan  will  finance:  (i)  the  Project\u2019s  entire  foreign \nexchange  cost,  excluding  front-end fee, the commitment charge, \nand interest during construction; and (ii) part of the local currency \ncosts for domestic consulting services to prepare the subprojects \nto  be  selected  during  project  implementation,  and  to  help  GOC \nimplement the institutional reform. \n \nGOC will provide the remaining local currency cost of about $85.7 \nmillion  equivalent.  Appendix  6  summarizes  the proposed Project \nfinancing  plan.  GOC  has  assured \nthe \ncounterpart financing as committed. \n \n\nit  will  secure \n\nthat \n\nA loan of $180,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will \nbe  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility. The loan \nwill  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  5-year  grace  period;  an \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nlending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum;  a \nfront-end fee of 0.5%; and other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft Loan and Project Agreements. \n  \n \nJuly 2009 \n \nJanuary 2009 \n\nImplementation  Unit \n\n \nPWDGOC will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the Project.  \n \nWithin  PWDGOC,  the  Agency  for  Road  Development  (ARD)  will \nbe established to be responsible for the overall project execution \n(PIU), \nand  supervision.  The  Project \nestablished in September 2003, will be responsible for day-to-day \nimplementation.  The  PIU  field  offices  will  be  established  at  key \nlocations to help implement and manage the improvement works. \n \nThe Road Management Committee (RMC) to be formed in March \n2004, will oversee and provide policy support and coordination for \ntimely implementation of institutional reform and capacity building, \nand help monitor project implementation. \n \nADB  has  approved  advance  procurement  action  for  the  sample \nsubproject  civil  works.  All  procurement  to  be  financed  under  the \nProject will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement.  \n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency  \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\n\fConsulting  services  to  be  financed  under  the  Project  will  be \nrecruited  using  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  in  accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \nprocedures  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  recruitment  of  domestic \nconsultants. \n \nSocial  and  poverty  assessments  show  that  the  main  project \nbeneficiaries will be people living in areas that are predominantly \nagricultural,  rural,  and  economically  backward.  The  Project  is \nexpected to benefit 1.7 million people in a 30-km zone of influence \naround  the  state  roads  to  be  improved.  Of  these,  an  estimated \n0.77 million people, or 45%, will be direct beneficiaries. \n \nThe  main  quantifiable  benefits  of  the  Project  are  (i)  savings  in \nvehicle operating costs, which will be passed on to the rural poor \nthrough  service  providers;  and  (ii)  savings  in  travel  time.  Non-\nquantifiable benefits will be realized through improved access to \nmarkets  and  social  services  for  the  agricultural  population  and \nrural poor, which reflects higher profits for poor farmers; and lower \ntransport costs and better access to schools, medical clinics, and \nemployment centers. \n \nThe  Project  will  help  reduce  poverty  by lowering transport costs \nfor  poor  farmers,  and  lower  costs  and  more  timely  access  to \nschools, medical clinics and employment centers. \n \nThe  lower  transport  costs  will  also  increase  mobility  among  the \npoor,  especially  poor  women  going  to  social  centers.  That will \nallow them to become more politically active, thus increasing their \nempowerment. \n \nThe  institutional  improvement  will  enhance  the  institutional  and \npolicy framework of sector management and provide the capacity \nto  ensure  efficiency  of  investment  and  sustain  the  Project\u2019s \ndevelopment impacts. Its proposed support for asset management \nand  road  maintenance  will  ensure  that  roads  built  or  improved \nunder the Project will be adequately maintained. \n \n\nvi \n\n \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nvii \n\n(ii) \n\nrates, \n\ntraffic  growth \n\n(iii)  capital  costs, \n\nThe  risk  that  the  economic  evaluation  will  not  prove  the  Project \nfeasible has been examined in detail. The economic analysis has \nbeen  subjected  to  a  comprehensive  risk  analysis  to  examine  the \neffects  of  the  following  key  variables:  (i)  base  yearly  traffic \n(iv) \nvolumes, \nmaintenance  costs,  and  (v)  generated  traffic.  The  risk  analysis \nwas  undertaken  using  @Risk  computer  program.  Results  of  the \nanalysis indicated that the probability of the economic internal rate \nof  return  (EIRR)  of  Option  1  falling  below  12%  is  only  4.8%,  and \nthe  probability  of  the  EIRR  of  Option  2  falling  below  12%  is  only \n11.5%.  These  low  probabilities  indicate  that  the  economic \nevaluation  is  robust  to  a  variety  of  variations  in  the  main \nto  determine  economic  viability.  The \nparameters  used \nmethodology  and  assumptions  used  in  the  risk  analysis  are \ndescribed  fully  in  Supplementary  Appendix  K,  Project  Risk \nAnalysis. \n \nRisks  to  institutional  improvement  relate  to  GOC\u2019s  commitment, \nownership of the Project, and ability to change policies. As one of \nthe  ADB\u2019s  focal  states,  GOC  is  reform-oriented,  and  has \nenvisaged  good  governance  and  good  infrastructure  as  primary \ndevelopment goal for Chhattisgarh. GOC has initiated institutional \nreform  to  establish  the  Dedicated  Road  Authority  (DRA)  and  to \nimprove its business procedures and management of state roads. \nGOC  has  also  requested  ADB  assistance  in  designing  and \nimplementing \nthe  sector  reform.  GOC  has  confirmed  and \nreassured  its  commitment  to,  and  ownership  of  the  reform \nthroughout  project  processing,  and  through  intensive  policy \ndialogue  and  that  the  sector  reform  is  the  top  priority  of \nChhattisgarh\u2019s road development program.  \n \nTo  further  mitigate  the  risks,  a  time-bound policy action plan has \nbeen  prepared,  which  highlights  the  major  milestones  of  policy \nmeasures and policy changes that GOC is to make within the time \nframe  agreed  with  ADB.  A  condition  for  loan  negotiations  is  that \nGOC  will  approve  and  submit  the  action  plan  to  ADB  before \nnegotiations  begin.  All  other  policy  measures  will  be covenanted \nin the Loan and Project Agreements. \n \n \n \n\nRisks and Safeguards \n\n \n\n\fRisks  for  investment  are  limited  to  quality  control  because  of \nCGPWD\u2019s  capacity  constraints  in  contract  management  and \nsupervision  of  works,  and  limited  experience  in  working  with \ninternational  contractors  and  applying  conditions  of \nthe \nInternational  Federation  of  Consulting  Engineers  for  construction \nsupervision.  But  this  can  be  mitigated  by  the  use  of  consulting \nservices  for  construction  supervision,  and  capacity  building \nprograms  for  CGPWD  in  contract  management  and  quality \ncontrol.  Contracts  are  in  relatively  large  packages  to  attract \ninternational and large domestic contractors, and to ensure good \nperformance  and  high  quality  of  construction.  Lessons  learned \nfrom similar projects include that concerns will arise about quality \ncontrol and consultant performance during project implementation. \nThese  will  be  addresses  by  identifying  potential  problems  before \nimplementation starts so that the CGPWD is able to handle them \nshould they occur. Meanwhile, ADB will strengthen it prior review \nand  approval  of  scope  of  works,  technical  specifications,  and \ntender  documents.  The  GOC  has  agreed  with  ADB  to  have \nintensive  reviews  of  implementation  progress  and  issues,  and \nperformance of consultants and contractors.   \n \nIntensive  preparatory  work  and  studies  were  carried  out  on  the \nrisks  of  social  and  environmental \nthe  sample \nsubproject,  which  represents  the  main  technical  specifications, \ntype  of  improvement  works,  and  social  and  environmental \nfeatures  of  the  main  road  network  in  Chhattisgarh.  GOC  has \nprepared  and  approved  a \ninitial \nenvironmental  examination \nindigenous  people\u2019s \ndevelopment  program,  and  a  resettlement  policy  framework,  and \nan  indigenous  people\u2019s  development  framework.  ADB  reviewed \nand  found  those  safeguard  documents  acceptable.  Furthermore, \nspecific  requirements  are  reflected  in  the  subproject  selection \ncriteria to ensure full compliance with the ADB\u2019s safeguard policy \nrequirements and guidelines.  \n\nresettlement  plan,  an \n\n(IEE),  an \n\nimpacts \n\nin \n\nviii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \n\n \n1. \nto India for the Chhattisgarh State Roads Development Sector Project. \n \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n \n \nA. \n \n\nSector Performance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nIntroduction \n\n \n2. \nChhattisgarh  was  established  on  1  November  2000  through  bifurcation  from  Madhya \nPradesh state. It is one of India\u2019s poorest states1. About 38% of Chhattisgarh\u2019s population of 21 \nmillion  lives  below  the  national  poverty  line2.  About  44%  of  Chhattisgarh\u2019s  population  is  tribal \nand scheduled caste3. Chhattisgarh has an area of 135,237 square km, and is known as a tribal \nand forest state. Forests cover about 44% of Chhattisgarh\u2019s land area.  \n \nThe Chhattisgarh railway network4 does not give adequate coverage. The railway serves \n3. \ncross-country  traffic  more  than  it  serves  the  needs  of  Chhattisgarh.  Railway  services  are \navailable to only a few major districts. Civil aviation is limited. Thus, roads are the main mode of \ntransportation. National highways (NH6, NH16 and NH78) provide good east-west connections \nwith  neighboring  states,  and  NH43  and  NH200  provide  improved  north-south  connection \nbetween  Raipur,  Bilaspur  and  Jagdalpur.  But,  Chhattisgarh  lacks  a  network  of  high-standard \nroads  to  provide  the  required  mobility  between  areas  with  natural  resources  and  industrial \ncenters and economic development zones, and to provide better access to social amenities to \nlarge tribal and scheduled caste populations. \n \n\n2. \n\nRoad Administration and Responsibilities \n\nThe  Public  Works  Department  Government  of  Chhattisgarh  (PWDGOC)  is  responsible \n4. \nfor  road  sector  management  and  road  development.  Its  institutional  setup  and  division  of \nresponsibilities follow the standard Public Works Department (PWD) manual covering zones of \nclassified works for national highways, state highways, and major district roads, as well as other \npublic infrastructure facilities, mainly buildings. \n \n5. \nPWDGOC  oversees  the  planning,  design,  construction,  and  maintenance  of  all  state \nroads,  major  bridges,  and  government  and  public  service  buildings.  Jointly  with  local  district \ngovernments, PWDGOC is responsible for other district roads, some rural roads, small bridges \nand  other  public  buildings.  Under  the  authority  and  responsibility  delegated  by  the  Ministry  of \n                                                 \n1  The per-capital gross domestic product (GDP) in 2000, at 1994 constant prices, was Rs6,692 ($152)\u2014 about 2% \n\nhigher than the GDP in 1994, according to the Chhattisgarh Directorate of Economics and Statistics in 2001. \n\n2  A poverty impact assessment (PIA) study is being finalized. Preliminary findings and recommendations of the PIA \nwere  presented  to,  and  discussed  with,  ADB\u2019s  transport  and  poverty  groups  at  a  presentation  organized  by  the \nEconomics and Research Department and Regional and Sustainable Development Department. Comments will be \nincorporated into the final PIA report and will be reflected in the draft report and recommendation of the President \n(RRP) for the management review meeting. \n\n3  Census 2001. \n4 The 1,038-km railway connecting the eastern and western regions of India passes through Chhattisgarh via Raipur \n\nand Bilaspur. \n\n\f2\n\n \n\n  \n\nRoad  Transport  and  Highways  (MORTH),  PWDGOC  is  also  responsible  for  maintenance  of \nChhattisgarh\u2019s  national  highways.  Responsibility  for  construction  and  maintenance  of  rural \nroads rests with the Chhattisgarh Rural Engineering Services (CGRES). \n \n\n3. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n6. \nRoad Network. Chhattisgarh inherited the road network from Madhya Pradesh of about \n35,000  km  under  PWDGOC  jurisdiction,  and  15,000  km  of  rural  roads  and  tracks  under  the \njurisdiction  of  other  government  departments  or  local  governments.  The  core  road  network \ncomprises two north-south corridors and four east-west corridors. The remaining roads, except \nfor  the  six  main  corridors,  are  mostly  in  poor  or  very  poor  condition,  and  not  passable  in  the \nmonsoon  season.    This  is  especially  true  for  roads  in  southern  and  northern Chhattisgarh, \nwhere most of the tribal people live in forest areas. \n \n7. \nRoad Density. Chhattisgarh has 14,535 habitations that are not connected to the road \nnetwork;  1,168  of  the  habitations  have  populations  of  more  than  1,000  and  3,730,  of  500  to \n1,000 persons. Many districts, particularly those in the north and the south, have very poor road \ncoverage. The average density of blacktop and water-bound-macadam road is 16 km/100 km2. \nIndia\u2019s  average  is  42  km/100  km2.  This  may  be  partly  explained  by  extensive  forests  in \nChhattisgarh.  Nevertheless,  there  are  still  many  non-forested  areas  without  roads,  and  more \nthan  15,000  villages  have  no  connection  to  the  main  road  network5. Excluding tracks, there is \nabout 1 km of road for every 570 persons. \n \n8. \nRoad  Capacity  and  Traffic  Volumes.  Apart  from  NH6  and  NH43,  the  remaining \nnational  highways  and  most  state  roads  are  of  single  lane  (3.75m  carriageway  width).  Some \nstate  highways  (e.g.,  SH9)  have  been  widened  to  intermediate  lane  (5.5-m  width).  National \nhighways are programmed for widening to two and four lane over time. Traffic counts on several \nstate  highways  show  that  traffic  levels  are  generally  low  (<2000  PCUs  per  day),  and  hence \nwithin  the  Indian  Roads  Congress  (IRC)  capacity  definition  of  a  single  lane  road  (2,500 \nPCUs/day). But some state highways carry traffic volumes that exceed single-lane capacity and, \ntherefore, require immediate widening. \n \nRoad Conditions.  PWDGOC does not have a computerized database with information \n9. \non  the  condition  of  state  highways  and  district  roads.  The  only  quantitative  measurements  of \nroad condition are surveys carried out in recent feasibility studies of 1,300 km of state highways. \nThose surveys showed that these roads have poor riding quality with International Roughness \nIndex  (IRI) values in the range of 6 to greater than 12. PWDGOC has a program to build about \n500 bridges in the next 15 years. Many existing bridges are in poor or unsafe condition. \n \n10. \nRoad Safety. Road safety has become a serious concern in Chhattisgarh,even though \nits  death  rate  per  100,000  vehicles  is  about  60%  of  the  national  average.  About  1,240  deaths \nfrom road accidents were reported in the 12 months ending in March 2002.6 The highest death \nrate was from accidents involving trucks, tankers and other heavy vehicles. Chhattisgrh\u2019s death \nrates are comparable to those of other Indian jurisdictions but significantly higher than those  of \ndeveloped  countries,  especially  if  one  considers  vehicle  ownership  and  volume  of  road  traffic \n(Table 1). \n \n\n                                                 \n5   ADB is preparing a sector loan of $400 million to India to finance rural road development, including improvement of \n\n5,000 km of rural road each in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. Loan approval is expected in 2003. \n\n6   Statistics for 2003 are not yet available. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  \n\n3\n\nTable 1.

If two-wheelers are ignored, the death rate for motorized vehicles increases to \n560 deaths per 100,000 vehicles.  \n \n12. \nSector Regulations. The Transport Department Government of Chhattisgarh (TDGOC) \nis  responsible  for  the  licensing,  registration,  and  regulation  of  motor  vehicles,  drivers,  and \npassenger  and  freight  transport.  As  a  result  of  GOC\u2019s  effort  to  encourage  private  sector \nparticipation,  private  sector  operators  provide  all  passenger  and  freight  transport  services,  at \nmarket rates. TDGOC is also responsible for enforcing axle load regulations. Traffic police are \nresponsible for enforcing traffic and road safety regulations. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nSector Management \n\n13. \nRoad  management  in  Chhattisgarh  today  is  based  on  a  general  development  strategy \non performance. PWDGOC\u2019s current performance is mainly evaluated by the spending of GOC \nbudget allocations. That means that incentives are limited for both PWDGOC management and \nstaff  to  adopt  modern  managerial  systems  and  skills,  or  to  improve  quality  of  management  or \nefficiency of operations. The system has also resulted in a lack of transparency and competition \nnecessary to encourage domestic contractors to develop their capacities and competitiveness. \nMeanwhile,  the  deficiencies  in  investment  and  maintenance  of  state  roads  have  been \naggravated  by  a  lack  of  updated  capacity  and  capability  in  master  planning  and  project \nprogramming,  sector  management,  quality  control  in  construction  and  maintenance,  and \nmanagement of financial resources. \n \n14. \nProcedural  delays  in  administrative  processes  have  reduced  the  efficiency  of  use  of \nfunds. Most bookkeeping for financial accounting and management is done manually.  Records \nare  kept  in  a  loose  archive  system.  The  system  does  not  generate  analysis  of  information  for \nPWDGOC  management  to  use  for  resource  and  asset  management,  and  to  support  planning \nand  decision-making.  Road  planning  focuses  on  composing  budget  requirements  by  following \nitemized budget entries. There is no clearly specified process for identifying needs and planning \nresponses  based  on  the  application  of  economic  criteria  and  a  development  strategy.  The \nplanning process also suffers from a serious lack of reliable and updated data on the inventory \nand  condition  of  the  road  network  and  its  assets.  Appendix  1  gives  a  supplementary  sector \nanalysis. \n\n \n\n\f4\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n2. \n\nChallenges \n\n15. \nIn  2002,  GOC  formulated  a  road  policy  to  embark  on  a  medium-term program (2003\u2013\n2012) for road sector development. The road policy envisaged that good governance is key for \nsuccessful  development  of  all  social  and  economic  sectors,  and  that  improved  roads  and \ntransport services are crucial support for Chhattisgarh\u2019s socioeconomic development.  \n \nTo  improve  governance,  GOC  has  taken  a  holistic  approach  to  address  development \n16. \nneeds through efforts to (i) establish an integrated road development and management system \nby  creating  a  dedicated  road  authority,  (ii)  create  an  enabling  environment  to  provide \nadministrative  support  and  encourage  private  sector  participation  in  all  financially  viable  road \nprojects,  (iii)  establish  a  dedicated  state  road  fund  for  road  maintenance,  and  (iv)  build \ninstitutional capacity for management of the state roads. \n \n17. \nFunding of road maintenance in Chhattisgarh is not currently a major concern because \nof the better-off fiscal status of GOC.  Analysis of the FY2001\u20132002 and FY2002\u20132003 budget \nallocations  and  actual  expenditures  showed  that  Non-Planned  Budget  and  workloads \nimplemented  took  about  63%  of  the  total  budget,  which  demonstrated  a reasonable emphasis \non road maintenance, although the quality management needs substantial improvement.  \n \n18. \nFor long-term funding of road maintenance, the GOC has identified ways to establish a \nstate road fund through (i) earmarking revenue sources, (ii) creating legislation to establish the \nlegal  status  of  the  fund,  and  (iii)  defining  funding  criteria.  Fuel  taxes  are  the  main  source  of \ncollection  for  the  Central  Road  Fund,  so  collection  of  any  additional  fuel  taxes  has  become \npolitically  sensitive  to  both  the  Government  of  India  (GOI)  and  state  governments.7 Toll roads \nare  accepted  in  India,  but  Chhattisgarh  has  only  a  few  toll  roads  and  bridges  because  of  the \nmoderately low traffic on most roads. Tolling will mainly be an alternative for the future, because \ntoday\u2019s road users cannot afford to pay much, and traffic forecasts for the near- and medium- \nterms  indicate  that  more  time  is  needed  for  the  economy  to  develop  and  greater  traffic  to  be \ngenerated.  Thus,  state  budget  allocations  will  be  the  main  source  of  road  maintenance  in  the \nnear term of 5 to 8 years.  \n \n\n3. \n\nState Roads Development Program \n\n \n19. \nTo improve state roads, PWDGOC, in 2002\u20132003, prepared a 10-Year Master Plan for \nRoad  Sector  Development  (MPRSD)  for  the  years  2003  to  2012.  MPRSD  is  based  on  social \nand  economic  development  needs,  development  priorities  for  the  road  sector,  and  alternative \ninvestment  strategies  to  support  social  and  economic  development  priorities.  It  aims  to  (i) \npromote  development  of  six  main  road  corridors,  (ii)  remove  capacity  bottlenecks  from  the \nnetwork  to  better  connect  rural  areas,  and  (iii)  support  socio-economic  development  by \nimproving  road  access  and  connectivity  among  growth  centers.  For  road  maintenance,  a \ncomputer-based  pavement  management  system  such  as  Highway  Development  and \nMaintenance  Tool  4  (HDM-4)  will  be  adopted.    That  will  enable  PWDGOC  to  evaluate  the \neconomic effects of road maintenance alternatives and optimize road maintenance strategies. \n \n20. \nBased  on  MPRSD,  GOC  prepared  and  approved  a  priority  investment  program  to \nimprove about 5,000 km of state roads at an estimated cost of about Rs105 billion ($2.3 billion). \n\n                                                 \n7 More in-depth analysis of potential sources of collection is now being conducted by the GOC, and will be continually \n\nassisted by the Project.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  \n\n5\n\nThe MPRSD identified 3,760 km of priority state roads sections for ADB financing. Most of these \nroads  are  single-lane,  with  worn  crusts  and  pavements.  The  roads  need  to  be  reconstructed \nwithin  the  existing  alignments,  with  limited  expansion  of  capacity  and  changes  in  lane \nconfigurations. \n \n21. \nThe  total  budget  available  for  road  improvement  projects  for  the  next  10  years  is \nprojected  at  about  Rs61  billion  ($1.3  billion),  based  on  recent  analysis,  assuming  that  the \nbudget allocation to PWDGOC remains at the current level of 8%  of the total state expenditure, \nand  that  Chhattisgarh\u2019s  economic  performance  keeps  up  with  the  national  average.  This \nanalysis  does  not  include  construction  of  new  roads  or  projects  for  major  capacity  expansion \n(e.g.,  from  two  lanes  to  four  lanes),  which  will  probably  happen  in  the  next  10  years.  A  more \ndetailed needs assessment will be made in late 2003 and 2004 when the MPRSD is updated to \nreflect  achievements  of  GOC\u2019s  recent  investments  in  road  improvements.  GOC  has  also \nrecognized  that  needs  for  investment  in  roads  may  increase  substantially  to  support \nChhattisgarh\u2019s  long-term  social  and  economic  development.  Therefore,  ADB\u2019s  assistance  in \nfinancing the Project is important to support GOC in achieving its road development objectives.  \n \n\n4. \n\nRoad Sector Expenditures and Revenues \n\n \n22. \nThe  budgeted  expenditure  in  Chhattisgarh\u2019s  road  sector  for  FY2002\u20132003 was Rs4.22 \nbillion ($87 million), equal to 8% of the total state budgeted expenditure (Appendix 1). The road \nexpenditures  include  amounts  provided  by  MORTH  for  improvement  and  maintenance  of \nnational  highways.  The  Non-Planned  Budget8  includes  maintenance  of  roads,  PWDGOC\u2019s \nadministration (salary for regular and non-regular employees,9 and office operating costs), part \nof  the  funds  are  spent  on  state  building  and  guesthouse  maintenance,  and  operations  that \ncannot be separated from roads. Appendix 1 includes a summary of PWDGOC\u2019s planned and \nNon-Planned Budgets and actual expenditures, and the annual expenditure by the end of March \n2003. \n \n\n5. \n\nPublic-Private Partnership (PPP) and Build-Operate -Transfer (BOT) \n\n \n23. \nGOC  has  established  the  Chhattisgarh  Infrastructure  Development  Corporation  (CIDC) \nto interface with the private sector, to commission feasibility studies and to invite proposals for \nspecific private sector participation and public-private partnership road projects. About 690 km \nof high-priority roads have been identified for built-operate-transfer (BOT), with pre-qualification \ncompleted and financial proposals prepared for submission to CIDC. PWDGOC has also signed \nagreements with developers to improve and operate about 297 km of state highways. \n \n24. \nIt has been noted that there will be difficulties and uncertainties for BOT projects on state \nroads  due  to  low  traffic  volumes.  Except  for  limited  number  of  road  sections  with  high  traffic \nvolumes, the majority of road network will unlikely be attractive to private sector, or will require a \nhigh  government  subsidy10  to  make  them  attractive  to  the  private  sector.  This  has  become  a \nmajor challenge for GOC in the near- and medium- terms, until its economy develops and traffic \nincreases on most state roads. \n\n                                                 \n8  The non-planned budget is for recurrent expenditures. \n9 \u201cNonregular employees\u201d includes timekeepers, work charge employees, and gang laborers. \n10 The GOC has set a ceiling of its subsidy for the private sector  operators of no more than 30% of the total project \n\ncosts. \n\n \n\n\f6\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n6. \n\nADB Sector Strategy \n\n \n25. \nRoads  in  India  consists  of  (i)  key  national  highway  links  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the \nNational Highway Authority of India, (ii) other national highway links under the Ministry of Road \nTransport and Roads, (iii) state and district roads under state PWDs, and (iv) rural roads. Given \nthe potential scale of lending, ADB has developed a programmatic approach to the development \nof  projects  in  a  sequential  and  progressive  manner  to  fulfill  long-term  policy  objectives  of \nfostering  an  enabling  environment  for  efficient  and  sustainable development of roads to meet \npublic  needs  for  increased  mobility  and  efficient  freight  movement.  Another  major  feature  of \nroad sector lending is to firmly link a sector reform with a succession of investment to improve \nthe  total  connectivity  of  road  networks.  This  overall  lending  strategy  is  implemented through \ncoordinated lending to roads at the levels specified above. \n \n26. \nA state  road  sector  reform  plan  has  been  prepared  and  agreed  upon  with  the  GOI  to \nguide ADB\u2019s lending operation in the sector for the next 10 years to achieve the following policy \nobjectives: \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nseparation of the government\u2019s policy and regulatory functions in the state road \nsector  from  project  implementation,  and  operation  and  management  of  project \nfacilities,  by  establishing  an  interim  road  development  agency  within  PWDs  to \nintegrate  all  responsibilities  and  functions  of  sector  management  and  project \nimplementation; \ninstitutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building  to  improve  business  processes \nand  accountability,  and  to  enhance  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  sector \nmanagement; \nfull transition of sector management from the outdated PWD system, through the \ninterim  road  development  agency,  to  the  proposed  Dedicated  Road  Authority \n(DRA) with improved governance and accountability; \nInitiation of an enabling environment through outsourcing and other modalities to \nbring  about  better  private  sector  participation  in  road  development  and \nmaintenance; and \nestablishment  of  a  mechanism  for  road  asset  management  and  sustainable \nfunding for road maintenance. \n\n \n27. \nThe sector reform plan will be implemented programmatically, starting with separation of \nthe  Government\u2019s  policy  and  regulatory  functions  from  project  implementation  and  operation \nand  management  of  project  facilities,  and  by  integrating  all  road  functions  and  responsibilities \ninto  a  self-contained  road  development  agency  in  the  current  PWD.  That  agency  will  later  be \ntransformed into a dedicated road authority to take over development and management of the \nentire sector. Along with the progress of institutional reform, it will introduce and institutionalize \nimproved  business  processes  and  procedures,  install  modern  sector  management  and \noperational capability and tools, and training and skills upgrade to make DRA fully functional for \nfurther improvement until further review and improvement of the sector reform plan and strategy \nat the end of the 10-year period. \n \n28. \nADB  operations  in  India  and  coordination  with  other  major  donors  are  discussed  in \nAppendix  2  and  Supplementary  Appendix  A.  The  proposed  project  is  the  second  state-level \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  \n\n7\n\n7. \n\nLessons Learned \n\nADB  intervention  in  the  state  road  sector  following  the  Madhya  Pradesh  State  Road  Sector \nDevelopment Program approved in 200211. \n \n \n \n29. \nOperational  and  institutional  shortcomings  have  delayed  past  ADB-financed  road \nprojects  in  India,  both  for  national  highways  and  state  roads.  A  lesson  learned  is  that  ADB\u2019s \nclose  supervision  and  consulting  services  in  project  preparation  and  implementation  are \ncritically  important  to  the  transfer  of  modern  technology  and  skills  to  PWD  staff,  and  to  the \nbuilding  of  capacity  for  project  implementing  agencies.  Meanwhile,  continued  policy  dialogue \nwith  the  state  government  and  PWD  management  is  equally  important  to  ensure  institutional \nsupport  and  allocation  of  adequate  resources  for  implementation  of  projects.  The  lessons \nlearned and experiences gained were taken into consideration in the Project\u2019s formulation and \ndesign, and in its implementation. \n \n\n8. \n\nRationale \n\n30. \nPWDGOC, with its institutional and technical capability and capacity, is reaching a limit \nto perform more effective sector management and more efficient management of investments in \nstate roads. This, and a 10-year neglect of investment in road improvements and maintenance, \nhas caused serious deterioration of most state roads.  Riding quality is mostly from poor to very \npoor. This has undermined the long-term growth potential of the state\u2019s economy and resulted in \nincreasing transport capacity bottlenecks and poorer transport services for the economy, rural \npoor and tribal populations. \n \n31. \nImprovement  of  road  sector  management  is crucial to support GOC\u2019s policy initiatives. \nBetter  governance  and  accountability  will  improve  the  institutional  and  policy  framework,  and \nprovide  the  capacity  to  ensure  that  investments  in  sector  development  are  implemented \nsuccessfully,  and  that  impacts  of  road  development  can  be  sustained.  The  road  sector \ninvestment  is  expected  to  help  GOC  improve  connectivity  of  Chhattisgarh\u2019s  road  network \nsignificantly,  thus  directly  supporting  the  state\u2019s  economic  growth.  Meanwhile,  road  sector \ninvestment will also provide a vehicle for Chhattisgarh to establish a transparent and conducive \nenvironment  for  more  competition  and  increased  private  sector  participation.  That  in  turn  will \nensure better infrastructure facilities and decreased recurrent costs for road maintenance over \nthe medium and long term to allow higher capital and expenditure for priority social sectors and \npoverty reduction. \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nObjectives \n\n \n \nA. \n \n32. \nThe main objective of the Project is to support economic growth and reduce poverty by \nimproving  connectivity  and  access  to  development  opportunities  and  social  services,  including \nhealth and education. The Project will also support GOC\u2019s initiative to improve the effectiveness \nand  efficiency  of  state  road  sector  management,  and  provide  the  sector  with  the  capacity  to \nensure  efficiency  of  road  investments  and  sustainable  road  development  impacts  to  support \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB, 2002.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f8\n\n \n\n  \n\nChhattisgrah\u2019s  social  and  economic  development.  The  objective  will  be  achieved  through  (i) \ninstituting measures for good governance in the administration and management of the sector, \n(ii)  improving  sector  capability  and  building  capacity  for  more  efficient  resource  and  asset \nmanagement,  (iii)  initiating  steps  to  increase  private  sector  participation  in  road  development \nand maintenance, (iv) improving road safety, (v) enhancing social awareness for prevention of \nHIV/AIDS,12  and  (vi)  improving  priority  state  roads  to  provide  better  connectivity  between \neconomic  growth  centers  and  rural  areas,  and  to  complement  ADB\u2019s  Rural  Roads  Sector \nIProject. Appendix 3 gives the project framework. \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nInstitutional Reform and Capacity Building \n\n33. \nThe Project will finance improvement of about 1,700 km of state roads in Chhattisgarh. \nConsulting services will be provided to assist PWDGOC in preparing and implementing the road \nimprovement  subprojects,  construction  supervision,  capacity  building  and  training  in  project \nmanagement and quality control. Consultants will also assist GOC in detailing and implementing \nthe institutional reforms, and building the required policy and institutional capacity for state road \nmanagement.  Consulting  services  will  support  the  adoption  and  implementation  of  the \ncommunity  road  safety  program,  development  of  road  safety  plans  and  a  road  accident \ndatabase, and the conduct of road safety audit for all subprojects. \n \n \n \n34. \nProject implementation will follow the sector reform plan (para. 25-27) to achieve policy \nobjectives  (i),  (ii)  and  (iii);  to  improve  governance  and  accountability  of  road  sector \nmanagement, to identify alternative asset management systems; and to build capacity, through \ntraining,  in  modern  sector  management  and  operations.  Policy  objectives  (iv)  and  (v)  will  be \nfulfilled  through  a  follow-up  operation  to  be  financed  either  by  the  GOC  or  through  external \nassistance,  for  full  implementation  of  private  sector  participation  in  road  development  and \nmaintenance projects, and through the establishment of a sustainable road asset management \nsystem,  including  a  funding  mechanism  for  road  maintenance.  The  institutional  reform  was \ndesigned by the project participatory technical assistance (PPTA),13 and accepted by GOC and \nADB.  The  design  involved  significant  policy  dialogue  with  GOC  and  participation  of  the  state \ndepartments and staff concerned through daily interaction, seminars, and workshops, as well as \ndissemination of information and project preparation experiences of a similar PWD institutional \nreform through a 2002 ADB loan for Madhya Pradesh. These important policy activities helped \nthe GOC and its staff better understand the envisaged development goals and objectives for the \nsector, and benefits of the institutional reform. Intensive policy dialogue and consultation among \nADB,  GOC,  and  the  consultants  served  as  fora  for  discussions  of  every  detail  of  policy \nobjectives  and  measures,  implementation  arrangements,  and  risks  and  benefits  of  the \ninstitutional reform. The reform will improve the current institutional and policy framework, and \nprovide  the  capacity  to  ensure  successful  implementation  of  the  investment  under  the  sector \napproach, and that project-generated impacts of road development are sustained through better \ngovernance  and  accountability.  The  Time-bound  Policy  Action  Plan14  in  Appendix  4  reflects \nGOC\u2019s  commitment  and  milestone  policy  measures  to  be  implemented  under  the  Project. \nin  planning  and  resource \nImprovement \nmanagement  for  sector  development  will  be  key  interventions  to  ensure  more  accountable \nbudget allocation and use, and more sustainable development and maintenance of state roads. \n                                                 \n12 Human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \n13 ADB.2002.

Based on \nthis,  reform  consultants  financed  under  the  Project,  jointly  with  GOC,  will  prepare  a  detailed \nwork  program  and  specific  implementation  arrangements  for  reform  in  three  main  clusters:  (i) \nestablishing an interim agency for state road management\u2014 the Agency for Road Development \n(ARD) and transform it to the DRA; (ii) instituting new business processes and procedures and \ninstalling modern capability and tools for sector management and operation; and (iii) institutional \nstrengthening  through  recruitment  of  new  engineers,  training,  and  acquisition  of  equipment \nessential for road management. \n \nBy the end of 2006, ARD will be transformed to DRA, which will be tested through daily \n36. \noperations from 2007 onward. Areas that need further improvement will be identified through the \npilot  operation  of  the  new  sector  management  system,  improved  business  procedures,  and \nmanagement  tools  and  systems  installed  for  DRA.    Needs  for  assistance  to  further  improve \nmanagement and operation of the sector will also be identified, to ensure achievement of policy \nobjectives under the sector reform plan until it is reviewed and further improved. Implementation \nprogress  of  the  reform  will  be  monitored  using  the  key  milestone  events  and  deliverables \ndescribed in the Time-Bound Policy Action Plan. \n \n \n \nThe Project will finance improvements15 of about 1,700 km of state roads, which are part \n37. \nof  the  MPRSD,  of  parts  of  the  two  north-south  and  four  east-west  corridors,  or  connectivity \nroads  linking  with  development  centers  and  improved  rural  roads  under  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s \nRural Road Development Program - Pradham Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY).  \n \nADB\u2019s  sector  lending  procedures  were  followed.  A  detailed  feasibility  study  and \n38. \nengineering design of a sample subproject were conducted. ADB reviewed and evaluated them \nto ensure they complied with ADB\u2019s policies, guidelines, and procedures for project preparation, \nincluding the technical, operational, economic, environmental, social and resettlement aspects. \nThe  sample  subproject  consists  of  road  sections  between  Konta  and  Jagdapur  in  southern \nChhattisgarh connecting with Andhra Pradesh. The subproject represents the common features \nof project improvement works, including pavement reconstruction for the entire length,  and the \nwidening  of  roads  from  single  lane  to  intermediate  lanes,  and  from  intermediate  lanes  to  two \nlanes.  The  subproject  roads  pass  through  a  reserve  forest,  and  by  a  tribal  community. \nSupplementary  Appendix  C  describes  the  Indigenous  People\u2019s  Development  Program  for  the \nsample  subproject;  Supplementary  Appendix  D  describes \nthe  resettlement  plan;  and \nSupplementary  Appendix  E  describes  environmental  assessment.  The  sample  subproject \npreparation will be a model for GOC in the preparation of remaining subprojects during project \nimplementation. \n \n39. \nThe  remaining  subprojects  will  be  selected,  prepared,  and  approved  during  project \nimplementation in accordance with selection criteria and approval procedures agreed by GOC \nand  ADB  (Appendix  5  and  Supplementary  Appendix  F).  All  subprojects  must  meet  evaluation \nrequirements,  including  that:  (i)  technical  specifications  and  design  criteria  are  met  in \n\n                                                 \n15 Road improvement works under the Project include mainly reconstruction of pavement, repair and strengthening of \nmajor  bridges  and  culverts,  improvement  of  cross  drainage  systems,  and  reconfiguration  of  pavement  (if  traffic \nvolumes and existing right-of-ways justify it). \n\n \n\n\f10\n\n \n\n  \n\naccordance  with  the  IRC  standard  for  state  highways  and  major  district  roads,  as  well  as  IRC \ndesign codes, (ii) a road safety audit is conducted on all subprojects to identify areas of major \nconcern, and review recommendations to be incorporated into the detailed engineering designs; \n(iii)  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies  on  environmental and social impacts of project, \nincluding  policies  on  involuntary  resettlement,  indigenous  people,  gender,  and  HIV/AIDS,  and \n(iv) an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) greater than 12%. ADB will review and approve \nthe  selection  of  all  subprojects  until  ADB  has  full  confidence  in  PWDGOC\u2019s  capacity  to \nindependently  select  and  evaluate  subprojects.    ADB  may  in  the  future,  decide  to  revise  the \nsubproject  review  and  approval  process  for  delegation  of  the  approval  of  subprojects  to \nPWDGOC. \n \n40. \nThe  Project  will  implement  a  road  safety  program,  including  a  community  road  safety \nprogram  developed  under  the  Rural  Roads  Sector  I  Project  through  close  coordination  and \ncooperation with CGRES. Road safety measures will include (i) to conduct road safety audits for \nall subprojects to identify problem areas and recommend improvements of engineering designs; \n(ii) to develop road safety plans that involve education, enforcement, driver training, standards \nof vehicle mechanical fitness,  seatbelt and safety helmet requirements, and other measures to \nreduce damage from road accidents, and (iii) to develop a road accident database and conduct \nroad safety audit on all major roads. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n41. \nChhattisgarh needs road improvements immediately. As the government of a new state, \nGOC  has  taken  advantage  of  a  dynamic  momentum  of  development,  and  a  better-off fiscal \nposition  since  its  founding,  to  initiate  an  ambitious  program  to  improve  the  riding  quality  of \narterial road corridors and priority roads. This has resulted in changes in road inventories and \nroad  conditions.  Therefore,  the  MPRSD,  which  GOC  approved  earlier  needs  to  be  updated  to \nprovide  an  up-to-date  base  map  to  select  the  remaining  subprojects  (selection of the sample \nsubproject  and  first  group  of  subprojects  was  based  on  GOC\u2019s  priority  investment  program \nunder  the  MPRSD).  The  sector  lending  modality  provides  the  Project  the  flexibility  to  support \nthis dynamic process of project preparation, and improve its readiness and implementation. \n \nConstruction quality and lack of maintenance after improvement are often concerns on \n42. \nthe sustainability of development impacts of road projects in India. To address this, the Project \nwill include, on a pilot basis, provisions in civil works contracts to require contractors to continue \nmaintaining the same scope of works for a variable period of time from 6 to 8 years to include \nthe first periodic maintenance. \n \n43. \nThe  reform  will  enable  GOC  to  more  effectively  manage  state  roads  and  ensure  more \nreliable road transport to support Chhattisgarh\u2019s social and economic development through two \nmain  channels.  The  first  channel  includes  improving  governance  in  public administration and \naccountability in public resource and asset management for state roads. Improving the sector \ncapability  and  capacity  will  create  a  transparent  and  conducive  environment  for  increased \nefficiency  and  competition.  This,  in  turn,  will  promote  higher-quality  construction  and  road \nmaintenance  and  more  sustainable  road  infrastructure,  and  decrease  recurrent  costs  of  road \nmaintenance over the medium and long terms. The second channel includes identifying sources \nof  road  sector  revenue  to  support the establishment of a sustainable funding mechanism for \nroad  maintenance.  The  institutional  improvement  will  provide  better  transparency  and  higher \nlevels  of  competition  to  encourage  private  sector  participation  in  road  projects.  That  will  offset \nGOC\u2019s financial burden, and enable more funding of priority social sectors such as health and \neducation to support poverty reduction. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  \n\n11\n\n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates  \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n44. \nThe total cost of the Project, in 2003 prices, is estimated at $285.7 million equivalent, of \nwhich the foreign exchange cost is estimated at $199.52 million, or 70% of the total cost of the \nProject.  The  local  currency  cost  is  estimated  at  $86.18  million  equivalent,  or  30%  of  the  total \ncost of the Project. The cost estimate includes local taxes and duties, contingencies, a front-end \nfee  of  0.5  %  of  the  total  loan  amount,  interest  during  construction  (IDC),  and  a  commitment \ncharge. Appendix 6 summarizes the project cost estimates. \n \nE. \n \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  $180,000,000,  from  its  ordinary  capital \n45. \nresources. That will cover 63% of the total Project cost. The loan will finance the entire foreign \nexchange cost of the Project, excluding the front-end fee, commitment fee and IDC16, as well as \npart  of  the  local  currency  costs  of  domestic  consulting  services  for  subproject  selection  and \npreparation, and assistance to GOC in implementing the institutional reforms. GOC will provide \nthe remaining local currency cost of $85.7 million equivalent. Appendix 6 includes a summary of \na  proposed  financing  plan.  GOC  has  assured  that  it  will  secure  the  counterpart  financing  as \ncommitted. India will be the Borrower. \n \n46. \nThe  loan  will  have  (i)  a  25-year  term,  including  a  5-year grace period; an interest rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.75%  per  annum;  a  front-end  fee  of  0.5%;  conversion  options  that  may  be  exercised  in \naccordance with the terms of the Loan Agreement, the loan regulations, and ADB\u2019s conversion \nguidelines; and other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. \nThe Government of India has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an \nundertaking  that  these  choices  were  independent  decisions  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements  \n\n1. \n\nProject Management  \n\nfield  offices  at  key \n\nlocations,  will  be  responsible \n\n47. \nPWDGOC will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the Project. Within PWDGOC, ARD will \nbe  responsible  for  overall  project  execution  and  supervision.  A  project  implementation  unit \n(PIU),  with \nfor  day-to-day  project \nimplementation  and  management.  The  Road  Management  Committee  (RMC),  to  be  formed  in \nMarch 2004, will oversee and provide policy support and coordination for timely implementation \nof institutional reform and capacity building, and help monitor project implementation.  \n \n48. \nPWDGOC  established  the  PIU,  with  four  full-time staff, in September 2003 as the first \nstep  in  creating  ARD.  PWDGOC  will  transfer  more  full-time  staff  to  PIU  in  January  2004  for \nin  accounting,  planning,  engineering,  procurement, \nproject  management \nenvironmental  planning  and  management,  social  analysis  and  management,  resettlement \nplanning and implementation, road maintenance, and road safety. These staff will form the core \nof ARD, and will be transferred to the ARD functional units as they are established. \n \n\nfunctions \n\n                                                 \n16 The Borrower will pay separately the front-end fee, commitment charge and interest during construction. \n\n \n\n\f12\n\n \n\n  \n\nThe RMC will, be chaired by the chief secretary, or his designate, with representatives \n49. \nfrom  FDGOC,  PWDGOC,  CIDC,  the  Chhattisgarh  Home  (Police)  Department,  CGRES,  the \nChhattisgarh Planning Department, and selected external road stakeholders. RMC will meet at \nthe state level monthly to monitor project performance and, use of funds from both the ADB loan \nand  counterpart  funds,  and  to  ensure  coordination  among  the  key  agencies.  When  needed, \nother  agencies  such  as  Department  of  Forestry  and  Environment,  agencies  for  resettlement, \nand consultants may be invited to RMC meetings. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Arrangements and Schedule  \n\n50. \nAppendix  7  summarizes  the  implementation  schedule.  Besides  the  sample  subproject, \nanother  670  km  of  priority  roads  have  been  identified  as  candidate  subprojects  for  further \nevaluation  in  accordance  with  the  subproject  selection  criteria.  The  remaining  970  km  of \nsubproject roads will be identified from the updated MPRSD, using the selection procedures and \ncriteria  agreed  upon  by  ADB  and  GOC.  To  ensure  satisfactory  project  readiness  for \nimplementation and timely preparation of the remaining subprojects, PWDGOC has assured its \nfull  support  to  updating  of  MPRSD  and  providing  all  required  inputs  and  analyses  to  the \nimplementation consultants.   \n \n51. \nPWDGOC  will  prepare  bidding  documents  and  draft  contracts  for  ADB\u2019s  review  and \napproval  for  civil  works  and  consulting  services  for  institutional  reform  and  construction \nsupervision.  Pre-construction  activities,  including  the  tendering  of  civil  works  contracts  for  the \nsample  subproject,  began  in  the  third  quarter  of  2003,  and  will  be  completed  by  the  second \nquarter  of  2004.  Project  implementation  is  expected  to  take  5  years,  from  January  2004  to \nJanuary 2009. The loan account will be financially closed in July 2009, 6 months after physical \ncompletion of the Project. \n \n52. \nConsidering that Chhattisgarh is a forest state and sensitive to environmental impacts of \nconstruction  works,  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policy  requirements  must  be  complied  with  strictly.  To \nensure  that  compliance,  ADB  will  review  and  approve  the  selection  of  subprojects,  especially \nassessments  of  social  and  environmental  impact,  mitigation  measures,  and  implementation \nplans. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement  \n\n53. \nADB has approved advance procurement of civil works for the sample subproject. GOC \nhas been advised that ADB\u2019s approval of advance procurement actions does not commit ADB to \napprove  the  loan.  All  procurement  to  be  financed  under  the  loan  will  be  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  The  road  improvement  works  will  be  packaged  into  a \nnumber  of  contracts  according  to  the  nature  of  works,  technical  requirements,  geographical \nlocation,  and  size  of  contracts.  Appendix  8  has  indicative  contract  packages,  which  will  be \nfinalized  for  ADB\u2019s  prior  approval,  and  will  be  used  during  project  implementation.  Civil  works \ncontracts  will  be  procured  using  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  for  contracts  of  $1.0 \nmillion  equivalent  or  more.  Civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  less  than \n$1,000,000 will be procured through local competitive bidding (LCB). Civil works for the sample \nsubproject  will  be  tendered  through  ICB  in  one  contract package. Packaging of the remaining \nworks will be finalized during project implementation, with ADB\u2019s concurrence before bidding. To \nexpedite  procurement,  and  considering  that  the  nature  of  most  civil  works  of  most  of  the \nsubprojects  may  be  similar,  pre-qualification  (PQ)  of  contractors  will  be  based  on  different \nthresholds  of  contract  size\u2014$10  million,  $20  million,  and  $30  million\u2014  so  PQ  can  start \nimmediately. The PQ will remain valid for 18 months after the conclusion of PQ evaluation. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  \n\n13\n\n \n54. \nProcurement  of  equipment  to  strengthen  PWDGOC\u2019s  road  management  capacity \nincludes that for (i) traffic counting and road condition survey; (ii) laboratory and material testing \nequipment;  (iii)  pavement  management;  and  (iv)  equipment  for  operation  of  the  proposed \nARD/DRA,  including  the  financial  accounting  system,  management  information  system, and \nenvironmental  monitoring.  Equipment  financed  under  the  Project  will  be  procured  using  ICB \nprocedures  if  the  estimated  contract  amount  is  equal  to  or  above  $500,000,  and  international \nshopping  if  the  estimated  contract  amount  is  less  than  $500,000.  Contract  packaging  for \nequipment  will  be  based  on  required  technical  features  and  timing  of  procurement.  Detailed \nspecifications will be finalized during project implementation. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n55. \nUnder  the  Project,  consulting  services  will  be  required  to  help  PWDGOC  implement \ninstitutional reforms and supervise construction. Separate teams of international consultants will \nbe contracted in association with domestic consultants. Supplementary Appendix G has terms \nof reference for the institutional reform and Supplementary Appendix H has terms of reference \nfor construction supervision. \n \n56. \nInstitutional reform will required about 60 person-months of international and 20 person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consultants.  The  consultants  will  provide  expertise  in  governance  and \nsector  policy,  transport  economics,  road  engineering,  road  safety,  financial  analysis,  project \nfinancing,  financial  accounting  and  management,  and  social  and  environmental  management. \nThe consultants will provide training in these areas to help GOC build capacity for better sector \nmanagement.  The  consultants  will  also  provide  training  through  seminars  and  workshops  on \ndissemination  of  findings  and  recommendations  on  the  institutional reform and its impacts on \nstate roads management. \n \nAbout  198  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  will  be  required  for  (i) \n57. \nsubproject  selection  and  preparation  (30  person-months);  (ii)  construction  supervision  and \nproject implementation (160 person-months); (iii) monitoring and evaluation, using criteria of the \nproject performance management system (PPMS) (3 person-months); and (iv) an environmental \nspecialist  (5  person-months)  for  environmental  management  and  monitoring.  Under  each \nservice,  the  consultants  will  provide  on-the-job  training  to  counterpart  staff  and  domestic \nconsultants.  Domestic  consulting  services  will  be  provided  for  construction  supervision  (1,080 \nperson-months),  and  contract  management  and  technical  advisory  assistance  (20  person-\nmonths). Fifteen person-months of domestic consulting will be required to help the international \nconsultants monitor projects on social and poverty reduction. \n \n58. \nTraining  will  be  organized  for  staff  of  the  ARD  in  construction  supervision  for  bridge \nmaintenance,  pavement  management,  quality  control,  maintenance  planning,  and  social  and \nenvironmental  monitoring  and  management.  The  supervision  consultants  will  design  training \nprograms  and  select  suitable  training  institutions  for  those  subjects.  GOC  will  submit  a  list  of \nproposed  candidates,  together  with  the  training  programs,  to  ADB  for  prior  review  and \nconcurrence. \n \n59. \nInternational consultants financed under the Project will be recruited through quality and \ncost-based  selection,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants. \nPWDGOC  has  agreed  to  incorporate  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  anti-corruption  policy  in  all \ninvitation  documents  and  contracts  for  consultants.  Domestic  consultants  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance with procedures satisfactory to the ADB. \n\n \n\n\f14\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n60. \nLoan  disbursements  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursment  Handbook, \nJanuary  2001,  and  Interim  Guidelines  for  Disbursement  Operations,  LIBOR-Based  Loan \nProduct,  July  2002.  Loan  funds  for  civil  works,  procurement  of  equipment,  and  consulting \ncontracts will be disbursed using direct payment and reimbursement procedures, in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n61. \nPWDGOC will make arrangements that are satisfactory to ADB for reporting progress of \nproject  implementation.  PWDGOC  will  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project \nimplementation  in  such  form  and  detail  as  ADB  may  reasonably  require.  The  results  of \nmonitoring of the social and environmental impacts of the Project should be incorporated in the \nquarterly  reports.  PWDGOC  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB,  within  3  months  of  project \nthe  design; \nthe  project  completion  report  with  detailed  assessment  of \ncompletion, \nimplementation;  costs;  performance  of  PWDGOC  and  ADB  consultants,  and  contractors; \nattainment of benefits; economic reevaluation; socioeconomic and environmental impacts; and \nother information that ADB requests. \n \n62. \nPWDGOC will maintain for the Project separate records on goods and services financed \nfrom the loan, financial resources received, expenditures, and use of local funds. The accounts \nwill be set up in accordance with sound accounting principles. Independent auditors, acceptable \nto  ADB,  will  audit  the  accounts.  PWDGOC  will  submit  the  audited  project  accounts  to  ADB \nwithin  9  months  from  the  end  of  the  previous  fiscal  year.  GOC  and  PWDGOC  have  been \nadvised  of  ADB\u2019s  requirements  for  improving  compliance  with  timely  submission  of  audited \nproject accounts, and the possibility of suspending disbursements if submission is delayed. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation (PPMS) \n\nfor  construction  supervision  will  provide  expertise \n\n63. \nSupplementary  Appendix  I  gives  a  set  of  indicators  and  target  values  for  monitoring \nproject  performance  and  estimating  attainment  of  the  envisaged  project  goals,  purposes, \noutputs,  and  conditions.  PWDGOC  will  input  baseline  indicators  when  the  Project  begins. \nConsultants \nthe  PPMS  design, \nimplementation, maintenance, monitoring, and performance evaluation. Assistance and training \nwill be provided in establishment of the PPMS database, data identification and collection, data \nscreening  and  entry,  data  processing  and  analysis,  PPMS  system  management  and \nmaintenance,  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  reporting.  Subsequently, \nindicator  values  will  be  observed  during  project  implementation,  at  project  completion,  1  year \nafter project completion, and 5 years after project completion. \n \n\nin \n\n8. \n\nProject Review  \n\nGOC and ADB will carry out a midterm review by the end of 2006, in addition to ADB\u2019s \n64. \nregular  and  special  reviews  of  project  implementation.  At  the  midterm  review,  GOC  and  ADB \nwill  review  in  detail  the  project  design  and  implementation  progress  to  identify  areas  for \nstrengthening,  and  improvements  to  ensure  smooth  implementation  and  achievement  of  the \nproject objectives. The review will focus on specific measures agreed with PWDGOC on making \npolicy  changes  and  institutional  improvements,  assessing  funding  requirements  and  budget \nallocations  for  road  maintenance,  updating  the  MPRSD,  and  improving  quality  management. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  \n\n15\n\nThe  measures  include  ADB\u2019s  monitoring  and  supervision  of  institutional  improvement;  prior \nreview  and  approval  of  subproject  selection;  implementation  of  action  plans  for  mitigation of \nadverse project impacts on environmental and social aspects, and of involuntary resettlement; \nbidding documents; bid evaluations; and contract execution. The project review will also include \nreview  of  project  progress  reports,  to  be  prepared  by  PWDGOC  and  implementation \nconsultants, and review of the performance of supervision consultants and contractors. \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \n \n65. \nbenefits and impacts will outweigh the costs, and the Project will bring net benefits. \n \nA. \n\nPolicy and Institutional Improvements \n\nThe  project  benefits  and  impacts,  and  potential  risks,  were  assessed.  The  integrated \n\nImproving  management  of  the  state  road  sector  will  enable  GOC  to  more  efficiently \n66. \nmanage state roads and ensure more reliable road transport services to support Chhattisgarh\u2019s \nsocial  and  economic  development.    Development  will  be  through  improving  governance  in \npublic  administration  and  accountability  in  sector  resource  and  road  asset  management, and \nimproving sector capability and capacity to create a transparent environment that is conducive \nto increased efficiency and competition. This, in turn, will ensure higher quality of construction \nand  maintenance  and  more  sustainable  road  infrastructure.  Road  improvement  will  also \ndecrease  recurrent  costs  of  road  maintenance  over  the  medium  and  long  terms,  and  enable \nmore  funding  of  priority  social  sectors  such  as  health  and  education  to  support  poverty \nreduction.  \n \n67. \nInstitutional reform will result in more reliable institutional and policy frameworks. Reform \nwill also provide the capacity to ensure that the investments under the sector approach will be \nimplemented  successfully,  and  that  project-generated  development  can  be  sustained  through \nimproved  governance  and  accountability.  Support  proposed  for  asset  management  and \nimprovement  of  sector  management  will  ensure  that  roads  improved  under  the  Project  are \nadequately maintained. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\nThe  EIRR  was  calculated  by  comparing  the  with-Project  and  without-Project situations \n68. \nfor the sample subproject. Without the Project, traffic volume would exceed the capacity of the \nroads,  which  would  then  become  congested,  leading  to  increase  in  travel  time  and  vehicle \noperating costs (VOCs). With the Project, higher speeds will reduce travel time and faster and \nsmoother rides) on the improved project roads will reduce VOCs. \n \n69. \nEconomic  analysis  was  carried  out  using  HDM-4.  The  model  evaluates  the  project \ninvestment, considering capital and recurrent costs as well as benefits derived from savings in \nroad user costs for the \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d project cases. In the economic analysis the project \nlife was assumed to be 20 years. The economic costs of the Project include the resource costs \nfor  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance;  and  the  social  costs  of  compensation  for  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement.  The  economic  benefits  were  quantified  in  terms  of  VOC savings \nfor existing traffic. \n  \n\n \n\n\f16\n\n \n\n  \n\nThe  economic  analysis  subdivided  the  project  road  into  three  homogeneous  sections, \n70. \nwhich  were  defined  based  on  traffic  volumes  derived  from  the  traffic  analysis,  roughness \nobserved during the surveys, and altitude and gradient of the roads. The analysis investigated \ntwo  project  road  improvement  options.  Option  1  was  to  improve  the  existing  road  to  an \nintermediate lane standard of 5.5 m. Option 2 was to improve to the project road to a two-lane \nstandard of 7.0 m. The estimated EIRR for the Option 1 road is 18.3%; and for Option 2, 17.5%. \nthat  indicates  that  the  Project  is  economically  viable  under  either  option.  The  Project \nrecommends Option 2 for improvement of the sample subproject. Appendix 8 summarizes the \neconomic analysis. Supplementary Appendix J gives further details. \n \n71. \nSensitivity of the Project road for each option was analyzed with respect to changes in \nthe benefit and cost streams. Seven sensitivity test cases were examined: (i)a 20% increase in \nconstruction  costs,  (ii)  a  20%  reduction  in  benefits,(iii)  a  50%  decrease  in  traffic  growth  rates,   \n(iv) no generated traffic benefits, (v) a 2-year project implementation delay, (vi) less than optimal \nroad  maintenance,  and  (vii)  a  combination  of  a  20%  increase  in  capital  costs  and  a  20% \nreduction of benefits. Results show that the quantified economic benefits are quite robust to the \nvarious sensitivity tests, and the Project remains economically viable. The  only test in which the \nEIRR  falls  below  12%  is  for  Option  2,  if  the  traffic  growth  rates  decreased  by  50%.  Switching \nvalues were determined for capital costs and economic benefits. The capital cost would have to \nincrease by 75% in Option 1, and by 66% in Option 2, to reduce the EIRR to 12%. The benefit \nlevel would have to decrease by 42% in Option 1, and by 38% in Option 2, to achieve the same \neffect  on  the  EIRR.  A  risk  analysis  using  the  @Risk  computer  program  was  undertaken  to \ndetermine the risk of the EIRR falling below 12% for the two options. The probability of the EIRR \nof Option 1 falling below 12% is 4.8%; but the probability of the Option 2 EIRR falling below 12% \nis  only  11.5%.  Supplementary  Appendix  K,  Project  Risk  Analysis  fully  describes  the \nmethodology and assumptions used in the risk analysis. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty Reduction \n\n1. \n\nPoverty and Socioeconomic Impacts \n\n \n72. \nChhattisgarh  is  one  of  India\u2019s  poorest  states.  About  45%  of  Chhattisgarh\u2019s  population \nlives  below  the  official  poverty  line  compared  to  35%  for  India  as  a  whole.17    The  Project  is \nclassified  as  \u201cpoverty  intervention\u201d  and  will  contribute  directly  to  poverty  reduction  by  lowering \ntransport  costs.  The  benefits  will  become  evident  in  higher  profit  margins  for  agricultural \nproducts  for  poor  farmers,  and  cheaper  and  faster  access  to  schools,  medical  clinics,  and \nemployment  centers.  Lower  transport  costs  will  increase  mobility  among  the  poor,  especially \npoor women, who will be able to reach social centers easier, and become more politically active, \nthus increasing the empowerment of the poor. \n \nImproving the 100-km sample subproject in Dantewada district will have a large effect on \n73. \nreducing  poverty,  it  will  directly  benefit  236,000  people  in  a  30-km  zone  of  influence.  About \n116,000 poor people will be direct beneficiaries, or about 50% of the total direct beneficiaries.18 \nEstimates  of  beneficiaries  include  only  those  who  will  benefit  in  the  long  run  from  the  lower \ntransport costs and induced economic and social development. This head-count approach gives \na  higher  estimate  of  poor  beneficiaries  in  the  Project\u2019s  influence  area  than  the  incidence  of \npoverty in Chhattisgarh. \n\n                                                 \n17 The poverty line used to define the \u201cpoor\u201d is India\u2019s nationally recognized estimate of income of Rs400/person per \n\n18 Final Report on Poverty Impact Assessment for the Government of Chhattisgarh under ADB TA 3995-IND.  \n\nmonth. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  \n\n17\n\n \n74. \nAnalysis  of  the  level  of  benefits  going  to  the  poor  has  been  examined  by  varying  the \ncompetition levels and changes in freight rates and passenger fees. The analysis indicated that \nproject  benefits,  as  envisaged,  are  expected  to  be  passed  on  to  the  poor.  Supplementary \nAppendix K gives details.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPoverty Impact Ratio \n\n \nBased  on  field  work  results,  and  many  survey  responses,  distribution  analyses  and \n75. \ncalculation of a poverty impact ratios (PIRs) were conducted for Options 1 and 2. The PIR for \nOption 1 is 1.07 and for Option 2, 1.17. The PIRs indicate that the total net economic benefits \nreaching  the  poor  will  exceed  the  Project\u2019s  net  economic  benefits.19  This  ratio  is  higher  than \nIndia\u2019s incidence of poverty, and income share of the poor. These findings strongly indicate that \nthe  Project  is  highly  pro-poor.  Appendix  8  and  Supplementary  Appendix  J  describes  the \nanalyses. The PIRs calculated were also subjected to a risk analysis, which is further described \nin Supplementary Appendix K, Project Risk Analysis. \n \n76. \nThe  estimates  do  not  include  the  expected  benefits  to  the  poor  of  improving  tertiary \nroads  for  rural  connectivity,  a  project  component.  Additional  benefits  will  probably  be \nsubstantial, because the tertiary roads link poor farmers and  their villages with state roads that \nare now impassable during the monsoon season. Selection of the rural connector roads to be \nincluded in the Project will be based mainly on criteria for poverty reduction.   \n \nD. \n\nSocial and Environment Impacts \n\nSocial Impacts \n\n1. \n \n77. \nAn  initial  social  assessment  (ISA)  was  conducted  for  the  entire  scope  of  the  proposed \nproject.  ADB  reviewed  and  confirmed  the  ISA  findings  and  recommendations  through \ncommunity consultations and further social assessment, which indicated unanimous support for \nroad  improvements.  Key  reasons  for  public  support  of  the  road  network  include  poor  road \nconditions and, resulting traffic accidents, and road congestion, particularly in urban areas. Also, \nsmall  roadside  businesses  offer  the  poor  a  valuable  source  of  income.  Improvement  of  the \nsample  subproject  from  Konta  to  Jagdalpur,  a  seriously  deteriorated  link  to  NH43,  which \nconnects Chhattisgarh and Andra Pradesh, is expected to facilitate through traffic for intra- and \ninter- state freight and passenger traffic, and reduce travel time substantially. \n \n78. \nDetailed engineering design, based on community consultations and social assessments \nfor selected state highways, will improve road shoulders to enable safe access for pedestrians \nand slow traffic, bus stops with seating, wayside amenities, and truck stops that cause minimal \nroad congestion. Such amenities will be included as long as they do not entail land acquisition \nand  resettlement.  The  design  will  include  information  signs,  and  speed  breaks  near  schools, \nhospitals,  and  congested  areas.  Assessment  of  the  social  and  poverty  impacts  provides  the \nbasis  for  integrating  social  concerns,  and  is  part  of  the  criteria  for  selecting  subprojects \n(Appendix 5 and Supplementary Appendix L). \n\n                                                 \n19  The  poor  will  receive  most  of  the  gross  economic  benefits,  but  will  contribute  only  a  small  share  of  gross   \n\ninvestment costs.  \n\n \n\n\f18\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n2. \n\nResettlement \n\n \n79. \nThe  subproject  selection  criteria  and  technical  design  have  recommended  road \nimprovements  that  will  not  entail  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement.  PWDGOC  has \nprepared  a  resettlement  plan  for  the  sample  subproject  and  a  resettlement  framework  for  the \nsample subproject. ADB\u2019s policy requirements were followed for involuntary resettlement under \nsector lending, and for the mitigation of adverse effects on affected people. GOC will prepare a \nresettlement plan for each subproject, and submit them to ADB for approval before awarding of \ncivil works contracts. \n \n80. \nAn institutional assessment showed that PWDGOC\u2019s capacity to undertake resettlement \nresponsibilities should be strengthened. The  Project will contribute, through consulting services \nfor  institutional  improvement,  to  strengthening  of  the  capacity  to  manage  resettlement  by \nconducting  workshops  and  seminars  to  create  social  awareness  and  strengthen  coordination \namong  government  and  civil  societies  that  address  resettlement  problems,  particularly  those \nthat concern road improvements.  \n \n81. \nTo  support  the  initiative  for  road  sector  development,  a  project environment and social \nunit  (ESU)  will  be  established  within  ARD,  then  within  DRA.  Through  its  responsibilities  for \nsocial  impacts  and  safeguards,  ESU  will  be  responsible  for  assessments  of  social  impact, \nincluding (i) monitoring the implementation of resettlement plans and social mitigating measures \nfor  projects,  (ii)  implementing  measures  to  mitigate  social  and  resettlement  impacts,  (iii) \nimplementing resettlement plans that GOC has approved, and are acceptable to ADB, and, (iv) \ncapacity  building  for  ARD  and  DRA  in  undertaking  those  responsibilities.  Supplementary \nAppendix  D  gives  the  resettlement  framework  and  Supplementary  Appendix  M,  the  summary \nresettlement action plan for the sample subproject. \n \n\n3. \n\nIndigenous People  \n\n \nAbout 44% of Chhattisgarh\u2019s population is tribal and scheduled castes.20 The Project is \n82. \nconfined to existing road alignment, so it will not affect such groups within its area of influence. \nThe improved road network will improve access to services and econom ic opportunities for tribal \npeople and scheduled caste groups, as well as all segments of the state\u2019s population. Because \nof  the  high  percentage  of  tribal  and  scheduled  caste  populations  in  the  areas  of  project \ninfluence,  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  status  of, and a review of GOC\u2019s current policies for, the \ndevelopment  of  indigenous  people  was  conducted  under  the  PPTA  (Supplementary  Appendix \nN). That was to enhance distribution of project benefits and to recommend practical measures \nto  promote \nIndigenous  People \nframework \nDevelopment Plan (IPDP) was also prepared (Supplementary Appendix C). \n\nindigenous  people.  A \n\nthe  development  of \n\n \n\n4. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\n \n83. \nThe  Project  is  categorized  as  a  \u201cB\u201d  project  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nAssessment  Guidelines  2003.  The  Project,  which  mostly  involves  improving  existing  roads \nwithin the right-of-way, is not subject to the 1994 India Environmental Assessment Notification. \n                                                 \n20  A  \u201cscheduled  tribe\u201d  is  among  the  weaker  sectors  of  India\u2019s  population.    Article  342  of  India  Fundamental  Rights, \nwhich are enshrined in the Constitution, defines \u201cscheduled tribes\u201d as specific tribes or tribal communities, or parts \nof or groups within tribes or tribal communities. \"Scheduled caste\u201d is defined as the lowest caste in the Hindu caste \nsystem. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  \n\n19\n\nThe initial environmental examination (IEE), which included an environmental management plan \nfor the sample subproject, was prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment \nGuidelines 2003.  \n \nThe  IEE  shows  that  the  sample  subproject  may  generate  minor  environmental  impacts \n84. \nduring construction. But with construction activities limited to improvement of the existing road \nsections,  environmental  impacts  will  be  limited  to  effects  associated  with  earthwork,  and  the \nmovement and storage of construction materials. Most environmental impacts during operation \nwill  be  related  to  vehicle  emission  and,  in  some  road  sections,  to  embankment  erosion. \nMitigation  measures  related  to  construction,  specified  in  the  environmental  management  plan, \nwill  be  incorporated  into  civil  works  contracts.  Implementation  of  mitigation  concerning \nconstruction  will  be  the  contractors\u2019  responsibility.  But  PWDGOC  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementing the environmental management plan. \n \n85. \nFor  the  remaining  subprojects,  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures \nwill follow the model of the sample subproject, including that (i) PWDGOC will prepare the IEE \nincluding  the  environmental  management  plan  for  each  remaining  subproject,  and  submit  the \nIEE reports to ADB; (ii) PWDGOC will hire an environmental consultant to prepare IEE reports \nfor  the  remaining  subprojects;  (iii)  PWDGOC  will  review,  then  submit  the  IEE  reports  to  ADB; \n(iv)  PWDGOC  will  supervise  and  monitor  implementation  of  the  environmental  management \nplans,  including  environmental  mitigation  measures  described  in  the  IEE  reports;  and  (v) \nPWDGOC  will  submit  to  ADB  progress  reports  on  the  implementation  of  the  environmental \nmanagement plans. The Project will finance no subprojects that pass through national parks or \nsanctuaries, or that widen road sections within reserve forests. \n \n86. \nTo  address  environmental  concerns  related  to  the  Project,  and  future  road  projects, \nPWDGOC will establish the ESU. During the first year of project implementation, the embryo of \nESU will be part of the PIU, with staff assisted and, trained by domestic consultants. The ESU is \nexpected to operate fully in the second year of project implementation. \n \n \n \nAppendix  9  gives  a  detailed  analysis  of  HIV/AIDS.  Given  the  status  of  HIV/AIDS  in \n87. \nChhattisgarh  and  ongoing  activities  of  the  Chhattisgarh  AIDS  Control  Society  (CACS),  the \nProject will use existing resources in the best manner possible to support HIV/AIDS preventive \nmeasures  in  connection  with  CACS\u2019s  established  activities.  Project  support  will  include  (i) \nconducting  awareness  campaigns  among  targeted  risk  groups  and  the  general  public,  and  (ii) \nlinking  and  coordinating  with  CACS  and  its  ongoing  HIV/AIDS  programs.    Non-government \norganizations  that  have  worked  through  ongoing  projects  of  CACS  are  conducting  awareness \ncampaigns \nfor  high-risk  groups.  The  Project  will  address  HIV/AIDS  concerns  during \nconstruction.  The  contractors  will  conduct  awareness  training  on  HIV/AIDS  for  construction \nworkers.  The  training  programs  and  materials  should  be  designed  and  conducted  by  staff  of \nCACS  or  qualified  non-government  organizations  (NGOs)  in  accordance  with  ongoing  CACS \ncampaigns  and  awareness  programs.  This  requirement  will  be  stipulated  in  all  civil  works \ncontracts.  Consultants  for  construction  supervision  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  the \ncontractors\u2019  implementation  of  programs.  Findings  and  recommendations  of  the  monitoring \nshould be reflected in project progress reports and submitted to ADB for review. \n \nThere  is  no  official  evidence  of  human  trafficking  in  Chhattisgarh.  No  donors  have \n88. \nsponsored  studies  to  confirm  official  data  on  human  trafficking.  The  human  trafficking issue \nremains  to  be  studied  through  continued  policy  dialogue  with  GOC,  field  surveys  and  social \n\nHIV/AIDS and Human Trafficking \n\n5. \n\n \n\n\f20\n\n \n\n  \n\nworks, surveillance and monitoring by state agencies, and NGOs to identify problem areas and \nmeasure their implications for future projects. \n \nE. \n\nProject Risks and Safeguards \n\n89. \nProjected  risks  that  the  economic  evaluation  will  not  prove  the  Project  feasible  have \nbeen  examined  in  detail.  The  Project\u2019s  economic  analysis  has  been  subjected  to  a \ncomprehensive  risk  analysis  to  examine  the  effects  of  several  key  variables,  namely  (i)  traffic \nvolumes in the base year, (ii) traffic growth rates, (iii) capital costs, (iv) maintenance costs, and \n(v) generated traffic. The @Risk computer program was used for risk analysis. Results indicated \nthat  the  probability  that  the  EIRR  of  Option  1  will  fall  to  less  than  12%  is  only  4.8%,  and  the \nprobability  of  the  EIRR  of  Option  2  falling  below  12%  is  only  11.5%.  These  low  probabilities \nindicate  that  the  economic  evaluation  is  \"robust\"  to  variations  in  main  parameters  used  to \ndetermine  economic  viability.  The  methodology  and  assumptions  used  in  the  risk  analysis  are \ndescribed fully in Supplementary Appendix K Project Risk Analysis. \n \nRisks  to  institutional  reform  relate  to  GOC\u2019s  commitment  to,  and  ownership  of,  the \n90. \nProject,  and  GOC\u2019s  abilities  in  make  policy  changes.  As  an  ADB  focal  state,  GOC  is  reform-\noriented.  Good  governance  and  good  infrastructure  are  primary  development  goals.  GOC  has \ninitiated  institutional  reforms  to  establish  the  DRA  and  improve  its  business  process  and \nmanagement  of  state  roads,  and  has  requested  ADB\u2019s  assistance  in  designing  and \nimplementing  the  reform.  During  the  entire  Project  processing,  and  through  intensive  policy \ndialogue,  GOC  has  confirmed  that  reform  is  Chhattisgarh\u2019s  priority  for  road  development.  To \nfurther mitigate the risks, the Time-bound Policy Action Plan was prepared, and agreed upon by \nADB  and  GOC  (Appendix  4).  The  plan  highlights  milestones  of  policy  measures  and  policy \nchanges that GOC will make within the timeframe.  It will be covenanted in the Loan and Project \nAgreements for the Project. \n \nRisks  for  investment  are  limited  to  quality  control  because  of  PWDGOC\u2019s  current \n91. \ncapacity  constraints  on  contract  management  and  work  construction  supervision,  and  limited \nwork experiences with international contractors. This can be mitigated by consulting services for \nconstruction  supervision  and  capacity  building  for  PWDGOC  on  contract  management  and \nquality  control.  Contracts  have  been  divided  into  relatively  large  packages  to  attract  both \ninternational  and  large,  qualified  domestic  contractors,  to  ensure  good  performance  and  high-\nquality  construction.  GOC  and  ADB  have  agreed  to  have  intensive  reviews  of implementation \nprogress and issues, and of performance of consultants and contractors.  \n \n92. \nIntensive preparatory works and studies were carried out on the impacts of the sample \nsubproject,  which  represents  the  main  technical,  social,  and  environmental  features  of  the \nmajority Chhattisgarh road network.  GOC has prepared and approved a resettlement plan, an \nIEE,  an  indigenous  people\u2019s  development  program,  a  resettlement  policy  framework,  and  an \nindigenous  people\u2019s  development  framework.  ADB  reviewed  and  found  those  safeguard \ndocuments acceptable. Furthermore, specific requirements were incorporated in the  subproject \nselection criteria and covenanted in the Loan and Project Agreements, to ensure full compliance \nwith ADB\u2019s safeguard policy requirements and guidelines. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  \n\n21\n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  GOI  and  the  GOC  have  provided  the  following \n\n93. \nassurances which have been incorporated into the legal documents: \n \n\nGeneral.

Chhattisgarh\u2019s road network has deteriorated \nseriously because of a 10-year neglect of investment in road development and maintenance. Of \n35,000  km  of  state  roads,  about  25%  are  in  very  poor  condition  and  only  10%  are  in  fair \ncondition.  The  other  65%  of  the  state  roads  are  in  poor  condition.  This  situation  was  caused \nmainly by three factors: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nLack  of  quality  control  and  supervision  of  road  maintenance  works,  which  is \noutsourced to private contractors, is poor.  \nLack  of  capability  and  capacity  in  modern  road  maintenance.  Equipment  for \nroutine road maintenance is inadequate and obsolete; and  \nPWDGOC\u2019s capacity and qualified expertise for road maintenance management \nneeds immediate improvement and modernization.  \n\n \n2. \nSince  the  founding  of  Chhattisgarh  state,  the  Government  of  Chhattisgarh (GOC) has \nallocated  necessary  budget  to  improve  the  riding  quality  (IRQ)  of  state  roads  through  major \nrepairs  and  periodic  maintenance.  The  IRQ  program  will  be  continued  for  all  state  roads. \nAnalysis of the actual budget allocation for road maintenance over the past 3 years shows that \nGOC has given a reasonable emphasis on road maintenance as a whole. Also, analysis of labor \nuse  and  employee  assignment  showed  that  all  casual  labors  and  50%  of  work  charges  were \nassigned for road maintenance. The main problems with road maintenance are quality control \nand the planning and management of maintenance.  \n \nA. \n\nExisting Road Maintenance Activities \n\nChhattisgarh\u2019s  road  maintenance  system  is  based  on  the  standard  Public  Works \n3. \nDepartment  Manual  (PWDM),  which  was  published  almost  a  century  ago  and  has  been \nmodified periodically. The PWDM includes guidelines on duties and, working and administrative \nprocedures,  but  lacks  instructions  for  financial  authority  and  indicators  of  performance \nmonitoring  and  evaluation.  The  PWDM  specifies    (i)  establishment  of  the  Public  Works \nDepartment,  (ii)  works  it  will  carry  out,  (iii)  special  rules  for  irrigation  and  navigation,  and  (iv) \nwork accounts. The PWDM categorizes PWDGOC operations as (i) original works, new works, \nalterations, and additions; and (ii) repairs and maintenance. \n \nB. \n\nOrganizational Arrangement for Road Maintenance \n\n4. \nThe  following  positions  form  a  management  tree  with  key  responsibilities  for  road \ndevelopment  and  maintenance.  They  cover  decisions  on  planning,  budget  preparation  and \nallocation,  assignment  of  tasks,  implementation  arrangements,  monitoring,  and  performance \nevaluation.  The  positions  comprise  (i)  secretary,  (ii)  engineer-in-chief,  (iv)  chief  engineers for \nzones, (iv) superintendent engineers, (v) executive engineers, (vi) sub-divisional engineers, and \n(vii) sub-engineers, or technical assistants.  \n \n5. \nin the following sections. \n \n\nDetailed responsibilities of the positions, with its specific road maintenance activities, are \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n25 \n\n \n\n \n7. \n \n\n \nD. \n\nC. \n\nWorking Procedures \n\n6. \nits own funds: \n \n\nThree steps are required before PWDGOC can begin any work, other than repair, with \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nadministrative  approval  (concurrence  from  the  responsible  and  competent \nauthority), \ntechnical  sanction  (based  on  detailed  estimates  by  the  responsible  authority), \nand \nappropriation  and  re-appropriation  of  funds  (allotment  or  rejection  of  funding \nrequirements). \n\nThe two types of maintenance activities are: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nroutine maintenance, performed by casual labor with minimal technical guidance \nand little supervision, and with no clear budget allocation except salary for labor \nand materials; and \nperiodic maintenance, carried out either on schedule or in response to needs.  \n\nRoutine Maintenance Activities \n\n8. \nLaborers have traditionally carried out routine road maintenance. The labor crews have \nnot  been  provided  with  appropriate  tools  and  equipment  because  of  scarcity  of  funds,  or \nbecause the tools provided are obsolete. \n \n9. \nThe  distance  that  the  crews  cover  is  more  than  they  can  handle  with  the  equipment \nprovided.  The  crews  usually  walk  or  bicycle  to  their  work.  All  routine  maintenance  work  is \nthrough direct engagement of local contractors who, in turn, hire the labor. PWDGOC provides \nmaterials for routine maintenance, or PWDGOC procures the materials locally through its local \nbranch offices. \n \n10. \nRoutine maintenance normally includes patching; sealing of cracks; cleaning of ditches; \ndressing of slopes; trimming of tree branches; and white washing of safety posts, parapets, and \nhill cut slopes. \n \nE. \n\nPeriodic Maintenance \n\nitemized  estimates  of  materials  needed.  Most  drawings \n\n11. \nFor periodic maintenance, officers in charge of each section prepare proposals based on \ninspections, which are mostly visual and with no appropriate testing. The officers then prepare \nassessment  reports  and \nfor \nsupplementary reference to the detailed estimates are done manually. \n \n12. \nThe estimates are prepared mostly for periodic maintenance, scheduled over 6\u20138 years. \nIn  most  cases,  the  type  of  treatment  is predetermined, with no substantiating investigations of \nactual road conditions or performance indicators. \n \n13. \nPWDGOC  has  trucks,  bitumen  boilers,  static  rollers,  and  drum  mix  plants  for  periodic \nmaintenance activities generally known as renewals. But the equipment has not been fully used \nor  maintained,  and  has  become  obsolete,  because  of  ineffective  recovery  of  costs  of  capital, \nmaintenance, and operations. Because GOC decided to outsource road maintenance and other \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nroad  works  to  the  private  sector,  no  further  budget  allocations  have  been  made  to  operate  or \nrefurbish the equipment. \n \n14. \nThe  PWDGOC  publishes  it  normal  rates  for  manual  and  mechanized  works.  The  rates \nare estimated based on approved sources of material and established average lead distances \nto the nearest sources. \n  \nF. \n\nBusiness Process for Periodic Maintenance  \n\n15. \nThe  business  process  for  periodic  maintenance  is  initiated  at  the  section  level  by \ncollecting  data  on  road  conditions  and  updating  the  maintenance  activity  chart,  based  on  the \nlast periodic maintenance. The estimates are then forwarded for scrutiny and verification, then \nto  the  sub-divisional  officers,  then  to  the  divisional  officers  or  executive  engineers.  The \nexecutive  engineers  compile  data,  with  details  of  the  previous  year\u2019s  allocations  to  concerned \nsections. \n \nThe  chief  engineers  further  compile  zonal-level  details  from  each  division.  The  chief \n16. \nengineers prepare summary estimates detailing the number of kilometers to be maintained, and \nstructures to be repaired or replaced. These details are forwarded to the engineer-in-chief who \ncompiles  the  data,  assisted  by  chief  engineer  (planning),  and  issues  job  orders  for  periodic \nmaintenance. PWDGOC maintains no database on road sections for either long-term or short- \nterm planning. \n \n17. \nThe  PWDM  specifies  the  following  data  collection  frequencies  for  preparing  cost \nestimates for periodic maintenance, and to rationalize the maintenance program: (i) traffic count: \ntwice yearly, (ii) road condition: once yearly, and (iii) surface condition: once yearly.  But these \ndata collections are not being implemented because funding and expertise are lacking. \n \nG. \n\nBudget Approval \n\n18. \nThe estimates, prepared by the engineer-in-chief, are proposed to the Secretary, along \nwith  other  requirements  for  budget  approval.  Based  on  the  approved  budget,  the  engineer-in-\nchief consults with the zonal chief engineers and chief engineer (planning) about distributing the \nfunds. The main PWDGOC criteria for distributing funds are: \n  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\nreview of bar charts for the past 5 years on periodic renewal, \ncondition of the road and severity of the problems, and their effects on delaying \nplanned activities. \nintervention criteria based on road condition and available funds, \nimplementation arrangements, and \nidentification of eligible contractors. \n\n \n19. \nContractors are registered according to financial capability and equipment capacity. The \nregistrations are renewed or cancelled, based on contractors\u2019 performance. The registration and \nclassification  of  contractors  have  been  revised  following  the  provisions  in  the  PWDM.  The \nrevised  thresholds  for  registration  of  contractors  by  class  and  person  delegated  authority  to \nregister these contractors are given in Table A1.1. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n27 \n\nTABLE A1.1:  Registration Thresholds \n\nfor \n\nClass \n\nFinancial Capability \n \n \nRs1 million \nRs5 million \nRs10 million \nRs40 million \nUnlimited \n\nAuthorized  Contact  Person \nContractor\u2019s Registration \n \nChief engineer \nChief engineer \nEngineer-in-chief \nEngineer-in-chief \nEngineer-in-chief \n\n \nA-I \nA-II \nA-III \nA-IV \n \nRs= Indian rupee(s) \nSource:  project participatory technical assistance (PPTA) final report and loan processing missions. \n \n \n20. \nby the executive engineers. \n \nH. \n\nTendering \n\nAs part of the registration requirements, contractors must supply the certificates certified \n\nPeriodic  maintenance  works  are  tendered  to  short-listed  contractors  based  on  sealed \n21. \ntenders that have been invited in an open and public manner by advertising in local or national \nnewspapers. The criteria for advertising are (i) as much as Rs500,000 for publication in regional \nor local newspapers in regional languages; (ii) Rs500,000 to Rs2,000,000 for publication at the \ndistrict level in two newspapers and at the state level in the regional language; and (iii) higher \nthan  Rs2,000,000  for  publication  in  English-language  newspapers,  and  in  two  regional \nnewspapers.  \n \nI. \n\nBid Evaluation \n\n22. \nBids  are  evaluated  based  on  guidelines  in  the  PWDM.  The  guidelines  were  recently \nupdated for implementation. For bid evaluation, a committee  is formed including PWDGOC and \nFDGOC. \n \n23. \nBids  are  invited  from  qualified  and  registered  contractors.  Based  on  the  financial \nproposals  and  bid  evaluation  guidelines  specified  in  the  PWDM,  PWDGOC  is  considering  the \nadoption of bid evaluation procedures and applications for national highways projects. \n \nJ. \n\nQuality Control  \n\nCombined teams of representatives of PWDGOC and the contractor\u2019s normally carry out \n24. \nquality control. This mechanism is not  practical for small works. In most cases, the mechanism \nis not implemented, so there is a lack of supervision or quality control. \n \nK. \n\nMonitoring System for Contractor\u2019s Performance \n\n25. \nContractors  that  perform  poorly  are  not  allowed  to  bid  for  future  contracts.  New \nguidelines with special conditions to address non-performing contractors, or irregularities in their \nexecution of contracts, have not yet been implemented. Payments are monthly, but are usually \nlate because of funding constraints. Contractors can neither claim extra payment for the delays, \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nnor  choose  the  mode  of  compensation.  The  superintending  engineers  and  chief  engineers \narbitrate claims for the PWDGOC. \n \nL. \n\nRecording and Measurement \n\n26. \nSub-engineers  record  measurements  to  be  agreed  upon  by  contractors.  Sub-divisional \nengineers check the measurements. The agreed-upon and verified measurements are entered \ninto a measurement book. The divisional accountants verify the bills of payment before the bills \nare  forwarded  to  the  executive  engineers  (payment  officers)  for  final  check  and  payment.  The \nexecutive engineers check 10% of the total payments made. \n \n27. \nThe  current  road  maintenance  system  needs  major  reform  and  restructuring.  Current \nguidelines should be revised and updated substantially, following international norms and other \nmore effective models in India, such as that implemented by the National Highway Authority of \nIndia. \n \nM. \n \n28. \nIn  addition  to  the  sector  budget  and  expenditure  analysis  in  the  main  text,  further \ninformation is provided in the tables below for annual expenditures by the end of March 2003. \nThe information excludes plan and non-plan works on national highways funded by the Ministry \nof Road Transport and Highways, but National Highways Zone employees and office costs are \nincluded in PWDGOC administration. \n \n\nPWDGOC Budget for State Roads and Bridges As of March 2003 \n\nTable A1.2: Budget for State Roads and Bridges, PWD as of 29 March 2003  \n(Rs millions) \n \n\n  \n\n  \n\nBudget \nHead \n\nDescription \n\nAllotment \n \n\n0101  A.

The subprojects will be selected during implementation according to \nthe selection criteria agreed  by  the  Government  of  Chhattisgarh  (GOC)  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB).  Using  the  sector  approach  for  the  investment,  a  sample \nsubproject  was  selected  as  representative  of  the  remaining  state  roads.  The  sample \nsubproject runs from Chhindgarh to Konta, a distance of 100.3 km. \n \nEconomic  evaluation  of  the  sample  subproject  was  carried  out  by  using  the \n2. \nHighway  and  Design  Maintenance  Model  (HDM-4).  The  benefits  to  road  users  were \nestimated by comparing the differences between the costs in the \u201cwithout-project\u201d case \nwith  those  in  the  \u201cwith-project\u201d  case.  The  improved  road  will  reduce  operating  costs, \nwhich  will  stimulate  economic  growth.  The  model  compared  the  annual  streams  of \neconomic capital and operating costs and benefits and computes the net present values \n(NPV)  and  the  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRR).  All  costs  and  benefits  were \nexpressed  in  2003  constant  prices.  The  analysis  period  is  for  the  construction  period, \nfollowed by 20 years of operation.  \n \nB. \n\nRoad Condition and Traffic \n\n1. \n\nRoad Condition \n\n3. \nThe  existing  road  condition  has  been  investigated  through  topographic, \npavement  condition,  and  roughness  surveys.  After  a  review  of  the  traffic  flows  and \ncondition of the existing pavement, the project road was divided into three homogeneous \nsections.  Table  A8.1  shows  surface  roughness  levels  in  accordance  with  the \ninternational roughness index (IRI) for each section of the existing road. The rate of road \ndeterioration used in the economic analysis is based on the levels of surface roughness \nbefore project implementation (i.e., the \u201cwithout project\u201d case, which are compared with \nroughness  values  in  the  \u201cwith  project\u201d  case,  and  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs \nbecause of road improvement are calculated.  \n \n\nTable A8.1 Road Condition Data \n\nRoad Section \n \n\nSection 1 \nSection 2 \nSection 3 \n\nDescription \n\n \nChhindgarh to Sukma \nSukma to MDR 37 \nMDR 37 to Konta \n\n        IRI = International Roughness Index \n        MDR = Major District Road \n \n\n2. \n\nTraffic Volume  \n\nDistance (km)  Roughness (IRI) m/km \n \n\n \n\n20.3 \n36.3 \n43.7 \n\n8.6 \n9.2 \n9.3 \n\nClassified traffic volumes on the Project road were determined from 2003 traffic \n4. \nsurveys.  Six  3-day  counts  were  conducted;  three  included  1-day  origin-destination \nsurveys.  These survey results were normalized by applying seasonal factors to obtain \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\n Appendix 8 \n\nannual average daily traffic for the base year. The traffic counts were split into motorized \ntraffic (cars and utility vehicles, buses, trucks, tractors, motorized rickshaws, and motor-\ncycles) and non-motorized traffic (bicycles). Traffic volumes on the project road sections \nranged  from  1,600  2,340  vehicles  per  day.  The  average  traffic  composition  was  about \n72% motorized and 28% non-motorized vehicles.  \n \n\n3. \n\nAssumptions for Growth of Traffic Rates \n\nTraffic  growth  rates  were  based  on  an  analyses  of  various  parameters.  Current \n5. \nand  future  growth  in  net  state  domestic  product  (NSDP)  were  estimated.  The  income \nelasticity  of  transport  demand  was  used  to  determine  the  future  traffic  growth  rate  for \neach vehicle category. Traffic growth rates varied from 3 to 12% per annum, depending \non vehicle type and year. Based on the average vehicle composition for the project road, \nthe overall growth rate is projected at about 7% for 2003 to 2009, 6.6% for 2010 to 2014, \nand 6.5% beyond 2015.  \n \nC. \n\nCosts \n\n6. \nThe Project\u2019s economic costs were derived from the financial costs, and include \nconstruction,  maintenance,  and  social  costs  from  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \ncompensation.  Economic  costs  exclude  price  contingencies,  taxes,  duties, and interest \nduring construction. A standard conversion factor of 0.90 was applied to financial costs \nof  nontraded  inputs  to  calculate  economic  prices.  The  average  economic  life  of  the \nproject road is projected as 20 years.  \n \n7. \nTwo  investment  options  were  tested  for  the  project  road.option  1  was  to  widen \nthe  existing  road  to  an  intermediate-lane  standard  of  5.5  m  over  the  three  identified \nsections; Option 2 was to widen the existing one-lane road to two lanes of 7.0 m.    \n \nD. \n\nBenefits \n\n8. \nThe  Project\u2019s  main  economic  benefits  were  quantified  in  terms  of  savings  in \nvehicle  operating  costs  (VOCs),  because  better  road  surface  can  improve  VOCs. \nSavings  in  VOCs  accrue  to  \u201cnormal\u201d  traffic,  or  traffic  that  would  continue  on  the  road \neven  with  no  improvements;  and  to  generated  traffic,  or  traffic  that  was  not  there \npreviously,  but  road  improvements  will  make  possible.  The  benefits  due  to  generated \ntraffic are considered to be 50% of the savings in normal traffic.  Time savings were not \nevaluated in the analysis. The reasoning is that, in economic theory, the savings in time \nwould have to be put to another productive use in order to be included in the evaluation. \nIt can be argued, for example, that farmers in the project area could put some of the time \nsaved to a productive use through more intensive cropping. But this economic evaluation \nhas  estimated  benefits  conservatively,  by  concentrating  only  on  VOC  cost  savings  to \nnormal and generated traffic. \n \nThe benefits to road users were estimated by calculating the differences between \n9. \nthe  costs  in  the  \u201cwithout  project\u201d  case  and  the  \u201cwith  project\u201d  case.  The  HDM-4 model \nwas used to estimate the benefits over time. The model predicts pavement deterioration \nand  estimates  yearly  VOCss  over  the  life  of  the  investment  for  various  improvement \nstrategies. In both the \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d project cases, the road roughness level varies \nfrom  year  to  year  depending  on  traffic  and  maintenance.  The  roughness  level, \nexpressed as IRI, has a direct impact on VOCs and thus, on benefits. The model then \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n 51 \n\ncompares  life  cycle  costs  for  the  \u201cwith\u201d  project  and  \u201cwithout\u201d  project  situations,  and \ncomputes the NPV and estimates the EIRR.  \n \nE. \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return \n\n10. \nThe  economic  evaluation  discounts  the  stream   of  costs  and  benefits  over  the \nperiod 2004 to 2025, and values them at present 2003 levels.  The EIRR was calculated \nfor each project road options. TheEIRR for Option 1 (intermediate land, 5.5 m) was 18.3; \nthe EIRR for Option 2 (twolands, 7m) was 17.5. Supplementary Appendix J gives details \non the individual economic evaluations for each project road option.  \n\nF. \n\nSensitivity Analysis and Risk Analysis \n\n \n\n11. \nThe  sensitivity  of  the  project  road  EIRR  for  each  option  was  analyzed  with \nrespect to changes in  the  benefit  and  cost  streams.  Seven  sensitivity  test  cases  were \nexamined: (i) a 20% increase in construction costs, (ii) a 20% reduction in benefits, (iii) a \n50%  decrease  in  traffic  growth  rates,  (iv)  no  generated  traffic  benefits,  (v)  a  2-year \nproject  implementation  delay,  (vi)  less  than  optimal  road  maintenance,1,  and  (vii)  a \ncombination of a 20% increase in capital costs and a 20% reduction of benefits. Results \nshow  that  the  quantified  economic  benefits  are  quite  robust  to  various  sensitivity  tests, \nand  the  project  remains  economically  viable  (Table  A9.2).  The  only  test  in  which  the \nEIRR falls below 12% is if the traffic growth rates decreases by 50%. The probability of \nthis occurring is relatively small, as the risk analysis will show. \n\n \nTable A8.2 Results of Sensitivity Tests  \n \n\nSection \n \n\nBase Case \n \nCapital Costs increase by 20% \nBenefits Reduced by 20% \nDecrease in Traffic Growth Rates by 50% \nNo Generated Traffic Benefits \nTwo-year Implementation Delay \nLess than Optimal Maintenance  \nCapital  Costs  Increase  20%  &  Benefits \nDecrease \u2013 20% \nEIRR = economic international rate of return \nSource: PPTA and ADB Loan Fact-Finding Mission \n\nOption 1 \nIntermediate  \nLanes \nEIRR (%) \n18.3 \n \n16.1 \n15.6 \n9.9 \n18.0 \n15.9 \n13.8 \n13.6 \n\nOption 2 \nTwo  \nLanes \nEIRR (%) \n17.5 \n \n15.4 \n14.9 \n8.2 \n17.2 \n15.3 \n14.9 \n12.9 \n\n \n12. \nA risk analysis was also undertaken for both options, using the @Risk computer \nsoftware  program.  The  risk  analysis  enables  an  analysis  based  on  the  uncertainty  in \n                                                 \n1   In the \u201cbase\u201d situation the maintenance in the \u201cwith\u201d project situation allowed for an overlay when the IRI \nwas  greater  than  or  equal  to  6.0  m/km.  For  the  sensitivity  test  for  less  than  optimal  maintenance  the \noccurrence  of  an  overlay  has  been  removed  from  the  analysis  i.e.  no  overlay  will  occur  on  the  project \nroad. Although this is an extreme case it indicates the worst effect on the EIRR of the project under this \nsensitivity test. \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\n Appendix 8 \n\nestimates  of  input  parameters.  The  risk  analysis  was  based  on  triangular  probability \ndistributions for the main input parameters. The risk analysis runs a simulation, in which \npossible  values  of  the  variables  were  randomly  sampled  5,000  times  using  a  Monte \nCarlo non-stratified technique. Risk analysis then uses this information to analyze every \npossible outcome, executing hundreds of \u201cwhat-if\u201d scenarios. In each scenario, random \ninputs following the defined input probability distribution are generated, and the resulting \nfrequency  distributions  are  presented  graphically.  Results  from  the  analyses  indicated \nthat the probability of the EIRR for Option 1 falling below 12% is 4.8% and the probability \nof  the  EIRR  for  Option  2  falling  below  12%  is  11.5%.  The  @Risk  model  calculated  the \nnew mean EIRR for Option 1 as 14.3%. The minimum and maximum value of the EIRR \nfor  Option  1  was  calculated  as  10.5%  and  17.8%  respectively.  The  mean  value  of  the \nEIRR for Option 2 was calculated as 13.6%. The minimum and maximum value of the \nEIRR for Option 2 was calculated as 9.8% and 17.0% respectively. A description of the \nmethodology  used  in  the  risk  analysis  is  described  in  Supplementary  Appendix  K, \nProject Risk Analysis, describes the methodology used in the risk analysis. \n \nG. \n\nDistribution Analysis and Poverty Impact Ratio \n\n13. \nThe  economic  benefits  of  the  two  options  for  the  project  road  are  road-user \nbenefits:  voc  savings  for  normal  and  for  generated  traffic.  The  distribution  analysis \ndisaggregates  those  economic  benefits  to  passenger  and  freight  users,  vehicle \nowners/operators, labor,2, and the GOC.  \n \n14. \nIt  was  necessary  to  estimate  (i)  how  much  of  the  benefits  for  each  vehicle \ncategory  in  the  analysis  will  be  passed  on  to  vehicle  users,  and  (ii)  ownership  of  each \nvehicle  category.  To  do  this,  field  surveys  of  passengers,  drivers,  and  farmers  were \nconducted  in  the  project  road  area.  From  survey  results,  assumptions  were  made  of \nwhat benefits will be passed on to the service users. (Supplementary Appendix J).  \n \n15. \nDistribution  analysis  of  the  project  road  was  used  to  estimate a poverty impact \nratio (PIR) by determining how much of the benefits to each user class passed on to the \npoor.  Supplementary  Appendix  J  describes,  in  detail  the  assumptions  made  from  the \nfield surveys.  \n \n16. \nThe estimated direct benefits of  the two options to the economy in present value \nterms,  and  the  PIR  calculations,  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  J,  Table  SAJ.13  for \nOption  1  and  in  Table  SAJ.14  for  Option  2.  A  discount  rate  of  12%  is  used  in  both \noptions. The estimated direct benefits of Option 1 are Rs702.87 million, in present value \nterms.  These  figures  simply  represent  the  sum  of  the  present  value  of  benefits  to \npassengers, freight users, vehicle owners, and GOC. The net benefit to the economy as \na whole is Rs 300.18 million. For Option  2,  the  estimated  direct  benefits  are  Rs759.12 \nmillion and the net benefit to the economy is Rs292.46 million. The PIR for Option 1 is \n1.07  and  for  Option  2,  is  1.17.  These  are  conservative  estimates,  because  only  direct \nproject benefits have been considered. Based on the somewhat-uncertain assumptions \nin  the  PIR  calculation,  a  sensitivity  analysis  of  some  key  assumptions  was  conducted. \nThe sensitivity tests were (i) a 50% increase in competition, and (ii) a 50% decrease in \n\n                                                 \n2   As some of the projects capital expenditure and maintenance costs will be spent on local labor, unskilled \nlaborers will gain net benefits to the extent that their paid wages are higher than their opportunity cost of \nlabor (reflected in the SWRF).  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n 53 \n\ncompetition. Table SAJ.15 shows that an increase in competition leads to an increase in \nthe PIR. \n \n17. \nResults of a risk analysis on the PIR show that the expected PIR, based on the \nweighted average of all simulated combinations, is 1.24 for Option 1 and 1.01 for Option \n2. PIR\u2019s range from a minimum of 0.56 to a maximum of 2.26 for Option 1 and from a \nminimum  of  0.58  to  a  maximum  of  1.52  for  Option  2.  The  risk  analysis  undertaken  is \ndescribed in Supplementary Appendix K. \n \n18. \nFurther  details  of  the  assumptions  and  calculations  used  for  the  economic \nanalysis  and  distribution  analysis  for  both  Option  1  and  Option  2  are  given  in \nSupplementary Appendix J gives more details of the assumptions and calculations used \nfor the economic analyses and distribution analyses for Options 1 and 2. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\n Appendix 9 \n\n \n \nA. \n\nSUMMARY OF POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY \n\nContribution of the Project to Reduce Poverty \n\n1. \nChhattisgarh  is  one  India\u2019s  poorest  state.  Studies  show  that  about  45%  of  the \nstate\u2019s  population  of  21  million  is  poor,  living  below  the  official  poverty  line,  compared \nwith about 35% of India\u2019s population as a whole. \n \n2. \nThe Project involves improvement of about 1,700 km of priority state roads. The \nsubprojects will be selected during implementation according to criteria agreed between \nthe  Government  of  Chhattisgarh  (GOC)  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB). \nBecause of the sector approach taken for the Project, a sample subproject was selected \nas  representative  of  the  remaining  subprojects.  The  sample  subproject  runs  from \nChhindgarh to Konta, a distance of 100.3 km. \n \nThe Project is classified as poverty intervention, and will directly reduce poverty \n3. \nby lowering transport costs for the poor traveling to labor markets, farmers\u2019 markets, and \nhealth and education centers.  \n \nRehabilitating  the  representative  sample  subproject  in  Dantewada  district  will \n4. \nhave  a  large  effect  on  reducing  poverty,  directly  benefiting  237,000  people  in  a  30-km \nzone  of  influence.  Of  these,  an  estimated  117,000  poor  people  will  be  direct \nbeneficiaries,  or  about  50%  of  the  total  direct  beneficiaries.  These  estimates  of \nbeneficiaries  include  only  those  who  will  benefit  in  the  long  run  from  the  lowered \ntransport  costs  and  induced  economic  and  social  development.  This  headcount \napproach  gives  an  estimate  of  poor  beneficiaries  that  is  higher  than  the  poverty \nincidence  in  Chhattisgarh.  The  poverty  line  used  to  define  the  \u201cpoor\u201d  is  the  nationally \nrecognized maximum estimated expenditure of Rs.311/ person per month. \n \n5. \nBenefits  to  the  poor  from  lower  transport  costs  will  become  evident  through \nhigher profit margins for agricultural product profit margins for poor farmers, as well as \nlower costs and more timely access to schools, medical clinics and employment centers. \nFurthermore, the lower transport costs will increase mobility among the poor, especially \npoor women, to reach social centers and become more politically active, thus increasing \nthe social and political activities of the poor.  \n \n6. \nTo  obtain  information  on  use  of  the  Project  road,  passengers,  drivers,  freight \nshippers,  and  local  residents  in  its  zone  of  influence  were  surveyed.  The  surveys, \ncompleted in May 200,3 showed that 95% of the population in the zone of influence use \nthe  project  road.  The  surveys  also  showed  that  and  that  half  the  passengers  and \nhouseholds within the impact zone are poor, and a fourth very poor, based on the official \nnational poverty line.  \n \nSurvey  results  for  the  remaining  project  roads  were  based  on  direct  field \n7. \nobservations  of  a  carefully  selected  representative  sample  of  10  road  links  in  the  state \nroad  system  that  the  Project  may  improve.  The  road  samples  selected  for  the  survey \nrepresent about 30% of the 1,700 km of state roads that the Project should improve. \n \n8. \nThe  survey  of  passengers  showed  that  the  poor  are  heavy  users  of  the  roads. \nAverage  per-capita  passenger  income  is  estimated  at  Rs384  per  month;  the  nation\u2019s \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n 55 \n\nofficial poverty level is Rs311 per month. Classifying those whose per-capita incomes is \nless than or equal to Rs311 per month as very poor, 35 to 40% of Chhattisgarh\u2019s state \nroads are very poor. Using Rs400 per month as the line to define poor, about 55 to 60% \nof the passengers are poor.  \n \n9. \nThe  surveys  showed  that  farmers  comprise  90%\u2014and  subsistence  farmers, \n78%\u2014of those in the zone of influence for the sample subproject. The survey also show \nthat of the remaining 22% of farmers who sell agricultural produce, high transport costs \nforce all poor and very poor to sell their products only in markets that are nearby; they \ncannot access more distant markets where prices are higher. The surveys also showed \nthat  non-poor  farmers  use  these  roads  to  ship  their  products  to  more  distant  markets, \ndespite  bad  road  conditions.  Better  road  conditions  will  improve  access  for  the  poor  to \nthese more distant and larger markets. The improved roads will also reduce spoilage of \nagricultural produce benefiting both poor and non-poor farmers. The surveys and focus \ngroups showed that the degree of competition in the transport services market, including \npassenger and freight services, varies depending on the road condition. Competition is \ngreater on roads in better condition, but traffic is low and competition is weak on roads in \nvery  worn  condition,  traffic  is  low  and  competition  is  weak  on  roads  in  very  worn \ncondition.  That  competition  will  become  much  stronger  as  the  roads  are  improved \nthrough  the  Project.  With  the  poor  being  such  heavy  road  users,  and  competition \nhindered by poor roads, the Project will catalyze competition and service frequency, thus \nreducing freight rates.  That will cause even more intense use of the Project roads by the \npoor. This finding substantiates estimates of the Project\u2019s effects on the poor.   \n \nA poverty impact ratio (PIR) was calculated for the sample subproject for both of \n10. \nthe  improvement  options:  Option  1  which  improves  the  project  road  to  an  intermediate \nstandard of 5.5 m, and Option 2, which improves the project road to a two-lane standard \nof  7.0  m.  The  PIR  calculated  for  Option  1  is  1.07  for  Option  2,  1.17.  These  results \nassume  the  prevailing  level  of  competition  in  the  passenger  and  freight  transport \nmarkets. Descriptions of the distribution analysis and the resulting PIR calculation are in \nAppendix  8  and  Supplementary  Appendix  J.  Because  of  the  level  of  uncertainty  in \nchanges  to  key  variables  in  the  PIR  computation,  (e.g.,  the  level  of  competition  in  the \ntransport  market  etc.),  both  a  sensitivity  analysis  and  a  risk  analysis  were  also \nundertaken.  The  sensitivity  analysis  is  described  in  Appendix  8  and  Supplementary \nAppendix J. The risk analysis is described in more detail in Supplementary Appendix K, \nProject Risk Analysis.  \n  \nB. \n\nParticipatory Process \n\n11. \nCommunity consultations and the social assessment showed unanimous support \nfor  improving  state  highways,  major  district  roads  and  rural  roads.  According  to  the \nresidents, poor road conditions increase the costs of access by the poor to health clinics, \nschools, labor markets, and farmers\u2019 markets.  By improving the Project roads, the poor \nresidents see that costs will decline and they will have easier access to key institutions \nthat determine their quality of life. In the focus groups, improved access ranked among \nthe  top  three  critical  needs  that  participants  identified.  Other  top  needs  included \nimproving the water management system, increasing the electricity supply, and lowering \nthe  costs  of  education.  The  consultations  also  showed  that  the  poor,  especially  poor \nwomen,  are  concerned  about  road  safety,  and  the  lack  of  bus  stops  in  villages  and \nhamlets. Residents are aware that bad road conditions and lack of access increases the \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\n Appendix 9 \n\ncosts  of  farm  inputs  and  delivery  of  farm  products  to  markets  and  the  resulting  high \ntransport costs cuts their farm incomes. \n \n12. \nImproved  access  ranked  among  the  top  three  critical  needs  that  participants \nidentified. Other top needs include improving the water management system, increasing \nthe  supply  of  electricity,  and  lowering  the  cost  of  education.  The  consultations  also \nshowed that the poor, especially poor women are concerned about road safety, and the \nlack of bus stops in the villages and hamlets.  Residents are aware that the low-quality \nroad conditions and lack of access increases the cost of retrieving farm inputs, delivering \nfarm products to market, and that these high transport costs cut their farm incomes.   \n \n13. \nBased on findings and recommendations from the community consultations, the \nProject  design  will  incorporate  improvements  to  shoulders  to  improve  safety  for \npedestrians  and  non-motorized  traffic;  covered  bus  stops  with  seating;  wayside \namenities;  and  truck  stops,  to  reduce  road  congestion  where  necessary.  The \nimprovements  will  be  made  if  they  do  not  entail  land  acquisition  or  resettlement.  To \naddress concerns about road safety, the design will include information signs and speed \nbreaks near schools, hospitals, and areas with heavy pedestrians traffic, such as towns \nand markets. Also, the Project will adopt a community road safety program designed for \nrural  roads  in  Chhattisgarh  for  implementation  on  state  roads,  especially  on  accident- \nprone zones near urban and large settlement areas. \n \nC. \n\nGender Issues \n\nResearch elsewhere in Madhya Pradesh and in South Asia has shown that when \n14. \naccess is difficult, men participate more actively in society than women.  When access \nimproves, as it will through the Project, women become more mobile and more socially \nactive;  they  are  better  able  to  reach  centers  of  political  activity,  and  gain  political \nempowerment. Thus, the Project will thus increase women\u2019s empowerment. \n \n15. \nThe public consultations showed that men receive substantially higher wage than \nwomen who provide the same labor. The Project will encourage employment targets for \nwomen  to  participate  in  road  construction,  and  require  contractors  to  pay  the  same \nwages to men and women for work of equal value. Targeting and providing a quota for \nwomen  in  road  rehabilitation  will  provide  employment  where  such  opportunities  are \nscarce, and allow women to increase family incomes. During the rehabilitation phase the \ncontractors  will  be  required  to  provide  service  stations  that  will  improve  working \nconditions for women who take on road works jobs.  A gender strategy is not required as \na project component. \n \nD. \n\nResettlement \n\n16. \nThe subproject selection criteria and technical design include recommendations \nfor  road  improvements  that  will  not  entail  land  acquisition.  Involuntary  resettlement  will \nbe  limited  to  the  dismantling  of  a  small  number  of  encroachments3  at  a  few  spots. \nFollowing  ADB\u2019s  policy  requirements  for  involuntary  resettlement  under  sector  lending, \nand  to  mitigate  adverse  impacts  on  affected  people,  The  Chhattisgarh  Public  Works \nDepartment  (PWDGOC)  prepared  a  resettlement  plan  and  a  resettlement  policy \n\n                                                 \n3  Less  than  200  persons  affected  with  insignificant  impacts  for  all  subprojects  including  the  core  Project \n\nroad. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n 57 \n\nframework  for  implementation  in  the  sample  subproject.  GOC  will  prepare  and  submit \nresettlement  plans  for  each  subproject  to  ADB  for  approval  civil  works contracts are \nawarded. \n \nAn  institutional  assessment  on  PWDGOC\u2019s  capacity  to  undertake  resettlement \n17. \nresponsibilities  showed  that  a  need  to  strengthen  such  capacity.  The  Project  will \ncontribute,  through  consulting  services  for  institutional  improvement,  to  strengthen  the \ncapacity to manage the resettlement by conducting workshops and seminars to create \nsocial awareness and strengthen coordination among the government and civil societies \nconcerned  in  addressing  resettlement  problems,  particularly  those  related  to  road \nimprovements.  \n \nTo  support  the  sector  development  initiative,  a  social  and  environment \n18. \nmanagement unit will be established within the Agency for Road Development\u2019s (ARD) \nPIU for the Project, following the example of the National Highway Authority of India. The \nunit  will  be  responsible  for  social  impact  assessment,  including  (i)  monitoring  of  the \nimplementation  of  resettlement  plans  and  social  mitigating  measures  for  projects,  (ii) \nimplementation  of  measures \nimpacts,  (iii) \nimplementation  of  resettlement  plans  approved  by  ADB,  and  (iv)  capacity  building  for \nARD  and  the  Dedicated  Road  Authority  (DRA)  for  undertaking  those  responsibilities. \nthe  Resettlement  Policy  Framework  and \nSupplementary  Appendix  D  provides \nSupplementary  Appendix  M  provides  the  Summary  Resettlement  Action  Plan  for  the \nsample subproject. \n \nE. \n\nto  mitigate  social  and  resettlement \n\nIndigenous People  \n\nAbout  44%  of  Chhattisgarh\u2019s  population  is  tribal  and  scheduled  castes.4    The \n19. \nProject is confined to existing road alignment, so such groups with its influence area will \nnot  be  affected.  The  improved  road  network  will  improve  their  access  to  services  and \neconomic  opportunities  for  tribal  and  scheduled  castes,  and  for  all  segments  of  the \npopulation. But because the high percentage of tribal and scheduled caste population in \nthe Project influence areas, a detailed analysis of the status of indigenous people, and a \nreview of GOC\u2019s current policies for their development were conducted under the Project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  (Supplementary  Appendix  C).  The  purpose  is  to \nenhance distribution of project benefits and recommend practical measures to promote \nindigenous  people  development.  A  Framework  Indigenous  People  Development  Plan \n(IPDP) was also prepared (Supplementary Appendix N).  \n \nF. \n \nAccording  to  the  statistics  of  the  National  AIDS  Control  Organization  (NACO), \n20. \nmore than 4.5 million people in India were infected by HIV/AIDS5 by late 2002. That is a \n15%  increase  over  2001.  Only  55  cases  of  HIV/AIDS  were  reported  in  Chhattisgarh  in \n2002, in a population of about 21 million. The low incident rates could be partly related to \nChhattisgarh\u2019s  isolation,  but  it  might  also  partly  be  explained  by  the  absence,  until \n\nHIV/AIDS and Human Trafficking \n\n                                                 \n4  \u201cScheduled  Tribe\u201d  is  one  of  the  weaker  sections  of  Indian  population.

In July 2003, the \nChhattisgarh State AIDS Control Society (CACS) established nine centers for HIV/AIDS \ntesting  and  counseling  through  GOC\u2019s  programs  on  HIV/AIDS  prevention.  After  the \ncenters\u2019  first  full  year  of  operation,  more  accurate  data  on  HIV/AIDS  is  expected. \nMeanwhile, CACS, in an interim report, identified 428 sites at risk of HIV/AIDS, including \nlocation  frequented  by  truck  drivers,  brothels  and  floating  facilities  for  commercial  sex \nworkers. Given the current status of HIV/AIDS in Chhattisgarh, and CACS\u2019 established \nand ongoing activities, the Project will make best use of the existing resources to support \nHIV/AIDS  prevention.  Project  activities  will  include  (i)  conducting  awareness  campaign \namong targeted risk groups and the general public, and (ii) linking and coordinating with \nCACS and its ongoing HIV/AIDS programs. \n \nSome non-government agencies (NGOs) are working through CACS projects to \n21. \nconduct  awareness  campaigns  for  high-risk  groups,  so  the  Project  will  focus  on  the \nHIV/AIDS  issue  during  the  construction  period.  The  contractors  will  be  required  to \nprovide awareness training on HIV/AIDS for construction workers. The training materials \nand  programs  should  be  designed  and  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  CACS \ncampaigns and awareness programs. This requirement will be stipulated in all civil works \ncontracts. Consultants for construction supervision will be responsible for the monitoring \nthe contractors\u2019 implementation of the programs. Findings and recommendations of the \nmonitoring  should  be  reflected  in  the  project  progress  reports  prepared  by  the \nconstruction supervision consultants and submitted to the ADB for review. \n \n22. \nAt  the  PWDGOC  level,  the  consultants  or  CACS  or  NGO  staff  will  train  staff  of \nthe  social  and  environmental  unit  in  HIV/AIDs  prevention  by  for  implementation  of the \ninstitutional  improvement,  and  to  coordinate  with  CACS  and  other  concerned  state \nagencies. \n \nRegarding  human  trafficking,  there  is  no  official  evidence  of  human  trafficking \n23. \ncases  in  Chhattisgarh  as  of  today.  Neither  there  is  any  study  undertaken  by  donors  to \nconfirm  official  data  on  human  trafficking.  The  issue  of  human  trafficking  will  remain  to \nbe  studied  through  continuing  policy  dialogue  with  the  GOC,  field  surveys  and  social \nworks,  surveillance  and  monitoring  by  various state agencies and NGOs concerned to \nidentify  areas  of  problems  and  measure  the  magnitude  of  impacts  for  development  of \nmitigating measures in future projects. \n \nG. \n\nLabor Issues \n\n24. \nThe Project will ensure that the civil works contractors comply with all applicable \nlabor laws and will not employ children for construction or maintenance jobs. Contractors \nwill  be  required  to  provide  appropriate  facilities  for  child  dependants  in  construction \ncampsites. \n \nH. \n\nOther Social Risks and Vulnerabilities \n\n25. \nThe primary risks to project implementation are: (i) executing agencies and other \nstakeholders  may  lack  the  capacity  to  address  social  and  poverty  issues;  (ii)  the \nabsorptive capacity of PWDGOC may be lower than initially assessed and thus, require \ninstitutional strengthening beyond that proposed for the Project; (iii) a lack of competition \nin the bus transport services market may arrests the flow of benefits to the poor; and (iv) \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n 59 \n\nadditional  regulation  of  the  freight  services  market  may  set  freight  rates  so  high  that \nbenefits are not passed to the poor.   \n \n26. \nmitigate the remaining risks, the Project will: \n\nThe  project  design  incorporates  countermeasures  to  mitigate  these  risks.    To \n\n \n\n(i) \n\ndesign  and  implement  a  strong  project  monitoring  system  to  provide \nfeedback for timely remedies, \n\n(ii)  provide institutional support to PWDGOC during implementation,  \n(iii)  provide  a \n\ninstitutional  specialist \n\nlong-term \n\nto  help \n\nimplement \n\nthe \n\nrestructuring of PWDGOC;  \n(iv)  provide  consulting  services \n\ninstitutional  strengthening \nChhattisgarh Transport Department to assist in deregulation, and \ninvolve  ADB  in  close  project  supervision  to  correct  flaws  in  design  or \nimplementation. \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\nto \n\n(v) \n\n \nA  specific  risk  is  that  the  poor  may  not  be  enabled  to  realize  the  expected \n27. \nbenefits.  To ensure that the poor are able to share these benefits, the design consultant \nwill  develop  a  program  based  on  strong  public  participation  in  a  number  of  workshops \nthat will educate: \n \n\npoor farmers on to how to use commercial inputs,  \n\n(i) \n(ii)  poor farmers on how to best market their surplus products, \n(iii)  poor passengers on how to negotiate lower fares to reflect the cost savings \n\ngoing to the bus and taxi drivers,  \n\n(iv)  poor  shippers  of  products  on  how  to  negotiate  lower  freight  charges \n\nreflecting the improved road conditions, and \n\n(v)  poor  women  on  increasing  their  political  and  social  involvement  in  the \n\ncommunity. \n\n \n28. \nThe  design  consultant,  together  with  the  Executing  Agency  and  ADB,  will \ndevelop and implement the project performance management system. The system will \nprovide feedback on a number of indicators to show that the benefits are being passed \nto the road users, particularly poor users, as well as residents in the zone of influence. \nSome illustrative indicators that show the benefits being passed to the poor will include \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nuse of improved construction materials by residents, and poor residents, for \ndwellings in the zone of influence; \nincreased commercial sales of specific farm products, including rice, wheat, \ngram, and sorghum from the zone of influence; \nlower passenger fares on improved roads; and \nlower freight rates on improved roads. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["Currency Unit \n", "Indian rupee/s (Re/Rs) \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 30 October 2003) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "$0.021 \nRs45.5 \n", " \n \n \n", " \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", " \n \n", "Re1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "ADB \nARD \nBOT \nCACS \nFDGOC \nPWDGOC \nTDGOC \nCIDC \nDRA \nEIRR \nEMMP \nESU \nGOC \nGOI \nHDM \nHIV/AIDS \n", "ICB \nIEE \nIRC \nIRI \nISA \nJBIC \nLIBOR \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAgency for Road Development \nBuild-operate-transfer \nChhattisgarh AIDS Control Society \nFinance Department Government of Chhattisgarh \nPublic Works Department Government of Chhattisgarh \nTransport Department Government of Chhattisgarh \nChhattigarh Infrastructure Development Corporation \ndedicated road authority \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental Monitoring and Management Plan \nenvironment and social unit \nGovernment of Chhattisgarh \nGovernment of India \nHighway Development and Maintenance Tool \nhuman immunodeficiency virus/ acquired immunedeficiency \nsyndrome \ninternational competitive bidding \ninitial environmental examination \nIndian Roads Congress \ninternational roughness index \ninitial social assessment \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation \nLondon inter-bank offered rate \n", " \n \nNOTES \n", "(i) \n", "(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 March. \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "MORTH \nMOT \nMPRSD \nNGO \nPIA \nPIR \nPIU \nPMGSY \nPPTA \nPWD \nPWDM \nRMC \nVOC \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Ministry of Road Transport and Highways \nMaintenance-operate-transfer \nMaster Plan for Road Sector Development \nNon-government organization \npoverty impact assessment \npoverty impact ratio \nproject implementation unit \nPradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana \nproject participatory technical assistance \nPublic Works Department \nPublic Works Department Manual \nRoad Management Committee \nvehicle operating cost \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", "This report was prepared by a team consisting of: S.
