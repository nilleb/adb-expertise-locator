THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Kingdom of Cambodia for the additional financing of the Second Rural Water Supply and \nSanitation Sector Project. The report also describes (i) the proposed administration of a grant to \nbe provided by the Sanitation Financing Partnership Trust Fund1 under the Water Financing \nPartnership Facility, and (ii) the proposed administration of technical assistance (TA) to be \nprovided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, both for the additional financing of the \nSecond Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project, and if the Board approves the \nproposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  approve  the \nadministration of grant and TA.2 \n \n2.  The  project  was  designed  to  expand  access  to  improved  rural  water  supply  and \nsanitation (RWSS) and to improve the health of rural residents in six provinces around the Tonle \nSap Lake in Cambodia.3 Since its approval in 2009, the project contributed to government \nefforts to achieve its Millennium Development Goal targets of increased rural water supply \ncoverage by 50% and rural sanitation coverage by 30% by 2015, and its long-term sector vision \nof universal coverage by 2025. The project is performing well. The additional financing will \nfinance partial changes in scope and expand activities. It will support the current project\u2019s original \nobjectives,  enhance  monitoring,  and  test  climate  change  adaptation  and  disaster  risk \nmanagement initiatives. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n3.  More  than  77%  of  Cambodia\u2019s  population  lives  in  rural  areas.  A  focus  on  rural \ndevelopment,  infrastructure,  and  delivery  of  basic  services  is  the  first  step  in  accelerating \npoverty  reduction,  reducing  regional  inequalities,  and  supporting  inclusive  growth.  Rural \nresidents spend considerable time and financial resources acquiring their daily drinking water \nfrom distant water sources, collecting rainwater, or having it delivered to their homes. In 2014, \naccess to improved water supply sources in rural areas was 51.1%, and access to improved \nsanitation was 46.2%.4 The type of water supply and sanitation facilities available to households \nare important determinants of community health.5 An intensified focus on RWSS will increase \nlow levels of coverage, improve health, and accelerate poverty reduction, especially in the Tonle \nSap Basin where most of Cambodia's poorest live.6 An integrated approach to RWSS will also \ncontribute to gender equity and livelihood improvements. \n \n4.  On  15  September  2009,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  a  grant \nequivalent to $21 million for the Second Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project.7 The \nexpected  outcome  was  improved  access  to  water  supply  for  377,000  rural  residents  and \nsanitation for 290,000 rural residents in 400 villages in 40 communes in 16 districts of six \nprovinces. The project covers 100% of villages in each commune and aims to achieve 100% \n                                                \n1  Financing partner: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  Banteay Meanchey, Battambang, Kampong Chhnang, Kampong Thom, Pursat, and Siem Reap provinces. \n4  Ministry of Planning. 2015.

It is a sector \ninvestment project with five outputs: (i) improved community health and hygiene practices; \n(ii) rehabilitated,  upgraded,  and  new  water  facilities;  (iii)  improved  public  and  household \nsanitation; (iv) strengthened sector planning and development; and (v) improved capacity for \nproject implementation. \n \n5.  Implementation  progress.  The  project  is  performing  well  and  rated  on  track,  with \ncumulative  contract  awards  amounting  to  $21  million  (99%),  and  cumulative  disbursements \namounting to $21 million (99%) as of 30 June 2016. ADB approved a cumulative extension of \n12 months  (to  31 December  2016)  to  (i)  complete  latrine  building  works,  and  (ii) process \nadditional financing. The performance of the experienced executing agency\u2014the Ministry of \nRural  Development  (MRD),  implementing  agencies,  and  consultants  was  consistently \nsatisfactory.  Targets  for  contract  awards  and  disbursements  were  met  annually  and  MRD \nsubstantially complied with grant covenants.8 \n \n6.  Achievements  to  date  and  opportunity  for  expansion.  The  project  successfully \ncompleted assistance to 32 communes in four batches, covering 364 villages in six provinces \naround the Tonle Sap Lake. The project benefited a population of 338,200 through improved \nwater  supply  facilities.9 The  project  also  provided  sanitation  grants  to  45,677  households \n(208,500 people) for latrine construction and encouraged a further 4,219 households (25,000 \npeople) to finance their own latrine, increasing average sanitation coverage to 80%.10 While the \nproject covered fewer communes, it achieved 90% of its rural water supply target and 93% of its \nrural  sanitation  target.  The  project  (categorized  gender  equity  as  a  theme)  significantly \ncontributed to strengthening women\u2019s roles in local government and project-related committees, \nincluding all training activities (mostly exceeding the 40% target). In partnership with other \ndonors, the project assessed the means to enhance climate change resilience for rural water \ninfrastructure, including the provision of low-cost bottled water and the treatment and reuse of \nhousehold  latrine  waste.  Building  on  the  project\u2019s  success, there  is  opportunity to  expand \naccess to improved RWSS to an additional 275 villages in 28 communes in the same six \nprovinces, 11  increasing the total number of villages to 639 across 59 communes. 12 \n \n7.  Modification and cost increase. The project suffered marginal overspending of 10%, \nunder output 2, to construct new deeper wells because of the inability to rehabilitate some wells, \nwhich  could  not  supply  safe  water  year  round.  In  addition,  $500,000  was  reallocated  for \nemergency well rehabilitation in 2012 following the severe 2011 Cambodia flooding. As a result, \nonly 32 out of 40 communes were completed. Other project components met budget allocations. \n \n8.  Rationale for additional financing. Additional financing will be needed to (i) scale up \nproject activities in 19 new communes (para. 6), increasing beneficiaries; and (ii) complete the \noriginally targeted 40 communes, which fell short after changes in project design (para. 7). \nAccording to the National Action Plan 2014\u20132018, the government target for 2018 is 60% \ncoverage for RWSS, resulting in a national gap of 439,400 households (2.02 million people) for \nwater supply and 580,400 households (2.67 million people) for sanitation. 13 The current annual \n                                                \n8  Summary of Progress Against Grant Covenants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  Facilities include (i) rehabilitation of 1,324 drill wells, 325 hand dug wells, 365 combined wells, and 53 community \nponds; and (ii) development of 985 new drill wells, 6 combined wells, 75,330 rainwater jars, 1,130 bio-sand and \nceramic water filters, 24 piped water supply systems, 99 river water distribution points, and 28 production wells. \n10 Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 28 communes comprise: 1 commune only half completed from initial list of 32, and 27 additional communes. \n12 Scope of Additional Financing (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n13 MRD. 2014. National Action Plan: Rural Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene 2014\u20132018. Phnom Penh. \n ", "3 \nlevels of growth for water supply (1.8%) and sanitation (4.3% post-2010) are insufficient to \nreach the 2018 target coverage, and both must be accelerated to at least 5% per annum until \n2025 to realize the vision of 100% coverage. Improved water supply coverage ranges from 3.5% \nto 42.0% in the 27 additional proposed communes, and sanitation coverage ranges from 0.9% \nto 45.0%. These figures are lower than the national average. \n \n9.  The  project  is  performing  well:  it  has  successfully  delivered  expected  outputs  and \nmaintained  satisfactory  implementation  progress  and  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  policies.  The \neligibility criteria for additional financing are met, including (i) the overall project\u2019s continuing \nscope; (ii) its validity, soundness, and strategic importance to underpin welfare and poverty \nreduction; and (iii) its consistency with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Cambodia, 2014\u2013\n2018.14 The additional financing modality is suitable because of (i) strong links with the current \nproject, including capacities developed; (ii) a high degree of project readiness, and a well-\nperforming executing agency; and (iii) scaling up project benefits using innovative designs in \nclimate change and sanitation developed under the TA and grant. \n \n10.  Strategic alignment. Additional financing will contribute to the government\u2019s efforts to \nachieve universal coverage for improved water supply and sanitation coverage by 2025. The \nproject  (i)  remains  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  which  focuses  on \nstrengthening urban\u2013rural links in the Tonle Sap Basin; and (ii) is included in ADB\u2019s country \noperations business plan for Cambodia, 2016\u20132018.15 Lessons include (i) the need for greater \nfocus on gender and leadership to overcome cultural norms; (ii) the need to develop equitable \nsolutions to address increases in the cost of community small piped water supply facilities, which \nhamper poorer households meeting beneficiary contributions; and (iii) the need to introduce \nclimate change adaptation and mitigation together with disaster risk management to address the \nimpact of climate change on RWSS, which is becoming significant with more severe floods and \ndroughts and the depletion of groundwater sources in the dry season. \n \nB.  Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n11.  The  impact  of  the  overall  project,  which  is  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  National \nStrategy for Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (footnote 13), will be universal access \nto sustainable RWSS nationwide by 2025 and improved health of rural households in project \nprovinces.  The  outcome  of  the  overall  project  remains  unchanged:  increased  access  to \nimproved RWSS in selected communes of six provinces around the Tonle Sap Lake. The \nnumber of rural residents with access to improved water will increase from 377,000 to 578,500, \nwhile  the  number  of  rural  residents  with  access  to  improved  sanitation  will  increase  from \n290,000 to 462,800. Additional financing will build and expand the current project outputs as \nfollows: \n \n12.  Improved  community  health  and  hygiene  practices.  Output  1  will  (i)  increase \ncommunity mobilization and action in 275 additional villages; (ii) prepare additional village water \nsupply and sanitation plans for 27 additional communes; (iii) form and train 2,200 additional \nwater and sanitation user groups (WSUGs); (iv) strengthen community groups and individuals \nfor effective delivery of health and hygiene, as well as climate and disaster risk messages; and \n(v) improve household-level water and sanitation management. \n \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2014.

Rehabilitated, upgraded, and developed new water facilities. Output 2 will deliver \nthe following additional targets: (i) rehabilitation and/or upgrading of existing water supply points \nand development of new water supply points to provide universal safe water supply coverage \nfor 275 villages (2,200 water supply points); (ii) new rainwater collection systems and storage \ntanks for at least 140 public facilities, including schools and health facilities; and (iii) improved \nmonitoring of water quality for all water facilities, including the development of a national water \nquality  monitoring  program.  New  construction  will  be  based  on  the  cost-sharing  principles \nalready adopted and implemented under the current project. \n \n14.  Improved public and household sanitation. Output 3 will reduce open defecation by \nexpanding sanitation coverage to at least 80% through the provision of (i) 135 new public latrine \nblocks  at  schools  and  health  facilities;  and  (ii)  34,500  additional  grants  for  the  poor  and \nvulnerable for household latrine construction. \n \n15.   Strengthened sector planning and development. Output 4 will continue to provide \n(i) improved monitoring and supervision of RWSS facilities by maintaining and upgrading the \nRWSS database used under the current project in six provinces, (ii) support to the water and \nsanitation  sector  working  group  coordination  meetings,  (iii)  strengthened  private  sector \ninvolvement in RWSS development through training in technical and management fields, and \n(iv) improved RWSS monitoring and evaluation for health outcomes. Additional financing will \nfinance  training  for  climate  change  adaptation  and  mitigation  and  develop  disaster  risk \nmanagement plans for RWSS at national, provincial, commune, and village levels. \n \n16.   Improved capacity for project implementation and sustainability. Output 5 will be \ndelivered through (i) project orientation workshops at national and subnational levels; and (ii) a \ncapacity development program for MRD, provincial departments and district offices of rural \ndevelopment, commune councils, RWSS committees at the village level, and WSUGs.  \n \nC.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n17.  Additional financing is estimated to cost $19.93 million equivalent (Table 1), including \ngovernment financing for taxes, duties, beneficiary contributions, and interest charges on the \nADB loan and physical and price contingencies.

ADB will be the executing agency and administer the TA. 19 \nThe government will provide counterpart support in the form of staff, office accommodation, \nlocal land transport, and other in-kind contributions. The TA will integrate new concepts and \ninitiatives linked directly to the loan, including (i) development of rural water safety plans for both \nrural water and sanitation; (ii) education and training in climate change resilience and adaptation \nfor RWSS, particularly for floods, droughts, and impacts on groundwater; (iii) disaster risk \nmanagement (planning, response, and recovery) to better prepare and react to impacts from \nclimate variability and change; and (iv) mainstreaming of climate change activities directly into \nthe RWSS program and resulting infrastructure, specifically targeting local government and \nvillage levels, where the climate change impacts are directly felt. These will be achieved through \nthree primary outputs: (i) a new RWSS capacity development program to increase knowledge at \nnational and provincial levels and enhance project sustainability; (ii) capacity development in \nRWSS to increase operational knowledge at commune and village levels; and (iii) new initiatives \nfor enhanced project sustainability. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n23.  Compliance with selection criteria will be required for new subprojects. This is based on \nfactors such as the incidence of poverty and existing water supply and sanitation coverage. \nFeedback from project beneficiaries relating to equipment, facilities, and technologies used \n                                                \n18 Subproject feasibility studies and bidding documents are being reviewed by ADB. \n19 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nhave led to the development of tried-and-tested standard designs, which are selected based on \nthe prevailing conditions at each commune and village. These designs have proven to be robust, \ndurable, technically viable, and well received by the communities. The project will scale up \ndesigns proven to be compatible with local conditions and community capacity for operation and \nmaintenance (O&M). Location and design features of RWSS facilities will factor in disaster and \nclimate risk considerations, specifically to provide improved protection from flood damage and \npotential contamination from latrines during flooding. Lessons identified in para. 10 will be \nconsidered to further improve project performance and sustainability. Additional refinements will \nbe made as more emphasis is placed on sustainability, climate change adaptation, and disaster \nrisk management. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n24.  Two sample subproject communes were selected for feasibility. The economic viability of \ntwo sample communes\u2014Kouk Khathen in Banteay Meanchey and Ngom in Kampong Thom\u2014\nwas assessed. The analysis evaluated a range of technical options and confirmed that each \nsubproject is the least-cost option for each commune. 20  Taking into account the cost of the \nwater supply and the sanitation facilities, the economic internal rate of return is 16.2% for Kouk \nKhathen and 18.8% for Ngorn, and remained above 12% for all sensitivity scenarios. Both \nsubprojects are economically viable. The economic benefits of the water supply components \ninclude (i) storage cost avoided, (ii) treatment cost avoided, and (iii) the value of time saved for \nnot having to collect water. For sanitation, the economic benefits include (i) productivity savings \nbecause of reduced incidence of diseases, and (ii) health care costs avoided. Economic costs \nwere derived from the financial estimates of capital investments and O&M costs after eliminating \nall duties and taxes, estimating the traded and nontraded components of costs, and multiplying \nthe net results by appropriate conversion factors. Under the project, the government provided \ntechnical support to the beneficiary communities to ensure  the sustainability of the largely \ngranted water supply and sanitation facilities, including establishing appropriate institutional \narrangements  such  as  WSUGs  for  community-managed  facilities.  The  financial  analysis \nreviewed project achievements and found WSUGs exercised ownership over their facilities, with \naffordable user charges collected at least to cover O&M costs (e.g., piped water systems). 21 \n \nC.  Governance \n25.  Utilization of project funds was substantially in accordance with the original plan, but \nreallocation of funds was needed several times to align budgets with actual conditions and the \nincreased budgetary requirement for new water supply facilities. Management of the imprest \naccount versus disbursements initially caused some delays in implementation because of the \nlarge  number  of  contracts  under  community  procurement,  but  this  was  resolved  with  an \nincrease in the imprest account ceiling. Procurement oversight and financial management of the \nproject by the executing agency and Ministry of Economy and Finance was highly satisfactory \nespecially  given  the  1,792  contracts  procured,  administered,  and  completed.  Institutional \ncapacity  developed  satisfactorily  and  implementation  issues  were  addressed  adequately  to \nensure  that  the  project  continuously  met  or  exceeded  performance  targets  throughout \nimplementation. No complaints or incidences were recorded with respect to corruption and \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was satisfactory. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the government and the MRD. \n                                                \n20 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nThe  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  PAM \n(footnote 17). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n26.  The project will directly benefit 253,000 rural residents with access to improved water, of \nwhich 190,000 people will also benefit from improved sanitation facilities in 28 communes. \nBased on the figures from the current project, 60% of the project beneficiaries are poor or \nvulnerable  given  (i)  the  higher-than-average  rural  population  share,  (ii) rural  poverty  being \nhigher than urban poverty, (iii) the higher-than-average poverty incidence in project provinces, \nand (iv) the targeting methodology that reaches the poorest communes in the project area. \nAccess to improved RWSS will improve the health status of households (especially children and \nthe elderly) and reduce medical expenditure, through the supply of improved RWSS facilities, \nsanitation awareness, and training in water, sanitation, and health. It also increases the rate of \nchild survival, which is a precursor to the demographic transition to lower fertility rates. The \nadditional financing will not have any significant adverse impacts, as potential adverse impacts \nidentified during project preparation were eliminated or mitigated by changes in design.22 \n \n27.  Gender.  A  gender  action  plan  builds  on  the  implementation  experiences  of  that \ndeveloped for the current project. 23 It ensures broad understanding of and attention to the \ndifferent needs of women and men in the RWSS sector, and provides equal opportunities for \nwomen and men to access project benefits and participate in capacity development activities. \nSpecific targets include the following: (i) at least 50% of the selected commune and village focal \npersons, including peer leaders, are women; (ii) at least 40% of RWSS committee and WSUG \nboard members are women; and (iii) village project activities are implemented in cooperation \nwith  the  commune  council  committees  on  women  and  children's  affairs.  The  plan  is  in \naccordance with the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs national strategy for gender mainstreaming, \nMRD gender working group action plan, and ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998). \n \nE.  Safeguards \n28.  Environment. The current project was category B for environment. Compliance with \nenvironmental safeguard requirements was satisfactory and risks were adequately managed.24 \nAll  subprojects  supported  under  the  current  project  were  screened  and  categorized  in \naccordance with the environmental assessment and review framework prepared in 2009, and \nclassified category C. 25 Civil works financed under the overall project are limited to small-scale \ncommunity-based RWSS equipment and facilities. The environmental impacts associated with \nthe installation of facilities are minimal and temporary (including noise, dust, and community \nhealth and safety related to minor excavation and drilling works), highly localized and site-\nspecific, and can be easily mitigated with good construction practices commonly known to \ncontractors. All RWSS facilities to be supported under the additional financing will be installed \nwithin  boundaries  of  existing  villages  and  directly  contribute  to  the  Tonle  Sap  Biosphere \nReserve\u2019s development function to foster sustainable development of ecology, environment, \neconomy, society, and culture.26 The overall project remains category B. The framework was \n                                                \n22 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Review missions were conducted on 25\u201331 October 2015 and on 15\u201321 May 2016. \n25 The  2009  framework  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines (2003), and the government\u2019s environmental requirements. \n26 The Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve, which was established by a royal decree in 2001, has three functions: \n(i) conservation\u2014protection  of  biological  diversity,  landscapes,  and  ecosystem;  (ii) development\u2014sustainable \n ", "9 \nupdated to conform to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and to address some of the \nweaknesses in adhering to compliance procedures that were identified during due diligence \nactivities.27 The nine subprojects identified as the first batch of the additional financing have \nbeen  confirmed  as  category  C.  The  climate  risk  to  the  additional  financing  is  considered \nmedium. Siting of RWSS facilities will be identified in consultation with local communities to \navoid flood-prone areas and facility design will be improved to provide greater resistance to \nflood damage. Neither will significantly increase costs. The attached TA will help increase \nclimate resilience of RWSS. \n \n29.  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  current  project  did  not  require  any  land \nacquisition as households within the target villages voluntarily donated land for water points \n(hand  pumps)  and  larger  parcels  of  land,  such  as  community  ponds,  were  situated  on \ngovernment  land.  No  loss  of  livelihood  or  income  occurred.  Due  diligence  showed  that \nhouseholds voluntarily provided their land with no evidence of coercion or pressure and the \ndonation was conducted with full consultation of the landowners and households within the \nvillage. The overall project has been classified category C for involuntary resettlement. The \nadditional financing will adhere to methods used for the current project; namely, land donations \nfor water points where hand pumps will be placed. The lengthy process of land titling is ongoing \nand completion will be monitored during project implementation. To ensure that screening is \nconducted and procedures are followed, an involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples, and \nsocial  safeguards  screening  guidance  note  is  provided. 28  Subprojects  with  involuntary \nresettlement impacts will not be eligible for financing. Due diligence will be exercised to ensure \nthat poor households are not required to donate land. Due diligence shall be carried out on a \nrandom sample of each subproject.  \n \n30.  Indigenous  peoples.  As  with  the  current  project,  the  overall  project  is  classified \ncategory B for indigenous people safeguards, which are triggered because the Chams are a \ndistinct group that will experience project impacts, albeit purely positive impacts. The project \nidentified  three  Cham  villages  within  Kampong  Thom,  Kampong  Chhnang,  and  Pursat \nprovinces, specifically within the Boeng, Khabt Trach, Svay, Svay Chhick, Cheab, and Phteas \nRong  communes.  The  said  villages  are  predominantly,  if  not  100%,  Cham.  In  this  light, \nelements of an indigenous peoples plan are included in the project design in lieu of preparing a \nplan. Though no separate plan is required, monitoring reports will include a specific section on \nCham villages and provide evidence of meaningful consultation and specific culturally sensitive \nand appropriate actions that were implemented. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n31.  The overall risk assessment is medium, and the integrated benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 \nand described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.29 \n \n                                                                                                                                                       \ndevelopment of ecology, environment, economy, society, and culture; and (iii) logistic\u2014demonstration projects, \nenvironmental education and training, research, and monitoring. \n27 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 Involuntary Resettlement, Indigenous Peoples, and Social Safeguard Screening Guidance Note (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisk  Mitigating Measures \nLack of beneficiary  The current project provides detailed and accurate estimate of costs and \ncontributions for small piped  required beneficiary contributions.

ASSURANCES \n32.  The government and the MRD have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n33.  The government and the MRD have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan and grant agreements. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n34.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR10,835,000  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  additional \nfinancing of the Second Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project, from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period \nand 1.5% per annum thereafter, for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n31 August 2016 \n \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpacts the Project is Aligned With \nCurrent project \nAccess to improved RWSS nationwide and better health of rural households in project provinces \nenhanced (National Strategy for Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene and the National Strategic \nDevelopment Plan 2014\u20132018).a \nOverall project \nUnchanged.  \n  Data Sources and \nResults  Performance Indicators with Targets and  Reporting \nChain  Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nCurrent  Current project  Overall project   \nproject  By 2016: \na\u2013c. \nAccess to  a. 100% of residents in 40 communes (400 rural \nimproved  villages), especially women, have access to  Commune council \nRWSS in  improved water sources (2008 baseline: 13%)  database; Ministry of \nselected  b. 80% of residents in 40 communes (400 rural  Planning statistical \ncommunes of  villages), especially women, have access to  book \nsix provinces in  improved sanitation (2008 baseline: 8%)   \nthe Tonle Sap  c.
