THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based loan to Mongolia for the Social Welfare Support Program. \n \n2.  The program will support reforms under the country\u2019s economic adjustment plan to (i) \nimprove fiscal policy management, and (ii) develop policies and regulations to improve targeting \nand consolidate social welfare programs. Through these reforms, the program will help mitigate \nthe adverse effects of fiscal consolidation on the poor, and sustain financing for social welfare \nprograms.1 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Development  problems  and  opportunities.  Years  of  economic  reforms  and  the \ncountry\u2019s vast mineral wealth made Mongolia a middle-income country in late 2011. Prosperity \nand increased fiscal revenue allowed the government to strengthen social welfare programs \nwith positive results. Accounting for about 40.0% of the poor\u2019s income, social transfers in \nMongolia have significantly reduced poverty. Since 2010 poverty has declined by 17 percentage \npoints to 21.6% in 2014. It is estimated that the poverty rate would be about 10 percentage \npoints higher today in the absence of social welfare programs.2  \n \n4.  Although  a  decade  of  strong  economic  growth  has  substantially  boosted  average \nincomes and reduced poverty incidence, one in five Mongolians still lives in poverty and largely \n3\ndepends on welfare benefits for basic subsistence.  Nomadic families, households headed by \nwomen, and urban migrants have a particularly high poverty incidence, and are more vulnerable \nto the country\u2019s extreme cold winters. Income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, \nhas been reduced from 0.36 in 2008 to 0.32 in 2014. Despite progress, inequality is severe \nbetween the urban and rural areas, especially in the remote western regions.  \n \n5.  Because of its limited economic diversification, Mongolia is highly dependent on the \nmining sector, which in turn relies heavily on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows. This \nexposes the economy to external shocks, particularly swings in commodity prices and the \neconomic cycles of its trading partners. The current external environment, characterized by \n4 5\nfalling commodity prices  and slowing growth in the People\u2019s Republic of China,  is constraining \nMongolia\u2019s mineral production and fiscal revenue collection. This has been compounded by \nplummeting FDI6, delaying the start of large revenue-generating mining projects. Against this \nbackground, GDP growth has sharply declined, reducing job opportunities for the poor and \nvulnerable.7 \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  National Statistical Office of Mongolia and the World Bank. 2015. Poverty Profile in 2014. Results of the Household \nSocioeconomic Survey 2014. Ulaanbaatar. \n3  Detailed poverty data are provided in the Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n4  The prime mineral exports of Mongolia are coal, copper, iron ore, crude oil, and gold. Minerals constitute about \n90% of total goods exports. From December 2011 to March 2015, the price of gold has declined 22.6%, coal \n60.0%, and copper 17.3%. \n5  The People\u2019s Republic of China accounts for about 90% of Mongolia\u2019s total mineral and non-mineral exports. \n6   FDI fell by 55% in 2013 and 80% in 2014 due to political instability and weak investor confidence. \n7  GDP has declined from its peak of 17.3% in 2011, and the weakening growth momentum has continued. GDP \ngrowth slowed to 7.8% in 2014 and to 3.0% in the first half of 2015. ", "2 \n6.  The economic slowdown underscores the importance of strengthening social protection \nin Mongolia. Current macroeconomic imbalances caused by falling commodity prices threaten \nthe continuation of social welfare programs.  Reductions in the welfare budget  will reverse \npoverty reduction gains by creating new poor and bringing those that crossed the poverty line \nback into poverty. Given the positive impact of social welfare programs on poverty reduction in \n \nMongolia, continued support for them is vital. \n \n7.  Social  welfare  programs.  Social  welfare  in  Mongolia  is  an  integral  part  of  social \n8\nprotection.  In 2015, the Government of Mongolia allocated MNT285 billion on social welfare. \nThe Child Money Program contributed an additional MNT246 billion in 2015. The combined \nfunding amounts to 2.7% of GDP, exceeding the average 1.6% of GDP in other emerging \neconomies.9 Social welfare programs are generally pro-poor with about 35% of the benefits \n10\nreaching the poorest 20% in Mongolia.  By comparison, about 20% of benefits in Thailand \nreach the poorest 20% (footnote 10). \n \n8.  Welfare programs in Mongolia focus on the provision of social pensions, allowances, \nand services to citizens with special needs who are in poor health, lack family, and are not \ncapable of living independently. Programs also support individual household members who \nrequire  social  welfare  assistance  or  care  to  meet  their  minimum  needs.  The  Ministry  of \nPopulation  Development  and  Social  Protection  (MPDSP)  administers  71  social  welfare \n11\nprograms, which can be grouped into seven broad categories.  These programs reached about \none-third of the total population in 2014. Expenditures for all programs have been increased \nsince 2010 to reflect demographic trends in an expanding population, offset the impact of \ninflation on real incomes, and reduce poverty. \n \n9.  In  addition,  the  Food  Stamp  Program  distributes  MNT18  billion  to  its  144,000 \n12\nbeneficiaries. Initiated on a pilot basis in 2008 with Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing,  \nthe program became part of the entitlements guaranteed by the Social Welfare Law in 2013. It \nsupports the consumption of basic foods by extremely poor families to reduce vulnerability to \nfood insecurity and increase the household members\u2019 daily calorie intake. The Food Stamp \nProgram is the only welfare program using proxy means testing (PMT) to identify the poorest \nhouseholds. 13 \n \n10.  Since 2012, the Child Money Program has provided monthly payments of MNT20,000 to \nabout 1 million children 18 years old and younger. It is the largest program, accounting for half \nof the government\u2019s cash transfers. Given its universal coverage, the program has  helped \nreduce poverty significantly. It is funded by the Human Development Fund, which uses mining \nrevenue to support the economic and human development of the country. \n                                                \n8  Social protection in Mongolia has three major components: social welfare, social insurance, and labor market \nprograms. Details are in the Sector Assessment (Summary):  Public Sector Management (Social Protection \nInitiatives) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  World Bank. 2014.

Washington, \nDC. \n11 The categories are social welfare pensions, social welfare allowance, community-based services, social welfare \nallowance for the elderly with state merit, allowance for the elderly, allowance for the disabled, and allowance for \nmothers and children. \n12 ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Asian Development \nFund Grants to Mongolia for the Food and Nutrition Social Welfare Program and Project. Manila. \n13 PMT is a targeting methodology that estimates household income by associating indicators or proxies with \nhousehold expenditure or consumption. The test assesses eligibility for government assistance, based upon \nwhether the individual or household possesses the means to do without that help. \n ", "3 \n11.  However, challenges persist. Most social welfare programs are targeted by category, \nwhich is costly, as some of the recipients are not poor. Moreover, the fragmentation of programs \nresults in the duplication of benefits and high administrative and implementation costs. Some \nwelfare benefits are administered through various ministries and institutions, such as the school \ntextbook and electricity subsidies. These subsidies would have a greater impact on the poor if \nthey were better targeted. To reform these welfare programs, policy actions should focus on \nimproved poverty targeting and consolidation to reduce implementation costs and increase their \nimpact and sustainability. \n \n12.  Government action plan. The government, which assumed office in November 2014, \nhas  taken  important  steps  to  stabilize  the  economy  and  consolidate  fiscal  expenditure. \nParliament approved the government\u2019s Comprehensive Macroeconomic Adjustment Program \n(CMAP) in February 2015. The CMAP, which covers 2015\u20132016, contains a wide range of short- \nand medium-term policy actions targeting macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms to \nlay the foundation for sustainable growth. In addition to actions for fiscal consolidation and \nimproved debt management, the CMAP includes measures to strengthen social welfare in order \nto mitigate the impact of the adjustment costs on the poor, boost employment, and bolster the \ninvestment climate.  \n \n13.  The  core  of the  CMAP  is  improved fiscal  policy  management. The following  policy \nactions have already been implemented: (i) a budget amendment was passed in January 2015 \nto reduce fiscal expenditure, (ii) government ministries and agencies were downsized, (iii) a \nsalary increase for civil servants was postponed, and (iv) capital expenditure was reduced. \nEfforts to boost revenue collection include an 80% increase in excise taxes for fuel in January \n2015,  which  generated  an  additional  MNT228  billion  for  the  budget.  To  improve  budget \ntransparency, the Fiscal Stability Law (FSL) was amended to include off-budget expenditures \nfrom the Development Bank of Mongolia (DBM)14 and the Price Stabilization Program.15 \n \n14.  The FSL was also amended to reflect the adoption of a medium-term fiscal framework \ntargeting the gradual decline of the fiscal deficit to 2% of GDP and debt levels to 40% of GDP by \n16\n2018.  To mitigate the impact of the adjustment costs during fiscal consolidation, social welfare \nprotection was prioritized in the budget amendment. Pensions and welfare programs were \nincreased in January 2015 to offset the impact of inflation on purchasing power. Resources for \nthe Food Stamp Program, which is vital for the country\u2019s poorest, were augmented by 80%. \n \n15.  Fiscal gap. Despite the government\u2019s efforts, the short-term contractionary effect of the \nadjustment  program,  compounded  by  the  persistent  unfavorable  external  environment,  has \nresulted in additional fiscal revenue shortages. The 2015 fiscal gap is MNT500 billion. To meet \nthe requirements of the FSL for 2015, social welfare programs may have to be curtailed when \n                                                \n14 The DBM was established as a state-owned entity in 2011 with the mandate to support the financing of major \nprojects and programs for the country\u2019s development. However, the DBM\u2019s lending activities have generated large \nadditional fiscal deficits that were kept off-budget to circumvent the requirements of the FSL. The law caps the \nfiscal deficit at 2% of GDP and public debt at 40% of GDP. The consolidated fiscal budget, including the off-budget \nexpenditures of the DBM, was 11.6% of GDP in 2014. \n15 The central bank loosened the monetary stance and embarked on the provision of programs of quasi-fiscal policy \nloans to support diverse sectors in the economy in 2012\u20132014. The largest program, the Price Stabilization \nProgram,  provided  highly  subsidized  loans  that  were  exempt  from  limits  on  large  exposure  and  industry \nconcentration, and kept off-budget. \n16 Parliament temporarily increased the fiscal deficit ceiling from 2% to 5% of GDP in 2015, followed by a gradual \nreduction to 4% (2016), 3% (2017), and 2% (2018 onwards). Similarly, the amended FSL lifted the debt ceiling \nfrom 40% of GDP (in net present value) to 58.3% in 2015, followed by a gradual reduction to 55% (2016), 50% \n(2017), and 40% (2018 onwards). \n ", "4 \nthey are needed most. This would slow the government\u2019s poverty reduction efforts. Thus, policy \nactions must be developed to ensure social welfare funding in order to protect the vulnerable \nand the poor during the country\u2019s adjustment program. \n \n16.  Government efforts, ADB\u2019s policy dialogue, and development coordination. ADB \nhas been at the forefront of social protection reform in Mongolia since 2001, focusing on \n17\nexpanding the scope and quality of social networks, poverty targeting, and health insurance.  \nADB  has  been  particularly  active  in  reforming  the  social  welfare  system,  including  the \nintroduction of PMT to target the poor, the establishment of the Food Stamp Program, and the \npassage of the amended Social Welfare Law in January 2013. ADB supports the government\u2019s \nstrategic vision to further modernize the social welfare system through improved targeting, \n18\nconsolidation of benefits, and financial sustainability.  Social protection is a pillar of ADB\u2019s \ninclusive  growth  strategy.  Other  partners  involved  in  the  sector  are  the  World  Bank,  the \nGovernment of Japan through the Japan International Cooperation Agency, and United Nations \n19\nagencies.  The  program  has  been  prepared  in  close  coordination  with  key  development \npartners.  The  program  supports  the  International  Monetary  Fund\u2019s  recommendation  to \nstrengthen safety nets during the adjustment process to protect the poor and improve the \ntargeting of benefits.20 \n \n17.  ADB\u2019s value addition. ADB will introduce reforms in fiscal policy management and \nsocial welfare that (i) address the immediate need to sustain social welfare programs and \nprotect  the  poor  during  the  implementation  of  the  CMAP,  and  (ii)  help  strengthen  sector \nmechanisms to ensure the sustainability and impact of social welfare programs in the future. \nPolicy actions have been selected based on international best practice and sector analyses. \nADB\u2019s strength lies in its experience and deep policy engagement in the sector since 2001 \nthrough three successive policy-based programs (footnote 17). This program will (i) build on the \npolicy dialogue and reforms achieved earlier, (ii) expand the use of the targeting database \ncreated  under  the  Food  and  Nutrition  Social  Welfare  Program,  and  (iii)  support  the \n21\nimplementation of the policy actions with technical assistance from an ongoing ADB project.  \nThis integrated response linking programs and developing capacity will support the creation of a \nstronger and more sustainable safety net for the future. \n \n18.  Alignment with ADB strategy and lessons learned. The program is consistent with \nADB\u2019s  interim  country  partnership  strategy  for  Mongolia,  2014\u20132016,  which  highlights \n22\nsustainable growth and inclusive social development as its main pillars.  It is also in line with \n                                                \n17 ADB. 2001.

The Social Welfare Support Program builds on lessons learned from earlier economic \ncrises and past assistance in the sector. Key lessons on containing the poverty impacts of \nprevious crises include the importance of (i) strengthening and implementing social protection \nsystems and welfare programs, and (ii) investing foreign aid to expand social protection in \n25\ncountries with limited fiscal space.  A major lesson from ADB\u2019s intervention in the sector is the \nneed  to  have  sustained  engagement  because  reforming  social  welfare  requires  long-term \ncommitment. While ADB past operations have been successful introducing poverty targeting \nmechanisms to distribute welfare benefits and establishing the Food Stamp Program, less \n26\nprogress has been achieved in terms of welfare program\u2019s consolidation.  Another key lesson \nis the need for a realistic policy framework with manageable policy actions to  achieve the \nintended results and successfully implement the reforms. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n20.  The impact will be the mitigation of the adverse effects of fiscal consolidation on the \npoor. The outcome will be the maintenance of social welfare programs. \n \nC.  Outputs \n21.  The outputs will be (i) improved fiscal policy management, and (ii) improved policies and \nregulations to support targeting and consolidation of social welfare programs. The program will \nsupport a policy framework with corresponding outputs and policy actions, as detailed in the \npolicy matrix (Appendix 4). The first tranche of the program has 11 policy actions; the second \ntranche has 7 policy actions. \n \n22.  Output 1: Improved fiscal policy management. The program aims to improve fiscal \npolicy management in order to maintain social welfare during the fiscal consolidation process. \nPolicy actions to restore fiscal stability include amendments to the FSL to gradually reduce the \nfiscal deficit and public debt ceilings by 2018, and amendments to the 2015 fiscal budget to \nreduce fiscal expenditures to comply with the requirements of the revised FSL. Policy actions to \nimprove budget transparency include (i) consolidating budgetary expenditures of the DBM under \nthe  state  budget  to  eliminate  off-budget  spending,  (ii)  terminating  the  Price  Stabilization \nProgram to reduce quasi-fiscal operations in the central bank, and (iii) making effective the \nBudget Transparency Law to strengthen public financial management. A draft legislation is in \nthe Parliament to establish a wealth sovereign fund, once approved it will help to mitigate the \nimpact of future swings in commodity prices and FDI inflows. The government has adopted a \nmedium-term  debt  management  strategy  to  strengthen  debt  sustainability.  Improved  fiscal \nmanagement will help protect the most vulnerable by (i) increasing funding for the Food Stamp \n                                                \n23 ADB. 2008.

However,  the  Parliament\u2019s  approval  of  necessary  legislation  was \npostponed as Mongolia was fighting a severe balance-of-payments crisis where other reforms were prioritized. As \nsuch, the intended targets were not met during the life of the program. Details are in ADB. 2013. Completion \nReport: Social Sectors Support Program in Mongolia.

Output  2:  Improved  policies  and  regulations  to  support  targeting  and \nconsolidation  of  social  welfare  programs.  To  strengthen  poverty  targeting,  a  cabinet \nresolution will be issued to require at least two ministries to use the poverty-targeted integrated \nhousehold information database to allocate benefits in selected programs. Resources will be \nallocated in the 2016 budget for maintaining and updating the database to capture the new poor \nresulting from the economic stabilization and adjustment process. To increase social welfare \neffectiveness, a working group of ministries will be established to prepare a plan to consolidate \nsocial welfare programs. Consolidation will reduce administrative and implementation costs, as \nwell  as  the  duplication  of  benefits.  The  program  will  ensure  funding  for  the  quarterly \nimplementation of the household socioeconomic survey to strengthen monitoring and evaluation \nof social protection. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n24.  The government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $150  million from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the program. The loan will be disbursed in two tranches. The first \ntranche of $100 million will be disbursed upon loan effectiveness as the first tranche policy \nactions have been satisfactorily completed. The second tranche will disburse $50 million upon \nachievement of the second tranche policy actions. \n \n25.  The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, an annual interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility, and a commitment charge of 0.15% per year. The average loan maturity is 12.1 years \nand no maturity premium is payable to ADB. The government has provided ADB with (i) the \nreasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility based on these \nterms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any advice from ADB. \n \n26.  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange cost (excluding local \ntaxes  and  duties)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding \nineligible items and imports on the negative list attached to the loan agreement. The proceeds \nof  the  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  simplification  of  disbursement \nprocedures and related requirements for policy-based loans.27 \n \n27.  Current revenue shortages stemming from external shocks constrain the financing of the \ncountry\u2019s  development  needs.  The  stringent  fiscal  consolidation  program  adopted  by  the \n28\ngovernment to comply with the FSL has also limited public spending.  The government is \ncommitted reducing the fiscal deficit to 5.0% of GDP in 2015 from 11.6% in 2014. This suggests \na major adjustment during an economic slowdown and an unfavorable external environment, \nwhich could threaten the sustainability of inclusive growth. As a result, the budget was amended \nin January 2015 to reduce expenditures by 7.3% from initial projections. Most cuts were in \ncapital expenditure to preserve social spending in order to protect the poor. \n \n28.  However, the consolidation of the DBM budgetary activities and the Price Stabilization \nProgram  in  the  central  government  budget  has  added  about  MNT1.2  trillion  for  capital \n                                                \n27 ADB. 1998.

Given the severity of the revenue shortages, in \naddition to new reductions in capital expenditure that will further depress GDP growth and \nemployment generation, social welfare programs will have to be curtailed. This may reverse \nsignificant gains in poverty reduction. \n \n29.  The program will support the government\u2019s fiscal adjustment plan, while protecting the \nbasic needs of the poor. In determining the loan size, consideration was given to the importance \nof  supporting  (i)  the government\u2019s macroeconomic  and fiscal stabilization  program, (ii)  the \ncountry\u2019s development financing needs, and (iii) social welfare programs to alleviate adjustment \ncosts on the poor. The loan proceeds will help close about 58% of the fiscal gap in 2015, \nwhereas loans from other bilateral and multilateral institutions will cover the remaining deficit, in \ncompliance with the FSL\u2019s target of 5.0% of GDP. Without foreign assistance, the 2015 fiscal \ndeficit would be 7.1% of GDP. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n30.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the  executing  agency,  overseeing  and \ncoordinating  the  timely  implementation  of  the  policy  actions.  The  MPDSP  will  be  the \nimplementing agency. A program steering committee, comprising senior representatives from \nthe MOF and MPDSP, will be set up and chaired by the MOF secretary. The committee will meet \nquarterly to monitor progress under the program. ADB will assess program implementation \nthrough periodic progress reports submitted by the MOF, and will field missions to confirm the \nfulfillment of policy actions for tranche releases. ADB and the World Bank will closely coordinate \nto ensure no overlap or duplication of activities during program implementation. The program \nwill be implemented over 19 months from 1 December 2014 to 31 December 2016. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic \n31.  The program will fund short-term revenue shortages, which, if unaddressed, would result \nin significant cuts in welfare programs in 2015. These cuts would disproportionally affect the \nexisting poor and push more Mongolians into poverty. Cuts in the social welfare budget will \nseverely affect the poorest as many depend heavily on benefits for daily subsistence. The \nprogram will substantially mitigate the adverse impact of the fiscal consolidation program on the \npoorest. In particular, the 80% increase in the budget for the Food Stamp Program will expand \nthe benefit by 30% and the number of household beneficiaries by 75%. \n \n32.  Under the ADB-financed program, policy actions to improve targeting and consolidate \nwelfare  programs  will  make  those  programs  more  effective  and  fiscally  sustainable.  The \nimplementation of the proposed reforms will also help the government (i) adjust social benefits \nannually for inflation to maintain the purchasing power of real incomes; and (ii) raise benefit \nlevels, particularly of the poorest, without increasing the fiscal burden. Given the importance of \nsocial transfers on the poor\u2019s income in Mongolia, the reforms will underpin poverty reduction \nefforts. Improved poverty targeting means the nonpoor will be dropped as beneficiaries in \nprograms that are currently targeted by category, particularly welfare programs that are merit \nbased instead of needs based (i.e., allowances for the elderly with merit, which largely accrue to \nthe well-off). However, as the overall amount is not substantial for nonpoor recipients, their loss \nof income will be marginal. \n \n ", "8 \nB.  Governance \n33.  Public  financial  management. Pro-cyclical fiscal management and misalignment of \npublic  expenditure  and  strategic  priorities  are  two  major  public  financial  management \nchallenges.  To  provide  strategic  guidance  for  the  annual  budget  process  and  reduce \nvulnerability to the boom\u2013bust economic cycle, the Government of Mongolia introduced a 3-\nyear, medium-term budget framework in 2003. However, this has not been effective because of \npoor windfall revenue management and frequent amendments affecting budget expenditure. In \naddition to greater countercyclical fiscal discipline, budget preparation and public expenditure \nneed to be better aligned with policy priorities. Nevertheless, the medium-term fiscal framework, \nlinked to the amended FSL, appears credible. The comprehensiveness of information included \nin the budget, its public disclosure, and citizen participation have improved. However, recent \nincreases in off-budget expenditures and the limited oversight of fiscal risks in state-owned \nenterprises, particularly the DBM, undermine this progress.29 \n \n34.  The program contains measures to mitigate the public financial management challenges, \nincluding policy actions to promote compliance with the FSL and the effectiveness of the Budget \nTransparency Law. These will strengthen fiscal discipline by reducing the pro-cyclical nature of \nfiscal policy and by increasing the transparency of public entities and their financial reporting \nand auditing standards. \n \n35.  Public  procurement.  The  procurement  system  has  strong  legal  and  regulatory \nfoundations. However, ensuring the proper implementation of laws, regulations, and procedures \nhas been challenging. Procurement risks include (i) a lack of capacity and transparency; (ii) \nweak  compliance  and  enforcement;  and  (iii)  poor  planning,  evaluation,  and  contract \nmanagement. \n \n36.  Corruption. Corruption is a major challenge in Mongolia. The government's legal, policy, \nand institutional framework and capacity remain inadequate to contain widespread corruption in \nnational and sector systems. Major corruption risks include weak institutions and enforcement, \nlack  of  capacity  of  integrity  institutions,  political  interference,  lack  of  transparency  and \naccountability, and the prevalence of conflicts of interest. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n37.  While official labor market data does not yet reflect the economic slowdown,  other \n30\nindicators, such as the depreciation of the currency and the consumer price index,  point to \nprotracted  stress  on  household  budgets.  Studies  on  the  impacts  of  the  financial  crisis  in \nMongolia in 2009 found that all income groups, but especially the poor, felt the impacts through \ndeclining  job  opportunities,  lower  incomes,  and  rising  prices  for  imported  foods.  Reducing \nconsumption and increasing reliance on credit and social welfare benefits were among the most \ncommon coping strategies. The impact evaluation of the Food Stamp Program determined that \nit is a significant safety net for the poor, helping to ensure food consumption and reduce \nnegative coping strategies. \n \n38.  The program will have a positive impact on poverty and social issues. The expansion of \nthe food stamp benefit rate and coverage will help to ensure that an adequate safety net \n                                                \n29 Public Financial Management Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 The consumer price index was 7.5% year-on-year in May 2015. \n ", "9 \nresponsive  to the  impact  of the  adjustment  process  is  put  in  place. Policy  measures  that \npromote sustainability and expand the use of PMT targeting across other welfare benefits will \nstrengthen the social welfare system by supporting the prioritization of available resources and \nassistance based on demonstrated need. Previous economic crises have demonstrated that \n31\ncuts  in  government  spending  on  social  services  profoundly  disadvantage  women.  The \nprogram\u2019s overall goal of ensuring spending for social welfare during the implementation of \nCMAP will have a positive impact on women. In addition, the program ensures that the updating \nof the targeting database includes capacity to disaggregate data by sex, and that the working \ngroup established to analyze options and impacts of social welfare programs\u2019 consolidation \nincludes a gender analysis.  \n \nD.  Safeguards \n39.  Program activities are confined to policy reforms. None of the policy actions will result in \n32\nor lead to involuntary resettlement or adversely affect indigenous peoples.  Benefits will accrue \nto all Mongolians. No adverse environmental impacts have been identified. The program is \ncategorized C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n40.  The integrated benefits and impacts of the program are expected to outweigh the costs. \nDespite some political instability and the mixed results of previous policy-based operations in \nsocial  welfare  (footnote  26),  the  program  is  justified  to  address  the  urgent  needs  of  the \nvulnerable and the poor in Mongolia. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in \nTable 2 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.33 \n \nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nPolitical instability, including the possibility of  Continued engagement with the government, \nearly elections, paralyze the reform program  including the Asian Development Bank (ADB) top \nmanagement intervention, and close coordination \nwith development partners. \nPrices of mineral resources plummet beyond  Given the country\u2019s vulnerability to external shocks, \nexpectations, sharply reducing government fiscal  a deterioration of the external environment beyond \nrevenue  expectations would require additional resources to \nensure the effectiveness of the program. \nWeak public financial management  The effectiveness of the Budget Transparency Law, \na policy condition under the program, will \nstrengthen public financial management by \nincreasing the transparency of public entities\u2019 \nfinancial transactions reporting and auditing \nstandards. \nCapacity limitations could constrain the  Ongoing related technical assistance by ADB and \nimplementation of the technical aspects of the  the World Bank will strengthen capacity in poverty \nproposed reforms  targeting and welfare programs consolidation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n                                                \n31 United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. 2008.

In less than a year, the\nGovJrnment has pursued decisive reforms to strengthen rTlacroeconomio  stiability uritl-r a\nfocus on fiscal consolidation. Early in the year, the Government preparerd a far-rear:hinrg\nplan to address economic instability, the Comprehensive Macroeconomic; Adjustment\nitrogram (CMAP).
