The project will develop \na  sanitary  landfill  that  meets  international  standards,  rehabilitate  transfer  stations,  and \nmodernize  the  waste  collection  and  transfer  fleet.  It  will  build  capacity  in  waste  management \nand help formulate a national strategy on solid waste management.2  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nUzbekistan\u2019s  robust  economy,  rising  population,  and  accelerating  urbanization  are \ncreating  new  development  challenges.  One  is  to  replace  aging  infrastructure  and  dramatically \nimprove municipal services, including SWM. Increasingly, urban expansion is exerting pressure \non the living environment. Worsening pollution is causing environmental and health challenges \nfor the nation\u2019s towns and cities and affecting their growth prospects. \n \n4. \nUzbekistan generates over 12,000 tons of municipal solid waste (MSW) daily or over 4 \nmillion  tons  annually.  This  generation  rate  is  expected  to  accelerate  to  over  7  million  tons \nannually  by  2030,  for  a  cumulative  MSW  amount  over  this  period  of  about  100  million  tons.3 \nExisting MSW collection services depend on aging and inefficient vehicles that collect MSW and \ntransfer  it  directly  to  un-engineered  and  unsanitary  dumpsites,  where  it  is  dumped  and  left \nexposed.4 In some cases, MSW is not collected by municipal systems at all, but instead is either \nburned or illegally dumped on vacant lots and waterways. Although rudimentary SWM systems \nexist in the major urban areas of Tashkent, they are poorly equipped to meet current and future \ndemand. Elsewhere in Tashkent, MSW services are sporadic or nonexistent. Outside Tashkent, \nMSW  recycling  efficiency  is  extremely  low,  as  formal  environmental  awareness  and  recycling \nprograms are largely absent. In rural areas, MSW collection efficiency is estimated at less than \n50%.  Nationwide,  illegal  dumping  causes  considerable  environmental  damage  to  land,  air, \nsurface waters, and groundwater resources, as well as on the health and well-being of nearby \npopulations.  \n \nNational  SWM  challenges  are  fully  recognized  by  the  government,  which  recently \n5. \nmobilized significant resources to improve SWM services throughout the country.5 SWM improvement is \nconsistent with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy (CPS), 2012\u2013\n2016 for  Uzbekistan,  which prioritizes  replacing aging  infrastructure  and improving  the quality, \ncoverage, and climate resilience of SWM and other municipal services.6 SWM investments proposed in \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.  ADB.  2011.  Technical \nAssistance to the Republic of Uzbekistan for Preparing the Solid Waste Management Improvement Project. Manila. \n3  To put this in perspective, 100 million tons of MSW would cover Tashkent\u2019s 335 square kilometers to a depth of 60 \n\ncentimeters. \n\n4  The State Committee for Nature Protection counts 178 registered dumpsites throughout Uzbekistan and believes \n\nthere are several hundred additional unregistered dumpsites. \n\n5  Major  investments  nationwide  in  SWM  equipment  are  provided  through  Presidential  Decree  10.4.  Recently,  138 \n\nwaste collection vehicles were acquired for Tashkent\u2019s SWM system. \n\n6  ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: Uzbekistan, 2012\u20132016. Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nthe  country  operations  business  plan  (COBP),  2012\u20132014  for  Uzbekistan  align  fully  with  the \nimmediate objective of developing basic urban infrastructure to support economic growth.7 \n \n6. \nWhile recognizing SWM needs nationwide, the government has as its immediate priority \nrehabilitating Tashkent\u2019s SWM system. SWM demands in Tashkent are growing rapidly, as the \ncity\u2019s  population  of  2.3  million  currently  generates  over  0.5  million  tons  annually,  an  amount \nexpected to increase to over 0.7 million tons annually by 2030, and with cumulative generation \nfrom 2013 to 2030 reaching more than 10 million tons. The current system has served the city \nsince 2006 and needs immediate and complete rehabilitation to avert potentially serious service \ndisruptions. Most of the city\u2019s 700 MSW collection points require restoration, its MSW collection \nand transfer vehicle fleets urgently require replacement, and its transfer stations require major \noverhauls.  Tashkent\u2019s  current  practices  to  control  dumping  need  to  be  replaced  with  modern \nsanitary  landfilling  that  meets  internationally  recognized  standards.  Significant  opportunities \nexist to introduce and expand waste minimization and recycling initiatives citywide, dramatically \nimprove  system  operational  efficiency,  and  strengthen  the  capacity  of  institutions  involved  in \nSWM service provision. \n \n7. \nThe  Tashkent  SWM  system  is  operated  and  maintained  by  Maxsustrans,  a  chartered \nstate  unitary  enterprise  wholly  owned  by  the  Municipality  of  Tashkent  (Municipality)  and \nestablished  pursuant  to  a  1988  decision  and  decree  of  the  Municipality.  With  a  staff  of  1,969 \npersonnel, 685 of them female, the company operates the entire municipal SWM system for the \ncity\u2019s  11  districts  and  the  adjacent  city  of  Chirchik.  This  includes  about  700  waste  collection \npoints,  329  waste  collection  vehicles,  three  transfer  stations,  a  waste  transfer  fleet,  and  the \nAkhangaran  disposal facility  located  to the  southeast  of the  city. While  Maxsustrans  has  been \noperating  the  SWM  system  since  inception,  its  institutional  capacity  is  weak  (a  detailed \ndiscussion  in  para.  23).  The  project  will  strengthen  Maxsustrans\u2019  capacity  in  technical  and \nadministrative areas through a capacity development program. \n \nThe  project  fully  supports  the  government\u2019s  priority  of  improving  Tashkent\u2019s  SWM \n8. \nsystem  through  an  investment  package  to  accelerate  waste  minimization  and  recycling \ninitiatives, upgrade and rehabilitate the city\u2019s MSW collection and transfer systems, and develop \na new sanitary landfill facility (SLF) to serve the city at least until 2060. Concurrently, it will help \nthe government to develop a national SWM strategy and investment program to guide national \nSWM  sector  improvements  over  the  medium  term.  The  project  supports  the  government\u2019s \nrecent proposals to progressively increase private sector involvement in SWM,8 reduce carbon \nemissions, and improve air quality. \n\n \n9. \nThis  project  is  ADB\u2019s  first  investment  in  the  SWM  area  of  Uzbekistan.  Nevertheless, \nlessons  from  previous  ADB-assisted  projects  in  Uzbekistan  showed  that  turnover  of  project \nimplementation  unit  (PIU)  staff  was  high  due  to  poor  compensation  and  delays  in  salary \npayments,  particularly  by  local  governments.  Therefore,  the  proposed  ADB  loan  will  finance \nsuch PIU expenditures and recurrent costs under the project.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe impact will be an improved urban environment and quality of life for the residents of \n\n10. \nTashkent. The outcome will be improved SWM services and management in Tashkent. \n \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2012.

Manila. \n8  The  government  plans  to  prioritize  assistance  to  the  informal  recycling  subsector  in  Tashkent  and  is  currently \n\nassessing innovative options to outsource waste collection to the private sector. \n\n\fOutputs \n\nC. \n \n11. \nOutput  1:  Rehabilitated  and  expanded  solid  waste  management  system  in \nTashkent. By project completion, it is expected that (i) transfer stations will be rehabilitated and \nan  existing  transfer  station  possibly  closed, 9 (ii)  3  million  tons  of  disposal  capacity  will  be \nestablished in a landfill that meets international environmental standards, and (iii) 1,950 tons per \nday of disposal operational capacity will be established. \n \nOutput 2: Strengthened operational capacity. The project will develop the capacity of \n12. \nMaxsustrans  and  support  sector  improvements  in  three  key  areas:  (i)  waste  minimization  and \nrecycling  program  development;  (ii)  the  formulation  of  a  parallel  media  and  public  awareness \nprogram about waste minimization and recycling; and (iii) operational and management support \nfor SWM operations including a logistics study.  \n \n13. \nOutput  3:  National  solid  waste  management  strategy.  The  project  will  assist  the \ngovernment in developing, under the coordination of the State Committee for Nature Protection \n(SCNP), a national SWM strategy, including a sector investment program for 2014\u20132030.  \n \nD. \n \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $76.0  million  equivalent  (Table  1).

The  SLF  will  have  the  potential  to  progressively  expand  to  serve \nTashkent province over the long term. The proposed SLF is a stand-alone facility with a service \nlife  span  to  2060.  It  is  designed  to  be  self-sustainable  with  its  initial  development  phase \nproviding 5\u20137 years of service, which will provide ample time for the government to decide on \nSWM  in  Tashkent  over  the  longer  term  while  being  assured  of  an  operational  system  in  the \ninterim. The 30-hectare site was selected after an extensive survey. \n  \nThe  project  includes  the  necessary  upgrading  and  refurbishment  of  the  entire  MSW \n19. \ncollection  and  transport  system  in  Tashkent.  Collection  points  will  be  equipped  with  suitable \nwaste  bins  and the capacity  to  collect  and  segregate recyclable materials.  Outdated  collection \n\n \n\n\fvehicles will be replaced with more efficient collection vehicles, significantly reducing operation \nand  maintenance  costs.  A  full  logistical  assessment  of  truck  movement  will  ensure  that  an \neffective transport logistics system is in place. Transfer stations will be equipped with improved \ninfrastructure  and  electro-mechanical  components  for  compaction  and  control,  and  existing \ntransfer vehicles will be replaced.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe economic viability of the project was assessed from the national perspective on the \n20. \nbenefits  of  maintaining  an  improved  SWM  system  for  Tashkent.  This  includes  constructing  a \nnew SLF at Akhangaran, built and operated according to accepted international standards, and \nsupport  for  waste  segregation  and  recycling  over  an  economic  life  of  25  years.  The  project  is \neconomically viable, as the economic internal rate of return of 17.4% in the base case exceeds \nthe  assumed  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12.0%.  Sensitivity  analysis  shows  the \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  more  sensitive  to  increased  capital  costs  than  to  increased \noperation and maintenance costs or reduced benefits from recycling.  \n \n21. \nFinancial  analysis,  conducted  from  the  perspective  of  Maxsustrans,  the  organization \nresponsible  for  SWM  in  Tashkent,  shows  that  the  project  is  financially  viable,  with  a  financial \ninternal  rate  of  return  of  6.8%.  This  compares  favorably  with  the  estimated  weighted  average \ncost of capital of 1.2%. The financial analysis assumes that the capital expenditure is necessary \nto ensure that Maxsustrans can continue to operate as a going concern, with benefits valuated as \nthe  revenue  generated  using  current  tariffs.  Improved  efficiency  is  assumed  from  the \nrehabilitation  and  rationalization  of  the  SWM  system  supported  through  the  PIU  and \ncapacity development funded by the project. Sensitivity analysis shows that the profitability of \nMaxsustrans  is  relatively  robust  against  increased  capital  investment  costs  and  operation \nand maintenance costs but sensitive to reduced revenue. The company\u2019s ability to increase \ntariffs  with  the  consent  of  the  central  government  and  the  Municipality  should  enable  it  to \nmaintain sufficient profitability in the future to meet its operating expenditure and provide for \ncapital asset renewal.  \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n22. \nThe government\u2019s public administration reform program is evolving through a number of \nphases:  (i)  reducing  state  influence  in  the  economy;  (ii)  reducing  command  elements  in  the \nadministrative  system;  (iii)  restructuring  government  agencies;  (iv)  transitioning  to  market \nmechanisms with the gradual phasing out of the planned system of public service provision; and \n(v) making government activities more transparent. Nevertheless, governance remains an issue. \n \n23. \nIn  the  legislative,  regulatory,  and  policy  framework,  new  or  evolving  laws  and  decrees \ntend to overlap and become complicated. The lack of integration undermines enforcement and \nframework  effectiveness,  and  thus  its  coordination.12 Institutional  weaknesses  weaken  communication \nbetween key financial and line ministries, and skills training is needed to improve organizational \nability  to  provide  efficient  public  services.  The  government\u2019s  financial  management  reform \nprogram 2007\u20132018 has yet to be fully implemented and financial management remains largely \ncentralized.  Responsibility  for  preparing  and  implementing  capital  investment  and  recurrent \nbudgets  is  divided.  As  the  public  procurement  system  is  regulated  by  several  laws,  directives, \nand measures, it lacks clarity, transparency, and coordination. A major obstacle to transparent \n\n                                                \n12 ADB.  2011.  Uzbekistan-Consolidated  Governance  Risk  Assessment  and  Risk  Mitigation  Plan  Covering  National \n\nLevel and the Energy, Urban and Transportation Sectors. Manila. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fA \n\nfinancial  management  assessment  concluded \n\nprocurement  has  been  the  process  of  verifying  the  prices  of  winning  tenders.  Approval  of  the \nnational  plan  for  fighting  corruption  is  pending.  A  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan \nhas been prepared for the project to mitigate the negative impact of these issues.  \n \nthe  Tashkent  municipal \n24. \nadministration  and  Maxsustrans  currently  satisfy  ADB\u2019s  financial  management  requirements.13 \nThe city administration and Maxsustrans have satisfactory financial management capability to (i) record \nrequired financial transactions and balances; (ii) provide regular and reliable financial statements and \nmonitoring  reports;  (iii)  safeguard  financial  assets;  and  (iv)  submit  the  required  financial \ndocuments to auditors with arrangements acceptable to ADB. \n \n25. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  SCNP,  the  Municipality  and  Maxsustrans.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \n\nthat \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n \n26. \nBy upgrading Tashkent\u2019s SWM system, the project will respond to the immediate SWM \nneeds  of  the  2.32  million  residents  of  the  city.  This  will  address  existing  unsanitary  conditions \nbrought  about  by  SWM  inadequacies  in  Tashkent  and  thereby  improve  health,  hygiene,  and \nsanitation conditions for all city residents, including the poor and socially excluded. Women, who \nare  mainly  responsible  for  household  waste  management,  will  benefit  from  cleaner  collection \npoints and more regularized waste pickup services. Support for increased household recycling \nin the form of collection point bins, media campaigns, and the development of a waste reduction \nand  recycling  strategy  will  improve  the  incomes  of  collection  point  operators  and  extend  the \nuseful  life  of  the  new  SLF.  The  project  will  provide  training  through  women\u2019s  committees  and \nneighborhood  representatives  in  waste  recycling  practices  and  promotion.  The  involvement  of \nnational  and  municipal  women\u2019s  committees  in  the  development  of  recycling  strategies  and \nmedia  campaigns  will  enable  these  organizations  to  deliver  these  messages  to  their \ncommunities. Local labor regulations prohibit exploitive labor practices, including the use of child \nlabor.  There  are  no  labor  issues  in  the  SWM  sector.  The  project  loan  documents  include \ncovenants on adherence to core labor standards. \n \nE. \n \n27. \nEnvironmental  safeguards.  The  project  is  category  B  for  environment  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS) 2009. An initial environmental examination (IEE) \nwas  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  SPS  and  government  guidelines.  The  IEE  includes  the \nenvironmental audit compliance report for existing facilities, and an environmental management \nplan  (EMP)  including  corrective  actions  for  existing  facilities.  The  IEE  shows  the  potential \nenvironmental  impacts  of  the  project  include  (i)  dust  emissions  from  construction  of  the  SLF, \ntransfer stations and garages; (ii) the potential generation of odors; (iii) the potential attraction of \nvermin; (iv) noise from increased vehicular traffic, construction, and mechanical equipment such \nas pumps and compressors; and (v) associated occupational health and safety hazards. Such \nimpacts are manageable, and the EMP has properly addressed them. The corrective measures \nrequired for existing facilities recommended by the environmental audit compliance report have \nbeen incorporated into the EMP. Public consultation on the IEE findings was conducted on 11 \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n13 The financial management assessment followed ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management \nof  Projects  Financed  by  ADB  (2002).  The  instrument  used  for  assessment  was  ADB\u2019s  standard  financial \nmanagement assessment questionnaire. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nApril  2013.  The  IEE  was  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  on  7  August  2013.  Under  Uzbekistan \nlegislation,14 the project is category 1, requiring that a statement of the ecological expertise be \nobtained  from  SCNP. 15 Maxsustrans  has  agreed  to  ensure  that  the  EMP  and  all  corrective \nmeasures for  existing facilities  are  strictly  implemented,  and  during  project  implementation the \nPIU  will  have  an  environmental  specialist  responsible  for  overseeing  EMP  implementation. \nMaxsustrans will designate a unit within its organization to handle all environmental concerns of \nSWM, including the implementation of the EMP, implementation of any corrective measures for \nexisting facilities, and closure of existing facilities as necessary. \n \n28. \nThe project component on strengthening operational capacity will not have any physical \nfootprint,  so  no  environmental  impact  is  expected.  This  component  will  nevertheless  include \ncapacity  development  for  Maxsustrans,  including  environmental  management  for  the  project. \nThe preparation of a national SWM strategy will take into account the environmental aspect of \nSWM. \n\n \n29. \nSocial safeguards. The project is category B for involuntary resettlement in accordance \nwith  the  SPS,  as  the  construction  of  the  SLF  requires  acquisition  of  49.9  hectares  of  land, \nincluding 19.9 hectares of agricultural land, and affects one farmer with nine agricultural workers. \nA land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) was prepared in accordance with the SPS and \nrelevant  government  legislation  and  requirements.  Consultations  with  affected  farmers  and \nworkers  and  Yangi  Hayot  Users  Association  (the  local  community  organization  owning  the \nirrigation  canal)  were  conducted  during  LARP  preparation. 16  During  the  consultation  with \naffected people on 11 December 2012, a summary of the draft LARP was discussed. The LARP \nwas disclosed on the ADB website on 7 August 2013.  Maxsustrans will work closely with local \nmunicipality  and  land  cadaster  agency  to  implement  the  LARP.  As  the  closure  of  the  existing \ndumpsite will affect 80\u2013100 unauthorized waste pickers, Maxsustrans will implement a livelihood \nimprovement program, the cost of which is included in LARP implementation costs.  \n \nLARP  implementation  is  estimated  to  cost  $870,000,  which  will  be  covered  by  the \n30. \ngovernment. The Municipality and Maxsustrans will be responsible for implementing the LARP. \nNotice  to  proceed  shall  not  be  given  to  any  contractors  until  the  LARP  has  been  fully \nimplemented.  \n \n The  project  area  has  no  group  of  people  who  maintain  a  separate  cultural  or  social \n31. \nidentity  from  mainstream  Uzbekistan  society  that  would  classify  them  as  ethnic  group,  ethnic \nminority, or indigenous peoples as described in the SPS. Therefore, in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSPS, the project is category C with regard to indigenous peoples. \n \nF. \n \n32.  Major project risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 17 The  project  does  not  have  any \nunusual technical risks. The project\u2019s integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh \ncosts and risks. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n                                                \n14 National legislation of the Republic of Uzbekistan on Ecological Expertise enacted in 2000. \n15 Prior  to  construction  and  prior  to  operation,  the  statement  of  ecological  expertise  will  be  obtained  from  SCNP. \nThese statements basically contain requirements and recommendations for construction, operation, and monitoring \necological aspects of the projects.      \n\n16 At  least  four  consultations  with  affected  people  and  relevant  parties  were  carried  out  from  November  2012  to \n\nDecember 2012. \n\n17 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\nRisks \nInadequate PIU \nprocurement capacity  \n\nDelays in \nprocurement \n\nLack of involvement \nof civil society \norganizations \n\nPoor quality of \ndesign standards \n\nPoor management \nand internal and \nexternal audit polices \n\nTable 4: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nThe Municipality establishes the PIU and recruits a project management \nconsultant, who will assist the PIU in managing project implementation.  \nThe PIU includes positions for international and national procurement \nspecialists.
