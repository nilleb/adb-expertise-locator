These \nachievements are remarkable, as they resulted from public action \nof  a  democratically  elected  state  government  and  conscious civil \nsociety.  However,  chronic  and  acute  fiscal  stress  due  to  the \nstate's  mounting  debt  burden  over  the  last  decade  has  severely \nrecent \nthreatened \nparticipatory  poverty  assessment  carried  out  in  Kerala  identified \nfiscal stress as undermining the state's capacity to steer pro-poor \ngrowth.  The  assessment  highlighted  some  challenges  facing  the \nKerala  government  in  its  mission  to  eradicate  poverty:  lack  of \neconomic  opportunity,  weaknesses  in  targeting  programs  for  the \npoor, and deteriorating health and education quality.  \n  \nthe  Modernizing \nThe  Kerala  government  has \nGovernment  Program  (MGP)  and  entered  into  two  agreements \nwith  the  central  Government  to  address  the  fiscal  crisis  and \nundertake  structural  reforms,  including  in  the  power  sector.  The \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  Government  of  the \nNetherlands will provide technical and financial assistance to help \nthe Kerala government implement its reforms.  \n \nThe  Program  will  contribute  to  the  Kerala  government's  poverty \nreduction  and  development  strategy  contained  in  the  Tenth  Five-\nYear  Plan  (2002\u20132007)  and  MGP.  The  Program  is  designed \naround four themes and results:  \n\nthese  achievements'  sustainability.  The \n\nformulated \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nAchieve  fiscal  sustainability,  including  initial  policy \nactions to enable power sector reform.  \nImprove the quality, equity, and value for money of \nservices  provided  by  the  state  government  and \nlocal self-governments (LSGs). \nImprove  the  targeting  and  quality  of  the  poverty \nreduction programs and social services. \nStrengthen the functions and structures of the state \ngovernment  and  LSGs  to  increase  accountability, \nresponsiveness, transparency, and efficiency. \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nFiscal reform includes the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\ncreation  of  an  enabling  environment  for  power \nsector reform,  \nreform of state-level public enterprises (SLPEs),  \nintroduction  of  a  medium-term  fiscal  framework \n(MTFF),  \nimprovement  of  budgeting  and  expenditure \nmanagement, and  \nstrengthening  of \nmobilization.  \n\ntax  and  nontax \n\nrevenue \n\n \nService  delivery  will  focus  on  design  and  implementation  of  an \nintegrated  set  of  policies  on  service  delivery,  social  audit,  and \nasset  renewal.  Poverty  reduction  will  focus  on  strengthening \npoverty  monitoring  and  reporting,  improving  the  quality  and  the \ntargeting  of  subsidies,  and  designing  and  implementing  an \nantipoverty  sub-plan.  Strengthening  of  state  and \nlocal \ngovernments will facilitate decentralization, redeploy surplus state \ngovernment staff, build institutional and human resource capacity, \nand enact laws to make government information readily available \nto the people of Kerala.  \n \nDeveloped  through  extensive  consultation,  the  Program  is  a \nthe  central,  Kerala,  and  Netherlands \npartnership  among \ngovernments and ADB. The Program is based on the fiscal reform \ninitiatives  contained  in  the  agreements  between  the  central  and \nstate  governments,  and  in  Kerala's  MGP.  The  partnership  has  a \ncommon policy matrix and program monitoring arrangement. ADB \nand the Government of the Netherlands have actively participated \nin  the  Kerala  government's  design  process,  and  the  Program \ndraws on the earlier technical assistance (TA) support provided to \nthe  Kerala  government  by  ADB  and  the  Government  of  the \nNetherlands. The design draws on the implementation experience \nand \nresource \nmanagement and power sector programs in Gujarat and Madhya \nPradesh.  \n \nUnder  subprogram  1,  policies  to  achieve  the  program  objectives \nwill  be  established,  with  emphasis  on  implementation,  monitoring \nimpact,  and  establishing  accountability  for  the  new  policies. \nImplementation  will  begin  in  priority  areas  and  scaled  up  after \nreview in subprogram 2. During the midterm review of subprogram \n1, criteria will be developed to prioritize projects for subprogram 2. \nThe prior actions to be taken in the power sector should improve \nthe  financial  health  of  the  Kerala  government  and  create  an \nenabling  environment  for  a  power  sector  development  program. \nThe  Kerala  government  will  plan \nfor \nnonoperational manufacturing SLPEs in subprogram 1.  \n \n \n\nfrom  ADB\u2019s  public  sector \n\nreform  measures \n\nlessons \n\nlearned \n\n\f \n\niii \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPoverty \nClassification \n\nThematic \nClassification \n\nEnvironmental \nClassification \n\nOther \n\n \nCategory C \n\n \nGood governance; human development \n\n \nThe Program Loan  \n \n \n\nAmount and \nTerms \n\nProgram Period \nand Tranching  \n\n \n \n \nThe Program adopts a cluster approach comprising subprograms \n1  and  2  totaling  $300  million.  A  loan  of  $200  million  from ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased  lending  facility  for  subprogram  1.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-\nyear  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee \nof 1.0%, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nLoan Agreement. \n \nThe loan for subprogram 1 will be implemented from October 2002 \nto  September  2004.  Subprogram  2  will  be  prepared  after  the \nmidterm review of subprogram 1. The loan for subprogram 2 will be \npresented for consideration and approval by the ADB Board based \non progress in implementing subprogram 1.  \n \nSubprogram  1  will  provide  loan  resources  equivalent  to  $200 \nmillion  to  be  divided  into  two  equal  tranches;  subprogram  2  will \nprovide loan resources equivalent to $100 million. A parallel grant \nfrom  the  Government  of  the  Netherlands  is  proposed  to  augment \nthe resources of the loan by helping the Kerala government absorb \nthe costs of adjustment under the loan. \n \n\nProcurement  \n\nExecuting Agency   Kerala's Office of the Chief Secretary and the Finance Department \nwill  be  the  program  executing  agencies.  The  MGP  steering \ncommittee,  chaired  by  the  chief  secretary  will  be  responsible  for \noverall  program  coordination,  implementation,  and  monitoring.  A \nCabinet  subcommittee  chaired  by  the  chief  minister  will  provide \nstrategic direction and control.   \n \nThe  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  utilized  to  finance  the  foreign \nexchange  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items \nproduced in, and procured from, ADB\u2019s member countries, other \nthan  those  items  specified  as  ineligible  and  imports  financed  by \nother bilateral and multilateral sources.  \n \nIn  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program \nLoans, the proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed to India \nas  the  Borrower.  No  supporting  import  documentation  will  be \nrequired  if,  during  each  year  that  loan  proceeds  are  expected  to \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCounterpart \nFunds \n\nProgram  Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\nrequired  if,  during  each  year  that  loan  proceeds  are  expected  to \nbe disbursed, the value of India\u2019s total imports minus imports from \nnonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports  financed \nunder other official development assistance is equal to or greater \nthan the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during such \nyear. The central Government, however, will certify its compliance \nwith this formula with each withdrawal request. Otherwise, import \ndocumentation  under  existing  procedures  will  be  required.  ADB \nreserves the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and verify the \naccuracy of the central Government\u2019s certification. Loan proceeds \nmay  be  used  to  finance  eligible  imports  for  which  expenditures \nwere incurred 180 days before the loan becomes effective.   \n \nThe  rupee  counterpart  funds  to  be  generated  out  of  the  loan \nproceeds  will  be  transferred  by  the  central  to  the  Kerala \ngovernment.  The  counterpart  proceeds  will  be  treated  as  an \naddition to the transfers allocated annually from the central to the \nKerala government. \n \nThe  Program  will  enable  the  Kerala  government  to  build  vital \ncapacity  to  identify  and  discourage  wasteful  expenditures  and  to \nredirect  resources  to  program  activities  with  greater  social  and \neconomic benefits. Subprogram 2 will build upon the reforms and \nstrengthened \nunder \nsubprogram 1. Both subprograms are intended to help the Kerala \ngovernment  enhance \nthe  state's  social  and  economic \ndevelopment by increasing accountability and pro-poor outcomes, \nimproving  service  delivery,  and  fostering  sustainability.  Although \nsubprogram 1 will bring improvements, significant benefits will be \nrealized after full implementation of subprograms 1 and 2 as many \nof the initiatives will require 2\u20133 years to implement.  \n \nSubprogram 1 will accomplish the following:   \n\ninstitutional \n\nfoundation \n\ndeveloped \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(iii) \n\ntoward  priority \n\nincluding  off-budget  borrowing, \n\nBegin  to  reduce  the  fiscal  deficit  and  state  debt \nburden, \nto \nsustainable levels.  \nAccount  for  all  liabilities  and  eliminate  off-budget \nborrowing. \nStart  restructuring  expenditures \ndevelopment areas. \nEnhance  resource  mobilization  by  reforming  the \nproperty tax and stamp duty, and introducing value-\nadded tax (VAT). \nCreate  an  environment  to  improve  power  sector \nregulatory \nestablishing \noperations \ncommission.  \nEstablish  an  equitable  framework  for  restructuring \npriority manufacturing SLPEs.  \nImprove  coordination,  targeting,  and  impact  of \npoverty reduction programs and social safety nets. \n(viii)  Establish sound internal  systems of accountability \nfor  service  delivery  results  while  maintaining \n\n(vii) \n\n(vi) \n\n(v) \n\nby \n\na \n\n\f \n\nRisks and \nSafeguards \n\n  v\n\nfor  service  delivery  results  while  maintaining \nsystems  that  mobilize  public  pressure  for  better \nservices through effective social audits. \nPrioritize and target investment for renewing assets \nand  introduce  effective  systems  and  resources for \nthese  assets'  operation  and  maintenance \nto \nimprove  service  delivery,  particularly  in  the  social \nsectors.  \nStrengthen local financial management capacity by \ninstalling reliable budgetary and control systems for \nlocal government. \nBegin  restructuring  the  state  government  to  focus \non  core  functions  and  shed  tasks  that  have  been \ntransferred  to  local  governments  or  are  no  longer \nrequired.  \nIntroduce simplified and more transparent decision-\nmaking processes. \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\n(xiii)  Contain staff costs and create a more effective and \nmotivated  workforce  by  implementing  policies  to \nbuild capacity, and redeploy surplus staff. \n\n(xiv)   Create  an  environment  that  will  give  citizens \n\ngreater access and rights to information. \n\nenforced \n\nresources \n\ninadequate \n\nimplementation, \n\ncivil \nfrom \nunresponsiveness \n\n \nPolicy  and  institutional  reforms,  management  improvement, and \npublic  service  reform  are  all  subject  to  considerable  risk. \nConsequently,  the  Program  will  have  a  risk  management  and \nmitigation  strategy  built  into  program  management.  Risks  within \nthe control of the Program include weaknesses in the design, poor \nfor \nmanagement  of \nimplementation,  and  weak  capacity.  Risks  outside  the  Program, \nwhich  may  be  controllable, \ninclude  sufficiency  of  political \ncommitment  and  agreement,  decision  making  challenges  of \nservants, \ncommitment \ncoalition  government, \ninadequately \nto \nlegislation, \ngovernment orders, and a deteriorating fiscal position. Risks that \nare  uncontrollable  are  mainly  political,  and  public  action  against \nreforms.   \n \nThe program design risks have been addressed by ensuring that \nthe  design  process \nlengthy  and  broad-based \nconsultations  with  the  Kerala  government  over  several  months. \nThe resulting product reflects the Kerala government\u2019s own reform \nagenda.  Second,  MGP  was  subjected  to  extensive  peer  review \nand  consultations  in  India  and  also  draws  on  proposals  arising \nfrom TA and national and state expert committee and commission \nreports.  The  cluster  approach  will  allow  subprogram  2  to  be \ndesigned based on the experience of implementing subprogram 1.  \n \nThe  biggest  risk  comes  from  public  action  against  reform.  Some \ninterest  groups  may  not  support  fiscal  and  structural  reform  in \nKerala  even  though  the  various  measures  have  evolved  through \nextensive discussion and analysis within Kerala. The costs to the \n\ninvolved \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n\nextensive discussion and analysis within Kerala. The costs to the \nstate economy of continuing with status quo policies are not well \nunderstood by these groups. The Kerala government will need to \nunderpin \ntransparent \ncommunication  strategy  that  reaches  out  to  the  various interest \ngroups and secures their commitment.  \n\nthe  Program  with  a  sound  and \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  (i)  proposed \nprogram cluster concept for the Modernizing Government and Fiscal Reform in Kerala Program \nin  India  (the  Program),  (ii)  proposed  loan  to  India  for  subprogram  1  of  the  Program,  and  (iii) \nproposed administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of a grant to be provided by the \nGovernment of the Netherlands for subprogram 1 of the Program. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT  \n\n2. \nThe  fiscal  performance  of  most  Indian  states  has  deteriorated  rapidly  during  the  last \ndecade in large part because rigid administrative procedures and supply-driven approaches to \nservice  delivery  have  made  quick  adjustment  to changing macroeconomic circumstances very \ndifficult. The consolidated fiscal deficit of the central and state governments amounted to 9.6% \nof gross domestic product (GDP) in fiscal year (FY) 2001. The states account for about half of \nthis  deficit.  Real  interest  rate  increases  associated  with  financial  sector  liberalization, \nderegulation of private investment decision making, cumulative impacts of weak regulatory and \nfinancial oversight in power and other utility sectors, and pursuit of populist fiscal policies have \nall contributed to state fiscal deterioration. Civil service and public sector wages have generally \ngrown much faster than the economy over the last 5 years. \n \n3. \nThe growing fiscal imbalances of states have been reflected as a decline in the quality of \nstate  expenditure  patterns  as  nonproductive  expenditures  gradually  replaced  growth-inducing \nand socially productive investments. The consolidated current (revenue) account balance of the \nstates thus shifted from surpluses during the 1980s to substantial deficits during the 1990s. In \nKerala,  widening  fiscal  current  account  deficits  went  along  with  an  increase  in  salary,  interest, \nand  pension  outlay  as  a  percentage  of  revenue  receipts  (from  71.0%  in  FY1996  to  92.5%  in \nFY2001),  while  capital  spending  declined  drastically.  The  Kerala  government  thus  has  greatly \ndiminished resources for discretionary spending, including on programs to ensure that the poor \nhave access to basic services. \n \n4. \nThe  emerging  crisis  of  state  debt  and  expenditure  composition  has  led  the  central \nGovernment to propose a number of important reform initiatives (described in the next section) \nintended  to  reverse  fiscal  decline,  strengthen  regulatory  institutions,  and  improve  expenditure \nallocations.  \n \nKerala\u2019s  macroeconomic  performance  has  been  dominated  over  the  last  5  years  by \n5. \nthree  major  trends:  severe  fiscal  stress;  difficulties  in  adjusting  the  state's  primary  economic \nbase  to  changing  external  circumstances,  including  increased  competition;  and  increased \nreliance  on  foreign  remittances  from  nonresident  workers,  fueling  private  consumption \nexpenditures. The  Kerala  economy  grew  at  an  annual  real  rate  of  5.7%  in  FY1994\u2013FY2001.1 \nOver the same period, real growth rate was 2.2% per annum in the primary sector, 6.1% in the \nsecondary sector, and 7.4% in the tertiary sector. Recent investor surveys rank  the state low in \ninvestment attractiveness. The low levels of foreign direct and aggregate private investment in \nthe state indicate a weak investment climate.  \n \n6. \nDue to deteriorating fiscal performance, the Kerala government has difficulty meeting its \ndevelopmental commitments. Increasing deficits and compression of nonwage and noninterest \nexpenditures  have  led  to  inadequate  infrastructure  investment  and  a  decline  in  operation  and \n\n                                                 \n1   Department of Economics and Statistics, Planning Board, Government of Kerala. 2002 unpublished estimates. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nmaintenance (O&M) allocations that threaten future growth and poverty reduction.  A rising debt \nburden has led to an unsustainable fiscal position requiring a substantial fiscal adjustment. The \nstock of state debt expressed as a percentage of gross state domestic product (GSDP) will rise \nfrom 27.5% in FY1996 to an estimated 37.4% by the end of FY2002.  \n \n7. \nThe  state's  contingent  liability  from  guarantees  extended  to  support  the  debt  stocks  of \npublic enterprises and major utilities, such as the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB), is also \nsubstantially  increasing  at  a  rapid  rate.  The  growth  in  guarantee  size  is  primarily  due  to \ninadequate commitment to cover costs in power, and weak financial control over key state-level \npublic  enterprises  (SLPEs)  and  boards.  The  aggregate  level  of  guarantees  was  equivalent  to \napproximately 15.2% of GSDP by end-March 2002. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance2  \n\nKerala is a small state of 32 million inhabitants, on the west coast of India, and noted for \n8. \nhaving the highest social indicators in the country. The state is also remarkable for its high rate \nof  participation  in  political  life  and  high  indicators  of  social  capital.  Despite  the  state's \noutstanding social accomplishments, Kerala's prospects for prosperity are threatened by chronic \nfiscal stress, manifested in the nondelivery of essential services to the poor and marginalized; \ninadequate  funding  for  new  infrastructure  investment;  inadequate  resources  devoted  to  O&M; \nmounting  arrears  to  contractors,  which  undermine  competitive  procurement;  rising  debt-to-\nGSDP ratio; accumulated and mounting losses of the more than 100 SLPEs; rapidly increasing \nstock  of  loans  to  SLPEs  and  boards  backed  by  guarantees;  and  KSEB's  acute  financial \ndeterioration.  \n \n9. \nPoverty.  The  state  has  made  important  strides  in  reducing  poverty  through  local  self-\ngovernments  (LSGs)  and  the  State  Poverty  Eradication  Mission  called  \u201cKudumbashree.\u201d  The \nKudumbashree  model  of  self-employment  with  community  support  is  based  on  successful \nexperiments  in  urban  and  rural  poverty  initiatives  in  the  1990s  and  organizes  women  from \nhouseholds  below  the  poverty  line  into  a  three-tier  structure  of  self-help  groups  to  tackle  the \nvarious  dimensions  of  poverty.  The  Kerala  government  recently  evaluated  the  Kudumbashree \nmodel  with  assistance  from  the  Netherlands  Government,  and  the  findings  will  be  used  to \nupdate the approach and institutional arrangements to reduce poverty in Kerala.  \n \nA  recent  participatory  poverty  assessment3  identified  major  pockets  of  acute  poverty, \n10. \nconcentrating mainly among fishing communities, tribal households, households of cashew nut \nand coir workers, and communities dependent on seasonal employment. Unemployment among \nthe educated young is a major social concern. The assessment highlighted the very high degree \nof indebtedness among the poor, who rely heavily on informal credit systems with interest rates \nas high as 326% per annum. The declining quality of public health and education threatens past \nachievements and future prospects, and imposes additional costs on the poor.  \n \nService  delivery  to  the  poor  is  constrained  by  weak  targeting  and  prioritizing  of \n11. \nvulnerabilities among the poor. The state's survey of poor households, used to identify program \nbeneficiaries, indicates that 43% of the population lived below the poverty line\u2014far higher than \n\n                                                 \n2   Appendix 1 on Sector Analysis. \n3   ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to India for Participatory Poverty Assessment at the State Level. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3 \n\nthe  official  headcount  poverty  indicator  of  12.7%.4  The  Kerala  government  also  provides  large \nsubsidies  in  agriculture,  rural  development,  housing,  social  welfare,  and  other  sectors.  An \nintegrated  policy  on  subsidies  is  urgently  needed  to  avoid  waste,  inadequate  targeting  of  the \npoor,  and  multiple  agencies  delivering  subsidized  services  with  overlapping  functions  at  the \ngrassroots. Benefit incidence, including for subsidies, needs to be assessed. The budget needs \nto be made into a strong instrument for pro-poor budgeting.  \n \n12. \n \n\nKerala faces four main long-term challenges for an effective poverty reduction strategy:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nIncrease  the  rate  of  economic  growth  while  enhancing  the  conditions  to  allow \nbroad  participation  in  the  benefits  of  growth,  and  avoiding  environmental \ndegradation.  \nEnsure that access to health and education is further broadened and their quality \nimproved within a sustainable financing strategy.  \nFind ways to identify and target the poorest and most excluded groups.  \nImprove access by the poor to credit at affordable rates. \n\n \n13. \nTax  and  Nontax  Revenue.  In  the  past  decade,  the  growth  of  state  tax  and  nontax \nrevenue  has  not  been  buoyant,  because  of  the  difficulty  of  effectively  taxing  consumption \nfinanced by foreign remittances, a neglect of administration of tax collection and its reform, and \ninadequate  commitment  to  periodic  rate  adjustment  for  user fees.  Nontax  revenues  in  Kerala \nare low in comparison to the neighboring states. A special committee constituted by the Kerala \ngovernment in 1998 to advise on mobilizing nontax revenues have stressed the need for radical \nimprovements in this area. The  transformation  of  state  sales  tax  into  a  nationwide  system  of \nstate-operated  value-added  tax  (VAT)  including  taxation  of  services  is  proposed  to  take  effect \nfrom  April  2003.  This  initiative,  in  which  Kerala  is  participating,  is  intended  to  increase \ncompliance,  drastically  simplify  rates,  and  yield  neutrality  benefits  arising  from  interstate \nharmonization  and  coordination.  Other  fiscal  distortions  that  undermine  economic  efficiency \ninclude  high  stamp  duty  rates  and  inadequate  implementation  of  property  tax  by  local \ngovernments.  \n \n14. \nBudgeting  and  Expenditure  Management.  The  budgeting  system  and  supporting \ninstitutional  framework  for  expenditure  management  and  control  are  not  working  effectively. \nContributing causes of increased fiscal stress have been a rigid approach to budgeting, implicit \nreliance  on  a  supply-driven  priority  setting,  and  a  wish  to  maximize  the  size  of  the  plan \nindependent  of  resource  constraints.  An  imbalance  between  policy  objectives  and  available \nresources  is  at  the  heart  of  much  of  the  financial  indiscipline  and  operational  weakness. \nAggregate financial discipline of the budget process is weak, and hard expenditure targets are \nunderdeveloped as evidenced by the tradition of having up to three supplementary budgets per \nyear.  Managerial  autonomy  is  limited,  and  improved  cost-effectiveness  goes  unrewarded. \nPayment arrears thus build up, and flexibility to vary strategic allocations is lacking. Institutional \nprocesses  to  review  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  expenditures  are  weak.  Fiscal \ntransparency  is  inadequate,  leading  to  inadequate  financial  control.  Annual  submissions  that \naccompany  budget  proposals  from  departments  on  staff  strength  cannot  be  verified  by  the \nFinance Department.  The  lack  of  timely  reports  and  the  absence  of  a midyear assessment of \nbudget  and  budgetary  outcomes  deprive  decision  makers  of  the  intelligence  needed  to  make \ninformed  choices  about  future  spending  and  revenue  generation.  Capital  and  maintenance \noutlays are also neglected because they are discretionary expenditures.  \n \n\n                                                 \n4 Central Statistical Office, Government of India. \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nPower Sector. The Kerala government manages and regulates the state's power sector \n15. \nthrough KSEB, the monopoly supplier of electricity, which was established under the Electricity \n(Supply)  Act  of  1948.  KSEB  supplies  6.6  million  consumers.  Increased  consumption  of \nelectricity during the last decade has outpaced internal supply, requiring increased reliance on \nhigh-cost  sources  of  external  supply.  The  financial  performance  of  KSEB  has  rapidly \ndeteriorated, resulting in large implicit subsidies leading to a mounting stock of state guaranteed \ndebt. The absence of an independent regulator, and noneconomic interventions in tariff setting \nhas contributed to inadequate cost recovery. High rates of transmission and distribution losses, \nreported to be at least 30% of generated supply, high cost of purchase of thermal energy, high \ncost  of  finances,  cost  overrun  of  projects,  and  operational  inefficiency  have  deepened  the \nfinancial crisis. Although  the  Kerala  government  raised  power  tariffs  by  25%  in  mid-2001, the \nrate of increase fell far short of the 60% increase that was proposed in the White Paper on State \nFinances.  A  further  increase  took  effect  in  early  October  2002,  necessitated  by  KSEB's \nworsening  cash  flow  resulting  from  the  adverse  impact  of  the  low  monsoon  on  availability  of \nhydropower. \n \nState-Level  Public  Enterprises.  Kerala  has  111  active  SLPEs.  The  public  utility \n16. \nsubcomponent,  including  KSEB,  accounts  for  the  largest  shares  of  investment  (68%)  and \nemployment  (47%),  and  for  the  highest  share  in  the  aggregate  loss  of  the  state  public  sector. \nSLPEs are vulnerable to national and international competition that has recently intensified as a \nresult of India\u2019s World Trade Organization commitments. SLPEs' productivity has also  declined \nowing  to  inadequate  investment.  The  special  interdepartmental  enterprises  reform  committee \n(ERC) was established with an advisory mandate to develop an action plan to restructure and \nreform  SLPEs.  The  ERC  brought  out  its  first  approach  paper  on  SLPE  reform  and  has \ndetermined criteria to prioritize SLPEs for restructuring.  \n \n17. \nLocal  Self-Government.  Kerala  is  recognized  nationally  and  internationally  as  having \npioneered  decentralization  in  the  1990s,  giving  broad  powers  to  LSGs  to  improve  service \ndelivery and make government more accessible to the poor. The LSGs have made considerable \nprogress \nin  providing  housing,  water,  and  sanitation.  However, \ndecentralization is incomplete. The Kerala government has a policy to transfer a third of its plan \nfunds to LSGs but continues to employ and pay the wage bill for staff in key social sectors and \nhas not transferred funds for O&M of assets. The fiscal crisis has created fund shortfalls. As a \nconsequence,  there  is  a  serious  backlog  in  the  maintenance  of  schools,  hospitals,  and  water \nsupply  systems  that  have  been  transferred  to  LSGs.  Decentralization  entails  new  lines  of \naccountability and reporting. Without interfering, the Kerala government can assist by providing \nperformance  information  to  LSGs  and  build  independent  monitoring  mechanisms  such  as \nparent-teacher  associations,  health  boards,  and  various  civil-society  watchdogs.  The  Kerala \ngovernment  has  undertaken  a  study  funded  by  the  Netherlands  Government  to  analyze  and \nsummarize  the  experience  of  the  past  6  years.  The  LSG  action  plan  and  capacity  building \nprogram  also  draw  on  findings  of  the  review  and  the  recommendations  of  the  State  Planning \nBoard (SPB).   \n \n18. \nService Delivery. The quality of basic services by LSGs and the Kerala government has \nbeen deteriorating for a number of reasons: (i) diffused accountability caused by the incomplete \ntransfer  of  local  government  functions  from  the  Kerala  government,  (ii)  inadequate  measures \nand  lack  of  adequate  resources  to  address  the  capacity-building  requirements  of  LSGs,  (iii) \nemphasis  on  spending  plan  funds  on  new  initiatives  at  the  expense  of  allocating  money  for \nO&M, (iv) nonplan and a significant component of the plan funds going to pay staff salaries, (v) \nlack  of  a  citizen-centered  service  delivery  culture,  (vi)  few  opportunities  for  the  community  to \n\nthis  regard  and \n\nin \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5 \n\naudit the services provided by LSGs and the Kerala government, and (vii) lack of mechanisms \nto track the public expenditure that goes into service delivery.  \n \nCore Government Functions.5 The public sector operates with little concern for results, \n19. \nan  almost  complete  absence  of  a  service  culture,  overlap  and  duplication  across  levels  of \ngovernment, and policies riding on fragmented systems and processes of government.6 Policy \nformulation and coordination are diagnosed as paying insufficient attention to transparency and \nformal  consultation  processes.  Inadequate  attention  is  given  to  policy  implementation, \nenforcement,  and  monitoring.  Norms  for  civil  service  staffing  have  not  been  fundamentally \nreviewed  in  many  decades,  which  contributes  to  excessive  staffing  in  major  infrastructure \ndepartments  such  as  irrigation  and  public  works.  Frequent  transfer  of  senior  officers  leads  to \nreduced employee efficiency as well as reduced opportunities for staff to develop subject matter \ncompetencies. Payrolls, pensions, and personal records have not been computerized or linked, \nthus deterring effective management decision making on human resource issues.  \n \n20.  Many powers and functions related to delivery of essential services and local economic \ndevelopment  have  been  transferred  from  the  Kerala  government  to  LSGs.  Unfortunately,  the \ntransfer did not result in the restructuring of the Kerala government, which now has more than \n17,000  surplus  staff.7  A  further  5,000  should  be  transferred  to  LSGs  along  with  requisite \nfunctions.  The  Kerala  Administrative  Reforms  Committee  has  made  a  number  of  sound \nto  public  sector  performance.  These \nrecommendations \nrecommendations  will  need  to  be  implemented  in  a  coordinated  manner  across  all  levels  of \ngovernment. \n \nB. \n\nThe Kerala and Central Governments' Strategy  \n\nimpediments \n\nremove \n\nto \n\n21. \nThe  Partnership  between  the  Kerala  and  Central  Governments.  The  fiscal  and \nstructural  problems  described  above  are  also  experienced  by  many  other  states  and  have  led \nthe  central  Government  to  propose  a  number  of  important  reforms.  One  is  the  States\u2019  Fiscal \nReform  Facility,  which  provides  grant  resources  and  a  broad  agenda  for  structural  reforms  to \nhelp states meet fiscal targets. Eighteen states have received additional funding from the central \nGovernment  on  the  basis  of  improved  fiscal  performance.  Participating  states  have  agreed  to \ndevelop  a  medium-term  fiscal  framework  (MTFF)  that  quantifies  the  impacts  of  reforms and \nensures that policies are consistent with sustainable future outcomes for debt and deficit levels. \nA  second  incentive  program  to  encourage  structural  reform  in  operational  and  financial \nimprovement in the power sector is the Accelerated Power Development and Reform Program, \nwhich provides concessional financing to states for power improvements against a time-bound \nset  of  reform  milestones.  The  Kerala  government  has  reached  agreements  with  the  central \nGovernment on reform measures for the power sector, which are reflected in a memorandum of \nunderstanding (MOU) between the Kerala government and Ministry of Power, dated 20 August \n2001; and fiscal reform measures under the letter of shared fiscal goals and objectives from the \nKerala government to the Ministry of Finance, dated 4 February 2002.8 The Kerala government, \nalong with KSEB, is participating in a national agreement for the securitization of arrears owed \nby state electricity boards to central power utilities.  \n\n                                                 \n5  Para. 17 in Appendix 1 provides more information on core functions. \n6   The Kerala Government. 2002. Modernizing Government Program Strategy Document.  \n7   The number of state government employees, including teachers in government institutions, increased from 270,000 \nin FY1981 to 332,000 in FY2000. Together with teachers in aided institutions and employees of SLPEs, the total \nnumber of employees supported by the Kerala government was 478,000 in FY2000. \n\n8  In a letter dated 10 June 2002 to the central Government, the Kerala government agreed to incorporate the power \nsector deficit in the consolidated revenue deficit, and to include state guarantees in the consolidated debt stock. \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n22. \nThe Tenth Five-Year  Plan  (2002\u20132007).  In  keeping  with  the  decisions  of  the  National \nDevelopment Council, the Kerala government has formulated the Tenth Five-Year Plan, which \nfocuses  on  reforms,  poverty  reduction,  and  economic  development.  In  line  with  the  plan,  the \nKerala  government  has  identified  a  series  of  reform  initiatives:  (i)  a  medium-term fiscal reform \nprogram; (ii) power sector reform; (iii) administrative and governance reforms; (iv) restructuring \nof  laws  through  the  law  reform  committee;  (v)  phased  SLPE  reform;  (vi)  control of restrictive \nlabor  practices  through  a  clear  labor  policy;  and  (vii)  provision  of  an  economic  growth  policy \nenvironment through enunciation of policies on industry, labor, information technology, tourism, \nand urban development.9 \n \n23.  Modernizing  Government  Program.  The  Kerala  government  has  embarked  upon \ngovernance and public management reforms to address fiscal stress and restore the delivery of \nessential basic services, particularly to the poor and marginalized. The Kerala government has \ntaken  several  steps  to  pave  the  way  for  a  wide  and  comprehensive  multiyear  reform  agenda. \nThe  reform  is  guided  by  the  Modernizing  Government  Program  (MGP)  steering  committee, \nchaired  by  the  chief  secretary;  a  full-time  MGP  secretary  has  already  been  appointed.  A \ncomprehensive  strategy  is  supported  by  strategic  implementation  plans  for  the  MGP.  Five \nteams  comprising  Kerala  government  officials  were  tasked  to  develop  the  MGP  strategy,10 \nwhich  was  presented  at  a  workshop  in  April  2002.  The  strategy  has  since  been subjected to \nexternal  stakeholder  consultation,  has  been  approved  by  the  Council  of  Ministers,  and  is \navailable on the Kerala government web site. The strategy is underpinned by a number of core \nprinciples \ntransparency,  and \nparticipation. The strategy has five components: (i) ensuring a level of basic public services to \nthe poor and marginalized; (ii) building an enabling environment for growth; (iii) achieving fiscal \nsustainability  and  fiscal  targets  agreed  on  with  the  central  Government;  (iv)  enhancing  the \neffectiveness and efficiency of core Government functions; and (v) building on decentralization \nfor efficient, effective, and accessible LSGs.  \n \nC. \n\nto  ensure  performance  and  enforceability,  accountability, \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n24. \nPlacing  state  finances  on  a  sustainable  path  and  simultaneously  addressing  the \nstructural and institutional government problems that have given rise to fiscal stress are key to \nrenewal,  broad-based growth, and greater poverty reduction.  Prompt  action  is  needed  so  that \nthe  Kerala  government  can  respond  to  central  government  policy  initiatives  and  derive  the  full \nbenefits from mutually supportive reforms initiated by both levels of government.  \n \n25. \nAn  important  design  issue  is  the  extent  to  which  the  initial  policy phase of the power \nsector reform will be linked to the Program. Based on the problems experienced in many other \nstates  in  restructuring  their  power  sectors  and  finding  the  financial  resources  to  stop \nunsustainable  financial  and  nontransparent  institutional  practices,  the  central  Government \nstrongly  recommended  that  the  early  stages  of  power  reform  be  explicitly  integrated  into  the \ncurrent program design.  \n \nRationale and Links with ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program.  The ADB Country \n26. \nStrategy and Program for India supports policy and institutional reforms to (i) achieve equitable \nand  universal  provision  of  basic  services;  (ii)  strengthen  measures  to  raise,  allocate,  and \n\n                                                 \n9  Appendix 1 provides information on the actions already taken by the Kerala government as part of MGP and the \n\nagreement with the central Government. \n\n10  Supplementary Appendixes C and D: MGP Strategy and MGP Issues Papers and Milestone Charts. \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\naccount  for  resources  in  accordance  with  pro-poor  policies;  and  (iii)  make  government \naccountable and transparent. As state governments must oversee and manage the delivery of \nbasic services, an important dimension of ADB\u2019s strategy is to focus on state-level operations. \nIn  the  mid-1990s,  at  the  request  of  the  central  Government,  Gujarat  and  Madhya  Pradesh \nbecame the first two focal states for ADB assistance, and Kerala became the third soon after.  \n \nADB  provided  a  TA  for  fiscal  reforms11  to  the  Kerala  government,  and  a  TA  for  power \n27. \nsector reform is in preparation  for  a  power  sector  loan. 12  The  fiscal  TA  identified  institutional \nweaknesses  in  public  expenditure  management,  budgeting,  and  general  public  administration \nas major causes for poor service quality. A key TA recommendation was that fiscal sustainability \ncan only be achieved through implementation of a comprehensive public sector reform program \nunderpinned  by  sound  management  change  processes.  An  additional  TA13  for  administrative \ncapacity to implement VAT will be provided to selected states, including Kerala.  \n \n28. \nKerala  is  also  one  of  the  three  focal  states  for  assistance  from  the  Netherlands \nGovernment.  Its  main  areas  of  support  have  included  local  self-government,  water  and \nsanitation,  and  poverty  eradication.  More  recently,  the  Netherlands  Government has provided \nsupport  to  SLPEs  and  wishes  to  support  reform  initiatives  in  Kerala,  and  has  participated  in \ndeveloping  MGP.  MGP  reform  measures  are  fully  in  line  with  the  Netherlands  Government\u2019s \nstrategy for Kerala. \n \nD. \n\nLessons Learned  \n\n29. \nIn formulating this Program, specific attention was given to incorporating lessons learned \nfrom  past  programs,  the  recent  evaluation  by  ADB's  Operation  Evaluation  Department  of \nprogram  lending,14  and  the  assessment  of  the  Gujarat  Public  Sector  Resource  Management \nProgram.15  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  supporting  the  Public  Sector  Resource  Management  and \nPower  Sector  Reform  in  Gujarat  and  Madhya  Pradesh  has  highlighted  the  crucial  linkage \nbetween the reform of public finances and power sector reform. The program design draws on \nthe lessons learned in the following areas:  \n \n\n(i) \n\nProgram Formulation Process Lessons \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThe Program is based on a locally defined and broadly supported set of \nreforms.  Political  leaders  and  other  stakeholders  have  been  involved  in \nprogram  formulation  and  will  be  kept  fully  aware  of  the  purpose  and \nexpected impact of reforms.  \nAdequate  attention  has  been  given  to  ensuring  a  sound  macro \nenvironment  for  reform,  including  good  governance  and  supportive \nmacroeconomic policies. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2000.Technical Assistance to India for Supporting Fiscal Reforms in Kerala.

The  Program  will  be  closely  and  carefully  monitored,  and \nprocesses are already in place for ongoing dialogue. More systematic and \neffective monitoring arrangements are incorporated into the design.  \nThe  Kerala  government  has  developed  a  communication  strategy  and \nstarted a process of consultation on key policy documents emerging from \nthe  Program.  Assessing  public  awareness,  concerns,  and  support  for \nreform measures during program implementation has been factored into \nthe design. \n\nThe  Program has avoided including explicit and precise deficit reduction \ntargets as unexpected exogenous shocks can cause the fiscal position to \ndeteriorate sharply. \nThe  Program  emphasizes  policies  and  institutions  to  strengthen  fiscal \nmanagement  processes  and \ninstitutional \nmechanisms for prudent expenditure management.  \nThe Program is balanced with some degree of protection of expenditures \nin education, health, water supply, and sanitation for the program period. \nSocial  factors  of  downsizing  and  other  reform  measures  have  been \nmitigated to an extent by proactive social measures and safety nets.  \n\nincorporates  policies  and \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGAM  \n\n(iv) \n\nFiscal Reform Lessons  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA. \n\nObjectives and Scope  \n\n30. \nThe  Program  will  contribute  to  the  Kerala  government's  poverty  reduction  and \ndevelopment strategy contained in the Tenth Five-Year Plan (2002\u20132007). The objectives of the \nProgram are to support the Kerala government to: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nAchieve  fiscal  sustainability,  including  the  initial  policy  actions  for  power  sector \nreform. \nImprove  the  quality,  equity,  and  value  for  money  of  services  provided  by  the \nKerala government and LSGs. \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nImprove  the  targeting  and  quality  of  the  poverty  reduction  programs  and  social \nservices. \nStrengthen the functions and structures of state and local governments in Kerala \nto increase accountability, responsiveness, transparency, and efficiency. \n\n \n31. \nThe  Program  will  facilitate  the  implementation  of  the  Kerala  government\u2019s  reform \ninitiatives, which started in 2001. Under subprogram 1, a coherent set of policies to achieve the \nprogram objectives will be established. Measures to implement, monitor impact of, and establish \naccountability for the new policies will be adopted. The Kerala government and LSGs will begin \npolicy  implementation  in  all  thematic  areas  to  achieve  early  success  and  test  policy \nimplementation  before  embarking  upon  full-fledged  implementation  in  subprogram  2  by \nimplementing  projects,  which  will  be  designed  in  subprogram  1.  Specific  initiatives  to  assess \npolicy  effectiveness  and  measures  to  enforce  policy  will  also  be  included.  Criteria  will  be \ndeveloped during the midterm review of subprogram 1 to prioritize projects for subprogram 2.  \n  \n32. \nThe  Program  will  be  implemented  in  a  phased  manner  through  two  subprograms  to \nallow for flexibility and provide safeguards against inherent risks. Subprogram 1 is expected to \nbe completed within 24 months from October 2002, and subprogram 2 will be prepared after the \nmidterm review of subprogram 1. Implementation of subprogram 2 will follow immediately after \nsubprogram 1 and is expected to take a further 18 months. \n \nB. \n\nImportant Features16  \n\n33. \nThe  Program  has  a  number  of  important  features,  which  should  increase  the \nopportunities for benefits to be realized and sustained, including mainstreaming measures and \nsystems  to  track  the  performance  of  actions  in  the  policy  matrix,  implementing  the  Program \nusing  sound  program  and  project  management  principles,  and  developing  new  policies  using \nrevised guidelines to improve transparency and strengthen stakeholder consultation.  \n \n34. \n \n\nThe main features of the Program include the following:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nbuilding  on  the  successes  of  the  first-generation  social  development  reform \nmeasures, including Kerala's decentralization strategy; \nemphasizing areas of poverty that the first-generation reform measures could not \naddress; \nintegrating fiscal reform with reforms in service delivery and poverty reduction; \nforging a partnership among the central, Kerala, and Netherlands governments, \nand  ADB  to  deliver  the  reform  program  of  the  Kerala  government  and  its \nagreements with the central Government;  \nincluding  state  and  local  governments  in  the  Program  as  they  have  a  shared \nresponsibility for service delivery and poverty reduction; \nstrengthening \nagreements between the central and Kerala governments; and \ninstitutionalizing relations between state and local governments. \n\nrelations  by  helping \n\nintergovernment \n\nreform \n\nforge \n\nfiscal \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n16 Appendix  2  presents  a  chronology  of  the  processes  followed  in  preparing  the  Program.  Appendix  3  and \n\nSupplementary Appendix B contain information on background studies.  \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nC. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions17 \n\n1. \n\nThematic Area 1: Achieve Fiscal Sustainability \n\nThe  fiscal  policy  framework  for  subprogram  1  has  five  components:  (i)  initial  policy \n35. \nactions  to  enable  power  sector  reform,  (ii)  SLPE  reforms,  (iii)  MTFF,  (iv)  budgeting  and \nexpenditure management, and (v) strengthening of tax and nontax revenue mobilization.  \n \n\na. \n\nPower Sector Reform Prior Actions \n\n36. \nThe  inclusion  of  the  power  sector  policy  measures  as  prior  actions  in  subprogram  1 \nreflects the urgent need to begin reducing KSEB\u2019s drain on fiscal resources and mounting debt \nand contingent liability burdens that threaten to become future debt for the Kerala government. \nOtherwise, public finances will not become sustainable. The prior actions are designed to play a \ncatalytic role in the early stages of power sector reform. A separate power sector development \nprogram included in the lending program for 2003 will contain structural, institutional, and tariff \nrationalization reforms to achieve, among other objectives, the performance targets contained in \nthe agreements between the Kerala and central governments.  \n \n37. \nUnder the Program, the Kerala government must first (i) establish and operationalize the \nstate  electricity  regulatory  commission  (SERC);  (ii)  decide  to  finance  the  annual  revenue \naccount  deficit  of  KSEB  in  an  amount  not  less  than  such  percentage  as  agreed  between  the \ncentral  and  Kerala  governments;  (iii)  decide  to  have  antitheft  legislation  to  strengthen  Kerala's \nantitheft  program;  (iv)  have  full  settlement  of  dues  and  liabilities  as  defined  in  government \norders  and  the  policy  matrix  of  KSEB  and  the  Kerala  government  as  of  31  March  2002;  (v) \ndecide to have state-level power reform legislation for power sector reforms; and (vi) securitize \noutstanding  dues  of  central  public  sector  units  (CPSUs)  as  per  the  scheme  approved  by  the \ncentral Government and in accordance with the tripartite agreement signed between the central \nand  Kerala  governments.  KSEB  will  apply  for  revision  of  tariffs  before  SERC  within  not  more \nthan 2 months of its establishment. \n \n\nb. \n\nReform of State-Level Public Enterprises  \n\n38. \nThe  Kerala  government  has  established  the  ERC  to  steer  and  guide  SLPE  reforms.  It \nhas  prepared  an  approach  paper,  which  sets  out  policies  and  objectives,  and  the  criteria  for \nprioritizing  SLPEs.  The  approach  paper  has  been  approved  by  the  Kerala  government  as  the \nframework  for  implementing  SLPE  reforms;  11  manufacturing  SLPEs  have  been  identified  as \npriorities. Reform of SLPEs will help reduce the fiscal burden of the public enterprise sector and \nthereby contribute to achieving fiscal sustainability. The criteria used by the Kerala government \nto  prioritize  SLPEs  are  in  accordance  with  the  agreement  between  the  Kerala  and  central \ngovernments. The Kerala government has approved the ERC\u2019s recommendation to restructure \n11  manufacturing  SLPEs.  Subprogram  1  will  enable  funding  to  initiate  reform  and  enable  the \nKerala  government  to  restructure,  sell,  or  close  the  11  SLPEs  approved  by  the  Kerala \ngovernment  on  5  October  2002.  The  Kerala  government  will  be  required  to  make  timely \nvoluntary  retirement  settlement  (VRS)  payments  to  employees  from  the  counterpart  funds \ngenerated by the Program. In subprogram 1, the Kerala government will, inter alia, also do the \nfollowing:  \n\n                                                 \n17  The  policy  framework  for  subprogram  1  and  indicative  milestones  for  subprogram  2  are  in  Appendix  4.  The \nProgram logical framework is in Appendix 5. A summary poverty and social impact assessment is in Appendix 6. \nThe Program implementation costs are in Appendix 7. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n11 \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nFinalize and approve the policies on VRS for regular/permanent employees. \nDevelop and approve a social safety net (SSN) policy for all categories of eligible \nworkers. \nEnsure that all stakeholders, including employees, are fully consulted in finalizing \nVRS and SSN. \n\nc. \n\nMedium-Term Fiscal Framework  \n\nAdopting the MTFF Approach. The Kerala government\u2019s failure to link policy, planning, \n39. \nand budgeting has created a situation where these processes are fragmented and planning is \nlimited to an annual exercise for plan expenditure. By developing a consistent and realistic set \nof  resource  envelopes,  the  MTFF  will  improve  resource  allocation  to  strategic  priorities  and \nincrease  commitment  to  predictability  of  policy  and  funding  over  the  short  to  medium  term  so \nthat departments can plan ahead and programs can be sustained. \n \n40. \nThe Kerala government finalized its Medium-Term Fiscal Reform Plan (MTFRP) in 2001 \nas part of the agreement with the central Government. A revised set of fiscal projections as of \nNovember  2002  (see  Appendix  7)  under  the  MTFRP  has  been  agreed  on  by  the  Kerala  and \ncentral governments that explicitly incorporate the costs of adjustment of the Program, including \nthose associated with core government functions, LSGs, poverty reduction and minimum -needs \nprogram,  and  SLPE  reform.  In  addition,  the  Kerala  government  updates  the  MTFRP  annually, \nalong with semiannual reporting on performance against targets to help build accountability and \nto  ensure  that  decision  making  takes  place  within  the  parameters  of  the  fiscal  plan  in  the \nMTFRP.   \n \n41. \nFiscal  Responsibility  Legislation.  The  Kerala  government  has  decided  to introduce \nfiscal  responsibility  legislation  to  strengthen  the  state's  capacity  to  (i)  promote  fiscal \ntransparency, (ii) reduce the incentive to take liabilities off budget in the form of guarantees, (iii) \ninstitutionalize  a  medium-term  perspective  into  the  budgetary  process,  (iv)  adopt  corrective \npolicies  to  deal  with  emerging  imbalances  and  fiscal  slippage,  (v)  reduce  deficits,  (vi)  adjust \ntaxes  and  expenditure  to  shortfalls  in  budgetary  targets  more  quickly,  and  (vii)  clarify  for  the \npublic the medium-term implications of budget policy. Fiscal responsibility legislation has been \nprepared  by  the  Kerala  government  and  is  based  partly  on  the  central  Government\u2019s  fiscal \nresponsibility legislation. Karnataka State has already passed a fiscal responsibility act, and the \nPunjab  and  Maharashtra  governments  have  proposed  similar  legislation.  Fiscal  responsibility \nlegislation  in  Kerala  will  be  enacted  and  brought  into  force  in  2003  and  implemented  in \nsubprogram 2.  \n \n\nd. \n\nBudgeting and Expenditure Management  \n\nBudgetary  reform,  especially  in  resource  allocation,  is  a  powerful  driver  of  wider  public \n42. \nsector reform. Subprogram 1 will focus on the reform of central policy, planning, and budgeting \nsystems.  A  key  element  of  the  approach  is  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  Finance \nDepartment  in  the  secretariat  to  make  strategic  choices  and  lead  in  financial  and  policy \ndiscipline.  Subprogram  2  will  widen  and  deepen  implementation  and  completely  computerize \nthe  new  systems  in  an  integrated  manner.  Subprogram  2  will  also  continue  to  build  financial \nmanagement capacity.  \n \nBudget Preparation. Fiscal reform is intended to improve expenditure priority setting in \n43. \na  multiyear  framework,  and  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  spending  and  resource \nmobilization. The Kerala government is committed to implement its MTFRP as agreed with the \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\ncentral  Government,  develop  multiyear  budgeting  capacity,  and  pass  fiscal  responsibility \nlegislation. One of the first steps in reform is to bring forward the annual budget cycle to ensure \nthe  passage  of  the  budget  before  31  March  of  each  year.  The  new  budget  cycle  will  be \nintroduced  from  FY2004  with  forward  estimates  for  2  years,  which  should  integrate  with  the \ninvestment plan to protect capital investment in the social sectors. The Kerala government will \nalso introduce a simplified medium-term expenditure framework18 in subprogram 1 and provide \nline departments and agencies with a hard budget constraint and increased autonomy, thereby \nincreasing incentives for efficient and effective use of funds.  \n \n44. \nBudget Execution.  This  will  be  modernized  in  subprogram  1  to  prevent  uncontrolled \nborrowing,  poor  control  of  funds,  poor  estimation  of  timing  of  revenue  and  expenditure  flows, \nand disregard of hard budget ceilings through overexpenditure and supplementary demand for \ngrants.  The  budget  will  be  reviewed  midyear  to  enable  the  adoption  of  corrective  measures.   \nLegislation to cap guarantees will be introduced. Subprogram 1 will consider whether additional \npolicy  measures  are  required  for  efficient  administration  and  financial  discipline.  The  Kerala \ngovernment  will  prepare  a  midyear  report  not  later  than  31  January  2003  on  budget \nperformance  and  required  midyear  correction.  The  state  financial  accounts  for  FY2003  will  be \ntabled in the State Assembly before 31 October 2003.  \n \n\ne. \n\nTax and Nontax Revenue Mobilization \n\n45. \nVAT and Sales Tax.  The introduction of VAT by the states, originally planned for April \n2002, was deferred by the Government to April 2003. In Kerala, a number of critical actions are \nrequired to achieve the Government\u2019s target implementation date: (i) enacting VAT legislation in \nline  with  the  Government\u2019s  requirements;  (ii)  deepening  and  widening  the  VAT  awareness \nprogram  for  business,  tax  practitioners,  and  the  public;  (iii)  strengthening  audit  capacity;  (iv) \ndeveloping  capacity  to  administer  the  self-assessment  system  and  implement  the  tax  on \nservices; and (v) having a dedicated full-time team to implement the system.  \n \n46. \nSales  Tax  Arrears.  The  White  Paper  on  State  Finances  refers  to  the  dismal \nperformance of state-level tax administration. As of 31 March 2002, sales tax arrears amounted \nto  Rs17.1  billion.  In  the  Kerala  government  order  issued  on  8  October  2002,  the  Kerala \ngovernment outlined an action plan to strengthen the collection of sales tax arrears and put in \nplace special measures where targets were not met. The Kerala government is also committed \nto  continue  to  adhere  to  the  1999  agreement  among  all  states  not  to  grant  indirect  tax \nconcessions under the sales tax or its successor VAT. Subprogram 1 should see a significant \nimprovement in revenue collections due to the monitoring and reporting system. \n \n47. \nProperty  Tax.  The  First  State  Finance  Commission  recommended  fundamental \nchanges  in  tax  asses sment  and  collection,  the  most  significant  being  property  tax  reform  to \nsimplify  the  system  and  encourage  compliance  through  the  adoption  of  presumptive  methods. \nSPB has recommended that the recommendations for property tax reform be completed without \ndelay. New rules for property tax assessment in accordance with the Panchayat Raj Act (1994) \nand Municipalities Act (1994, as amended in 1999) will be introduced in subprogram 1. Reform \nfor  local  property  taxation  will  also  improve  efficiency,  transparency,  and  simplicity,  and  help \nLSGs mobilize their own resources.  \n \n                                                 \n18 The Kerala government will draw on the guidance provided by (i) ADB. 2000. Supporting Fiscal Reforms  in Kerala. \nManila; (ii) ADB. 1999. Managing Government Expenditure. Manila; and (iii) World Bank. 1998.  Public Expenditure \nManagement Handbook. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13 \n\nStamp  Duty.  In  subprogram  1,  the  Kerala  government  will  reduce  the  rate  of \n48. \nconveyance  (aggregate  of  stamp  duty  surcharge  and  registration  fee),  including  through  the \nrationalization  of  the  stamp  duty  system  by  fair  value  fixing.  Stamp  duty  rate  reduction,  in \nconjunction with adoption of presumptive norms for property valuation tied to the plinth area, is \nintended to improve the fairness, transparency, and buoyancy of the stamp duty and registration \nfee  systems  while  reducing  vulnerability  to  corruption  and  removing  disincentives  to  efficient \ntransfer of property.  \n \n\n2. \n\nThematic  Area  2:  Improve  the  Quality,  Equity,  and  Value  for  Money  of \nServices  Provided  by  the  Kerala  Government  and  the  Local  Self-\nGovernment \n\nSubprogram  1  will  facilitate  the  design  and  implementation  of  an  interrelated  set  of \n49. \npolicies  comprising  policies  on  service  delivery,  social  audit,  and  asset  renewal.  The  Program \nwill  create  the  enabling  environment  for  the  Kerala  government  to  develop  policies  in  priority \nsectors such as health, education, and water and sanitation services. \n \n50. \nService Delivery Policy. Planning service delivery is a complex process, which should \nbalance  competing  service  demands,  link  closely  with  financial  planning  and  performance \nmanagement  systems,  reflect  users'  needs,  and  involve  the  community  and  stakeholders. \nKerala poses special challenges. While LSGs have the mandate to deliver a significant number \nof  basic  services,  the  transfer  of  resources,  functions,  and  responsibilities  is  incomplete.  For \nexample, primary health care centers in village panchayats continue to have to rely on the state \ngovernment  through  the  Health  Department  for  health  care  staff,  purchase  of  drugs  and  other \nconsumables,  and  many  other  service  delivery-related  decisions.  In  some  areas,  difficulties \narise  from  the  lack  of  clear  responsibility  between  state  and  local  governments  to  provide \nservices.  \n \nUnder  subprogram  1,  the  Kerala  government  and  LSGs  will  develop  and  implement  a \n51. \nservice  delivery  policy  framework.  Its  main  features  will  include  (i)  customer-oriented service \ndelivery,  (ii)  a  code  of  practice  for  result-oriented  management  in  public  service  delivery,  (iii) \nstatutory  rights  of  access  by  citizens  to  service  delivery  information,  (iv)  enforcement  and \ncompliance  measures,  (v)  external  audit  to  strengthen  accountability  and  transparency,  (vi) \nsocial audit for grassroots assessment of service delivery, (vii) monitoring and public reporting \non  performance,  (viii)  institutional  arrangements  to  implement  the  policy,  and  (ix)  costs  of \nimplementing  the  policy  in  the  priority  areas.  Funds  will  be  made  available  from  the  Kerala \ngovernment  and  LSG  budgets  to  support  independent  organizations  that  will measure service \ndelivery  performance.  Responsibility  for  translating  the  central  policy  into  sector  policies  or \nlocation-specific policies will be with line departments/agencies and LSGs. \n \nThe Kerala government has approved the establishment of a service delivery policy unit \n52. \nreporting  to  the  MGP  secretary  in  the  Chief  Secretary\u2019s  Office  to  design  and  oversee  the \nimplementation of the service delivery policy. The unit will be operational before the end of the \nyear.  The  first  phase  of  the  implementation  of  the  service  delivery  policy  will  focus  on  land \ntransactions  in  revenue  and  registration  departments,  issuance  of  building  permits,  and  a \nselected  number  of  taluk  offices.  At  the  LSG  level,  the  policy  will  first  be  implemented  in  a \nprimary health care center in 14 village panchayats, three municipalities, and one corporation. \nImplementation  of  the  service  delivery  policy  will  need  to  be  linked  to  the  budget  preparation \nprocesses of the Kerala government and LSGs to ensure consistency in priorities between the \nareas targeted for service delivery improvements and budget allocations.  \n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nThe outputs from subprogram 1 will be a service delivery policy framework adopted by \n53. \nLSGs and the Kerala government. More specifically, LSGs and the Kerala government will plan \nand  manage  service  delivery  on  the  basis  of  outputs.  The  roles  and  responsibilities  in  service \nprovision  between  local  and  state  governments  will  be  clarified.  Subprogram  1  will  develop  a \nmethodology for participatory planning for the provision of health care services in primary health \ncare centers and for making inter district comparisons on the quality and quantity of services in \nthe  priority  areas.  The  service  delivery  policy  will  be  reviewed  after  implementation  of  the  first \nphase and a plan for wider implementation in subprogram 2 will be developed.  \n \n54. \nSocial  Audit Policy. The Kerala government will introduce social audit service delivery \nperformance by assessing the experience of the people service providers are intended to serve. \nWith community participation, the evidence will be collected from households, communities, and \nthe  service  itself.  The  social  audit  will  promote  accountability,  equity,  effectiveness,  and  value \nfor money, and has been used by national and international agencies. To prepare to introduce \nthe  social  audit  next  year,  the  Kerala  government  has  produced  a  draft  policy  based  on  the \nguidelines provided by the central Government and the small-scale village-level experiments in \nKerala. The draft policy is being subjected to wide stakeholder consultation and will be finalized \nduring  the  first  quarter  of  2003.  During  consultation,  field  trials  will  be  held  to  get  first-hand \nexperience.  The  results  of  social  audits  will  inform  the  service  delivery  and  asset  renewal \npolicies and plans. \n \n55. \nThe  social  audit  policy  will  be  implemented  in  health,  education,  water  supply,  and \nsanitation  in  subprogram  1.  The  key  outputs  from  subprogram  1  will  be  a  social  audit  policy \napproved  through  broad-based  stakeholder consultation and social audit reports for a focused \ngroup of services, and published in a form readily accessible to the public.  \n \n56. \nAsset  Renewal.  Operational  efficiency  and  service  delivery  are  constrained  by \nequipment and infrastructure that have not been maintained. Assets essential to provide basic \npublic  services  such  as  primary  health  and  child  nutrition  services  are  often  in  a  state  of \ndisrepair.  The  lack  of  attention  given  to  O&M,  combined  with  the  fund  shortage  and  rules \nprohibiting  use  of  plan  funds  for  maintenance,  has  led  to  deterioration  of  assets  required  to \nprovide basic public services.  \n \n57. \nIn  the  FY2002  budget,  the  Kerala  government  announced  the  creation  of  an  asset \nrenewal  fund  to  rehabilitate  assets  holding  back  the  provision  of  essential  public  services. \nSubprogram 1 will help implement an asset renewal policy linked to service delivery and social \naudit  policies,  and  focus  on  assets  required  to  deliver  social  services.  Key  policy  components \nwill include criteria for prioritizing services, establishing simple asset management systems, and \nmaking budget provisions to maintain assets. An independent team with suitable resources will \naudit the asset renewal program and report on performance. Criteria for the equitable sharing of \nthe asset renewal fund will also be developed and commence under subprogram 1. \n \n58. \nThe Kerala government has prepared an asset renewal policy, which is being subjected \nto  wider  consultation  with  LSGs  and  other  stakeholders.  The  institutional  and  funding \narrangements to implement the policy and track its performance will be particularly important to \nensure integration with the Kerala government and LSG priorities and with the service delivery \nimprovement plans. The policy's recommendations to facilitate a trouble-free and regular asset \nrenewal system include (i) amending financial rules to ensure that user charges and other local \ncharges can flow back to maintain assets, (ii) encouraging maintenance contracts through build-\noperation-maintenance arrangements, and (iii) rationalizing and making transparent the system \nof spares and consumables and their distribution.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n59. \nKey  subprogram  1  outputs  are  (i)  an  asset  renewal  policy  approved  by  the  Kerala \ngovernment and supported by an asset renewal fund and appropriate institutional arrangements \nto administer, manage, and monitor the policy; (ii) restoration of assets in priority areas; and (iii) \nestablishment of an asset management system and policies to ensure that funds are allocated \nfrom the budget for future asset maintenance in priority areas where assets have been restored.   \n \n60. \nRight  to  Information  and  Public  Disclosure.  An  integral  part  of  modernizing \ngovernment is making it transparent and accountable. Public servants withhold information from \ncitizens  for  many  reasons.  Several  states  now  have  laws  giving  citizens  the  right  to  access \ninformation  on  affairs  of  the  state  or  public  bodies.  The  Kerala  government  has  drafted \nlegislation on the right to information to complement  and strengthen service delivery and social \naudit  policies  and  to  allow  access  to  information  held  by  the  Kerala  government,  LSGs,  and \nSLPEs. The legislation will set out institutional mechanisms for enforcement and appeals, and \nprovide for the publication  of model schemes. Enactment of the legislation is a second-tranche \ncondition,  and  an  action  plan  to  implement  the  legislation  will  be  developed  by  the  Kerala \ngovernment and LSGs. Implementation will commence in subprogram 2.  \n \n\n3. \n\nThematic  Area  3:  Improve  the  Targeting  and  Quality  of  the  Poverty \nReduction Programs \n\n61. \nPoverty  Monitoring.  A  poverty  monitoring  unit  will  be  established  in  SPB  to  monitor, \nreport on, and manage the poverty database; and coordinate the provision of poverty data and \ninformation.  Under  subprogram  1  the  poverty  unit  will  (i)  establish  a  new  poverty  database  for \nthe state; (ii) introduce systems and processes to ensure that the database is updated through \nregular  validation  by  the  community,  and  government  processes;  (iii)  track  the performance of \nKerala  government  and  LSG  initiatives  to  reduce  poverty;  and  (iv)  manage  the  quality, \naccessibility,  and  timeliness  of  the  poverty  database.  The  poverty  unit  will  make  the  database \navailable to organizations that help reduce poverty and provide subsidized services to the poor.  \n \n62. \nAntipoverty  Subplan.  A  study  is  to  be  undertaken  by  the  Kerala  government  on \nrestructuring subsidies for index based entitlement, that is expected to be completed by 30 June \n2003.  An  antipoverty  subplan  under  the  subprogram  1  will  take  into  account  findings  of  the \nstudy.  An  antipoverty  subplan  policy  was  initiated  in  the  Kerala  government\u2019s  Tenth  Five-Year \nPlan,  and  a  working  group  to  prepare  and  oversee  policy  implementation  has  been  set  up  in \nSPB. Similar working groups are being set up by LSGs, and a special chapter on poverty and \nthe  means  to  reduce  it  will  become  mandatory  in  the  plan  document  of  LSGs.  The  Kerala \ngovernment  has  issued  a  handbook,  and  under  subprogram  1,  LSGs  will  develop  antipoverty \nsubplans. Six hundred officials have been trained and allocations earmarked for special groups: \n(i)  women\u201410%;  (ii)  the  disabled,  aged,  and  children\u20145%;  and  (iii)  scheduled  castes\u201420%. \nThe  antipoverty  subplan,  study  on  subsidies,  and  updated  poverty  database  will  provide  the \nenabling environment for the Kerala government to meet poverty reduction targets in the Tenth \nFive-Year Plan. \n \nCoordination  of  Poverty  Reduction  Schemes  and  Access  to  Credit  by  the  Poor. \n63. \nState  and  centrally  sponsored  schemes   for  poverty  reduction  are  implemented  with  little \ncoordination or management. Subprogram 1 will provide guidelines to LSGs for coordinating all \npoverty-related  schemes  to  ensure  coherence  and  consistency,  and  provide  training. \nSubprogram 1 will produce a  strategy to increase the poor's access to credit, while subprogram \n2 will implement the strategy. \n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nKey outputs will be an effective system of monitoring poverty, LSG antipoverty subplans \n64. \nbacked by funds and systems to track performance, and sound and transparent information on \nsubsidies to facilitate resource allocation and improve the targeting of subsidies. \n \n\n4. \n\nThematic  Area  4:  Strengthen  the  Functions  and  Structures  of  the  Kerala \nGovernment  and  Local  Self-Government  to \nIncrease  Accountability, \nResponsiveness, and Transparency \n\nStrengthen  Policymaking.  The  quality  of  policymaking  has  a  direct  impact  on  the \n65. \nquality  of  public  services.  The  underlying  principles  of  improved  policy-making  processes \ninclude  (i)  developing  policy  by  adopting  a  more  consultative  and  inclusive  approach,  (ii) \nfocusing on outputs and outcomes, (iii) taking into consideration capability and local capacity to \ninterpret  and  implement  the  policy,  (iv)  making  a  preliminary  assessment  of  the  costs  of \nimplementation,  (v)  mainstreaming  gender  and  poverty  considerations  in  policymaking,  (vi) \nestablishing institutional mechanisms for measuring the activities and outcomes expected from \nthe  policy,  (vii)  reviewing  the  policy  after  a  period  of  implementation,  (viii)  incorporating \nmeasures and institutional arrangements for enforcement, and (ix) putting in place appropriate \nsanctions  needed  for  noncompliance  and  incentives  to  achieve  performance  targets.  New \npolicies developed under subprogram 1 should be supported by an implementation plan and a \nperformance monitoring and reporting system. For policies where the initial poverty and social \nimpact assessment19 (IPSA) recommends a more detailed assessment, provision will be made \nfor this. \n \n66. \nSurplus  Staff  Redeployment. The  Kerala  government  has  over  17,000  surplus  staff \nand  over  5,000  that  need  to  be  transferred  to  LSGs.  The  Kerala  government  has  decided  to \nredeploy  surplus  staff,  including  transferring  them  to  LSGs  to  solve  staff  shortages.There  is  a \nban  on  the  creation  of  new  posts  and  controls  on  the  intake  of  new  staff.  The  Kerala \ngovernment agreement with the central Government requires the attrition rate to be maintained \nat minimum 1%. A surplus staff committee has set a target of redeploying at least 20% of the \nstaff in subprogram 1. A unit has been set up in the Personnel and Administration Department \nto redeploy the 17,000 staff identified by the committee. The Kerala government has consulted \nrelevant  stakeholders  and  the  committee,  and,  jointly  with  relevant  departments, identified the \nsurplus staff. The initiative will directly benefit LSGs as they are short-staffed in several areas. \nThe  surplus  staff  policy  combined  with  a  carefully  managed  human  resources  management \npolicy will improve productivity and release funds for socially desirable investment. \n \nClosure  of  Long-Pending  Infrastructure  Projects.  The  Kerala  government  has \n67. \nprepared  a  policy  to  review  and  close  long-pending infrastructure projects in several sectors, \nincluding  irrigation,  roads,  and  water  supply.  The  initiative  is  to  close  nonviable  long-running \n(over  5-year)  infrastructure  projects  on  the  basis  of  sound  criteria  and  evaluation  by  a \nmultidisciplinary  team  and  the  consideration  of  a  committee  set  up  for  the  purpose.  In \ndeveloping  the  criteria,  consideration  will  be  given  to  the  policy  for  the  sector.  Economic \nconsiderations  will  be  incorporated  into  administrative  decisions  on  the  future  of  incomplete \ninfrastructure projects. This exercise will lead to the release of resources and create the fiscal \nspace to address development priorities. At the end of subprogram 1, a plan for termination of \nlong-pending  projects  in  irrigation  and  harbor  engineering  departments,  which  have  been \nevaluated  by  expert  teams  and  recommended  by  the  committee  as  unproductive,  will  be \napproved.  \n\n                                                 \n19   The  IPSA  was  carried  out  by  the  Center  for  Development  Studies,  Thiruvananthapuram,  Kerala,  for  the  policy \n\nmeasures in the Program. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n68. \nIntegrated  Payroll  and  Personnel  Computerized  System.  The  Kerala  government \nhas prepared a concept note for a computerized payroll and personnel management system to \nreplace the manual system. The concept note describes the current system and its limitations, \nand  outlines  the  proposed  system  and  standardization  approach  across  departments.  The \nsystem will considerably benefit data and information management and human resources. The \nsystem  should  reduce  the  time  for  employees  to  receive  their  salaries  and  make  payroll \npreparation  significantly  more  efficient.  The  personnel  records  subsystem  will  become  the \nprimary  information  base  for  managing  the  redeployment  of  surplus  staff.  The  system  will  be \nintroduced initially in the secretariat, including the Commercial Taxes Department. \n \n69. \nLocal  Self-Government.  On  1  October  2002,  the  Kerala  government  approved  an \naction plan prepared by SPB to address the major constraints facing LSGs. Key elements of the \naction  plan  will  be  implemented  in  subprogram  1.  The  outputs  will  include  (i)  measures  to \nrationalize,  dissolve,  and  merge  parallel  bodies  and  institutions  that  are  in  conflict  with  the \nmandate  of  LSGs;  (ii)  transfer  and  integration  of  the  various  centrally  sponsored schemes to \nLSGs;  (iii)  ensuring  that  critical  vacancies  and  shortages  in  technical  and  specialist  staff  are \nsolved  by  transfer  of  surplus  staff  from  the  Kerala  government,  direct  recruitment,  or \noutsourcing;  (iv)  establishment  of  basic  systems  and  processes  for  effective  financial \nmanagement;  and  (v)  completion  of  the  transfer  of  staff  and  services  from  the  Kerala \ngovernment,  including  transfer  of  the  rural  water  supply  schemes  after  rehabilitation  using  the \nasset renewal facility. The procedures for the transfer of the budgets relating to salaries will also \nbe  finalized  in  subprogram  1,  with  the  actual  transfer  envisaged  under  subprogram  2.  A \nsubmission has also been made to the Council of Ministers to lift the 1999 stay order to abolish \ndistrict rural development agencies and redirect funding from the centrally sponsored schemes \nto  district  panchayats.  Council  approval  of  the  submission  will  be  a  powerful  positive  signal  of \nthe Kerala government\u2019s commitment to decentralization.  \n \nSecond  State  Finance  Commission  Recommendations.  In  its  report  to  the  Kerala \n70. \ngovernment  in  January  2001,  the  Second  State  Finance  Commission  recommended  many \nimportant measures, including inter alia, the following: (i) measures for LSGs to raise their own \nrevenue, (ii) streamlining of government grants; and (iii) a maintenance fund for asset renewal. \nA  subcommittee  of  secretaries  was  especially  constituted  to  review  the  report.  The  Kerala \ngovernment  will  decide  on  these  and  other  recommendations  of  the  commission  for \nimplementation, in subprogram 1.  \n \nCapacity Building in Financial Management. The Kerala government has prepared a \n71. \npolicy  to  build  financial  management  capacity  in  LSGs.  The  policy  is  being  converted  into  a \ndetailed plan for implementation in subprogram 1. The policy has four interrelated components: \n(i)  legislative  provisions,  rules,  manuals,  government  orders,  and  circulars;  (ii)  setting  up  of \nsimple and effective operating systems; (iii) institutional arrangements for training delivery; and \n(iv)  human  resource  development.  A  committee  comprising  secretaries  from  the  LSG \nDepartment,  planning  secretary,  MGP  secretary,  expenditure  secretary,  and  the  director  from \nthe Local Government Training Institution will monitor the performance of the capacity-building \nprogram.  Subprogram  1's  output  will  be  the  completion  of  the  first  phase  of  the  program  and \nperiodic  performance  monitoring  reports  from  the  committee.  The  Kerala  government  will  set \naside 0.33% of the plan allocation to LSGs for capacity building and progressively increase this \nportion to 1.5%.  \n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nRestructuring the Secretariat.20 The most significant changes in the core functions of \n72. \nthe  Kerala  government  came  about  as  part  of  decentralization.  However,  little  has  changed  in \nthe  organization  of  the  government  machinery,  and  the  functions  and  structures  of  the  Kerala \ngovernment must be aligned with the core functions, otherwise the Kerala government will have \nincreasing  difficulty  in  delivering  its  core  functions  effectively,  efficiently,  and  economically. \nSenior  officials  are  occupied  with  operational  activities  at  the  expense  of  policymaking  and \noverseeing  policy  implementation.  The  Kerala  Administrative  Reforms  Committee,  set  up  in \n2000, recommended changes to the structures and functions of the secretariat and associated \ndepartments.  The  MGP  task  team  responsible  for  core  government  functions  proposed  a  two-\nstage  functional  review  of  functions  and  structures:  (i)  across  departments  and  (ii)  within \ndepartments.  \n \nThe  Kerala  government  is  establishing  a  functional  review  unit  in  the  chief  secretary\u2019s \n73. \noffice,  reporting  to  the  MGP  secretary.  This  unit  will  guide  and  steer  the  process.  Kerala \ngovernment  officials  will  conduct  reviews  in  a  number  of  departments  in  the  secretariat, \nincluding  the  Finance  Department,  and  on  the  basis  of  these  reviews,  prepare  restructuring \nproposals and recommend secretariat functions and structure.21 \n \n74. \nThe main outputs from subprogram 1 are (i) a functional review methodology approved \nby  the  Kerala  government  and  officials  with  the  capability  to  conduct  the  reviews,  (ii)  Kerala \ngovernment  approval  for  restructuring  of  the  secretariat  (including  the  Finance  Department22) \nand the Commercial Taxes Department, and (iii) a plan for the Kerala government to complete \nthe  reviews  in  the  remaining  departments.  The  cross-departmental  review  will  provide  a  road \nmap  for  changes  in  functions  and  structures  across  departments.  Under  subprogram  1,  the \nfunctions  and  structures  between  the  LSG  and  rural  departments  will  be  rationalized. \nSubprogram 2 will focus on implementing the proposals to restructure the secretariat. Functional \nreviews will be extended to other departments and agencies.  \n \nD. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n75. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $200  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  to  help  finance  subprogram  1.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  a  front-end  fee  of  1.0%,  and  such  other \nterms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Program  Agreements.  The  central \nGovernment will make Loan proceeds available to the Kerala government promptly as required \nfor  subprogram  1.  The  central  Government\u2019s  current  policy  of  assistance  to  the  Kerala \ngovernment  is  a  loan-grant  ratio  of  70:30.  The  central  Government  will  bear  the  foreign \nexchange risk on the loan. The central Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its \ndecision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and \nconditions;  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision,  not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n76. \nThe Government of the Netherlands will support the reform agenda set out by the Kerala \ngovernment through MGP, and contribute $50 million to subprogram 1 as a grant in addition to \nthe  ADB  Loan.  The  Government  of  the  Netherlands  has  agreed  to  an  arrangement  of  joint \n                                                 \n20  State headquarters of government departments. \n21 The  Kerala  government  will  receive  support  through  a  TA  (ADB.  2002.  Strengthening  State  Government \n\nEffectiveness and Accountability in Kerala. Manila) to design and implement a functional review methodology.  \n\n22 The restructuring of the Finance Department will be linked to the modernization of the budgeting and expenditure \n\nmanagement system. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19 \n\ncofunding  with  ADB,  which  will  administer  the  funds,  on  the  basis  of  a  common  policy  matrix. \nThe  joint  monitoring  of  the  milestones  in  the  policy  matrix  will  minimize  the  administrative \nburden on the Kerala government.23  \n \nE. \n\nFinancial Implications of the Reform Program \n\n77. \nProgram  implementation  will  involve  substantial  adjustment  costs  estimated  at  $592 \nmillion during almost 4 years (Table 1). These costs are associated with specific policy actions \nunderlying  the  reform  program,  including,  inter  alia,  transitional  budgetary  impact  of  power \nsector  and  public  enterprise  reforms,  loss  of  revenue  on  account  of  rationalization  of  the  tax \nsystem,  expenditure  on  asset  renewal,  improved  service  delivery,  capacity  building  of  LSGs, \nand functional review and organizational change in institutional setup. Further cost details are in \nAppendix 7. \n \n\nTable 1: Financial Implications of the Reform Program \n\nItem \n\nTransitional Budgetary Impact of Power Sector Reform \nRevenue Losses of Tax Measures \nCost of Public Enterprises Reform \nSocial Funding Arising from TP Account Closure \nMGP Coordination and Program Management \nService Delivery Improvements \nImproving Targeting and Quality of Poverty Reduction Programs  \nStrengthening Local Government Functions and Structures \nStrengthening State Government Functions and Structures \nTotal \n\nCost \n($ million) \n148.3 \n71.3 \n54.7 \n65.1 \n1.5 \n136.2 \n19.8 \n49.9 \n44.8 \n591.9 \n\n        MGP = Modernizing Government Program, TP = Treasury Accounts for Shared Cost Programs \n \n78. \nCounterpart  funds  will  be  used  to  finance  costs  of  structural  adjustments  under  the \nProgram, including (i) the cost of the Program\u2019s interventions in service delivery improvement in \nthe  social  sectors  through  asset  renewal,  social  audit,  and  capacity  building;  (ii)  the  cost of \nimplementing the LSG action plan to complete decentralization; and (iii) the cost of restructuring \nand strengthening the state government to become more effective and efficient.24 \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements  \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n79. \nThe Kerala government will be responsible for the effective administration and utilization \nof the loan proceeds and the counterpart funds. The Kerala government will appoint the Office \nof  the  Chief  Secretary  and  the  Finance  Department  to  be  the  program  executing  agencies \n(EAs).  The  MGP  steering  committee,  which  will  be  responsible  for  overall  coordination, \nimplementation,  and  monitoring  of  the  Program,  will  assist  the  EAs  and  report  to  the  MGP \ncabinet  subcommittee  chaired  by  the  chief  minister.  The  MGP  steering  committee  will  be \nheaded  by  the  chief  secretary,  and  comprise  the  principal  finance  secretary,  principal  power \n\n                                                 \n23  In  addition,  the  Government  of  the  Netherlands  is  willing  to  fund  technical  assistance  required  to  strengthen \nprogram  management,  capacity  building,  communications,  and  other  relevant  activities  in  support  of  MGP.  The \ntechnical assistance requirements will be finalized as part of preparation of detailed implementation plans due on \n31 December 2002.  \n\n24  Please see para. 107 for details. \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nsecretary, MGP secretary, and all secretaries of departments participating under the Program. \nThe MGP steering committee will meet at least once every month to review and report on the \nprogress and performance of the Program to the (i) MGP cabinet subcommittee and (ii) monthly \nmeeting of secretaries of the Kerala government.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPeriod of Implementation \n\n80. \nThe period of implementation for subprogram 1 will be from October 2002 to September \n2004. Based on progress under subprogram 1, the proposal for subprogram 2 is expected to be \nsubmitted for separate Board consideration, envisaged before end 2004. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n81. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  finance  the  foreign  exchange  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and \ntaxes)  of  items  produced  in  and  procured  from  ADB\u2019s  member  countries,  other  than  ineligible \nitems  (Appendix  8)  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  All \nprocurement will be through normal commercial practices in case of procurement by the private \nsector,  or  prescribed  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  in  case  of  procurement  by  the  public \nsector, with due regard for the principles of economy and efficiency. \n \nIn  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification of Disbursement Procedures \n82. \nand  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans,  the  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be \ndisbursed  to  the  Government  as  the  Borrower.  No  supporting  import  documentation  will  be \nrequired if, during each year in which the loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value \nof the Government\u2019s total imports minus imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, \nand imports financed under other official development assistance is equal to or greater than the \nloan amount expected to be disbursed during such year. The Government will, however, certify \nwith each withdrawal request its compliance with this formula. Otherwise, import documentation \nunder  existing  procedures  will  be  required.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  loan \nproceeds and verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. Loan proceeds may be used \nto  finance  eligible  imports  for  which  expenditures  were  incurred  180  days  before  the  loan \nbecomes effective. \n \n\n4. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n83. \nThe rupee counterpart funds to be generated out of the loan proceeds will be transferred \nby the central to the Kerala government. The counterpart proceeds will be treated as an addition \nto the transfers allocated annually from the central to the Kerala government.  \n \n\n5. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching25 \n\n84. \nA cluster program modality comprising subprograms 1 and 2 is proposed. The program \ncluster  approach  will  not  only  allow  flexibility,  but  also  safeguard  against  inherent  risks  and \npermit  the  uncoupling  of  power  sector  reform  agenda  from  other  policy  areas  after  the  prior \nactions in the policy matrix are fulfilled.  Two tranches are envisaged under subprogram 1, which \nwill last  24  months,  from  October  2002  to  September  2004.  Subprogram  2  will  be  prepared \nfollowing  the  midterm  review  of  subprogram  1  to  allow  a  full  12  months  of  implementation \nexperience to inform the content and design. Subprogram 2 will be presented for consideration \nand approval by the ADB Board based on progress in implementing subprogram 1, status of the \n\n                                                 \n25  The loan implementation schedule is in Appendix 9. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n21 \n\nproposed  policy  actions,  and  readiness  of  the  Kerala  government  to  implement  the  proposed \nreforms in subprogram 2. The loan for subprogram 2 is expected to start in late 2004 and will be \ndeveloped  through  consultation  among  the  central,  Kerala,  and  Netherlands  governments,  and \nADB. Appendix 4 provides an indicative list of milestones expected to be achieved at the end of \nsubprogram 2. \n \n85. \nThe  loan  will  adhere  to  the  following  tranching  pattern:  subprogram  1  will  provide  loan \nresources  equivalent  to  $200  million  to  be  divided  into  two  equal  tranches,  and  subprogram  2 \nwill provide loan resources equivalent to $100 million, also to be divided into two equal tranches. \nA  parallel  grant  from  the  Government  of  the  Netherlands  is  proposed  to  augment  the  loan \nresources by helping the Kerala government absorb the costs of adjustment under the loan. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n86. \nThe central and Kerala governments will maintain separate accounts and records for the \nloan including separate budget heads of accounts for each of the items of expenditure under the \nProgram in accordance with sound accounting principles, and will have such accounts audited \nannually  in  accordance  with  standards  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  provide  certified  copies  of  the \nsame to ADB promptly after their preparation but not later than 9 months after the close of the \nfiscal year to which the accounts refer. \n \n\n7. \n\nProgram Performance Management \n\n87. \nBy  not  later  than  January  2003,  the  Kerala  government  will  set  up  a  program \nperformance management system (PPMS) as agreed on with ADB and cause it to be operated \nthroughout  program  implementation.  Under  the  PPMS,  the  Kerala  government  will  periodically \nreview the Program, drawing on ADB's performance management system guidelines, to assess \nand  evaluate  the  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  benefit  monitoring,  progress,  and \nachievement  of  the  Program.  Quarterly  PPMS  reports  will  be  submitted  to  the  MGP  cabinet \nsubcommittee and published on the Kerala government\u2019s web page. The Kerala government will \nmake available the PPMS reports to ADB and the Government of the Netherlands on a quarterly \nbasis within 2 weeks after the respective quarters. The Kerala government will also provide ADB \nand  the  Government  of  the  Netherlands  with  central  and  Kerala  government  monitoring  and \nevaluation  reports  on  fiscal  reform  measures  under  the  Letter  of  Shared  Fiscal  Goals  and \nObjectives,  and  the  tripartite  agreement  between  central  and  Kerala  governments,  and  the \npower sector reforms related MOU between the Ministry of Power and Kerala government. On \nprogram completion, but not later than 3 months after, the Kerala government will provide ADB \nand  the  Government  of  the  Netherlands  with  a  program  completion  report,  including  an \nassessment  of  the  overall  program  performance.  The  Kerala  and  Netherlands  governments, \nand ADB shall carry out periodic reviews of the Program, after each report. \n \n\n8. \n\nProgram Performance Monitoring and Program Review \n\n88. \nThe  Kerala  and  Netherlands  governments  and  ADB  will  closely  monitor  program \nimplementation  and  impact.  The  Kerala  government  will  provide  all  information  and  extend  all \ncooperation that ADB and the Government of the Netherlands may require. The monitoring will \ninclude,  among  other  things,  MGP,  tracking  of  the  overall  reduction  in  the  fiscal  deficit,  and \nadherence to the agreements between the central and Kerala governments on fiscal and power \nsector  reforms.  The  central,  Kerala  and  Netherlands  governments  and  ADB  will  undertake  a \nmidterm  review  of  the  Program  at  the  end  of  2003  or  early  2004.  The  midterm  review  will  (i) \nreview  the  program  scope,  design,  and  implementation  arrangements;  (ii)  identify  changes \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\nneeded  since  program  appraisal;  (iii)  assess  implementation  performance  against  program \nperformance  indicators  and  objectives;  (iv)  review  and  establish  compliance  with  the  legal \ncovenants;  (v)  identify  problems  and  constraints;  and  (vi)  the  MGP.  If  the  midterm  review \ndetermines that changes are required in Program implementation, the Kerala and Netherlands \ngovernments  and  ADB  will  agree  on  measures,  including  changes  in  implementation \narrangements,  to  ensure  that  Program  obligations  are  met.  The  Kerala  and  Netherlands \ngovernments  and  ADB  will  carry  out  a  final  review  after  the  conclusion  of  the  Program \n(subprogram 1). \n \n\nV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\n89. \nVision. The Program will contribute to the Kerala government\u2019s overall reform agenda. \nSubprogram  1  will  enable  the  Kerala  government  to  build  vital  capacity  in  modernizing  of \npolicymaking,  monitoring  the  poor's  access  to  government  services,  and  using  modern \nexpenditure management and budgeting techniques. With these enhanced capacities in place, \nthe state can discourage wasteful expenditures and redirect resources to program activities with \ngreater  social  and  economic  benefits.  Subprogram  2  will  build  upon  the  reforms  and \nstrengthened  institutional  foundation  developed  in  subprogram  1.  The  benefits  expected  from \nsubprogram 1 are outlined below by thematic area. \n \n90. \nFiscal Sustainability.  The  Program  will  help  execute  the  fiscal  correction  measures \nagreed  on  between  the  central  and  Kerala  governments.  For  the  power  sector,  the  program \nmeasures will create sound regulatory  and financial foundations for reform. The policy reforms \nwill  support  a  renewed  power  sector  investment  program,  partly  funded  under  proposed  ADB \nlending.  Implementation  of  the  Kerala  government\u2019s  SLPE  action  plan  will  reduce  the  Kerala \ngovernment\u2019s  liabilities,  consolidate  and  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  public  sector  while \ncreating  the  space  for  private  sector  investment.  The  MTFF  will  bring  about  a  number  of \nbenefits:  (i)  improvements  in  the  predictability  of  the  resources  available,  (ii)  adoption  of  new \nbudgets  at  the  start  of  the  financial  year  by  line  department,  (iii)  increased  transparency  in \nbudget  reporting  and  scrutiny,  and  (iv)  an  expanded  and  institutionalized  MTFF  system  that \nrealistically  identifies  multiyear  resource  envelopes  and  expenditure  commitments  to  help \npolitical leaders make informed choices about expenditures over competing uses over time.  \n \n91. \nImprovement  of  Service  Delivery  Quality.  The  Program  will  create  the  enabling \nenvironment  and  fiscal  facility  to  improve  the  quality  and  quantity  of  services  provided  by  the \nstate  and  LSGs.  Service  delivery  improvement  projects  will  be  piloted  in  priority  social  sector \nservice delivery points, and lessons learned will feed into a wider program in subprogram 2. The \nKerala  government  will  create  the  enabling  legislation  to  become  more  transparent  and \naccountable  by  providing  relevant,  timely,  and  useable  information  to  citizens.  Subprogram  2 \nwill have initiatives focusing on the implementation of the Right to Information Act.  \n \n92. \nStrengthening  of  Poverty  Reduction  Programs.  The  Program  will  help  the  Kerala \ngovernment  target  the  poor,  improve  efficiency  of  poverty  reduction  projects  and  programs, \nprovide better information on the effectiveness of subsidies for the poor, strengthen the poverty \ninstitutional  network  for  program  delivery  and  poverty  monitoring,  and  develop  a  poverty \nsubplan through a consultative process under subprogram 2.  \n \n93. \nStrengthening  of  Functions  and  Structures  of  the  Kerala  Government  and  LSGs. \nThe expected benefits include (i) a civil service that will change behavior by focusing on results \n\n\f \n\n \n\n23 \n\nand performance; (ii) introduction of sound, transparent, and consultative policymaking that links \npolicy,  planning,  and  budgets;  (iii)  more  effective  utilization  of  staff  and  containment  of  staff \ncosts;  (iv)  better  information  to  plan  and  manage  human  resources;  (v)  a  program  to  upgrade \nskills of staff for redeployment; (vi) a state government restructured to become more efficient, \neffective, and accessible, and to create the enabling environment for local government to deliver \nits  mandate;  (vii)  improved  accountability  and  authority  by  LSGs  over  human  resources;  (viii) \nincreased  financial  management  capacity  in  LSGs  and  considerable  learning  on  how  to  build \ncapacity  in  other  areas,  which  would  benefit  the  design  of  subprogram  2;  and  (ix)  LSGs \nunconstrained by the existence of parallel institutions undermining LSGs' mandate and utilizing \nresources due to LSGs. \n \nB. \n\nImpacts \n\n94. \nPoverty  Impact.  An  IPSA  was  carried  out  by  the  Center  for  Development  Studies,  a \nleading  think  tank  on  social  issues  in  India,  particularly  in  Kerala  (Appendix  6).  The  study \nconcludes  that  the  policy  measures  proposed  for  the  power  sector  and  SLPEs  do  not  have  a \nmajor adverse impact on the poor. One of the initiatives under the MTFF\u2014to curtail non-interest \ngovernment  expenditure  as  a  percentage  of  GSDP\u2014has  the  potential  to  generate  an  adverse \nimpact  on  the  poor.  However,  such  adverse  impact  is  strongly  mitigated  by  a  number  of \ncomprehensive initiatives as part of MGP: the LSG action plan and the antipoverty measures. In \naddition, the action under the Program are intended to identify and curtail wasteful expenditure \nthat in turn will free up additional resources for high priority social spending targeted to the poor. \nThe impact of the reform on women will be diverse. SLPE reform might have an adverse impact \non women in some regions and some sectors, but overall the resources released should benefit \nwomen.  Similarly,  the  poverty  reduction  schemes,  particularly  the  Kudumbashree  and \nmicrocredit  will  benefit  poor  women.  Policy  measures  for  SSN  and  VRS  should  mitigate  the \nadverse  impact  of  SLPE  reforms  on  women.  Mitigation  measures  in  this  regard  include \nconsultations with all affected employees in developing policies for SSN and VRS.26 \n \n95. \nEnvironmental  Impact.  An  environmental  impact  assessment  of  the  policy  matrix  was \nundertaken alongside the IPSA, 27 and the assessment concluded that MGP and fiscal reforms, \nincluding in the power sector, will not have an adverse impact on the environment or lead to any \ninvoluntary  resettlement  problems.  More  efficient  government  departments  following  MGP  and \ndecentralization  might  even  help  implement  existing  stringent  laws  against  environmental \npollution and land degradation.  The power sector reforms proposed as prior actions are limited \nto  tariff  rationalization  and  fiscal  reform  measures  and,  therefore,  have  no  impact  on  the \nenvironment.   \n \n96. \ntrigger ADB's involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples policies.  \n \nC. \n\nInvoluntary  Resettlement  and  Indigenous  Peoples  Policies. The Program does not \n\nPotential Risks28  \n\n97. \nPolicy  and  institutional  reforms,  management  improvement,  and  public  service  reform \nare all subject to considerable risk. A risk management and mitigation strategy will be built into \nprogram management. Risks are of two broad categories: controllable within the Program, and \nexternal  and  not  controllable.  Risks  within  the  control  of  the  Program  include  weaknesses  in \n\n                                                 \n26 See also para. 117. \n27 Appendix 6, para. 22. \n28 Risk mitigation measures are in Appendix 11. \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\nfrom \n\ndesign,  poor  management  and  implementation,  weak  capacity  and  inadequate  skills,  and \ninsufficient  resources  for  implementation.  Risks  that  may  be  controllable  include  inadequate \npolitical  commitment  and  agreement,  inadequate  commitment  and  leadership  from  civil \nservants,  inadequate  enforcement  of  legislation  and  government  orders,  and  a  deteriorating \nfiscal  position.  Uncontrollable  risks  are  mainly  political  and  those  resulting  from  public  action \nagainst reforms.  \n \n98. \nControllable Risks. Given the overarching nature of the Program, it may be considered \nto  be  ambitious  and  complex.  The  Program  is  the  product  of  lengthy  consultations  with  the \nKerala  government.  The  program  components  have  been  selected \nthe  Kerala \ngovernment\u2019s reform agenda, which is a combination of agreements with the Government and \nthe  state\u2019s  MGP.  It  was  subjected  to  extensive  peer  review  in  India  and  draws  heavily  on \nrecommendations  from  TAs,  and  national-  and  state-level  expert  committee/commission \nreports.  Any  program  attempting  to  address  the  systemic  problems  of  a  state  government  is \ninevitably  complex.  Adopting  a  simplistic  approach  is  likely  to  lead  to  superficial  changes  with \nlittle benefit. The Kerala government is implementing the Program and has committed to time-\nbound  milestones  in  agreements  with  the  central  Government.  The  Program  reflects  shared \npriorities  of  the  central  and  Kerala  governments.  The  cluster  approach  and  monitoring  and \nmidterm review arrangements will provide an opportunity for program risks to be assessed and \nappropriate  action  to  be  taken,  and  will  allow  subprogram  2  to  be  designed  based  on  the \nexperiences of subprogram 1.  \n \n99. \nOften  reform  programs  fail  because  of  weak  administrative  capacity  and  inconsistent \nleadership. Kerala is one state where the overall caliber of the public servants is high and which \nhas a critical mass of civil servants who regard themselves as development activists who must \nreduce poverty in the state. Their track record has been very good. By adopting a development \napproach  for  its  reform  agenda,  the  Kerala  government  has  created  incentives  to  mobilize  a \ncommitted group of people to take the Program forward. Introducing a service-oriented culture, \nimplementing  modern  budget  and  expenditure  management  systems,  adopting  the  MTFF \napproach,  designing  new  legislation,  and  carrying  out  functional  reviews  will  require  learning \nnew  skills  and  relinquishing  old  administrative  practices.  Although  TA  covers  these  activities, \nstrong administrative leadership with ministerial support will be needed to attain targets.  \n \n100.  To ensure maximum support and appropriate authority and accountability, the Program \nis  located  in  the  center  of  the  Kerala  government  and  under  the  chief  secretary.  A  cabinet \nsubcommittee is chaired by the chief minister, who oversees and directs the program.  \n \n101.  To  ensure  that  legislation  and  government  orders  are  enforced  and  rules  obeyed,  all \npolicies, \nthe  Program  will  have \nimplementation,  monitoring,  and  enforcement  mechanisms  built  into  them.  The  continuing \nchallenge will be to ensure that these measures change behavior.  \n \n102.  Political  Risks.  The  coalition  government  has  a  5-year  mandate  with  3.5  years \nremaining and has solved some difficult reform issues. The Kerala government is determined to \nmake  the  state  investor-friendly  and  sustain  achievements  in  meeting  the  social  indicators. \nHowever,  some  interest  groups  are  opposed  to  fiscal  and  structural  reform  and  they  do  not \nunderstand  the  costs  to  the  state  economy  of  continuing  with  status  quo  policies  even  though \nthe  various  measures  have  evolved  through  extensive  discussions  and  analysis  within  Kerala. \nThe Kerala government is developing a comprehensive communication strategy that will reach \n\nlegislation,  and  government  orders \n\nintroduced  by \n\n\f \n\n \n\n25 \n\nout to the various interest groups and secure their commitment.29 The cost of not implementing \nreforms,  and  the  potential  risks  to  present  and  future  livelihoods  will  be  well  understood  in  a \nstate that has high literacy.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n103.  The  central  and  Kerala  governments  have  given  the  following  specific  assurances,  in \naddition to the standard assurances, that will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \nA. \n\nPolicy Letter and Policy Matrix \n\n104.  The  Kerala  government  will  carry  out  the  policies  and  actions  in  accordance  with  the \nschedule  of  policy  reforms  contained  in  the  Policy  Matrix  as  agreed  upon  between  the  Kerala \ngovernment, ADB and the Government of the Netherlands, and ensure that these shall continue \nto be in effect for at least the duration of the Program.  \n \n105.  The Kerala government will ensure that the MGP secretary will be responsible for (i) the \ncoordination  and  management  of  the  Program;  (ii)  report  to  the  State  chief  secretary;  and  (iii) \ncontinue in the position on a fulltime  basis for a reasonable duration to ensure continuity in the \nimplementation of the Program. \n\nB. \n\n  \nCounterpart Funds \n\n106.  The  central  Government  will  transfer  the  counterpart  funds  generated  under  the  Loan, \nunder  the  normal  arrangements  for  transferring  external assistance to the Kerala government \nand  shall  treat  such  counterpart  funds  as  an  additionality  to  its  transfers  allocated  annually  to \nthe state. \n \n107.  The  Kerala  government  will  make  available  on  a  timely  basis,  the  counterpart  funds \nrequired for the Program. The Kerala government will use the counterpart funds to finance the \ncost  of  structural  adjustment  under  the  Program.  In  this  regard,  the  Kerala  government  will \nprovide budget appropriation/allocation to release necessary funds as required for the Program, \nincluding  inter  alia  for  the  implementation  of:  (i)  the  Kerala  government\u2019s  policies  on  asset \nrenewal,  service  delivery  and  social  audit;  (ii)  personnel  and  payroll  computerization;  (iii)  LSG \naction plan; (iv) capacity building and training in financial management for LSGs and community \norganizations; and for (v) support of MGP\u2019s administrative and program management expenses, \nthe  service  delivery  policy  unit,  functional  review  unit  and  the  costs  associated  with  the \ncoordination of the implementation of the detailed implementation plans of the SIPs. \n \nC. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n108.  The Kerala government will keep ADB and the Government of the Netherlands informed \nof, and the Kerala government, ADB and the Government of the Netherlands will from time to \ntime exchange views on, the progress made in carrying out the policies and actions set out in \nthe  Policy  Letter  and  the  Policy  Matrix  in  the  formulation  and  implementation  of  new  policies \naffecting the Program. \n \n\n                                                 \n29 Information on the Kerala government\u2019s communication strategy is contained in Appendix 1. \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\n109.  The  Kerala  government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other \ninternational and bilateral aid agencies and will allow ADB to comment on the same in so far as \nthese affect the Program.  \n \n110.  The Kerala Government will continue policy dialogue and regularly exchange views and \ninformation  with  ADB  and  the  Government  of  the  Netherlands,  on  problems  and  constraints \nencountered  during  implementation  of  the  Program  and  on  changes  to  overcome  or  mitigate \nsuch problems and constraints. \n \nD. \n\nDetailed Implementation Plan under the SIPs \n\n111.  The Kerala government will approve and notify the detailed implementation plan30 (i) by \nnot  later  than  31  December  2002,  for  the  first  12  months  of  the  Program;  and  (ii)  by  not  later \nthan  31  December  2003,  for  the  next  12  months  of  the  Program.  The  Kerala  government  will \nalso  ensure  that  the  Program  is  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  detailed  implementation \nplans. \n \n112.  The  Kerala  government  will  take  all  steps  and  actions,  including  provision  of  staff \nresources  and  funds  to  ensure  satisfactory  completion  in  a  timely  manner  of  all  outputs  in  the \ndetailed implementation plans, as referred to in preceding paragraph.  \n \nE. \n\nCommunity and Stakeholders Consultation and Participation \n\n113.  The  Kerala  government  will  ensure  that  the  relevant  components  of  the  Program  are \nimplemented  in  consultation  with  and  participation  of  the  community,  stakeholders  and \ncommunity representatives such as the non-government and community-based organizations. \n \n114.  Without  limiting  the  generality  of  the  preceding  paragraph,  the  Kerala  government  will \nensure that appropriate institutional mechanisms are in place for communication and feedback \non the relevant policy actions from the community and stakeholders. \n \nF. \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\n115.  The Kerala government will ensure that in carrying out the policy measures and activities \nincluded  under  the  Program  and  the  Policy  Matrix,  due  consideration  will  be  given  to  the \nfindings and recommendations of any related technical assistance. The Kerala government will \nconsult  with  and  keep  ADB  and  the  Government  of  the  Netherlands  informed  on  the  findings \nand  recommendations  of  the  technical  assistance  as  may  be  provided  by  other  bilateral \nagencies in relation to the Program. \n \n116.  The  Kerala  government  will  allow  ADB  and  the  Government  of  the  Netherlands  to \nprovide  their  comments  on  the  findings  and  recommendations  of  the  TA  referred  to  in  the \npreceding paragraph, for consideration in the policy measures and other activities, as mutually \nacceptable to the Kerala and Netherlands governments and ADB. \n \n\n                                                 \n30  This is an expansion of the Strategic Implementation Plans as approved by the Kerala government. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n27 \n\nG. \n\nMutual Consultations  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n117. \nThe Kerala and Netherlands governments and ADB will exchange and draw on, \nin a timely manner, the necessary information and resources, in the formulation and finalization \nof tranche outputs and implementation thereof, as included in the Policy Matrix and SIPs.  \n \n \nIn formulating the tranche outputs as indicated in clause (i) of this paragraph, and \nthe  reform  measures  under  the  Program,  including  in  the  Loan  Agreement,  the  Kerala \ngovernment  will  ensure  that  the  findings,  recommendations,  and  mitigation  measures  of  the \nIPSA,  including  follow-up  action  therein,  are  carried  out  during  Program  implementation,  all  in \naccordance with clause (i) of this paragraph. \n \nH. \n\nPower Sector Reforms \n\n118.

The ratio of interest payments to total state revenue rose from 17.5% in FY1994 to \n21.3% in FY2002. State fiscal performance deteriorated substantially from FY1998 to FY2000, \nleading  to  a  record  gross  fiscal  deficit  of  7%  of  the  gross  state  domestic  product  (GSDP)  in \nFY2000.  Although  some  indicators  of  budget  performance  have  since  improved,  the \nfundamental  threat  of  a  deepening  fiscal  crisis  remains  because  of  unresolved  contingent \nliabilities caused by deteriorating finances of state-owned enterprises and boards, and because \nof the deferral of structural government reforms needed to ensure efficient and effective service \ndelivery.  Indeed,  the  stock  of  state-level  public  enterprises  (SLPEs)  debt  with  guarantee  has \ngrown  at  an  accelerated  rate  in  the  last  2  years.  With  support  from  the  central  Government, \nprogress  is  being  made  in  strengthening  incentives  for  states  to  undertake  fiscal  reforms,  and \nthe Kerala government has responded to these incentives by committing itself to an ambitious \nreform agenda.  \n \n2. \nAlthough a strong fiscal correction is necessary to restore state finances to a sustainable \npath, higher real growth could also strengthen fiscal performance. The real annual growth rate is \nestimated to be 5.7% in FY1994\u2013FY2001,1 but the corresponding rate for the primary sector is a \nmere 2.2%. Kerala\u2019s traditional economic base, consisting of agriculture and related processing \nindustries, is adjusting with difficulty to increased competition. Kerala's main remaining engines \nof  economic  growth  are  remittances  from  nonresident  workers,  and  the  burgeoning,  but  still \nsmall,  tourism  and  information  technology  (IT)  industries.  However,  these  growth  sectors  and \nsources  of  spending  provide  few  opportunities  and  benefits  for  the  poor,  who  derive  their \nlivelihood overwhelmingly from agriculture, fishing, and associated basic processing industries. \nThe state has not attracted much secondary manufacturing despite its highly skilled workforce.  \n \n3. \nMaintaining  real  annual  growth  at  5\u20136%  and  continuing  to  reduce  poverty will depend \ncritically  on  the  state\u2019s  ability  to  provide  key  infrastructure  support  to  industry  and  agriculture \nand  to  ensure  adequate,  well-targeted,  and  high-quality  supplies  of  social  services  such  as \neducation and primary health. Addressing the  fundamental structural issues undermining state \nfinances  thus  appears  to  be  key  to  restoring  sustainable  finances  and  establishing  solid \ngovernment support for renewed broad-based and pro-poor growth for the entire economy.  \n \nB. \n \n4. \nThe  uncontrolled  growth  of  government  guarantees  for  borrowing  by  public  sector  and \nother  bodies  has  emerged  as  one  of  the  state\u2019s  most  important  fiscal  problems.  Borrowings \nguaranteed  by  the  Kerala  government  totaled  Rs118  billion  by  end  March  2002,  equivalent  to \n15.2% of GSDP. Guarantees have grown in magnitude primarily due to inadequate commitment \nto  cover  costs  in  power,  and  weak  financial  control  over  key  state-level  public  enterprises \n(SLPEs) and boards. The risk of a substantial proportion of these guarantees being called has \nincreased because guarantee-backed loans have been used recently to fund operating deficits \nand working capital to loss-making enterprises, rather than projects yielding a healthy social rate \nof  return.  Another  type  of  contingent  liability  for  the  Kerala  government  is  its  pension  burden, \n\nConstraints and Issues in Developing a Sustainable Fiscal Strategy  \n\n                                                 \n1  Department of Economics and Statistics, Planning Board, Government of Kerala. 2002 unpublished estimates. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n31 \n\nwhich is rising rapidly due to increased life expectancy of retirees and the age profile of the civil \nservice.  \n \n5. \nFiscal  deficits  are  also  mounting  because  Kerala,  like  many  other  Indian  states,  has \nadopted  deficit  financing  methods  that  soften  budget  constraints,  including  increased  reliance \non  guarantees;  overdraft  facilities  from  the  central  bank;  funds  from  the  public  accounts, \nespecially through state provident funds; and the building up of arrears to contractors.  \n \nThe  Government  is  committed  to  reducing  off-budget  borrowings  by  implementing \n6. \nfundamental  structural  reform  to  restore  the  financial  health  of  public  sector  enterprises  and \nboards,  led  by  regulatory  reform  of  the  power  sector.  However,  until  substantial  progress  is \nmade  in  structural  and  regulatory  reforms,  reporting  of  off-budget  borrowing  in  budget \ndocuments  and  adhering  to  the  guarantee  caps  will  ensure  awareness  by  the  public  and \nauthorities of the true multiyear implications of financing decisions. \n \n7. \nThe  2001  White  Paper  on  State  Finances  identified  expanding  wage  and  salary \nexpenditures, and pensions relative to revenues as a major reason for fiscal deterioration. The \nnumber  of  Kerala  government  employees,  including  teachers  in  government  institutions, \nincreased from 270,000 in FY1981 to 332,000 in FY2000. With another 146,000 employees in \naided  institutions,  local  bodies,  and  SLPEs,  the  total  number  of  government-supported \nemployees  in  FY2000  was  478,000.  However,  expenditure  needs  have  not  been  aligned  with \nfundamental demographic changes such as student enrollment, which dropped from 6.5 million \nin  1990  to  around  5.6  million  in  FY2002.  Excessive  hiring  of  teachers  has  resulted  in  an \nestimated 22,000 teachers without adequate work.  \n \n8. \nA  public  consensus  is  emerging  in  favor  of  national  and  state  policies  on  fiscal \nresponsibility  to  reduce  debt,  limit  borrowing,  and  rationalize  public  expenditure.  Draft  fiscal \nresponsibility  legislation  is  under  consideration  in  a  number  of  states,  including  Kerala,  and  at \nthe national level. The intent of these legislative initiatives is to establish much higher standards \nfor  government  fiscal  reporting  and  potentially,  as  in  the  case  of  draft  central  legislation,  to \nestablish  specific  multi-year  targets  for  deficit  reduction  linked  to  triggers for intrayear targets. \nTo  promote  fiscal  discipline  and  transparency  at  the  state  level,  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India,  in \ncollaboration  with  a  committee  of  state  officials,  has  also  issued  guidelines  to  the  states  on \ncapping guarantees and improving transparency of state budgets.  \n \n9. \nTo hold its soft budget incentives in check, the Kerala government has prepared a policy \non  capping  guarantees  and  on  establishing  a  guarantee  redemption  fund  with  associated \nguarantee fees. The Kerala government has also introduced provisions to avoid future build-up \nof  arrears  in  the  power  sector  by  agreement  to  ensure  that  the  Kerala  State  Electricity  Board \n(KSEB)  stays  current  in  payments  to  central  utilities.  Better  financial  management,  including \ndebt management, for public enterprises, boards, and other agencies will be needed to improve \nthe  quality  of  loans  so  that  over  the  medium  term,  the  guarantee  fees  will  be  sufficient  to \ncompensate assumed risks.  \n \nThe  Kerala  government  has  initiated  a  strategy  to  greatly  improve  public  finances  by \n10. \ndeveloping a medium-term fiscal framework in consultation with the central Government. Under \nthe  medium-term  fiscal  reform  program  introduced  by  the  Kerala  government  in  2001,  the \ncentral  Government  has  sought  to  establish  a  consistent  multi-year  framework  for  fiscal \nmanagement.  These  measures  propose  to  bring  about  a  surplus  in  revenue  budget  and  to \nreduce gross fiscal deficit and public debt to sustainable levels within 5 years. Other announced \nreforms  with  a  likely  fiscal  impact  are  the  establishment  on  17  November  2002  of  an \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nExpenditure Management and Budgeting  \n\nindependent power sector regulator to determine tariff awards, the introduction of value-added \ntax (VAT) in 2003, and the partial freezing of recruitment.  \n \nC. \n \n11. \nThe  budget-making  system  and  supporting  institutional  framework  for  expenditure \nmanagement and control do not encourage efficiency. The development of a modern budgetary \nsystem  that  will  deliver  sustainable  fiscal  outcomes  to  better  match  needs  and  resources  has \nbeen supported under the Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance (TA).2 The TA \nadvisory  work  and  state\u2019s  own  reform  initiatives  have  been  merged  into  a  multiyear strategic \nimplementation plan (designed as part of Modernizing Government Program [MGP]) for phased \nimprovement on budgetary and expenditure management policies and institutional renewal. \n \n12. \nFiscal stress has been worsened by a rigid approach to budgeting, implicit reliance on a \nsupply-driven  priority  setting,  and  an  intent  to  maximize  the  size  of  the  plan  independently  of \nresource constraints. An imbalance between policy objectives and available resources is at the \nheart  of  much  of  the  financial  indiscipline  and  weaknesses  in  operational  performance. \nAggregate financial discipline of the budget process is weak, and hard expenditure targets are \nundermined  by  the  practice  of  permitting  up  to  three  supplementary  budgets.  The budgeting \nprocess  does  not  evaluate  the  incremental  recurrent  costs  of  plan  projects,  nor  does  it \nencourage departments to make trade-offs among alternative current and capital uses of funds. \nExcept  in  formulation  of  the  5-year  plan,  the  current  institutional  approach  to  budgeting  is \ninflexible.  Institutional  processes  to  review  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  programs  are \nunderdeveloped.   \n \n13. \nFiscal  transparency  is  also  inadequate,  leading  to  weak  financial  control.  A  major \ncontributor is the practice of booking unspent allocations to departments as spent at the end of \neach  fiscal  year.  The  lack  of  timely  reports  to  the  executive  and  legislative  branches  of \ngovernment  on  actual  annual  budget  outturns,  and  absence  of  midyear  fiscal  performance \nassessments  deprive  decision  makers  of  the  information  needed  to  make  informed  choices \nabout future spending and resource availability. Capital and maintenance outlays are also badly \nneglected under the current approach to budgeting, in part because of a lack of commitment to \nmulti-year budgeting. Maintenance suffers, particularly because nonwage recurrent expenditure \nprovides one of the few sources of discretionary spending. \n \nD. \n \n14. \nIn the past decade, the  growth of state tax and nontax revenues have not been buoyant \nbecause  of  the  difficulty  of  effectively  taxing  consumption  financed  by  foreign  remittances,  a \nweak  revenue  administration,  and  an  inadequate  commitment  to  periodic rate adjustment for \nuser  fees.  Sales  tax  and  stamp  duty  evasion  are  believed  to  be  high,  encouraged  by  the \nabsence  of  value-added  taxation  principles  in  the  former  case,  and  high  effective  rates  and \ncomplex procedures in the latter. The pressures to meet sales tax revenue targets and deterring \ntax evasion and avoidance have led to increased complexity of the system. \n \n15. \nThe  transformation  of  state-level  sales  tax  into  a  nationwide  system  of  state-operated \nVAT  is  now  proposed  to  take  effect  from  April  2003.  This  initiative,  in  which  Kerala  is \nparticipating,  is  intended  to  greatly  simplify  the  rate  structure  and  provide  additional  neutrality \nbenefits  to  interstate  harmonization  and  coordination.  This  shift  should  be  accompanied  by \n\nResource Mobilization \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to India for Supporting Fiscal Reforms in Kerala. Manila. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n33 \n\nCore Government Functions  \n\nimplementation of a general strategy for base broadening, including removal of exemptions, and \nrate  reduction.  With  the  adoption  of  VAT,  the  Kerala  government  intends  to  create  an \nenvironment  of  high  voluntary  tax  compliance  by  rationalizing  the  tax structure, modernizing \naudit procedures, raising public awareness, and training department personnel.  \n \n16. \nOther  fiscal  distortions  that  undermine  economic  efficiency  include  high  stamp  duties \nand inadequate use of property tax by local government. Stamp duties in excess of 13% have \ndistorted the supply of land and encouraged underreporting and nontransparent procedures in \nproperty valuation for conveyances. The Kerala government is replacing the current system of \nproperty  valuation  with  valuation  norms  developed  by  local  valuation  cells,  tied  to  objective \ncharacteristics of the properties.  \n \nE. \n \n17. \nCore  government  functions,  defined  as  those  having  an  impact  on  the  work  of  all \ngovernment  departments  as  well  as  policy  formulation  and  coordination  activities,  are \nrecognized  by  the  Kerala  government  as  requiring  major  renewal.  The  recent  diagnostic \nassessments  by  the  task  team  on  core  functions  of  government  prepared  for the modernizing \ngovernment  initiative  has  grouped  the  core  functions  into  (i)  policy  planning,  formulation,  and \ncoordination;  (ii)  human  resource  management;  (iii)  procurement;  (iv)  citizen  government \ninterface and service delivery; (v) information management; and (vi) government structures and \nintragovernment relations.  \n \n18. \nPolicy formulation and coordination pay insufficient attention to transparency and formal \nconsultation  processes.  Inadequate  attention  is  devoted  to  policy implementation enforcement \nand  monitoring  activities  to  review  the  impacts  of  changes.  Kerala  is  prone  to  policy \nfragmentation because of the state's many departments and linkages between line departments \nand local self-government (LSG) have not been  in the planning process, resulting in duplication \nin sector such as agriculture and allied activities. \n \n19. \nNorms for staffing civil service have not been fundamentally reviewed in many decades. \nThe  civil  service  thus  has  too  many  unnecessary  bottom-level positions, which contributes to \nexcessive staffing in major infrastructure departments such as irrigation and public works. Most \ngovernment  departments  have  no  clear-cut  job  definitions  and  responsibilities.  Functional \nreviews in each department will provide a basis for identifying the functions, skills, and staffing \nneeds  of  the  Kerala  government,  and  permit  the  authorities  to  gradually  transform  human \nresources  to  meet  the  state's  needs.  Frequent  transfer  of  senior  officers  reduces employee \nefficiency  as  well  as  opportunities  for  staff  to  develop  subject  matter  competencies.  Payrolls, \npensions, and personal records have not been computerized or linked, thus deterring effective \nmanagement  decision  making  on  human  resource  issues. No personnel resource information \ndatabase  exists  for  analyzing  the  financial  implications  of  new  initiatives  and  cost  of  service \ndelivery, or for addressing issues such as identifying and redeploying surplus staff.  \n \n20. \nThe diagnostic assessment indicates (i) the tendency to bypass prescribed procurement \nprocedures,  (ii)  a  low  level  of  delegation  of  tendering  and  quotation  activities,  (iii)  inadequate \ncommitment  to  ensure  transparent  and  competitive  processes  for  tendering,  and  (iv)  an \nemphasis  on  process  compliance  during  audit  rather  than  the  quality  of  the  product. \nProcurement  in  key  departments  such  as  public  works  is  characterized  by  underestimation  of \ncosts  for  the  delivery  of  works  as  evidenced  by  tendered  costs  relative  to  Public  Works \nDepartment  cost  estimates  and  numerous  examples  in  the  Accountant  General\u2019s  reports  of \nmajor cost overruns relative to original estimates.  \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nThe  Government  lacks  documentation  on  its  own  assets,  which  contributes  to  assets \n21. \ndeteriorating  through  lack  of  maintenance  and  prevents  sale  of  unwanted  assets.  Citizen-\ngovernment  interface  and  service  delivery  suffer  from  the  absence  of  a  result-based \nperformance-oriented public service. The lack of a service delivery framework specifying service \nstandards,  legitimate  delivery  channels,  and  procedures  for  accessing  service  delivery  means \nthat citizens have no basis for knowing their entitlements. Although citizen charters have been \nimplemented in several departments, these instruments have not had a major impact on service \ndelivery. The Kerala government needs to develop policies that indicate when it is appropriate \nor  permissible  to  consider  alternative  forms  of  service  delivery  or  procurement  to  improve \nefficiency  and  effectiveness.  Information  flowing  out  of  external  auditing  by  the  Office  of  the \nAccountant  General  might  be  used  as  an  important  tool  in  making  Government  more \naccountable to the people, but this resource is underutilized as a program-monitoring tool.  \n \nF. \n \n22. \nThe 73rd and 74th amendments to the Indian Constitution mandate the establishment of \nlocal governments as the third tier of government, and list the functions that state governments \ncan devolve to local governments.  Local governments are envisaged as partners of the central \nand state governments in development. The spirit of the Constitution demands creation of LSG \ninstitutions, implying a move toward greater autonomy. Poverty reduction is of prime concern for \nlocal governments. Kerala has gone much farther than any other state in transferring functions \nand  human  and \nfollowed  an  unorthodox  strategy  of \ndecentralization. Through a \"big bang\" approach, powers and  resources were transferred all at \nonce in 1995\u20131996.  \n \n\nfinancial  resources,  and  has \n\nLocal Self-Government  \n\n1. \n\nProblems and Current Situation Analysis3  \n\n23. \nLocal  governments  have  been  given  a  wide  range  of  development  responsibilities, \nincluding  agriculture  and  allied  sectors,  traditional industries, poverty reduction, social welfare, \nwomen\u2019s  development,  uplift  of  socially  disadvantaged  groups,  provision  of  connectivity, \nmanagement  of  health  and  educational  facilities,  environmental  sanitation,  and  provision  of \ndrinking  water.  To  meet  these  responsibilities,  local  governments  are  being  given  one  third  of \nthe  Kerala  government\u2019s  plan  resources.  However,  the  way  local  government  plans  for  and \nutilizes plan funds for development has a number of weaknesses and problems: (i) absence of a \nstrategic  vision  of  development;  (ii)  key  stakeholders  not  participating  in  the  planning  process; \nand (iii) schemes and plans often prepared as repetition of earlier government programs without \ncritical  analysis  of  the  current  situation,  resource  endowments,  potential  for  development,  and \nlikely returns. The methods adopted to choose schemes or fix priorities have been informal and \nnot based on interpretation of available data. Local governments have not been very successful \nin  planning  for  local  economic  development.  In  infrastructure,  particularly  in  providing \nconnectivity, proper spatial planning techniques are lacking. Local governments do not have a \nmaintenance  plan  for  the  assets  transferred  to  them  or  the  assets  created  by  them;  asset \nmanagement  is  weak.  Assets  that  have  not  been  maintained  have  been  transferred  from  the \nstate government, and budgets for operation and maintenance have not.   \n \n24. \nService delivery to the poor is affected by lack of clarity on whom to target, and how to \nprioritize different vulnerabilities among the poor. The list of people living below the poverty line \nis  inflated  due  to  political  and  bureaucratic  largesse  and  the  desire  to  corner  subsidies. \nSubsidies  are  thus  misdirected  and  spread  too  thin.  Targeting  failure  has  worsened \n\n                                                 \n3 This is a summary of the problem analysis in the MGP Issues Paper for LSGs. Kerala Government. 2002. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n35 \n\nindebtedness,  food  insecurity,  and  feminization  of  poverty.  LSGs  have  achieved  only  limited \nsuccess  in  natural  resource  management  to  increase  local  productivity.  The  progress  from \nwomen  in  development  to  gender  in  development  has  been  slow  in  respect  of  schemes \nearmarked for women. Similarly, planning has been deficient for socially disadvantaged groups \nsuch as scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and physically and mentally challenged groups.  \n \n25. \nService Delivery. Kerala's celebrated social sector achievements are threatened by the \nfiscal  crisis  and  emerging  social  tensions.  The  impact  is  more  prevalent  with  regard  to \naccessibility and affordability in the areas of health, education, food security, shelter, water, and \nsanitation, mainly due to lack of effectiveness and reach of the public service mechanisms and \naccompanying  tools.  Added  to  this  is  the  lack  of  proper  and  adequate  mechanisms  for \nmonitoring,  feedback,  evaluation,  and  reciprocal  enforcement.  The  problem  is  aggravated  by \nsuboptimal  utilization  of  public  funds  at  all  levels  of  the  state  machinery.  Overall  quality  of \ndelivery  of  services  is  affected  by  the  lack  of  perspective  and  accountability  of  the  delivery \nmechanisms  and  the  inability  of  the  poor  to  be  involved  in  community  processes  that  have  a \ndirect bearing on their well-being. The management of transferred institutions such as hospitals, \nschools, and transferred public offices is inadequate. Citizen interface with LSGs is not smooth \nas  the  procedures  for  service  provision  are  not  client  oriented.  Local  governments  have  not \ndeveloped a constructive relationship with nongoverment organizations. \n \nThe  important  issues  to  be  considered  in  health  care  provision  are  (i)  hospital \n26. \nmanagement; (ii) quality of primary health care; (iii) lack of doctors and paramedical staff in rural \nareas;  (iv)  centralized  procurement  procedures  with  no  delegation,  resulting  in  inadequate \nsupply of drugs, equipment, and other consumables; (v) centralized decision making, resulting \nin  delayed/inappropriate  actions;  and  (vi)  absence  of  a  system  for  accountability  and \nmeasurement of outcomes and impacts. The major issues that adversely impact the functioning \nof  government  and  aided  schools  are  ineffective  implementation  of  educational  policies, \nsuboptimal utilization of funds, inadequate local control and monitoring of education, attitudinal \nproblems of teachers, and absence of periodic reorientation of curriculum and syllabus. As part \nof the day-to-day administration, the public has to approach local governments for matters such \nas  obtaining  birth  and  death  certificates,  getting  building  licenses,  and  registering  institutions. \nHowever,  the  harassment  and  delays  the  public  faces  undermine  the  credibility  of  the  local \ngovernment system. \n\n \n27. \nFinancial  Management.  The  financial  management  by  local  governments  has \ntraditionally  been  weak.  A  coordinated  and  intensive  program  is  required  to  address  the \nfollowing problems:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  mode  of  assessment  of  property,  profession,  and  entertainment  taxes  is \ncumbersome  and  opaque.  This,  coupled  with  lack  of  clear  instructions  on  tax \nassessment,  has  affected  realization  of  taxes  due.  Nontax  revenue,  particularly \nthe fees, fines, and rates, are not revised as revision of rules is slow and difficult. \nCollection of user charges is weak. \nFiscal transfers from government are delayed due to the fiscal crisis. \nThe  systems  and  procedures  for  budget  preparation  and  budget execution are \nextremely  weak,  and  although  the  budgets  are  open  documents,  they  are  not \neasily  understood  by  the  layman.  The  accounting  system  is  cumbersome  and \nopaque. \nAudit  of  local  governments  is  not  independent  as  it  is  done  by  the  Local  Fund \nAudit Department under the Finance Department of the Kerala government. The \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\naudit  is  also  considerably  delayed,  its  quality  is  poor,  and  the  follow-up  on \nsuggestions is slow.  \n\n \n28. \nPublic Management. The administration of local governments has deteriorated over the \nyears  due  to  pressure  of  work,  absence  of  systems,  and  low  skill  of  personnel.  Local \ngovernments still follow outmoded office administration systems, which create opportunities for \ncorruption.  An  office  management  system  needs  to  be  established  and  rules  of  business  for \ntransacting  the  work  of  elected  bodies  need  to  be  in  place.  The  staffing  profile  of  local \ngovernments has not been changed despite significant additional responsibility. Redeployment \nof staff from the Kerala  government, based on the principle of work and worker going together, \nhas  not  been  completed,  resulting  in  staff  shortages,  especially  in  engineering  and  account \nkeeping.  The  placement  and  tenure  of  local  government  staff  is  not  based  on  any  norms, \naffecting  remote  local  governments,  which  have  unfilled  positions.  Local  government  control \nover  staff  is  uncertain,  and  procurement  is  very  slow  and  costly.  The  Public  Works  Manual, \nwhich  governs  execution  of  public  works  by  local  governments,  is  archaic  and  allows \ntremendous discretion to technical supervisors.  \n\n \n29. \nFunctioning  of  Institutions.  Kerala  adopted  the  model  of  setting  up  strong, \nindependent institutions, particularly to reduce state government control over local governments. \nSome  of  the  institutions  have  been  functioning  well.  However,  resources  are  needed  and  a \ncoordinated  program  of  action  is  required  to  deal  with  the  problems  facing  the  State  Election \nCommission,  State  Finance  Commission,  Ombudsman,  State  Development Council, appellate \ntribunals, and Kerala Urban Development Finance Corporation. The Rural Development Board \nhas  become  redundant,  and  the  district  planning  committees  have  not  shown  the  capacity  to \nplan in an integrated manner for the overall development  of the district. The Kerala Institute of \nLocal Administration, which is responsible for local government training, has insufficient capacity \nand no resources.   \n\n \n\nPolicy  Environment.  The  local  government  policy  environment has several problems: \n30. \n(i)  lack  of  functional  clarity  between  the  tiers  of  local  government  in  respect  of  agriculture  and \nallied  sectors;  (ii)  industries  and  poverty  reduction;  (iii)  ignorance  of  the  roles  of  different  state \ngovernment  departments  in  relation  to  local  governments;  (iv)  heads  of  departments  in  the \nKerala  government  not  willing  to  relinquish  responsibilities  to  local  governments;  (v)  continued \nexistence  of  parallel  structures  such  as  development  authorities;  (vi)  existence  of  parallel \nschemes,  especially  of  the  Agriculture  Department;  (vii)  functional  overlaps  between  the  rural \ndevelopment and LSG departments; and (viii) delays in implementing the recommendations of \nthe Second State Finance Commission. \n \n31. \nIn  response  to  the  comprehensive  analysis  of  problems  facing  local  government,  the \nKerala government has set up a special task team in MGP to develop and implement a project \nto support the institutionalization of the local government system. The task team has developed \na  strategic  implementation  plan  through  support  provided  by  the  Government  of  the \nNetherlands. The State Planning Board has also made a number of recommendations that the \nKerala  government  recently  approved,  concerned  with  institutionalizing  the  system  of  local \ngovernment. The resulting LSG action plan is key to the Program. The Swiss and Netherlands \ngovernments  are  helping  build  local  government  capacity,  and  the  World  Bank  is  funding \nresearch to look at the wider issue of sustainable fiscal decentralization.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n37 \n\nKerala Government Reform Achievements  \n\nG. \n \n32. \nSince  the  publication  of  the  White  Paper  on  State  Finances  in  2001,  the  Kerala \ngovernment has taken a number of measures to address the fiscal crisis and begin reform. The \nMGP steering committee, chaired by the chief secretary, was constituted in January 2002, and a \nfull-time MGP secretary was appointed to coordinate and manage the Program. A high-powered \ncommittee  is  developing  a  reform  package  for  the  power  sector,  and  a  committee  was \nestablished in early 2002 to promote economic development. An investors\u2019 meeting is planned \nfor  January  2003,  raising  awareness  of  the  private  sector  to  business  opportunities  in  Kerala. \nThe pilot project on \"bridging the digital  divide\" is an initiative being implemented by the Kerala \ngovernment  in  partnership  with  the  private  sector  in  Mallapurram  district.  The  objective  of  the \nproject is to improve IT literacy by having a structured capacity-building program to ensure that \nat least one member of every family in the state is able to send and receive electronic mail and \nto be able to use word processing and other basic IT tools. The other target is to ensure Internet \naccess within a radius of 2 kilometers for all families. A unique feature of the project is the major \nrole of the private sector and the minimal investment from the state government.   \n \n33. \nFiscal  Management.  The  Kerala  government  has  been  able  to  reduce  the  ratio  of \nconsolidated revenue deficits to revenue receipts by more than 17% during FY2001. The Kerala \ngovernment  has  received  the  incentive  fund  from  the  central  Government  (as  per  the  letter  of \nshared  fiscal  goals  and  objectives)  under  the  Medium-Term  Fiscal  Reform  Facility.  No  new \nposts have been created, and 55 schools that have few learners and meet the closure criteria \nhave been closed. The surrender of earned leave facility has been canceled and pension dues \nhave been reduced through a reworking of the commutation formula. The surplus staff initiative \nhas  identified  17,000  surplus  staff,  and  a  net  attrition  rate  of  1%  has  been  maintained  for  the \npast year. Government orders have been issued for not sanctioning any new aided educational \ninstitutions  and  for  freezing  expansion  of  state-run  and  aided  schools.  Higher  technical \neducation, including medical education, has been opened up for the private sector.  \n \n34. \nRevenue Mobilization. The Kerala government has taken several steps to augment tax \ncollection,  including  (i)  rationalization  and  simplification  of  tax  structure;  (ii)  improvement  and \nenhancement of tax compliance; (iii) faster disposal of appeals; (iv) speedy disposal of pending \ncases; (v) withdrawal of absolute stays granted by the Kerala government; (vi) computerization \nof  revenue  collection  systems;  (vii)  periodic  revision  of  user  charges,  and  (viii)  mobilization  of \nnational savings. The draft bill for levying a VAT, scheduled to be introduced in the Assembly in \nDecember 2002, will reduce the number of stages of appeal in tax dispute adjudication. \n \n35. \nPower  Sector.  The  Kerala  government  has  established  a  State  Electricity  Regulatory \nCommission.  A  tariff  hike  was  announced  in  early  October  2002,  estimated  to  reduce  KSEB\u2019s \nmonthly cash flow deficit by Rs350 million. \n \n36. \nOther Reforms. A program to reform the State Transport Corporation was initiated, and \nthe  Corporation's  monthly  losses  have  been  reduced.  An  interim  report  from  the  law  reform \ninitiative proposing repeal of 82 laws has been submitted for public comment. A draft bill on the \nright  to  information  is  being  vetted  by  the  Law  Department,  and  a  combination  of  measures \nreflected  in  the  new  IT,  industrial,  and  labor  policies  is  designed  to  improve  the  enabling \nenvironment for private sector investment.  \n \nLocal  Self-Governments.  The  Council  of  Ministers  has  approved  a  campaign  to \n37. \nstrengthen  LSGs,  particularly  by  improving  the  function  of  Grama  Sabhas and making elected \nheads  and  secretaries  of  LSGs  accountable  for  service  delivery  through  citizens\u2019  charters  and \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nsocial  audit.  The  antipoverty  subplan  policy  was  initiated  in  the  State's  Tenth  Five-Year Plan, \nand specific measures have been introduced to strengthen the planning processes in LSGs: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nintroducing  the 5-year planning system; \nallowing  LSGs  to  utilize  up  to  10%  of  the  funds  allocated  by  the  Kerala \ngovernment  for  asset  renewal  in  respect  of  schools,  hospitals,  and  rural  water \nsupply systems; \ndefining  through  consultation  the  minimum  standards  for  infrastructure  and \nservices for hospitals, schools, and anganwadis; and  \nincorporating  spatial  planning  aspects,  especially  while  deciding  plans  for  new \nroads. \n\n \nKerala Government Communications Strategy. A communications strategy has been \n38. \nprepared  to  improve  awareness  and  foster  a  better  understanding  of  the  Kerala  government's \nreform  plan.  The  strategy  will  comprise  awareness  building,  analysis,  and  debate.  The \ncampaign  will  increase  information  levels,  disseminate  material  regarding  the  Program,  and \nstimulate debate and analysis at all levels of civil society. A series of articles will be placed in all \nmajor newspapers (Malayalam and English) in the state.

form of a narrative and matrixes\u2014presents a preliminary assessment \nof the nature and magnitude of the likely impact on the poor of the reforms proposed under the \nprogram  loan.  The  changing  poverty  situation  resulting  from  each  component  of  the  reform \nprogram needs to be studied to assess the full impact in the short-run as well as in the medium \nrun.1 \n \nA. \n \n1. \nKerala  is  well  known  for  its  high  levels  of  literacy,  especially  among  females,  and  low \ninfant  mortality  (12  per  1,000  live  births  in  1997).  Such  achievements  are  thought  to  be  made \npossible  through  \"public  action  promoting  a  range  of  social  opportunities  relating  inter  alia  to \nelementary  education,  land  reforms,  role  of  women  in  society,  and  widespread  and  equitable \nprovision of health care and other public services.\"2 While the poverty level was comparable to \nthe  all-India  level  until  the  early  1980s,  reduction  since  then  has  been  rapid, reaching 13% in \nFY2000. \n \n2. \nKerala, with a per capita gross state domestic product (GSDP) of $450 , has done well in \neconomic growth during the last 30 years compared to many other states, but its progress has \nnot been commensurate with the high human capabilities built over the years. This growth has \nlargely  been  led  by  the  tertiary  sector,  the  share  in  GSDP  of  which  increased  from  32%  in \nFY1971to  58%  in  FY2001.3 The share of the secondary sector has shown hardly any change \nand  remains  around  21%.  The  rapid  growth  of  the  tertiary  sector  has  been  beneficial  to  the \npoor,  and  studies4  show  that  higher  farm  yields,  higher  state  development  spending,  higher \nnonfarm  output,  and  lower  inflation  all  reduced  poverty.  Nonfarm  output  alone had differential \nelasticities  across  the  states,  and  substantially  higher  elasticity  for  Kerala.  Urbanization  in  an \narea will reflect the higher nonfarm growth, and the poor are expected to gain when they live in \na more urbanized area. Kerala is not highly urbanized. Over 40 years the level of urbanization \nhas increased from 15% to 26%, with the bulk of the increase taking place during 1981\u20131991. \nThe most urbanized districts have over two thirds of the main workers in the nonprimary sector, \nand the least urbanized districts have less than one fourth in the nonprimary sector.  \n \n3. \nIn  Kerala  the  dependence  of  scheduled  caste  and  scheduled  tribes  on  agriculture  is \nmuch  higher  than  in  many  other  states.  The  proportions  overall  become  very  low  for  the \nscheduled tribe population, and the relationship has also become very weak with urbanization. It \nis  evident  that  while  scheduled  caste  population  is  able  to  take  advantage  of  urbanization,  to \nsome  extent  scheduled  tribe  population  is not. Districts with large numbers of scheduled tribe \nare the least urbanized and have shown practically no urban growth over the last 40 years.5 \n \nThe lower urbanization and poor nonfarm growth in many districts have gone along with \n4. \npoor access to some of the basic services by the poor and higher dependence on agricultural \nlabor.  The  least  urbanized  districts  have  a  higher  proportion  of  poor  families  dependent  on \n\n                                                 \n1 Centre for Development Studies, Thiruvananthapuram. \n2  Dreze,  Jean  and  Amartya  Sen.  1995. \n\nUniversity Press. \n\nIndia:  Economic  Development  and  Social  Opportunity.

A  much  higher  proportion  of  poor  households  in  the northern districts do not have \nelectricity.  While  close  to  50%  of  households  below  the  poverty  line  in  the  districts  south  of \nThrissur  (except  Idukki  and  Pathanamthitta)  have  electricity,  the  proportion  of  houses  with \nelectricity  is  less  than  35%  in  most  northern  districts.  Despite  efforts  at  equitable  public \nprovision, inequalities are strikingly high in Kerala.  \n \n5. \nThe massive public spending for public provision of services and production activities in \nthe  public  sector,  and  poor  returns  have  led  to  fiscal  stress  in  Kerala  since  the  1980s.  The \nKerala  government\u2019s  revenue  account  registered  deficits,  and  development  and  revenue \nexpenditures  had  to  be  financed  by  borrowing.  By  the  late  1990s,  Kerala  had  high  debt-to-\nGSDP  ratio,  numerous  infrastructure  projects  in  the  public  sector  were  incomplete  for  many \nyears,  existing  infrastructure  was  not  maintained,  state-level public enterprises (SLPEs) were \ndraining government resources, an inefficient Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) was heavily \ndependent on government resources for survival, and public administration was unresponsive. \nOne bold policy initiative taken in Kerala following the 73rd and 74th amendments to the Indian \nConstitution  was  decentralization.  One  third  of  the  plan  funds  were  devolved  to  local  self-\ngovernments  (LSGs),  many  sectors  were  brought  under  their  administrative  control  and \nmandated  to  carry  out  local  planning  for  social  justice.  This,  too,  was  left  in  limbo  by  the \nincomplete transfer of powers, budgets, and personnel to the LSGs for some time. \n \nThe external debt crisis of 1991 led India to adopt an adjustment program, which sought \n6. \nto  bring  down  the  fiscal  deficit  by  reducing  subsidies  and  support  for  public  sector  enterprises \nand infrastructure projects, and by curtailing unproductive expenditure. The reforms at the state \nlevel  focused  on  sales  tax  administration,  property  tax,  expenditure  cuts,  and  SLPEs.  Three \nsectors (power, health care, and LSGs) have come under  major reform efforts in at least some \nof the states following the adjustment program. \n \n7. \nthe state was faced with the following issues: \n  \n\nGiven the crisis within the Kerala government and the larger reform environment outside, \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nShould the Kerala government continue with the numerous functions, beyond the \ngovernance and developmental functions, entailing huge financial liabilities? \nShould  the  Kerala  government  carry  out  functions  in  the  conventional  way, \nentailing huge costs and breeding inefficiencies? \nHow  to  take  advantage  of  the  environment  created  by  the  constitutional \namendments for decentralization of governance and development? \nHow to carry out the poverty reduction and social security programs efficiently? \n\n \n8. \nThe Kerala government drew up the Modernizing Government Program (MGP) to make \nthe state a model of good governance that would be fully responsive to the needs of a modern, \nmarket-oriented economy and democratic society. \n \nB. \n \nOne  of  the  major  objectives  of  MGP  is  to  bring  down  the  Kerala  government\u2019s \n9. \nexpenditures and make them more efficient and effective so that larger social gains accrue over \nthe long run. Policies may be categorized under four broad headings: \n \n\nModernizing Government Program and Policy Orientation  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nreducing liabilities of the Kerala government; \nmaking government spending more productive and efficient; \ntargeting  poverty reduction and making it more efficient; and \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n(iv)  maximizing revenue receipts. \n\n \n10.  While all policy measures essentially serve the larger goal, how it is achieved is critical \nfor  the  level  of  acceptance  of  policy.  For  instance,  power  sector  reforms  are  arrived  at  on  the \nbasis  of  agreements  signed  between  the  central  and  Kerala  governments;  SLPE  reforms  are \narrived at on the basis of an approach paper, which takes into account the various dimensions \nof the problem and analysis; and surplus staff identification and redeployment have their basis \nin  the  administrative  reforms  committee's  deliberations  and  reports.  However,  such  approach \npapers or detailed studies do not necessarily support policy measures such as the new budget \ncycle. Sensitization of the different administrative departments to the modalities of new budget \npreparation  at  one  level  is  needed,  and  policy  statements  for  the  different  sectors  at  another \nlevel.  \n \na  The  Kerala  Government\u2019s  Initiative.  The  budget  and  expenditure  reform  component  of \nMGP  will  be  implemented  in  all  departments,  including  the  Secretariat.  One  of  the  main \nfeatures of the new budget and expenditure management system is to give departments a \ngreater  degree  of  flexibility  to  determine  priorities  within  a  resource  envelope  that  is  made \navailable before budget preparation.   \n\n \n11. \nTermination of infrastructure projects over 5 years old per se may lack economic logic. \nMere  delay  cannot  justify  closing  down  a  project.  In  developing  the  criteria  for  closing \ninfrastructure projects, the sector policy should be considered. Economic considerations need to \nbe  incorporated  in  administrative  decisions  regarding  the  future  of  incomplete  infrastructure \nprojects. \n \na  The  Kerala  Government\u2019s  Initiative. The infrastructure policy document has gone some \nway to taking care of the concerns raised through the inclusion of specific criteria to support \nidentification and evaluation.  Criteria will be expanded and made specific during the course \nof developing sector specific guidelines.  \n\n \n12. \nThe  lack  of  a  sector  policy  is  glaring.  While  the  need  for  the  Kerala  government  to \nconfine itself to core functions is thought through, service delivery as incorporated in the policy \nmatrix is too broad, and the specificity of sectors and the problems arising therein have not been \nanalyzed.  Two  major  problems  of  the  health  sector,  for  example,  are  the  highly  unequal \ndistribution of public health care facilities across districts, and the distinction between \u201cdelivery \nof services\u201d and \u201caccess to services.\u201d Distribution inequality is serious enough to affect access \nto  secondary  health  care  services.  Equalization  might  require  vast  resources,  which  are  not \navailable.  \n \na  The  Kerala  Government\u2019s \n\nInitiative.  The  Kerala  Government  does  have  a   \n\ncomprehensive sectoral policy covering both economic and social development. This sector \npolicy is the Tenth Five Year Plan of Kerala which has a strong poverty reduction and health \nfocus as noted in the Development Policy Letter. The Kerala government has started work \non a sector policy for health, and health care initiatives in MGP are envisaged to inform the \nsector-wide  approach  for  health.  The  Kerala  government  also  wishes  to  develop  a  water \npolicy but is constrained by lack of resources and competing priorities.   \n\n \n13. \nAnother way of providing services is to incorporate the private health care sector into the \nsystem. For example, people may use the services of private facilities wherever they are easily \naccessible,  and  the  local  Panchayat  may  reimburse  the  cost  of  treatment.  Such  an  attempt \nwould  fit  in  with  one  a  principle  guiding  resource  transfer  to  LSGs.  The  basic  principle  that \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n69 \n\nshould guide the design of a system of intergovernmental transfers is not to finance particular \ngovernment  entities  but  rather  to  contribute  to  effective  provision  of  services.6 The question is \nespecially  relevant  because  in  Kerala,  close  to  70%  of  population  access  private  health  care \nservices,  and  even  the  very  poor  pay  for  services,  with  a  small  percentage  of  the  patients \ntreated for free. Expenditure is high.  \n \na  The Kerala Government\u2019s Initiative.  The  Kerala  government  is  considering  a  system  of \nequalizing the grants to LSGs in health, education, and water supply, and a study is being \ncommissioned through the  decentralization  support  program  to  inform  the  development  of \nthe new policy.  \n\n \n14. \nUnlike  power  sector  reform  and  SLPE  reform,  which  have  largely  come  from  sector \nanalysis,  the  reforms  of  the  second  category  seem  to  be  percolating  down  from  the  level  of \nmacro  expenditure  control.  Such  an  approach  raises  a  question:  Should  public  sector \nexpenditure  reform  begin  at  the  macro  level  and  percolate  down  to  the  sectors,  or  should  it \nbegin at the sector level? If the policy goal is a better allocation of scarce resources among and \nwithin sectors, then reform needs to begin at the sector level. \n \na  The Kerala Government\u2019s Initiative. The public expenditure-tracking survey envisaged in \nthe  service  delivery  policy  for  the  sectors  in  subprogram  2  should  allow  for  a  micro-level \nanalysis of sector-related expenditure to inform budget and expenditure management.   \n\nReform of State-Level Public Enterprises and Kerala State Electricity Board  \n\n \n15. \nTwo  major  initiatives  under  MGP\u2014strengthening  LSGs  and  the  poverty  reduction \nprogram\u2014do not seem  to  be  subject  to  the  policy  lacunae  mentioned  above.  The  measures \nproposed for strengthening LSGs are founded on the recommendations of the Sen Committee \nand the Second State Finance Commission. The poverty reduction programs are guided by the \nresearch  and  analysis  at  various  levels,  and  the  numerous  initiatives  at  the  micro  level  in  the \nstate. \n \nC. \n \n16. \nFrom the angle of the amount of the program loan going to different sectors, reforms of \nSLPEs and KSEB deserve emphasis. Kerala has the largest number of SLPEs in India (111 out \nof 1,071), employing about 125,000 people. While the 63 manufacturing SLPEs employ 53,270 \npersons,  22,234  are  employed \nindustries\u2014cashew,  coir,  and \nthree \nhandlooms\u2014and  8,850  are  in  the  nonmanufacturing  plantation  and  agro-industries.  Most \nenterprises impose a huge burden on the exchequer as they are making losses. SLPE reform is \ntherefore motivated by the need to redirect resources from the sector where the net social return \nis  negative  to  sectors  with  high  positive  social  benefits,  such  as  poverty  reduction  and  human \ndevelopment.  \n \n17. \nSLPE reforms do not have any fundamental conflict with the goal of poverty reduction, \neven  though  a  separated  public  sector  worker  most  likely  experiences  a  welfare  loss.  SLPE \nreforms as envisaged by the Kerala government involve considerable spending in the short run \nto  reap  benefits  in  the  long  run.  The  decision  to  undertake  such  reforms  should  be  analyzed \nwithin the framework of cost-benefit analysis. However, the approach implicit in the stated policy \n\ntraditional \n\nthe \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n6\n  Bird,  Richard  M.,  and  Ariel  Fiszbein.  1998.

Cambridge: \nCambridge University Press.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\ngoals  seems  to  focus  narrowly  on  returns  from  the  financial  point  of  view\u2014on  the  impact  of \nreforms on the budget deficit. This is indeed important, since SLPE reform is part of a broader \nadjustment  program.  However,  the  decision  should  also  consider  the  net  benefits  of  reforms, \nthat is, their impact on aggregate welfare and poverty. The overall assessment of SLPE reforms \nshould depend on whether financial or net social returns are used.  \n \n18. \nAlthough  the  broad  guidelines  for  SLPE  reform  have  been  outlined  in  the  approach \npaper,7 they do not address the issues specific to the enterprises that deal with plantation and \ntraditional  industries.  The  enterprise  reform  committee  (ERC)  proposes  to  take  these  up \nsubsequently. The case-by-case detailed proposals for units to be taken up for reforms are also \nyet to be completed. To assess the possible impact of such reforms on the poor, it is necessary \nto have these details. Although SLPEs in Kerala are generally spread over the entire state, their \nimportance  may  vary  depending  on  their  location.  SLPE  reforms  may  affect  the  rest  of  the \neconomy  not  only  through  their  fiscal  impact,  but  also  through  their  impact  on  private  sector \noutput and employment. A drastic reduction in employment in a public sector unit with a large \nshare of jobs in a particular region is likely to curtail private sector activity there.  \n \n19. \nOn  closer  scrutiny  this  production  externality  argument  appears  weak  in  a  number  of \ncases, which the ERC has already identified. To illustrate, Autokast and Kerala State Drugs and \nPharmaceuticals  together  received  Rs65  million  from  the  Kerala  government  soon  after  the \ndisinvestment  policy  was  announced  in  1991.  These  two  enterprises  are  in  Alappuzha  district \nand  together  have  only  about  600  employees.  The  approach  paper  rightly  notes  that  such  a \nhuge  amount  would  have  made  substantial  welfare  impact  in  a  district  like  Alappuzha  if  it  had \nbeen spent judiciously on several sectors. \n \n20. \nThe ERC\u2019s proposal to implement reforms in phases, focusing on 10\u201315 units in a phase \n(year),  is  likely  to  spread  out  thinly  over  a  long  stretch  of  time  whatever  production  externality \neffect  reforms  might  have.  In  this  context,  development  of  a  comprehensive  set  of  criteria  for \nprioritization  would  be  of  crucial  importance.  Overall,  restructuring  and  closure  of  SLPEs  like \nKerala State Drugs and Pharmaceuticals or Autokast will have no adverse impact on the poor \noutside  of  these  firms.  However,  most  employees  will  be  worse  off  even  with  a  \u201cgenerous\u201d \nvoluntary retirement scheme (VRS) package. Particularly vulnerable groups would be those who \nare likely to fall into the poverty trap as a result of poor health, which is expensive to treat as the \nbenefits such as the Employees\u2019 State Insurance will no longer be available. A comprehensive \nsocial safety net (SSN) is needed. Although it shows great care and sensitivity to the complexity \nof SLPE reforms, the ERC approach paper has not visited SSN issues.  \n  \n21. \nThe  goal  of  making  KSEB  financially  self-sufficient,  which  would  necessarily  require \ndrastic reduction in subsidy to different categories of consumers, will not have adverse impact \non the poor, simply because the bulk of the subsidy now goes to the nonpoor. An analysis of the \nconsumption pattern of electricity and the subsidy received through the current tariff structure by \ndifferent income groups in Kerala shows it is the middle class, not the poor, that stands to lose \nfrom  any  move  toward  cost  recovery.8  About  half  the  total  power  sold  by  KSEB  goes  to \ndomestic consumers. Those who consume up to 20 units receive a very small share of the total \nsubsidy.  Nearly  40%  of  households  do  not  have  electricity  connections,  and  most  poor \nhouseholds belong to this group. The progress of providing new connections, which is expected \n                                                 \n7  Enterprises  Reform  Committee.  2002.

The Impact of Costs and Benefits of Non-Reform \non  the  Politics  of  Reform:  A  Case  Study  of  Power  Sector  Reforms  in  Kerala  between  1996  and  2000.  Paper \npresented at the seminar for The Politics of Economic Reform in India, Hyderabad, April 2002.  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n71 \n\nSuggestions on How to Carry Out Poverty and Social Analysis in Kerala \n\nto benefit this group, has been such that even after 10 years about a quarter of all households \nwill remain unconnected. Although KSEB reform is necessary for faster connection, reform does \nnot guarantee it. Much will depend on how fine-tuned the tariff structure can be made so that the \npoor bear the least of the burden of cost recovery. Otherwise, even though KSEB may be more \nefficient after reform, the poor may still find electricity connections beyond their means.  \n \n22. \nThus, KSEB and SLPE reform, which account for a significant proportion of the cost of \nthe program loan, do not have a major adverse impact on the poor. One of the initiatives under \nthe  Medium-Term  Fiscal  Framework\u2014to  curtail  the  total  government  expenditure\u2014will \nadversely  affect  the  poor.  Such  adverse  impact  is  strongly  mitigated  by  two  comprehensive \ninitiatives  as  part  of  MGP:  the  LSG  action  plan  and  antipoverty  measures.  The  channels  of \npoverty  impact  have  been  worked  out  in  the  poverty  impact  matrixes  (1.1  to  1.6).  MGP  and \nfiscal reforms, including power sector reforms, will not have an adverse impact on environment \nor  lead  to  any  involuntary  resettlement  problems,  nor  trigger  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s \ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  policies.  Improved  efficiency  of  government \ndepartments  following  MGP  and  decentralization  might  help  implement  existing  stringent  laws \nagainst environmental pollution and land degradation.    \n \n23. \nThe impact of the reform on women will be diverse. SLPE reform might have an adverse \nimpact on women in some regions and some sectors, but overall the resources released should \nbe  beneficial  to  women.  Similarly,  the  poverty  reduction  schemes  and,  in  particular,  the \nKudumbasree and microcredit will benefit poor women.  \n \nD. \n \n24. \nThe  impact  of  the  proposed  reforms  has  been  assessed  within  the  framework  of  the \npoverty impact assessment matrix, which is a limited exercise, since the conclusions have been \ndrawn  on  the  basis  of  limited  data  and  various  earlier  studies  conducted  for  a  variety  of \npurposes.  A  seemingly  more  rigorous  approach  such  as  a  computable  general  equilibrium \nmodeling, assuming that the necessary inputs for such an exercise were available, would also \nbe of limited use. The matrix at least throws some light on the nature of the trade-off between \nshort-term adverse effects and medium-term likely improvements.  \n \n25. \nThe probable impact of reforms on the poor in the short run and how poverty develops \nover  time  will  depend  on  a  number  of  factors,  the  most  crucial  factor  of  which  is  the \neffectiveness of SSNs. Changing poverty resulting from each component of the reform program, \nwhich includes the mitigating measures, thus needs to be studied to assess the full impact in the \nshort and medium term. \n \n26. \nThe  most  important  indicator  for  assessing  poverty  situation  is  income or consumption \nexpenditure. The percentage of people below the poverty line is estimated on the basis of the \nlarge-scale  sample  surveys  of  household  consumption  expenditure  conducted  periodically  by \nthe National Sample Survey Organization. This data set can be used to estimate poverty rates \nonly  on  a  broad  aggregate  level.  At  the  local  level,  data  on  income  poverty  is  nonexistent, \nresulting  in  various  proxies  being  suggested.  Poverty  is  generally  defined  in  terms  of  multiple \ndimensions where the indicators range from asset holding or access to public services to school \nenrollment rate. The effects of a VRS or a one-time settlement cannot be assessed in the short \nrun  by  looking  at  withdrawal  of  children  from  school  if  education  remains  subsidized.  Thus,  a \nframework  must  be  designed  for  impact  analysis,  taking  into  account  the  specificity  of  the \nprogram as well as the regional context.  \n \n\n\f72 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nIn Kerala, unlike in other Indian states, individuals and households almost equally share \n27. \ncertain human development indicators across various income classes. The major impact on the \npoor is likely to be through changes in income-earning opportunities. Therefore, income remains \nthe most important indicator, at least in the short and medium run. But reliable income data is \ncostly to collect. Proxies are thus needed, and the benefit from using them has to be assessed \nin relation to the cost and benefit of using the original. If most of the proxies are very imperfectly \ncorrelated with the original, the original has to be used in spite of the high cost. Average number \nof  days  of  employment  along  with  real  wages  in  certain  main  occupations,  or  some  other \nindicators, may provide a good idea about income. A rigorous exercise is needed at the outset \nto identify indicators that are the best proxies of income poverty in Kerala. \n \nIt  is  possible  to  combine  various  indicators  to  form  a  suitable  poverty  and  social \n28. \nindividual \nmonitoring  system.  Various  government  and  nongovernment  agencies  and \nresearchers  have  made  numerous  attempts  to  do  so.  The  state\u2019s  Rural  Development \nDepartment recently collected data on a number of indicators at the household level to identify \nhouseholds  below  the  poverty  line.  The  success  of  this  massive  effort  is  mixed,  because \nadequate safeguards to minimize systematic misreporting were not built into the implementation \ndesign.  However,  with  innovative  methodological  approaches,  census  data,  along  with  such \nother sources as employment-unemployment surveys, agricultural censuses, surveys of small-\nscale industries, and so on, can be combined to form a poverty monitoring system. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n \n\nChannel of Effect \n\nLabor Market \n\nPrices  \n\nAccess \n\nNet Transfers  \nAnalytical Basis \nand/or \nAssumptions  \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n73 \n\nMatrix on Poverty Impact and Mitigation Assessment \n\nTable A6.1: Poverty Impact of VAT System, Property Tax  \n \nIndirect Effect, \nShort Run \n\nIndirect Effect, \nMedium Run \n\nDirect Effect, \nShort Run \n\nGroup Affected/ \nTargeted \n\nEnhancement \nand Mitigation \nMeasures \nTargeted poverty \nreduction \nprograms will \nbenefit the poor. \n\nNone \n\nAs revenue falls \nand public \nexpenditure \ndecreases, \ndemand will fall. \nWith falling \ndemand, prices of \nsome goods and \nservices will fall, \nbenefiting the \npoor. \n\nWith lower public \nexpenditure, \ndemand will fall. \n\nAs revenue \nincreases and \nspending rises, \ndemand will rise. \n\nAs government \nspending \nincreases, \nprices will begin to \nrise. \n\nWith falling \ndemand, prices of \na number of \ngoods and \nservices will fall, \nbenefiting the \npoor. \nFalling public \nexpenditure will \nadversely affect \naccess to public \ngoods and \nservices. \nNegative \n\n \n\nAccess will \nimprove with \nincreased public \nspending. \n\nFalling public \nexpenditure will \nadversely affect \naccess to public \ngoods and \nservices. \nNegative \nPublic  expenditure  is  beneficial  to  the  poor,  and  is  more  equitably  distributed  in  Kerala  than  in  other \nstates. \nValue-added  tax  (VAT)  and  property  tax  rationalization  will  have  an  immediate  negative  impact  on  tax \ncollection and government expenditure.

These  projections  will  form  inputs  into  the  Kerala \ngovernment\u2019s  FY2004  budget  in  the  context  of  the  medium-term  fiscal  framework  for  fiscal \nconsolidation.  The  reform  scenario  projections  though  FY2005  integrate  the  impact  of  the \nsubstantive  adjustment  costs  associated  with  the  Program,  estimates  of  future  deficits  for  the \nKerala State Electricity Board under independent regulatory supervision, and outlays to mitigate \nsocial  impact  of  the  adjustment  program,  including  remedial  operation  and  maintenance  and \nremedial capital expenditures for social infrastructure. \n \n2. \nProgram projections achieve (i) stabilization of the debt-to-gross state domestic product \n(GSDP) ratio and the state debt, plus power sector debt-to-GSDP ratio over the medium term; \n(ii)  a  gradual  decrease  in  revenue  deficit  to  1.46%  of  GSDP  by  FY2005;  and  (iii)  a  consistent \nimprovement  in  the  primary  balance  leading  to  a  primary  surplus,  starting  in  FY2004.  The \nprimary  balance  (deficit/surplus)  measures  how  current  actions  improve  or  worsen  Kerala \ngovernment\u2019s  net  indebtedness,  and  is  an  important  fiscal  indicator  for  evaluating  the \nsustainability of government deficits. Although a fiscal deficit can be run indefinitely, the primary \nbalance  should  eventually  become  positive  under  prudent  macroeconomic  assumptions  to \nensure that the primary surplus covers at least part of the interest on debt. \n \n3. \nThe  fiscal  aspects  of  the  Program  focus  on  (i)  consolidation  of  the  public  finances \nthrough revenue enhancement, notably by adopting a VAT; (ii) improvement in the \u201cquality\u201d of \nthe  fiscal  balance  by  focusing  on  the  composition  of  fiscal  adjustment,  including  increased \nborrowing through additional central assistance channels tied to expenditures for capital outlays \nand repair and maintenance; (iii) a minimum 1% rate of net attrition in consolidated employment \nlevels for civil servants and teachers over the term of the projections; (iv) a transparent subsidy \ndue  to  the  State  Electricity  Board  during  transition  to  full  cost  recovery  under  a  tariff-setting \nregime  with  an  independent  regulator;  and  (v)  identification  of  wasteful  expenditures  and \nnonmerit subsidies  during  subprogram  1  and  substantial  reduction  of  nonmerit  subsidies  with \nbetter targeting in subprogram 2. \n \nThe Program\u2019s fiscal aspects also reflect reversal of the compression of capital outlays \n4. \nof  earlier  years,  in  part  reflecting  outlays  associated  with  the  asset  renewal  fund.  Policy  on \nwinding  up  infrastructure  projects  that  do  not  meet  criteria  for  continuation  will  provide  fiscal \nspace  to  enhance  efficiency  of  capital  spending.  Increased  resource  mobilization  will  be \nachieved  over  the  medium  term  through  improvement  in  buoyancy  of  the  value-added  tax, \nstamp  duty,  and  property  tax;  strengthening  of  tax  administration;  and  improvements  in  cost \nrecovery for key own nontax revenue components with the nontax improvement being realized \nin  FY2005  after  the  Kerala  government  reviews  its  policies  and  administrative  procedures  for \nuser fee levying and collection.  \n \n5. \nThe  projections  are  based  on  prudent  macroeconomic  growth  assumptions  that  reflect \nrecent trends in all-India inflation and the trend in real growth rate of the Kerala economy. The \nprojections assume that nominal growth rate is 9.0% in FY2003 and subsequent years. Inflation \nis  assumed  to  remain  in  the  3\u20134%  range,  lowering  the  dearness  allowance  (cost  of  living \nadjustments  to  the  wage  bill)  and  pension  rate  increases,  both  indexed  for  inflation.  A  1%  net \nattrition rate, as announced by the Kerala government in its Letter of Shared Fiscal Goals and \nObjectives  addressed  to  the  central  Government,  is  assumed  to  be  in  place  for  the  entire \nprojection period, and average per employee compensation is assumed to increase by 5% per \nannum.  All-India  nominal  growth  rate  is  10%.  The  average  cost  of  borrowing  for  the  Kerala \n\n\f78 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\ngovernment  is  assumed  to  be  9%  from  FY2004  although  incremental  borrowing  costs  have \nrecently  been  noticeably  below  that  level.  The  debt  assumed  by  the  Kerala  government  as  a \nresult of its tripartite agreement on power sector has been integrated into state\u2019s debt stock.  \n \nThe reform table also reports projections for a single indicator, which can be monitored, \n6. \nproposed by the central Government to evaluate overall reduction in fiscal stress by capturing \nkey  off-budget  impacts  under  the  central  Government\u2019s  fiscal  reform  facility.  Rather  than \nfocusing  on  the  current  or  revenue  account  balance  from  the  budget  expressed  as  a  ratio  of \ntotal revenue receipts, this single indicator is the sum of the revenue receipts, deficit of the SEB, \nand the interest on off-budget guarantees, expressed as a ratio of state\u2019s revenue receipts.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n79 \n\nKerala Government Operations and Medium-Term Fiscal Framework \n(% of GSDP) \n \n\nRevenue Receipts (RR) \n\n12.30\n\n11.66\n\n12.24 \n\n12.70\n\n12.94\n\n  FY2001 FY2002\n\nFY2003  FY2004\n\nFY2005\n\nRevenue Expenditure \n\n16.74\n\n15.01\n\n14.80 \n\n14.60\n\n14.40\n\n    State own Tax Revenues  \n\n    Non Tax Revenue \n\n    Resources from the central Government \n\n    Grant Portion of Externally Assisted Projects  \n\nOf which: \n\n    Interest \n\n     Wages and Salaries  \n\n     Pensions and Retirement  \n\n     Devolution to local self-governments  \n     Of which: Non Revenue & Balance Sheet  \n     Clearing Components of Adjustment Costs  \n\n  \n\n8.27\n\n0.93\n\n3.10\n\n0.00\n\n3.18\n\n6.63\n\n2.72\n\n1.94\n\n7.62\n\n0.70\n\n3.33\n\n0.00\n\n3.20\n\n6.03\n\n2.37\n\n1.79\n\n7.87 \n\n8.12\n\n0.77 \n\n0.84\n\n3.29 \n\n3.24\n\n0.32 \n\n0.50\n\n3.24 \n\n3.25\n\n5.78 \n\n5.55\n\n2.14 \n\n2.05\n\n1.53 \n\n1.40\n\n0.77 \n\n0.63\n\nRevenue Deficit  \n\nCapital Expenditure \n\nFiscal Deficit \n\n(4.44)\n\n(3.35)\n\n(2.56) \n\n(1.90)\n\n(1.46)\n\n0.81\n\n5.47\n\n0.72\n\n4.21\n\n0.79 \n\n0.86\n\n3.35 \n\n2.77\n\nPrimary (Deficit)/Surplus  \n\n(2.50)\n\n(1.20)\n\n(0.14) \n\n0.70\n\nTotal Debt Stock \n\n36.24\n\n37.36\n\n37.47 \n\n36.98\n\n36.18\n\nInterest on outstanding guarantees  \n\n1.16\n\n1.15\n\n1.15 \n\n1.14\n\n1.14\n\nConsolidated Revenue Deficit (CRD)a \n\n(7.41)\n\n(5.20)\n\n(4.77) \n\n(3.53)\n\n(2.82)\n\nConsolidated Interest (interest on debt and on  \n\n4.34\n\n4.36\n\n4.39 \n\n4.39\n\n4.35\n\n8.38\n\n0.92\n\n3.20\n\n0.44\n\n3.21\n\n5.32\n\n1.97\n\n1.27\n\n0.45\n\n0.95\n\n2.41\n\n1.26\n\n     outstanding guarantees) \n\nMemo Items:  \n\nSalary + Pension + Interest \n\n12.53\n\n11.60\n\n11.16 \n\n10.85\n\n10.49\n\nOff-budget borrowings (Guarantees)  \n\n11.87\n\n15.21\n\n15.00 \n\n14.80\n\n14.59\n\nConsolidated Debt Stock with Guarantees  \n\n48.11\n\n52.57\n\n52.47 \n\n51.78\n\n50.77\n\nMonitored Fiscal Indicator CRD/RR \na CRD is equivalent to the sum of revenue deficit, interest on outstanding guarantees and the    \n\n.38 \n\n.50\n\n.30\n\n.40\n\n.26\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                 deficit of KSEB. \n            Source: Revised Medium Term Fiscal Framework, Kerala government. \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f80 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nINELIGIBLE ITEMS \n\n \n1. \nimported goods required during the Program. \n \n2. \n\nNo withdrawals will be made for the following: \n\nLoan proceeds will finance the foreign currency expenditures for the reasonable cost of \n\n(i) \n\nexpenditures for goods (included in the following Standard International Trading \nCommodity chapters or headings):  \n\nChapter \n\nHeading \n\n112 \n\n121 \n \n122 \n\n525 \n\n667 \n\n897 \n\n971 \n\n718 \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n897.3 \n \n\n718.7 \n\nDescription of Items \n \nAlcoholic beverages \n \nTobacco, unmanufactured;

The \nProgram  will  be  underpinned  by  a  performance  measurement  system  that  will  track  the \nperformance of key results areas of the Program in a meaningful and transparent manner. The \nperformance  indicators  will  comprise  input  and  output  and  process  indicators,  and  cover \nsubprograms 1 and 2. The starting point for tracking performance will be the items in the policy \nmatrix, which are also reflected in the program framework. However, as the Kerala government \ndevelops  its  capacity  to  monitor  performance,  the  system  will  be  enhanced  to  capture a wider \nrange  of  indicators,  including  outcome  indicators.  Measures  to  monitor  benefits  will  focus  on \nservice delivery improvements and access to information by the public, including monitoring by \nrepresentatives of civil-society organizations.  \n \n2. \nThe  aim  of  performance  measurement  is  to  improve  public  services,  reinforce \naccountability, and underpin effective working practices in the Kerala government and local self-\ngovernments  (LSGs).  A  performance  measurement  system  will  be  established  for  the  various \nprojects  in  the  Program  by  the  project  teams  in  consultation  with  relevant  stakeholders.  The \nKerala government will receive technical assistance from the Government of the Netherlands to \ndesign and implement such a performance monitoring system.  \n \n3. \nThe system will be designed for use in a variety of organizational settings, ranging from \nthe Secretariat to LSGs. However, the consistent reporting cycle and reporting format will allow \nfor  consolidation  and  comparison.  Performance  measures,  targets,  and  systems  will  be \ndesigned and implemented by line departments and LSGs. Project-based performance reports \nwill  be  submitted  via  the  MGP  secretary  to  the  MGP  steering  committee  for  approval.  Once \ncleared by the steering committee, they will be submitted to the MGP Cabinet subcommittee. All \nperformance reports will be published on the Kerala government web page. \n \n4. \nrequirements,  such  as \nsubcommittee, and departmental and LSG heads. \n \n5. \nThe  underlying  principles  that  the  Kerala  government  will  have  to  bear  in  mind  in \ndesigning  an  effective  performance  measurement  system  are  that  it  must  (i)  have  clarity  of \npurpose,  (ii)  focus  on  the  priority  areas  for  improvement,  (iii)  have  a  balanced  number  of \nmeasures,  (iv)  be  owned  by  the  staff  responsible  for  collecting  and  analyzing  the  data,  (v)  be \nscrutinized  at  a  number  of  levels  to  challenge  the  focus  and  to  ensure  the  robustness  of  the \ndata, (vi) have systems of performance evolve over time and adapt to changing circumstances. \nand (vii) have measures for regular monitoring and reviews.  \n \n6. \nThe performance measures will be purposeful, clearly defined, and easy to interpret. In \nchoosing  measures,  consideration  will  be  given  to  measures  of  economy,  efficiency, \neffectiveness,  quality,  and  value  for  money.  Targets  should  be  time  specific,  incorporate  an \nelement  of  comparison,  and  be  realistic.  These  considerations  are  often  summarized  as \n\"SMART\"\u2014specific,  measurable,  achievable,  relevant,  and  timed.  Central  direction  may  be \nvaluable  to  ensure  that  valid  comparisons  can  be  made,  but  local  discretion  should  also  be \nallowed to ensure that targets are set at a level appropriate to the organization.  \n \n\nThe  performance  measures  will  have  several  audiences,  each  with  their  own \nthe  general  public,  MGP  steering  committee,  MGP  Cabinet \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n83 \n\nTo  ensure  that  the  performance  system  is  implemented  in  a  phased  manner,  high-\n7. \npriority areas for change must be identified, and the policy matrix will provide some direction in \nthis  regard.  The  Kerala  government  will  need  to  consider  how  progress  monitoring  is  to  be \nlinked  to  decision  making  either  in  the  project  or  the  MGP  steering  committee  or  by  line \ndepartments and LSGs. Relevant targets are needed for those at the frontline, and focus should \nbe on areas where performance is important and need improvement. For example, establishing \na  performance  system  for  primary  health  care  centers,  linked  to  the  service  delivery \nimprovement  program,  social  audit,  asset  renewal,  and  the  Right  to  Information  Act  could  be \nuseful starting points, whereby the system starts with some basic indicators and progressively \nwidens in scope as the various policy measures and legislation are implemented.  \n \n\n \n\n\f84 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nRISK MITIGATION MEASURES \n\nProgram Purpose\u2014Risk-Mitigating Measures  \n\n \nA. \n \n\n1. \n\nSupport  to  Implementation  of  the  Modernizing
