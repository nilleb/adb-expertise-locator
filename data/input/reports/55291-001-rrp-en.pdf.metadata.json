THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed small \nexpenditure financing facility (SEFF) to Mongolia for the Project Readiness Enhancement Project \n(facility). \n \n2.   The facility will finance a series of small-scale activities to support the readiness and \nstrengthen the implementation of major infrastructure projects proposed to be financed by the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) in Mongolia. Each activity will be linked to ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy (CPS) for Mongolia, 2021\u20132024 and associated pipeline of ensuing projects.1 \nThe SEFF\u2019s priority sectors will include transport; water and other urban infrastructure and \nservices; agriculture, natural resources, and rural development; and energy. \n \n3.  The SEFF\u2019s primary objective is to develop quality infrastructure projects. The facility will \nfinance the (i) implementation readiness of linked ADB-financed projects; (ii) piloting of new \ntechnology, innovation, or improvement in design standards; and (iii) improvement of project \nefficiency and sustainability, including consideration of climate and disaster resilience in project \npreparation. The SEFF will allow ADB and the Government of Mongolia to greatly boost project \nimplementation by (i) supporting early design work and procurement actions to mitigate systemic \nproject start-up bottlenecks, (ii) strengthening the government\u2019s project implementation capacity, \nand (iii) completing and benchmarking infrastructure investments in conformance with up-to-date \ndesign and performance standards. \n \nII.  THE FACILITY \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n4.  Country portfolio overview. As Mongolia\u2019s lead development partner, ADB proactively \nimproves coordination with  government  agencies  and  development  partners  across  priority \nsectors. ADB's engagement in development planning and implementation is broad-based and \nsubstantial, the result of more than 30 years of in-country operations, including support for \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) response and recovery. As of 30 September 2021, the active \nportfolio included 68 loans and grants, funding 39 projects with a total value of $1.927 billion, and \n51 technical assistance projects with an aggregate net value of $42.8 million. A number of \nchallenges need to be resolved to ensure better project implementation and solid portfolio \ndelivery. The average start-up delay is more than 14 months across all projects, caused by (i) \nlack of detailed designs, (ii) insufficient use of recently approved advance procurement, (iii) \nconsistent delays in establishing project management units, and (iv) lack of continuity of project \nmanagement unit staff from design to implementation. The delays negatively impact project \nperformance. A unique challenge is the short construction season for civil works because of the \nextreme and long winter. Design and procurement readiness will help ensure better project \ndelivery. \n \n5.  Mongolia has sparser basic economic infrastructure than most countries.2 Continued \ngrowth without major investments in infrastructure is unrealistic, but funding challenges mean that \nthe investments must be highly efficient and that borders must be easy to cross, which would \n \n1  ADB. 2021. Country Partnership Strategy: Mongolia, 2021\u20132024\u2014Laying Resilient Foundations for Inclusive and \nSustainable Growth. Manila. \n2  Mongolia scores 130 of 160 on the World Bank\u2019s logistics performance index and scores low on other infrastructure \nindexes and benchmarks. \n \n ", " \n2\nmake cross-border infrastructure and connectivity more efficient. The government has prioritized \ninfrastructure development to catalyze COVID-19 recovery, attract foreign direct investment and \nprivate sector participation, and stimulate job creation, and has requested ADB to support several \nlarge infrastructure projects, greatly increasing the complexity and size of ADB\u2019s portfolio. The \nprojects include complex urban transport and traffic management in Ulaanbaatar, satellite-city \ndevelopment and associated rail and logistics support, export-oriented agriculture and livestock \ndevelopment, and road transport. Delivering a complex portfolio will require a high level of project \ndesign  readiness,  a  strong  focus  on  project  administration,  and  in-depth  support  to  the \ngovernment in managing procurement contracts and projects. \n \n6.  Strategic context. The CPS, 2017\u20132020 for Mongolia was the largest-ever partnership \nbetween ADB and Mongolia, resulting in commitments of $1.49 billion.3 Following parliamentary \nelections in June 2020, the new government unveiled an ambitious development program and \naction plan to close Mongolia\u2019s infrastructure gap and launch the country on a new development \ntrajectory.4 Basic infrastructure in Ulaanbaatar and other regions must be upgraded immediately \nto meet competitiveness and development goals. ADB is the country\u2019s largest development \npartner, and the government has requested ADB to lead in supporting the program.5 The SEFF \nwill  help  achieve  the  goals  of  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  by  (i)  strengthening  governance  and \ninstitutional capacity to reinforce service delivery and improve capacity and standards, and (ii) \npromoting innovative technology.6 The project is consistent with Mongolia\u2019s Vision\u20132050;7 the \nFive-Year National Development Plan for 2021\u20132025;8 and the Government Action Plan, 2020\u2013\n2024 (footnote 4); and is aligned with the current CPS (footnote 1). \n \nB.  Facility Description \n \n7.  Objective. Facility activities will improve the efficiency, sustainability, responsiveness, \nand readiness of ADB-financed projects. \n \n8.  Facility scope. The facility will finance a series of small-scale activities related to one or \nmore of the outputs (paras. 10\u201312).9 Each SEFF activity will be aligned with the CPS, with \ntransport, urban development, energy, and agriculture as priority sectors. The scope will include \ncomponents of climate change mitigation and adaptation. \n \n9.  The following will contribute to the achievement of the outputs and outcomes of the linked \nADB-financed projects. \n \n10.  Output 1: Project implementation readiness for ensuing projects improved. The \nfacility will support project preparation, design activities, and institutional strengthening for ADB-\nfinanced projects scheduled for approval from 2022 to 2024. This output will include Ulaanbaatar \ntraffic  management  and  other  transport  improvement  interventions,  energy,  export-oriented \n \n3  ADB. 2017.

Output 2: New technology, innovation, or improvement in design standards pilot-\ntested.  The  facility  will  support  pilot-testing  of  advanced  technologies  and  management \napproaches to reduce life-cycle costs, improve service efficiency and quality, and minimize \nnegative environmental and social impacts. Developing smart traffic management in Ulaanbaatar \nis an example of using new technology and management approaches. \n \n12.  Output 3: Project efficiency and sustainability enhanced. The facility will improve \nproject efficiency and sustainability, including capacity building and implementation support for \nnew  projects,  institutional  efficiency,  governance  improvements,  preparation  of  safeguard \ndocuments,  financial  and  economic  analysis  for  ensuing  projects,  and  operation  and \nmaintenance. The institutional arrangements for the proposed mass transit system in Ulaanbaatar \nis the first activity planned under output 3. \n \n13.  Facility-financed activities are listed in the indicative activities (footnote 9). \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n14.  Proposed facility and ADB value addition. The SEFF presents a unique opportunity for \nADB to strengthen project preparation and implementation, allowing Mongolia to deliver the \npriorities of Vision\u20132050 (footnote 7). The government agreed to borrow for project design costs \nfor the first time, highlighting its commitment to strengthen project administration. The government \nintends to improve project design readiness to avoid start-up delays, which affect contract awards \nand disbursement ratios, possibly cause cost overruns, and hold up delivery of project benefits. \nThe SEFF will allow ADB and the government to expedite project implementation by (i) supporting \nearly design work and advance procurement to lessen project start-up bottlenecks; (ii) strengthen \nthe  government\u2019s  project  implementation  capacity;  (iii)  introduce  innovative  solutions,  new \ntechnologies,  standards,  and  management  approaches;  and  (iv)  complete  infrastructure \ninvestments in conformance with up-to-date performance standards. The SEFF will help improve \ngovernance by building institutions, sustaining operation and maintenance, and pilot-testing new \ntechnologies. \n \nD.  Scope of First Activity \n \n15.  The first activity under the facility, estimated to cost $7 million, will help improve traffic \nmanagement and mass transit in Ulaanbaatar. This will include (i) conducting detailed design of \nthe selected mass rapid transit system, including road corridor improvement based on the \ncompleted feasibility studies under ADB-funded projects;10 (ii) preparing safeguard compliance \ndocuments; (iii) undertaking procurement actions for ensuing project as detailed in the AAM;11 (iv) \npilot-testing of the smart traffic management system; (v) strengthening road safety measures for \n \n10 Municipality of Ulaanbaatar. 2011.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  The executing agency for the facility will be the Ministry of Finance (MOF). MOF and ADB \nwill agree on all facility-financed activities, considering (i) consistency with CPS strategic priorities \nand facility outputs, (ii) exclusion of activities classified as category A or B for environment and \nsocial safeguards in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), and (iii) a maximum \nactivity cost not exceeding $7,000,000. \n \n22.  The implementing agency for the first activity under the facility will be the Municipality of \nUlaanbaatar,  which  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall  coordination,  implementation,  and \nmanagement of the first activity. \n \n23.  During  activity  preparation,  ADB  will  extensively  consult  representatives  of  the \ngovernment  ministries;  provincial  and  district  departments;  civil  society  organizations;  and \ndevelopment partners (Japan International Cooperation Agency, the World Bank, and bilateral \ndonors). \n \n24.  Implementation arrangements of the facility, including specific arrangements for the first \nactivity under the facility, are summarized in Table 3, and described in detail in the activity \nadministration manual (AAM).13 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nSEFF availability period  December 2021\u2013December 2026 \nEstimated completion date  October 2026 \nExpected first activity closing  July 2024 \ndate \nManagement \n(i)  Executing agency for  Ministry of Finance \nSEFF \n(ii)  Implementing agencies  First activity: Municipality of Ulaanbaatar \nfor SEFF activities \n(iii) Implementation unit for  To be determined for each activity.

Each SEFF activity will generally have its own \nactivity administration manual and procurement plan. \nConsulting services  The first activity will engage one consulting firm for 272 person-months \n($4.50 million) through  quality- and cost-based selection, and  three \nindividual consultants for about 80 person-months ($0.30 million) through \nindividual consultant selection. Each SEFF activity will generally have its \nown activity administration manual and procurement plan. \nDisbursement  Disbursement of each subloan proceeds for the activity subloans will \nfollow ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from \ntime to time) and detailed arrangements agreed between the government \nand ADB.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, SEFF = small expenditure financing facility. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n25.  Economic and financial analysis will be carried out, as appropriate, for each facility-\nfinanced activity to confirm that the ADB-financed project supported by the activity will remain \nviable. The first activity under the facility will help improve traffic management and mass transit in \nUlaanbaatar and provide economic benefits through reduced travel time and vehicle operating \ncosts savings. The first activity includes a full economic and financial analysis. Economic and \nfinancial due diligence will be conducted for all facility-financed activities. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n26.  Financial  management  and  procurement  risk  assessments  for  the  executing  and \nimplementing  agencies  of  the  first  activity  find  low  pre-mitigation  financial  risks  and  low \nprocurement management risks. The justifications for the low-risk ratings are the following: (i) the \nexecuting agency has experience in implementing ADB-financed projects; (ii) the executing and \nimplementing agencies will provide financial guidance and support to the project implementation \nunit; and (iii) ADB, through the project team, will support procurement and consultant recruitment. \nStrategic procurement planning was undertaken for the first activity and will be similarly prepared \nfor subsequent activities. \n \n27.  For subsequent activities, financial management and procurement risk assessments will \nbe undertaken for the implementing agencies. \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MOF. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the AAM (footnote 13). \n \nC.  Poverty, Social, and Gender  \n \n29.  The national poverty rate increased in recent years, from a historical low of 21.6% in 2014 \nto 28.4% in 2018, while the urban poverty rate in 2018 was 27.2% (up by 8.4 percentage points \nsince 2014) and the rural poverty rate 30.8% (up by 4.4). Poverty rates are high in the eastern \n \n ", "7 \n(37.4% in 2018) and western region (31.8% in 2018). In Ulaanbaatar, the poverty rate increased \nrapidly by 9.5 percentage points from 2014 to 25.9% in 2018. The project beneficiaries of the first \nactivity include communities, enterprises, and tourists in Ulaanbaatar. The ensuing project will \nbenefit communities, with efficient public transport saving them considerable time and money. \nThe activity will collect detailed socioeconomic data on beneficiaries, including their priorities and \nneeds during project preparation. \n \n30.  Gender. The facility will include women in related decision-making process and ensure \nthat they participate in and benefit from the project activities. The project will include proactive \ngender measures to ensure that women are equally represented in consultation processes and \ntraining programs and have equal access to economic opportunities. The project will identify \nmeasures to strengthen opportunities for women while promoting gender equality, including \nthrough preparation of the gender action plan, with detailed actions and targets. The first activity, \nin Ulaanbaatar, will benefit the poorest and women, who travel primarily on foot or use informal \npublic transport, mainly large and medium-sized buses and the popular pickups, which together \nserve about 70% of total transport demand but represent only 43% of total traffic. A well-designed \nand accessible public transport system would, therefore, substantially benefit the urban poor and \nwomen. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n31.  All  activities  under  the  facility  will  include  activity-specific  safeguard  review  and \ncategorization. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the safeguard \ncategories of the first activity are indicated in paras. 32\u201334.14 The facility will not finance any \nactivity classified as category A or B for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous \npeoples. \n \n32.  Environment (category C). The first activity is categorized as C for environment. The \nactivities will mostly engage consulting services. Small civil works are envisaged, related to \ninstalling  office  equipment  and  renovating  government-owned  facilities.  No  adverse \nenvironmental impacts are identified or expected. The project will not support any activities listed \nin ADB\u2019s Prohibited Investment Activities List. If a larger-scale civil work is identified during \nimplementation of the first activity, recategorization and due diligence will be conducted. \n \n33.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The resettlement category for the first activity is \nC as no land acquisition or involuntary resettlement is envisaged. Under the first activity, small \nworks in Ulaanbaatar are related to installing office equipment and renovating government-owned \nfacilities. The SEFF will not finance any activity classified as category A or B for involuntary \nresettlement. \n \n34.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The first activity will not impact communities that may \nbe  defined  as  indigenous  peoples  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The \nindigenous peoples\u2019 classification is category C. \n \nE.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n35.  All activities under the facility will include an activity-specific assessment of risks and \nassociated mitigation measures. Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in \n \n14  ADB.
