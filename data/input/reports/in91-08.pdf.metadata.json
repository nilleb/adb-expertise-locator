Project Description as Stated in the Report and Recommendation of the President (RRP) \n  \n a. Rationale and Expected Impacts: \n \nAs stated in the RRP, \u201cIndonesia is in the grip of an unprecedented financial, economic, and social crisis that \ncalls  for  radical  and  decisive  reforms  to  restore  domestic  and  international  investor  confidence.  Bank \nassistance during 1999 will be guided by the short-term interim strategy formulated in response to the crisis. \nThis strategy stresses assisting the Government in implementing major economic policy and institutional \nreforms, and mitigating the social distress spawned by the crisis. Bank support of the Government\u2019s initiative \nfor structural reforms in the power sector is considered essential given the urgent need for reforms to \novercome the inefficiencies resulting from overregulation and inappropriate financial policies whose adverse \nimpact on the sector was less apparent during periods of high and sustained growth. Without the reforms \nenvisaged under the Power Sector Restructuring Program (PSRP), the electricity supply industry which is \nreeling under the impact of the crisis, cannot survive. Ensuring a stable supply of electricity is essential for the \ncountry\u2019s economic recovery. The Program provides a sound basis for the Government to carry out reform \nand restructuring of the power sector. \n \n b. Objectives or Expected Outcomes: \n  \nIn the RRP and the PCR only one objective is stated for the TA loan: \u201c\u2026to strengthen the capacity of the \nGovernment and the national power company, Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) to facilitate establishment of \na competitive electricity market.\u201d However, there were more objectives and outputs for the TA loan. The \nobjective  of  the  Power  Sector  Restructuring  Program  (PSRP)  was  \u201d\u2026the  actual  establishment  of  a \n ", "2   \ncompetitive market for electricity in Java-Bali.\u201d This objective of the PSRP was an expected outcome of the \nTA loan. From the RRP, a total of nine1 expected outcomes of the TA loan were identified in this validation: \n(i)  establishment of a competitive electricity market in Java and Bali (which includes the capacity \nof the Government and its auxiliaries to operate and maintain the competitive electricity \nmarket);  \n(ii)  lower tariffs in real terms; \n(iii)  improvement in the economic growth, from efficiency gains in the power sector; \n(iv)  stakeholder acceptance of electricity tariff increases; \n(v)  improvement in poverty reduction resulting from the economic growth and lower tariffs; \n(vi)  small consumer awareness and gain in bargaining power; \n(vii)  development of appropriate instruments to finance poor electricity consumers; \n(viii)  achievement of practical and effective methods of energy conservation to help mitigate the \neffects of tariff increases; and  \n(ix)  institutional development.  \n \nNote: As stated above, the PCR defined only one specific objective or outcome. The other outcomes \nidentified above are mentioned at different places in the report but are not identified collectively as outcomes. \n \nThe RRP defined eight components, identified as parts in the TA loan:  \n \nPart A. developing a competitive electricity market\u2014market rules, \nPart B. developing a competitive electricity market\u2014financial settlement,  \nPart C. developing a competitive electricity market\u2014software specifications,  \nPart D. developing computer software for operation of a competitive bulk electricity market,  \nPart E. providing support for the development of power sector regulatory capabilities,  \nPart F. providing support for the power sector restructuring secretariat,  \nPart G. assisting in building acceptance of electricity tariff increases, and \nPart H. strengthening consumer participation in a competitive electricity market. \n \nThe project design established each of the components as a separate consulting services contract. \nDuring the course of the Project, Parts D and F were cancelled, as discussed in para. 3b. \n \n c. Outputs: \n \nOutputs in the RRP and PCR were considered to be identical to the above components. However, in this \nvalidation a number of the components are considered to provide more than one output. These outputs are \ndefined in Appendix 1, showing 24 distinct outputs within the six components (i.e., excluding Parts D and F). \n \n \n3. Evaluation of Design and Implementation (evaluator assessment of actual versus envisioned) \n \n a.  Relevance of design and formulation \n \nAs reported in the PCR, the concept for the design of the PSRP was outlined in the Government\u2019s Power \nSector Restructuring Policy in August 1998. The policy aimed to restore financial viability to PLN, establish \ncompetition in the Java and Bali power sector, and increase the benefits of private sector participation. The \npolicy was formulated after a series of consultations with key stakeholders in the electricity sector. The \nimplementation plan for the restructuring was also discussed in a workshop held in December 1998, attended \nby representatives of consumer groups, independent power producers, industry, and multilateral and bilateral \naid agencies. Therefore the policy was well vetted by the stakeholders. The design and implementation \nstrategy of the PSRP and related TA loan were consistent with this policy objective. They were also \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s 1995 energy policy and its operational strategy to deal with situations arising out of the \n                                                 \n1 In order to understand the impacts arising from the annulment of the new Electricity Law, re paragraph 3.a, it was \nnecessary to identify the detailed outcomes here in paragraph 2.b, and the detailed outputs in paragraph 2.d. ", "  3\nfinancial crisis. Thus the design of the TA loan was relevant at the start of the Project. \n \nThe design of the PSRP and the TA loan was prepared with the view that a draft electricity law being \nconsidered by parliament at the start of the Project would be ratified. The PSRP and TA loan started in March \n1999. The new Electricity Law was to establish a competitive electricity market and an independent regulatory \nboard, and was enacted on 4 September 2002. However, on 15 December 2004, the Constitutional Court \nstated that the new Electricity Law contained provisions that contradicted the 1945 Constitution. The court \ntherefore ruled to annul the new Law and to put the old Law No.15/1985 back in place. It is noted that the \nannulment took place almost 4 years after the Project start date, when the work on the TA loan had just been \ncompleted and work on the PSRP was well advanced. The provisions that violated the constitution related to \nthe establishment of a competitive market and the unbundling of the PLN. These were key elements of the \nPSRP policy framework and therefore prevented the PSRP from meeting its objective and negated much of \nthe work performed under the TA loan.  \n \nSince the annulment was so devastating, a question arises with respect to the relevance of the design and \nformulation of the PSRP and the TA loan. With respect to the TA loan there are four issues; the first two \narising from the PCR.  \n \nThe PCR concludes that, \u201cOverall, the TA loan was relevant to the country\u2019s overall development needs at the \ntime of appraisal. As the new Electricity Law was annulled, however, the TA\u2019s design and formulation had lost \nits relevance by the time of its completion.\u201d The position of this validation is that the TA loan lost a great deal \nof its effectiveness and relevance\u2014but not all. The fundamental goal of the PSRP and the TA loan was not a \ncompetitive electricity market but increased economic development and poverty reduction. A number of the \noutputs of the consultants\u2019 contracts for the TA loan that were directed toward capacity building and poverty \nreduction  were  achieved.  These  outcomes  were  small  achievements  compared  to  the  main  expected \noutcome (a competitive electricity market), but were relevant at appraisal and are today.  \n \nBecause of delays in implementation of the PSRP and the subsequent need to delay the TA tasks, as \ndescribed in para. 3c, the PCR, in para. 21, states that, \u201c...the TA Loan would have been better designed if it \nhad been processed after an electricity law had been approved and had been directed to providing support for \nimplementing  such  electricity  law  after  its  enactment.\u201d  This  validation  is  of  the  view,  considering  the \ncomplexity of the components and the urgent need for implementation (the original schedule was 36 months \nto complete all eight components), that there was not much flexibility in the schedule. Therefore, although in \nhindsight the scheduling of tasks may have been improved it was formulated satisfactorily. This view is \nsupported by the satisfactory completion of the consultants\u2019 contracts.  \n \nThe other design and formulation issues are as follows. \n \nThe devastating impact caused by the annulment of the new Electricity Law begs the question: were the risks \nappropriately considered and addressed in the design of the TA loan? There was certainly knowledge and \nconcern in ADB at the time of appraisal regarding the risks with respect to the performance of the Borrower.2 \nHowever,  the  annulment  of  the  new  Electricity  Law  by  the  Constitutional  Court  in  December  2004  is \nconsidered by this validation to have been a force majeure that it was impossible for the designers of the \nPSRP and TA loan to have foreseen as a specific risk. It was also an issue beyond the control of the \nGovernment and all other parties associated with the design of the TA loan. It was noted that in Part E of the \nconsultants\u2019 terms of reference that legal assistance was apparently provided in drafting operating licenses \nand developing procedural regulations to ensure compliance with Indonesian law. Thus not only the designers \nof the PSRP and TA loan, but also the legal consultants, the executing agency (EA) and parliament failed to \nrecognize the risk of constitutional conflict. Thus the action of annulment of the new Electricity Law does not \nindicate lack of diligence in the consideration of risk in formulating the TA loan.  \n \nApart from the actual design of the TA loan, there is a question regarding the basis of design. The PCR and \nthe RRP do not report on the basis of the design of the TA loan. The TA loan was designed for capacity \nbuilding for restructuring of the power sector. Logically a capacity building project should be designed on the \n                                                                                                                                                             \n2 Re the Record of Discussions at Board Meeting of 23 March1999.  \n ", "4   \nbasis of the needs of the target organization(s), which in turn should be based on some prior study, preferably \nan organizational study, including staffing needs versus existing staff capabilities. Major infrastructure projects \nare generally preceded by and based on feasibility studies. Although there probably was a sound basis for the \ndesign of the TA loan, the information was not available in ADB files. Thus this validation does not know \ndefinitively how relevant the design of the TA loan is with respect to the needs of the Government and its \nauxiliaries. There is, however, some assurance of relevance since the PSRP and the TA loan were well \nvetted by many stakeholders. The issue in this paragraph is not the relevance of the design but the absence \nof a report on the basis of the design of the TA loan in the RRP and PCR to substantiate its relevance.  \n \nAs indicated above, the PCR rated the TA loan as having lost its relevance. In consideration of the above \npoints and particularly the capacity building achievements and social development outputs, this validation \nrates the design and formulation, overall, as \u201cpartly relevant\u201d. \n \nb. Components (or Key Conditions in the case of Program Loans): Outputs and costs by component \nas envisioned during appraisal as compared with actual costs and achievement of outputs; reasons \nfor any deviation: \n \nThe TA loan defined eight components as outlined in paragraph 2d above. The components are repeated in \nthe following table, with actual costs at completion shown in comparison with appraisal estimates. \n \nThe actual cost of the project, $7.815 million, was markedly less than $20 million envisaged at appraisal. The \nmajor cost reductions were due to the cancellation of parts D and F of the TA loan. Parts D and F aside, the \nproject costs for the remaining six components of the loan were all close to budget with the total cost being \nunder budget, as shown on the bottom line of the following table. In January 2002, at the request of the \nborrower, a major change in the TA loan was approved, which was to delete parts D and F from the scope of \nwork. \n \nPart D was cancelled, because of delays in the schedule, as discussed in paragraph 3c. With the delay in the \nschedule, Part D for computer software development was not needed until 2006, which would require the TA \nloan to remain active for this one task, an additional 4 years beyond the original closing date. ADB considered \nit more appropriate to refinance Part D under a later loan (which it did under a loan to the Republic of \nIndonesia for the Power Transmission Improvement Sector Project.).  \n \nPart F was cancelled because the same or similar tasks were being performed under a capacity building \nproject funded by the United States Agency for International Development. Although not specifically reported \non in the PCR, it appears that the work under this task was being carried out satisfactorily.  \n \nThis validation considers that deleting these components and cancelling the corresponding parts of the TA \nloan was good project management in adapting to changing conditions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  5\nCOMPARISON OF PROJECT COST AT APPRAISAL AND COMPLETION \n \n($000) \nItem  Appraisal Estimate  Actual \nA.

Project Cost, Disbursements, Borrower Contribution, and Conformance to Schedule (as relevant to \nproject performance): \n \n Project Cost, Disbursements relevant to Project Performance \n \nAs reported above, the cost of the project was markedly less than envisaged at appraisal, mainly due to the \ncancellation of Parts D and F. The other six tasks collectively were completed under budget and with \nsatisfactory performance. During the course of the Project the project tasks and disbursements had to be \nrescheduled because of delays in the PSRP activities, extending the duration of loan effectiveness from the \noriginal 42 months to 69 months, as shown in the table below. The disbursement schedule had to be revised \non four occasions. However, because there were 6 components with 6 different consulting contracts, the \ncontracts and disbursements were able to be staggered to better meet the prevailing conditions. The delays \ndid not affect the quality of the TA outputs--although the outputs were not effective or only partly effective \nbecause of the eventual cancellation of the new Electricity Law.

The Government provided \nsupport in kind, including office accommodation, local transportation and counterpart staff, estimated in the \nRRP at $683,000 for the six parts of the TA loan that were implemented. The actual cost of the Government \ncontribution was not reported but the support was considered by the ADB to be appropriate.  \n \nConformance to Schedule (as relevant to project performance) \nInitially, the TA loan was to be implemented within a period of 36 months, starting April 1999. However, the \nimplementation of the PSRP and the TA were delayed because of changes in PLN restructuring, extension of \ntime to carry out the acceptance of regulatory and institutional changes, adjusting tariffs; and, particularly, a \nbacklog in parliament that slowed deliberation of the new Electricity Law. Nevertheless, the TA work was not \nderailed and consulting contracts were completed satisfactorily and within budget.

Implementation Arrangements, Conditions and Covenants, and related Technical Assistance:  \n  \nImplementation Arrangements \nThe Executing Agency for the PSRP and the TA loan was the Ministry of Finance, and the focal point for \npolicy reforms was the Director General for Electricity and Energy Utilization (DGEEU). An electricity sector \nrestructuring team within DGEEU was responsible for the administration of the PSRP and the TA loan. The \nteam was also in charge of preparing the new Electricity Law and developing the blueprint for implementation. \nReports were periodically submitted to ADB by DGEEU. Six consulting firms were engaged to implement the \nTA  loan.  Recruitment  of  the  consultants  was  through  competition  among  short-listed  qualified  firms in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  \n \nADB closely monitored the implementation of the PSRP and the TA loan through an inception mission and \nfive review missions fielded during the course of the loan, 1999\u20132004. \n \nDelays  in  the  schedule  and  annulment  of  the  new  Electricity  Law  were  not  a  consequence  of  the \nimplementation arrangements. Therefore the implementation arrangements are rated \u201csatisfactory\u201d. \nConditions and Covenants \nConditions and covenants of the TA loan addressed the due diligence, efficiency and sound practices of the \ntechnical assistance provided under the loan. According to the project performance reports, throughout the \nperiod of the Project, the performance of the Borrower on conditions and covenants was \u201csatisfactory\u201d.  \n \nIt is noted that the completion report to be provided by the Borrower, in accordance with the covenant in the \nTA Loan Agreement, Section 4.07.c, was not available in ADB files and probably was not submitted by the \nBorrower. Apart from being noncompliant, if it was not submitted, the completion report of the Borrower with \nthe Borrower\u2019s viewpoints on the delays, annulment of the new Electricity Law and Project achievements \nshould be valuable with regard to lessons to be learned. Overall, this validation rates the performance of the \nBorrower on Conditions and Covenants as \u201csatisfactory\u201d. \n  \ne. Performance of the Borrower and Executing Agency: \n \nThe PCR did not report comprehensively on the performance of the Borrower and Executing Agency with \nrespect to the management of the TA loan. However, it did report that the Borrower met the conditions and \ncovenants, as indicated in paragraph 3d above. ADB review missions all reported the overall performance of \nthe Project to be \u201csatisfactory\u201d or \u201cpartly satisfactory\u201d. There were issues of concern with respect to annulment \nof the new Electricity Law and delays but these were not as a result of the performance of the Borrower or the \nExecuting Agency. \n \nUnder the management of the Executing Agency, the outputs by the consultants were completed satisfactorily \nand within the overall budget. As with the Borrower and Executing Agency, delays in the project schedule and \nannulment of the new Electricity Law were not attributable to the consultants. There is one issue outstanding:  \nsubmission of the completion report by the Borrower. Overall this validation rates the performance of the \nBorrower, the Executing Agency, and the consultants as \u201csatisfactory\u201d, in agreement with the PCR. \n \n  f.  Performance of the Asian Development Bank: \n \nThe project appraisal, design and initiation of the TA loan proceeded appropriately. The ADB review missions \nfielded during the course of the Project closely monitored the implementation of the power sector restructuring \nand associated activities under the TA loan. As indicated above, there were issues of concern with respect to \ndelays in the Project schedule, and annulment of the new Electricity Law but these were not as a result of \nADB performance.  \n \nThe PCR and RRP did not specifically identify the pertinent outcomes and outputs of the TA loan. Only one \nobjective was identified in both reports and when this objective was not clearly met, the PCR rated the TA \nloan as \u201cirrelevant\u201d and \u201cunsuccessful\u201d. However, this validation considers that there were nine pertinent \nexpected outcomes and 24 outputs, with some achievements and expected positive impacts. These were not \n ", "8   \nvery significant impacts but they should have been acknowledged. Had the PCR identified the outcomes and \noutputs in more detail, he Project may have been given a higher level of assessment for capacity building and \npotential socioeconomic impacts.  \n \nThe basis of design of the TA loan was not provided in the PCR or the RRP, which should be standard \npractice in capacity building projects.  \n \nThe PCR rated the ADB performance in program design and implementation \u201cpartly satisfactory\u201d. Overall this \nvalidation rates the ADB performance as \u201csatisfactory\u201d, mainly because of its satisfactory management of a \ncomplex contract. The above critical comments are on individual issues. \n \n4. Evaluation of Performance (Evaluator assessment): \n \na.  Relevance \n \nAt the time of appraisal, the design of the PSRP and the TA loan were consistent with the Government\u2019s \npower  sector  restructuring  policy  and  ADB\u2019s  energy  policy.  The  PSRP  and  TA  loan  proceeded  with \nimplementation in accordance with that design fully expecting the ratification of the new Electricity Law. The \nperformance of the Borrower, Executing Agency and consultants for the TA was evaluated as \u201csatisfactory\u201d by \nADB and therefore \u201crelevant\u201d. All outputs of the TA loan were achieved. No changes in the design were \nrequired and the design remained relevant throughout the course of the Project. However, a number of the \nsignificant outputs became ineffective and irrelevant as a result of the annulment of the new Electricity Law. It \nis noted that the Project was completed before annulment of the New Electricity Law and thus it was too late \nto make any changes in the design of the Project to improve on its effectiveness and relevance.  \n \nThe PCR did not identify pertinent outcomes and outputs and did not report on the basis of the design. \nHowever, although the PCR did not explain the basis of design, because the design was well vetted by \nstakeholders, it was relevant. This view is supported because the terms of reference for the consultants\u2019 \ncontracts were comprehensive and of a high standard.  \n \nOverall this validation rates the performance of the TA loan as \u201crelevant\u201d at the time of appraisal and \u201cpartly \nrelevant\u201d at the time of completion of the Project. \n \n \nb.  Effectiveness in Achieving Outcome \n \nThe PCR reported that, \u201c\u2026some actions of the PSRP, relating to tariff adjustments and financial restructuring \nof PLN were initiated\u2026\u201d The PCR also stated that, \u201c\u2026as a consequence of the new Electricity Law being \nannulled no progress in the PSRP has been made in PLN\u2019s unbundling, introduction of competitive markets, \nand  establishment  of  an  independent  electricity  regulator\u201d.  Therefore,  the  TA  loan  was  considered \n\u201cineffective\u201d in achieving the TA loan\u2019s anticipated outcome.\u201d This validation agrees with the PCR statement \non the facts but does not consider that the TA loan was totally ineffective. It is noted that there is mostly \nagreement between the PCR and this validation\u2014so that the differences are in assessment of the level of \neffectiveness and not with respect to the outcomes. For this validation, the main considerations for the \nassessment of outcomes are that the TA loan was a capacity building project and that capacity building has \nbeen performed satisfactorily. The capacity building and training provided through the TA loan should remain \nwith the Government and its auxiliaries in the pursuit of a more effective power sector. There are also a \nnumber of potential effective socioeconomic outcomes resulting from outputs achieved by the TA consultants. \nAn assessment of the outcomes, as defined in paragraph 2b, supporting the overall rating of the TA loan as \n\u201cless effective\u201d (using the terminology of Project Performance Evaluation Report Guidelines). \n \nIt should be noted that the expected outcomes of the PSPR were very ambitious\u2014to achieve unbundling of \nPLN and establish a competitive electricity market. If these outcomes had been achieved, the rating would \nhave been \u201chighly effective\u201d. Since some of the outcomes were achieved, the Project has to have a rating \nhigher than \u201cineffective\u201d. \n ", "  9\nStatus and Assessment of Expected Outcomes \nExpected Outcomes  Status  Effectiveness \nand \nSustainability \nActual establishment of a  Although the capacity of the Government and PLN  Ineffective \ncompetitive market for  have been strengthened, resulting from the training \nelectricity in Java-Bali.   and association with the consultants, the establishment \nof a competitive electricity market was not achieved. \nLower tariffs in real terms.

Efficiency in Achieving Outcome and Outputs \n \nThe PCR claims the outputs became irrelevant because of the annulment of the new Electricity Law and \ntherefore it considered the TA loan \u201cinefficient\u201d. However, this validation has pointed out that the TA loan was \npartly effective. As for its efficiency, if the outcome is low (\u201cless effective\u201d) compared to the input then the \nefficiency is low (or \u201cinefficient\u201d). Thus this validation agrees with the PCR and rates the outcome of the TA as \n\u201cinefficient\u201d. \n \nd. Preliminary Assessment of Sustainability \n \nThe PCR states that, \u201cAs the Electricity Law was annulled the Project\u2019s sustainability is \u201cless likely\u201d unless \nfurther reforms are undertaken.\u201d Because of the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision with respect to unbundling of \nPLN and the competitive electricity market, further major reforms are expected to be slow in coming. Some \nexpected  outcomes  have  been  achieved  and  are  expected  to  be  sustainable.  However,  the  expected \noutcomes that have not been achieved (unbundling of PLN, establishment of a competitive electricity market) \nare those that would have had the most impact. Therefore the sustainability of the TA outcomes is mixed and, \noverall, this validation rates the sustainability as \u201cless likely\u201d in agreement with the PCR. \n \ne. Impact (both intended and unintended) \n \nThe PCR states that, \u201cthe TA Loan did not achieve its purpose, there are no impacts identified in terms of \npoverty reduction, the environment, and social protection.\u201d This validation has a somewhat different view. \nCertainly  with  the  competitive  electricity  market  not  being  achieved,  the  intended  impacts--expected \nImprovement in the economic growth from efficiency gains in the power sector, improvement in poverty \nreduction resulting from the economic growth and lower tariffs in real terms--have been lost. On the negative \nside, there has probably been an unintended and demoralizing impact on the staff who supported and worked \ndiligently towards the PSRP and TA loan objectives. However, without diminishing those losses, following \nfrom its assessment of relevance and effectiveness above, this validation notes that the TA loan did achieve \nall of its outputs and a number of expected outcomes in whole or in part. A significant positive impact is that, \nfollowing the satisfactory completion of the consulting contracts, the Government and its auxiliaries have \nacquired some capability with respect to establishment and operation of a competitive electricity market, \nwhich is still the ultimate objective of the Government for the power sector. Similarly the effective and partly \neffective social outcomes identified in the Status and Assessment of Expected Outcomes,--small gains in \nconsumer awareness and in bargaining power, development of appropriate instruments to finance poor \nelectricity consumers, achievement of practical and effective methods of energy conservation to help mitigate \nthe  effects  of  tariff  increases--should  have  positive  impacts  on  the  social  well  being  of  the  electricity \nconsumers. Project impacts have yet to fully appear\u2014and no monitoring and evaluation of project outcomes \nhas been reported. Therefore the impacts, although expected, are still to be substantiated. This validation \nthus rates the impacts as \u201cmoderate\u201d.  \n \n \n5. Overall Assessment, Lessons, and Recommendations (Evaluator assessment): \n \na.  Overall Assessment \n \nThe quality of the outputs was \u201csatisfactory\u201d. The delays in implementation, although significant, were \nmanageable and the Project was completed under budget. Two of the eight components were cancelled in \nthe TA loan, but were accomplished through other contracts. Annulment of the new Electricity Law and \nsubsequent failure to achieve a competitive electricity market was devastating for the PSRP and the TA loan \nmain objectives but this was beyond the control of Government and ADB. Issues that were questioned: the \nabsence of an identification of pertinent outcomes and outputs and of a report on the basis of design of the \nTA loan were individual issues that did not detract from the value of the Project. Much was accomplished in \ncapacity building and some of the expected outcomes for socio-economic development can be pursued \nfollowing completion of the Project. Overall the TA loan was \u201cpartly successful.\u201d  ", "  11\n \n \nb.  Lessons \n \nTwo lessons were identified in the PCR. This validation agrees with the one lesson, which is:  \n(i)  In implementing a program of power sector reforms, thorough policy research and design, \nalong with adequate assessment of the constitutional and legal constraints, should be ensured \nat the time of program formulation.  \n \nThe second lesson from the PCR is stated as: \n(ii)  As the TA loan was formulated prior to adoption of the New Electricity Law, some of its \ncomponents had to be adjusted, delayed, or even cancelled. With hindsight, the TA loan \nshould have been provided after enactment of the new Electricity Law so as to provide targeted \nsupport  to  implementation  of  the  law.    In  this  validation,  the  problem  vis-\u00e0-vis  the  new \nElectricity Law was not to provide targeted support but rather to address risks carefully. And \nthe designers did consider the risks carefully but this particular risk of annulment was not \nidentified. In project scheduling one cannot always wait until all risks are identified before \nproceeding with implementation. Therefore the lesson that the designers did address but to be \nreinforced is to address risks carefully in Project design. \n \nThis validation would add two further lessons.  \n(iii)  The basis of the design of capacity building projects should be included in the appraisal for \ncapacity building projects and reported in RRPs and PCRs, particularly to show relevance. \n \n(iv)  All of the outcomes and outputs should be identified in the RRP, in the design and in the PCR, \nto keep the Project focused and to monitor and evaluate achievements. \n \nc.  Recommendations \n \nThis validation agrees with the five recommendations identified in the PCR, which are paraphrased below.  \n \n1.  Project Related \n \n(i)  Future Monitoring. For the Indonesian power sector, ADB should monitor the preparation of a \nnew  electricity  law  and  engage  the  Government  in  high-level  policy  dialogue.  It  is \nrecommended that a new electricity law, while respecting the Constitution, should retain the \nspirit of the annulled law and be quickly followed by implementing regulations.  \n(ii)  Further Action or Follow-Up. As PLN will continue to dominate the sector in the foreseeable \nfuture, its institutional capacity should be strengthened in such areas as project planning and \nimplementation, financial management, and corporate governance. \n(iii)  Additional Assistance. As planned new generation projects will not be available until 2010, \nthe Government has identified energy efficiency as a tool for reducing the demand and \ndistribution losses. ADB may consider providing assistance to support energy efficiency and \ncost-reduction efforts in order to improve PLN\u2019s overall efficiency and to reduce subsidies. \n(iv)  Timing of the Project Performance Evaluation Report. Since this TA loan was processed \nand  implemented  along  with  PSRP,  it  is  recommended  that  the  Project  Performance \nEvaluation Report of the TA loan be conducted together with that of PSRP.3 \n \n2. General \n(i)  When designing a complex sector reform program in ADB\u2019s member countries, ADB should \nengage the services of a qualified domestic legal expert to ensure the legality of the reform \npackage. \n \n \n                                                 \n3  Without expressing an opinion, it is noted that this recommendation was not adopted for this Project. \n ", "12  \n2.  Recommendations Supplementary to the PCR \n \n(i)  In appraising capacity building projects (or projects with capacity building components) the \nbasis  of  the  design  should  be  appraised.  The  needs  versus  the  capacity  of  the  target \norganization(s) should be assessed and reported in the RRPs, particularly to show relevance. \n \n(ii)  ADB should obtain a copy of the Borrower\u2019s completion report, in accordance with Article 4.07 \n(c) of the TA Loan Agreement.  The Borrower should be requested to address in detail the \nreasons why the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision came as a surprise. \n \n \n 6. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization (Evaluator assessment): \n \nThere is no M&E design referred to in the RRP or the PCR. In the RRP:  \n \nitem 21 states, \u201c\u2026 the proposed working group on participation and Government regulators\u2026 will closely \nmonitor  and  assess  the  impact  of  tariff  changes  during  the  program  period\u201d.  However  this  activity  is \napparently designed to obtain acceptance of proposed rate changes rather than any social pursuits.  \n \nIn the terms of reference for the consulting services contract Part G, item 4, Support for Poor Households, \nthere is an appropriate design for socioeconomic development, i.e., item 6 (i) \u201c\u2026explore alternatives to the \npresent (power sector) structure to improve the targeting of poor households.\u201d etc. However there is no \nmonitoring or evaluation specified. \n \nIt may be that M&E design and implementation is being performed by the Government and its auxiliaries but \nthis is not reported in the RRP and PCR. \n \n \n 7. Other (safeguards, including governance and anticorruption; fiduciary aspects):  \n \nSafeguards on social issues were well handled through the consultancy contracts, particularly the following.  \n \nPart  E:  Support  the  creation  of  an  autonomous  regulatory  body  with,  among  other  responsibilities, \n(i) conducting studies of the social impacts of overall tariff levels and alternative rate designs on each retail \ncustomer class, particularly small, rural, and poor customers, and (ii) developing and administering programs \nto educate customers regarding the restructuring of the power sector and to solicit consumer participation in \nits regulatory processes.  \n \nPart H: Strengthening consumer participation in a competitive electricity market.  \nThere were no environmental issues addressed in the design of the Project, and none were necessary. It is \nconsidered that any environmental issues would be indirect, resulting from expansion of the power sector. \n \nGovernance, anticorruption and fiduciary aspects were not tasks within the scope of work for the TA loan but \nthe TA loan and all of the consultancy contracts were subject to the standard ADB provisions on these \nsubjects and have been monitored through the ADB review missions. There were no problems identified \nduring the course of the Project on these issues. \n \n ", "  13\n8. Ratings:  PCR  OED Review  Reason for Disagreement/Comments \nRelevance:  Irrelevant  Partly  This validation gives more credence to the \nRelevant  achievements of the TA objectives, \nparticularly the capacity building and socio-\neconomic outcomes. \nEffectiveness in Achieving  Ineffective  Less Effective  This validation considered more outputs \nOutcome:  could be achieved and thus more effective or \nless (partly) effective outcomes. \nEfficiency in Achieving  Inefficient  Inefficient   \nOutcome and Outputs: \nPreliminary Assessment of  Less Likely  Less Likely   \nSustainability: \nPerformance of Borrower and  Satisfactory  Satisfactory   \nEA: \nPerformance of ADB:  Partly  Satisfactory  PCR says that \u201cthe TA Loan would have \nSatisfactory  been better designed if it had been \nprocessed after an electricity law had been \napproved\u2026\u201d This is true, however the real \ndamage was the annulment of the new \nElectricity Law. Had the law been allowed to \nstand (as any experienced designer would \nhave expected) the project performance \nwould have been satisfactory. This was a \ncase of force majeure and ADB\u2019s \nperformance was therefore \u201csatisfactory\u201d. \nImpact:  Negligible4  Moderate  The PCR does not credit the TA loan with \nany significant positive impacts, whereas this \nvalidation considers that the capacity gained \nby the Government and its auxiliaries and the \nsocioeconomic outputs of the TA will provide \ncontinuing positive impacts on the power \nsector and the social environment.  \nOverall Assessment:  Unsuccessful  Partly  This validation has considered that there are \nSuccessful  more potential positive impacts from the TA \nloan than were identified in the PCR.  \nQuality of PCR:    Satisfactory  Although this validation has taken a number \nof different positions with respect to the \nperformance of the TA loan, nonetheless all \nof the important information on the project is \nin the PCR for the reader to form his or her \nown opinion and therefore is satisfactory. \n \n                                                 \n4 The PCR does not make a specific statement on Impact but does provide the following comment, \u201cAs the TA Loan \ndid not achieve its purpose, there are no impacts identified in terms of poverty reduction, the environment, and \nsocial protection. However, the delay in the power sector\u2019s restructuring may affect the needed investment in the \npower sector through private sector participation and public-private partnership. That, in turn, will negatively affect \nsocioeconomic development in the country.\u201d This validation has considered this to be a negligible rating for Impact. \nThis validation does not agree with this assessment. Whatever the TA Loan did not achieve is a lost impact or a do \nnothing situation, not a negative effect. \n ", "14  \n \n9. Comments on PCR Quality: \n \nSome minor comments are:  \n \nThe PCR and RRP did not indicate the design basis of the TA loan. The loan is for capacity building. \nLogically,  a  capacity  building  project  should  be  designed  on  the  basis  of  the  needs  of  the  target \norganization(s) which in turn should be based on some prior study, preferably an organizational study, \nincluding staffing needs versus existing staff capabilities. \n \nThe PCR and RRP did not specifically identify a number of pertinent outcomes and outputs of the TA loan. \nOnly one objective was identified in both reports, whereas this validation considers that there were nine \npertinent outcomes and 24 outputs in the TA loan. Had the PCR identified the outcomes and outputs in more \ndetail and assessed them individually, a higher level of assessment may have been given to of the Project for \ncapacity building and possible socioeconomic impacts. However, although not identified as outcomes and \noutputs, all the outcomes and outputs were nonetheless mentioned in the reports and in the design and \nimplementation of the Project. \n \nThe PCR is dated May 2007, 2.5 years after Project closing date of December 2004. No explanation is \nprovided for the long preparation period. Such a delay brings the quality of the report into question.  \n \nNotwithstanding these comments, the PCR is well written and generally complete in content. Substantial \ndocumentation and analysis has been provided to support the conclusions and recommendations. The \nassessment levels on performance are judgments and the PCR is considered as being fair but somewhat \nreserved in its assessment of the performance of the Project. Overall, the PCR is rated as \u201dsatisfactory\u201d. \n ", " \n \nREGIONAL DEPARTMENT\u2019S RESPONSE TO THE PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT \nVALIDATION REPORT \n \n \nOn 9 September 2007, Director, OED2, Operations Evaluation Department (OED), received the \nfollowing comments from the Energy Division of Southeast Asia Department. \n \n1.  We note that OED\u2019s validation report rates the technical assistance (TA) loan as \u201cPartly \nSuccessful\u201d which is different from project completion report\u2019s (PCR) \u201cUnsuccessful\u201d rating. We \nunderstand  that  OED\u2019s  favorable  rating  is  mainly  based  on  the  fact  the  TA  loan  was \nsubstantially completed prior to the annulment of the Electricity Law that rendered TA loan\u2019s \nmain outputs irrelevant. Had the PCR been done before the electricity law was annulled, it \nwould have rated the TA loan as \u201cPartly Successful.\u201d This is also the case for Loan 1673-INO \nfor Power Sector Restructuring Program (PSRP) to which this TA loan was piggy-backed. \nHowever, as the PCR was prepared in 2007 when it became very clear that the outputs of TA \nloan, so far as the establishment of a competitive market\u2013the main objective of the TA loan\u2013is \nconcerned, are no longer relevant. Furthermore, there is a continued delay in formulating a new \nElectricity Law. Based on these aspects, we suggested the above rating for the TA loan in the \nPCR that is lower than that given to PSRP in 2004.   \n  \n2.  We take note of OED\u2019s comments on the need for identifying pertinent outcomes and \nindicating the basis of the TA loan design in the PCR. We will ensure these points are taken into \naccount in the preparation of future PCRs. \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20080424152308+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0.5 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20080425151706+08'00'", "Title": "Capacity Building for the Establishment of a Competitive Electricity Market"}}
