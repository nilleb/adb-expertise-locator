Project Description as Stated in the Report and Recommendation of the President (RRP) \n  \n a. Rationale and Expected Impacts: \n \n\nAs stated in the RRP, \u201cIndonesia is in the grip of an unprecedented financial, economic, and social crisis that \ncalls  for  radical  and  decisive  reforms  to  restore  domestic  and  international  investor  confidence.  Bank \nassistance during 1999 will be guided by the short-term interim strategy formulated in response to the crisis. \nThis  strategy  stresses  assisting  the  Government  in  implementing  major  economic  policy  and  institutional \nreforms, and mitigating the social distress spawned by the crisis. Bank support of the Government\u2019s initiative \nfor  structural  reforms  in  the  power  sector  is  considered  essential  given  the  urgent  need  for  reforms  to \novercome the inefficiencies resulting from overregulation and inappropriate financial policies whose adverse \nimpact  on  the  sector  was  less  apparent  during  periods  of  high  and  sustained  growth.  Without  the  reforms \nenvisaged  under  the  Power  Sector  Restructuring  Program  (PSRP),  the  electricity  supply  industry  which  is \nreeling under the impact of the crisis, cannot survive. Ensuring a stable supply of electricity is essential for the \ncountry\u2019s  economic  recovery.  The  Program  provides  a  sound  basis  for  the  Government  to  carry  out  reform \nand restructuring of the power sector. \n \n b. Objectives or Expected Outcomes: \n  \nIn  the  RRP  and  the  PCR  only  one  objective  is  stated  for  the  TA  loan:  \u201c\u2026to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the \nGovernment and the national power company, Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) to facilitate establishment of \na  competitive  electricity  market.\u201d  However,  there  were  more  objectives  and  outputs  for  the  TA  loan.  The \nobjective  of  the  Power  Sector  Restructuring  Program  (PSRP)  was  \u201d\u2026the  actual  establishment  of  a \n\n\f 2 \n\ncompetitive market for electricity in Java-Bali.\u201d This objective of the PSRP was an expected outcome of the \nTA loan. From the RRP, a total of nine1 expected outcomes of the TA loan were identified in this validation: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\nestablishment of a competitive electricity market in Java and Bali (which includes the capacity \nof  the  Government  and  its  auxiliaries  to  operate  and  maintain  the  competitive  electricity \nmarket);  \nlower tariffs in real terms; \nimprovement in the economic growth, from efficiency gains in the power sector; \nstakeholder acceptance of electricity tariff increases; \nimprovement in poverty reduction resulting from the economic growth and lower tariffs; \nsmall consumer awareness and gain in bargaining power; \ndevelopment of appropriate instruments to finance poor electricity consumers; \nachievement  of  practical  and  effective  methods  of  energy  conservation  to  help  mitigate  the \neffects of tariff increases; and  \ninstitutional development.  \n\n \nNote:  As  stated  above,  the  PCR  defined  only  one  specific  objective  or  outcome.  The  other  outcomes \nidentified above are mentioned at different places in the report but are not identified collectively as outcomes. \n \nThe RRP defined eight components, identified as parts in the TA loan:  \n\n \n\nPart A.  developing a competitive electricity market\u2014market rules, \nPart B. developing a competitive electricity market\u2014financial settlement,  \nPart C. developing a competitive electricity market\u2014software specifications,  \nPart D. developing computer software for operation of a competitive bulk electricity market,  \nPart E. providing support for the development of power sector regulatory capabilities,  \nPart F. providing support for the power sector restructuring secretariat,  \nPart G. assisting in building acceptance of electricity tariff increases, and \nPart H. strengthening consumer participation in a competitive electricity market. \n\n \nThe project design established each of the components as a separate consulting services contract. \nDuring the course of the Project, Parts D and F were cancelled, as discussed in para. 3b. \n\n \n c. Outputs: \n\n \nOutputs  in  the  RRP  and  PCR  were  considered  to  be  identical  to  the  above  components.  However,  in  this \nvalidation a number of the components are considered to provide more than one output. These outputs are \ndefined in Appendix 1, showing 24 distinct outputs within the six components (i.e., excluding Parts D and F). \n\n \n \n3. Evaluation of Design and Implementation (evaluator assessment of actual versus envisioned) \n \n a.  Relevance of design and formulation \n \n\nAs  reported  in  the  PCR,  the  concept  for  the  design  of  the  PSRP  was  outlined  in  the  Government\u2019s  Power \nSector Restructuring  Policy  in  August  1998.  The policy  aimed  to restore  financial  viability  to  PLN,  establish \ncompetition in the Java and Bali power sector, and increase the benefits of private sector participation. The \npolicy  was  formulated  after  a  series  of  consultations  with  key  stakeholders  in  the  electricity  sector.  The \nimplementation plan for the restructuring was also discussed in a workshop held in December 1998, attended \nby representatives of consumer groups, independent power producers, industry, and multilateral and bilateral \naid  agencies.  Therefore  the  policy  was  well  vetted  by  the  stakeholders.  The  design  and  implementation \nstrategy  of  the  PSRP  and  related  TA  loan  were  consistent  with  this  policy  objective.  They  were  also \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s 1995 energy policy and its operational strategy to deal with situations arising out of the \n\n                                                 \n1 In order to understand the impacts arising from the annulment of the new Electricity Law, re paragraph 3.a, it was \n\nnecessary to identify the detailed outcomes here in paragraph 2.b, and the detailed outputs in paragraph 2.d. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nfinancial crisis. Thus the design of the TA loan was relevant at the start of the Project. \n \nThe  design  of  the  PSRP  and  the  TA  loan  was  prepared  with  the  view  that  a  draft  electricity  law  being \nconsidered by parliament at the start of the Project would be ratified. The PSRP and TA loan started in March \n1999. The new Electricity Law was to establish a competitive electricity market and an independent regulatory \nboard,  and  was  enacted  on  4  September  2002.  However,  on  15  December  2004,  the  Constitutional  Court \nstated  that  the  new  Electricity  Law  contained  provisions  that  contradicted  the  1945  Constitution.  The  court \ntherefore ruled to annul the new Law and to put the old Law No.15/1985 back in place. It is noted that the \nannulment took place almost 4 years after the Project start date, when the work on the TA loan had just been \ncompleted and work on the PSRP was well advanced. The provisions that violated the constitution related to \nthe establishment of a competitive market and the unbundling of the PLN. These were key elements of the \nPSRP policy framework and therefore prevented the PSRP from meeting its objective and negated much of \nthe work performed under the TA loan.  \n \nSince the annulment was so devastating, a question arises with respect to the relevance of the design and \nformulation  of  the  PSRP  and  the  TA  loan.  With  respect  to  the  TA  loan  there  are  four  issues;  the  first  two \narising from the PCR.  \n \nThe PCR concludes that, \u201cOverall, the TA loan was relevant to the country\u2019s overall development needs at the \ntime of appraisal. As the new Electricity Law was annulled, however, the TA\u2019s design and formulation had lost \nits relevance by the time of its completion.\u201d The position of this validation is that the TA loan lost a great deal \nof its effectiveness and relevance\u2014but not all. The fundamental goal of the PSRP and the TA loan was not a \ncompetitive electricity market but increased economic development and poverty reduction. A number of the \noutputs of the consultants\u2019 contracts for the TA loan that were directed toward capacity building and poverty \nreduction  were  achieved.  These  outcomes  were  small  achievements  compared  to  the  main  expected \noutcome (a competitive electricity market), but were relevant at appraisal and are today.  \n \nBecause  of  delays  in  implementation  of  the  PSRP  and  the  subsequent  need  to  delay  the  TA  tasks,  as \ndescribed in para. 3c, the PCR, in para. 21, states that, \u201c...the TA Loan would have been better designed if it \nhad been processed after an electricity law had been approved and had been directed to providing support for \nimplementing  such  electricity  law  after  its  enactment.\u201d  This  validation  is  of  the  view,  considering  the \ncomplexity of the components and the urgent need for implementation (the original schedule was 36 months \nto complete all eight components), that there was not much flexibility in the schedule. Therefore, although in \nhindsight  the  scheduling  of  tasks  may  have  been  improved  it  was  formulated  satisfactorily.  This  view  is \nsupported by the satisfactory completion of the consultants\u2019 contracts.  \n \nThe other design and formulation issues are as follows. \n \nThe devastating impact caused by the annulment of the new Electricity Law begs the question: were the risks \nappropriately  considered  and  addressed  in  the  design  of  the  TA  loan?  There  was  certainly  knowledge  and \nconcern in ADB at the time of appraisal regarding the risks with respect to the performance of the Borrower.2 \nHowever,  the  annulment  of  the  new  Electricity  Law  by  the  Constitutional  Court  in  December  2004  is \nconsidered  by  this  validation  to  have  been  a  force  majeure  that  it  was  impossible  for  the  designers  of  the \nPSRP  and  TA  loan  to  have  foreseen  as  a  specific  risk.  It  was  also  an  issue  beyond  the  control  of  the \nGovernment and all other parties associated with the design of the TA loan. It was noted that in Part E of the \nconsultants\u2019  terms  of  reference  that  legal  assistance  was  apparently  provided  in  drafting  operating  licenses \nand developing procedural regulations to ensure compliance with Indonesian law. Thus not only the designers \nof the PSRP and TA loan, but also the legal consultants, the executing agency (EA) and parliament failed to \nrecognize the risk of constitutional conflict. Thus the action of annulment of the new Electricity Law does not \nindicate lack of diligence in the consideration of risk in formulating the TA loan.  \n\nApart from the actual design of the TA loan, there is a question regarding the basis of design. The PCR and \nthe  RRP  do  not  report  on  the  basis  of  the  design  of  the  TA  loan.  The  TA  loan  was  designed  for  capacity \nbuilding for restructuring of the power sector. Logically a capacity building project should be designed on the \n\n                                                                                                                                                             \n2 Re the Record of Discussions at Board Meeting of 23 March1999.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\n \n\n \n\nbasis of the needs of the target organization(s), which in turn should be based on some prior study, preferably \nan organizational study, including staffing needs versus existing staff capabilities. Major infrastructure projects \nare generally preceded by and based on feasibility studies. Although there probably was a sound basis for the \ndesign  of  the  TA  loan,  the  information  was  not  available  in  ADB  files.  Thus  this  validation  does  not  know \ndefinitively  how  relevant  the  design  of  the  TA  loan  is  with  respect  to  the  needs  of  the  Government  and  its \nauxiliaries.  There  is,  however,  some  assurance  of  relevance  since  the  PSRP  and  the  TA  loan  were  well \nvetted by many stakeholders. The issue in this paragraph is not the relevance of the design but the absence \nof a report on the basis of the design of the TA loan in the RRP and PCR to substantiate its relevance.  \n\nAs  indicated  above,  the  PCR  rated  the  TA  loan  as  having  lost  its  relevance.  In  consideration  of  the  above \npoints  and  particularly  the  capacity  building  achievements  and  social  development  outputs,  this  validation \nrates the design and formulation, overall, as \u201cpartly relevant\u201d. \n\nb. Components (or Key Conditions in the case of Program Loans): Outputs and costs by component \nas envisioned during appraisal as compared with actual costs and achievement of outputs; reasons \nfor any deviation: \n \nThe TA loan defined eight components as outlined in paragraph 2d above. The components are repeated in \nthe following table, with actual costs at completion shown in comparison with appraisal estimates. \n \nThe actual cost of the project, $7.815 million, was markedly less than $20 million envisaged at appraisal. The \nmajor cost reductions were due to the cancellation of parts D and F of the TA loan. Parts D and F aside, the \nproject costs for the remaining six components of the loan were all close to budget with the total cost being \nunder  budget,  as  shown  on  the  bottom  line  of  the  following  table.  In  January  2002,  at  the  request  of  the \nborrower, a major change in the TA loan was approved, which was to delete parts D and F from the scope of \nwork. \n \nPart D was cancelled, because of delays in the schedule, as discussed in paragraph 3c. With the delay in the \nschedule, Part D for computer software development was not needed until 2006, which would require the TA \nloan to remain active for this one task, an additional 4 years beyond the original closing date. ADB considered \nit  more  appropriate  to  refinance  Part  D  under  a  later  loan  (which  it  did  under  a  loan  to  the  Republic  of \nIndonesia for the Power Transmission Improvement Sector Project.).  \n\n \n\nPart  F  was  cancelled  because  the  same  or  similar  tasks  were  being  performed  under  a  capacity  building \nproject funded by the United States Agency for International Development. Although not specifically reported \non in the PCR, it appears that the work under this task was being carried out satisfactorily.  \n \nThis  validation  considers  that  deleting  these  components  and  cancelling  the  corresponding  parts  of  the  TA \nloan was good project management in adapting to changing conditions. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nCOMPARISON OF PROJECT COST AT APPRAISAL AND COMPLETION \n \n($000) \n\nItem \nA.

Project Cost, Disbursements, Borrower Contribution, and Conformance to Schedule (as relevant to \n\nproject performance): \n\n \n\n Project Cost, Disbursements relevant to Project Performance \n \nAs reported above, the cost of the project was markedly less than envisaged at appraisal, mainly due to the \ncancellation  of  Parts  D  and  F.  The  other  six  tasks  collectively  were  completed  under  budget  and  with \nsatisfactory  performance.  During  the  course  of  the  Project  the  project  tasks  and  disbursements  had  to  be \nrescheduled because of delays in the PSRP activities, extending the duration of loan effectiveness from the \noriginal 42 months to 69 months, as shown in the table below. The disbursement schedule had to be revised \non  four  occasions.  However,  because  there  were  6  components  with  6  different  consulting  contracts,  the \ncontracts and disbursements were able to be staggered to better meet the prevailing conditions. The delays \ndid  not  affect  the  quality  of  the  TA  outputs--although  the  outputs  were  not  effective  or  only  partly  effective \nbecause  of  the  eventual  cancellation  of  the  new  Electricity  Law.  Project  cost  and  disbursements  are  rated \n\u201csatisfactory\u201d with respect to performance. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\n \n\nKey Dates Relating To the Performance and Disbursements: \n\nActivity \n\nDate \n\nLoan Effectiveness \nOriginal  Expected  Completion  of  Consulting \nServices  \nFinal \nDisbursement: \n\n-Original Scheduled Date  \n-Actual Date \n\n23 March 1999 \nApril 2002 \n\n1 October 2002 \n22 December 2004 \n\n Source: Project Completion Report. \n \n\n   Borrower Contribution Relevant to Project Performance \n\nRunning \nMonths \n\n0 \n36 \n\n42 \n69 \n\nThe total cost of the TA loan financed by ADB was $7.815 million, at completion. The Government provided \nsupport  in  kind,  including  office  accommodation,  local  transportation  and  counterpart  staff,  estimated  in  the \nRRP at $683,000 for the six parts of the TA loan that were implemented. The actual cost of the Government \ncontribution was not reported but the support was considered by the ADB to be appropriate.  \n \nConformance to Schedule (as relevant to project performance) \nInitially, the TA loan was to be implemented within a period of 36 months, starting April 1999. However, the \nimplementation of the PSRP and the TA were delayed because of changes in PLN restructuring, extension of \ntime to carry out the acceptance of regulatory and institutional changes, adjusting tariffs; and, particularly, a \nbacklog in parliament that slowed deliberation of the new Electricity Law. Nevertheless, the TA work was not \nderailed  and  consulting  contracts  were  completed  satisfactorily  and  within  budget.  The  implementation  of \ncomponents under the TA loan and their completion dates are shown in the following table, from the PCR. \n\n \n\nTechnical Assistance Implementation by Component \n\nComponent \n\nContract \nCompletion Date \n31 Mar 2001 \n\nPart  A:  Developing  a  Competitive  Electricity \nMarket\u2014Market Rules \n\nCompletion Date of \nDeliverables \n\nrules \nrules \ndeveloped \n\n(including \nfor  Batam \nby \n\nMarket \nspecific \nGrid) \nDecember 2003. \nFinal  report  submitted \nSeptember 2003. \nSoftware \nspecifications \ndeveloped  by  December \n2004. \nCancelled \n\nin \n\n6 Aug 2003 \n\n31 Aug 2004 \n\nDec 2000 \n\n31 Oct 2002 \n\nJun 1999 \n\nFinal  report  submitted \nOctober 2002. \nCancelled \n\nin \n\n31 Jul 2002 \n\nTasks completed (Note 1) \n\n1 Jul 2001 \n\nFinal  report  submitted \nOctober 2002. \n\nin \n\nPart  B:  Developing  a  Competitive  Electricity \nMarket\u2014Financial Settlement \nPart  C:  Developing  a  Competitive  Electricity \nMarket\u2014Software Specifications \n\nPart  D:  Developing  Computer  Software  for \nOperation  of  a  Competitive  Bulk  Electricity \nMarket \nPart E: Providing Support for Development of \nPower Sector Regulatory Capabilities \nPart  F:  Providing  Support  for  the  Power \nSector Restructuring Secretariat \nPart  G:  Assisting  in  Building  Acceptance  of \nElectricity Tariff Increases \nPart H: Strengthening Consumer Participation \nin a Competitive Electricity Market \nNote 1 Date of completion not indicated in PCR. \nSource: Project Completion Report. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\n d. Implementation Arrangements, Conditions and Covenants, and related Technical Assistance:  \n  \n\nImplementation Arrangements \nThe  Executing  Agency  for  the  PSRP  and  the  TA  loan  was  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  the  focal  point  for \npolicy reforms was the Director General for Electricity and Energy Utilization (DGEEU). An electricity sector \nrestructuring team within DGEEU was responsible for the administration of the PSRP and the TA loan. The \nteam was also in charge of preparing the new Electricity Law and developing the blueprint for implementation. \nReports were periodically submitted to ADB by DGEEU. Six consulting firms were engaged to implement the \nTA  loan.  Recruitment  of  the  consultants  was  through  competition  among  short-listed  qualified  firms  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  \n \nADB  closely monitored  the  implementation  of  the  PSRP  and  the  TA  loan  through  an  inception  mission and \nfive review missions fielded during the course of the loan, 1999\u20132004. \n \nDelays  in  the  schedule  and  annulment  of  the  new  Electricity  Law  were  not  a  consequence  of  the \nimplementation arrangements. Therefore the implementation arrangements are rated \u201csatisfactory\u201d. \n\nConditions and Covenants \nConditions and covenants of the TA loan addressed the due diligence, efficiency and sound practices of the \ntechnical  assistance  provided  under  the  loan.  According  to  the  project  performance  reports,  throughout  the \nperiod of the Project, the performance of the Borrower on conditions and covenants was \u201csatisfactory\u201d.  \n \nIt is noted that the completion report to be provided by the Borrower, in accordance with the covenant in the \nTA Loan Agreement, Section 4.07.c, was not available in ADB files and probably was not submitted by the \nBorrower. Apart from being noncompliant, if it was not submitted, the completion report of the Borrower with \nthe  Borrower\u2019s  viewpoints  on  the  delays,  annulment  of  the  new  Electricity  Law  and  Project  achievements \nshould be valuable with regard to lessons to be learned. Overall, this validation rates the performance of the \nBorrower on Conditions and Covenants as \u201csatisfactory\u201d. \n\n  \n\ne. Performance of the Borrower and Executing Agency: \n \nThe  PCR  did  not  report  comprehensively  on  the  performance  of  the  Borrower  and  Executing  Agency  with \nrespect to the management of the TA loan. However, it did report that the Borrower met the conditions and \ncovenants, as indicated in paragraph 3d above. ADB review missions all reported the overall performance of \nthe Project to be \u201csatisfactory\u201d or \u201cpartly satisfactory\u201d. There were issues of concern with respect to annulment \nof the new Electricity Law and delays but these were not as a result of the performance of the Borrower or the \nExecuting Agency. \n \nUnder the management of the Executing Agency, the outputs by the consultants were completed satisfactorily \nand within the overall budget. As with the Borrower and Executing Agency, delays in the project schedule and \nannulment of the new Electricity Law were not attributable to the consultants. There is one issue outstanding:  \nsubmission  of  the  completion  report  by  the  Borrower.  Overall  this  validation  rates  the  performance  of  the \nBorrower, the Executing Agency, and the consultants as \u201csatisfactory\u201d, in agreement with the PCR. \n\n \n  f.  Performance of the Asian Development Bank: \n \n\nThe project appraisal, design and initiation of the TA loan proceeded appropriately. The ADB review missions \nfielded during the course of the Project closely monitored the implementation of the power sector restructuring \nand associated activities under the TA loan. As indicated above, there were issues of concern with respect to \ndelays  in  the  Project  schedule,  and  annulment  of  the  new  Electricity  Law  but  these  were  not  as  a  result  of \nADB performance.  \n \nThe PCR and RRP did not specifically identify the pertinent outcomes and outputs of the TA loan. Only one \nobjective  was  identified  in  both  reports  and  when  this  objective  was  not  clearly  met,  the  PCR  rated  the  TA \nloan  as  \u201cirrelevant\u201d  and  \u201cunsuccessful\u201d.  However,  this  validation  considers  that  there  were  nine  pertinent \nexpected outcomes and 24 outputs, with some achievements and expected positive impacts. These were not \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\nvery significant impacts but they should have been acknowledged. Had the PCR identified the outcomes and \noutputs in more detail, he Project may have been given a higher level of assessment for capacity building and \npotential socioeconomic impacts.  \n \nThe  basis  of  design  of  the  TA  loan  was  not  provided  in  the  PCR  or  the  RRP,  which  should  be  standard \npractice in capacity building projects.  \n \nThe PCR rated the ADB performance in program design and implementation \u201cpartly satisfactory\u201d. Overall this \nvalidation rates the ADB performance as \u201csatisfactory\u201d,  mainly because of its satisfactory management of a \ncomplex contract. The above critical comments are on individual issues. \n\n \n4. Evaluation of Performance (Evaluator assessment): \n \n\n \n\na.  Relevance \n \nAt  the  time  of  appraisal,  the  design  of  the  PSRP  and  the  TA  loan  were  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s \npower  sector  restructuring  policy  and  ADB\u2019s  energy  policy.  The  PSRP  and  TA  loan  proceeded  with \nimplementation in accordance with that design fully expecting the ratification of the new Electricity Law. The \nperformance of the Borrower, Executing Agency and consultants for the TA was evaluated as \u201csatisfactory\u201d by \nADB  and  therefore  \u201crelevant\u201d.  All  outputs  of  the  TA  loan  were  achieved.  No  changes  in  the  design  were \nrequired and the design remained relevant throughout the course of the Project. However, a number of the \nsignificant outputs became ineffective and irrelevant as a result of the annulment of the new Electricity Law. It \nis noted that the Project was completed before annulment of the New Electricity Law and thus it was too late \nto make any changes in the design of the Project to improve on its effectiveness and relevance.  \n \nThe  PCR  did  not  identify  pertinent  outcomes  and  outputs  and  did  not  report  on  the  basis  of  the  design. \nHowever,  although  the  PCR  did  not  explain  the  basis  of  design,  because  the  design  was  well  vetted  by \nstakeholders,  it  was  relevant.  This  view  is  supported  because  the  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants\u2019 \ncontracts were comprehensive and of a high standard.  \n \nOverall this validation rates the performance of the TA loan as \u201crelevant\u201d at the time of appraisal and \u201cpartly \nrelevant\u201d at the time of completion of the Project. \n\n \nb.  Effectiveness in Achieving Outcome \n \nThe PCR reported that, \u201c\u2026some actions of the PSRP, relating to tariff adjustments and financial restructuring \nof  PLN  were  initiated\u2026\u201d  The  PCR  also  stated  that,  \u201c\u2026as  a  consequence  of  the  new  Electricity  Law  being \nannulled no progress in the PSRP has been made in PLN\u2019s unbundling, introduction of competitive markets, \nand  establishment  of  an  independent  electricity  regulator\u201d.  Therefore,  the  TA  loan  was  considered \n\u201cineffective\u201d in achieving the TA loan\u2019s anticipated outcome.\u201d This validation agrees with the PCR statement \non  the  facts  but  does  not  consider  that  the  TA  loan  was  totally  ineffective.  It  is  noted  that  there  is  mostly \nagreement  between  the  PCR  and  this  validation\u2014so  that  the  differences  are  in  assessment  of  the  level  of \neffectiveness  and  not  with  respect  to  the  outcomes.  For  this  validation,  the  main  considerations  for  the \nassessment of outcomes are that the TA loan was a capacity building project and that capacity building has \nbeen performed satisfactorily. The capacity building and training provided through the TA loan should remain \nwith  the  Government  and  its  auxiliaries  in  the  pursuit  of  a  more  effective  power  sector.  There  are  also  a \nnumber of potential effective socioeconomic outcomes resulting from outputs achieved by the TA consultants. \nAn assessment of the outcomes, as defined in paragraph 2b, supporting the overall rating of the TA loan as \n\u201cless effective\u201d (using the terminology of Project Performance Evaluation Report Guidelines). \n \nIt should be noted that the expected outcomes of the PSPR were very ambitious\u2014to achieve unbundling of \nPLN  and  establish  a  competitive  electricity  market.  If  these  outcomes  had  been  achieved,  the  rating  would \nhave  been  \u201chighly  effective\u201d.  Since  some  of  the  outcomes  were  achieved,  the  Project  has  to  have  a  rating \nhigher than \u201cineffective\u201d. \n \n\n\f \n\nExpected Outcomes \n\nStatus \n\nStatus and Assessment of Expected Outcomes \n\nActual establishment of a \ncompetitive market for \nelectricity in Java-Bali.  \n\nAlthough the capacity of the Government and PLN \nhave been strengthened, resulting from the training \nand association with the consultants, the establishment \nof a competitive electricity market was not achieved. \n\nLower tariffs in real terms.

Efficiency in Achieving Outcome and Outputs \n \nThe  PCR  claims  the  outputs  became  irrelevant  because  of  the  annulment  of  the  new  Electricity  Law  and \ntherefore it considered the TA loan \u201cinefficient\u201d. However, this validation has pointed out that the TA loan was \npartly  effective.  As  for  its  efficiency,  if  the  outcome  is  low  (\u201cless  effective\u201d)  compared  to  the  input  then  the \nefficiency is low (or \u201cinefficient\u201d). Thus this validation agrees with the PCR and rates the outcome of the TA as \n\u201cinefficient\u201d. \n \nd. Preliminary Assessment of Sustainability \n \nThe  PCR  states  that,  \u201cAs  the  Electricity  Law  was  annulled  the  Project\u2019s  sustainability  is  \u201cless  likely\u201d  unless \nfurther reforms are undertaken.\u201d Because of the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision with respect to unbundling of \nPLN and the competitive electricity market, further major reforms are expected to be slow in coming. Some \nexpected  outcomes  have  been  achieved  and  are  expected  to  be  sustainable.  However,  the  expected \noutcomes that have not been achieved (unbundling of PLN, establishment of a competitive electricity market) \nare those that would have had the most impact. Therefore the sustainability of the TA outcomes is mixed and, \noverall, this validation rates the sustainability as \u201cless likely\u201d in agreement with the PCR. \n \ne. Impact (both intended and unintended) \n \nThe  PCR  states  that,  \u201cthe  TA  Loan  did  not  achieve  its  purpose,  there  are  no  impacts  identified  in  terms  of \npoverty  reduction,  the  environment,  and  social  protection.\u201d  This  validation  has  a  somewhat  different  view. \nCertainly  with  the  competitive  electricity  market  not  being  achieved,  the  intended  impacts--expected \nImprovement  in  the  economic  growth  from  efficiency  gains  in  the  power  sector,  improvement  in  poverty \nreduction resulting from the economic growth and lower tariffs in real terms--have been lost. On the negative \nside, there has probably been an unintended and demoralizing impact on the staff who supported and worked \ndiligently  towards  the  PSRP  and  TA  loan  objectives.  However,  without  diminishing  those  losses,  following \nfrom its assessment of relevance and effectiveness above, this validation notes that the TA loan did achieve \nall of its outputs and a number of expected outcomes in whole or in part. A significant positive impact is that, \nfollowing  the  satisfactory  completion  of  the  consulting  contracts,  the  Government  and  its  auxiliaries  have \nacquired  some  capability  with  respect  to  establishment  and  operation  of  a  competitive  electricity  market, \nwhich is still the ultimate objective of the Government for the power sector. Similarly the effective and partly \neffective  social  outcomes  identified  in  the  Status  and  Assessment  of  Expected  Outcomes,--small  gains  in \nconsumer  awareness  and  in  bargaining  power,  development  of  appropriate  instruments  to  finance  poor \nelectricity consumers, achievement of practical and effective methods of energy conservation to help mitigate \nthe  effects  of  tariff  increases--should  have  positive  impacts  on  the  social  well  being  of  the  electricity \nconsumers. Project impacts have yet to fully appear\u2014and no monitoring and evaluation of project outcomes \nhas  been  reported.  Therefore  the  impacts,  although  expected,  are  still  to  be  substantiated.  This  validation \nthus rates the impacts as \u201cmoderate\u201d.  \n\n5. Overall Assessment, Lessons, and Recommendations (Evaluator assessment): \n \n\na.  Overall Assessment \n \nThe  quality  of  the  outputs  was  \u201csatisfactory\u201d.  The  delays  in  implementation,  although  significant,  were \nmanageable and the Project was completed under budget. Two of the eight components were cancelled in \nthe  TA  loan,  but  were  accomplished  through  other  contracts.  Annulment  of  the  new  Electricity  Law  and \nsubsequent failure to achieve a competitive electricity market was devastating for the PSRP and the TA loan \nmain objectives but this was beyond the control of Government and ADB. Issues that were questioned: the \nabsence of an identification of pertinent outcomes and outputs and of a report on the basis of design of the \nTA loan were individual issues that did not detract from the value of the Project. Much was accomplished in \ncapacity  building  and  some  of  the  expected  outcomes  for  socio-economic  development  can  be  pursued \nfollowing completion of the Project. Overall the TA loan was \u201cpartly successful.\u201d  \n\n\f11\n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n \n \nb.  Lessons \n \nTwo lessons were identified in the PCR. This validation agrees with the one lesson, which is:  \n\nIn  implementing  a  program  of  power  sector  reforms,  thorough  policy  research  and  design, \nalong with adequate assessment of the constitutional and legal constraints, should be ensured \nat the time of program formulation.  \n\n \nThe second lesson from the PCR is stated as: \n\nAs  the  TA  loan  was  formulated  prior  to  adoption  of  the  New  Electricity  Law,  some  of  its \ncomponents  had  to  be  adjusted,  delayed,  or  even  cancelled.  With  hindsight,  the  TA  loan \nshould have been provided after enactment of the new Electricity Law so as to provide targeted \nsupport  to  implementation  of  the  law.    In  this  validation,  the  problem  vis-\u00e0-vis  the  new \nElectricity  Law  was  not  to  provide  targeted  support  but  rather  to  address  risks  carefully.  And \nthe  designers  did  consider  the  risks  carefully  but  this  particular  risk  of  annulment  was  not \nidentified.  In  project  scheduling  one  cannot  always  wait  until  all  risks  are  identified  before \nproceeding with implementation. Therefore the lesson that the designers did address but to be \nreinforced is to address risks carefully in Project design. \n\n \nThis validation would add two further lessons.  \n\nThe  basis  of  the  design  of  capacity  building  projects  should  be  included  in  the  appraisal  for \ncapacity building projects and reported in RRPs and PCRs, particularly to show relevance. \n\nAll of the outcomes and outputs should be identified in the RRP, in the design and in the PCR, \nto keep the Project focused and to monitor and evaluate achievements. \n\n \nc.  Recommendations \n \nThis validation agrees with the five recommendations identified in the PCR, which are paraphrased below.  \n \n1.  Project Related \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nFuture Monitoring. For the Indonesian power sector, ADB should monitor the preparation of a \nnew  electricity  law  and  engage  the  Government  in  high-level  policy  dialogue.  It  is \nrecommended  that  a  new  electricity  law,  while  respecting  the  Constitution,  should  retain  the \nspirit of the annulled law and be quickly followed by implementing regulations.  \nFurther Action or Follow-Up. As PLN will continue to dominate the sector in the foreseeable \nfuture, its institutional capacity should be strengthened in such areas as project planning and \nimplementation, financial management, and corporate governance. \nAdditional  Assistance.  As  planned new  generation  projects will not  be  available  until  2010, \nthe  Government  has  identified  energy  efficiency  as  a  tool  for  reducing  the  demand  and \ndistribution  losses.  ADB  may  consider  providing  assistance  to  support  energy  efficiency  and \ncost-reduction efforts in order to improve PLN\u2019s overall efficiency and to reduce subsidies. \nTiming  of  the  Project  Performance  Evaluation  Report. Since this TA loan was processed \nand  implemented  along  with  PSRP,  it  is  recommended  that  the  Project  Performance \nEvaluation Report of the TA loan be conducted together with that of PSRP.3 \n\nWhen  designing  a  complex  sector  reform  program  in  ADB\u2019s  member  countries,  ADB  should \nengage  the  services  of  a  qualified  domestic  legal  expert  to  ensure  the  legality  of  the  reform \npackage. \n\n                                                 \n3   Without expressing an opinion, it is noted that this recommendation was not adopted for this Project. \n\n \n2. General \n\n(i) \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f 12 \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n2.  Recommendations Supplementary to the PCR \n \n\nIn  appraising  capacity  building  projects  (or  projects  with  capacity  building  components)  the \nbasis  of  the  design  should  be  appraised.  The  needs  versus  the  capacity  of  the  target \norganization(s) should be assessed and reported in the RRPs, particularly to show relevance. \n\nADB should obtain a copy of the Borrower\u2019s completion report, in accordance with Article 4.07 \n(c)  of  the  TA  Loan  Agreement.    The  Borrower  should  be  requested  to  address  in  detail  the \nreasons why the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision came as a surprise. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 6. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization (Evaluator assessment): \n \n\nThere is no M&E design referred to in the RRP or the PCR. In the RRP:  \n \nitem  21  states,  \u201c\u2026  the  proposed  working  group  on  participation  and  Government  regulators\u2026  will  closely \nmonitor  and  assess  the  impact  of  tariff  changes  during  the  program  period\u201d.  However  this  activity  is \napparently designed to obtain acceptance of proposed rate changes rather than any social pursuits.  \n\nIn  the  terms  of  reference  for  the  consulting  services  contract  Part  G,  item  4,  Support  for  Poor  Households, \nthere  is  an  appropriate  design  for socioeconomic  development,  i.e.,  item  6  (i)  \u201c\u2026explore  alternatives  to  the \npresent  (power  sector)  structure  to  improve  the  targeting  of  poor  households.\u201d  etc.  However  there  is  no \nmonitoring or evaluation specified. \n\nIt may be that M&E design and implementation is being performed by the Government and its auxiliaries but \nthis is not reported in the RRP and PCR. \n \n\n 7. Other (safeguards, including governance and anticorruption; fiduciary aspects):  \n \n\nSafeguards on social issues were well handled through the consultancy contracts, particularly the following.  \n \nPart  E:  Support  the  creation  of  an  autonomous  regulatory  body  with,  among  other  responsibilities, \n(i) conducting studies of the social impacts of overall tariff levels and alternative rate designs on each retail \ncustomer class, particularly small, rural, and poor customers, and (ii) developing and administering programs \nto educate customers regarding the restructuring of the power sector and to solicit consumer participation in \nits regulatory processes.  \n\n \n\nPart H: Strengthening consumer participation in a competitive electricity market.  \nThere were no environmental issues addressed in the design of the Project, and none were necessary. It is \nconsidered that any environmental issues would be indirect, resulting from expansion of the power sector. \n \nGovernance, anticorruption and fiduciary aspects were not tasks within the scope of work for the TA loan but \nthe  TA  loan  and  all  of  the  consultancy  contracts  were  subject  to  the  standard  ADB  provisions  on  these \nsubjects  and  have  been  monitored  through  the  ADB  review  missions.  There  were  no  problems  identified \nduring the course of the Project on these issues. \n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\n8. Ratings: \n\nPCR \n\nOED Review  Reason for Disagreement/Comments \n\nIneffective \n\nLess Effective  This validation considered more outputs \n\nThis validation gives more credence to the \nachievements of the TA objectives, \nparticularly the capacity building and socio-\neconomic outcomes. \n\ncould be achieved and thus more effective or \nless (partly) effective outcomes. \n \n\nRelevance: \n\nIrrelevant \n\nPartly \nRelevant \n\nEffectiveness in Achieving \nOutcome: \n\nEfficiency in Achieving \nOutcome and Outputs: \nPreliminary Assessment of \nSustainability: \nPerformance of Borrower and \nEA: \n\nInefficient \n\nInefficient \n\nLess Likely \n\nLess Likely \n\nSatisfactory \n\nSatisfactory \n\n \n\n \n\nPerformance of ADB:  Partly \n\nSatisfactory \n\nSatisfactory \n\nPCR says that \u201cthe TA Loan would have \nbeen better designed if it had been \nprocessed after an electricity law had been \napproved\u2026\u201d This is true, however the real \ndamage was the annulment of the new \nElectricity Law. Had the law been allowed to \nstand (as any experienced designer would \nhave expected) the project performance \nwould have been satisfactory. This was a \ncase of force majeure and ADB\u2019s \nperformance was therefore \u201csatisfactory\u201d. \nThe PCR does not credit the TA loan with \nany significant positive impacts, whereas this \nvalidation considers that the capacity gained \nby the Government and its auxiliaries and the \nsocioeconomic outputs of the TA will provide \ncontinuing positive impacts on the power \nsector and the social environment.  \nThis validation has considered that there are \nmore potential positive impacts from the TA \nloan than were identified in the PCR.  \nAlthough this validation has taken a number \nof different positions with respect to the \nperformance of the TA loan, nonetheless all \nof the important information on the project is \nin the PCR for the reader to form his or her \nown opinion and therefore is satisfactory. \n\nImpact:  Negligible4 \n\nModerate \n\nOverall Assessment:  Unsuccessful \n\nPartly \nSuccessful \n\nQuality of PCR:   \n\nSatisfactory \n\n \n\n                                                 \n4 The PCR does not make a specific statement on Impact but does provide the following comment, \u201cAs the TA Loan \ndid  not  achieve  its  purpose,  there  are  no  impacts  identified  in  terms  of  poverty  reduction,  the  environment,  and \nsocial  protection.  However,  the  delay  in  the  power  sector\u2019s  restructuring  may  affect  the  needed  investment  in  the \npower sector through private sector participation and public-private partnership. That, in turn, will negatively affect \nsocioeconomic development in the country.\u201d This validation has considered this to be a negligible rating for Impact. \nThis validation does not agree with this assessment. Whatever the TA Loan did not achieve is a lost impact or a do \nnothing situation, not a negative effect. \n\n \n\n\f 14 \n\n \n\n9. Comments on PCR Quality: \n \n\nSome minor comments are:  \n \nThe  PCR  and  RRP  did  not  indicate  the  design  basis  of  the  TA  loan.  The  loan  is  for  capacity  building. \nLogically,  a  capacity  building  project  should  be  designed  on  the  basis  of  the  needs  of  the  target \norganization(s)  which  in  turn  should  be  based  on  some  prior  study,  preferably  an  organizational  study, \nincluding staffing needs versus existing staff capabilities. \n\nThe PCR and RRP did not specifically identify a number of pertinent outcomes and outputs of the TA loan. \nOnly  one  objective  was  identified  in  both  reports,  whereas  this  validation  considers  that  there  were  nine \npertinent outcomes and 24 outputs in the TA loan. Had the PCR identified the outcomes and outputs in more \ndetail and assessed them individually, a higher level of assessment may have been given to of the Project for \ncapacity  building  and  possible  socioeconomic  impacts.  However,  although  not  identified  as  outcomes  and \noutputs,  all  the  outcomes  and  outputs  were  nonetheless  mentioned  in  the  reports  and  in  the  design  and \nimplementation of the Project. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  PCR  is  dated  May  2007,  2.5  years  after  Project  closing  date  of  December  2004.  No  explanation  is \nprovided for the long preparation period. Such a delay brings the quality of the report into question.  \n \nNotwithstanding  these  comments,  the  PCR  is  well  written  and  generally  complete  in  content.  Substantial \ndocumentation  and  analysis  has  been  provided  to  support  the  conclusions  and  recommendations.  The \nassessment  levels  on  performance  are  judgments  and  the  PCR  is  considered  as  being  fair  but  somewhat \nreserved in its assessment of the performance of the Project. Overall, the PCR is rated as \u201dsatisfactory\u201d. \n\n \n\n\fREGIONAL DEPARTMENT\u2019S RESPONSE TO THE PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT \nVALIDATION REPORT \n\n \n \nOn 9 September 2007, Director, OED2, Operations Evaluation Department (OED), received the \nfollowing comments from the Energy Division of Southeast Asia Department. \n \nWe note that OED\u2019s validation report rates the technical assistance (TA) loan as \u201cPartly \n1. \nSuccessful\u201d which is different from project completion report\u2019s (PCR) \u201cUnsuccessful\u201d rating. We \nunderstand  that  OED\u2019s  favorable  rating  is  mainly  based  on  the  fact  the  TA  loan  was \nsubstantially  completed  prior  to  the  annulment  of  the  Electricity  Law  that  rendered  TA  loan\u2019s \nmain  outputs  irrelevant.  Had  the  PCR  been  done  before  the  electricity  law  was  annulled,  it \nwould have rated the TA loan as \u201cPartly Successful.\u201d This is also the case for Loan 1673-INO \nfor  Power  Sector  Restructuring  Program  (PSRP)  to  which  this  TA  loan  was  piggy-backed. \nHowever, as the PCR was prepared in 2007 when it became very clear that the outputs of TA \nloan, so far as the establishment of a competitive market\u2013the main objective of the TA loan\u2013is \nconcerned, are no longer relevant. Furthermore, there is a continued delay in formulating a new \nElectricity Law. Based on these aspects, we suggested the above rating for the TA loan in the \nPCR that is lower than that given to PSRP in 2004.   \n  \n2. \nWe  take  note  of  OED\u2019s  comments  on  the  need  for  identifying  pertinent  outcomes  and \nindicating the basis of the TA loan design in the PCR. We will ensure these points are taken into \naccount in the preparation of future PCRs. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nPCR \nEA \nOED \nPLN \nPSRP \nRRP \nTA \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nproject completion report \nexecuting agency \nOperations Evaluation Department \nPerusahaan Listrik Negara (National Power Company) \nPower Sector Restructuring Program \nreport and recommendation of the President \ntechnical assistance \n", "Key Words \n \nasian development bank, capacity building, Indonesia, electricity market, performance evaluation, power, \nproject completion report, validation. \n \n \n", "NOTE \n \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars \n", " \nDirector General \nDirector \n", "Quality Control \nReviewers \n", " \nB.

Project Description as Stated in the Report and Recommendation of the President (RRP) \n  \n a. Rationale and Expected Impacts: \n \n", "As stated in the RRP, \u201cIndonesia is in the grip of an unprecedented financial, economic, and social crisis that \ncalls  for  radical  and  decisive  reforms  to  restore  domestic  and  international  investor  confidence.  Bank \nassistance during 1999 will be guided by the short-term interim strategy formulated in response to the crisis. \nThis  strategy  stresses  assisting  the  Government  in  implementing  major  economic  policy  and  institutional \nreforms, and mitigating the social distress spawned by the crisis. Bank support of the Government\u2019s initiative \nfor  structural  reforms  in  the  power  sector  is  considered  essential  given  the  urgent  need  for  reforms  to \novercome the inefficiencies resulting from overregulation and inappropriate financial policies whose adverse \nimpact  on  the  sector  was  less  apparent  during  periods  of  high  and  sustained  growth.  Without  the  reforms \nenvisaged  under  the  Power  Sector  Restructuring  Program  (PSRP),  the  electricity  supply  industry  which  is \nreeling under the impact of the crisis, cannot survive. Ensuring a stable supply of electricity is essential for the \ncountry\u2019s  economic  recovery.  The  Program  provides  a  sound  basis  for  the  Government  to  carry  out  reform \nand restructuring of the power sector. \n \n b. Objectives or Expected Outcomes: \n  \nIn  the  RRP  and  the  PCR  only  one  objective  is  stated  for  the  TA  loan:  \u201c\u2026to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the \nGovernment and the national power company, Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) to facilitate establishment of \na  competitive  electricity  market.\u201d  However,  there  were  more  objectives  and  outputs  for  the  TA  loan.
