Complementary  policy-based  and  project  components  will \naddress education quality, relevance, access, and sector management.2   \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nCountry context. The Kyrgyz Republic is one of the poorest economies in Central Asia. \nThe  country  had  a  per  capita  gross  domestic  product  of  about  $990  in  2012,  and  38%  of  the \npopulation  lived  below  the  poverty  line  in  2012. 3  The  government\u2019s  National  Sustainable \nDevelopment  Strategy,  launched  in  2013,  acknowledges  the  importance  of  education  in \nsustaining  economic  growth  and  reducing  poverty.  This  emphasis  on  education  is  reflected  in \nincreasing government resources directed to the sector. In 2012, the government\u2019s expenditure \non  education  was  6.9%  of  gross  domestic  product.  Actual  expenditure  per  student  is  low \nbecause  of  the  government\u2019s  limited  fiscal  resources.  Education  is  mandatory  up  to  grade  9. \nThe enrollment rate for primary education is 96%, and the transition rate from primary to lower \nsecondary  is  nearly  universal.  The  net  enrollment  rate  is  above  90%  in  lower  secondary \neducation (grades 5\u20139) and 52% in upper secondary education (grades 10\u201311). Many students \nenroll in secondary vocational education institutions after completing grade 9. \n \n4. \nEducation  sector  performance.  One  of  the  main  challenges  is  improving  the  quality \nand efficiency of education, particularly addressing low learning outcomes. The Kyrgyz Republic \nranked  last  among  65  countries  that  participated  in  the  Program  of  International  Student \nAchievement by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 2009, \nindicating  significant  learning  gaps  among  students.  For  example,  the  gap  in  reading  literacy \nbetween 15-year-old students in the Kyrgyz Republic and the OECD average corresponded to \n4.5 years of formal schooling.  More than half of all students in the Kyrgyz Republic performed \nbelow  basic  levels  in  literacy,  mathematics,  and  sciences  in  the  4th  and  8th  grade  national \nstudent achievement tests.4 Learning outcomes vary depending on location (rural or urban) and \nthe language of instruction.  \n \n5. \nEducation  policy  framework.  With  outdated  curricula,  a  shortage  of  textbooks,  and \nineffective teaching\u2013learning practices, the school environment contributes to poor performance \nin  the  education  sector.  Institutional  contributors  include  system  problems,  fragmented \ninadequate \nresponsibilities \n\nin  managing  education  services, \n\ninefficient  spending,  and \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.

Geneva:  UNICEF  Central  and  Eastern \nEurope/Commonwealth of Independent States. \n\n \n\n\fmanagement information systems. In response to these challenges, the Education Development \nStrategy (EDS) for 2012\u20132020 provides an overall approach to strengthen the education system \nand coordinate all government  and  development  partner  efforts. The  EDS  has  three  pillars: (i) \nimproving  equal  access  to  education  quality,  (ii)  enhancing  the  quality  and  efficiency  of \neducation  services,  and  (iii)  strengthening  sector  management  and  performance.  The \ngovernment  has  implemented  a  number  of  reforms  in  the  education  sector  since  2009, \nincluding:  (i)  development  of  the  National  Framework  Curriculum  for  general  education  based \non competencies and skills; (ii) approval of subject curricula for grades 1-4; (iii) introduction of \nthe concept of elective education in grades 10-11 to ensure linkages between general education \nand the labor market; (iv) introduction of per capita financing in schools to help ensure a more \nequitable  allocation  of  resources;  (v)  significant  increases  in  teacher  salaries  in  2011;  and  (vi) \nestablishing  school  Boards  of  Trustees  to  participate  in  school  management.  The  MES \ntranslated the EDS for 2012-2020 into specific activities and targets in 3-year action plans, and \nis currently preparing an action plan for 2015-2017. \n \n6. \nCompetency-based  curriculum.  As  a  response  to  low  learning  outcomes  and  weak \nskills  competencies  the  government  has  introduced  comprehensive  reforms,  including  new \ncompetency-based curricula for grades 1\u20134.5 Curricula for grades 5\u20139 are being developed with \nassistance  from  the  World  Bank.6 Policy  and  investment  support  is  essential  to  complete  the \nrevision of the curriculum and learning and teaching materials (LTMs) for grades 10\u201311, and to \nintroduce general and elective tracks in these grades to improve links with the labor market. An \nevaluation of the new curriculum for primary education is needed to assist in the reform of the \nsecondary  education  curriculum.  To  facilitate  this  process,  a  curriculum  review  unit  should  be \nestablished to monitor, periodically assess, and continually improve the curriculum.  \n \n7. \nTextbook  provision.  Textbook  shortages,  distribution  and  availability  problems,  and \noutdated  content  have  had  a  major  impact  on  learning  outcomes.  The  government\u2019s  annual \nbudget of Som100 million is only 40% of the amount required to renew the textbook stocks each \nyear for all grades. In SY2011/12, the Ministry of Education and Science (MES) estimated that \nonly  43%  of  students  had  access  to  textbooks.  The  provision  of  textbooks  differs  significantly \nbetween regions, and many schools continue to use old stocks of obsolete textbooks. Strategies \nto  reduce  the  cost  and  improve  the  quality  of  textbooks  are  needed  to  achieve  financially \nsustainable  textbook  provision  that  can  support  the  new  curriculum.  The  EDS  2012\u20132020 \nproposes a textbook rental scheme (TRS) to create full and sustainable textbook supplies for all \nstudents,  with  the  government  subsidizing  the  poorest  and  most  vulnerable  students  (15%  of \nstudents  will  qualify  for  free  rentals).  The  MES  needs  to  improve  the  quality  and  durability  of \ntextbooks  and  LTMs,  which  have  tended to be  overly  theoretical,  reflecting  the  deficiencies of \nthe  curriculum.  The  current  quality  assurance  processes  need  upgrading  to  ensure  that  high-\nquality textbooks supportive of curriculum objectives will be used. \n \nTeacher  quality.  To  address  declining  education  quality,  the  government  adopted \n8. \nteacher  salary  reforms  in  2011,  which  almost  doubled  teacher  wages  and  largely  alleviated \nteacher  shortages.  However,  teacher  levels  were  eliminated  in  2012,  resulting  in  a  lack  of \ncareer  progression.  Reforms  are  necessary  to  develop,  assess,  and  reward  teachers.  In  the \nEDS 2012\u20132020, the policy priorities include (i) reintroducing teacher certification based on new \nstandards,  (ii)  modernizing \nteacher  performance  appraisal  and  continual  professional \ndevelopment, and (iii) enhancing incentives for teachers. Improved chances for promotion and \nother  financial  incentives  will  help  attract  teachers  to  remote  and  rural  areas,  where  teacher \n\n                                                \n5   The Kyrgyz Republic school year starts in September and ends in May. \n6   World Bank. 2013. Sector Support for Education Reform Project. Washington, DC. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fshortages  have  remained.  The  requirements  of  the  new  curriculum  have  created  pressure  on \nteachers to improve their subject pedagogical competencies; however, the quality of in-service \nteacher  training  (INSETT)  does  not  meet  modern  requirements.  While  every  school  teacher \nshould  undergo  INSETT  every  5  years,  only  10%\u201320%  get  the  opportunity  for  professional \ndevelopment. INSETT quality and accessibility needs to be improved. \n \n9. \nEducation  planning  and  delivery.  The  education  budget  needs  to  be  reviewed  to \nenhance  efficiency.  About  20%  of  the  annual  public  expenditure  is  allocated  to  education. \nHowever,  more  than  70%  of  the  education  budget  is  required  for  salaries,  leaving  limited \nfinancial  resources  for  quality  improvements. 7 In  addition,  the  planning  and  management \ncapacity  of  school  principals  is  still  generally  weak.  Better  capacity  building  programs  are \nneeded  for  school  principals,  deputy  principals,  and  district  methodology  specialists.  To \nincrease  access  to  quality  education,  the  government  launched  a  national  program  in  2013  to \nestablish  100  innovative  schools.  These  schools  will  (i)  serve  as  cluster  schools  to  enhance \nresource- and capacity-sharing among neighboring schools; (ii) provide well-resourced learning \nsites  for  science,  technology,  and  math;  and  (iii)  serve  as  platforms  for  modern  teaching  and \nlearning.  The  innovative  schools  need  regulations  and  mechanisms  for  effective  operations, \nmodern  multimedia  equipment  and  science \nteacher  methodological \ncompetencies. The functioning of all school boards of trustees needs to be improved to promote \ntheir  involvement  in  resource  allocation  and  school  management.  Capital  investment  and  the \noperational  budget for  primary  and secondary  education  have been  inadequate.  Underfunding \nof  operation  and  maintenance  costs  has  led  to  the  degradation  of  school  buildings  and  other \ninfrastructure.  A  study  by  UNICEF  found  that  64%  of  schools  need  major  repairs. 8  Thirty \nselected  innovative  schools  in  remote  and  rural  areas  need  to  be  rehabilitated  to  improve \nlearning environments. Teachers and principals in the selected innovative schools need support \nto  use  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  for  new  approaches  to  teaching  and \nlearning, including multimedia classrooms and pilots for math and science software.  \n \nSector  development  program  approach  and  previous  ADB  support.  The  Asian \n10. \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) began providing assistance to the sector in 1997 with the Education \nSector Development Program (ESDP).9 The ESDP helped to rationalize the education system, \nimproved efficiency and management capabilities, and upgraded education content. Under the \nSecond  Education  Project,  ADB  supported  initiatives  in  INSETT,  developing  curriculum  and \nstate  education  standards,  enhancing  education  management  and  planning,  and  rehabilitating \nselected schools to improve learning environments.10 ADB support to the education sector also \nincluded  the  Improving  Access  to  Quality  Basic  Education  for  Children  with  Special  Needs \nProject, supported by a grant from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction,11 and two projects to \nsupport  vocational  and  technical  education  and  training.12 The  proposed  sector  development \n\nlabs,  and  better \n\n                                                \n7   Sector Assessment (Summary): Education (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8   UNICEF.  2013.

This  modality \nprovides policy-based program support and an incremental approach to help finance the cost of \na  new  wave  of  reforms  in  education.  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic, which is closely aligned with national priorities, aims to improve the quality of school \neducation,  reform \nlearning \nenvironments  in  schools. 13  The  program  is  included  in  the  2014  pipeline  of  the  country \noperations business plan, 2014\u20132016.14 \n \nB. \n\nthe  curriculum  and  LTMs,  and \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nINSETT,  develop \n\nimprove \n\n11. \nThe  impact  will  be  improved  human  resources  development  for  competitiveness  of  the \nKyrgyz  Republic.

It incorporates the following lessons from the completion reports for \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fthe  ESDP17 and  Second  Education  Project: 18 (i)  ensure  continuity  of  support  for  curriculum \ndevelopment;  (ii)  improve  textbook  provision;  (iii)  carry  out  reforms  in  INSETT;  (iv)  improve \nschool  facilities  to  enhance  learning  environments;  (v)  establish  a  dedicated  unit  to  monitor, \nperiodically assess, and continually improve the curriculum; and (vi) use the sector development \nprogram  modality  to  promote  the  sustainability  of  reforms.  Technical  due  diligence  analysis \nfound no discernable risk in having minor civil works in schools. The program will provide policy \nrecommendations to support the sustainable operation and maintenance of school facilities. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n21. \nEconomic  and  financial  analyses  were  prepared.  The  economic  benefits  from  the \nprogram  include  improved  quality  of  education  resulting  in  a  higher  wage  premium  for \nsecondary school completers (relative to non-completers) and decreased wastage of public and \nprivate resources as a result of reduced dropouts and repetitions. Estimating these benefits over \n20  years  yields  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  23.8%,  as  shown  in  the  economic \nanalysis.19 A  financial  sustainability  analysis  was  undertaken  during  program  preparation  based \non the fiscal impact of measures necessary to achieve high-quality education, including textbook \nprovision, enhanced teacher training, and school maintenance.20 Excluding the effect of the TRS, \nresulting recurrent costs increase as a percentage of the total MES budget initially, peaking at \n2.1% of the education budget in 2021 and falling to 1.2% in 2030. If the TRS is implemented as \nplanned,  recurrent  costs  increase  to  1.3%  in  2021  and fall  to  0.6%  in  2030  because  the  TRS \nrevenues are expected to reduce the government contribution to textbook funding to 15% of the \ntotal cost.  Therefore, incremental cost burdens are sustainable, assuming (i) continued support \nfrom  development  partners  in  the  period  to  2020,  (ii)  the  economy  grows  as  the  International \nMonetary  Fund  predicts,  and  (iii)  the  government  budget  plans  and  fiscal  reforms  are \nimplemented.  Prospects  for  sustainability  are  significantly  improved  if  the  MES  cost  burden  is \nlightened by a carefully designed TRS and other cost-reduction measures that the program will \nhelp to identify and implement.  \n\n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n\n22. \nFinancial management and procurement capacity assessments have been carried out in \naccordance  with  ADB  requirements.  The  overall  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is \nassessed  as  high.  Weaknesses  include  staffing  capacity,  financial  planning  and  budgeting, \ninternal  audit,  procurement,  and  knowledge  of  ADB  requirements.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s \ndevelopment  partners  are  supporting  strengthening  the  budgeting,  financial  management,  and \nbasic fiduciary arrangements within the MES, including internal audit.21 The MES also adopted \nan  anticorruption  action  plan  in  2014.  Assessment  findings  have  been  incorporated  into  the \nprogram  design  as  appropriate,  and  the  MES  is  addressing  others  with  development  partner \nsupport.  The  Ministry  of  Finance,  with  ADB  support,  is  establishing  a  centralized  electronic \nprocurement platform to help limit corruption.22 Under the proposed program, the MES will pilot \nelectronic  tendering  of  textbooks  to  improve  procurement  transparency  and  efficiency.  The \nprogram  includes  strengthening  PIU  staff  and  training  MES  and  PIU  staff  in  ADB  procedures, \nincluding  procurement,  disbursement,  and  accounting  systems.

A single integrated grievance redress mechanism with multiple access points and \nmultiple tracks will be set up and managed by the joint PIU.  \n\nD. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\n23. \nImproving  education  attainment  and  quality  plays  a  key  role  in  reducing  poverty  and \nimproving  living  standards  in the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  The  30  innovative  schools  to  be  supported \nwill be selected based on poverty and other social needs criteria in each location.23 The TRS will \nprovide  free  textbook  rentals  to  the  15%  of  students  who  are  the  most  poor  and  vulnerable. \nUnder the program, textbook production and provision will be demographically balanced and will \nreflect government policies on languages of instruction.  \n \n24.  The program is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming and a gender action plan \nhas been prepared. Gender analysis of students shows gender parity in school enrollment. The \naverage number of years of schooling among females 15\u201319 years old (10.05) is slightly higher \nthan  for  males  (9.89).24 The  Program  of  International  Student  Achievement  2009  results  also \nshowed girls slightly outperforming boys in reading, math, and science. The achievement gaps \nfor  boys  could  curtail  their  access  to  tertiary  education,  if  left  unattended.  About  80%  of  the \nteachers in secondary education are women, and most school principals are also women. The \ngender  action  plan  includes  the  following  targets  and  gender-responsive  design  features:  (i) \nremoval  of  gender  bias  in  the  curriculum,  textbooks,  and  LTMs,  and  promotion  of  positive \nimages of women in higher-status occupations; (ii) increasing the number of male teachers; (iii) \nmore  appropriately  trained  female  administrators;  and  (iv)  gender  monitoring  and  evaluation \nindicators integrated in the overall design and monitoring framework to track the implementation \nof the gender action plan.  \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nIn accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program is classified \n25. \nas category C for environmental impact. Output 3 under the project grant will include minor civil \nworks, such as rehabilitation of the 30 innovative schools. Civil works activities with more than \nminimal environmental impacts, such as clearance of large areas of vegetation, will be excluded \nfrom financing. Overall, the limited impacts from rehabilitation works will be localized and short \nterm,  and  can  be  effectively  mitigated  through  good  civil  works  practices.  An  environmental \nscreening  and  management  checklist  has  been  prepared  and  is  included  in  the  PAM.  The \ninvoluntary  resettlement  category  is  C.  Project  activities  will  not  require  land  acquisition  or \nresettlement. The indigenous peoples category is C. No program activities will adversely affect \nethnic  minorities.  Higher-quality  education  as  a  result  of  the  program  will  benefit  all  students, \nincluding ethnic minorities. At least three of the 30 innovative schools to be supported by ADB \nare expected to have classes with an ethnic minority language of instruction. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n26. \nDuring  program  design,  governance  and  implementation  risks  were  assessed  and \nmitigating measures incorporated. These are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk \nmanagement plan.25 Since the MES budgets are not clearly linked to policy goals, performance \nindicators,  or  nonfinancial  outcomes,  performance  is  difficult  to  gauge.  However,  with \ndevelopment  partner  support,  the  government  is  working  to  improve  budgeting  and  financial \n                                                \n23  Summary of Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fmanagement. The  risks that  are  considered  high  are  (i)  the  effects  on  the education  sector of \ngovernment fiscal policies to reduce budget deficits, which will be mitigated through assurances \nfrom the government on maintaining existing levels of education expenditure and measures to \nimprove  the  efficiency  of  education  spending;  (ii)  poor  functioning  of  the  procurement  market, \nwhich  will  be  mitigated  through  the  design  of  the  procurement  plan  and  activities  within  the \nprogram to pilot test electronic procurement of textbooks; (iii) unstable political, economic, and \nsocial conditions\u2014a risk largely outside ADB control, but the program\u2019s goal of creating quality \neducation  services  will  help  mitigate  the  risk;  (iv)  a  slower  pace  for  policy  reforms,  especially \nduring  the  pre-election period,  which  will  be  mitigated through  the  disbursement  conditions for \nthe  policy-based  grant  and  through  a  continuing  process  of  policy  dialogue;  (v)  a  lack  of \nadequate  management  information  systems  in  the  MES,  raising  concerns  about  sector \nperformance  management,  which  will  be  mitigated  through  a  United  Nations  Educational, \nScientific  and  Cultural  Organization  initiative  and  the  proposed  program\u2019s  project  performance \nmonitoring system; and (vi) adverse public perception of paying rental fees for textbooks under \nthe TRS, which will be mitigated by an advocacy and communications strategy to help highlight \nthe  TRS  benefits  to  the  public  and  measures  to ensure  the  poorest  will  continue  to  have free \ntextbooks.  The  overall  risk  level  to  the  successful  implementation  of  the  program,  taking  into \naccount  these  mitigation  measures,  is  assessed  as  medium,  with  integrated  benefits \noutweighing risk-associated costs.     \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n27. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the  PAM \nand  grant  documents.
