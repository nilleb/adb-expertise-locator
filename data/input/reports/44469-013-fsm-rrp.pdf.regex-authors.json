I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto Yap State, to be guaranteed by the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), for the Yap \nRenewable Energy Development Project.1 \n \n2.  The  project  will  reduce fossil fuel  consumption  in  Yap  through  the development of \nrenewable energy and stronger supply-side energy efficiency of the current electricity grid. The \nproject will include (i) construction of about 1.4 megawatts (MW) of wind power, (ii) construction \nof about 300 kilowatts (kW) of grid-connected solar power, (iii) installation of a 1.8 MW diesel \ngenerator to improve the efficiency of the current power generation facilities, and (iv) capacity \nbuilding within the Yap power utility and communities.2   \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The project will support the development of the power system in Yap so as to reduce \ndependency on imported diesel. This will be achieved through expanding renewable power \ngeneration and improving the supply-side efficiencies of power delivery. \n \n4.  Yap, with a population of 11,400, is one of four states within the FSM with a total \npopulation  of  107,000.  Currently,  Yap  is  100%  dependent  on  imported  diesel  for  power \ngeneration on the main island (referred to as Yap proper). Power generation is supplied by Yap \nState Public Services Corporation (YSPSC), which is a 100% state-owned corporatized utility. \nEach state in the FSM has a separate utility corporation with separate tariff structures. About \n65% of the population of Yap lives on Yap proper, the others live on the outer islands. There is a \nsingle power grid on Yap proper with an installed capacity of 8.3 MW and peak load 2.4 MW, \nserving about 1,500 residential customers. Access to electricity at an estimated 97% is high on \nYap proper.3  \n \n5.  Due to remoteness and high diesel transportation costs, power tariffs are high and the \nYap economy is very vulnerable to fuel price shocks. In 2011, the electricity tariff reached $0.35 \nper kilowatt-hour (kWh) for residential customers, $0.42/kWh for commercial customers, and \n$0.77/kWh for public institutions. The late 2011 total cost of energy generated and delivered \nwas $0.54/kWh.4 In 2008, the value of diesel fuel imported by Yap was the highest single import \ncost  item  with  over  80%  of  imported  diesel  fuel  used  for  power  generation.  Fuel  imports \nrepresented about 15% of Yap\u2019s gross domestic product in 2008. Power tariffs currently allow \nfor full cost recovery for YSPSC to undertake required operation and maintenance activities and \nservice  long-term  debt.  YSPSC  has  a  project  in  the  water  sector  financed  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), and has been maintaining the repayments to the state government \nsatisfactorily.5 \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance supported the preparation of the project. ADB. 2009. \nTechnical Assistance for Strengthening the Capacity of Pacific Developing Member Countries to Respond to \nClimate Change. Manila. (TA 7394-REG).  \n3  As a result, there is very limited private installed backup generation and limited unmet demand on Yap proper.  \n4  The tariff structure includes a lifeline tariff to support low-income households.  \n5  ADB. 1996. Water Supply and Sanitation Project (L1459-FSM). Manila. ADB has also supported the Yap State \nthrough ADB. 2004. Omnibus Infrastructure Development Project. Manila (L2099-FSM (SF) and L2100-FSM; \nimplementing agency: Gagil-Tomil Water Authority).    ", "2 \n6.  The power supply in Yap is relatively stable and YSPSC pursues a well-defined program \nof preventive maintenance, which ensures reliable power supply to a relatively compact power \nsystem.6 As a result there are relatively high efficiencies on the supply side for transmission and \ndistribution. But the diesel generators are oversized, resulting in low supply-side efficiencies for \ngeneration.7 Due to a predominance of traditional buildings, residential electricity consumption is \nlow at about 180 kWh/month per residential meter, and relatively efficient; however, power \nusage by government offices is rather high.8 Due to low terrain and small catchments, Yap does \nnot have potential for hydropower. There is currently no wind power generation in Yap, but there \nare several solar power mini-grids in the outer islands that YSPSC manages. Wind and solar \npower are the only forms of renewable energy currently considered suitable for Yap. As a result \nof its operation of the outer-island solar installations, YSPSC has experience in installation and \noperation of grid-connected solar power. \n \n7.  The project is proposing to support the (i) development of grid-connected wind power \ngeneration of about 1.4 MW, (ii) development of grid-connected solar power of about 300 kW, \n(iii) improvement of generation efficiencies in existing diesel generation through a new, more \nefficient  1.8  MW  diesel  generator,  and  (iv)  provision  of  project  management  support  and \ncapacity building for YSPSC. It is estimated that the project will enable Yap to convert 22.2% of \nits power generation to renewable energy. Additional fuel savings through stronger supply-side \nenergy efficiency will lower diesel consumption for power generation by 25%.9 Conversion to \nrenewable energy will stabilize power tariffs by reducing the transient impact of fluctuating diesel \nprices, and enable YSPSC to control tariff increases through partial hedging against rising \ndiesel  prices.  Grid  analysis  has  indicated  that  grid  integration  of  this  level  of  intermittent \nrenewable energy will not cause grid instability. \n \n8.   The project is in line with ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2012\u2013201410 for the \nFSM, which prioritizes energy as a key area of support, and with the FSM\u2019s draft National \nEnergy Policy,11 which includes the draft Yap State Energy Action Plan. The draft National \nEnergy Policy sets a national renewable energy generation target of 30% by 2020. All project \noutputs are listed in the Yap State Energy Action Plan as priority activities. The project will \nenable the State of Yap to meet about 74% of its contribution to the national energy target.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the project will be that Yap's energy security has improved. The outcome \nof the project will be that YSPSC supplies more clean, renewable energy to Yap.  \n \n                                                \n6 The distribution system consists of 124 kilometers of 13.8-kilovolt overhead lines. There is no high-voltage \ntransmission line.  \n7  Current generator configuration is 2 x 3.3 MW Deutz, 2 x 0.5 MW White Superiors, and 1 x 0.7 MW Alco diesel \ngenerators. Power is primarily supplied by the Deutz engines. The White Superiors and the Alco are suitable for \nbackup but not for baseload generation. Peak demand of 2.4 MW and night load of around 1.5 MW mean that the \nDeutz engines are generally operated at low loading and low efficiencies. Generation was installed to support \nindustrial demand, which has subsequently declined.   \n8  Demand-side energy audits are being finalized for government buildings, and the European Union is proposing to \nsupport implementation of the audit reports.  \n9  Due to current high levels of access to electricity (an estimated 97%), the project will not increase energy access \non Yap proper. Access rates on the outer islands are lower. However, the European Union is assisting Yap in \ninstalling solar-based mini-grids throughout the outer islands.  \n10 ADB. 2011. Country Operations Business Plan: Federated States of Micronesia, 2012\u20132014. Manila. \n11 Approval of the Draft National Energy Policy is anticipated by June 2013. ", "3 \n \nC.  Outputs \n10.  The project will have the following outputs: \n \n11.  Wind power. YSPSC installs generation of about 1.4 MW to be constructed in two \nphases (about 0.5 MW in phase 1 and about 0.9 MW in phase 2). The wind farm will be built on \na ridgeline adjacent to the main urban center (Colonia) on Yap proper. The wind farm will \ninclude (i) wind turbines with anticipated height of about 60 meters high, and capacity of 100\u2013\n300 kW each,  designed  to  withstand  typhoon  conditions; (ii) underground  power  lines  and \nelectrical systems; (iii) about 800 meters of above-ground distribution connection, including \ntransformer, to the local grid; (iv) 2 kilometers (km) of access road, and (v) a communication \nsystem. Both stages of the wind farm will be tendered through a single design\u2013build\u2013operate\u2013\ntransfer  contract. The  wind farm  is  anticipated  to  generate  2.12 gigawatt-hours  (GWh) per \nannum, equal to 18.2% of the current energy delivery in Yap.12 \n \n12.  Solar power. YSPSC installs generation of about 300 kW through grid-connected solar \npanels on government building roofs on about 21 buildings at four sites across Yap. It will own \nand operate the installations. This output will include installation of solar panels, inverters, and \nrelated electrical equipment to connect to the grid. Training will be provided to local companies \nfor construction of the solar installations and to establish local maintenance capacity. Solar \npower is expected to provide 0.46 GWh/annum to the grid, equal to 4.0% of current energy \ndelivery in Yap. \n \n13.  Diesel power. YSPSC improves the efficiency of diesel power generation by installing a \nnew  high-efficiency,  medium-speed  diesel  engine  of  1.8  MW  capacity,  providing \n9.9 GWh/annum. During off-peak hours of operation, the generator will run at significantly higher \nfuel efficiency of 15.0kWh/gallon, than the existing diesel generators which operate at 13.8 \nkWh/gallon. \n \n14.  Efficient  project  management  services.  This  means  establishing  a  project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  that  will  provide  efficient  technical  design,  management,  and \nconstruction supervision services. The output will finance consultants to undertake training \nactivities for PMU staff and YSPSC management, including technical capacity training, project \nmanagement training, and gender awareness training.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n15.  The project is estimated to cost $11.16 million, as shown in Table 1. \n \n                                                \n12 The maximum combined phase 1 wind and solar grid integration is anticipated to peak at 40%. The grid will be \nanalyzed during phase 1 to determine system constraints for the development of phase 2 wind generation.  \n ", "4 \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \nItem    Amounta \nA.

The national and state governments have requested a sovereign-guaranteed loan of \n$4,680,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR). The OCR loan will have a 25-year \nterm, including a grace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of \n0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions as are set forth in the draft guarantee and \nloan agreements. The national and state governments have requested that repayment will \nfollow the custom-tailored repayment option, and that the repayment dates will be 1 June and 1 \nDecember. Based on the above loan terms and these repayment option and dates, the average \nloan maturity is 16.67 years, which means that the loan will be subject to a 0.20% maturity \npremium. Under the custom-tailored repayment method each installment is calculated as a \npercentage of the total loan amount as follows: 1% from the 1st to the 6th principal repayment \ndate; 2% from the 7th to the 14th principal repayment date; and 3% from the 15th to the 40th \nprincipal repayment date. \n \n17.  The national and state governments have also requested a sovereign-guaranteed loan \nin various currencies equivalent to SDR2,896,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds (ADF) resources \nto help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 \nyears, an interest rate of 2.0% per annum, and such other terms and conditions as are set forth \nin the draft guarantee and loan agreements.13  \n \n18.  The Government of the FSM will provide a sovereign guarantee for the OCR loan and \nthe ADF loan, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, as a condition precedent to the \neffectiveness of the OCR loan and ADF loan. The  Yap State Government will onlend the \nproceeds of the OCR loan and the ADF loan to YSPSC under subsidiary loan agreements \nacceptable to ADB. The terms for onlending the proceeds of the OCR loan and ADF loan will \ninclude the same respective interest rates and repayment periods as those of the OCR loan and \nADF loan.  \n \n                                                \n13 Financing charges during implementation under the ADF loan will be capitalized.

The financing plan is in Table 2.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)    Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank       \n  Special Funds resources (loan)  4.36    39.1 \n  Ordinary capital resources (loan)  4.68    41.9 \nYap State Government  2.12    19.0 \n  Total    11.16    100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  YSPSC will be the executing agency for the project. A PMU will be established within \nYSPSC and will be responsible for implementing the project. YSPSC will provide a PMU project \nmanager (senior technical manager), accounting support, and a lands officer. The project will \nfinance additional staff, equipment, and office furnishings to support the PMU in implementing \nthe  outputs.  The  additional  staffing  will  consist  of  an  electrical  engineer  (solar),  electrical \nengineer (wind), environment specialist, social specialist (to oversee implementation of the \ngender action and resettlement plans), structural engineer, procurement specialist and wind \nmonitoring  specialist.  Consulting  firms  will  be  engaged  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection method with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10, which is considered justified due to the \ntechnical complexity of the wind and solar components. Consultants may also be recruited \nthrough individual consultant selection, which is considered justified due to the difficulties in \nfinding  consulting  companies  that  have  on  staff  the  broad  technical  spread  of  required \nspecialists, and owing to the limited pool of consultants with the required technical and country \nexpertise. ADB financing for PMU strengthening is an integral part of ADB\u2019s support for capacity \ndevelopment output. All consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The PMU will be responsible for \nengaging  all  consulting  services,  equipment,  and  civil  works  contracts.  A  project  steering \ncommittee  will  oversee  implementation,  monitor  progress,  and  provide  guidance  to  the \nexecuting  agency.  The  committee  will  meet  at  least  quarterly  and  will  be  chaired  by  the \nlieutenant governor of Yap. YSPSC will host the project steering committee and will act as the \nsecretariat. \n \n21.  The project will be implemented over 4.5 years, with completion estimated by June \n2017. To expedite implementation, the Yap State Government has requested and ADB has \napproved  advance  procurement  action  for  the  engagement  of  design  and  supervision \nconsultants.  ADB  has  informed  the  Yap  State  Government  that  approval  of  advance \nprocurement  action  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the  project.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n22.  The proposed wind, solar, and diesel generator components have been assessed to be \ntechnically  viable.  For  the  wind  farm  design,  wind  resource  modeling  was  carried  out  to \ndetermine the most suitable site, and site-specific wind measurements helped assess financial \nviability  based  on  a  conservative  90%  exceedance  probability  scenario.15  Data  will  be \nreconfirmed through a site-specific wind monitoring mast that will be installed for monitoring \nover a full year. For the solar installations, available panel technology was reviewed before \nselection. Specifications tailored to the Pacific were prepared to improve system sustainability. \nFor the diesel generator component, the design was based on extensive experience in Yap in \noperation and maintenance of diesel generators. Alternative designs were assessed to ensure \nleast-cost design. The proposed solar and wind technology is installed across the Pacific and \nhas a proven track record of reliability in Pacific conditions. Standard equipment of known \ndesign was selected to increase the availability of parts. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n23.  Economic. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the consolidated project is \n12.9%, with an economic net present value (ENPV) of $0.57 million. At the 90% wind speed \nexceedance level, the two-stage wind project produces 2.1 GWh/year. At that output, the EIRR \nis 11.5%, and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) is $0.39/kWh. If only the first stage is \n                                                \n15 This is the probability that the wind resource used in the design will be achieved 90% of the time.  ", "7 \n \nconsidered, at the 90% exceedance level the EIRR is 8.9% and the LCOE is $0.44/kWh.16 The \n300 kW grid-connected solar component, producing 0.44 GWh of energy annually, has an EIRR \nof 11.4% and LCOE of $0.40/kWh. The 1.8 MW diesel generator will produce 9.9 GWh of \nenergy  annually  and  will  have  an  EIRR  of  15.6%,  ENPV  of  $0.79  million,  and  LCOE  of \n$0.40/kWh, including initial cost and fuel and maintenance costs calculated over its 25-year life \ncycle.  \n \n24.  Financial. The financial economic internal rate of return (FIRR) of the consolidated \nproject (all three energy components combined, under the 2-stage wind case) is 13.0%, with a \nfinancial net present value (FNPV) of $15.8 million. This compares favorably to the weighted \naverage cost of capital of 1.86%. The full two-stage wind energy component has an FIRR of \n11.4% and a FNPV of $7.3 million.17 The financial LCOE from the two-stage wind project, \ncalculated over its 25-year life cycle, is $0.22/kWh. If only the first stage is considered, the wind \nfarm has an FIRR of 8.7% and an FNPV of $2.3 million. The financial LCOE from the single-\nstage wind project is $0.26/kWh. The grid-connected solar component has an FIRR of 11.6% \nand an NPV of $2.0 million. The LCOE from the solar installation, calculated over its 25-year life \ncycle, is $0.20/kWh. The diesel generation component has an FIRR of 15.9% and an NPV of \n$6.7 million. The LCOE, including initial cost and fuel and maintenance costs calculated over its \n25-year life cycle, is $0.42/kWh. \n \nC.  Governance \n25.  Financial  management.  A  financial  management  assessment  was  completed  for \nYSPSC,  including  a  review  of  the  accounting  and  reporting  system,  internal  and  external \nauditing, fund disbursement, and information system.18 The assessment indicated that existing \naccounting  policies  and  procedures  are  adequate  to  accommodate  the  management \nrequirements of the project and that there are no significant weaknesses in YSPSC\u2019s accounting \npolicies, information systems, or accounting and reporting procedures. The YSPSC has well-\ndeveloped capacity in financial management, and its qualified personnel includes an accounting \nmanager, a comptroller\u2019s consultant (the position of comptroller is currently vacant), a payroll \naccountant, a purchasing and supply accountant, and a customer service manager, supported \nby clerks and other subordinate personnel. The accounting manager carries out internal audits \non an ongoing basis, with reporting to the board of directors, as the utility is too small to warrant \nthe creation of a separate internal auditing section. YSPSC utilizes the commercial software \npackage Peachtree for all accounting functions and financial reporting. A policies and procedure \nmanual  guides  accounting  and  other  management  functions.  Staff  qualifications  and  job \ndescriptions  are  contained  in  a  personnel  manual.  The  financial  management  assessment \nindicated  that  YSPSC  has  adequate  capacity  to  manage  loan  repayments  and  maintain \nseparate project accounts suitable for auditing purposes. \n \n26.  Procurement  capacity.  A  procurement  capacity  assessment  was  completed  for \nYSPSC, which indicated that YSPSC has an established procurement unit with considerable \nprocurement experience. However, the experience is largely related to procurement of small \nequipment packages, and YSPSC has limited experience in managing large contract packages \nduring either tender preparation or construction supervision. Additionally, while the capacity of \nindividual  staff  is  relatively  high,  there  is  limited  depth  of  capacity.  There  is  also  limited \n                                                \n16 The relatively low EIRR is considered justified due to the unquantified economic benefits related to reduced \nmaintenance costs and environmental benefits.   \n17  Based on a 90% exceedance level. \n18 ADB. 2005.

Based on this risk evaluation the PMU \nwas designed to include an international procurement specialist who will train YSPSC staff in \npreparing tender documents for the design\u2013build\u2013operate\u2013transfer contract for the wind farm, \nand manage preparation of ADB standard tender documents. \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the national and state governments and YSPSC. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual.19 \n \n28.  Private sector. Because of the small size of the Yap power system and the marginal \nfinancial viability of the subprojects under commercial lending conditions, the state government \ndoes  not  currently  consider  development  of  generation  assets  through  independent  power \nproducers. Due to the highly technical nature of wind power generation, the private sector will \nbe involved in long-term maintenance contracts for the wind farm. A long-term maintenance \ncontract will also be established for the new diesel generator, as is current practice for the \nexisting diesel generators. Capacity building activities will also be undertaken for local private \nsector companies to support construction of the solar power generation. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n29.  The project will help reduce poverty by (i) stabilizing power tariffs for commercial and \ndomestic power consumers in Yap proper, including low-income households; (ii) engaging low-\nincome households, including landowners, to undertake construction projects; (iii) encouraging \nprivate sector growth through stabilized power tariffs; (iv) providing technical training for local \ncontractors to develop a support industry for the solar installations; and (v) facilitating income \ngeneration opportunities through wind farm designs that ensure tourism access to World War II \nheritage sites and viewing points.  \n \n30.  The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. A gender action plan has \nbeen developed based on gender analysis and community consultations, and includes specific \nmeasures related to the construction of the wind farm and solar installations. Measures include \n(i) women\u2019s engagement in consultation activities, (ii) provision of gender awareness training to \ntarget groups, (iii) training of women to participate in income generating activities (including \ntourism activities related to the wind farm site), (iv) actions to encourage women\u2019s participation \nin project related contracts, and (v) collection of gender-related data for monitoring purposes. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n31.  Environment. The project has been classified as category B for environment following \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. An initial environmental examination has been prepared for \nthe project. The main potential environmental impacts identified include (i) noise from the wind \nturbines, (ii) impacts on flora and fauna during construction of the wind farm, and (iii) soil \nerosion during construction of the wind farm. A heritage survey was conducted at the proposed \nwind farm site, and sites to be avoided during construction were specified. Adequate mitigation \nmeasures were incorporated into the environmental management plan as part of the initial \nenvironmental examination. The plan will be included in the wind farm construction contract.

The project has been classified as \ncategory B for involuntary resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples following ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. The project does not involve physical displacement of people or \nstructures. There will be no impact on distinct and vulnerable indigenous peoples. The wind \nfarm to be built on Kabul and Madeqdeq ridges, however, requires acquisition of 7.5 hectares of \nland. A resettlement plan has been prepared. YSPSC will update and finalize the plan during \nproject implementation after detailed design and survey of the wind farm. YSPSC will coordinate \nwith the state government, the Division of Land Resources, and other relevant government and \nnongovernment agencies to implement and monitor the land acquisition and compensation \nactivities. \n \n33.  Safeguard documents have been endorsed by the Yap State Government, disclosed to \naffected persons and local stakeholders, and posted on ADB's website. The project will support \ncapacity  within  YSPSC  to  manage  safeguard  aspects  through  international  and  national \nenvironment, and social safeguard specialists who will be working within the PMU. They will \norganize and conduct trainings on safeguards and other necessary skills to the relevant staff of \nYSPSC, the Division of Land Resources, and other agencies that will be involved in the project\u2019s \nsafeguard activities. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.21 The  risks  of  the  project  have  been \nassessed and the benefits are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLow capacity of local contractors results in  Local contractors will be trained on the construction of solar \nreliance on high-cost external contractors.   installations.
