It  will  be  driven  by  the  demand\nand needs of LGUs that now lack urban infrastructure and municipal\nservices  needed  for  urban  development.  LGUs  that  meet  the\nselection  criteria  will  be  eligible  for  subproject  financing  from  LBP.\nThe  Project  also  aims  to  improve  the  institutional  capacity  of\nparticipating LGUs to provide, operate, and maintain essential urban\ninfrastructure services.\n\nClassification\n\nEnvironmental\nAssessment\n\nRationale\n\nPoverty intervention\nThematic:\n\nHuman development\n\nCategory B\nInitial \nenvironmental \nrepresentative core subprojects.\n\nexaminations  were \n\nundertaken \n\nfor\n\nThe  high  rate  of  urban  growth  in  the  Philippines  combined  with\ninadequate  local  investments  has  led  to  serious  deficiencies  in  the\nprovision  of  basic  urban  infrastructure  and  municipal  services,\nparticularly in Mindanao. Despite its abundant natural resources and\nfertile  soil,  Mindanao  is  among  the  poorest  regions  in  the  country.\nThe  incidence  of  urban  poverty  is  nearly  twice  the  national  urban\naverage,  and  the  provision  of  municipal  services  is  well  below  the\nnational average. The institutional capacity of LGUs in Mindanao to\nundertake  their  devolved  functions  and  deliver  adequate  municipal\nservices  varies  widely.  Because  of  prolonged  civil  strife  and  partly\nbecause of high urbanization coupled with low institutional capacity,\nLGUs  can  hardly  meet  the  demand  for  basic  urban  services.\nConsequently,  there  is  an  urgent  need  to  improve  urban  service\ndelivery  by  (i)  upgrading  and  expanding  infrastructure,  and  (ii)\nimproving  the  capability  and  capacity  of  LGUs  to  provide  and\nmanage  services.  Improved  basic  urban  services  will  help  reduce\npoverty  and  raise  living  standards,  strengthen  links  between  urban\nand rural areas, and support the peace process.\n\nObjectives and Scope The  Project aims to improve the quality  of  life  of  urban  residents  in\nMindanao  by  enabling  their  local  governments  to  provide,  upgrade,\nand  rehabilitate  basic  municipal  infrastructure  and  services.  The\nProject  consists  of  two  parts.  Part  A,  physical  infrastructure,  covers\ninvestments in water supply, sanitation, drainage, flood control, solid\nwaste management, urban roads, bridges, public markets, and other\npublic  facilities  for  about  40  LGUs  in  Mindanao.  Under  part  B,\ninstitutional  capacity  building,  LGUs  will  be  trained  and  assisted  in\npreparing  comprehensive  land  use  plans  and  implementing  the\nfinancial  resource  mobilization  program  so  as  to  improve  their\ncapacity \nto  plan,  provide,  manage,  and  maintain  municipal\ninvestments  and  services.  The  Project  will  also  (i)  enhance  the\naccess  of  poor  communities  in  the  project  area  to  affordable  basic\ninfrastructure  and  services,  and  (ii)  contribute  to  balanced  regional\n\n\fCost Estimates\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nLoan Amount and\nTerms\n\nCofinancing\n\nRelending\n\niii\n\ndevelopment and improved urban environment.\n\nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $60.0  million  equivalent,\ncomprising $27.6 million equivalent (46 percent) in foreign exchange\ncost and $32.4 million equivalent (54 percent) in local currency cost.\n\n($ million equivalent)\n\n   Local\n    Foreign\nCurrency       Total\n   Exchange\nSource\nAsian Development Bank     24.6                 5.4            30.0\n6.0\nNordic Development Fund      3.0\n7.3\nNational Government\n7.3\nLocal Government Units          -\nLand Bank of the Philippines   -\n9.4\nTotal                                      27.6               32.4              60.0           100___\n\n     3.0\n          -                    7.3\n     7.3\n     9.4\n\nPercent\n     50\n     10\n     12\n     12\n     16\n\nLBP  will  be  the  Borrower  and  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  will\nguarantee  the  loan  to  LBP  at  1  percent  annual  fee.  The  foreign\nexchange risk will be covered by the Republic of the Philippines at a\n4 percent annual fee to LBP on the withdrawn amount of the loan. A\nloan  of  \u00a53,676,050,000  (equivalent  to  $30.0  million)  from  ADB\u2019s\nordinary  capital  resources  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have an 18-year term, including a\ngrace  period  of  4  years;  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance\nwith  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of\n0.75  percent  per  annum;  a  front-end  fee  of  1.0  percent;  conversion\noptions  that  may  be  exercised  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the\ndraft Loan Agreement, the Loan Regulations, and ADB\u2019s Conversion\nGuidelines, and other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan\nAgreement.\n\nLBP  will  provide  $9.4  million  equivalent  from  its  own  funds  to\ncofinance  the  infrastructure  investment  component.  The  Nordic\nDevelopment  Fund  (NDF)  will  provide  approximately  $6  million\n(special  drawing  rights  4.5  million)  equivalent  to  support  the\ninstitutional  capacity-building  component,  and  the  Republic  of  the\nPhilippines  will  be  the  Borrower  of  NDF  credit.  NDF\u2019s  concessional\nloan carries no interest, and has a 40-year maturity, including a 10-\nyear grace period.\n\nLBP  will  relend  the  loan  proceeds  to  LGUs  for  urban  infrastructure\ninvestments,  according  to  the  agreed-upon  criteria.  The  relending\nrate  will  be  fixed  for  the  term  of  the  subloan  and  will  be  set  at  the\ntime  of  subloan  drawdown  to  minimize  interest  rate  risk.  It  will  be\nbased  on  the  sum  of  the  prevailing  interest  rate  of  the  Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB), its foreign exchange risk premium, and its\nguarantee  fee,  plus  LBP\u2019s  spread.  The  participating  LGUs  will\ncontribute  about  12  percent  of  the  infrastructure  investment  costs\nfrom  their  own  funds.  In  accordance  with  the  prevailing  relending\nterms for LGUs finance, the subloans to LGUs will have a maximum\nmaturity of 15 years, including a maximum grace period of 3 years.\nGrant funds from the national Government will be channeled through\nLBP as the government depository bank.\n\n\fiv\n\nPeriod of Utilization\n\nUntil 30 June 2008\n\nImplementation\nArrangements\n\nExecuting Agencies\n\nConsulting Services\n\nProcurement\n\nADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement  under ADB loans, applicable  to\ndevelopment finance institutions, will be followed.\n\nLBP  will,  for  the  infrastructure  investment,  (i)  coordinate  project\nimplementation  with  the  Department  of  the  Interior  and  Local\nGovernment  (DILG),  (ii)  oversee  the  review  and  approval  of  the\nsubloans,  (iii)  prepare  and  maintain  project  and  imprest  accounts\nseparately for project-related accounting, and (iv) have them audited\nannually  for  the  infrastructure  investment  component.

The TA, completed in May 1999, identified the scope for\ninfrastructure  investments  in  Mindanao  and  the  capacity-building  needs  of  local  government\nunits (LGUs).2 The TA also covered feasibility studies for pilot LGUs. The proposed Project was\nformulated on the basis of a sample of 13 LGUs. Subprojects were prepared for three LGUs and\ndetailed  feasibility  studies  were  made  for  five  representative  components.  The  Loan  Fact-\nFinding Mission was undertaken intermittently from June to December 1999, and LBP confirmed\nits  willingness  to  cofinance  the  proposed  Project.  Following  consultations  with  pilot  LGUs\nthrough  workshops,  and  the  Government\u2019s  endorsement,  an  Appraisal  Mission3  visited\nMindanao  in  September  2000  and  held  discussions  with  key  Government  officials  and\nrepresentatives of LBP, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and potential beneficiaries. The\nMission  reached  an  understanding  with  Government  and  LBP  on  the  project  concept,  scope,\ncost, financing, implementation arrangements, capacity-building components, and policy action\nagenda.  This  report  is  based  on  those  discussions  and  the  reports  prepared  by  the  TA\nconsultants. The project framework is shown in Appendix 1.\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA.\n\nSector Description\n\n1. \n\nUrbanization and Demand for Infrastructure\n\n3.\nThe Philippines has a population of about 75 million, of which 52 percent, or 39 million,\nis urban.4 Although the national population growth rate slowed from 3.0 percent to 2.3 percent\nper year between 1960 and 2000, the urban population grew at an average annual rate of more\nthan 5 percent over the same period. The urban population increased from 8 million in 1960 to\n39  million  in  2000.  By  2010,  the  Philippines  is  expected  to  have  about  90  million  people,  60\npercent (54 million) of them living in the urban areas.\n\n                                                \n\n1  TA 3021-PHI: Mindanao Urban Planning and Basic Services Project, for $1,000,000, approved on 27 May 1998.\n2  Government  in  the  Philippines  comprises  four  levels  of  administration:  national,  provincial  (78),  city  (83)  and\nmunicipality  (1,527),  and  barangay  (equivalent  to  community:  41,960).  All  authorities  below  the  national\nGovernment are generally referred to as local government units (LGUs). The proposed Project uses the term LGUs\nto refer to city and municipal administration.\n\n3  The Mission comprised K. Choe, Urban Economist/Mission Leader; F. Yue, Programs Officer; K. Emzita,  Counsel;\nS.  Akimura,  Urban  Development  Specialist;  S.  Handayani,  Social  Development  Specialist;  H.  Huang,  Control\nOfficer; A. Palacio, Financial/Economic Analyst, Staff Consultant; J. Mendoza, Policy/Institutional Specialist, Staff\nConsultant; and C. Ledesma, Thomsons Ratings Banking/Financial Specialist, Staff Consultant.\n\n4 The definition of \u201curban\u201d provided by the National Economic and Development Authority  is based on a population\ndensity  of  more  than  500  residents  per  square  kilometer    and  the  existence  of  certain  basic  facilities,  such  as  a\nchurch, a plaza, a market, and a public building in cities and municipalities.\n\n\f2\n\n4.\nThe  fast  growth  in  the  urban  population  has  resulted  in  a  substantial  backlog  in  the\ndelivery of urban services. Despite gradual improvements, only about 60 percent of those living\nin  urban  areas  have  access  to  household  water  supply,  and  almost  none  have  access  to\nsewerage  systems.  Almost  40  percent  of  solid  waste  remains  uncollected  or  is  thrown  into\nunsanitary open dump sites. Traffic congestion is common as there is only 1 kilometer (km) of\nurban  roads  for  every  1,800  people.  Every  year,  flooding  occurs  due  to  inadequate  drainage\nand  flood  protection  facilities.  This  causes  damage  to  property  and  loss  of  human  lives.5\nInsufficient and unsanitary facilities in public markets, which are usually located at town centers,\ninhibit productive economic activities and threaten public health.\n\n5.\nThe Philippines faces the difficult task of providing and maintaining an adequate level of\nbasic  infrastructure  and  municipal  services.  Rapid  urbanization  continues  to  place  enormous\npressure  on  government  institutions,  which  must  supply  the  urban  services  needed  to  sustain\neconomic growth and to improve the quality of life. The poor urban communities in particular are\ndisadvantaged by the high level of service deprivation and environmental degradation.\n\n2. \n\nUrban Poverty\n\nAbout  eight  million  urban  people,  or  21.5  percent  of  the  urban  population6  in  the\n6.\nPhilippines,  live  below  the  poverty  line,  which  is  defined  as  a  minimum  yearly  income  of\nP12,577 per person.7 Most urban poor live in a blighted environment, with little or no access to\nbasic  urban  infrastructure  and  services,  sanitation,  capital  assets  or  financial  sources,  and\nemployment  and  livelihood  opportunities.  If  unmeasured  deprivation  of  access  to  basic\ninfrastructure services as well as unaccounted-for informal settlers were taken into account, at\nleast one third of the urban population would be considered urban poor.8 Though the incidence\nof  poverty  in  urban  areas  is  lower  than  the  national  average  (37.5  percent  of  population),  the\nuneven concentration of poverty and poor living conditions in urban areas makes urban poverty\nrelatively harsher than rural poverty. Urban poverty statistics based on income data alone do not\ncapture the dire living conditions of the urban poor, and urban poverty has been recognized as a\nkey sector issue9 that must be urgently addressed.\n\n3.\n\nSector Institutions\n\nThe passage of the Local Government Code (LGC) in 1991 triggered decentralization of\n7.\nauthority  and  responsibilities  for  financing,  managing,  and  developing  urban  areas  from  the\nnational  Government  to  LGUs.  The  national  Government  retains  responsibility  for  policy  and\nstrategy formulation, legislative and regulatory control, advisory services, and capital investment\nin  national  infrastructure.  Because  urban  development  is  a  complex  process,  several\ndepartments and agencies are involved in the urban sector. At the central level, the Department\nof  the  Interior  and  Local  Government  (DILG)  is  mandated  to  guide  and  strengthen  the\nadministrative performance of LGUs. The Department of Finance (DOF) and the Department of\nBudget  and  Management  (DBM)  are  responsible  for  fiscal  management,  resource  allocation,\nand  budget  sharing  between  the  national  and  local  governments.  The  National  Economic  and\nDevelopment Authority (NEDA) makes national and regional plans, and the Housing and Urban\nDevelopment Coordinating Council (HUDCC) formulates urban sector policy. The Department of\nPublic  Works  and  Highways  (DPWH)  carries  out  national  physical  infrastructure  development\n\n                                                \n\n5  In 1997 alone, the damage caused by flooding was estimated to cost over P2 billion.\n6  According to the most recent poverty data available (ADB, 2000. Philippines: Country Assistance Plan).\n7  The current threshold is equivalent to only three fourths of the international standard measure, \u201cdollar per day.\u201d\n8  ADB, 1999. Urban Sector Profile: Philippines.\n9  National Anti-Poverty Commission, Philippines. National Anti-Poverty Action Agenda 2000.\n\n\f3\n\nand  the  Department  of  Environment  and  Natural  Resources  (DENR)  enforces  environmental\nregulations,  issues  environmental  compliance  certificates  for  projects,  and  monitors  urban\nenvironmental  development.  Each  agency  has  a  specific  role  in  urban  development,  but  their\nvarious  responsibilities  are  not  well  coordinated.  To  improve  the  efficiency  of  urban  sector\nmanagement,  coordination  by  the  national  Government  needs  to  be  strengthened  to  set  the\nplanning framework and ensure consistent management guidelines. The institutional framework\nthat clearly defines the roles of the government departments and the relevant agencies must be\ndeveloped.\n\nAt  the  regional  level,  the  regional  development  councils  facilitate  intragovernment\n8.\ntransactions,  and  coordinate  and  prioritize  development  and  investment  proposals.  DILG\nregional and field offices (province, city, and municipal) are the extension arms of the DILG for\nsupervising and monitoring local government functions and implementation of national programs\nby LGUs. DILG has strong vertical links to maintain dialogue with LGUs at all levels. DILG has\nnot yet operationalized any means to assess the operations, performance, and governance of\nLGUs and to promote their managerial and technical productivity.\n\nAt  city  and  municipal  levels,  LGUs  are  classified  into  six  income  classes  according  to\n9.\ntheir revenue, land area, and population, with class I LGUs having the highest income and class\nVI  the  lowest.  The  first  class  cities  and  municipalities  should  have  had  an  average  annual\nincome of, at least, P120 million and P20 million (in 1991 constant price), respectively, while the\nsixth  class  cities  and  municipalities  may  have  had  an  average  annual  income  less  than  P20\nmillion  and  P4  million  (in  1991  constant  price),  respectively.  Under  the  LGC,  all  LGUs,\nregardless  of  income,  are  expected  to  provide  the  local  infrastructure  and  municipal  services\nneeded by residents. LGUs need to be self-reliant to finance essential urban infrastructure and\nservices, such as water supply,10 sanitation, drainage, flood control, solid waste management,\nmunicipal  roads,  bridges,  public  markets,  transport  terminals,  and  other  municipal  enterprise\nfacilities.\n\n4.\n\nLGU Finances\n\n10.\nAbout  two  thirds  of  LGU  revenues  come  from  the  internal  revenue  allotment  (IRA)\nprovided by the national Government, and the remaining third from local taxes and other local\nrevenues.  With  their  substantial  reliance  on  the  national  budget  and  expanded  taxing  powers\nunder the LGC, LGUs are expected to set aside 20 percent of their IRA for local development\nfunds.\n\nApart from the IRA, LGUs may avail themselves of debt financing for investment capital\n11.\nfrom the Municipal Development Fund (MDF), government financial institutions (GFIs) such as\nLBP and Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), or private banks (primarily the Philippine\nNational Bank, which was a GFI until its recent privatization). The development funds from IRA\ncan  be  a  significant  source  of  cash  flows  that  can  be  tapped  into  for  the  long-term  capital\nrequired  for  infrastructure  development.  However,  many  lower  class  LGUs  have  underutilized\nborrowing  capacity  and  are  constrained  in  delivering  basic  services  because  of  lack  of\ninvestment  capital.  In  general,  private  banks  are  reluctant  to  lend  to  LGUs  mainly  because  (i)\nthe banks have no access to information on the financial status of LGUs, (ii) LGUs do not have\ndeposits at hand to serve as collateral, and (iii) the banks do not specialize in term lending for\ncapital  investment.  GFIs,  which  are  the  authorized  depository  banks  for  LGUs,  therefore  have\n\n                                                \n\n10  About 1,000 water supply utilities managed by LGUs in smaller urban and rural areas deliver the service to over\n31 million people, while 500 water districts under the Local Water Utilities Administration serve 33 percent of the\ntotal urban population.\n\n\f4\n\nan  edge  over  private  banks  when  it  comes  to  lending  to  LGUs.  Though  the  GFIs  can  use  the\nLGUs\u2019  deposits  or  scheduled  deposits  (such  as  IRA  funds)  as  collateral,  their  resources  are\nlimited  to  short-term  lending.  LGUs  also  do  not  have  direct  access  to  official  development\nassistance  loans  since  these  loans  usually  require  guarantees  from  the  national  Government.\nFor  their  financing  needs,  lower-income  LGUs  rely  mostly  on  the  MDF,11  which  has  a  rigid\napplication  and  approval  process.  Underresourced  LGUs  must  be  given  more  access  to  and\ninformation about financial intermediaries for their long-term capital needs.\n\n12. While LGUs have taxation authority under the LGC, lack of experience among their staff,\nlack  of  political  will,  and  inefficiencies  in  fiscal  management  have  generally  kept  them  from\nexercising such authority effectively. Lower-income LGUs tend to rely more on the IRA portion\n(up  to  90  percent  of  annual  revenues)  than  higher-income  LGUs  do  (35  percent  for  highly\nurbanized  cities),  and  thus  have  low  capital  reserves.  LGUs  are  more  likely  to  generate\nrevenues  from  municipal  enterprises  rather  than  from  improvements  in  the  tax  base  through\nstrategic  financial  planning  and  fiscal  management.  Lower-income  LGUs  (those  between\nclasses  III  and  VI)  have  relatively  weak  financial  management  capability  and  cannot  meet  the\ngrowing demand for better services. The imbalance calls for an improved tax basis and active\nlending  by  creditors.  Comprehensive  capability  and  capacity  building  is  needed  to  promote\nbalanced growth and to help underresourced LGUs improve their capacity to function properly\nand thus achieve efficient decentralization.\n\n5.\n\nMindanao\n\n13.\nMindanao is composed of five administrative regions (IX, X, XI, XII, CARAGA), and the\nAutonomous  Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), with a total of 24 provinces, 19 cities, and\nabout 408  urban and rural municipalities. Of the 17 million people living in Mindanao, about 6\nmillion (35 percent) are classified as urban dwellers. Mindanao is lagging behind the rest of the\ncountry economically: over one third of its labor force is unemployed or underemployed, and per\ncapita income is only 75 percent of the national average. The Mindanao urban sector accounts\nfor only about 50 percent of gross regional product for the region, lower than the proportion of\nthe urban sector as a whole in the national economy (about 80 percent).\n\n14.\nDeficiencies  in  urban  infrastructure  and  service  levels  in  Mindanao  are  higher  than  the\nnational  average.  For  example,  the  incidence  of  the  use  of  drinking  water  from  potentially\npolluted sources is 24 percent in urban Mindanao, compared with 12 percent in the Philippines\nas a whole. Similarly, whereas almost 80 percent of households in the urban Philippines have\naccess to water-sealed toilets, only 60 percent of households in Mindanao enjoy such facilities.\nThe inadequacies in basic infrastructure services in Mindanao are due partly to the difficulty of\naccess to capital markets and partly to the weak technical, institutional, and financial capacity of\nthe  LGUs  in  the  region.  The  National  Anti-Poverty  Commission,  in  its  National  Anti-Poverty\nAgenda  2000,  states  that  measures  for  strengthening  institutional  capacity  are  fundamental  to\naddressing poverty reduction.\n\n15.\nPoverty  is  also  an  endemic  problem  in  Mindanao.  In  1997,  among  the  regions,\nMindanao had the highest incidence of poverty in its urban areas (37 percent). The incidence of\npoverty was highest (51 percent) in the urban areas of ARMM and lowest in the urban areas of\nregions IX (26 percent) and XI (27 percent), respectively, but the two latter regions had a higher\n\n                                                \n\n11  The  Municipal  Development  Fund  (MDF)  was  established  in  1984,  under  DOF.  It  is  a  conduit  for  foreign\nassistance,  in  the  form  of  revolving  funds,  to  LGUs.  The  funds  are  generally  available  to  lower  class  LGUs\n(classes III, IV, V, and VI).\n\n\f5\n\nproportion  of  the  extreme  poor.12  Given  the  urban  poverty  threshold  of  about  P11,500  in\nMindanao, a survey carried out in representative core pilot LGUs13 at the end of 1998 revealed\nan average of nearly 50 percent poverty in the urban areas. Many urban dwellers, particularly\nthe poor, have limited access to basic infrastructure and essential municipal services that cities\nare expected to offer.\n\n16.\nThe Government aims to promote balanced economic growth with equity throughout the\ncountry, in part by developing strategic urban areas as regional socioeconomic centers. For the\ndevelopment of Mindanao, the Government has recognized the importance of peace and order.\nFollowing the signing of the Formal Peace Agreement in September 1996, Executive Order 371\ncreated the Special Zone for Peace and Development (SZOPAD)14 to (i) provide basic services\nin  depressed  areas,  (ii)  promote  investment  opportunities,  and  (iii)  provide  capability-building\nassistance  to  local  community  organizations.  The  recent  resurgence  of  armed  conflict  in\nMindanao has again made peace and order the focal concern for long-term sustainable social\nand economic development in the region. At the same time, the Government recognizes that, in\naddition to the political dimension, economic development is fundamental to lasting peace.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n17.\nThe  Government  policy  framework  for  the  urban  sector  is  contained  in  the  National\nUrban  Development  and  Housing  Framework  (NUDHF),  1999\u20132004.15  The  NUDHF  covers\nmajor  policy  recommendations  on  (i)  urban  development  as  a  means  of  economic  growth,  (ii)\nurban  land  management  as  integrated  development  planning,  (iii)  urban  environmental\nmanagement to improve the quality of life, (iv) physical infrastructure as strategic interventions\nto  improve  productivity  and  provide  employment    opportunities,  (v)  affordable  shelter  for  the\nurban  poor,  and  (vi)  improvements  in  LGU  governance  capacity.  Approved  in  May  2000,  the\nNUDHF  is  a  major  step  to  the  sound  development  of  the  urban  sector,  linking  urban\ndevelopment with economic growth, spatial integration, institution building, and a better quality\nof life for urban residents.\n\n18.\nThe  Philippine  National  Development  Plan:  Directions  for  the  21st  Century  sets  long-\nterm (up to the year 2025) development goals. The Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan\n(MTPDP), 1999\u20132004, establishes shorter-term (up to 2004) objectives for the country based on\nthose goals. The overarching development objective is economic growth with social equity. The\nconcept  encompasses  both  industrial  development  and  agricultural  growth,  at  the  same  time\nemphasizing poverty reduction as a critical element of the development strategy. At the national\nlevel,  these  policy  and  strategic  initiatives  imply  the  key  policy  directions  of  reducing  regional\ndisparities and closing the poverty gap between Mindanao and the rest of the country.\n\n19.\nThe  overall  policy  framework  for  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  is  in  the\nSocial  Reform  and  Poverty  Alleviation  Act,  passed  in  1997.  The  Government  has  adopted  an\narea-based,  sectoral,  and  focused  intervention  approach  to  poverty  reduction,  which  is\nincorporated in the MTPDP. The MTPDP sets forth the national development policy for the next\nfive years to reduce social and economic inequality and at the same time ensure steady growth\nof  income.  The  Project  supports  the  Government\u2019s  objectives  and  approaches  to  area-based\nsectoral poverty reduction.\n\n                                                \n\n12  The extreme poor are those with an annual income of less than P8,000.

Mindanao  has,\nmoreover,  been  given  an  increasingly  high  priority  in  economic  planning  and  Government\nbudget allocation.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n21.\nSeveral  external  assistance  agencies  are  involved  in  the  urban  sector.  ADB  has  been\ninvolved  in  the  Philippine  water  supply  sector  for  over  two  decades,  and  began  assisting  the\nbroader  urban  sector  in  1995.  ADB  has  adopted  a  comprehensive  urban  development\napproach,  providing  assistance  to  improve  basic  urban  infrastructure  and  build  institutional\ncapacity among the participating LGUs. The Regional Municipal Development Project16 focused\non the development of rapidly growing provincial cities, including General Santos and Iligan in\nMindanao.  The  Subic  Bay  Area  Municipal  Development17  and  Clark  Area  Municipal\nDevelopment18 projects included infrastructure improvements in LGUs in the special economic\nzones,  together  with  comprehensive  institutional  development  support  for  the  participating\nLGUs.  The  recently  approved  Pasig  River  Environmental  Management  and  Rehabilitation\nSector  Development  Program19  also  has  a  strong  focus  on  urban  poverty  reduction  and\nenvironmental improvement.\n\n22.\nIn addition to providing TA for integrated urban development projects, ADB continues to\nuse TAs to build institutional capacity. To strengthen the institutional, legislative, and regulatory\nframework of the Philippine urban sector, it has provided three advisory TAs20 to relevant urban\nsector  agencies.  ADB  has  also  paid  particular  attention  to  strengthening  the  overall  financing\ncapability  of  LGUs.  Among  the  TAs  provided  for  this  purpose  are  a  TA  to  strengthen  the  in-\nhouse  capabilities  of  LBP  to  finance  LGU  infrastructure  projects,21  a  TA  loan  to  LBP  for  a\nrevolving credit facility for private sector participation in local infrastructure development,22 and a\nTA  to  the  Department  of  Budget  and  Management  to  develop  the  financial  capacity  and\nresource mobilization of LGUs. 23\n\nOver  the  last  three  decades,  the  World  Bank  has  assisted  the  Philippine  urban  sector\n23.\nthrough  a  series  of  comprehensive  urban  infrastructure  development  programs,  including  the\nRegional  Cities  Development  Project,  the  Municipal  Development  Project,  and  the  Local\nGovernment Finance and Development Project. These projects aim to promote decentralization\nand to strengthen Government financing mechanisms for local investment projects.

The  United  Nations  Development  Programme  has  provided\nsome  support  to  strengthen  local  environmental  planning  and  management  capacities  of\nselected cities under its Sustainable Cities Program. By far the largest bilateral contributor in the\nurban  sector  has  been  Japan,  primarily  through  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation\n(JBIC) and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). JICA has supported a program\nproviding  road  construction  equipment  assistance  in  Mindanao.  Other  bilateral  agencies,\nincluding  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID),  the  United  States\nAgency  for  International  Development  (USAID),  the  European  Union,  and  the  Canadian\nInternational  Development  Agency,  have  provided  assistance  in  decentralization,  capacity\nbuilding,  and  the  rehabilitation  programs  of  SZOPAD.  USAID  has  been  actively  supporting  a\nnumber  of  local  development  programs  in  Mindanao  such  as  the  Growth  with  Equity  Program\nand the Governance and Local Democracy Program.\n\n25.\nIn  the  course  of  project  processing,  ADB  maintained  close  coordination  with  various\ninternational aid agencies active in the urban sector, such as JICA, JBIC, the Ministry of Foreign\nAffairs  of  Finland,  the  Nordic  Development  Fund  (NDF),  the  Nordic  Investment  Bank,  the\nSwedish  International  Development  Agency,  the  AusAID,  and  the  Islamic  Development  Bank.\nThe  coordination  enabled  ADB  to  exchange  information  with  these  agencies  on  sector-related\nactivities  and  to  seek  cofinancing  possibilities.  As  a  result,  NDF24  has  expressed  interest  in\nparticipating  in  the  social  infrastructure  sector,  and  has  agreed  to  cofinance  the  institutional\ncapacity building program of the proposed Project.\n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nBased  on  the  results  of  the  midterm  review  of  the  Regional  Municipal  Development\n26.\nProject  and  the  experience  of  other  international  agencies,  the  following  lessons  have  been\nlearned: (i) the commitment of local institutions and communities is essential; (ii) advance action\nis needed for recruiting consultants and establishing project implementation arrangements and\noffices  to  avoid  start-up  delays;  (iii)  financial  incentives,  such  as  matching  grants,  should  be\nconsidered for underresourced LGUs to encourage them to engage in environmental projects;\n(iv) funds must be channeled efficiently to LGUs to elicit their participation; and (v) LGUs should\nbe given comprehensive assistance in capacity building to sustain development impact.\n\n27.\nThe  most  important  considerations  in  project  design  are  ensuring  strong  commitment\nfrom the participating LGUs to avoid delays, and building local government capacity to operate\nand maintain facilities and promote the policy agenda. The proposed Project adopts a demand-\ndriven approach, which will require early commitment from the LGUs, and thus make the project\nless  susceptible  to  changes  in  political  leadership  and  development  priorities.  LGUs  and  end\nusers  will  be  fully  involved  from  the  start  to  build  a  sense  of  ownership  of  the  demand-driven\nsubprojects. LGUs\u2019 participation will require acceptance of the recommendations resulting from\ninstitutional capacity-building programs built into the proposed Project. The sector approach to\nthe proposed Project will likewise allow greater flexibility during implementation.\n\n                                                \n\n24  NDF has provided consulting services and equipment for economic social infrastructure development during the\nlast decade in Bangladesh, Kyrgyz, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Maldives, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, and\nSir Lanka together with ADB. Loan 1750-PHI: Education and Skills Development, for $25.0 million, approved on\n24 August 2000, is the first project in the Philippines cofinanced by NDF ($8.0 million equivalent) with ADB.\n\n\f8\n\n28.\nADB\u2019s  experience  in  the  Philippines  urban  sector  has  shown  that  the  projects  should\ninclude  a  component  of  grant  financing  from  the  national  Government  for  nonrevenue-\ngenerating subprojects, particularly those of low-income LGUs, to balance development across\nLGUs.  Furthermore,  channeling  the  loan  proceeds  requires  efficient  and  effective  operations.\nThe use of governmental financial intermediaries, such as LBP or DBP, will improve operations\nof sublending to LGUs because of their better field presence.\n\nE.\n\nADB\u2019s Urban Sector Strategy\n\nADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  for  the  Philippines25  conforms  closely  to  the  Government\u2019s\n29.\ndevelopment  priorities.  The  strategy  places  increased  importance  on  poverty  reduction  and\nsocial  development  by  (i)  promoting  equitable  growth,  (ii)  improving  basic  social  services,  and\n(iii)  improving  management  and  protection  of  the  environment.  In  the  urban  sector,  ADB\u2019s\ndevelopment  strategy  calls  for  (i)  encouraging  integrated  urban  development  initiatives;  (ii)\nassisting  the  Government  in  strengthening  its  institutional  structure;  (iii)  supporting  LGUs  in\nfinancial,  institutional,  and  administrative  capacity  building;  (iv)  rationalizing  the  financing\nmechanism  for  urban  development  under  the  decentralized  government  system;  and  (v)\ndeveloping public-private partnerships in delivering and managing essential urban infrastructure\nservices.\n\n30.\nThe urban sector strategy also calls for incremental and systematic expansion of ADB\u2019s\ninvolvement in the sector. The increasing complexity of the sector and the large number of its\ninstitutions require in-depth analysis and focus on policy and institutional issues, which in turn\nrequire emphasis on capacity building. Projects must be carefully prepared and their institutional\naspects  emphasized \nincrease  sustainability.  Project\ninterventions  to  address  equity  issues  are  also  needed.  The  project  intervention  in  Mindanao,\nwhich involves both infrastructure investments and capacity building for LGUs in the region, is\nconsistent with ADB\u2019s strategy.\n\nto  maximize  project  benefits  and \n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n31.\nADB  has  had  continuing  dialogue  with  the  Philippine  Government  since  the  start  of  its\nassistance  to  the  urban  development  sector.  The  policy  dialogue  in  conjunction  with  the\nproposed Project has covered a wide range of issues in the sector, ranging from overall sector\ndevelopment to specific capacity building needs in the project area. This includes the need to (i)\nformulate  an  integrated  investment  plan  consistent  with  urban  development  sector  framework\nand  policy,  (ii)  strengthen  institutional  capacity  to  increase  the  efficiency  of  management\nfunctions, (iii) develop guiding principles for cost sharing in LGU infrastructure development, (iv)\nexpand  access  to  GFIs,  and  (v)  support  decentralization  based  on  better  fiscal  and  resource\nmanagement  by  LGUs.  The  major  directions  of  the  policy  dialogue  are  outlined  below.  The\ncurrent  situation  and  agreed-upon  policy  actions  are  presented  in  a  time-bound  action  plan\n(Appendix 2).\n\n1.\n\nSector Development Policy\n\n32. With  ADB  support,  the  Government  has  prepared  the  NUHDF  for  1999-2004,  using  a\nconsultative  participatory  approach,26  to  provide  a  comprehensive  policy  framework  for\ndevelopment  and  to  guide  interventions  in  the  sector.

Country Operational Strategy, Philippines.\n26  Numerous consultation workshops involving core technical working groups of national Government agencies were\nundertaken. Nationwide consultation seminars were also carried out to get the views of local governments, civic\norganizations, nongovernment agencies, and the private sector.\n\n\f9\n\nconsultations, the Government recognizes that improvement can occur only gradually, over the\nlong  term  and  through  the  coordinated  effort  of  various  agencies  in  the  development  process.\nMoreover,  it  realizes  that,  despite  decentralization,  the  national  Government  must  provide\noverall  guidance  to  local  governments  as  they  put  its  principles  into  action.  The  Government\nplans to draw up an action plan, including an integrated investment program,27 to operationalize\nand implement the NUDHF.\n\n2.\n\nSector Management\n\nADB  has  assisted  the  Government  in  assessing  alternative  ways  of  improving  the\n33.\ninstitutional  structure  for  urban  sector  development.28  To  promote  efficient  and  sound  sector\ndevelopment, (i) the legal framework for the key agencies in the urban sector was reviewed, and\n(ii)  recommendations  for  improving  interdepartmental  coordination  were  prepared.  The\nGovernment  has  agreed  to  review  the  functions  and  responsibilities  of  agencies  involved  in\nurban sector development, and to define clear and appropriate institutional functions.\n\n34.\nThe policy dialogue with the Government has also dealt with urban sector management.\nThe  LGC  provides  the  legal  framework  for  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  LGUs  in  overall\ndevelopment,  and  DILG  supervises  LGU  administration.  However,  beyond  the  administrative\nstructure  itself,  very  few  measures  deal  specifically  with  the  supervision,  monitoring,\nassessment, and improvement of LGUs\u2019 administrative performance. The Local Productivity and\nPerformance  Measurement  Program  initiated  by  DILG  in  1999  focused  mainly  on  limited\nmonitoring  indicators  of  administrative  functions.  The  Government  expects  to  strengthen  the\nperformance measurement scheme, including governance, and to test the scheme through the\nproposed Project area, before applying it nationwide.\n\n3.\n\nLGU Finance in the Urban Sector\n\nThe LGU financing policies29 of the Government are intended to encourage LGUs to rely\n35.\nless on transfers from the national Government and more on locally generated resources, and\nto  increase  LGU  access  to  private  funds.  Only  very  limited  and  selected  national  Government\ngrants  are  made  primarily  to  the  weaker  LGUs  for  environmental  nonrevenue-generating\nprojects.  A  TA  (footnote  23)  has  been  provided  to  strengthen  public  finance  and  the  cost-\nsharing  framework  for  LGUs  supporting  the  Government\u2019s  policy  to  rationalize  cost-sharing\nschemes  for  urban  infrastructure  development  between  the  national  Government  and  LGUs.\nThe general principles for financial cost sharing between them remain an important policy issue\nfor further study and consensus within the Government. Under the Project, policy dialogue with\nthe Government in this area dwelt particularly on reforms needed to accelerate development in\nMindanao. Accordingly, a grant financing scheme to finance weaker LGUs\u2019 revenue- as well as\nnonrevenue-generating components was agreed upon with the Government under the proposed\nProject.\n\n4.\n\nInvolving GFIs in LGU Financing\n\n36.\nThe  major  sources  of  capital  finance  for  LGUs  are  the  MDF  Office  and  the  two  GFIs:\nDBP  and  LBP.  While  MDF  operations  are  being  restructured  to  streamline  operational\n\n                                                \n\n27 The Urban Development and Housing Investment Plan will be prepared with external assistance.\n28 TA 3475-PHI: Institutional Strengthening of Housing and Urban Development Sector, for $150,000, approved on 2\n\n29  Department  of  Finance.  1996. LGU Financing of Basic Services and Infrastructure Projects: A New Vision and\n\nAugust 2000.\n\nPolicy Framework.\n\n\f10\n\nefficiency,30 the development mission of LBP should be supported by a sound financial position\nand access to long-term capital financing. LBP, with its widespread branch network throughout\nthe country, particularly in the project area, has led in providing financial assistance to LGUs. To\nensure effective project implementation, the Government agreed to channel its counterpart fund\nusing  the  same  conduit,  LBP,  instead  of  the  MDF  Office.  Also,  to  ensure  LBP's  long-term\ninvolvement  and  continued  financial  support  for  LGUs,  LBP\u2019s  staff  will  be  trained  to  process,\nevaluate,  and  administer  development  projects  through  an  institutional  capacity-building\nprogram.\n\n5.\n\nBuilding the Capacity of LGUs\n\n37.\nInstitutional  strengthening  and  capability  building,  especially  at  the  local  government\nlevel, is an important long-term objective, particularly in the context of decentralization. ADB has\nbeen an active partner of the Government to address the need to improve local governance and\nefficient  delivery  of  Government  services  at  the  local  level.  LGU  capacity-building  measures\ninclude  the  developing  and  upgrading  strategic  and  managerial  capacities,  particularly  for  the\nenhancement  of  local  tax  revenue  in  connection  with  land  resource  and  tax  property\nmanagement.  To  promote  effective  land  resource  management,  the  Government  urges  all\nLGUs  to  prepare  and  submit  comprehensive  land  use  planning.  ADB  assistance  under  the\nProject  will  help  strengthen  LGUs  capacity  for  strategic  financial  planning  by  connecting\nproperty taxation with comprehensive land use planning.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\n1. \n\nProject Rationale\n\nUrban growth in the Philippines has outpaced the provision of basic urban infrastructure\n38.\nand  services,  adversely  affecting  the  quality  of  life  and  the  environment.  LGUs,  with\nresponsibility for urban development are hard pressed to meet the rapid increase in the demand\nfor  municipal  services.  The  urban  poor,  in  particular,  do  not  have  adequate  access  to  basic\nservices and facilities. A comprehensive and sustainable solution to the problem of inadequate\nbasic urban infrastructure is, therefore, urgently needed.\n\n39.\nMindanao, the Philippines\u2019 second largest island, is often referred to as the food basket\nof the country because of its rich natural resources. But peace and order problems have slowed\nits  development.  Compared  with  the  rest  of  the  country,  urban  poverty  is  more  widespread,\nincome  per  capita  is  lower,  and  the  urban  areas  offer  even  less  coverage  of  municipal\ninfrastructure  and  basic  services.  Existing  disparities  within  Mindanao  also  hamper  equitable\ngrowth. The 1996 Peace Agreement and the associated creation of SZOPAD were intended to\nspeed up development in areas racked by civil strife. Only limited success has been achieved,\nhowever, partly because of low access to the capital markets and lack of opportunities for local\ngovernments to initiate and implement development programs. The proposed Project supports\nthe Government\u2019s peace and development framework, and its efforts to rehabilitate urban areas\nin Mindanao and to promote equitable development in the country.\n\n                                                \n\n30 An executive order was issued by the President of the Philippines (E.O. No. 41) to convert MDF into a Municipal\n\nDevelopment Fund Office under the Office of Secretary of DOF.\n\n\f11\n\n40.\nThe  urban  economy  of  the  Philippines  contributes  a  major  share  of  the  gross  national\nproduct.31 Improvements in urban infrastructure in Mindanao will not only improve the efficiency\nof  urban  economic  activities  but  also  benefit  surrounding  peri-urban  areas.  The  proposed\nProject  contributes  to  overall  economic  growth  by  providing  basic  urban  infrastructure  with  a\nfocus of balanced regional development and by strengthening the capacity of participating LGUs\nto  plan,  provide,  manage,  and  maintain  municipal  services.  About  2  million  people  in  urban\nMindanao, including at least 0.8 million below the poverty line, would benefit from the targeted\nsectoral  intervention.  The  proposed  approach  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  urban  sector  strategy,\nwhich  pursues  the  overarching  goal  of  poverty  reduction  by  addressing  deficiencies  in\nto  urban\ninfrastructure,  supporting  decentralization,  and  adopting  a  holistic  approach \ndevelopment.\n\n2.\n\nProject Area\n\n41.\nThe project area will cover LGUs with a minimum urban population of 20,000 in the year\n2000 or expected to exceed 20,000 by 2002. Of the 427 city and municipal LGUs in Mindanao,\nabout 108 would meet this criterion. The 108 LGUs\u201467 in SZOPAD including 12 in ARMM, and\n41 in non-SZOPAD area \u2014 have some five million people, or more than 80 percent of the urban\npopulation of Mindanao. There are 19 cities and 89 municipalities, 55 percent of them in income\nclasses  III  to  VI  in  the  LGU  sample.  From  the  preliminary  assessment  of  demand  for  urban\ninfrastructure, about 40 LGUs are expected to participate. Those that signified their interest and\npotential demand for investment are listed in Appendix 3.\n\n3.\n\nSector Approach\n\nA sector lending approach will be used for the Project, which entails a large number of\n42.\ninvestments of varying sizes (mostly $0.2 million-$6 million) spread throughout Mindanao. This\nwill  provide  the  needed  flexibility  to  make  adjustments  in  the  investment  programs  as\nimplementation  proceeds.  The  sector  lending  mode  is  considered  appropriate  in  view  of  the\nfollowing considerations:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  overall  sector  policies  and  strategies  of  the  Government  for  urban\ninfrastructure  development  are  sound,  and  a  development  planning  framework\nfor Mindanao has been formulated.\n\nA sound investment plan exists. The Project will finance a time slice (2002-2007)\nand  an  area  slice  (Mindanao  urban  LGUs)  of  the  plan.  Appendix  4  outlines  the\nphysical investment plan for the urban sector of Mindanao.\n\nThe  Executing  Agencies  (EAs),  DILG  and  LBP,  have  the  necessary  experience\nto implement the Project. DILG has been implementing three projects with ADB\nsupport,  and  LBP  has  been  implementing  five.  Part  B  of  the  Project  will  assist\nLGUs in implementing the infrastructure investments.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n43.\nThe long-term development goal of the Project is to improve the quality of life of urban\nresidents in Mindanao by providing, upgrading, and rehabilitating basic municipal infrastructure\nand  services.  The  immediate  objectives  are  to  (i)  provide,  upgrade,  and  rehabilitate  basic\n\n                                                \n\n31 About half of the population in the Philippines is rural: it contributed about 20 percent of gross domestic product in\n\n1998, while the urban half accounted for almost 80 percent.\n\n\f12\n\nmunicipal  infrastructure  and  services  to  increase  the  productivity  of  the  urban  and  peri-urban\neconomy;  (ii)  improve  the  access  of  urban  poor  communities  to  basic  municipal  services;  and\n(iii)  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  and  capability  of  LGUs  to  provide,  manage,  and\nmaintain adequate municipal services and basic urban infrastructure.\n\nThe proposed Project addresses the need for more equitable growth by balancing LGUs\u2019\n44.\ncommitments  through  a  demand-driven  approach  and  providing  financing  opportunities  for\nlower-income  LGUs.  The  proposed  approach  reflects  previous  experiences  in  the  sector,  and\nwill help to minimize development gaps between stronger (high-income, or classes I and II) and\nweaker  (low-income,  or  classes  III  to  VI)  LGUs.  The  Project  will  help  strengthen  LGUs  within\nand outside the SZOPAD area, and enable them to initiate and execute development projects.\n\n45.\nThe  Project  has  two  parts:  A,  infrastructure  investment;  and  B,  institutional  capacity-\nbuilding  program  (ICBP).  Part  A  will  finance  subprojects  initiated  by  about  40  LGUs\n(subborrowers)  in  Mindanao.  The  subprojects  will  comprise  urban  infrastructure  and  services\ncomponents.  Initial  contacts  and  consultation  with  potentially  interested  LGUs  indicate  that\nabout  one  third  of  the  components  will  be  nonrevenue-generating  (roads,  bridges,  sanitation,\ndrainage,  flood  protection,  solid  waste  management,  etc.)  while  two  thirds  will  be  revenue-\ngenerating (water supply facilities, public markets, bus terminals, and other public enterprises).\nThe components eligible for financing under part A are the following:\n\n (i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(v)\n\n (vi)\n\nLocal roads and bridges: rehabilitating and constructing of local roads, sidewalks,\nand bridges; providing maintenance equipment; and improving streetlights.\n\nSanitation,  drainage,  and  flood  control:  providing  for  sludge  collection  and\ntransportation  equipment,  constructing  low-cost  sludge  treatment  facilities,  and\nconstructing  low-cost  wastewater  treatment  facilities;  upgrading  drains  or  river\nembankments to increase capacity; and constructing new facilities necessary to\nease flooding.\n\nSolid  waste  management:  providing  equipment,  vehicles,  and  facilities  for  solid\nwaste  management;  upgrading  facilities  and  disposal  sites;  and  constructing\ndisposal and recycling facilities.\n\n(iv) Water supply: rehabilitating and upgrading source works, treatment facilities, and\ntransmission  systems;  rehabilitating  or  upgrading  distribution  systems  and\nreducing  unaccounted-for  water;  and  constructing  source  works,  deep  wells,\npumping facilities, low-cost treatment facilities, and transmission and distribution\nsystems, including level III house connections, managed by LGUs.\n\nPublic  market  and  bus  terminals:  constructing  public  market  facilities  and  bus\nterminals,  or  improving  sanitary  and  safety  conditions  of  markets  infrastructure\nfacilities;  improving  access  roads  or  footpaths  to  markets;  improving  lighting\nconditions and market kiosks.\n\nOther public facilities: rehabilitating or constructing public facilities, and upgrading\nor  creating  local  municipal  enterprises  mandated  by  LGC  to  improve  economic\nproductivity  and  quality  of  life  for  the  LGU  residents.  These  facilities  include\nenvironmental management services or facilities related to general hygiene and\nsanitation  (slaughterhouses),  municipal  buildings,  public  parks,  parking  spaces,\nand other structures.\n\n\f13\n\n46.\nPart  B  -  ICBP,  has  four  components:  (i)  project  management  support,  (ii)  subproject\npreparation  and  implementation  support,  (iii)  LGUs\u2018  capacity-building  program,  and  (iv)\ninstitutional strengthening of DILG in Mindanao. The ICBP will be implemented by DILG through\nthe Project Development Office (PDO) with the assistance of consultants. The components are\ndescribed below. Outline terms of reference for the proposed ICBP are in Appendix 5.\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv)\n\nProject management support: assistance in project management and subproject\nimplementation,  including  start-up  activities,  detailed  implementation  schedules,\nbudgets,  report  formats,  establishment  of  project  implementation  units  (PIUs),\nprocurement  packages,  progress  reports,  completion  reports,  overall  project\nperformance monitoring system (PPMS), and resolution of issues.\n\nSubproject  preparation  and  implementation  support:  assistance  to  participating\nLGUs,  including  subproject  preparation,  feasibility  studies,  preparing  subproject\nappraisal  reports  (SPARs),  bid  documents,  and  procurement.  The  support  will\ntake the form of on-the-job training for PIU staff in the LGUs concerned by a local\nexpert  pool  of  organizations  or  consultant  teams.  LBP  lending  centers  in\nMindanao will conduct joint appraisal as part of on-the-job training. PIUs will also\nbe assisted in preparing project completion reports for each subproject, covering\nits physical and institutional aspects.\n\nLGU  capacity-building  program:  assistance  to  LGUs  in  land  use  planning  and\nfinancial  management.  Fund  mobilization,  budgeting,  and  cash  management  of\nthe LGUs will be reviewed, and strategic actions will be recommended to improve\nbudget  preparation,  resource  mobilization,  collection  efficiency,  and  financial\nto\nrecords  management.  Financial  strategic  planning  will  be \ncomprehensive  land  use  planning  to  enhance  local  revenues  from  property\ntaxation.  While  preparing  land  use  plans,  local  government  officials  will  receive\non-the-job  training  in  how  to  reflect  strategic  development  planning,  capital\ninvestment  programming,  and  financial  resource  mobilization  in  a  timely  and\norderly manner. Knowledge transfer will be emphasized to sustain coherent and\neffective development planning skills.\n\nlinked \n\ntool \n\nDILG  institutional  strengthening  program:  assistance  to  DILG  in  developing  a\nself-assessment \nfor  measuring  LGUs\u2019  administration  capacities,  and\nmunicipal  infrastructure  and  service  delivery  performance.  Local  authorities  will\nbe provided with a practical assessment tool for evaluating their service delivery,\nincluding  level  of  citizens  participation  in  governance,  adequacy  of  municipal\nservice  delivery,  budget  allocation,  personnel  administration,  and  revenue\ngeneration. Participating LGUs will apply the tools, identify service improvement\nareas, and determine the extent of improvements achieved. The assessment tool\nwill  be  tested  and  refined  during  project  implementation.  The  regional  office  of\nDILG and its attached training agencies such as the Local Government Academy\nwill be trained to administer, apply, and disseminate this assessment tool among\nurban LGUs in Mindanao, aiming for nationwide application for long-term sector\ndevelopment.\n\nC.\n\nCost Estimates\n\nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $60.0 million equivalent, including physical\n47.\nand price contingencies, interest and other charges during construction, fees, taxes, and duties.\nOf the total cost, about $27.6 million equivalent (46 percent) is in foreign exchange and $32.4\nmillion  equivalent  (54  percent)  is  in  local  currency.  The  foreign  exchange  costs  include  $1.3\n\n\fmillion  interest  and  other  charges  during  construction  and  front-end  fees.  Cost  estimates  are\nsummarized in Table 1 and detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 6.\n\n14\n\nTable 1:  Cost Estimates\n($ million)a\n\n   Foreign\nExchangeb\n\n   Local\nCurrency\n\n    Total\n    Cost\n\nItem\nA.

The  core  pilot  LGUs  were  selected\nfrom different classes of cities and municipalities across the provinces of Mindanao, to assess\ntheir  borrowing  capacities  and  infrastructure  investment  needs.  The  proposed  Project  will\ninvolve  about  40  LGUs  at  an  average  investment  of  $1.3  million  for  two  components  per\nsubproject  LGU.33  Investment  demand  by  subsector  was  estimated  based  on  the  percentage\ndistribution of subsector costs from the 13 indicative LGUs. It is expected that about 23 percent\nof infrastructure investment demand will be in the subsector local roads and bridges; 6 percent\nin sanitation drainage and flood control; 14 percent in solid waste management; 12 percent in\nwater  supply;  27  percent  in  public  market  and  bus  terminals;  while  about  18  percent  of  the\ninfrastructure investment would be in other public facilities.\n\n                                                \n\n32  They are Parang (ARMM), Dipolog (Region IX), Kidapawan (Region XII), Tangub (Region X), Panabo (Region XI),\nSurigao (Region CARAGA), Zamboanga (Region IX), Valencia (Region X), Samal (Region XI), Koronadal (Region\nXI),  Tubod  (Region  XII),  Cotabato  (Region  XII),  and  Linga  (Region  CARAGA).  The  first  three  are  the  core  pilot\nLGUs.\n\n33  An  eligible  LGU,  as  a  subborrower,  will  prepare  a  subproject.  LBP  will  execute  a  subloan  agreement  for  a\n\nsubproject with the LGU. The subloan agreement for a subproject may contain more than one component.\n\n\fD.\n\nFinancing Plan\n\n15\n\n49.\nThe financing plan for the Project is summarized in Table 2, and details are in Appendix\n6.  The  ADB  loan  will  finance  50  percent34  of  the  total  Project  cost.  LBP  will  receive  a  loan  of\n$30.0 million equivalent, including $1.3 million in interest and other charges during construction\nand 1 percent front-end fee, for infrastructure investment finance. The proposed ADB loan will\nfinance  $24.6  million  (82  percent)  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $5.4  million  (18  percent)\nequivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  NDF  has  agreed  to  provide  the  Government  of  the\nPhilippines  parallel  cofinancing  of  $6.0  million  equivalent,  including  $3.0  million  in  foreign\nexchange costs. The Republic of the Philippines is the Borrower of NDF credit, and DILG is the\nEA for the part financed by NDF.35 LBP will provide $9.4 million equivalent from its own funds36.\nThe  participating  LGUs  will  provide  from  their  own  funds  the  equivalent  of  $7.3  million,\nrepresenting 12 percent of the total project cost, or 14 percent of the infrastructure investment.\nThe  national  Government  through  DILG  will  finance  the  remaining  balance  of  $7.3  million\nequivalent as grants to LGUs.\n\nTable 2:  Financing Plan\n($ million)\n Foreign\nExchange\n\n   Local\nCurrency\n\n    24.6\n3.0\n    27.6\n\n5.4\n3.0\n8.4\n\n Total\n  Cost\n\n  30.0\n    6.0\n  36.0\n\nPercent\n\n50\n10\n\nSource\nA.

The loan will have an 18-year term, including a\ngrace  period  of  4  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based\nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum, a front-end fee of 1.0 percent,\nconversion  options  that  may  be  exercised  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  draft  Loan\nAgreement,  the  Loan  Regulations,  ADB\u2019s  Conversion  Guidelines,  and  such  other  terms  and\nconditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. The Government and LBP have provided ADB\nwith (i) the reasons for LBP\u2019s decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on\nthe  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  the\nLBP\u2019s  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any  communication  or  advice\n\n                                                \n\n34  The  Project  was  prepared  substantially  during  1999  and  2000,  envisioning  complete  processing  by  2000.\nTherefore, it is proposed that the cost-sharing limit applicable to the Republic of the Philippines in year 2000, i.e,\n50 percent, be applied to this project.\n\n35  As one of the conditions for ADB loan negotiation, the Credit Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines\nand  NDF  was  executed  on  terms  and  conditions  satisfactory  to  ADB,  and  all  conditions  precedent  to    its\neffectiveness were fulfilled.\n\n36  Generated from the money market and deposits.\n\n\f16\n\nfrom  ADB.  NDF\u2019s  credit  carries  no  interest  and  has  a  40-year  maturity,  including  a  10-year\ngrace  period,  but  has  a  0.75  percent  charge  on  the  disbursed  amount  and  a  0.5  percent\ncommitment  fee  on  the  undisbursed  amount.  LBP  subloans  to  LGUs  will  have  a  fixed  interest\nrate, with a maximum maturity of 15 years, including a  3-year grace period, coinciding with the\nprevailing terms used by the Government for LGU financing. LBP will reflect ADB\u2019s lending rate\nat  the  time  of  subloan  drawdown  to  minimize  the  interest  rate  risk.  The  Republic  of  the\nPhilippines will guarantee the proposed loan to LBP at 1 percent fee annually and will cover the\nforeign exchange risk at a yearly fee of 4 percent.\n\nThe financing mix for part A is based on the use of (i) loan proceeds, (ii) LBP funds, (iii)\n51.\nDILG  grants,  and  (iv)  LGUs\u2019  counterpart  funds  to  finance  the  cost  of  the  subprojects.  The\nparticipating LGU will use its own counterpart funds for activities such as preparing the detailed\nengineering  design,  acquiring  land,  and  other  preparatory  actions.  On  average,  about  14\npercent of a component cost is expected to be financed from LGU\u2019s own fund, 18 percent from\nLBP resources, 56 percent from ADB loan proceeds, and the remaining balance of 12 percent\nfrom the DILG Government grant.\n\n52.\nTo  encourage  the  development  of  Mindanao  Urban  LGUs,  the  proposed  Project\nprovides  grants.  More  incentives  to  participate  will  be  given  to  lower-income  than  to  higher-\nincome  LGUs  by  providing  a  high  level  of  grant  financing.  Also,  nonrevenue-generating\ncomponents will receive a grant 5 percent higher  than that for revenue-generating components.\nThe  cost-sharing arrangements are given in Table 3. DILG grants will be channeled mainly  to\nlow-income  LGUs.  LGUs  in  classes  III-VI  may  receive  grants  up  to  25  percent  of  the  cost  of\nnonrevenue-generating  components  and  up  to  20  percent  of  the  cost  of  revenue-generating\ncomponents.  Upon  receiving  proof  that  funds  from  all  other  sources  have  been  committed,\nDILG, using the government depository bank (LBP), will disburse the grants to the LGUs. The\nflow of grant funds is presented in Appendix 7.\n\nTable 3: Cost- Sharing Arrangements\n\nLGU Class and\nComponent Type\nHigh-Income LGUs (Class I  to II)\nRevenue-Generating\nNonrevenue-Generating\n\nLow-Income LGUs (Class III to VI)\nRevenue-Generating\nNonrevenue-Generating\n\nRelending\n(ADB: 75 %\nLBP : 25 %)\n\nGovernment\nGrant\n(%)\n\nLGU\nEquity\n(%)\n\n80\n75\n\n70\n65\n\n0\n5\n\n20\n25\n\n20\n20\n\n10\n10\n\nTotal\nCost\n(%)\n\n100\n100\n\n100\n100\n\n53.\nThe  proceeds  of  ADB\u2019s  loan  to  LBP  will  be  relent  to  LGUs  through  subsidiary  loan\nagreements,  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The  relending  rate  will  be  fixed  for  the  term  of  the  subloans\nfunded  by  ADB,  and  will  be  set  at  the  time  of  subloan  drawdown  on  the  basis  of  the  sum  of\nADB\u2019s prevailing interest rate, foreign exchange risk premium (4 percent), and guarantee fee (1\npercent); and LBP\u2019s spread (2 percent up to 5 percent maximum based on LGU\u2019s credit rating).\nThe relending rate for subloans funded by LBP\u2019s internal funds will be at the market rate subject\nto repricing.37 The Government grant from DILG to LGUs will be established through subproject\nagreements.\n\n                                                \n\n37  Based on the 91-day T-bill rate, plus LBP spread of 1.5 percent.\n\n\f17\n\nE.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nProject Organization and Management\n\nAppendix  8  gives  the  organization  chart  for  project  implementation.  The  major\n\n54.\nresponsibilities and roles of the participating agencies and organizations are outlined below.\n\n55.\nLBP, the EA for part A, will relend to LGUs who will implement the physical investment.\nDILG, the EA for part B, will facilitate and monitor project implementation and oversee capacity\nbuilding. As joint EAs, LBP and DILG will coordinate the activities through the Technical Review\nand Coordinating Committee (TRCC). Each LGU will set up a PIU. PIUs for the three core pilot\nLGUs have already been established.\n\nA  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  comprising  senior  officials  or  designated\n56.\nrepresentatives  from  LBP,  DILG,  and  other  government  agencies38  has  been  established  to\nprovide  overall  guidance  to  the  Project  and  address  policy  issues.  The  PSC  is  chaired  by  the\nsecretary of DILG (or his designated representative) and will meet quarterly. A TRCC chaired by\nthe  Executive  Vice-President  of  LBP  (or  his  designated  representative)  and  comprising  senior\nofficials from LBP, DILG, and other government agencies39 has also been created to coordinate\nproject implementation on a monthly basis. The regional DILG offices and LBP lending centers\nin Mindanao will assist in project dissemination and promotion, in coordination with LGUs. The\nProgram Management Department (PMD) under LBP is the secretariat of TRCC.\n\n57.\nLBP has established PMD to administer the LGU lending facility for part A, and assign a\nteam of qualified staff at the head office to establish the facility. A designated staff with suitable\nqualifications  will  coordinate  with  LBP  offices  in  Mindanao,  the  PDO  of  DILG,  and  PIUs  of\nparticipating  LGUs  to  (i)  appraise  subproject  feasibility  studies,  (ii)  prepare  Project-related\naccounting  and  auditing  activities,  and  (iii)  monitor  disbursements  for  the  infrastructure\ninvestment  component.  PMD,  in  coordination  with  the  lending  centers,  will  conduct  appraisal,\nand  TRCC  will  review  the  subproject  appraisal  for  the  proposed  components  against  the\neligibility criteria and endorse qualified subprojects.\n\n58.\nDILG has established PDO with a team of qualified staff, including a financial accountant\nat headquarters to manage part B and develop subprojects for part A. PDO will carry out day-to-\nday project management and coordination with LBP. It will (i) manage, coordinate, facilitate, and\nmonitor  overall  implementation;  (ii)  promote  project  awareness  and  prepare  feasibility  studies\nfor  the  subprojects;  (iii)  coordinate  and  prepare  Project-related  reports;  (iv)  assist  the\nparticipating  LGUs  in  recruiting  consultants  for  detailed  engineering  design;  and  (v)  hire  and\nsupervise  consultants  for  building  the  capacity  of  LGUs  and  strengthening  DILG.  Advisory\nconsultant  teams  will  be  divided  into  two  main  teams  to  support  PDO.  For  overall  project\nmanagement,  a  project  management  team  will  be  established  in  PDO,  while  a  subproject\npreparation and implementation support (SPIS) team will be located in DILG regional offices in\nMindanao.  The  project  management  team  will  coordinate  and  supervise  the  SPIS  team.  The\nSPIS  team  will  prepare  subproject  feasibility  studies;  promote,  facilitate,  and  develop\nsubprojects;  and  give  hands-on  assistance  to  LGUs,  particularly  those  from  the  low-income\nclasses, in preparing feasibility studies. The SPIS team is composed of DILG regional staff and\nconsultants, and will work closely with LGUs in Mindanao. The SPIS will coordinate with PDO\nand PIUs of the participating LGUs in the region.\n\n                                                \n\n38 At least assistant secretary level, from DBM, NEDA, DOF, DPWH, DENR, and HUDCC.\n39 NEDA, DOF, DBM, DPWH, DENR, and HUDCC will be represented in the TRCC to review and endorse to LBP\n\nsubprojects costing more than $2.5 million.\n\n\f18\n\n59.\nLGUs will be responsible for preparing and implementing all physical components. Each\nLGU will set up a PIU. Each LGU will appoint a suitably qualified full-time subproject manager to\ndirect the implementation of each subproject and to undertake reporting, benefit monitoring, and\nevaluation. A sufficient number of staff from the concerned LGUs will be assigned to the PIUs to\nimplement  their  subprojects  and  to  carry  out  procurement  and  construction  supervision.  With\nLGU  counterpart  funds,  the  PIUs  will  hire  a  team  of  domestic  consultants  for  detailed\nengineering  design.  The  domestic  consultants  will  prepare  engineering  drawings  and  bid\ndocuments, and assist in prequalifying contractors and evaluating bids, civil work contracts, and\nprocurement contracts; supervise contracts; and exercise quality control.\n\n60.\nTo ensure effective implementation of the capacity-building component, the Government\nwill guarantee the performance of obligations by the various government agencies according to\nthe  project  design.  For  this  purpose,  DILG  issued  a  Commitment  Letter,  which  was\nacknowledged  by  DOF,  as  a  representative  of  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines.  Further,  the\nRepublic  of  the  Philippines  will  enter  into  Guarantee  and  Project  Implementation  Agreements\nwith ADB. The Commitment Letter was executed, on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB,\nand included the following:\n\n(i)  DILG  will  assume  project  execution  and  implementation  functions  in\n\ncoordination with the Borrower,\n\n(ii)  DILG  will  contribute  $6  million  equivalent  for  grants  to  qualified  LGUs  and\n\n$1.3 million equivalent for the ICBP, and\n\n(iii) DILG will execute part B under the agreement between NDF and ADB.\n\n2.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n61.\nThe Project will be implemented over six years, starting in January 2002 and ending by\n31 December 2007 (Appendix 9). About 40 subprojects will be prepared in three batches over\nthe  first  2.5  years.  The  third  batch  of  subprojects  will  be  implemented  from  the  third  year\nonward. Given the small size of the investments, a subproject is expected to be implemented in\nabout three years.\n\n3.\n\nSubproject Application, Selection, Preparation, and Appraisal\n\n62.\nLGUs  participating  in  the  Project  will  (i)  be  urban  LGUs  with  a  population  of  at  least\n20,000,  (ii)  express  interest  in  and  commitment  to  the  Project,  and  (iii)  have  the  financial\ncapacity to comply with LBP\u2019s credit rating system. LGUs satisfying these initial eligibility criteria\nwill  submit  a  supporting  letter  from  their  LGU  council  to  PDO,  requesting  that  the  LGU  be\nallowed  to  participate  in  the  Project.  To  qualify  for  the  preparation  of  feasibility  studies,  LGUs\nwill (i) propose subprojects that have development potential and are consistent with the regional\nplan; (ii) propose subprojects for which there is demand, as substantiated by the local governing\nbody; (iii) have the technical, and administrative capacity to undertake capacity building; (iv) be\nendorsed  by  the  Regional  Development  Council  for  the  proposed  subprojects;  and  (v)  have\ncounterpart  funds  available  and  no  adverse  credit  background.  LGUs  with  readily  available\nfeasibility studies can apply directly to PMD. PMD will prepare SPARs, and the SPIS team will\nassist PMD in preparing SPARs as part of the institutional capacity-building program.\n\n63.\nThe  investment  components  will  be  identified  on  the  basis  of  needs  and  demands;\ntechnical, economic, and financial feasibility; and the LGU\u2019s financial and institutional capacity.\nThe criteria for appraising the subprojects will ensure that the needs of urban communities are\nidentified in the socioeconomic analysis and considered in prioritizing and designing investment\ncomponents. The detailed LGU eligibility selection criteria and subproject appraisal criteria are\npresented in Appendix 10.\n\n\f19\n\n64.\nThe results of the appraisal will be contained in the SPAR; for small subprojects (costing\nless than $0.5 million) the SPAR can be a summary report; for subprojects costing more than\n$0.5 million a full report will be prepared. TRCC will review the SPARs and endorse those that\nconform to the project design criteria and are within the financial capacity of the LGUs. LBP will\nreview  and  endorse  the  proposed  subloan.  DILG  will  review  and  endorse  the  proposed\nsubproject  for  grants.  The  first  three  subprojects  financed  under  the  loan  and  any  subproject\ncosting  more  than  $2.5  million  equivalent  will  require  ADB  approval  before  LBP  approves  the\nsubloan. It is estimated that about four (or about 10 percent) of the subprojects are expected to\ncost  above  $2.5  million.  Loan  review  missions  will  review  selected  subprojects  during\nimplementation.\n\n4.\n\nDetailed Engineering Design and Construction Supervision\n\nDetailed  engineering  design  and  construction  supervision  for  subprojects  will  be\n65.\nfinanced  by  the  counterpart  funds  of  the  LGUs  concerned.  Domestic  engineering  consulting\nfirms  will  be  hired  by  the  PIUs,  in  consultation  with  the  LGUs  concerned  and  PDO,  following\nprocedures acceptable to ADB. PDO will finalize the shortlist and invite technical proposals from\nthe shortlisted firms. PIUs will evaluate the proposals, select firms, and enter into contracts for\nthe required services. PDO will provide overall guidance and technical support in preparing the\ndetailed engineering designs, and will evaluate the final designs for each physical component.\nFor  subprojects  costing  more  than  $2.5  million,  ADB  will  review  the  terms  of  reference,\nevaluation  criteria,  service  contracts,  and  evaluation  results  to  ensure  the  competence  and\nexperience of the selected consultant.\n\n5.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n66.\nFor  part A,  domestic consultants, to be financed by the counterpart funds of the  LGUs\nwill be recruited by each PIU for the LGU concerned following procedures acceptable to ADB.\nAll  consulting  services  under  part  B  will  be  financed  from  the  NDF  fund  with  a  counterpart\ncontribution from DILG. For part B, consultants will be selected and engaged of in accordance\nwith  the  general  procurement  guidelines  of  NDF,  with  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  terms  of  reference,\nevaluation  criteria,  evaluation  results,  selection  and  award  of  contract.  It  is  estimated  that  644\nperson-months  of  consulting  services  (130  international,  and  514  domestic)  will  be  required.\nConsultants will assist in implementing the Project (257 person-months) and provide support in\ninstitutional development and capacity building (387 person-months). The project management\nconsultants will assist in reviewing the design and contract documents, and will assist PDO in\nsubproject  development,  coordination,  monitoring,  and  evaluation,  and  in  the  financial  and\nenvironmental  aspects  of  overall  project  implementation.  The  subproject  preparation  and\nimplementation support consultants will work closely with PIUs in preparing subproject feasibility\nstudies, \ntechnical\nreviewing  detailed  engineering  designs,  preparing  supplementary \ndocumentation, assisting subproject managers, and preparing progress reports.\n\n67.\nADB  has  approved  advance  action  in  recruiting  consultants  and  preparing  detailed\nengineering designs and contract documents for the overall Project, starting with the pilot LGUs\nin Parang, Kidapawan, and Dipolog.\n\n6.\n\nAdvance Action\n\n7.\n\nProcurement\n\n68.\nGoods  and  services  financed  by  the  ADB  loan  will  be  procured  according  to  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement applicable to loans to development finance institutions for relending\nto  subborrowers.  As  loan  administrator,  LBP  must  satisfy  ADB  that  (i)  subborrowers  followed\n\n\f20\n\nprocurement procedures acceptable to ADB; (ii) goods and services financed with the subloan\nproceeds  were  purchased  at  a  reasonable  price,  considering  other  relevant  factors  such  as\ntiming  and  efficiency  of  delivery,  reliability  of  the  goods  and  their  suitability  for  the  subproject,\nand availability of maintenance and spare parts; and (iii) all goods and services financed under\nthe  loan  were  procured  from  ADB  member  countries.  LBP  will  require  subborrowers  to  follow\ninternational competitive bidding procedures for civil works contracts worth over $2 million and\nsupply  contracts  worth  over  $500,000,  and  where  the  interest  of  economy  and  efficiency\ndictates.  The  indicative  contract  packages  is  shown  in  Appendix  11.  To  promote  compliance\nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement,  LBP  and  DILG  project  managers  and  other  selected\nstaff will be trained and briefed on procurement as appropriate. Goods and services financed by\nNDF will be procured according to the general procurement guidelines of NDF.\n\n8.\n\nResettlement and Land Acquisition\n\n69.\nA resettlement plan for a core subproject was prepared by the pilot LGU assisted by the\nconsultants  (Appendix  12),  in  accordance  with  Government  procedures  and  ADB's  policy  on\ninvoluntary resettlement. The plan will be a model for other subprojects that involve involuntary\nresettlement, land acquisition, and removal of other private and public assets. The resettlement\nplan ensures the following:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nLGUs will be responsible for all land acquisition and ensure the timely acquisition\nor  availability  of  all  land  or  rights-of-way  required  for  subprojects  to  avoid\nunnecessary delays in construction.\n\nIf  a  subproject  component  requires  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  or  both,  the\nLGU  should  submit  the  resettlement  plan  for  ADB's  review  and  approval  to\nensure that it includes mitigating measures to restore or enhance the social and\neconomic  base  of  the  affected  persons.  An  initial  report  in  this  regard  will  be\nprepared at the time of subproject identification and updated at each succeeding\nstage of subproject preparation (feasibility study, detailed design).\n\nThe  Government,  through  DILG  and  DENR,  will  ensure  that  LGUs  require  all\ncontractors  to  restore  temporarily  acquired  land  to  a  condition  suitable  for  its\noriginal purpose.\n\nPDO  consultants  will  monitor  land  acquisition,  resettlement,  and  socioeconomic\nrehabilitation and reports for each subproject will be submitted to ADB before a\nsubloan can take effect. The results of the resettlement will be reported upon its\ncompletion and one year after that.\n\n9.\n\nDisbursement\n\nLoan proceeds will be disbursed according to procedures in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement\n70.\nHandbook, January 2001. To facilitate the disbursement of small expenditures under the loan to\nLBP,  the  latter  will  set  up  an  imprest  account  of  $2.0  million  exclusively  for  the  Project.  The\naccount  will  be  replenished  and  liquidated  on  the  basis  of  the  statement  of  expenditures\nprepared  by  LBP  lending  centers  in  Mindanao  and  consolidated  at  the  LBP  head  office.  The\nceiling  for  individual  payment  claims  in  the  statement  of  expenditure  is  $100,000  per\nexpenditure item. For force account works, LBP should use the reimbursement procedure, not\nthe statement of expenditure procedure. NDF will administer the disbursement of the NDF fund\nproceeds  to  DILG.  ADB\u2019s  Projects  department  will  be  notified  of  drawdown  requests  made  by\nDILG to NDF, and disbursement will require ADB\u2019s prior approval.\n\n\f10.\n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit\n\n21\n\n71.\nDILG,  LBP,  and  the  LGUs  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts  and  records  to\ndocument  the  funds  sources  and  expenditure  for  goods  and  services,  including  counterpart\nfunds provided in cash or in kind. DILG and LBP will (i) have the project accounts, records, and\nfinancial statements of PDO and PMD audited annually, according to sound auditing principles,\nby  auditors  whose  qualifications,  experience,  and  terms  of  reference  are  acceptable  to  ADB;\nand  (ii)  submit  to  ADB,  within  nine  months  from  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year,  a  copy  of  the\nauditor\u2019s  report  on  the  consolidated  project  accounts  and  financial  statements,  including  the\nauditor\u2019s  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  ADB  loan  proceeds,  compliance  with  financial  covenants,\nand provision of counterpart funds. The imprest account and statement of expenditure are also\nsubject to annual audit. The audit report should include a separate audit opinion on the use of\nthe  imprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditure.  LBP  will  submit  its  unaudited  financial\nstatements, provided by Mindanao lending centers of LBP,  to ADB within three months from the\nend of the fiscal year. In addition, DILG and LBP will jointly submit to ADB semiannual progress\nreports  on  project  implementation.  The  reports  will  cover  physical  performance,  summary\nprofiles  of  feasibility  studies,  summary  SPARs,  and  progress  made  in  the  DILG  capacity-\nbuilding  program.  Within  three  months  after  a  subproject  is  completed,  LBP  and  DILG  will\nprepare  and  submit  to  ADB  a  subproject  completion  report  for  each  LGU,  summarizing  the\noverall  status  of  subproject  implementation  and  operational  performance.  Within  six  months\nafter the end of the Project, DILG and LBP will prepare and submit to ADB a completion report\nsummarizing the overall status of project implementation, operational performance, the targets\nachieved under the Project, and PPMS.\n\n11.\n\nAnticorruption Measures\n\n72.\nThe  proposed  Project  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  and  guidelines.  EAs\nwill  ensure  the  timely  submission  of  audited  project  accounts.  Subprojects  will  be  selected,\ncomponents  approved,  and  goods  and  services  procured  according  to  the  agreed-upon\nguidelines and criteria.\n\n12.\n\nMidterm Review\n\nA midterm review will be carried out about three years after the ADB loan effectiveness\n73.\nto  enable  the  Government  and  LBP  to  make  the  needed  adjustments  in  project  design  and\nimplementation  arrangements.  The  review  will  cover  the  status  of  subproject  preparation  and\nimplementation, performance of consultants, subprojects in the pipeline, assistance to LGUs in\ninstitution and capacity building, and possible reallocation of loan proceeds.\n\n13.\n\nProject Performance Monitoring System\n\nEach  participating  LGU  will  implement  a  PPMS  for  each  completed  subproject  to\n74.\nevaluate  the  delivery  of  the  planned  facilities  and  the  benefits  accrued.  With  the  help  of\nconsultants,  PDO  will  develop  comprehensive  PPMS  procedures  and  plans  according  to  ADB\nguidelines.  The  PPMS  activities-establishing  benchmarks,  collecting  information,  monitoring\nbenefits,  and  evaluating  social  impact-will  be  undertaken  by  the  project  LGUs.  PDO  will\nconsolidate  data  and  prepare  a  PPMS  for  the  overall  Project.  The  first  set  of  data  will  be\ncollected within three months after the start of a subproject. The results will be included in the\nsubproject completion report to be prepared by LGUs and eventually in the project completion\nreport to be prepared jointly by DILG and LBP.\n\n\fF.\n\nExecuting and Implementing Agencies\n\n1.\n\nLand Bank of the Philippines\n\n22\n\n75.\nLBP  will  be  the  EA  for  part  A  of  the  Project.  LBP,  a  wholly  Government-owned\ndevelopment  finance  institution  established  in  1963,  has  built  up  relevant  capacity  for  LGU\nfinancing  while  implementing  five  ADB-supported  projects.40  Its  social  mission  is  to  promote\ncountryside  development.  It  has  been  a  major  contributor  to  rural  credit  delivery,  assisting  in\nimplementing  the  Comprehensive  Agrarian  Reform  Program.  This  mandate  was \nlater\nbroadened  to  include  universal  banking.  LBP  is  exempt  from  the  public  service  compensation\nsystem of the Government. 41\n\n76.\nLBP\u2019s total asset base increased by 5.56 percent to P210 billion, while its deposit base\nrose  by  7.0  percent  to  P152  billion  in  FY2000.  As  of  end-2000,  the  five  largest  sectors\ncomprising  LBP\u2019s  loan  portfolio  were  farmers  and  fisherfolk  cooperatives,  P12.5  billion;  small\nand  medium-scale  enterprises,  P11.4  billion;  government-owned  and  controlled  corporations\nand  government  agencies,  P19.7  billion;  LGUs,  P7.5  billion;  and  infrastructure  development,\nP9.4 billion. LBP is managed by a board of nine directors comprising the secretary of finance,\nLBP president, and secretaries of agrarian reform, agriculture, and labor. As of 2001, LBP has a\nstaff of 8,466 nationwide, and has 38 branches, 1,000 personnel and 10 area-lending centers in\nMindanao. LBP is now one of the top five banks in the Philippines. LBP is the most active GFI in\nLGU  lending,  as  reflected  by  a  negligible  past-due  rate.  Its  outstanding  loan  portfolio  of  P7.5\nbillion benefits 281 LGUs nationwide, primarily by meeting their infrastructure needs.\n\n77.\nIn  the  third  quarter  of  2000,  LBP  started  a  major  reorganization  and  its  management\nstructure  has  been  streamlined.  The  functions  of  the  local  government  financial  services  unit\nwere  distributed  as  follows;  implementation  and  credit  approval  processes  were  put  under  the\nagrarian  and  domestic  banking  sector,  while  the  product  development  responsibilities  were\ntransferred  to  the  financial  products  development  and  evaluation  group.  During  the  second\nquarter of 2001, PMD has been set up directly under the Executive Vice President of agrarian\nand domestic banking sector. The PMD will supervise the implementation of foreign and locally\nfunded projects and programs, among others. As the LGU financing functions were distributed\nand decentralized, lending centers throughout the country will undertake the financial appraisal\nof proposed subprojects and administer the LGU loans. The SPIS team from PDO will support\nstrengthening of staff expertise on subproject appraisal.\n\n78.\nLBP\u2019s  finances  were  affected  by  the  Asian  financial  crisis.  To  protect  its  asset  quality\nfrom the effects of the regionwide crisis, LBP since 1999 has provided provisions for bad loans\nmore  than  20  times  higher  than  the  precrisis  level.  As  a  result,  its  asset  quality  position  has\nimproved, and its loans-to-deposits ratio has declined from 87 percent in 1998 to 75 percent in\n2000, reflecting improvement of liquidity. These measures to achieve respectable asset quality\nand  liquidity  have,  however,  lowered  LBP\u2019s  profitability.  Return  on  assets  (ROA)  fell  from  1.2\npercent in 1997 to 0.6 percent in 1998, and was 0.3 percent at the end of 1999. By the end of\n2000,  ROA  was  around  0.2  percent.  While  its  agrarian  lending  also  constitutes  a  drag  on  its\n\n                                                \n\n40  Loan 1216-PHI: Small Farmers Credit Project; for $75.0 million, approved on 22 December 1992; Loan 1664-PHI:\nMetro Manila Air Quality Improvement (Air Pollution Control Facility); for $25.0 million, approved on 16 December\n1998; TA Loan 1729-PHI: LGU Private Infrastructure Project Development Facility; for $3.0 million, approved on\n20 December 1999; Loan 1163-PHI: Mt. Pinatubo Damage Rehabilitation Project, for $37.0 million, approved on\n23  April  1992;  and  Loan  1435-PHI(SF): Rural Microenterprise Credit Project,  for  $20.0  million,  approved  on  23\nApril 1996.\n\n41  Further  details  of  the  organization  and  financial  statements  of  LBP  are  in  Appendix  13  as  well  as  in\n\nSupplementary Appendix G.\n\n\f23\n\nprofitability,42  the  sudden  drop  in  ROA  during  1999  and  2000  is  not  necessarily  due  to  its\nagrarian  lending.  The  increase  in  its  provisions  for  bad  loans  during  1999  and  2000  is\nattributable to high levels of delinquency in its commercial lending. LBP provided an action plan\nfor  reducing  its  nonperforming  portfolio  and  improving  its  profitability  by  restructuring\nnonperforming loans and injecting more capital. Due diligence result indicates LBP\u2019s projected\nROA for 2001 will be 0.6 percent, under the action plan provided by LBP. However, it was not\nfeasible  for  LBP  to  comply  with  the  financial  covenant  for  TA  Loan  1729-PHI  (footnote  22)  in\n2000, in which the minimum ROA is set at 0.55 percent for 2000. The financial covenants under\nits existing loans with ADB (i.e., the LGU Private Infrastructure Project Development Facility, the\nAir  Pollution  Control  Facility,  and  the  Small  Farmers  Credit  Project  [footnote  40])  need  to  be\namended to correspond to the proposed financial covenants under this Project [para. 106 (v)].\n\n79.\nTo ensure the financial viability of the LBP loan and sound financial management, it has\nbeen  agreed  that  LBP  will  maintain  a  capital  adequacy  ratio  of  10  percent  as  required  by  the\ncentral  bank  of  the  Philippines,  and  provide  solid  provisioning  to  safeguard  its  asset  quality\nposition.  The  current  financial  status  of  LBP  and  the  agreed-upon  summary  action  plan  are\ndiscussed in Appendix 13.\n\n2.\n\nDepartment of the Interior and Local Government\n\n80.\nDILG  will  be  the  EA  for  part  B  of  the  Project.  DILG  is  the  line  department  of  the\nGovernment  that  is  responsible  for  developing  the  capability  of  local  governments  to  deliver\neffective basic services. Aside from its regional and field offices, DILG has an Office of Project\nDevelopment  Services,  which  develops  and  monitors  foreign-assisted  projects  and  programs.\nDILG is now implementing three ADB-funded projects,43 and is gaining valuable lessons in the\nprocess.  Consulting  assistance  in  project  management  will  help  DILG  to  satisfactorily  perform\nits implementation functions and roles. The Government recently proposed further amendments\nin  the  LGC  provisions,  strengthening  the  fiscal  capacities  and  powers  devolved  to  LGUs.  The\ninstitutional and capacity-building approach of the proposed Project will support the Government\npolicy of enabling urban sector institutions to perform better and in a sustainable manner.\n\n3.\n\nLocal Government Units\n\nAs  implementing  agency,  a  participating  LGU  will  establish  a  PIU  for  subproject\n81.\nimplementation.  The  LGC  of  1991  represented  a  major  shift  in  public  administration  by\ndevolving  to  LGUs  various  functions  previously  carried  out  by  the  national  Government  and\nempowering them to operate with a greater degree of autonomy. LGUs now have the primary\nresponsibility for guiding, financing, and managing urban development. Although the experience\nand  capacity  of  individual  LGUs  in  carrying  out  the  devolved  functions  are  varied,  it  is\nreasonable  to  say  that  over  the  years  all  LGUs  have  gained  some  experience  in  planning,\nimplementing,  and  managing  investments.  LGUs  organizational  structure  and  staffing  patterns\nare  also  varied,  depending  on  the  class  and  size  of  its  revenues44  (some  lower-class\nmunicipalities have only a staff of 60 while some first class cities have over 1,300). PIUs will be\n\n                                                \n\n42 Without the mandated Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program expenses, LBP would have registered an ROA of\n\n1.1 percent, which is on par with the average for its peer banks in the Philippines.\n\n43 Footnotes 16, 17, and 18.\n44  According  to  a  Civil  Service  Commission  (CSC)  Memorandum,  every  LGU  will  design  and  implement  its  own\nstructure  and  staffing,  considering  its  service  requirements  and  financial  capability,  subject  to  the  minimum\nstandards  and  guidelines  prescribed  by  CSC.  The  guidelines  set  the  limit  to  staff  by  imposing  a  staff  salaries\nbudget ceiling of 45 percent (for LGUs income class IV to VI ), and 55 percent (for LGUs income class IV to VI) of\nthe revenue in the preceding fiscal year. Maintenance and other operational expenses generally account for about\n25-35 percent of local expenditures.\n\n\f24\n\nestablished  under  each  LGU\u2019s  city  planning  and  development  office  to  be  responsible  for  the\ndesigning  and  implementing  the  LGUs  subproject.  PDO  will  provide  technical  assistance  and\nadvise  implementation  of  subprojects.  The  Project  will  further  improve  the  participating  LGUs\ncapacity to guide the development process, and plan and implement investments.\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironmental Considerations\n\nAn  initial  environmental  examination  was  undertaken  for  core  pilot  subprojects.  The\n82.\nGovernment  has  adequate  laws  and  institutional  framework  for  environmental  screening  and\nmonitoring  of  subprojects  of  the  size  and  complexity  to  be  undertaken  under  the  Project.\nEnvironmental  impact  assessment  (EIA;  the  Government  uses  the  term  environmental  impact\nstatement)  will  be  prepared  for  subprojects  as  required  by  the  Government\u2019s  EIA  procedures\nand  by  ADB\u2019s  environmental  policies  and  procedures.  After  the  Environmental  Management\nBureau  of  DENR  approves  the  initial  environmental  examination  or  EIA,  the  summary  reports\nwill  be  sent  to  ADB  for  approval.  Disbursements  for  the  subprojects  will  be  contingent  on  the\nissuance of an environmental compliance certificate by the Government and clearance by ADB.\nMitigating  measures,  design  changes,  or  monitoring  systems  required  in  answer  to  conditions\nstated in the environmental compliance certificate will be incorporated in the detailed design and\nimplementation  of \nfor\nthe  subproject.  An  environmental  assessment \nparticipating  LGUs  will  enable  them  to  properly  carry  out  environmental  assessment  and\nmonitoring for the subprojects. The Government has agreed to include appropriate measures in\nthe  design  of  each  subproject  to  address  environmental  concerns  during  construction  and\noperation. The cost of preparing an initial environmental examination or EIA will be covered by\nthe LGU.\n\ntraining  seminar \n\n2.\n\nSocial Considerations and Community Participation\n\nA  social  analysis  was  undertaken  for  core  subprojects.  Direct  views  of  the  community\n83.\nconcerned  were  obtained  and  reflected  in  subprojects  formulation.  For  participating  LGUs,\nsocial  assessment  and  analysis  will  be  conducted  following  Government  policy  and  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines  for  Incorporation  of  Social  Dimensions  in  Bank  Operations  (1994).  Subproject\ncomponents will be selected and prioritized by LGUs in a participatory manner involving as wide\na cross section of the community as possible. For a subproject that affects an ethnic minority or\nindigenous  people  adversely  and  significantly,  an  indigenous  people  development  plan\nacceptable to ADB will be prepared and submitted for ADB\u2019s review.\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA.\n\nGeneral\n\n84.\nThe Project will improve access to municipal services, quality of life, and environmental\nstandards for about 2 million people living in 40 LGUs, including about 0.8 million urban poor.\nThe extent of the benefit will depend on the type of investment. Aside from improvements in the\nphysical urban infrastructure, the technical, operational, and financial management capacity of\nLGUs will be strengthened through the institutional development and capacity-building program.\n\n\f25\n\n85.\nFeasibility studies were made for five components in three core pilot LGUs during project\nformulation45:  (i)  The  proposed  water  supply  system  (Parang)  comprises  upgrading  water\nsources,  providing  new  transmission  mains,  constructing  pumping  stations,  improving  an\nexisting  treatment  plant,  building  new  water  storage,  and  a  distribution  system  for  house\nconnections. The proposed system is expected to cover 26,800 people in six communities. (ii) In\nDipolog, foreshore development includes a 340-meter-long sea protection wall and 1.4 hectares\nof  serviced  land  for  commercial  use  and  public  roads,  drainage,  and  park  facilities.  (iii)  The\nbypass roads in Dipolog are to widen and upgrade existing access roads to the southern part of\nthe  urban  area,  a  total  of  2.5  kilometers.  Kidapawan  proposed  to  build  (iv)  additional  bus\nterminals to accommodate 200 buses a day for the increased traffic in the town, and (v) a solid\nwaste management facility, including sanitary landfill site and improved collection system.\n\nB.\n\nEconomic and Financial Analyses\n\n1. \n\nApproach\n\n86.\nEconomic internal rates of return (EIRRs) were computed for all components. Cash flow\nprojections and financial internal rates of return (FIRRs) were calculated for revenue-generating\ncomponents for which costs are expected to be recovered directly from user charges, fees, and\ntariffs.  A  sensitivity  analysis  was  also  done.  The  domestic  price  numeraire  was  used  in  the\neconomic evaluation because project outputs are mainly nontradable. For valuation of tradable\ngoods,  a  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  of  1.22,  based  on  the  standard  conversion  factor  of\n0.837, was used. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.7 was applied to the wage of unskilled labor at\nthe domestic price level.\n\nThe financial evaluation of revenue-generating components examined the degree of cost\n87.\nrecovery  from  the  investments  and,  hence,  the  financial  sustainability  of  those  investments.\nCapital expenditures (land, civil works, equipment, detailed engineering design and construction\nsupervision,  and  resettlement  costs)  were  assumed  to  coincide  with  the  life  cycle  costs  and\nrevenues  of  the  subproject.  Revenues  were  estimated  on  the  basis  of  the  proposed  user\ncharges for the new and improved facilities. In principle, user charges were set at a level that\nwould  cover  all  operation  and  maintenance  costs  plus  the  financial  costs  of  the  project\ncomponent.  Prices  (tariffs)  are  expected  to  increase  over  time  to  keep  up  with  rising  costs\n(inflation) and allow the proper operation of the proposed facilities over the life of the asset.\n\n2.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\nThe water supply components in Parang will generate economic benefits in terms of (i)\n88.\nunmet  demand  for  piped  water  supply  services  in  the  municipality  concerned,  and  (ii)\nincremental water consumption by new water users. The least-cost analysis demonstrated the\nsubstantial  benefits  to  the  municipality  from  lower  water  costs.  Many  people  in  the  subproject\narea now buy water at exorbitant rates from private water vendors or draw water from their own\ndeep  wells,  which  are  often  unhygienic.  The  poor  in  particular  will  directly  benefit  from  these\ncomponents.\n\nEconomic  benefits  from  the  foreshore  development  component  are  improved  living\n89.\nconditions,  employment  opportunities,  and  environmental  sanitation  of  the  foreshore  area.\nFinancial  benefits  and  costs  were  adjusted  for  their  shadow  values.  The  high  EIRR  of  the\nproposed  foreshore  development  in  Dipolog  is  due  mainly  to  the  relatively  low  project  costs.\n\n                                                \n\n45 Summaries of subproject appraisals are in Supplementary Appendixes A, B, and C.\n\n\f26\n\nHowever,  the  resettlement  program  in  Dipolog  will  maximize  the  economic  benefits  from  this\ncomponent.\n\n90.\nFor the bypass road component, vehicle operating cost savings for direct potential road\nusers,  including  reduced  maintenance  costs  and  savings  in  travel  time  for  passengers  and\ngoods,  were  considered.  For  the  bus  terminal,  users\u2019  willingness  to  pay  for  improved  bus\nterminal and stalls was considered in estimating economic benefits.\n\n91.\nThe major indicators of the economic viability of the core subprojects are summarized in\nAppendix 14. All the components are economically viable. The base EIRRs of 14-38 percent are\nhigher than the economic opportunity cost of capital (12 percent). When subjected to sensitivity\nanalysis,  the  EIRRs  were  generally  robust,  while  those  for  the  bus  terminal  were  sensitive  to\nchanges in both cost and benefits.\n\n3.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\n92.\nFor upgraded services, the full cost will be charged, but within the level that consumers\nare  willing  to  pay.46  User  charges  for  the  terminal  in  Kidapawan  will  be  raised  substantially  to\nmake the project viable.\n\n93.\nFor  the  water  supply  components,  water  tariffs  were  analyzed  in  view  of  the  results  of\nthe socioeconomic survey. For example, residential consumers in Parang now pay an average\nof  P60  per  cubic  meter  for  water  from  water  vendors.  Once  the  improved  water  system  is  in\nplace,  they  would  pay  P12  per  cubic  meter.  At  these  tariff  levels,  households  could  increase\ntheir consumption of water to over 120 liters per person per day on the average, with significant\nhealth  and  economic  benefits,  while  still  keeping  within  the  current  level  of  affordability.  For\nforeshore development, the financial analysis focused on the city\u2019s options of leasing or selling\nthe developed area for commercial use.\n\nAll components are expected to meet all operating costs, including debt servicing, after\n94.\nthey start operations. Financial analysis shows that they will be financially viable. The FIRRs of\n13-30  percent  exceed  the  weighted  average  financial  cost  of  capital  for  relending  (about  6\npercent in constant term). When subjected to sensitivity analysis, the FIRRs were generally still\nrobust, except in the case of bus terminals, and at a level with the weighted average financial\ncost of capital. The financial evaluation is summarized in Appendix 14.\n\n4.\n\nLGUs\u2019 Borrowing Capacity\n\n95.\nThe  financial  statements,  balance  sheets,  and  revenue  and  expenditure  forecasts  of\nthree  pilot  LGUs  were  examined  during  project  preparation  to  gauge  their  financial  capability.\nLGUs, particularly municipalities, derive their revenues principally from the IRA and secondarily\nfrom local sources. Each year over the last five years, the IRA and locally generated revenues\nachieved average real growth rates of 11 percent and 10 percent, respectively.\n\n96.\nThe past performance of the LGUs would seem to support a 10 percent yearly increase\nin real prices in IRA and local revenue taxes, and a 5 percent yearly increase in real prices in\nnontax revenues. The cash flow projections indicate that for the proposed  investments, all three\nLGUs  have  the  capacity  to  borrow  for  the  proposed  investments,  up  to  20  percent  of  their\nregular  income,  as  required  by  LGC.  The  projected  financial  statements  for  2001\u20132015\n\n                                                \n\n46  Socioeconomic  household  surveys  in  the  subproject  areas  ascertained  affordability  and  willingness  to  pay  for\n\nrevenue-generating components.\n\n\f(Appendix 14) also indicate improvements in the financial condition of LGUs over the medium\nterm.\n\n27\n\nC.\n\nImpact on Poverty\n\nPoverty  incidence  in  urban  Mindanao  is  at  least  15  percent  higher  than  the  national\n97.\naverage. The Project is designed to reduce regional development gap, and to promote equitable\ngrowth  of  Mindanao  by  targeting  urban  LGUs.  Attention  has  been  given  to  improve  the  living\nconditions  of  the  poor  and  in  the  LGUs  with  limited  local  resources.  Improving  urban\ninfrastructure and related services will not only enhance the productivity of urban economy but\nalso  benefit  the  poor  by  improving  their  living  standards,  and  by  providing  employment\nopportunities. Improvement of roads, bridges, or public markets that everybody can access will\ngenerally enhance the productivity of urban economic activities. A positive distributional effect to\nthe  urban  poor  is  expected.  The  urban  poor  will  also  benefit  directly  from  a  number  of\nsubprojects. For example, civil works of subprojects will hire unskilled laborers for construction,\nand  provide  employment  and  income-earning  opportunities  for  the  poor;  or  the  water  supply\nproject  will  substantially  bring  down  household  expenses  spent  for  water  vendors  as  well  as\ntime spent in fetching water, resulting in real income savings for the poor.\n\n98.\nUnder the sector approach, about 40 LGUs (or about 2 million population) are expected\nto  receive benefits of the Project. More than 40 percent of beneficiaries fall below the poverty\nline.  It  is  expected  that  about  0.8  million  beneficiaries  will  be  the  urban  poor.  However,  the\ndistributional  impact  on  poverty  will  vary  depending  on  the  numbers  and  investment  size  of\nsubproject  components  across  subsectors.  Overall,  the  increased  employment  and  income-\nearning opportunities during project implementation will be one of the substantial benefits to the\npoor.  It  is  estimated  that  about  100,000  person-months  of  employment  opportunities  will  be\ngenerated.  Analysis  of  the  socioeconomic  survey  demonstrates  wide  distribution  of  benefits\nfrom the subprojects throughout the project areas. The Project impact on poverty is presented in\nAppendix 15.\n\n99.\nHowever,  ensuring  equitable  access  of  the  urban  poor  communities  to  improved\nservices  is  a  major  social  challenge.  To  address  this,  the  proposed  Project  includes  direct\nintervention and indirect incentive mechanisms to bring urban services for the poor. For direct\nintervention, subprojects are required to adopt direct participation and representation of the poor\nthrough  a  community  participatory  planning  approach  when  the  LGU  prioritizes  investment\nneeds.  Indirect  incentive  mechanism  is  included  as  up  to  25  percent  of  grant  financing  for  a\ncomponent  such  as  sanitation,  drainage,  and  flood  protection  measures,  from  which  the  poor\nliving  in  flood-prone  areas  will  benefit  significantly.  The  grant  financing  from  the  Government\nprovides  incentives  for  low-income  LGUs  to  invest  in  a  nonrevenue-generating  component  for\npositive environmental and distributional benefits from infrastructure services.\n\nD.\n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n100. Appendix 15 outlines social impact assessment. The proposed Project provides for basic\ninfrastructure  such  as  roads,  markets,  water  supply,  drainage  or  other  social  infrastructure\nservices  to  support  the  overall  level  of  economic  and  social  well  being.  The  levels  of\ninfrastructure services in the targeted LGUs are lower than the National average. Therefore, the\nProject serves both short- and long-term development needs. In addition, the proposed Project\nwill  have  a  direct  as  well  as  an  indirect  impact  on  employment  and  income  generation.  The\nconstruction  of  most  of  the  basic  urban  infrastructure  and  services  will  be  labor-intensive  and\nwill require low-skilled workers who can come from the ranks of the urban poor. Bus terminals\nand  roads  will  improve  access  to  economic  centers  in  towns  with  public  markets  and\nslaughterhouses.\n\n\f28\n\nImproving  the  provision  of  water  supply,  sanitation,  roads,  solid  waste  disposal,  and\n101.\nother  infrastructure  will  also  lead  to  better  health,  enhance  the  quality  of  life,  and  save  time.\nPeople living in communities that will be supplied with water facilities for the first time will spend\nless time transporting water. The time they save can be used in other activities. Women, who\ntogether with children suffer most from poor living conditions in urban areas, are not the specific\ntargets  of  the  Project,  but  they  will  benefit  from  improved  living  conditions  as  a  result  of\nimproved  infrastructure.  Gender  considerations  are  built  into  the  Project  to  equalize  access  to\nthe  benefits  from  poverty  reduction  and  employment  creation,  and  to  ensure  that  project\nplanning and implementation take the needs of the whole community into account.\n\nE.\n\nEnvironment\n\n102. Subprojects  will  have  a  positive  environmental  impact.  They  will  repair,  upgrade,  or\nreplace  failing  or  inadequate  infrastructure  and  public  facilities,  and  will  therefore  improve\nhealth,  quality  of  life,  sanitation,  and  environmental  conditions.  Five  components  in  three  pilot\ncore LGUs were selected for environmental assessment: (i) the Miputak-Torne bypass road and\nforeshore development in Dipolog, (ii) the water supply and distribution upgrade in Parang, and\n(iii)  bus  and  jeepney  terminal  and  solid  waste  disposal  facilities  in  Kidapawan.  Initial\nenvironmental  examinations,  prepared  for  each  of  the  subprojects  in  the  three  pilot  LGUs,47\nrevealed  that  none  of  the  pilot  subprojects  were  located  in  an  environmentally  sensitive  area,\nand any adverse environmental effects would be minor and easily mitigated.\n\nF.\n\nRisks\n\n103. Risks that could affect the overall success of the Project have been identified. The main\nrisk  comes  from  the  civil  strife  in  Mindanao.  The  Peace  Agreement  signed  in  1996  is  a\nsignificant  step  in  the  long  peace  process,  and  has  led  to  significantly  improved  peace  and\norder. However, sporadic conflicts still occur in the rural areas. The safety issue may therefore\nmake inspection of progress difficult in some of the subproject areas - as land travel through the\nrural area would be risky\u2013and, to some extent, affect project implementation.\n\n104. Other project risks include potential lack of interest among LGUs in participating in the\nProject;  lower  than  expected  LGU  financial  resources;  implementation  delays,  particularly  at\nstart-up, due to delay in creating PIUs, or in recruiting consultants; shortcomings in subproject\npreparation  and  appraisal  that  could  reduce  the  desired  socioeconomic  benefits;  lack  of\ncommitment to institutional development; and continued shortage of services for the poor. Also,\na  subproject  started  under  one  mayor  of  an  LGU  may  not  necessarily  be  completed  by  the\nsubsequent mayor.\n\n105.\nTo  minimize  these  risks,  the  design  and  implementation  arrangements  for  the  Project\nhave  the  following  features:  (i)  a  modest-size  Project  has  been  formulated  to  minimize  the\nfinancial  burden  on  the  national  Government  and  LGUs;  (ii)  a  consultant  recruited  directly  by\nDILG  with  NDF  finance  will  assist  in  starting  up  the  Project  and  setting  up  project\nimplementation units; (iii) advance action for hiring consultants is in place; (iv) to participate in\nthe  Project,  LGUs  must  contribute  equity  and  counterpart  funds  and  be  committed  to\ninstitutional  strengthening;  (v)  consultants  will  help  prepare  and  strengthen  subprojects;  (vi)\ncommunities  will  take  part  in  designing  subprojects;  and  (vii)  to  reduce  the  risks  of  political\n\n                                                \n\nAppendix K.\n\n47  The  results  of  the  initial  environmental  examinations  of  core  pilot  subprojects  are  in  Supplementary\n\n\fsuccession  in  a  given  LGU,  the  grant  financing  will  be  disbursed  at  the  last  stage  and  LGU\u2019s\nequity contribution will be required at the beginning stage of a given subproject.\n\n29\n\nA.\n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nVI.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government,  LBP,  and  DILG  have  given  the  following  specific  assurances,  in\n\n106.\naddition to the standard assurances that have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i) \n\nLGU  and  subproject  selection  criteria.  LBP  will  ensure  that  priority  is  given  to\nlower-income LGUs so that LGUs from classes III to VI are at least 20 percent of\nthose  that  qualify  for  subloan  financing.  LBP  will  also  see  to  it  that  LGUs  and\nsubprojects qualify for subloan financing by meeting the following screening and\nselection criteria.\n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nfor \n\nimprovements,  commitment \n\nAn  LGU  passes  the  initial  screening  if  it  has  a  population  of  at  least\n20,000; has no military conflict and is safe for construction; demonstrates\nfinancial capacity to borrow; and obtains a prime, high, or medium credit\nrating from LBP.\nTo  be  selected  for  subloan  financing,  an  LGU  must  have  deficiencies  in\ninfrastructure  and  demand \nthe\nproposed  subproject,  no  adverse  credit  background  with  LBP,  available\nequity  and  willingness  to  contribute  to  the  financing  of  the  proposed\nsubproject,  and  technical  and  administrative  capacity  to  undertake\ninstitutional capacity building and subproject management;\nA  subproject  qualifies  for  subloan  financing  if  it  is  endorsed  by  the\ndesignated  representative  of  a  qualified  LGU  following  a  process  of\nlaws,  and\nconsultation,  conforms \nprocedures, will not have significant adverse effects on the environment,\nand  demonstrates  cost-efficiency  and  a  degree  of \ntechnical\npreparedness.\n\nthe  relevant  government \n\nto  all \n\nto \n\nCounterpart funds. LBP and DILG will ensure that the counterpart funds needed\nfor project implementation are provided on time. To this end, LBP and DILG will\ntake  all  measures  necessary  or  appropriate  for  the  prompt  disbursement  of\nappropriated  funds  to  the  qualified  LGUs.  DILG  will  include  in  its  subproject\nagreements with LGUs that appropriate operation and maintenance costs will be\nallocated to ensure sustainability of the infrastructure services.\n\nSocial  considerations.  DILG  will  ensure  that  in  prioritizing  investments  and  in\nplanning  and  constructing  subprojects,  each  LGU  consults  with  community\nleaders  and  involves  community-based  organizations  and  informal  groups,\nincluding  representatives  from  poor  communities.  Each  LGU  will  also  develop\nand  implement  a  public  information  and  education  campaign  to  publicize  the\ninvestment program and encourage community-based organizations and informal\ngroups  to  participate.  For  a  subproject  that  affects  an  ethnic  minority  or\nindigenous  people  adversely  and  significantly,  an \nindigenous  people\ndevelopment plan acceptable to ADB must be prepared and submitted for ADB\u2019s\nreview.\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n\f30\n\n(iv) \n\nPerformance  measurement.  DILG  will  ensure  that  the  Local  Productivity  and\nPerformance  Measurement  Program  is  refined  and  further  strengthened  so  that\nappropriate  adjustments  can  be  made  and  can  be  pilot-tested  in  measuring  the\nperformance of the participating LGUs.\n\n(v) \n\nFinancial condition. LBP will ensure that it maintains\n\n(a) \n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\na capital adequacy ratio of not less than 10 percent for 2001;\na  minimum  return  on  assets  of  0.55  percent  in  2001,  after  expenses  for\nthe  Comprehensive  Agrarian  Reform  Program,  and  0.6  percent  for\nsubsequent years and later;\na  minimum  coverage  ratio  of  95  percent  of  the  cumulative  loan  loss\nreserves to past due loans to cover its past due accounts with respect to\nagrarian loans, and a minimum coverage ratio of at least 50 percent of its\ntotal past due loans; and\na loans-to-deposits ratio not exceeding 90 percent, and a minimum quasi-\nliquid ratio48 of 25 percent.\n\n(vi) \n\nEnvironmental  assurance.  The  Borrower  will  ensure  that  the  subprojects  will  be\ncarried out in accordance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations\nof  the  Government  and  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  policies  and  procedures.  A\ndetailed and summary EIA report or an initial environmental examination will be\nprepared  for  subprojects  as  applicable,  and  submitted  to  the  Government  for\napproval and to ADB for clearance. Disbursement for subloan agreements will be\nsubject to obtaining an environmental clearance certificate from the Government\nand  clearance  from  ADB.  The  Borrower  will  further  ensure  that  any  contractual\nagreements  entered  into  by  a  qualified  LGU  with  any  private  sector  entity  for\nundertaking a subproject will include legally binding commitments, satisfactory to\nADB, that the subproject concerned will be implemented in accordance with the\napplicable  environmental  laws  and  regulations  and  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental\npolicies and procedures.\n\n(vii)  Resettlement  and  land  acquisition.  LBP  and  the  Government  will  ensure  that\nsubprojects  involving  involuntary  resettlement,  land  acquisition,  or  removal  of\nother  private  and  public  assets  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  the\napplicable  laws  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement.  LBP  and  the\nGovernment  will  further  ensure  that,  with  respect  to  such  subprojects,  the\nqualified LGU (a) will prepare and submit a resettlement plan to ADB for review\nand  approval;  (b)  will  conduct  a  community  awareness  program  for  affected\npeople  in  relation  to  land  and  house  acquisition,  resettlement,  compensation\nlevels,  and  assistance  with  displacement;  and  (c)  will  be  responsible  for  the\ntimely  acquisition  or  availability  of  land  or  rights-of-way  required  for  the\nsubprojects.

To assess the project contribution to Mindanao\u2019s urban investment\nprogram,  the  urban  infrastructure  investments  of  the  cities/municipalities  in  Mindanao  were\nestimated  over  a  10-year  period  (2001-2010)  and  the  project  period  (2002-2007).  LGU  total\nrevenues  and  expenditure  on  capital  works  were  forecasted.  Table  A4.1  sets  out  the  1998\ninternal  revenue  allocation  (IRA)  to  Mindanao  cities  and  municipalities  along  with  the  locally\ngenerated  revenues.  Revenues  for  2001-2010  were  estimated  assuming  an  average  annual\nreal growth rate of 9 percent for IRA and local revenues. A review of the municipal finances of\nthe three pilot LGUs indicated an annual average real growth rate of 11 percent for IRA and 10\npercent for locally generated revenues over 1994-1999. Thus, the assumed 9 percent growth for\nIRA and locally generated income is slightly lower than recent experience for the pilot LGUs.\n\nTable A4.1: Forecast of Mindanao LGUs Revenuesa\n\n1998 Mindanao LGUs Revenues\n\nConstant 1998\n\nCities\nMunicipalities\n         Total\n\nRevenues Forecast b\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n                 Total (2001-2010)\n\n(million)\n\nTotal IRA\n\nP\n\n  5,765\n  5,748\n11,513\n\n14,910\n16,252\n17,714\n19,308\n21,046\n22,940\n25,005\n27,255\n29,708\n32,382\n 226,552\n\n$\n\n144\n144\n288\n\n373\n406\n443\n483\n526\n574\n625\n681\n743\n810\n   5,663\n\nLocal Income\n$\n\nP\n\nTotal\n\nP\n\n3,104\n3,095\n6,199\n\n  78\n  77\n155\n\n  8,870\n  8,843\n17,713\n\n8,028\n8,750\n9,538\n10,396\n11,332\n12,352\n13,464\n14,675\n15,996\n17,436\n 121,967\n\n201\n219\n238\n260\n283\n309\n337\n367\n400\n436\n   3,049\n\n22,938\n25,002\n27,252\n29,705\n32,378\n35,292\n38,469\n41,931\n45,705\n49,818\n 348,489\n\n$\n\n222\n221\n443\n\n573\n625\n681\n743\n809\n882\n962\n 1,048\n 1,143\n 1,245\n 8,712\n\n226,552\n45,304\n22,652\n\nTotal revenues (2001-2010)\nTotal capital expenditures c\nUrban infrastructure d\nIRA = internal revenue allocation, LGU = local government unit.\na  \nb  Average annual (real) increase of 9 percent for IRA and for locally generated revenues.\nc  About 20 percent of IRA and 11 percent of local revenues is allocated to capital expenditures.\nd\n  An estimated 50 percent of total capital expenditures by cities and municipalities is allocated to urban infrastructure.\n\n Exchange rate at P40 per $1.0.\n\n121,967\n13,416\n6,708\n\n348,489\n58,721\n29,360\n\n 8,712\n 1,468\n  733\n\n5,663\n1,133\n566\n\n3,049\n335\n167\n\n2.\nCities and municipalities are required to allocate at least 20 percent of their annual IRA\nto  capital  infrastructure.  A  review  of  the  municipal  accounts  for  the  three  pilot  LGUs  indicates\nthat  they  actually  allocated  about  31  percent  of  their  total  income  (IRA  plus  locally  generated\nrevenues)  to  capital  expenditures  over  1994-1999.  Field  investigations  indicate  that  cities  and\nmunicipalities spend an average 13 percent of their local revenues on capital infrastructure, in\naddition to 20 percent of the annual IRA. A lower value of 11 percent as a conservative estimate\nwas  used  for  forecasting.  Based  on  analysis  in  the  pilot  LGUs,  it  was  further  estimated  that\nabout 50 percent of capital expenditures is in their urban areas as distinct from their rural area.\nThe total expenditures for urban capital infrastructure in Mindanao over the period 2001-2010 is\nthen estimated to be about P29 billion ($0.73 billion) as shown in Table A4.1.\n\n\f42\n\nAppendix 4, page 2\n\nFor  the  six  year  implementation  period  (2002-2007),  total  capital  investment  for  the\n3.\nurban  areas  of  Mindanao  is  estimated  to  be  about  $440  million.  Excluding  three  large  cities\n(Davao, General Santos, and Iligan) that are fully committed in terms of capital works over the\nforeseeable future, about $312 million would be required for the urban areas of Mindanao. The\nproposed  project  investment  would  account  for  16  percent  of  the  total  urban  infrastructure\ninvestment for the Mindanao urban LGUs over the project period (Table A4.2).\n\n                 Table A4.2: The Project Investment Slice\n\nItem\n\nTotal expenditure on urban infrastructure 2002-2007\nTotal expenditure excluding three large cities a\n\nProject investment\n\nProject investment as percentage of sector investment program\n\n2001-2010\n2002-2007\n2002-2007 (excluding three large cities)\n\na\n\n Davao, General Santos, and Iligan.\n\n$\n(million)\n\n440\n312\n\n     51.4\n\n   7\n 12\n 16\n\nB. \n\nPrevious and Existing Lending Facilities to Urban LGUs in Mindanao\n\n4.\nUrban areas in Mindanao in general and in the special zone for peace and development\n(SZOPAD) in  particular,  have  in  recent times not benefited to the same extent as other urban\nareas in the country from the funds for demand-driven urban sector development initiatives. The\nWorld  Bank-assisted  Program  for  Essential  Municipal  Infrastructure  Utilities,  Maintenance  and\nEngineering  Development  projects  (also  known  as  municipal  development  projects  [MDPs])\nhave been a significant source of national funding for LGUs for municipal infrastructure, service\nand facilities provision, and improvement. However, MDP I concentrated on LGUs outside a 50-\nkilometer  radius  of  Metro  Manila  and  MDP  II  restricted  beneficiary  LGUs  to  those  outside  the\nMetro Manila area. MDP I was closed in 1998, and MDP II fund is fully allocated currently (Table\nA4.3).\n\n5.\nUnder MDP I, SZOPAD received 9.7 percent and Mindanao 17.3 percent of the funds.\nFrom  MDP  II,  Mindanao  as  a  whole  received  its  fair  allocation  of  investment  of  about  21.5\npercent,  but  SZOPAD  received  only  6.8  percent  of  the  total  amount  of  investment.  For  both\nMDP I and II, SZOPAD received a lower amount of funds compared with the rest of the country\n(based  on  the  proportion  of  their  respective  urban  populations).  SZOPAD  areas  tend  to  be\nbehind in urban development from the perspective of funding accessibility.\n\nA  summary  of  the  analysis  (Table  A4.4)  also  indicates  that  existing  lending  facilities\n6.\n($66.3  million)  can  only  satisfy  15  percent  of  the  urban  investment  needs  in  Mindanao  ($440\nmillion)  over  the  next  six  years.  A  total  of  nine  urban  LGUs  have  participated  in  both  MDP\nprojects,  and  two  cities\u2014Iligan  and  General  Santos\u2014are  also  benefiting  from  the  Asian\nDevelopment Bank\u2019s Philippines Regional Municipal Development Project.1 The nine LGUs are\nall  in  class  I  and  II,  indicating  that  most  urban  LGUs  in  Mindanao  have  yet  to  benefit  from  a\nproject  financing  facility  aimed  at  LGU  investments  in  municipal  infrastructure  and  services.\nThere  is  a  need  to  establish  an  investment  fund  to  which  lower  class  LGUs  in  Mindanao  can\nhave equitable access.\n\n1 Loan 1367-PHI: Regional Municipal Development Project, for $30 million, approved on 25 August 1995.\n\n                  \n\n\f43\n\nAppendix 4, page 3\n\nTable A4.3: Participation in PREMIUMED Projects\n\nBeneficiary LGU\nDigos, Davao del Sur\nDipolog City\nGeneral Santos City\nIligan City\nPagadian City\n\nDigos, Davao del Sur\nDipolog City\nManila, Davao del Sur\nSta.

Finally,  the  LGUs  will  have\ntaken all necessary steps to acquire the required land, rights to land and water (for water supply\ncomponent),  and  rights-of-way  to  expeditiously  implement  the  component,  and  will  have\nobtained all required permits.\n\nC.\n\nAppraisal Criteria\n\n6.\nA  structured  approach  will  be  adopted  for  the  appraisal  and  approval  of  subprojects\nunder part A. Of the estimated 108 eligible subproject LGUs, 40 percent participation has been\nassumed. About 30 percent of subprojects (costing less than $0.5 million) have been classified\nas small, 60 percent (costing $0.5 million-$2.5 million) as medium-size, and 10 percent (costing\nover  $2.5  million)  as  large.  The  size  and  scope  of  each  subproject  will  be  determined  by  the\ndemonstrated needs of and affordability to the project town, taking into account the institutional,\nfinancial, and operational capabilities of the LGU concerned. For all components, upgrading of\nexisting  facilities  and  strengthening  of  their  service  capability  will  be  first  priority  before  the\nsystems  are  expanded.  Technical  design  standards  will  be  appraised,  taking  into  account  the\noverall  strategy  to  apply  appropriate  and  affordable  technology  and  to  provide  adequate\nflexibility for the wide variety of geographic and physical conditions in the project area. To meet\nprudent  technical  and  relending  criteria,  the  appraisal  will  further  consider  the  following\nparameters:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nTechnical viability. The technical design must follow sound engineering practices\nas  well  as  national  Government  guidelines;  a  cost-effective  solution  should  be\nconsidered in comparing technical options.\nFinancial  and  economic  analyses  are  required  if  a  subproject  is  either  medium-\nsize  or  large.  Financial  analyses  will  be  conducted  only  if  the  proposed\ncomponent  is  a  revenue-generating  one.  Economic  analysis  will  be  undertaken\nfor both revenue- and nonrevenue-generating components.\nEnvironmental  acceptability.  Environmentally  sensitive  areas  will  be  avoided,  if\npossible.  The  LGUs  concerned  should  provide  evidence  of  environmental\ncompliance  by  obtaining  an  environmental  compliance  certificate  from  the\nDepartment  of  Environment  and  Natural  Resources.  Compliance  with\nGovernment guidelines and requirements acceptable to ADB must be ensured.\nSocial  impact  analysis.  Components  should  meet  the  people\u2019s  needs  and\ndemands,  and  be  responsive  to  the  poverty  reduction  partnership  agreed  upon\nby \ninclude\nappropriateness  of  community  participation  and  consultation  processes,\nto  pay,  stakeholder  analysis,  socioeconomic\naffordability,  willingness \ndistributional effect, number of poor beneficiaries, and gender issues.\nFinancial capacity assessment. The local government\u2019s financial capacity will be\nassessed. Ability to borrow will be determined and availability of local counterpart\nfund assured.\nInstitutional  capability.  LGUs  capacity  to  prepare,  implement,  and  manage  the\nsubproject must be assessed based on its capability to manage its existing urban\ninfrastructure and services.\n\nthe  Government  and  ADB.  Criteria \n\nfor  assessment  should \n\n(vii)  Risk  analysis.  Subproject  risks  should  be  identified\u2014including  permit  and  land\nacquisition requirements \u2014 and addressed at appraisal to minimize risks.\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 10, page 3\n\n(viii)  Benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  subproject  must  include  provisions  for\nbenefit monitoring and evaluation to ensure that objectives are achieved.\n\nD.\n\nSelection and Approval Procedures\n\nBoth  DILG  and  LBP  will  be  jointly  responsible  for  promoting  and  marketing  the\n7.\navailability  of  an  LGU  credit  facility  in  Mindanao  under  the  Project.  An  LGU  interested  in\nparticipating  will  submit  initial  applications  to  either  the  project  development  office  (PDO)  of\nDILG or Program Management Department (PMD) of LBP, including (i) a letter of interest briefly\nsummarizing  the  objectives  and  scope  of  the  proposed  subproject;  (ii)  a  copy  of  the  local\ndevelopment plan; and the (iii) LGU\u2019s financial condition at present and in the last three years.\n\n8.\nThe Technical Review and Coordinating Committee (TRCC) will review the applications\nand  initially  assess  the  subprojects  considering  (i)  consistency  with  the  approved  local\ndevelopment  plan  and  regional  physical  framework  plan;  (ii)  LGU  credit  rating  in  accordance\nwith LBP\u2019s criteria; (iii) LGU financial capacity to repay the subloan and availability of equity fund\nto  start  up  the  proposed  subproject;  and  (iv)  institutional  capability  of  the  LGU  to  prepare,\nimplement,  and  manage  the  subproject.  TRCC  will  endorse  and  inform  the  LGU  concerned\nwhether the proposed subproject is eligible for further processing. A full feasibility study should\nbe  prepared  for  the  medium-size  and  large  subprojects,  and  a  short  feasibility  study  for  small\nsubprojects.\n\n9.\nOnce endorsed by TRCC, the LGU concerned will prepare a full feasibility study of the\nproposed subproject, assisted by the subproject preparation and implementation support (SPIS)\nteam of PDO. PDO, in coordination with regional offices of DILG and LBP\u2019s lending centers, will\nsupport  this  preparation,  and  any  subsequent  modification,  clarification,  and  processing  of  the\nsubloan  applications  to  PMD  in  a  timely  manner.  PMD  may  also  accept  a    feasibility  study\nalready  prepared  by  the  LGU  by  informing  PDO.  The  document  should  include  (i)  technical\nevaluation  of  each  component  proposed  in  a  subproject,  (ii)  evaluation  of  the  institutional\ncapacity  of  the  subborrower;  (iii)  a  socioeconomic  assessment  and  a  demand  survey  as\nappropriate \n(iv)\nenvironmental  examinations  for  environmentally  sensitive  components;  (v)  financial  analysis,\nincluding  cash  flow  projection  and  financial  internal  rate  of  return  for  revenue-generating\ncomponents; and (vi) financial projections demonstrating the entity\u2019s capacity to repay the loan.\n\nincluding  economic  analysis  of  nonrevenue-generating  components; \n\n10.\nPMD  assisted  by  SPIS,  as  needed,  will  appraise  the  feasibility  study  and  make  a\nsubproject  appraisal  report  (SPAR)  for  each  LGU  subproject  (may  include  more  than  one\ncomponent  in  a  SPAR).  For  medium-size  and  large  subprojects,  PMD  will  provide  properly\nqualified experts to prepare full SPARs. Based on the official SPARs, PMD will recommend that\nTRCC  approve  or  reject  the  subproject.  Subproject  (and  components  therein)  selection  and\napproval will be based on (i) sound technical solution with least-cost approach, (ii) financial and\neconomic viabilities, and (iii) LGU\u2019s financial capacity. The financial return must be greater than\nthe  rate  of  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital.  If  user  charges  are  associated  with  such\nsubcomponents,  the  users\u2019  willingness  to  pay  for  the  services  should  exceed  the  charges\nnecessary  for  full  cost  recovery  unless  the  LGU  concerned  will  provide  subsidized  services  in\naccordance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  criteria  for  subsidies.  The  economic\nreturn from investment in nonrevenue-generating subcomponents should exceed the economic\nopportunity  costs.  All  SPARs  will  be  subject  to  review  by  LBP\u2019s  loan  approving  group.  The\ndetails  of  the  appraisal  procedure,  participants,  and  discussions  of  the  appraisal  team  will  be\ndocumented  in  semiannual  progress  reports.  TRCC  will  review  and  assess  the  technical  and\neconomic soundness of the subproject, and may endorse the subproject on condition that LGU\nwill  commit  to  undertake  a  performance  management  and  monitoring  indicator  strengthening\n\n\f57\n\nAppendix 10, page 4\n\nprogram. Upon TRCC\u2019s approval of the subproject, DILG will execute a subproject agreement\nand  LBP  will  execute  a  subloan  agreement  with  a  prospective  borrower.  The  subproject\nagreement  will  contain  the  objective,  scope,  implementation  arrangements  and  schedule,\ntentative procurement package, and the costs. The subloan agreement will contain the terms of\nfinancing  the  subproject,  with  the  DILG  letter  of  grant  financing  conditions  and  the  subproject\nagreement as attachments.\n\n11.\nBefore  forwarding  the  SPAR  to  LBP\u2019s  loan  approving  group,  PMD  will  seek  ADB\napproval if a subproject costs more than $2.5 million. If a subcomponent is regulated by DENR\nAdministrative  Order    96-37,  the  concerned  LGU  should  obtain  an  environmental  clearance\ncertificate before disbursement is permitted. Even if a large subproject (para. 6) is not regulated\nAdministrative Order by 96-37, ADB\u2019s environmental assessment requirements will be followed.\nThe project implementation unit (PIU) concerned will submit an initial environment examination\nof the subproject to ADB for review before disbursement is made. For subprojects with identified\nadverse  environmental  impacts,  ADB  may  request  that  an  environmental  impact  assessment\nbe  prepared  and  reviewed  before  disbursement.  Documentation  relating  to  the  subproject\nappraisals and relevant supporting documents of the LGU concerned will be retained by PMD\n(with copy to PDO) and made available to ADB on request. ADB will review a selected number\nof these subprojects on ex post facto basis.\n\nE.\n\nProject Monitoring\n\n12.\nPDO  will  regularly  monitor  the  physical  and  technical  implementation,  and  institutional\ndevelopment  of  subprojects.  PMD  will  monitor  financial  progress  and  the  position  of  the\nsubborrower. The subborrower will submit a quarterly progress briefing letter to lending centers\nof  LBP  and  PDO,  from  which  PMD  of  LBP  will  compile  a  semiannual  progress  report  on\nfinancial aspects and PDO will prepare semiannual progress reports on overall project progress.\nPDO  will  integrate  and  submit  a  consolidated  semiannual  progress  report  for  ADB\u2019s  review.\nEach  subborrower  will  prepare  and  submit  a  subproject  completion  report    three  months  after\nphysical  implementation  is  completed.  Through  the  assistance  of  PMD  and  PDO,  the  PIU  of\neach  LGU  will  establish  benefit  and  monitoring  indicators  in  six  months  after  signing  the\nsubproject  agreement.  Monitoring  will  be  through  the  subproject  progress  briefing  letters,  and\nsubproject  completion  reports  will  include  benefit  and  monitoring  results.  A  copy  of  the\nsubproject completion report will be submitted to ADB. A project completion report for the whole\nproject will be prepared by PDO in collaboration with PMD. A draft project completion report will\nbe submitted to ADB for comments five months after physical completion, and will be completed\none month after receiving ADB\u2019s comments.\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 11\n\nINDICATIVE CONTRACT PACKAGES\n\nPackages (no.)\n\nICB\n\nLCB\n\nEstimated Costa\n($ million)\n\nItem\nCivil Works\n\nDipolog\n\nKidapawan\n\nBypass Road\nForeshore Development\n\nBus Terminal\nSolid Waste Management\n\nParang\n\nWater Supply\n\nEquipment and Materials\n\nDipolog\n\nKidapawan\n\nBypass Road\nForeshore Development\n\nBus Terminal\nSolid Waste Management\n\nParang\n\nWater Supply\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n1\n\n\u2014\n\n0.84\n0.51\n\n0.67\n0.24\n\n0.84\n\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n0.25\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014 = no applicable package, ICB = International competitive bidding, LCB = local competitive bidding.\nNote:\n\nPart A contract packages for three core pilot local government units.

The resettlement plan will be disclosed six months before project implementation\nto  give  the  affected  parties  sufficient  time  to  review  and  approve  the  plan.  The  component\nproposed by Dipolog requires land acquisition necessary to improve the foreshore bounded by\nTomas  Claudio  Street  and  Rizal  Avenue.  Specific  improvements  will  include  (i)  a  concrete\nroadway  with  provision  for  parking,  (ii)  development  of  small  parks,  (iii)  repair  of  the  existing\nseawall,  and  (iv)  improvement  of  the  wave  deflector.  The  component  will  affect  about  127\nfamilies (635 persons), with a small portion of private land belonging to one family.  Dipolog has\ndisclosed the resettlement plan since August 2000, through extensive public consultations with\naffected persons and by submitting the document to the City Planning Development Office for\npublic disclosure.\n\nB.     Socioeconomic Information\n\n2.\nThe informal dwellers comprise mostly young persons: 22 percent below age 10 and 46\npercent  below  25  years.    The  female  population  is  slightly  higher  by  7  percent  than  the  male.\nNinety-nine percent of the residents are living on public land.  Only 1 percent own a private lot.\nAll  the  families  own  the  housing  structures;  69  percent  are  sole  occupants  while  31  percent\nhave one or two household sharers. The length of stay in the present area indicates a level of\nstability: 47 percent have lived in the area for over 30 years, and 53 percent have lived there for\nover  10  years  but  less  than  30  years.  The  reasons  for  staying  in  the  area  are  proximity  and\naccess to basic services. Housing conditions are poor. About 84 percent of the houses are of\nlight  materials,  and  16  percent  are  semiconcrete  structures.  There  is  very  little  investment  in\nhousing structures due to lack of security of tenure and low level of income.\n\nAverage  household  expenditures  are  less  than  the  household  income  by  about  P700,\n3.\nwhich  suggests  a  little  amount  for  savings.  The  average  household  income  is  P4,500/month,\nwhile average monthly expenditure is P3,800. The major expenditure is on food (53 percent),\nfollowed by school needs (13 percent). Of the total households surveyed, over 40 percent live\nbelow the poverty line (urban poverty threshold per capita is estimated as P12,336 in 1999 for\nRegion IX).\n\nC. \n\nPrinciples of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plan\n\n4.\nThe Project will be governed in accordance with the established policies set by the Asian\nDevelopment  Bank    (ADB),  the  Implementing  Rules  and  Regulations  mandated  by  the  1992\nUrban  Development  and  Housing  Act,  and  other  local  laws.  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary\nresettlement  states:  (i)  avoid  involuntary  resettlement,  where  feasible;  and  (ii)  minimize\nresettlement where population displacement is unavoidable.  The overall guiding principle is to\nensure  that  resettlement  will  put  the  affected  persons  in  a  situation  at  least  equal  to  or  better\nthan  where  they  were  before  the  subproject  component  is  implemented.  Various  national  and\n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 12, page 2\n\nlocal  policies  exist  to  strengthen  and  support  local  urban  development  initiatives  and\nresettlement. The 1987 Philippine Constitution states: \u201cUrban or rural poor dwellers shall not be\nevicted  nor  their  dwelling  demolished,  except  in  accordance  with  law  and  in  just  and  humane\nmanner.\u201d  The law further states: \u201cNo resettlement of urban dwellers shall be undertaken without\nadequate  consultation  with  them  and  the  communities  where  they  are  to  be  relocated.\u201d    The\nimplementing  rules  and  regulations  of  the  Urban  Housing  and  Development  Act  of  1992\nestablish directives to ensure the observance of proper and humane relocation and resettlement\nprocedures.    This  law  determines  procedures  to  be  observed  in  the  execution  of  eviction  and\ndemolition orders involving underprivileged and homeless citizens, and provides guidelines on\nrelocation that the LGUs must strictly observe.\n\nD.\n\nEntitlements\n\n5.\nThe  results  of  the  census  and  tagging  conducted  by  the  City  Social  Welfare\nDevelopment  Office  will  be  the  basis  for  defining  the  eligibility  of  beneficiaries.  There  are  two\ncategories  of  losses:  (i)  loss  of  housing  structures,  and  (ii)  temporary  loss  of  incomes  during\ntransfer  and  reconstruction.    For  loss  of  housing  structures,  transportation  assistance  to  the\nresettlement  site  for  salvaged  housing  materials,  along  with  new  housing  materials  worth\nP3,500,  will  be  provided.  For  temporary  loss  of  incomes,  a  short-term  employment  scheme\nrelated  to  demolition  and  relocation  will  be  implemented  such  as  absorbing  one  of  the  family\nmembers in the construction work, and providing food for work in house construction.   Persons\nwill be hired for 10 days and will be paid the minimum wage (P198.00 per day).  This strategy\nwill enable affected households to have an income in the interim.  While cash compensation is\nnot encouraged, nevertheless it will be given to affected parties on public land who choose not\nto be resettled, but opt to settle someplace else.  Such compensation will be considered as a\ndisturbance  fee  equivalent  to  P10,000,  depending  on  the  size  and  quality  of  the  structure.  A\ndisturbance fee will also be given to a renter as equivalent to loss of money on advanced rent.\nOnly one household owns titled land, a small portion of which and a part of the structure will be\nsliced.    Cash  compensation  will  be  based  on  the  cost  of  replacing  the  portion  of  land  and\nstructure at current market values.\n\nE.\n\nParticipation and Grievance Mechanism\n\n6.\nParticipation  among  stakeholders  will  be  given  much  importance  in  the  resettlement\nplan. To ensure that stakeholders take part in meaningful activities and participate in a decision\nthat will affect the direction of their lives, a community-based group will be organized to channel\ninformation, grievances, and resources. These will be through regular meetings and dialogues\nwith  the  affected  persons,  government,  nongovernment  organization  (NGO),  and  the  host\ncommunities,  facilitated  by  the  City  Social  Welfare  Office  and  the  NGO  partner.  The  local\ncommittee on grievance will handle the process to redress grievance.\n\nF.\n\nInstitutional Framework\n\nThe institutional arrangement for the resettlement program activities is as follows: (i) the\n7.\nCity  Planning  Development  Office  will  be  the  overall  coordinating  office  in  the  resettlement\nprogram; (ii) the City Social Welfare Development Office will assign two social workers who will\nbe  responsible  for  managing  the  Social  Development  Service  Unit  in  the  office;  (iii)  the  City\nLegal  Office  will  be  responsible  for  land  negotiation,  arbitration  and/or  filing  proceedings  for\n\n\f61\n\nAppendix 12, page 3\n\nexpropriation;    this  office  will  also  chair  the  action  on  grievances  of  affected  persons;  (iv)  city\nassessors and the city budget officer will be responsible for land appraisal based on the existing\nlaw on just and fair compensation, and payment of landowners for land acquired for the right-of-\nway and resettlement area; and (v) the City Planning Development Office will be responsible for\nsite development, demolition, and provision of transportation facilities for relocation and transfer.\nThe PIU of the concerned  LGU will coordinate the subproject component activities.\n\nG.\n\nFinance and Implementation Schedule\n\n8.\nThe  preliminary  cost  for  land  acquisition  and  the  resettlement  plan  is  estimated  at\nP6,914,585.    This  includes  land  development  (road  network,  electricity,  water,  and  drainage),\ncost of relocation and transfer, compensation, livelihood, contingency, cost of land, census and\nsocioeconomic  survey,  resettlement  design,  construction,  and  supervision.  Social  welfare\nservices representing 41 percent of the total resettlement cost will be the counterpart share of\nthe LGU.  The land acquisition and resettlement costs are included in the project cost estimates.\nThe resettlement program will be implemented within two years.  The social preparation stage\nwill start upon confirmation of ADB\u2019s approval of the subproject component.\n\nH.\n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\nThere will be two types of monitoring and evaluation activities. Internal monitoring will be\n9.\nconducted  jointly  by  the  PIU  of  the  concerned  LGU  and  the  community  beneficiaries.    A\nmonitoring  team  composed  of  staffs  from  PIU,  City  Planning  Development  Office,  City  Social\nWelfare  Development  Office  and  the  representative  beneficiaries  of  the  community  will\ncompose the community-based monitoring committee.  They will be responsible for monitoring\nand evaluating the resettlement once a year thereafter, for a period of three years.  An NGO will\nbe commissioned to conduct postevaluation of the resettlement program to assess whether the\nresettlement objectives have been achieved and to verify the results of internal monitoring.\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 13, page 1\n\nA.\n\nOverview\n\nLAND BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES\n\nEstablished by Republic Act 3844 on 8 August 1963, the Land Bank of the Philippines\n1.\n(LBP)  is  a  government-owned  financial  institution  and  is  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  local\ngovernment unit (LGU) lending facility. LBP\u2019s original mandate was to provide financial support\nto  the  Comprehensive  Agrarian  Reform  Program,  as  well  as  to  provide  farmers  with  financial\nsupport to sustain their productivity. To support such activities, the bank engages in commercial\nbanking operations. A universal bank whose authorized capital has been raised from P9 billion\nto P25 billion, LBP has a policy mission and a developmental orientation since it also engages\nin  special  lending  programs  such  as  lending  to  LGUs.  The  bank  is  exempt  from  government\nregulations on compensation, position classification, and qualification standards.\n\n2.\nLBP is managed by a board of nine directors, comprising the following: the Secretary of\nFinance  (chair),  president  of  LBP  (vice-chair),  secretaries  of  agrarian  reform,  agriculture  and\nlabor,  and  four  other  members  appointed  by  the  President  of  the  Philippines  to  represent  the\nagrarian  reform  beneficiaries,  the  landowners,  and  the  private  sector.  Under  the  office  of  the\nLBP President and corporate executive office, there are four major sectors namely; Corporate\nServices and Subsidiaries Sector, Operations Sector, Institutional Banking Sector, and Agrarian\nand Domestic Banking Sector. The LBP President is assisted by 3 executive vice-president, 6\nsenior  vice  president,  14  first  vice-presidents,  26  vice-presidents,  and  55  assistant  vice-\npresidents. LBP manpower head count has been streamlined from a high 8,945 in end-1999 to\n8,466 in May 2001.\n\n3.\nThe loan portfolio quality of LBP reflects its policy mission to serve the financing needs\nof the agrarian and agriculture sectors. This mission resulted in the deterioration of LBP\u2019s loan\nportfolio  in  1998  when  the  effects  of  the  El  Ni\u00f1o  phenomenon  led  to  slower  growth  in  the\nagriculture  sector.  In  1999,  its  portfolio  registered  a  worse-than-average  nonperforming  loan\nfigure primarily as a result of the souring of a number of its big-ticket commercial loans, limited\nopportunities  in  its  other  lending  sectors  as  a  whole,  and  its  exposure  to  the  farmers  and\nfisherfolk cooperatives. As of fiscal year-end (FYE) 1999, the bank had a past-due ratio of 16.4\npercent, higher than the industry average of 13.6 percent during the period. Broken down into\nits commercial and agrarian components, nonperforming loans for the period were 15.9 percent\nand 20.9 percent, respectively. Total provisions the bank set aside for its loans were equivalent\nto 64.1 percent of nonperforming loans for the commercial and 92.6 percent of nonperforming\nloans for the agrarian side.\n\nLBP\u2019s  LGU  lending  activities  have  grown  significantly  over  the  years,  reaching  P7.5\n4.\nbillion  as  of  end-2000.  Projects  financed  include  the  construction  of  water  and  telephone\nsystems, bus terminals, and public markets. The following are the major factors LBP  considers\nin  the  evaluation  process:  financial  condition  of  the  LGUs,  the  income  class,  budget\nmanagement capabilities and level of training of LGU officials, the views of the Department of\nInterior  and  Local  Government  and  the  Department  of  Finance,  the  viability  of  projects\nundertaken  by  the  LGUs,  economic  conditions  in  the  LGU  and  surrounding  regions,  and    the\npolitical  situation  the  LGUs  face.  LBP  has  a  solid  track  record  in  LGU  lending  as  reflected  by\nthe very low past-due rate of only 0.2 percent.\n\nLBP\u2019s  2000  financial  statements  show  an  expansion  in  the  company\u2019s  banking\n5.\noperations  despite  its  inability  to  obtain  any  cash  infusion  from  the  national  Government.  Its\ntotal asset base increased by 5.56 percent to P210 billion between FY1999 and FY2000. The\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 13, page 2\n\nbank\u2019s  deposit  base  has  been  steadily  growing  as  well,  rising  7.0  percent  to  P152  billion  in\nFY2000 and 14.87 percent to P142 billion in FY1999. The deposit profile of LBP showed that\nout of its total deposits, 67.42 percent were generated from government or government-related\ninstitutions while the remaining 32.58 percent were sourced from private depositors. The bank\naims  to  diversify  its  deposit  base  further  by  attracting  more  private  deposits,  to  reduce  its\ndependence  on  interest-sensitive  government  funds.  LBP\u2019s  net  loans,  on  the  other  hand,\nremained relatively steady at P105 billion while its loan-to-deposit ratio declined to 75 percent in\n2000 from 87 percent in 1998.\n\nBased  on  LBP\u2019s  projections,  the  bank  expected  to  earn  approximately  P1.50  billion  in\n6.\n2001, rising gradually in the following years. The projected income performance is lower than\nthe level achieved prior to the Asian economic crisis, when the yearly net income exceeded P2\nbillion. A major reason for this is the need to continue to build up its provisions for probable loan\nlosses so as to protect its long-term viability and its creditors. Provisioning activities for the past\ntwo  years  have  been  significant  (para.  9).  As  a  result  of  the  need  to  ensure  its  viability  and\nprotect its creditors, and because of Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program expenses that\nare charged to LBP\u2019s operations, its return on asset (ROA) (after the Comprehensive Agrarian\nReform  Program)  has  been  around  the  0.20  percent  level  in  2000.  These  net  income\nprojections,  however,  are  conservative  and  are  based  on  a  very  aggressive  provisioning\nposture.  As  the  domestic  economy  has  stabilized  and  is  expected  to  improve  in  the  coming\nyears, the amount of provisioning may be less (but still sufficient) than the amounts indicated in\nLBP\u2019s  conservative  projections.  This  will  improve  LBP\u2019s  ROA  after  Comprehensive  Agrarian\nReform Program expenses from 0.20 percent in 2000 to more than 0.70 percent in 2004. This is\nbased on a provisioning level of P2.40 billion\u2013P2.65 billion a year for 2001-2004, which is way\nabove the provisioning level (approximately P0.3 billion) that existed before the Asian economic\ncrisis. As of end-2000, LBP\u2019s capital adequacy ratio  based on Central Bank of the Philippines\nstandards stood at 10.6 percent. The detailed description and financial statements of LBP are in\nSupplementary Appendix G.\n\nB. \n\nAction Plan\n\n1.\n\nStrengthening Asset Quality\n\n7.\nDue  to  the  Asian  economic  crisis,  the  asset  quality  of  the  whole  banking  sector  has\nsteadily  deteriorated  over  the  years.  With  a  nonperforming  loan  ratio    of  approximately  3.5\npercent  (end-1996)  for  the  sector  just  before  the  crisis  occurred,  the  nonperforming  loan  ratio\nhas  jumped  to  17.8  percent  as  of  June  2000  for  the  whole  commercial  banking  sector.  The\npressure  on  asset  quality  continues  due  to  the  combination  of  the  struggling  macroeconomic\nperformance of the Philippines and the lag effects of the crisis. It must be noted that the asset\nquality  of  LBP  lags  behind  that  of  its  peers,  partly  due  to  its  policy  mission:  its  lending\noperations  include  providing  credit  to  agriculture  and  other  specific  sectors,  areas  that  entail\nhigher risks. As of end-2000, the exposure to farmers and fisherfolk cooperatives accounted for\nover 10.0 percent of LBP\u2019s gross loan portfolio, while the small and medium-scale enterprises\naccounted for another 10.0 percent. The weakest sector, agrarian lending, has a high past-due\nrate of 21.3 percent as of end-June 2000. Consequently, LBP\u2019s nonperforming loan ratio as of\nJune 2000 stood at 18.1 percent, higher than the industry average of 14.7 percent. Significant\nasset quality pressure can threaten the viability of a bank in the absence of such provisions. To\nprotect its creditors, LBP agrees to (i) cover its past-due accounts of agrarian loans to at least\n95 percent of cumulative loan loss reserves to past-due loans; and  (ii) continue building up its\nprovisions for probable loan losses to achieve a minimum coverage (total provisions divided by\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 13, page 3\n\npast-due loans) of at least 50 percent of its total past-due loans; this is higher than the current\nindustry average of approximately 44 percent.\n\n2. \n\nIncreasing Capitalization\n\n8.\nA  major  aspect  of  LBP\u2019s  financial  position  is  its  level  of  capitalization.  Its  capital\nadequacy ratio (based on Central Bank of the Philippines standards) declined from 13.1 percent\nin 1997 to 12.1 percent in 1998 and to 10.1 percent as of end-2000. This can be traced to its\nlower  profitability,  Comprehensive  Agrarian  Reform  Program  expenses  charged  to  its  banking\noperations, and the steady expansion of its risk assets, among others. Furthermore, the Social\nSecurity System redeemed P1.2 billion worth of preferred shares in 1999, thus reducing LBP\u2019s\nlevel  of  capitalization.  Indeed,  its  capitalization  level  declined  in  absolute  terms  from  P15.26\nbillion  in  1998  to  P14.2  billion  as  of  end-1999  by  Central  Bank  of  the  Philippines  standards.\nLBP\u2019s  capital  adequacy  ratio  improved  to  11.6  percent  as  of  April  2001.  The  level  of\ncapitalization,  however,  is  an  important  factor  since  it  acts  as  an  ultimate  buffer  when  asset\nquality  problems  impose  notable  pressure  on  the  bank.  LBP  agreed  to  maintain  its  capital\nadequacy ratio based on Central Bank of the Philippines standards to at least 10 percent. In the\nnext two years, LBP\u2019s capital adequacy ratio is projected at 11.7 percent at end-2001 and 11.5\npercent at end-2002.\n\n3.\n\nBuilding Up Provisions to Enhance Repayment Capacity\n\n9.\nRepayment capacity is enhanced when provisions for probable loan losses are built up.\nThis prudent banking move, however, will reduce profitability. Regarding LBP\u2019s profitability, net\nincome in 1999 decreased by 37.5 percent as it declined to P627 million from approximately P1\nbillion  in  1998.  These  income  figures  are  below  those  of  previous  years  due  to  LBP\u2019s  heavy\nprovisioning  for  the  past  two  years:  P7.5  billion  in  1999  and  P4.8  billion  in  1998.  These  are\nmuch higher than the P1.5 billion in 1997, P0.1 billion in 1996, P0.5 billion in 1995, and P0.2\nbillion in 1994. This aggressive provisioning posture on the part of LBP is  considered prudent,\nas the aftereffects of the Asian economic crisis are still seeping into the banking system. LBP\nplans to set aside provisions of approximately P2 billion or more to enhance its credit standing\nand  loan  repayment  capacity.  Because  of  the  importance  of  provisioning,  it  is  inevitable  and\nwise to impose a more realistic profitability requirement. LBP\u2019s net income resulted in its ROA\nat the 0.20 percent level FY2000. These results, however, are conservative and are based on a\nvery aggressive provisioning posture. As the domestic economy has stabilized and is expected\nto improve in the coming years, provisioning may be less (but still sufficient) than the amounts\nthe\nindicated \nComprehensive  Agrarian  Reform  Program  expenses  from  year  2001  onward.  Thomsons'\nRatings  Philippines  projects  that  LBP  can  balance  the  required  provisioning  for  probable  loan\nloss and profitability without affecting its credit standing (Table A13). Therefore, LBP agrees to\nmeet the following targets: ROA (after Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program expenses) of\n0.55  percent  for  2001,  and  0.6  percent  for  2002  and  subsequent  years.  These  profitability\ntargets can be attained based on a P2.5 billion provisioning level each year for 2001-2004. This\nprovisioning level is still aggressive in nature and is way above the level that existed before the\nAsian economic crisis.\n\nin  LBP\u2019s  conservative  projections.  This  will \n\nimprove  LBP\u2019s  ROA  after \n\n4. \n\nMaintaining Health and Improving Liquidity Position\n\n10.\nLBP\u2019s  loan-to-deposit  ratio  stood  at  75  percent  in  2000,  an  improvement  from  the\nprevious year\u2019s 87 percent in 1998 (82.75 percent in 1997 and 87.87 percent in 1996).   On the\nother  hand,  its  quasi-liquid  assets  ratio  stood  at  38.31  percent  as  of  end-1999,  higher  than\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 13, page 4\n\n1998\u2019s 33.35 percent, 1997\u2019s 35.01 percent, and 1996\u2019s 35.66 percent.  LBP agrees to improve\nliquidity  position  as  follows:  (i)  loan-to-deposit  ratio  of  not  more  than  90  percent;  and  (ii)  a\nminimum  quasi-liquid  asset  ratio  of  25  percent  (defined  as  cash  on  hand,  checks  and  other\ncash  items,  marketable  securities,  and  due  from  Central  Bank  of  the  Philippines  and  other\nbanks, divided by total assets). The loan-to-deposit ratio at 90 percent is considered reasonable\nas  it  will  increase  LBP\u2019s  headroom  to  lend  out  such  funds,  and  subsequently  enhance  its\nprofitability. As such funds are not part of the deposit base, they have the effect of increasing\nlending\nthe \nopportunities increase, causing a positive impact on LBP\u2019s profitability.\n\nloan-to-deposit  ratio.  Furthermore,  as \n\nthe  domestic  economy \n\nimproves, \n\nTable A13: Land Bank of the Philippines Projecteda Profit and Loss Scenario (Pmn)\n\n2003\n\n2002\n\n2004\n\n2000\n\n2001\n\n10,620\n6,398\n577\n1,691\n19,286\n\n11,085\n9,207\n197\n1,010\n21,499\n\n12,543\n8,599\n201\n1,036\n22,379\n\n15,624\n8,931\n668\n1,982\n27,205\n\n16,755\n10,096\n702\n2,081\n29,634\n\nItem\nRevenues\nLoans\nInvestments\nForeign Exchange\nOthers\n             Gross Revenues\nExpenses\nInterest on Deposits\nOther Financial Expenses\nTotal Cost of Funds\nProvision for Loan Losses\nGeneral & Administrative Expenses\n            Total Expenses\nNet Income Before CARP\nCARP Expenses Charged to Banking\nNet Income Before Provision for Income Tax\nProvision for Income Tax\nNet Income\nCARP = Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program.\na\n LBP provided projections for 2001 and 2002 as of 18 January 2001, while Thomson Ratings Philippines provided\nthose for 2003 and 2004.\n\n11,009\n2,073\n13,082\n2,550\n9,593\n25,225\n4,409\n1,349\n3,060\n918\n2,142\n\n10,008\n1,991\n11,999\n2,650\n8,721\n23,370\n3,835\n1,380\n2,455\n737\n1,718\n\n6,199\n1,339\n7,538\n2,599\n6,552\n16,689\n2,597\n1,832\n765\n265\n500\n\n6,445\n1,825\n8,270\n2,417\n9,138\n19,825\n\n6,607\n2,257\n8,864\n2,400\n9,343\n20,607\n\n1,674\n174\n1,500\n\n1,772\n195\n1,577\n\n5. \n\nLBP\u2019s LGU Lending\n\n11.\nIn view of the preference for granting heavy equipment loans to LGUs in Mindanao, LBP\nwill  (i)  duly  comply  with  the  sublending  eligibility  criteria  set  forth  under  the  Project,  and  (ii)\nensure that its field staff receive on-the-job training for capacity-building in part B of the Project.\n\nC. \n\nImplication of Mindanao Basic Urban Services Facility\n\n12.\nThe  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  loan  to  LBP  would  have  negligible  impact  on\nLBP\u2019s  profit/loss  and  net  income  statements,  since  the  ADB  loan  accounts  for  less  than  1\npercent of LBP\u2019s total resources annually. However, LBP is slowly addressing the mismatch in\nfunding by trying to attract more long-term deposits. The ADB loan will largely be beneficial in\naddressing this asset liability mismatch by attracting long-term maturing deposits, rather than by\nimpacting  on  net  income.  From  an  asset-liability  perspective,  access  to  long-term  funds  from\nforeign and domestic agencies allows the bank to allocate up to 35 percent of its loans for long-\nterm  purposes.  The  presence  of  these  funds  helps  in  addressing  the  mismatch  in  the  bank\u2019s\nfunding  structure  where  89  percent  of  its  deposits  were  short-term  and  only  11  percent  had\nlong-term maturities as of FY2000.\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 14, page 1\n\nA.\n\nGeneral\n\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES\n\nThe  economic  and  financial  analyses  of  the  five  components1  were  guided  by  the\n1.\nfollowing  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  guidelines:  (i)  Framework for the Economic and\nFinancial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects, (ii)  Guidelines for the Economic\nAnalysis of Projects,  (iii) Guidelines for Preparation and Presentation of Financial Analysis of\nProjects,  and  (iv)  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Water  Supply  Projects.  All\nsubprojects  are  subject  to  analysis  of  subborrower\u2019s  financial  capacity.  Medium-size  or  large\nsubprojects  should  provide  financial  and  economic  analyses  of  proposed  components  in  a\nsubproject.  Economic  internal  rates  of  returns  (EIRRs)  are  calculated  for  all  components,  and\nfinancial internal rates of returns (FIRRs) are calculated for revenue-generating components.\n\nB.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n2.\nThe  economic  life  of  the  infrastructure  components  is  assumed  to  be  20  years,  except\nthat  for  solid  waste  management,  which  is  assumed  to  be  7  years.    After  this  period,  residual\nvalue is considered to be nil. Economic evaluation used the domestic price numeraire because\nproject inputs are mainly nontradable.  For valuation of tradable goods, a shadow exchange rate\nfactor of 1.22 was used based on the standard conversion factor of 0.837. A shadow wage rate\nfactor of 0.7 was applied to the wage of unskilled labor at the domestic price level.\n\n1.  \n\nParang Water Supply\n\n \n\nThe  economic  benefits  of  the  water  supply  components  relate  mainly  to    (i)  an  unmet\n3.\ndemand  for  piped  water  supply  services  in  the  municipality,  and  (ii)  incremental  water\nconsumption by new water users.  The municipality will receive substantial benefits from lower\nwater  costs  as  many  people  living  in  the  subproject  area  depend  on  expensive  water  sold  by\nprivate water vendors and/or their own deep or shallow wells, which are often unhygienic. The\nbenefit streams include (i) nonincremental economic benefits obtained by switching from private\nvendor supplies to the public water systems, and valued at the quantity of water consumed prior\nto connection to the public water supply system multiplied by the economic supply price, and (ii)\nincremental economic benefits estimated by multiplying incremental water consumption with the\naverage demand price. Consumption was based on a linear demand curve. Cost savings result\nfrom  not  having  to  buy  water  from  private  water  vendors.  Recurrent  costs  include  the  cost  of\npower,  system  operation  and  maintenance,  and  chemical  expenditures  for  water  treatment.\nOnly  incremental  costs  incurred  as  a  result  of  the  Project  are  included.  The  proposed\nimprovement  of  the  water  supply  system  is  further  expected  to  reduce  the  unaccounted-for\nwater  to  at  least  25  percent.    However,  there  are  no  estimates  of  how  much  unaccounted-for\nwater is technical (leakage) or nontechnical (water consumed but not paid for).\n\n2.  \n\nDipolog Bypass Road\n\n4.\nThe proposed bypass road aims to (i) ease traffic congestion along the present national\nhighway,  (ii) get vehicles out of the central business district, and (iii) provide an alternative route\nto motorists and other road users who want to avoid the central business district of Dipolog. The\nexisting route is 3.4 kilometers (km) long, while the proposed route would be 2.5 km.  The new\nroad will save some 10 minutes of travel time at busy periods. For the bypass road component,\nvehicle operating cost savings, including reduced maintenance costs and savings in travel time\n\n                                                          \n1\n  The  Bus Terminal and Solid Waste Projects in Kidapawan City, the Foreshore Development and the Bypass Road Projects in\n\nDipolog City and the Water Supply Project in Parang municipality.\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 14, page 2\n\nfor passengers and goods, were considered for direct and potential road users.  Total benefits\nwere calculated based on the traffic count surveys conducted for the purpose. Using 4.5 percent\ntraffic growth rate, the diverted traffic was projected for the whole planning period.  For the with-\nproject case, vehicle operating cost estimates were based on estimated diverted traffic via the\nproposed  bypass road plus  the vehicle operating cost of the remaining traffic at the old route.\nAnother  benefit  of  the  project  is  decongestion,  but  this  was  not  quantified  due  to  insufficient\ninformation  on  the  total  traffic  volume  in  the  central  urban  streets  to  model  the  impact  if\ncongestion  is  reduced.    The  benefits  of  the  bypass  are  therefore  underestimated  to  some\ndegree. Maintenance cost was estimated on the basis of the equivalent maintenance kilometers\nmethod.    Routine  maintenance  for  the  project  will  cover  drainage  cleaning,  vegetation  control,\nrepainting  of  pavement  markings,  cleaning  of  road  accessories,  and  shoulder  repair  costs\ncomputed at P0.165 million annually.\n\n3.\n\nDipolog Foreshore Development\n\n5.\nThe  economic  benefits  of  the  foreshore  development  component  are  largely  expected\nfrom  the  following:  (i)  protecting  the  foreshore  area  from  sea  erosion,  (ii)  improving\nenvironmental  sanitation  in  the  area  by  relocating  the  squatters  who  are  the  main  sources  of\npollution,  (iii)  employment  and  economic  opportunities  with  the  development  of  the  area  for\nbusiness  and  commerce,  and  (iv)  improved  living  condition  of  the  affected  squatters  and\nemployment opportunities in the resettlement area.\n\n6.\nFor  calculating  the  EIRR,  the  relevant  benefits  are  those  that  can  be  quantified  in\nmonetary terms.  The measurable community benefits used in the economic analysis were the\nwillingness  of  potential  consumers  (stallholders  and  those  who  will  purchase  or  lease  the\ndevelopment site) to pay.  The high level of the EIRR of the proposed foreshore development in\nDipolog  is  due  mainly  to  the  relatively  low  opportunity  cost  for  land  acquisition  and  high\ndevelopment benefits. The economic benefits of this component will be maximized on account\nof the resettlement program currently being undertaken in the city.\n\n4.\n\nKidapawan Solid Waste Management\n\n7.\nIn  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  the  Department  of  Environment  and  Natural\nResources (DENR), controlled dumping is proposed for Kidapawan.  Controlled dumping is the\nintermediate stage in upgrading disposal from open dumping to sanitary landfill.  It comprises a\nminimal-engineered  disposal  site  with  minimum  prescribed  site  infrastructure  and  operational\nmeasures  and  facilities  that  will  mitigate  some  of  the  adverse  impacts  brought  about  by  open\ndumping.    Considerably  less  investment  is  required  in  capital  works  or  equipment  purchases\nthan  for  sanitary  landfill.  While  city  staff  are  locating  a  permanent  site  for  the  landfill,  the\nproposal is considered the most cost-effective alternative. Intangible environmental and health\nbenefits of improved solid waste management were identified as the primary benefits associated\nwith  the  solid  waste  project.  However,  these  benefits  cannot  be  quantified  directly.  The\nmeasurable community benefits used in the economic analysis were taken to be the willingness\nof the community to pay. The social survey indicates a willingness to pay about P64 per month\nper  family.  The  expressed  willingness  to  pay  is  accepted  here  as  the  measure  of  benefits\nregardless of whether residents actually do or do not pay the amount.\n\n5. \n\nKidapawan Bus Terminal\n\nA  new  bus  terminal  is  proposed  to  reduce  traffic  congestion  and  inconvenience  at  the\n8.\nexisting terminal. The new terminal will accommodate an estimated 200 buses per day and 38\nrentable stalls, with an expected annual traffic growth at about 4.6 percent per year. The primary\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 14, page 3\n\nbenefits of these improvements are estimated by the willingness of bus, jeepney operators, and\nstallholders to pay. Unquantifiable time savings benefits from reduced traffic are likely; thus, the\ntotal economic benefits are underestimated. Economic costs were estimated on the basis of the\nlonger  distance  to  the  site,  as  additional  vehicle  operating  costs  per  bus  (P7.09)  and  jeepney\n(P1.90 per km).\n\n6.\n\nResults\n\nC.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\n9.\nThe  major  indicators  of  the  economic  viability  of  the  components  are  summarized  in\nTable A14.1.  All components are economically viable, with base case EIRRs of 14-38 percent,\nexceeding the 12 percent economic opportunity cost of capital.\n\n10.\nFIRRs  and  fund  flow  projections  were  prepared  for  the  cost  recovery  components  in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Framework  for  Economic  and  Financial  Appraisal  of  Urban\nDevelopment Sector Projects.  FIRRs were calculated for water supply, foreshore development,\nand  the  bus  terminal.    Solid  waste  management  in  Kidapawan  was  not  subjected  to  financial\nanalysis, mainly because the city officials expressed their intention of subsidizing the operation\nand  not  collecting  garbage  or  tipping  fees  for  the  proposed  controlled  dump,  as  the  service\nwould  generate  beneficial  external  effects,  and  subsidy  could  be  justified  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s Criteria for Subsidies. The expected revenue estimates are based on user charges.  The\nanalyses  were  conducted  in  2000  constant  prices  and  accounted  for  all  costs  incurred  in\nconstruction except price contingencies.  Incremental operation and maintenance (O&M) costs\nare included in the analyses.  The resulting FIRRs are compared with the calculated weighted\naverage  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  for  each  component.  WACC  was  based  on  the  weighted\ninterest of borrowings, grant, and local equity.\n\n1.  \n\nParang Water Supply\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n11.\nTo recover the costs of the facilities and services, the primary sources of revenue would\nbe  monthly  user  tariffs  and  connection  fee  from  new  customers.  The  resulting  charges  in\nconstant 2000 prices were computed at P12 per cubic meter (m3) for domestic connection, P24\nper m3 for commercial connection, and P18 per m3 for institutional connection.  A connection fee\nof  P800  will  be  charged  to  all  those  who  will  connect  to  the  new  system.  The  potential\npopulation  to  be  served  was  estimated  to  be  about  20,313  with  120  liters  per  capita  per  day.\nO&M costs include expenditures for salaries, power, chemicals, spare parts, and miscellaneous\nexpenses. Only the incremental O&M costs were included in calculating the FIRR.  The design\nyear  for  the  project  was  expected  to  be  2011.  The  WACC  for  the  water  supply  project  was\ncalculated  to  be  12.4  percent.    Computed  net  revenues  and  the  FIRR  for  the  base  case\ncompared favorably with the WACC estimate.  However, conventional sensitivity tests show that\nthe FIRR is sensitive to significant adverse changes in costs and revenues.\n\n2.\n\nDipolog Foreshore Development\n\n12.\nThe  area  available  for  lease  or  sale  for  commercial  development  is  estimated  to  be\n2,950 square meters (m2). City officials confirmed their intention of leasing half of the developed\narea and selling the remaining half to private developers.  Financial analysis focused on these\noptions.  The best estimate of P10,000 per m2 (at 2000 price level) was used as the expected\nsale value.  Commercial lots in the central business district currently sells at twice that value.  A\ntotal of P24.9 million is anticipated over three years, 2003-2005.  The potential lease revenue is\nbased  on  7  percent  of  the  sale  value,  estimated  to  be  P2.065  million  annually.    An  additional\nsource of income would be 68 stalls to rented out for P20 per m2 per day, equivalent to P2.978\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 14, page 4\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nmillion  a  year.  For  the  project  financial  viability  analysis,  the  FIRR,  which  is  the  discount  rate\nthat  equalizes  the  present  values  of  costs  and  revenues  over  the  project  life,  was  calculated.\nThe  base  FIRR  is  30.3  percent,  which  is  above  the  assumed  WACC  of  12.4  percent.    The\nFIRRs, with associated sensitivity tests, are given in Table A14.1.\n\n3.\n\nKidapawan Bus Terminal\n\n13.\nCurrently, about 200 buses and 55 jeepneys use the existing terminal facility.  The same\nnumbers are expected to use the new terminal.  The approximate charge per vehicle that would\nresult  in  a  fully  self-funding  operation  would  be  P35  per  bus  and  P17.50  per  jeepney.    It  is\nrecognized  that  the  proposed  charges  are  significantly  higher  than  the  current  charges.\nHowever, they are comparable with charges for newly constructed transport terminal facilities in\nother cities in Mindanao.  Another source of income for the terminal would be the 38 stalls that\nwould  be  rented  out  at  P5.00  per  m2  per  day.  Recurrent  costs  would  be  incurred  for  both\nwithout- and with-project cases.  Those costs are assumed to be the same for both cases and\nare therefore net to zero for the marginal cash flows.  The WACC for the terminal component\nwas calculated to be 11.8 percent.  The return on the marginal investment (FIRR) for the base\ncase marginally exceeds the estimated WACC. (Table A14.1).\n\n4.\n\nResults\n\nThe major indicators of the financial viability of the components are summarized in Table\n14.\nA14.1.  All components are financially viable, with base case FIRRs of 13-30 percent exceeding\nthe computed WACC for each component.\n\nD.\n\nTariff Structure and Affordability\n\n1.\n\nParang Water Supply\n\n \n15.\nThe  poverty  threshold  income  for  Parang  was  estimated  to  be  P76,734  per  annum\n(P12,789 per capita).  An estimated 48 percent of households fall within this income group.  An\nannual tariff of P2,592 would represent 3.4 percent of that income.  This is less than 5 percent,\nwhich  is  assumed  to  be  the  acceptable  maximum  expenditure  for  water  for  the  low-income\ngroup.    As  per  the  social  survey,  current  household  expenditure  for  water  from  vendors  and\nother sources averaged P2,500 per annum.  This amount is paid for only about 3.5 m3 of water\nper household per month.  It is unlikely that the slight increase in the proposed tariff would be an\nissue to the consumers, considering the improvement in both quality and quantity of water to be\nsupplied by the subproject.\n\n2.\n\nDipolog Foreshore Development\n\n16.\nThe  results  of  the  financial  and  economic  analyses  hinge  on  the  price  for  which  the\nproposed land development can be sold or leased.  The city administration confirmed the ability\nor willingness of potential buyers or lessors to pay the quoted price, and that demand would be\nmore than adequate based on current fair market price in the urban center.\n \n\n3.\n\nKidapawan Bus Terminal\n\n17.\nFor  the  Kidapawan  bus  terminal  component,  the  proposed  user  charges  will  be  raised\nsubstantially,  largely  due  to  the  gap  between  the  current  rental  fee  charged  by  the  city\ngovernment  to  the  bus/jeepney  operators  and  the  proposed  fee  to  ensure  project  viability.\nHowever,  the  city  will  ensure  that  full  cost  recovery  charges  do  not  exceed  the  level  of\nwillingness to pay elicited during the socioeconomic survey.\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 14, page 5\n\nE.\n\nAffordability to the Local Government\n\n18.\nThe  financial  capabilities  of  the  Implementing  Agencies,  the  local  government  units\n(LGUs),  were  evaluated  based  on  financial  statements  and  forecasts  of  future  revenues  and\nexpenditures.    The  internal  revenue  allotment  (IRA)  is  a  major  source  of  revenues  for  LGUs,\nfollowed  by  locally  generated  revenues.    The  annual  average  real  growth  rates  for  IRA  and\nlocally generated revenues were 11 and 10 percent, respectively, over the last five years.  The\nannual growth rate used for revenue and expenditure projections in real prices are as follows:\n(i)  an  average  10  percent  increase  in  IRA  from  2001  to  2005  and  5  percent  annual  increase\nthereafter;  (ii) a 10 percent annual increase in local taxes;  (iii) a 5 percent annual increase in\nnontax  revenue;  and  (iv)  a  5-10  percent  annual  increase  in  expenditures.  Table  A14.2\nsummarizes  the  financial  projections  of  the  three  LGUs  (in  current  2000  prices).  Detailed\nrevenue  and  expenditure  statements  are  reported  in  Supplementary  Appendixes  A,  B,  C,\nrespectively, for each LGU.\n\n19.\nThe cash flow projections indicate that all three LGUs have the capacity to borrow for the\nproposed investments. The Local Government Code requires the LGUs\u2019 annual debt service  to\nbe  comfortably  within  the  20  percent  limit,  with  the  highest  level  at  about  8  percent  when\nprincipal repayments start to be due.  The projected financial statements from 2001 to 2015 also\nindicate that the financial condition of LGUs will improve over the medium term.\n\nTable A14.1: Summary of the Economic and Financial Analyses\n\nComponent\n\nEIRR\n\nFIRR\n\nPercent Sensitivity\n\nIndicator\n\nSwitching\n   Value\n\nPercent Sensitivity\n\n Indicator\n\nSwitching\n  Value\n\nA.

This also meant cutbacks in the delivery of\nsocial services. The crisis also severely affected the local government unit (LGU) expenditures\non economic services and led LGUs to increases in unemployment and underemployment rates\nin  1998.  Over  one  third  of  the  labor  force  in  Mindanao  is  unemployed  or  underemployed,  and\nper capita income is only 75 percent of the national average.\n\nSocial  indicators  are  also  low  in  the  project  area:  the  average  value  of  the  life\n2.\nexpectancy index for the Philippines is 0.72, and the lowest value in one of the provinces of the\nproject area is 0.47. The project area has higher than average infant mortality rate in the project\nregions and the worst in the Philippines. The human development index ranges between 0.491\nfor the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) and 0.649 for Region 10, compared\nwith 0.740 for the Philippines as a whole.\n\n3.\nAmong  the  island  groups,  Mindanao  remains  the  poorest,  with  the  highest  poverty\nincidence (head count) of 50 percent (Table A15). The 1997 incidence of poverty in Mindanao\u2019s\nurban area (37 percent) was nearly twice the national average for urban areas (21.5 percent).\nOf the total 7.4 million urban poor, about 2.1 million (28 percent) reside in urban Mindanao. The\nfigure was highest in the ARMM at 51 percent and lowest in Region 9 and 11 at 26 percent and\n27  percent,  respectively.  The  survey  for  a  project  preparatory  technical  assistance    in  three\nrepresentative  pilot  LGUs  in  Mindanao  at  end-1998  revealed  an  even  higher  urban  poverty\nincidence averaging 50 percent.\n\nRegion\n\nTable A15: Poverty Threshold and Poverty Incidence (1997)\n\nPoverty\nThreshold\n(P per\ncapita per\nyear)\n\nUrban Poverty\nThreshold (P per\ncapita per year)\n\nTotal Poverty\nIncidence\n(head count\nin percent)\n\nUrban\nPoverty\nIncidence\n(head count\nin percent)\n\nUrban Poor\nPopulation\n(\u2018000)\n\nHDI\n(based on\ninternational\ncomparative\ndata)\n\nPhilippines\nMindanao\n\n11,319\n10,586\n9,732\n10,440\n10,503\n11,119\n11,134\n\nRegion 9\nRegion 10\nRegion 11\nRegion 12\nARMM\n\n12,577\n11,567\n11,299\n11,259\n11,704\n12,468\n12,603\nARMM = Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao, HDI = human development index.\nSource: Technical Working Group on Income Statistics, National Statistical Coordination Board.

Provision  of  basic  social  services  was\nhampered and investor confidence fell. The urban poor have been driven by circumstances to\nbecome informal settlers and homeless, residing in danger zones such as riverbanks, foreshore,\nunder the bridges, beside the railways. A considerably higher proportion of households headed\nby  women  also  characterizes  the  urban  poor.  Deficiencies  in  urban  infrastructure  and  service\nlevels in Mindanao are significantly higher than the national average. The incidence of the use\nof  drinking  water  from  potentially  polluted  sources  is  24  percent  in  urban  Mindanao,  but  12\n\n\f73\n\nAppendix 15, page 2\n\npercent in the Philippines as a whole. Similarly, whereas almost 80 percent of households in the\nurban  Philippines  have  access  to  water-sealed  toilets,  only  60  percent  of  households  in\nMindanao  enjoy  such  facilities.  Lack  of  access  to  basic  services  and  infrastructure  has  a\nnegative impact on the productivity of urban economies and the already poor living conditions.\n\nB. \n\nSocial Impacts of the Project\n\n5.\nEmployment  and  Income.  A  number  of  the  subproject  components  will  have  a  direct\nimpact  on  permanent  employment  and  income-earning  opportunities.  Improvements  to  the\npublic market area in Kidapawan, for example, will increase the market share from its catchment\narea and lead to increased income for the market stallholders. Temporary employment will also\nbe  created  during  construction  of  the  subproject  components.  While  the  local  community  at\nlarge will benefit from basic services improvements, a positive distributional effect to the urban\npoor is also expected to occur. For example, a large proportion of the employment created by\nthe Project will be in low-skills jobs, which can be done by the urban poor.\n\n6.\nTime  Savings.  Improved  basic  services  can  save  communities  much  in  terms  of  time.\nThe  Dipolog  bypass  road,  for  example,  will  lead  to  travel  time  savings  for  vehicles  diverted  to\nthe  road;  it  will  also  lead  to  reduced  traffic  congestion  and  consequent  travel  time  savings  for\npeople  at  the  city  center.  The  Parang  water  supply  system  will  reduce  time  spent  in  carrying\nwater from outside sources to the home.\n\nHealth Benefits. Much of the basic infrastructure to be provided through the Project is\n7.\ndirectly  or  indirectly  linked  to  health  benefits.  Water  supply  is  a  basic  necessity  and,  as\nillustrated in Parang, people are willing to pay a high premium for it. Improved water quality can\nprevent disease and illness, the benefits of which need not be measured solely in reduced cost\nof medicine and days lost from work but also in reduced human discomfort and stress. Similar\nhealth benefits are expected from improved sanitation and garbage disposal, since solid waste\ndisposal  problems are often  more  acute in poorer areas. In projects such as improvements to\nwater supply, there may be greater health benefits to poor people as they would most likely use\nmore polluted sources of water without the proposed piped water supply system. Moreover, they\nwould probably have to travel shorter distances to obtain water. It is often the case that in terms\nof  felt  needs,  communities  are  unable  to  make  the  connection  between  lack  of  basic  services\nand health levels.\n\n8.\nGender  Impact.  There  is  often  a  positive  gender  distributional  effect.  In  the  case  of\nwater  supply  projects,  women  and  female  children  are  often  responsible  for  carrying  water  to\ntheir  homes.  Transportation  projects,  which  improve  movement  around  an  urban  area,  can\nbenefit women who are often responsible for food shopping, delivering goods to markets, and\naccessing  health  care  facilities  and  schools.  Public  market  projects  can  often  bring  a  positive\ngender distributional effect, since female heads of households frequently earn income as petty\ntraders in the public market. Better services with expansion of the public market area will have a\npositive gender impact.\n\n9.\nPeace  and  Order.  Mindanao  remains  one  of  the  poorest  areas  in  the  Philippines.\nPoverty  often  contributes  to  a  situation  of  social  unrest  and  disorder,  as  people  become\ndissatisfied  with  their  socioeconomic  conditions  and  their  inability  to  influence  change.\nImproving the social and economic situation of urban areas will contribute to a feeling of human\nwell-being and will promote peace and order.\n\nC. \n\nDemand and Willingness to Pay for Improved Infrastructure\n\n10.\nThe assessment for each subsector indicated that the need for an improved system was\nmatched  by  a  willingness  to  pay.  The  majority  of  beneficiaries  would  only  be  willing  to  pay  a\nprice similar to their current water bill, or a small proportion (10 percent) would be willing to pay\n\n\f74\n\nAppendix 15, page 3\n\nat the most up to 20 percent more than their current water bill. The survey from the core pilot\nLGUs  also  revealed  a  very  high  preference  (81  percent)  for  improved  sanitation  services.\nWillingness to pay for sanitation services is correspondingly high. Responses varied with regard\nto patterns of solid waste collection in the pilot areas. In Parang, where there is low satisfaction\nwith  current  waste  collection,  there  is  a  high  willingness  to  pay.  In  Kidapawan,  on  the  other\nhand, low satisfaction is not matched by a high willingness to pay. In Dipolog, the majority of the\nsurveyed  population  is  satisfied  with  links  to  the  provinces,  Mindanao,  and  the  rest  of  the\nPhilippines.  The  survey  asked  people  to  identify  public  buildings  and  facilities  that  they  would\nconsider  priority  areas  for  improvement.  In  the  entire  pilot  LGUs,  improvement  to  the  public\nmarket is the main area of concern. Other significant choices for improvement are the intercity\nbus terminal, main bus terminal, sea transport terminal, and sports center.\n\nD.\n\nParticipation of Community and Nongovernment Organizations\n\nSubproject  components  are  identified  through  public  consultations,  workshops,  and\n11.\nseminars  with  extensive  stakeholder  participation.  The  LGU  decision  on  the  selection  and\nprioritization  of  components  was  also  carried  out  in  a  participatory  manner,  involving  relevant\nstakeholders,  particularly  the  poor,  women,  and  local  civic  organizations.  A  community-based\nparticipatory  approach  to  project  planning  and  implementation,  which  is  built  on  community\npriority needs, will in general both maximize positive impacts and minimize negative impacts.\n\nE. \n\nUrban Services for the Poor\n\n12.\nAs  over  40  percent  of  poverty  incidence  is  common  and  wide  spread  in  LGUs  in\nMindanao,  most  subproject  interventions  will  serve  the  urban  poor  substantially  in  both  direct\nand  indirect  ways.  The  proposed  Project  includes  direct  intervention  and  indirect  incentive\nmechanisms  to  provide  urban  services  for  the  poor,  such  as  (i)  direct  participation  and\nrepresentation  of  the  poor  in  a  community  participatory  planning  approach  for  prioritizing\ninvestment  needs;  (ii)  up  to  25  percent  of  grant  financing  for  subproject  components  such  as\nsanitation,  drainage,  and  flood  protection  measures,  from  which  the  poor  living  in  flood-prone\nareas  would  benefit  significantly;  and  (iii)  priority  to  the  poor  in  hiring  laborers  in  construction\nactivities.  Other  components  will  indirectly  benefit  the  poor.  Improving  LGU-wide  infrastructure\nservices and the urban environment will enhance the general well-being and the quality of life\nfor poor communities.\n\nF.\n\nPotential Beneficiaries and Poverty Impact\n\n13.\nThe  economic  impact  of  the  Project  has  been  identified  as  more  employment\nopportunities and improved quality of living standards. The impact of the Project on poverty will\nvary  with  the  individual  components  proposed  and  executed  by  LGUs.  Most  of  the  subproject\ncomponents will directly benefit the primary beneficiaries and indirectly benefit the entire urban\npopulation of the LGU concerned.\n\nThe  total  population  of  the  urban  areas  in  the  108  LGUs  eligible  to  participate  in  the\n14.\nProject is estimated to be about 5 million. The total number of potential beneficiaries would be\nabout 2 million people, projecting about 40 percent LGUs participating in the Project. However,\nnot all of the 2 million would benefit to the same extent. The coverage of the project impact very\nmuch depends on individual components selected according to demand, as the Project adopted\na  sector  approach.  Since  urban  infrastructure  and  services  are  for  public  use  (except  water\nsupply  charging  fees  for  private  connection),  people  from  the  peri-urban  areas  as  well  as  the\nresidents  of  the  participating  LGUs  would  benefit.  Among  them,  more  than  one  third  (or  0.8\nmillion) of the beneficiaries are expected to be urban poor.\n\n15.\nBased on the infrastructure demand revealed by the indicative 13 LGUs, it is estimated\nthat the distribution of infrastructure investment would be (i) about 27 percent for public markets\n\n\f75\n\nAppendix 15, page 4\n\nand bus terminals, (ii) about 23 percent for roads and bridges, (iii) 14 percent for improvement\nof solid waste management, (iv) 6 percent for flood protection and sanitation, (v) 12 percent for\nwater supply, and (vi) about 18 percent for other public facilities.  Based on the analysis of three\ncore  pilot  subprojects,  the  needs  to  hire  low-skill  laborers  for  construction  activities  will  be\nalmost  20  percent  of  all  civil  works.  It  is  estimated  that  the  Project  will  generate  over  100,000\nperson-months of employment opportunities for the poor.
