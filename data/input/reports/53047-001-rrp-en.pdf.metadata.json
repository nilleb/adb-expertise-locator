It will do so by addressing key constraints that have limited \ngrowth  in  the  government  and  corporate  bond  markets.  In  addition,  the  program  launches  a \nfocused effort to broaden the contractual saving subsector (e.g. pensions, insurance, and mutual \nfunds). A vibrant and deep contractual saving sector provides a sustainable source of long-tenor \ninfrastructure finance and increases the country\u2019s resilience against external shocks. The program \nis consistent with the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2017\u20132022 and intersects with the first \ntwo  pillars  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country  partnership  strategy,  2018\u20132023:  \n(i)  accelerating  infrastructure  and  long-term  investments;  and  (ii)  promoting  local  economic \ndevelopment.1, 2 The  program  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  (para.  17  and  Table  1).3 \nThe Design and Monitoring framework (DMF) is in Appendix 1 and the policy matrix is in Appendix \n4. While the program had been planned since 2018, well before the coronavirus disease (COVID-\n19)  pandemic,  the  budgetary  financing  under  the  program  will  help  the  government\u2019s  overall \nincreased financing requirements due to the pandemic response.  \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe Philippines\u2019 economy has outperformed regional peers such as Indonesia, Malaysia, \nand  Thailand,  with  economic  growth  exceeding  6%  per  year  since  2012.  Under  the  PDP,  the \ngovernment  has  set  a  strategic  target  to  reach  upper  middle-income  status  by  2022,  with  an \naccompanying decline in the national poverty rate from 23.3% in 2015 to 14.0% in 2022 (footnote \n1). However, the Philippines\u2019 infrastructure deficit is large and acts as a constraint on achieving \nthese  goals.  In response, the  government  increased public spending  on  infrastructure  to  more \nthan 6% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2017 and 2018 under its signature Build, Build, Build \n(BBB) program. Yet, the government still faces a large infrastructure deficit. Based on earlier work \nby  ADB,  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  estimated  that  the \nPhilippines  will  require  \u20b124  trillion\u2013\u20b127  trillion,  or  roughly  \u20b12 trillion  per  year,  through  2030  to \nbridge the infrastructure gap and sustain the country\u2019s growth rate.4  \n \n4. \nDue largely to ongoing reforms to the government debt market, a diversified infrastructure \nfunding mix has been utilized under the BBB program.5 Issuance of government debt increased \nto \u20b11.1 trillion in 2018 from \u20b1810 billion in 2016, matching the increase in government spending \n\n \n\n1  Government of the Philippines, National Economic and Development Authority. 2017.

When compared against these needs, the carrying capacity of the domestic capital \nmarket is quite limited. The domestic fixed-income market represented only 35.7% of GDP as of \n31  December  2019,  well  below  the  Emerging  East  Asia  peer  average  of  83.3%  (Figure  1). \nGovernment debt outstanding is only half the size of the peer average, while the corporate debt \nmarket is only one-third the size of the peer average. Banks and private companies have been \nsupplying private capital for infrastructure but have reached their limits. Bank credit\u2013GDP ratio \nhas  increased,  corporate  leverage  for  listed  firms  now  exceeds  regional  comparators,  and  the \ncredit\u2013GDP gap (capturing the build-up of excessive credit) is approaching early warning levels.7 \n \n\nFigure 1: Finance Sector Composition \n \n\n800\n\n700\n\n600\n\nP\nD\nG\n\n \nf\no\n%\n\n \n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\nPhilippines\n\nThailand\n\nMalaysia\n\nIndonesia\n\nViet Nam\n\nSingapore\n\nEquity\nFixed Income\nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and World Bank. \n\nBanking\n\nPension, Insurance and Mutual Funds\n\n \n\n \n5. \nThe  contractual  savings  subsector  represents  a  natural  repository  for  long-tenor \ninvestments,  such  as  government  debt  and  infrastructure  finance.  However,  this  subsector  is \nunderdeveloped and has only played a limited role (Figure 1).8 Within the subsector, the insurance \nindustry is quite small and nascent. Premiums represented only 1.61% of GDP in 2016, a level \nwhich lags that of Thailand (5.20%) and Malaysia (4.10%). Similarly, pension funds are also small \nrelative to GDP. The limited scope of intermediation through contractual savings has constrained \nnot only the provision of long-term finance but also economic development. Research indicates \nthat finance sector development drives economic growth. However, in more developed markets, \nit is growth in contractual savings\u2014and insurance in particular\u2014that provides the largest boost to \ngrowth in real GDP per capita relative to other finance subsectors.9 A strong contractual savings \nsubsector provides not only critically needed long-term financing, but also a savings pool that can \nenable savers to build wealth and weather external shocks.  \n \n6. \nImpact of COVID-19. These development challenges have been recently compounded \nby the COVID-19 pandemic, which has serious economic and social consequences. GDP growth \nis  projected  to  contract  in  2020  as  compared  to  the  original  estimate  of  6.2%  growth  and  the \npoverty level is likely to worsen to 20.7% in 2020 from 16.6% in 2018. The infrastructure funding \ngap (para. 4) is likely to be exacerbated by the government\u2019s stimulus response to the COVID-19 \npandemic.  Measures  to  control  the  spread  of  the  pandemic,  both  globally  and  domestically, \n\n \n\n6   As of August 2019, debt issuances aggregated to \u20b11.2 trillion, but infrastructure expenditures lagged at \u20b1446 billion \n\nbecause of one-off delays in adopting the 2019 national budget. \n\n7  International Monetary Fund. 2018.

In previous programs (footnote 5), the government identified \nand addressed fundamental foundational constraints on the government debt market (para. 12). \nThe government will now begin addressing the next set of higher-order constraints. Grouped into \nthree  categories,  these  constraints  are  elaborated  below  in  paras.  8\u201310:  (i)  lack  of  strategic \noversight and a weak enabling environment; (ii) low liquidity and transparency, and nascent price \ndiscovery in the government bond market; and (iii) limited institutional participation in the capital \nmarket. \n \n8. \nCapital  market  development  efforts  in  the  Philippines  have  not  been  guided  by  any \noverarching framework as they have been in Malaysia and Thailand, where markets are now far \nmore advanced. The existing Capital Market Development Council, which is driven largely by the \nprivate sector, does not provide a wider market development objective. More consensus-driven \ncoordinated  action  is  required  amongst  various  institutions.  A  recently  constituted  informal \nworking  group  comprising  the  Bangko  Sentral  ng  Pilipinas  (BSP),  the  Bureau  of  the  Treasury \n(BTr), and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) must be formalized and its activities\u2014\nfocused on developing the government bond market\u2014successfully implemented. Looking forward, \na more comprehensive planning effort will be needed to progressively introduce complex products, \nincluding  in  the  contractual  savings  subsector.  Further,  the  enabling  environment  needs  to  be \nstrengthened. The charter of the BSP does not provide a mandate to ensure financial stability, a \nprerequisite for finance sector development. The payment system (a key foundation of the finance \nsector) has not been adequately regulated. The SEC\u2019s funding has long been inadequate, and \nthe Corporation Code has not been updated since 1980 and the Securities Regulation Code has \nnot  been  updated  since  2000.  These  constraints  increase  friction  costs,  inhibit  product \ndevelopment, and limit competition. \n \nAdditional  improvements  to  the  government  debt  market  are  necessary  to  ensure  that \n9. \ngreater amounts of government debt can be issued to finance the nation\u2019s long-term investment \nrequirements including the much-needed infrastructure. A reliable yield curve must be developed \nto serve as a pricing benchmark for the private sector to raise financing including infrastructure-\ndedicated  bonds.  The  government  must  (i)  encourage  more  trading  of  government  debt  to \ngenerate market-based pricing data, and (ii) upgrade systems to use that data to build a reliable \nyield curve. The government must also intensify efforts to issue bonds in only those tenors that \nactively trade and are used by the private sector as benchmarks. System upgrades are needed \nto increase efficiency, reliability, and interoperability, and to support a wider variety of participants, \nincluding tax-exempt contractual savings entities. A new yield curve calculation methodology is \nneeded as the current methodology is based on infrequently traded \u201cbellwether\u201d bonds. Reference \nto such bonds introduces volatility\u2014price changes by as much as 50 basis points in a single day\u2014\nwhich deters international investors and constrains the book-making process for corporate debt. \n \n10.  While institutional investors need to play a larger role in capital market development, the \ncontractual  savings  subsector  will  take  some  time  to  mature.  The  insurance  subsector  faces \nlimitations  in  what  it  can  buy  and  sell,  and  a  tedious  approval  process  remains  despite  the \nrelaxation  of  restrictive  investment  guidelines.  The  legal  framework  does  not  require  private \n\n10 Sector Assessment (Summary): Finance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\npensions to be fully funded. Public pensions have limited authority to raise contribution rates and \nface  widespread  noncompliance  by  employers  who  fail  to  fund  the  required  contributions. \nInvestment regimes are restrictive. Corporate bonds and notes represent just under 10% of total \nfinancial  assets  at  each  of  the  largest  public  pension  funds.  In  contrast,  the  California  State \nTeachers\u2019  Retirement  System  in  the  United  States  (US)  holds  30%  of  its  financial  assets  in \ncorporate  bonds  and  private  equity  investments  and  only  8%  in  government  bonds.  Foreign-\ndomiciled contractual savings institutions could provide an alternative source of demand for long-\ntenor  infrastructure-linked  investments.  However,  tax  costs,  including  the  final  withholding  tax \napplied  to  interest  (which  is  typically  not  refunded),  are  high  relative  to  comparator  countries, \nwhich  deters  investors.  In  addition,  the  government  has  not  taken  the  initiative  to  tap  offshore \nclimate or other specialty funds. \n \nB. \n \n11. \nThe government\u2019s reform program. The PDP underscores the government\u2019s emphasis \non inclusive growth and reducing poverty. With the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts will need to be \nsignificantly  scaled  up  to  achieve  these  goals.  Accordingly,  primary  emphasis  has  again  been \nplaced on investment. Prior to the current health emergency, the government announced plans \nto increase public spending on infrastructure to as high as 7.4% of GDP by 2022 and to encourage \ngreater  private  sector  participation  in  infrastructure. 11  With  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the \ngovernment has launched a substantial response package while maintaining critical infrastructure \nspending.  As  such,  it  is  imperative  that  the  government  (i)  modernize  and  strengthen  its  debt \nissuance processes to fund its increasing expenditure and infrastructure needs, and (ii) provide  \nmore reliable price discovery to anchor the private sector\u2019s efforts to raise complementary long-\nterm  infrastructure  financing.  Complementary  reforms  will  also  need  to  be  undertaken  to \nconsolidate outstanding issues, boost liquidity, and reduce costs so as to establish a reliable term \nstructure of interest rates (yield curve). In addition, the government will deploy integrated financial \nmarket infrastructure to promote efficiency in the trading, settlement, and delivery of securities. \n \n12. \nThe  programmatic  approach.  The  Encouraging  Investment  through  Capital  Market \nReforms  Program  (footnote  5)  set  the  stage  for  the  proposed  program  by  adopting  a  more \nstructured  and  sequenced  approach to developing  the  domestic  capital market.  Long-standing \nfoundational reforms were addressed. The cash and investment management functions, as well \nas the technical capacity of the BTr, were strengthened. The BTr upgraded and modernized its \noperations,  and  initiatives  were  launched  to  improve  the  reliability  of  market-generated  bond \npricing data. The government also began improving the legal framework and engaging with the \ncontractual  savings  subsector.  The  proposed  programmatic  approach  now  advances  these \nfoundational reforms, triggering a significant increase in government bond trading volumes and \ncorporate issuance, and launches a more focused effort to include the contractual savings sector \nin the government\u2019s development objectives. A programmatic approach provides for a long-term \nbut flexible engagement, a modality well-suited to capital market development. \n \n13. \nProposed policy reforms. The program\u2019s impact is aligned with the PDP and will help \nthe government achieve its targeted public spending covering both the COVID-19 response and \nmedium-term  infrastructure  development.  The  program  will  (i)  help  the  government  fund  its \nexpenditures  at  lower  relative  costs,  and  (ii)  enable  the  private  sector  to  fund  infrastructure \nthrough the capital markets. The program will also help increase financial resilience by growing \nthe contractual savings sector. The program consists of two subprograms and has three reform \nareas: (i) strategic oversight and the enabling environment; (ii) liquidity, transparency, and price \n\n11 On 11 December 2019, the Development Budget Coordination Committee adopted a 6.5%\u20137.5% growth target for \n\n2020\u20132022 with infrastructure appropriations expected to represent 5.9% of GDP. \n\n \n\n\fdiscovery in the government bond market; and (iii) institutional participation in the capital markets. \nA third subprogram may be added during processing of subprogram 2 (para. 24). \n \n14. \nStrategic  oversight  and the  enabling  environment.  Under  this reform  area,  stronger \nstrategic  guidance  has  been  provided  by  the  government  to  market  development,  and  the \nenabling environment has been improved. Under subprogram 1, the BSP, the BTr, and the SEC \nformalized their working group and implemented the Philippines\u2019 first coordinated capital market \ndevelopment plan with an immediate focus on liquidity, price discovery, efficiency, and oversight \nof the government bond market. The charter of the BSP was amended in February 2019 to provide \na mandate for financial stability, expand the BSP\u2019s policy toolkit by restoring the central bank\u2019s \nauthority  to  issue  its  own  debt  papers  as  part  of  its  regular  monetary  operations,  and  provide \nfinancial supervision staff with qualified immunity. Congress adopted a law to provide the BSP \nwith the authority to supervise all payment systems. The corporation code was revised to simplify \ncorporate  actions  and  reduce  associated  costs.  The  revised  code  also  provides  for  quasi-\nindependent funding, and includes provisions allowing the SEC to revoke a corporation\u2019s charter \nfor corrupt practices. Under subprogram 2, the government plans to implement a broader, longer-\nterm  capital  market  development  plan  which  includes  the  private  and  contractual  savings \nsubsectors. The BSP and the SEC plan to adopt implementing regulations to make operational \nthe legal reforms completed under subprogram 1. \n \nLiquidity, transparency, and price discovery in the government bond market. Under \n15. \nthis  reform  area,  increased  priority  spending\u2014including  infrastructure\u2014was  facilitated  by \nenabling increased issuance of government debt at lower relative cost, and by providing a reliable \nyield curve for pricing private sector debt. Under subprogram 1, the BTr has reversed a 3-year \ndecline  in  trading  volumes  and  provided  more  reliable  market-generated  data.  It  concentrated \n100% of the government\u2019s domestic issuance into five key tenor buckets, encouraged competition \nthrough  10  \u201cmarket  makers\u201d  as  part  of  its  enhanced  primary  dealer  system,  and  introduced \nhedging mechanisms to facilitate eventual two-way price quotes. To better utilize the data and to \nreduce transaction costs, the government replaced its outdated domestic trading platform with a \nvendor-supplied  system  (Bloomberg  E-bond)  and  replaced  the  current  yield  curve  calculation \nmethodology (R2) with a globally accepted system which employs machine learning (Bloomberg \nBval).  Supplementing  these  reforms,  the  BTr  launched  the  new  National  Registry  of  Scripless \nSecurities  (nRoSS)  and  associated  primary  auction  system.  The  system  is  efficient  and  can \nimplement the pending changes in tax law by facilitating the entry of new tax-exempt participants \n(international  contractual  savings  institutions)  in  the  government  securities  market.  Under \nsubprogram  2,  the  government  plans  to  complete  its  transition  to  an  over-the-counter  self-\nregulated market by issuing the necessary market conduct guidelines. The BTr plans to require \nthe primary dealers to publish and execute on firm two-way price quotes, and will expand nRoSS \nto accommodate new products, including repos and floating rate notes. \n \nInstitutional participation in the capital market. This reform area encourages greater \n16. \nparticipation by international institutional investors while concurrently launching the development \nof a domestic institutional investor base. Under subprogram 1, the government submitted a bill to \nCongress to reduce taxes to encourage more international investors and to remove tax arbitrage \nbetween finance subsectors. The SEC targeted pools of international investment funds by issuing \nregulations  to  support  the  issuance  of  \u201cgreen  bonds\u201d.  To  encourage  demand  from  domestic \ninstitutional investors, Congress amended the Social Security Act to increase the contribution rate, \nbroaden membership, and provide more flexibility in investment decisions by the Social Security \nSystem. The Insurance Commission issued detailed guidance allowing insurance companies to \ninvest in infrastructure projects included in the PDP. The BSP launched an initiative to streamline \nand  modernize  the  Personal  Equity  and  Retirement  Account  (PERA)  by  incorporating  the \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fseamless  issue  of  tax  exemptions  by  the  Bureau  of  Internal  Revenue  and  enabling  mobile \ninterfaces.  On  the  supply  side,  the  government  eased  regulatory  restrictions,  resulting  in  the \nissuance of \u20b1294 billion in notes under approved shelf registrations aggregating to \u20b1507 billion. \nThis included the first issue of \u20b115 billion in green bonds by a banking conglomerate (1 February \n2019). Moreover, the SEC approved a \u20b11 billion issuance by Aeon Credit Services Philippines, \nthe first debentures issued in the Philippines under the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \nplus  three  (ASEAN+3)  Multi-Currency  Bond  Issuance  Framework.  Under  subprogram  2,  the \ngovernment will adopt and implement the revised tax code. The BSP plans to complete upgrades \nto  the  PERA  and  implement  its  growth  plan.  The  Social  Security  System  plans  to  issue \nimplementing  rules  and regulations  and  the  Insurance  Commission  plans to  further  encourage \nthe insurance subsector to support infrastructure. The BSP and SEC will encourage additional \ncorporate issuances and listings by foreign entities domiciled in the Philippines. \n \n\nFigure 2: ADB\u2019s Engagement in Capital Market Development in the Philippines \n\n1998\u20132001: \nFirst Nonbank Financial \nGovernance Program\nTA: Strengthening Regulation \nand Market Governance\n\n1992\u20131998:\nFirst Capital Market \nDevelopment Program\nTA: Stock Market Development\n\n2005\u20132011:  \nFinancial Market Regulation and \nIntegration Program \nTA: Capacity Development of \nFinancial Regulators \n\n2017\u20132021:  \nSupport to Capital Market-\nGenerated Infrastructure \nFinancing Program \n\n2001\u20132003: \nSecond Nonbank \nFinancial Governance \nProgram \nTA: Support for Nonbank \nFinancial Governance II\n\n2013\u20132017: \nEncouraging Investment through \nCapital Market Reforms Program\nTA: Strengthening Treasury\u2019s \nLiquidity Management \nTA: Strengthening Treasury \nOperations and Capital Market \nReform\n\n \n\n TA = technical assistance. \n Source: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nStrategy 2030 Priorities \nStrengthening governance \nand institutional capacity \n\nFostering regional cooperation \nand integration \n\nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \n\nProgram \nThe program will improve the capacity of the government to run and administer its \ngovernment  debt  market.

ADB  has  supported  finance  sector  reforms  with  five  programmatic \nPBLs and substantial technical assistance (TA) (Figure 2). ADB initially focused on building the \nequity market. Responding to the 1997 financial crisis, ADB supported the government\u2019s efforts \nto  strengthen  governance,  improve  the  SEC,  implement  investor  protection  measures,  and \ndevelop an anti-money-laundering function. Beginning in 2005, ADB supported the development \nof the fixed-income market but revised its focus to financial stability in response to the 2008 global \nfinancial crisis. Given the lessons learned and the government\u2019s emerging focus on infrastructure, \nADB instituted a coordinated and sequenced approach in 2013 (footnote 5) to further develop the \ndomestic  capital  market.  These  reforms  also  sought  to  begin  building  a  more  diversified \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\finstitutional investor base to encourage the provision of long-term finance for infrastructure. This \nprogrammatic  approach  continues  these  reforms  and  introduces  transition  to  a  more  focused \neffort to develop the contractual savings subsector as a natural buyer of the newly developing \nlong-term financing instruments. The program is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (Table 1) and \nis  fully  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  broader  support  to  the  government\u2019s  infrastructure  agenda.  For \nexample,  ADB  has  supported  infrastructure  development  by  supporting  reforms  to  the  public\u2013\nprivate partnership framework, including policy-based financing,12 and TA.13 In addition, ADB has \napproved  a  TA  loan  to  support  the  preparation  of  large,  complex  infrastructure  projects,  and \nADB\u2019s country operations business plan lists direct lending support to infrastructure of $2.6 billion \nin 2019 and $2.0 billion in 2020 (footnote 2). 14 \n \n18. \nLessons  learned.  ADB\u2019s  long-term  engagement  helped  inform  the  program  through \nseveral key lessons learned. First, success in developing a local currency finance sector depends \non (i) sound macroeconomic policies and debt management strategies, (ii) a diversified investor \nbase, (iii) a sound legal framework, and (iv) modern, reliable, and efficient infrastructure. Given \nthe  wide  variety  of  stakeholders  involved  in  these  areas,  the  use  of  coordinated  planning  and \nexecution is likely to produce better results. Second, finance sector reforms are complex, have a \nmedium- to long-term gestation period, and require proper sequencing. Programs should exhibit \nsufficient  flexibility  to  accommodate  a  medium-  to  long-term  development  horizon  and  the \ninevitable  changes  which  occur  when  dealing  with  complex  reform  areas.  Third,  the  full \ndevelopment  of  a  domestic  capital  market  requires  a  large  and  vibrant  contractual  savings \nsubsector to provide demand for longer-tenor financing instruments to match their longer-tenor \nliabilities. Given the unique characteristics of this subsector, dedicated programs will eventually \nbe needed to address its unique development needs.  \n \n19. \nADB\u2019s value addition to the program. The engagement highlights the benefits of a One \nADB  approach  with  extensive  development  partner  coordination.  This  coordination  covers  the \ndrafting and implementation of the government\u2019s first capital market development plan, the launch \nof  the  nRoSS,  the  PERA  upgrade,  enhancements  to  the  payment  system,  green  bond \nguidelines,15 and the repo market, all of which were supported by ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Regional \nDepartment  and  development  partners  (para.  20).16 ADB\u2019s  Economic  Research  and  Regional \nCooperation Department provided support through the ASEAN+3 Multi-Currency Bond Issuance \nProgram,  while  ADB\u2019s  Philippines  Country  Office  has  been  instrumental  in  supporting  the \ncompletion of a comprehensive overhaul of the tax code. Finally, ADB\u2019s Treasury Department, \nalong with the Southeast Asia Regional Department, activated ADB\u2019s existing tax exemption and \ncollaborated to obtain approvals for an offshore issue of  US dollar\u2013peso-linked notes by ADB. \nThis issuance allowed ADB to invest in and support the domestic currency bond market and to \nmake local currency lending available to the government. \n \n\n \n\n12 ADB.  2015.

Manila. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fImpacts of the Reform \n\nDevelopment  partner  coordination.  Active  development  partners  include  the  US \n20. \nTreasury and the International Monetary Fund. The anchor for the program is the medium-term \ncapital market development plan. The development of this document represents a collaboration \nbetween  the  above  development  partners  and  the  BSP,  the  BTr,  and  the  SEC.  The  reform \nprogram, which has essentially been completed, is largely reflected in the reform areas (paras. \n14\u201316).  In  supporting  the  implementation  of  the  plan,  a  clear  but  cooperative  delineation  of \nresponsibility  has  been  maintained.  The  US  Treasury  Office  of  Technical  Assistance  provides \nsupport  to  the  development  of  the  primary  and  secondary  government  bond  market  and  its \nsupporting  infrastructure.  ADB  complements  this  support  with  TA  designed  to  complete  the \nsupplementary  reforms  necessary  to  develop  the  market.  The  International  Monetary  Fund  is \nproviding assistance on monetary management and liberalizing the foreign exchange regime. \n \nC. \n \n21. \nThe  impact  of  the  program  is  aligned  with  the  country\u2019s  target  for  spending  on  public \ninfrastructure of 7.4% of GDP and private sector participation in infrastructure increased. It will \nenlarge the government debt market, allowing the government to fund its priority programs while \npaving way to facilitate long-term financing in general. The effect of the reforms will be increased \navailability  of  long-term  finance  for  infrastructure  which  will  be  demonstrated  through  the \nperformance indicators in the DMF. Corporate bonds outstanding will increase to at least 12% of \nGDP, government bonds held by the contractual savings sector to 35% of the total outstanding, \nand corporate debt held by public pension funds to 15% of total financial assets held by the funds. \nCurrently, corporate entities raise funding for infrastructure primarily through generic bond issues \nunder the corporate name and do not disclose fund raising by use. This is expected to change \nover time which will provide better tracking mechanisms for use in the DMF. In the interim, the \ncurrent performance indicators represent the best available proxies. \n \n22. \nEmpirical  research  produces  a  remarkably  consistent  narrative.  Finance  sector \ndevelopment  exerts  a  first-order  impact  on  long-run  economic  growth (footnote  9).  The reform \npackage of subprogram 1 increased the borrowing capacity of the government and the private \nsector, thereby allowing for a faster rate of investment and higher GDP growth. This will help the \ngovernment  achieve  its  targeted  public  spending  and  encourage  greater  private  sector \nparticipation in infrastructure. Assuming a gradual increase in the size of the debt market, total \ncapital  investment  is  expected  to  grow  at  11%  per  annum  in  real  terms  and  deliver  over  \n\u20b128 trillion in infrastructure expenditure over the next 10 years. The reforms will be instrumental \nin meeting the infrastructure deficit and help sustain higher GDP growth in the medium to long \nrun.  The  larger  base  of  infrastructure  and  private  capital  generated  over  this  period  will \npermanently raise productivity and potential output per capita, lifting potential income.17 \n \nD. \n \nThe government has requested a regular loan of $400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \n23. \nresources to help finance  subprogram  1.  The  loan will  have a 15-year  term,  including  a grace \nperiod of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the annuity repayment \nmethod, the  average  maturity  is  12.1 years,  and no  maturity  premium  is payable to  ADB.  The \nindicative loan amount for subprogram 2 is $300 million. The Philippines\u2019 total financing needs for \n2018\u20132021 were expected to be substantial with annual budget deficits of 3.0% of GDP or larger. \nHowever, due to the adverse impact of COVID-19, the government\u2019s 2020 financing requirement \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\n17 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fImplementation Arrangements \n\nis expected to increase to \u20b11.9 trillion ($37.6 billion) from \u20b11.4 trillion. Domestic borrowing will \nincrease  by  \u20b174.7  billion  and  foreign  borrowing  will  increase  by  \u20b1129.2  billion  ($2.6  billion)  to \nfinance its COVID-19 response program. The size of subprogram 1 reflects the government\u2019s total \nfinancing needs, the strength of the program, and its economic benefits (para. 22).18  \n \nE. \n \n24. \nThe Department of Finance (DOF) is the executing agency. The BSP, the BTr, and the \nSEC are the implementing agencies. The implementation period is July 2017\u2013September 2019 \nfor subprogram 1, and October 2019\u2013December 2021 for subprogram 2. A steering committee \nchaired  by  the  DOF,  with  the  implementing  agencies  as  members,  will  oversee  the  program. \nBased on the progress made, the quality of the next phase of capital development planning, and \nconsultations with the government, a third subprogram may be added during the processing of \nsubprogram 2. If added, this third subprogram will cover January 2022\u2013March 2024 and will reflect \nand  ensure  a  continuity  of  reforms  within  the  contractual  savings  sector  which  provide  for  an \nimmediate  expansion  of  the  sector  or  an  increased  uptake  of  long-term  finance  to  support \ninfrastructure.  The  proceeds  of  the  PBL  will  be  withdrawn  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \nSafeguards.  The  program  does  not  trigger  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (SPS) \n25. \npolicy  principles  and  requirements  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous \npeoples. It is classified as category C for environment, involuntary resettlement and indigenous \npeoples following ADB\u2019s SPS 2009. \n \n26. \nPoverty  and  social.  The  program  contributes  to  poverty  reduction  by  increasing  fiscal \nresources  available  for  both  infrastructure  and  social  expenditures.  Increased  investment  in \ninfrastructure  will  lead  to  increased  connectivity,  in  turn  boosting  employment  and  reducing \ninequality. Increased intermediation through the contractual savings subsector has been shown \nto  boost  real  GDP  per  capita,  especially  in  more  developed  countries  such  as  the  Philippines \n(footnote 9). The program complements an ADB\u2019s ongoing efforts to increase financial inclusion \nand literacy and provides an entry point for coordinated reforms to encourage retirement savings \nthrough future engagements. The program is categorized as having no gender elements because \nof  its  focus  on  foundational  capital  market  development,  including  infrastructure  and  debt \nissuance, which is widely beneficial to all stakeholders. However, the program clearly holds the \npotential  to  generate  direct  benefits  for  women.  The  revised  Social  Security  Act  provides \nadditional benefits to overseas Filipino workers, 56% of whom are women.19 \n \n27. \nGovernance. A public expenditure and financial accountability assessment conducted in \n2017  found  three  of  seven  core  public  financial  management  areas  (policy-based  budgeting, \ntransparency, and asset\u2013liability management) have improved and are considered strong. Efforts \nto improve budget credibility, predictability, execution, and external scrutiny and audit are ongoing. \nThe  government  is  implementing  a  results-based  anticorruption  plan  to  strengthen  the  judicial \nbranch of  the  government  and  the Office of the Ombudsman.  Reforms  under the  program  will \ncontinue to strengthen  public  financial  management  by  improving  cash  and  debt  management \nwithin  the  BTr.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained to  and \ndiscussed with the government and the DOF. \n \n\n18 The loan may be disbursed in one or more installments. \n19 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fRisks and mitigating measures. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized \n28. \nin Table 2 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.20 The overall \ninherent risk was assessed to be moderate. Substantial risks include the COVID-19 pandemic, \nglobal  trade  and  macroeconomic  conditions,  increased  budget  deficits,  and  changes  in  key \npersonnel. Key but potentially costly reforms, such as pre-funding pensions, may be resisted by \nvested interests and be difficult to achieve. Risks will be mitigated through macro fiscal measures, \nrelated legislative reforms, consensus building, and capacity building.  \n \n\nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nThe COVID-19 pandemic lasts longer or causes a \ndeeper contraction than expected. \nAdverse global trade or macroeconomic conditions \ndepress economic activity and the supply of and/or \ndemand for capital market products. \nBudget deficits increase beyond current levels and \ncompromise the Philippines\u2019 credit rating, reducing \nthe attractiveness of its debt. \nPersonnel changes within the BSP, BTr, and SEC \ncoupled with the broadening of the capital market \nplanning effort complicate implementation.   \nPension  reform  is  held  back  by  vested  interests \nbecause of the cost of the initiatives. \nBSP  =  Bangko  Sentral  ng  Pilipinas,  BTr  =  Bureau  of  the  Treasury,  COVID-19  =  coronavirus  disease,  SEC  \n= Securities and Exchange Commission, TRAIN = Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion Act. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nMitigation Measures \nThe  government  has  crafted  a  comprehensive  COVID-19 \nresponse plan including economic support initiatives. \nThe  government  will  mitigate  these  risks  by  maintaining  a \nsound  macroeconomic  footing  through  pro-growth  policies, \ncontrol of inflation, and open trade policies. \nThe government has mitigated this risk by strengthening debt \nmanagement systems and closely monitoring debt levels, as \nwell as the potential on the nation\u2019s credit rating. \nThis  risk  is  being  mitigated  by  utilizing  the  capital  market \nplanning  group  (BSP,  BTr,  SEC,  key  development  partners, \nand the private sector) to guide and implement the reforms. \nRisk  mitigation  will  be  provided  by  supporting  an  industry \nproposal for pension reform which has political sponsorship. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n29. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in the loan agreement. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  programmatic  approach  and  policy-based  loan  would \n30. \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend \nthat the Board approve: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nfor \n\nthe  Support \n\nto  Capital  Market-Generated \n\nthe\u202fprogrammatic  approach \nInfrastructure Financing Program; and \n \nthe  policy-based  loan  of  $400,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for \nsubprogram 1 of the Support to Capital Market-Generated Infrastructure Financing \nProgram, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to \nbe determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; for a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n\n5 May 2020 \n\n \n\n20 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objective: Target for spending on public infrastructure of 7.4% \nof  GDP  achieved  and  private  sector  participation  in  infrastructure  increased  (Philippine  Development \nPlan, 2017\u20132022).a \n\n \n\nResults Chain \n\nEffect of the Reform \nAvailability of long-\nterm finance for \ninfrastructure \nincreasedb \n\nReform Areas under \nSubprogram 1 \n1.
