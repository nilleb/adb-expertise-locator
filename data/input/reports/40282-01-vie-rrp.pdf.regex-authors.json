This led to approval of \nan  initial  loan  of  SDR34.7  million  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of \nViet Nam in November 2006, as emergency assistance to support \nthe  Government\u2019s  response  to  calamitous  damage  to  rural \ninfrastructure caused by a series of typhoons and storms in 2005. \nThe  Project  is  aimed  at  (i) reinstating  essential  infrastructure, \nincluding roads, flood protection, irrigation systems, and social \ninfrastructure in the 10 provinces that were severely affected by \ntyphoons  and  storms  in  2005;  and  (ii)  providing  equivalent  or \nenhanced storm and flood protection to vulnerable areas where \nfeasible. Project implementation was initially deficient, with delays \nexposing  investments  already  committed  under  the  Project  to \nfurther damages from typhoons and storms in 2006 and 2007. \nProject implementation has also been affected by cost increases \ncaused  by  high  inflation  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economy.  However, \nimplementation progress has improved markedly in recent times, \nespecially  since  the  mobilization  of  project  implementation \nconsultants in June 2008. \n   \nRationale  At appraisal, the Project comprised 89 subprojects (39 priority and \n50  additional  subprojects).  Subsequently,  with  the  delays  in \nproject start-up and given the urgency of some, 16 subprojects \nwere carried out using government funds. Thus, the total number \nof subprojects was reduced to 73 and reprioritized into 47 priority \nand  26  additional  subprojects.  With  recent  high  inflation  and \ngreatly  increased  costs  for  civil  works,  materials,  and  labor\u2014\ncompounded by additional damages to infrastructure caused by \ntyphoons and storms in 2006 and 2007\u2014many of the subprojects \nnow have total cost estimates that significantly exceed the original \nestimates.  \n ", "ii   \n \n  The Government is trying to respond to this situation through a \nreduction in the number of subprojects and by providing additional \ncounterpart financing. However, given the size and significance of \nthe price escalation, and the Government\u2019s inability to provide the \nfull  amount  of  additional  financing,  a  further  reduction  in  the \nnumber of subprojects may threaten the Project\u2019s viability. Without \nsupplementary financing, there would be a significant financing \ngap that would put much of the investment to date at risk. Partially \ncompleted structures could either be lost or be unable to provide \ntheir  expected  protective  function  while  awaiting  finance  for \ncompletion from other sources. This would also militate against \nsustaining agricultural productivity in the project areas. \n \nAt least 13 priority subprojects also require design enhancements \nto reduce risk and vulnerability, and ensure adequate safety for \npeople living in the area and for the sustainability of the capital \ninvestments committed to rural infrastructure rehabilitation.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project, as stated in the original design and \nmonitoring framework, is sustained economic growth in the areas \naffected  by  typhoons  in  2005.  The  original  outcome  is  rapid \nresumption  of  livelihoods  and  reduced  vulnerability  to  natural \ndisasters in the affected areas. While it has not been rapid, the \nsupplementary  financing  will  contribute  to  the  resumption  of \nlivelihoods and reduced vulnerability to natural disasters. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The estimated cost of the supplementary financing is $30 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $3.3 million. The total revised project \ncost is estimated to be $93.9 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan  Supplementary financing of $25.5 million (SDR17.085 million to \nsupplement the $50.97 million agreed in 2006) will be provided \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to provide supplementary \nfinancing  for  the  Project.  The  supplementary  financing  will  be \nsubject to the same terms and conditions as the initial loan, and \nthe repayment schedule of the supplementary financing will be \nsynchronized with that of the initial loan, which has a term of \n40 years, including a grace period of 10 years, an interest rate of \n1% per year, and repayment of principal at 2% a year for the first \n10 years after the grace period and 4% a year thereafter, and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  Loan  Agreement,  as \namended for purposes of the supplementary financing. The initial \nloan was approved on 21 November 2006. The Government\u2019s \ncontribution from local sources to the supplementary financing will \nbe $4.5 million, including all taxes and duties. The Borrower will \nbe the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2011 \n   \n ", "iii \nEstimated Project  30 June 2011 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) \n   \nImplementation  The current implementation arrangements will be maintained for \nArrangements  the  supplementary  financing.  MARD  has  delegated  the  main \nresponsibilities  for  project  execution  to  the  Central  Project \nManagement  Unit  (CPMU)  in  MARD\u2019s  Agriculture  Projects \nManagement Board. The provincial people\u2019s committees (PPCs) \nin the provinces where the Project is located are the implementing \nagencies and, through the provincial departments of agriculture \nand  rural  development  (DARDs),  subprojects  are  selected, \nprepared,  and  implemented.  Each  DARD  has  established  a \nprovincial  project  management  unit  (PPMU)  under  its  direct \nadministration to carry out the works.  \n \nDelays in project implementation have provided lessons that will \nbe  applied  to  improve  performance  that  include  (i)  setting \ndeadlines for design procedures, after which subprojects will not \nbe  eligible  for  consideration  of  financing  under  the  loan; \n(ii) accelerating training, which will be provided in each project \nprovince and improving effectiveness by including PPMUs, PPCs, \nDARDs, and contractors; (iii) prior review and endorsement of \nsubproject designs for flood protection projects by CPMU, with \nassistance  from  the  project  implementation  consultants; \n(iv) assessment of a minimum of two alternatives for the feasibility \nstudies of subprojects; and (v) increased mobilization advances \nfor construction contractors to prepurchase materials.  \n \nCPMU will create a database of all subproject contracts, including \nthe contract adjustments that can be included in project reports, to \nensure  that  an  up-to-date  reconciliation  of  \u201cavailable  funds\u201d  is \nmaintained. The database will be used as the basis for deciding \non the use of unutilized funds according to the following priorities: \n(i) given high price escalation, completion or upgrading of priority \nsubprojects to a sustainable standard; (ii) completion of priority \nsubprojects through enhanced technical design to ensure safety \nconditions of structures, protection of human life, and protection of \nessential infrastructure; and (iii) additional subprojects that meet \nthe required selection criteria. \n   \n ", "iv   \n \nProcurement  The  current  procurement  conditions  will  be  maintained  for  the \nsupplementary financing. Civil works and related services will be \nprocured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Most civil works contracts \nare estimated to cost less than $2 million and are being procured \nthrough  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  procedures.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  standard  bidding  documents  and  procedures \ncomply closely with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and are being \nused for this purpose. Postqualification or the national contractor's \nregistration and/or classification system has been used for NCB \ncontracts. The bidding period is 21 days. Prior review by ADB of \ninvitations to bid, bidding documents, and bid evaluation reports \nwas  required  for  the  first  NCB  contract  in  each  province. \nSubsequently, retroactive approval procedures were followed. In \ncases where, for any reason, ADB does not approve the award or \nterms of contract, the Government is required to use its own funds \nto finance the contract or to refund to ADB any payments already \nmade from loan funds for that contract. \n   \nConsulting Services  A team of international and national consultants, with expertise in \nnatural disaster risk assessment, engineering investigations and \ndesign,  geotechnical  engineering,  economic  and  financial \nanalyses,  and  social  and  environmental  aspects  was  recruited \nunder  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time) to assist with implementation of the \nProject, and will be maintained for its extended duration. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  major  beneficiaries  previously  identified  were  about \nBeneficiaries  450,000 residents of remote areas of the project provinces that \nwill benefit directly from improved access to markets, schools, and \nother services; rapid resumption of income-earning activities; and \ngreater security from natural disasters. In the priority subprojects, \nthe Project will reinstate (i) protection and irrigation infrastructure \nserving about 18,300 hectares (ha) of land; (ii) 211 kilometers \n(km) of rural roads (including 67 culverts and 5 bridges); (iii) about \n98  km  of  sea  dikes  and  flood  protection  embankments;  and \n(iv) construction  of  1,820  square  meters  (m2)  for  schools  and \nmarkets.  Based  on  risk  and  vulnerability  assessments, \nrehabilitated structures will have higher resistance to floods, storm \nsurge, waves, and other typhoon-related impacts (including larger \nconveyance capacity for bridges and better slope protection on \nsea  dikes  and  flood  protection  embankments).  The  causes  of \nfailure will be examined to ensure better design standards where \nnecessary,  and  the  completed  works  will  be  integrated  into  a \ndatabase linked to provincial disaster preparedness plans. \n   \n ", "v \nRisks and Assumptions  The risks and assumptions relating to supplementary financing \nare  (i)  continued  delays  to  implementation,  leading  to  cost \noverruns; (ii) an attempt to complete too many subprojects by \nreducing the scale or technical design standards; and (iii) further \ndamages  during  the  implementation  period.  Delayed \nimplementation could arise from the amount of time required to \ncomplete the adjustment to each priority subproject contract to \ntake into account inflation and any required improvement to the \nexisting design specifications. The reduced scope of dikes and \nembankments  severely  reduces  their  effectiveness  and  often \ncreates  significant  risk  of  damage  to  the  partially  completed \nstructure. Measures are being taken to prevent recurrence of such \npractices.  Finally,  prolonged  design  periods  have  resulted  in \nadditional damages to sites. For embankments where there is \nriver  action  every  flood  season,  this  results  in  significant  site \nchanges that require additional design and technical inputs.   \n   \nTechnical Assistance  A technical assistance (TA) grant will be provided for advisory \nassistance to the Government in Geo-Information Technology for \nHazard Risk Assessment. The total cost of the TA is $625,000, \nout  of  which  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge \nPartnership Fund will provide a grant of $500,000 equivalent to be \nadministered  by  ADB,  while  the  Government  will  provide  the \nbalance  of  $125,000  in  kind.  The  TA  will  support  increased \ndisaster preparedness to mitigate the worst impacts of climate \nchange through the provision of staff training for MARD\u2019s Disaster \nManagement Center and the Water Resources University (WRU) \non  the  use  of  advanced  technology  such  as  geographic \ninformation systems (GIS) and remote sensing. \n \n ", "", "    \n \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nsupplementary loan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Emergency Rehabilitation of \nCalamity  Damage  Project.  The  report  also  describes  proposed  administration  of  technical \nassistance (TA) for Geo-Information Technology for Hazard Risk Assessment, and if the Board \napproves the proposed supplementary loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, will approve the administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of technical \nassistance to be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge \nPartnership Fund. \n \nII.  THE APPROVED PROJECT \nA.  Project Rationale \n2.  Flooding triggered by typhoons and storms is the most prevalent and serious natural \ndisaster in Viet Nam, which ranks among the top five most impacted countries to climate change \nand fourth in the world behind the People\u2019s Republic of China, India, and Bangladesh in terms \nof the absolute number of people living in vulnerable, low elevation coastal zones. In 2005, \ntropical storms and typhoons affected large parts of Viet Nam, causing loss of life and extensive \ndamage in 16 provinces. Many types of infrastructure that are critical to the livelihoods of poor \nrural  households  were  destroyed  in  the  10  most  seriously  affected  provinces:  Ha  Giang, \nHa Tinh, Nam Dinh, Nghe An, Phu Tho, Phu Yen, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thanh Hoa, and \nYen Bai (the project provinces).  \n \n3.  Following a damage and needs assessment, and in response to the Government\u2019s \nrequest, a project following a sector-like approach was designed.1 This led to approval of an \nemergency assistance loan (the initial loan) to finance the Emergency Rehabilitation of Calamity \nDamage Project (the Project).  \n \nB.  Objectives and Scope \n4.  The Project\u2019s impact will be sustained economic growth in the project provinces severely \naffected by typhoons in 2005. Its outcome will be rapid resumption of livelihoods and reduced \nvulnerability to natural disasters in the affected areas. This is being achieved by (i) reinstating \nessential  infrastructure,  including  roads,  flood  protection,  irrigation  systems,  and  social \ninfrastructure; and (ii) concurrently providing equivalent or enhanced storm and flood protection \nto vulnerable areas where feasible. \n \n5.  The Project\u2019s outputs are rehabilitated and strengthened infrastructure in four sectors: \n(i) flood protection, (ii) irrigation, (iii) roads and bridges, and (iv) social services. The Project \nfinances  (i)  contracts for  civil  works;  (ii)  contracts  with  national  consulting firms  that  have \nrecently worked or are currently working in the affected districts for feasibility study and detailed \ndesign; and (iii) a contract with a team of international and national consultants for technical, \nsocial,  and  environmental  review.  The  project  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1.2 \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2006.

Only the performance targets and \n ", "2   \n \n \nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n6.  At the time of project appraisal in 2006, the total investment cost was estimated at \n$59.89 million, including taxes and duties of $5.8 million. The Government requested a loan of \n$50.97 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the Project. The \nLoan  Agreement  for  the  initial  loan  was  signed  on  7  December  2006.  The  initial  Loan \nAgreement has a 40-year term, including a grace period of 10 years, an interest rate of 1% per \nyear, and repayment of principal at 2% a year for the first 10 years after the grace period and \n4% a year thereafter. The Government\u2019s contribution from local sources was estimated to be \n$8.92 million. The Borrower is the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. \n \nD.  Status of and Progress in Project Implementation \n7.  The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) is the Executing Agency and \nhas delegated the main responsibilities for project execution to the Central Project Management \nUnit  (CPMU)  in  MARD\u2019s  Agriculture  Projects  Management  Board.  The  provincial  people\u2019s \ncommittees (PPCs) in the project provinces are the implementing agencies and, through the \nprovincial departments of agriculture and rural development (DARDs), subprojects are selected, \nprepared, and implemented. Each DARD has established a provincial project management unit \n(PPMU) under its direct administration to carry out the works. \n \n8.  At the time of project appraisal in 2006, the Project comprised 89 subprojects (39 priority \nand 50 additional). Subsequently, with the delays in project start-up and given the urgency of \nsome, 16 subprojects were carried out using government funds. Thus, the total number of \nsubprojects was reduced to 73 and reprioritized into 47 priority and 26 additional subprojects. Of \nthe 47 priority subprojects, 35 have awarded all related contract packages and are in various \nstages of implementation. Of these, construction is expected to be completed for 6 subprojects \nwithin 2008. For the remaining 12 priority subprojects, bid evaluation and contracting of the \nrelated packages are at various stages, with one of these subprojects having to be redesigned \nand rebid, all contracting for which is expected to be completed before the end of 2008. Of the \n26 additional subprojects, all of which were identified and reviewed during appraisal of the initial \nloan, 16 have completed technical designs and are awaiting confirmation of available finance \nprior  to  commencing  the  bidding  process.  As  of  31  August  2008,  the  overall  project \nimplementation progress was estimated at 30% against the elapsed loan period of 57%. The \ncumulative contract awards were $21.2 million (equivalent to 39% of the net loan amount of \n$54.5  million)  and  disbursements  were  $13.7  million  (equivalent  to  25%  of  the  net  loan \namount).3 The list of priority and additional subprojects is in Appendix 2. \n \n9.  Project implementation progress was initially deficient but has improved markedly in \nrecent times, especially since the mobilization of project implementation consultants in June \n2008. There were delays in project and loan processing, and an extended period elapsed before \nthe Project was fully operational after loan effectiveness. The recruitment of the loan-financed \nproject implementation consultants was completed 14 months after initial loan effectiveness, \nwhich  limited  the  technical  oversight  to  DARD  and  CPMU  staff. 4  The  Government\u2019s \n                                                                                                                                                       \nindicators relating to the outputs, as well as the inputs and activities of the design and monitoring framework, \nchange with supplementary financing. \n3  Project implementation progress has picked up considerably since the project review conducted in March 2008 \nwhen it was only 17%. \n4  Although 14 months for the recruitment of consultants seems an excessive period of time, it is actually normal\u2014if \nnot relatively expedient\u2014given onerous government procedures that need to be followed. \n ", "3 \ndecentralized  implementation  arrangements  required  PPC  decisions  over  design  and \ncontracting  procedures  without  detailed  implementation  guidelines,  which  also  delayed \nconstruction.5 The capacity of PPMUs has been inadequate in some provinces and the CPMU \ntraining program was delivered late and had limited impact. ADB staff changes also contributed \nto the lack of continuity and delays. The delays created two unexpected impacts: (i) the 2006 \nand 2007 storm seasons extended damage at many subproject sites,6 and (ii) the Project was \nexposed to cost increases because of inflation.  \n \n10.  Work conducted on some subprojects displays a lack of quality arising from design \nprocesses,  contracting  arrangements,  contract  supervision,  and  government  procedures. \nDesign processes have not adopted least-cost alternative assessments; have been limited to \nreplacement or rehabilitation of specific sites without addressing either site or offsite risk and \nvulnerability; have been influenced by the PPCs\u2019 preference to address a wider scope at lower \nquality standards; and, most importantly, were driven by the estimated budget provided to the \nPPCs by CPMU, which results in lower quality design choices as opposed to the specific needs \nof  a  subproject.  Contracting  arrangements  have  been  used  to  increase  the  number  of \nprocurement packages, resulting in smaller contracts enabling the participation of small local \ncontractors that do not have the experience, equipment, or control systems to achieve the \nrequired standards for some subprojects. The lack or limited quality of contract supervision \ncaused by the existence of many small-sized contracts compounds the limited capacity of \ncontractors. However, project implementation consultants were mobilized in June 2008, which \nprovided momentum with achievement of significant project implementation progress. \n \n11.  Key  lessons  learned  and  to  be  applied  under  the  supplementary  financing  include \n(i) setting  deadlines  for  design  procedures  after  which  subprojects  will  not  be  eligible  for \nconsideration of financing under the loan; (ii) accelerating training, which will be provided in \neach project province, and improving effectiveness by including PPMUs, PPCs, DARDs, and \ncontractors; (iii) prior review and endorsement of subproject designs by CPMU with assistance \nfrom the project implementation consultants; (iv) assessment of a minimum of two alternatives \nfor  the  feasibility  studies  of  subprojects;  and  (v)  increased  mobilization  advances  for \nconstruction contractors to prepurchase materials.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Cost Overrun \n12.  The estimated total project cost overrun is $30 million, which is 51% more than the \noriginal project cost estimate of $59.9 million.7 The cost includes full financing (including price \nescalation) for 47 priority subprojects costing $13.3 million, as well as $6.5 million for enhancing \npriority subprojects to reduce risk and vulnerability and $8.3 million for completing additional \nsubprojects that were reviewed during appraisal of the initial loan.8 The balance of the project \n                                                \n5  Government Decree 131 outlining its policy for decentralization of responsibility for the implementation of externally \nfinanced projects was issued in November 2006. The guidelines to implement this policy followed 10 months later, \nin September 2007. \n6  In 2007, flooding from storms caused death for 462 people, 33 others went missing, and 856 were seriously \ninjured. The floods destroyed 718,000 homes and severely damaged transport and irrigation infrastructure in these \nareas. The estimated costs of damages were more than $700 million. \n7  The total cost increase is estimated at $34 million, of which $4.0 million is financed through the change in the \nSDR\u2013US dollar rate.  \n8  The original list was not fully financed because fewer loan savings were made available to fund the emergency \nassistance loan.  \n ", "4   \n \ncost overrun is for management costs of $1.5 million,9 and interest charges. The extension of \nthe Project will increase the interest payments during the period of construction by $0.5 million. \n \n13.  Within the list of 47 priority subprojects, CPMU has identified 13 subprojects requiring an \nadditional total investment of $6.5 million10 to ensure they achieve sustainable construction \nstandards that enhance their resistance to damage from future storms and typhoons. These \nadditional  costs  arise  from  shortfalls  in  technical  design,  especially  for  dikes  and  river \nembankments, and additional damages that occurred during the 2006 and 2007 storm seasons.  \n \n14.  The impact of input price escalation was assessed for four contracts\u2014one each for \nirrigation, roads, flood protection, and social infrastructure subprojects, which are representative \nof  the  four  sectors  supported  under  the  Project  (Appendix  4,  Table  A4.2  provides  the \ncomposition of contract price escalation for case study contracts). The overall contract price \nescalation  from  bid  preparation  to  contract  signing  increased  from  25%  to  28%,  with  the \nincreased prices of materials comprising about two-thirds to three-fourths of the total value of \ncontract price escalation for all sectors. For the road contract, price escalation on fuel costs had \na far greater impact (21%) than for the other sectors (less than 10%) reflecting the mechanical \nnature of road construction. For the flood protection contract, labor costs constituted 35%, \nreflecting the highly labor-intensive nature of works on dikes and river embankments, while for \nthe other sectors price escalation on labor costs constituted from 17% to 25%. \n \nB.  Impact on the Project \n15.  Unprecedented rates of price escalation threaten the successful completion of priority \nsubprojects\u2019 works that have commenced under the Project. Additional costs were incurred from \nfurther damages\u2014during the 2006 and 2007 flood seasons, and early 2008 floods\u2014that have \ndelayed project implementation, exposing the subprojects to additional price escalation. Revised \ncost estimates of priority subprojects equate to 114% of the original total project financing prior \nto any project management, interest, and additional subproject costs. The financing shortfall \ncreates a significant risk that some priority subprojects would remain incomplete, delayed, or \nconstructed to lower standards. CPMU and PPMUs have recognized the shortfall of funds and \nhave placed additional subprojects on hold until supplementary financing is confirmed. ADB \npolicy on supplementary financing gives priority to financing cost overruns on works to address \ndamage caused by natural disasters, including floods, as is the case with the Project.11 \n \n16.  The Government is trying to respond to the significantly higher costs of subprojects \nthrough a reduction in their number and by providing additional counterpart financing. However, \ngiven the size and significance of the price escalation, and the Government\u2019s inability to provide \nthe full amount of additional financing, a further reduction in the number of subprojects may \nreach an extent that threatens the Project\u2019s viability. Some PPMUs have sought cost savings by \nlowering  design  standards  and  reducing  the  scope  of  subprojects,  which  is  resulting  in \nincreased risk and vulnerability in a number of subprojects. These subprojects include a school \nat  risk  from  embankment  collapse,  several  river  embankments  that  have  inadequate  toe \nprotection resulting in toe erosion, and incomplete dike construction that leaves the structure \nsusceptible to further damage and potentially jeopardizes the livelihoods of local residents. \nThese enhancements would receive priority over additional subproject financing.  \n \n                                                \n9  Estimated to be 9% of capital works investment in enhancement works of priority subprojects and additional \nsubprojects \n10  Excluding expected project management costs of $0.6 million. \n11  ADB. 2005. Operations Manual. Section H5/BP: Supplementary Financing. Manila (5 December). \n ", "5 \n17.  Without  supplementary  financing,  the  expected  outcome  of  the  Project  will  not  be \nrealized  and  the  Project\u2019s  contribution\u2014albeit  small\u2014to  the  national  disaster  preparation, \nmitigation, and management goals will be significantly lessened. Much of the investment made \nto date would remain at risk\u2014partially completed structures could be lost or be unable to \nprovide their expected protective function, while awaiting finance for completion from other \nsources.  This  would  also  militate  against  sustaining  agricultural  productivity  in  the  project \nprovinces. The exact extent of these impacts is not possible to predict, as it is not known which \nsubprojects will be completed, nearly completed, or abandoned without the detail of the actual \ncosts from contract adjustment negotiations that have yet to be undertaken.  \n    \nC.  Rationale \n1.  Macroeconomic Context  \n18.  Viet Nam\u2019s economy has been one of the fastest growing in Asia for the last 2 decades. \nGrowth was particularly strong in the last several years, with real gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrowing by an average annual rate of 8.0% in 2003\u20132007. In 2007, real GDP grew by 8.5%, the \nhighest rate since 1996. GDP per capita at current prices increased from $441 in 2002 to $818 \nin 2007, while GDP per capita at purchasing power parity rose from $1,649 to $2,587. \n \n19.  In recent years, however, growth of aggregate demand outpaced growth of aggregate \nsupply. While expansionary monetary and fiscal policies and extensive borrowing and spending \nby state-owned enterprises (SOEs) fueled growth of aggregate demand, growth of aggregate \nsupply  was  constrained  by  infrastructure  bottlenecks,  relatively  low  efficiency  of  public \ninvestment, and increasingly acute shortages of skilled labor. As a result, both internal and \nexternal macroeconomic imbalances emerged.  \n \n20.  On the domestic side, average annual inflation jumped from 1.8% in 1999\u20132003 to 7.9% \nin 2004\u20132007. Inflation was quite high in late 2007 and the first half of 2008, with food prices \nrising particularly fast. In June 2008, the consumer price index (CPI) was 27.2% higher and the \nindex of food prices (which account for about 40% of the CPI) was 44.2% higher than in June \n2007. Such high inflation was caused not only by the excessively rapid growth of aggregate \ndemand in 2007, but also by the rise of world commodity prices (especially energy and food \nprices) in 2007 and the first half of 2008 and the supply-side shocks of late 2007 to early 2008 \n(including the outbreak of pig and poultry epidemics, an unusually harsh winter in northern \nprovinces, and floods in central provinces).  \n \n21.  In the external sector, the current account balance turned from a surplus in 1999\u20132001 \ninto a deficit in 2002\u20132007 and the first half of 2008. Moreover, the current account deficit \nwidened from 0.4% of GDP in 2006 to 9.6% of GDP in 2007 and an estimated 20% of GDP in \nJanuary\u2013June  2008.  Exports  grew  fast,  but  imports  grew  even  faster,  resulting  in  sharp \nincreases in the trade deficit. At the same time, inflows of foreign capital, especially foreign \ndirect investment (FDI), remained strong. Viet Nam\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization \nin early 2007 improved its attractiveness for foreign investors by making the policy framework \nmore predictable. Net FDI inflows, which ranged from $1.3 billion to $1.8 billion in 2003\u20132006, \nsurged to $6.6 billion in 2007 and an estimated $5.0 billion in the first 6 months of 2008. \nConsequently, the overall balance of payments recorded a large surplus in 2007 and a small \ndeficit  in  the  first  half  of  2008.  Gross  official  international  reserves  almost  doubled  from \n$11.5 billion at the end of 2006 to an estimated $21.0 billion at the end of 2007, before declining \nto slightly less than $20 billion at the end of June 2008. \n \n ", "6   \n \n2.  Government Responses  \n22.  In response to accelerating inflation and the ballooning current account deficit, in March \n2008 the Government essentially changed its top policy priority from maintaining high growth \nrates to curbing inflation and reducing the trade deficit (Appendix 3). In January\u2013June 2007, it \ntook a range of measures aimed at achieving these objectives. Among them were tightening of \nmonetary and fiscal policies. The minimum reserve requirements for banks and the policy \ninterest  rates  were  raised  considerably.  While  budgetary  expenditure  on  targeted  social \nassistance programs increased, administrative and capital expenditures were cut substantially. \nInvestments by SOEs (especially in noncore businesses) were curtailed.  \n \n23.  There are signs that these measures are restraining growth of aggregate demand and \nreducing the macroeconomic imbalances. Growth of money supply slowed down from 46.1% in \n2007 to an annualized rate of 15.7% in the first quarter of 2008. The balance of the consolidated \nbudget turned from a deficit of 5.5% of GDP in 2007 to a surplus of 0.4% of GDP in the first half \nof 2008. Year-on-year GDP growth moderated to 6.5% in January\u2013June 2008. Monthly inflation \ndecelerated from 3.9% in May 2008 to 2.1% in June 2008, with the rise of food prices slowing \ndown  from  4.6%  to  2.3%.  The  trade  deficit  narrowed  from  $3.4  billion  in  March  2008  to \n$0.8 billion in July 2008. In a sign that foreign investors remain optimistic about Viet Nam\u2019s \nmedium-term economic prospects, new FDI commitments soared to $31.6 billion in the first half \nof 2008 from $20.3 billion for the entire year of 2007. \n \n3.  Project Price Escalation  \n24.  The impact of inflation on project costs has been significant (Appendix 4). The impact \nwas compounded by the sector-like disbursement modality that applies no price contingency. \nPrice escalation for subprojects designed in July 2007 and constructed for completion in 2009 \nmay exceed 25%. Usually, the Government would be expected to apply available funds to the \nlist of subprojects, with any shortfall being managed through a reduction in scope. Following this \napproach for an emergency assistance loan, given the extreme impact of price escalation in \nViet Nam\u2019s economy, would seriously erode the project outcome.  \n \n25.  The timing of the preparation of bidding documentation has meant that many contracts \nwere  awarded  before  the  January  2008  announcement  of  wage  increases,  and  indicative \nbudgets  had  no  allowances for  price  increases  on  labor  costs, fuel costs,  or  construction \nmaterials. As such, these contract prices are now insufficient to complete the required works \nprogram.  \n \n26.  The estimation of price escalation can only be indicative as the actual cost will depend \non the  period  until  project  completion,  and further  delays  could  be  caused  by  weather  or \nseasonal constraints and procedural delays with the government process to adjust existing \ncontracts. \n \n4.  Existing Contract Adjustments  \n27.  As a matter of policy, ADB does not endorse changes in contract prices that are not \nalready permissible under the terms of the contract. However, for the reasons set out above, \nflexibility  has  been  allowed.12 Supplementary  financing  will  require  consideration  of  two \n                                                \n12  ADB Central Operations Services Office memo dated 26 August 2006 on Price Adjustments in ADB-Financed \nContracts Due to High Inflation. \n ", "7 \nimportant aspects. First, existing contracts will need to be adjusted for inflation in accordance \nwith government procedures (key steps in the adjustment process are in Appendix 4). Second, \nCPMU  needs  to  ensure  that  future  contracting  incorporates  forecast  price  increases  and \nprovides a budget ceiling that enables the contract to be completed.  \n \n28.  A number of constraints need to be considered in the Government\u2019s contract adjustment \nprocess.  Requirements  include  (i)  only  one  adjustment  is  allowed  per  contract,  (ii)  future \ninflation is limited to 10%, and (iii) the process relies on official unit prices which may vary from \nmarket prices. These factors require the timing of contract adjustments to be sufficiently late to \nenable as much actual information as possible to be included in the adjustment while not being \nso  late  that  a  contract  stops.  Ideally,  the  procedure  would  be  concluded  by  the  time \ndisbursements on the original contract reach 80%. \n \n29.  In addition to the price escalation adjustments needed on most contracts, the design of \nat least 13 identified subprojects also needs to be adjusted to ensure that these investments \nachieve an acceptable level of risk reduction from possible failures. River embankments and \nsea dikes for flood protection, in particular, have had significant weaknesses identified. These \nneed to be prioritized to ensure existing investments are not wasted, and to reduce the threat to \nlife and the structures themselves to an acceptable level. \n \n30.  CPMU, with the assistance of project implementation consultants, needs to review the \ntechnical specifications for all flood protection subprojects and ensure that they are corrected \nand improved as applicable in accordance with the recommendations of the reviews. Availability \nof supplementary financing is conditional on these steps being taken to reduce the risks for \nsubprojects  already  identified  as  defective,  and  introduces  covenants  into  the  initial  Loan \nAgreement by way of an amendment to ensure that no further disbursements are authorized for \nany flood protection subproject unless and until its design specifications have been verified and \nthe works corrected to the satisfaction of ADB. Where there have been prior disbursements and \nwhere the design specifications or works do not meet ADB standards, any loan proceeds \nalready disbursed in respect of such subprojects shall be refunded to ADB immediately and \nunconditionally. \n \n31.  With supplementary financing, the project implementation period will be extended by \n2 years. The extension is needed to complete construction of the priority subprojects, most of \nwhich will require contract adjustments caused by high price escalation in Viet Nam that was not \nreasonably predictable during early stages of project implementation. Furthermore, at least \n13 of the 47 priority subprojects will also require contract adjustments to accommodate needed \ndesign  enhancements,  which  did  not  become  apparent  until  post-reviews  by  the  project \nimplementation consultants revealed design faults, especially with flood protection subprojects. \nFinally, the 2-year extension is needed to complete construction of additional subprojects that \nwill be assessed and deemed eligible for financing after the priorities mentioned above have \nbeen addressed and adequate financing determined to be available. Technical designs have \nbeen completed for 16 of these additional subprojects, which are awaiting confirmation of \nfinancing before proceeding to the bid processing stage. \n \nD.  Revised Cost Estimates \n32.  The estimated cost of supplementary financing is $30.0 million, including taxes and \nduties of $3.3 million (Table 1).

Revised Financing Plan \n33.  The  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $25.5  million  (SDR17.085  million13to \nsupplement  the  $50.97  million14 equivalent  agreed  in  2006)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources to provide supplementary financing to the Project. The SDR value of the initial loan as \nat 30 August 2008 is $54.5 million equivalent. The supplementary financing will be subject to the \nsame terms and conditions as the initial loan, and the repayment schedule of the supplementary \nfinancing will be synchronized  with that of the initial loan, which has a term of 40 years, \nincluding a grace period of 10 years, an interest rate of 1% per year, and repayment of principal \nat 2% a year for the first 10 years after the grace period and 4% a year thereafter, and such \nother terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the initial \nLoan Agreement, as amended for purposes of the supplementary financing. The initial loan was \napproved on 21 November 2006. The Government\u2019s contribution towards the supplementary \nloan amounts to $4.5 million, including all local taxes and duties. The Borrower will be the \nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam. Detailed cost estimates by financier are in Appendix 5. \n \n34.  The supplementary financing will be provided under an amendment to the initial Loan \nAgreement (the Amendment Agreement), providing for (i) an aggregate SDR loan amount \n(being the SDR amount under the initial loan increased by the supplementary financing); (ii) a \nconsolidated repayment schedule for the initial loan and the supplementary financing; and \n(iii) certain clarifications and amendments to the implementation arrangements, as detailed in \nthis report and recommendation of the President (RRP). \n \n                                                \n13 Based on the 28 October 2008 SDR\u2013US dollar conversion of 0.67. \n14 Based on the SDR\u2013US dollar conversion rate at the time of loan negotiations. \n ", "9 \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan for Supplementary Loan \n($ million) \nSource  Total    % \nAsian Development Bank  25.5    85.0 \nGovernment  4.5    15.0 \n  Total    30.0    100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.  Remedial Steps \n35.  The major threat and risk to continuation of the Project is the prospect of prolonged \nperiods for designing and implementing subprojects. A number of remedial steps have been \nidentified  and  agreed  with  MARD  and  CPMU.  These  include  (i)  fast-tracking  contracting, \n(ii) maximizing  mobilization  payments  for  purchase  of  materials,  (iii)  reduced  construction \nwindows,  (iv)  timely  adjustment  of  existing  contracts,  and  (v)  reprioritization  of  additional \nsubprojects  based  on  the  performance  of  each  PPMU  to  design  and  implement  priority \nsubprojects. There  are also  recent  initiatives  to  align  ADB\u2019s  procedures  with  those  of  the \nGovernment to improve project performance in general.15 \n \n36.  Review missions will ensure that implementation plans are being achieved, and where \ndelays are being incurred in a particular subproject, options (including the cancellation of the \nsubproject) will be reviewed and applied.16 Full project reviews will be conducted by specialized \nstaff of the Viet Nam Resident Mission twice a year for the duration of the implementation \nperiod. \n   \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n37.  The  implementation  arrangements  of  the  initial  loan  will  be  maintained  and \nstrengthened. Improvements will be introduced both in the Amendment Agreement and in the \nproject administration memorandum to ensure that (i) CPMU and DARD work closely to monitor \nthe level of price adjustments on existing contracts to ensure that overall project financing is \navailable before commitments are made to additional subprojects, (ii) design specifications and \nconstruction  are  maintained  or  improved  (iii)  contract  pricing  is  adjusted  to  accommodate \ninflation, and (iv) procedures for use of funds are reprioritized.     \n \n38.  The  RRP  for  the  initial  loan  of  the  Project  provides  indicative  costs  for  additional \nsubprojects.  This  RRP  does  not  provide  these  estimates  so  they  cannot  be  used  as  a \ndeterminant of subproject design, acting as a constraint irrespective of site or technical needs. \nUnder  previous  arrangements,  major  works  were  being  simplified  and/or  had  their  scope \nreduced to fit the indicative budget. CPMU needs to ensure that design processes move into a \nfar more sustainable form of subproject design based on site investigations and a design that \n                                                \n15 The Viet Nam Country Portfolio Review Mission in September\u2013October 2008 proposed a number of advance and \npreparatory actions to improve project performance. \n16 The  Project  Review  Mission  conducted  simultaneously  with  the  Supplementary  Loan  Fact-Finding  Mission \n(24 July\u201312  August  2008)  recommended  12  measures  for  CPMU\u2019s  and  PPMUs\u2019  improvement  of  project \nperformance and implementation. These were subsequently agreed when the aide memoire of the Project Review \nMission was signed by the director, CPMU on 17 September 2008.  \n ", "10   \n \nresponds to site and technical needs, and not simply a design for spending the budget. As such, \nall designs for additional subprojects will need to be reviewed by CPMU, with the assistance of \nthe project implementation consultants, to ensure that all findings are incorporated into the \ncontract documentation. ADB will endorse the bidding and contract documentation once it is \nassured all findings are incorporated.  \n \n39.  The scope of the design inputs also needs to be reconsidered. The current approach of \nfocusing on a site-based response to damages will be expanded to a system-wide approach \nwithin which a site is located. For example, the current approach of building a river embankment \nto protect land on one side of a river often results in damages downstream on the opposite \nbank.  A  proper  assessment  would factor these  impacts  into the  design  process, thus the \nrequirement for prior approval of designs for additional subprojects is critical to ensure that such \nconsiderations are fully addressed. \n \n40.  To manage the supplementary financing, CPMU will create a database of all subproject \ncontracts, including the contract adjustments, that can be included in project reports to ensure \nthat an up-to-date reconciliation of \u201cavailable funds\u201d is maintained. The database will be used as \nthe basis for deciding on the use of unutilized funds according to the following priorities: (i) given \nhigh price escalation, completion or upgrading of priority subprojects to a sustainable standard; \n(ii)  completion  of  priority  subprojects  through  enhanced  technical  design  to  ensure  safety \nconditions of structures, protection of human life, and protection of essential infrastructure; and \n(iii)  additional  subprojects  that  meet  the  required  selection  criteria,  including  demonstrated \ncapacity of relevant PPMUs. CPMU will be supported in these assessments by the project \nimplementation  consultants  whose  focus  will  move  to  (i)  capacity  building  of  PPMUs, \n(ii) technical support for CPMU, and (iii) technical assessment of both enhanced and additional \nsubprojects. CPMU\u2019s primary role of monitoring and evaluation will be strengthened through the \ndevelopment of a structured training needs assessment and plan. The training program will be \nimplemented  and  the  evaluation  workshops  completed  prior  to  effectiveness  of  the \nsupplementary financing. \n \n41.  The procedure for additional subprojects will involve the following: (i) PPMU requesting \nCPMU support for an original budget allocation; (ii) a site investigation is conducted and design \noptions  (minimum  of  two)  are  reviewed  by  the  project  implementation  consultants;  (iii)  if \nendorsed, the PPC provides approval for feasibility study and detailed costing; (iv) the feasibility \nstudy would then be reviewed by the consultant\u2019s safeguard specialists; and (v) if endorsed, \nCPMU  would  then  seek  ADB\u2019s  endorsement,  which  would  trigger  allocation  of  budget  for \nimplementation.  \n \n42.  The process for additional subprojects is not to be a provincial allocation model but a \ncompetitive application process, with the first to apply being first to access available funds. This \nwill be partly self-determined, based on demonstrated capacity of relevant PPMUs. A final cutoff \ndate for approval of additional subprojects is 30 June 2009. \n  \n43.  Selection Criteria and Approval for All Subprojects. All subprojects are required to \nmeet the same criteria as applicable under the initial Loan Agreement (paragraph 5 of Schedule \n5 to the initial Loan Agreement): \n  \n(i)  Only subprojects damaged by the 2005 series of typhoons and tropical storms \nwill be considered for inclusion in the Project.  \n(ii)  Subprojects  with  unacceptable  environmental  or  social  impacts  or  significant \nresettlement may not be included. \n ", "11 \n(iii)  No subprojects will be located within or adjacent to designated protected or \nconservation areas and their buffer zones, nor will any subproject change the \ncourse of a river or alter river characteristics in a significant way, or have the \npotential to make significant changes in the surrounding environment. \n(iv)  In the case of a flood protection subproject,17 the design specification for such \nsubproject shall be approved by ADB.  \n(v)  Rehabilitation  is  technically  feasible,  cost-effective,  financially  viable,  and \nsustainable, and represents a least-cost alternative, while incorporating natural \ndisaster risk reduction measures where necessary and feasible.18 \n(vi)  A  subproject  may  only  be  considered  if  the  PPC  has  an  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  plan  for  the  subproject,  and  provides  an  assurance  of \nannual  O&M  budget  (exclusive  of  any  beneficiary  contribution  that  may  be \nnegotiated during subproject selection and preparation).  \n(vii)  Only subprojects for which the contracted works can be completed during project \nimplementation may be considered, with final approvals in place before 30 June \n2009. \n(viii)  Partial financing of a subproject from sources other than the loan and related \ngovernment  counterpart  funding  is  permissible  provided  the  amounts  and \nsources of all such external funding are clearly and transparently presented as \npart of the financing plan and submitted to ADB for approval. \n(ix)  No subproject costing less than $300,000 equivalent will be eligible for financing \nunder  the  Project  unless  otherwise  agreed  by  ADB,  and  there  shall  be  no \ngrouping of smaller works program to attain this cost requirement.19 \n \n2.  Implementation Period  \n44.   The  project  implementation  period  is  for  over  48  months  from  the  date  of  loan \neffectiveness of the initial loan, with project completion expected to occur by 30 June 2011 and \nloan closing date on 31 December 2011, against a project completion date of 30 June 2009 and \nloan  closing  date  of  31  December  2009  under  the  initial  loan.  The  indicative  project \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 6. \n \n3.   Procurement \n45.  Civil works and related services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). SOEs will be eligible to bid for contracts if \nthey are legally and financially autonomous, independent from MARD and the DARDs, and \noperate on the basis of commercial law and practice. Civil works contracts estimated to cost \nmore than $2 million equivalent will be procured through international competitive bidding (ICB). \nADB\u2019s standard bidding documents for the procurement of works (large contracts) will be used. \nPrequalification will only be required for large or complex subprojects as determined by ADB at \nthe feasibility study phase. Procurement using ICB procedures requires prior ADB review of \ninvitations to bid, bidding documents, and bid evaluation reports. The bidding period will be \n42 days for ICB contracts.  \n                                                \n17 A subproject indicated as a flood protection subproject in Appendix 2 of this RRP.  \n18 Distributional analyses will be made to determine the nature and impact of all positive and negative impacts, and \nthe results will be used to improve subproject prioritization and thereby increase project benefits for the poor. \n19 The threshold amount is raised from $200,000 (under the initial loan) to $300,000 as a result of inflation. For the \nsame reason, selection criterion (vii) paragraph 5 of Schedule 5 of the initial Loan Agreement (\u201cthe estimated \nconstruction cost shall not exceed the original estimate by the Borrower by more than 15%\u201d) is not included as a \nselection and approval criteria with supplementary financing. \n ", "12   \n \n46.  Civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  $2  million  or  less  will  be  procured  through \nnational competitive bidding (NCB) procedures. The Government\u2019s standard bidding documents \nand  procedures  will  be  used  if  these  comply  closely  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines. \nPostqualification or the national contractor\u2019s registration and/or classification system will be \nused for NCB contracts. The bidding period will be 21 days. Prior review by ADB of invitations to \nbid, bidding documents, and bid evaluation reports was required for the first NCB contract in \neach province. Subsequently, retroactive approval procedures were followed. If for any reason \nADB does not approve the award or terms of contract, the Government will use its own funds to \nfinance the contract or to refund to ADB any payments already made from loan funds for that \ncontract. The updated procurement plan is in Appendix 7. \n \n47.  A team of international and national consultants, with expertise in natural disaster risk \nassessment, engineering investigations and design, geotechnical engineering, economic and \nfinancial analyses, and social and environmental aspects was recruited under ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) to assist with implementation \nof the Project, and will be maintained for its extended duration. \n \n4.  Anticorruption Policy  \n48.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  Executing  Agency.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin the loan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of \nADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n49.  A  TA  grant  will  be  provided  for  advisory  assistance  to  the  Government  in  Geo-\nInformation Technology for Hazard Risk Assessment. The total cost of the TA is $625,000, out \nof which $500,000 equivalent will be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia \nand Knowledge Partnership Fund and administered by ADB, while the Government will provide \nthe balance of $125,000 in kind. \n \n50.  The TA will support increased disaster preparedness to mitigate the worst impacts of \nclimate change through the provision of training to staff of MARD\u2019s  Disaster Management \nCenter and of the Water Resources University (WRU) on the use of advanced technology such \nas geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing. Further details of the TA are in \nAppendix 8. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts  \n51.  The nature of the Project makes detailed determination of the economic and financial \nfeasibility difficult. Under the disaster and emergency assistance guidelines, there is no explicit \nrequirement  for  economic  analysis;  rather,  the  economic  assessment  is  included  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s feasibility study guidelines. The review of economic assessments highlights these \n ", "13 \ndifficulties  and  major  shortfalls  for  the  feasibility  study  guidelines.  Details  of  the  updated \neconomic analysis of selected subprojects are in Appendix 9. \n \n52.  There are four types of subprojects: (i) irrigation, (ii) roads, (iii) flood protection, and \n(iv) social infrastructure subprojects. Each type of subproject has a unique set of economic \nbenefits, which requires a different methodology for quantifying and estimating. The economic \nbenefits that can be attributed to the subprojects are discussed below.  \n \n53.  For irrigation subprojects, the primary benefit is increased agricultural production, which \nis measured as the incremental increase in net farm income for the project area. Secondary \nbenefits of irrigation subprojects can include improved drainage function (reduced or avoided \nflood damage) and multiple use benefits, such as water for cleaning and drinking. Quantifying \nsecondary benefits is difficult and not normally done. Another important potential benefit can be \nimproved flood protection from a reservoir used for irrigation purposes.  \n \n54.  For road subprojects, the primary economic benefit is reduced travel costs, normally \nfound through reduced fuel consumption and travel time. The estimated difference in the value \nof travel costs \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\" the Project provides the subproject benefits. The subproject \nfeasibility  studies  calculate  economic  benefits  based  on  projected  cost  reductions  from \nimproved road quality, increase in traffic volume, and changes in transportation mode. \n \n55.  The primary economic benefit of flood protection subprojects (i.e., sea dikes and river \nembankments) is the value of expected damage avoided. Typically, there are three necessary \ncomponents to making this calculation: (i) probability of flood event occurring, (ii) probability of \ndike failure, and (iii) a damage function based on the magnitude of the flood event. When \nestimating benefits of flood protection subprojects, it is critical that negative impacts arising from \nthe altered hydrologic processes are included as a negative benefit. The data requirements for \nsuch estimates are quite intensive and include a non-negligible amount of uncertainty. In the \nexamined subproject feasibility studies, either no attempt is made to estimate economic benefits \nor  benefits  are  estimated  as  changes  in  production  values  as  projected  by  the  local \nsocioeconomic development plan\u2014the assumption being that protection from flood damage will \nallow the area to pursue economic development strategies successfully. This approach, while \nhaving some legitimacy, does not accurately assess the reduction in vulnerability, which is the \nmain objective of a flood protection subproject. \n \n56.  The primary economic benefit of social infrastructure subprojects is less direct, but can \ninclude the value from achieving a higher education level, improved health care, and more \nactive markets. While it is possible to quantify these benefits, given the focus on social benefits \nand the emergency nature of the subprojects, it is not worthwhile to pursue an attempt to \nquantify these benefits for economic analysis.  \n \n57.  The  impact  of  capital  cost  escalation  on  subproject  viability  is  variable,  with  some \nsubprojects still being feasible based on the economic analysis from the feasibility studies. \nWhile investment costs increase, many of the benefit streams described above also increase. \nHigher transport costs also increase the benefits of saved travel time, and higher rice prices \nincrease the value of agricultural production, especially rice.  \n \n58.  Without  supplementary  financing,  the  47  priority  subprojects  face  a  14%  financing \nshortfall as their capital costs are now estimated at 114% of the original total project cost. The \nresult is that some of these priority subprojects would not be completed and no additional \nsubprojects would be undertaken. An economic assessment of supplementary financing only \n ", "14   \n \nincludes the investment costs excluding the sunk costs, which are assessed against the benefits \ngenerated by the subproject less any benefits captured by the incomplete subproject. Where a \nsubproject is incomplete, most risk reduction benefits will not be generated; while for some \nsubprojects, the uncompleted structure will create substantial additional opportunity costs from \ndamages  to  adjacent  areas.20 The  adoption  of  a  sunk  cost  approach  would  present  the \nexpected  benefits  from  the  original  project  financing  being  assessed  against  the  reduced \ninvestment cost of $30 million. The resultant economic feasibility of the supplementary financing \nwould then be significantly higher than the original estimates for those subprojects completed. \n \n59.  For financial analysis, no subproject generates a direct revenue stream, so no financial \ninternal rates of return are calculated. The financial sustainability is addressed as a condition for \nsubproject  approval  linked  to  the  PPC\u2019s  financial  capacity  to  maintain  the  structures  after \ncompletion of the Project. All subproject feasibility studies include commitments to meet the \nO&M costs as specified under government guidelines. As the investment costs and scope of \neach subproject are very small relative to the PPC O&M budgets, CPMU concludes that each is \nfinancially sustainable.  \n \n60.  A key issue is the extent to which the government guidelines are appropriate, in terms of \nthe amount required for effective maintenance of civil works integrity through time. Experience \nand field observations indicate that there is a significant gap between needs and stated official \nrequirements. The issue is recognized by MARD, and an ADB-financed TA21 will address the \nGovernment\u2019s approach and inputs for O&M of publicly financed infrastructure. There may be \nfurther opportunities for synergies with related activities by facilitating experience sharing with \nother ADB-assisted investments in the sector. \n \n61.  The  major  beneficiaries  identified  in  the  RRP  for  the  initial  loan  were  about \n450,000 residents  of  remote  areas  of  the  project  provinces  that  will  benefit  directly  from \nimproved access to markets, schools, and other services; rapid resumption of income-earning \nactivities; and greater security from natural disasters.22 The Project will reinstate (i) protection \nand irrigation infrastructure serving about 18,300 hectares (ha) of land; (ii) 211 kilometers (km) \nof rural roads (including 67 culverts and 5 bridges); (iii) about 98 km of sea dikes and flood \nprotection embankments; and (iv) construction of 1,820 square meters (m2) for schools and \nmarkets. Rehabilitated structures will have higher resistance to floods, storm surge, waves, and \nother typhoon-related impacts (including larger conveyance capacity for bridges and better \nslope  protection  on  sea  dikes  and  flood  protection  embankments),  based  on  risk  and \nvulnerability assessments. The causes of failure will be examined to ensure better design \nstandards where necessary, and the completed works will be integrated into a database linked \nto provincial disaster preparedness plans.  \n \nB.  Social Aspects  \n62.  Significant resettlement impacts are not expected because most of the rehabilitation \nwork is being done within the existing right-of-way of the damaged infrastructure. Acquisition of \n                                                \n20 The assignment of costs and benefits by each subproject within a \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d supplementary financing \nscenario was not completed because of the uncertainty over which subprojects will be completed and the limited \ntime for preparation of supplementary financing. \n21 ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Infrastructure Policy Reform Support. \nManila (TA 4981-VIE, $1 million, approved 15 October 2007). \n22 With the Government wholly financing some of the top-priority subprojects before effectiveness of the initial loan \n(paragraph 8), the number of beneficiaries may have changed prior to implementation of the Project, although this \nis not considered to have been significant.  \n ", "15 \nsome small areas of land may be needed where infrastructure cannot be reinstated within the \noriginal site. This may occur if the site has been eroded or otherwise rendered unsuitable, an \nalternative nearby site offers greater security in terms of future flood events, or sound technical \nand financial reasons are given for selecting another site. The Government and ADB have \nagreed on a resettlement framework that sets out the compensation and other entitlements for \nany unanticipated land acquisition and/or resettlement impacts in accordance the Government\u2019s \napplicable laws and regulations, and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). This same \nresettlement framework will be applied for the Project with supplementary financing. The Project \nremains category B. Short resettlement plans will be prepared for any subproject found to have \nresettlement impacts up to the limits of category B.  \n \n63.  A high proportion of the ethnic minority groups will be affected in the subproject areas in \nHa  Giang,  Yen  Bai,  and  Phu  Tho  provinces.  The  Project  is  designed  to  ensure  that  all \ncommunities will benefit from the Project on an equitable basis. The Government and ADB have \nagreed to an indigenous peoples development framework (IPDF) prepared in accordance with \nthe applicable government laws and regulations, and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples \n(1998).  The  IPDF  provides  a  policy  framework  to  screen  impacts  of  the  subprojects,  and \naccordingly, to prepare an appropriate indigenous peoples development plan or specific actions \nfor the subprojects affecting ethnic minority groups. This same IPDF will be applied for the \nProject  with  supplementary  financing.  The  Project  is  classified  category  B  for  indigenous \npeoples.  \n \nC.  Environmental Impacts  \n64.  While the Project may lead to temporary and reversible localized negative impacts, no \nsignificant  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  foreseen,  and  the  Project  is  classified  as \nenvironmental category B. A generic initial environmental examination (IEE) was prepared for \nthe original project to identify potential impacts, appropriate mitigation measures, and suitable \nmonitoring  mechanisms.  Subprojects  will  follow  environmental  assessment  procedures \nstipulated  in  an  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  developed  to  ensure \ncompliance with the Government\u2019s environmental regulations and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy \n(2002). IEEs will be prepared for all category B subprojects. Although no environmental impact \nassessment is currently required, this will be reexamined during detailed design of additional \nsubprojects.  \n \nD.  Risk and Assumptions  \n65.  The risks and assumptions relating to supplementary financing are (i) continued delays \nto implementation leading to cost overruns, (ii) an attempt to complete too many subprojects by \nreducing the scale or technical design standards, and (iii) further damages as a result of further \nnatural disasters during the implementation period. \n \n66.  Delayed implementation could arise from the amount of time required to complete the \nadjustment to each priority subproject contract to take into account inflation and any required \nimprovement to the existing design specifications. As the adjustment process has not been \npreviously applied and approvals do not follow established procedures, it is expected that some \ndelays will result. The impact of this risk is that CPMU will not have a clear understanding of the \nproject financial commitments and the delays will limit the number of additional subprojects. \nRisk mitigation will be through CPMU expediting the processing of initial contract adjustments \n ", "16   \n \nas soon as possible to develop guidelines and procedures, and also to establish the precedence \nfor the overall process.23 \n \n67.  The reduced scope of dikes and embankments severely reduces their effectiveness and \noften  creates  significant  risk  of  damage  to  the  partially  completed  structures,  which  the \nGovernment  and  ADB  cannot  accept.  Under  the  Amendment  Agreement,  ADB  and  the \nGovernment will put in place procedures to ensure that this practice is identified and managed \nand that the supplementary financing does not fund flood protection subprojects for which the \ndesign specifications have not been independently confirmed to be satisfactory and the works \ncompleted according to such specifications. Lowered or inappropriate technical standards to \nreduce costs also create risks. To date, some subprojects have not had sufficient technical \ndesign input or the design is redundant because of changing site conditions. In part, this risk \narose  from  the  delayed  mobilization  of  technical  design  specialists  with  the  project \nimplementation consultants until after designs are completed. These project implementation \nconsultants have now been mobilized, and extension of their contract for the extended duration \nof the Project will be one of the conditions for effectiveness and availability of the supplementary \nfinancing.  \n \n68.  Prolonged  design  periods  have  resulted  in  additional  damages  to  sites.  For \nembankments where there is river action every flood season, this results in significant site \nchanges that require additional design and technical inputs. Prior to final approvals, each PPMU \nwill complete a site investigation visit and confirm the validity of the design to the CPMU.  \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n69.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and MARD have given the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated into the Loan Agreement, as amended under the \nAmendment Agreement: \n \n(i)  Provincial project management units. MARD will continue to ensure that the \nparticipating DARDs provide in each PPMU, for the duration of the Project, a \nproject  manager,  social  and  environment  sectors  coordinator,  economist, \naccounting and financial management staff, and engineering and technical staff \nconsistent with the number and complexity of subprojects to be managed, to the \nsatisfaction  of  ADB.  MARD  will  ensure  that  the  project  implementation \nconsultants recruited for the Project (or any other team of consultants recruited \nwith the approval of ADB) are assigned to (i) assist the CPMU to review the \nfeasibility study and design specifications prepared for each subproject by the \nPPMU  in  each  project  province,  including  any  variation  to  such  design \nspecifications; (ii) provide recommendations to the PPMU and CPMU to enhance \nthe design specifications for each flood protection subproject in order to ensure \nthat adequate safety standards are met; and (iii) assist ADB, when requested, in \nassessing the final design specifications for a flood protection subproject. \n \n                                                \n23  Delays in the contract adjustment process could also result if inadequate ADB resources are applied for the review \nand approval of the large number of contract adjustments required. The risk will be mitigated with the assignment \nof an international Central Operations Services Office procurement specialist and the recruitment of a national \nprocurement specialist to the Viet Nam Resident Mission to assist with this process. \n ", "17 \n(ii)  Selection of Subprojects. MARD will continue to ensure that all subprojects \nmeet,  to  the  satisfaction  of  ADB,  the  agreed  selection  criteria  set  out  in \nparagraph 5 of Schedule 5 to the initial Loan Agreement (with the exception of \nitem (vii), which shall be deleted and item (ix) for which the threshold amount \nshall be increased to $300,000), and implementation arrangements, and that all \nsubprojects  incorporate  measures  to  enhance  their  resistance  to  typhoon \ndamage  based  on  risk  and  vulnerability  analyses.  Without  prejudice  to  the \npreceding sentence, MARD will also ensure that approval by ADB of the design \nspecifications is required before any flood protection subproject may be selected. \n \n(iii)  Design Specifications. MARD will ensure that the design specifications and the \ncivil works for all subprojects give due consideration to the recommendations of \nthe  project  implementation  consultants.  Disbursements  in  respect  of  a  flood \nprotection subproject will be subject to works being completed in accordance to \ndesign specifications reviewed and approved by ADB. In the event where loan \nproceeds for a flood protection subproject have already been disbursed and the \ncompleted civil works are deemed by ADB to be insufficient or not in compliance \nwith  the  approved  design  specifications  and  are  not  corrected  to  ADB\u2019s \nsatisfaction within a reasonable period of time, ADB will have the option to ask \nfrom  the  Government  that  such  loan  proceeds  (or  any  portion  thereof)  be \nrefunded immediately and unconditionally. \n \n(iv)  Resettlement.  MARD  will  continue  to  ensure  that  only  subprojects  whose \nresettlement impacts remain within the limits of a category B subproject will be \nfinanced by the Project. MARD will continue to ensure that land acquisition and \nresettlement activities are implemented in accordance with the applicable laws \nand  regulations  of  Viet  Nam  and  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy, as reflected in the project resettlement framework dated \nSeptember 2006. MARD will continue to ensure that subproject resettlement \nplans, prepared in accordance with the procedures given in Appendix 5 to the \nRRP for the initial Loan Agreement, will be disclosed to people affected prior to \nsubmitting to ADB for review. Approval of the subproject resettlement plan by \nADB will be a precondition to award of contracts for civil works in such cases. \nMARD  will  continue  to  ensure  that  independent  external  monitoring  and \nevaluation of the resettlement process and impacts are conducted by a qualified \nsocial science or other suitably qualified institution acceptable to ADB. \n \n(v)  Community  participation.  MARD  will  continue  to  ensure  that  the  DARDs \nactively  promote  community  participation  in  selection,  preparation, \nimplementation, and performance monitoring of subprojects. Tender documents \nwill continue to include provisions to ensure contractors' preferential hiring of \nlocal labor, to guarantee equal opportunities for female workers with the principle \nof equal pay for work of equal value, and to prevent employment of child labor. \n \n(vi)  Indigenous  people.  MARD  will  continue  to  ensure  that  subprojects  will  not \nadversely affect indigenous peoples, households headed by women, disabled, \nelderly, or other similarly vulnerable groups. In the event that indigenous people \nare affected by or are beneficiaries of any subproject, MARD will continue to \nensure that their rights and needs are fully respected in compliance with ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) and in accordance with the IPDF dated \nSeptember 2006. \n ", "18   \n \n(vii)  Environment.  MARD  will  ensure  that  each  subproject follows  environmental \nassessment procedures stipulated in the environmental assessment and review \nframework  developed  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  Government\u2019s \nenvironmental regulations and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy and dated September \n2006.  MARD  will  further  ensure  that  IEEs  and,  as  may  be  required  during \ndetailed  design,  an  environmental  impact  assessment,  are  prepared  for  all \ncategory B subprojects. \n \n(viii)  Award of civil works. The Government will not award any civil works contracts \nfinanced under the supplementary financing until (i) the resettlement plan for the \nrelevant subproject has been approved by ADB; and (ii) all resettlement activities \nhave  been  completed  and  related  compensation  payments,  replacement  of \nassets or other assistance for the affected people are delivered prior to the \ndispossession or displacement of the affected people in accordance with the \nresettlement plan or other requirements relating to resettlement and vulnerable \ngroups, as applicable. \n   \nB.  Conditions to Effectiveness of the Amendment \n \n70.  Prior to effectiveness of the amendment ADB will have received confirmation from the \nGovernment satisfactory to ADB that (i) the design specifications (or the procurement contract, \nwhere  the  design  specifications  are  included  in  the  procurement  contract)  for  subprojects \nnumbered 19, 20, 21, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 40, 41, 42, 43 and 44 in Appendix 2 to this RRP have \nbeen revised; (ii) the IEE for each of the subprojects referred to in (i) above have been revised \nto reflect the changes in design specifications; and (iii) the services contracts of the international \nconsultants have been amended to ensure that their scope of services reflects paragraph 69(i) \nhere above and extended until the revised project completion date, being 30 June 2011. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n71.

Economic Performance \n1.  Viet Nam\u2019s economy has been one of the fastest growing in Asia for the last 2 decades. \nGrowth was particularly strong in the last several years, with real gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrowing by an average annual rate of 8.0% in 2003\u20132007. In 2007, real GDP grew by 8.5%, the \nhighest rate since 1996. GDP per capita at current prices increased from $441 in 2002 to $818 \nin 2007, while GDP per capita at purchasing power parity rose from $1,649 to $2,587. \n2.  In recent years, however, growth of aggregate demand outpaced growth of aggregate \nsupply. While expansionary monetary and fiscal policies and extensive borrowing and spending \nby state-owned enterprises (SOEs) fueled growth of aggregate demand, growth of aggregate \nsupply  was  constrained  by  infrastructure  bottlenecks,  relatively  low  efficiency  of  public \ninvestment, and increasingly acute shortages of skilled labor. As a result, both internal and \nexternal macroeconomic imbalances emerged.  \n3.  On the domestic side, average annual inflation jumped from 1.8% in 1999\u20132003 to 7.9% \nin 2004\u20132007. Inflation was quite high in late 2007 and the first half of 2008, with food prices \nrising particularly fast. In June 2008, the consumer price index (CPI) was 27.2% higher and the \nindex of food prices (which account for about 40% of the CPI) was 44.2% higher than in June \n2007. Such high inflation was caused not only by the excessively rapid growth of aggregate \ndemand in 2007, but also by the rise of world commodity prices (especially energy and food \nprices) in 2007 and the first half of 2008 and the supply-side shocks of late 2007 to early 2008.  \n4.  In the external sector, the current account balance turned from a surplus in 1999\u20132001 \ninto a deficit in 2002\u20132007 and the first half of 2008. Moreover, the current account deficit \nwidened from 0.4% of GDP in 2006 to 9.6% of GDP in 2007 and an estimated 20% of GDP in \nJanuary\u2013June  2008.  Exports  grew  fast,  but  imports  grew  even  faster,  resulting  in  sharp \nincreases in the trade deficit. At the same time, inflows of foreign capital, especially foreign \ndirect investment (FDI), remained strong. Viet Nam\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization \nin early 2007 improved its attractiveness for foreign investors by making the policy framework \nmore predictable. Net FDI inflows, which ranged from $1.3 billion to $1.8 billion in 2003\u20132006, \nsurged to $6.6 billion in 2007 and an estimated $5.0 billion in the first 6 months of 2008. \nConsequently, the overall balance of payments recorded a large surplus in 2007 and a small \ndeficit  in  the  first  half  of  2008.  Gross  official  international  reserves  almost  doubled  from \n$11.5 billion at the end of 2006 to an estimated $21.0 billion at the end of 2007, before declining \nto slightly less than $20 billion at the end of June 2008. FDI committed to 1,500 new projects \nwith the majority of these in the industrial sectors. \n5.  The high growth rate and policy achievements are built on stability and an expansionist \neconomic  policy,  resulting  in  increasing  domestic  demand  along  with  strong  export \nperformance. Consumption growth is strong across all sectors, indicating a strong domestic \neconomy where private consumption amounts to 63% of GDP compared to 6% of GDP for the \npublic sector.  \n6.  The structure of the economy continues to change, with industrial production growing at \nmore than 10% per annum compared to services (8%) and agriculture (3%). Investment (FDI \nand domestic) has flowed to the industrial sectors, which have grown from 36% of GDP in 2000 \nto over 42% in 2007. \n ", "Appendix 3             29 \n7.  In summary, the period following the Asian financial crisis was one of consolidation, \nstability, and massive investment in the economy\u2014driving growth to new highs and achieving \nthe Government\u2019s economic and social goals, often well ahead of schedule. At the same time, \nthese  pressures  have  led  to  macroeconomic  imbalances  between  aggregate  demand  and \nsupply. This has resulted in escalating inflation which, when combined with external commodity \nprice increases in food and fuel, has seen inflation exceed 26% in mid-2008.  \nB.  Economic Shocks and Challenges \n8.  Viet Nam\u2019s economy was indicating that it was overheating in 2005\u20132007, with excess \ndemand creating price pressures, a growing money supply, increased FDI, increased credit \navailability, and continued export growth providing liquidity. During the latter half of 2007 and \nearly 2008, the economy faced new challenges, including (i) rapidly increasing world oil prices, \n(ii)  increased  concerns  regarding  the  world  economy  and  the  fallout  of  global  financial \ninstitutions, and (iii) commodity price increases. These external shocks were accompanied by a \nrange of domestic pressures, including (i) inflation; (ii) increased consumption supported by \nincreased incomes, credit, and FDI; and (iii) a booming construction sector. \n1.  External \n9.  The major external shock has been the rising cost of oil and fuel in early 2008. For \nViet Nam, this has occurred when domestic oil production and oil exports have declined by \n1.5% to 2.0%\u2014a trend that is expected to increase in the short run. Viet Nam is increasingly \nexposed to the international price of fuel for its own consumption and also for transporting the \ngrowing volume of export trade. The cost of mineral fuel imports rose by 150% from 2000 to \n2006. The subsidized nature of fuel prices meant that increased world prices placed pressure \non the government budget deficit.  \n10.  The growing demand for all commodities\u2014industrial and agricultural\u2014placed additional \npressures on the economy. The price of steel, aluminum, and cement all experienced increased \ninternational  demand,  largely  from  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  India,  resulting  in \nsignificant  price  increases  that  often  exceeded  100%.  For  industrial  commodities,  the \nburgeoning industrial sector requires increased raw material input, and there was little choice for \nthe construction sector but to accept additional costs. For agricultural commodities, Viet Nam \nwas able to benefit from higher rice prices as a major exporter of rice\u2014export receipts from rice \nincreased nearly 40% since 2005. However, this is mostly offset by the increase in non-rice food \nimports, which increased 300% from 2000 to 2005. \n11.  At the same time, FDI continued to increase, and through the first 5 months of 2008 FDI \ngrew at 134% compared with the same period in 2007. The FDI places additional demand \npressure on local prices and the need for imports. \n2.  Internal \n12.  Food prices rose rapidly during the first half of 2008, with Government Statistics Office \nreporting  increases  amounting  to  55%\u201360%  over  the  first  6  months  and  other  foodstuffs \nincreasing by over 20%. The effect on the lower income earners and the poor was dramatic, \nand the Government responded with an increase in the minimum wage from D450,000 per \nmonth to D540,000 per month. With food contributing nearly 43% of the basket of goods that \nmake up the CPI, other price increases were delayed by the Government.  \n ", "30   Appendix 3 \n13.  The growing cost of subsidies resulted in the Government increasing prices of fuel in \nJune 2008. These price increases averaged 36% for domestic oil, 31% for gasoline, and 14.3% \nfor diesel. These increases are not yet fully reflected in the CPI.  \n14.  In response, inflation rates in Viet Nam are the highest in Asia reaching 21.8% in \nJanuary\u2013June 2008. As such, the rate of inflation for 2008 is now expected to exceed 25%. In \nJuly 2008, the impact of food price increases has reduced slightly on a monthly basis as new \nseason harvest begins and international fears of rice shortages diminish. Provisional data for \nJuly place the annual inflation rate at over 27%\u2014the highest since 1991. At these levels, output \ngrowth will fall by 26%, imports will increase by 29%, and the provisional estimate of the trade \ndeficit will be D18.8 billion.  \n15.  The economic growth rate forecast for 2008 has been reduced to 6.5%. The open nature \nof the economy, combined with the range of new threats and pressures, has made Viet Nam \nmore susceptible to the changing global economy and especially the likelihood of increased \nglobal inflation. The challenge is to manage these pressures within the current management \nframework, without experience to draw upon. The rate of increase of foreign reserves and credit \nto balance trade payments in a period demanding tightening of monetary policy will be a difficult \ntask and will test the Government\u2019s commitment to market-based systems.  \nC.  Government Responses \n16.  In response to accelerating inflation and the ballooning current account deficit, in March \n2008 the Government essentially changed its top policy priority from maintaining high growth \nrates to curbing inflation and reducing the trade deficit. In January\u2013June 2007, it took a range of \nmeasures aimed at achieving these objectives. Among them were tightening of monetary and \nfiscal policies. The minimum reserve requirements for banks and the policy interest rates were \nraised  considerably.  While  budgetary  expenditure  on  targeted  social  assistance  programs \nincreased, administrative and capital expenditures were cut substantially. Investments by SOEs \n(especially in noncore businesses) were curtailed.  \n17.  There are signs that these measures are restraining growth of aggregate demand and \nreducing the macroeconomic imbalances. Growth of money supply slowed down from 46.1% in \n2007 to an annualized rate of 15.7% in the first quarter of 2008. The balance of the consolidated \nbudget turned from a deficit of 5.5% of GDP in 2007 to a surplus of 0.4% of GDP in the first half \nof 2008. Year-on-year GDP growth moderated to 6.5% in January\u2013June 2008. Monthly inflation \ndecelerated from 3.9% in May 2008 to 2.1% in June 2008, with the rise of food prices slowing \ndown  from  4.6%  to  2.3%.  The  trade  deficit  narrowed  from  $3.4  billion  in  March  2008  to \n$0.8 billion in July 2008. In a sign that foreign investors remain optimistic about Viet Nam\u2019s \nmedium-term economic prospects, new FDI commitments soared to $31.6 billion in the first half \nof 2008 from $20.3 billion for the entire year of 2007. \n18.  The measures introduced by the Government include the following: \n(i)  Tightening of monetary policy with three interest rate increases to the interbank \nprime rate (currently 14%) and the imposition of a 30% cap on credit growth \ncompared with 55% growth in 2007. The State Bank of Viet Nam has introduced \nthese measures to reduce liquidity arising from both FDI and portfolio inflows. \nSome  local  businesses  operating  in  export  markets  have  already  reported \ndifficulty  exchanging  foreign  currency  for  dong  to  pay  wages  and  rent.  The \n ", "Appendix 3             31 \nimposition  of  stricter  lending  rules,  expansion  of  future  bond  issues,  and \nincreased bank reserves all seek to absorb local currency and reduce liquidity \n(ii)  Fiscal constraint through reducing government and SOE spending by 25%. This \nis  to  be  achieved  by  slowing  down  publicly  funded  development.  Essential \ninfrastructure, such as roads, ports, and electricity are not included but low-\nefficiency projects are targeted. \n(iii)  Exchange rate flexibility to enable the dong to appreciate against the US dollar \nbeyond the agreed trading band of 0.75%\u20132.00% to reduce imports. However, \nthis will weaken export growth. \n(iv)  The possible introduction of import controls in an attempt to reduce the cost of \nimports by $0.5 million for raw materials, components, and machinery. A further \nsaving of $1 billion in consumer goods, $1.5 million savings on steel imports, and \n$1 million saving on oil. The controls are yet to be announced but will either be \ndirect controls or through imposing import duties and fees.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n ", "32  Appendix 4            \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCING \nA.  Price Escalation \n1.  The Project was designed in 2005 as an emergency response to calamitous damages \narising from typhoon and cyclonic storms. However, the loan was not effective until April 2007 \nafter 14 months during which some of the original core subprojects were funded out of necessity \nby the Government. During the period following project effectiveness, detailed designs and \nfeasibility studies were undertaken and initial contract awards were only completed in the last \nquarter of 2007 and first quarter of 2008.  \n2.  The impact of inflation has been significant and the effect compounded by the sector-like \ndisbursement modality that applies no price contingency. Usually, the Government would be \nexpected to apply available funds to the list of subprojects with any shortfall being managed \nthrough a reduction in scope. Under (i) an emergency response loan, and (ii) the extreme \nimpact  of  price  escalation  experienced  by  Viet  Nam,  changes  in  scope  are  considered \ninappropriate.  \n3.  The timing of the preparation of bidding documentation has meant that some bidding \ndocuments were issued before the wage increase announcement, thus indicative budgets had \nno allowance for price increases caused by labor costs, fuel costs, or construction materials. As \nsuch, these contract prices are now insufficient to complete the required works program.  \n4.  The CPI data in Table A4.1 highlights the impact of inflation on the construction sector in \nrural Viet Nam. Construction costs along with food have increased more than 20% in the first \n6 months of 2008. Provisional data for June\u2013July 2008 suggests that the inflation rate has \nreached 26%\u201327% compared with the same period in 2007. For the Project, price escalation \nfrom time of supplying bid documents (September 2007) to June 2008 is estimated to be 19.9%, \ncomprising 1.3% per month for October\u2013December 2007 (3.9%) and 15.97% for the first 6 \nmonths of 2008.  \nTable A4.1: Rural Cost Price Index for Viet Nam \n \nIndex in June 2008 compared with (%)  Index for the \nfirst half year in \nItem  Base year  June  December  May  2008 with same \n2005  2007  2007  2008  period in 2007 \nConsumer price index  143.57  127.22  119.01  102.10  120.36 \nFood and foodstuff  168.73  145.81  131.25  103.23  132.96 \nHousing and construction \nmaterials   145.64  125.29  115.97  101.58  121.18 \nSource: Government Statistics Office.     \n \n5.  The scheduled project completion date of June 2009 will see estimated price increases \nof 12% from July to December 2008 and 1.17% per month during 2009. Some subprojects are \ncompleted prior to this or have materials paid early in the period so are not affected to the same \ndegree. The different sectors also have a markedly different profile regarding the sources of \ncontract price escalation. From four case study contracts (Table A4.2), contract price escalation \nestimates ranged from 25% to 28%.1 However, the relative contribution from different inputs \n                                                \n1  The case studies applied the same timelines to demonstrate the impact of input inflation. \n ", "Appendix 4             33 \nvaries significantly for each sector. Price escalation on materials constitutes about two thirds to \nthree  fourths  of  the  overall  price  escalation  for  each  sector;  the  main  materials  are  rock, \naggregate, cement, and steel. For road subprojects, price escalation on fuel constitutes more \nthan 20%, which is more than double that in the other sectors, reflecting the mechanical nature \nof road construction. Price escalation on wages constitutes over one third of the price escalation \nfor the flood protection subprojects while fuel comprises a significantly lower proportion of the \ntotal price escalation. \nTable A4.2: Composition of Contract Price Escalation\u2014Case Study Contracts \n(%) \nContract  Input Contribution \nCase Study Sector  Escalation  Labor  Materials  Fuel \nIrrigation  26  25  66  9 \nRoads  27  17  62  21 \nFlood Protection  25  35  60  5 \nSocial Infrastructure   28  23  75  2 \nSource: Provincial reports to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. \n \n6.  The determination of final price escalation can only be indicative. Viet Nam\u2019s design \nprocess requires that a budget be included in a bidding document as the ceiling budget. Many \nfeasibility  studies  were  completed  during  2007  and  offered  for  bidding.  The  contractor \nresponses to these documents in early 2008 using 2008 prices would exceed the ceiling and \nresult in a noncomplying bid. Instead, contractors used unit prices applying at the time of the bid \npreparation. The rate of increase on these contracts is likely to be substantially higher than for \nthose bids prepared after the recent price increases to labor, etc.  \n7.  Prices  also  escalate  through  the  period  until  project  completion  and  any  delays \ncompound the impact of inflation. The causes of delays for subprojects are (i) weather or \nseasonal constraints to construction, especially construction for flood protection and dikes; \n(ii) the extension of the project and disbursement period by an additional 18 months through to \nmid-2011 to enable later contracts to be completed; and (iii) procedural delays relating to the \ngovernment process for adjusting existing contracts for subproject implementation. \n8.  Furthermore, although contracts are awarded for a contract period, contractors receive \nmobilization advances that are used to purchase materials in advance to start work. These \nadvances offset the risk of future price increases, with the overall effect of inflation being \nreduced. Given the significantly different mix of materials and labor, and the above variations, \nthe estimate of financing shortfall is described below. \nB.  Estimating Project Financing Shortfall  \n9.  The estimation of the project financing shortfall was undertaken for each subproject and \naggregated to the provincial level. At the subproject level, expenses were split into (i) civil \nworks, (ii) project management, (iii) other expenses, and (iv) contingencies. The civil works \nexpenses were then split into the bid packages or packages to be bid with the bid price, bid \nopening date, and contract completion dates identified.  \n10.  Prices were inflated for the periods between the bid opening dates and the expected \ncompletion date for each contract. The bid opening date, however, is not always appropriate as \ndiscussed above. Therefore, to ensure coverage for this in the assessment of the financing \nshortfall, an additional 3 months of price escalation for the period prior to the bid opening date \nwas included.   \n ", "34   Appendix 4 \n11.  Costs  that  were  inflated  include  (i)  construction  and  civil  works,  (ii)  equipment, \n(iii) project management and supervision costs, and (iv) insurance and auditing costs. Inflation \nfactors used were based on the construction CPI data released by the Government Statistics \nOffice as shown in Table A4.3. The factors were applied to the bid price where available or to \nthe cost estimate where bids were not available.  \nTable A4.3: Price Escalation Factors Applied \n(%) \nJuly\u2013December \nItem \nBid to June 2008  2008  2009  2010\u20132011 \nPeriod Average   19.9  12  14  10 \nMonthly Rate   3.3  2  1.2  0.8 \nSource: Government Statistics Office. \n \n12.  Each subproject has a contingency factor applied at the provincial project management \nunit (PPMU). This factor is not included in the contract but is retained in the imprest account. \nThe use of the budgeted contingency amount is based on a decision between contractor and \nproject supervisor who jointly apply to the PPMU for its application. The PPMU submits the \nrequest to the provincial peoples committee, which makes the final decision. If supported, the \nPPMU  then  completes a  contract  variation. This  contingency figure  is  not  inflated,  as  the \nfinancing shortfall and price adjustment remove any adverse price effects. The scale of physical \nadjustment is unchanged. \n13.  To ensure that escalation factors were not applied to works already completed, the \nescalation factors were applied to a declining proportion of total cost in each consecutive period. \nThe average project cost overrun for priority subprojects is estimated to be 29% and totals \n$12.9  million.  The  bid  price  plus  the  cost  overrun  for  priority  subprojects  amounts  to \n$65.7 million or 114% of the total project cost.  \n14.  It is not possible to distinguish clearly which subprojects would remain incomplete in the \nabsence of supplementary financing. Many of the smaller subprojects required less design input \nand were contracted earlier while the larger subprojects have only recently started construction. \nThe number of subprojects estimated by the Central Project Management Unit (CPMU) and \nPPMUs that could not be completed is 25%. However, for some of these, the lack of completion \nmay be limited to final site clearances or restoration. For large priority subprojects, including sea \ndikes and river flood protection works, these would either have (i) incomplete structures or (ii) \nstructures that are reduced in scope to below the design specifications (i.e., reduced length and \nheights). One of the biggest impacts would be the lack of finance for enhancing subprojects that \nhave begun construction using designs that are considered unsafe or at risk. This includes risks \nto a school, essential infrastructure, and significant numbers of local residents. These risks also \ninclude a risk to the investment made to date which could, in some locations, face the risk of \npremature  failure  because  dikes  or  flood  protection  systems  have  gaps  or  inadequate \nconstruction standards. \n15.  The  summary  of  cost  escalation  and  financing  shortfall  by  province  is  shown  in \nTable A4.4. Provinces with a high proportion of priority subprojects will exceed the budget \nallocation, while those such as Quang Tri (with a high proportion of additional subprojects) will \nhave sufficient finances for their priority subprojects along with a surplus.  \n16.  Whereas the budget allocation provides indicative costs for additional subprojects, this \nhas not been undertaken in preparations for supplementary financing. The review mission found \nthat cost estimates had become the determinant of subproject design acting as a constraint, \n ", "Appendix 4             35 \nirrespective of site or technical needs. As such, major works were simplified and had their scope \nreduced to the level of the indicative budget. The mission discussed the need to move into a far \nmore sustainable form of subproject design based on site investigations and a design that \nresponds to the site and technical needs, and not simply a design for spending the budget.  \n17.  The scope of the design inputs also needs to be reconsidered. The current approach of \nfocusing on a site-based response to damages should be expanded to consider the whole \nsystem within which a site is located. For example, the current approach of building a river \nembankment to protect land on one side of a river, while successful, often results in damages \ndownstream on the opposite bank. A proper assessment would factor these impacts into the \ndesign process. The designs used in the first phase did not appear to consider these factors. \nThe requirement of prior approval of designs for additional subprojects is therefore critical to \nensure that this practice is discontinued.  \nC.   Procedures for Contract Adjustments  \n18.  The existing contracts held by the individual PPMUs will need to be adjusted for price \nescalation. The procedure is in accordance with government procedure as stated in Circular No: \n9/2008TT-BXD  issued  by  the  Ministry  of  Construction  on  17  April  2008,  which  has  been \nsupplemented by Circular No: 1551/BXD-KTXD dated 1 August 2008. The required approach is \nbased on a single price escalation factor for each contract, based on a weighted average for \neach cost category within the total contract multiplied by the ratio of new unit costs to units in \nthe current contract.  \n19.  A number of constraints need to be considered in this process. Requirements that have \ndirect impact are (i) only one adjustment is allowed per contract; (ii) future inflation is currently \nlimited to 10%; and (iii) the process relies on official unit prices, which may vary from current \nmarket prices. These factors require the timing of contract adjustment to be sufficiently late to \nenable as much actual information to be included in the adjustment while not being so late that \na contract stoppage is incurred as the procedure is completed. Ideally, the procedure would \noccur when disbursement on the original contract approaches 80%. \n20.  The agreed contract adjustment procedure includes the following steps:  \n(i)  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (MARD)  approves  budget \nallocation plan for subproject.  \n(ii)  PPMU,  contractor,  and  contract  supervisor  complete  price  escalation \ncalculation. \n(iii)  Provincial  people\u2019s  committee  (PPC)  and  Department  of  Agriculture  and \nRural Development (DARD) approve contract adjustment. \n(iv)  CPMU submits contract adjustment to Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n(v)  ADB approves adjustment. \n(vi)  PPMU and contractor make adjustment, sign revised contract, and submit a \ncopy to ADB. \n \n21.  CPMU will create a database of all project contracts, including the contract adjustments \nthat can be included in project reports, to ensure that an up-to-date reconciliation of available \nfunds is maintained. The database will be used as the basis for deciding on the use of unutilized \nfunds  for  (i)  completion  or  upgrading  of  priority  subprojects  to  a  sustainable  standard; \n(ii) completion of priority subprojects through increased technical design and/or scope to ensure \nsafety  conditions  of  structures,  protection  of  human  life,  and  protection  of  essential \ninfrastructure; and (iii) additional subprojects that meet the required selection criteria. \n ", "Appendix 4          36 \nTable A4.4: Price Escalation for Priority Subprojects  \n($\u2019000) \n \n   Provincial Project Management Unit \nNam  Phu  Ha  Thanh  Nghe  Quang  Quang  Phu \nSummary of Price Adjustment   Yen Bai  Dinh  Tho  Giang  Hoa  An  Ha Tinh  Binh  Tri  Yen  Total \nBudget Allocation   4,580   15,550   3,650   5,410   11,730   3,980   5,070   3,030   4,930   1,640   61,740  \nTotal Bid Price  5,370   13,400   6,156   4,050   7,803   3,886   3,709   3,025   3,729   1,704   55,413  \nPrice Adjustment for Current and  6,987   17,679   7,527   5,091   10,780   4,749   4,874   3,896   5,075   1,972   71,702  \nFuture Inflation \nIncrease (adjusted bid)  1,617   4,279   1,370   1,041   2,976   863   1,165   872   1,346   268   16,289  \nPrice increase (%)  30  32  22  26  38  22  31  29  36  16  29 \nSource: Provincial reports to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. \n \n \n \n ", "37  Appendix 5            \n \nDETAILED REVISED PROJECT COST ESTIMATES \nTable A5.1: Summary Revised Cost Estimates by Component  \n($ million) \nItem  Foreign  Local  Total \n1.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Government requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide emergency \nassistance to reinstate infrastructure damaged during July\u2013December 2005 by typhoons and \nstorms.  ADB  approved  the  Emergency  Rehabilitation  of  Calamity  Damage  Project  on \n21 November  2006  to  (i)  reinstate  roads,  flood  protection,  irrigation  systems,  and  social \ninfrastructure in the 10 most severely affected provinces; and (ii) provide enhanced storm and \nflood protection to vulnerable areas where feasible. An ADB project review mission in July\u2013\nAugust  2008  revealed  several  deficiencies  in  assessing  hazard  risks  and  developing \nappropriate solutions to the risks. This technical assistance (TA) for Hazard Risk Assessment \nusing Geo-Information Technology will support the Project by enhancing the Government's \ncapability to carry out risk and vulnerability assessments.  \n \n2.  Government  agencies 1  responsible  for  managing  natural  disasters  and  their \nconsequences lack the tools and skills needed to identify and assess vulnerable areas, and use \nthe results to formulate appropriate development choices and disaster avoidance strategies. \nAlthough they have some capability in the application of geographic information systems (GISs) \nand remote sensing, agencies lack the skills needed to implement and maintain up-to-date \nhazard  risk  assessments.  Recently,  the Water  Resources  University  (WRU)  began  a  new \nprogram on \u201cDisaster Management and Mitigation\u201d creating a need for lecturers to raise their \nskill levels in advanced hazard assessment techniques. The incorporation of modern hazard risk \nassessment tools in university curricula is clearly warranted by the susceptibility of the country \nto natural disasters. The TA will also be useful to professional staff within the Ministry of \nAgriculture and Rural Development (MARD) who are involved in disaster management. Hence, \nthere is an excellent opportunity with this TA to link academic and executive agencies. \n \n3.  In  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  (2004),  the  TA  will \nenhance  the  Government\u2019s  capability  to  (i)  carry  out  risk  and  vulnerability  assessments, \nincluding physical, economic, social, and environmental impacts; and (ii) mainstream prevention \nand  preparedness  activities  into  the  development  process.  The  TA  will  entail  two  main \ncomponents:  (i)  training,  and  (ii)  a  pilot  project  for  a  selected  province.  The  detail  of  the \ncomponents will be clarified in the TA design and preparation stage. The TA will enhance \ncapabilities to include alternative approaches, including nonstructural, to mitigate natural hazard \nrisks,  while  also  making  use  of  economic  tools  to  improve  the  planning,  design,  and \nsustainability of risk mitigation measures. The principle methodology to be used under the TA \nwill be training of academic staff and students of WRU in Ha Noi, as well as key staff of the \nCentral  Committee  for  Flood  and  Storm  Control  (CCFSC)  and  the  Department  of  Dike \nManagement, Flood and Storm Control (DDMFSC). Participants will be trained to apply geo-\ninformation technology for hazard risk assessment (specifically those hazards associated with \nwater-related natural disasters) in selected case study areas. Capacity to apply this technique \nwill be built through interactive courses. Training modules will be developed for incorporation \ninto an elective master\u2019s degree course at WRU.   \n                                                \n1  The Central Committee for Flood and Storm Control (CCFSC) was established in 1990 under the leadership of the \nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), with supporting provincial and district committees. CCFSC \nhelps the Government prepare for, respond to, and overcome natural disasters and their consequences. It \ncoordinates emergency response, and has a role in the recovery and reconstruction after disasters. CCFSC works \nin close liaison with MARD\u2019s Department of Dike Management, Flood and Storm Control (DDMFSC), which \nencompasses the Disaster Management Center. \n ", "Appendix 8       41 \n4.  The outputs of the TA will be (i) improved knowledge base of different types of natural \ndisasters, inventory of at-risk facilities, and hazard maps in selected areas; (ii) improved ability \nto use a computer-based GIS to assess hazard risks and prepare visual presentations of \nvulnerability, including the capability to assess and present risk and vulnerability in economic, \nsocial, and physical terms; (iii) capability built within the relevant disaster management agencies \nto operate and maintain the database and decision-making tools; and (iv) capacity built among \nfaculty staff of WRU to use the training materials prepared under the TA. Training under the TA \nwill target staff of (i) CCFSC; (ii) DDMFSC in MARD and from provincial offices; and (iii) the \nremote sensing and GIS lab of WRU\u2019s Hydrological and Environmental Faculty. To encourage \nsustainability of project outputs, a working relationship with an international university should be \nestablished. \n \n5.  The TA is structured in three phases: (i) identification, (ii) design and preparation, and \n(iii) training implementation. The identification phase will (i) carry out an institutional analysis of \nthe relevant disaster management organizations to assess their capacity and ability to allocate \nkey staff for training; and (ii) conduct a training needs analysis as the basis for designing \ntraining courses and to identify suitable trainees, especially drawn from the international and \nnational consultants. Trainees may come from related agencies at central level and provincial \nlevel, especially provinces under the Emergency Rehabilitation of Calamity Damage Project. \nThe design and preparation phase will (i) design training courses and develop manuals for \nhazard risk assessment, (ii) prepare training materials and exercises, (iii) develop a pilot study \nto be used for project-based learning during the TA, and (iv) collect data and prepare it in a \nformat suitable for formal courses in risk management. The training implementation phase will \n(i) train selected staff in hazard risk assessment using GIS and remote sensing; (ii) demonstrate \nthe application of GIS and remote sensing for hazard risk assessment in the selected case \nstudy area in Viet Nam; (iii) conduct a workshop using course participants as mediators to \ntransfer the fundamentals of the methodology to colleagues, managers, and decision makers of \nrelevant organizations; (iv) develop a web-based training package (in digital and hard versions) \nfor information dissemination to other stakeholders; and (v) after the end of the project, organize \na donor coordination workshop to assess the outcome of the TA and expand the scope (e.g., to \nmore provinces). It is important that the case study emphasize the development of capacity to \nanalyze  and  interpret  modeling  results  for  the  development  of  effective  hazard  mitigation \nmeasures. The trainees will present their newly acquired knowledge and working ability in \nhazard risk assessment.  \n \nB.  Yen Bai Province as a Case Study \n \n6.  Yen Bai province is tentatively proposed to be the case study. It is located in the area \nbetween the highlands and midlands east of Hoang Lien mountains. The Red River (the biggest \nriver in the northern Viet Nam) flows through the province, dividing it into lowlands and mid-\nrange mountains on the left (northern) bank and hills and mountainous terrain on the other side. \nThe town of Yen Bai has about 78,000 inhabitants according to the 2004 census. Yen Bai town \nis  experiencing  rapid  growth,  which  is  expected  to  continue  until  2020  because  of  the \nconstruction of an international highway to the People\u2019s Republic of China. Industry is relatively \nsmall and agricultural food production in the area can be characterized by small farms with a \nlow level of mechanization.  \n \n7.  The selected study area includes most of the town and is a watershed with an area of \nabout 140 square kilometers (km2). The streams Hien Duong, Au Lau, Yen Ninh, Yen Thinh and \nDai Dong flow through the town into the Red River. Although the discharge of these streams is \ngenerally low (less than 1 cubic meter per second), they are prone to flashfloods that can cause \n ", "42  Appendix 8   \nsignificant  damage  and  create  problems  for  local  people.  The  area is  also  affected  by \nlandslides, especially during the rainy season. Slopes are often modified by human activities, \nsuch as road and house construction; and are often steeply cut, making them more susceptible \nto future instability.  \n \n8.  In 2005 and 2006, two successive rainstorms hit Yen Bai, which caused the worst flash \nfloods and landslides of the last 40 years. The flash flood after torrential rain on 27 September \n2005  induced  a  number  of  small  landslides,  causing  76  deaths  and an  economic  loss  of \nD350 billion (CCFSC). The prolonged rainfall on 19 August 2006 was less serious, but killed 9 \npeople and caused an estimated loss of more than D25 billion (CCFSC).2 These events show \nthe urgency of addressing the problems of landslides and flash floods in Yen Bai. The town \nneeds to increase its capacity in geo-hazard assessment and requires additional tools to include \nthese hazards in the urban planning process. This makes Yen Bai town an ideal pilot study \nlocation for hazard risk assessment. \n \n9.  Yen Bai province is also suitable for the case study as it has many important databases \nneeded to carry out a pilot study. It appears that necessary digitized maps are available, such \nas base maps (including contour lines, stream and river system, administration boundaries, \nannotations); geological maps; hydrological maps; geomorphology maps (including geological, \ngeo-morphological units); and soil maps. However, it should be confirmed that maps are freely \navailable for the project prior to finalizing the case study province choice. Additionally, there is a \nremote sensing database, including LandSat enhanced thematic mapper and thematic mapper \nfrom 1990 to 2001, 2005, 2007; and hard copies of aerial photographs scaled 1:33,000 with \nvarious time scales. Finally, a flood database is available, including precipitation records from \nthe 1960s to present and discharge records in digital format at Yen Bai Provincial Department of \nNatural Resources and Environment; and historical flood maps in digital and hard copy, and \nflood loss and damage records\u2014both available at DDMFSC. \n \nC.  Management Arrangements \n \n10.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be MARD. WRU will be the implementing agency \nin cooperation with Disaster Management Center under DDMSFC. WRU is suitably equipped to \nbe an implementing agency for this TA. WRU maintains more than 100 computers with high-\nspeed local area network connection at the Center of Informatics. WRU has capabilities in \nremote  sensing  and  a  laboratory. WRU  maintains  required  capabilities,  including  GIS  and \nremote sensing software; database (e.g., digital base maps, satellite images, aerial photos); and \nother facilities  (e.g.,  handheld global  positioning  system,  stereoscope). WRU  may  need to \nupgrade its computers out of the university budget prior to initiation of the project. \n \nD.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The total cost of the technical assistance is estimated at $625,000, out of which the \nRepublic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund will provide a grant of $500,000 \nequivalent  to  be  administered  by  ADB,  while  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  will  contribute \n$125,000, largely in kind, for office accommodation and transport, costs of counterpart staff, and \nother items.  \n \n                                                \n2  2005 & 2006.

In  July\u2013August  2008,  the  Fact-Finding  Mission  for  supplementary  financing  of  the \nEmergency  Rehabilitation  of  Calamity  Damage  Project 1  was  conducted  to  review \nimplementation of existing subprojects, including cost overruns; and to assess the potential for \nprocessing of supplementary financing relevant to additional rehabilitation projects. In particular, \nincreasing costs, price inflation, and implementation delays can have a significant impact on the \neconomic viability and financial feasibility of the subprojects. This appendix reexamines the \neconomic viability and financial feasibility of the subprojects. \n \n2.  Since  the  Project  was  originally  designed  in  2005,  Viet  Nam  has  experienced  a \nsignificant increase in inflation\u2014causing project costs to rise dramatically. According to the \nGeneral Statistics Office of Viet Nam, the overall consumer price index (CPI) rate reached \n27.2% year on year for June 2008. Compared with 2005, inflation as measured by the CPI has \nrisen 43.57%. However, CPI increases have not been even across all sectors. Table A9.1 \nshows that the change in the CPI for food, 208% since 2005, has greatly outpaced increases in \nthe price for housing and construction materials, which was 146% during the same period.  \n \nTable A9.1:  Consumer Price Index\u2014Rural Areas in Viet Nam (June 2008) \nIndex in the \nfirst half \nyear in 2008 \ncompared \nIndex in June 2008 compared with (%) \nwith same \nBase year  June  December  period in \nItem  2005  2007  2007  May 2008  2007 \nConsumer price index  143.57  127.22  119.01  102.10  120.36 \nFood and foodstuff  168.73  145.81  131.25  103.23  132.96 \nOf which: Food   207.80  171.25  157.22  104.48  137.74 \nHousing and construction materials a  145.64  125.29  115.97  101.58  121.18 \na Including housing, electricity, water, fuel and construction materials. \nSource: General Statistics Office of Viet Nam. http://www.gso.gov.vn/ \n \n3.  These relative changes in the prices have a direct impact on the economic viability of a \nsubproject. The changes may be neutral or even beneficial, e.g., if inflation in project benefits is \ngreater than increases in project costs, economic viability will improve. However, if project costs \nare rising faster than the value of benefits, then the economic viability of the subproject will \nworsen. For many subprojects, benefits were calculated as an increase in the net value of \nagricultural production. Table A9.1 shows that rural food prices have far outstripped inflation in \nrural construction costs over the last year and since 2005. Assuming that inflation in food prices \nhas kept pace with increases in the price of farm inputs, this would indicate that, in general, \nsubproject economic viability has been maintained or improved based on the original analytical \napproach. Unfortunately, analysis of the impact of inflation on farm inputs and outputs, and thus \nnet production value, was not possible during the mission. Thus, benefits were maintained \nduring the reexamination of subproject viability. \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2006.

Each type of subproject has a unique set of economic \nbenefits, which are discussed below. The primary benefit of irrigation projects is increased \nagricultural production, which is measured as the incremental increase in net farm income for \nthe project area. These are the benefits most often used in analysis of economic viability. \nSecondary benefits of irrigation projects can include improved drainage function (reduced or \navoided flood damage) and multiple use benefits, such as water for cleaning and drinking. \nQuantifying secondary benefits is difficult and not normally done. \n \n5.  The primary economic benefit of road projects is reduced travel costs found through \nreduced fuel consumption and travel time. Typically, a survey is made of existing travel volumes \non the target road and projections are made of future travel volumes. Fuel consumption and \ntravel times are estimated and monetized. The estimated difference in the value of travel costs \nis then taken as the project benefit. The process of developing the necessary data can be quite \ncostly and time-consuming. Viet Nam faces an additional problem, as the transportation profile \nis changing rapidly, both in mode and volume. In general, the subproject feasibility studies \ncalculated economic benefits based on projected cost reductions from improved road quality, \nincreased traffic volume, and changes in transportation mode. \n \n6.  The primary economic benefit of flood protection projects (i.e., sea dikes and river \nembankments) is the value of expected damage avoided. Typically, three components are \nnecessary to make this calculation: (i) probability of a flood event occurring, (ii) probability of \ndike failure, and (iii) a damage function based on the magnitude of the flood event. When \nestimating benefits of flood protection projects, it is critical that negative impacts arising from the \naltered hydrologic processes are included as a negative benefit. The data requirements for such \nestimates  are  quite  intensive  and  include  a  non-negligible  amount  of  uncertainty.  In  the \nexamined subproject feasibility studies, either no attempt is made to estimate economic benefits \nor  benefits  are  estimated  as  changes  in  production  values  as  projected  by  the  local \nsocioeconomic development plan\u2014the assumption being that protection from flood damage will \nallow the area to pursue economic development strategies successfully. While this approach \nhas some legitimacy, it does not accurately assess the reduction in vulnerability, which is the \nmain objective of a flood protection project. \n \n7.  The primary economic benefit of social projects is less direct, but can include the value \nfrom achieving a higher education level, improved health care, and more active markets. While \nit is possible to quantify these benefits, given the focus on social benefits and the emergency \nnature of the subprojects, it is likely not worthwhile to pursue an attempt to quantify these \nbenefits for economic analysis.  \n \n8.  Maintaining the financial feasibility of the subprojects is also an issue of concern. None \nof the 47 subprojects has a revenue flow, so financial feasibility will not exist for any of the \nsubprojects. Instead, subproject sustainability is emphasized with a focus on operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) budgets that are sufficient to maintain the benefit stream throughout the life \nof the Project. In general, responsibility for O&M is contracted after completion of construction. \nThe regular maintenance budget is calculated according to government regulation in line with a \nnorm (percentage of total capital costs) for (i) length of road, (ii) irrigated area, or (iii) length of \ndike or embankment. There is also a standardized norm for recurring repair, which increases in \npercentage by year. If maintenance contracts are concluded after completion of subproject \nconstruction, then costs can be adjusted accordingly.  \n \n ", "48  Appendix 9        \n9.  The process for budgeting for O&M is to set a standardized amount according to total \nconstruction costs. The district or provincial government holds responsibility for covering these \nregular maintenance costs out of its general budget. In the case of repairs, the managing \nagency makes a budget request to the responsible district or provincial level entity. Interviews \nwith  the  Department  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (DARD),  provincial  project \nmanagement unit (PPMU), and local consultants during the mission presented mixed results as \nto the adequacy of this process in meeting actual O&M needs. Experience in past and ongoing \ninfrastructure programs clearly indicates that O&M expenditure is generally well below the level \nrequired to sustain the capital investment. \n \n10.  It is crucial that the issue of O&M budget adequacy is resolved, as insufficient O&M \nbudgets will result in a failure to maintain projected subproject benefit streams. This will reduce \nand possibly undermine the economic viability of a subproject. However, even if adequate \ninitially, there appears to be no automatic inflation adjustment so that O&M budgets suffer a \nregular decline in real terms. \n \n11.  During the mission, numerous subprojects were reviewed and it was found that the \neconomic  methodology across  different  subprojects  was  essentially  the  same.  Additionally, \nspreadsheets containing the economic analysis were requested from each PPMU and DARD. \nHowever, very few of these were obtained. Four subprojects were selected to reassess the \neconomic viability under the new cost revisions, including three sea dikes and one road.2 The \nassessments are presented below (paragraphs 12\u201315). The reassessment uses the perspective \nof the subproject being designed by comparing two scenarios for capital costs: (i) with the \nexpected capital cost at the time of design; and (ii) with inflated investment costs as at the time \nof processing the supplementary financing, but not considering the investment already incurred \nas sunk costs, which would substantially increase the subproject economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR). \n \n12.  The  Hai Thanh  sea  dike  subproject  in Thanh Hoa  Province  was  used  to  test the \neconomic viability with updated cost estimates. The feasibility study gives an EIRR of 18.33%, \nwhere 50% of full annual project benefits are realized during the second year of construction. To \nupdate the economic viability, several adjustments were made. Project life is assumed to equal \n30 years. First, the updated cost figures give a longer project construction period with higher \ncosts, so realization of full project benefits is delayed by 2 years. Second, project benefits are \nassumed to begin being realized in the second year, increasing with each year of construction, \nand are estimated as a percentage of eventual full subproject benefits. Third, project O&M costs \nare increased in accordance with 1.5% of increased construction costs. Lastly, additional costs \nare included for repairs at 5-year intervals and equal to 1% of construction costs per year of \nproject life (e.g., 5% in year 5, 10% in year 10). This is a fairly standard method for estimating \nrepair budgets in Viet Nam. The updated economic viability for the Hai Thanh sea dike, with the \nrevised costs, was calculated as 16.15%. The impact of inflation is that maintenance costs \nwould need to rise 14 percentage points more than the rate for benefits on an annual basis to \nreduce the EIRR below 12%. Such a high rate of inflation is unlikely to persist for such a lengthy \nperiod. Finally, if the O&M budget is inadequate, project benefits would need to decline at a rate \nof 4% per year to push the EIRR below 12%.  \n \n13.  The feasibility study for the Xuan Quy\u2013Thanh Quan Road in Thanh Hoa Province \nreported an EIRR of 18.04% based on original assumptions. The figures in the spreadsheet, \n                                                \n2  Interviews with DARD staff indicate that, for flood embankment subprojects, few were assessed from an economic \nfeasibility perspective because of the complexity of analysis and lack of available data.  \n ", "Appendix 9       49 \nhowever, yield an EIRR of 18.58%. The EIRR of 18.58% will be used here as the baseline for \ncomparison. O&M estimates include a budget for regular maintenance and for larger repairs \nequal to 5% of subproject costs in year 5 and 20% in year 10. The year 5 and year 10 O&M \ncosts are then repeated at year 15 and year 20. The project life is assumed to be 20 years. \nConstruction is assumed to be completed in 1 year and project benefits start to be realized in \nthe second year. For the revision, the project time line is extended by 3 years to account for the \nlonger construction period, but still maintaining the original 19-year benefit stream. O&M costs \nwere increased in accordance with the higher cost estimates. Benefits were increased by 25%, \nwhich is about the year-on-year inflation rate for rural housing and construction costs (including \nfuel) as reported for June 2008 by the General Statistics Office of Viet Nam. The updated \neconomic viability for the Xuan Quy Thanh Quan Road, with the revised cost figures, was \ncalculated as 14.86%. If O&M is inadequate to maintain project benefits, a 3% annual decrease \nin benefits will push the calculated EIRR below 12%. \n \n14.  The feasibility study for the Giao Thuy sea dike in Nam Dinh Province reports an EIRR \nof 20.28%. Construction is spread over 3 years and the project life is considered as 25 years. \nBenefits are calculated as increases in agricultural production in the protected area and are \nadjusted for changes in input use. The feasibility study reports that benefits include production \nincreases in agriculture, aquaculture, and salt; as well as reductions in storm damage and \nmaintenance costs. Annual expected damage avoided is equated to 5% of total damages \ncaused by the 2005 storm event. The 5% is based on the presumed frequency of the storm \nevent.  The  economic  viability  was  recalculated  based  on  the  revised  cost  estimates.  The \nconstruction period is extended by 1 year. O&M costs are revised according to a specified \npercentage of the revised costs. Inflation affects both inputs and outputs for agriculture and \naquaculture, but it was not possible to estimate the recent net affect. Therefore, the value of \nsubproject benefits was retained as originally presented. The updated economic viability for the \nGiao Thuy sea dike, with the revised cost figures, was calculated as 20.17%. Improvements in \nviability  from  reduced  costs  are  offset  by  the  extended  construction  period.  Inflation  of \nmaintenance costs would need to outpace inflation on the benefits side by 12.5 percentage \npoints to push the subproject EIRR below 12%. If the O&M budget is inadequate to maintain \nsubproject benefits, it would take an annual decline of 5% of benefits to cause the subproject to \nfail the economic viability test. \n \n15.  The feasibility study for the Hai Hau sea dike in Nam Dinh Province reports an EIRR of \n15.63%. The spreadsheet reported an EIRR of 16.78% and the summary investment report \nannex gives an EIRR of 15.67% (although the numbers in the accompanying table actually yield \nan EIRR of 15.54%). For purposes of recalculating the economic viability with revised cost \nestimates, the project costs and benefits included in the spreadsheet will be used. In the \nHai Hau sea dike case, project benefits are limited to increases in agriculture. As it is not \npossible to discern a net impact on agricultural production value caused by inflationary forces, \nthe original benefit estimates are retained here. The updated economic viability for the Hai Hau \nsea dike, with the revised cost figures, was calculated as 11.40%. It must be stressed that the \nfull range of benefits was not included in the calculations presented in the feasibility study, and \nthe EIRR is likely higher than 11.40%. Impacts of inflation on cost and inadequate O&M on \nbenefits were not calculated as the revised estimate is already below the 12% viability mark.   \n \n16.  Four  subprojects  were  used  to  recalculate  EIRR  values  and  are  summarized  in \nTable A9.2. All but one subproject retains its economic viability using the revised cost estimates. \nThe reassessment provided here takes the analyses provided in the feasibility studies as given, \nand only corrects some errors without altering the general approach. In some case, the O&M \nbudgets were increased to account for the need to make repairs greater than those covered by \n ", "50  Appendix 9        \na regular maintenance budget. Sufficient O&M budgets are critical for the sustainability of \nproject  benefits  and  maintenance  of  project  economic  viability.  Moreover,  the  presence  of \nsufficient O&M budgets can be considered as a proxy test for financial feasibility. Most projects \naccount for regular maintenance costs and a larger repair budget. These O&M budgets were \ncalculated according to government regulations. Most interviews during the mission stated that \nthe reported O&M budgets would be sufficient to cover actual maintenance needs, but it is not \npossible to verify whether this is correct. \n \nTable A9.2: Revised EIRRs for Selected Subprojects Using Inflated Cost Estimates \n(%) \n  EIRR    Sensitivity \nCost inflation to  Annual decline \npush EIRR  in benefits due \nWith \nbelow 12%  to inadequate \nSubproject  Original  Revised \nassuming  O&M to push \nCosts \nbenefits have  EIRR below \n0% inflation  12% \nThanh Hoa\u2013Hai Thanh  18.33  15.15  14.0  4.0 \nSea Dike \nThanh Hoa\u2013Xuan Quy\u2013  18.58  14.86    3.0 \nThanh Quan Road \nNam Dinh\u2013Hai Hau Sea  16.78  11.40     \nDike \nNam Dinh\u2013Giao Thuy  20.28  20.17  12.5  5.0 \nSea Dike \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return; O&M = operations and maintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20081118093724Z", "Author": "t7h", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2", "Keywords": "adb proposed supplementary loans, viet nam emergency rehabilitation, calamity damage project, geographic information system, hazard risk assessment, storm and flood protection, agriculture and rural development, adb project 40282", "Producer": "GPL Ghostscript 8.15", "ModDate": "D:20081210153326+08'00'", "Title": "Proposed Supplementary Loan: Emergency Rehabilitation of Calamity Damage Project"}, "author_page": " \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 7 November 2008) \n \nCurrency Unit  \u2013  dong (D) \n \nD1.00  =  $0.000594 \n$1.00  =  D16,838 \n     \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  CCFSC  \u2013  Central Committee for Flood and Storm Control \n  CPI  \u2013  consumer price index \n  CPMU  \u2013  Central Project Management Unit \n  DARD  \u2013  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development \n  DDMFSC  \u2013  Department of Dike Management, Flood and Storm Control \n  EIRR  \u2013  economic internal rate of return \n  FDI  \u2013  foreign direct investment \n  GDP  \u2013  gross domestic product \n  GIS  \u2013  geographic information system \n  ICB  \u2013  international competitive bidding \n  IEE  \u2013  initial environmental examination \n  IPDF  \u2013  indigenous peoples development framework \n  MARD  \u2013  Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development \n  NCB  \u2013  national competitive bidding \n  O&M  \u2013  operation and maintenance \n  PPC  \u2013  provincial people\u2019s committee \n  PPMU  \u2013  provincial project management unit \n  RRP  \u2013  report and recommendation of the President \n  SDR  \u2013  special drawing rights \n  SOE  \u2013  state-owned enterprise \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n  WRU  \u2013  Water Resources University \n \n \nNOTE \n \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \n \nVice-President  C.
