THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based loan to the Republic of Uzbekistan for subprogram 2 of the Economic Management \nImprovement Program.1 \n \n2.  The  proposed subprogram  2  aims to  strengthen  economic management  to  support \nmacroeconomic stability and sustained growth in Uzbekistan.2 It supports the efforts of the \ngovernment to (i) strengthen economic data collection, analysis, and dissemination systems to \nbolster economic decision-making; (ii) introduce public financial management (PFM) reforms to \nensure fiscal sustainability; (iii) strengthen banking supervision and financing of the private \nsector; and (iv) improve governance in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to make their operations \nfinancially sustainable. Subprogram 2, included in the 2019 pipeline of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) country operations business plan for Uzbekistan, 2019\u20132021, is fully aligned with \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2019\u20132023 and one of the key operational priorities under \nStrategy 2030 in strengthening governance and institutional capacity for public management \nreforms.3 \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n3.  Uzbekistan is a landlocked and lower-middle-income economy in Central Asia with a \npopulation of 33 million and a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of $1,550 as of 2018. \nAfter  independence  from  the  Soviet  Union  in  1991,  Uzbekistan  has  pursued  an  import-\nsubstitution model, implemented through state investments and directed credit to SOEs; foreign \nexchange controls; and tariff and nontariff barriers on foreign trade. The SOEs have enjoyed \npreferential access to physical and financial resources while being sheltered from domestic and \nexternal competition. Under this model, Uzbekistan had an average GDP growth of over 7% per \nannum during 2010\u20132016, driven by (i) strong global demand for its export products (copper, \nnatural gas, gold, and cotton); (ii) disciplined macroeconomic management; and (iii) a strong \nfiscal position, which was partially the result of limited exposure to world financial markets. \nBuoyant  export  performance,  aided  by  high  commodity  prices,  helped  generate  budgetary \nrevenues  that  financed  large-scale  infrastructure  investment  and  industrial  modernization. \nRemittances of the Uzbek migrant workers, mainly from the Russian Federation, and increases \nin public sector wages and pensions supported consumption growth. \n \n4.  The real GDP growth in Uzbekistan decelerated from 6.1% in 2016 to 4.5% in 2017 \nbecause of the adverse effects of the declining global commodity prices, subdued growth in \nexport  destination  countries,4 and  the  economic  downturn  in  the  Russian  Federation.5 In \nresponse, the government initiated countercyclical fiscal and monetary policies to stimulate \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018.

Subprogram 1 ($300 million) was approved on 26 June 2018 with attached technical assistance (TA).  \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  ADB. 2018.

", "2 \ndemand, including comprehensive exchange rate reform to resolve the distortions associated \nwith limited access to foreign exchange, a key deterrent to foreign investment and private sector \ndevelopment. The reforms liberalized the foreign exchange market in September 2017 to allow \nunfettered  access  to  foreign  currency  and  unified  multiple  exchange  rates.  However, \ndevaluation of the local currency by 48% and changes in relative prices because of price \nliberalization, led to rising inflation from 8.8% in 2016 to 13.9% in 2017 and to 17.5% in 2018. \nReflecting adjustments in prices and subsequent tariff hikes of utilities, upward pressure on \nprices remains, with inflation projected at 14.7% in 2019 and 14.1% in 2020.6 \n \n5.  On the positive side, Uzbekistan\u2019s macroeconomic stance has remained prudent. Real \nGDP growth has accelerated to 5.1% in 2018, driven by industry and services on the supply \nside and by public investments on the demand side. The GDP growth is projected at 5.5% in \n2019 and 6% in 2020. Given Uzbekistan\u2019s historically conservative fiscal policy, its risk of debt \nstress has remained low despite the devaluation of the currency. The external debt stood at \n34.5% of GDP in 2018, and public debt at 20.6% of GDP, and the foreign exchange reserves \nhave provided a healthy buffer against external economic shocks.7 The government launched \ncomprehensive tax reform  in 2018;8 started consolidating and reporting on- and off-budget \ntransactions in 2019; and launched a debut eurobond in February 2019. \n \n6.  Notwithstanding these positive steps, several long-standing developmental constraints \nhave required a more comprehensive PFM and governance reform approach to transform \nUzbekistan\u2019s economy into an open and diversified structure and improve  its resilience to \nmacroeconomic shocks. These constraints are summarized in paras. 7\u201310. \n \n7.  Inefficient macroeconomic and fiscal management. Based on public expenditure and \nfinancial accountability (PEFA) assessment of macroeconomic and PFM systems,9 Uzbekistan\u2019s \nstanding has been weak with respect to (i) oversight and management of fiscal risks from public \nsector entities; (ii) effectiveness of internal and external audit; (iii) quality and timeliness of \nannual  financial  statements;  (iv)  medium-term  fiscal  framework  to  ensure  a  multiyear \nperspective in fiscal policy, planning, and budgeting; and (v) competition, value for money, and \ncontrols in procurement. The data collection, analysis, and dissemination systems also need \nmodernizing to enable informed decision-making in macroeconomic planning and management. \n \n8.  Large  public  sector  involvement  in  the  economy.  SOEs  dominate  important \nsegments of the economy, leaving little space for the private sector.10 Inefficient SOEs dealing \n                                                \n6  The foreign exchange liberalization adversely affected the financial performance of SOEs and led to utility tariff \nadjustments. As per the Cabinet of Ministers resolution on 14 November 2017, the electricity tariff increased by \n12% and the gas tariff by 10% from 1 April 2018. Tariff increases for electricity and natural gas have averaged 18% \nin 2019. Further adjustments are expected during 2020\u20132021. Considering that spending on transport accounts for \n8% of the average household\u2019s expenditures, and communication services for 6%, the burden has been mainly \npassed onto over 6.4 million households as consumers of SOEs\u2019 services. \n7  The latest debt sustainability analysis of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) conducted after the devaluation \nsuggests that most significant risks could result from significantly lower remittances and exports. IMF. 2019. \nRepublic of Uzbekistan: Article IV Consultation Press Release and Staff Report. IMF Country Report No.19/129. \nWashington, D.C. \n8  With support from the IMF, the government\u2019s tax reforms covered (i) improvement in tax administration, (ii) \nenlargement of the tax base, (iii) simplification of the tax rules, and (iv) transparency for tax incentives to ensure \nequal treatment for state-owned and private businesses. \n9  Sector Assessment (Summary): Multisector (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n10 These segments include energy; metallurgy; mining; telecommunication; agriculture; machinery (e.g., automotive \nindustry); and transport (airlines, railways, and municipal public transport). In 2016, there were 2,413 public sector \nentities of which (i) 294 were general government entities, including the social security fund and local governments; \n(ii) 2,107 were nonfinancial public corporations; and (iii) 12 were financial public corporations. Of net public sector \n ", "3 \nwith utilities adversely impact the delivery and quality of public goods and services. Many SOEs \nresemble sector ministries, combining regulatory, operational, and social protection functions. \nMajor SOEs run into conflicts of interest when fulfilling their sectoral supervisory and regulatory \nroles while operating as commercial enterprises. Governance standards tend to be opaque, and \nsupervisory  boards  are  often  chaired  by  a  government  official.11 SOEs  are  still  subject  to \ndomestic accounting standards and rules, which are not fully comparable with the International \nFinancial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The consolidated reporting on the financial performance \nof SOEs, guarantees, and off-budget liabilities is inadequate. \n \n9.  Inefficient banking intermediation and supervision. Uzbekistan\u2019s finance sector is \ndominated by heavily regulated state-owned and/or controlled banks.12 Government policies \nhave created a dual credit market whereby commercial credit is provided to the private sector \n(corporations and households) in local currency while preferential credit is allocated to SOEs \nand priority sectors in foreign currency. The state-owned and/or controlled banks have strong \ninfluence over systemic loan growth through their participation in state-run lending programs.13  \nConsequently, they do not play the role of effective financial intermediation, which constrains \nthe access of citizens or private companies to credit and other banking services. The banking \nsupervision, including capital and liquidity assessments has been regular and the reported bank \nsoundness indicators have remained reassuring. However, the bank soundness indicators may \nunderestimate  the  risks  and  thus  there  is  a  need  for  strengthening  risk-based  banking \nsupervision. The scope for macroprudential policies has also been limited in the largely state-\nowned banking system. \n \n10.  Constraints to  private  sector  development.  With the state\u2019s dominant role in the \neconomy through SOEs, expansion of the private sector has been traditionally constrained \nbecause of monopolistic practices and various tax, customs, and licensing privileges granted to \nSOEs. Consequently, public investment is crowding out private investment. The contribution of \nthe private sector to growth has been modest in Uzbekistan because of ineffective financial \nintermediation and the high cost of funds for private investment.14 The absence of a robust \npublic\u2013private partnership (PPP) framework in the past has prevented the government from \nleveraging  private  investments  to  modernize,  expand,  and  improve  aging  or  inadequate \ninfrastructure. There is a need for comprehensive improvements in the enabling environment \nsuch as (i) rule of law, transparency, and other governance-related factors; (ii) competition \npolicy; (iii) efficient allocation of capital; (iv) improving skills of the workforce; and (v) productivity \nand efficiency gains from price liberalization across the economy and other structural reforms to \ncreate opportunities for the private sector.15 \n                                                                                                                                                       \nexpenditures,  nonfinancial  public  corporations  accounted  for  16%  and  financial  public  sector  corporations \naccounted for 6%. IMF. 2019. Republic of Uzbekistan: Fiscal Transparency Evaluation. IMF Country Report. No. \n19/117. Washington, D.C. \n11 Key  deficiencies  in  the  governance  structure  of  SOEs  include  (i)  weak  control  of  payroll  and  non-payroll \nexpenditures; (ii) poor quality and timeliness in preparing financial statements and audits; (iii) poor legislative \nscrutiny and lack of follow-up of external audits; and (iv) nontransparency. \n12 These banks account for the banking sector\u2019s 86% of assets, 81% of capital and 89% of loans in 2019. \n13 In 2018, the domestic credit-to-GDP ratio was 51%. Of the SUM165 trillion credit stock, 58% was preferential credit \nat the average interest rate of 8%, while 42% was commercial credit at 22% interest rate. The preferential credit \ngrowth  was  43%  and  commercial  credit  growth  was  61%.  IMF.  2019.  Republic  of  Uzbekistan:  Article  IV \nConsultation Press Release and Staff Report.

Progress was noted in (i) simplifying procedures for starting a \n ", "4 \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n11.  In  recognition  of  these  structural  development  constraints,  in  February  2017,  after \nUzbekistan\u2019s first change in leadership since independence in 1991, the government adopted \nthe  national  development  strategy,  2017\u20132021,  articulating  the  government\u2019s  vision  for \ndeveloping the private sector and improving public sector management, the banking sector, and \nthe  financial  performance  of  SOEs. 16 The  government  is  committed  to  (i)  increasing \ntransparency  of  the  budget  process  and  transitioning  gradually  to  program  budgeting  to \nincrease the effectiveness of expenditures; (ii) ending unproductive transfers and subsidies to \nSOEs from the budget and converting loss-making SOEs into competitive profit-making entities; \nand (iii) using market mechanisms to distribute resources and manage government assets. This \nis planned to be achieved through restructuring and, for smaller SOEs, outright privatization. \nThe  government  intends  to  gradually  move  to  the  International  Public  Sector  Accounting \nStandards  (IPSAS)  across  all  agencies.  Further,  the  government  has  initiated  reforms  to \nimprove the banking sector\u2019s performance, regulation and risk-based supervision. \n \n12.  Achievements under subprogram 1. ADB helped the government identify the priority \nreforms, addressing the key development constraints in line with its strategic agenda, and \nimplement them under a programmatic approach over two subprograms. 17 Under subprogram 1, \nmodernization  of  data  collection,  analysis,  and  dissemination  by  the  State  Committee  on \nStatistics (SCS), based on the enhanced general data dissemination system (e-GDDS) of the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), has begun. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) set the direction \nof PFM reforms by publishing the 2012 PEFA assessment with information on the progress \nachieved during 2012\u20132017 on its website. To improve budget preparation, the MOF issued an \norder to adopt and use 12 budget accounting standards in line with the IPSAS.18 To enhance \ninternal controls, the MOF approved the internal audit guidelines and internal audit activities \nwere piloted in the Ministry of Public Education (MOPE) and the Ministry of Health (MOH). To \nimprove banking supervision, the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) prepared capital adequacy \nassessment for 10 selected state-owned banks and conducted stress testing.19 The corporate \ngovernance rules (CGRs) based on the 2015 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment Corporate Governance Guidelines for SOEs were adopted in seven SOEs. A \nsustainable  debt  management  strategy  of  Joint  Stock  Company  (JSC)  Uzbekenergo  was \napproved. The PPP law was approved in 2019 to expand private sector participation in public \nsector infrastructure projects.20 The government approved a list of non-core assets of JSC \nUzbekenergo, Uzkimyosanoat and Uzbekneftegaz to improve the financial performance of these \ncritical SOEs. For transparency in financial management, the decision to prepare and disclose \nIFRS-compliant audited financial statements was approved by the supervisory board of JSC \nUzbekenergo. All policy actions for subprogram 1, which continue to be in effect, have allowed \nthe  government  to  (i)  initiate  key  sector  reforms  that  allow  greater  and  better  access  to \nmacroeconomic data, (ii) switch focus to improving efficiency of banking sector supervision and \nmanagement  of  state-owned  banks,  (iii)  streamline  PFM  systems,  (iv)  initiate  corporate \ngovernance reforms for SOEs, and (v) support power sector reform initiatives. \n                                                                                                                                                       \nbusiness, (ii) tax payments, (iii) protecting minority investors, and (iv) enforcing contracts.

The law was approved by the \nParliament and signed by the President on 10 May 2019 and entered into force on 12 June 2019. \n ", "5 \n13.  Proposed subprogram 2. The proposed subprogram 2 supports the government to \nsequentially continue and deepen the reforms initiated under subprogram 1. The policy actions \nunder subprogram 2 cover the following three reform areas: \n(i)  Macroeconomic  data  collection,  analysis,  and  dissemination  systems \nimproved. The requirements for IMF\u2019s e-GDDS were fully complied with and the \ngovernment joined the e-GDDS on 4 May 2018. The government also submitted an \naction  plan  to  update  e-GDDS  indicators,  methodology,  and  frequency  of  data \npublication to comply with the requirements of the IMF\u2019s special data dissemination \nstandard  (SDDS).21 The  CBU\u2019s  data  coverage  and  dissemination  systems  were \nstrengthened  with  the  update  of  the  data  release  calendar  of  monetary,  fiscal, \nfinancial, and macroeconomic indicators; and publication of the calendar on the \nCBU\u2019s website for public access starting in 2019. \n(ii) Fiscal and financial management strengthened. The methodology for medium-\nterm budget preparation was strengthened with the MOF\u2019s approval of the medium-\nterm budget framework (MTBF) manual, which includes tools for gender-responsive \nbudgeting. The government also adopted the MTBF for budget making beginning \n2020. The MOF completed the 2018 PEFA performance assessment report and \napproved measures to address the priority PFM areas based on the 2018 PEFA \nreport.22 The MOF also approved measures to achieve full  compliance with the \naccrual-based IPSAS. The internal audit units in the MOPE and the MOH were \nstaffed and operationalized as well as those in three additional ministries and/or \nagencies.23 To strengthen competitiveness, efficiency, and transparency of the public \nprocurement system, a road map for public procurement reform was approved in \nFebruary  2019  and  the  draft  public  procurement  law  was  published  on  the \ngovernment\u2019s website for public consultation, which is expected to be submitted to \nthe Parliament by the end of 2019. Based on the capital adequacy assessment and \nstress testing, the CBU implemented actions to address the identified shortfalls in \nloan loss provisioning, capital, and liquidity for 10 selected state-owned banks.24 The \nCBU also introduced risk-based banking supervision to enhance oversight of the \nbanking sector; the manual for implementation of risk-based bank supervision was \napproved and became effective in August 2019. To improve access to bank loans by \nthe  private  sector  and  to  reduce  directed  lending  in  a  phased  manner,  the \ngovernment approved a policy to augment market-based lending covering all state-\nowned banks.25 \n                                                \n21 The government has been disseminating data on 422 indicators in 24 categories as required by e-GDDS and \nadvance data release calendar, using standardized electronic reporting procedures. The SDDS transition will be \ncompleted by 2021 as per the road map approved in April 2019. \n22 The MOF\u2019s Fiscal Transparency Action Plan (2018\u20132021) was published in IMF. 2019.

Washington, D.C. \n23 Internal audit units were established in (i) the Ministry of Higher and Secondary Specialized Education; (ii) the \nPension Fund at MOF; and (iii) the Ministry of Preschool Education. \n24 The stress tests show that banks\u2019 capital adequacy ratios are currently in line with the regulatory requirements, \nexcept for one bank where capital injection is needed. The CBU has provided instructions to commercial banks to \n(i) make adjustments to reduce their nonperforming loans; (ii) slow down loan issuance; (iii) bring the capital \nadequacy ratio to 14% by 1 September 2020, and further keep it at that level; (iv) increase the share of highly liquid \nassets to 10% by a quarterly increase of at least 1%; and (v) increase the ratio of highly liquid assets to short-term \nliabilities up to 40%, through a quarterly increase of the indicator by at least 5%. \n25 In December 2018, a resolution was adopted for the state-owned banks to (i) strengthen risk management, (ii) \ndiversify their lending portfolio, and (iii) establish lending conditions based on (a) market principles, (b) technical \nand  economic  assessment  of  projects,  and  (c)  borrowers\u2019  creditworthiness.  These  measures  will  support \ncommercial lending to the private sector, including small and medium-sized enterprises, and offer great potential to \nsynergize with ADB\u2019s proposed Mortgage Market Sector Development Program in 2019, which aims to address key \ndistortions in residential mortgage market such as (i) inefficient housing subsidies, (ii) limited mortgage-related \n ", "6 \n(iii) State-owned enterprise governance and private sector operations improved. \nThe CGRs in selected SOEs were implemented and a timetable for implementation \nof CGRs in all other SOEs was approved.26 The government\u2019s shares in 34 out of 38 \nSOEs, identified in Presidential Decree No. 4112, were transferred to the State Asset \nManagement Agency (SAMA),27 and a special fund was created in May 2019 to \nfacilitate restructuring, divestment, and privatization of these SOEs.28 Revaluing JSC \nUzbekenergo\u2019s  fixed  assets  (generation,  transmission,  and  distribution)  was \ncompleted  to  determine  the  true  and  fair  value  of  the  company\u2019s  assets  in \ncompliance with the international financial reporting and valuation standards.29 To \npromote private sector activities, two financially viable PPP projects were taken to \nthe bidding stage.30 From the approved list of non-core assets of JSC Uzbekenergo, \nUzkimyosanoat and Uzbekneftegaz, the government sold 90 out of 186 non-core \nassets that were identified for divestment and transferred 112 out of 118 non-core \nassets that were identified for transfer to local authorities. To ensure cost recovery of \nrelated investments, a new tariff methodology for provision of electricity was adopted \nin April 2019. Finally, an independent auditor was contracted to carry out IFRS-\ncompliant consolidated audited financial statements of JSC Uzbekenergo for 2017, \n2018, and the first half of 2019 (up to the unbundling of the company on 27 March \n2019). The three successor companies of JSC Uzbekenergo31 also took the decision \nto annually prepare and disclose IFRS-compliant audited financial statements in line \nwith  the  decision  of  the  Power  Sector  Reform  Commission  of  the  Cabinet  of \nMinisters and the order of the SAMA as the sole shareholder of these companies. \n \n14.  Adjustments in subprogram 2 policy actions. Under subprogram 2, inclusion of new \npolicy  actions  and  adjustments  to  initial  policy  actions  as  summarized  in  paras.  15\u201317 (i) \nstrengthened the program\u2019s relevance to Uzbekistan\u2019s dynamic macroeconomic context and \npolicy environment, (ii) reflected the positive changes in the government\u2019s priorities and its \ncommitment to adopt more advanced PFM reforms in line with the latest gap assessments and \ninternational best practices, and (iii) strengthened institutional and technical implementation \n                                                                                                                                                       \nfinancial products, (iii) inadequate regulations on lending quality, and (iv) limited access to long-term funding by \nbanks because of underdeveloped capital markets. \n26 Based on the assessment, selected SOEs are compliant with 66% of the selected 36 key CGRs in the areas of (i) \nrelated party transactions; (ii) internal control policy and audit; (iii) prevention of conflicts of interest and responsible \nbusiness conduct; (iv) disclosure of quarterly and annual reports; and (v) organizational roles and responsibilities of \nthe  shareholders  and  the  supervisory  board  and/or  executive  body,  clearly  laid  out  in  the  SOE  charter. \nImplementation and capacity building support is most required for CGRs related to (i) composition of independent \nsupervisory boards; (ii) competitive selection of executives; (iii) IFRS-compliant financial reporting; (iv) adoption of \ninternational auditing standards; and (v) creation of a risk management framework, where compliance is partial or \nnon-substantial. The implementation of CGRs in the 50 largest SOEs will begin in 2019, followed by other JSCs in \n2020, limited liability companies in 2021\u20132022, and state unitary enterprises in 2023\u20132025. \n27 The Presidential Decree No. 4112 legally transferred the government\u2019s shares in 38 SOEs to SAMA on 14 January \n2019. The net asset value of 38 SOEs was SUM18,377 billion in 2018 (about $2 billion based on the exchange rate \nof $1/SUM8,705 as of 9 August 2019). During 2019, the transfer of 34 SOEs to SAMA was completed. The \nadministrative process for two SOEs is ongoing. The remaining two SOEs have been transferred to other agencies \nfor privatization and/or restructuring. \n28 The government established the SAMA in January 2019 to improve SOEs\u2019 performance, transparency, and \ncorporate governance, and to promote privatization. \n29 These  assets  are  now  being  transferred  to  three  successor  companies  following  the  unbundling  of  JSC \nUzbekenergo under the government\u2019s comprehensive power sector reforms. \n30 Two PPP projects selected under subprogram 2 are (i) a 100-megawatt solar photovoltaic power station in Navoi \nregion ($100 million) and (ii) hemodialysis centers in different regions ($9.8 million). The International Finance \nCorporation provided support for these PPP transactions. \n31 JSC Thermal Power Plants (generation), JSC National Electric Networks of Uzbekistan (transmission), and JSC \nRegional Electric Networks (distribution). \n ", "7 \ncapacity across the implementing agencies. \n \n15.  Policy action 1 was strengthened to reflect the government\u2019s compliance with the IMF\u2019s \ne-GDDS requirements. Policy action 2 was reformulated to reflect the policy commitment by \nmultiple agencies to modernizing statistical systems in line with the SDDS during 2019\u20132020. \nPolicy action 3 was also strengthened to reflect the CBU\u2019s update of the data release calendar \nand its public dissemination. Under policy action 4, while the government indicated that it would \nuse MTBF for budget making starting in 2020,32 the MOF will reach technical readiness to fully \nimplement the MTBF along with program budgeting in 2021 once templates and standardized \ndata for expenditures in administrative departments are completed with technical assistance \n(TA) support from the IMF and ADB. Thus, the approval of MTBF was reformulated as approval \nof the MTBF manual to strengthen the MOF\u2019s operational and technical capacity for the budget \npreparation process in line with the sequential approach for introducing the MTBF based on the \nIMF\u2019s advice to the government. Policy action 5 was strengthened to reflect the completion of \nthe 2018 PEFA assessment and the timeline for addressing the priority PFM areas. Because of \nthe government\u2019s recent policy decision to expedite the full transition to IPSAS, approval of \nmeasures for full compliance with the accrual-based IPSAS was included under policy action 6 \ninstead of the original action to implement 12 budget accounting standards.33 The policy action \n7 was reformulated to reflect the progress already achieved with staffing and activities in audit \nunits of MOPE and MOH, which were initiated under subprogram 1 and operationalization of \naudit units in additional ministries and/or agencies. A new policy action on approval of a public \nprocurement road map and publishing of a draft public procurement law for public consultation \nwas introduced under policy action 8, reflecting the government\u2019s commitment to improving the \npublic procurement system. Under policy action 9, the context for the CBU\u2019s actions to address \nthe shortfalls in the banking sector was more clearly highlighted. Under policy action 10, the \napproval of risk-based banking supervision guidelines and the initiation of implementation was \nreformulated as the introduction of risk-based banking supervision with the approval of the risk-\nbased banking supervision manual. Unlike the guidelines, the manual strengthens the CBU\u2019s \noperational  ability  to  effectively  detect  and  manage  banking  sector  risks,  including  credit, \nliquidity, and compliance. Extensive training was provided to the CBU\u2019s inspection  staff to \ndevelop their technical capacity to practically implement the manual as early as the banking \ninspection process that started in October 2019 in consultation with ADB\u2019s TA support. Policy \naction 11 was reformulated to reflect the approved policy for augmenting market-based lending \ncovering all state-owned banks.34 \n \n16.  Under policy action 12, the timeline for the implementation of CGRs in all other SOEs \nwas more clearly defined and the SAMA was specified as the new implementing agency in \ncharge of managing state assets as a shareholder and setting up relevant policies. A new policy \naction on the transfer of the government shares in 34 out of 38 SOEs to the SAMA and the \ncreation of a special fund for restructuring, divestment, and privatization under the SAMA was \nincluded under policy action 13 to strengthen the focus of subprogram 2 on SOE reforms and to \n                                                \n32 The government presented 3-year fiscal projections for the first time in the 2019 budget. The 2020 budget \nintroduces elements of MTBF with a 3-year horizon on key macroeconomic targets and aggregate budget items. \n33 The relevance of 12 budget accounting standards will be reevaluated based on their compliance with international \nnorms and the new road map for transitioning to the IPSAS accrual-based budget accounting standards. The road \nmap shows that standards on reporting of cash flows and consolidated financial statements will be completed by \n2020\u20132021 and provisions of contingent assets and liabilities will be completed by 2023 while advanced practices \nunder accrual-based budgeting will be completed by 2030 in a phased manner. \n34 Details on other measures are in Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nIn  August  2019,  the  government  indicated  that  directed  lending  programs  from  the  Uzbekistan  Fund  for \nReconstruction and Development will be concentrated in a few state-owned banks and the remaining will be \nprivatized. Preliminary calculations show that this will enable three large banks to increase lending by $5.7 billion. \n ", "8 \nprovide  capacity-building  support  to  the  SAMA  under  ADB\u2019s  TA.  Policy  action  15  was \nstrengthened by (i) indicating the specific number of selected PPP projects; (ii) designating the \nPublic\u2013Private Partnership Development Agency (PPPDA), which was established in October \n2018, as the new implementing agency for selecting the PPP projects; and (iii) demonstrating \nthe government\u2019s broader commitment to 86 PPP projects open for international investment as \napproved under the presidential decree in April 2019. The status report on the completion of the \ndivestment process (per the original indicative policy action) would not be entirely feasible within \none year of subprogram 2 implementation given that (i) divestment of the selected non-core \nassets of SOEs is not a one-time terminal activity, (ii) income generation from the process \nrequires having favorable market conditions and existence of private sector demand, and (iii) \nthe final transfer of ownership of non-core assets could involve resolving complex legal and \nprocedural requirements. Therefore, policy action 16 was reformulated to reflect the ongoing \nprocess and the government\u2019s commitment to streamline SOE operations. \n \n17.  The unbundling of JSC Uzbekenergo through presidential resolution on 27 March 2019 \nrequired reformulation of three policy actions: 14, 17, and 18.35 Revaluing the fixed assets of \nthree  successor  companies  (generation,  distribution,  and  transmission),  instead  of  JSC \nUzbekenergo as a single entity, was completed by an independent audit firm for the newly \nestablished  Ministry  of Energy  under  policy  action  14. The  master  plan for financing  JSC \nUzbekenergo\u2019s  investment  during  2018\u20132022  was  replaced  with  the  adoption  of  a  new \nelectricity tariff methodology for policy action 17. This came about because of the government\u2019s \ndecision to develop a more comprehensive power sector master plan for a longer time horizon \nof 10 years, for which it is currently considering policy and technical recommendations from \ndevelopment partners, including ADB. The new tariff methodology  enables full recovery of \noperational and capital costs and ensures the necessary net profit for the power sector to be \nfinancially sustainable. This will help reduce the subsidy requirement and attract new investment \ninto the sector. Given the ongoing corporate restructuring of the three successor companies, the \npreparation  of  JSC  Uzbekenergo\u2019s  2017  IFRS-compliant  consolidated  audited  financial \nstatements  was  delayed.  The  adjusted  policy  action  18  reflects  a  more  forward-looking \napproach and expands the original action by including financial statements for the last 3 years \nof JSC Uzbekenergo and extending independent audit and reporting requirements to the three \nsuccessor companies.36 \n \n18.  Supporting technical assistance. The program\u2019s attached TA has been supporting \nsubprograms 1 and 2, focusing on (i) training of SCS staff; (ii) capacity building of the MOF on \nMTBF preparation; (iii) preparation of the MTBF manual and gender-sensitivity assessment of \npublic expenditures; (iv) capacity building of the CBU in risk-based banking supervision, capital \nadequacy  assessments,  and  stress  testing;  (v)  development  of  the  risk-based  banking \nsupervision manual; (vi) strengthening of the internal audit units within selected ministries and/or \nagencies, including introduction of a risk-based audit manual; (vii) capacity building of  the \nPPPDA, including drafting of model concession agreements and operational guidelines, and \nestablishment of a PPP development facility; (viii) strengthening of the CGRs in selected SOEs \nand  capacity  building  of  the  SAMA  and  directors  of  SOEs;  and  (ix)  revaluation  of  JSC \nUzbekenergo\u2019s fixed assets for generation, transmission, and distribution. Resources will be \nadded to the existing TA to extend the implementation until the end of 2022 to strengthen the \n                                                \n35 Further details on energy sector reforms are in Sector Assessment (Summary): Multisector (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n36 The audit of IFRS-compliant consolidated audited financial statements of JSC Uzbekenergo for 2017, 2018, and \nthe first half of 2019 is expected to be completed in 2020.

The expanded TA will \nalso serve as a post-program review framework for ADB to assess the need for future reforms. \nTo ensure sustainability, the TA will provide implementation support in (i) gender-responsive \nMTBF and performance-based program budgeting by the MOF; (ii) accrual-based IPSAS based \non the MOF\u2019s approved road map; 37 (iii) extension of the risk-based internal audit framework to \nother ministries and/or agencies; (iv) IFRS-compliant financial statements by SOEs; (v) the \nupgrading of national accounting standards by the MOF; (vi) the strengthening of the SCS\u2019s \nstatistical data systems including more regular updates of sex-disaggregated data; (vii) the \nCBU\u2019s risk-based banking supervision and (viii) the SOE reforms. 38 \n \n19.  ADB\u2019s  value  addition.  The  reforms  under  the  two  subprograms  have  provided \nsignificant value addition and complementarity to the government\u2019s agenda. ADB has been \neffectively engaging in policy dialogue with the government to bring in experience and lessons \nfrom similar PFM projects and policy-based programs in the Central and West Asia region.39 A \nkey lesson is that the programmatic approach has proven to be an appropriate modality for \nlogically sequencing structural reforms under a multiyear engagement framework and making \nnecessary  and  realistic  adjustments  in  response  to  dynamic  changes  in  the  policy  and \nmacroeconomic environment in Uzbekistan.40 Strong government commitment to realistic policy \nactions and complementarity of support from development partners were found to be important \nprerequisites  for  successful  implementation.  The  program\u2019s  attached  TA  facilitated  the \nimplementation of international best practices by tailoring them to Uzbekistan\u2019s unique needs \nand provided operational support and capacity building to implement complex reforms. The \nprogram created strong synergies with ADB\u2019s energy sector support. The program has been \neffective in development partner coordination to provide a unified reform package. \n \n20.  Coordination among development partners. ADB, the IMF, the World Bank, Agence \nFran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD), and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) \nare the leading development partners in the area of PFM reforms in Uzbekistan.41 Based on the \ngovernment\u2019s formally laid-out donor coordination mechanism, close dialogue with development \npartners and IMF missions have been held through ADB\u2019s Uzbekistan Resident Mission.  \n \n21.  During 2018\u20132019, the IMF provided advisory TA support to the SCS for transitioning to \ne-GDDS and SDDS; to the MOF for fiscal transparency, PFM reform strategy, tax policy and \nadministration, and implementation of the MTBF, and to CBU for improving monetary operations \nand policy, central bank legal reform, and statistics.  \n \n22.  ADB and the World Bank have jointly delineated complementary reforms.

While  the  World  Bank\u2019s  2018  DPO  and  ADB\u2019s  subprogram  1 \nadministered their own policy matrices, they coordinated closely to identify complementary \nreforms. The World Bank supported the introduction of IFRS and stress testing of the banking \nsector, which synergized with ADB\u2019s reforms in these areas and support to the CBU for risk-\nbased  banking  supervision  under  subprogram  1.  The  2019  DPO  focuses  on  (i)  citizen \nparticipation in local budgetary processes; (ii) private sector promotion and liberalization of \nstate-dominated sectors; and (iii) strengthening legal and regulatory frameworks for greater \ninvestment in the energy and financial sectors. These activities closely complement the reforms \nrelated to public sector budget systems, SOEs, and JSC Uzbekenergo under subprogram 2.42 In \nMay 2019, the World Bank approved $33 million for the Institutional Capacity Building Project \nfor  (i)  improvements  in  public  sector  accounting,  audit,  and  treasury  management;  (ii) \ndevelopment of a legal and regulatory framework for SOE restructuring and a database for SOE \nassets; (iii) support to the regulatory agencies; and (iv) support for implementation of PPPs. \n \n23.  In 2018, AFD provided \u20ac150 million in collaborative cofinancing with \u20ac1 million TA under \nsubprogram  1.  AFD  supported  the  MOF  for  strengthening  budget  systems  and  public \nprocurement, and SAMA for improving SOE supervision and corporate governance. AFD also \napproved \u20ac50 million of collaborative cofinancing for subprogram 2. 43  The UNDP provided TA \nsupport to  MOF for (i)  the  2019  Citizens\u2019  Budget; (ii)  introduction  of  medium-term  budget \nplanning; (iii) establishment of internal control and audit systems; (iv) reforms of the public \naccounting system; and (v) enhancing the capacities of the Pension Fund. The UNDP plans to \nstrengthen the MOF\u2019s capacity in program-based budgeting, environmentally sensitive (green) \nbudgeting, and gender budgeting. \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n24.  Subprogram 2 will help facilitate macroeconomic stability and sustainable high growth.44 \nReforms in PFM will help improve the environment conducive to private investment over the \nmedium term. These reforms will be made through (i) preparing the annual budget using MTBF, \nwhich  improves  the  distributive  efficiency  of  scarce  public  resources  and  better  aligns \nexpenditures with developmental targets; (ii) improving internal controls and audit systems; (iii) \nreducing fiscal transfers to large SOEs; and (iv) ceasing systemic leakages, i.e., from public \n                                                \n42 The World Bank\u2019s 2019 DPO is also supporting reforms in social inclusion and safety nets. In addition, the World \nBank approved $50 million loan in 2019 for a project to strengthen social inclusion, social protection, and \nemployment generation for labor affected by SOE reforms. The project provided support to the Ministry of \nEmployment and Labor Relations for strengthening public employment services in Uzbekistan. This complements \nADB\u2019s proposed technical and vocational education and training project to strengthen education and competence \nin science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; upgrade the curriculum to ensure industry\u2013education links; \nand improve labor skills. \n43 While  AFD\u2019s  cofinancing  was  not  administered  by  ADB,  ADB  and  AFD  closely  cooperated  to  develop \ncomplementary  policy  actions  and  TA  activities.  The  implementation  has  been  monitored  through  regular \ncommunication among cofinancing partners under subprogram 1. The same approach has been followed under \nsubprogram 2.  \n44 Under the effect of the reform in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1 (environment conducive to \nprivate investment improved), the first performance indicator (local currency bank credit to private sector) was \nreplaced with a new indicator on loans extended to small businesses. In line with the government\u2019s efforts to \npromote small and medium-sized enterprises, compared to the earlier indicator, this indicator is a more direct \nmeasure of the improvements in access to finance by small businesses that are essential for job creation and \ninclusive growth. The second performance indicator (the ratio of operating revenue to the operating cost of JSC \nUzbekenergo) was replaced with a new indicator on policy lending because JSC Uzbekenergo no longer exists \nafter  its  unbundling  on  27  March  2019.  Both  indicators  are  directly  related  to  improvements  in  financial \nintermediation to private sector and reduction in directed lending, which are critical for improving the environment \nconductive to private investment. \n ", "11 \nprocurement. Full compliance with the accrual-based IPSAS for budget and IFRS for SOEs will \nincrease the reliability and quality of public sector accounting and financial reporting. A more \nstable banking sector and its enhanced ability to finance private sector investments will result \nfrom improved risk-based banking supervision, reduced directed lending to SOEs, and more \nmarket-based financial intermediation. An enabling policy, legal, and institutional environment \nfor PPPs will promote private sector investment. Subprogram 2 will contribute to improving the \nefficiency, governance, operational and financial viability of SOEs by promoting (i) international \nCGRs, (ii) divestment of selected non-core assets, and (iii) restructuring of key power sector \nSOEs. These reforms will support the national development strategies, aiming toward a vibrant \nmarket economy driven by private entrepreneurship. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n25.  The development financing need of the Government of Uzbekistan amounts to $1.7 \nbillion (14% of the budget expenditure in 2019), driven by higher wages and expenditures on \nsocial programs to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on low-income households resulting \nfrom  depreciation  of  the  local  currency,  price  liberalization,  and  SOE  reforms.45 Despite \nimprovements in tax revenues, the state\u2019s budget expenditures have increased from 2018 to \n2019.46 In 2019, the augmented budget deficit is projected at SUM7.8 trillion ($0.9 billion or \n1.6% of GDP), of which SUM3.5 trillion ($0.4 billion) will be covered through external borrowings \nfrom development partners, including ADB.47 Without the development partners\u2019 support,  it \nwould be difficult for Uzbekistan to cover the development financing need on its own without \njeopardizing  essential  investments.  The  development  policy  letter  received  from  the \nGovernment of Uzbekistan is in Appendix 3.  \n \n26.  The government has requested a regular loan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance subprogram 2. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a \ngrace period of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan agreement. Based on the straight-line \nmethod, the average loan maturity is 9.25 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to \nADB. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n27.  The MOF is the executing agency. The implementing agencies are the CBU, Ministry of \nEnergy, MOF, SAMA, SCS, and PPPDA. The MOF supervises and coordinates the program \namong the implementing agencies. The proceeds of the policy-based loan will be withdrawn in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \nThe implementation period for subprogram 2 is 26 June 2018\u201331 December 2019. \n \n                                                \n45 Reform-related budget expenditures comprise (i) wage and utility tariff adjustments; (ii) allowances, financial \nassistance, and benefits; (iii) support for job creation for youth and women; and (iv) a subsidy to the Pension Fund. \nDetails are in Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n46 Budget revenues have risen by 65% in nominal terms in 2019 compared with 2018 because of economic growth. \nThe indirect taxes (from value-added tax) have grown by 141% (46% of revenues) and direct taxes from \ncorporations, businesses, and individuals have grown by 227% (29% of revenues) following the tax reforms. \nHowever, budget expenditures have increased by 72% with higher social spending.

The  relevant  government  agencies  have  received  TA  support  from  ADB  and \ndevelopment partners to implement reform areas of subprogram 2 with technical components. \n \nB.  Economic \n \n29.  Subprogram 2 was subject to economic analysis, the results of which demonstrate \npositive benefits. PFM reforms will help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public sector \ninvestment. The CGRs will contribute to enhanced performance and financial viability of SOEs, \nreducing  fiscal  transfers  over  the  medium  term.  Improved  economic  management  and \nmacroeconomic stability will have a crowding-in impact on the private sector.48 \n \nC.  Governance \n \n30.  A governance risk assessment was conducted in line with ADB\u2019s Second Governance \nand Anticorruption Action Plan. 49 No major governance risks were identified except for weak \nimplementation capacity and retention of trained staff in relevant departments. The government \nis  committed  to  reforms  and,  in  2017,  launched  an  anticorruption  campaign  that  includes \nlegislative, regulatory, and institutional initiatives.50 No major risks of resource mismanagement \ncan be discerned at the relevant departments, and PFM related to budget credibility, debt \nmanagement, and treasury functions is generally reliable. Identified weaknesses in (i) internal \naudit; (ii) planning of capital and current expenditures; (iii) corporate governance of SOEs; and \n(iv)  IPSAS  were  targeted  under  the  attached  TA.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the MOF. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n31.  The poverty reduction and social impacts of subprogram 2 are positive. The reforms \nunder subprogram 2 will enhance (i) the allocative efficiency of public sector expenditures; (ii) \nfinancial  intermediation  by  the  banking  sector;  (iii)  the  SOEs\u2019  governance  to  enable  more \neffective and inclusive delivery of public goods and services; and (iv) the enabling environment \nfor the private sector.51 These outcomes have an indirect impact on poverty reduction. Creation \nof fiscal headroom through better fiscal management will enable higher public investment and \nbudget allocations for the poor and vulnerable groups; and improved access to finance by the \nprivate sector will contribute to business growth and job creation. Subprogram 2 has some \ngender elements given that the MOF has adopted a gender-responsive MTBF manual and the \nMOF\u2019s capacity to implement gender-responsive budgeting and gender-sensitivity assessment \nof public expenditures was strengthened under the TA. The SCS will more regularly collect and \nupdate sex-disaggregated statistical data.

Washington, D.C. \n51 As the main objective is to improve the PFM systems and operational and financial viability of SOEs by \nstrengthening the CGRs, SOE reforms under subprogram 2 will not lead to any labor retrenchment. However, the \ndialogue with the government and related agencies such as the SAMA will continue to strengthen the systems for \nsocial inclusion, protection, and employment generation for labor during the SOE reforms. As needed, there will be \ncoordination with social programs and projects of ADB and other development partners (footnote 42). \n ", "13 \nsector promotion will indirectly contribute to gender empowerment. 52 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n32.  Following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement (2009),  subprogram  2  is  classified  as \ncategory C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. Program \nactivities will be confined to policy and institutional reforms. No activity will result in or lead to \ninvoluntary resettlement, or negatively affect indigenous peoples or the environment. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n33.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in the table and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.53 Given that subprogram 2 policy actions \nhave been achieved already, the overall risk of subprogram 2 is moderate. \n \nSummary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nImplementation capacity of agencies is weak  Support the development of an adequate number of staff by \nand trained staff are not retained in relevant  equipping them with technical skills on a sustained basis with \ndepartments during the program, affecting the  support of TAs in collaboration with other multilateral \nsuccessful completion of policy actions  development partners \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n34.  The government and the MOF have assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 2 \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the loan agreement. \n \nV.
