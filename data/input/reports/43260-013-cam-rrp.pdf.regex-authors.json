I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \npolicy-based loan, and (ii) a proposed loan to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Third Education \nSector Development Program.1 \n \n2.  The  Government  of  Cambodia  is  highly  committed  to  accelerating  progress  toward \nachieving quality basic education and realizing the goals of the Education for All National Plan, \n2003\u20132015.2 The Education Strategic Plan, 2009\u20132013 guides all education development in \nCambodia. 3 The  program  involves  a  program-based  approach  in  coordination  with  other \ndevelopment  partners  to  meet  the  objectives  of  the  Education  Strategic  Plan.  It  supports \nstrengthening of the basic education system (grades 1\u20139), in particular the lower secondary \nsubsector (grades 7\u20139), through (i) expanded access to lower secondary education, (ii) improved \nquality of lower secondary education, and (iii) improved subsector management. It builds on \nprevious support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), including the Second Education Sector \nDevelopment Program 4 and the Enhancing Education Quality Project.5 The scope is nationwide and \nproject interventions will be focused in the Tonle Sap region and border provinces.6  \n  \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Cambodia\u2019s annual gross domestic product grew by an average of 4.7% over FY2007\u2013\nFY2010, and is projected to grow by an average of 6.6% over FY2011\u2013FY2014. To sustain \neconomic growth and achieve national goals, Cambodia needs to become globally and regionally \ncompetitive. However, educational attainment is still low, particularly in remote areas; thereby \npreventing youth from pursuing further education and training and entering the labor market.  \n \n4.  Cambodia has made significant progress in improving basic education, particularly for girls. \nPrimary net enrollment has risen to 96% for both boys and girls, which led to the lower secondary \nenrollment rate to double. The total gross enrollment ratio for lower secondary education is 58% \n(57% for girls). Gender parity in enrollments has been achieved. However, the lower secondary \nnet  enrollment  rate  is  35%,  below  the  government  target  of  44%.  Rural\u2013urban disparities  in \nenrollment exist. The education sector is facing several challenges in meeting Cambodia\u2019s Millennium \nDevelopment Goal of universal 9-year basic education, such as lack of access to lower secondary \nschools, high repetition at the primary level, and dropout at the lower secondary level.7 \n  \n5.  Students  are  unable  to  continue  to  lower  secondary  school  because  schools  are \novercrowded or remote. About 40% of students (36% of girls) enrolled at the lower secondary \nlevel are overage because they have repeated grades at the primary level.8 Students who repeat \ngrades at the primary level either delay lower secondary enrollment or do not enroll at all. \nOverage students are prone to dropping out of school. The average dropout rate from lower \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports (MOEYS). 2003.

Phnom Penh. \n8  Repetition at the primary level impacts lower secondary enrollment, though it has significantly decreased from 12% in \nSY2005\u20132006 to 7% in SY2009\u20132010. ", "2 \nsecondary school is 21.7%.9 Both boys and girls are prone to dropping out. Persistent shortfalls in \naccess, quality, and management need to be addressed to improve enrollment, reduce repetition \nand dropout rates, and achieve basic education goals. \n \n6.  Access. Access to lower secondary schools is a major issue because of physical distance \nin rural areas and overcrowding in urban areas. Out of 1,621 communes, 187 do not have lower \nsecondary schools. In some urban and rural areas, schools operate in double shifts and cannot \nabsorb more students. About 1,000 more classrooms and qualified teachers are needed in rural \nand urban areas. Where there are access constraints (often in combination with factors such as \npoor quality of instruction, informal school fees, and the need to support family income), parents \nmay decide to keep children at home or only allow high performers to complete basic education. \nGender-specific constraints prevent equitable access, particularly in remote areas.10 \n \n7.  Quality. The government has made major efforts to improve quality by providing capacity \ndevelopment for teachers in teaching and learning methodologies; modernizing curricula and \ntextbooks; and making textbooks available to 50% of students, following the policy to provide one \ntextbook per student per subject at the lower secondary level. Despite these efforts, the high \ndropout rate at lower secondary level is partly attributed to inadequately trained teachers, lack of \nteaching and learning resources, weak relevance to labor market demands, and lack of special \nassistance to at-risk and low-achieving students. Efficiency issues at lower secondary level now \nreceive high priority, given increasing pressure on the system to meet the demand for universal \nbasic education. \n \n8.  Management. The government has decentralized some functions to the subnational level to \nmake education service delivery more efficient. For example, school operating budgets have been \nprovided to all schools at all levels of education across the country.11 However, key disparities exist in \nthe governance and financing of lower secondary education that undermine learning outcomes and \ninternal and external efficiency. Such disparities include weak financial management capacity at the \nprovincial and district levels, lack of data-based decision-making, and low community involvement. \n \n9.    Sector development program approach. The government has called on ADB to support \nthe three policy areas of the Education Strategic Plan, 2009\u20132013: (i) equitable access to education \nservices, (ii) quality and efficiency of education services, and (iii) institutional development and \ncapacity building for decentralization. The sector development program modality is preferred as it \nprovides policy-based program support to help finance the cost of a new wave of reforms toward \nuniversal basic education. ADB\u2019s Country Partnership Strategy for Cambodia is closely aligned \nwith national priorities, including the strategy for education sector development.12  \n \n 10.  Building  on  achievements  of past  ADB  support.  The program is the third in the \nsequence of education sector development programs. It prioritizes lower secondary education in \norder to specifically address issues affecting universal basic education. The previous programs \nsupported the education sector at-large, including vocational education and skills development. \nThe Third Education Sector Development Program will build on the achievements of the first and \nsecond  programs,  which  increased  access  to  lower  secondary  education  nationwide.  It  will \ncontinue to expand access while supporting policy actions for improved quality of new school \n                                                \n9  In school year SY2010\u20132011, the dropout rate was 22% (22% female) from grade 7 and 22.4% (23.2% female) from \ngrade 9. The dropout rate from grade 8 was 20% (21.3% female). These rates are higher in rural areas. \n10 Despite  progress  in  girls\u2019  participation  in  basic  education,  gender-specific  constraints  (such  as  household \nresponsibilities) remain that require attention to close the gender gap. \n11 School operating budgets were introduced in SY2001\u20132002 when MOEYS abolished school entry fees. They \nfinance school operations and facilities maintenance, based on a flat rate per school plus a per capita amount per \nstudent, with different rates for each subsector.  \n12 ADB. 2011. Cambodia Country Partnership Strategy 2011\u20132013. Manila.  \n ", "3 \nbuilding  construction.  While  the  first  program  introduced  a  decentralized  system  of  school \noperating budgets and supported increased allocations from the education budget to school \noperating budgets, the third program will strengthen school-level accountability and support policy \nactions toward a revised funding formula for school operating budgets that enables schools to \nmeet students\u2019 needs. Additionally, while the second program addressed skills development \namong out-of-school youth, the third program will introduce employability skills development, with \na focus on entrepreneurship, at the lower secondary level in order to improve relevance.  \n \n11.  Lessons learned from the first and the second programs. Lessons learned influencing the \ndesign  of  the  program  include  (i)  balancing  expansion  of  the  education  system  with  quality \nimprovement, and (ii) prioritizing systemic reforms with attention to time frame and capacity of the \nexecuting agency. While project interventions under the program are designed to continue to \nexpand the education system, they also aim to build the capacity of school management and \nteachers to address student achievement and progression. Policy actions under the program are \nclosely aligned with project interventions. Consultative processes were taken into consideration \nduring design of the policy program. Lessons learned influencing implementation of the program \ninclude (i) ensuring full-time staff, and (ii) establishing indicators at the outset with credible data \nsources. Key project staff assigned to the program is full-time. Indicators monitored by the Ministry of \nEducation,  Youth  and  Sports  (MOEYS)  are  in  Appendix  1.  The  country  assistance  program \nevaluation rated ADB\u2019s education sector assistance program successful (low). 13 ADB support was \nassessed  as  relevant,  efficient,  likely  to  be  sustained,  and  having  a  substantial  impact.  The \nassessment indicated that ADB could enhance its approach to harmonization with partners. The \nprogram builds on the progress made by MOEYS with support from other development partners, \nresulting in greater harmonization with development partners than in past 10 years.14 \n \n12.  Development partner coordination. Policy actions under the program are aligned with \nreforms for directing resources to schools and strengthening school-based management that are \nsupported by the European Commission Budget Support Program, 2011\u20132013. To implement \nthese reforms, the program will support (i) the reestablishment of the public finance management \nreform working group to promote policy dialogue on education sector financing, and (ii) increased \naccountability at the school level. The program will expand the school improvement grant (SIG) \nscheme established under the Education for All Fast Track Initiative to reach lower secondary \nschools and enhance its focus to finance school-based enrichment programs. It will nationally \nscale up (i) school-based management training developed through the World Bank\u2019s Cambodia \nEducation Sector Support Program and the United States Agency for International Development\u2019s \nImproved Basic Education in Cambodia, while including data-based decision-making and school \nbudget planning skills; and (ii) math in-service teacher training (INSET) developed through the \nBasic Education Teacher Training Project under Belgian Technical Cooperation, while adopting \nthe in-service training model established by the Science Teacher Education Project under the \nJapan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The program will pilot test science INSET in \ncoordination  with  the  Flemish  Association  for  Development  Cooperation  and  Technical \nAssistance (VVOB). \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The impact of the program will be the achievement of universal 9-year basic education. \nThe outcome of the program will be increased lower secondary enrollment. While the program \ncomponent will be nationwide in scope, most project investments will be targeted to 14 provinces \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2009.

Outputs \n \n14.  The program will deliver three core outputs: (i) expanded access to lower secondary \neducation,  (ii)  improved  quality  of  lower  secondary  education,  and  (iii)  improved  subsector \nmanagement. \n \n1.  Policy-Based Loan Outputs \n \n15.  Policy actions under output 1 will support the government to (i) issue quality control \nguidelines for new school building construction to ensure use of good quality building materials, \ncompleteness of all procedures, and adherence to safety precautions in sound building design \nand  facilities;  and  (ii)  issue  prakas  for  establishment  packages  that  include  all  necessary \nmaterials for classroom instruction to ensure immediate start-up of newly constructed schools.16 \n \n16.  Policy actions under output 2 will support the government to (i) approve the National \nPolicy on Cambodian Youth Development, which recognizes that investment in youth is critical to \nrealize  the  government\u2019s  rectangular  strategy  and  long-term  vision  for  development17 and, \ntherefore, gives impetus to the basic education progression program supported as a tranche 2 \nrelease condition; (ii) issue prakas to recognize 26 secondary resource schools as learning sites \nfor  secondary  level  science  and  technology,  including  teacher  training,  and  the  secondary \nresource networks served;18 (iii) approve the Teacher Development Master Plan, 2010\u20132014 and \nits action plan, focused on implementing priority strategies for teacher development; (iv) issue \nguidelines to establish a basic education progression program to improve student achievement \nand progression, inclusive of targets for reduced repetition rates at primary and lower secondary \nschools;19 (v) adopt a new core breakthrough indicator20 for provincial level monitoring of grade 9 \ncompletion;  (vi)  circulate  the  final  Teacher  Policy  for  teacher  recruitment,  deployment, \nqualifications,  inservice  education,  professional  development;  and  career  path  growth;  and \n(vii) approve an action plan for professional development of school directors. \n \n17.  Policy actions under output 3 will support the government to (i) issue prakas to reestablish \nthe public finance management reform working group to examine sustainable recurrent financing \nfor basic education; (ii) approve a capacity development plan, targeting capacity constraints \nimpacting the overall performance of the education sector and supporting deconcentration and \ndecentralization;  (iii)  issue  prakas  and  approve  standard  operating  procedures  for  adopting \nrevised  funding  formula  for  school  operating  budgets;  (iv)  issue  revised  guidelines  for \nstrengthening school-based management and school support committees in implementation of \nschool  improvement  plans;  (v)  approve  the  Master  Plan  for  Research  Development  in  the \nEducation Sector; and (vi) approve an action plan for a school performance monitoring system, \n                                                \n15 These are Battambang, Kampong Cham, Kampong Chhnang, Kampong Speu, Kampong Thom, Otdar Meanchey, \nPailin, Pursat, Siem Reap, Banteay Meanchey, Mondulkiri, Ratanakiri, Stung Treng, and Preah Vihear. The average \npoverty rate in the target provinces is 70%\u201380%. \n16 Prakas refers to ministerial declaration.  \n17 Cambodia\u2019s Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity and Efficiency prioritizes enhancement of human \nresources with high technical and scientific skills that respond to the labor market.  \n18 Secondary resource networks include secondary schools served by the Secondary Resource School. \n19 High repetition rates at primary level will be addressed through the following policy actions under outputs 2 and 3: (i) \na basic education progression program, inclusive of the target for reducing the repetition rate to 3% per completed \nprimary school; and (ii) a school operating budget, inclusive of provision for a school improvement grant, to address \nstudent achievement and progression. \n20 The  Education  Strategic  Plan  adopted  a  framework  of  core  breakthrough  indicators  to  prioritize  strategic \ninterventions. \n ", "5 \ninclusive of school\u2013community report cards.21 \n \n18.  Details for the policy actions are provided in development policy letter (Appendix 3) and \npolicy matrix (Appendix 4). \n \n2.  Project Loan Outputs \n \n19.  The project loan supports investment activities that are closely aligned with the policy \ncomponents. The investment activities aim to support attainment of national targets for basic \neducation.22 As outlined below, investment activities under output 1 focus on 14 target provinces \nto leverage maximum impact on access, while outputs 2\u20133 are nationwide in scope with specific \ninterventions that focus on 14 target provinces. \n \n20.  Output 1: Improved access to lower secondary schools. The program will improve \naccess to lower secondary education through the (i) construction of 60 new lower secondary \nschools where none exist (11 provinces); (ii) provision of establishment packages, inclusive of \nnecessary classroom materials, to new schools to ensure immediate start-up; (iii) expansion of \n28 existing lower secondary schools with additional classrooms (eight provinces); (iv) addition of \nlower secondary classrooms to 22 existing primary schools (eight provinces); (v) construction of \n27 teacher  housing  units  as  an  incentive  to  attract  and  retain  teachers  in  remote  areas \n(14 provinces) and one dormitory at the Regional Teacher Training Center in Phnom Penh; and \n(vi) provision for clean water and lavatory facilities for 76 lower secondary schools where no such \nfacilities exist (14 provinces). Policy actions for the issuance of quality control guidelines for new \nschool  building  construction  and  prakas  for  establishment  packages  directly  support  the \nimplementation of investment activities for improving access to lower secondary education.  \n \n21.  Guided  by  the  National  Policy  on  Cambodian  Youth  Development,  the  program  will \nsupport a campaign to promote positive youth development, and increased participation and \ncompletion of basic education, with an emphasis on the benefits of completion for girls.23 \n \n22.  Output 2: Improved quality of lower secondary education. The program will improve \nthe quality of lower secondary education by introducing innovative interventions and scaling up \nexisting  successful  programs  of  other  development  partners.  The  program  will  train  school \ndirectors  to  develop  a  school-based  enrichment  program  aimed  at  improving  student \nachievement  and  progression,  inclusive  of  dropout  intervention  strategies.  The  program  will \nfinance  SIGs,  which  will  support  school  directors  in  implementing  school-based  enrichment \nprograms. SIGs will be made available to 100 lower secondary schools in the 14 target provinces. \nImplementation of the school-based enrichment program and SIGs will support the policy actions \nfor the basic education progression program and revised funding formula for school operating \nbudgets, inclusive of provision for government-funded SIGs.24 \n \n23.  The program will scale up to the national level the math INSET pilot project developed and \nimplemented through the Basic Education Teacher Training Project. The method for scaling up will \nbe training national trainers at Cambodia\u2019s six regional teacher training centers, to train technical \ngroup leaders specialized in math at lower secondary schools nationwide. The program will also \npilot  test  a  science-INSET  program  for  100  lower  secondary  schools  linked  to  recognized \n                                                \n21 Policy actions aligned with those of the European Commission Budget Support Program, 2011\u20132013 include those \nrelated to a revised funding formula for school operating budgets, with provision for a school improvement grant and \nstrengthened school-based management and community involvement. \n22 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) provides more detailed \ndescriptions of project interventions. \n23 The campaign will address demand-side issues, e.g., parents\u2019 low priority for education and gender-specific constraints. \n24 MOEYS administers SIGs. Implementation of SIGs under the program will enable MOEYS to identify how funds may \nbe utilized to support student achievement and progression through a school-based enrichment program, inclusive of \ndropout intervention strategies.  \n ", "6 \nsecondary  resource  schools.25 Collaborative  cofinancing  from  VVOB  will  support  the  science-\nINSET. The Teacher Development Master Plan, 2010\u20132014 and Teacher Development Action Plan \nwill serve as a framework for both INSET pilots. \n \n24.  The program will support the design and implementation of an employability skills program \naimed to provide integrated learning experiences for youth aged 12\u201314 years to prepare them for \nthe future workplace.26 Design and implementation will be guided by the strategic objectives of \nthe  National  Policy  on  Cambodian  Youth  Development  related  to  youth  participation  in  the \neconomic  development  of  Cambodia  and  gender.  Learning  experiences  will  support  the \ndevelopment of basic skills within the context of entrepreneurship and other areas supporting \nenterprise. The employability skills program will be designed to foster girls\u2019 empowerment. \n  \n25.  Output  3:  Improved  subsector  management.  The  program  will  improve  subsector \nmanagement by building the capacity of school directors in school-based management. It will also \nsupport strengthening the role of school support committees in school management through an \norientation program. A major focus of the orientation program will be implementation of school-\nbased enrichment programs and SIGs. The capacity development plan will serve as a framework \nfor the capacity building activities. The program will pilot test basic education school clusters to \nstreamline  administration  of  primary  and  lower  secondary  schools  and  enable  sharing  of \nresources  and  greater  community  engagement  in  basic  education  management.27 This  pilot \ntesting supports the policy action for adopting a new core breakthrough indicator for provincial level \nmonitoring of grade 9 completion to strengthen accountability at provincial and school levels. \n \n26.  The program will follow on from the Enhancing Education Quality Project to enhance the \ncapacity of the National Institute of Education to conduct action research by realizing impact \nstudies  and  comprehensive  data  analysis  and  evaluation.28 The  Master  Plan  for  Research \nDevelopment in the Education Sector will serve as a framework. Indicative focus areas for action \nresearch are (i) lower secondary school dropout intervention supported by grant funds, (ii) public \nfinance management in the education sector, (iii) gender mainstreaming in lower secondary \nschools, (iv) a sustainable national scholarship program, (v) employability skills at the lower \nsecondary level, (vi) improving lower secondary performance through community engagement, \n(vii) expanding child-friendly schools to the lower secondary level, and (viii) methods for INSET. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs   \n \n27.  The program financing is estimated at $30 million equivalent (Table 1). The government has \nrequested both a policy-based loan and project loan from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. \n \nTable 1: Financing Plan ($ million) \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank (policy-based loan)  12.00  38.50 \nAsian Development Bank (project loan)  18.00  57.70 \nGovernment of Cambodia  1.20   3.80 \n    Total  31.20  100.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n28.  Policy-based loan financing plan. To support the foreseen direct and indirect adjustment \ncosts  of  reforms,  the  government  has  requested  a  policy-based  loan  in  various  currencies \n                                                \n25 The pilot project is based on the science-INSET conducted by JICA.  \n26 Employability skills include basic skills, higher order thinking skills, and affective or \u2015soft\u2016 skills. \n27 The cluster school approach holds subnational education managers accountable for school performance and \nrequires stronger participation of school management and community stakeholders. \n28 The Department of Planning, MOEYS manages the education management information system at central, provincial, and \ndistrict levels in collecting data from schools. While MOEYS manages a number of key indicator databases, analysis of \nthese data is weak. Under the Enhancing Education Quality Project, the National Institute of Education has been \ndeveloping data analysis capacity. \n ", "7 \nequivalent to SDR7,870,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The loan will have a 24-year \nterm, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan agreement.29 The amount of the policy-based loan was determined by taking into account:  \n(i) adjustment costs in preparing, implementing, and monitoring the proposed policy actions; and \n(ii) the relative importance ascribed by the government to education sector development as \nreflected in budgetary allocations. The policy-based loan will be released in two equal tranches \nupon fulfillment of conditions expected for achievement by loan effectiveness and by the end of \n2013. Funds generated by policy-based loan tranches will support key development spending to \nfully implement policy actions towards universal basic education.  \n \n29.  Project  loan  investment  plan.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR11,805,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to finance the \ninvestment activities, including taxes and duties and recurrent costs (Table 2).30 The loan will \nhave a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set \nforth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.

The government\u2019s National Strategic Development Plan, 2009\u20132013 reaffirms its high \nprioritization of and commitment to strengthening the quality of education, which is premised upon \nwidely perceived socioeconomic gains at the individual and national levels such as improved \nhealth, lower infant mortality and a more responsive workforce to support a diversifying economy \nand higher economic productivity. A critical issue for the government is to ensure that efforts for \nimproving the quality  of  education  also  increase  service  efficiency, given  constrained  public \nfinances. The program aims to promote efficiency by incrementally lowering the total cost of producing \neach grade 9 graduate until a reduction of 19.5% is achieved. Policy actions and project interventions \nunder the program that aim to decrease dropout and repetition throughout the basic education cycle are \nlikely to yield the following efficiency gains: (i) reductions of 10.3% in the average number of years per \nprimary school completer and 14% in the average number of years per lower secondary school \ncompleter, and (ii) a reduction in the overall cost per primary school completer to $38.23 and per \nlower secondary school completer to $78.24. The projected MOEYS recurrent budget indicates \nsufficient resources for allocation to sustain the positive outcomes envisaged under the program. \n \nB.  Governance     \n \n32.  Assessments  of  MOEYS\u2019  financial  management  and  procurement  capacity  were \nconducted, and mitigation measures identified (para. 37).32 MOEYS is regarded as one of the \nhigher-performing line ministries in implementing the government\u2019s reform programs for improved \npublic  finance  management  and  decentralization  of  service  delivery.  However,  insufficient \nfinancial management capacity at provincial and district levels, including the school level, is \nforeseen to be a challenge to the added responsibilities and accountabilities under the next \nphases of reform, particularly with regard to the introduction of school-based budget planning. \nPolicy actions and project interventions under output 3 respond to constraints on the rollout of the next \nphases of public finance management and decentralization in the education sector. Through capacity \ndevelopment in key areas, the program seeks to achieve optimum alignment with government policies \nand systems, as well as ongoing support by development partners. \n                                                \n32 Sector- and project-level risk assessment and management plan were developed under ADB. 2008. Technical \nAssistance for Support for Implementation of the Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan. Manila \n(TA 6445-REG). \n ", "9 \n33.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MOEYS. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM.33 \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n34.  Poverty. The program prioritizes the poorest provinces of Cambodia. Access to lower \nsecondary  education  will  be  expanded  in  these  areas  with  the  construction  of  new  school \nbuildings in communes where none exist. Policy actions under the program will ensure that the \nreview  of  school  operating  budgets  and  guidelines  for  its  implementation  focus  on  equity \ndimensions to ensure improved access, achievement, and completion of basic education among \nthe poorest students. The program interventions will (i) empower school leadership to address \nissues and problems related to at-risk students from the poorest communities, (ii) ensure that \nschool-based dropout interventions focus on the issues specific to the poorest students that lead \nthem to be at risk of dropping out from lower secondary school, and (iii) promote the value of \nbasic  education  attainment  in  terms  of  its  impact  on  the  poorest  communities.  Program \ninterventions supporting the improvement of the overall relevance of teaching and learning at \nlower secondary level\u2014through enhanced mathematics and science learning experiences and \nthe introduction of an employability skills program\u2014will aim to empower the poorest students for \nfurther education and readiness for workforce participation.\n \n \n35.  Gender. The program theme is categorized gender equity. The program will address \nsociocultural barriers to girls\u2019 enrollment, retention, and completion at the basic education level; \nand girls\u2019 achievement of math and science skills and workplace readiness. The gender action \nplan ensures (i) all new school construction include separate latrines for girls; (ii) guidelines for \nSIGs to earmark funds for improving female access, achievement, and completion of basic \neducation;  (iii)  gender-specific  school-based  dropout  intervention  strategies;  (iv)  100%  of \nfemale school directors and deputy directors are trained in school-based management and in \nimplementing the school-based enrichment program; (v) 50% of national and provincial trainers \nselected for inservice teacher training for mathematics and science are female; (vi) 60% of \nparticipants in the employability skills programs are female; and (vii) development of a basic \neducation campaign to build awareness of the positive benefits of basic education completion for \nfemales and to promote female participation in the study of mathematics and science. \n \nD.  Safeguards  \n \n36.  In accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program is classified B \nfor involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. Civil works activities under the program will \ncover  small-scale  construction,  with  new  lower  secondary  schools  and  other  school \nimprovements expected to be carried out on government-, community-, or pagoda-owned land \nsituated in non-sensitive areas. It is not expected that land acquisition will result in involuntary \nresettlement impacts, but should any permanent or temporary impacts occur, a resettlement \nframework has been prepared to provide guidance in the event that a resettlement plan and \ncompensation measures need to be put in place. Civil works and other project interventions will \ntarget  poor  remote  areas,  many  of  which  have  large  populations  of indigenous  people.  An \nindigenous peoples matrix has been prepared to (i) describe the circumstances of indigenous \npeoples in Cambodia, (ii) identify project impacts, and (iii) describe mitigation measures. The \nprogram is classified category C for environment, having no significant adverse impacts. MOEYS \nwill appoint a staff member to monitor safeguards and ADB will provide training on SPS. The \nresettlement  framework  and  indigenous  peoples  matrix  are  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website  in \ncompliance with ADB information disclosure. \n \n                                                \n33 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n37.  Key risks include (i) the mismatch between MOEYS budget allocations and inflation rate, \nspecifically in terms of program-based budget allocations to school operating budgets; and (ii) \nadded financial management responsibilities and accountabilities at the subnational levels as per \nthe government\u2019s decentralization reforms. Inadequate allocations to school operating budgets \nundermine the sector\u2019s policy goals and increase the risk for schools to charge informal fees from \nstudents. This may lead families to withdraw children from basic education because they cannot \nafford to pay such fees. Weak governance is a concern, with additional challenges created by \ndecentralization  reforms.  Governance  constraints  are  related  to  planning,  budgeting,  budget \nexecution, internal control and audit, and transparent reporting at the subnational levels. Risk \nmitigating measures include (i) building financial management capacity at the provincial, district, \nand school levels with regard to the introduction of school-based budget planning; (ii) promoting \npolicy  dialogue  with  MOEYS  on  financing  issues  in  the  education  sector  through  the  joint \ntechnical  working  group  on  Public  Financial  Management  Reform  Program  specific  to  the \neducation sector; and (iii) sustaining the joint Ministry of Economy and Finance\u2013MOEYS working \ngroup on financing issues in the education sector.34 \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITION \n \n38.  The government and MOEYS have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in \nthe PAM and loan documents. The government and MOEYS have agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the program, which are set forth in the loan agreements and that the loan will not be \ndeclared effective until the government, through MOEYS, has fulfilled all conditions for the release \nof the first tranche as set out in the policy matrix (Appendix 4). \n \nV.
