The program builds \non  the  long-term  engagement  of the  Asian  Development  Bank (ADB)  in  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  education \nsector and tackles key challenges stemming from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nStrategic Context \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nBackground. Sri Lanka recorded an average annual economic growth rate of 5.2% from \n2010  to  2019, 2 reaching  upper  middle-income  status  in  2019.  Growth  has  since  been  slowing \n(2.3%  in  2019), 3 partly  because  of the  2019  Easter  bombings,  which  devastated the  country\u2019s \nvital tourism industry, a main source of jobs, and discouraged foreign investment. The country \nwas reclassified as a lower middle-income country in June 2020. 4 The impact of COVID-19 5 is \nexpected to contract real gross domestic product by 5.5% in 2020 and sharply increase poverty. 6 \nSri Lanka aspires to be an advanced knowledge economy 7 but needs to develop its human capital \nand transition to higher-value, more complex economic activities. 8 Education and skilled labor are \nthus national priorities.  \n \nEducation  sector  context.  The  government  aims  to  empower  young  people  to  reach \n4. \ntheir full potential, and infuse new technology to enhance production and productivity, as set out \nin the 2019 National Policy Framework (footnote 7). Enrollment in primary and lower secondary \neducation  is  high, 9 but  upper  secondary  education  falls  short  on  access,  quality  (especially  in \nprovincial or rural schools), and relevance to the labor market.  \n \n\n \n\n1  In Sri Lanka, upper secondary education refers to grades 10\u201313, lower secondary refers to grades 6\u20139, and primary \nrefers to grades 1\u20135.

Gender parity was achieved in primary and lower secondary schools, but in upper secondary education, \n107 girls are enrolled for every 100 boys. United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization Institute \nfor Statistics (accessed 4 August 2020).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nLabor market requirements. With an aging population, Sri Lanka\u2019s competitiveness will \n5. \ndepend  on  building  a  diversified  and  agile  workforce  able  to  adapt,  innovate,  and  apply \ntechnology. 10 The  country  faces  a  shortage  of  skilled  labor  in  industry  and  services,  and  a \nshortage of employable young people. Unemployment rates among youth (21.4%) and women \n(7.1%) are higher than the national average (4.4%). 11 The labor market has three requirements \nthat the current education system does not meet. First, graduates with a foundation in science \nand  technology  are  in  high  demand,  followed  by  graduates  in  commerce  and  management, 12 \nespecially  for  the  service  sector. 13 Arts  graduates  are  less  in  demand,  accounting  for  59%  of \nunemployed graduates in 2018 (footnote 11). Second, the demand for highly skilled workers has \noutpaced demand for lower skill levels. Between 2015 and 2018, the number of workers employed \nin skilled jobs, such as managers and professionals, rose by 29%, while the number of those in \nlower skilled jobs increased by 3.9%. 14 Third, industry, services, and trade require young people \nwith  critical  cognitive  skills,  digital  and  English  skills,  and  21st  century  skills,  such  as  problem \nsolving, creative thinking, teamwork, and communication (footnote 10 and Appendix 3). 15  \n \n6. \nLimited  access to  science,  technology,  engineering,  and  mathematics  education. \nDespite  high  access  rates  overall,  upper  secondary  enrollments  remain  skewed  toward  arts \nsubjects.  Only  a  third  of  upper  secondary  students  were  enrolled  in  science  and  technology \nstreams  in  2018. 16  Nationwide,  only  36%  of  schools  with  General  Certificate  of  Education \nAdvanced  Level  (\u2018A\u2019  Level)  streams  offer  science,  technology,  engineering,  and  mathematics \n(STEM). 17  \n \n7. \nQuality  issues.  Secondary  education  learning  outcomes  are  poor,  as  measured  by \nnational and international tests. 18 In 2019, 26% of students did not pass the grade 11 General \nCertificate of Education Ordinary Level (\u2018O\u2019 Level) examination, while 38% of school candidates \ndid not pass the \u2018A\u2019 Level exams. The failure rate in \u2018A\u2019 Level mathematics was 63%. 19   \n \n\nFuture. Colombo and Mal\u00e9.  \n\n \n\n10 International Labour Organization. 2019.

The  COVID-19  outbreak 20 disrupted  education  for  more  than  5.57 \n8. \nmillion learners (including 2.73 million at secondary level) when schools and universities had to \nclose. 21 In  response,  the  government  is  implementing  the  Contingency  Emergency  Response \nPlan (CERP) for general education, 22 using e-learning platforms and/or classes through television. \nHowever, children and teachers in rural areas lack internet connectivity, access to devices and \ndigital  platforms,  and  the  training  required  for  distance  education. 23  Thus,  the  COVID-19 \npandemic has exacerbated rural\u2013urban inequity, while causing learning losses that could lead to \nmore dropouts. 24 If unchecked, learning losses and poor education quality could lead to high and \nsustained costs. Sri Lanka cannot afford to ignore these issues. 25 As a result, the government \nrequested  ADB  to  reprioritize  its  assistance  program  in  2020  to  support  the  government\u2019s \nresponse to the impacts of COVID-19, focusing on continuity in education, among others. The \nproposed  program  is  part  of  a  package  of  ADB  support  to  mitigate  COVID-19  impacts  in  Sri \nLanka. 26  \n \n9. \nGender issues. Sri Lanka has achieved gender parity in secondary education, with more \ngirls  in  the  education  system  performing  better  than  boys,  and  overall  higher  participation  and \npass rates. At \u2018A\u2019 Level, boys are outnumbered by girls, and in the examinations, girls outperform \nboys by 20 percentage points (footnote 19). The key issue in education is the limited participation \nof girls in market-relevant subjects and streams. Female enrollment for \u2018A\u2019 Level streams is twice \nas high as that of males in the arts stream, but only 6% of girls enrolled are in the technology \nstream,  compared  with  18%  of  boys. 27  This  tendency  contributes  to  lowering  the  future \nemployability potential of females: among those with upper secondary education or higher, the \nunemployment rate is 13.2% among females and 5.1% among males (footnote 11).  \n \nB. \n \n10. \nPrevious reforms and lessons learned. In 2013, the government laid the foundation for \nmodernizing  secondary  education  by  (i)  introducing  the  technology  stream;  (ii)  investing  in \nappropriate facilities for STEM education; and (iii) supporting leadership training for principals and \ndeputy principals. The transformative reform trajectory was supported by ADB\u2019s Education Sector \nDevelopment  Program,  an  earlier  results-based  lending  (RBL)  program. 28 The  lessons  from  it \n\nProgram Rationale \n\n \n\n20 The government has so far contained the outbreak, with 4,252 confirmed cases (cumulative) and 13 deaths as of 7 \n\nOctober 2020.

It is also \nvital  to (i) strengthen  upper  secondary  education  (grades  10\u201313),  so that  students  can  pursue \nmultiple  pathways;  (ii)  continue  strengthening  educational  leadership  at schools  and  provincial \nauthorities,  but  with  emphasis  on  effective  local  action  (e.g.,  school  grants  and  school \ndevelopment plans); and (iii) continue performance-based partnership agreements between the \nMinistry of Education (MOE) and provincial authorities, with emphasis on mutual accountability \nand alignment between reforms and local needs. In addition, ADB\u2019s independent evaluation of \nthe RBL modality 29 highlighted the need for stronger monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems \nto better track sector performance, while COVID-19 underscored the need to build resilience into \nthe education system, such as multimodal approaches to education delivery, remedial learning, \nand remote teacher training. \n \n11. \n2025 (para. 2) has four thrusts: (i) quality of education improved, especially in science, technology, \nand mathematics; (ii) equity in education strengthened; (iii) stewardship and service delivery of \ngeneral education strengthened; and (iv) evidence-based education policymaking and planning \nenhanced. The government requested ADB support for the GESDP in relation to upper secondary \neducation, to continue reforms and help manage the following priority issues:  \n\nGovernment program. Building on the above reforms, the government\u2019s GESDP 2020\u2013\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nTo meet workforce requirements (para. 5), the education system needs to produce \nyoung people able to learn new skills and technologies, with a sound foundation in \nmarket-relevant  subjects  and  21st  century  skills.  The  current  education  system \nemphasizes  routine  cognitive  skills,  with  content-heavy  curricula,  and  lacks  an \ninquiry-based  approach 30  with  practical  applications.  The  assessment  system \nemphasizes  information  recall,  rather  than  analysis  and  problem  solving. 31 \nInadequate quality of teaching contributes to poor learning outcomes (para. 7). 32 \nThus, curricula, assessment system, and pedagogy all need substantial reform.  \nDespite  previous  efforts  (para.  10),  STEM  access  is  limited  because  qualified \nSTEM teachers are scarce and are not deployed evenly to urban and rural schools. \nMany teachers teach subjects for which they are not qualified. \nSTEM access for girls and the underperformance of boys require attention (para. \n9). \nCOVID-19  (para.  8)  highlights  inequalities  in  access  to  digital  education  and \nblended  learning, 33 and  the  need  to  build  system  resilience  by  (a)  integrating \nonline  and  distance  learning  approaches  and  resources;  (b)  building  teacher \ncapacity in digital skills and virtual teaching; and (c) supporting remedial lessons \nfor students left behind.  \n\n \nEducation sector management.

Inquiry-based curricula and approach are defined in the verification protocols (Table A3.2., DLI 2). \n\n31 Classroom assessments integrated into daily teaching are required for student learning and teacher guidance.  \n32 Teachers are not sufficiently trained in inquiry-based teaching\u2013learning practices. \n33 Blended  learning  refers  to  a  combination  of  online  learning,  educational  television  and  radio  programs,  remote \n\nlearning, and classroom-based face-to-face approaches. \n\n\fremains  skewed  to  urban  schools. 34  Fragmented  M&E  systems  affect  sector  planning  and \nmonitoring.  Budgeting  and  procurement  processes  and  social  and  environmental  safeguard \ncapacities (paras. 33\u201336) could be strengthened. \n \nTiming. The proposed program is aligned with the government\u2019s GESDP and CERP (para. \n13. \n8),  which  cannot  afford delays.  Curricula  and  pedagogy  reforms  have  already  begun  earlier  in \n2020, and new \u2018O\u2019 Level exams are scheduled for 2024. CERP\u2019s COVID-19 mitigation measures \nare integrated into the program, which is scheduled to begin in late 2020. \n \n14. \nResults-based lending. The RBL modality is appropriate because the program (i) is part \nof  a  strong  education  sector  plan  (footnote  1)  with  expenditure  framework;  (ii)  builds  on  the \nprevious RBL program\u2019s achievements and experience; (iii) strengthens national and subnational \nsystems in delivering reforms; (iv) focuses on results, not on transactions and expenditures; and \n(v)  makes  development  coordination  more  effective  since  development  partners  are  working \nwithin a common results framework. ADB financing represents 12.5% of the government\u2019s upper \nsecondary education agenda under the GESDP, so the program is designed to leverage large-\nscale and unprecedented reforms. The executing agency and other stakeholders have experience \nwith  the  RBL  approach.  The  program  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030 35 and  the  country \npartnership strategy, 2018\u20132022, and is included in its country operations business plan, 2020\u2013\n2022. 36  \n \nADB\u2019s value addition. ADB adds value by (i) bringing cutting-edge expertise in innovative \n15. \nand \nin  partnership  with  reputed \nteaching\u2013learning  approaches, \ninternational institutes sharing best practices; (ii) creating synergy across secondary education, \ntechnical and vocational education and training, and higher education, with ADB\u2019s support in all \nthree subsectors; 37 (iii) enabling the implementation of better teacher deployment strategies; (iv) \nempowering  schools  and  communities to  implement  local  actions that  support the reforms;  (v) \nmitigating the impact of COVID-19 in education; and (vi) accelerating the reforms by strengthening \nsector  management.  The  program\u2019s  focus  on  upper  secondary  education  (grades  10\u201313) \ncomplements  the  World  Bank\u2019s  support  to  primary  and  lower  secondary  education  (grades  1\u2013\n9). 38 Table 1 shows the key development partners. 39  \n \nC. \n \n16. \non upper secondary education (Table 1).  \n\nThe proposed program is aligned with the government\u2019s GESDP 2020\u20132025 and focuses \n\ninquiry-based  blended \n\nProgram Scope \n\n \n\n34 Provincial schools, run by PEAs, account for 95% of schools and 65% of total general education expenditure.

By 2026, reforms supported by the program \nwill benefit about 953,000 students (503,000 females and 450,000 males) annually. The program \nwill  also  have  equipped  47,853  teachers  (31,583  women  and  16,270  men)  with  skills  that  will \nbenefit successive generations of students. \n \n18. \nOutput  1: Quality  and relevance  of  secondary  science, technology,  mathematics, \nand  commerce  programs  enhanced.  The  ADB  program  will  foster  integrated  reforms  to \ncurricula, pedagogy, and assessments.

The campaign will also educate children and \ncommunities on disease risk and prevention, disaster resilience, and preparedness.  \n \n19. \nOutput  2:  Provincial  and  school  capacity  to  implement  education  reforms \nstrengthened. The program aims to reduce disparities between urban and provincial schools and \nempower local authorities to translate reforms into local actions. It will promote the implementation \nof government policy on equitable distribution of teachers (DLI 4), including monetary and non-\nmonetary  incentives.  It  will  also  strengthen  the  capacity  of  principals  and  PEAs  to  support \nimproved practices, approaches, and technologies. PEAs will develop a blended learning plan to \ntailor modes of delivery based on students\u2019 specific needs and circumstances, including short-, \nmedium-, and long-term measures to strengthen online and remote learning. 42 A budget line will \nbe  created  to  implement  school  development  plans  that  will  help  schools  meet  local  needs  to \nimprove learning, attract more students (especially girls) to take up STMC subjects, and reduce \ndropouts  among  boys  (DLI  5).  The  program  will  also  support  annual  performance-based \npartnership  agreements  between  PEAs  and  MOE  (para.  10),  including  adequate  resource \nallocation, especially for poorer schools (DLI 6). \n \n20. \nOutput 3: Sector management capacity strengthened. The program will enhance the \nreliability and use of data, strengthen M&E systems, and MOE's capacity for research, evidence-\nbased  planning,  and  management  (DLI  7).  It  will  also  (i)  improve  MOE  and  PEAs\u2019  fiduciary \nmanagement and compliance with the government\u2019s financial and procurement regulations; (ii) \nstrengthen MOE  and  PEAs\u2019  capacity for  social  and  environmental  safeguards;  and (iii)  ensure \nthat all activities (under the proposed program) are gender-mainstreamed, and data and results \ndisaggregated by sex. 43 An indicator not linked to disbursement focuses on the introduction and \nyearly application of program-based budgeting compliant with sector targets by MOE. \n \nDisbursement-linked and other indicators. 44 The program results assessment shows \n21. \nthat the results chain is sound, and that the seven DLIs and three outputs are designed to achieve \nthe  program  outcome. 45 The  DLIs  also  relate  to  the  GESDP  2020\u20132025  (para.  11).

The program soundness assessment 52 \n28. \nindicates that the RBL program, while ambitious, is comprehensive and tackles problems related \nto  poor  education  quality  and  relevance,  and  limited  access to  subjects  with  high  employment \npotential. Public interventions are justified: 90% of all schools are public schools, and 95% of all \nSri Lankan students attend public schools. The results assessment shows that the RBL program \nand  results  framework  are  well-designed,  the  DLIs  are  critical  for  achieving  results,  and  the \nprogram interventions are expected to improve sector performance and outcome. \n \n29. \nEconomic analysis. The program is expected to improve the employment opportunities \nand incomes of young people in two ways: by (i) equipping students with higher competencies \nand market-relevant skills to qualify them for higher-paying jobs; and (ii) increasing their readiness \nfor higher education in STMC fields, which offer greater employment potential and higher income. \nThe program also contributes to addressing learning losses caused by COVID-19. By improving \ninternal  efficiency  in  the  education  system,  the  program  contributes  to  resource  savings.  In \naddition to incurring positive private returns, the economic rationale for the program is justified by \n(i) high macroeconomic returns to investment in educational attainment and quality, as suggested \nby  global  evidence; 53 (ii)  reductions  in  poverty  and  inequality  (para.  30);  (iii)  the  wider  social \nbenefits incurred; and (iv) in the long term, improved competitiveness and economic growth. The \neconomic  value  of  investing  in  education  quality  is  even  greater  in  the  context  of  changing \ndemands for skills because of the fourth industrial revolution and Sri Lanka\u2019s aging population. \nYouth need to be equipped with the skills that are likely to yield better labor market outcomes and \naccelerate  growth.  While  there  are  trade-offs  to  investing  in  education  quality,  the  short-term \nopportunity  costs  are  likely  to  be  outweighed  by  the  expected  gains  and  the  contribution  to \n\n \n\n50 A transaction technical assistance grant is currently being processed to support capacity development on curriculum, \npedagogy, and assessment reforms.

Hanushek and L. Woessman. 2015. Knowledge Capital of Nations. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. \n\n\feconomic  recovery  and  growth  in  the  long  term.  Since  the  RBL  program  is  part  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s  upper  secondary  education  sector  program,  quantitative  attribution  of  benefits \nsolely  to  the  RBL  program  would  be  difficult,  so  no  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  or  calculation  of  an \neconomic internal rate of return was done. \n \n30. \nPoverty  and  inequality  reduction.  The  program\u2019s  emphasis  on  better  access  to  and \nquality of secondary education, with its targeted support for underperforming provincial schools, \nwill enable poor, rural students to gain a relevant education in school. This will provide them with \nbetter post-secondary options for further education, skills development, and livelihoods.   \n \n31. \nGender  impact.  The  program  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The \nprogram aims to increase girls\u2019 participation in STEM education and widen the horizon for women. \nIt includes strategies to encourage girls\u2019 take-up of STEM via media campaigns and school-based \nactions outlined in the school development plans; such actionable steps in school development \nplans  are  a  key  criterion  for  securing  school  grants  (DLI  5).  The  program  also  includes  career \ncounseling by female role models to familiarize girls with the range of options available in STEM \n(program action plan). It supports training of teachers, provincial education officers, and M&E staff \nwith gender targets set at 60%, and training of principals and deputy principals with gender targets \nset at 40% (design and monitoring framework). Gender is mainstreamed into all activities relating \nto  curricula,  instructional  guides,  needs  analyses,  and  capacity  development.  All  management \nand  monitoring  systems  will  report  sex-disaggregated  data.  The  program  tackles  the  issue  of \naccess to STEM within an education reform program comprehensively, with activities that aim to \nchange gender-biased stereotypes and create an enabling environment for girls and women in \nthe education system. In addition, the program addresses higher drop-out and under-performance \namong boys. It includes an assessment of factors behind drop-out and low performance of boys, \nwhich will be used to develop school-level actions to improve performance outlined in the school \ndevelopment plans. \n \nB. \n \n32.  Monitoring and evaluation system. The M&E system assessment (footnote 47) found \ninadequate integration of M&E systems. The program's design incorporates these findings and \ncovers the need for stronger capacities, better analysis, and a transparent consolidated national \neducation management information system (DLI 7, para. 20).  \n \n33. \nFiduciary systems. Education is a priority for the government, as shown by the strong \ntrack record of public spending in this sector since 2010. Education expenditure steadily increased, \nregardless of the fiscal situation and deficit; and as a percentage of public spending, it consistently \nremained  above  10%  since  2014.  The  program expenditure framework assessment  evaluated \npast budget against actual expenditure incurred and noted that, although expenditure is constant, \nthe government budget is usually overestimated. Likewise, because of weak budgetary practices, \nthe fiduciary systems assessment concluded that the overall pre-mitigation financial management \nrisk is substantial. 54 The risk includes (i) uncertainty in budget allocation; (ii) suboptimal budget \nestimation practices; (iii) inconsistent use of provincial budget codes by the provinces; and (iv) \nchallenges related to compliance with the government\u2019s financial regulations, resulting in recurring \naudit  observations.  To  mitigate  the  risk  and  strengthen  the  systems,  ADB  will  support  the \nimplementation  of  program-based  budgeting  and  provide  hands-on  support  to  MOE  and  the \nprovinces to develop robust processes and procedures, budget codes, and an efficient reporting \nand monitoring system for the program.  \n\nProgram Systems Assessments \n\n54 Program Fiduciary Systems Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nProcurement.  Sri  Lanka  has  a  functional  public  procurement  system,  based  on \n34. \ncomprehensive  National  Procurement  Guidelines  issued  in  2006,  which  are  supplemented  by \ndetailed manuals for the procurement of goods and works, and the recruitment of consultants. An \nassessment of the procurement system was conducted, and benefited from the findings of earlier \nassessments of country and sector procurement systems, as well as a review of procurement in \nthe previous RBL program and other education programs. 55 While MOE has reasonable capacity \nfor procurement, the assessment indicates that adherence to the standard procedures laid down \nin  the  2006  National  Procurement  Guidelines  could  be  improved.  A  procurement  and  contract \nmanagement workshop will be conducted for MOE staff to mitigate the procurement risks. \n \n35. \nAnticorruption  measures.  The  government  has  been  strengthening  anticorruption \nmeasures, including the enforcement of existing anticorruption laws, the creation of special courts \nto  deal  specifically  with  corruption,  and  a  5-year  Anti-Corruption  Action  Plan  with  the  target  of \nmaking Sri Lanka a corruption-free nation by 2023. The Guidelines to Prevent or Mitigate Fraud, \nCorruption,  and  Other  Prohibited  Activities  in  RBL  programs  were  explained  to  and  discussed \nwith the government and MOE. 56 \n \n36. \nSafeguards. The safeguard categories are C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous \npeoples,  since  no  involuntary  resettlement  impact  and  no  impact  on  indigenous  peoples  are \nanticipated  from  minor  renovations  of  existing  educational  facilities. 57  While  no  significant  or \nirreversible adverse environmental impacts are expected, the exact specifications are yet to be \nfinalized, so the program was categorized B for environment as a precautionary measure.  58 The \nsafeguard  systems  assessment  (footnote  57)  found  gaps  such  as  the  limited  scope  of \nenvironmental assessments and weak capacity to implement safeguards. An environmental and \nsocial  management  framework  was  prepared  combining  national  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009) requirements to guide screening, categorization, assessment, \nmonitoring, and reporting. Any activity categorized A for environment, or A or B for involuntary \nresettlement or indigenous peoples, will be excluded from the program. The program is committed \nto the implementation of an action plan to bridge the gaps. 59 \n \nC. \n \nTable 5 summarizes major risks and mitigating measures.

Inquiry-based  means  students  investigate \nproblems and issues, and build their understanding from the evidence they gather. Interactive teaching means that \nstudents collaborate, discuss, and evaluate knowledge and arguments to derive understanding. Applied problems \nmean practical issues and challenges that are familiar to students in their everyday contexts. All technical terms are \ndefined further in the verification protocols. The new curriculum will incorporate blended learning approaches as well \nas awareness and prevention of communicable diseases, as and where appropriate. Blended learning approaches \nrefer to a combination of online learning, educational television or radio programs, remote learning, and classroom-\nbased face-to-face approaches. \n\ne  Program schools are 750 schools that provide STMC streams, of which 80% are provincial schools. \nf  The criteria for teacher deployment as per the MOE circular include, among others, student\u2013teacher ratio, teacher \n\nqualifications and experience, and location of school. \n\ng  The program implementation period is from 2021\u20132025 (from loan signing to completion). The expenditure framework \n\nand program financing is from 2020\u20132025 as it includes one year of prior results. \n\nContribution to Strategy 2030 Operational Priorities \nThe expected values and methodological details for all OP indicators to which this operation will contribute results are \ndetailed in Contribution to Strategy 2030 Operational Priorities (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2 of the report and recommendation of the President). \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Ministry of Education. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/RRPs/?id=52203-001-3 \n \n\n1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \n5. \n6. \n7. \n8. \n9. \n10. \n11. \n12. \n13. \n14. \n15. \n16. \n17. \n\nLoan Agreement \nCountry Economic Indicators  \nSector Assessment (Summary): Education  \nProgram Soundness Assessment  \nProgram Results Assessment  \nProgram Results Framework  \nProgram Expenditure and Financing Assessment  \nProgram Monitoring and Evaluation System Assessment  \nProgram Fiduciary Systems Assessment  \nIntegrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures  \nContribution to Strategy 2030 Operational Priorities \nDevelopment Coordination  \nSummary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy  \nProgram Implementation Document  \nProgram Safeguard Systems Assessment  \nEnvironmental and Social Management Framework \nProgram Action Plan \n\nSupplementary Documents \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n18. \n19.

Science and technology laboratories have been provided to provincial schools under the \n1,000 Schools Program, but these remain under-utilized as the curricula and corresponding pedagogy have been focused on rote learning with limited practical \napplication. There are also mathematics and ICT laboratories in these schools. These laboratories will be used as innovation laboratories in the SESIP supported \nprogram schools for hands-on learning in STMC subjects and will need to comply with the minimum standards for the conduct of practical science, technology, \nmathematics, and IT/commerce activities aligned with the new curricula, developed by NIE. The new curriculum will incorporate blended learning approaches as \nwell as communicable diseases awareness and prevention, as and where appropriate. Blended learning approaches refer to a combination of online learning, \neducational television/radio programs, remote learning, and classroom-based face-to-face approaches. \n\nd  SESIP will target the following \u2018A\u2019 Level stream/ subjects: science (physics, chemistry, and biology); combined mathematics; technology (engineering technology, \nbio-systems technology, and science for technology); commerce (business studies, accounting, economics, and ICT). This is a total of 11 subjects and these will \nhereafter be referred to as program \u2018A\u2019 Level subjects. There are Tamil, Sinhalese, and bi-lingual schools in the current education system. All materials including \ntextbooks will be developed and   translated in both Sinhalese and Tamil languages and teacher training will also include both languages. \n\ne  Media campaign includes the use of various media (mass media, e-platforms, and/or interpersonal communication) as appropriate for the target audience in both \nurban and rural settings, with information on the education reforms\u2014on the new curriculum, new inquiry-based teaching practices and assessment systems\u2014and \nin particular on its benefits for developing students with adaptive and interdisciplinary, 21st century skills required for the modern global economy and in line with \nfuture labor  market needs.  The  media campaign  will  use  various formats for  the  different groups  of stakeholders  in  order  to  reach  them.  These may  include \neditorials in newspapers, radio/TV talk shows, radio/TV spots or commercials, e-materials for internet/MOE website, interpersonal communication, as appropriate, \non the nature of the education reforms and the need for these reforms, future of education in Sri Lanka, materials to allay concerns of parents and general public \non  the  education  reforms,  deployment  of  teachers  in  provincial  schools  and  dissemination  of  the  fact  that  all  teachers  will  be  trained  on  new  curriculum  and \nencourage parents to send children to provincial 1AB schools; and that additional support will be provided to provincial 1AB schools to build their capacity, and \nencouraging girls to take up STMC subjects, etc.1AB schools are schools providing the four upper secondary streams. \n\nf  The teacher training facilities are dispersed throughout the country covering all provinces. There is also one teacher training laboratory at NIE at the national level. \nThese and other facilities, as identified, will be potentially converted to Applied Resource Hubs which will be used for the conduct of practical science, mathematics, \ntechnology, and IT/commerce activities for teacher training. Criteria for Applied Resource Hubs would be that at least one such Hub is located in every district and \nwithin easy distance of the project-supported schools making it convenient for teachers to attend the training. NIE will develop the criteria/minimum standards for \nApplied Resource Hubs for teacher training in new pedagogy. A survey of these teacher training facilities plus NIE hub will be conducted to identify staff and \nequipment needs against the NIE criteria/minimum standards for Applied Resource Hubs. A pool of trainers for each subject in both languages where applicable, \nwill need to be identified at national and provincial levels to act as resource trainers for Applied Resource Hubs. \n\ng  SESIP will target around 750 1AB schools of which 80% or 600 will be provincial 1AB schools\u2014hereafter these will be referred to as program-targeted schools. \nThese provincial schools have the potential of offering the 4 streams\u2014science, technology, mathematics, and commerce streams\u2014but are hampered by a range \nof key challenges including, lack of teachers, lack of effective pedagogy, lack of use of the science labs, etc. Criteria for selection of provincial schools: (i) location \nof school in province, rural/ remote and/or marginalized area; (ii) location of school vis-\u00e0-vis feeder schools; and (iii) location of schools vis-\u00e0-vis proximity to \nnational schools or to fully pledged provincial schools in high demand.   \n\nh  Deployment means recruitment, placement, and redeployment. \ni  Performance-based partnership agreements will (i) review achievements and challenges faced by provinces; (ii) outline targets, related strategies, budgets and \naccountabilities  for  improving  learning  outcomes,  attracting  and  increasing  students,  especially  girls  into  STMC;  (iii)  improving  pedagogy;  (iv)  adopt  cross \nlearning/sharing opportunities; and (v) implement performance-based allocation to provide support to lagging schools to improve their performance against key \nreform indicators, as outlined in SDPs.  \n\nj  The integrated M&E framework approval will include the following aspects: document drafted, reviewed, and validated by the standing committee. M&E framework \nwill include the list of key indicators from the different institutions to be tracked in NEMIS. The policy will also lay out the technical issues with regard to online \ndatabase, procedures for capturing and processing data, with suggestions for enhancing the present arrangement. \n\n \n\n\f26 \n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nk  The present monitoring formats used at MOE, provincial, and zonal levels will be standardized to ensure the data reported are consistent and uniform across all \nlevels. This would enable the monitoring of programs and projects effectively. For the new/revised formats developed, user guides will be produced to provide \nguidelines on filling the formats (paper/online). Guides will also provide clear definitions and explanation of various reporting items. Data quality standards will be \ndeveloped based on data quality assessment in consultation with DCS. \n\nl  Annual education sector performance reports can include data analysis on equitable access and participation in the primary and secondary education; trends in \nstudent performance and learning outcomes, progress made in empowerment of professional staff, education expenditure analysis, and progress towards national \ngoals and SDG 4 targets. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank and Ministry of Education. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n27 \n\nTable A3.2: Disbursement-Linked Indicator Verification Protocols \n\n \nDisbursement-Linked Indicators \nDLI 1: A student assessment system for improving learning and 21st century skills established by 2025.  \n2019 baseline:  \nNo assessments yet based on new \ncurriculum.  \n \n \n\nDefinition and Description of Achievement \n\n \n\nInformation \nSource and \nFrequency \n\nVerification \nAgency, and \nProcedure  \n\nDisbursement \nformula \n(refer to Table 6 of \nthe PID for amounts) \n\n \n\n \n\n(Date) 2021: \n(i) NSAF developed in accordance \nwith new curriculum and approved. \n\n(i) DOE, one \ntime in 2021 \n\n(i) MOE/DOE \nprepares an \nattestation that the \nDLI is met and \nattaches the NSAF. \nThe IVA will verify \nthe NSAF against the \nagreed criteria. \n\n(i) If target is \nachieved, 50% of \nthe annual allocation \nfor this DLI is \ndisbursed.  \nRollover: Yes \n\nProgram  schools  are selected  by  MOE  to  satisfy  the \nfollowing criteria: \nType 1AB schools: \nAt  least  750  schools  of  which  80%  are  provincial \nschools. \nThe criteria for the selection of provincial schools are \n(i) the location of the school should be in rural, remote \nor  marginalized  areas;  (ii)  the  school  should  have  a \nsufficient  number  of  feeder  schools;  and  (iii)  the \nprovincial  school  must  not  be  too  close  to  national \nschools, since parents will then not send their children \nto the provincial school; and \nThe  exact  number  of  schools  to  be  selected  for  the \nprogram  will  be  finalized  after  analysing  the  data  as \nper the criteria indicated in the verification protocol. \n(i) The target is considered met when the NSAF has \nbeen developed, approved, and satisfies the following \ncriteria: \n\u2022  NSAF  identifies  and  describes  the  types  and \npurposes of academic assessments for students \nwhich  will  be  undertaken.
