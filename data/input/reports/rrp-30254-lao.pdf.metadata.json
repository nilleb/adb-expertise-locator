The  transfer  of  assets  is  expected  to  be\ncomplemented by the establishment of water user associations\n(WUAs),  rehabilitation  of  infrastructure,  and  enhancement  of\nextension  capacity.  A  sector  approach  is  proposed  to  be\nadopted. Prospective subprojects will be located in 17 districts in\nsix  provinces  identified  on  the  basis  of  specific  criteria.  A\ndetailed  feasibility  study  has  been  completed  for  two  core\nsubprojects  in  Nakhong  and  Chom  Thong,  in  consultation  with\nstakeholders,  and  the  financial  and  economic  viability  of  the\nrehabilitation  program  established.  The  Project  will  provide\nWUAs  with  support  for  developing  their  capacity  in  financial\nmanagement  and  market  development.  WUAs  are  expected  to\nimplement  proposed  cost  recovery  measures.  Rehabilitation  of\nirrigation  systems  will  include  repairs  to  the  pump  sets,  and\nreview  of  the  appropriateness  of  the  present  design  of  the\nheadworks  and  distribution  systems.  Extension  support  will  be\nthrough  provision  of  specialist  services  for  technology  transfer\nand  training  of  local  officials.  Extension  capacity  will  be\nenhanced  by  provision  of  training,  training  materials,  and  field\nstudy  tours  for  farmers  and  select  officials  to  familiarize  them\nwith suggested best practices.\n\nPrimary     -   Economic growth\nSecondary -  Poverty reduction\n\nCategory  -   B\nAn  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  of  core  subprojects\nwas  undertaken  and  the  summary  IEE  is  available  as  a\nsupplementary appendix.\n\nthe  Government  allocation \n\nMost of the irrigation systems in the lowlands along the Mekong\nRiver are pump irrigation schemes. Many have existed for over\nfive  years,  but  have  been  poorly  maintained  and  hence  do  not\nfunction  efficiently.  Irrigation  system  rehabilitation  will  allow\nin  water  management.  Because  of  budget\nimprovements \nconstraints, \nfor  operation  and\nmaintenance (O&M) is insufficient; hence, there is no systematic\nprogram  for  undertaking  O&M.  Present  water  user  groups  do\nnot  have  sufficient  technical  and  extension  support.  WUAs\nshould  be  established  within  a  proper  legal  framework  and\nfunctionaries need to be trained in administrative, financial, and\ntechnical  matters.  Simultaneously,  extension  service  support  is\nneeded to ensure adoption of appropriate cropping patterns and\nbetter agronomic practices. Without extension services, it will be\ndifficult  for  beneficiaries  to  realize  higher  incomes.  This  failure\n\nClassification\n\nEnvironmental\nAssessment\n\nRationale\n\n\fiii\n\nwill  affect  their  capacity  and  willingness  to  meet  O&M  and\nreplacement costs.\n\nGovernment support for irrigation has been refined based on the\nrecent  agricultural  sector  strategy,  and  a  new  strategic\ndevelopment plan has been adopted. The Government strategy\nis  to  transfer  irrigation  assets  to  beneficiaries  and  place\nemphasis on rehabilitation. A nationwide irrigation management\ntransfer  (IMT)  program  has  been  prepared  to  implement  this\napproach.  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry  (MAF)  was\nreorganized  and  is  now  better  coordinated  at  central  and\nprovincial  levels.  The  Department  of  Irrigation  (DOI)  has  the\ninstitutional  capacity \nis\nimplementing ongoing ADB-financed projects satisfactorily.

The  objectives  are  to\nestablish  sustainable  irrigated  agriculture  through  the  IMT\nprocess,  and  strengthen  WUAs  and  agricultural  extension.\nProject  objectives,  through  a  sector-type  project,  are  to  be\nachieved  by  (i)  assisting  irrigators  to  organize  themselves  into\nin\nWUAs; \ncooperation  with  WUAs;  (iii)  providing  appropriate  extension\nservices  to  farmers  to  help  them  make  rational  decisions;  (iv)\nenhancing  extension  capacity,  especially  at  provincial  and\ndistrict levels to support and sustain farmer-managed irrigation;\nand (v) providing institution building support to WUAs.\n\nrehabilitating  existing \n\nirrigation  systems, \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $24.2  million\nequivalent,  comprising  about  $19.0  million  (78.5  percent)  in\nforeign exchange cost and $5.2 million (21.5 percent) equivalent\nin local currency cost.\n\nADB\nAFD\nGovernment\nBeneficiaries\n\nTotal\n\n14.7\n2.6\n0.7\n1.0\n\n19.0\n\n0.8\n0.1\n1.3\n3.0\n\n5.2\n\n15.5        64\n2.7        11\n2.0          8\n4.0        17\n\n24.2      100\n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  AFD  =  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de\nDeveloppement.\n\nFinancing Plan\n\n($ million)\n\nSource\n\n     Foreign          Local          Total\n    Exchange      Currency      Cost     Percent\n\nObjectives\nand Scope\n\nCost Estimates\n\n\fLoan Amount\nand Terms\n\niv\n\nPeriod of Utilization\n\nUntil 30 June 2007\n\nImplementation\nArrangements\n\nIt is proposed that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide a\nloan  equivalent  to  SDR11,942,000  from  its  Special  Funds\nresources,  with  a  repayment  period  of  32  years,  including  a\ngrace period of 8 years, and with an interest rate of 1.0 percent\nper annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum\nthereafter.\n\nThe Executing Agency for the Project will be MAF, and DOI will\nbe the Implementing Agency. The Office of the National Project\nDirector  (ONPD)  will  have  full  authority  to  execute  the  Project,\nbut  actual  implementation  will  be  decentralized  to  provinces  to\nprovide  technical  support  and  districts  to  undertake  physical\nimplementation. The Survey, Study, and Design Center (SSDC)\nwithin DOI will be responsible for major design works requested\nby the provincial agriculture and forestry service offices and will\nhelp  them  prepare  feasibility  studies  and  detailed  designs  for\nirrigation  systems  rehabilitation.  A  project  steering  committee\nwill coordinate the Project. The committee will be chaired by the\nVice-Minister of MAF. At the provincial level a Provincial Project\nManagement Committee will be constituted, which will guide the\nProvincial Project Office. Provincial extension and training units\nthe  project\n(P-ETUs)  have  already  been  established \nprovinces.  Each  P-ETU  has  three  members,  with  skills  to\nsupervise crop production, livestock, and irrigation sections. The\nspecific  responsibilities  of  WUAs  for  maintaining  the  system,\ncollecting  fees,  and  managing  it,  particularly  with  reference  to\nthe  establishment  of  the  irrigation  service  fee  and  village\ndevelopment  fund,  and  supervisory  responsibilities  will  be\nfinalized through an agreement.\n\nin \n\nThe  goods  and  services  under  the  Project  will  be  procured  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works\nestimated  to  cost  less  than  $1.0  million  equivalent,  that  are\nunlikely  to  attract  foreign  bidders,  are  proposed  to  be  awarded\nfollowing  local  competitive  bidding  procedures.  For  civil  works\nthat exceed $1.0 million, international competitive bidding as per\nADB procedures will be followed. ONPD will procure equipment\ninternational  competitive  bidding\nand  vehicles \nprocedures  for  packages  over  $500,000  and  international\nshopping  procedures  for  packages  of  $500,000  and  less.\nPackages  costing  less  than  $100,000  will  be  procured  through\ndirect purchase.\n\nthrough \n\nExecuting Agency\n\nMinistry of Agriculture and Forestry\n\nProcurement\n\nConsulting Services\n\n167  person-months  of  international  and  224  person-months  of\ndomestic  consulting  services  will  be  required.  The  consulting\nservices will be recruited in two packages. ADB will finance one\npackage  of  85  person-months  of  international  and  84  person-\n\n\fv\n\nmonths of domestic consulting services. An international firm, in\nassociation with a domestic firm, will be recruited to provide the\nrequired  support  as  per  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of\nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  for  the  engagement  of\ndomestic  consultants  satisfactory \nto  ADB.  The  Agence\nFran\u00e7aise  de  Developpement  (AFD)  will  finance,  in  parallel,\nanother  package  of  82  person-months  of  international  and  140\nperson-months of domestic consulting services, with consultants\nrecruited as per AFD procedures.\n\nAbout  56  well-functioning  and  appropriately  trained  WUAs  will\nhave  been  established  in  as  many  irrigation  schemes  covering\nabout  10,000  ha.  The  IMT  process  will  ensure  that  WUAs  are\nfinancially self-sufficient and technically capable to carry out the\nnecessary  O&M  for  their  irrigation  systems  on  a  sustainable\nbasis. The quantified benefits from the IMT process will include\n(i) about 10 percent increase in irrigated area; (ii) 10-15 percent\nincrease in cropping intensity; (iii) 50 and 65 percent increase in\nthe  wet  and  dry  season  paddy  yields,  respectively;  and  (iv)\nadoption of high-value crops on about 20 percent of the cropped\narea.\n\nThe  proposed  Project  is  expected  to  have  a  direct  impact  on\napproximately  62,000  people  in  the  project  area.  It  has  been\nestimated that 7-31 percent of households in provinces covered\nby  the  Project  suffer  from  rice  shortages  for  2-3  months  in  a\nyear. Increased paddy yields will ensure that these shortages do\nnot occur in the beneficiary households. After the rehabilitation,\nit  may  be  possible  to  expand  the  command  area  in  many\nsubprojects  by  about  10  percent.  The  beneficiaries  of  this\nexpansion will mostly be poorer farmers in the village who have\nhitherto had no access to irrigation.\n\nThe  major  risks  are  adequate  involvement  of  beneficiaries,\ninstitutional  capacity  of  provincial  authorities,  efficiency  of  the\nextension  services  provided,  and  capacity  of  WUAs.  Unless\nincome  generation  increases  significantly,  sustainability  of  the\nsystems  cannot  be  ensured.  This  can  only  be  achieved  if  the\nGovernment  also  provides  a  suitable  policy  environment  and\nensures adequacy of inputs.\n\nEstimated Project\nCompletion Date\n\nProject Benefits\nand Beneficiaries\n\n31 December 2006\n\nRisks\n\n\f\f1.\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  a  proposed\nloan  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  for  the  Decentralized  Irrigation\nDevelopment and Management Sector Project.\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nthe \n\nirrigation  management \n\nto  beneficiaries.  Under \n\nThe Government of the Lao PDR has initiated a nationwide program to transfer irrigation\n2.\nsystems \nthe\nGovernment  has  proposed  to  fully  transfer  the  assets  and  responsibility  for  operation  and\nmaintenance (O&M) to the beneficiaries. A strategic plan for the IMT has also been finalized. To\nsupport  this  initiative,  the  Government  has  requested  assistance  from  the  Asian  Development\nBank  (ADB).  To  assist  the  Government  to  assess  the  feasibility  of  this  approach,  a  project\npreparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)1  was  implemented  between  September  1999  and\nFebruary  2000.  The  proposed  loan  for  the  Project  has  been  included  in  the  firm  program  for\n2000. The project framework is included as Appendix 1.\n\ntransfer  (IMT)  policy, \n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA.\n\nSector Description\n\n1.\n\nGeneral\n\n3.\nThe  Lao  PDR  is  a  landlocked  country  spread  over  about  236,800  square  kilometers\n(km2),  with  a  population  of  around  5.07  million.  The  population  is  broadly  classified  into  three\ngroups:  Lao  Loum,  Lao  Theung,  and  Lao  Soung.  Lao  Loum  is  the  largest  ethnic  group\nrepresenting  about  42  percent  of  the  population  and  residing  in  the  low-lying  areas  of  the\nMekong  River  and  its  major  tributaries.  Population  density  is  very  low  at  19  persons/km2,  and\nranges between 9 persons/km2 in the rural areas to 134 persons/km2 in Vientiane. About 4.15\nmillion  people  (82  percent)  live  in  rural  areas.  The  country  is  divided  into  16  provinces,  one\nspecial  region  (Xaisomboun),  and  Vientiane  Municipality.  Each  is  headed  by  a  governor,\nassisted  by  field  officials  from  central  ministries.  In  1998,  the  Government  announced  its\nintention to move toward a more decentralized form of governance in several sectors, including\nagriculture and forestry.\n\n4.\nPer capita gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated at around $281. Lack of physical\ninfrastructure  remains  a  major  constraint  to  economic  development.  The  general  economic\ndownturn in Asia in recent years has eroded the local currency and resulted in rampant inflation.\nTo address the situation, the Government initiated a series of macroeconomic policy measures\ndesigned to stabilize the kip and reduce inflation. Following the admission of the Lao PDR to the\nAssociation  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN),  considerable  potential  to  exploit  export\nmarkets has been created. This would improve with the scheduled 2005 implementation of the\nASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) under ASEAN and entry into the World Trade Organization.\n\n                                                          \n1\n\nTA 3189-LAO: Irrigation Management Transfer Project, for $650,000, approved on 27 April 1999.\n\n\f2\n\n2.\n\nEconomic Importance of Agriculture\n\n5.\nAlthough industry and services have been contributing much to GDP\u2014about 22 percent\nand 25 percent, respectively\u2014agriculture is still the largest contributor, with 53 percent share in\nGDP.  However,  agricultural  production  is  low  due  to  inefficient  practices,  such  as  lack  of  timely\nand adequate inputs like fertilizer and seed, and weak output markets. Rice is the major crop. The\nirrigated areas on the floodplains of the Mekong River and its major tributaries produce most of\nthe  marketable  rice.  Due  to  the  difficult  terrain  and  poorly  developed  internal  and  external\ntransport  system,  most  areas  away  from  the  Mekong  River  are  relatively  isolated  from  the\nlowland  areas  of  the  country.  With  a  small  population,  minimal  monetization  of  the  rural\neconomy,  and  low  demand  for  diversified  products,  the  opportunity  for  internal  market\nexpansion  is  limited.  However,  with  its  smaller  population  and  abundant  but  largely  untapped\nnatural  resources,  which  include  water  and  land,  the  country  is  in  a  position  to  produce  for\nexport to neighboring markets.\n\nAbout 95 percent of the rural population depends on income from agricultural production,\n6.\nmainly rice. Field studies undertaken at proposed subproject sites showed that more than half the\npotential beneficiaries are farmers having access to holdings less than 1.5 ha in size. Close to two\nthirds of these farmers have less than 1 ha under irrigation. Socioeconomic surveys have shown\nannual household incomes varying between KN2.5 million and KN25.0 million ($330-$3,300) per\nhousehold per year.\n\n7.\nThe Government continues to emphasize the need for food security because annual rice\nproduction remains sensitive to the weather. Emphasis is placed on a second rice crop in the dry\nseason to compensate for losses due to floods in lowlands. Simultaneously, traditional agriculture\nis  undergoing  a  process  of  change  due  to  many  external  influences  such  as  market  prices,\nimproved  seed,  fertilizer,  credit,  mechanization  and  new  technology.  Farmers  must  learn  to\neffectively increase agricultural production in a market economy by exploiting the market better and\nadopting  new  technology.  The  Government  recently  formulated  an  agriculture  sector  strategy  for\nthe  country,  with  assistance  from  ADB.  The  strategy  (para.  23)  sets  the  stage  for  more  market-\noriented  development  of  the  sector  and  emphasizes  the  need  for  increased  income-earning\nopportunities in the sector.\n\n3.\n\nIrrigation Subsector\n\n8.\nIrrigation systems in the Lao PDR are small by international standards. Only six systems\nhave a command area exceeding 1,000 ha, with the largest system covering only 4,500 ha. If\nthe  six  largest  systems  are  excluded,  the  designed  average  command  area  of  the  remaining\nsystems  is  less  than  500  ha  and,  in  many  cases,  the  actual  irrigated  area  is  far  less  than  the\ndesigned  area.  The  Department  of  Irrigation  (DOI)  reported  that,  in  1998,  there  were  about\n1,840 irrigation systems with a wet season capacity of approximately 200,000 ha. This is about\n25  percent  of  the  country\u2019s  reported  800,000  ha  of  annually  cultivated  land.  The  dry  season\nirrigated area was reported at about 98,000 ha, but the actual irrigated area may be less than\nthat officially reported.\n\n9.\nIrrigation systems on the lowland floodplains are usually supplied with water from rivers\npumped by diesel or electric pumps. A number of the pump irrigation systems on the floodplains\nwere built in the late seventies, and function with varying degrees of efficiency. Many initially used\ndiesel pumps because of the poor rural power distribution system, but the use of electric pumps is\nincreasing.  Even  now  agriculture  consumes  only  about  6  percent  of  the  total  power,  but\n\n\f3\n\nconsumption is growing at a significant rate. Major problems facing most systems are the recurrent\ncosts of electricity and the occasional cost of major repairs or rehabilitation of pumps, motors and\nswitching  gear.  After  initial  construction,  many  well-functioning  large  pump  systems  received\nadditional  technical  and  investment  support  from  external  agencies  through  projects  such  as  the\nSustainable  Irrigated  Agriculture  Project  (SIRAP).2  These  projects  have  concentrated  on  the\nestablishment of well-functioning water user associations (WUAs) as a means of promoting system\nsustainability.\n\nIn  the  mid-1990s  in  pursuance  of  a  strategy  to  improve  food  production  during  the  dry\n10.\nseason, the Government installed a large number of pontoon-mounted pumps, powered by electric\nmotors where electricity is available, or by diesel engines. In some cases, the pumps replaced old\nor unserviceable pumps at fully developed irrigation systems. Commonly, though, the pumps were\ninstalled  at  new  sites  with  only  head  works  constructed  but  no  adequate  technical  input  or\nsupervision.  Construction  of  the  distribution  infrastructure  remained  the  responsibility  of  the\nirrigators and was executed without any standard technical specification being followed and without\nadequate supervision.\n\n4.\n\nDevelopment Issues\n\na. \n\nOperation and Maintenance\n\n11.\nIrrigation  systems  in  the  Lao  PDR  suffer  from  low  levels  of  maintenance.  Farmers\nbelonging  to  the  larger  irrigation  systems  on  the  river  plains  have  relied  on  the  Government  to\nmaintain  the  infrastructure.  With  increasing  pressure  on  the  national  budget,  DOI  has  been\nallocating almost all the available budget for capital works to expand the area under irrigation to\nsatisfy  political  demands,  and  has  allocated  virtually  no  budget  for  O&M.  Funds  are  made\navailable on an ad hoc basis, or aid agencies are pressed to assist whenever repairs are of an\nurgent  nature.  As  a  result  most  of  the  systems  have  become  run  down.  To  improve  O&M,  DOI\nhas adopted the IMT approach under which assets are transferred to the beneficiaries so that they\nbear  the  cost  of  O&M.  However,  this  is  being  done  without  adequate  preparation  and  requires\ntechnical  support.  Farmers  are  beginning  to  understand  that  the  responsibility  for  irrigation\nmaintenance  lies  with  them  and  it  is  necessary  to  establish  well-functioning  WUAs  for  this\npurpose.\n\nb. \n\nAvailability and Distribution of Inputs\n\nUnder the ongoing Lao-IRRI Project, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) has\n12.\ndeveloped  sufficient  number  of  improved  varieties,  including  Lao  varieties,  which  have  been\ndisseminated in about 80 percent of the area under rice in the lowlands. While the facilities for\nseed multiplication are adequate, demand is not adequate because farmers do not understand\nthe need to periodically replace their seed material. The Government also allows import of seed.\n\n13.\nFertilizer use has become popular and about one-third is currently being made available\nthrough  a  Japanese  Government  grant,  and  distributed  by  the  Agricultural  Promotion  Bank\n(APB) as credit in kind. It is not subsidized and the Government has found this to be a useful\nmeans  of  keeping  the  prices  of  imported  fertilizer  in  check.  Private  entrepreneurs  have  also\n                                                          \n2  SIRAP  was  funded  by  the  Dutch.  Under  this  project,  a  systematic  process  for  organizing  beneficiaries  and\nenabling them to manage the assets and operation and maintenance of irrigation systems was developed and\nimplemented  in  seven  locations.  This  has  formed  the  basis  of  the  IMT  policy  of  the  Government.  SIRAP  was\nevaluated  in  detail  and  recommendations  were  made  for    wider  application  of  the  procedures.  The\nrecommendations have been incorporated in the Project.\n\n\f4\n\nbeen  licensed  to  import  and  supply  fertilizers.  Again  the  main  issue  here  is  the  inadequate\nknowledge among farmers about the efficient use of fertilizers.\n\n14.\nProviding access to financial services is integral to the Government\u2019s efforts to improve\nagricultural  productivity  and  rural  incomes.  Most  credit  for  agricultural  purposes  is  extended\nthrough APB, which was set up in 1993. Funds are generally provided by the Bank of Lao PDR\nfor various purposes and APB is also used to deliver external assistance for agricultural credit.\nA  detailed  review  of  the  rural  financial  sector  revealed  that  APB  does  not  operate  on  a  viable\nbasis and its coverage of the rural areas is inadequate. There is need to encourage the private\nsector to provide credit in the rural areas, and the Bank of Lao PDR must develop the capacity\nto train staff in rural credit functions. To address this need, technical assistance from ADB3 has\nbeen extended, which is expected to reform APB and improve its coverage and efficiency.\n\nc. \n\nExtension Support and Decentralization\n\n15. While  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry  (MAF)  provides  extension  services,  its\nefforts have not been well coordinated and have not produced the desired impact. This is mainly\nbecause  extension  was  not  fully  understood  and  was  treated  more  as  an  information\ndissemination  mechanism  rather  than  as  a  sustained  effort  to  demonstrate  and  persuade\nfarmers to use improved farming techniques. However, there is more understanding about the\nneed and methodology of providing extension service at present. Consequently, there is now an\nincreased  demand  for  staff  at  the  national,  provincial  and  district  levels  to  be  trained  in\nextension work and preparation of appropriate training and extension material. This demand is\nalso  actively  supported  by  the  Government  through  a  campaign  to  improve  the  efficiency  of\nextension  services.  The  Government  has  also  initiated  measures  to  improve  the  linkages  of\ncentral organizations with those at provincial, district, and village levels.\n\nd.\n\nBeneficiary Participation\n\n16.\nDevolving responsibility for maintaining irrigation systems to the beneficiaries generated\na need for establishing water user groups (WUGs). But the MAF Regulation of March 1997 was\nnot  sufficient  to  allow  these  groups  to  form  themselves  into  a  legally  recognizable  entity  with\nadequate  powers  for  essential  functions.  Building  the  capacity  of  formal  WUAs  will  not  only\nprovide  farmers  with  organizational  and  planning  skills  but  also  enhance  their  ability  to  interact\nwith  public  and  commercial  agencies  that  may  provide  services  to  them.  There  is  a  strong\nmovement to commercialize agriculture in the Mekong corridor, and it will be important for farmers\nto  be  prepared  to  fully  participate  in  the  burgeoning  markets  for  input  supply,  services,  sale  of\nproduce, and obtaining credit. WUAs need to be strengthened as institutions capable of providing\nmanagerial support to individual farmers.\n\ne.\n\nDevelopment Funds\n\n17.\nA  growing  recognition  that  beneficiaries  must  more  directly  share  in  the  cost  of\ndevelopment projects, even in a small way, has led to the Government\u2019s decision to establish\nvillage development funds (VDFs), as per Prime Ministerial Order 26/PM. The VDF is mainly a\ncost  recovery  mechanism  to  enable  irrigators  to  repay  a  part  of  the  costs  of  irrigation\nconstruction, improvements, or rehabilitation. The group of irrigators was targeted because they\nhave  so  far  been  the  main  beneficiaries  of  the  Government\u2019s  expenditure  at  the  village  level.\nThe guidelines for VDF have been worked out on the assumption that cost recovery should be\n\n                                                          \n3\n\nTA 3413-LAO: Rural Finance Development (TA Cluster), for $2,020,000, approved on 9 March 2000.\n\n\f5\n\nachieved in 20 years. The VDF is to be managed by a village committee specifically established\nfor the purpose. However, establishment of the VDF has not taken into account the need for a\nsystematic program of annual maintenance. The proposed amounts to be collected may not be\nadequate  to  cover  the  full  O&M  costs  and  they  are  also  not  entirely  within  the  control  of  the\ncurrent  WUGs.  No  provision  has  been  made  to  fund  replacement,  or  major  repairs,  of  capital\nitems, particularly pumps, engines/motors, and electrical equipment.\n\n5.\n\nInstitutional Framework\n\n18.\nMAF is responsible for all activities in agriculture. DOI under MAF is mainly responsible\nfor  implementing  irrigation  projects  and  supports  MAF  in  policy  formulation  with  respect  to\nirrigation  development  and  management.  MAF  has  a  reasonably  well  established  base  for\nextension  and  training  activities  through  its  18  provincial  agriculture  and  forestry  service  offices\n(PAFSOs) and 132 district agriculture and forestry service offices (DAFSOs). Every province and\ndistrict in which the Project will operate already has an office for extension and outreach to farmers.\nThe  staff  of  these  offices  have  the  potential  to  support  the  IMT  process.  The  ADB-assisted\nStrengthening  and  Restructuring  of  the  Irrigation  Development  Project  (SRIDP),4  which  was\nimplemented  from  1993  to  1998,  worked  extensively  with  DOI  and  the  provincial  irrigation\nservice (PIS) sections of PAFSOs with marked improvement in staff capacity, particularly at the\nnational level. This capacity needs to be further developed at the provincial and district levels.\nCapacity  building  for  mobilizing  WUGs  and  for  improved  extension  service  has  also  been\nundertaken to a limited extent under the Farmer Irrigated Agriculture Training Project (FIAT) and\nPilot Extension Project (PEP) with effective results (para. 30). DOI has demonstrated adequate\ncapacity  to  implement  development  projects  including  the  ongoing  ADB-financed  Community-\nManaged Irrigation Sector Project.5\n\n19.\nDuring the preparation of the Project, an institutional capacity analysis was carried out.\nSpecific  recommendations  from  the  analysis  relate  mainly  to  the  need  to  strengthen  PAFSOs\nand  DAFSOs.  A  significant  capacity  development  thrust  is  necessary,  as  well  as  a  shift  in\nperceiving client support relationships. Effective extension services that will assist farmers to make\ninformed decisions about their farming system will require a changed approach by extension staff.\nMarket  mechanisms  and  the  potential  to  develop  and  supply  to  expanding  markets  must  be\nunderstood. Extension procedures must change and outputs now focused on providing technical\nadvice  must  refocus  on  the  provision  of  advice  for  agriculture  planning  and  production,  external\ninfluences, and improved economic as well as environmentally sustainable farming systems. There\nis  a  need  to  build  on  the  work  of  FIAT  and  PEP  in  continuing  to  improve  the  capacity  at\nprovincial  level,  and  develop  the  district  capacity,  particularly  in  the  areas  of  extension  and\ntraining.\n\nThe  agricultural  sector  strategy  presents \n\n20.\nfor  organizational\nlevels.  The\narrangements  within \norganizational  arrangements  set  out  in  the  strategy  are  considered  most  effective  to  support\nagricultural and irrigation development in the Lao PDR, and the success and sustainability of the\nProject will require prompt implementation by the Government. Generally, existing staff numbers\nare sufficient in all agencies at most levels, except in the Agricultural Extension Agency (AEA).\n\nthe  provincial  and  district \n\nthe  sector,  especially  at \n\nradical  changes \n\n                                                          \n4 \n\nTA 1764-LAO: Strengthening and Restructuring Irrigation Development Project (SRIDP), for $893,000, approved\non 13 December 1993.\nLoan  1488-LAO:  Community-Managed Irrigation Sector Project,  for  $14.7  million,  approved  on  21  November\n1996.\n\n5 \n\n\f6\n\nAn increase in staff numbers in AEA and a strengthening of its role have been recommended\nunder the above strategy.\n\n6.\n\nPoverty Issues\n\n21.\nAccording to ADB\u2019s preliminary analysis of the data collected in 1997/98 under the Lao\nExpenditure  and  Consumption  Survey  (LECS  2),  46.9  percent  of  the  national  population  is\nestimated to be below the high poverty line (defined by food and nonfood consumption), while\n25.1  percent  are  estimated  to  be  below  the  food  poverty  line  (defined  as  2,100  calories  per\ncapita per day). LECS 2 further revealed that poverty is much more common in rural areas: 52.1\npercent  of  the  rural  population  fell  under  the  higher  poverty  line,  while  28.4  percent  fell  below\nthe  food  poverty  line.  It  is  also  evident  that  the  extent  of  poverty  differs  from  region  to  region\nand, again, between rural and urban areas. In the rural areas, the poverty gap6 (which measures\nthe  severity  of  poverty)  was  much  higher  in  1997/98  for  rural  areas  than  for  urban  areas.  A\ndetailed  description  of  poverty  in  the  Lao  PDR  is  in  Appendix  2.7  A  recent  joint  study  of  rural\nareas by the World Bank and the Food and Agriculture Organization noted that the severity of\npoverty is mitigated to some extent by the availability of land, good natural resource base, and\nabsence of extreme weather, that can destroy crops.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n22.\nThe 1993 Socioeconomic Development Plan set out the eight national priority programs\nthrough  which  national  development  would  be  directed.8  The  Government  also  identified  nine\nprovinces  for  priority  attention  in  terms  of  development  programs.9  The  agriculture  sector  policy\noutlined  in  June  1993  emphasizes  attention  on  (i)  food  production,  (ii)  commodity  production\nsupport,  (iii)  stabilization  or  reduction  of  slash-and-burn  cultivation,  (iv)  irrigation  development,\n(v) agriculture and forestry research, and (vi) human resources development.\n\n1.\n\nStrategic Framework\n\nThe agriculture strategy10 presented by the Government in October 1999 to aid agencies\n23.\nbuilt on the 1993 policy goals of the Socioeconomic Development Plan and the agriculture sector\npolicy.  The  new  strategy  presents  some  new  and  innovative  approaches,  but  few  of  the  policy\ngoals  and  priorities  established  during  1993  changed  substantially.  A  major  change  is  the\nintroduction of separate approaches to agricultural development in the Mekong corridor and in the\nuplands.  The  strategy  for  the  Mekong  corridor,  in  which  the  proposed  project  area  is  mostly\nlocated, is to maintain and accelerate the pace of agricultural diversification and intensification with\nincreased productivity per unit of land, improved value-added processing, and expanded marketing\nand  sales.  The  strategy  also  emphasizes  increased  private  sector  investment,  including  foreign\n\n                                                          \n6 \n\n8\n\n7 \n\nThe  poverty  gap  is  calculated  as  the  percentage  of  total  consumption  needed  to  raise  the  income  of  poor\nhouseholds up to the poverty line.\nThe  data  in  Appendix  2  is  based  on  government  publications  and  differs  from  the  preliminary  conclusions  of\nADB\u2019s assessment.\nThe  eight  programs  are  (i)  food  production,  (ii)  stabilization  and  reduction  of  shifting  cultivation,  (iii)  commercial\nproduction,  (iv)  infrastructure  development,  (v)  improved  socioeconomic  management  and  foreign  economic\nrelations, (vi) rural development, (vii) human resources development, and (viii) services development.\nThe  nine  priority  provinces  are  (i)  Vientiane  Municipality;  (ii)  Vientiane  Province;  (iii)  Borikhamxai;\n(iv) Khammouan; (v) Savannakhet; (vi) Saravane; (vii) Champassak; (viii) Attapeu; and (ix) Xieng Khouang.\n10 The  strategy  was  developed  with  ADB  technical  assistance:  TA  2883-LAO:  Agriculture Strategy Study,  for\n\n9 \n\n$600,000, approved on 30 September 1997.\n\n\f7\n\ninvestment,  and  specifically  includes  rehabilitating,  expanding,  and  intensifying  dry  season\nirrigation systems with participatory community-based management.\n\n24.\nThe devolution of responsibilities and activities to PAFSOs and DAFSOs is central to the\nagriculture strategy. An innovative approach to agricultural extension was adopted, which relies\nheavily on subject matter specialists at provincial level and generalist extension staff at district\nlevel.  The  Government  policy  for  irrigation  development  is  to  shift  away  from  large,  capital-\nintensive, government-managed schemes to small, community-managed pump schemes.\n\n2.\n\nIrrigation Sector Strategy and Plan\n\n25.\nThe Government is actively supporting irrigation sector development. The 1993 Irrigation\nDevelopment  Plan  aimed  at  increasing  rural  incomes  and  stabilizing  rice  availability  by\nexpanding  irrigated  areas  for  both  wet  and  dry  season  production,  and  to  improve  O&M  of\nexisting irrigation systems. It emphasized the need (i) for farmers and communities to participate\nfor  effective  and  sustainable  use  of  all  resources,  (ii)  for  efficient  use  of  water  for  increased\nagricultural system performance, (iii) to stop watershed degradation, and (iv) for sufficient funds for\ntimely  and  adequate  Government  support  to  the  sector  at  all  levels.  The  plan  identified  seven\npriority river plains in the nine provinces prioritized under the Socioeconomic Development Plan.11\n\nThe  national  strategy  for  irrigation  development  was  refined,  as  recommended  in  the\n26.\nnew  agriculture  sector  strategy  developed  with  ADB  assistance.  A  new  strategic  development\nplan  was  adopted  with  emphasis  on  water  resources  planning,  irrigation  technology,  irrigation\nmanagement transfer, community-managed irrigation, and training and extension. Emphasis on\ncommunity-managed  irrigation  was  reiterated  to  achieve  greater  efficiency  in  the  irrigation\nsector. The Government has approved full cost recovery for O&M and transfer of assets to the\nbeneficiaries, which will also result in transferring to them responsibility to meet capital costs. A\nnationwide IMT program has been prepared to entrust O&M responsibility to the beneficiaries.\nThe need for extension service support and greater coordination within MAF, between DOI and\nthe Department of Agriculture (DOA) has also been recognized. Delegation of responsibility to\nthe provincial level has increased the effectiveness of coordination.\n\n3.\n\nLegal Framework\n\n27.\nSeparate legislation for land, water and forest resources was adopted by the Government\nduring  1997.  Land  ownership  in  the  Lao  PDR  is  complex.  In  most  cases,  land  is  owned  by  the\nGovernment and is considered to be under community control. Individuals have the right to use\nthe land provided they use it efficiently and effectively. The Land Law (June 1997) makes it clear\nthat land is under the ownership  of  the \u201cnational community\u201d and that the State is charged with\nmanagement  in  a  coordinated  and  uniform  manner  throughout  the  country  for  allocation  to\nfamilies  and  organizations  for  effective  use.  The  Land  Law  assigns  the  responsibility  for  land\nmanagement  to  various  ministries.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  is  responsible  for  centralized\nland management through land registration, titling, and leasing. MAF is responsible for managing\nand determining different categories of agricultural land. The allocation to and right of individuals\nand organizations to use land are the responsibility of the district administrative authority through\nthe issue of land certificates. The Department of Housing and Land Management within MOF is\nsupported  by  an  ongoing  World  Bank-funded  Land  Titling  Project,  that  has  commenced  issuing\n\n                                                          \n11  The  priority  river  plains  are  (i)  Vientiane  Plain,  (ii)  Borikhamxai  Plain,  (iii)  Sebangfai  Plain,  (iv)  Sebanghiang  Plain,\n\n(v) Sedon Plain, (vi) Champassak Plain, and (vii) Attapeu Plain.\n\n\f8\n\nurban  land  titles.  The  guidelines  for  issuing  land  titles  in  rural  areas  for  both  housing  and\nagricultural uses are yet to be formulated.\n\n28.\nThe  Government  initiated  integrated  water  resources  planning  and  management  by\npromulgating the Water and Water Resources Law in October 1996, prepared the National Water\nSector  Profile  in  1998,  and  strengthened  water  sector  coordination  by  establishing  the  Water\nResources  Coordination  Committee  (WRCC)  in  February  1999.  WRCC  is  responsible  for\nformulating  policy,  strategy,  and  action  plans  in  the  water  sector,  and  for  monitoring  the\nimplementation  of  action  plans,  laws,  and  regulations  for  water  resources  management.12  With\nADB assistance the Government is preparing a draft National Water Policy and developing a legal\nframework  for  drafting  cross-sector  regulations  to  implement  the  Water  and  Water  Resources\nLaw13 (para. 43).\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n29.\nSince  1975,  many  external  agencies  have  been  involved  in  irrigation  construction  in  the\nLao PDR. They include Australian Agency for International Development, European Community,\nJapan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  Mekong  River  Commission,  Netherlands,  United\nNations  Capital  Development  Fund,  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  United\nStates  Agency  for  International  Development,  and  World  Bank.  Other  projects  that  have\nconcentrated  more  specifically  on  IMT,  agricultural  extension,  and  institutional  development  in\nrelated areas have been SIRAP, FIAT, and PEP. Appendix 3 provides additional information on\nexternal support to the irrigation subsector.\n\nSIRAP, funded by the Government of the Netherlands, was administered by the Mekong\n30.\nRiver Commission. It was implemented from 1993 to 1998 and pilot-tested a model for IMT at\nsix specific sites. Project evaluation was completed in 1999 and recommendations were made\nto  improve  the  IMT  process  for  wider  replication.  FIAT  was  funded  by  UNDP.  Under\nimplementation  since  1994,  it  is  nearing  completion.  It  focused  on  developing  procedures  for\ntraining  and  strengthening  WUAs.  It  has  enabled  MAF,  PAFSOs,  and  DAFSOs  to  acquire  the\ncapacity to organize and train these WUAs. It has developed trainers and training activities and\nmaterials  suitable  for  training  farmers.  FIAT  was  evaluated  in  1999  and  its  impact  on  the\ncapacity  of  PAFSOs  and  DAFSOs  to  undertake  training  activities  was  noted.  The  project  also\ndemonstrated  that  training  and  extension  activities  can  be  undertaken  simultaneously.  PEP,\nwhich has been under implementation since 1996, is funded by the Swiss Government. It was\ndeveloped to establish an extension network at the PAFSO and DAFSO levels, strengthen the\ncapacity  of  extension  service  staff,  and  improve  the  services  they  provide.  As  a  result,  MAF\napplied  several  measures  to  improve  extension  services  and  adopted  recommendations  for\nadministrative  reorganization.  The  design  of  the  proposed  Project  drew  substantially  on  the\nexperience  and  recommendations  of  these  projects.  It  was  also  prepared  in  close  cooperation\nwith a proposed World Bank-financed agriculture development project.\n\n31.\nADB  has  been  supporting  the  development  of  agriculture  and  the  irrigation  subsector  in\nthe  Lao  PDR  since  1975.  It  has  provided  loan  funds  for  construction  or  rehabilitation  of  larger\n                                                          \n12  ADB  assisted  the  Government  in  capacity  building  in  WRCC  to  improve  interagency  coordination  in  the  water\nsector and preparing a national water sector action plan through TA 3006-LAO: Institutional Strengthening of the\nWater Resources Coordination Committee, for $260,000, approved on 15 April 1998. The TA prepared the Water\nSector Action Plan through a participatory approach to address and prioritize cross-sector water issues such as\nthe  need  for  water  policy  development,  integrated  water  resources  management  in  river  basins,  information\nmanagement, and community awareness.\n\n13  TA 3205-LAO: Implementation of the Water Sector Action Plan, for $300,000, approved on 9 June 1999.\n\n\f9\n\nfew  schemes  were  sustainable  due \n\npumped  schemes  along  the  Mekong  and  its  major  tributaries  between  1975  and  1990.\nImplementation  of  the  schemes  demonstrated  the  technical  capability  of  DOI  in  managing  such\nconstruction.  Unfortunately, \ninadequate  O&M\narrangements,  and  many  have  since  fallen  into  disrepair.  Subsequently,  no  further  loans  were\nprovided to the irrigation subsector until 1997. The Community-Managed Irrigation Sector Project\n(footnote 5) approved in 1996 is supporting the construction of community-based irrigation in the\nprovinces  of  Houaphanh,  Xieng  Khouang,  Vientiane  and  Borikhamxai,  as  well  as  in  the\nXaisomboun  Special  Zone.  In  addition,  the  project  for  Institutional  Strengthening  of  the  WRCC\n(footnote 12) commenced in 1999 and is working to develop the implementation guidelines for the\nWater and Water Resources Act (1996).\n\nto \n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\n32.\nThe main lessons incorporated in the project design concern farmer-managed irrigation,\nwhich will only be sustainable if (i) WUAs receive sufficient training and are allowed to operate\neffectively  with  financial  management  and  all  technical  aspects  of  irrigation  operation,\nmanagement,  and  maintenance;  (ii)  farmers  understand  and  accept  that  they  are  fully\nresponsible  for  all  aspects  of  irrigation  system  operations,  management,  and  maintenance;\n(iii) physical repair/rehabilitation work is undertaken properly with adequate attention to survey,\ndesign, construction, and quality control so as to provide a system sufficient to give irrigators the\nmeans to increase production as anticipated; (iv) profit from crop production remains sufficient\nto  allow  for  cost  recovery;  and  (v)  private  sector  support  for  the  supply  of  agricultural  inputs,\nincluding reliable technical service supplies and spare parts, are available direct to farmers, at\ncompetitive market prices. Finally, to ensure sustainability, the Government has to continue to\nextend  extension  and  technical  support  to  the  systems  even  when  the  transfer  process  is\ncompleted.\n\n33.\nSIRAP developed a process for IMT based on five major steps involving two phases: the\npreparation phase and the implementation phase. The process proceeds in a linear fashion with\ncontinuous  attention  and  priority  to  (i)  WUA  development,  (ii)  crop  development  and  related\nagricultural  extension  activities,  (iii)  market  development,  (iv)  improved  access  to  and  use  of\nagricultural inputs, and (v) appropriate O&M. The SIRAP process, developed through extensive\nfield testing, has been demonstrated to be effective in establishing and strengthening WUAs to\nthe point where they are capable of managing the normal operation of the irrigation systems. In\naddition, it is necessary for the Government to strengthen the support services.\n\n34.\nA  large  body  of  lessons  from  completed  similar  ADB  projects  and  special  impact\nevaluation studies have been taken into account. The International Water Management Institute\n(IWMI)  has  undertaken  considerable  research  on  IMT  and  has  provided  a  comprehensive\nanalysis  of  the  prerequisites  to  ensure  the  success  of  this  process.  IWMI  states  that  an\nadequate  framework  for  irrigation  development  must  address  (i)  legal  issues,  (ii)  governance,\n(iii)  organization,  and  (iv)  finance.  IWMI  recognized  that  these  aspects  overlap  and  should  be\naddressed  simultaneously.  A  successful  national  framework  for  irrigation  would  consider  clear,\nsecure,  and  transferable  water  rights;  decentralized  management  organizations;  the  role  of  the\ngovernment  as  facilitator  and  regulator,  not  controller;  accountability  of  all  parties;  and  financial\nautonomy and sustainability.14\n\n                                                          \n14 \n\nIn a 1999 publication undertaken in conjunction with Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Zuzammenarbeit (GTZ) and the\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), IWMI identified and further discussed the need\nto address issues specific to IMT, to ensure that these programs are successfully implemented.\n\n\fE.\n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\n10\n\n35.\nUnder  the  recently  adopted  poverty  reduction  strategy,  broad-based  economic  growth\nwill continue to be supported if the interventions simultaneously correct policy and institutional\nweaknesses, and infrastructure investments will be directed to projects having a greater impact\non the poor. ADB's operational strategy for the Lao PDR is to place high priority on sustainable\neconomic  growth  so  as  to  raise  the  level  of  national  income.  The  strategy  also  places\nimportance on policy reform, social services, and human development to enhance the economic\nenvironment and incentive framework. ADB's priority is to support sustainable economic growth\nand  development  through  infrastructure  investments  that  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the\ndomestic economy. ADB support is directed at bringing the rural sector into the market economy\nto enable the majority of the population to take part in the process of reform and development.\nADB assistance to stabilize cultivation systems focuses on helping to provide options in the form\nof  infrastructure,  land  titling  regimes,  and  market  development.  The  Project  design  takes  into\naccount general ADB policies as well as ADB\u2019s operational strategy for the Lao PDR. It also builds\non the outputs of the series of earlier grant-funded ADB activities.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n36.\nADB  has  engaged  MAF  and  DOI  in  an  ongoing  process  of  policy  dialogue  on  sector\ndevelopment policies governing institutional, economic, and sustainability issues. Several issues\nare  directly  relevant  to  sustainability  of  the  IMT  process,  where  ADB  has  encouraged  the\nGovernment  to  adopt  specific  measures  to  further  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  sector  and\nencourage community ownership.\n\n1.\n\nSector Development Policies\n\n37.\nPrime Ministerial Order No.26/PM issued in December 1998 was to allow the full transfer\nof  all  irrigation  projects  to  community  organizations.  While  this  is  a  major  step  affecting\nnationwide  IMT,  the  order  appears  to  concentrate  more  on  the  financial  than  on  operational\nmatters  and  is  aimed  to  encourage  irrigators  repay  a  portion  of  the  costs  of  Government\ninvestment  (including  external  grant  or  loan  funding)  for  irrigation  infrastructure  through\ncontribution  to  the  VDF.  To  establish  comprehensive  enabling  regulations,  ADB  assisted  in\npreparing MAF Ministerial Regulation No. 1149/MAF, issued on 27 June 2000 which elaborates\nthe  process  to  be  adopted  under  the  IMT  program  to  ensure  its  sustainability.  Under  the  new\nMAF  regulation,  an  IMT  process  has  been  introduced  which  includes  Government  support\nmeasures both before and after transfer to beneficiaries.15\n\n2.\n\nVillage Development Fund, Irrigation Service Fees, and Cost Recovery\n\nAdequate  contributions  from  beneficiaries  to  meet  the  costs  of  maintaining  assets  and\n38.\nutilizing them to improve income levels are key to the sustainability of the IMT process. Prime\nMinisterial Order 26, 18 December 1998, allows farmers to own and manage irrigation assets.\nTo ensure adequate maintenance of the assets, it was made mandatory for WUGs to establish\na VDF. The contributions to VDF are specified in terms of kilograms (kg) of paddy and can be\n\n                                                          \n15\n\n  Under  MAF  Regulation  1149,  the  support  measures  will  take  the  following  forms:  (i)  establishment  of  a  water\nuser association development committee to assist the water user groups to become WUAs, to assist in preparing\na  rehabilitation  plan,  and  to  provide  coordination  support;  (ii)  establishment  of  a  construction  committee  to\nfacilitate  and  supervise  construction  work;  (iii)  advice  on  bank  credit;  (iv)  updated  information  on  government\npolicies  and  guidelines  and  rules;  and  (v)  training  WUAs  in  technical  aspects  including  agriculture,  finance,\nmarketing, planning, credit, agro-industry, and gender development.\n\n\f11\n\npaid  either  in  cash  or  in  kind.16  Draft  implementing  guidelines  for  VDF,  issued  along  with  the\nFinance Minister\u2019s instructions No. 0043/MOF of 1 January 1999, indicate the proportions to be\npaid  to  the  Government  and  to  be  retained  for  O&M  and  other  expenditures.  While  there  is\nadequate  legal  basis  for  establishing  and  operating  the  VDF,  it  is  necessary  to  consolidate  the\nclarifications that have been issued regarding the working arrangement for VDF. The Government\nhas agreed to do a review and issue consolidated instructions for establishing and operating the\nVDF.\n\nThe  extent  and  adequacy  of  the  VDF  collection  were  discussed  in  detail  with  the\n39.\nGovernment. It was agreed that an irrigation service fee (ISF) would be levied under the Project\nto  support  the  full  funding  of  routine  O&M  costs.  The  amount  of  ISF  will  vary  from  site  to  site\ndepending on specific needs. The WUA will set the rate of the ISF on an annual basis, with the\nassistance of the concerned DAFSO. ISF requirements are expected to range from $25 to $30\nper  ha  per  year,  depending  on  the  type  of  irrigation  system  and  its  requirements.  At  present\ncosts  and  exchange  rates,  this  would  amount  to  a  rice  contribution  of  270-325  kg\npaddy/ha/year.  ISF  takes  into  account  all  O&M  costs  and  expected  incremental  costs  on\naccount of enhanced electricity tariff.\n\n40.\nThe Government recognizes the need to ensure that WUAs have the ability to undertake\ncapital replacement also on their own. While full replacement cost is recoverable over the life of\neach  subproject,  it  may  not  be  practical  and  may  act  as  a  disincentive  to  beneficiary  farmers.\nHence,  an  approach  under  which  partial  recovery  of  capital  cost  amounting  to  about  15-20\npercent over the subproject life is combined with the obligation to meet the remaining amounts\nthrough  commercial  borrowings  at  the  time  required  was  discussed  and  agreed  to  by  the\nbeneficiaries  and  the  Government.  Village  development  committees  will  set  aside  at  least  50\npercent of the VDF collections retained within the village for this purpose and keep the amount\nin  a  separate  account  by  the  WUA.  Beginning  with  the  present  level  of  about  $14  per  ha  per\nyear  prescribed  under  the  regulations,  WUAs  will  also  progressively  increase  the  VDF\ncontributions to about $21 per ha per year by project completion.\n\n41.\nAffordability of the fees to farmers (paras. 38-40) was the subject of detailed discussions\nat  district  workshops  conducted  at  both  the  core  subproject  sites.  The  proposed  contributions\nwere discussed in terms of rationale and costs to farmers. Farmers at both sites understood the\nneed for the fees and indicated their willingness and ability to pay.\n\n3.\n\nLand Ownership\n\n42.\nThe issue of land ownership is critical to effective functioning of WUAs. A tax certificate\nin the name of the head of the household is issued for payment of the land tax and is currently\nregarded as establishing ownership. But this often results in denying the rights of women in the\nhouseholds. From a strictly legal point of view, the holders of these certificates are not vested\nwith  any  ownership  rights,  thus  creating  a  misleading  situation  for  the  farmers.  Since  the  land\n\n                                                          \n16  They amount to 150 kg/ha for gravity systems, 200 kg/ha per year for electric pump systems, and 100 kg/ha per\nyear for diesel pump systems. A portion of the contribution is to be paid to the district development fund and the\nbalance retained for O&M and other village development works. At one end of the scale, 20 percent of the funds\ncollected  for  gravity-fed  systems  is  paid  to  the  district  treasury  and  80  percent  remains  with  the  WUG.  At  the\nother end of the scale, for diesel engine pump systems, only 5 percent is paid to the district treasury while 95\npercent remains with the WUG. The VDF draft implementing guidelines note that repayments must be made until\nthe combined amount paid to the Government through VDF equals the capital cost of the irrigation system, or that for\n20 years, after which no more payments are required.\n\n\f12\n\ntitling  project  may  take  some  time  to  cover  agricultural  land,  the  issue  of  land  certificates17  is\nconsidered  essential  as  an  additional  measure  to  assure  ownership  when  the  formal\nadjudication process for issue of land titles is undertaken. Procedures to issue land certificates\nhave been clarified and they will be issued to farmers at the subproject sites in the initial stage\nof implementation.\n\n4.\n\nWater Rights\n\n43. Water resources in the Lao PDR are crucial to its economic development and the well-\nbeing  of  its  people.  ADB  has  assisted  the  Government  in  building  the  capacity  of  WRCC  to\nimprove  interagency  coordination  in  the  water  sector  and  preparing  a  national  water  sector\naction  plan.18  The  action  plan  used  a  participatory  approach  and  is  intended  to  address  and\nprioritize  cross-sector  water  issues  such  as  the  need  for  water  policy  development,  integrated\nwater  resources  management  in  river  basins,  information  management,  and  community\nawareness.  ADB  has  also  assisted  in  preparing  the  draft  National  Water  Policy  and  in\ndeveloping  a  legal  framework  to  draft  the  implementing  decree  for  the  Water  and  Water\nResources  Law.19  The  draft  Water  Policy  is  under  preparation  and  it  has  been  recommended\nthat  it  be  adopted  by  August  2001.  The  implementation  regulations  will  cover  issues  such  as\nwater  allocation,  licensing  of  water  use,  fund  for  watershed  and  water  resources  protection,\ngroundwater  use,  and  powers  and  duties  of  central  and  local  governments.  It  was\nrecommended that they be approved by the Government by August 2002.\n\n5.\n\nWater User Associations\n\nMAF  issued  Ministerial  Regulation  No.  156/AF,  11  March  1997,  for  the  establishment\n44.\nand  operation  of  WUAs.  However,  further  regulation  is  required  to  establish a legal framework\nclarifying  and  protecting  the  rights  of  individuals  and  communities  and  providing  them  with\nsufficient  authority  to  perform  O&M  and  other  management  responsibilities.  The  Government\nsubmitted  a  draft  regulation,  prepared  with  ADB  support  under  TA  3189  (footnote  1),  which\nincludes  the  recommendations  published  during  the  1999  seminar  of  international  agencies  on\nirrigation.  On  27  June  2000,  MAF  issued  Ministerial  Regulation  No.  1150/AF  improving  the\nprovisions  under  Regulation  No.  156/AF  and  in  line  with  the  proposed  draft.  Under  this  new\nregulation,  WUAs  will  exercise  the  following  functions:  (i)  own  property,  (ii)  make  and  enforce\ninternal  rules  and  regulations,  (iii)  select  authorized  representatives  without  external\ninterference, (iv) raise funds from its members as contribution to ISF and other funds, (v) open\nand  operate  bank  accounts,  (vi)  extract  water  from  a  specified  source,  and  (vii)  to  enter  into\ncontracts.  These  are  considered  essential  for  WUAs  to  function  effectively  and  develop  the\norganizational  capacity  to  sustainably  manage  the  systems.  With  additional  support  provided\nunder the Project for WUA capacity development, the WUAs are expected to function efficiently.\n\n                                                          \n17  A  land  certificate  grants  the  holder  the  right  to  use  the  land  for  a  specific  purpose  and  for  a  certain  duration,\nwithout however conferring legal ownership rights. Nevertheless, as specified in the Land Law, holders of those\ncertificates  are  granted  the  right  to  apply  for  a  title  provided  the  land  has  been  used  in  conformity  with  the\nobjectives  and  regulations  and  if  no  objection  exists.  Therefore,  the  issuance  of  a  land  certificate  may  be\nconsidered an essential initial step before a land title is issued.\n\n18  TA 3006\u2013LAO: Institutional Strengthening of Water Resources Coordination Committee, for $260,000, approved\n\non 16 April 1997.\n\n19\n\n  TA 3205\u2013LAO: Implementation of Water Sector Action Plan, for $300,000, approved on 9 June 1999.\n\n\f13\n\n6.\n\nInstitutional Development for Agricultural Extension\n\n45.\nIn  its  agricultural  sector  strategy,  the  Government  has  committed  staff  numbers  and  a\nnew approach to agricultural extension. Project success and sustainability are dependent on the\nGovernment\u2019s  implementation  of  the  strategy,  particularly  in  the  important  area  of  agricultural\nextension.  Government  commitments  under  the  strategy,  necessary  for  sustainable  project\noutputs,  include  the  reorganization  of  DAFSOs  into  the  following  three  sections:  (i) farming\nsystem  extension  workers  (FSEWs)  who  would  work  as  generalists  in  all  fields  relating  to\nagriculture;  (ii)  administration,  covering  finance  and  management  functions;  and  (iii)  technical\nsupport and supervision to manage and coordinate the movements and activities of the FSEWs.\nThe Project will require the full support of PAFSO and DAFSO in every province and district in\nwhich  it  operates.  A  fully  functioning  PAFSO  and  DAFSO  will  require  the  establishment  of  a\ncareer framework for their staffs that takes into account career management and training, and\ndefines their roles. The Government has approved these changes.\n\n7. \n\nGender Issues\n\n46.\nIt is recognized that women farmers must also be able to participate equally along with\nmen  farmers  in  meetings,  training  courses,  and  on  study  tours.  It  is  necessary  to  ensure  that\nwomen are registered as members of WUAs and can be selected for WUA, VDF, and system\nworking  team  (SWT)  committees.  To  encourage  the  full  participation  of  women  in  positions  of\nresponsibility, it was agreed that at least 20 percent of all such positions will be filled by women.\nTo  allow  women  greater  access  to  technology  transfer  and  to  enable  them  to  derive  the  full\nbenefits of the extension process, MAF has agreed to increase the number of women extension\nworkers in DAFSOs to at least 20 percent of such staff, with at least two women staff in each\nDAFSO.\n\n8.\n\nBudget for Rehabilitation\n\n47.\nMost of the budget of DOI at national and provincial levels is for construction of irrigation\ninfrastructure, in keeping with the Government\u2019s policy to increase dry season food production.\nExpenditure is incurred mainly for new construction activities, and very little provision is made\nfor  rehabilitation  or  maintenance.  The  Government\u2019s  explanation  is  that  the  assets  are\nconstructed and then handed over to beneficiaries for maintenance; hence, there is no need for\nany  maintenance  expenditure.  A  special  budget  is  sought  in  case  of  damage  due  to  natural\ncalamities.  However,  with  the  recommendation  under  the  agriculture  sector  strategy,  the\nGovernment is keen to divert increased investments to rehabilitation. The Government agreed\nthat at least 15 percent of the national as well as the provincial budgets of the project provinces\nwould  be  earmarked  for  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  of  irrigation  assets  from  2001.  This\nwould be progressively increased and reach 30 percent by project completion. The adequacy of\nthis allocation would be reviewed during the midterm review of the Project.\n\nIV.      THE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\n48.\nIrrigation systems constructed over the last two decades vary in size. While the upland\nsystems have generally relied on small diversion weirs and distribution by gravity, the majority of\nthe systems in the lowlands along the Mekong River are pump irrigation schemes. Many have\nbeen  in  existence  for  over  five  years,  but  have  been  poorly  maintained  and  hence  do  not\nfunction efficiently. The schemes established between 1996 and 1998 under the Government\u2019s\n\n\f14\n\nNational Pump Irrigation Management Program (NPIMP), are poorly designed and have not fully\nrealized their potential. A program of systematically rehabilitating existing irrigation systems with\nspecific attention to their sustainability, especially in the lowlands, will significantly improve the\nefficiency of agriculture.\n\n49.\nRegular O&M of the irrigation systems will impose a considerable burden on the budget.\nBudget constraints force the Government to allocate inadequate amounts for rehabilitation and\nO&M;  hence,  there  is  no  systematic  program  for  rehabilitation  and  O&M  of  existing  irrigation\nsystems.  Moreover,  the  available  budget  allocations  are  distributed  on  an  ad  hoc  basis.  The\nsuccessful functioning of WUAs is contingent on their legal status and the extent to which the\nbeneficiaries  fully  understand  the  role  and  functions  of  WUAs.  For  this,  adequate  preparatory\nactivities  are  needed.  These  organizations  should  be  established  within  a  proper  legal\nframework  and  functionaries  need  to  be  trained  in  administrative,  financial  and  technical\nmatters.  The  SIRAP  experience  has  demonstrated  that  beneficiaries  can  manage  the  system\nefficiently  and \nIMT  program.\nSimultaneously, extension service support is needed to ensure adoption of appropriate cropping\npatterns and better agronomic practices. Without that support, beneficiaries will find it difficult to\nrealize  higher  incomes.  Thus  their  capacity  and  willingness  to  pay  levies  for  O&M  and\nreplacement costs will be affected.\n\nis  considerable  sense  of  ownership \n\nthere \n\nthat \n\nthe \n\nin \n\nThe  Government\u2019s  strategic  emphasis  on  increasing  food  production  as  a  means  to\n50.\nreduce  poverty  is  supported  by  ADB\u2019s  Agriculture  Strategy  Study.  Irrigation  is  recognized  as\nvital  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  for  increasing  food  production,  mainly  rice.  This  is\nexpected to result in higher farm incomes in the beneficiary households, a large percentage of\nwhom are poor. Rehabilitation of irrigation assets combined with improved extension rather than\nexpansion  under  new  irrigation  schemes  as  a  means  of  increasing  agricultural  production  is\nemphasized in the agriculture sector strategy.\n\nFollowing  this,  a  new  strategic  development  plan  has  been  adopted  under  which  the\n51.\nGovernment  is  transferring  irrigation  assets  to  beneficiaries  and  emphasizing  rehabilitation.  A\nnationwide  IMT  program  has  been  prepared  to  implement  this  approach.  MAF  has  been\nreorganized and is better coordinated at central and provincial levels. The institutional capacity\nof  DOI  has  been  improved  and  it  has  demonstrated  its  institutional  capacity  to  implement  a\nsector  type  project  under  the  ongoing  ADB-financed  Community-Managed  Irrigation  Sector\nProject  (footnote  5).  A  sector  approach  will  enable  DOI  to  implement  the  IMT  program  in  six\nselect provinces that have a large concentration of pump irrigation systems.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n52.\nThe overall goal in the sector is to facilitate sustainable growth in agricultural production,\nwhich  will  result  in  (i)  overall  economic  growth  through  increased  yields  and  better  quality  of\nagricultural produce, and (ii) poverty reduction through increased agricultural income for farmers\nand employment generation for the landless. The Project aims to establish sustainable irrigated\nagriculture through the IMT process and strengthening of WUAs, agricultural extension, and the\ncapacity of DOI/PAFSO/DAFSO staff. The Project will be implemented in six provinces and will\ncover about 56 irrigation systems with a total command area of about 10,000 ha.\n\n53.\nThe Project objectives will be achieved by (i) assisting irrigators to organize themselves\nin WUAs, which will provide institutional and management support in the rehabilitation and O&M\nof irrigation systems; (ii) rehabilitating existing irrigation systems, in cooperation with WUAs, as\npart  of  the  IMT  process;  (iii)  providing  appropriate  extension  services  to  farmers  to  help  them\n\n\f15\n\nrational  decisions  concerning \n\nfarm  management  and  marketing  systems;\nmake \n(iv) increasing  the  Government capacity and enhancing the capacity of PAFSO and DAFSO, to\nsupport  and  sustain  farmer-managed  irrigation;  and  (v)  providing  institution  building  support  to\nWUAs. A sector approach will be adopted, that will provide the Government with flexibility to cover\nspecific subprojects based on the criteria agreed upon with ADB.\n\ntheir \n\n1.\n\nProject Area\n\nIn  consultation  with  MAF,  it  was  agreed  that  the  Project  would  be  implemented  in  six\n54.\nprovinces,  Borikhamxai,  Vientiane  Municipality,  Vientiane  Province,  Savannakhet,  Sayaburi  and\nLouang Phrabang, covering existing irrigation systems. Seventeen districts20 within these provinces\nwere  chosen  in  consultation  with  the  respective  PAFSOs  and  DAFSOs,  and  taking  the  total\nnumber  of  schemes  in  the  district  into  consideration.  The  procedures  adopted  to  select  the\nproposed project area are described in Appendix 4. Emphasis will be on selecting subprojects that\nwill enhance the impact on the poor. It is believed that at least a third of the beneficiaries in each\nsubproject live below the poverty line.\n\n55.\nThe  project  area  is  largely  in  the  plains  along  the  Mekong  and  its  major  tributaries.  The\ntopography  is  mainly  low  level  plains,  with  soils  derived  from  alluvial  deposits,  but  are  not  very\nfertile. Over 80 percent of the cultivable area is devoted to paddy in the wet season. Only about 12\npercent of the area has access to irrigation in the dry season, and generally grows rice as the main\ncrop. The total population of the six provinces is about 2.5 million, of whom about 45 percent live in\nrural  areas.  Farming  is  the  main  source  of  income  for  over  90  percent  of  the  population  and\naccounts for over 60 percent of the total income of households. While there is little landlessness,\naverage landholding is about 1.4 ha, which is cultivated with family labor. Rice accounts for most of\nthe agricultural production. Annual family incomes vary between KN4.0 million and KN10.0 million.\nHigher  annual  incomes  accrue  mainly  because  of  larger  landholding  and  higher  proportion  of\nnonagricultural  income  in  areas  near  larger  cities.  Infrastructure  facilities,  especially  roads,  are\ngood, ensuring market access. Electricity is also available in most of the probable subproject sites.\nHowever, provision of education and health facilities is currently inadequate.\n\n2.\n\nComponents\n\na.\n\nDevelopment of Water User Associations\n\n56.\nThe  sustainability  of  the  IMT  process  depends  entirely  on  the  capacity  of  the  WUAs  to\nassume the responsibilities associated with the process. The present WUGs are loosely knit and\ndo not understand the process, except that the O&M costs have to be paid for by the water users.\nTherefore, the Project will provide support at various levels to the WUAs\u2014in all about 56\u2014that will\nbe  established  at  each  subproject  site.  Membership  will  vary  depending  on  subproject  size,  but\nmay comprise between 50 and 100 families. The focus will be on educating and training the water\nusers about the IMT process and to develop a sense of ownership for the process. The next step\nwould  be  to  formally  establish  the  WUAs  and  then  train  them  in  administrative  responsibilities.\nThis  would  be  followed  by  technical  training  in  extension  and  O&M  activities  for  select  WUA\nofficers/members.  Support  would  also  be  extended  to  create  the  capacities  for  more  efficient\nfinancial  management  and  better  understanding  of  market  mechanisms  and  development.  This\nwould  include  support  for  streamlining  the  present  guidelines  for  establishing  VDFs,  improving\n                                                          \n20    The  17  districts  selected  are:  Pakkading,  Pakxan,  and  Thaphabat  in  Borikhamxai;  Champhon,  Xaibouri,\nSaypouthong,  and  Songkhon  in  Savannakhet;  Hatsaifong,  Pakngum,  Saythani,  and  Sikhottabong  in  Vientiane\nMunicipality;  Keoudom,  Phonhong,  Thoulakhom,  and  Viengkham  in  Vientiane  Province;  Louang  Phrabang  in\nLouang Phrabang; and Phiang in Sayaburi.\n\n\f16\n\naccess to credit from the APB or private commercial banks, and reviewing the actual working of\nVDFs.  This  would  enable  WUAs  to  acquire  the  capacity  to  collect  and  administer  VDF  and  ISF\nfunds.  Specific  support  would  also  help  develop  the  potential  among  the  WUAs  to  identify  and\nrespond to market developments, that can significantly enhance farm incomes.\n\nb.\n\nRehabilitation of Irrigation Infrastructure\n\n57.\nThis component, which receives the bulk of project funds, will support the rehabilitation of\nabout 56 irrigation systems at selected subproject sites in 17 districts. It will include repairs to the\npump  sets  and  review  of  the  appropriateness  of  the  present  design  of  the  head-works  and\ndistribution  systems.  A  survey  will  establish  the  command  area  and  identify  the  beneficiaries,\nincluding the actual extent owned by each individual. The WUAs with the technical support of the\nconcerned  PAFSO  and  DAFSO  will  assist  in  preparing  the  detailed  design  for  the  rehabilitation\nworks  and  establish  its  viability.  The  technical  parameters  including  estimated  costs  will  be\nchecked by the Survey, Study, and Design Center (SSDC) of MAF. Most rehabilitation packages\nare  expected  to  include  civil  works  in  the  nature  of  repairs  to  head-works  and  distribution\nchannels.  Repairs  to  platforms  on  which  pumps  are  mounted  are  required  in  most  cases.\nElectrical control equipment may need to be replaced. Action in parallel will establish the WUAs\nand  conduct  a  preliminary  education  package  to  ensure  stakeholder  involvement  and  sense  of\nownership  as  part  of  the  IMT  package.  The  systems  will  be  rehabilitated  to  bring  them  to\ntechnically acceptable standards with design, construction, and quality control sufficient to ensure\nan effective operating life of 15 years.\n\nc.\n\nEnhancement of Extension Capacity\n\n58.\nAn agricultural extension system is necessary to raise farmer awareness of and ability to\nuse  new  technologies.  An  effective  extension  system  will  develop  farmer  capacity  to  identify\nconstraints, try new technologies, and make decisions for ongoing improvements in production.\nThis component includes specialist services for technology transfer for more suitable cropping\npatterns, adoption of improved seed, more efficient use of fertilizer, and better water utilization.\nWUAs  will  be  assisted  in  improving  their  financial  management  and  understanding  market\ndevelopment.  Training  will  include  improved  materials  and  field  study  tours  for  farmers  to\nfamiliarize them with suggested best practices. While training is designed to enhance capacity\nat 6 PAFSOs, 17 DAFSOs, and in the 56 WUAs, the emphasis is on strengthening the district-\nlevel capacity to provide know-how and guide agronomic practices.\n\nC.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n59.\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $24.2  million  equivalent  including  interest,\ntaxes, and duties and expected contributions of participants. Of the total cost, about $19.0 million\nor  about  78.5  percent  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $5.2  million  equivalent  or  about  21.5\npercent is the local currency cost. The summary of the cost estimates is given in Table 1.

ADB funds will finance the\ncosts  of  establishing  WUAs,  rehabilitating  irrigation  infrastructure,  and  project  management\nactivities.  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  Developpement  (AFD)  will  provide,  on  a  parallel  basis,  the\nequivalent of $2.7 million to finance the costs of consultants, equipment, and materials to enhance\nextension  capacities.  The  local  financing  will  cover  part  of  the  costs  relating  to  civil  works  and\nconsulting services, but excludes customs duties and taxes. The proposed ADB loan will have a\nrepayment period of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and will carry an interest rate of\n1.0 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter. The AFD\nfinancing  will  be  a  grant.  Significant  contribution  from  beneficiaries,  estimated  to  be  about\n17 percent, is expected by way of labor for rehabilitating irrigation infrastructure. Beneficiaries are\nwilling to make this contribution to reduce the overall cost of rehabilitation. The proposed financing\nplan is in Table 2, and a financing plan by component is included as Appendix 6.\n\nTable 2:  Financing Plana\n($ million)\n\n    Foreign\n   Exchange\n\n      Local\n   Currency\n\n      Total\n      Cost\n\n   Percent\n\n14.7\n\n2.6\n0.7\n1.0\n\n19.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.1\n1.3\n3.0\n\n5.2\n\n15.5\n\n2.7\n2.0\n4.0\n\n24.2\n\n64\n\n11\n8\n17\n\n100\n\nSource\n\nADB\nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de\n  Developpement\nGovernment\nBeneficiaries\n\n      Total\n\na\n\nTotals may not tally due to rounding.\n\n\f18\n\nE.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nProject Organization\n\nThe  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project  will  be  MAF,  and  DOI  will  be  the  Implementing\n61.\nAgency. The Office of the National Project Director (ONPD), which has been established, will be\nresponsible for overall project implementation and coordination at the national level, and have full\nauthority  to  liaise  with  ADB  and  AFD.  ONPD  will  be  headed  by  the  national  project  director\n(NPD),  a  senior  DOI  staff  who  has  already  been  appointed.  The  NPD  will  be  assisted  by  a\nsenior  extension  officer  from  DOA,  who  will  be  designated  as  a  senior  extension  coordinator;\none master trainer (MT); two irrigation engineers; and other Government staff. Under the close\nguidance  and  supervision  of  ONPD,  PAFSOs  of  participating  provinces  will  be  responsible  for\nday-to-day implementation at the subproject level with assistance from DAFSOs and WUAs. The\nSSDC in DOI will be responsible for major design works requested by the PAFSOs and will help\nprepare  feasibility  studies  and  detailed  design  for  irrigation  systems  rehabilitation.  The  senior\nextension coordinator will coordinate the extension and training programs.\n\n62.\nA project steering committee (PSC) will meet quarterly during the first two years and every\nsix months thereafter to provide overall supervision and guidance. The PSC will be chaired by the\nVice-Minister of MAF, with the NPD as member/secretary. The PSC will also include the directors\nof the Departments of Planning, Irrigation and Agriculture, the head of the AEA, representatives of\nDepartment of Livestock and Fisheries, Department of Forestry, Department of Financial Policy,\nMOF,  State  Planning  Committee,  National  Audit  Office,  Committee  for  Investment  and\nCooperation,  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office,  Lao  Women's  Union  (LWU),  National  Development  Fund\nwithin MOF, and APB. The provinces will be represented by the vice governors of Savannakhet,\nBorikhamxai,  Vientiane  Province  and  Vientiane  Municipality  (as  vice  chairmen);  and  head  of\nPAFSOs  of  Louang  Phrabang  and  Sayaburi.  The  chairperson  could  invite  any  other  official  to\nattend these meetings.\n\n63.\nA  provincial  project  management  committee  (PPMC)  will  be  constituted  with  the  vice-\ngovernor  of  the  respective  provinces  as  chair  within  three  months  after  loan  effectiveness.  The\nPPMC will guide the provincial project office (PPO) to be established. The PPMC will coordinate\nthe Project at the provincial level and will include the head of PAFSO and representatives from the\nService  of  Finance,  LWU,  and  APB.  Within  three  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  a  PPO  will  be\nestablished  in  each  project  province  with  representatives  from  the  Service  of  Planning,\nAgriculture, AEA, Livestock and Fisheries and Forestry (to be assigned by the PAFSO head). An\nIMT  coordinator  from  the  Provincial  Irrigation  Service  (PIS)  in  every  province  has  already  been\nappointed and will join the PPO as manager at the provincial level and coordinator of the PPMC.\nThe  IMT  coordinator  will  be  responsible  for  all  engineering  aspects,  but  all  activities  will  be\nundertaken  with  a  high  level  of  cooperation  and  coordination  from  the  PPO  team  under  the\nguidance  of  the  PPMC.  One  person  from  the  provincial  agriculture  service  will  be  appointed  as\ndeputy manager of the PPO and will coordinate extension and training\n\n64.\nProvincial  extension  and  training  Units  (P-ETUs)  have  already  been  established  in  13\nprovinces, including all six provinces in which the Project would operate under FIAT and PEP. In\neach  PAFSO,  trained  staff  members  remain  as  the  nucleus  of  the  P-ETU,  which  consists  of\nthree persons, one from  each  of  the  crop production, livestock, and irrigation sections.  The\nP-ETU would remain as part of PAFSOs after project completion and as such would not be an\nisolated  entity  within  PAFSO.  Since  the  Project  will  also  be  involved  with  rehabilitation  work\nrequiring  higher  technical  knowledge  from  the  PIS,  it  has  been  agreed  that  one  additional\nperson from the PIS be attached to the P-ETU for the duration of the Project. It has also been\n\n\f19\n\nagreed that six DAFSO staff assigned as FSEWs be trained at the commencement of the Project\nto be assigned to DAFSOs in which subprojects are selected under each batch.\n\n2.\n\nSpecific Arrangements\n\n65.\nDOI has undertaken a preliminary screening of the potential subprojects in consultation with\nthe respective PAFSOs and has determined that (i) more than a third of the total beneficiaries in\neach subproject would be below the poverty line, and (ii) the subproject would provide irrigation to\nat least 100 ha in the wet season or 50 ha in the dry season. An initial list of candidate subprojects\nhas  been  agreed  to  with  ADB.  DOI  will  ensure  that  all  subprojects  will  meet  these  criteria.  In\nconsultation  with  stakeholders,  a  detailed  feasibility  study  has  been  completed  for  two  core\nsubprojects\u2014one  in  Nakhong  and  another  in  Chom  Thong\u2014and  the  economic  and  financial\nviability  of  the  rehabilitation  program  established.  More  than  40  percent  of  beneficiaries  at  both\nsites are poor farmers.\n\na.\n\nEstablishment of Water User Associations\n\n66.\nPAFSOs  will  first  undertake  stakeholder  consultations  at  each  subproject  site  through\nDAFSOs  to  establish  the  interest  of  community  members  in  the  rehabilitation  program  and\nacceptance  of  the  transfer  of  assets  and  O&M  responsibilities.  PAFSOs  will  also  confirm  the\nwillingness of beneficiaries to contribute labor for the rehabilitation program and the subsequent\ncost recovery procedures. Then PAFSOs will proceed to constitute the WUGs and take steps to\nestablish  WUAs  as  per  regulations.  ONPD  will  ensure  that  at  least  20  percent  of  the  office\nholders  and  committee  members  are  women.  A  transfer  agreement  will  be  executed  between\nthe  concerned  DAFSO,  PAFSO,  and  WUA  on  the  list  of  assets  transferred  and  on  the\nresponsibilities of each during the rehabilitation phase and subsequent operation of the system.\nThe agreement will set the specific responsibilities of WUAs for system maintenance, collection\nof  fees,  and  management,  particularly  with  reference  to  the  establishment  of  VDF  and  ISF\naccounts,  and  the  supervisory  responsibilities  of  PAFSO.  ONPD  will  approve  each  of  these\nagreements.  It  will  assist  in  this  process  by  developing  a  model  transfer  agreement  within  six\nmonths of loan effectiveness. In consultation with DOI, NPD will submit a report to ADB at the\nend  of  each  year  for  the  first  three  years,  confirming  the  establishment  of  WUAs  under  each\nbatch and the opening of suitable accounts for VDF and ISF. Benefit monitoring and evaluation\n(BME) reports will monitor the functioning of the WUAs and these accounts thereafter.\n\nb.\n\nRehabilitation of Irrigation Systems\n\n67.\nONPD  will  reconfirm  the  list  of  subprojects  to  be  covered  under  each  batch  in\nconsultation  with  PAFSOs  and  DAFSOs.  Detailed  surveys  will  be  undertaken  by  PIS  for  each\nsystem and detailed designs for rehabilitation will be prepared in consultation with PAFSOs. The\nengineering  designs  will  be  submitted  to  the  SSDC  for  review  and  approval.  Upon  approval,\ncost  estimates  will  be  prepared  by  PAFSO.  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  will  be\nundertaken  for  each  subproject  by  the  concerned  PAFSO.  The  IEEs  will  be  prepared  in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  Environmental  Assessment  Requirements  and\nEnvironmental  Review  Procedures  and  Procedures  for  Environmental  Impact  Assessment\nprepared  by  DOI  with  ADB  assistance  under  SRIDP.  If  necessary,  an  environmental  impact\nassessment  report  will  be  prepared.  Measures  to  mitigate  any  adverse  impact  will  be\nincorporated in the design for rehabilitation. The proposals will then be submitted to ONPD for\napproval.  The  planning,  design,  and  implementation  of  the  rehabilitation  works  will  be  carried\nout in close consultation with WUAs.\n\n\f20\n\nc.\n\nSubproject Selection Criteria\n\n68.\nNPD  will  approve  the  rehabilitation  of  irrigation  systems  provided  that  (i)  the  feasibility\nreport establishes that the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of each subproject is not less\nthan  12  percent,  (ii)  there  is  no  adverse  environmental  impact,  (iii)  at  least  one  third  of  the\nbeneficiaries  are  presently  below  the  poverty  line,  (iv)  a  WUA  has  been  established  in\naccordance with the regulation on WUAs and a transfer agreement has been executed between\nthe  WUA  and  PAFSO  concerned,  (v)  the  costs  of  rehabilitation  do  not  exceed  $1,200  per  ha,\nand  (vi)  any  expansion  designed  is  within  the  installed  pumping  capacity  and  no  additional\ncapacity  is  being  created.  NPD  will  obtain  ADB  approval  if  the  rehabilitation  cost  of  any\nsubproject  exceeds  $1.0  million.  ONPD  will  furnish  ADB  with  the  list  of  approved  subprojects\nsemiannually.\n\nd.\n\nEnhancement of Extension Capacity\n\n69.\nImplementation of this component is to be coordinated with DOA. The senior extension\ncoordinator  will  be  responsible  for  national  coordination  of  extension  and  training  activities.  A\ndeputy project manager from the provincial agriculture office will undertake these responsibilities\nat the provincial level. Though financed on a parallel basis as a grant by AFD, the consultants\nunder  this  component  will  be  recruited  to  fit  into  the  implementation  schedule.  They  will  work\nunder the overall supervision of the NPD and the team leader recruited under the ADB-financed\nconsulting service package.21 ONPD will also be responsible for  (i) coordinating and monitoring\nthe training activities of the MTs; (ii) preparing an overall training plan for the three-year training\nprogram of P-ETUs and FSEWs; (iii) preparing a general plan for extension activities for use of\nMTs  in  training  the  P-ETUs;  and  (iv)  collecting,  producing,  replicating  and  distributing  training\nmaterials.  Items (ii) and (iii) will be approved by MAF and the plan submitted to ADB. PAFSOs\nwill take steps to implement the extension activities in the selected districts in consultation with\nDAFSOs.  The  materials  for  training  farmers  will  be  provided  in  accordance  with  the  training\nprogram to be developed by each PAFSO. Similarly, PAFSO and DAFSO staff will be trained in\nconsultation with the Department of Extension in MAF.\n\n3.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n70.\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  six  years  commencing  in  2001.  The  subprojects\nwill  be  selected  in  three  batches.  For  each  batch  of  subprojects,  there  will  be  a  first  phase\n(1 year) of preparation; a second phase (1 year) of rehabilitation; and a third phase (two years)\nof  extension,  training  and  monitoring,  and  technical  support  to  ensure  that  the  system  has\nstabilized.  The \nthe  different  activities  of  beneficiary  mobilization,\nrehabilitation, transfer, and service support is indicated in Appendix 7.\n\nimplementation  of \n\n4.\n\nProcurement\n\n71.\nGoods and services to be procured with ADB financing will be packaged, procured, and\nawarded in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The plans for civil works will be\nprepared with the assistance of ADB-financed consultants in accordance with the needs of each\nsubproject.  In  view  of  the  number  and  scattered  location  of  most  civil  works  for  rehabilitating\nirrigation  schemes,  it  is  proposed  that  local  competitive  bidding  be  undertaken  among\nprequalified  contractors  in  accordance  with  Government  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  for  a\n\n                                                          \n21  Specific  understanding  on  the  deployment  and  working  of  AFD-financed  consultants  has  been  reached  in  the\n\nMOU to be concluded by AFD and ADB on parallel cofinancing arrangement.\n\n\f21\n\ncontract  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $1.0  million  equivalent.  For  contracts  costing  over  $1.0\nmillion,  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures  as  per  ADB  guidelines  will  be\nfollowed after prequalification of contractors.\n\nONPD  will  procure  equipment  and  vehicles  using  ICB  procedures  for  packages  over\n72.\n$500,000,  international  shopping  procedures  for  packages  costing  $500,000  and  less,  and\ndirect purchase for those costing less than $100,000. The NPD will have overall responsibility\nfor carrying out procurement.\n\n5.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n73.\nA  total  of  167  person-months  of  international  and  224  person-months  of  domestic\nconsulting services will support project implementation. The services will be in two packages. In\none package, ADB will finance the services of 85 person-months of international and 84 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services, for which an international firm will be recruited as per\nADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements  for  engaging  domestic\nconsultants  satisfactory  to  ADB.  AFD  will  finance  the  remaining  82  person-months  of\ninternational  and  140  person-months  of  domestic  consultants.  The  AFD  consultants  will  be\nrecruited  through  a  separate  package  as  per  AFD\u2019s  procedures,  but  their  mobilization  will  be\ncoordinated  with  the  team  leader.  The  consultants  will  work  closely  with  ONPD  and  DOI.  The\nterms of reference of the consultants are attached as Appendix 8.\n\n6.\n\nAdvance Procurement Action\n\nTo expedite project implementation, ADB approved the Government request for advance\n74.\naction  to  cover  procurement  of  goods  and  services,  including  vehicles  and  equipment,  and\nengagement of consultants. The selection is expected to advance up to the stage of evaluation\nof the technical proposals. The Government has been informed that approval of advance action\ndoes not in any way commit ADB to finance the relevant expenditures under the Project or the\nProject itself.\n\n7.\n\nAccounts, Audits, and Reports\n\n75.\nThe NPD and the managers of the PPOs will establish and maintain accounts and records\nin  such  a  manner  as  to  facilitate  identification  of  income  and  expenditures  related  for  each\nsubproject.  They  will  be  assisted  by  an  adequate  number  of  suitably  qualified  accounting  staff,\nincluding  a  financial  manager  within  ONPD.  All  accounts  and  statements  of  expenditure  and\nrevenues  for  each  subproject  will  be  audited  annually  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Audited\nproject accounts and financial statements and subproject accounts, together with the report of the\nauditor,  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  12  months  of  the  close  of  the  financial  year.  For  this\nexercise, the PPOs will provide all necessary data that ONPD will consolidate and process.\n\n76.\nMAF  will  provide  ADB  and  AFD  with  brief  monthly  progress  reports  prepared  by  ONPD.\nThe  reports  will  include  information  on  implementation  status,  current  problems,  proposed\nremedial actions, etc. as well as institutional and policy development aspects of the Project. More\ndetailed semiannual progress reports, also to be submitted to ADB and AFD, will provide specific\ninformation  about  the  substantial  physical  completion  of  subprojects  during  the  preceding  half\nyear including details of implementation, costs, BME activities, and other information reasonably\nrequested by ADB. Within three months after physical completion of the Project, MAF will submit\nto ADB and AFD a completion report with detailed information on the above matters and include\n\n\f22\n\ninformation  on  the  performance  by  the  Government  of  its  obligations,  and  an  evaluation  of\nbenefits.\n\n77.\nMOF  will  establish  an  imprest  account  with  the  Bank  of  Lao  PDR  after  loan\neffectiveness.  The  statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedures  will  be  used  for  reimbursing\neligible  expenditures  and  liquidating  advances  covered  in  the  imprest  account,  in  accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and the detailed arrangements agreed upon by ADB\nand  the  Government.  The  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  into  the  imprest  account  will  not  be\nmore than the equivalent of $200,000 and any individual payment to be reimbursed or liquidated\nunder  the  SOE  procedure  will  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of  $50,000.  Funding  arrangements\nbetween  MOF,  MAF,  and  PAFSO  will  be  covered  in  respective  agreements  to  be  reached  for\nthis purpose with each province. MAF will be responsible for all administrative and accounting\nrequirements relating to the operation and utilization of such accounts.\n\n8.\n\nMidterm Review\n\nA comprehensive midterm review, based on BME findings, will be undertaken jointly by\n78.\nthe Government, ADB, and AFD at the end of the third year of implementation. The review will\ninclude  an  assessment  of  (i)  Project  progress,  including  plans  and  designs,  beneficiary\nparticipation,  physical  works,  quality  of  rehabilitation,  and  possibility  for  modifying  the  project\nscope; (ii) future implementation plans and targets; (iii) project costs, counterpart funding, and\nallocation  of \nloan  categories;  (iv)  project  management  structure  and\nimplementation  arrangements  including  the  consulting  services  and  any  need  for  modification;\n(v)  involvement  of  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  role  of  the  private  sector;\n(vi) environmental, social, economic, and technical aspects of the Project; (vii) adequacy of the\nrehabilitation budget allocation by DOI; and (viii) compliance with loan covenants and reporting\nrequirements. Based on the midterm review, the project design will be revised, if necessary, to\nimprove implementation\n\nfunds  among \n\n9.\n\nBenefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n\n79.\nPrior  to  the  commencement  of  the  Community-Managed  Irrigation  Project  (footnote  5),\nselected staff of SSDC attended a six-week training in BME. The course was also attended by\nselected  staff  members  of  PAFSOs  from  provinces  participating  in  that  project,  including\nBorikhamxai and Vientiane. Refresher training in BME will be provided for ONPD and PAFSO\nstaff members of the provinces of Savannakhet, Louang Phrabang and Sayaburi, and Vientiane\nMunicipality.  This  training  is  essential  if  the  BME  activities  of  the  Project  are  to  be  effectively\nundertaken.\n\n80. Within  nine  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  MAF,  with  the  support  of  consultants,  will\nestablish  appropriate  mechanisms  and  procedures  for  BME.  PAFSOs  will  carry  out  BME  of\nsubprojects  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Handbook of BME  (1992).  The  initial  social,  economic,\nand  environmental  surveys  at  the  time  of  subproject  appraisal  will  provide  benchmark  data  and\ninformation  for  subsequent  BME  activities.  The  NPD,  with  the  assistance  of  the  implementation\nconsultants, will integrate BME of subprojects into that of the overall Project. Project benefits will\nbe  closely  monitored  and  compared  with  performance  targets  set  out  in  the  project  framework.\nBME  findings  will  be  examined  and  analyzed  by  the  NPD  and  reported  in  semiannual  progress\nreports.  The  results  will  be  fed  back  to  PAFSOs  and  DAFSOs  in  participating  provinces  and\ndistricts, as well as to WUAs in the subprojects. Semiannual progress reports will be finalized and\nsubmitted to ADB, AFD, and project steering committee before the end of January and July each\nyear.\n\n\f23\n\nF.\n\nThe Executing Agency\n\n81.\nMAF,  which  has  acquired  considerable  experience  with  projects  funded  by  the\nGovernment  and  external  sources,  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project.  It  has  been\nreorganized  to  provide  technical  services  by  specialized  departments  such  as  DOI  and  DOA\nand, at the same time, is capable of adequate coordination of different activities at the central\nand  provincial  levels.  DOI\u2019s  mandate  covers  all  aspects  of  irrigation  development.  Its  main\nfunctions  are  (i)  planning,  design,  and  implementation  of  irrigation  schemes;  (ii)  providing\nbackstopping  and  technical  assistance  for  O&M  of  the  completed  irrigation  systems;  and  (iii)\nflood  protection,  including  construction  and  maintenance  of  flood  control  embankments  and\ndikes. DOI is headed by a Director General. Similarly DOA, which is also headed by a Director\nGeneral,  has  responsibility  for  agricultural  inputs,  crop  diversification  and  extension.  At  the\nprovincial level, a senior irrigation engineer is part of PAFSO. The capacity of MAF, DOI, DOA,\nSSDC and PAFSOs has been assessed. The concerned staff will be provided relevant training\nto successfully implement the Project.\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironment\n\n82.\nThe Government policy for agriculture stresses the importance of the irrigation subsector\nas a means to achieve food self-sufficiency through improved production. Emphasis now is on\nthe  need  for  farmer  and  community  participation  in  operating  irrigation  schemes.  Most\nimportantly,  the  Government  policy  is  also  focusing  on  improved  water  management,  the\nsustainability  of  irrigated  agriculture  systems,  and,  related  to  the  latter,  curbing  and  reversing\nthe  trend  of  watershed  (catchment)  degradation  through  a  gradual  phasing  out  of  the\nnonsustainable slash-and-burn practice on hill slopes. Current practices in small and medium-\nscale irrigation are characterized, in general, by two constraints that could eventually undermine\nthe environmental (and socioeconomic) sustainability of the scheme. These are (i) irrational use\nof \ninadequate  disposal  of  drainage  water,  etc.;  and\n(ii) degradation  of  the  protective  vegetative  cover  in  catchment  areas,  leading  to  increased\nsediment load, destructive flash floods in the monsoon season, and water shortage during the\ndry season.\n\nirrigation  water,  overirrigation, \n\n83.\nSustainable irrigation development will have three main positive effects: (i) improvement\nin  nutritional  status,  health  and  income  of  the  farming  communities  involved;  (ii)  elimination  of\nnonsustainable, destructive, and exhaustive forms of slash-and-burn practices in the hills, with\ntheir  negative  environmental  impacts  such  as  soil  erosion,  landslides,  flooding,  biodiversity\nlosses,  etc.;  and  (iii)  improved  irrigation  water  management\u2014regular  cleaning  of  canals,  and\navoidance  of  overirrigation,  pooling,  and  waterlogging\u2014that  will  reduce  the  breeding  areas  for\nwater-related  human  disease  vectors  such  as  mosquitoes  and  rats  and  will  have  a  positive\neffect  on  human  health.  Thus,  successful  project  implementation  will  entail  more  rational\nmanagement  of  irrigation  water,  with  due  attention  given  to  the  sustainability  of  the  water\nresource, i.e., the catchment condition that dictates, to a large extent, the quantity and quality of\navailable  irrigation  water.  Expansion  of  dry  season  irrigation  and  improved  access  to  markets\ncan also induce farmers to grow less water-demanding crops, including cash crops.\n\n84. While  no  adverse  environmental  impact  is  expected  at  any  subproject  site,  subproject\nselection  criteria  include  a  condition  that  the  selected  subprojects  should  have  no  negative\n\n\f24\n\neffects  on  the  environment.22  Under  SRIDP,  based  on  ADB  environmental  requirements,  a\nchecklist of environmental issues related to irrigation development was prepared for DOI. These\ncriteria will be applied to all subprojects. The summary IEE undertaken for two pilot subprojects\nis available on file. No specific adverse impact requiring any mitigation measures is expected.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n85.\nAs  the  Project  will  rehabilitate  existing  irrigation  systems,  the  primary  beneficiaries  will\nbe farmers and farm families who have used irrigation infrastructure for some time. While most\nof  them  are  not  among  the  \u201cpoorest  of  the  poor,\u201d  a  sizable  number  still  fall  below  the  poverty\nline.  The  underemployed  and  landless  labor  within  the  village  will  also  benefit  from  the\nadditional  employment  generated  by  more  intensive  farming.  The  Project  will  substantially\nimprove water management and farming methods to provide increased areas of quality irrigation\nand higher and diversified crop yields. These measures will all have a significant positive impact\non national food self-sufficiency and the reduction of poverty.\n\nThe  Project  will  help  establish  or  strengthen  farmer  organizations  at  all  sites.  These\n86.\norganizations  will  not  only  generate  the  immediate  benefit  of  more  effective  and  cost-efficient\nuse  of  land  and  water,  but  also  provide  farmers  with  improved  means  and  ability  to  access\nservices of public and private sector agencies. They will help farmers get better access to credit,\ntheir\nmodern \nrepresentation at higher political level. Project beneficiaries will also acquire skills in agricultural\npractices, problem solving, project and financial management, and knowledge of general issues\nsuch as accountability of leadership, group formation, and commercial practices.\n\ninputs,  marketing  opportunities,  extension  services,  and  also  ensure \n\n3.\n\nGender Analysis\n\n87. Women traditionally play a major role in managing irrigation, especially in the distribution\nsystem. They are involved in all aspects of rice production and are active as behind-the-scenes\ndecision makers in the home and in the operation of WUAs. A detailed analysis of the impact of\nWUAs  reveals that  there  is  a  risk  of  women  farmers  missing  out  on  the  benefits  of  establishing\nWUAs  as  part  of  the  IMT  process.  The  only  way  of  avoiding  this  risk  is  to  encourage  active\nparticipation  of  women  farmers.  A  specific  strategy  will  be  adopted  to  increase  women  farmers\u2019\ninvolvement  and  carry  out  a  systematic  gender  development  training  and  integration  program\ngeared to selection of women farmers for responsible positions in WUAs. About 20 percent of all\nposts are expected to be occupied by women. To ensure that women have adequate access to\ntraining and extension, the Government has agreed to increase the number of women extension\nworkers in the DAFSOs. The Lao Women\u2019s Union is expected to be closely involved to counter\nthe technical bias of PAFSO and DAFSO staff. To ensure that extension and training staff have\nfull  understanding  of  the  importance  of  gender  issues,  it  has  been  agreed  that  these  staff  be\nadequately trained in these aspects.\n\n                                                          \n22  Article 13.5 of MAF Regulation No. 1149 on Full Transfer of Irrigation Systems states that WUAs have the duty to\n\nprotect the environment by minimizing the negative environmental impacts arising from their activities.\n\n\f25\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA.\n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses\n\nDetailed financial and economic analyses of two core subprojects have determined the\n88.\nfeasibility of the Project. The analysis demonstrated that the Project is financially sustainable for\nthe farmers as well as economically viable for the country. More details are in Appendix 9.\n\n1.\n\nQuantifiable Benefits\n\n89.\nBy the end of the Project, about 56 well-functioning and appropriately trained WUAs will\nhave  been  established  in  as  many  irrigation  schemes  covering  about  10,000  ha.  The\nparticipating farmers will also have received extension training to adopt modern and appropriate\ncrop  production  and  marketing  techniques  to  significantly  improve  productivity  and  incomes.\nThe IMT process will ensure that WUAs are financially self-sufficient and technically capable of\ncarrying  out  the  necessary  O&M  for  their  irrigation  systems  on  a  sustainable  basis.\nRehabilitation of each batch of proposed subprojects will be implemented over two years. During\nthe  first  year,  WUAs  will  be  established,  farmers  will  be  trained,  and the  extension  program  will\ncommence.  In  the  second  year,  detailed  design  and  rehabilitation  works  will  be  carried  out  in\nclose cooperation with the beneficiaries. It is assumed that benefits will begin to accrue in the last\nyear of the rehabilitation works. The quantified benefits from the IMT process will include (i) about\n10 percent increase in the irrigated area; (ii) 10-15 percent increase in cropping intensity; (iii) 50\nand 65 percent increase in the wet and dry season paddy yields, respectively; and (iv) adoption of\nhigh-value crops on about 20 percent of the cropped area.\n\n2.\n\nNonquantified Benefits\n\n90.\nA  wide  range  of  nonquantified  benefits  will  result  from  the  Project.  The  improved  and\nmore productive subprojects will contribute to national and local food security. Direct employment\nopportunities  will  increase  as  a  result  of  more  intensified  farming  and  increased  irrigated  area.\nIndirect employment opportunities in marketing, processing of farm products and farm services\nwill also expand. Organizations of women\u2019s groups will gradually expand their role and influence\nin  the  decision-making  process.  The  IMT  process  itself  will  strengthen  the  WUAs  by  making\nthem more sustainable in the long run. Other benefits that are not quantified but are significant will\nbe the reduced Government budget allocation for the O&M of irrigation schemes.\n\n3.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\n91.\nFarm  models  and  crop  budgets  were  generated  for  two  core  subprojects\u2014one  in\nNakhong  and  another  in  Chom  Tong.  Results  indicate  that  annual  paddy  production  would\nincrease  by  650  metric  tons  (t),  valued  at  around    $57,000.  Of  this  increase,  200  t  would  be\nrequired  for  payments  to  VDF  and  ISF.  If  the  current  population  at  the  two  sites  were  to  stay\nconstant at 580 families (3,500 people), annual paddy production per family would increase from\nabout  6.0  t  to  around  8.5  t,  an  increase  of  over  40  percent.  The  Project  is  also  expected  to\nincrease the production of other crops as well. Maize will increase by 120 t (valued at $12,500),\nand vegetables by 525 t with a value of over  $50,000. It is estimated that net farm income will\nincrease  for  farms  of  all  sizes.  Farm  models  for  both  sites  were  generated.  The  estimated\nhousehold cash flow in the with-Project scenario is shown in Appendix 9, Table A9.3. From the\nassumptions made in this study, the incremental impact on farm incomes will be significant. After\nproject implementation, the cash flow of farming households and the production base will improve;\nhence,  the  capacity  to  manage  risk  will  be  strengthened.  Farm  household  surpluses\u2014after\n\n\f26\n\npayment of IMT levies, VDF and ISF, and an allowance for continuing electricity price increases\u2014\nare well above the associated increases in production costs.\n\n92.\nThe  successful  implementation  of  the  Project  will  lead  to  the  complete  phasing  out  of\nsubsidies on O&M for the proposed 56 schemes and, to the extent the Project is replicated, for\nall  irrigation  schemes  in  the  country.  In  the  proposed  financing  approach,  it  is  envisaged  that\nfarmers will cover all costs of routine O&M and will build up a corpus to meet part of the costs of\nthe  periodic  replacement  or  repair  of  major  capital  items.  Successful  WUAs  are  expected  to\nbecome eligible for medium- and long-term loans from public and private commercial banks that\nwould enable them to raise capital for replacing equipment and further improving and expanding\ntheir  irrigation  schemes.  Farmer  payments  to  the  VDF  will  reduce  claims  on  the  Government\nbudget. As originally proposed by the Government, 20 percent of these payments would pass\nout of the village to the district development fund, and 80 percent would stay in the village and\nenable farmers to finance local initiatives, including expenses related to irrigation.\n\n4.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n93.\nEconomic  analysis  was  carried  out  for  the  two  core  subprojects.  The  estimated  EIRRs\nwere 22.6 for Nakhong and 24.0 percent for Chom Thong. The analysis includes the capital and\nsupport costs during the two-year implementation of individual subprojects and recurrent cost of\nO&M for the assumed 15-year life of the subprojects. The economic benefits were estimated in\nconstant 2000 prices and the world price numeraire was used. The economic farmgate prices of\ninternationally  traded  commodities  (rice,  maize,  and  soybean)  and  fertilizers  (urea  and\ndiammonium phosphate) were derived from the World Bank Commodity Price Projections (April\n2000) and adjusted for port handling, transportation, and processing costs. The economic price\nof crop seed was considered to be 20 percent higher than the respective commodity price.\n\n94.\nThe  sensitivity  analysis  suggests  that  a  20  percent  decrease  in  agricultural  benefits\n(yields) would reduce the EIRR to 17.3 in Nakhong and 18.7 percent in Chom Thong. Similarly,\na 20 percent increase in the rehabilitation (cash) costs would reduce the EIRR to 19.4 and 21.3,\nrespectively. A simultaneous 20 percent decrease in benefits and 20 percent increase in (cash)\ncosts would reduce the EIRR to 14.6 and 15.8 percent, respectively, for these subprojects.\n\n5.\n\nSustainability\n\n95.\nProject  sustainability  will  be  contingent  on  the  technical  support  provided  and  financial\nviability of farmers. The extent to which the Government is subsidizing the irrigation subsector is\nunclear. The budgetary situation in the Lao PDR imposes major limitations on the Government\u2019s\nsubsidy  for  O&M.  Power  is  provided  at  a  subsidized  cost  as  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  normal\npricing policy, but a process is in place to continually increase its tariff to a market price. There\nare  no  subsidies  on  fertilizer  or  seed  supply.  The  Government  subsidizes  the  subsector  to  a\nlimited  extent  by  providing  ad  hoc assistance  for  emergency  and  major  repairs  to  irrigation\ninfrastructure,  but  the  actual  allocation  for  this  assistance  is  difficult  to  determine.  It  appears\nthere are no significant distortions in the output or input markets. With improved irrigation sector\nefficiency and after IMT implementation, savings to the treasury can be expected. It may then\nbe possible to allocate more resources to technical supervision and extension service. Both will\nbe critical to the sustainability of the Project and IMT program.\n\n\fB.\n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n27\n\n96.\nThe  Project  is  aimed  at  farmers  who  make  up  over  90  percent  of  the  rural  poor  \u2013  the\nestimated  rural  poverty  line  is  KN83,000  ($11)/capita/month.23  Almost  two  thirds  of  all  farming\nhouseholds can be classified as poor and the rural poor make up 87 percent of the country\u2019s total\npoor  population.  The  proposed  Project  is  expected  to  have  a  direct  impact  on  approximately\n62,000  people  in  the  project  area.24  In  many  parts  of  the  Lao  PDR,  rice  is  insufficient  with\nshortages occurring for up to four months in a year. Households that suffer from rice shortages for\n2-3  months  in  a  year  are  between  7  and  31  percent  in  provinces  covered  by  the  Project.\nIncreased rice yields will ensure that these shortages do not occur in the beneficiary households.\nThe impact will be particularly significant in the poorer households.\n\nAfter  the  rehabilitation  in  many  subprojects,  it  may  be  possible  to  expand  the  command\n97. \narea by about 10 percent. The beneficiaries of this expansion will mostly be poorer farmers in the\nvillage who have hitherto had no access to irrigation. Improved agricultural practices are also likely\nto generate additional farm employment, thus benefiting the landless in the villages.\n\n98. \nIn the two core subproject sites at Nakhong and Chom Thong, the average landholdings of\nthe  below-average  group  of  farmers,  mostly  in  the  group  below  the  poverty  line,  are  0.7  ha  (40\npercent) and 0.3 ha (40 percent), respectively. The figures in parentheses indicate the percentage\nof the total command area owned by this group. The farm models indicate that, after the Project,\nfarmers in this category would begin to generate cash surpluses even after deductions are made\nfor  VDF  and  ISF:  $200  in  Nakhong  and  $35  in  Chom  Thong.25  Pre-  and  post-Project  income\nlevels, based on farm models for average landholdings, are given in Appendix 9.\n\nC.\n\nRisks\n\n99.\nThree principal project risks pertain to (i) implementation, (ii) realization of benefits, and (iii)\nsustainability.  Crosscutting  concerns  for  all  three  categories  are  the  level  of  motivation  and\ncapacity of farmers, the implementation capacity and adequate number of Government staff, and\nadequacy of extension services.\n\n100. Project  implementation  will  be  affected  if  there  is  no  interest  on  the  part  of  the\nbeneficiaries.  While  the  demonstration  effect  of  SIRAP  is  expected  to  make  the  beneficiaries\nkeen to accept ownership of the assets, it also means that there are greater costs to bear for\nthem. The experience with respect to collecting O&M costs in the SIRAP subprojects has been\nencouraging.  The  advantages  of  the  IMT  process  and  expected  gains  must  be  adequately\nexplained  and  the  beneficiaries  educated  and  trained  to  become  willing  to  participate  in  the\nprocess.  Close  monitoring,  technical  supervision,  support  through  assured  inputs  supply,  etc.,\nwould be necessary to build confidence. The extension support and specific institutional support\nfor the WUAs are to address these risks. Feasibility studies will be undertaken in all subprojects,\nwith  the  full  participation  of  beneficiaries,  to  establish  incentives  for  farmer  participation  during\nplanning, implementation, and routine O&M.\n\n                                                          \n23  This estimate of the rural poverty line is based on data from Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey 2 (1997).\nThese data were adjusted to March 2000 level by applying the Consumer Price Index that increased by about\n350 percent during this period. The average household has six people.\n\n24 A typical beneficiary household will have six persons farming slightly more than 1 ha, of which little less than 1  ha\n\nmay be irrigated in the wet season, and rice and alternative cash crops may be irrigated in the dry season.\n\n25 A  significant  portion  of  income  for  households  in  this  category  in  Chom  Thong  area  comes  from  off-farm\n\nemployment in Vientiane.\n\n\f28\n\nThe  institutional  capacity  of  DOI,  PAFSOs,  and  DAFSOs  is  an  equally  important  risk.\n101.\nThe management capability of DOI and PAFSOs has been carefully assessed and the project\nscope  was  determined  on  that  basis.  Project  management  support  will  be  provided  for\nsubproject  appraisal,  design  development,  training  of  extension  staff,  and  BME.  The\nGovernment  must  ensure  that  adequate  and  trained  staff,  who  have  gained  experience  under\nFIAT and PEP, are appointed in the project area. While the Government has agreed to appoint\nmore women extension staff, past experience indicates that, for personal reasons, many women\nleave  after  being  trained.  To  the  extent  possible,  this  must  be  taken  into  account  in  the\nappointment of women staff.\n\n102. Some specific measures have been incorporated to mitigate implementation risk: (i) site\nselection will be determined by technical and social considerations; (ii) survey and design will be\nundertaken  at  provincial  level  where  the  capability  exists,  but  SSDC  staff  will  be  permanently\nassigned  to  the  provinces  during  the  survey  and  design  process;  (iii)  DOI  has  developed\nstandards to be followed for survey, design, and construction; (iv) care will be taken in selecting\nprequalified  contractors,  with  selection  being  based  on  known  past  performance;  and  (v)  the\nteam  leader  of  the  project  management  team  will  be  party  to  all  decisions  on  contract\nmanagement, including matters on contractor disqualification and/or dismissal.\n\n103. Realizing the expected level of benefits is contingent on the Government being able to\nprovide  an  effective  combination  of  policy  environment,  extension  services,  and  timely  and\nadequate supply of inputs. Budget support for nonsalary recurring costs for extension support is\nessential  and  needs  to  be  maintained  after  project  completion.  The  Government  contribution\nthrough the budget to meet its share of project cost needs close monitoring. Market-determined\nprices are expected to result in higher returns to farmers. The Government needs to pursue the\nopening  up  of  export  markets.  It  must  ensure  availability  of  inputs  and  take  steps  to  allow  the\nprivate sector to supply inputs. The extension service is important to ensure that inputs are used\nefficiently. Productivity can only increase with better technology transfer relating to use of inputs.\nQuality  of  inputs  like  seeds  needs  to  be  improved.  These  are  the  specific  areas  in  which\ninstitutional strengthening activities will be directed and technical assistance provided to WUAs\nto  help  develop  market  intelligence.  The  risk  to  expectations  regarding  export  markets  is  the\npolicy environment in neighboring countries as well as comparative costs of production.\n\n104. Sustainability  of  the  IMT  process  and  efficient  agriculture  depend  primarily  on  the\nefficient  functioning  of  the  WUAs  and  their  ability  to  maintain  the  irrigation  systems,  manage\nO&M funds, and provide marketing and service support. Ways and means of effectively forming\nWUAs  and  improving  their  technical  and  managerial  capabilities  have  been  explored  during\nproject formulation and will be pursued during implementation.\n\nA.\n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nVI.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n105.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i) \n\nWithin three months after loan effectiveness, a PPMC will be established in each\nof  the  six  provinces  in  the  project  area.  The  PPMC  will  be  chaired  by  the  vice-\ngovernor  of \nthe  head  of  PAFSO  and\nrepresentatives  from  the  Service  of  Finance,  LWU,  and  APB  to  coordinate  the\nProject.\n\nthe  province  and  will  comprise \n\n\f29\n\n(ii)  Within three months after loan effectiveness, a PPO will be established in each of\nthe six provinces in the project area. The PPO will comprise representatives from\nthe Service of Planning, Agriculture, Agriculture Extension Agency, Livestock and\nFisheries  and  Forestry  (to  be  assigned  by  the  head  of  PAFSO).  An  IMT\ncoordinator from PIS will be attached to the PPO as provincial project manager\nand  one  person  from  the  Service  of  Agriculture  will  be  attached  as  a  deputy\nmanager responsible for coordinating the extension and training activities.\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n\n(vii)\n\nWithin one  year of loan effectiveness, MAF will have been reorganized and the\nstaff  redeployed  at  the  provincial  and  district  levels,  as  recommended  in  the\nagriculture strategy.\n\nThe  already  existing  P-ETUs  in  six  provinces  will  continue  during  project\nimplementation  and  remain  as  part  of  PAFSO  following  project  completion.  In\naddition, within three months after loan effectiveness, one additional person from\nthe  PIS  will  be  attached  to  the  P-ETU  in  each  province  for  the  duration  of  the\nProject.\n\nWithin  six  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  ONPD  will  prepare  a  model  transfer\nagreement,  acceptable  to  ADB,  specifying  the  responsibilities  of  DAFSO,\nPAFSO, and WUAs during the rehabilitation phase and subsequent operation of\nthe system.\n\nThe WUA will levy an ISF to fully fund the costs incurred in routine O&M of the\nirrigation  system.  The  Government  will  guide  the  WUAs  in  determining  the\namount of ISF to be levied each year so that O&M costs are fully recovered.\n\nOn  completion  of  the  rehabilitation  works,  WUAs  will  establish  a  separate\naccount for the funding of major repair or replacement of capital works such as\npumps,  motors,  electrical  equipment,  or  major  structures.  This  account  will  be\nfunded  from  a  portion  of  VDF,  the  amount  of  which  will  not  be  less  than  50\npercent of that portion of VDF that is to be retained by the Village Development\nCommittee. The amounts collected will be wholly managed by the WUAs and no\nportion  will  be  passed  to  a  higher  level.  WUAs  will  also  be  allowed  to  maintain\nthese  amounts  in  a  separate  account  with  either  the  APB  or  any  commercial\nbank, in either kip or other currencies as permitted by the Government.\n\n(viii) Within  one  year  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  a\ncomplete  review  of  the  VDF  is  undertaken  and  that  consolidated  guidelines  are\nissued by MOF.\n\n(ix)\n\nA full review of the program for rehabilitating irrigation systems and adequacy of\nbudget allocation will be undertaken before the midterm review. The Government\nhas  assured  that,  starting  2001,  15  percent  of  the  DOI  budget  for  new\nconstruction  will  be  allocated  for  rehabilitation,  and  that  the  amount  will  be\nincreased  progressively  each  year  to  reach  30  percent  by  31  December  2006.\nThe adequacy of such adjustment will be discussed with ADB during the midterm\nreview.\n\n\f30\n\n(x)\n\n(xi)\n\n(xii)\n\n(xiii)\n\nSubproject  selection  criteria  as  agreed  upon  by  the  Government  and  ADB  and\ntaking  into  account  various  social  issues  including  poverty  reduction  will  be\nadopted and applied objectively to select the subprojects in 17 districts of the six\nprovinces of the project area. All subprojects will have been selected before the\nmidterm review.\n\nStaff  trained  as  MTs  by  FIAT  and  PEP  projects  will  be  available  in  the  project\narea  as  Government-employed  counterparts  in  participating  PAFSOs  and\nDAFSOs during project implementation. In addition, during the survey and design\nstage,  SSDC  staff  undertaking  the  task  will  be  permanently  assigned  to  the\nprovinces in the project area.\n\nONPD  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  (i)  an  overall  plan  for  the  three-year\ntraining program of the P-ETU and FSEWs, and (ii) a general plan for extension\nactivities for MTs use in training the P-ETU. These plans are to be approved by\nMAF and will be submitted to ADB within 12 months after loan effectiveness.\n\nThe  Government  will  endeavor  to  direct  project  intervention  activities  to\nencourage participation of women farmers in the IMT process. For this purpose,\nspecific provision will be made for women farmers to be registered members of\nWUAs  and  to  be  appointed  in  decision-making  positions  on  committees\nassociated with irrigated agriculture, agriculture extension, and VDF. At least 20\npercent of such positions will be filled by women.\n\nB.\n\nCondition of Loan Effectiveness\n\n106.\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  conditions  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  have\nobtained  the  AFD  financing  on  terms  satisfactory  to  ADB  and  will  have  provided  ADB  with  a\ncopy of the signed agreement with AFD.\n\nVII.      RECOMMENDATION\n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\n107.\nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to\nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  11,942,000  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  for  the\nDecentralized Irrigation Development and Management Sector Project, with a term of 32 years,\nincluding  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1  percent  per\nannum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter, and such other terms and\nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement\npresented to the Board.\n\n25 October 2000\n\nTADAO

The  first  Lao  Household  Expenditure  and\nConsumption Survey (LECS 1), conducted by the Lao National Statistical Centre, identified income\nand  spending  levels  for  3,000  households  across  the  country.  The  data  were  combined  with  the\noutcomes of the Lao Social Indicators Survey (LSIS) of 1993 and analyzed in the 1995 World Bank\nReport,  Lao  PDR  Social  Development  Assessment  and  Strategy.  As  a  first  step  in  determining\npoverty, two poverty lines were identified (Table A2.1).\n\nTable A2.1: Poverty Lines, by Region and Sector, Lao PDR, 1992/93\n(KN per capita per month)\n\nRegion\n\nFood Poverty Line\n\nPoverty Line\n\nMean Consumption\nExpenditure\n\nUrban\nRural\n  7,045\n7,045\n10,449\n8,990\n  8,860\n8,860\n  9,431\n8,288\nSource: World Bank, 1995.\n\nNorth\nCenter\nSouth\nAll\n\nAverage\n7,045\n9,436\n8,860\n8,558\n\nRural\n  9,299\n12,047\n12,289\n11,145\n\nUrban\n  9,299\n13,782\n12,289\n12,526\n\nAverage\n  9,299\n12,577\n12,289\n11,472\n\nRural\n10,285\n14,520\n12,504\n12,504\n\nUrban\n16,448\n23,335\n21,762\n21,862\n\nAverage\n11,347\n17,214\n14,696\n14,696\n\nThe Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey (LECS 2) was carried out in 1997/98, and based on\nthe preliminary data, the comparable situation is shown in Table A2.2.\n\nTable A2.2: Poverty Lines, by Region and Sector, Lao PDR, 1997/98\n(KN per capita per month)\n\nRegion\n\nFood Poverty Line\n\nHigh Poverty Line\n\nNorth\nCenter\nSouth\nAll\n\nRural\n15,958\n17,159\n16,364\n16,588\n\nUrban\n15,861\n18,200\n16,364\n17,552\n\nAverage\n15,949\n17,410\n16,417\n16,749\n\nRural\n18,318\n18,318\n18,056\n18,597\n\nUrban\n18,211\n18,211\n17,983\n19,597\n\nAverage\n18,307\n19,358\n18,049\n18,764\n\nSource: National Statistical Centre, Poverty Analysis Report, 2000.

This  makes  it  necessary  to  adjust  the  poverty  line  figures  to  arrive  at  an  amount  that\nreflects the current cost of purchasing 2,100 calories per person per day. No up-to-date rural and\nurban  poverty  line  figures  are  available,  so  the  best  possible  estimate  can  be  made  only  by\nadjusting  available  for  inflation  the  figures  for  the  food  poverty  line.  The  most  recent  poverty  line\ndata  available  are  the  ones  from  LECS  2.  They  are  derived  from  data  collected  between  March\n1997 and March 1998, and the final figures reflect the changing prices over 12 months.\n\nThe prevalence and depth of poverty were calculated in the context of data from LECS 1\n3.\nand  LECS  2.  The  prevalence  of  the  different  types  or  degrees  of  poverty  was  measured  by  the\nhead  count  ratio:  the  percentage  of  individuals  whose  household  expenditures  fall  under  the\npoverty line. Depth of poverty relates to the extent income falls under the poverty line. This is the\n                                                \n1 \n\nThe data used is based on Government and World Bank documents. ADB\u2019s own analysis of poverty levels is being\nfinalized. Preliminary results are indicated in para. 21 of main text and indicates a slightly higher overall incidence of\npoverty.\n\n\f39\n\nAppendix 2, page 2\n\npoverty gap index, calculated as the percentage of total consumption needed to raise the income\nof poor households up to the poverty line.\n\n4.\nChanges  in  the  incidence  of  poverty  over  the  five-year  interval  reported  by  the  two  LECS\nexercises  are  summarized  in  Tables  A2.3  and  A2.4.  To  allow  proper  comparison,  LECS  1  data\nwere adjusted to reflect the same food item basket as that used in LECS 2.\n\nTable A2.3:  Incidence of Poverty by Region and Sector, Lao PDR, 1992/93\n\nRegion\n\nNorth\nCenter\nSouth\nAll\n\nRegion\n\nNorth\nCenter\nSouth\nAll\n\nPercentage Below\nHigh Poverty Line\nUrban\n19.8\n18.6\n10.8\n17.8\n\nAverage\n54.3\n36.6\n48.8\n44.6\n\nRural\n61.5\n44.4\n56.6\n52.9\n\nPercentage Below\nLow Poverty Line\nUrban\n10.4\n8.3\n5.5\n8.4\n\nAverage\n41.8\n22.2\n32.8\n30.5\n\nRural\n48.4\n28.3\n38.4\n37.4\n\n Source: National Statistical Centre, Poverty Analysis Report, 2000.

There  has  been  limited  progress  since,  as  the  figures  are  39\npercent  (for  the  high  poverty  line)  and  virtually  the  same  for  the  low  or  food  poverty  line,  at  30.6\npercent  in  1997/98.  In  other  words,  there  has  been  some  improvement  in  overall  poverty,  but\nextreme  poverty  has  not  changed.  The  tables  show  that  poverty  was,  and  still  is,  much  more\ncommon in rural areas than in urban areas. The rural population under the high poverty line was 53\npercent in 1992/93, and almost 44 percent in 1997/98. The rural population below the poverty line\nwas 37.4 percent in 1992/93 and 34.4 percent in 1997/98. It is clear that the extent and depth of\npoverty differ from region to region.\n\n6.\nThe  poverty  gap  figures  for  the  two  intervals  show  very  little  progress  (Tables  A2.5  and\nA2.6). The shortfall between the actual income (in cash and kind) and the level needed to be at the\nhigh or low poverty line have not changed much.

The main conclusions at this point are as follows:\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nPoverty in the Lao PDR continues to be severe and to be widespread.\nAlthough rural poverty has been reduced more significantly than urban poverty, rural\npoverty is still high.\nThe  distribution  of  poverty  over  the  provinces  is  uneven,  with  some  provinces\nhaving more than three times the percentage of poor than some others.\n\n9.\nIf the proposed Project is to have substantial impact on the reduction of poverty, it has to\nprovide  an  adequate  response  to  the  observed  socioeconomic  realities  of  the  villages  and\nhouseholds.  It  has  to  focus  on  those  constraints  that  cause  or  perpetuate  poverty.  The  most\nimportant recommendations with regard to giving due attention to the poverty dimension in design,\norganization, and execution of the envisaged program are the following:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe Project should focus on villages that have a substantial number of households\nbelow the poverty line. Including all irrigation systems in a district or province would\nnot  give  due  importance  to  poverty-related  issues.  Project  villages  should  be\nselected on the basis of estimated portions of households below the poverty line.\nAs access to land is relatively evenly distributed, the thrust of the program may be\ndirected to entire irrigation systems and agricultural production systems. The social\nand  economic  realities  of  the  villages  in  the  project  areas  do  not  show  such\npervasive  or  profound  distinctions  in  wealth,  income,  status,  or  access  that\ninterventions can or should be targeted primarily at any strictly defined category.\nThe  focus  of  the  Project  should  be  on  improving  agricultural  productivity  and\nintensity, while ensuring that land distribution does not become less egalitarian than\nit presently seems to be.\nImprovements  in  agricultural  productivity  have  proven  to  be  feasible  and  to  draw\nfarmers  interest.  Most  villages  in  the  proposed  project  areas  meet  the  basic\nrequirements  for  such  improvements  in  electricity,  road  access,  local  or  nearby\nmarkets,  basic  educational \n(though\nrudimentary), and sufficient availability of land and water.\n\nfacilities,  water  users  organizations \n\n(vi) \n\n(v)  While most of these constraining factors affect all socioeconomic categories, some\naffect  the  poorer  household  more  strongly.  It  will  be  important  to  take  such\ndifferentiation  into  account  in  the  design  and  organization  of  the  program,\nparticularly  with  regard  to  training  (as  the  poor  have  less  education),  technology\n(poor farms are less mechanized and farmers have less experience with credit), and\norganization of water users association (WUAs) (the poor may be less articulate in\npresenting their demands).\nThe poverty aspect can also be taken into account when it is technically feasible to\nexpand the area under irrigation: preference may be given to land-poor households,\nbut this is an issue to be decided with the community.\nThere  are  few  other  possible  approaches  for  increasing  rural  wealth  that  would\nreach so many households and that are likely to have a reasonably equitable effect.\n(viii)  The  Project,  apart  from  improving  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  available\nirrigation \nfactors:\ntarget \ninadequate  use  of  modern  inputs,  limited  knowledge  of  new  technologies  among\nmale and female farmers, low degree of participation in the market, underutilization\nof  irrigated  land,  and  lack  of  incentives  to  intensify  and  diversify  agricultural\nproduction.\n\nthe  other  most  constraining \n\ninfrastructure,  should \n\n(vii) \n\n\f42\n\nAppendix 2, page 5\n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\nThe  present  involvement  of  women  should  be  maintained  and  strengthened,  and\nspecial  attention  is  warranted  to  ensure  that  modernization  and  formalization  of\n(irrigated) agriculture do not sideline women. This requires a deliberate and carefully\nplanned approach to the aspect of gender.\nThe  use  of  modern  inputs,  especially  efficient  irrigation,  requires  more  and  more\neffective cooperation among farmers than has been the case in traditional farming.\nModern  farming,  with  its  much  greater  reliance  on  external  input  supply,  services\nand markets, also requires much more active and purposeful involvement of farmers\nwith  regard  to  external  suppliers,  service  providers,  and  buyers.  There  is  need  to\ndevelop  more  effective  forms  of  cooperation  among  farmers  and  to  increase  their\nindividual and collective leverage.\n\n\f43\n\nAppendix 3, page 1\n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE SECTOR\n\nA.\n\nSignificant Projects Other Than Those Funded by ADB Loan or Grant\n\nProject Name\n\nDonor or Lender\n\nLocation\n\nEstimated\nCost ($)\n\nRehabilitation of Nam Tan\nIrrigation Scheme\n\nUNDP\nUNCDF\n\n1,733,550\n3,333,400\n\nPhiang District,\nSayaburi Province\n\nSustainable Irrigated\nAgriculture Project\n(SIRAP)\n\nNetherlands through\nMRC\n\n4,080,000\n\nVientiane Municipality\nKhammouan Province\nSavannakhet Province\n\nImplementation\nPeriod\n\n1992-1997\n\n1992-1996\n\nNam Ngum Pumped\nIrrigation Project\n\nSmall-Scale Irrigation\nProject\n\nSmall-Scale Irrigation\nProject\n\nSmall-Scale Irrigation\nProject\n\nSmall-Scale Irrigation\nProject\n\nEEC\n\n6,600,000\n\nVientiane Municipality\n\n1991-1996\n\nOxfam\n\n69,034\n\nSavannakhet Province\n\n1993\n\nQuaker Service Lao\n\n166,000\n\nHouaphanh, Xiang\nKhoang and Louang\nPhrabang Provinces.\n\nOngoing since\n1979\n\nFood for the Hungry\n\n32,000\n\nHouaphanh Province\n\n1993-1996\n\nCIDSE\n\n50,000\n\nSayaburi and\nBorikhamxai Provinces\n\n1993-1997\n\nSmall-Scale Irrigation\nProject\n\nCommunity Aid\nAbroad\n\nSmall-Scale Irrigation\nProject\n\nUNDP\nUNCDF\n\nVarious\nsmall\namounts\n\nVientiane Province\nSaravane Province\nSekong Province\n\n698,860\n3,308,443\n\nOudomxai Province\nLouang Namtha\nProvince\n\n1991-1995\n\n1990-1996\n\n18,000,000\n\nVientiane Municipality\n\n1991-1994\n\n4,538,000\n\nHouaphanh\n\n1990-1996\n\n15,000,000\n\nSavannakhet\n\n1994-1996\n\n2,730,000\n\nVientiane Municipality\n\n1994-1996\n\nJICA\n\nUS\n\nJICA\n\nEEC\n\nUpland Rural\nDevelopment Project\n\nWorld Bank Loan\nAusAID Grant\n\n13,160,000\n\nVientiane Municipality\n\n1990-1998\n\nUNDP\n\n700,000\n\nAll provinces\n\n1994-2000\n\nFood Security Project\n\nIFAD/OPEC\n\n7,700,000\n\nBokeo Province\n\n1994-2002\n\nRefugee Resettlement\n\nUS/IMO; UNHCR\n\n500,000\n\nEEC\n\n8,000,000\n\nLouang Namtha\nProvince\n\nVang Vieng District,\nVientiane Province\n\n1994-2000\n\n1994-1998\n\nIrrigation Km 6\n\nLao American Irrigation\nProject\n\nIrrigation Km 35\n\nDike Protection on\nMekong River\n\nFarmer Irrigated\nAgriculture Project\n\nIntegrated Rural\nDevelopment\n\n\f44\n\nEstimated\nCost ($)\n\nAppendix 3, page 2\n\nImplementation\nPeriod\n\n1996-1999\n\nProject Name\n\nDonor or Lender\n\nLocation\n\nMicro Projects\n\nEEC\n\n12,800,000\n\nLouang Phrabang\n\n1995-2003\n\nPilot Extension Project\n\nSDC (Switzerland)\nNovartis Foundation\n\n600,000\n\nSaravane and\nChampassak\nprovinces\n\nSmall-Scale Irrigation\nProject\n\nUNDP/UNCDF\n\n3,575,805\n\nOudomxai and\nPhongsali provinces\n\n1996-2000\n\nEEC  =  European  Economic  Community  (now  European  Union),  IMO  =  International  Maritime  Organization,  JICA  =\nJapan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  MRC  =  Mekong  River  Commission,  SDC  =  Swiss  Development\nCooperation,  UNCDF  =  United  Nations  Capital  Development  Fund,  UNDP  =  United  Nations  Development\nProgramme, UNHCR = United Nations High Commission for Refugees, US = United States of America.\n\nB.\n\nADB-Supported Projects in Agriculture and Irrigation\n\nProject Name\n\nProject Number\n\nLocation\n\nEstimated\nCost ($)\n\nImplementation\nPeriod\n\nLoan Projects\n\nCommunity-Managed\nIrrigation Project\n\n1488-LAO(SF)\nwith OPEC co-\nfinancing\n\n18,700,000\n\n1997-2004\n\nVientiane, Houaphanh\nBorikhamxai, and\nXiang Khouang\nProvinces, and the\nXaisomboun Special\nZone.\n\n1688-LAO (SF)\n\n5,690,000\n\nHouaphanh Province\n\n2000-2005\n\nShifting Cultivation\nStabilization Project\n\nGrant TA Projects\n\nIrrigation Subsector\nReview\n\nNational Integrated\nAgricultural Extension and\nResearch Program\n\nStrengthening and\nRestructuring Irrigation\nDevelopment Project\n\nInstitutional Development\nand Strengthening of MAF\n\nTA 1189-LAO\n\nNational level\n\n1990\n\nTA 1765-LAO\n\nNational level\n\n1992-1993\n\nTA 1764-LAO\n\n2,245,000\n\n1993-1998\n\nNational and all\nprovinces\n\nNational and all\nprovinces\n\nNational and all\nprovinces\n\nNational and all\nprovinces\n\n(Phase 1)\n\n(Phase 2)\n\nTA 1745-LAO\n\nTA 2333-LAO\n\n597,000\n\nAgricultural Strategy Study\n\nTA 2883-LAO\n\n1994-1995\n\n1996-1997\n\n1998-1999\n\nInstitutional Strengthening\nof Water Resources\nCoordination Committee\n\nTA 3006-LAO\n\n260,000\n\nNational level\n\nOngoing\n\n\f45\n\nAppendix 3, page 3\n\nC.\n\nSignificant Projects in the Pipeline\n\n1.\n\nWorld Bank\n\n1.\nThe  World  Bank  has  included  an  agricultural  development  project  for  FY2001  in  their\nongoing  country  assistance  strategy.

It is also expected to include essential rural\ninfrastructure development. In consultation with ADB, it was proposed that this project operate\nin the provinces of Khammouan, Saravane, Champassak, and Attapeu.\n\n2.\n\nJapan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)\n\n2.\nJICA  is  presently  exploring  possible  assistance  in  designing  a  project  to  support  the\nagriculture  sector  in  the  Mekong  Basin.  This  project  is  expected  to  cover  the  provinces  of\nBorikhamxai, Khammouan, and Savannakhet. At present, the team in the field is collecting data,\nbut  it  is  understood  that  the  proposed  project  will  undertake  capacity-building  activities  with\nPAFSOs, and DAFSOs.\n\n3.\n\nSwiss Development Cooperation (SDC)\n\n3.\nSDC funded the Pilot Extension Project that operated in the provinces of Saravane and\nChampassak from 1996 to 1999. It is understood that SDC is interested in providing continued\nfunding for similar activities in the future.\n\n\f46\n\nAppendix 4, page 1\n\nSUBPROJECT SELECTION PROCEDURES\n\nA.\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.\nIn  the  course  of  the  feasibility  study,  it  was  agreed  that  the  Project  would  cover\nprovinces  with  a  minimum  of  2,000  hectares  (ha)  of  irrigated  area  in  the  dry  season.  On  this\nbasis and in consultation with the Government, it was decided that the Project would cover the\nfollowing provinces: (i) Borikhamxai, (ii) Savannakhet, (iii) Vientiane Municipality, (iv) Vientiane\nProvince, (v) Louang Phrabang, and (vi) Sayaburi.\n\n2.\nIt was recognized that a significant package of institutional and training support would be\nrequired to achieve the project objectives. It was also recognized that human resources in each\nof  the  provinces  were  limited.  Further,  it  was  considered  necessary  to  take  into  account  the\nnumber  of  potential  subproject  sites  in  each  province  to  allow  limited  human  resources  to  be\ndeployed efficiently. The proposed investment in institutional strengthening and human resource\ndevelopment  at  the  district  level  was  intended  to  have  maximum  impact.  On  this  basis,\n17 districts were identified in these provinces.1\n\nB.\n\nScreening Criteria\n\n3.\nFor any individual subproject site to be selected, its system must have a minimum irrigated\narea of 200 ha in the wet season, or 50 in the dry season. Importance was then placed on social\naspects, in particular poverty reduction in selecting the subprojects.\n\n4.\nAll  sites  initially  suggested  as  potential  subprojects  were  carefully  screened  for  social\nconcerns.    As  a  first  step,  the  following  criteria  that  considered  social  factors,  gender,  and\nviability  of  the  transfer  process  were  developed:  (i)  poverty  level  in  villages,  (ii)  community\ncapability, (iii) interest and capacity for irrigation management transfer, (iv) gender aspects, (v)\nsupportive  context,  (vi)  secure  access  to  water  and  land,  (vii)  agronomic  aspects,  and  (viii)\navailability of infrastructure.\n\nAn in-depth survey of all initially selected schemes was then organized to determine to\n5.\nwhat  extent they  meet  the  various  criteria. The survey was carried out by experienced project\nstaff  of  Farmer  Irrigated  Agriculture  Training  Project  familiar  with  local  conditions,  in  close\nconsultation with the concerned provincial agriculture and forestry service offices (PAFSOs) and\ndistrict agriculture and forestry service offices. The survey was designed to estimate the income\nof beneficiary households. It was decided not only to rely on estimated household incomes but\nalso  to  use  a  number  of  indicators  of  wealth  and  income.  It  was  recognized  that  the\nsocioeconomic  well-being  of  households  and  villages  is  not  only  expressed  in  household\nincome, but also reflected size and nature of landholdings, quantity of rice produced, household\npossessions (like radio, motorbike, TV, refrigerator), and availability of infrastructure facilities in\nthe  village  (like  health  post,  secondary  school,  all-weather  road).  In  the  final  selection,  the\npattern of socioeconomic indicators was considered: sites that scored consistently high on the\nvarious  indicators  (i.e.,  appearing  to  be  consistently  better  off  than  other  sites  in  the  survey)\nwere excluded and sites that appeared to be consistently poorer were included. The screening\n\n                                                \n1 \n\nThe  17  districts  selected  are:  Pakkading,  Pakxan,  and  Thaphabat  in  Borikhamxai;  Champon,  Xaibouri,\nSaypouthong,  and  Songkhon  in  Savannakhet;  Hatsaifong,  Pakngum,  Saythani,  and  Sikhottabong  in  Vientiane\nMunicipality;  Keoudom,  Phonhong,  Thoulakhom,  and  Viengkham  in  Vientiane  Province;  Louang  Phrabang  in\nLouang Phrabang; and Phiang in Sayaburi.\n\n\f47\n\nAppendix 4, page 2\n\nprocess  helped  to  identify  the  subprojects  that  would  benefit  a  significant  number  of  poorer\nfarmers.\n\n6.\nThe  national  project  director  (NPD)  will  approve  a  selected  subproject  provided  (i)  the\nfeasibility report establishes that the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the subproject is\nnot less than 10 percent, (ii) there is no adverse environmental impact, (iii) at least one third of the\nbeneficiaries are presently below the poverty threshold, (iv) a water user association (WUA) has\nbeen  established  in  accordance  with  Department  of  Irrigation  guidelines  and  an  agreement\nexecuted between the WUA and PAFSO concerned, (v) the costs of rehabilitation do not exceed\n$1,200/ha,  and  (vi)  any  expansion  designed  is  within  the  installed  capacity  of  the  pumps  at\npresent and no additional installed capacity is being created. The NPD will seek approval by the\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) if the rehabilitation cost of any subproject exceeds $1.0 million.\nONPD will submit the list of approvals to ADB semiannually.\n\nC.\n\nConclusion\n\nUsing the above procedures, 156 subproject sites, which generally met technical criteria in\n\n7.\nterms of size, were assessed and 56 subprojects were recommended.\n\n\fCOST ESTIMATES\n\nTable A5.1:  Expenditure Accounts, by Financier\n($'000)\n\n Item\n\n I.

The ADB-financed consultants\nwill  be  recruited  by  the  Government  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines.  The  AFD-funded\nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with procedures adopted by AFD. All consultants will\nfunction  through  the  office  of  the  national  project  director  (ONPD)  and  are  expected  to  bring\nsubstantial experience relevant to participatory irrigation development in Southeast Asia. Strong\npreference will be given to consultants with direct experience in either the Lao PDR or northeast\nThailand, and with fluency in English and either the Lao or Thai language. The total package of\nservices to be provided by a firm will comprise seven international consultants and six domestic\nconsultants  who  will  be  engaged,  over  six  years,  for  167  (international)  and  224  (domestic)\nperson-months.

Most have a command area of 80-300 hectares (ha). Initially, many had\ndiesel pumps due to the poor rural power distribution system. However, a great majority of them\nnow  have  electric  pumps.  In  addition  to  these  schemes,  over  200  new  schemes  were\nestablished after 1996 under the National Irrigation Management Program (NIMP) and pumps at\nseveral of the old schemes were replaced. Invariably, most of the schemes are in the Mekong\nRiver  plains  and  do  not  have  an  efficient  water  distribution  system.  For  their  operation  and\nmaintenance  (O&M),  the  Government  bears  a  heavy  fiscal  burden.  Under  the  Dutch-funded\nSustainable  Irrigated  Agriculture  Project  (SIRAP)  completed  in  1998,  the  concept  of  irrigation\nmanagement  transfer  (IMT)  was  pilot-tested  in  eight  such  schemes  by  establishing  well-\nfunctioning  water  users  associations  (WUAs).  The  SIRAP  experience  demonstrated  that  well-\ntrained WUAs can take over such schemes from the Government and provide for their O&M on\na sustainable basis. Under the proposed Project, IMT will result in significant fiscal savings for\nthe  Government  while  the  efficiency  of  the  schemes  will  help  increase  farm  productivity  and\nincomes of the beneficiaries.\n\n2.\nTo determine the financial and economic feasibility of this Project, two subprojects were\nselected for detailed analysis, i.e., Nakhong in Vientiane Province and Chom Thong in Vientiane\nMunicipality. Both subprojects are representative of the majority of the schemes. Paddy is the\nmain crop in both the wet and dry season. Soybean, maize, and vegetables are other crops in\nthis area. Due to its proximity to Vientiane, Chom Thong has a larger more area for vegetables\nthan for the two other crops.\n\nThe  main  source  of  farm  data  is  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)\n3.\nreport.1 The report contains detailed information on farm production, input and output markets,\nagricultural support services, and subproject development costs collected from the two sites and\nthe  concerned  line  agencies.  The  financial  and  economic  viability  of  the  subprojects  was\nassessed separately to determine the overall feasibility of the Project.\n\n1.\n\nPrice, Cost, and Other Assumptions\n\nDuring the preparation of the TA report (March 2000), the prevailing exchange rate was\n\n4.\nKN7,600. The same exchange rate was used in this analysis.\n\n5.\nThe analysis used the world price numeraire. The economic benefits were estimated in\nconstant 2000 prices. The economic farmgate prices of internationally traded commodities, i.e.,\nrice,  maize,  soybean,  urea,  and  phosphorus,  were  derived  from  the  World  Bank  Commodity\nPrice  Projections  (April  2000)  and  adjusted  for  port  handling  in  Bangkok,  transportation  to\nsubprojects  via  Vientiane,  and  processing  costs.  The  economic  price  of  crop  seed  was\n20 percent  higher  than  the  respective  commodity  prices.  Local  output  and  input  prices  were\nbased on the FY2000 prices adjusted to economic values using a standard conversion factor of\n0.90. The shadow wage rate factor (SWRF) was assessed at 77 percent of the agricultural daily\nhired labor rate. The SWRF was used only to estimate the contribution of family labor in the off-\npeak operations and to convert the financial labor costs to economic costs. The cost of family or\n\n                                                \n1\n\nTA  3189-LAO: Irrigation Management Transfer Project,  for  $650,000,  approved  on  27  April  1999.  Final  Report\nsubmitted on 4 April 2000.\n\n\f61\n\nAppendix 9, page 2\n\nhired  labor  employed  during  the  peak  seasons,  i.e.,  transplanting  and  harvesting,  was  not\nadjusted to SWRF as there was no evidence of excess labor at those times.\n\n6.\nTo date, all expenditures on these schemes were regarded as sunk costs. On average, it\nwas  assumed  that  rehabilitation  would  increase  the  irrigated  area  by  10  percent  at  each  site.\nLife  of  the  rehabilitated  subproject  was  assumed  to  be  15  years.  Without  rehabilitation,  there\nwould be a slow winding down in dry season production within the system. This was assumed to\nbe  90  percent,  80  percent,  and  70  percent  of  the  present  area  in  years  1-5,  6-10,  and  11-15,\nrespectively.  Extension  and  WUA  development  support  would  be  provided  in  full  from  Project\nstart-up  for  five  years.  Support  for  marketing  development  and  financial  services  would  be\nprovided  for  three  years  through  a  grant  from  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  Developpement  (AFD).\nTotal subproject costs, including the cost of the TA, were spread uniformly over the total area\ncovered by the Project. Cost estimates were tentative, based on initial survey work and current\nunit costs. Cost of system rehabilitation would vary from site to site, according to conditions, i.e.,\n$600/ha at Nakhong and $1,000/ha at Chom Thong. Another 20 percent cost would be borne by\nfarmers in labor and kind.\n\n7.\nIn the first year of the Project, WUAs would be established and trained, and the detailed\nengineering design prepared. In the second year, rehabilitation would be carried out while the\nextension  training  would  be  further  strengthened.  Although  there  would  be  some  impact  on\nincreased input use and higher crop yields due to extension training during the first two years,\nthe  full  benefits  from  the  Project  are  assumed  from  year  3.  Crop  yield  projections  are\nconservative and based on the realistic potential of individual crops using improved agronomic\ntechniques.  Incremental  irrigation  service  fee  (ISF)  for  O&M  would  be  phased  in  after  year  3.\nThe village development fund (VDF) would be levied from the transfer of the system at the end\nof  year  2.  The  power  tariff  would  continue  to  increase  from  the  current  KN71($0.01)/kilowatt-\nhour  (kWh)  until  the  scheduled  escalation  is  reached,  i.e.,  KN160  ($0.02)/kWh,  by  December\n2001.\n\n2.\n\nSubsidies and Tariffs\n\n8.\nFarmers receive some subsidies, particularly for power, agricultural credit, and for O&M of\nthe  schemes.  In  addition,  fertilizers  are  subsidized,  but  to  a  lesser  extent.  The  power  subsidy,\nbased  on  estimates  of  production  and  distribution  costs  of  $0.045/kWh  and  the  current  tariff  for\nirrigation of $0.0114/kWh, amounts to about 75 percent, but is being progressively reduced.2 This\nis  currently  worth  about  $30  per  typical  farmer  per  year,  and  agriculture\u2019s  share  is  less  than\n6 percent of the total power consumed in the country.\n\n9.\nThe difference between Agricultural Promotion Bank\u2019s (APB) short-term interest rates for\nlending  on  Government-sponsored  projects  and  those  for  APB  nonsponsored  lending  or  from\ncommercial banks is around 10 percent per annum. This is regarded as a subsidy to farmers and\nwould typically be worth about $7 per farmer per season. Irrigation scheme maintenance is funded\non  an  ad  hoc basis.  Generally,  recurrent  spending  on  this  item  is  small.  However,  the  capital\nexpenditure on pump schemes under the NIMP in 1996-1998 was about $30 million.\n\n10.\nThe  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  donates  around  9,000  metric  tons  (t)  of\nfertilizer  (CIF  $4.5  million)  to  the  Government  each  year\u2014this  is  about  30  percent  of  the  total\nfertilizer  consumption  in  the  country.  The  fertilizer  is  distributed  through  APB,  which  sells  it  at\n\n                                                \n2\n\nThe power tariff for irrigation is currently increasing at 3.5 percent per month. It is scheduled to increase by 125\npercent by December 2001. At that level, the subsidy will be about 53 percent.\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 9, page 3\n\ncommercial rates.  In the south, there appears to be imports of fertilizer at prices that reflect the\nsubsidies of neighboring countries.\n\n3.\n\nAgricultural Benefits\n\n11.\nThe Project will (i) organize farmers into WUAs and train them to carry out O&M of the\nschemes and adopt improved farming practices, and (ii) rehabilitate the pump stations and the\nwater  distribution  network.  The  direct  benefits  of  these  investments,  measured  as  the\nincremental net value of agricultural production, will be achieved from about 10 percent increase\nin  the  irrigated  area,  5-10  percent  increase  in  cropping  intensity,  50  percent  increase  in  wet\nseason and 65 percent increase in dry season paddy yields,3 and about 10-15 percent increase\nin  vegetable  yields.  There  would  also  be  a  switch  in  cropped  area  from  relatively  low  value\ncrops  such  as  paddy  to  higher  value  crops  like  maize  and  vegetables.  Significant  yield\nincreases will result from adoption of better seed, more and efficient use of fertilizers, and better\nfarming  and crop protection  practices. An appropriately designed and well-executed extension\ncomponent will ensure that farmers get the requisite training and are able to optimize the project\ninvestment. These expectations are realistic and are based on experiences gained from recent\npilot  projects,  i.e.,  SIRAP.  Data  for  cropping  patterns,  cropping  intensity,  area,  yield,  and\nproduction for these three sites in without- and with-Project scenarios are presented in Tables\nA9.1 and A9.2.\n\n12.\nIrrigation  efficiencies  will  also  increase  significantly.  Currently,  most  pumps  do  not\noperate at full capacity for want of minor repairs and/or lack of technical knowledge among the\nfarmers.  Most  of  the  distribution  network  is  not  properly  designed  to  carry  water  to  farm  fields\nefficiently.  A  redesigned  and  rehabilitated  distribution  network  will  considerably  improve\nirrigation efficiency as well as equity and also ensure timely availability of water at crucial stages\nof crop development. These improvements in irrigation will induce farmers to adopt better seed\nand apply more fertilizers to realize higher yields.\n\nB.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\n13.\nTo determine the financial viability of the Project, detailed farm models were prepared for\nboth  sites.  Detailed  interviews  on  input/output  parameters  with  representative  farmers  were\nundertaken at each site.4 Household size and/or cropping practices do not significantly vary, but\nlandholding patterns slightly vary.\n\n1. \n\nFeasibility Study Sites\n\n14.\nNakhong, Vientiane Province.  The site is 40 kilometers (km) north of Vientiane. The\nirrigation  system  has  150  ha  with  111  landowners  using  the  irrigated  land.  Holdings  per\nhousehold vary from 0.32 ha to 4 ha. Average farm size is about 1.5 ha. About 40 percent of the\nholdings are of that size, while 20 percent are above average.\n\n15.\nChom Thong, Vientiane Municipality. The site is around 20 km east of Vientiane, on\nthe banks of the Mekong River. The irrigation system has 250 ha, and 467 landowners use the\nirrigated land.  Holdings per household vary from 0.16 ha to 1.6 ha. Average farm size is 0.5 ha.\n\n                                                \n3\n\nThe  value  of  effective  extension  service  has  been  established  time  and  again.  The  Lao-International  Rice\nResearch Institute on-farm research has demonstrated that farmers could increase their paddy yields by 1.5 t/ha\nby adopting improved farming methods and without any additional inputs.\nThe data were compared with those in other key studies, particularly the Community-Managed Irrigation Project\n(ADB, 1996), the Agriculture Strategy Study (ADB, 1999), and the Agriculture Sector Study (ADB, 1998).\n\n4\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 9, page 4\n\nOver 40 percent of the holdings are classified in this category and another 20 percent are above\naverage.\n\n2.\n\nThe Current Situation\n\n16.\nThe typical household comprises six persons, of whom two are of school age. Farming\nsystems are currently fairly similar in both sites. Rice production is predominant in the wet and\ndry  seasons.  While  other  options  may  be  more  profitable,  in  the  current  environment  where\nwater  management  is  erratic,  fresh  produce  is  difficult  to  both  store  and  transport,  and\ncompetition  from  cheaper  imports  can  lead  to  significant  market  price  variations.  Given  this\nsituation, farmers are making rational choices by favoring rice production.\n\nSome vegetables, around 0.16 ha per household, are grown, generally adjacent to the\n17.\nirrigation  command  area.  Current  water  management  is  such  that  crop  choice  within  the\ncommand  area  is  restricted  to  rice.  Other  crops  would  drown  in  the  \u201call  or  nothing\u201d  delivery\nsystem currently in place. Rice yields per hectare are fairly constant: around 2.0 t/ha in the wet\nseason and 3.0 t/ha in the dry season. However, wet season yields are a little higher in Chom\nThong where use of improved seed allows yields of around 2.8 t/ha.\n\n18.\nTypical input use in rice production is 50 kg each of urea and diammonium phosphate\nper  ha  per  crop  season.  But  smaller  farmers  may  reduce  these  rates.  With  the  exception  of\nChom  Thong,  farmers  do  not  buy  improved  seed  frequently  enough.  Labor  for  planting  and\nharvesting is generally sufficient; however, seedbed preparation is likely to be done by contract.\nLarger  farmers  tend  to  have  their  own  machinery  such  as  a  walking  tractor.  Threshing  is  also\ndone by contract for 5 percent of the yield. Pesticides are not used and farmers currently pay\naround  $5.5  as  a  seasonal  electricity  fee  to  the  water  user  group  (WUG).  Living  costs  vary  at\nboth  sites,  but  allowance  is  made  for  milling  rice  for  home  consumption  (typically,  1.8  t  per\nhousehold),  other \nfuel  and  domestic  electricity,  housing  repair  and\nmaintenance, clothing, social obligations, school fees, and health costs. In addition, some land\ntax and sundry taxes are paid \u2013 typically around $13 per year.\n\nfood  purchases, \n\n19.\nIn Nakhong, an average household with a farm of 1.5 ha runs at a cash surplus of about\n$150  per  annum.  In  Chom  Thong,  located  closer  to  Vientiane,  off-farm  income  plays  an\nimportant  part  in  the  household  budget.  Working  capital  can  be  provided  from  cash  flow,\nhowever, smaller farmers with landholding of about 0.3 ha spend around three months in deficit\nbefore returning to surplus. Clearly, food security is not a significant problem.\n\n3.\n\nProject Financial Impact on Average Household\n\n20.\nAfter  the  rehabilitation,  two  types  of  levies,  such  as  ISF  and  VDF,  will  be  collected  to\nensure routine O&M and the long-term sustainability of the subprojects. Financial analysis, based\non the site-specific farm models, indicates that after project implementation, farmers will raise their\nincomes significantly and be able to afford the levies.\n\nISF will be established to provide full O&M funds for each irrigation system. The average\n21.\nISF  required  to  achieve  this  objective  has  been  estimated  at  $29/ha/year  (or  315  kg  of\npaddy/ha/year) at full development, considering future power tariff. However, farmers are already\npaying  around  $5.5/ha/year  to  WUG  for  power  cost.  In  addition,  they  will  contribute  around\n$5.0/ha/year  in  labor.  Thus,  the  additional  cash  cost  for  ISF  at  the  future  power  rate  will  be\n$18.5/ha/year. However, with improved irrigation efficiency, power consumption may be reduced\nby 20 percent.\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 9, page 5\n\nVDF will be levied after the IMT process is complete. The Government has established its\n22.\nrate  according  to  the  type  of  irrigation  scheme.  For  gravity,  electric  pump,  and  diesel  pump\nschemes, VDF will be levied at the rate of 200 ($18), 150 ($14), and 100 kg ($9) of paddy/ha/year,\nrespectively. For electric pumps, 80 percent of the revenue will stay with the WUA and the rest will\npass on to the district treasury. In case of diesel pumps, WUA will keep 95 percent of revenues.\nVDF is payable for a period of no more than 20 years, or until the capital costs are recovered. One\nimportant objective of the levy is to recover a portion of the sunk costs or rehabilitation costs of\nGovernment investment in irrigation schemes. The fund may be re-distributed to the wider village\ncommunity to finance small-scale village social development projects or fund emergency repairs\nto irrigation equipment.\n\n23.\nTo be able to fund these additional costs, farmers will need to make adjustments to their\nfarming  systems.  However,  such  changes  will  have  to  take  account  of  agronomic  practices,\nhousehold  labor,  market  access,  and  risk  management.  The  farming  system  will  continue  to  be\nrice based, but the area of other more profitable crops will marginally increase. These options will\nvary  according  to  location.  Farmers  in  Chom  Thong,  for  example,  will  be  able  to  expand  their\nvegetable area while those in Nakhong will expand the area of less perishable crops, i.e., maize.\nThe gross margin for irrigated paddy is $165/ha, or $1.61/person-day, that for improved irrigated\nmaize  is  $340/ha  or  $7.83/person-day.  However,  any  expected  expansion  of  other  crops  takes\ninto account the household\u2019s food security as a priority.\n\n24.\nWith improved and more reliable access to adequate flows of water, vegetable income will\nalso  increase.  Where  farmers  are  now  restricted  to  two  vegetable  crops  per  dry  season,  e.g.,\ncucumber or spring onion, they will be able to produce three crops. However, due to realities of\nmarket access, this option is assumed only for the Chom Thong site. In Nakhong, field crops, i.e.,\nmaize  or  soybeans,  are  assumed  to  be  taken  up  as  more  profitable  alternatives  to  paddy.  The\nvegetable area will increase by 65 and 150 percent in Nakhong and Chom Thong, respectively.\nPaddy yields will increase from 2.0 to 3.0 t/ha in the wet season and from 3.0 to 5 t/ha in the dry\nseason. In Chom Thong, where the use of improved seed is relatively more common, wet season\ncrop yields will increase from 3.0 to 3.5 t/ha. The incremental production of paddy will be a result\nof  improved  yields  and  a  small  increase,  around  10  percent,  in  the  irrigated  area.  But  it  will  be\npartly offset by a small increases in area under vegetable and/or field crops.\n\n25.\nBy applying these assumptions and parameters, representative farm models for both sites\nwere  generated.  Based  on  the  assumptions,  the  incremental  impact  on  farm  incomes  will  be\nsignificant. In Nakhong and Chom Thong, the incremental income of the average household will\namount to about $300 and $160 per annum, respectively. The required levies, ISF and VDF, will\namount  to  about  18  percent  and  32  percent  of  the  corresponding  incremental  incomes.  After\nproject implementation, the cash flow of farming households will improve and the production base,\nand hence capacity to manage risk, will be strengthened.\n\n26.\nSensitivity  analysis  for  both  sites  shows  that  the  impact  of  all  measured  variables  at\nhousehold  level  is  insufficient  to  cause  a  negative  annual  cash  flow.  The  variables  having  an\nimpact  on  gross  margins  are  the  price  of  rice  and  dry  season  yields.  Although  a  20  percent\nreduction  in  either  key  variable  will  significantly  reduce  net  profit,  it  does  not  result  in  either\nnegative cash flow or cash flows less than those attained  under  the without-project  scenario. In\nsummary, the analysis shows that after project implementation, farm cash flows will be sufficiently\nrobust to withstand fairly significant fluctuations without causing the farm household any financial\nstress.\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 9, page 6\n\nC.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n1.\n\nProject Benefits\n\nEconomic analysis for both sites is based on uniform assumptions, yields, and prices. The\n27.\nvariable  parameters  are  the  required  investments,  cropping  pattern,  and  the  cropped  area.  The\nselection  of  crops  and  the  number  of  vegetable  crops  per  year  are  based  on  water  availability,\nlabor availability, and on marketing realities at both sites. Only the quantifiable benefits were taken\ninto  account.  Other  benefits,  i.e.,  improved  family  nutrition,  increased  economic  activity  in  the\nvillage  as  a  result  of  improved  farm  incomes,  and  increased  employment  opportunities,  are\ndifficult to quantify and were not included in the analysis.\n\n2.\n\nEconomic Life of the Project\n\n28.\nThe overall economic life of the Project is 15 years. Field experience has shown that the\npumps, motors, and pontoon platforms of the type used in the Project can last that long or longer\nprovided  regular  O&M  is  carried  out.  The  economic  life  of  the  distribution  network,  main  and\nsecondary  canals,  and  diversion  structures  is  expected  to  be  much  longer  than  that  of  the\nassumed life. However, no residual benefits were attributed.\n\n3.\n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return\n\n29.\nThe  indicative  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  for  both  subprojects  were\nestimated to be 22.6 and 24.0 percent for Nakhong and Chom Thong, respectively (Tables A9.3\nand A9.4).\n\n4.\n\nSensitivity Analysis\n\nThe sensitivity of the subproject EIRRs to changes in key assumptions was tested using\n30.\nthe  switching  value  (SV).  The  SV  percentage  causes  the  EIRR  to  equal  the  opportunity  cost  of\ncapital assessed at 12 percent (Table A9.5).\n\nThe  sensitivity  analysis  suggests  that  a  20  percent  decrease  in  the  agricultural  benefits\n31.\n(yields) will reduce the EIRR to 17.3 and 18.7 percent in Nakhong and Chom Thong, respectively.\nSimilarly, a 20 percent increase in the rehabilitation (cash) costs will reduce the EIRR to 19.4 and\n21.3, respectively. A simultaneous 20 percent decrease in benefits and a 20 percent increase in\n(cash)  costs  will  reduce  the  EIRR  to  14.6  and  15.8  percent,  respectively.  A  one-year  delay  in\nproject  benefits  will  decrease  the  EIRR  to  19.5  percent  in  Nakhong  and  21.7  percent  in  Chom\nThong.\n\n\fTable A9.1: Cropping Pattern, Cropping Intensity, Area,
