THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nMongolia  for  the  Regional  Road  Development  and  Maintenance  Project.  The  report  also \ndescribes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  Regional  Road  Development  and \nMaintenance Project, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the TA. \n \n2.  Mongolia is a large, sparsely populated country that is highly dependent on a narrow \neconomic base. Rapid development of the mining sector brought economic growth but only limited \nemployment, the critical ingredient of inclusive economic growth. To promote inclusive economic \ngrowth and regional economic cooperation and trade, the country needs to develop and make \nsafer its regional road network and its trade and logistics infrastructure to boost agriculture, \nagribusiness, and tourism. The project will rehabilitate and enhance safety of important regional \nroad corridor sections between Ulaanbaatar and Altanbulag. To improve the sustainability of its \ntransport infrastructure, it will also help the government improve the road asset management \n(RAM) and road safety capacity. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Strategic context. Since 1991, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been a major \npartner in the improvement of Mongolia\u2019s transport network and has assisted in developing two \nmajor highway corridors linking Mongolia to the Russian Federation and the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC).1 This has brought development, jobs, and social services to those regions; and \nimproved the lives of the poor. \n \n4.  Mongolia\u2019s economy has grown rapidly, with gross domestic product increasing more than \n720% from $1.27 billion in 2001 to $10.41 billion in 2011. However, gross domestic product growth \nfell from 17.3% in 2011 to 5.1% in 2017 because of plummeting foreign direct investment, falling \ncommodity prices, and moderating growth in the PRC. Mongolia urgently needs to restore \nmacroeconomic stability in the short term and to develop a more resilient and diversified economy \nthat  can  deliver  rapid,  inclusive,  and  sustainable  growth  in  the  long  term.  This  requires \ninfrastructure  investments  and  regional  integration  to  improve  connectivity  and  access  to \ndomestic and external markets.2 \n \n5.  Mongolia\u2019s poverty rate is high for a lower middle-income economy.3 Much of the poverty \nstems from unemployment, the absence of local markets, and lack of higher education in rural \nareas. The poor condition of roads aggravates persistent poverty conditions, particularly in rural \nareas. The rural population has limited access to social services and major markets in the region \n                                                \n1  ADB. 1995.

Manila. \n2  ADB. 2017. Country Partnership Strategy: Mongolia, 2017\u20132020\u2014Sustaining Inclusive Growth in a Period of \nEconomic Difficulty. Manila. \n3  Middle-income economies have per capita gross national income (GNI) of $1,006\u2013$12,235 and lower middle-income \neconomies have per capita GNI of $1,006\u2013$3,955. Mongolia\u2019s poverty rate at $1.90 threshold was 0.22 in 2014, and \nthe per capita GNI was $3,590 in 2016. \n ", "2 \nand aimags.4 Travel is costly and uncomfortable. Without access to markets, local farmers and \nherders are forced to sell their products at lower prices. \n \n6.  Mongolia has a road network of 48,538 kilometers (km), of which only 6,406 km (13.2%) \nare paved. Investing in road improvement is particularly important at times of economic difficulty \nas it delivers four benefits: (i) projects create much-needed jobs to support economic recovery; \n(ii) better roads reduce road user travel costs and facilitate access to markets, schools, and health \nfacilities, making residents more productive; (iii) modest spending on road maintenance prevents \ncostlier rehabilitation; and (iv) road safety improvements reduce the social cost of traffic accidents. \n \n7.  Sector performance. The construction, maintenance, and rehabilitation of state roads \nare funded by the state budget, development banks, and international loans and grants. During \n2011\u20132015, MNT1.88 trillion was invested in the upgrade and construction of roads and bridges. \nThese expenditures were regulated by the Mongolian Road Law, 1998 and funded by the State \nRoad Fund.5 However, insufficient funds were collected as taxes were often reduced or canceled \nto keep fuel prices under control amid fuel price increases in the Russian Federation, on which \nMongolia depends for much of its fuel. \n \n8.  While investment in new road construction has grown, it has not been matched by \ncommensurate increases in road maintenance and rehabilitation. The state budget provides \nseparate annual allocations for routine maintenance and rehabilitation, but the government has \nnot funded any major maintenance or rehabilitation projects in 2011\u20132015, and the amount \nallocated to the Ministry of Road and Transport Development (MRTD) for routine maintenance \nhas been constrained to only 15% of estimated needs. Consequently, road maintenance has been \ninsufficient, and the condition of the existing road network has deteriorated, making transport \ncosts expensive and Mongolia\u2019s exports uncompetitive.  \n \n9.  Asset management. The country urgently needs to improve its RAM.  A previously \nimplemented RAM system is no longer used because of limited funding. Timely road maintenance \nis less costly than allowing roads to deteriorate and need major rehabilitation or reconstruction\u2014\nsaving money in tight fiscal situations. This requires capacity development and institutional \nstrengthening, significant investment in a periodic maintenance and rehabilitation program, and \nstronger  enforcement  of  vehicle  weight  restrictions  to  prevent  costly  road  damage  from \noverloading. \n  \n10.  To  improve  accessibility  and  optimize  government  spending,  ADB  has  conducted \nextended dialogue with the government since 2009 through TA to prepare and implement a sector \nroad map and capacity development strategy, including the provision of a RAM system.6 TA \nactivities helped the government prioritize work for a periodic maintenance and rehabilitation \nprogram. Major lessons from this work included the need for predictable funding and systematic \nasset management practices. \n  \n                                                \n4  Provincial administrative unit in Mongolia. \n5  The road fund was established through a 1991 government decree to help stabilize the funding available to the road \nsector. In 1998, the Road Law distinguished between the state road fund and local road funds. Further information \non fund revenue and spending is provided in Sector Assessment (Summary): Transport; and Financial Analysis \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for Road Database Development Using Geographic Information \nSystem. Manila; and ADB. Mongolia: Preparation of a National Road Sector Capacity Development Roadmap. \nhttps://www.adb.org/projects/44303-012/main (the Government of Mongolia approved the road map on 24 August \n2011); and ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for Road Sector Capacity Development. Manila ($2 million \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction). \n ", "3 \n11.  Partly as an outcome of ADB policy dialogue, the government passed the Mongolian Road \nLaw Amendment, 2017, which ensures that at least 20% of revenues from the vehicle excise tax \nare allocated to road maintenance. This would add about MNT7 billion to the road fund each \nyear.7 Significantly higher fines and penalties, including for truck overloading, will also go into the \nroad fund. Unlike in the past, the fund is only for road maintenance and not for new road \nconstruction. The amendment is an important policy change that the project will support. \n \n12.  Road safety. Lack of road maintenance amid rapidly increasing passenger car ownership \nhas an immediate impact on road safety and the social cost of traffic fatalities and injuries. \nMongolia has a relatively high road traffic death rate of 21.0 per 100,000 population annually while \nthe global rate is 17.4 and the rate for middle-income economies is 18.4.8 Under the Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) program, ADB has supported the development of a \nroad safety strategy that aims to reduce fatalities on CAREC corridors by 50% by 2030, against \n2010 levels.9 ADB also assists the government in developing a national road safety policy and \naction plan covering three road safety elements: (i) culture and behavior; (ii) engineering, both in \ndesign and maintenance, including winter activities such as snow control and deicing; and (iii) \neducation, including traffic safety awareness, driving skills, and traffic rules.10 The project will help \nMongolia implement the action plan by adopting international best practices. \n \n13.  Value added by ADB assistance. Previous TA (footnote 6) laid a foundation to support \nbetter planning and prioritization of asset management and to improve road maintenance funding \nas introduced in the Mongolian Road Law Amendment, 2017. The project will help the government \nimplement its maintenance program through enhancement of law implementation procedures and \nadoption of an improved RAM system. It will also introduce climbing lanes at traffic accident \nblackspots to avoid fatal head-on collisions. The attached TA will provide government agencies \nwith extensive training on RAM and road safety improvement. The project will provide institutional \nstrengthening to (i) ensure maintenance financing and prioritization, (ii) increase the efficiency \nand  capacity  of  road  maintenance  companies,  and  (iii)  introduce  performance-based  road \nmaintenance schemes. It will integrate road safety design and new maintenance technologies \nand will address vehicle overloading. \n \n14.  Link to country partnership and government strategies. The project is well aligned \nwith Mongolia\u2019s national action plan, 2016\u20132020,11 as it will take measures to strengthen and raise \nthe quality of road maintenance and gradually increase maintenance funding. It is consistent with \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2017\u20132020 for Mongolia, which indicates improvement of \nphysical connectivity as a priority activity under the second pillar of the strategy (footnote 2). The \nproject  will  reduce  transport  and  logistics  cost  on  CAREC  Corridor  4b,  enhancing  the \ncompetitiveness of Mongolia\u2019s non-mining exports. \n \n                                                \n7  The State Great Hural (Parliament) of Mongolia. http://www.parliament.mn/n/xroy.

Impact and Outcome \n \n15.  The project is aligned with the following impact: inclusive economic growth promoted by \nenhanced local, regional, and international connectivity in Mongolia.12 The project outcome will \nbe  efficiency  and  safety  of  road  transport  within  the  project  area  and  between  countries \nimproved.13 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n16.  Output 1: Road asset management capacity improved. This output will strengthen \nsustainable road maintenance practices and build capacity for the implementation of maintenance \nprojects  prepared  and  procured  during  the  project.  Capacity-building  activities  will  include \n(i) reestablishing and providing training on the RAM system to improve maintenance planning, \nimplementation, and prioritization;14 (ii) designing improvements in road funding to ensure the \nsustainability of maintenance activities, including measures to prevent vehicle overloading; and \n(iii) supporting pilot performance-based maintenance. This output will be delivered partly through \nattached TA and partly with output 2. \n \n17.  Output 2: Road condition improved. This output will preserve and improve important \nregional road sections that link the PRC and the Russian Federation through Mongolia\u2019s capital \nand comprises part of CAREC Corridor 4b. The project will improve 311 km of existing national \nhighway sections comprising Ulaanbaatar\u2013Darkhan (193 km) and Darkhan\u2013Altanbulag (118 km). \nImprovement works will include (i) pavement treatment and (ii) widening of carriageways and \nshoulders within the existing right-of-way (ROW). \n \n18.  Output 3: Road safety improved. This output will provide capacity development in road \nsafety policies and the implementation of safety features in the road condition improvement works \nundertaken with output 2. Safety features will include improvements in road markings, barriers, \nand guide posts. Climbing lanes will be constructed within the ROW at traffic accident blackspots, \nwhere overtaking of slow-moving vehicles often causes fatal head-on collisions. Independent road \nsafety audits will be conducted on detailed designs, as well as a post-construction audit. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n19.  The project is estimated to cost $60.6 million (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).15 \n \n                                                \n12 This project-related impact statement aligns with the Mongolian national action plan\u2019s strategy to develop a road, \ntransportation, and logistical network that sustains economic growth, is consistent with social needs and demands, \nand provides safe and comfortable services (footnote 11). \n13 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n14 A team of experts under the attached TA will assess the use of equipment and planning tools provided in 2010 under \nADB. 2009.

The TA is estimated to cost $730,000, of which $700,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The government will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of office accommodation, support facilities, counterpart staff, reports, and other \nlogistical support through in-kind contributions. ADB will engage an international consulting firm \nand a national individual consultant following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions. \nIt will use the 90:10 quality- and cost-based selection method because of the highly specialized \nknowledge required for the assignment. \n                                                \n17 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n26.  The assessment determined rehabilitation and maintenance needs, including constructing \nclimbing lanes and widening carriageways and shoulders to the Mongolian Class I-G standard to \nincrease road capacity and safety.18 The project components are expected to improve the \nconditions of the road from Ulaanbaatar to Altanbulag (the sections with some of the highest \ntraffic), which would bring CAREC Corridor 4b back to adequate technical standards and increase \ncapacity and safety levels at critical sections. \n \n27.  As part of the capacity-building activities, the project will review road fund mechanisms \nand develop suggestions to improve the State Road Fund\u2019s management, revenue sources, and \nfund allocation control. The result should bring the road fund to a level that permits ongoing routine \nand periodic maintenance. The project will also reestablish and repopulate the RAM system and \ntrain a dedicated RAM operations unit. The ongoing use of the RAM system must be supported \nby adequate funding levels. \n \n28.  The lack of routine and periodic maintenance funding constrained the operations of the \n20 state-owned  and  eight  private  maintenance  companies  tasked  to  perform  routine \nmaintenance. Domestic construction companies also suffered in 2012\u20132017 because of limited \nfunding. Foreign contractors won most construction projects during the period because they are \nmore efficient and local contractors have difficulty in meeting qualification criteria. Domestic \ncontractors tend not to participate in joint ventures, which would allow them to be more competitive \nwith foreign firms. While some consolidation could result in increased efficiencies, it is premature \nin the current fiscal environment. \n \n29.  Full introduction of standard performance-based contracts is not appropriate in the current \nsituation because the sector lacks the experience and the capacity to serve longer-term service \ncommitments. However, a form of performance-based contract will be pilot tested in civil works \ncontracts by adding an extended defect liability period of 3 years, with the contractor responsible \nfor the road section for a 5-year period. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n30.  The project is economically viable, with an estimated economic internal rate of return of \n60.7% for all the sections combined. The project\u2019s economic benefits include increased road \nsafety  and  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs  and  time.  The  project  will  also  generate \nunquantifiable benefits related to improved accessibility. A sensitivity analysis of potential cost \noverruns and benefit reductions demonstrates that the project\u2019s economic viability is robust.19 \n \n31.  Given the country\u2019s current economic difficulties and possible restriction on government \nspending, counterpart funding is limited to 1% of the total project cost. The project has no revenue-\ngenerating components. It is financially sustainable based on the assessment of the project\u2019s \nfiscal impact on the MRTD\u2019s projected budget. While MRTD\u2019s financial capacity is very limited, \nthe Mongolian Road Law Amendment, 2017 should result in a gradually increasing and more \nstable funding source for road maintenance. Improved RAM, including implementing adequate \n                                                \n18 The Mongolian Class I-G standard requires a two-lane carriageway with each lane 3.5-meter wide and an 8.5-meter \npavement. \n19 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nmaintenance funding mechanisms, will be an objective of the project\u2019s capacity development \noutputs. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n32.  The financial management assessment concluded that the financial management risk is \nmoderate  before  mitigation  measures.  Although  the  MRTD  has  experience  in  ADB \nimplementation, the financial management assessment recommended that it should strengthen \nits  financial  management  capacity  by  undertaking  training  on  ADB  financial  management \nguidelines and disbursement requirements, policies, and procedures. The MRTD will also recruit \nnew financial management staff for the project to mitigate implementation, compliance, and \nforeign exchange and interest rate risks. Detailed mitigation measures are described in Table 4 \nand in the PAM. \n \n33.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MRTD.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. Relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy will be \nincluded in all procurement documents and contracts. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n34.  The national poverty rate fell from 38.7% in 2010 to 27.4% in 2012 and 21.6% in 2014.20 \nLack of higher education and unemployment are key issues in rural areas. Out of 102 households \nsurveyed in the rural areas, 58% spend MNT1 million\u2013MNT3 million per year on education. Since \nmost rural areas do not offer higher education, people from these places continue their education \nin urban areas, where they rent rooms because of the lack of good transport. \n \n35.  Project beneficiaries, comprising about 301,000 residents at target aimags, will receive \nimproved, low-cost, and safe transportation. The project will provide better access to markets and \nbasic services such as education and health, reducing annual expenditures and improving the \nquality of life of residents. The strategic location of the project sites, along the border between \nMongolia and the Russian Federation, offers more opportunities for local development in trade \nand agriculture. The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming following the ADB gender \ncategorization. The gender action plan will ensure equal participation and benefits.21 It requires \nthat women comprise at least 50% of participants to community and household consultation \nmeetings on project construction activities. Training on small businesses and income generation \nmethods along the corridor will be conducted with at least 50% women participation. Prevention \nmeasures in the gender action plan will address the likely impact from HIV/AIDS, sexually \ntransmitted infections, and trafficking that women could face during the construction period.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n36.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows. \n \n37.  Environment (category B). The initial environmental examination complies with ADB \npolicies and requirements, including the Safeguard Policy Statement.22 It identifies potential \n                                                \n20 ADB.

Meaningful public consultation was done  following the \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  MRTD  is  committed  to  implementing  the  environmental \nmanagement plan of the project and the project-specific grievance redress mechanism (GRM). \nThe initial climate risk is low. The MRTD will establish a PIU, which will be responsible for carrying \nout the environmental management plan, environmental monitoring and reporting, and GRM of \nthe project. The PIU will have a full-time environmental officer and qualified loan implementation \nenvironmental consultants. The consultants will also provide capacity development training to the \nMRTD, PIU, and project contractors. The initial environmental examination has been prepared \nand posted on the ADB website. \n \n38.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). A due diligence report prepared for outputs 2 \nand 3 confirmed that the project has no land acquisition or resettlement impacts, as all the related \nworks are limited to the existing ROW. The contractor will mitigate all construction-related \nimpacts. A resettlement framework has been prepared, following the Safeguard Policy Statement \nand national laws and regulations, to guide the preparation of resettlement plans and to ensure \nproject impacts remain within category B or C. The resettlement framework was posted on the \nADB website on 9 June 2017.23 The MRTD is committed to implement the resettlement framework \nand prepare a resettlement plan, when required. The GRM has been agreed with the MRTD and \nis included in the resettlement framework. \n \n39.  Indigenous peoples (category C). Due diligence found no ethnic minorities affected by \nthe project. The three project aimags do not have any separate ethnic minority as defined by the \nSafeguard Policy Statement. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n40.  The overall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs and risks, and the \noverall risk after mitigation measures is  low. Significant risks  and mitigating measures are \nsummarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management \nplan.24 The loan agreement contains assurances on operation and maintenance budget provision. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nGovernment faces political and financial  The MRTD and/or the MOF will provide assurances to increase the \npressures in the adoption of sustainable  O&M budget provision, as this is a priority project in the road sector. \nroad maintenance and maintenance   \nfunding concepts.

The government and the MRTD have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n42.  The government and the MRTD have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n43.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $60,000,000 \nto Mongolia for the Regional Road Development and Maintenance Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 25 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n \n6 June 2018\n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nInclusive economic growth promoted by enhanced local, regional, and international connectivity in Mongolia (Action \nProgram of the Government of Mongolia for 2016\u20132020)a \n  Performance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2030     \nEfficiency and safety of  a.
