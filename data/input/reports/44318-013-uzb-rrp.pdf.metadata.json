Over 70% of the poor live in rural areas and, while declining, \nrural poverty remains higher (22.2% in 2009) than urban poverty (15.2% in 2009). \n \n3. \nRural  livelihoods.  Increases  in  the  working  age  population  (up  from  54%  in  2001  to \n61%  in  2007),  higher  population  growth  in  rural  areas,  and  significant  retrenchment  of \nagricultural jobs due to ongoing market reforms, are putting pressure on rural employment and \njobs. As a result, migration to cities is on the rise, as is the share of people in seasonal jobs and \ninformal employment. Changing this trend requires economic transformation, diversification, and \nindustrialization, and a focus on private sector development and accelerated expansion of micro \nand  small  enterprises  (MSEs)  responsible  for  generating  over  50%  of  rural  jobs  nationwide. \nInputs to attract and retain professionals with the skills needed to drive this transition include (i) \nquality education and health, (ii) better telecommunications and reliable infrastructure services, \n(iii)  regional  investment  promotion  and  development  of  regional  industrial  hubs,  (iv)  access  to \nbetter housing and living standards, and (v) increased access to finance. \n \n4. \nRural housing. Most rural houses were built during the Soviet period and are occupied \nby  extended  multigenerational  families.  While  rural  access  to  basic  utilities  is  widespread, \nservices are inconsistent and unreliable. The 60,000 new houses that are constructed annually \nare insufficient to keep up with population growth (1.5% per year) and the needs of the 200,000 \nyoung families ready to leave the parental home each year. About 1.5 million households are in \nneed of new housing or major renovation annually, and finance to underpin this investment has \nnot been available. \n \n5. \nHousing finance. The housing finance market is nascent. In 2009, the housing finance \nmarket  amounted  to  about  1%  of  gross  domestic  product,  with  less  than  10%  of  real  estate \ndeals financed through bank loans. Expansion of housing loan portfolios is constrained by lack \nof access to cost-effective long-term funding and high inflation risk.3 Affordable housing finance \nis almost nonexistent,4 and personal savings and informal loans remain the main source for new \nhousing. \n \n\n \nItem \nRural \nUrban \nTotal \n\nTable 1: Residential Housing Loans (SUM billion) \n\n2007 \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\n2010 \n\n2005 \n\nNo. \n\n2006 \n\nNo. \n\nSUM \n1.2 \n9.7 \n10.9 \n\nSUM \n0.4 \n2.2 \n2.6 \n\n28 \n172 \n200 \n\n97 \n672 \n769 \nSource: Central Bank of Uzbekistan. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Country Economic Indicators (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n3  Inflation reached 14.1% in 2009, and is estimated at 9.3% for 2010 and 9.5% for 2011.

Asian Development Outlook 2010 Update. Manila. \n\n4  For creditworthy borrowers, interest rates for housing finance range from 12% to 20%, with a tenor of 5 to 15 years. \n\nSource: Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU). \n\n\f \n6. \nAs a strategic focus of the government\u2019s Rural Development Program (RDP), the Rural \nHousing Scheme (RHS) was initiated in 2009 to launch the rural housing finance market. One \nthird  of  all  rural  housing  loans  issued  in  2009  and  85%  of  those  issued  in  2010  fall  under  the \nRHS. The Qishloq Qurilish Bank (QQB), a majority state-owned bank with an extensive national \nbranch  network,  is  solely  mandated  to  provide  rural  housing  loans  under  the  RHS.  Under  the \nRHS,  the  maximum  loan  size  is  1,000  times  the  minimum  monthly  wage  with  a  repayment \nperiod of 15 years (including a 6-month grace period), and an annual interest rate equal to 50% \nof the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) refinancing rate (12% effective as of 1 January 2011). \nRHS borrowers are required to make a minimum down payment of 25% and purchase mortgage \ninsurance. \n \nStrategic  context.  The  Welfare  Improvement  Strategy  2008\u20132010  (WIS) 5  sets  out \n7. \ngovernment  priorities  for  inclusive  economic  growth  and  the  context  for  the  RDP  and  RHS. \nUnder the RDP, which focuses on stimulating rural economic opportunities, 500,000 rural jobs \nhave  been  created,  7,647  new  rural  houses  built,  and  rural  infrastructure  and  social  and \ncommunity  facilities  expanded  and  improved.  The  RHS,  a  critical  pillar  of  the  RDP,  channels \nrural  savings  and  remittances  into  investment  in  new  housing  and  construction,  and  engages \nlocal contractors and uses local construction materials for RHS house construction to generate \nrural  jobs.  In  2011,  building  on  the  achievements  of  the  RDP  and  the  RHS,  the  government \nadopted the multisector Housing for Integrated Rural Development Strategy (HIRDS). \n \n8. \nHousing  for  Integrated  Rural  Development  Strategy.  Under  the  HIRDS,  integrated \nrural  development  will  be  supported  through  expanded  access  to  affordable  housing  finance, \nnew  and  improved  rural  housing  and  associated  infrastructure  and  services,  strengthened \nhokimiyat  (local  government)  capacity,  and  MSE  development.  The  provision  of  affordable \nmodern rural housing is the strategic driver for accelerating rural development nationwide.  The \nexpansion  of  improved  rural  infrastructure,  provided  in  conjunction  with  the  RHS  and  close \nintegration  with  the  MSE  strategy,  will  help  address  key  constraints  to  MSE  development  and \nthe  generation  of  new  livelihoods  and  employment  opportunities.  In  addition  to  reforms  to \nimprove  the  enabling  environment  for  MSEs,  new  modern  homes  with  reliable  access  to \nelectricity  and  water  stimulate  rural  home-based  microenterprises  and cottage  industries  often \nrun  by  women. The  development  of modern  rural  housing  and  expanded  access to affordable \nhousing finance supports MSE development to promote more inclusive growth. \n \n9. \nThe  HIRDS  encompasses  a  5-year  extension  of  the  RHS  from  2011  to  2015,  under \nwhich an additional 40,800 houses will be built and over 40,000 construction jobs will be created \nannually.  To  accelerate  the  development  of  the  rural  construction  sector,  while  increasing \naccess to affordable housing finance and newly constructed RHS houses, government interest \nrate  support  and  a  number  of  tax  concessions  (offered  to  QQB,  contractors,  and  construction \nmaterial  suppliers)  will  continue  to  be  provided. 6  Critical  professionals\u2014doctors,  nurses, \nteachers,  and  entrepreneurs\u2014who  are  needed  to  advance  social  welfare  in  rural  areas  and \nstimulate  rural  economic  opportunities  and  growth,  will  be  targeted  for  RHS  housing  and \nhousing  finance.  While  the  HIRDS  supports  further  downstreaming  and  greater  outreach  to \nmoderate  and  low-income  households,  RHS  beneficiaries  who  satisfy  credit  appraisal  criteria \nwill not be the poorest of the poor.7 Building on lessons and experiences from the RHS to date, \n                                                \n5  With  ADB support,  the  government  is  preparing a  new WIS  for  2013\u20132015.  In  the interim,  the WIS  (2008\u20132010) \n\ncontinues to guide the government\u2019s development and investment programs. \n\n6  Governments  globally  support  housing  subsidies:  supply-side  (to  incentivize  lenders,  developers,  builders,  etc.) \nand demand-side (to ensure housing/housing finance is affordable to targeted groups). See Global Comparison of \nHousing Subsidies (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7  During the first year of the RHS, without selection criteria, 99% of the 847 RHS homebuyers were households from \nthe highest income quartile. Downstreaming was initiated in 2010 following intensive policy dialogue with ADB on \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nas well as those from previous housing programs (focused on urban areas), public awareness, \ntransparency,  and  accountability  of  site,  beneficiary  and  contractor  selection  processes  are \nbeing improved, inventories of non-agricultural land for rural housing are being developed, and \npricing of new houses and housing construction costs are being closely monitored. \n \n10. \nThe  Ministry  of  Economy  (MOE),  which  is  responsible  for  overseeing  the  HIRDS, \nsupports  close  coordination  and  better  integration  of  the  RHS  and  the  RDP  with  the  Financial \nSector  Development  and  MSE  strategies  to  leverage  synergies  and  improve  development \noutcomes.  Under  the  HIRDS,  hokimiyats  play  a  central  role  in  preparing  integrated  rural \ndevelopment  plans  and  regional  investment  strategies  in  close  consultation  with  the  private \nsector.  Local  governments  are  also  important  RHS  and  RDP  stakeholders.  District  hokimiyats \nare required to provide RHS housing sites from state-reserved lands, assure that the sites are \napproved  for  residential  use  in  accordance  with  state  regulations,  and  coordinate  the  sites\u2019 \naccess to basic infrastructure and utility services. Provincial hokimiyats engage local contractors \nto construct new RHS houses. District hokimiyats, in consultation with mahallas (citizen-based \norganizations) and local women\u2019s committees, are responsible for screening RHS applicants. \n \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  strategy.  Rural  development  is  a  priority  for \n11. \npromoting  pro-poor  growth  under  both  the  WIS  and  the  ADB  country  strategy  and  program \n(CSP).8 By helping to improve rural living conditions and livelihood opportunities, the investment \nprogram  is  consistent  with  both  the  government\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  strategic  objectives,  and \ncomplements past and current ADB programs to improve rural and MSE development. 9 ADB\u2019s \ncurrent  country  strategy,  anchored  on  the WIS,  focuses  ADB  assistance  on  energy,  transport, \nbasic  services  (education,  health,  and  water  supply  and  sanitation),  and  agricultural \ndevelopment  (including  water  management  and \nirrigation),  as  well  as  private  sector \ndevelopment and access to finance. \n \n12.  Multitranche  financing  facility  (MFF).  The  government  has  requested  ADB  support \nthrough an  MFF  to  help finance  housing  loans for  moderate-  and  low-income  households  and \nsupport  capacity  development  to  strengthen  implementation  of  the  HIRDS.  The  MFF  enables \nADB  to enter  into  a partnership  with a  longer-term government  commitment  built  upon shared \nprinciples. The MFF also helps ADB sequence and link investment support to the HIRDS road \nmap  and  policy  framework,  and  implementation  of  programmed  reforms,  institutional  change, \nand  critical  improvements  in  fiduciary  oversight.  Other  ADB  modalities  considered  did  not \naddress the requirements of the government. All MFF preconditions are in place: a strategy and \nroad map, a policy framework, and an investment program and financing plan. \n \nPolicy framework. The HIRDS road map and policy framework provides a basis for an \n13. \nin-depth  policy  dialogue  on  the  investment  program,  and  enables  ADB  investment  support  for \nrural  housing  to  be  transparently  structured  and  results-based.  During  tranche  1,  public \nawareness and transparency  of  RHS  beneficiary  selection and procurement  processes  will  be \nimproved. RHS beneficiary selection criteria and selection process will be strengthened to reach \nmoderate-  to  low-income  borrowers  (young  families  and  first-time  homeowners,  teachers,  and \nhealth  care  workers  [two  occupations  in  which  women  predominate])  and  other  skilled \nprofessionals,10 and targets will be set for subsequent tranches to improve outreach of the RHS \n\n                                                                                                                                                       \nthe investment program, and about 74% of RHS beneficiaries for 2010 are from the third income quartile. For 2011, \nabout 85% of RHS beneficiaries are within the third (75%) and second (8%) income quartiles. \n\n8  ADB.  2006.  Country  Strategy and  Program:  Uzbekistan,  2006\u20132010.  Manila.  A  new  country  partnership strategy \n\nwill be adopted in 2012. \n\n9  The investment program is in ADB. 2011. Country Operations Business Plan: Uzbekistan, 2011\u20132013. Manila. \n10 Selection criteria include income thresholds to reach households in  the lowest three income quintiles and gender- \nbeneficiary  targets.  Refer  to  the  Facility  Administration  Manual  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \nAppendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fto low-income households. To mitigate real estate or land speculation, RHS homebuyers will be \nrequired to  make  significant  down  payments  and  maintain houses financed  under the  RHS  as \ntheir  primary  residence.  RHS  site  selection  will  be  undertaken  in  full  accordance  with  national \nand  ADB  safeguard  policies.  Measures  to  address  fiduciary  and  governance  concerns  will  be \nstrengthened  to  ensure  transparency  and  accountability  for  land  acquisition,  the  selection  of \ncontractors, and procurement of construction materials. Additional measures will be adopted to \nensure the quality of new houses and value for money. Programs to improve hokimiyat capacity, \nand address constraints to rural and MSE development, will be developed and rolled out. \n \n14. \nCritical policy actions and reform measures will  be preconditions for ADB finance post-\ntranche  1.  For  tranches  2  (2013),  3  (2014),  and  4  (2015),  benchmarks  have  been  defined  for \nphasing  out  interest  rate  support 11 and  promoting  greater  competition  and  efficiency.  By  1 \nJanuary 2013 (tranche 2), the RHS will be open to other participating commercial banks (PCBs) \non the same concessional terms. The multiple roles of the Qishloq Qurilish Invest (QQI), which \ncurrently acts as a construction supervisor and, through its subsidiaries, as a supplier of some \nRHS  construction  materials,  will  be  phased  out.  By  1  January  2013  (tranche  2),  QQI \nconstruction  material  factories  will  be  spun  off.  By  1  January  2014  (tranche  3),  QQI  will  be \nestablished as an independent legal entity, and the RHS will be open to other developers and \nconstruction supervisors on the same concessional terms. Based on a study undertaken during \ntranche 2, the government will pilot viable options for sustainable public support for low-income \nrural housing during tranche 3 and 4, and develop a strategy to expand outreach to low-income \nrural households for the next phase of the RHS. During subsequent tranches, training programs \nfor  hokimiyats  will  be  enhanced,  and  key  legislation  and  regulations  needed  to  improve  the \nenabling environment for housing finance and MSEs will be adopted. \n \nCapacity development. MOE will strengthen intergovernmental coordination to achieve \n15. \ngreater  integration  and  synergies  of  government  strategies  and  programs  that  support  rural \ndevelopment.  Training  programs  will  be  improved  to  strengthen  hokimiyat  capacity  for \nintegrated  rural  development  planning  and  investment  promotion.  Rural  job  creation  and \ndemand-driven skills training and re-skilling programs will be closely coordinated with the private \nsector  and  with  regional  investment  promotion  strategies  to  generate  sustainable  rural \nemployment opportunities. A review of global approaches and best practices will determine next \nsteps for further enhancement of the MSE enabling environment and expansion of rural MSEs. \n \n16. \nOpportunities will be explored to further improve the impact of the RHS. A results-based \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  framework  will  be  developed  and  implemented  to  track  outreach  to \ntargeted beneficiaries of RHS houses and mortgages, as well as rural growth, investment and \njob creation. Studies will be undertaken to evaluate: (i) sustainable options for extending public \nsupport  for  housing  (particularly  for  lower-income  housing);  (ii)  alternative  energy  and  energy \nefficient options for improving RHS house designs; and (iii) measures to strengthen government \nprocurement  processes  (and  the  oversight  role  of  the  State  Committee  of  Architecture  and \nConstruction  [SCAC]  and  related  agencies.  To  ensure  prudent  expansion  of  rural  mortgage \nportfolios, credit appraisal processes and portfolio risk management procedures and systems of \nPCBs  will  be  strengthened.12 An independent technical  and financial  performance  audit  will  be \n                                                \n11 With  no  established  pricing  benchmark  for  long-term  mortgage  loans  to  moderate  and  low-income  rural \nhouseholds,  the  CBU  refinancing  rate  serves  as  a  proxy  for  the  market  rate.  By  tranche  4  (2015),  the  weighted \naverage  RHS  interest  rate  will  equal  the  market  interest  rate  assuming  the  CBU  refinancing  rate  falls  to  7%  in \naccordance with current government forecasts. For details of specific benchmarks see footnote 19. \n\n12 In  addition  to  PCBs\u2019  own  capacity  strengthening  programs  (for  which  SUM5.8  billion  [$3.4  million]  is  allocated), \nstandardized  approaches  for credit  evaluation  and  portfolio  risk management, in  accordance  with  best  practices, \nwill  be  developed  and  adopted  under  the  Financial  Sector  Development  Strategy.  For  the  latter,  technical \nassistance  (TA)  support  to  the  CBU  and  PCBs  is  being  considered  under  ADB.  2010.

With more and better rural housing, \nthe outcome of the investment program is improved rural housing for targeted beneficiaries.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n18. \nThe  investment  program  will  deliver  three  outputs:  (i)  finance  for  approximately  40,800 \nnew  rural  houses  through  loans  extended  by  PCBs  to  targeted  RHS  homebuyers,  and \nstrengthened  investment  program  implementation  to  achieve  greater  development  impact;  (ii) \ncapacity  development  for  hokimiyats  in  project  areas  to  prepare  and  better  implement  their \nintegrated  rural  development  plans  and  investment  promotion  strategies;  and  (iii)  reforms  to \nsupport  an \nto  encourage  and  accelerate  rural  MSE \ndevelopment.  Project  1  will  finance  approximately  10,300  houses,  capacity  development  for \nhokimiyats, MOE, QQB and related bodies, and project management support.  Other investment \nprogram outputs are detailed in Appendix 1. \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nimproved  enabling  environment \n\nThe total cost of the investment program is $3.0 billion, most of which will be financed by \n19. \nthe  government.  An  MFF  of  up  to  $500  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  is \nrequested  to  enable  the  government  to  address  demand  for  housing  finance  by  targeted \nbeneficiaries and to strengthen the investment program\u2019s development impact.  \n \n\nTable 2: Investment Program, FY2011\u2013FY2015 \n($ million) \n\nItem \nComponent 1:  Rural housing loans for new rural housing \nComponent 2: \nComponent 3: \n \na  Includes $2.31 billion for new rural housing ($1.48 billion for rural housing loans and $833.5 million in homebuyer \ndown payments); $323 million for related utilities and social services; $386 million for community and commercial \nfacilities; and $4.4 million for capacity development. \n\nImproving hokimiyat (local government) capacity  \nImproving the enabling environment for micro and small enterprises  \n\n    3,028.5a, b \n       2.0 \n     24.0 \n 3,054.5 \n\nb  Does  not  include  land,  taxes,  duties,  interest,  and  other  in-kind  government  contributions  or  incentives  (tax \nconcessions for RHS participating banks, contractors, and suppliers, and mortgage tax credits for homeowners). \n\nAmount \n\nTotal \n\nSources: Asian Development Bank and Government of Uzbekistan. \n \n20. \nThe MFF will consist of approximately four tranches, each conditioned on submission of \nrelated  periodic financing requests,  execution  of  related  loan and project  agreements for  each \ntranche,  and  fulfillment  of  terms  and  conditions  and  undertakings  set  forth  in  the  framework \nfinancing  agreement.13 Tranche  1  of  $200  million  will  be  provided  as  a  loan  with  an  18-year \nterm, including a grace period of 3 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.15%,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  loan  and  project  agreements. \nFurther tranches will be subject to the availability of finance and allocation arrangements under \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. \n\n                                                \n13 The  government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nlending  facility  based  on  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n\n \n\n\f($ million) \n\nTotal Amount  Share of Total \n\n\u2026 \n \n\u2026 \n26.0 \n\u2026 \n26.0 \n\n(%) \n16.4 \n17.5 \n27.3 \n26.2 \n12.6 \n100.0 \n\nTable 3: Financing Plan for the Investment Program, FY 2011\u2013FY2015 \nComponent 1   Components 2 and 3 \n\n($ million) \n500.0 \n536.3 \n833.5 \n799.1 \n385.6 \n3,054.5 \n\n \nSource \n($ million) \n500.0a \nAsian Development Bank \n536.3b \nParticipating commercial banks \n833.5 \nRHS homebuyers (down payments) \n773.1c \nGovernment of Uzbekistan \n385.6 \nPrivate sector \nTotal \n3,028.5 \n\u2026 = not available, RHS = Rural Housing Scheme. \na  Includes $1 million for capacity building under the investment program. \nb  Includes $3.4 million for capacity building under the investment program. \nc  Includes $450 million in concessional financing ($90 million annually) to participating commercial banks. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Government of Uzbekistan. \n \nRelending, foreign exchange risk, and interest rate support. The ADB loans will be \n21. \nlent  to  the  government  in  US  dollars  for  18  years  (including  a  3-year  grace  period).  The  ADB \nloans (less $1 million for capacity development) will be relent to PCBs in SUM under the same \nterms. Recognizing the social focus of the RHS and without an established pricing benchmark \nfor raising long-term SUM, the government will assume the foreign exchange risk14 and relend \nthe  SUM  equivalent  under  subsidiary  loan  agreements  to  PCBs  at  an  annual  interest  rate \nsatisfactory to ADB.15 PCBs will onlend to RHS homebuyers (subborrowers) subloans in SUM at \nan  annual  interest  rate  to  be  determined  in  consultation  with  ADB,  that  allows  for  a  sufficient \noperating and profit margin and supports the phase out of interest rate support.16 The maximum \nsubloan size will be the lower of 1,000 times the minimum monthly wage or the SUM equivalent \nof  $50,000,  offered  for  a  term  not  exceeding  15  years  (including  a  6-month  grace  period).17 \nUnder Tranche 1,  $199,600,000 will  be relent  by  the  government to QQB for  onlending  to the \nRHS homebuyers, and $400,000 will be made available to MOE for implementing the capacity \ndevelopment and project management support activities. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n22. \nThe  investment  program  will  be  implemented  during  2011\u20132016,  in  accordance  with \narrangements and procedures outlined in the facility administration manual (FAM). MOE will be \nthe executing agency, and MOE and PCBs will be the implementing agencies. The procurement \nprocess  for  selection  of  RHS  contractors  will  follow  established  national  commercial  practices \nand procedures acceptable to ADB. Due to the remoteness and geographical scattering of rural \nhousing  sites,  and  relatively  small  values  of  civil  work  contracts,  the  works  are  likely  to  be \ncarried  out  by  local  contractors  using  locally  sourced  construction  materials  and  supplies. 18 \n\n                                                \n14 The cost of the foreign exchange risk is estimated at 8%\u20139% (CBU\u2019s forecast for SUM depreciation against the US \ndollar is used as a proxy). In accordance with ADB. 2003. Financial Intermediation Loans. Operations Manual. OM \nD6/BP. Manila (part D.4, paras. 17\u201319); and ADB. 2008. Foreign Exchange Risk. Operations Manual. OM H7/BP. \nManila (part C.2, paras. 11\u201313), \u2015ADB may consider subsidization of foreign exchange risk if warranted by country \nor project-specific considerations\u2016. \n\n15 This arrangement assumes government interest rate support to PCBs for foreign exchange risk. ADB policies back \nsuch support provided that it is targeted, transparent, fiscally sustainable, and includes an exit strategy. In addition, \nthe government provides a number of tax incentives and tax credits. \n\n16 For tranche 1 (2012), the RHS interest rate will be fixed at 7%. For tranche 2 (2013), the RHS interest rate will be \nthe weighted average of: 7% applied to years 1\u201310, and 100% of the CBU refinancing rate applied to years 11\u201315. \nFor tranche 3 (2014) and tranche 4 (2015), the RHS interest rate will be the weighted average of: 7% applied  to \nyears 1\u20135, and 90% and 100%, respectively, of the CBU refinancing rate applied to years 6\u201315. \n\n17 For 2011, ADB\u2019s financing share for each subloan is 0%. ADB\u2019s financing share for each subloan is 65% in 2012, \n45% in 2013, 40% in 2014, and 35% in 2015. Over the 5-year MFF term, ADB\u2019s average financing share is 35%. \n18 While  international  competitive  bidding  is  not  precluded,  it  is  unlikely  that  foreign  bidders  will  be  attracted  to  the \n\nlabor-intensive residential construction works to be undertaken at 300\u2013400 sites across the country. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nProcurement  arrangements  have  been  defined  in  the  FAM  in  full  consultation  with  ADB\u2019s \nCentral Operations Services Office. \n \n\nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nJune 2011\u2013July 2016 \n31 December 2016 \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\n(i)   Executing agency \n(ii)   Implementing agencies \n(iii)   Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \nDisbursement  \n\nMinistry of Economy  \nMinistry of Economy, participating commercial banks  \nMinistry of Economy project implementation unit \nAdvance action for procurement will be undertaken. \nLoan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  Asian  Development \nBank's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n23. \nSingle Source Selection of Qishloq Qurilish Invest.    ADB requires PCBs to ensure \nthe  construction  of  RHS  houses financed  by  PCB  loans  are  contracted for  in accordance  with \nprocurement processes acceptable to ADB. While construction contracts will be awarded based \non  competitive  bidding  procedures,  all  RHS  homebuyers  are  required  to  contract  solely  with \nQQI for the purchase of RHS houses. For QQI services, homebuyers will be directly responsible \nfor all payments related to QQI\u2019s services.19 Thus, while costs related to QQI\u2019s services will not \nbe  financed  by  ADB,  ADB  procurement  guidelines  require  that  ADB  satisfy  itself  that  the \nprocedures  employed  will  result  in  the  selection  of  a  construction  supervisor  that  has  the \nnecessary  professional qualifications  and  will  carry  out  the  assignment  in  accordance with the \nagreed  schedule;  and  that  the  scope  of  the  assignment  is  consistent  with  the  needs  of  the \ninvestment program. ADB is satisfied that the selection of QQI meets these criteria. \n \n24. \nQQI  was  established  to  oversee  and  supervise  the  construction  of  RHS  houses  to \nensure  that  the  nationwide  RHS  is  properly  managed,  transaction  costs  are  minimized,  and \nconstruction  is  timely  and  in  accordance  with  state  building  and  construction  standards.  In \nfulfilling  its  multiple  roles,  QQI  has  gained  considerable  experience  and  demonstrated \nsatisfactory capacity to implement these tasks. Moreover, the quality and pace of the RHS will \nbe  difficult  to  ensure  without  the  services  of  QQI  and,  as  such,  its  involvement  under  initial \ntranches remains necessary. ADB procurement procedures allow for single source selection (by \nRHS homebuyers) under specific circumstances and will be applied with exclusivity to QQI only \nfor  tranches  1  and  2.  Thereafter,  QQI  will  be  restructured  as  an  independent  legal  entity,  and \nthe  RHS  program  will  be  open  for  homebuyers  to  buy  from  other  developers  or  construction \nsupervisors.  Subsequent  to  tranche  2,  QQI  will  remain  eligible  to  participate  as  long  as  it \ncontinues to meet program criteria, but will no longer be engaged on a single source basis. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n25. \nEconomic  impact.  Housing  investment  stimulates  economic  activity  and  creates  jobs. \nLong-term funding reduces liquidity risk for banks and boosts overall bank lending. Savings for \ndown payments and loan repayments from homebuyers increase available financial assets and \ndemand for financial services. \n\n                                                \n19 The  government is  the  RHS \u2015developer\u2016.  The state  owns  the  proposed housing  sites  and,  together  with  relevant \nutility agencies, provides sites with access to basic services. QQI, a wholly owned subsidiary of QQB, is mandated \nas  the  sole  construction  supervisor  for  the  RHS.  As  an  agent  for  both  hokimiyats  and  RHS  homebuyers,  QQI \nsupervises  construction quality  and  building standards  of  RHS  houses.  QQI  also  owns  a  number  of  construction \nmaterial factories from which RHS contractors may procure supplies when they are not otherwise available. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\n26. \nDemand  and  affordability. Thus far, more than 65,000 inquiries have been registered \nfor  the  RHS,  with  more  than  10,000  applications  received  for  the  7,400  houses  to  be  built  in \n2011. There is significant demand by creditworthy beneficiaries, which will increase with broader \npublic  communication  of  the  RHS  (footnote  7).  The  price  for  RHS  new  houses  built  in  2011, \nbroadly ranges from $41,143 to $52,898 (SUM70 million\u2013SUM90 million). With less than 35% of \nhousehold income in the form of formal wages, the annual income for targeted beneficiaries is \nestimated  at  $7,656  to  $20,902.  Assuming  a  minimum  down  payment  of  25%  and  mortgage \npayment to income ratios (as is currently applied to rural households), house prices that range \nfrom $25,513 to $104,479 (SUM42 million\u2013SUM173 million) are within the generally affordability \nof RHS targeted beneficiaries.20 Specific targets for subsequent tranches will be defined during \ntranche  1  to  ensure  an  increasing  proportion  of  low-income  households  are  reached.  Viable \noptions will be explored to expand outreach to lower-income beneficiaries over the longer term. \n \n27. \nPrice  setting  and  value  for  money.  The  contract  price for  houses  constructed  under \nthe RHS is cost-based and based on the final bid from the winning contractor. Costs additional \nto  contractor  costs  are  detailed  in  the  homebuyer\u2019s  purchase  agreement.  A  number  of \nsignificant cost-containment measures have been adopted and will remain in place. \n \n28. \nFinancial viability and sustainability. The investment program is financially viable and \nfiscally sustainable. QQB and other prospective PCBs have experience in housing finance and \nare  committed  to  expanding  rural  mortgage  lending  portfolios  in  a  prudent  manner,  and \nupgrading rural credit appraisal and mortgage portfolio risk management systems. Sustainability \nwill be supported by opening the RHS to other PCBs and developers, phasing out interest rate \nsupport, and adopting measures to improve public support to the sector. \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\nThe \n\nfeatures \n\ninvestment  program \n\nimportant  design  elements \n\n29. \nto  support  good \ngovernance  and  ensure  accountability  and  transparency:  (i)  adopting  and  broadly  publicizing \nwell-defined beneficiary selection criteria; (ii) implementing an accountable beneficiary selection \nprocess with coordinated involvement of district hokimiyats, mahallas, and branch offices of the \nwomen\u2019s committee; (iii) publicizing the RHS pricing mechanism, cost saving measures, and tax \nconcessions;  (iv)  providing  accessible  recourse  and  grievance  redress  mechanisms;  (v) \nundertaking  of  a  technical\u2013financial  performance  audit  and  value  for  money  assessment;  (vi) \npublishing  a  results-based  performance  report  annually  on  the  investment  program;  and  (vii) \nsupporting  accelerated  market  development  and  greater  competition  with  implementation  of \nimportant measures under the policy framework (as outlined in para. 14). \n \n30. \nThe  government  and  QQB\u2019s  financial  management  capacity,  and  policies  and \nprocedures,  have  been  assessed  as  satisfactory.  A  FAM  outlining  investment  program \nimplementation  arrangements \nto  strengthen  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  will  be  adhered  to  throughout  implementation.  Legal \nagreements  include  provisions  specifying  ADB\u2019s  right  to  audit  government  and  PCBs\u2019  records \nand  accounts  related  to  the  investment  program.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and QQB. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the FAM. \n \n\nincluding  additional  measures \n\n                                                \n20 For 2011, the average down payment made by approved RHS applicants (of which more than 80% are within the \ntargeted income threshold [i.e., within the second and third income quartiles])  is more than 35%. The affordability \nassessment is outlined in the Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f9 \n\nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n31. \nThe investment program, while not a targeted intervention, is aligned with the CSP and \nsupports  the  government\u2019s  goal  of  reducing  poverty  to  20%  by  2015.  By  providing  access  to \naffordable housing finance and modern new rural housing, the program plays an important role \nin  greater  inclusive  economic  growth,  improving  rural  living  standards,  and  meeting  the \nMillennium  Development  Goals.  The  investment  program  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction \nthrough employment generation in the rural construction sector and ancillary industries and by \nenabling development and expansion of rural entrepreneurs and MSEs.  \n \n32.  While  Uzbekistan  has  a  good  record  in  gender  equality,  inequalities  remain.  Without \nregular income or collateral, women are constrained and unable to access finance for housing \nor  business  startups.  Legally,  men  and  women  have  equal  access  and  property  rights  to \nhousing and land. Traditionally, however, title is issued in the name of the registered borrower \nwho,  in  most  cases,  are  men.  The  investment  program  is  categorized  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming because it aims to promote better outreach and access to rural housing finance \nand improved rural housing and employment opportunities for women. \n \nD. \n\nTechnical \u2013 Construction Sector \n\n33. \nUzbekistan\u2019s  construction  sector  is  well  established  and  comprises  engineering  and \ndesign services, builders and contractors, and construction equipment and construction material \nfactories.  In  2009,  over  20,000  construction  companies  were  registered,  of  which  more  than \n90% are privately owned. Construction firms have broad experience with infrastructure projects \nand public and commercial buildings. While there are few small residential housing developers, \nwhich  generally  focus  on  urban  areas,  a  large  number  of  contractors  exist  with  significant \ninterest and capacity to build RHS houses. At 10% of the total value of civil works undertaken \nannually, the investment program will significantly stimulate the rural construction sector. \n \n34. \nTo ensure transparency and accountability of construction quality assurance processes, \nthe  government  has  mandated  oversight  roles  to  SCAC  and  other  key  agencies.  The  SCAC \nassesses  RHS  house  designs,  engineering  specifications,  and  unit  costs,  and  oversees \ncompliance  with  state  building  and  construction  standards.  The  SCAC  also  monitors \nconstruction compliance with state norms and standards, and ensures inspection requirements \nare  adhered  to.  Adherence  to  requirements  will  be  closely  monitored,  and  assessed  as  an \nintegral component of the annual independent technical\u2013financial performance audit. \n \nE. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Safeguards \n\nTranche  1  is  classified  as  category  FI  (financial  intermediary)  and  treated  as  impact \n35. \ncategory C for all safeguards. Environmental impacts are anticipated to be insignificant and only \nland  sites  with  no  involuntary  resettlement  or  indigenous  peoples'  impacts  will  be  considered. \nEach PCB will adopt an environmental and social management system (ESMS) with screening \ncriteria  and  monitoring  procedures  to  ensure  that  (i)  subprojects  have  minimal  or  no  adverse \nenvironmental  or  social  risks;  (ii)  none  of  the  housing  sites  have  involuntary  resettlement  or \nindigenous  peoples  impacts;  and  (iii)  all  housing  sites  are  (a)  categorized  as  state-reserved \nlands  and  approved  for  residential  use,  and  (b)  certified  as  technically  and  environmentally \nappropriate for housing construction. Safeguard requirements for tranche 1 will also apply to all \nsubsequent  tranches,  with  a  due  diligence  assessment  carried  out  annually  to  ensure  that  all \nnew houses and house lots financed by ADB are in compliance with ADB safeguards. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe program is classified as a medium risk project. Major risks and mitigating measures \n\n36. \nare summarized in Table 5, with details in the risk assessment and risk management plan. \n \n\n \n\n\fTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\n10 \n\nRisks \nAdverse selection of RHS \nhomebuyers \n\nConflicts of interest between PCB \n(QQB) and construction supervisor \n(QQI which is a wholly owned \nsubsidiary of QQB), and between \ndeveloper (QQI) and construction \nmaterial factories (which are wholly \nowned subsidiaries of QQI) \n \nConflict of QQI multiple roles: as \ntechnical advisor to the procurement \ncommittee, conflict of interest arises \nin evaluation of bids which potentially \nincludes materials manufactured by \nits subsidiaries.  \n\nMitigating Measures \nWell-defined  RHS  eligibility  criteria  and  transparent  selection  process  that \ninvolves  mahallas  (citizen-based  organizations)  and  the  women\u2019s  committee; \nbroad communication of criteria, routine monitoring, and social reporting. \nClosely  regulated  cost-based  pricing  and  procurement  processes  (defined  in \nFAM);  annual  independent  technical  financial  audit  and  value-for-money \nassessment. \nMortgage loan proceeds will be directly deposited in homebuyer\u2019s account with \nwithdrawal  rights  limited  to  the  homebuyer.
