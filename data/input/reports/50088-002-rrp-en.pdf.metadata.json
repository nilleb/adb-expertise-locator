The  report  also  describes  the \nproposed administration of grants to be provided by the Strategic Climate Fund (SCF)1 and the \nJapan Fund for the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JFJCM) for the project, and if the Board approves \nthe  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  approve  the \nadministration of the SCF and JFJCM grants. \n \n2. \nThe  project  will  (i)  support  the  Government  of  Mongolia\u2019s  policy  of  decarbonizing  the \nenergy system in remote and less-developed regions; and (ii) strengthen institutional capacity to \nimplement  the  State  Policy  on  Energy,  2015\u20132030, 2  and  Mongolia\u2019s  Nationally  Determined \nContribution under the Paris climate accord of 2015,3 which set the targets of increasing the share \nof renewable energy capacity in total installed capacity to 20% by 2023 and to 30% by 2030. The \nproject will develop a 41 megawatt (MW) first-of-its-kind distributed renewable energy system with \na variety of renewable energy technologies supplying clean electricity and heat in geographically \nscattered load centers in the less-developed region of western Mongolia. Once completed, the \nproject will generate 99 gigawatt-hours of clean electricity yearly, thereby enabling the country to \nreduce its carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 87,968 tons per year.4 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n \n\nRationale \n\n1. \n\nSector Performance \n\n3. \nGrowing power demand since 2007 has stressed the country\u2019s power system. Mongolia \nhas a total of 1,158 MW of installed capacity, but because of aging power facilities that are well \npast their economic life, only 969 MW is available. Electricity imports met about 20% of power \ndemand  in  2017. 5 The  country\u2019s  energy  sector  relies  heavily  on  coal-fired  power  generation, \nwhich accounts for 91% of total installed capacity and contributes over 63% of CO2 emissions. \nMongolia  is  the  world\u2019s  fifth  most  carbon-intensive  economy,  but  has  tremendous  renewable \nenergy  potential,  which  could  theoretically  meet  all  domestic  demand.  Promoting  a  diversified \nenergy mix with a higher share of renewable energy is a core priority of the government, both to \nreduce dependence on high-cost imported electricity and to decarbonize the energy sector. \n \nSince  2000,  the  Government  of  Mongolia  has  taken  several  initiatives  for  renewable \n4. \nenergy  deployment,  most  notably  (i)  implementing  the  successful  100,000  Solar  Ger \nElectrification  Program  (2000\u20132012),  which  provides  nomadic  herders  with  access  to  modern \nenergy  through  solar  home  systems;  and  (ii)  passing  the  Law  on  Renewable  Energy  (2007, \namended in 2015), which has facilitated the development of 137 MW of renewable energy power \nplants through a set of regulatory arrangements with a United States dollar-denominated feed-in-\ntariff (FIT). However, the  share of renewable energy in total  installed capacity is still only 12%. \n\n                                                \n1  Under the Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program in Low-Income Countries (SREP). \n2  Government of Mongolia, 2015.

Ulaanbaatar. \n \n\n\f2. \n\nSector Challenges and Opportunities \n\n5. \nThe  country\u2019s  power  system  consists  of  four  grid  systems,  which  have  successfully \nexpanded  electricity  access  to  97%  of  the  population. 6 The  central  energy  system,  covering \naround 90% of power demand, has attracted private sector-led renewable energy projects totaling \naround  400  MW,  of  which  120  MW  have  been  commissioned.  At  the  same  time,  other  grid \nsystems in the western Mongolia, which supply power to 25% of the population in the country and \nhave  exhibited  annual  demand  growth  of  more  than  10%  between  2010  and  2015,  have  not \nattracted any private investment in utility-scale grid-connected renewable energy development, \nmainly  because  of  the  relatively  small  size  of  power  demand  in  geographically  scattered  load \ndemand  centers.  Inadequate  investment  in  power generation  capacity  addition  for remote grid \nsystems has led to heavy dependence on imported electricity from neighboring countries across \nlong stretches of transmission lines, accounting for around 30% of transmission and distribution \nlosses.7 To address such unique challenges in remote grid systems, the government has sought \nto  develop  a  distributed  energy  system  using  a  variety  of  renewable  energy  technologies  and \nresources comprising smaller-scale and modular plants to produce reliable electricity for local use \nwhile reducing electricity imports. \n \n6. \nThe government has a coherent policy framework to guide renewable energy deployment, \nwhich is being implemented. In 2015, the government issued its Intended Nationally Determined \nContribution to the Paris climate accord (footnote 3), which would reduce CO2 emissions by 14% \nby  2030  compared  with  the  business-as-usual  scenario  through  renewable  energy  capacity \nexpansion, transmission and distribution loss reduction, and other energy efficiency measures. In \nparallel, the State Policy on Energy, approved by the Parliament in 2015, is aimed at achieving \nenergy independence and increasing renewable energy capacity to 20% of total installed capacity \nby 2023 and 30% by 2030. \n \n7. \nAs part of the overall policy framework in support of renewable energy development, the \ngovernment  prepared  the  renewable  energy  investment  plan  in  2015,  with  the  assistance  of \nmultilateral  development  banks. 8 The  investment  plan  will  help  meet  medium-  and  long-term \nrenewable energy targets through a two-track approach: (i) strengthening the energy policy and \nregulatory  framework  to  stimulate  private  sector-led  development;  and  (ii)  scaling  up  rural \nrenewable  energy  in  remote grid  systems  through the development  of  a  distributed  renewable \nenergy system in remote and less-developed regions of western Mongolia. In November 2015, \nthe investment plan was endorsed by the Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program in Low-Income \nCountries (SREP) subcommittee, with total indicative grant financing of $30 million.9 \n \n\n                                                \n6  United Nations Development Programme and National Statistical Office of Mongolia. 2012.

Ulaanbaatar.  \n\n7  Imported electricity meets around 70% of electricity demand in western and Altai-Uliastai regions. 95% of electricity \nhas been imported from the Siberian grid of the Russian Federation with an emission factor of 1.02 tons of CO2 \nequivalent per megawatt-hour. \n\n8  ADB, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the World Bank. \n9  The SREP is a Climate Investment Fund subprogram that supports transformation in eligible developing countries \nthrough  the  deployment  of  scaled-up  renewable  energy  solutions.  The  first  pillar  of  the  investment  plan  is  being \nimplemented with $1.2 million in World Bank TA to support regulatory framework strengthening, including grid control, \nlicensing,  and  FIT  adjustments.  SREP  grant  cofinancing  of  $28.5  million  supports  project  preparatory  TA  ($1.5 \nmillion),  and  distributed  renewable  energy  development  under  ADB  ($14.6  million)  and  the  World  Bank  ($12.4 \nmillion). \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\n3. \n\nSector Loan Modality and Asian Development Bank Interventions \n\n8. \nThe project is targeted at geographically scattered demand centers in the less-developed \nregion of western Mongolia. These regions are vulnerable to macroeconomic fluctuations, which \nmake livelihoods more fragile and the regions more likely to fall back into poverty. In the ongoing \neconomic downturn since 2015, poverty incidence in western Mongolia has worsened, rising to \n41.0%  in  2017  from  26.0%  in  2014.10 The  project  will  be  implemented  under  the  sector  loan \nmodality  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  more  flexible  project  implementation.  The \napproach  is  deemed  suitable  as  it  will  (i)  ensure  the  grid  stability  based  upon  actual  core \nsubproject  impacts  upon  the  grid;  (ii)  minimize  the  complexity  of  subproject  implementation \nbecause of the wide range of location-specific demand and grid conditions; and (iii) appropriately \nenhance the capacity of local utilities to manage the grid system through learning by doing. The \nproject will also help (i) develop technical capacity in local utilities and national dispatching centers \nto manage renewable electricity connections to the existing grid, (ii) prepare an investment plan \nup to 2030, and (iii) facilitate policy reform to establish a FIT adjustment mechanism to give private \ninvestors  appropriate  incentives,  through  output 3, for the  sustainable  scaling  up  of distributed \nrenewable energy systems.  \n \n9. \nThe project will help remove barriers to future private investment through (i) demonstrating \nsuccessful  distributed  utility-scale  solar  photovoltaic  and  wind  power  plants;  and  (ii)  building \nappropriate financial incentives. Once it is completed in 2023, the project will deliver (i) confidence \nin using distributed renewable energy systems for future expansion, (ii) enhanced capacity among \ngrid operators and local utilities to absorb progressively greater amounts of renewable energy into \nthe grid, and (iii) needed capacity expansion to help meet the renewable energy target for 2030 \n(para. 6). \n \n10. \nADB\u2019s Energy Policy supports the project rationale by promoting renewable energy and \nenergy efficiency, access to energy, and sector reforms to catalyze private sector development.11 \nThe  project  is  fully  aligned  with  the  policies  of  the  government  and  its  renewable  energy \ninvestment plan in 2015 (paras. 6\u20137), and with Sustainable Development Goal 7: Ensure access \nto affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. \n\n \n4. \n\nDevelopment Partner Coordination \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n11. \nIn 2017, the World Bank approved $12.4 million in SCF grant funding for the construction \nof a 10 MW solar photovoltaic power plant in Hovd, western region.12 ADB and the World Bank \nprojects will be administered by a single project steering committee under the Ministry of Energy \n(MOE) to minimize project administration-related transaction costs, and to allow for the sharing of \nlessons  learned  and  issues  resolved  during  subproject  implementation  for  effective  project \nadministration. \n \nB. \n \n12. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: greenhouse gas emissions reduced and \nimported electricity reduced.  The project will have the following outcome: clean sources of energy \nsupply in the country increased.13 \n \n                                                \n10 Sector Assessment (Summary): Energy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 ADB. 2009.

Washington, DC. \n13 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n \n\n\fOutputs \n\nC. \n \n13. \nOutput 1: Distributed renewable energy system developed. A total of 40.5 MW of solar \nphotovoltaic and wind power subprojects will be set up in the western and Altai\u2013Uliastai regions. \nThe project will also demonstrate advanced battery storage technology with energy management \nsystems, a first-of-its kind application in the country.14 The subprojects will be implemented in two \nbatches:  (i)  core  subprojects  with  25.5  MW  of  capacity  in  the  first  batch  (2018\u20132021);  and  (ii) \nnoncore  subprojects  with  15  MW  of  capacity  in  the  second  batch  (2019\u20132022),  as  detailed  in \nTable 1.15 \n \n14. \nOutput 2: Shallow-ground heat pump system developed. In selected targeted regions, \n500 kilowatts-thermal of shallow-ground heat pump capacity will be installed in public buildings in \nthree batches.16 This will supply air pollutant-free space heating for 10,000 square meters of floor \narea. The subprojects will demonstrate the performance of the heat pump systems and increase \nexperience in design, installation, operation, and maintenance for future scale-up. \n \n15. \nOutput  3:  Institutional  framework  strengthened  and  organizational  capacity \nenhanced. This  output will  (i)  enhance  the technical  capacity  of  local  utilities  and  the  national \ndispatching center for renewable energy investment planning, renewable electricity dispatching, \nand grid control and protection; (ii) support the preparation of a renewable energy investment plan \n(2023\u20132030) for the targeted regions; and (iii) support the project management unit for the project \nimplementation.  It  will  also  support  the  evolution  of  the  FIT  system  into  a  more  economically \nefficient tariff mechanism that reflects actual capital costs, while ensuring sufficient commercial \nfinancial viability.   \n\n \n\nTable 1: Subprojects \n\nApplied Renewable Energy Technology \n\nLocation and Province \nOutput 1: Distributed renewable energy system developed \nUmunogovi, Uvs \nAltai City, Govi\u2013Altai \nAltai soum (county), Govi\u2013Altai \nUliastai, Zavha \nTelmen, Zavhan \nMoron, Khovsgol \n\nWind power \nSolar PV \nSolar PV and wind with battery storage \nSolar PV and battery storage \nWind power \nSolar PV \n\nSubtotal \n\nOutput 2: Shallow-ground heat pump system developed \nHovd, the other soums \n(counties) \n\nShallow-ground heat pump \n\nTotal \nMW = megawatt, PV = photovoltaic. \nSource: Project feasibility study report approved by the Ministry of Energy in 2018. \n \nD. \n \n16. \n \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $66.22 million (Table 2). \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nCapacity \n(MW) \n\nConstruction \nPeriod \n\n10.0 \n10.0 \n0.5 \n5.0 \n5.0 \n10.0 \n40.5 \n\n2018\u20132021 \n2018\u20132021 \n2018\u20132021 \n2018\u20132021 \n2019\u20132022 \n2019\u20132022 \n \n\n       0.5 \n\n2018\u20132023 \n\n41.0 \n\n \n\n                                                \n14 The JFJCM is supporting the installation of advanced battery technology resilient up to \u201340 degrees Celsius with a \n\nminimum of 4,400 charge\u2013discharge cycles. \n\n15 The scope of noncore subprojects will be finalized during project implementation. \n16 The subproject will be implemented in three batches, starting with a 100-kilowatt installation in the Uvs aimag center \n\n(core subproject), followed by a rollout in four aimag centers in the western Mongolia.  \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fAmounta \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n15.61 \n11.05 \n1.05 \n9.05 \n6.83 \n10.24 \n1.14 \n1.76 \n56.73 \n4.37 \n5.12 \n66.22 \n\nTable 2: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA. \n\n \n\nBase Costb \nOutput 1: Distributed renewable energy system developed \n\n                   a.

Because  the  project  will  be  cofinanced  by  an  SCF  grant,  universal  procurement  will  be \napplied except for the cofinancing component of the JFJCM grant. \n \n19. \nThe government will be the loan borrower and the grant recipient, and will make the loan \nand the grants available to the implementing agencies on the same terms and conditions as those \nof the ADB loan, and the SCF and JFJCM grants. The implementing agencies will assume the \nforeign exchange and interest rate risks of the ADB loan. The government has assured ADB that \ncounterpart funding, including any additional counterpart funding needed to cover fund shortfalls \nor cost overruns, will be provided in a timely manner. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n20.  MOE will be the executing agency for the project. A project steering committee, composed \nof MOE, Ministry of Finance, and the implementing agencies, will be established to provide overall \nguidance in project management and implementation. A project management unit under MOE will \nbe responsible for managing, coordinating, and supervising the implementation of all components. \nThe following project implementing agencies will be responsible for the day-to-day management \nof the project activities: the Western Region Energy System State-Owned Joint Stock Company \n(WRES) for the Umunogovi subproject under output 1; the Altai\u2013Uliastai Region Energy System \nState-Owned  Joint  Stock  Company  (AUES)  for  the  subprojects  in  Altai,  Altai  soum  (county), \nUliastai, Telmen, and Moron under output 1; and the National Renewable Energy Center (NREC) \nfor output 2 (shallow-ground heat pump system developed). \n \n21. \nConsultants will be recruited to implement output 3 (institutional framework strengthened \nand  organizational  capacity  enhanced).  They  will  also  support  the  project  management  unit, \nWRES,  AUES,  and  NREC  during  project  implementation,  and  to  assist  them  in  conducting  (i) \ndetailed  engineering  design;  (ii)  procurement,  including  tender  document  preparation,  bid \nevaluation,  and  contract  negotiation;  (iii)  social  and  environmental  impact  monitoring;  and  (iv) \nJFJCM-related  activities,  including  project  design  document  preparation  and  validation,  and \nmonitoring and verification. \n \n22. \nthe project administration manual (PAM).17 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \n\n                                                \n17 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n\nAugust 2018\u2013August 2023 \nPhysical completion: 31 August 2023 \nLoan closing: 29 February 2024 \n\nProject steering committee \nState secretary, Ministry of Energy (chair) \nRepresentatives of the Ministry of Finance and implementing agencies (members) \n\nMinistry of Energy \nWestern Region Energy System State-Owned Joint Stock Company, Altai\u2013Uliastai \nRegion Energy System State-Owned Joint Stock Company, and National Renewable \nEnergy Center \nProject management unit at the Ministry of Energy, 16 staff \nInternational competitive bidding \nQuality- and cost- based \nselection (90:10) \nIndividual \n\n8 contracts \n81 person-months \n\n$48.28 million \n$1.55 million \n\n$1.28 million \n\n480 person-months  \n(9 experts) \n\nThe Ministry of Energy has requested advance contracting, which will include the \nrecruitment of staff in the project management unit. \nThe loan and grants proceeds will be disbursed in following Asian Development Bank\u2019s \n(ADB) Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion \ndate \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Implementing \nagencies \n\n(iv)  Implementation unit \nProcurement \nConsulting services \n\nAdvance contracting \n\nDisbursement \n\nSource: ADB. \n \n\n \nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n23. \nResource  assessment,  grid  stability,  system  design.  A  comprehensive  renewable \nenergy resource assessment was done for each core subproject site. Intermittency of renewable \npower generation could result in variability of frequency and voltage. As the project is designed \nas a distributed renewable energy system, the transmission grids in the targeted sites in western \nMongolia should be able to respond to such variability. Existing hydropower plants and the battery \nstorage system to be installed under the project will also be able to make up for the intermittence \nof renewable energy sources and ensure electricity supply throughout the day. An assessment of \nnecessary generation capacity and system configuration design was made, considering solar and \nwind resources, peak load demand, and grid stability. The subprojects under output 1 (distributed \nrenewable  energy  system  developed)  will  include  remote  control,  monitoring,  and  protection \nsystems  to  stabilize  the  grid  in  line  with  international  design  standards.  Capital  cost  estimates \nwere  based  on  current  international  market  prices  plus    the  necessary  costs  for  associated \nfacilities, transportation, and insurance. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n24. \nFinancial analysis of the project indicated a financial internal rate of return of 7.42%, which \nis  higher  the  corresponding  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  4.77%.  Sensitivity  analysis \nshowed  that  financial  internal  rates  of  return  would  be  (i)  6.37%  when  project  capital  costs \nincrease by 10%, (ii) 7.25% when operation and maintenance (O&M) costs increase by 10%, and \n(iii) 6.01% if the energy yield decreases by 10%. The project\u2019s overall financial viability is sensitive \nto changes in capital cost and energy yield, but remains robust under all scenarios. \n \n25. \nEconomic analysis of the project indicated an economic internal rate of return of 15.18% \nwith  environmental  benefit,  which  is  higher  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  9.00%. \n\n \n\n\fSensitivity  analysis  showed  that  economic  internal  rates  of  return  with  environmental  benefit \nwould be (i) 13.74% when project capital costs increase by 10%, (ii) 15.08% when O&M costs \nincrease  by  10%,  (iii)  13.49%  if  the  energy  yield  decreases  by  10%,  and  (iv)  14.25%  if  the \nimported electricity tariff decreases by 10%. The project\u2019s economic viability is also robust under \nall adverse scenarios. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nFinancial management assessments were conducted for MOE, WRES, AUES, and NREC, \n26. \nand  overall  financial  management  risk  is  assessed  moderate.  The  financial  management  and \naccounting  procedures  are  aligned  with  the  regulations  and  policies  issued  by  the  Ministry  of \nFinance, and are considered effective and adequate for the project. However, since WRES, AUES, \nand NREC have no prior experience in ADB-financed projects, continuous capacity enhancement \ntrainings in financial management for the implementing agencies are essential. These agencies \nhave developed and maintained financial management monitoring and supervision structures for \nbudgeting, asset management, fund management, internal and external auditing, and reporting, \nwith internal financial management rules and a centrally managed online financial management \nsystem. The assessments indicated that (i) accrual-based accounting and international financial \nreporting  standards  are  being  followed  by  the  agencies;  (ii)  the  separation  of  authorization, \ntransaction,  recording,  and  asset  management  functions  is  well  established;  and  (iii)  robust \nfinancial management and internal auditing systems are in place. However, business operations \nof the implementing agencies have been largely dependent on the government subsidy because \nof low level of end user\u2019s tariff. Improving financial sustainability of the implementing agencies \nthrough a tariff increase while ensuring affordability for end users is essential to meet the net profit \nmargin targets in 2023 and 2030.18 \n  \n27. \nProcurement capacity assessments were also carried out for MOE, WRES, AUES, and \nNREC, and overall procurement risk is assessed moderate. The four entities have experienced \nand trained personnel in procurement and contract management, supported by well-established \ninternal  procedures  and management  systems. The  accountability  mechanism  is  also  deemed \neffective to perform procurement and contract award, disbursement, and internal audit activities. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment,  WRES,  AUES,  and  NREC.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. Integrity due diligence for related risk analysis for WRES, \nAUES, and NREC were carried out and assessed low risk. \n \nD. \n \n28. \nThe project will directly benefit 258,313 people (118,960 of whom are women), or 50% of \nthe population in the project areas, through distributed renewable energy system development. \nBy providing cleaner and more affordable electricity while reducing air pollution associated with \ncoal use in power generation, the project will have a positive social impact. A side benefit will be \nthe  generation  of  employment  opportunities  for  the  local  population:  2,365  person-months  of \nunskilled labor per year during construction and 450 jobs per year during O&M. Priority will be \ngiven to low-income and unemployed women in local communities adjacent to the project sites. \n \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n                                                \n18 The State Policy on Energy, 2015-2030 (para. 6) includes the financial sustainability targets of public utilities: 0% net \n\nprofit margin by 2023 and 5% by 2030. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nSafeguards \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nE. \n \n29. \ncategories are as follows.19 \n \n30. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  of  the  core \nsubprojects (paras. 13 and 14), including an environmental management plan (EMP), has been \nprepared following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  national  environmental  regulations. \nEnvironmental audits of the existing facilities have been conducted. The IEE will be updated after \nthe completion of detailed design, if needed. Domestic environmental clearance was obtained in \nJune  2018.  An  environmental  and  social  assessment  and  review  framework  was  drawn  up  to \nguide the selection and environmental assessment of subsequent noncore subprojects. Both the \nIEE and environmental and social assessment and review framework were disclosed on ADB\u2019s \nwebsite upon obtaining the domestic environmental clearance.20 Meaningful public consultation \nhas been conducted and information disclosure requirements have been met. Grievance redress \nmechanisms will be established by the implementing agencies. Potential impacts, including soil \nerosion,  construction noise  and  dust,  waste generation,  and  effects  on  community  and  worker \nhealth and safety, are mostly temporary, predictable, and reversible, and can be mitigated through \nregulatory  compliance  and  through  EMP  implementation.  Sensitive  ecosystems  will  not  be \naffected. Core subproject sites are far from sensitive receptors, which helps to minimize noise, \nshadow flicker, glare, and blade throw risks. Sufficient budgets have been allocated in the EMP \nto  ensure the  proper  implementation  of  mitigation  and monitoring  measures.  Capacity  building \nprograms  will  be  conducted  to  ensure  that  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  and \ncontractors are able to undertake all construction and operation activities following the IEE and \nEMP.  Environmental  monitoring  reports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  every  6  months  during \nconstruction and every year during operation. Contractors will be required to comply with the EMP \nduring  the  preconstruction  and  construction  stages.  The  EMP  will  be  updated  as  necessary  if \nunanticipated  impact  is  identified  during  implementation.  The  executing  and  implementing \nagencies  have  agreed  on  a  comprehensive  set  of  environment-related  loan  covenants  and \ntraining programs in environmental safeguards. \n \n31. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  C)  and  indigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The \nproject will not entail permanent or temporary land acquisition, land use restriction, demolition of \nstructures,  or  relocation  of  people.  All  subproject  sites  are  either  within  existing  substation \npremises  or  on  government-owned  land.  The  project  will  be  implemented  in  ethnically  diverse \nprovincial  capitals  and  townships  with  no  boundaries  between  majority  and  minority  groups, \nwhether  in  lifestyle,  socioeconomic  status,  or  vulnerability.  No  impact  on  ethnic  minorities  is \ntherefore expected. \n \nF. \n \n32. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.21 \n \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  5  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\n \n\n                                                \n19 ADB.
