The government\u2019s priority areas include (i) strengthening the regulatory \nstructure  for  financial  stability,  (ii)  deepening  the  financial  market,  and  (iii)  enhancing  financial \ninclusion with a focus on promoting access to financial services to poor households and women. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nThe programmatic approach and subprogram 1 policy-based loan were approved by the \n3. \nADB Board of Directors on 1 September 2015. The program includes three subprograms aligned \nwith the government\u2019s strategy and critical finance sector reforms. The first subprogram focused \non  establishing  the  OJK  as  a  unified  and  independent  financial  services  regulator  and \nimplementing international best practices. Subprogram 2 focuses on support to the consolidated \nfinance sector master plan and advancing OJK\u2019s fiscal independence. Responding to government \nconcerns of rising inequality and the recommendations from the 2016 National Financial Inclusion \nStrategy, subprograms 2 and 3 further expand ADB\u2019s engagement in financial inclusion, with a \nfocus on improving poor families\u2019 access to financial services, financial literacy, and consumer \nprotection.  This  provides  the  platform  for  a  subsequent  dedicated  financial  inclusion  sector \ndevelopment program in 2020. The approach uses policy-based lending as it embeds the policy \nmatrix  within  the  government\u2019s  policy  decision-making  process.  The  loan  proceeds  provide \nincentives for reforms. The attached TA builds capacity of the government and the OJK.    \n \n4. \nDevelopment problems. Indonesia is facing the twin problems of insufficient growth and \nrising household income inequality. Economic growth has steadily declined from 6.4% in 2010, \nand its average growth between 2014 and 2016 was approximately 5.0%. This is low compared \nto its medium-term growth rate, which averages 5.6%. Growth is expected to remain only slightly \nabove 5.0% in 2017.2 This may not be sufficient to provide employment for the 3 million additional \npeople  who  attain  working  age  each  year.  While  commodity  prices  have  begun  to  recover, \nstructural weaknesses in the economy, such as the low competitiveness of the real sector and \ninadequate investments in infrastructure, underlie this prolonged slowdown in economic growth. \nIndonesia needs new sources of growth to meet its ambitious economic growth target of 8.0% by \n2019.  This  requires  acceleration  in  public  and  private  infrastructure  investments  to  improve \neconomic competitiveness, investment climate, and inclusive financial intermediation.  \n\n                                                 \n1  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2015.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors: \nProposed  Programmatic  Approach  and  Policy-Based  Loan to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  Subprogram 1  of  the \nFinancial Market Development and Inclusion Program. Manila. \n\n2  The International Monetary Fund and ADB projected growth of 5.1% in 2017 while the World Bank projected growth \n\nof 5.2% for 2017.   \n\n\f2 \n\nAgainst this backdrop of slower economic growth, the government is finding it difficult to \n5. \nreverse the trend of rising income inequality. Since 2000, Indonesia has experienced one of the \nlargest increases in household income inequality in Southeast Asia. The Gini coefficient, which \nmeasures a country\u2019s household income inequality, increased from 0.30 in 2000 to 0.39 in 2016. \nInequality  is  closely  connected  to  poverty,  especially  in  rural  areas,  where  62.2%  of  the  poor \nreside. Moreover, while 10.7% of the population lives below the poverty line, about 40.0% of all \npeople remain clustered around the national poverty line.3 Significant improvement is required to \nmeet  the  government\u2019s  Gini  coefficient  target  of  0.36  by  2019.  Literature  shows  that  financial \nexclusion is directly related to inequality.4 This is because financial exclusion deprives the poor \nof opportunities to raise incomes through savings and pensions and mitigate financial risks arising \nfrom natural disasters and economic shocks. Other factors affecting inequality include unequal \naccess to education, jobs, public services and inefficient redistributive policies. \n \n6. \nIn  Indonesia,  financial  exclusion  of  a  large  share  of  the  adult  population  is  a  problem. \nBased on data from the 2015 Global Findex, only 36% of the Indonesian adult population has a \nformal bank account (Figure 1). This compares unfavorably with Malaysia and Thailand, where \nover 75% of the population has a bank account. Similarly, the share of the adult population with \naccess to formal credit is relatively low in Indonesia. Only 13% of the adult population in Indonesia \nhas  a  loan  from  a  formal  financial  institution  compared  with  20%  in  Malaysia.  Access  to  bank \naccounts by the poorest 40% of people is 22%, which is also significantly lower than in Malaysia \nand Thailand. Access to accounts by women is also low at 37% compared with 75% in Thailand.5 \n \n\nFigure 1: Financial Inclusion in Indonesia and Selected Countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n\nSource: Global FinDex 2015. \n \n \n7. \nA  developed  and  stable  financial  system  safeguards  the  inclusiveness  of  the  financial \nsystem  and  has  a  positive  effect  on  reducing  inequality  and  poverty.6 Financial  instability  can \nadversely affect businesses, reduce job opportunities and credit availability, and raise the cost of \nfinance.  This  particularly  affects  the  poor  and  vulnerable  as  access  to  finance  is  an  important \ncoping strategy for them to deal with economic and financial uncertainties. The establishment of \n\n \n\n                                                 \n3  Data from National Statistics Office of Indonesia, https://www.bps.go.id/. \n4  International Monetary Fund. 2015.

Financial Development, Inequality, and Poverty:  Washington, DC.  \n\n\f3 \n\nthe OJK as a unified regulator is the first step to develop the finance sector and promote stability \nin an integrated manner. Financial stability is legally a joint responsibility between the OJK, Bank \nIndonesia, Ministry of Finance and the Deposit Insurance Commission. The separation of roles \nbetween the OJK and Bank Indonesia is clear.7 The OJK exercises micro prudential supervisory \npowers  whereas  Bank Indonesia  oversees macro  prudential  surveillance, monetary  policy  and \nthe payment system.  These institutional reforms have improved financial stability. As of February \n2017, Indonesia\u2019s senior 5-year credit default swap, which is used as a proxy for financial system \nrisk, improved to 140 basis points compared with 280 basis points in September 2015.8 However, \ndownside risks to stability still exist, as nonperforming loans and corporate external debt exposure \nhave marginally increased. In addition, Indonesia\u2019s shallow domestic capital market can make the \nfinance  sector  susceptible  to  heightened  market  volatility  and  vulnerable  to  the  risk  of  sudden \ncapital  outflow.  In  addition,  despite  efforts  to  deepen  the  market,  Indonesia\u2019s  finance  sector \nremains largely bank based and is relatively small. In 2016, finance sector assets (bank credit, \nmarket capitalization, and bonds) represented 105% of gross domestic product, compared with \nabout 175% for the Philippines; 179% for Viet Nam; and over 300% for Malaysia and Thailand. \n \nBinding constraints. The government has recognized the challenges it needs to address \n8. \nto have a stable, developed, and inclusive finance sector. They are (i) the incomplete framework \nand coordination mechanism for financial stability, (ii) the shallow finance sector, and (iii) financial \nexclusion. These constraints are discussed in paras. 9\u201311.  \n \n9. \nIncomplete  framework  and  coordination  mechanism  for  financial  stability.  A \ncomprehensive  regulatory  framework  and  operational  coordinating  mechanism  underpin \nprudential  supervision  and  financial  stability.  Four  main  impediments  affect  this.  First, \nnotwithstanding the setting up of the OJK as a unified regulator, the organization and reporting \nstructure of the OJK still mirrors that of the former regulators with each subsector reporting directly \nto a chief executive. This is reflected in the practice of each subsector having its own blueprint or \nplan which at times does not consider developments in other subsectors. In addition, the capacity \nof the regulators of each sector is uneven, which complicates the adoption of a fully integrated \napproach  to  licensing,  supervision,  and  information  sharing.  Second,  the  OJK\u2019s  operational \nindependence requires it to be financially independent. The OJK should be able to operate based \non levies collected from the industry. Until 2016, the government continued to partially fund OJK \noperations by allocating a total of Rp4.1 trillion from the 2014 and 2015 national budgets. Third, \nuntil  recently  the  regulatory  framework  for  financial  stability  did  not  provide  the  OJK  with  the \nauthority  to  require  systemic  banks  to  increase  capital  to  mitigate  financial  risks.  In  addition, \nregulators  and  supervisors  did  not  have  legal  immunity  from  prosecution,  which  impedes \nenforcement. Fourth, the coordination mechanism for financial stability was not institutionalized.  \n \n10. \nShallow finance sector. The key challenge to deepening the finance sector is to develop \na strong and credible finance sector, including Islamic finance, based on international standards \nand  best  practices.  There  is  also  a  need  to  develop  an  enabling  environment  to  develop  the \nfinance  sector.  There  are  three  impediments  to  meeting  these  objectives.  First,  the  regulatory \nframework for corporate governance of publicly listed companies takes a traditional prescriptive \napproach. This is not in line with international best practices which promote public disclosure of \ncompliance  with  corporate  governance.  Provisions  on  conflict  of  interest  and  a  whistleblowing \nsystem  also  require  strengthening  in  Indonesia.  Second,  the  government  and  the  OJK\u2019s \ncommitment to develop Islamic finance should be based on international best practices including \nin taxation and prudential standards. The capital gains tax imposed on all asset transfers hampers \n\n                                                 \n7  Regulatory Structure of Financial Sector Regulators (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n8  This is still high compared to the 70\u201390 basis points for Thailand and the Philippines.  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\ndevelopment  of  Islamic  capital  market,  including  for  infrastructure  financing  as  they  require \nmultiple asset transfers leading to doubling of capital gains tax. Thus, the tax framework is biased \nagainst  Islamic  capital  market  products.  In  Indonesia,  the  size  of  the  corporate  sukuk  (Islamic \nfinancial  certificate  similar  to  corporate  bond)  market  by  the  end  of  2016  is  only  $900  million \ncompared to $88 billion in Malaysia which has tax neutrality. Third, subnational governments are \nreluctant to issue municipal bonds because they are required to undergo audit processes from \ntwo  auditors,  which  is  costly.  This  duplication  arises  because  of  conflicting  laws.  The  local \ngovernment law requires subnational governments to be audited by the Supreme Audit Board, \nwhereas the capital market law only accepts audits by private auditors registered with the OJK. \nOther constraints include inadequate accounting and reporting guidelines for the repo market.9  \n \n11. \nFinancial exclusion. Inadequate financial literacy and incomplete consumer protection \nhave contributed to a large share of the adult population being excluded from the finance sector. \nMicrofinance  in  Indonesia  has  the  potential  to  increase  access  to  finance  in  remote  areas  but \nrequires  close  supervision  from  the  OJK  and  structured  capacity  building  for  the  industry. \nBranchless banking, where agents are contracted locally amongst the community to offer financial \nproducts, is also promising but for now is heavily focused in the more developed regions of Java. \nFurthermore, the 2016 OJK financial inclusion and literacy survey shows that literacy amongst \nwomen (26%) is lower than men (33%) and the national average (29%). The survey also shows \nlarge regional disparities in financial literacy among the population. For example, financial literacy \nrates  of the  adult  population  in  Jakarta  (40.0%) and West  Java  (38.7%) are far  higher than  in \nWest Papua (19.3%). There is a need for the OJK to develop literacy programs that better target \nthe  population,  including  school  students,  women  and  poorer  income  regions.  Incomplete \nconsumer protection also contributes to financial exclusion. The establishment of the Securities \nInvestor Protection Fund (SIPF) is a step in the right direction. However, the number of financial \nintermediaries covered by the fund is limited and the amount of coverage provided to investors \ninadequate. Similarly, alternative dispute resolution, which provides investors relief from lengthy \ncourt processes, is promising but must cover all subsectors and operate efficiently. \n \n12. \nGovernment reform agenda. Indonesia\u2019s National Medium-Term Development Plan for \n2015\u20132019 (RPJMN) seeks to promote \u201cgrowth with equity\u201d by reducing the Gini coefficient to \n0.36 and lowering the poverty rate to 7%\u20138% by 2019. The government recognizes that promoting \nfinancial stability, developing the financial market, and improving access to financial services for \nthe poor are integral to meeting these targets. The government\u2019s strategy consists of a series of \nreforms\u2014starting with implementing the OJK\u2019s mandate as an independent and unified regulator, \ndeveloping a regulatory framework, and implementing crisis management protocols for financial \nstability, followed by measures to develop the capital market and a stronger focus on financial \ninclusion.  In  addition  to  the  RPJMN,  the  government  also  launched  the  National  Financial \nInclusion Strategy in August 2016, which sets an ambitious target for 75% of the adult population \nto have access to financial services by 2019. Also, launched in 2016, and with ADB assistance, \nis the OJK\u2019s consolidated Financial Sector Master Plan, 2015-2019, which includes 411 reforms \nand programs, 134 of which are considered priority.   \n \n13. \nADB\u2019s  experience.  ADB  has  had  a  long-term  engagement  with  the  government  on \nfinance sector development, recognizing that finance sector reforms are sequential and long term. \nOne of the most significant finance sector reforms has been the creation of the OJK as a unified \nand  independent  regulator  in  2012  which  can  be  traced  back  to  ADB\u2019s  assistance  in  1999. \nBetween  1999  and  2012,  ADB  provided  consistent  support  through  six  major  finance  sector \n\n                                                 \n9  Repo  is  a  repurchase  agreement  used  to  raise  short-term  capital,  and  considered  the  base  of  finance  sector \n\ndevelopment, especially for the capital market. \n\n\f5 \n\noperations  (Figure  2).  This  started  with  the  Financial  Governance  and  Social  Security  Reform \nProgram of 2002, supporting the implementation of nonbank finance sector reform, designing the \nOJK,  and  amending relevant  laws  and  regulations. This  was followed  by  ADB\u2019s  capital  market \ndevelopment  program  and  technical  assistance  (TA)  grant  in  2007,  which  focused  on \nstrengthening market surveillance and investor protection. The OJK Law was enacted in 2011, \nand  the  OJK  started  implementing  its  mandate  to  regulate  the  capital  market  and  nonbank \nfinancial  institutions  in  December  2012.  The  initial  focus  on  the  capital  market  and  nonbank \nfinancial  institutions  was  supported  by  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Market  Development  and  Integration \nProgram (FMDIP), approved in 2012, and associated TA projects. After the establishment of the \nOJK, ADB continued to support the government and the OJK through the approval of the FMDIP \ncluster and subprogram 1 in 2015 (footnote 1). Through the FMDIP, ADB\u2019s initial focus was to \nsupport (i) the OJK to implement its mandate including developing the technical and regulatory \ncapacities  for  an  independent  and  unified  regulator,  and  (ii)  the  government  to  develop  and \ncoordinate  finance  sector  policies  through  the  Center  of  Financial  Sector  Policies  (PKSK). \nSubprogram 2 broadens ADB\u2019s areas of engagement to include financial inclusion reforms. The \nFMDIP complements ADB\u2019s other programs on investment climate and public finance linked to \nsustainable development goals.10  \n \n14. \nLessons  from  the  experience.  ADB\u2019s  experience  provided  three  lessons  that  were \nincorporated into the program. First, developing the legal structure for an integrated regulator is \njust  the  first  step.  The  OJK  needs  extensive  support,  particularly  to  develop  subsectors  with \nweaker  capacities,  as  a  prerequisite  for  effective  integrated  supervision.  Hence  the  FMDIP\u2019s \nsupport  in  capital  market  and  nonbank  financial  institutions  subsectors.  Second,  reducing \ninequality requires a comprehensive approach including reforming social assistance programs, \nimproving the investment climate, and financial inclusion. Third, financial inclusion reforms should \nbe holistic and require complementary reforms in enhancing access to financial services, financial \nliteracy, consumer protection, and using financial technology.  \n \nADB\u2019s value addition to program design and implementation. ADB approved a policy \n15. \nadvisory TA in 2015 to support key reforms that underpin reforms in subprogram 2 of the FMDIP.11 \nThe  TA  supported  reforms  in  all  three  outputs  covering  financial  stability,  development,  and \ninclusion. The TA also supported PKSK in the Ministry of Finance with capacity development and \npolicy  advisory  services.  Separate  TA  was  mobilized  to  support  local  government  reforms, \nincluding capacity building and shadow issuances for municipal bonds.12 In addition, regional TA \non capital market integration supported the OJK to adopt best practices in corporate governance \nbased on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Corporate Governance Scorecard.13  \n \n16. \nThe  results  from  this  assistance  have  been  impressive.  The  Law  on  Prevention  and \nResolution  of  Financial  System  Crisis  enacted  in  2016  is  a  significant  landmark  for  financial \nstability. The law provides legal immunity for supervisors who perform their duties in good faith. \nThe law also provides criteria for designating systemically important banks and reinforces risk-\n                                                 \n10 ADB.  2016.

With ADB assistance, \nthe OJK launched the consolidated finance sector master plan in January 2016, which prescribes \nkey finance sector reforms. The OJK has set up a cross-sector team to monitor implementation \nof  the  master  plan.  The  government  is  also  developing  a  tax  neutrality  framework  for  Islamic \ncapital  market  products  to  attract  more  foreign  investments  especially  for  infrastructure.    In \nfinancial  inclusion,  the  OJK  launched  the  International  Center  for  Microfinance  and  Financial \nInclusion which now provides capacity building programs to the industry. The OJK also expanded \nthe number of investors to 654,389 (assets of Rp3,569 trillion) protected under the SIPF. Finally, \nthe OJK increased the number of banks participating in branchless banking from four to 16 and \nnow covers 106,490 agents in 499 districts. \n\nFigure 2: ADB\u2019s Engagement in Finance Sector Development in Indonesia \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, FI = financial inclusion, FMDIP = Financial Market Development and Inclusion \nProgram,  GoI  =  Government  of  Indonesia,  OJK  =  Otoritas  Jasa  Keuangan  (Financial  Services  Authority),  SP  = \nsubprogram, TA = technical assistance.   \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n\n \n\n17. \nDevelopment partner coordination. Close coordination between ADB, the International \nMonetary  Fund,  the  World  Bank,  and  other  development  partners  has  created  strong \nprogrammatic synergies in the finance sector. Coordination is demonstrated by ADB\u2019s support to \nimplement  selected  recommendations  from  the  Financial  Sector  Assessment  Program. \nCoordination for the FMDIP is based on the government\u2019s process through PKSK. Jointly with the \nWorld  Bank,  ADB  supports  the  Coordinating  Ministry  of  Economic  Affairs,  which  chairs  the \nsecretariat for financial inclusion in the National Council. Development partners provide support \nto working groups in the council. The financial inclusion division of the PKSK, which ADB supports, \nleads the working group on policies and regulations.14  \n \nEconomic  impact  of  the  program.  The  three  outputs  of  the  program  combined  are \n18. \nexpected to lead to increased development and inclusiveness of the finance sector. The potential \neconomic  gains,  including  lower  cost  of  government  borrowing,  are  to  be  achieved  through  (i) \nstrengthening the regulatory  structure for financial  stability,  (ii)  deepening  the financial  market, \nand (iii) enhancing financial inclusion (para. 31).  \n \nB. \n \nThe impact will be increased annual growth rate of the finance sector in alignment with the \n19. \nRPJMN,  2015\u20132019.  The  outcome  will  be  increased  development  and  inclusiveness  of  the \n                                                 \n14 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n\f7 \n\nOutputs \n\nfinance sector. At the inception of the programmatic approach in 2014, the government agreed to \naccomplish  seven  expected  prior  actions  (or  triggers)  and  18  policy  milestones  as  a  basis  for \nsubprogram  2. 15  All  seven  prior  actions  have  been  accomplished,  with  four  exceeding \nexpectations.  During  processing  of  subprogram  2,  a  new  prior  action  on  financial  literacy  was \nadded and the policy milestone on the law on crisis prevention was upgraded to a prior action to \nadvance reforms in this area.  \n \n20. \nAt the government\u2019s request, ADB agreed to refine some policy milestones with the aim \nof streamlining the policy matrix. Four of these milestones are now merged into two policy actions \nas  they  were  related  to  similar  complementary  reforms.  One  new  milestone  on  financial \ntechnology was added, and one policy milestone was shifted to subprogram 3 and replaced with \na milestone reflecting changes in legislative priority. Subprogram 2 still contains 25 reform actions \n(9 expected prior actions representing high-impact reforms and 16 policy milestones), which the \ngovernment and the OJK accomplished in advance during July 2015\u2013March 2017. The changes \nin the policy matrix are reflected in the revised design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \nSubprogram 3 will include 10 prior actions and 12 policy milestones. \n \nC. \n \n21. \nOutput 1: Regulatory structure for financial stability strengthened. This output builds \non accomplishments in subprogram 1 to establish the OJK\u2019s integrated supervisory framework \nand strengthen the coordination mechanism for financial stability. There were 4 accomplishments \nin subprogram 2. First, the government enacted in 2016 the Law on Prevention and Resolution of \nFinancial System Crisis that provides the OJK with powers to increase capital for systemic banks \nto mitigate financial crisis and provides regulators with legal immunity. Second, the OJK achieved \nfull operational fiscal autonomy. Through the implementation of its revenue-raising powers, the \nOJK  collected  $337  million  of  levies  from  the  industry,  allowing  full  operational  cost  recovery. \nThird, in 2016, the OJK also launched its first ever integrated finance sector master plan, 2015\u2013\n2019. The plan consists of 411 actions and programs covering banking, capital market and non- \nbank financial institutions. A coordinating and monitoring framework has been put in place, and \nthe monitoring committee provides regular updates on implementation. As of November 2016, the \nOJK  had  completed  69  programs  and  actions  including  simplification  of  rules  for  issuances  of \nfinancial  products.  Fourth,  an  integrated  information-technology-based  licensing  system  was \nimplemented which harmonizes the licensing interface for all intermediaries. \n \n22. \nFor subprogram 3, the government and the OJK will develop regulations to implement the \nLaw  on  Financial  System  Crisis  Prevention  and  Management.  The  OJK  will  also  continue \nimplementing  the  master  plan  with  regular  reporting.  The  authority  is  also  committed  to \nimplementing a transparent levy system and cross-sector consolidated supervision.   \n \nOutput 2: Financial market deepened. This output supports the government\u2019s reforms \n23. \nto  deepen  the  financial  market  by  adopting  international  standards  and  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment  for  financial  services  and  products.  There  are  five  major  accomplishments  in \nsubprogram 2. First, the OJK adopted the \u201ccomply or explain\u201d approach to corporate governance \nwith a shift away from prescriptive regulations toward more public financial disclosure. Second, \nthe  OJK  continued  to  implement  standards  of  the  Islamic  Financial  Services  Board  related  to \ngovernance and Islamic collective investment schemes. Third, the government prepared the tax \nneutrality  framework  for  Islamic  capital  market  products.  Fourth,  to  create  an  enabling \n\n                                                 \n15 Prior  actions  are  considered  loan  disbursement  conditions  and  policy  milestones  strengthen  the  program. \nComparison of the original and revised subprogram 2 is accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nenvironment for the financial sector, the OJK strengthened risk management of insurance and \nreinsurance  companies,  including  requiring  higher  capital  provisioning.  Fifth,  the  OJK  also \nprepared a framework for accepting audits on municipal issuances by the Supreme Audit Board \nand accounting guidelines for repo.  \n \n24. \nFor subprogram 3, the OJK will continue to facilitate the pilot issuance of municipal bonds \nwith the  view  of  having  the first  issuance  by  2019.  In Islamic finance,  the OJK  will  continue  to \nimplement  at  least  50%  of  standards  issued  by  the  Islamic  Financial  Services  Board  and  the \ngovernment will issue regulations on tax neutrality for Islamic capital market products.  \n \n25. \nOutput 3: Financial inclusion enhanced. This output aims to promote financial inclusion \nthrough improving poor households\u2019 access to financial services and products, financial literacy, \nand  consumer  protection.  There  were  six  major  accomplishments  in  subprogram  2  under  this \noutput. First, on improving access of the poor to financial services, the OJK set up the International \nCenter  for  Microfinance  and  Financial  Inclusion  to  build  industry  capacity  in  microfinance  and \nfinancial inclusion. ADB and the center jointly published the Indonesia Microfinance Overview in \n2015, which provides recommendations for expanding financial inclusion and necessary financial \nservices for women residing in poor households. Second, the OJK also expanded the number \nand geographical coverage of branchless banks from 4 to 16 banks, covering 106,490 agents in \n499 cities and/or districts. This reform is particularly relevant to women since it brings the provision \nof financial services closer to their homes. Third, the government established the National Council \nfor Financial Inclusion chaired by the President of Indonesia. The council\u2019s mandate is to address \nimplementation  bottlenecks,  coordinate financial  inclusion  initiatives,  and  monitor  and  evaluate \nimplementation  of  the  national  strategy.  The  strategy  makes  specific  reference  to  women  and \nmicro and small enterprises. Fourth, on financial literacy, the OJK collaborated with the Ministry \nof Education to publish books targeting students of various levels and those visually impaired. \nFifth, the OJK also implemented a range of financial education initiatives, including focus group \ndiscussions  with  women,  and  developed  mobile  applications  on  financial  literacy  to  improve \noutreach.  Sixth,  on  consumer  protection,  the  SIPF  was  expanded  to  include  custodian  banks, \nwhich  increased  the  number  of  protected  investors  by  165,048  individuals.  This  complements \nexisting protection for the banking sector through the Deposit Insurance Commission. \n \nFor  subprogram  3,  the  OJK  will  continue  to  leverage  information  and  communication \n26. \ntechnology  by  developing  self-learning  e-modules  to  expand  its  financial  literacy  programs. \nAccess  of  branchless  banking  will  also  be  expanded  and  data  collection  improved  to  include \ngender data for agents and customers.  \n \nD.    Development Financing Needs \n \n27. \nThe government has requested a policy-based loan of $400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance subprogram 2. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a \ngrace  period  of  3  years;  an  annual  interest rate determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  Based  on  this,  the \naverage  loan  maturity  is  9.25  years,  and  there  is  no  maturity  premium  payable  to  ADB.  The \nproceeds of the policy-based loan will be disbursed to Indonesia in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time). \n \nThe gross financing need is $48.7 billion, with a budget deficit of 2.4% of gross domestic \n28. \nproduct. To finance the deficit, the government planned to raise $44.9 billion from the issuance of \nsecurities and $3.8 billion from official foreign loans. The size of subprogram 2 primarily reflects \n\n\f9 \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nthe  government\u2019s  financing  needs,  the  strength  of  the  reform  program,  and  the  development \nexpenditures arising from the program, such as operational costs for the PKSK, implementation \nof  best  practices  for  Islamic  finance  and  other  institutional  reforms,  and  costs  associated  with \nfinancial literacy programs (para. 31).  \n \nE.   \n \n29. \nThe  implementation  period  for  subprogram  2  is  from  July  2015  to  March  2017  and \nsubprogram 3 will be implemented from April 2017 to April 2019. The Fiscal Policy Agency in the \nMinistry of Finance is the executing agency while the OJK is the implementing agency. The PKSK \nwill, in coordination with the International Department of the OJK, monitor the implementation of \nthe policy actions under the policy matrix.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n30. \nSubprogram 2 has attached TA (Promoting Innovative Financial Inclusion) supporting the \ngovernment  and  the  OJK  to  advance  the  financial  inclusion  agenda  through  three  outputs:  (i) \nincreased access to finance through innovative approaches, (ii) broadened financial literacy, and \n(iii) enhanced consumer protection.16 Under the TA, a pilot project will be implemented to deepen \nfinancial  inclusion,  complementing  the  government\u2019s  digital  government-to-person  payment \ninitiative. The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, of which $800,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of office space, equipment, staff resources, and other in-\nkind contributions. The Fiscal Policy Agency will be the executing agency and the OJK will be the \nimplementing agency. The implementation period of the TA will be June 2017 to June 2019. \n\n \nIV. DUE DILIGENCE \n \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nA. \n \n31. \nThe  program  impact  assessment  estimates  potential  net  benefits  of  the  program  to  be \nabout  $5.9  billion  in  present  value. 17  The  benefits  of  financial  inclusion  are  estimated  at \napproximately $3.4 billion, which includes $145 million through higher levels of saving by the poor, \n$2.4 billion through better access to capital for small and medium-sized enterprises and women, \nand efficiency gains of approximately $830 million through the branchless banking initiative. The \ntotal cost to the economy is approximately $913 million. Approximately half of this amount is a \ncost to the industry through the OJK\u2019s levy. This approach shifts the tax burden from taxpayers to \nthe industry and frees up fiscal space in the national budget. Other costs include financial literacy \noutreach programs to women and micro and small enterprises. \n \nB. \n \n32. \nThe government has made progress in improving the legal and regulatory framework for \npublic financial management. Since the enactment of laws on state finance, state treasury, and \nstate audit in 2003\u20132004, most regulations for these laws have been promulgated. In 2012, the \nnumber of government agencies that received an unqualified audit opinion from the external audit \nagency  increased to  65% (from  about  40%  in  2009).  ADB  has  reinforced  this  momentum  with \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                 \n16 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nPoverty and Social \n\ncontinuing  support  to  improve  technical  capacity  on  state  audit.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \nC. \n \n33. \nSubprogram 2 is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming at entry. One of the key \ncomponents  of  the  program  concerns  enhancing  financial  inclusion  and  ensuring  improved \naccess to finance for the poor, unbanked, and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. The \nGlobal  Findex  data  show  that  a  similar  percentage  of  women  and  men  saved  at  a  financial \ninstitution in 2013, and 15% of the total male population and 11% of the total female population \nborrowed from a financial institution. Women entrepreneurs face unique challenges because of \nlimitations  in  time,  mobility,  and  resources.  Hence,  there  is  a  need  to  pay  special  attention  to \nensuring increased access to financial products and services for women entrepreneurs. One of \nthe key gender related targets in subprogram 2 is financial literacy initiatives for women.   \n \nD.   \n \n34. \nimpacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \nE.    Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n35. \nThe  program  faces  only  one  substantial  risk,  which  is  lack  of  coordination  for  financial \ninclusion reform. The National Council for Financial Inclusion is a critical reform but there is risk \nof slow implementation and stakeholders not extending the fullest cooperation, especially in the \ninitial  stages.  Mitigation  measures  include  ADB  supporting  the  PKSK  and  the  OJK  as  key \nagencies in the National Council. The risk assessment for the FMDIP is medium.18  \n \n\nThe program does not trigger ADB\u2019s safeguard policies and is classified category C for \n\nSafeguards \n\nIV. ASSURANCES \n \n\n36. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting services,  and  disbursement as  described  in  detail  in  the  loan \ndocuments. \n \n\nV. RECOMMENDATION \n\n \n37. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  policy-based  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nagreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan  of  $400,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  subprogram  2  of  the  Financial  Market \nDevelopment  and  Inclusion  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  in  regular  terms, \nwith interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; for a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other \nterms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan \nagreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n6 June 2017 \n\n                                                 \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nRisks \n\n \nMacroeconomic \ninstability that slows \neconomic growth and \nleads to significant \ncapital outflow  \n\n \nTA support by \ndevelopment partners \nrefocused to other \nareas \n \n\nImpact the Program is Aligned with \nAnnual growth rate of finance sector increased (National Medium-Term Development Plan, 2015\u20132019) \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \n\n \na.

OJK launched and implemented \nconsolidated financial sector master plan \nwhich identifies 134 priority reforms \nincluding financial inclusion, and \ninstitutionalized central coordination \nmonitoring mechanism (as of January \n2017, OJK has implemented 69 reforms \nincluding 23 priority reforms).   \n\n2. OJK established itself as fiscally \nindependent regulator and finance its \noperations based on levies collected from \nthe industry ($300 million in 2015 and $337 \nmillion in 2016 and no government budget \nallocation provided in 2016.1 \n \n3.
