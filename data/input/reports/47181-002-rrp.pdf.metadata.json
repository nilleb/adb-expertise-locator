The  report  also  describes \nManagement \nadministration  of  a  grant  and  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  be  provided  by  the  Japan  Fund  for \nPoverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  for  the  project,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan  and \ngrant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the JFPR grant and \nTA.1 \n \n2. \nThe proposed project addresses issues of water resources management (WRM) at river \nbasin, water supply, and water user levels in the Pyanj River basin (PRB) in southern Tajikistan. \nThe project will improve the government\u2019s WRM capacity in the PRB, and increase agricultural \nproduction, food security, and water supply and use efficiencies in the Chubek Irrigation System \n(CIS).2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n \n\nRationale \n\n1. \n\nSector Overview \n\nIrrigation \n\nis  critical \n\n3. \nAgriculture  accounts  for  about  25%  of  Tajikistan\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  and  export \nrevenues, and 39% of tax revenues. Tajikistan is the country in Central Asia most vulnerable to \nfood  insecurity,  given  limited  productive  irrigated  land  (which  accounts  for  95%  of  crop \nproduction)  and  underdeveloped  agriculture, 3  as  well  as  poor  rural\u2013urban  connectivity  and \nlimited  community  resilience  to  climate-induced  shocks.  Agricultural  land,  which  accounts  for \n25%  of  the  country\u2019s  total  land  area,  has  declined  since  independence  in  1991.  In  2010,  less \nthan 20% of agricultural land was classified as arable. Cultivated land per capita is 0.1 hectares \n(ha), the smallest in Central Asia. Forty five percent of the country\u2019s employment and 57% of all \nrural employment is still in agriculture.  Forty seven percent of the population are living on less \nthan $1.33 per day. Almost 80% of the country\u2019s working poor live in rural areas and half of the \nworking poor are in agriculture, where they receive low wages.4  \n \n4. \nfood  security,  and  economic \nadvancement. The total area developed for irrigation is about 748,000 ha. However, the actual \nirrigated area including areas with poor irrigation and drainage (I&D) conditions is estimated at \n700,000 ha because of deteriorating I&D infrastructure, salinization, waterlogged soils, and state \nauthorities\u2019 limited capacities and resources, as well as low capacities of farm management and \nwater use. The agency responsible for irrigation estimated in 2012 that all interfarm canals and \nmore  than  one-third  of  pump  stations  required  major  rehabilitation,  and  there  was  more  than \n53,000  ha  of  land  with  unsatisfactory  ameliorative  status  because  of  deteriorated  drainage \nsystems.  Coupled  with  limited  farm  inputs,  this  has  resulted  in  low  agricultural  productivity  in \nTajikistan. For example, yields of major crops (2.2 tons [t] per ha for wheat, 1.7 t/ha for cotton) \nare significantly lower than in Uzbekistan (4.5 t/ha for wheat, 2.3 t/ha for cotton).   \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance to Tajikistan for Water Resources Management in Pyanj River Basin. Manila. \n3  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  of  the  United  Nations.  2012.  Irrigation  in  Central  Asia  in  Figures  (AQUASTAT \n\nfor  agricultural  development, \n\nSurvey\u20132012). Rome. \n\n4  World Bank. 2009. Republic of Tajikistan Poverty Assessment. Washington, DC. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nClimate Change Impacts \n\n \n5. \nTajikistan  is  considered  highly  vulnerable  to  the  adverse  effects  of  climate  change. \nClimate  scenarios  indicate  that  Tajikistan  will  experience  temperature  increase  of  up  to  2\u00b0 \nCelsius by 2050, which will lead to increased crop water demand. It will also lead to accelerated \nglacial  retreat,  with  glacial  extent  expected  to  decline  by  50%  during  2010\u20132050. 5  Peak \nseasonal  runoff  is  expected  to  shift  from  early  spring  to  late  winter.6 These  changes  will  also \nhave significant consequences for food security and rural livelihoods.  \n \n6. \nAmong  Central  Asian  countries,  Tajikistan  has  the  second  lowest  level  of  total  actual \nrenewable water resources per capita (Uzbekistan has the lowest). From 1990 to 2004, annual \ndiversions from surface and groundwater declined from 13.7 cubic kilometers (km3) to 12.3 km3 \nand  water  delivered  declined  from  12.0  km3  to  9.0  km3.  This  resulted  in  a  decrease  of  water \ndelivery efficiency from 88% to 75%.7 These decreases are attributed to the deteriorating WRM \ninfrastructure (particularly I&D, as 91% of diverted water has been used for irrigation), and the \nweak operation and maintenance (O&M) capacity of WRM institutions.  \n \n7. \nThe  government  has  prioritized  efforts  to  increase  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of \nWRM  and  agriculture  production.  It  targets  the  improvement  of  irrigated  agriculture  covering \n320,000  ha  and  the  creation of  1,500  ha  of  irrigated  land to  achieve an increase  of  7%  in the \nvalue of agricultural products by 2015 to meet national food demand. To achieve these targets, \nthe  government  calls  for  $262  million  for  better  WRM  and  $24  million  for  better  agriculture \ninvestment. 8 Identified  significant  gaps  against  targets  were  restated  in  the  strategy  of  the \nAgency of Land Reclamation and Irrigation (ALRI).9  \n \nThe government is also reforming WRM.10 The Ministry of Land Reclamation and Water \n8. \nResources was abolished in 2013 and its responsibilities were reassigned to the newly formed \n(i) Ministry of Energy and Water Resources (MEWR), responsible for the policy and regulations \non WRM;  and (ii)  the  ALRI,  responsible for  the development  and O&M  of WRM  infrastructure. \nFurther  reforms  include  (i)  the  change  in  WRM  areas  from  territorial  administrative  areas  to \nhydrological  areas;  and  (ii)  the  establishment  of  (a)  river  basin  management  (RBM)  plans  to \nclarify  and  monitor  water  allocations;  and  (b)  water  governance  institutes  such  as  river  basin \norganizations,  which  will  draft  RBM  plans,  and  river  basin  councils,  which  will  provide  a \nparticipation mechanism for water users to approve RBM plans.   \n \n\n3. \n\nPyanj River Basin Overview \n\n \n9. \nThe PRB is the largest river basin in the country. The mountain massifs that define the \nbasin  feature  glaciers  and  permanent  snowfields  at  elevations  above  3,500  meters,  and  have \nhigh-density drainage networks of steep alpine streams delivering runoff and sediment rapidly to \nthe alluvial fan. The PRB\u2019s WRM will affect the country\u2019s economy as it (i) covers the majority of \nKhatlon province, which has the largest population (2.7 million) and agriculture production (e.g., \n774,000 t of cereal production) in the country, (ii) includes the most food-insecure zone among \n\n                                                \n5  ADB. 2014.

Dushanbe. \n\n\fthe country\u2019s irrigated area,11 and (iii) is the country\u2019s poorest river basin (55% of the population \nis  poor). 12  The  PRB  is  also  vulnerable  to  climate  change.  Annual  river  flows  are  likely  to \nincrease in the glacial sub-basins between 2015 and 2065 or 2075 because of increased melt \ncaused by higher air temperatures. The expected change in monthly flow rates due to increased \nrainfall  and  decreased  snowfall  may  entail  an  increase  in  the  magnitude  and  frequency  of \nextreme flood events. Also, a gradual shift in the river flow seasonal distribution and increase in \nirrigation water requirements are predicted (footnote 6).  \n\n \nThe Pyanj River forms the boundary of Tajikistan and Afghanistan. Given that more than \n10. \n40%  of  the  PRB  comprises  the  territory  of  Afghanistan  and  serious  flood  disasters  have \noccurred  frequently,  in  2010  both  governments  signed  a  bilateral  agreement  for  joint \nhydrological  monitoring  of  the  Pyanj  River.  A  plan  to  establish  a  joint  PRB  commission  was \ndrafted  in  2013  with  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  assistance. 13  The  government  has \nrequested ADB support to establish and implement the joint commission. \n \n11. \nThe project is consistent with the priorities of ADB\u2019s draft country partnership strategy for \n2016\u20132020,  which recommends  the  allocation  of  15%  of  ADB\u2019s  available resources to climate \nchange  adaptation,  WRM,  and  food  security.  The  project  is  included  in  the  ADB  country \noperations business plan for 2016\u20132018.14 ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 highlighted \nthe  promotion  of  food  security  and  agricultural  productivity.15 The  project  reflects  the  following \nlessons  from  a  previous  ADB-financed  irrigation  project:  (i)  projects  dispersed  over  a  broad \ngeographic  area  have  high  administrative  burdens,  and  (ii)  improving  on-farm  agricultural \nproductivity  and  ensuring  sufficient  funds  through  water  use  levies  and/or  government \ncontributions are crucial for the project\u2019s sustainability and water users\u2019 associations (WUAs).16  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n12. \nThe project impacts, which are aligned with government strategies (footnotes 9 and 10) \nwill be the following: (i) irrigated land in good condition and food security increased by 2021, and \n(ii)  efficiency  of  water  resource  use  increased  by  2021.  The  outcome  will  be  increased \nagricultural production in the CIS area of the PRB.  \n\n \nAmong  irrigation  systems  in  the  PRB,  which  cover  about  120,000  ha,  the  CIS  is  the \n13. \nlargest  (50,160  ha).  The  maximum  water  supply  of  the  system  declined  to  around  80  cubic \nmeters (m3) per second in 2013, compared to its design capacity of 150 m3 per second in 1950 \nbecause of system deterioration. This is attributed to sediment deposition and poor O&M (about \n460,000 m3 of sediment enters the CIS main canal from the Pyanj River every year), which has \nresulted  in  a  decrease  of  the  actual  irrigated  area  to  43,210  ha,  overall  irrigation  efficiency  to \n30%,  and  low  crop  yields  (e.g.,  wheat  yield  of  2.96  t/ha  and  cotton  yield  of  2.05  t/ha).  While \nagriculture  in  the  CIS  area  is  dependent  on  wheat  and  cotton  which  account  for  39%  (wheat) \nand 36% (cotton) of the cultivated area, profitable crops (e.g., vegetables and fruit) account for \nonly 16%, which is less than in other regions (footnote 16).      \n\n                                                \n11 World Food Programme. 2013.

This output under \nthe  JFPR  TA  includes  improving  the WRM  system  in  the  Tajikistan  portion,  and  effective  joint \nregional management of the PRB. The first component is in line with the ongoing water sector \nreform  and  will  (i)  establish  and  manage  river  basin  organizations,  (ii)  help  river  basin \norganizations  draft  an  RBM  plan,  and  (iii)  facilitate  the  forming  of  river  basin  councils.  In \naddition,  the  capacity  of  MEWR\u2019s  local  staff  and  staff  of  river  basin  organizations  will  be \nstrengthened  for  accurate measurement  and  recording  of  diverted  water  flows  at  key  sections \nalong the Pyanj River (at present, the actual flow of the CIS main canal is 63% of recorded flow) \nand for appropriate data processing. The second component will help (i) draft the agreement to \nform  the  joint  PRB  commission,  its  institutional  structure  and  implementation  plan,  and \nregulations  on  administrative  and  technical  operational  procedures;  (ii)  establish  a  working \ngroup  to  review  the  draft  agreement;  (iii)  facilitate  consultations  with  the  Government  of \nAfghanistan; and (iv) strengthen the commission\u2019s capacity to implement the agreement.17 The \nstrengthening capacity of hydro-meteorological monitoring and forecasting will also contribute to \nthe output, and it may be added subject to fund availability.   \n \n15. \nOutput  2:  Modernized  and  climate-proofed  Chubek  Irrigation  System  water \nresources management infrastructure fully operational. This includes (i) modernization and \nrehabilitation  of  I&D  infrastructure  and  its  climate  proofing,  (ii)  construction  of  a  sediment-\nexcluding  basin,  (iii)  modernization  and  rehabilitation  of  pumping  units,  and  (iv)  capacity \ndevelopment of ALRI staff. The first component will cover the Chubek main canal including head \nregulator, escape structure, cross regulators, offtake structures, and interfarm and on-farm I&D \ncanals  and  associated  structures.  The  sediments  along  the  main  and  interfarm  canals  will  be \nremoved by ALRI using machinery to be procured under the project, while WUAs and farmers \nwill  remove  the  sediment  along  on-farm  I&D  canals.  The  capacities  of  canals  have  been \nchecked against the climate change risks anticipated during the next 50 years and augmented \nwhere  required.  With  modernization  and  rehabilitation,  irrigation  conveyance  efficiency  will \nincrease from the present 60% to 66% for gravity-fed systems and 82% for pump-fed systems. \n \n16. \nThe second component will reduce the CIS O&M requirements by hydraulically flushing \naround 70% of total sediment entering the main canal and mechanically removing around 15%. \nUnder the third component, two cascade pump systems (Urtaboz covering 5,700 ha and Janubi \ncovering 2,600 ha) out of four systems covering 14,344 ha will be modernized and rehabilitated. \nEnergy efficiency of target pump units will increase from less than 50% at present to more than \n75%. In addition,  a feasibility  study  will  explore  alternative  cost-efficient  water supply  methods \nfor  the  irrigated  area  under  nontargeted  pump  systems.  Under  the  fourth  component,  the \ncapacities  of  local  ALRI  offices,  including  the  WUA  support  unit,  will  improve  to  perform  their \nduties  (e.g.,  water  and  sediment  flow  monitoring  and  recording,  monitoring  and  evaluation \n[M&E] of irrigation performance, O&M of CIS main infrastructure) efficiently and effectively with \nprovision of necessary equipment, training, and an M&E system to operate it. ALRI central staff \nwill also be trained to operate the M&E system.    \n \nOutput  3:  Farm  management  capacity  and  water  use  skill  improved.  This  output \n17. \nunder  the  JFPR  grant  includes  (i)  demonstration  to  promote  profitable  farm  management  and \nefficient  water  use,  (ii)  production  of  high-quality  seeds,  and  (iii)  establishment  and  possible \nreorganization  of  WUAs  and  capacity  development  of  WUAs  and  beneficiaries.  Experienced \n\n                                                \n17 The same approach is expected from the Afghanistan side under the investment project (Project number 48042-\n001, Proposed Grant and Administration of Grant for Pyanj\u2013Amu Basin Project) currently being prepared by ADB.  \n\n\finternational  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  will  be  recruited  for  required  activities. \nUnder  the  first  component,  300  ha  of  demonstration  plots  will  promote  more  profitable  farm \nmanagement  using improved  agronomic techniques  (e.g.,  drill  sowing  without  plowing,  zero  or \nminimum tillage) conducive for higher productivity and profitability per unit of farmland and more \nefficient  water  use techniques,  and  NGOs  will  disseminate  demonstrated  activities  among  CIS \nfarmers by conducting workshops and other efficient methods.   \n \n18. \nThe second component will (i) supply foundation seed to seed growers and facilitate the \nreproduction of the seeds, and also supply a large number of smaller farmers; (ii) diversify seed \nproduction  for  vegetable,  fruit,  and  other  crops  in  addition  to  production  of  wheat  and  cotton \nseeds;  (iii)  develop  capacity  of  the  seed  growers  in  seed  production;  and  (iv)  reestablish  field \nseed laboratories at district offices of the department of agriculture and develop their capacity to \ncertify the seeds. The third component will (i) strengthen WUAs\u2019 institutional, management, and \ntechnical  capacities;  (ii)  support  WUAs\u2019  possible  reorganization  along  hydrological  boundaries \nfor  efficient  water  management;  and  (iii)  facilitate  formation  of  new  WUAs  in  the  remaining \nproject area. At present there are only 20 WUAs covering about 83% of the CIS area, and they \nare not adequately equipped and trained to undertake their tasks efficiently, which has resulted \nin the low collection rate of the irrigation service fee (average 46% in project districts in 2012\u2013\n2014).  Activities  of  NGOs  will  be  coordinated  with  WUA  support  unit,  whose  capacity  will  be \nstrengthened under output 2. \n\n \n19. \nDuring  project  preparation,  an  M&E  system  using  satellite  remote  sensing  technology \nwas developed and it estimated the water consumption and average water use ratio (i.e., field \napplication efficiency) of CIS farmland at 50%. Output 3 will increase the ratio to 60%. Coupled \nwith monitoring  water  withdrawal  for  the  CIS,  the system  could  also estimate  CIS  conveyance \nefficiency (para. 15). The M&E system will be further improved under output 3 and used during \nproject implementation to assess irrigation efficiencies.        \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $31.61 million (Table 1). \n\nD. \n \n20. \n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nAmounta \n\n  \n\n                                                                                       Subtotal (A) \n\nItem \nA.

The sediment-excluding \nbasin will  substantially  reduce O&M  requirements  not  only  at the main,  interfarm,  and  on-farm \ncanals  but  also  at  the  basin  itself  by  hydraulically  flushing  around  70%  of  the  sediment  that \nenters. The target pump units  were selected using carefully developed criteria, which included \nrequired pumping head. The project was found to be at high risk of being impacted by climate \nchange. Climate risk and vulnerability was assessed based on a study undertaken by previous \nADB TA in the PRB (footnote 6). Adaptation measures were incorporated in the project design \nto reduce the risks resulting from increased demand in irrigation water, and sedimentation.   \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial  \n\n \n25. \nThe project is expected to be economically viable in that the overall calculated economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) is 16.3% and the economic net present value of the investment is \nTJS105.7 million at a discount rate of 12%. This strong economic result is due to the substantial \nsize  of  the  economic  benefit  stream  resulting  from  carefully  designed  least-cost  engineering \n\n                                                \n20 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\foptions.21 A number of risk variables have been used to conduct a sensitivity analysis. Based on \nthe  sensitivity  analysis,  the  project  viability  is  observed  to  be  most  sensitive  to  benefits  being \ndelayed  by  2  years,  which  causes  the  EIRR  to  fall  to  13.6%\u2014just  marginally  above  the \nbenchmark  of  12.0%\u2014and  the  level  of  decrease  at  which  the  EIRR  would  fall  below  the \nacceptable 12.0% level is only 3 years. Therefore, it is essential that the project be implemented \nas  scheduled  and  technical  and  extension  support  be  provided  to  project  beneficiaries  as \nproposed under output 3 in order to ensure project benefits are realized on schedule. It is also \nimportant  to  stress  that  system  O&M  needs  to  be  carried  out  appropriately  to  ensure  the \nbenefits can materialize as estimated. 22 \n \nC. \n \n26.  Weaknesses  and  risks  were \nfinancial \nmanagement  system  in  internal  control,  procurement  management,  financial  reporting,  and \nexternal  auditing.  The  existing  project  management  office  under  ALRI  for  the  ongoing  ADB-\nfinanced project has gained enough experience in implementing projects financed by ADB and \nthus  will  comfortably  implement  outputs  2  and  3.23 Additional  project  management  office  staff \nwill be recruited for the additional workload. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) was explained to and discussed with the government, the MEWR, and ALRI. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n\nthe  country\u2019s  public \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nGovernance \n\nin  using \n\nidentified \n\n \n27. \nPoverty.  The  project  will  address  the  problems  of  low  agricultural  yields,  low  income, \nand food  insecurity  in the  target  areas.  Establishing river  basin  organizations  and  councils  will \nresult  in  improved  WRM.  Modernizing  and  rehabilitating  I&D  systems  will  address  water \nshortages,  while  organizing  demonstration  plots,  producing  high-quality  seeds,  and \nstrengthening WUAs\u2019 capacities will improve water use and farmers\u2019 agricultural skills. This, in \nturn, will lead to increased agricultural yields and improved farmers\u2019 incomes, and address long-\nterm food insecurity. \n \n28. \nSocial  and  gender. The project will directly benefit farmers, including women farmers, \nand  poor  households.  Specifically,  the  project  will  improve  WRM  through  WUAs  and  improve \nfarmers\u2019 capacity for water use and their agricultural practices. Categorized as effective gender \nmainstreaming, the project will narrow gender gaps in women\u2019s limited representation in WUAs, \nriver basin organizations, and councils. It will ensure that women farmers are not left out in the \ndevelopment  of  demonstration  farms,  production  of  high-quality  seeds,  and  other  training \nprograms  aimed  at  building  women\u2019s  capacities  to  take  on  more  active  roles  in  WUAs  and \nimprove their farming practices. The project will also ease women\u2019s water-fetching chores as it \nwill  install  12  water  points  for  householder  use  along  the  main  canal  and  three  in  each  target \ninterfarm canal. \n \nE. \n \nEnvironment  (category  B).

Manila.  \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fStatement  (2009).  Anticipated  major  adverse  environmental  impacts  of  the  project  are  site \nspecific  and  are  related  to  clogging  of  canals  and  irrigation  structures  with  sediment  during \noperation; and physical disturbance, noise, and road safety during transportation of construction \nmaterials for the sediment-excluding basin. Adequate mitigation measures will be incorporated \ninto  the  project  design  and  will  be  implemented  through the  environmental  management  plan. \nThe initial environmental examination includes provisions for improving the safeguards capacity \nof  the  project  management  office.  Public  consultation  (a  total  of  117  people  including  WUAs, \nvillage  leaders,  farmer  beneficiaries,  local  authorities,  and  ALRI  local  offices)  and  information \ndisclosure  was  undertaken  in  March  2015  covering  all  four  districts.  The  draft  initial \nenvironmental examination covering the environmental management plan was disclosed on the \nADB website on 16 February 2016. \n \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The  project  will  not  involve  or  affect  any  ethnic \n30. \nminority or indigenous peoples, as defined by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The poverty \nand  social  assessment  study  showed  that  no  ethnic  minority  or  indigenous  peoples  were \npresent in the project area. \n \n31. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  C).  The  project  will  not  require  land  acquisition. \nThe  sediment-excluding  basin  will  be  constructed  within  the  border  area,  which  is  strictly \ncontrolled.  These  areas  have  been  fenced  since  1994.  Since  the  project  is  within  the  existing \nfacilities,  the  resettlement  due  diligence  report  confirmed  that  no  land  will  be  acquired  for  the \nproject  with  no  past  and  present  claims  on  the  land  for  these  existing  facilities.  The  due \ndiligence report was disclosed on the ADB website in February 2016. \n \nF. \n \n32.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.24 The integrated benefits and impacts of the \nproject are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe project will be audited annually by independent private auditors in accordance with \nthe International Standards on Auditing. \n\nInsufficient available funds \nfor system O&M may \nthreaten CIS sustainability \n \n\nUsing advance contracting, the consultant for detailed design, bid preparation, and \nconstruction supervision will be fielded from January 2017 to enable the PMO to initiate \nbid process for the major contract in the second quarter of 2017.
