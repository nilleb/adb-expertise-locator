The  report  also  describes  proposed  capacity \ndevelopment \nfor  Decentralized  Public  Service  and  Financial \nManagement,  and  if the Board  approves the  proposed  programmatic  approach,  policy-based  loan, \nand loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the CDTA.1 \n \n2.  \nThe  program  seeks  to  improve  public  service  delivery  by  supporting  the  development  of \nefficient and accountable subnational administrations. The program comprises policy-based lending \nand project lending. In close alignment with the Government of Cambodia\u2019s subnational democratic \ndevelopment  reforms,  the  program  will  (i)  assist  in  the  development  of  the  policy  and  regulatory \nframework  for  decentralization,  (ii)  provide  selected  rural  districts  with  offices  for  their  operations, \nand (iii) contribute to the development of financial management capacity in central and subnational \npublic administrations.2   \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3.  \nUneven  distribution  of  economic  growth  and  large  disparities  in  poverty  reduction. \nTerritorial  development  disparities  across  Cambodia  are  partly  the  result  of  the  country\u2019s  narrow \nbase for economic growth and a historical deficit of infrastructure investment in rural areas, but are \nalso  a  result  of  weak  service  delivery  mechanisms.  Robust  economic  growth  between  1998  and \n2007  has  resulted  in  substantially  reduced  poverty  rates,  from  47%  in  1993  to  30%  in  2007. \nHowever,  in  a  pattern  common  to  other  Southeast  Asian  nations,  economic  growth  has  been \naccompanied  by  significant  increases  in  income  inequality  and  an  uneven  distribution  of \ndevelopment  gains.  In  2007  rural  areas  of  Cambodia  displayed  poverty  rates  of  about  35%  and \naccounted for 91% of the poor. By comparison, only about 9% of the poor live in urban areas, with \naverage poverty rates of 22% (less than 1% of the population in Phnom Penh is poor).3   \n \n4.   Weak  service  delivery  mechanisms  and  a  fledging  culture  of  local  participatory \ndemocracy.  Greater  disparities  are  observed  in  access  to  basic  services.  The  percentage  of \nfamilies  with  access  to  safe  drinking  water  varies  from  92%  in  Phnom  Penh  to  less  than  30%  in \nMondul  Kiri  Province.  The  average  distance  from  a  village  to  a  health  center  in  Stung  Treng \nProvince  is  25 kilometers  (km),  compared  with  a national  average  of  less  than  5 km.  Largely  as  a \nresult of limited access to services, human development indicators for rural areas lag behind those \nof  urban  areas.  Infant  mortality  rates  are  about  three  times  higher  in  rural  areas  (64  deaths  per \n1,000  children)  than  urban  areas  (22  deaths  per  1,000  children).4\n An  inefficient  mix  of  centralized \nand deconcentrated mechanisms limits the capacity of government to match service delivery to local \nneeds.5\n Local  planning  and budget formulation  systems  do  not  yet fully  incorporate  the  needs  and \npreferences of local constituencies. This limits the capacity of local populations to hold  subnational \nadministrations  (SNAs)  accountable  for  their  performance.  In  addition,  there  is  a  lack  of  both \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided policy and advisory TA.

The \ngovernment is committed to tackling local development disparities by creating democratically elected \nSNAs  that  meet  locally  defined  priorities  in  service  delivery.  The  policy  framework  for  reforms  is \ncontained  in  the  National  Program  for  Subnational  Democratic  Development  (NP-SNDD)  2010\u2013\n2019.6  Efforts  toward  subnational  democratic  development  in  Cambodia  began  with  the  2001 \nOrganic  Law  on  Commune/Sangkat  Administrative  Management,  which  allowed  for  the  direct \nelection  of  councilors.  Since  2002,  commune  councils  have  gained  legitimacy  as  the  local \nrepresentatives,  and  their  share  of  expenditure  has  increased  from  1.5%  of  domestic  revenues  to \n2.7%  by  2008.  The  current  wave  of  reforms\u2014initiated  in  2008  with  the  Organic  Law  on  Capital, \nProvinces,  Municipalities,  Districts,  and  Khans\u2014extends  subnational  democratic  development \nreforms  to  the  district  and  municipal  level  of  administration.  Having  established  democratically \nelected  SNAs,  the  policy  reform  focus  is  on  the  regulatory  framework  for  intergovernmental  fiscal \nrelations, and on administrative decentralization. District and municipal councils lack clear functional \nresponsibilities,  an  adequate  financing  system,  and,  often,  even  premises  to  operate  from.  In \naddition, SNAs need substantial capacity development to ensure their efficient operation.  \n \n6.  \nLessons  learned  from  Asian  Development  Bank  sector  experience.  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) initiated its assistance to subnational democratic development reforms in \nCambodia  through  the  Commune  Council  Development  Project.7  Under  the  two  phases  of  the \nproject,  697  commune  centers  were  built,  capacity  development  for  commune  councils  was \nprovided,  and a  civil  registration  system  was implemented. The  centers have  facilitated good  local \ngovernance at the commune level. The project delegated procurement and contract implementation \nresponsibilities to the commune councils, helping build their project management skills and assisting \nlocal  ownership.8\nfor \nthe  regulatory \nintergovernmental  fiscal  relations  in  Cambodia.9\n  Technical  assistance  has  been  provided  for  the \npreparation  of  the  Subnational  Finance  Law  2011,  the  District  Municipal  Transfer  Fund,  and  the \nSub-Decree  on  Functional  Assignments,  among  other  regulations.  Coordination  of  activities \nbetween the National Committee for Democratic Development at the Subnational Level Secretariat \n(NCDD-S), the Ministry of Interior (MOI), and the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) has been \nessential  for  efficient  delivery  of  advisory  assistance.  ADB\u2019s  TA  has  also  underlined  the  large \ncapacity development needs of SNAs, and the importance of providing adequate support to the line \nministries that  will  pilot  future functional  assignments to SNAs.  Support for  subnational  democratic \ndevelopment  reforms  has  been  identified  as  a  crosscutting  theme  by  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy 2012\u20132015.10 The reforms will impact many other parallel efforts assisted by ADB, such as \npublic  financial  management  reforms,11  and  may  also  aid  work  in  sectors  such  as  education, \nagriculture, and rural development. \n\n  ADB  has  supported \n\nthe  development  of \n\nframework \n\n                                                \n6    The  Strategic  Framework   for  Decentralization  and  Deconcentration   Reforms  2005  provided  an  earlier  policy \n\nreference. \n\n7      ADB.  2006.

Manila (Grant 0066-CAM, for  $7.80 \nmillion, approved on 12 December). \n\n8    The  design  of  the  project  under  subprogram  1  draws  heavily  on  other  best  practices  from  the  Commune  Council \nDevelopment  Project,  in  particular  with  regard  to  implementation  arrangements  (i.e.,  project  delegation  to  ADB\u2019s \nresident mission, disbursement of block grants to SNAs through private financial institutions, community participation in \nproject monitoring, and others).  \n\n9    ADB.  2009.

The comprehensive nature of the subnational \ndemocratic  development  policy  reforms  needs to  be  supported  by  adequate  investments  on  public \ninfrastructure  and  institutional  capacity  that  allow  district  administrations  to  assume  their  future \nresponsibilities  in  service  delivery.  The  sector  development  program  lending  modality  best \narticulates  these  needs  while  offering  a  framework  for  ADB\u2019s  long-term  support  to  reforms. \nCoordination  with  development  partners  has  been  fruitful.  The  policy  matrix  has  received \ndevelopment partner contributions through several meetings of the donors\u2019 working group, currently \ncochaired by ADB. The program has been discussed with civil society organizations, benefiting from \ntheir inputs on areas such as project implementation arrangements and management of grievances. \n \nB. \n \n8. \nThe expected impact of the program  is improved access to and coverage of basic services \nacross  the  country.12  The  expected  outcome  is  an  efficient  system  of  intergovernmental  fiscal \nrelations that assists service delivery by SNAs.13 The proposed subprogram includes a policy-based \nloan  and  a  project  loan.  The  policy-based  loan  includes  29  reform  actions  (10  triggers  and  19 \nmilestones)  that  the  government  completed  during  2010\u20132012.  The  project  loan  will  provide \nassistance to the construction of rural district offices and institutional and capacity development for \nlocal public financial management.  \n \nC. \n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nPolicy-Based Loan Outputs \n\nThe  policy-based  loan  is  structured  around  seven  major  outputs  covering  all  key  areas  of \n\n \n9. \nreform:  \n\n(i) \n\ndevelopment and regular update of a gender-sensitive policy and regulatory framework   \nfor decentralization, \n\n(ii)  establishment  of  institutions  for  efficient  coordination  of  subnational  democratic \n\ndevelopment policies, \n\n(iii)  definition of clear service delivery responsibilities of SNAs, \n(iv)  assignment of efficient tax and nontax revenue sources to SNAs, \n(v) \n\nimplementation  of  fiscal  transfers  that  ensure  comparable  levels  of  service  delivery \nacross SNAs,  \n\n(vi)  development of capacities for efficient decentralized public financial management, and  \ntheir \nimplementation  of  accountability  mechanisms \n(vii)  design  and \n\nfor  SNAs \n\nto \n\nconstituencies.  \n\n \n\nEach  of  the  outputs  includes  triggers  and  milestones  that  are  drawn  from  the  Three-Year \n10. \nImplementation  Plan  (IP3)  for  the  NP-SNDD.  Accomplishment  of  several  of  the  triggers  and \nmilestones  included  in  subprogram  2  is  expected  as  early  as  late  2012,  effectively  sequencing \nreforms during the full subprogram period. \n \n11. \nDevelopment and regular update of gender-sensitive policy and regulatory framework \nfor  decentralization.  The  government  has  made  substantive  progress  in  developing  an  efficient \npolicy  and  regulatory  framework  for  reforms  where  gender  considerations  are  mainstreamed.  The \nNP-SNDD (2010\u20132019) has been approved, together with the first IP3. The IP3 mainstreams gender  \nin  subnational  democratic  development  reforms  and gender experts have  been appointed at  the  \nNCDD-S. Subprogram 2 of the cluster will assist development of the second gender-responsive IP3 \n(2014\u20132016) and the preparation of midterm reviews. \n \n\n                                                \n12   Including basic health and sanitation services, rural road rehabilitation, and agricultural extension.  \n13  The impact and outcome statements are common to the policy-based loan and the project loan of subprogram 1. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n4\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n\fEstablishment  of \n\ntax  and  nontax \n\nrevenue  sources \n\nAssignment  of  efficient \n\n12. \ninstitutions  for  efficient  coordination  and  policy  design  of \nsubnational  democratic  development  policies.  The  Subdecree  on  the  Establishment  and \nFunctioning of the NCDD-S was approved in December 2011 in order to (i) establish the mandate of \nthe  NCDD-S  to  generate  decentralization  and  deconcentration  policy,  (ii)  reorganize  divisions \nand offices to better align them with the NP-SNDD, and (iii) create permanent civil service positions. \nAll  subcommittees  of  the  NCDD-S  are  fully  appointed  and  hold  meetings  as  required.  A  draft \nstrategy  for  gender-responsive  human  resource  management  at  the  subnational  level  has  been \nprepared  and  is  being  discussed  by  the  NCDD-S  subcommittee  on  personnel.  Subprogram  2  will \nsupport the development of a civil service code for SNAs that strives for gender equity in civil service \nrecruitment  and  the  strengthening  of  the  NCDD-S  as  the  lead  agency  for  decentralization  and \ndeconcentration reforms. \n \n13. \nDefinition of clear responsibilities for service delivery of subnational administrations. \nThe  government  has  approved  a  subdecree  on  a  strategy  for  functional  assignments  and,  with \npriority  ministries,  is  piloting  manuals  for  gender-responsive  functional  mapping  and  reviews.  The \nNCDD  subcommittee  on  functional  assignments  and  resources  is  in  operation.  Subprogram  2  will \nassist the piloting of the first functional assignments to SNAs, once functional mapping and review \nprocesses in priority ministries are completed. \n \n14. \nto  subnational \nadministrations.  With  the  introduction  of  Ministerial  Order  371  of  2011,  the  government  has \nauthorized  the  collection  of  property  tax  at  the  provincial  level.  The  government  continues  to \nevaluate potential sources of own revenues for SNAs. Subprogram 2 will support the development \nof a subdecree on revenue assignments (tax and nontax to SNAs).  \n \nImplementation  of  fiscal  transfers  that  ensure  comparable  levels  of  service  delivery \n15. \nacross  subnational  administrations.  The  government  has  approved  the  creation  of  the  District \nand Municipal Fund. The fund includes the definition of a formula-based development component for \ndiscretionary  expenditure  of  districts  and  municipalities.  For  subprogram  2,  the  government  will \ndesign the system of conditional grants for delegated functions to SNAs. In addition, the government \nwill establish the Subnational Investment Facility (SNIF), a complementary element of the financing \nsystem  of  SNAs. The  SNIF  will  aim  to  mobilize  financial  resources for  local  investment  projects  in \nkey  development  sectors.  A  competitive  project  selection  system  will  reward  good  project \npreparation, and capacity development assistance will be provided to weaker SNAs.  \n \n16. \nDevelopment  of  capacities  for  efficient  decentralized  public  financial  management. \nThe  government  has  approved  the  Law  on  Financial  Regime  and  Property  Management  of  Sub-\nNational  Administrations  that  provides  the  structure  of  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations.  The \nimplementation of the law is assisted by the Sub-Decree on Financial Management procedures and \nassociated  regulations.  Subprogram  2  will  assist  the  further  implementation  of  the  subdecree  with \nthe  approval  of  regulations  for  the  subnational  budget  classification  and  chart  of  accounts;  the \nguidelines for budget preparation, execution, and audit; and accounting and payment procedures. In \naddition,  the  capacity  of  the  National  Audit  Authority  for  SNA  audit  and  the  capacities  of  local \nfinancial  officers  and central  government  departments  on  SNA  financial  management  systems  will \nbe strengthened.  \n \n17. \nfor  subnational \nadministrations  to  their  constituencies.  The  government  has  finalized  and  is  piloting  technical \nmanuals  on  SNA  council  meetings  and  public  forums  that  promote  the  equal  participation  of  men \nand women. In addition, the government has conducted the first training of trainers for 79 facilitators \nto assist dissemination of the manuals to all districts and municipalities. The NCDD-S has developed \na district charter template, which will be piloted in the second half of 2012, providing a guideline for \nthe  preparation  of  district  charters  as  stipulated  by  the  Organic  Law  of  2008.

The  districts  will  be  selected  on  the \ncriteria of poverty, population, and state of premises. The project will not entail any land acquisition. \nOnly public land, upon presentation of the land title, will be used for construction. Upon signing of a \nblock allocation agreement between the district authorities and the MOI, district authorities will take \nfull  responsibility  for  procurement,15  contract  implementation,  and  processing  interim  payments \nbased on progress at sites. Initial orientation and procurement training will be provided to selected \ndistricts to ensure their capacities are built.16  \n\n \nOutput  2:  Efficient  system  of \n\n19. \nfiscal  relations  developed; \nexpenditure  and  revenue  assignments  and  fiscal  transfers  designed  and  implemented. \nAdvisory assistance provided to the MEF will include support to the development of a medium- and \nlong-term strategic road map for fiscal decentralization in Cambodia, the definition of tax and nontax \nrevenue assignments to SNAs, and the review and design of conditional and unconditional transfers. \nConsultants will be recruited using ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n\nintergovernmental \n\n \nOutput  3:  Development  of  the  Subnational  Investment  Facility. The project will support \n20. \nthe development of the SNIF, designed to mobilize resources for local investment projects through \ncompetitive procedures. The package of outputs will include, as required, technical support to draft \nthe regulations on the SNIF, its operational guidelines, the terms of reference for the facility\u2019s staff, \nand  advisory  services  for  pilot  testing  and  initial  implementation.  The  government  is  committed  to \nensure the SNIF is in full operation by 2014. \n\n \n21. \n Output  4:  Capacities  for  efficient  decentralized  public  financial  management \ndeveloped. The  project will  enhance  the financial  management  oversight, monitoring,  and support \ncapacity  of  SNAs  by  the  MEF and its  provincial  departments.

The  key  considerations  include  the  potential  importance  of  the  sector  to  the \neconomy, as subnational public expenditure is expected to reach close to 20% of total government \nexpenditure over the life of the NP-SNDD. The reform program includes several politically sensitive \nand  complex  policy  and  institutional  reforms.  To  support  the  reforms,  the  program  loan  provides \nleverage to the executing and implementing agencies to support implementation. The program loan \nalso reflects the government\u2019s development financing needs  as well as the need to conform to the \noverall financing requirement from the country partnership strategy period.  \n \nB. \n \n28. \nAn  assessment  of  the  country\u2019s  financial  management  systems  was  conducted  to \nunderstand fiduciary risks and determine appropriate fiduciary arrangements for the purposes of this \noperation.23 On the basis of these evaluations, the country\u2019s public financial management systems \nhave been found adequate. An external assessment of the NCDD-S was undertaken to evaluate its \ncapacity  to  manage  decentralized  reforms.  The  report  concluded  that  internal  control  is  not  fully \nestablished  or  operational  in  the  secretariat,  whereas  accounting  and  external  audit  functions  and \nprocurement  systems  are  well  established  and  operate  to  a  satisfactory  degree.24  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ngovernment,  NCDD-S,  MEF,  and  MOI.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 19). \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nC. \n \n29. \nSubnational democratic development reforms in Cambodia are expected to assist economic \ngrowth  and  poverty  reduction  through  a  variety  of  channels:  (i)  higher  economic  growth  through \nallocative efficiency in the delivery of public services to the poor, (ii) productive efficiency in service \ndelivery,  and  (iii)  providing  incentives  for  improved  revenue  collection  and  public  expenditure. \nEfficiency gains in public spending from reassignment of expenditure functions to local government \nmay boost growth and reduce inequality. Local economic development can also be assisted if local \ngovernments  increase  the  scope  and  improve  the quality  of  public  infrastructure  spending,  and  as \nnew financing instruments for investment, such as the SNIF, are implemented. The second channel \nis  through  the  impact  of  potentially  higher  productive  efficiency  in  the  delivery  of  basic  services  at \nthe  local  level.  The  use  of  local  contractors  and  local  materials  for  delivery  of  local  services  may \noffer  important  savings  in  public  expenditure.  Finally,  the  third  channel  refers  to  the  incentives  for \nrevenue  mobilization  (and  thus  local  public  expenditure)  from  the  assignment  of  own  revenue \nsources to SNAs. Local populations may be more willing to contribute from tax and nontax sources if \nthey know those revenues will be used for local service delivery.  \n \n30. \nGender  and  subnational  democratic  development.  The  program  is  categorized  as \neffective gender mainstreaming. The key gender impacts of the program include increased women\u2019s \nparticipation  in  planning  and  administrative  functions  in  district  and  municipal  structures;  greater \nintegration of women\u2019s needs and priorities in the development of legislation, policies, and programs \nrelated  to subnational  democratic  development; strengthened gender  awareness and capacities of \nmale and female civil servants; and gender-sensitive development planning and resource allocation \nto  support  the  delivery  of  services  which  address  the  specific  needs  and  interests  of  men  and \nwomen  in  the  community.  The  policies  supported  by  subprogram  1  ensure  that  (i)  gender  is \n\n                                                \n22    The  Program  Impact  Assessment  (accessible  from  the  list  of linked documents)  provides  detailed information on  the \n\nestimates of benefits and costs. \n\n23    The  fiduciary  assessment  relies  on  the  recent  substantive  diagnostic  work  including  the  Cambodia  governance  risk      \nassessment  and  risk  management  plan,  public  finance  management  assessment  based  on  the  public  expenditure \nfinancial accountability framework, and external review of the government\u2019s Financial Management Reform Program. \n24    European  Commission  Development  and  Cooperation.  2011.  Assessment  Concerning  Decentralized  Management.   \n\nPhnom Penh. \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nSafeguards \n\nmainstreamed  into  the  IP3  and  gender  functions  are  integrated  in  the  annual  work  plans  and \nbudgets  of  the  six  implementing  agencies;  (ii)  the  NCDD-S  is  supported  by  gender  experts,  (iii)  a \ndraft  gender-responsive  human  resource  strategy  is  developed  to  increase  women\u2019s  entry  and \npromotion  within  the  civil  service,  (iv)  manuals  developed  for  functional  mapping  and  reviews \nintegrate  gender  mainstreaming  needs  in  the  priority  ministries,  and  (v)  guidelines  for  council \ndeliberations  promote  gender-sensitive  processes  and  all  women  councilors  are  trained  on  the \ntools.25  \n \nD. \n \n31. \nSafeguards due diligence and review of the policy matrix show that policy actions will have \nno  impacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  Similarly,  due \ndiligence  and  review  show  that  the  project  will  not  have  impacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples. The project is categorized C for all safeguards. \n  \n32. \nThere  will  be  no  land  acquisition  as  subproject  works  are  restricted  to  existing  government \nland. All land to be used will have clear titles and be free of all encumbrances. These lands are not \noccupied  or  productively  used  by  legal  or  nontitled  occupants.  The  subproject  selection  criteria \nensure  that  any  proposed  subproject  with  any  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples \nimpacts  will  not  be  included  as  part  of  the  project.  The  subproject  selection  criterion  also  requires \nthat proposed subprojects have no environmental impacts other than minimal adverse impacts.  \n\n \n33. \nThe implementing agencies will categorize all proposed subprojects to ensure that they are \ncategory  C  for  all  safeguards.  Review  and  field  visits  for  sample  subprojects  confirm  that \nenvironmental implications are limited to standard small-scale impacts of constructing single or two-\nstory  administration  buildings  for  50\u201380  persons,  and  provision  of  equipment.  Environmental \nmanagement plans containing environmental guidelines were developed during program processing \nto  establish  rules,  procedures,  and  institutional  arrangements  to  be  undertaken  with  regard  to \nidentifying,  monitoring,  and  mitigating  adverse  environmental  impacts  due  to  small  civil  works \nactivities.  The  guidelines  include  a  construction  site  checklist,  environmental  design  criteria,  and \nstandardized  environmental  management  plans.  The  guidelines  will  be  implemented  by  the \nimplementing agency supported by the project implementation unit. Consultations were undertaken \nwith  stakeholders  during  program  processing,  including  consulting  with  women  to  ascertain  their \nviews on appropriate design of  administration buildings. Since the program is categorized C for all \nsafeguards, no safeguards documents are required to be disclosed on ADB\u2019s website.  \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nE. \n \n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures include losing reform momentum, and lack of adequate \nfinancial and institutional support to the NCDD-S. The reforms are complex from a technical point of \nview, comprehensive in their approach, and involve most central government agencies and all levels \nof  administration.  Through  the  attached  TA,  the  recently  created  NCDD  will  receive  advisory \nassistance on several of the key reforms outlined for subprogram 2 of the programmatic approach, \nsupplemented  by  continued  policy  dialogue  with  ADB.  Greater  detail  on  fiduciary  risks  to  efficient \nprogram  implementation  is  provided  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.26  Among \nfinancial \nthem,  development  and \nmanagement systems (including budget formulation and audit processes) is of key importance. The \nattached TA will assist the dissemination of new regulations and the training of subnational staff on \nsuch  procedures.  A  comprehensive  governance  and  fiduciary  risk  assessment  of  the  SNIF  will  be \nprepared during design to ensure that (i) the proposed facility is aligned with the reform objectives \nand  national  and  local  development  priorities,  (ii)  the  SNIF  does  not  incorporate  risks  to  the \n\nfor  subnational  public \n\nimplementation  of \n\nthe  regulation \n\n                                                \n25  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n4\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\n\f10    \n\nmacroeconomic stability  of the  country,27  and (iii)  the  selection  and financing  of  projects  under  the \nfacility  follow  accountable  and  transparent  mechanisms  in  line  with  best  public  financial \nmanagement practices. Efficient reforms will also require adequate MEF capacity for oversight and \nmonitoring  of  local  finances,  which  the  program  will  support  through  the  institutional  and  capacity \nbuilding component of the project loan.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \n\n35. \nThe  government  and  NCDD-S  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  detail  in \nthe PAM and loan documents. The government and NCDD-S have also agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the program, which are set forth in the loan agreements.  \n \n36. \nThe government has agreed that the project loan amount for output 1 will not be disbursed \nuntil:  a)  the  process  of  establishing  the  project  technical  cell  has  been  initiated  as  detailed  in  the \nproject  loan  agreement  and  b)  the  instructions  for  the  creation  of  the  procurement  review \ncommittees  and  bid  evaluation  committee  for  Project  Districts  are  approved.
