Ltd. (MFLC).  \n \n2. \nThe  main  reason  for  grouping  both  transactions  into  one  project  is  for  operational \nefficiency.  Given  the  geographical  proximity  of  the  two  countries  and  the  similarities  of  the \nunderlying business of each company (i.e., leasing to small and medium enterprises [SMEs]), it \nwas felt that it would be more cost and resource efficient to process the two components in one \nRRP.  Each  project  will,  however,  be  recorded  separately  in  the  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment\u2019s systems and balance sheet and will be monitored on an individual basis.  \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n\nA. \n\nProblems Affecting the Small and Medium Enterprises Sector in Sri Lanka and the \nMaldives \n\n1. \n\nSri Lanka \n\nSMEs  play  a  significant  role  in  the  economy  of  Sri  Lanka  and  are  key  drivers  of \n3. \nemployment, economic growth, and development. However, more than 80% of the SMEs in Sri \nLanka have difficulty accessing financial services and securing financing. That is mainly due to \n(i) a strong risk aversion among the banks in the country with respect to SME lending; and (ii) \nthe  absence  of  a  diversified  financial  sector  capable  of  serving  SMEs,  which  is  due  in  part  to \nweaknesses in the judicial system as it applies to registering and enforcing security interests.1 \n \nThe results of a recent survey carried out by ADB and the World Bank2 indicate that the \n4. \ncost of finance impedes urban and rural firms alike, with almost a third of urban firms and rural \nbusinesses  citing  it  as  a  major  constraint.  Small,  urban  manufacturing  firms  pay  significantly \nhigher average interest rates (18%) than do large ones (12%). They also pay higher rates than \ndo rural enterprises (14.5%), which benefit from subsidies from some state financial institutions \nand  microfinance  institutions.  (These  subsidies,  however,  threaten  the  viability  of  these \ninstitutions.)  With  support  from  international  funding  agencies,  commercial  banks  have  started \nto enter the market for SME finance, although their lending remains concentrated in Colombo. \nBecause  of  these  distortions,  interest  rates  in  rural  areas  vary  widely.  Moreover,  the \nGovernment of Sri Lanka\u2019s high and persistent budget deficits add to the cost of finance, as the \nGovernment crowds out the private sector to meet its borrowing requirements.  \n \n5. \nRural enterprises avail themselves of external finance but have extremely limited access \nto formal finance. They obtain most of their financing for new investments from internal sources \n(43%)  and  family  and  friends  (35%).  Public  financial  institutions,  despite  their  widespread \npresence  in  rural  areas,  account  for  a  far  smaller  share  of  rural  investment  finance.  Private \ncommercial banks provide a minimal share (2%), and mostly to larger enterprises. For firms with \ninadequate  external  finance,  the  consequence  is  limited  opportunities  for  growth.  Collateral  in \nthe  form  of  land  is  especially  important  for  rural  enterprises.  For  many  rural  entrepreneurs, \nhowever,  high  levels  of  public  landownership,  unclear  ownership  records,  and  widespread \n\n                                                      \n1  ADB. 2005. Sri Lanka Financial Sector Assessment. Manila. \n2  ADB and World Bank. 2004. Investment Climate Assessment. Washington D.C. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nrestrictions on the use and transfer of land make it difficult to use land as collateral, thus limiting \naccess to external finance. \n \n\n2. \n\nThe Maldives \n\nA recent survey carried out by the World Bank3 showed that most of the 2,500 registered \n6. \nSMEs  in  the  Maldives  are  quite  small,  with  an  average  turnover  of  less  than  $80,000  per \nannum. Their activities were generally limited to a very few economic sectors: tourism, fisheries, \nmanufacturing,  transport,  and  related  services.  Most  of  them  are  located  in  the  capital,  Male, \nwhich accounts for 27% of the total population. \n \n7. \nAmong  the  major  obstacles  mentioned,  more  than  65%  of  all  respondents  identified  a \nlack of access to finance as the most important and most severe constraint affecting enterprise \nperformance. The financial sector is shallow and the banks in the Maldives have been following \na very conservative approach that has a high exposure to the tourism sector. The commercial \nbanks are still focused on collateral rather than on cash-based lending, and there are no venture \ncapital companies in the country to support emerging entrepreneurs in the various SME sectors. \nMoreover,  there  is  no  credit  information  system  or  bureau  that  would  facilitate  lending,  and \nespecially to new borrowers. \n \nB. \n\nThe Financial Sector in Sri Lanka and the Maldives \n\nAs of the end 2005,4 the Sri Lankan financial sector had 22 licensed commercial banks \n8. \n(11  domestic  private  banks  and  11  foreign),  2  state  banks,  26  registered  finance  companies, \nand 14 licensed specialized banks (2 development finance institutions, 1 national savings bank, \n3  housing  finance  institutions,  2  private  savings  and  development  banks,  and  6  regional \ndevelopment banks).  \n \nThe  two  state-owned  banks  still  play  an  important  role  in  the  domestic  banking  sector \n9. \nand hold almost 42% of total banking assets. Their market share has dropped significantly in the \nlast 5 years, however, while the share of the private banks in total assets grew from 34.5% in \n1998 to 43.0% as of the end of 2005.5 The state banks have nationwide branch networks, but \nremain highly inefficient and undercapitalized. The state-owned banks\u2019 ratios for nonperforming \nloans declined from 18% in 2003 to 8% in June 2006, thereby reaching levels similar to those of \ndomestic private banks. Capital adequacy ratios have also improved (to 8% of total assets), and \nsteps have been taken to further enhance the regulatory and supervisory framework, including \nplans to adopt the Basel II capital accord by 2008. \n \n10. \nThe  major  private  commercial  banks  have  widened  their  networks  to  cover  almost  the \nentire  country.  The  four  leading  private  commercial  banks\u2014Hatton  National  Bank  (HNB), \nCommercial Bank of Ceylon (CBC), Seylon Bank, and Sampath Bank\u2014have over 200 branches \namong them nationwide. They continue to dominate the private banking sector, accounting for \n85% of its assets, 90% of the deposits, and 85% of the loans granted. CBC and Sampath Bank \nare seeking greater prudential safety and security through diversification, as their loan portfolios \nwere  traditionally  concentrated  in  financing  large  enterprises.  HNB  has  been  an  innovator  in \nSME lending in Sri Lanka and one of the earliest financial institutions to recognize that lending \nto SMEs can be profitable and provide a cushion to the bank in times of economic decline. \n\n                                                      \n3   World Bank. 2006. The Maldives: Sustaining Growth and Improving the Investment Climate. Washington, DC. \n4   Central Bank of Sri Lanka. 2005. Annual Report 2005.  Colombo. \n5   IMF. 2006. Financial Sector Quarterly Update. Washington, DC. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n \n11. \nCommercial interests and competition for deposit and loan customers have led a number \nof  the  commercial  banks  to  lend  more  aggressively  to  SMEs.  Banks  such  as  Sampath,  HNB, \nand  CBC  play  leading  roles  in  this  regard.  Although  encouraging,  these  resource  mobilization \nactivities will first and foremost fund activities bearing relatively lower risks for the banks, such \nas  housing  and  car  loans,  and  only  then  be  available  for  SME  lending.  Their  volumes  are \nlimited,  given  the  relatively  high  short-term  interest  rates.  Additionally,  there  remains  the \nproblem of high unit transaction costs in processing relatively small SME loans. \n \n12. \nThe  financial  sector  in  the  Maldives  is  very  narrow  and  is  dominated  by  the  banking \nsector.  Nonbank  financial  institutions  in  the  country  consist  of  only  a  few  companies.  The \ndominant  player  in  the  banking  sector  is  the  state-owned  Bank  of  the  Maldives,  the  country\u2019s \nonly  indigenous  bank,  with  17  branches  located  in  the  capital  and  some  of  the  distant  atolls \nservicing the island communities. The other banks in the country are branches of the State Bank \nof  India,  Bank  of  Ceylon,  Habib  Bank,  and  HSBC,  all  of  which  have  single  locations  in  the \ncapital  Male.  Competition  among  banks  is  intense  given  the  rate  of  growth  in  the  economy.6 \nLending tends to be short to medium term and fixed-rate funding is scarce. \n \n13. \nAll  financial  institutions  are  under  the  supervision  of  the  Maldives  Monetary  Authority \n(MMA)  which  promulgated  and  issued  the  Regulations  for  Finance  Leasing  Companies  and \nFinance Leasing Transactions in 2001.  \n \nC. \n\nThe Leasing Sector in Asia \n\nIn most developing countries, capital markets are relatively undeveloped and banks are \n14. \noften unable or unwilling to undertake term lending. Banks prefer to lend to larger, established \nbusinesses  with  well-developed  balance  sheets  and  credit  histories.  Operations \nin \nmicroenterprises  and  small  businesses  are  oriented  to  cash  flow  but  rarely  have  organized \nhistorical  financial  records  or  the  assets  needed  for  collateral  to  obtain  conventional  bank \nfinancing.7  In  developing  countries  generally,  therefore,  but  particularly  in  Asia,  SMEs  often \nhave unmet needs for lease financing. \n \nThe  leasing  industry  in  Asia  makes  an  important  contribution  to  the  economic \n15. \ndevelopment of the region by providing a financing tool to both large enterprises and SMEs. In \ndoing  so,  it  increases  the  level  of  private  investment  in  capital  equipment.  The  essential \nproposition underlying the concept of leasing is that a business enterprise earns its profits from \nthe  use  of  assets  rather  than  through  ownership  of  those  assets.  In  developing  countries  with \nunclear  property  rights,  poorly  functioning  asset  registries,  and  weak  laws  for  securing \ntransactions, leasing can provide an attractive alternative to both lessees without collateral and \nlessors wanting to improve the possibility of repossession, if necessary. \n \n\n                                                      \n6  The  Maldives  economy  has  been  growing  at  an  annual  average  of  7.5%  for  the  past  decade.  Although  growth \nsuffered in 2005 and was actually negative due to the adverse affects of the tsunami, it is expected to bounce back \nand for GDP to grow at a double-digit rate. GDP in 2005 was $669.5 million, or approximately $1,860 per capita. \nTourism is the main industry, contributing over 33% of GDP. Fisheries, marine transportation, and trade follow close \nbehind. Interest rates have been virtually constant in the range of 7.75%\u201313.00% since 2003. Previously, they had \nbeen as high as 12%\u201315%. The country has a managed exchange rate regime with the local currency, the rufiyaa, \ncurrently pegged to the US dollar at a rate of  Rf12.75 = $1. The rufiyaa is freely exchangeable.   \n\n7  World  Bank.    Leasing  to  Support  Small  Businesses  and  Micro  Enterprises.

However, the leasing industries in \nmost  of  ADB\u2019s  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  remain  underdeveloped.  A  recent  study \ncommissioned  by  ADB8  on  the  leasing  industry  in  13  DMCs  indicates  that  the  total  annual \nleasing volume in these countries is less than $7 billion in a global leasing industry of over $500 \nbillion. Leasing has an average penetration of 0.4% of GDP9 in those countries while that figure \nexceeds 1% in developed countries. \n\n \nFigure 1 \nAnnual Leasing Volume by Selected Developing Member Countries (2003) \n \n\nTotal Selected DMCs: $6.4 billion \n \nUS: $208 billion \nJapan: $69 billion \nUK: $19 billion\n\nC hin a \nIn d o n e sia\n\nIn dia \nSri L a n k a\n\nP a kista n\n\nK a z a k h sta n\nM ala y sia\n\nB a n gla d e s h\n\nP hilip pin e s\n\nU z b e kista n\n\nT ajikista n\n\nVolume ($ Bn)\n\nVolume/GDP (%)\n\n \n\n                Source: World Leasing Yearbook 2005. \n \nD. \n\nThe Leasing Industry in Sri Lanka and the Maldives \n\n1. \n\nSri Lanka \n\n17. \nIt  can  be  noted  from  the  figure  above  that  Sri  Lanka  has  a  leasing  penetration  of \napproximately  2.4%  of  GDP,  which  is  significantly  larger  than  that  of  any  of  the  other  DMCs \nunder observation. It is even greater than the average leasing penetration in the US or Japan. \nThe main reason for the higher use of leasing as a financing tool in Sri Lanka as compared with \nother DMCs in the region lies in the fact that the leasing sector in that country developed much \nearlier. The major growth in leasing occurred following the formation of the first two specialized \nleasing  companies,  namely,  Lanka  ORIX  Leasing  Company  Limited  and  Mercantile  Lloyds \nLeasing,  in  the  early  1980s.  These  companies  focused  their  leasing  activities  primarily  on \nproviding leasing facilities to SMEs\u2014a segment that traditionally was neglected by the banking \n\n                                                      \n8   ADB. 2005.

Furthermore,  leasing\u2019s  strong  market  share  in  Sri  Lanka  can  be \nexplained by the weakness of traditional financing for the SME sector. That, in turn, is due to the \nweakness  of  certain  legal  provisions  for  registering  and  enforcing  security  interests  (e.g., \ninefficiencies in the registries for land and movable properties).10  \n \n18. \nSixty-eight  companies  were  registered  with  the  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  as  providing \nleasing as of the end of 2005. However, only 20 of these were registered exclusively to provide \nleasing.  Leasing  is  also  offered  by  commercial  banks,  specialized  banks,  and  finance \ncompanies.  \n \n19. \nLeases  in  Sri  Lanka  are  predominantly  financial  leases  because  the  Leasing  Act  in \nexistence  applies  to  financial  leases  and  not  operating  leases.11  Passenger  cars  and \ncommercial  vehicles  are  the  main  categories  absorbing  the  bulk  of  financial  leases  although \ntrade and transportation also enjoy continued growth among the various leasing subsectors. For \nfurther information on the leasing sector in Sri Lanka, see Appendix 1. \n \n20. \nby 15% in the service sector, and 14% in the industrial sector. \n \n\nIn LOLC\u2019s case, for example, 41% of its borrowers are in the trading business, followed \n\n2. \n\nThe Maldives \n\n21. \nFrom  a  base  of  zero  in  May  2002,  the  Maldives  leasing  industry  had  grown  to  a  $15 \nmillion portfolio of financial leases by mid-2006. That represented approximately 1.5% of GDP. \nSmall  leases  are  normally  under  $50,000  while  a  medium-sized  lease  would  be  under \n$200,000.12  The  majority  of  the  leases  executed  are  for  acquiring  productive  assets.  A  small \nproportion  of  the  transactions  are  of  the  sale-and-lease-back  type.  Consumer  financing  in  the \nform of leasing occurs informally in the economy, and in particular for motorcycles.  \n \nThe  general  regulatory  climate  is  very  conducive  to  the  industry.  The  MMA  actively \n22. \nsupports leasing as a tool to broaden the base of the economy and to empower the SME sector \nfor  participating  in  the  country\u2019s  economic  growth.  The  leasing  regulations  in  place  are  very \ncomprehensive  without  being  too  restrictive.  They  have  not  yet  been  well  tested,  however,  in \nsuch areas as recovery, repossession, and legal proceedings.  \n \n23. \nLessors require a specific license from the MMA to commence leasing operations in the \nMaldives,  and  they  are  subject  to  the  MMA\u2019s  regulatory  supervision  and  the  provisions  of  the \nexisting leasing regulations. \n \n\nIII. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS AND IMPACTS \n\nA. \n\nJustification for ADB\u2019s Participation \n\n1. \n\nPrimary Objective \n\na. \n\nStrengthen Leasing Industry \n\n24. \nThe proposed ADB assistance is expected to strengthen the leasing industry further and \nexpand  the  funding  resources  and  financial  services  available  to  the  SME  sector  in  the  two \n                                                      \n10  ADB. 2005. Sri Lanka Financial Sector Assessment. Manila. \n11 Daily News. 2005. Leasing Industry Poised for Growth. \n12 Maldives Monetary Authority. Available: http://www.mma.gov.mv. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\ncountries. The activity of leasing companies in Sri Lanka and the Maldives is constrained by the \nneed  to  borrow  at  short  maturity  to  fund  a  business  that  lends  at  a  longer  maturity.  The \nunderdeveloped nature of corporate debt markets in both countries has made nonbank leasing \nfirms  heavily  dependent  on  commercial  banks  for  their  funding  through  short-term  borrowings \nand  commercial  paper.  This  has  resulted  in  maturity  mismatches  in  assets  and  liabilities  and \nhigher costs of funds for these institutions. \n \n\nb. \n\nPromote SME growth \n\n25. \nThe proposed loans from ADB to the two companies will provide them access to long-\nterm  funds  and  thereby  enable  them  to  promote  alternative  financing  instruments  to  SME \nentrepreneurs, promote their operations and profitability, and enhance their competitiveness. \n \n26. \nThe project is in line with ADB\u2019s country strategies for Sri Lanka and the Maldives. It will \npromote private sector participation in SME development. The demonstration effects related to \nlong-term funding will be positive. \n \n27. \nThe  project  is  also  complementary  to  ADB\u2019s  public  sector  approach  as  exemplified  by \nADB\u2019s recent financial markets loan.13 This program is intended to facilitate participation of the \nprivate sector, including SMEs, in the Sri Lankan economy by supporting government reforms to \neliminate impediments to and develop opportunities for their involvement.  \n \n\nc. \n\nImprove Broader Capital Markets Development \n\nLeasing  companies  can  also  boost  capital  markets  development.  Once  they  have \n28. \nestablished operating histories, they can tap and foster equity markets. Their demand for term \ndebt  broadens  the  term  lending  options  for  banks,  finance  houses,  pension  funds,  and \ninsurance  companies.  They  can  also  issue  bonds  or  other  marketable  instruments.  Finally, \nleasing companies can securitize their lease receivables, taking some assets off balance sheet \nto achieve a higher leverage and better returns while adding another tradable instrument to local \ncapital markets. ADB is currently in discussions with LOLC regarding a possible securitization of \npart of its lease portfolio whereby ADB would provide a guarantee to credit enhance the issue \nand/or purchase the mezzanine tranche of such a structured transaction. This would represent \nthe first true securitization deal in the capital markets of Sri Lanka. This would also represent a \nstrong example of cooperation between the public sector and private sector departments within \nADB, where ADB\u2019s public sector window would provide a loan to focus on introducing publicly \ntraded securitized bonds in the capital market14 and the Private Sector Operations Department \nwould test the regulatory framework by structuring the first such transaction. \n \n\n2. \n\nDevelopment Impact \n\n29. \nFrom  a  development  perspective,  a  well-functioning  leasing  industry  is  an  important \nfinancing tool for SMEs. Such enterprises are particularly constrained by the lack of assets that \ncan be used as collateral for bank loans. When credit is available from informal sources, it tends \nto be short-term and too costly for investment financing. Advantages of leasing over alternative \nforms  of  finance  for  SMEs  include  a  lower  down  payment,  credit  availability,  simpler \ndocumentation  and  security  arrangements,  faster  credit  approval,  and  tax  incentives.  In  fact, \n                                                      \n13 ADB. 2004. Financial Markets Program for Private Sector Development. Manila (R265-04). \n14  A  securitization  bill  will  be  introduced  to  Parliament  whereby  special  purpose  vehicles  may  be  established  as \nseparate  legal  entities  to  pool  real  or  intangible  assets  against  which  public  securities  may  be  issued.  This \nsecuritization bill is one of the components of ADB\u2019s Financial Markets Program. \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nleasing and supplier credit15 are often the only sources of credit available to SMEs. In promoting \nthe  small  enterprise  in  developing  countries,  leasing  plays  a  role  in  reducing  poverty  by \ngenerating income and employment.  \n \nIt is expected that about 200 SMEs will be assisted through lease financing. That would \n30. \nresult in additional capital formation, value added, employment, foreign exchange earnings and \nsavings,  as  well  as  promotion  of  new  entrepreneurs.  This  is  fully  in  line  with  the  focus  of  the \ngovernments  of  Sri  Lanka  and  the  Maldives,  which  have  given  priority  to  the  development  of \nenterprises by new entrepreneurs and of the SME sector in general.  \n \n31.  Moreover, a robust leasing industry has the potential to contribute to the development of \ncapital  markets  by  introducing  SMEs  to  formal  financial  markets  and  providing  demand  from \nleasing companies for capital markets funding. \n \n\n3. \n\nMeasures for Development Impact \n\nADB  will  measure  the  expected  development  impact  of  the  proposed  loans.  These \n32. \nperformance  measures  follow  the  Multilateral  Development  Banks\u2014Evaluation  Cooperation \nGroup\u2019s Standards for Evaluation of Private Sector Investment Operations. Development impact \nis  measured  in  three  distinct  categories:  (i)  business  performance  of  the  project  itself,  (ii) \neconomic sustainability, and (iii) private sector development. Examples of development impact \nmeasures  are  (i)  business  performance  (overall  profitability  and  commercial  viability  of  the \nfinancial  institution):  return  on  equity,  net  interest  margin,  growth  in  assets;  (ii)  economic \nsustainability  (allocation  of  resources  and  provision  of  financial  services  to  viable  private \nenterprises):  increase  of  lending  to  small  business  enterprises,  disbursements  to  rural  areas, \ncredit  quality  in  lending;  (iii)  private  sector  development  (contribution  to  the  growth  of  viable \nfinancial  sector  and  financial  markets  development):  operational  improvement  (e.g.,  credit \nappraisal  methods),  evidence  of  spillover  effects  (e.g.,  competitors  adopting  best  practices  of \nbank),  contribution  to  financial  strength  of  sector  (e.g.,  better  match  of  assets  and  liabilities). \nPlease refer to Appendix 2 for the full development impact framework. \n \nB. \n\nEnvironment and Social Safeguards \n\nEnvironment.

At the end of 1985, these two leasing companies accounted for 77% of \nlease  transactions.1  The  companies  were  provided  tax  holidays  for  5  years  from  their \nformations. Generous capital allowance. Vehicles 4 years, 3 years for equipment. Vehicles for \nyear 6 years  \n \n2. \nUntil 2001, leasing companies were largely unregulated and mainly specialist by nature. \nIn 2001, a new leasing act was introduced permitting new leasing companies to be established \nas  long  as  they  met  a  minimum  capital  requirement  of  SLRs75  million  ($0.75  million).  This \nprompted a number of leasing companies to enter the industry. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe Sri Lankan leasing sector has played an important role in developing the transport \nsector, especially in rural areas. Passenger and commercial vehicles are the main category of \nassets financed by leasing, with a 70% share of the total portfolio in 2004 (down from 77% in \n2003). Over 75% of leasing companies in Sri Lanka still concentrate on vehicle leasing and only \na  few  have  diversified  into  such  other  products  as  the  financing  of  warehouses,  hospitals, \neducational  institutions,  and  office  equipment.  Over  50%  of  leases  were  utilized  to  purchase \nsecondhand vehicles2  \n \n4. \nThe  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  is  calling  for  the  leasing  industry  to  diversify  into  other \nareas and to target SME financing.3 The leasing of non-vehicle equipment has been hampered \nby the absence of a clear legal process with regard to the repossession of equipment and the \nshort  commercial  life  of  so  much  modern  equipment  (unlike  vehicles,  which  have  a  ready \nsecondhand value). In a recent interview,4 the CEO of People\u2019s Leasing Company, the second \nlargest  leasing  company  in  Sri  Lanka,  Mr.  Kumarage,  pointed  out  that  it  is  typical,  with  the \nexception  of  a  small  number  of  developed  markets,  for  vehicles  to  dominate  the  leasing \nindustry.  He  points  out  that  factories  often  have  less  need  for  leasing  in  Sri  Lanka  as  they \nreceive  favorable  credit  lines  from  development  finance  institutions.  However,  he  also \nhighlighted machinery required for the tea industry as a potential avenue for development.  \n \nC. \n \n5. \nMost of the recent entrants into the Sri Lankan leasing industry are subsidiaries of banks \nrather  than  specialist  leasing  companies.  There  is  some  resentment  among  specialist  leasing \ncompanies  toward  these  banking  entrants,  who  are  regarded  as  \u201cfair-weather\u201d  lenders. \n\nEntry of Banks \n\n                                                      \n1   ADB. 1987.

People\u2019s  Leasing \nCompany, a subsidiary of People\u2019s Bank, is now the largest leasing business by volume. In its 7 \nyears of operation the company has raised SLRs2.4 billion ($24 million) through securitization. \n \nD. \n \n6. \nIn  Sri  Lanka,  litigation  to  recover  bad  debts  is  a  protracted  and  costly  process.  An \narbitration procedure designed to improve this process is not proving as successful as had been \nhoped, with procedures often proving even more unwieldy and expensive.5 Leasing companies \nare excluded from Sri Lanka\u2019s Debt Recovery Act, which enables other financial institutions to \nrepossess  and  sell  collateral  without  court  intervention.  Weaknesses  in  the  guarantee  and \nrepossession  laws  hamper  growth  of  the  leasing  sector,  especially  outside  the  better \nunderstood urban automotive sector. \n \nE. \n \n7. \nCentral Bank of Sri Lanka6. \n \nIn recent years there have been a number of significant changes in the fiscal treatment \n8. \nof leasing. In 2002, a value-added tax (VAT) regime was introduced and the leasing sector was \nsubjected  to  input  and  output  rates.  The  input  and  output  taxes  have  been  aligned  at  15%.  It \nhas been argued that these changes have had the effect of making leases less competitive.7 \n \n9. \nThe state is now contemplating a number of changes in legislation that might hamper the \nindustry. First, the state is considering to reduce depreciation allowances from 25% to 12.5%. \nSecond, the Government is proposing to charge leasing companies the higher of 1% of turnover \nor  SLRs50  million  ($0.5  million).    LOLC  argues  that  \u201cincreases  in  the  VAT  rate  on  leasing, \nspecial  VAT  rates  on  leasing  companies,  economic  service  charges  and  changes  to \ndepreciation  rates  on  vehicles  and  machinery  are  likely  to  make  leasing  an  unattractive \nfinancing  option  to  our  core  customer  base  of  small  and  medium-sized  business  enterprises. \nFurthermore,  these  fiscal  disincentives  could  effectively  undermine  the  collective  efforts  of  the \nleasing companies to serve the small and medium entrepreneurs who are expected to make a \nsubstantial contribution to the national economy.\u201d \n \n10. \nasset recovery, greater self-regulation, and the removal of VAT charges on leasing. \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe Sri Lankan leasing industry would benefit from improvements in the process of \n\n                                                      \n5  Leasing Industry in the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Developing Member Countries, Michael Fox, Manila, 2005. \n6  ADB (2005), Financial Assessment Report for Sri Lanka.
