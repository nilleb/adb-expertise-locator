An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was \nAssessment  undertaken  and  the  main  findings  were  summarized  in  the \nsummary environmental impact assessment (SEIA), which was \ncirculated to the Board and posted on the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) website on 19 July 2005. \n   \nProject Description  The  Project\u2014developed  under  the  overall  framework  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s poverty reduction strategy outlined in its 10-Year \nPerspective  Development  Plan  2001\u20132011\u2014will  improve  living \nconditions  in  Rawalpindi,  a  city  of  about  2.2 million  people \nadjoining Islamabad in Punjab province. It comprises three parts: \n(i)  environmental  sanitation  (including  sewerage,  sewage \ntreatment,  stormwater  drainage,  solid  waste  management, \nslaughterhouse replacement, and public toilets); (ii) water supply \nimprovement  (including  replacement  of  tubewells,  rehabilitation \nand  construction  of  distribution  networks,  water  meter \ninstallations,  and  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities  for \nschools);  and  (iii)  institutional  development  (including \ndevelopment of municipal management, an urban environmental \ndevelopment plan, asset management, and urban planning). \n   \nRationale  In Rawalpindi, high urban growth (4% per year), slow urban sector \ndevelopment,  lack  of  resources,  and  inadequate  institutional \ncapacity have resulted in uncontrolled urban sprawl, deteriorating \nurban environments, and deficiencies in urban services (including \nwater  supply,  sewerage  systems,  drainage,  solid  waste \nmanagement, and community facilities). The resulting deficiencies \nparticularly  affected  the  urban  poor  and  led  to  a  considerably \nreduced  quality  of  life,  including  poor  health.  In  1993,  ADB \napproved a loan of $72 million for the Rawalpindi Urban Water \nSupply and Sanitation Project, as the first phase of a proposed \nthree-phase project for improving water and sanitation services in \nRawalpindi.  When  the  first  phase  was  completed  in  2003, \nRawalpindi  had  increased  water  supplies  from \n192,000 cubic meters per day (m3/day) to 256,000 m3/day, with \nconsiderable  rehabilitation  and  extension  of  its  water  supply \ndistribution network. In addition, major institutional and financial \nreforms  were  executed  for  the  Implementation  Agency\u2014\nRawalpindi  Water  and  Sanitation  Agency\u2014and  engineering ", "  iii\nstudies for future development of sewerage and drainage, and a \nsolid waste management plan were prepared. The second phase \n(the Project) is intended to implement these plans, focusing on \nimprovements to sewerage and drainage, provision of sewage \ntreatment plant (STP), and solid waste management. The third \nphase  will  complete  the  overall  requirements  of  Rawalpindi's \nwater and sanitation sector, including further expansion of water \nsupply  sources,  in  accordance  with  the  master  plan,  and \nextension of water and sanitation in unserved areas of the city.  \n \nThe  Government  is  implementing  comprehensive  governance \nreforms, with particular emphasis on enhancing the effectiveness \nof  basic  social  services  through  its  program  for  devolution  of \npowers. The Project is formulated to support the Government\u2019s \npoverty reduction initiatives, as well as devolution of power and \nresponsibility to local governments for the provision and financing \nof urban infrastructure and municipal services. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Project\u2019s impacts are expected to be improvements in living \nconditions, quality of life, and health of the people of Rawalpindi \nby improving water supply and sanitation facilities, solid waste \nmanagement,  wastewater  treatment,  and  slaughterhouse.  The \noutcome is sustainable reduction of environmental degradation \nand sustainable operation of basic urban services.  \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  estimated  project  cost  is  $85.7  million  equivalent, \ncomprising foreign exchange costs of $12.5 million (14.6%) and \nlocal currency costs equivalent to $73.2 million (85.4%). \n   \nFinancing Plan  Financing \n   \n  ($ million) \nSource  Foreign  Local \nTotal  % \n  Exchange  Currency \nADB  12.5  47.5  60.0  70 \nPG  0.0  21.4  21.4  25 \nRT/WASA  0.0  4.3  4.3  5 \nTotal    12.5  73.2  85.7  100 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PG = government of Punjab, RT = Rawal \nTown, WASA = Water and Sanitation Agency. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  It is proposed that ADB provide two loans. A loan of $40 million \nequivalent  in  various  currencies  from  ADB\u2019s  special  funds \nresources (Asian Development Fund [ADF]). The loan will have a \n32-year term including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate \nof  1%  per  year  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  year \nthereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft loan agreement. A second loan of $20 million equivalent \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  will  be  provided \nunder  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term including a \ngrace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance \n ", "iv   \nwith ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of \n0.75% per annum, no front-end fee, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  ADB will provide the loan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, \nTerms  which will relend it to the government of Punjab (PG) on the same \nterms and conditions. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by \nthe  PG,  which  will  make  the  loan  proceeds  available  to  City \nDistrict Rawalpindi (CDR) as a grant. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 September 2011 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 March 2011 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency   City District Rawalpindi \n   \nImplementation  The Executing Agency (EA) will establish a project management \nArrangements  unit (PMU) headed by the project director located at the Water and \nSanitation  Agency  (WASA).  The  PMU,  comprising  professional \nstaff supported by a team of consultants, will assist CDR, Rawal \nTown (RT), Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA), and WASA \nin providing policy guidance and implementing project components. \nFor internal coordination, two committees will be set up. A project \nimplementation  review  committee\u2014comprising  officials  of  CDR, \nPothar  Town,  RT,  RDA,  WASA,  union  administrations,  and \ncommunity-based organizations\u2014will monitor the progress of all \nproject  components  on  a  quarterly  basis.  A  project  steering \ncommittee will be set up in the PG in Lahore to ensure smooth \nimplementation, resolve interagency problems, and provide policy \nguidance. It will be headed by the chairman of PG\u2019s Planning and \nDevelopment  Board  (P&D),  with  members  comprising  senior \nofficers from the P&D; Housing, Urban Development, and Public \nHealth  Engineering  Department  (HUD&PHED);  and  finance \ndepartment of PG; as well as RDA, WASA, and CDR and RT \nheads (nazims). It will meet at least once every 6 months. \n   \nProcurement  All  procurement  services  for  the  Project  will  follow  ADB's \nGuidelines  for  Procurement  and  the  Government\u2019s  rules  and \nregulations. Contracts for civil works estimated to cost more than \n$5 million equivalent will be issued using international competitive \nbidding (ICB) procedures. Contracts estimated to cost $5 million \nequivalent or less will be carried out through local competitive \nbidding (LCB) procedures. Minor development and maintenance \nmay be carried out on a force account basis. Procurement of \ngoods  will  preferably  be  grouped  into  packages  larger  than \n$500,000 to be suitable for ICB procedures. Miscellaneous minor \ngoods  that  cannot  be  grouped  into  larger  contracts,  and  are \nestimated  to  cost  less  than  $500,000  per  contract,  will  be \nprocured through international shopping (IS) procedures. Minor \nitems  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $100,000  equivalent  per ", "  v\ncontract may be purchased directly, following proper procedures \nto ensure economy, efficiency, and quality. \n   \nConsulting Services  An  input  of  1,334  person-months  of  consulting  services  is \nplanned,  consisting  of  18  international  and  1,316  domestic \nperson-months, all under two packages. Package A will be for \nproject  management  and  implementation  support  to  the  PMU, \nincluding  subproject  detailed  design,  construction  supervision, \nand monitoring and evaluation. Package B will be for institutional \ndevelopment.  In  addition,  local  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs) and social mobilizing teams (Package C) will be engaged \nfor  community  development  and  participation  (144  person-\nmonths). \n \nPackages  A  and  B  will  be  procured  from  domestic  consulting \nfirms. Package C will be procured on an individual basis and by \ncontracting local NGOs. Consultants for Package A and B will be \nselected and engaged in accordance with the quality- and cost-\nbased  selection  method  of  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants or other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants. Whereas, consultants for \nPackage C will be selected either as individual consultants or as \nfirm. In the case of a firm, it will be selected and engaged in \naccordance with the quality-based selection method.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will improve the living conditions of about 1.4 million \nBeneficiaries  residents of Rawalpindi city by enhancing the quality of life and \nhealth,  improving  the  environment,  and  creating  conditions \nconducive to sustained urban development and economic growth. \nIt will contribute to reduction of mortality, morbidity, and poverty, \nand  mitigate  loss  of  amenity  caused  by  environmental \ndegradation in the city, especially among slum inhabitants and \npoor groups (particularly women and children). The Project will \nsupport improvements to RT and WASA capacity by improving \ntheir  financial  and  operational  management  and  planning, \nincluding local resource generation. The financial internal rates of \nreturn (FIRRs) for the components are estimated as follows: solid \nwaste (7.3%), sewerage and stormwater drainage (2.7%), and \nwater supply (6.2%). The overall project economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) is estimated at 15.8%. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Major risks associated with the Project include the following. \n(i)  Acquisition of  required  land  may  be  delayed  or  not  be \nforthcoming, which could delay or impede implementation \nof some subprojects. \n(ii)  Frequent turnover of trained staff and delayed decision \nmaking on critical issues by CDR, WASA, and RDA may \njeopardize project benefits. \n(iii)  Future  legislation  could  gradually  erode  the \ncomprehensiveness and consistency of the Punjab Local \nGovernment  Ordinance  (PLGO),  2001,  which  could \n ", "vi   \nseriously impede the CDR\u2019s effectiveness as a main actor \nin project implementation. \n \n(iv)  Implementation  of  the  agreed  Government  Policy \n(Appendix 2) may be delayed and efforts for enhancement \nof the revenue base and institutional strengthening of RT \nand  WASA  may  not  give  sufficient  sustainable  results. \nThis could affect project implementation or the long-term \nsustainability of improvements, or both. \n \nCDR will initiate the land acquisition process before loan approval \nto  avoid  implementation  delays.  Close  monitoring  and  early \nflagging  for  action  by  the  project  implementation  review  and \nsteering committees will minimize the risk of delayed decision \nmaking. Considering lessons learned from phase 1, the PG has \nprovided a firm commitment to minimize staff turnover and recruit \nqualified staff for PMU, WASA, and RT. Strict attention to timely \nproject progress reporting, including staffing and accounting, will \nalso  help.  Devolution  is  one  of  the  Government's  particular \ncommitments to reform, particularly capacity building of RT and \nWASA.  The  Project  is  a  timely  contribution  to  the  devolution \nprocess.  The  risk  of  delays  in  implementing  the  Government \nPolicy will be minimized by a water audit that will lead to updating \nthe Government Policy, and its monitoring by a civil society task \nforce.  \n ", "64o00'E 73o00'E\nNORTH-WEST\nFRONTIER\n35o00'N ISTaLrAbeMlaABAD35o00'N toPeshawar\nPeshawar Mangla RawalLake\nRawalpindi\nAFGHANISTAN IndusR.SargoJhdehluam R.ChJenhaebluR.m\nLahore\nD.I.KPhaUnNJABRaviR.\nQuetta MuSluttalnejR\nPAKISTAN\nBALOCHISTAN\nIRAN R.\nIndus RAWALPINDIR.CITY\n26o00'N SINDH 26o00'N Kurang\nGwadar INDIA\nHyderabad\nKarachi\nARABIAN SEA\n64o00'E 73o00'E\nPAKISTAN\nRAWALPINDI ENVIRONMENTAL\nIMPROVEMENT PROJECT\ne\nNationalCapital River oLahor\nProvincialCapital an t\no\nCity/Town S\nProposedSewageTreatmentPlant\nProposedLandfillSite\nPPMrraooippnooWsseeaddteSOrluPatuifpagelhllitSneeerhwoeurse SoanRiver\nNationalRoad\nOtherRoad\nN\nRiver\nDistrictBoundary\nProvincialBoundary\nInternationalBoundary\n05 Boundariesarenotnecessarilyauthoritative.\n-5\n8\n8\n2\nH v\nR ii", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on two proposed loans to \nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Rawalpindi Environmental Improvement Project.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  Rawalpindi is the third largest city in Pakistan. About 40% of its 2.2 million inhabitants are in \nthe low-income group. Like other urban areas in Pakistan, high urban growth (4% per year) has \nresulted in uncontrolled urban sprawl, deteriorated urban environments, and deficiencies in the city\u2019s \nurban services. Lack of sanitation facilities (mainly sewerage, sewage treatment, drainage, and solid \nwaste collection and disposal) has caused serious environmental problems, particularly to drinking \nwater quality, due to pollution of surface and groundwater sources. Water quality analyses performed \nin 20021 show that over 85% of water samples analyzed for physical, chemical, and bacteriological \nparameters  were  unsafe  for  human  consumption  due  to  bacterial contamination.  A  2003  study2 \nindicates that typhoid, hepatitis, and other gastrointestinal water-related diseases have reached an \nalarming level and hospitals are continuously registering more patients. This situation has particularly \naffected the urban poor and caused a considerably lower quality of life, including poor health and \nincreased poverty. The incidence of poverty in Pakistan has increased from 20.0% to 32.1% over the \npast 15 years. Unemployment was 9.7% in urban areas and 7.7% nationwide during FY2004.3 \n \n3.  The poverty reduction strategy of the Government of Pakistan4 (the Government) envisages a \nmultipronged strategy of reviving growth, improving governance, reorienting public expenditure toward \npoverty-reducing programs, and revamping the social security system. The Government is committed \nto increasing pro-poor budgetary expenditure by 0.2% of gross domestic product (GDP) per year to \n4% of GDP in FY2004.5 The Government is implementing comprehensive governance reforms, with \nparticular emphasis on enhancing the effectiveness of basic social services through its Punjab Local \nGovernment  Ordinance  (PLGO),  2001.  The  government  of  Punjab\u2019s  (PG\u2019s)  poverty  reduction \nstrategy6 also emphasizes the need to implement broad-based governance reforms and improve \nsocial services to address poverty.  \n \n4.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a loan of $72 million in 1993 for the Rawalpindi \nUrban Water Supply and Sanitation Project,7 as the first phase of a proposed three-phase project for \nimproving water and sanitation services in Rawalpindi. Upon completion of the first phase in 2003, \nRawalpindi  had  increased  water  supplies  from  192,000  cubic  meters  per  day  (m3/day)  to \n256,000 m3/day, with considerable rehabilitation and extension of its water supply distribution network. \nIn addition, major institutional and financial reforms were executed for the Implementing Agency\u2014\nRawalpindi Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA)\u2014and engineering studies for future development of \nsewerage and drainage and a solid waste management plan were prepared. The second phase (the \nProject) is intended to implement these plans, focusing on improvements to sewerage and drainage, \nprovision of a sewage treatment plant (STP), and solid waste management. The third phase will \ncomplete  the  overall  requirements  of  Rawalpindi's  water  and  sanitation  sector,  including  further \naugmentation of water supply sources in accordance with the master plan and extension of water and \nsanitation in unserved areas of the city.  \n                                                 \n1  Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources. 2002. \n2  Institute of Public Health and National Institute of Health. 2003.

", "2   \n5.  This document is based on consultants\u2019 feasibility reports prepared during an ADB-financed \ntechnical assistance (TA) project,8understandings reached between the Loan Appraisal Mission9and \n   \nboth federal and provincial governments, and extensive consultations with elected town officials and \nbeneficiaries  representing  all  community  groups,  including  women.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n6.  In accordance with PLGO 2001, responsibility for delivery of municipal urban services and \nenvironmental improvement rests mainly with tehsil10 municipal administrations (TMAs)/towns. Union \nAdministrations (UAs), the lowest level of local government, are in charge of community development \nand related tasks. The district government, a level above TMAs/towns, handles affairs related to \ngovernment land as well as the health and education sectors. Implementation of PLGO 2001 has \nconsiderably reduced the previously dominating roles of provincial agencies. Special development \nauthorities  have  been  set  up  for  major  cities  in  Punjab,  including  Rawalpindi,  through  the \nDevelopment of Cities Act, 1976, and district governments have been designated city governments.11 \nTMAs/towns are supervised by the provincial Local Government and Rural Development Department \n(LG)  which  supports  and  monitors  progress  in  the  implementation  of  PLGO  2001,  including  all \nrequired adjustments and improvements in institutional and organizational setups as well as financial \nmanagement.  Within  LG,  the  Directorate  General  of  Katchi  Abadi  and  Urban  Improvement  has \nresponsibility for resolving problems related to katchi abadis.12 Rawalpindi has a mixed and conflicting \nland use pattern, with residential, commercial, and industrial uses. Urbanization has caused several \nslum areas to emerge in the city. At present, there are about 24 identified slums, including 6 katchi \nabadis, of which 3 have been regularized. \n \n7.  Piped water supply coverage in the city increased from 35% to 46% of the population following \nimplementation of the phase 1 project, which addressed urgent needs by expanding water supply \nsources and extending and rehabilitating distribution networks. There are about 76,000 registered and \nan estimated 15,000 unregistered water supply connections. Commercial consumers account for \nanother 5,500 connections. Total water production (including groundwater and surface water) is about \n163 million liters per day (mld). The city relies to a large extent on groundwater. The number of \ntubewells increased from 33 in 1980 to 209 in 2005. Persistent drought during 2001\u20132004 and \nexcessive withdrawal of groundwater have caused the water table to drop to an alarming level with \nconsequent reduction in the quantity and quality of water. Unserved households that can afford tanker \nwater have to pay about PRs1,800 ($31) per month whereas those on piped WASA water pay on \naverage only PRs40 ($0.7) per month. All other unserved settlements have to rely on unsafe water \nsources. The City District Rawalpindi (CDR) needs to urgently strengthen water management with \nsound water and sanitation policy and objectives, including: (i) long-term planning and development of \nwater resources for water supply purposes; (ii) piped water supply services and adequate sanitation \nfor all Rawalpindi inhabitants, maintained in a sustainable manner through sound financial and human \nresources  management;  (iii) water  conservation  aimed  at  metered  water  supply  services  for  all \nconsumers and consumption-based billing; (iv) sustainable use of groundwater; and (v) safeguarding \nwater quality. \n \n8.  The existing sewerage system only covers about 30% of the city area but has no sewage \ntreatment. In the remaining 70% of the city, raw sewage is discharged to street-side drains which \nultimately discharge into the Lai Nullah, the main drain passing through the city. Lack of a proper \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Rawalpindi Environmental Improvement Project. \nManila. \n9  The Loan Appraisal Mission was fielded 6\u201316 September 2005. \n10 A tehsil is a local government unit under a corporate municipal administration.  \n11 On 24 June 2005, PG declared eight tehsils of Rawalpindi district as a city district to be called City District Rawalpindi \n(CDR). Rawal Town is one of the towns of CDR, which includes Rawalpindi City.   \n12 A katchi abadi is an unauthorized settlement on state-owned land of more than 40 dwellings, without land rights or \nphysical and social infrastructure services and facilities.  ", "    3\nsewerage network, sewage disposal, and treatment have worsened conditions, especially for poor \npeople living in low-lying areas. Heavy rains cause extensive local flooding and storm water mixes \nwith raw sewage, spreading contamination throughout the neighborhood while low-lying areas remain \nflooded for a long time. Most of the existing drains in the city have been encroached upon, which has \nfurther  deteriorated  the  situation.  The  storm  water  channels  carrying  the  untreated  sewage  of \nIslamabad and Rawalpindi are virtually sludge carriers that ultimately discharge into nearby Soan \nRiver, affecting aquatic life and agriculture. All these factors have seriously affected drinking water \nquality: (i) open water storage reservoirs are being contaminated with the discharge of uncontrolled \nand untreated sewage; (ii) defective, old, leaking water pipelines that run alongside the sewerage \nsystem  receive  sewage  at  leaking  points;  (iii)  groundwater  sources  become  contaminated  by \npercolation of sewage because of the inadequate sewerage system; and (iv) discharge of untreated \nsewage from Islamabad in Lai Nullah has contaminated all the tubewells located along this drain. \n \n9.  Solid waste is managed by Rawal Town (RT), which is suffering from numerous operational \nand financial problems. Only 60% of the waste generated is collected and disposed of, and the \nexisting landfill site has ended its useful life. The sanitary tax paid to the TMA for solid waste disposal \nis about PRs20 ($0.33) per month and its collection efficiency is low. There are two slaughterhouses \nin  Rawalpindi  where  up  to  2,000  cattle  are  slaughtered  daily.  However,  there  is  no  adequate \narrangement for the disposal of animal waste, which causes serious environmental hazards.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities  \n10.  PLGO became effective in 2001 but much remains to be done in terms of strengthening the \ncapacity of LG agencies, clarifying roles and responsibilities, realigning the relationship between the \nprovincial government and LG, and ensuring increased and predictable funding to LG to meet social \nservices needs. While LG is now responsible for the delivery and management of social services, its \nadministrative and financial authorities are not capable of the assigned responsibility. The PG has a \ncritical role in providing an enabling environment for the LGs to improve their functional, financial, and \nmanagerial autonomy, in line with the PLGO, to empower LGs to improve social services. The \nproposed Project will (i) collaborate with the Decentralization Support Program,13 Punjab Resource \nManagement Program,14 and the Punjab Devolved Social Services Project;15 and (ii) enhance CDR\u2019s \nskills in rationalization and planning of social services. It is essential to institutionalize the overall \nworking of CDR to make its monitoring system more effective, transparent, and accountable. \n \n11.  Some  major  financial  and  institutional  reforms  to  enhance  institutional  efficiencies  were \nimplemented  in  WASA  under  the  phase  I  project.  As  a  result,  financial  management  improved \nsubstantially and WASA started generating more revenues than expenditures in 1999. However, \nprogress towards WASA\u2019s self-sustainability could not be maintained because the top management \nwas changed frequently; turnover of trained staff was high; inexperienced and less qualified staff were \nappointed; and, above all, the Government failed to follow up on WASA\u2019s sustained operations. \nConsidering the potential for improvement, important policy actions (Appendix 2) have been agreed \nwith the PG to address the problems outlined above and pursue sustainable urban services from a \nstrengthened WASA and RT.  \n \n12.  The Government\u2019s policy of decentralization and devolution is critical to developing greater \nlocal  responsibility.  Efficient  and  cost-effective  community  services  cannot  be  provided  until: \n(i) communities are involved in all phases of project design, execution, and post-implementation; and \n(ii) accountability and management are improved at each level of local government operations. The \nmobilization of local resources and improved management of existing infrastructure and services are \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2002.

The Government has agreed to support these objectives \nthrough the Project by: (i) strengthening the managerial, financial, and technical capacity of the CDR \nby  delegating  more  responsibility  and  upgrading  staff  capacities;  (ii)  providing  adequate  staff, \nequipment, and procedures to enable RT and WASA to increase resource mobilization and improve \nmanagement and delivery of existing urban infrastructure and services; and (iii) providing a training \nprogram to increase the managerial proficiency of their staff. The Government has committed itself to \ngreater  continuity  in  the  appointment  of  key  professional  and  administrative  staff  in  these \norganizations.  \n \n13.  At the start of the proposed Project, a comprehensive water audit will be undertaken which will \nexamine the consumption and cost of water from the perspective of various water suppliers (WASA, \nsmall-scale water providers, water vendors, and bottled water suppliers) and water users. This is \nexpected to provide new information on service coverage, the main source of water revenues, and \nuse  of  non-revenue  water  (NRW).  The  results  of  the  audit  will  be  analyzed  and  discussed  in \nconsultation with stakeholders, and will form the basis of new government policy on water supply \nservices,  which  is  expected  to  deal  with  the  following:  (i)  rate  of  increase  in  new  connections, \n(ii) targeting of services for the urban poor, (iii) tariffs and the elimination of flat rate tariffs, (iv) billing \ncollection, (v) metering of all services, (vi) groundwater management, (vii) organization development, \n(viii) NRW measurement and reduction, (ix) water conservation, and (x) community awareness and \ncommunity development. Appendix 2 summarizes the policy actions agreed with the PG.  \n \n14.  The Government is concerned about the low levels of social services and believes that greater \ninvestment will accelerate productivity gains, reduce poverty, and promote smaller, healthier, and \nbetter-educated families. Pakistan\u2019s national urban and housing policy is reflected in the 10-Year \nPerspective Development Plan (PDP), 2001\u20132011, which describes the main urban problems as: \n(i) environmental degradation and breakdown of infrastructure and municipal services; and (ii) lack of \nvision, inadequate institutional setups, and weak financial base. Improvements will start with the \nfollowing: (i) strengthening CDR\u2019s role in planning, determining actual needs, preparing action plans, \nand enhancing capabilities for water supply and sanitation services; (ii) preparing or updating master \nplans; and (iii) for water supply and sanitation, PDP envisages that an additional 55 million people \n(28 million rural and 27 million urban) will be provided with water supply services, increasing national \nservice coverage from 63% to 84%, and another 54 million people (26 million rural and 28 million \nurban) will benefit from sanitation facilities, increasing national service coverage from 39% to 63%. \nPrivate sector participation in environmental sanitation and water supply will be encouraged and the \ninstitutional capacity of service providers will be upgraded. In line with the goals of the national \npoverty  reduction strategy  (PRS),  the  Punjab  PRS  emphasizes  restoration  of  good  governance, \nenhancement  of  public  expenditure,  improvement  in  service  delivery  for  social  sectors,  and \naddressing environmental concerns, among key factors to reduce poverty in Punjab. An urban sector \nanalysis for Pakistan is in Appendix 3. \n \n15.  The proposed Project is formulated to support the Government\u2019s poverty reduction initiatives, \nas well as devolution of power and responsibility to local governments for providing and financing \nenvironmental sanitation, water supply services, and environmental support services. The Project \nincorporates several strategic features and incentives for participation, including: (i) promotion of \npolicy reforms in accordance with PLGO 2001; (ii) financial management and resource generation at \nthe levels of the TMA, UA, and WASA; (iii) priority for investments that meet the basic needs of urban \ncommunities; (iv) community participation and ownership; and (v) equity participation by UAs in \ninvestment packages. \n \n16.  ADB Strategy. The focus of ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008) for \nPakistan is on reducing poverty by providing help in the key strategic areas of good governance, \nsustainable pro-poor economic growth, and inclusive social development. ADB lending to devolved \nsectors will aim to strengthen devolution by ensuring that future ADB projects are consistent with the \nnew governance structure under PLGO 2001. Where appropriate, efforts will be made to realign ", "    5\nrecently approved ADB projects for devolved sectors. ADB\u2019s emphasis will remain on improving \ndelivery  of  social  services,  which  support  increased  public  sector  allocations  and  improved \ngovernance through devolution, sector administration, and financial management. ADB\u2019s water policy \nalso  supports  ADB\u2019s  strategy  for  poverty  reduction  by  addressing  each  of  the  three  framework \nelements  of  poverty  reduction:  pro-poor  sustainable  growth,  social  development,  and  good \ngovernance. The main focus of ADB assistance to the urban sector will be on environmental aspects \nand needs of the poor, and will broadly cover: (i) institutional restructuring and devolution of service \ndelivery; (ii) private sector involvement in the delivery of selected services; (iii) budgeting and finance, \nand increased cost recovery and municipal revenue; (iv) increased community participation; and \n(v) attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The Project will develop linkages with \nstrategies by forums such as the Global Water Partnership, World Water Council, and Water Supply \nand Sanitation Collaborative Council, to facilitate achievement of the vision, goals, and targets set in \nthe MDGs. \n \n17.  External  Assistance  to  the  Sector.  ADB  has  provided  eight  loans,  totaling  about \n$450 million, since beginning assistance to Pakistan\u2019s urban sector in 1976 (including loans for the \nwater supply, sanitation, and urban development sectors). Another $7.1 million was provided for TA \nprojects in water supply, sanitation, and urban development. So far, ADB projects in Pakistan\u2019s urban \nsector have focused on Sindh, North-West Frontier, and Punjab provinces. Japan has provided the \nlargest external support to the urban sector, and the World Bank has given the second largest \namount. Both donors mainly focused on Sindh and Punjab provinces. Other bilateral assistance is \nprovided by the governments of Germany, Kuwait, Netherlands, Switzerland, and United Kingdom. \nThe  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  along  with  United  Nations  International \nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), and World Health Organization (WHO), have provided assistance, mostly \nin community water supply and low-cost sanitation projects. Further details are in Appendix 4. \n \n18.  Lessons Learned. The key lessons learned from the phase 1 project are as follows: \n \n(i)  Project administration. Implementation delays can be avoided by: (a) streamlining \nlengthy administrative procedures for approval of selection of consultants; (b) avoiding \nfrequent turnover of the project director and qualified project management unit (PMU) \nstaff;  (c)  strengthening  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  and  holding  regular \nsteering committee meetings to take timely action on issues hindering implementation \nprogress; (d) improving consultants\u2019 performance to efficiently process and implement \nthe  subprojects;  (e)  making  timely  payments  to  contractors  and  consultants;  and \n(f) devolving decision making of noncritical issues to the appropriate lowest level.  \n(ii)  Institutional  aspects.  Efficient  municipal  urban  services  require  the  following: \n(a) continuity of policy\u2014management and senior operating staff are critical to maintain \ndirection  and  achieve  required  goals;  (b)  qualified  PMU  management  and  staff; \n(c) appointment  of  regular  EA  staff  in  PMU  instead  of  contract  staff  to  achieve \nsustainable institutional reforms; (d) autonomy of WASA\u2014for setting water tariffs to \nmeet its financial needs, engaging staff as necessary to operate and maintain the \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  system  to  acceptable  standards,  and  making  it \nindependent  of  budgetary  support  from  the  PG;  and  (e)  consistent  monitoring  of \ndevelopment impacts by the Government to achieve sustainability of the implemented \nreforms. \n \n19.  Key lessons learned from other ADB-financed projects for water supply and sanitation and \nurban development in Pakistan, as well as a review of multilateral and bilateral projects in Pakistan \nand the region, are summarized below. \n(i)  Project  accountability  and  transparency  are  undermined  by  failure  to  comply  with \nspecific  covenants,  delays  in  recruitment  of  consultants,  minimal  beneficiary \nparticipation,  poor  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  completed  facilities,  low \nfinancial and economic rates of return, and frequent changes in senior management. \n ", "6   \n(ii)  The quality of governance is critical to a project\u2019s success. Highly centralized project \nmanagement  adversely  affects  project  performance  and  ownership  by  major \nstakeholders. \n(iii)  All stakeholders should be fully involved in project identification and design from an \nearly  stage,  and  sufficient  information  should  be  gathered  regarding  the  active \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) and community-based organizations (CBOs) in \nthe project area to facilitate their involvement.16 \n(iv)  Community  participation  requires  intensive  interaction  among  the  project  team, \nparticipating community, and local authorities, and project must be relevant to service \nneeds. \n(v)  Women should be empowered to participate in decision making at the micro level to \nbring about constructive changes in the living conditions of the urban poor. \n(vi)  Institutional  strengthening  should  be  given  the  greatest  emphasis  and  carried  out \nsystematically. \n(vii)  Delays in start-up implementation should be avoided by taking advance procurement \nactions.  \n \n20.  A  main  lesson  learned  from  the  Karachi  Sewerage  Project17  is  that  the  sustainability  of \nsewerage projects can only be assured if the utility is in good financial health. Important lessons \nlearned  from  the  District  Towns  Water  Supply18  in  Bangladesh  and  Second  Water  Supply  and \nSanitation Project19 in Bangladesh emphasized: (i) a need for greater involvement of pourashava \n(municipality) and community in implementing environmental sanitation programs, (ii) training for \npourashava  personnel,  and  (iii)  monitoring  of  the  implementation  performance  of  the  EA  and \npourashava.  An  important  lesson  learned  from  the  Karnataka  Urban  Development  and  Coastal \nEnvironmental Management Project20 in India, which ADB started financing in early 1996, is that \nwomen should be empowered to participate in decision making at the micro level to bring about \nconstructive changes in the living conditions of the urban poor. Furthermore, people\u2019s perceptions of, \nand  attitudes  toward,  sanitation  must  be  changed  because  public  awareness  and  community \nparticipation are critical in any sanitation improvement program. Appendix 5 summarizes the lessons \nlearned and measures taken to incorporate these lessons into the proposed Project. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n21.  The expected impacts of the Project are improvements in living conditions, quality of life, and \nhealth of the people of Rawalpindi by improving water supply and sanitation facilities, solid waste \nmanagement,  wastewater  treatment,  and  slaughterhouse.  The  Project  will  result  in  sustainable \nreduction of environmental degradation and ensure sustainable operation of basic urban services. \n \n22.  The operational area of RT and WASA covers the inner city area, over 50 newly developed \ncolonies, and low-income slums. During the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA), low-\nincome areas were identified by undertaking the following: (i) extensive socioeconomic surveys to \nassess the status of urban service coverage, the need and demand for services, assessment of \nhousehold incomes, and willingness to pay for services; (ii) participatory analysis and planning with \nhouseholds (especially women\u2019s groups) which produced knowledge on the impact of poverty and \n                                                 \n16  ADB. 2003.

The proposals for \nimproving the urban environment and extending coverage of urban services were developed based \non the above, using lessons learned in the phase 1 project and other externally funded projects \n(Appendix 5).  \n \nB.  Outputs \n23.  The Project will comprise the following main components: (i) part A\u2014environmental sanitation; \n(ii) part B\u2014water supply services; and (iii) part C\u2014institutional development, including municipal \nmanagement  system  development,  environmental  support  services,  asset  management,  urban \ndevelopment, project implementation assistance, and incremental administration support. The project \ncomponents are described below. \n \n1.  Part A. Environmental Sanitation \na.  Sewerage System \n24.  Only 30% of Rawalpindi City is covered by the sewerage system, which was laid in Satellite \nTown  in  the  1950s  and  Khayaban-e-Sirsyed  in  1969.  Inappropriate  subdivision  of  urban  lots, \nincreasing population density, and corrosion and deterioration of pipes and seals have caused the \nnetwork pipes to leak continuously. The Project will install major sewerage networks which include:  \n(i) laying about (a) 160 kilometers (km) of sewerage network (trunk and area sewers) within the \nboundary limits of RT over 384 hectares (ha) to benefit a population of 190,000, and (b) secondary \nand lateral sewers in the catchment of existing trunk sewers in sewerage (SW) 02 and SW03;  \n(ii) construction of a transfer/outfall sewer to the STP; (iii) replacement of undersized sewers in \nidentified areas; (iv) environmental mitigation works upstream of Rawal Lake filtration plant; and \n(v) procurement of sewer cleaning equipment and machinery. \n \nb.  Sewage Treatment Plant \n25.  The STP will treat sewage from Rawalpindi and suburban areas, which will be received \nthrough a 24.5 km box conduit along the Lai Nullah and Soan River. Waste will be treated in \nstabilization  ponds.  The  quantity  of  sewage  from  the  city  and  suburban  areas  (with  about \n1.4 million inhabitants) is 141,000 cubic meters per day (m3/day) and is expected to increase to \n272,000  m3/day  by  2025.  The  STP  will  be  designed  for  projected  demand  in  2025  but  plant \nconstruction in this phase will be for 2015, with a projected flow of 199,000 m3/day. Treated effluent \nwill  be  disposed  of  in  the  Soan  River.  The  effluent  must  comply  with  Pakistan\u2019s  National \nEnvironmental Quality Standards. About 250 ha will be required for the plant. Components will include \ninlet  and  outlet  structures,  forestation,  laboratory,  administration  buildings,  and  protection  bunds \nagainst the Soan River. The conceptual design and layout have been prepared for 4 meter (m) deep \nanaerobic ponds, 2.5 m deep facultative ponds, and 1.5 m deep maturation ponds.  \n \nc.  Stormwater Drainage  \n26.  The stormwater draining component includes: (i) remodeling existing drains and construction \nof new drains at selected areas such as Asghar Mall Road, Jamia Masjid Road, the general bus \nstand, Nia Mohallah, and Eidgah Road; and (ii) carrying out (a) bank protection works at critical \nlocations of Lai Nullah to mitigate negative impacts from floods, and (b) the necessary works for the \nprotection of the rights-of-way of Lai Nullah. \n \nd.  Solid Waste Management \n27.  A public\u2013private partnership program has been proposed to: (i) improve solid waste collection, \ntransportation, and disposal; and (ii) augment RT\u2019s capacity. This is an innovative approach that \nmeets the Government\u2019s decentralization and devolution goals. UAs, with the help of experienced \n ", "8   \nNGOs  and  private  partners,  will  collect  solid  waste  in  their  constituencies  and  dispose  of  it  at \ndesignated transfer stations. RT, with the assistance of private agencies, will be responsible for final \ndisposal of solid waste at the landfill. This component will consist of: (i) institutional strengthening of \nRT; (ii) procurement of vehicles and equipment; (iii) construction of solid waste transfer stations and \nprovision of garbage bins throughout the city; (iv) development of a new lined uncovered sanitary \nlandfill  site  with  a  leachate  collection  system  in  Mouza  Losar,  30  km  east  of  Rawalpindi; \n(v) preparation and implementation of a community participation program; (vi) establishment of a solid \nwaste  recycling  and  composting  program;  (vii)  development  of  licensing  and  institutionalizing  of \nscavengers; and (viii) privatization of solid waste management systems. The 30 ha landfill site will \nreplace the temporary landfill site near central Rawalpindi. The new landfill site is expected to fulfill \nsolid waste management requirements until 2010\u20132011. Solid waste segregation is to be carried out \nat the community level. Bins and other adequate facilities will be provided for this purpose.  \n \ne.  Slaughterhouse and Public Toilets \n28.  Two slaughterhouses currently exist in Rawalpindi. The goat slaughterhouse in the city center \nis old, and its sewerage and drainage facilities are inadequate. Waste from this slaughterhouse poses \na health hazard and disturbs adjoining areas. The other slaughterhouse at Sihala, in an industrial \nestate  outside  Rawalpindi,  is  jointly  operated  by  Rawalpindi  Cantonment  Board  (RCB),  Capital \nDevelopment Authority, and RT. The Project proposes to build additional hygienic, environmentally \nacceptable slaughterhouse facilities on the premises of the existing Sihala slaughterhouse. This would \nprovide a cost-effective solution with no land acquisition costs. \n \n29.  Rawalpindi has very few public toilets, which are in poor conditions because of inadequate \nO&M. The Project will construct about 15 properly designed, suitably located public toilets connected \nto the nearby sewer network\u2014near shopping centers, bus stops, and densely populated areas. \nRegular water supply will be enhanced through overhead tanks. O&M of the toilets will be undertaken \nby the private sector and revenues collected through user fees, following the example of similar \nsuccessful programs in the region.21 \n \n2.  Part B. Improving Water Supply \n30.  This component will improve the service and quality of existing water distribution systems.  \nIt will increase revenues by updating consumer databases, converting illegal connections to registered \naccounts, detecting and repairing leaks, and monitoring water quality. Distribution systems will be \nextended  or  rehabilitated  for  poorly  served  low-income  communities  with  scarce  or  brackish \ngroundwater. This component will include: (i) replacement of about 29 contaminated and/or inefficient \ntubewells  and  rehabilitation  of  32  existing  tubewells;  and  (ii)  construction  or  rehabilitation  of \ndistribution systems, including the rehabilitation of storage reservoirs and the supply and installation of \n50,000 water meters. It will also include a water quality and monitoring program to be conducted by \nWASA and the private sector, review and finalization of Rawalpindi master plan for water supply, and \nfeasibility studies of additional water supply sources as part of the respective master plan. Under this \ncomponent, the agreed PG policy for water supply (Appendix 2) will be implemented and updated \nfollowing the water audit to be undertaken within a year of loan effectiveness. A comprehensive water \naudit will verify coverage, service level, status of actual payment of water dues and use of NRW, and \nexamine people\u2019s access to water. \n \n31.  As a priority, all schools in the project area will be provided latrines and safe drinking water \nconnections. Health and hygiene education will be promoted. The Project will monitor the effects of \nimprovements in water quality on health, especially child stunting, by organizing a representative \nsample study and project performance management system (PPMS). \n \n                                                 \n21  Good examples are the Sulabh (privately financed) and Pune (publicly financed) public pay toilets in India; the ongoing \nsuccessful experience in Karachi through the Citizen Police Liaison Committee; TMA toilets (public\u2013private partnership); \nand a similar program that was initiated in Lahore in 2003 by the Lahore Horticulture Department. ", "    9\n3.  Part C. Institutional Development \na.  Municipal Management System Development \n32.  Planned  interventions  under  the  institutional  development  subcomponent  will  include  \n(i) training in technical and financial management for RT and WASA staff, including mapping and \nasset management; (ii) increasing public awareness on urban issues, water quality, sustainability of \nfacilities,  and  options  for  improving  delivery  of  urban  services;  (iii)  improving  municipal  financial \nmanagement by introducing improved accounting procedures and management information systems \nthat  include  budgeting,  resource  mobilization,  enhanced  O&M  of  assets,  and  improved  billing, \nrevenue collection, and reporting systems; and (iv) establishing regulatory systems to ensure that \nlaws, standards, rules, and regulations are equitably and consistently applied. These interventions are \ncritical to the long-term sustainability of urban centers. Wherever possible, technical training will be \nlinked to measurable outputs to help determine whether skill levels have been achieved and technical \ntraining is applied. The design and implementation of measures for institutional strengthening will be \ncoordinated with training programs provided under other ongoing programs.  \n \nb.  Environmental Support Services  \n33.  An  environmentally  sound  urban  development  plan  will  be  elaborated  to  ensure  a  well-\nmanaged urban expansion in a fast-growing city with high demand for housing. This will include \npreparation  of  base  as  well  as  geographic  information  systems  (GIS)  mapping  of  RT/WASA \nadministered areas. \n \n34.  Land use, zoning, and building laws will also be revised and legislated to control urban \nexpansion and monitor water and sanitation connections and charges. A comprehensive database will \nbe available through this subcomponent to enable the asset management and billing departments of \nRawalpindi Development Authority (RDA), RT, and WASA to increase and maintain revenue, in \naddition to controlling and guiding urban development, and improving urban transport. \n \nc.  Asset Management \n35.  The  assets  of  WASA  and  RT  are  scattered  and  no  records  are  readily  available.  This \nsubcomponent will also set up a separate asset management section to maintain, update, and record \nassets, resulting in greater transparency and sustainability. \n \nd.  Urban Development  \n36.  A baseline survey and GIS mapping of additional specified areas are proposed under this \nsubcomponent,  as  are  detailed  land  use,  housing,  and  consumer  surveys.  This  will  lead  to \ndevelopment of land use and urban housing databases to identify areas available for development. \nThese actions are vital for both urban development and consumer records of water supply and \nsanitation. \n \ne.  Project Implementation Assistance \n37.  The project implementation assistance component will comprise various types of consulting \nservices, including project implementation support to the PMU for infrastructure design, construction \nsupervision, community development, and institutional strengthening. \n \nf.  Incremental Administration Support \n38.  Incremental administrative support for project implementation is required for the PMU, which, \nheaded by a project director, will be responsible for coordination among RT, RDA, and WASA for \nplanning  and  management  of  project  activities.  The  PMU  will  include  eight  professional  staff, \nrepresenting different disciplines, and administrative support staff.  \n \n ", "10  \nC.  Special Features \n39.  Following  the  Southern  Punjab  Basic  Urban  Services  Project,  this  is  the  second  ADB-\nsupported investment project in urban development to make concerted efforts to align its scope and \nfocus,  and  institutional  and  financing  modalities,  with  the  new  governance  structure  under \nPLGO 2001.  The  Project  supports  the  PG  and  CDR  authorities  for  adoption  of  arrangements \nenvisaged under PLGO 2001. The Project has a number of special features with respect to devolution \nand collateral policy actions. The project design seeks to ensure that execution arrangements do not \ncompromise the devolved authorities of the CDR. Project implementation follows the spirit of PLGO \n2001, shifting from vertical to horizontal programming. It offers particular assistance to the transition \nfrom programs that are vertical and province-driven to programs that the CDR (through WASA and \nRT) should carry out autonomously. \n \n40.  In  the  past,  a  top-down  approach  was  used  in  project  preparation  but  the  Project  was \ndesigned in close collaboration with the CDR, beneficiaries, and NGOs at the grassroots level. In \naddition to extensive meetings in the field with these groups, three consultative workshops were \norganized  at  the  inception,  interim,  and  final  stages  of  the  PPTA.  In  the  final  workshop,  all \nstakeholders endorsed the proposed scope and implementation arrangements of the Project, which \nconfirms that the project scope is strictly in line with the urgent need for improved environmental and \nbasic urban services. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n41.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $85.7 million equivalent (including taxes and \nduties), comprising $12.5 million equivalent (14.6%) in foreign exchange costs (including $1.1 million \nin interest charges during construction) and $73.2 million equivalent (85.4%) in local currency costs. \nTable 1 summarizes the estimated costs and detailed costs are in Appendix 6. \n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates by Component \n($ million) \nItem  Foreign Exchange  Local Currency  Total Cost \nA.

Financing Plan \n42.  The Government has requested two loans: one of $40 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund [ADF]) and a second of $20 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources (OCR) to help finance the Project. \n \n43.  The ADF loan will be provided from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with a 32-year term, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an  interest  rate  of  1%  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5% \nthereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth \nin the draft loan agreement.   \n \n44.  The OCR loan of $20 million equivalent will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of \n5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, no front-end fee, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The Government has provided ADB with: \n(i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of \nthese terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n45.  The ADB loans will cover the entire foreign exchange cost ($12.5 million), including interest \nand other charges amounting to $1.1 million, and will finance $47.5 million equivalent (64.9%) of the \nlocal currency costs. The local currency cost to be financed by ADB will cover portions of the civil \nworks, vehicles, consulting services, project management support, and land\u2014excluding duties and \ntaxes. ADB\u2019s financing of local currency expenditure is justified by the nature of the Project, which will \naddress poverty, gender, and environment issues within the project area. The financing of land \nacquisition will be carried out in accordance with the requirements of R193-05 Cost Sharing and \nEligibility of Expenditures for Asian Development Bank Financing: A New Approach, and the detailed \nstaff instructions to be promulgated thereto. \n \n46.  ADB will provide the loan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, which will relend it to the PG on \nthe same terms and conditions. The foreign exchange risk will, however, be borne by the PG, which \nwill make the loan proceeds available to CDR as a grant.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n47.  The Executing Agency (EA) for the Project will be the CDR. WASA will be the Implementing \nAgency  (IA)  for  the  sewerage  system  and  STP  subcomponents,  and  improving  water  supply \ncomponent. RT will be the IA for the storm water drainage, solid waste management, slaughterhouse, \nand public toilets subcomponents. RDA will be the IA for the environmental support services and \n ", "12  \nurban  development  subcomponents.  WASA  and  RT  will  be  the  joint  IAs  for  the  municipal \nmanagement system development and asset management subcomponents.  \n \n48.  The EA will establish a PMU headed by the project director and located at WASA. The PMU, \ncomprising professional staff (Appendix 7) supported by a team of consultants, will: (i) assist CDR, \nRT, RDA, and WASA in providing policy guidance and implementing the project components; and \n(ii) support monitoring and evaluation of project implementation. The implementation framework is in \nAppendix 7. \n \n49.  For internal coordination, two committees will be set up within 3 months of loan effectiveness: \n(i)  A  project  implementation  review  committee:  headed  by  the  CDR  nazim  (head); \ncomprising director general of RDA, managing director of WASA, the RT and Pothar \ntown nazims, a city district officer of CDR, and one elected female representative from \nthe  district  council.  This  committee  will  review  the  implementation  progress  of  all \nproject components at least once every 3 months. \n(ii)  A project steering committee: headed by the Chairman, Planning and Development \nBoard, PG; comprising senior officials from P&D; Housing, Urban Development, and \nPublic  Health  Engineering  Department  (HUD&PHED);  the  PG  finance  department; \nRDA; WASA; and CDR and RT nazims. This committee will be set up at P&D, PG in \nLahore  to  ensure  smooth  and  orderly  implementation,  provide  policy  guidance  on \nongoing  and  new  government  initiatives,  and  resolve  interagency  problems.  The \ncommittee will meet at least once every 6 months and decisions of the meetings will be \nreported to ADB.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n50.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years and will be completed in March 2011. The \nimplementation schedule for all project components is in Appendix 8. \n \n3.  Procurement \n51.  All procurement services for the Project will follow ADB's Guidelines for Procurement and the \nrules and regulations of the Government. Contracts for civil works that are estimated to cost more \nthan $5 million equivalent will be issued using international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. \nContracts estimated to cost $5 million equivalent or less will be carried out through local competitive \nbidding (LCB) procedures. Minor development and maintenance may be carried out on a force \naccount  basis.  The  procurement  of  goods  will  preferably  be  grouped  into  packages  larger  than \n$500,000 to be suitable for ICB procedures. Miscellaneous minor goods that cannot be grouped into \nlarger contracts, and are estimated to cost less than $500,000 per contract, will be procured through \ninternational shopping (IS) procedures. Minor items estimated to cost less than $100,000 equivalent \nper contract may be purchased directly, following proper procedures to ensure economy, efficiency, \nand quality. Proposed contract packages are in Appendix 9. \n \n52.  To expedite implementation, the PMU will take advance action on recruiting all consultants \nand prequalifying the contractors. The PG has been informed that the approval of advance actions \ndoes not commit ADB to finance project expenditures. \n \n53.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the Government and PG. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and transparency, ADB reserves \nthe right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive or \ncoercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy are included in the Loan Regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. \nIn particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions ", "    13\nspecifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency \nand all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n54.  To support project implementation and build the long-term capacity of RT and WASA, which \nare responsible for the planning and delivery of urban services, 1,478 person-months of consulting \nservices (18 international and 1,460 domestic person-months) will be provided, covering: (i) Package \nA: project management and implementation support to the PMU, including subproject detailed design, \nconstruction supervision, and monitoring and evaluation (13 international and 1,152 domestic person-\nmonths); (ii) Package B: institutional development (5 international and 164 domestic person-months); \nand (iii) Package C: community development and participation (144 domestic person-months), which \nwill be contracted to local NGOs and individual social mobilizers. Supplementary Appendix B gives \nmore details. \n \n55.  The consultants for the domestic person-months under Package A and B will be selected as \nfirms. The selection and engagement of the firms  will be in accordance with the quality-and-cost-\nbased selection method under ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants or other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The consultants for the international \nperson-months under the same packages will be selected as individual consultants. The Package C \nconsulting services will be contracted to individual social mobilizers or local NGOs for facilitating the \nimplementation of the solid waste component and community mobilization for the water supply and \nsewerage components. The individual social mobilizer will be selected as individual consultant and \nthe local NGOs will be selected as firms using the quality-based selection (QBS) method under ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants or other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement \nof domestic consultants. The use of QBS under Package C is due to the specialized nature of the \nassignment. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n56.  To facilitate financial control, disbursement categories will be established by component and \nby expenditure type (work, goods, and services). The PMU will prepare disbursement projections and \nrequest budget allocations for counterpart funds. CDR will establish an imprest account in the name of \nthe  PMU  at  the  National  Bank  of  Pakistan  (immediately  after  loan  effectiveness)  to  expedite \ndisbursement of loan proceeds, in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook and detailed \narrangements between the Government and ADB. Except as ADB may otherwise agree, the account \nwill consist of advances based on estimates of anticipated expenditure to be incurred for a 6-month \nperiod or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. The ADB statement of expenditures (SOE) \nprocedure may be used to reimburse eligible expenditures and to liquidate and replenish advances \nmade into the imprest account for individual payment transactions not exceeding $100,000. The CDR \nwill coordinate the timely release of funds and maintain acceptable levels of financial control.  \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n57.  The CDR, acting through the PMU, will maintain records and accounts adequate to identify \nworks, goods, and services financed by the loan proceeds. Specifically, the CDR will: (i) maintain \nseparate accounts for the Project; (ii) ensure that project accounts and financial statements are \naudited annually in accordance with sound accounting principles by independent auditors acceptable \nto ADB; and (iii) submit to ADB, not later than 6 months after the close of each fiscal year, certified \ncopies of audited accounts and financial statements and the auditor\u2019s report on them. Furthermore, \nunaudited financial statements will be provided to ADB no later than 6 months following the end of the \nfiscal year. Audit of the project accounts will include an audit of the use of the imprest account and \nSOE procedures, and the annual audit report will have a separate audit opinion on the use of these \nprocedures. \n \n ", "14  \n58.  The  PMU  will  prepare  monthly  progress  reports,  in  a  format  acceptable  to  ADB,  with \ninformation  on:  (i)  progress  made  against  established  targets,  including  pre-identified  monitoring \nindicators; (ii) delays and problems encountered, and actions taken to resolve them; (iii) work carried \nout by the consultants; (iv) updated results of water quality monitoring and action taken on problems \nencountered;  (v)  progress  made  on  PPMS;  (vi)  compliance  with  loan  covenants;  (vii)  proposed \nprogram of activities for the next month; and (viii) progress expected during the next 3 months. The \nmonthly report will be submitted to ADB by the end of the first week of the following month. Within \n3 months of physical completion of the Project, the CDR will prepare and submit to ADB a project \ncompletion report on the execution of the Project, including costs and compliance with the loan \ncovenants. \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n59.  A short list of verifiable performance indicators for monitoring and evaluation was prepared in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Project  Performance  Management  System  (Supplementary  Appendix  C) \nduring the PPTA. The PG, CDR, and PMU will ensure that comprehensive PPMS is established within \n9 months of loan effectiveness and maintained to monitor and evaluate the technical performance and \nsocial and economic benefits of the Project, especially for the poor and for women. The performance \nmonitoring  indicators  and  procedures  will  be  tested  with  respect  to  data  availability  and  other \nconstraints, revised if necessary, and institutionalized as part of the Project\u2019s MIS. The PMU will be \nresponsible  for  establishing  the  PPMS,  and  monitoring  and  assessment  of  the  performance  of \nsubprojects at 6-month intervals. To measure the Project\u2019s impact on beneficiaries, particularly low-\nincome groups, baseline information established during the PPTA will be updated at the beginning of \nimplementation of each project component. This information will be the basis for determining the \nresulting  impacts.  Indicators  that  can  be  monitored  will  comprise:  (i)  institutional  development \nindicators,  covering  revenue  generation,  financial  management,  and  O&M;  (ii)  subproject \nimplementation indicators for the various categories and types of urban infrastructure, including levels \nof coverage and service delivery; and (iii) sectoral impact indicators, covering economic growth, public \nhealth, and community participation. The CDR will continue to update and forward to ADB the PPMS \nand MIS at 6 month intervals for at least 3 years after project completion. In addition, following the \nwater audit, a civil society task force will be established to monitor implementation of the Government \nPolicy (Appendix 2). \n \n8.  Project Review \n60.  The Project will be reviewed jointly by the EA and ADB semiannually to assess progress and \nwill undergo a more comprehensive review at midterm. Taking into account the PPMS results, the \nmidterm  review  will:  (i)  evaluate  the  Project\u2019s  scope,  design,  and  implementation  arrangements; \n(ii) evaluate  the  progress  of  the  institutional  reform  and  infrastructure  development  components; \n(iii) identify  changes  needed  in  any  or  all  of  the  above  areas;  (iv)  assess  the  implementation \nperformance  against  agreed  targets  in  the  project  framework;  (v)  identify  critical  issues  and \nconstraints, if any; and (vi) recommend adjustments to the project design and/or implementation \narrangements, if necessary. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Beneficiaries \n61.  The Project will improve the living conditions of about 1.4 million residents of Rawalpindi city,22 \nby  enhancing  the  quality  of  life  and  health,  improving  the  environment,  and  creating  conditions \nconducive  to  sustained  urban  development  and  economic  growth.  The  Project will  contribute  to \nreduce  mortality,  morbidity,  and  poverty;  and  help  mitigate  the  loss  of  amenity  associated  with \nenvironmental degradation in the city, especially among slum inhabitants and poor groups (particularly \n                                                 \n22  The city population is 1.4 million, excluding the cantonment area, out of the total population of Rawalpindi (2.2 million). ", "    15\nwomen and children). The Project will support improvements to the capacity of RT and WASA by \nimproving  their  financial  and  operational  management  and  planning,  including  local  resource \ngeneration. A summary of project benefits and beneficiaries is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n62.  The effectiveness and sustainability of these improvements will be reinforced by efforts aimed \nat community development and revenue improvement. These efforts will also lead to: (i) a stronger \nsense of belonging at local level; and (ii) increased capacities of the RT and WASA to carry out their \nduties  more  effectively\u2014especially  to  provide  better  O&M  for  existing,  rehabilitated,  and  new \ninfrastructure facilities, and meet people\u2019s needs. \n \n63.  Community Involvement. Three consultative workshops attended by NGOs, CBOs, private \nand public sector representatives, and other stakeholders were held during the preparation of this \nProject to undertake brainstorming for each project component and its investment. \n \n64.  The Project will encourage and strengthen collective action within low-income and under-\nserviced localities. A main objective of this work will be to make RT infrastructure investment more \nresponsive to the demands of low-income groups\u2014more inclusive, more sustainable, and more cost-\neffective  than  supply-driven  approaches.  A secondary  objective  will  be  to  empower  low-income \ngroups by making them capable of collective action through CBOs and UAs, and by forming functional \nlinks  among  communities,  CBOs,  and  UAs  (e.g.,  location,  planning,  construction,  and  long-term \nmaintenance of the public toilets proposed under the Project).  \n \n65.  The concept of community mobilization and participation in developing urban infrastructure is \nnot new in Pakistan. The Orangi Pilot Project in Karachi simplified sanitation designs to make them \naffordable and technically viable for local implementation. It also involved training in community \norganization and technical details as well as supervision and organized work through local residents \nat the zone (ward) level. \n \n66.  To strengthen community participation in local level governance in Rawalpindi, the Project will \nundertake the following measures: (i) ward level committees (including beneficiary groups and elected \nUA councilors) will be formed to manage solid waste collection; (ii) various lanes will gather solid \nwaste at a convenient place for onward transport to a transfer station, and a committee will be given a \ntransfer trolley to be maintained by the community or NGO; (iii) a local committee, NGO, or CBO will \nconduct training for planning of sanitation and other activities in its area; (iv) public service committees \nwill be formed to monitor public toilets and drinking fountains; and (v) local finance management \ncommittees and a civil society task force will be formed to monitor the outcomes and impact of budget \nand policy decisions.  \n \n67.  Poverty  Reduction.  Socioeconomic  surveys  in  Rawalpindi  show  that  35%  of  sample \nhouseholds,  with  an  average  family  size  of  6.5  persons,  have  a  monthly  income  of  less  than \nPRs6,000 ($100), which reflects per capita income far below the poverty line of $1 per day. Urban \npoverty in Rawalpindi is multifaceted, ranging from lack of employment to deficiencies in basic urban \nservices such as water and sewerage and solid waste disposal, to substandard housing. The surveys \nshow that 53% of households are receiving piped water for 2\u20134 hours per day, while 35% receive it for \nless than 2 hours per day. Among households sampled, only 35% had access to sewerage. The \ncombination of shortage of good quality water with inadequate sewerage systems has adversely \naffected public health and the urban environment. Solid waste collection and disposal among poorer \nhouseholds is almost nonexistent. Solid waste is thrown into drains or open lots, attracting flies and \nrodents.  Households  suffer  from  various  degrees  of  environmental  pollution  through  disposal  of \nwastewater in open drains and flooding of such wastewater in residential neighborhoods.  \n \n68.  The Project will provide water to poor communities through piped distribution systems, while \nthe environmental sanitation component will provide for expanded sewerage pipe networks to low-\nincome areas and an STP for the entire Rawalpindi city. Systems will be designed to give the urban \n ", "16  \npoor adequate access to improved sanitation. The expected benefits are public hygiene and health \nimprovement as well as direct economic benefits from lower water costs in low-income areas and \nreduced  pollution  of  groundwater.  Improved  solid  waste  management  and  recycling  with  the \ninvolvement of communities, NGOs, and UAs will also generate employment for the urban poor \n(especially women) who work as sanitary workers. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is \nin Appendix 11. \n \n69.  Gender. A large portion of project benefits will accrue to women. Women\u2019s time and energy \nwill be saved by provision of water supply to households through pipes or communal water points. \nWomen  will  also  benefit  from  improved  sewerage:  (i)  women  spend  more  time  in  residential \nneighborhoods than men and will benefit more from improved hygiene; and (ii) women are traditionally \ncharged with the care of sick family members and will thus benefit more from reduced illness. The \nProject will address gender issues by (i) strengthening the role of women councilors in municipal \ngovernance; (ii) involving women\u2019s groups in community-level project activities; (iii) including women \nof local government institutions in training activities; and (iv) conducting community training and \nmobilization campaigns for project beneficiaries in wards at the UA level to ensure active participation \nof women. Appendix 11 includes a gender strategy approved by the PG. \n \n70.  Economic and Financial Benefits. Economic and financial analyses were undertaken in \naccordance with ADB's Framework for the Economic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development \nSector Projects (Appendixes 12 and 13). The economic benefits identified were based on each \ncomponent in Rawalpindi. Economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) were prepared for the sewerage \nnetwork and STP, water supply, and solid waste management. Benefits include significant poverty \nreduction and improvements in living conditions, particularly in the health and hygiene of the largely \npoor urban population\u2014mainly through sewer connections and improved collection and disposal of \nsolid waste. Sewage treatment is expected to provide additional water for agricultural production, \nreduce environmental hazards, and provide additional income. \n \n71.  The refurbishment and replacement of the old water supply network will entail health and non-\nincremental  benefits,  including:  (i)  savings  in  productive  time  due  to  reduction  in  sickness  from \ncontaminated water, (ii) greater availability of saleable water due to reduction in water wastage from \nleaks, and (iii) increased water revenue and better sustainability due to increased sales to new \ncustomers. In the old areas of Rawalpindi that have aging water supply networks, larger size plots \nhave been subdivided into multiple units. However, the number of water connections has remained \nthe same, resulting in a sizeable revenue loss. With improvement in the network, revenue is expected \nto increase significantly. These benefits are based on consumers\u2019 willingness to pay. \n \n72.  The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the solid waste subproject is 7.3%, 2.7% for \nsewerage and storm water drainage subproject, and 6.2% for water supply. For the purpose of \ncalculating FIRRs, a conservative estimate is based on the assumption that the collection efficiency of \nuser fees is 80% (compared with the 95% target), the project implementation period takes 8 years \n(instead  of  5 years  as  planned),  and  in  the  case  of  WASA,  non-revenue  water  remains  50% \n(compared  with  the  20%  target).  Since  WASA  has  initiated  a  consumer  survey  to  update  the \nconsumer database, several thousand illegal connections will be legalized. Furthermore, concrete \nmeasures  such  as  organizational  development  are  being  taken  to  enhance  revenue  collection \nefficiency and comply with the agreed tariff plan. Government policy (Appendix 2) demonstrates \nagreed  action  to  ensure  financial  sustainability.  All  these  factors  will  contribute  to  considerable \nincrease in revenue. The FIRRs (except sewerage and the storm water drainage subproject) exceed \nthe weighted average cost of capital (about 5%), demonstrating that the Project is financially viable at \nproposed tariff levels. Low FIRRs, in the case of sewerage and drainage, reflect nonpayment of user \nfees for the storm water drainage subproject and the conservative assumption that only 60% of ", "    17\ntargeted connections would be made, considering lessons learned in earlier projects in Pakistan such \nas the Second Urban Development Project23 in North-West Frontier Province (Appendix 12).  \n \n73.  The  EIRR  calculation  was  undertaken  in  constant  2004  prices  using  the  domestic  price \nnumeraire, since the outputs are non-tradeable in nature. Economic costs (excluding taxes and \nmarket distortions) are converted using a standard conversion factor of 0.9. The EIRRs of the project \ncomponents are 21.6% for water supply, 12.4% for sewerage, 15.8% for sewage treatment, 16.8% for \ndrainage, and 21.1% for solid waste management. The overall project EIRR is estimated to be 15.8%. \nSwitching values and sensitivity indicators were tested and standard and project-specific sensitivity \nanalysis was conducted. All project components were found to be economically viable under adverse \ncost-benefit scenarios. \n \nB.  Social and Environmental Safeguards \n74.  Social. The EA has prepared a draft resettlement plan (RP) for the Project following national \nlaws and policies: (i) Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (amended up to 2003); (ii) National Resettlement \nPolicy, 2002; (iii) Project Implementation and Resettlement of Affected Persons Ordinance, 2001; \n(iii) Punjab Development of Cities Ordinance, 1981; and (iv) Pakistan Environmental Protection Act, \n1997. The RP also follows ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, 1995. The RP is summarized in \nAppendix 10 and the entire document is in Supplementary Appendix D. The Project is designed to \nminimize land acquisition and resettlement impacts. The resettlement and land acquisition under the \nProject was carried out in accordance with the requirements of R193-05 Cost Sharing and Eligibility of \nExpenditures for Asian Development Bank Financing: A New Approach and the related draft OM \nSection  H3/BP.    The  Cost  Sharing  and  Eligibility  of  Expenditures  for  Asian  Development  Bank \nFinancing: A New Approach paper is broadly consistent with that of the World Bank and follows \nclosely the rationale and presentation in its Eligibility of Expenditures in World Bank Lending: A New \nPolicy  Framework.  Therefore,  as  instructed  by  ADB\u2019s  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development \nDepartment, the formulation of the resettlement plan, including land acquisition, was also guided by \nthe detailed staff instructions issued by World Bank\u2019s Operations Policy and Country Services, in \nBank Financing: Guidelines to Staff, April 16 2004. A total of 284 ha is required for the STP, solid \nwaste transfer stations and landfill site, and service corridors (right-of-way) for laying trunk sewers and \nmaintaining storm drains. The proposed STP site was chosen because it minimizes resettlement \nimpacts, although it is not the most technically feasible option.  \n \n75.  Land  acquisition  for  the  250  ha  proposed  STP  site  will  affect  197  landowners  and \n36 tenants/agricultural workers. The proposed solid waste transfer station and landfill site (32 ha) will \nbe constructed in government-owned land. There are two brick structures occupied by transient brick \nworkers in the proposed landfill site. To the extent possible, the sewerage network and storm drain \ncomponents  prioritize  rehabilitation  of  existing  infrastructure  to  avoid  resettlement  impacts.  The \nacquisition of 2 ha is required for 7 m service corridors for the sewerage system and 8\u201310 m service \ncorridors for storm drains. The sewerage network will partially affect 370 houses. Approximately \n28 houses will be partially affected by the storm drain subcomponent. The Project is not expected to \ncause large-scale movement of people to distant locations. The overall impacts are to be further \nminimized  through  careful  component  siting  and  alignment  during  detailed  design.  The  EA  has \nassured ADB the implementation of the RP (finalized during detailed design in accordance with \ngovernment laws and policies and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement).  \n \n76.  The Project provides direct social benefits through improvement and increased access to \nenvironmental sanitation and water supply\u2014enhancing quality of life and health, the environment, and \nthe potential for sustained urban development and economic growth. Social assessments undertaken \nduring the PPTA reviewed the cultural and ethnic diversity of people in Rawalpindi. Analysis showed \n                                                 \n23  ADB. 1989.

The RP ensures \nthat  vulnerable  groups  including  indigenous  people  affected  by  land  acquisition  and  involuntary \nresettlement will be given additional assistance. \n \n77.  Environment. The EA has prepared an environmental impact assessment (EIA) following \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines.  The  main  findings  were \nsummarized in a summary environmental impact assessment (SEIA) circulated to the ADB Board and \nposted on ADB\u2019s website in July 2005. The salient points of the approved SEIA (Supplementary \nAppendix F) are summarized in Appendix 14. \n \n78.  The SEIA shows that the Project will result in net environmental benefits, including improved \nground and surface water quality, and improved solid waste and sewage collection and treatment. \nThis will significantly improve health and quality of life in Rawalpindi, as well as agriculture and fishing \nin the Soan River downstream. Potential adverse impacts during construction and operation have \nbeen identified. Some impacts are minor and easily mitigated while others are potentially significant, \nlong-term, and irreversible if suggested mitigation measures and monitoring plans are not enforced. \nDraft  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs)  and  associated  monitoring  plans  have  been \ndeveloped  for  this  purpose.  The  EA  has  assured  the  implementation  of  EMPs  and  associated \nmonitoring  plans  (finalized  during  detailed  design  in  accordance  with  government  environmental \nregulations and policies, and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy), and incorporation of mitigation measures \nidentified in the SEIA and EIA in design and bidding documents. \n \nC.  Risks \n79.  Major risks associated with the Project include the following. \n(i)   Acquisition of required land may be delayed or not forthcoming, which could delay or \nimpede implementation of certain subprojects. \n(ii)  Frequent turnover of trained staff and delayed decision making on critical issues by the \nCDR, WASA, and RDA could jeopardize project benefits. \n(iii)  Future legislation could gradually erode the comprehensiveness and consistency of \nPLGO 2001, which could seriously impede CDR\u2019s effectiveness as a main actor in \nproject implementation. \n(iv)  Implementation of the agreed Government Policy (Appendix 2) could be delayed and \nefforts for enhancement of the revenue base and institutional strengthening of the RT \nand the WASA may not give sufficient and sustainable results. This could affect project \nimplementation or the long-term sustainability of improvements, or both. \n \n80.   CDR will initiate the land acquisition process before loan approval to avoid implementation \ndelays. Close monitoring and early flagging for action by the project implementation review and \nsteering committees will minimize the risk of delayed decision making. Considering lessons learned \nfrom the phase 1 project, the PG has provided a firm commitment to minimize staff turnover and \nrecruit qualified staff for PMU, WASA, and RT. Strict attention to timely project progress reporting, \nincluding  staffing  and  accounting,  will  also  help.  The  Government  is  particularly  committed  to \ndevolution reform, especially capacity building of RT and WASA. The Project is a timely contribution \nto the devolution process. The risk of delays in implementing the Government Policy will be minimized \nby a water audit that will lead to updating the Government Policy, and its monitoring by a civil society \ntask force.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n81.  The Government, the PG and the CDR have given the following specific assurances, in \naddition to the standard assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents.

Any adverse environmental impacts arising from the construction, \noperation and implementation of the project facilities will be minimized by implementing \nthe EMPs and associated monitoring plans, and PG will implement all mitigation and \nmonitoring measures specified in the EIA and SEIA. Project implementation will include \nconsultation  with  local  communities  on  environmental  issues  and  all  necessary \nenvironmental clearances will be obtained from the Punjab Environmental Protection \nDepartment for all applicable components prior to starting any construction activities. The \nGovernment  will  ensure  environmental  requirements  will  be  incorporated  in  bidding \ndocuments and civil works contracts. \n(viii)  The Government will update the draft resettlement plan (RP) based on final detailed \ndesign. The Government will submit the revised RP to ADB for review and approval prior \nto award of any related civil works contracts. \n(ix)  The Government will ensure that all land and right-of-way required for the Project are \nmade available in a timely manner, adequate compensations are provided prior to the \nsigning of relevant civil works contracts, and involuntary resettlement is carried out in \naccordance with the updated resettlement plan agreed upon between the Government \nand ADB, the Government\u2019s land acquisition and resettlement laws and regulations, and \nADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement 1995. \n(x)  PG and CDR will ensure that no civil contracts will be awarded over the Mouza Losar \nlandfill site until outstanding complaints regarding compensation for the purchase of the \nsite have been redressed in accordance with (a) the updated resettlement plan agreed \nupon between the PG and ADB, (b) the Government\u2019s land acquisition and resettlement \nlaws and regulations, and (c) ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, 1995.  \n(xi)  The Government will ensure that the Project will not negatively impact on vulnerable \ngroups and be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples, 1998 \nand Policy on Gender and Development, 2003. \n ", "20  \n(xii)  PG and CDR will carry out a comprehensive organization development program for RT \nand WASA commencing within 6 months after loan effectiveness. \n(xiii)  The PG will ensure that adequate budgetary allocations of required counterpart funds are \nmade and released in a timely manner to CDR. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n82.  The following are conditions for the effectiveness of the loan: \n(i)  The Planning Commission Proforma-I (PC-I) of the Project will have been approved by \nthe duly competent authority of the Government, and \n(ii)  The PMU will have been provided with core staff to the satisfaction of ADB.  \n \nC.  Condition for Disbursement \n83.  No withdrawals will be made from the loan account for the execution of the outfall sewer and \nSTP until all land and right-of-way required for these subcomponents are acquired and involuntary \nresettlement is carried out in accordance with the updated resettlement plan agreed upon between \nthe Government and ADB, the Government\u2019s land acquisition and resettlement laws and regulations, \nand ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, 1995.  \n \nVI.

\n(i) Piped water supply services and  Rawalpindi Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) will be staffed with \nadequate sanitation for all people in  competent trained management and employees committed on a long-\nRawalpindi maintained in a sustainable  term basis to providing services to the public. WASA management will \nmanner through sound financial and human  be given autonomy to manage and operate the water supply and \nresources management.  sanitation services without outside interference. WASA shall publish \n  for the public an annual report on its operations and development each \nyear.  A  structured  and  systematic  program  of  organization \ndevelopment will be implemented for WASA. \n(ii) Long-term planning and development of  \u2022  The  long-term  goal  is  that  tariffs  will  cover  the  operation  and \nwater resources for water supply purposes  maintenance (O&M) costs plus capital costs plus debt servicing for all \nwater supply, and the O&M costs of all sewerage. WASA will meet \nO&M costs for water supply and sanitation through enhancement of \ncollection efficiency and increase in tariffs as per already agreed tariff \nplan, which require not to impose the tariff beyond the affordability of \nthe consumers and increase it gradually with increase in the level of \nservice. WASA will become a self-sustainable organization. Collection \nefficiency of tariffs must exceed 80% by March 2006 and non-revenue \nwater should decrease from the existing estimated 40% to less than \n15% by September 2006. Disconnections for nonpayment, presently \nenforced, will be further strengthened. WASA has computerized its \nrevenue and accounting system and computerized bills are being \nissued to the consumers. Privatization of billing and collection will be \nintroduced to improve the revenues and the billing will be conducted \non a monthly basis. All complaint offices will be functional and WASA \nwill maintain a management information system (MIS) to record and \nmonitor the status of registered complaints. \n\u2022  Operation  of  delivering  and  selling  water  through  the  tankers \n(bouzers), currently facing financial loss shall be privatized by June \n2006. Standposts shall be provided at identified locations and the \nO&M of these posts shall be handed over to the union administrations \n(UAs). \n\u2022  Rawalpindi  Development  Authority  (RDA)  on  15  March  2004 \nreduced  the  water  connection  fee  from  PRs1,500  to  PRs500  for \ndomestic consumers and from PRs3,500 to PRs1,500 for commercial \nconsumers, effective 20 March 2004. This step helped to expand the \nconsumer network and reduce the illegal connections. \n(iii) Conservation of water  \u2022  All water supply services will be metered and payment for water \n  use will be made on the basis of the volume consumed. No flat rate \ntariffs  will  be  allowed.  The  tariff  structure  will  reflect  government \npolicies on water conservation and lifeline rates for the urban poor. \nThese reforms will be fully implemented by end of 2007. \n\u2022 Installation  of  water  meters  is  in  progress  and  out  of  19,000 \ndomestic  and  commercial  meters  procured  under  phase-I  project, \n10,000 water meters have already been installed. WASA has started \nbilling  on  meter  reading  for  metered  supply.  However,  all  the \nconnections  will  be  completed  on  procurement  and  installation  of \nanother 50,000 meters under the proposed project.  \n\u2022 Non-revenue water, which includes both physical and commercial \nlosses, shall be measured and reduced progressively each year.  \n\u2022 WASA is making all efforts to minimize non-revenue water and this \nwill be reduced to less than 15% by September 2006. \n(iv) Equitable access to and use of water  \u2022 Service levels shall, wherever possible, be a household connection. \n  If this is not possible, it shall be no less than a standpipe within \n100 meters of any dwelling. Increase in service connections will be \nclosely monitored and reported to the public each year. \n\u2022 Every school in Rawalpindi shall be provided adequate piped water \nsupplies  and  toilets  (latrines).  Public  toilets  maintained  by  user \ncharges shall be constructed in all high density public locations.  ", " 26  Appendix 2 \n(v) Awareness of the public and  \u2022 A comprehensive water audit will be undertaken in 2005 to verify \ngovernment about the facts of water supply  coverage, examine the way all people get water, how much they get, \nservices in Rawalpindi.  and how much they pay; and to explore the use of non-revenue water. \n  After  analysis,  the  findings  of  this  audit  will  be  discussed  at  a \nstakeholder consultation and this will be the basis for formulation of \nnew government policy. This will be conducted under the proposed \nProject. \n\u2022 Community  awareness  and  community  development  will  be \npromoted through WASA. It is already holding regular meetings with \nUA\u2019s heads (nazims) and naib nazims. However, in the future, NGOs \nwill be involved to promote community awareness. Print and electronic \nmedia are also being used for this purpose.  \n(vi) Sustainable use of groundwater  All  groundwater  use  other  than  that  for  one  household  shall  be \n  registered as to owner, type of installation, location, volume extracted, \nand use of water. \n(vii) Optimum utilization of sewerage  \u2022 The sewerage connection fee will be reduced from the existing \nnetwork  PRs500 to PRs250 as an incentive to encourage consumers.  \n\u2022 Prior to laying any new sewer in any UA, the communities will sign a \nmemorandum  of  understanding  with  the  project  management  unit \n(PMU), where a 50% connection fee will be collected by the UAs in \nadvance and PMU will commence the work in those UAs where at \nleast 80% of people have deposited the connection fee to their UAs. \n\u2022 Payment of recurrent sewerage charges will be added to the water \nsupply bill.

Urbanization and Urban Infrastructure \n1.  Rapid urbanization in Pakistan has overtaxed the abilities of government institutions to \nprovide  adequate  infrastructure  and  urban  services.  Much  of  the  urban  growth  has  been \nuncontrolled and unplanned, because of the absence of effective planning and enforcement \ntools, and insufficient development of human resources. Most towns and cities lack plans for \ncontrolled urban development, and for linkage between the development of new housing and \ncommercial or industrial areas. Most urban areas have not developed the infrastructure and \nurban services needed to support such urban growth and expansion. \n \n2.  Urban areas suffer from various deficiencies in infrastructure. Town centers generally \nhave most required elements of physical infrastructure (including roads, markets, bus stands, \nand water supply systems) without community involvement, sewerage systems, and solid waste \ncollection systems. Some systems (especially roads, markets, and bus stands) suffer capacity \nproblems because urban populations and commercial activities in the town centers have grown \nto a level beyond their original design. As a result, commercial activities spill over into the \nstreets, which are already overburdened by a vehicle traffic volume far higher than their design \ncapacity. \n \n3.  Systems for water supply, sewerage, and solid waste collection suffer greatly from poor \noperations and maintenance (O&M). The  Government  of Punjab (PG) often  designed and \nconstructed water supply systems and turned them over for O&M to the local government, \nwhich has to handle gaps between system design and real consumer demand. The gaps are \noften considerable and have led to poor utilization of systems, resulting in poor cost recovery \nand the need for permanent subsidies from local government budgets. The collection and \ndisposal of municipal solid waste is mostly poor, without the participation of local communities, \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), or the private sector. Uncollected waste causes adverse \nenvironmental effects, such as bad odors and breeding of flies. Poor collection and removal of \nsolid waste also leads to the clogging of sewer lines, which is a major problem of urban \ninfrastructure systems. Blocked sewer lines make household sewage collection ineffective and \ncause ponding of sewage in lanes and streets. This leads to damage to private and public \nproperty, disruption of traffic, breeding of mosquitoes and other pests, and infiltration of sewage \ninto shallow groundwater. This leads to serious health problems because most households use \nshallow groundwater, through hand or motor pumps, as their main water source. Some basic \nservices are totally missing in peripheral and under-serviced areas of most towns, where people \nuse shallow, brackish water or take water from public standposts, where available. Sewerage \nsystems are nonexistent and sewage often flows uncontrolled into depressions where it ponds. \nThere is often no organized collection of municipal solid waste. \n \nB.  Urban Sector Institutions \n4.  The Punjab Local Government Ordinance 2001 (PLGO 2001) transferred responsibility \nfor delivery of municipal urban services and environmental improvement mainly to the tehsil \n(subdistrict)  municipal administration  (TMAs)  or  district  towns  in  large  cities  (where  district \ngovernments have been renamed City District Governments). Some responsibility rests with (i) \nthe lowest level of local government, union administrations, which are charged with community \ndevelopment and related tasks; and (ii) district governments, which handle affairs related to \ngovernment land as well as the health and education sectors.  ", "  Appendix 3  29\n \n5.  Implementation of the PLGO 2001 has considerably reduced the previously dominating \nroles of provincial agencies, especially the Housing, Urban Development, and Public Health \nEngineering Department (HUD&PHED), whose staff has been transferred to local government \nagencies.  \n \n6.  For major Punjab cities, including Rawalpindi, special development authorities (DAs) \nwere set up through the Development of Cities Act, 1976. These authorities, which previously \nworked under HUD&PHED, are now fully devolved to the City Districts (CD) to undertake urban \ndevelopment functions. A director general heads DA and the head of CD, the nazim, is the \nchairperson. In this capacity, the nazim provides general oversight of the effective delivery of \nDA functions, including water supply and sanitation, which is undertaken through DA\u2019s water \nand sanitation agency (WASA).    \n \n7.  TMAs/towns and CDs are supervised by the provincial Local Development and Rural \nDevelopment Departments (LGs), which support and monitor progress in the implementation of \nPLGO  2001,  including  all  required  adjustments  and  improvements  in  institutional  and \norganizational setups, as well as financial management. This department is now the provincial \nagency best suited to steer TMAs in delivery of basic urban services. \n \n8.  Within the LG, the Directorate General of Katchi Abadi and Urban Improvement has \nspecific responsibility for resolving problems related to katchi abadis (unauthorized settlements \nor slums on state-owned lands, with little or no infrastructure).  \n \nC.  Government Policies and Plans \n9.  Pakistan\u2019s national urban and housing policy is reflected in the 10-Year Perspective \nDevelopment Plan 2001\u20132011, which describes the main urban problems as: (i) environmental \ndegradation, mushrooming of katchi abadis, and breakdown of infrastructure and municipal \nservices; (ii) lack of vision, inadequate institutional setup, and weak financial bases, (iii) backlog \nof 2 million housing units, in addition to 2.3 million units that are structurally obsolete; and \n(iv) absence of a housing finance institution to provide affordable loans for house construction. \n \n10.  The plan envisages the following strategies for urban development: (i) strengthening the \nrole  of  local  organizations  in  planning,  determining  needs,  preparing  action  plans,  and \naugmenting  capacities  for  water  supply  and  sanitation  services;  (ii)  developing  satellite, \nintermediate or  secondary,  and  industrial  towns  as  employment  centers;  (iii) preparing or \nupdating master plans; (iv) implementing the national policy on katchi abadis; and (v) upgrading \nkatchi abadis and slums through integrated packages for area improvement. \n \n11.  For water supply and sanitation, the plan envisages providing (i) water supply services to \nan additional 55 million people (28 million rural and 27 million urban), thus increasing national \nservice coverage from 63% to 84%; and (ii) sanitation facilities for an additional 54 million \npeople (26 million rural and 28 million urban), thus increasing national sanitation coverage from \n39% to 63%. Private sector participation in water supply for major cities will be encouraged, and \nthe institutional capacity of water supply and sanitation agencies will be upgraded.  \n \n12.  Pakistan\u2019s National Housing Policy, 2001, acknowledges the need for development of \nhousing for the poor and needy. It envisages a strategy that combines community participation, \ninstitutional strengthening, and the development of a commercially oriented system of housing \nfinance. It also emphasizes addressing the problem of katchi abadis, squatter settlements, and \nslums through regulation where appropriate, relocation where required, and urban improvement. ", "30   Appendix 3 \n \n13.  The Government is committed to increasing annual pro-poor budgetary expenditures by \nthe current 0.2% of gross domestic product (GDP) to 4.0% of GDP in FY2004. The Pakistan \nPoverty  Alleviation  Fund\u2014established  in  1997  to  finance  community  income-generating \nprojects,  microenterprises,  and  infrastructure  projects,  mainly  through  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) and the private sector\u2014has begun lending activities. In April 2000, the \nGovernment  launched  the  National  Poverty  Alleviation  Programme,  with  the  objectives  of \nstimulating employment and providing basic infrastructure and services to rural and low-income \nurban  areas.  A  new  program  was  initiated  to  rehabilitate  the  poor  by  giving  one-time \nrehabilitation  grants  ranging  from  PRs5,000  to  PRs50,000  from  the  Zakat  Fund.  The \nGovernment  increased  funding  for  a  small  public  works  program,  the  Khushal  Pakistan \nProgram,  which  aims  to  provide  gainful  employment  for  the  poor  and  develop  essential \ninfrastructure such as farm-to-market roads, water supply schemes, and school repair in rural \nand low-income urban areas. The Government also set up the Khushali Bank, Pakistan\u2019s first \nmicrofinance bank, with financial support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB)1 in August \n2001.  The  Government  has  initiated  a  mechanism  for  the  quarterly  tracking  of  antipoverty \nexpenditures on the Finance Division\u2019s website. Most intermediate human development indicators \nare now reported annually.  \n \n14.  In line with goals of the National Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS), the Punjab \nPRS also emphasizes, among key factors to reduce poverty in Punjab, restoration of good \ngovernance, enhancement of public expenditures, improvement in service delivery for social \nsectors, and addressing environmental concerns. \n \nD.  Relevant ADB Strategies \n15.  ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008) for Pakistan focuses on \nsupporting poverty reduction by assisting in the strategic areas of good governance, sustainable \npro-poor economic growth, and inclusive social development. This strategy continues to be \nrelevant, and in line with priorities of the new government. ADB lending to devolved sectors will \naim to strengthen devolution by ensuring that future ADB projects are designed to be consistent \nwith the new governance structure under local government ordinances of August 2001. Where \nappropriate, efforts will be made to realign recently approved ADB projects for devolved sectors. \nADB will continue to emphasize the delivery of social services to support (i) increased public \nsector  allocations  made  possible  by  enhanced  fiscal  space,  and  (ii)  improved  governance \nthrough devolution and better sector administration and financial management. ADB\u2019s water \npolicy also supports its poverty reduction strategy by addressing each of the three elements of \nits framework for poverty reduction (pro-poor sustainable growth, social development, and good \ngovernance). The main focus of ADB assistance to the urban sector will be on environmental \naspects and the needs of the poor. Assistance will cover, broadly, institutional restructuring and \ndevolution of service delivery, private sector involvement in the delivery of selected services, \nbudgeting and finance, increased cost recovery and municipal revenue, increased community \nparticipation,  and  attainment  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).  To  facilitate \nachievement of the vision, goals, and targets set through the MDGs, the Project will develop \nlinkages with strategies being developed by fora like the Global Water Partnership, World Water \nCouncil, and Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1999.

", "38   Appendix 10 \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n \nA.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n1.  Following the Rawalpindi Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Project, the Rawalpindi \nEnvironmental  Improvement  Project  (the  Project),  representing  the  second  phase  of \ndevelopment, will improve the living conditions of about 1.4 million residents of Rawalpindi city, \nby enhancing the quality of life and health, improving the environment, and creating conditions \nconducive to sustained urban development and economic growth. Its main components are:  \n(i) environmental sanitation, which includes sewerage, sewage treatment, storm water drainage, \nsolid  waste  management,  slaughterhouse  replacement,  and  public  toilets;  (ii)  water  supply \nimprovement,  which  includes  replacement  of  tubewells,  rehabilitation  and  construction  of \ndistribution systems, water meter installation, and urban infrastructure facilities for schools; and \n(iii)  institutional  development,  including  development  of  municipal  management,  an  urban \nenvironmental development plan, asset management, and urban planning. \n2.  The Project is designed to minimize land acquisition and resettlement impacts. A total of \n284 hectares (ha) of land is required for the sewage treatment plant (STP), solid waste transfer \nstations, landfill site, and service corridors (right-of-way) for laying trunk sewers and maintaining \nstorm drains. The proposed STP site was chosen because it has less resettlement impacts than \nthe most technically feasible location. Some 197 landowners own 442 plots of land, which will \nbe acquired for the proposed 250 ha STP site. The acquisition will also affect the livelihood of \nan estimated 36 tenants/agricultural workers. The proposed solid waste transfer station and \nlandfill site (32 ha) will be constructed in unencumbered government land. There are two brick \nstructures  occupied  by  transient  brick  workers  in  the  proposed  landfill  site.  To  the  extent \npossible, the sewerage network and storm drain components prioritize rehabilitation of existing \ninfrastructure, which avoids resettlement impacts. The acquisition of 2 ha is required for a \n7 meter (m) service corridor for the sewerage system and an 8\u201310 m service corridors for the \nstorm drains. The sewerage network will partially affect 370 houses and about 28 houses will be \npartially affected by the storm drain subcomponent.  \n3.  The Project is not expected to cause large-scale relocation of affected people. There are \nno residential structures at the STP site, so no relocation is involved. Of the households affected \nby the sewerage network and storm drain works, impacts for many will be temporary and most \nwill retain a substantial portion of their landholding, so they will not require relocation.1 The \noverall resettlement impacts will be further minimized through careful component siting and \nalignment during detailed design.  \n4.  A  resettlement  plan  (RP)  has  been  prepared  for  the  Project  (Supplementary \nAppendix D). A summary of resettlement impacts and key socioeconomic information is in \nTable A10.1. \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Entitlements \n \n5.  The policy framework and entitlements for the Project are based on national laws and \npolicies: (i) Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (amended up to 2003); (ii) National Resettlement Policy, \n2002;  (iii)  Project  Implementation  and  Resettlement  of  Affected  Persons  Ordinance,  2001; \n(iii) Punjab Development of Cities Ordinance, 1981; (iv) Pakistan Environmental Protection Act, \n1997; as well as ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, 1995. The entitlement matrix for the \nProject, based on the above policies, is in Table A10.2. \n                                                   \n1  For the storm drain component, it is estimated that more than 70% will not require relocation.

RPs were prepared in consultation with all project stakeholders. Focus group discussions \nand meetings were held involving affected households, elected local representatives, councilors \nof concerned union administrations (UAs), and residents living close to the proposed component \nsites.  A  socioeconomic  survey  was  conducted  to  determine  the  potential  impacts  of  land \nacquisition. Information has been disseminated to affected persons (APs). A local language \nversion of the summary RP, including the entitlement matrix, has been made available in UAs \nand posted on the Executing Agency\u2019s (EA\u2019s) website.2 The RP will be posted on the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  website,  and  information  dissemination  and  consultation  will \ncontinue throughout project implementation. \n \n7.

Grievances  not \nredressed by the Musalehat Anjuman or Jirga will be brought by the AP to the grievance redress \ncommittee (GRC) through the assigned project management unit (PMU) social development \nspecialist. GRCs will have representation from APs (including vulnerable households), EA, PMU \nsocial development specialist (SDS), nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and community-\nbased organizations (CBOs). GRCs will meet every two weeks, determine the merit of each \ngrievance, and resolve grievances within a month of receiving the complaint. If the grievance is \nnot resolved within this timeframe, APs will refer it to appropriate courts of law. \n \n \n \n                                                   \n2  http://www.rda.gov.pk ", " \n4\nTable A10.2: Entitlement Matrix  0\n \n \n \n  Type of  Application  Entitled  Compensation Policy  Implementation Issues  Responsible Agency    \n \nA\nLoss  Person  p\n1  Loss of  Homestead  Owner(s) with  1.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis  \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national   Yes  Is the sector identified as a national priority   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      in country poverty partnership agreement?     \n    No    No \nContribution of the subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan \nPakistan faces twin challenges of reviving economic growth and reducing poverty. The incidence of poverty in \nPakistan has risen slowly but steadily from 20.0% to 32.1% over the past 15 years. At present, only 63% of the \ncountry\u2019s population has access to safe drinking water (83% in urban areas and 53% in rural areas). Proper \nsanitation facilities are available to only 39% of the total population (59% in urban areas and 27% in rural \nareas).  Poor  access  to  water  supply  and  sanitation  is  often  associated  with  poor  health  conditions. \nConsolidated (federal and provincial) expenditures on water supply and sanitation have actually decreased over \nthe last 5 years, both in nominal terms and as percent of gross domestic product (GDP). As a result, extension \nin public water supply and sanitation facilities have failed to keep pace with the growing needs of the rising \npopulation. \n \nThe Government of Pakistan considers poverty alleviation to be a high priority. In 1999, it launched stabilization \nand a broad-based structural adjustment program to address severe macroeconomic imbalance, leading to \nincreased  incomes,  thereby  reducing  poverty.  The  proposed  strategy  focuses  on  poverty  alleviation.  In \nparticular,  it  includes  upgrading  family  welfare and  improvement  in  drinking  water supply  and sanitation \nconditions to increase sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation in rural and urban areas. \nThe Government is encouraging local communities and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to actively \nparticipate  in  planning,  designing,  implementing,  operating,  and  maintaining  water  supply  and  sanitation \nschemes. The function has already been devolved to the tehsil (subdistrict) municipal administration (TMA) \nlevel under the Punjab Local Government Ordinance, 2001.  \n \nThe Poverty Partnership Agreement between the Government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) reflects \nGovernment\u2019s vision for poverty reduction and key priorities of ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program Update \n2006-2008. ADB\u2019s country strategy for Pakistan emphasizes water supply, sanitation and urban development, \nand the need to target the poor to reduce both poverty and inequality. The Government has agreed that long-\nterm poverty reduction requires sharper focus on good governance, considerable allocation for social sectors, \nand improving basic social services to enhance human development. The Poverty Partnership Agreement also \nfocuses on attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). ADB aims to assist the Government in \nmaking devolution a success and improving service delivery and municipal services, with particular focus on \nservices for the poor.   \n \nThe Project will provide water to poor communities through piped distribution systems or standposts. The \nenvironmental sanitation component will provide for expanded sewerage pipe networks to low-income areas. \nThe system will be designed to give the urban poor adequate access to improved sanitation. The expected \nbenefits are improvement in public health situation and reduction of pollution of groundwater. Improved solid \nwaste management and recycling, preferably with the involvement of community-based organizations, NGOs, \nand union councils (UCs) will also generate employment for the urban poor (especially women) who work as \nsanitary workers. Downstream of the Soan River, recycling of treated effluent for irrigation will help improve \nagriculture production and enhance poor farmers\u2019 income. \n \nThe availability of safe drinking water and improved sewerage system will improve quality of life and the \nenvironment in urban areas. Improved public health will increase the productive capacity of the people, many of \nwhom are poor. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis        Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nUntil recently, Punjab\u2019s economy had been based largely on agriculture. However, as growth prospects for \nagriculture are limited\u2014largely due to the restricted availability of water suitable for irrigation\u2014the province is \ndeveloping toward a more urban economy and faces high-income inequalities and entrenched poverty with the ", "  Appendix 11  47\nformation of slums and squatter settlements, and urban environmental degradation. The main factors that have \ncontributed to the rapid rise in overall urban populations are migration from rural to urban areas and extension \nof municipal boundaries.  \n \nUrban poverty in Rawalpindi is multifaceted, ranging from underemployment to limited or inadequate poor \nquality water supply, lack of sanitation facilities (with no sewerage system), limited solid waste disposal, and \nrundown housing. A socioeconomic survey in five selected localities of Rawalpindi indicates that about 35% of \nhouseholds, with an average family size of 6.5 persons, have a monthly income less than PRs6,000 ($100) per \nmonth, which indicates per capita income far below the poverty line of $1.00 a day. The percentage of poor \nhouseholds among sample households is almost 50% in two localities (Dhok Ratta Amral and Dhok Illahi \nBaksh), where a significant number of households are engaged in casual labor.  \n \nThe survey also indicates that about 53% of households sampled receive piped water supply for 2\u20134 hours, and \nabout 35% for even less than 2 hours. In Dhok Ratta and Pirwadhai, water supply pipes are leaking and \ncommunity taps are located far from households. In the sample area, about 55% of water carriers are women, \nwhile the rest are young boys or men. About 49% of households make two trips per day to bring water, while \n28% make more than two trips. The supply of water is intermittent and the amount of water available is lower \nthan requirements. In addition, water quality for drinking water in all the surveyed localities is below World \nHealth  Organization  (WHO)  standards,  mainly  due  to  bacteriological  contamination  as  a  result  of  poor \nsanitation facilities, or the location of tubewells close to main sewage and storm water channels.  \n \nThe coverage of sewerage system and storm water drainage system in Rawalpindi is limited. About 64% of \nsample households do not have sewerage facilities and domestic wastewater is carried in open drains to \nnearby storm water channels. These drains are often clogged with plastic bags and solid waste and streets are \noften flooded with sewerage water. In Rawalpindi, only 36% of sampled households have access to adequate \nsewerage systems.  \n \nIn almost all the surveyed localities, with the exception of Satellite Town, there is no solid waste collection or \ndisposal system. Due to the absence of an institutionalized disposal system, entire solid waste is thrown in \ndrains and/or open lots, attracting flies and rodents. Households suffer from various degrees of environmental \npollution, through disposal of wastewater in open drains and flooding from drains in residential neighborhoods. \nThere is no wastewater treatment plant in Rawalpindi and raw sewage is disposed in storm water channels that \nultimately fall into Soan River, adversely affecting the population downstream and their source of livelihood\u2014\nagriculture and fisheries. \n \nThe shortage of good quality water and inadequate sewerage systems has an adverse effect on public health \nand the urban environment. The survey in selected project areas on the occurrence of cases of diarrhea, \nhepatitis, and typhoid suggests that almost 40% of all reported diseases and 30% of all deaths in Rawalpindi \nare attributed to Ecoli\u2014bacteriological and contamination of drinking water. The incidence of these illnesses is \nmuch higher for poor people. Consistent press reports about the incidence of cholera, typhoid, hepatitis, and \ndysentery cases support these figures. \n \nCommunity Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation Report on the ADB-assisted Punjab Rural Water Supply and \nSanitation Project shows that provision of safe water and adequate sanitation have considerably reduced \nwater-borne diseases from 20% to 3% and expenditure on medicines is reported to have fallen from PRs339 \nper household to PRs180. In addition, the number of children attending school has increased due to increased \nwater services to households. It is expected that the public health situation will improve under the proposed \nProject, which would contribute to reduction of water-borne diseases. Household medical expenses could be \nminimized and the savings would improve family welfare. A direct positive contribution of the Project towards \npoverty reduction will be through employment generation in civil works. The Project will also ensure that poor \nhouseholds in low-income areas have access to basic urban services and resources under the Project. \nThe Project will address peoples\u2019 needs through: (i) provision of piped water supply; (ii) provision of sewerage \nsystems; (iii) improved access to service providers through sub-offices or complaint offices; (iv) better sanitation \nthrough  provision  of  public  toilets;  and  (v)  good  quality  food  through  better  agricultural  production  in \ndownstream areas and improved quality of meat from the centralized modern slaughterhouse. \n \n ", "48  Appendix 11 \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nFor the planning of the proposed components and subcomponents of the Project, a participatory approach was \nadopted through consultation with the relevant stakeholders. The NGOs, community-based organizations \n(CBOs), private and public sector representatives, and citizens attended three consultative workshops held \nduring project preparation. During project implementation, lessons learned from other successful locally-funded \nprojects (Orangi Pilot Project, Khuda Ki Basti Hyderabad) regarding community mobilization and participation of \nlocal communities in developing urban infrastructure and provision of urban basic services, will be used to plan \nand implement community-level services.  \n \nTo strengthen community participation in implementing project activities, the Project will adopt the following \nmeasures: (i) specific zone (ward)-level committees composed of representatives from union administrations \n(UAs) and CBOs will be formed to manage solid waste collection, (ii) NGOs/CBOs will be selected to conduct \ntraining for planning of sanitation and other activities in their areas, (iii) public service committees will be formed \nto monitor the privately operated toilets constructed under the Project, and (iv) finance management committee \nwill monitor outcomes and the impact of budget and policy decisions. Community-level committees will be \nformed to conduct an awareness campaign for solid waste management in their wards and neighborhoods.  \nD.  Gender and Development \nStrategies to maximize impacts on women: \nOver the last three decades, some headway has been made in improving women\u2019s situation in Pakistan. \nHowever, Pakistan ranked 127 out of 162 countries in the 1999 gender-related development index and 100 out \nof 102 countries in the gender empowerment measurement. Women, especially poor women, are generally \nvulnerable to gender equality. Specifically, poor women suffer low social status and limited access to economic \noptions and social services. In recent years, there has been a significant attempt in promotion and use of \ngender-sensitive approaches in water and sanitation programs at the international level. Given that women are \nmainly responsible for the collection of water, family health maintenance, and taking care of sick household \nmembers, the lack of adequate water supply facilities and sewerage systems is a great burden on them. \nRecognizing  this  situation  in  the  project  areas,  women\u2019s  active  participation  is  encouraged  in  planning \ncommunity-level water sanitation and sewerage services, local level governance, and project implementation.  \n \nGender Plan. The Project proposes to enhance the participation of women from the community and women \ncouncilors in municipal activities. The Project will facilitate strengthening the role of women councilors in Rawal \nTown (RT) and UAs to work with the project management unit (PMU) and plan water and sanitation services at \nthe ward level. The design features of the Project include the following activities. \n \nCommunity Level. Women groups will be formed at the ward/neighborhood level by participant NGOs/CBOs \nfor social mobilization activities: (i) women councilors from wards/communities will be involved with the PMU in \nplanning infrastructure for water and sanitation services, (ii) women from poor households will be encouraged to \nintroduce recycling and composting, (iii) local sanitation groups will be formed with women from the community, \n(iv) employment opportunities will be created in civil works for interested poor women; (v) women\u2019s groups will \nbe represented in managing new facilities, (vi) women will be the primary beneficiaries of the public health and \nhygiene campaign, (vii) women community volunteers will be developed for the health and hygiene campaign, \n(viii)  employment  will  be  created  for  poor  women  (at  least  20%)  in  the  community-based  solid  waste \nmanagement program. \n \nLocal Governance. To ensure local governance at RT and UA, following steps will be taken: (i) capacity \nbuilding training will be provided to the elected women representatives of RT and UAs on their role and \nresponsibilities (if they have not yet received training) and planning community water and sanitation facilities; \n(ii) a gender sensitization training workshop will be provided for men and women councilors from UAs for better \ncollaboration in preparing the plan of activities for their ward, UA, and RT; (iii) community women leaders and \nwomen councilors in their ward/community-level planning committee will be involved in ward level planning; (iv) \nwomen  councilors  will  be  included  in  various  users  groups,  such  as  lane-level  sewerage  management \ncommittees, solid waste management groups, and public health awareness groups.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 11  49\nIn the PMU, women officials will be recruited as professional staff. A national consultant on gender and \ndevelopment will be included in consulting services to develop a detailed gender action plan to operationalize \nthe gender plan. The detailed gender action plan will include budget, implementation schedule, and resource \nrequirement.  Gender  disaggregated  monitoring  indicators  and  a  database  will  be  developed  (i)  for  the \nmanagement information system (MIS) and; (ii) at the UA and RT level (a) to monitor men and women \nbeneficiaries of the Project and, (b) participation of men and women councilors of local bodies in planning and \nimplementation of the Project.   \n \nHas an output been prepared?

FIRRs were calculated for water supply, solid waste management, and sewerage and \ndrainage  subcomponents.  These  were  compared  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital \n(WACC) of 5%.2 The financial viability of the proposed subcomponents were assessed from the \nperspective of operating entities (WASA and RT), rather than the economy as a whole.  \n \n4.  All subcomponents revenues and costs are in constant 2004 prices and on an incremental \nbasis.  Investment  costs  are  derived  from  estimated  costs  less  interest  during  construction. \nRevenue estimates are based on current consumer user charges and their willingness to pay for \nimproved services, based on socioeconomic surveys and community consultations undertaken \nduring  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA).  Survey  results  indicated  a  low \nwillingness to pay, relative to affordability levels, which reflects beneficiaries\u2019 perception of RT\u2019s \nand WASA\u2019s lack of capability for effective service delivery. It has been assumed that user charges \nwill  not  be  increased  during  the  construction  period.  After  completion  of  project  works,  user \ncharges will increase by 10% after every 5th year with the exception of the water tariff, which has \nbeen proposed to increase by 2% per year so that clean water availability will remain within the \naffordable level for the large poor segment of society.  \n \n5.  FIRRs have been calculated conservatively, assuming that the collection efficiency of user \nfees is only 80%, project implementation takes 8 years instead of the planned 5 years, and, in the \ncase of WASA, non-revenue water remains at 50%. Standard sensitivity tests were undertaken to \nassess the robustness of the FIRR calculation. \n                                                 \n1  On 24 June 2005, the Governor of Punjab declared eight tehsils (subdistrict) of district Rawalpindi as a city district to \nbe named as City District Rawalpindi (CDR). Rawal Town (RT) is one of the towns of CDR, which covers Rawalpindi \ncity. According to the Punjab Local Governance Ordinance (PLGO), 2001, CDR has overall responsibility for urban \nmunicipal services, including WASA and RT. WASA is responsible for water supply and sanitation, and RT is in charge \nof solid waster management. For financial analysis purposes, WASA and RT have been analyzed independently, and \nRT terminology has been used for the former tehsil municipal administration (TMA).   \n2  The WACC is 5%, based on funding arrangements and respective weights. ", "  Appendix 12  51\n1.  Solid Waste Management  \n6.  Estimates  of  capital  costs  for  the  solid  waste  management  component  are  based  on \nplanned investments for equipment, transport vehicles, land for landfills, and civil works. Capital \ncost, operations and maintenance (O&M), and replacement costs are based on 2004 prices. Other \nassumptions are: (i) salaries of incremental staff were included;3 (ii) incremental O&M expenses \nare 5% of the component cost (excluding land), while diesel and O&M of vehicles are assumed to \nbe 15% of the vehicle cost; (iii) additional vehicles will be procured during the second and fifth \nyears of the implementation period; (iv) vehicles will be replaced every 10 years; and (v) the \nresidual value of vehicles, based on remaining life at the end of the implementation period, will be \ntreated as cash inflow.  \n \n7.  Average  monthly  user  charges  per  household  (based  on  actual  survey  results  for \nwillingness to pay) were estimated at PRs25 (low-income groups), PRs35 (middle-income), and \nPRs50 (high-income). The rates are within the affordability and willingness to pay of households, \nwhich is about PRs25 to PRs50 per household monthly. Population projections are based on the \n1998 census. Household size is seven persons.  \n \n8.  Financial projections using cost and revenue assumptions indicate that operation of the \nsolid waste management subcomponent is financially viable. Specifically, cash flows generated by \nthe Project are sufficient to meet all operating cost requirements. Full cost recovery is achieved \nand resulting FIRRs are higher than the WACC (5% rate of return). The FIRR of the solid waste \nmanagement subcomponent has been calculated as 7.33%  \n \n2.  Water Supply \n9.  The  water  supply  subcomponent  comprises  water  source  development  (tubewells  and \npumps), water transportation and communal water points, transmission mains and distribution \nsystems, and storage. Currently, WASA is charging flat tariff rates for residential and commercial \nconsumers. The existing tariff for house connections ranges between PRs55 per month for a  \n5-Marla (21 square meters) plot to PRs500 per month for a 2-Kenal (840 square meters) plot. \nWhile commercial connections are charged at PRs100 per month for social welfare institutions, up \nto PRs5,000 per month is being charged for gas stations.  \n \n10.  It has been assumed, as planned under the Project, that all water supply services will be \nmetered and payment for water use will be made on the basis of the volume consumed. No flat \nrate tariffs will be allowed. The tariff structure will reflect government policies on water conservation \nand lifeline rates for the urban poor. Therefore, the water tariff has been calculated to ensure the \nsustainability of the proposed Project and affordability for low-income groups. An affordable water \ntariff rate has been estimated based on a demand management study, whereby the average tariff \nmust be equal to the average incremental financial cost (AIFC), which has been calculated at \nPRs8.34 per cubic meter (m3). Tariff rates for low-, middle-, and high-income groups have been \ncalculated for cross subsidization.4 These tariff rates have been applied to estimate incremental \nrevenue generated. \n \n11.  The government of Punjab (PG) has decided that the water connection fee will be reduced \nfrom  PRs1,500  to  PRs500  for  domestic  consumers  and  from  PRs3,500  to  PRs1,500  for \ncommercial consumers in order to expand the consumer network and reduce illegal connections. \n                                                 \n3  Staff include those working on collection and disposal of solid wastes, such as those working with tractors with bucket \nloaders at landfills, or with tractors for container carriers and transfer trailers. Staff include drivers and sanitary workers \nat sites such as landfills, transfer stations, and container carriers. \n4  Low-income  group:  PRs4.38<AIFC=8.34;  middle-income  group:  PRs6.87<AIFC=8.34;  high-income  group:  \nPRs13.75>AIFC=8.34. ", "52   Appendix 12 \nThe water supply tariff is assumed to increase by 2% per annum. O&M costs include expenditures \nfor  salaries,  power,  chemicals,  spare  parts,  and  miscellaneous  expenses.  Only  incremental \nrevenues and O&M expenditures were included in calculating the FIRR.  Since  WASA  recently \ncompleted a consumer survey and updated the consumer database, several thousands of illegal \nconnections  have  been  legalized.  Furthermore,  concrete  measures  (such  as  organization \ndevelopment) have to be taken to enhance revenue collection efficiency and comply with the \nagreed tariff plan. Based on these developments and assumptions, the FIRR for the water supply \nproject was calculated at 6.21%, which is greater than the WACC. \n \n3.  Sewerage Component \n12.  Average  monthly  user  charges  per  household  (based  on  actual  survey  results  for \nwillingness to pay) have been estimated at PRs35 (low-income groups), PRs100 (middle-income), \nand PRs200 (high\u2013income). These have been increased by 10% after every fifth year in order to \ncover O&M of sewerage. The rates are within households\u2019 affordability and willingness to pay. The \nFIRR has been estimated at 2.72% based on the conservative assumption that only 60% of \ntargeted connections would be made, considering lessons learned in earlier projects in Pakistan \nsuch as Second Urban Development Project in the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP).   \n \n4.  Sensitivity Analysis \n13.  All  subcomponents  are  considered  financially  viable,  based  on  cost  and  revenue \nassumptions. Computed net revenues and the FIRR for the base case compare favorably with the \nWACC, with the exception of the sewerage project. The FIRR base case ranges from 2.72% for \nsewerage and storm water drainage to 7.33% for the solid waste management subcomponent. The \nFIRR for the water supply subcomponent was 6.21%. Table A12 shows the sensitivity scenarios \nand FIRR under various scenarios. \n \nTable A12: Financial Feasibility (FIRRs) \n(%) \n \nAssumption  Water Supply   Solid Waste   Sewerage/Drainage \nBase Cost  6.21  7.33  2.72 \nSensitivity Analysis       \nRevenue Decreased by 10%  4.00  5.76  1.76 \nCost Overrun by 10%  4.2  5.91  1.85 \nRevenue decrease + cost overrun  1.6  4.26  0.88 \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \nC.  Financial Position of Rawal Town  \n14.  In addition to the financial analysis of subcomponents, RT\u2019s financial sustainability was \nassessed.  RT  budgets,  actual  revenues,  expenditure  accounts,  and  taxation  schedules  were \nreviewed. \n \n1.  Revenues \n15.  Revenues include both current and capital revenues under various revenues headings. \nTaxes include the urban immovable property tax (UIPT), tax on transfer of immovable properties, \nand tax on television and/or cable. Property and enterprise includes rent from municipal properties, \nand  activities  such  as  transport  stands,  slaughterhouses,  and  cattle  markets.  The  octroi \n(abandoned  local  import  taxes)  compensatory  grant,  which  forms  a  major  part  of  municipal \nrevenues, has been shown separately. \n ", "  Appendix 12  53\n2.  Rawal Town Current Revenues  \n16.  The major revenue of the newly devolved RT is from building fees, which contributes about \n13.28% of total revenue, followed by rent of land/property in the city area (about 4.65%), and cattle \nmandi and the general bus stand (5.32%). The share of current grants in lieu of octroi tax is \n33.57%  of  total  income  generated  and  UIPT  was  21.25%.  At  present,  RT  is  dependent  on \nsubsidies and grants from PG to meet its expenditure. Different items regarding source of income \nand expenditure are analyzed to identify problem areas responsible for the organization\u2019s weak \nfinancial position. Under the devolution plan, City District Rawalpindi (CDR), through WASA and \nRT, will play a vital role in providing urban services in Tehsil Rawalpindi. The financial profile of RT \nand WASA has been formulated to ensure their sustainability, enabling them to provide urban \nservices without facing financial constraints.  \n \n17.  A review of income and expenditure accounts, as in the RT\u2019s Annual Budget 2003\u201304, \nindicates that income generated from RT operations comprises building fees of PRs50.0 Million \n(13.28%), tax on transfer of immovable property of PRs23.5 million (6.24%), rent of land/property \nof city area PRs17.50 million (4.65%), and cattle mandi and general bus stand fee at PRs20.0 \nmillion (5.32%). It has been observed that the low level of RT income may be attributed to the \nfollowing factors: \n(i)  Taxes, rates, and fees for various categories have not been revised since 1998. \n(ii)  Untrained and inefficient staff has negatively affected revenue collection efficiency. \n(iii)  According to the socioeconomic survey, about 90% of people are not satisfied with \nRT operations so they are reluctant to pay user charges \n(iv)  Further recovery from rented shops and property is quite low and most shopkeepers \nhave not paid rent since the inception of RT. \n \n18.  A  review  of  the  RT\u2019s  development  budget  shows  that  out  of  the  total  budget  of \nPRs177.52 million, about PRs81.60 million (46.02%) has been allocated for payment regarding \ndevelopment works arrears. A sizeable amount, PRs60.00 million (33.80%), has been allocated for \nthe salary and expenditure of education, health, and library staff, although PLGO 2001 states that \nthis is the responsibility of the district government. The salary of RT staff is PRs260.00 million \n(72.23%) of non-development budget allocations. \n \n3.  Improvement of Rawal Town Financial performance \n19.  PG has agreed to comply with the following recommendation. \n(i)  In order to enhance RT\u2019s income, a comprehensive survey must be undertaken to \ncollect census data regarding rented shops and property. \n(ii)  All taxes, rents, and fees must be adjusted based on the escalation of energy and \ngasoline charges, which are subject to frequent increases. \n(iii)  Capacity building of institutional and financial management staff is required to \nenhance the working efficiency of RT. \n(iv)  Arrears in development works may be deferred until RT become sustainable. \n(v)  Expenditure of education, health, and library staff may be excluded from the RT \nbudget and transferred to CDR, in accordance with PLGO 2001. \n \n20.  The projected income statement and fund flow statement for RT have been prepared. The \nmain assumptions for construction of the income statement and fund flow statement are stated \nbelow. \n \n21.  Urban Immovable Property Tax. Information has been obtained from the: (i) PG excise \nand taxation staff at CDR, and (ii) Provincial Finance Department. The higher figure for 2003\u201304 ", "54   Appendix 12 \nhas been taken as the base for the UIPT. This has been increased by considering increases in the \nnumber of properties in future. A departmental survey by the Excise and Taxation Department is \nconducted every 5 years, which results in a major increase in the assessment/collection of UIPT. In \nline with the usual results of these surveys, UIPT projections have been increased by 25% every \nfifth year, although some cities have increased from 50% to 100%. \n \n22.  Tax on Transfer of Immovable Properties. The actual revenue collection contract has \nbeen taken as the base for tax on transfer of immovable properties (TOTP), which has been \nincreased by 25% per year. The rates for levy of stamp fees and registration fees is fixed/revised \nby district revenue authorities every 3 years, which results in an increase in TOTP. Projections of \nTOTP have been increased by 25% in the fifth year to give the effect of this increase in property \nvalue, although the actual increase is usually much higher. \n \n23.  User Charges. Budgeted user charges of 2003\u20132004 have been considered as the base \nline. User charges have been increased at 10% per year until 2015, after which they have been \nincreased by 3% per year.  \n \n24.  Inter Government Transfers. Following considerations have been made regarding the \ninter government transfer: (i) The entire amount of grant for salary and non-salary expenditure of \nstaff of the decentralized departments has been considered to be utilized for RT operations and not \nfor the RT area; (ii) development grants received by RT have been allocated on a per capita basis \nto the population of the RT area, the actual development grant received by RT for 2003\u201304 has \nbeen taken as the base, and this has been increased by 10% per year; (iii) the actual amount \nreceived by RT as octroi compensatory grant during FY2004 has been considered as the baseline \nand has been increased by 10% per annum\u2014this compensates a revenue source of the defunct \nRawalpindi Municipal Corporation (RMC), so it has been shown separately in these projections. \n \n25.  In  the  \u201cwith  project  cash  flow  projections\u201d,  incremental  salaries  and  O&M  expenditure \n(including  repairs  and  utilities)  for  the  proposed  interventions  have  been  included  in  the \nexpenditures. The cash flows show that RT will have sufficient cash to meet all its expenditures as \nwell as a surplus. Actual results would be better because of the institutional development and \ncapacity building component of the Project. A number of recommendations with action plans have \nbeen made for revenue enhancement, expenditure control, transparency, and good governance: \n(i) including display of unit costs to improve transparency, (ii) improvement in budgeting, records, \nand (iii) monitoring of O&M expenditures to reduce costs and wastage. \n \nD.  Financial Position of WASA \n26.  Following the creation of WASA in 1992, assets relating to water and sewerage of the \ndefunct RMC were transferred to WASA, its staff was trained, a management information system \n(MIS) was established and made functional, and other major actions were taken satisfactorily. It \nhas been observed that actual income generated through WASA\u2019s sources was in excess of \nestimated income for FY2001 and FY2002 due to WASA\u2019s increased efforts in initiating quarterly \nbilling and establishing a well-organized bill distribution system. In addition, in order to improve \narrears recovery, an enforcement section was created in WASA with the assistance of the senior \nspecial magistrate and police contingent. However, during 2003-2005, most WASA performance \nindicators have worsened, including financial management, resulting in reduced efficiency in all \nareas. This is mainly due to: (i) frequent changes in upper management, (ii) high turnover of \ntrained staff, (iii) appointment of inexperienced and less qualified staff in designated disciplines, \nand (iv) above all, lack of follow-up by the PG for sustained WASA operations.  \n \n27.  During the phase 1 project, the collection efficiency of water and sanitation bills increased \nfrom 51% in FY1999 to 61% in FY2001 but decreased to 44% in FY2004. Arrears of PRs28.4 ", "  Appendix 12  55\nmillion in FY1999 increased to PRs77.4 million in FY2003. WASA has recently launched a serious \ncampaign to collect and reduce these arrears. Recovery staff has been increased, inefficient staff \nremoved, and complaint cells are now fully functional. Agreement has been reached that WASA\u2019s \ncollection efficiency will be improved to 80% by March 2006 and non-revenue water will decrease \nfrom the current estimated 40% to less than 15% by September 2006. To achieve these targets, \nactions related to recruitment of qualified staff, establishment of three additional complaint cells, \nand a more aggressive disconnection policy will be implemented. It has been agreed that WASA \nwill outsource collection of water bills during FY2007. \n \nE.  Policy Guidelines for Sustainability of WASA \n28.  Based on WASA budget analysis and interviews conducted with relevant authorities, the \nfollowing  policy  has  been  approved  by  the  PG  for  the  improvement  of  WASA\u2019s  financial \nperformance. WASA will be staffed with competent trained management and employees committed \non a long-term basis to public service provision. WASA management will be given autonomy to \nmanage without outside interference. WASA shall publish for the public an annual report on its \noperations and development each year. A structured and systematic program of organization \ndevelopment will be implemented for WASA. \n \n1.  Water Supply and Sanitation Policy \n29.  The long-term goal is that tariffs will cover O&M costs, capital costs, and debt servicing for \nall water supply and the O&M costs of all sewerage. WASA will meet O&M costs for water supply \nand sanitation through enhancement of collection efficiency and increase in tariffs by the end of \n2006.  \n \n30.  Tariffs will not be imposed beyond the affordability of consumers and they will be gradually \nincreased  with  increase  in  the  level  of  service.  WASA  will  try  to  become  a  self-sustainable \norganization. WASA is making all efforts to improve collection efficiency and revenue collection has \nincreased substantially in 9 months, from January to September 2005. \n \n31.  Collection  efficiency  of tariffs  must  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of  3  months  of  billings. \nDisconnections for nonpayment will be enforced. Privatization and user-friendly computerization of \nbilling and collection will be introduced. Billing and collection will be conducted on a monthly basis. \nWASA has already computerized its revenue and accounting system and computerized bills are \nbeing issued to consumers. However, monthly billing requires more resources. \n \n32.  All water supply services will be metered and payment for water use will be made on the \nbasis of volume consumed. No flat rate tariffs will be allowed. The tariff structure will reflect \ngovernment policy on water conservation and lifeline rates for the urban poor. These reforms will \nbe fully implemented by the end of 2006. \n \n33.  Installation of water meters is in progress out of 19,000 domestic and commercial meters \nprocured under the phase I project and 10,000 water meters have already been installed. WASA \nhas recently started billing based on meter reading for metered supply. However, all connections \nwill be completed upon procurement and installation of another 50,000 meters under the Project. ", "56   Appendix 13 \n \n  ECONOMIC ANALYSIS \nA.  Introduction \n1.  The proposed Rawalpindi Environmental Improvement Project is aimed at increasing urban \nservices such as water supply, sewerage, drainage, and solid waste disposal in the project area. \nEconomic analysis has been developed to provide a framework to evaluate all aspects of project \nactivity in a coordinated and systematic way. The purpose of the economic analysis is to foster \nbetter allocation of scarce resources. Analysis has been undertaken separately for each of the \nfollowing five project components: water supply, sewerage facilities, sewage treatment plant, storm \nwater drainage, and solid waste management. Standard methodology has been used. Under the \nProject, all water supply services will be metered and payment for water use will be made on the \nbasis of the volume consumed\u2014a major innovation in managing urban water supplies in Pakistan. \nThis will involve a significant change in tariffs, which could significantly reduce water use. During \nproject  implementation,  an  international  consultant  with  expertise  in  public  economics  will  be \nappointed to reassess the tariff policy, recommend improvements based on that assessment, and \nupdate demand forecasts based on projected tariffs. The updated demand forecasts may identify \npotential  cost  savings,  increasing  the  actual  net  benefits  of  the  Project  relative  to  estimates \nreported in this appendix. \n \nB.  Economic Benefits \n2.  Current  and  future  water  demand  for  domestic  and  nondomestic  consumers  of  the \nRawalpindi Water and Sanitation Authority (WASA) areas has been assessed on the basis of \n28 gallons (gal) per capita per day; demand for adjacent rural localities is estimated at 31 gal. \nFuture water supply and sewerage connections for domestic and nondomestic categories have \nbeen estimated based on the population of the above areas. \n \n3.  Savings in health expenditure due to improvement of public health and reduction in the \nincidence of water- and sewerage-borne diseases has been assessed for the Project. \n \n4.  The total billing of receipts against urban services has been computed on the basis of the \nprojected number of connections under \u201cwith Project\u201d and \u201cwithout Project\u201d conditions. Collection \nefficiency was used to establish a summary of total water receipts under \u201cwith Project\u201d and \u201cwithout \nProject\u201d conditions. The difference is taken as a measure of the incremental project benefits. \n \n5.  The sewage treatment plant will produce 199,000 m3/day of treated wastewater (2015) per \nyear, which needs to be adjusted for an estimated 15% conveyance loss in bringing it to the fields. \nA value of PRs4,850 per 123 m3 of water has been used to calculate the economic benefits of the \nsewage treatment plant. The benefits foregone to the economy due to the construction of the \nsewage treatment plant have been added to the operation and maintenance (O&M) cost for the \neconomic analysis. \n \n6.  The improvement of drainage, solid waste management facilities, and other urban services \nwould result in enhanced property value in the city area. The incremental share of the property tax \nfor WASA and tehsil municipal administration (TMA) has been computed on the basis of property \ntax assessment for various categories in the area. Sanitation tax received by TMA has also been \ntabulated. \n \nC.  Economic Cost \n7.  The  analysis  uses  the  domestic  price  numeraire,  excludes  taxes  and  other  market \ndistortions, includes standard conversion factor, and is undertaken in constant May 2005 prices, \nand benefits are non-tradable in nature. The capital costs for all components are estimated at \nPRs4,587 million. The total investment cost in economic terms is PRs4,209 million. ", "  Appendix 13  57\nD.  Results of Economic Evaluation \n \n8.  To judge the economic viability of the Project, economic indicators such as net present \nvalue (NPV), benefit cost ratio, and economic internal rate of return (EIRR) have been calculated. \nThe economic analysis will guide the Executing Agency on implementation of similar projects in the \nfuture. The results assume a 12% discount rate as indicated in Table A13.1. The results of the \nurban services projects are economically viable as the EIRRs for the subprojects fall within an \nacceptable range for social sector projects. \n \nTable A13.1: Results of Economic Analysis \nSewage \nEconomic  Water  Overall \nSewerage  Treatment  Drainage  SWM \nIndicators  Supply  Project \nPlant \nNet Present Value  498.9  50.5  329.6  63.1  194.7  1142.4 \n(PRs million) \nBenefit/Cost Ratio  1.99:1  1.03:1  1.3:1  1.45:1  1.8:1  1.3:1 \nEIRR (Base Case)  21.6%  12.4%  15.8%  16.8%  21.1%  15.8% \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, SWM = solid waste management. \nSource: ADB. 2003.

A review of the results above indicates that all projects are not sensitive to the assumptions \nmade. Nevertheless, implementation decisions regarding public utility projects, such as provision of \nsolid waste management, cannot be based purely on EIRR results. ", "58  Appendix 14 \nSUMMARY ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT \n \n1.  An environmental impact assessment (EIA) was prepared for the proposed Rawalpindi \nEnvironmental Improvement Project (the Project). This summary focuses on the Project\u2019s key \nenvironmental impacts and mitigation measures, and environmental management plans.  \n \nA.  Key Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n2.  Water Quality. The groundwater table in Rawalpindi has sharply depleted over the past \n20 years. Provision and rehabilitation of new tubewells will consider the overall impact that \nfurther water extraction would have on the local water table and existing tubewells. Detailed \nengineering design will undertake modeling and provide calculations to establish an optimal \nextraction  rate.  Selected  aquifers  should  be  suitable  for  water  consumption  and  contain \nsufficient resources. Water testing will be undertaken in all cases by the Public Engineering \nHealth Department. At the proposed sewage treatment plant (STP) site, lining and sealing of the \nbase and sides of the ponds with high-quality, impermeable material will be ensured during the \ndetailed design. Protection embankments will be provided to prevent flooding of the STP and \nsewage overflow from the stabilization ponds. Effluent from the proposed STP is designed to \nmeet national standards. The Project includes a comprehensive water quality monitoring plan, \nand onsite laboratory facilities.1 Construction and operation of a larger slaughterhouse will \ngenerate  additional  biological  waste,  which,  if  improperly  managed,  could  contaminate \nwatercourses and spread communicable diseases. Collection, treatment, and disposal systems \nfor different types of slaughterhouse wastes are an integral part of the design.2  \n \n3.  Air Quality. Unmanaged air pollution from construction may create nuisance and, in \nextreme cases, adverse health impacts and property damage. Mitigation measures will include \n(i) operating construction vehicles within agreed time periods, (ii) covering wagons and skips, \n(iii)  enclosing  demolition  sites,  (iv)  spraying  dusty  roads,  (v)  maintaining  moisture  on \nconstruction materials, (vi) covering transportation and garbage vehicles, (vii) controlling vehicle \nspeed,  (viii)  selecting  transportation  routes  to  minimize  impact  on  sensitive  receptors,  (ix) \ncovering exposed soil or storage areas, (x) limiting excavation and land leveling works to rainy \nseason, and (xi) minimizing the onsite storage time of construction material. All vehicles and \nconstruction  machinery  will  be  operated  in  compliance  with  prescribed  vehicle  emission \nstandards and engines will be properly maintained to reduce air pollution from exhausts and oil \nspills.  \n \n4.  The proposed landfill is expected to produce certain amounts of toxic gases3 that could \ncreate  nuisance  and  health  hazards  for  nearby  communities  if  they  are  not  appropriately \ncontrolled. Mitigation measures proposed include provision of proper soil cover, buffer zone, \nplantation and an adequate gas control system. Methane monitoring will be essential, especially \nconsidering the close proximity of brick kilns. Odor from open stabilizations ponds will disturb \n                                                 \n1  The STP is designed to treat municipal sewage from the city. Its operational efficiency and life could be seriously \naffected by the ingress of any industrial/hazardous waste. Although Pakistan\u2019s environmental legislation prohibits \nsuch practices, implementation and monitoring are weak. Municipal authorities have committed to address this \nissue by preventing the issuance of sewage discharge permits, exerting tight control, and issuing heavy fines to \nviolators. \n2  Environmental monitoring and compliance mechanisms will be built into the structure of the slaughterhouse \nmanagement and a waste management plan developed during detailed design will be endorsed and implemented \nprior to slaughterhouse operation. \n3  Primarily methane and carbon dioxide; and small quantities of hydrogen sulfide, carbon monoxide, and ammonia \nas a result of solid waste decomposition.  ", "  Appendix 14   59\nneighboring areas when the STP is operating. Odor control measures will be based on an \nimpact assessment during detailed design. Proper operation and maintenance of the plant\u2014and \nmitigation measures such as tree planting and development of a greenbelt as a buffer zone\u2014\nwill be required to minimize odor. \n \n5.  Geology and Soils. Project design will ensure against soil erosion and damage to water \nquality  resulting  from  construction  works  by  immediate  resurfacing  and  stabilizing  newly \nexposed surfaces and cuts. Wherever possible, surplus earth and spoil material from excavation \nwill be used to produce bricks, to mix with cement, or to build embankments for the STP site. \nSurplus material will be appropriately disposed of in designated areas. Engineering design and \nconstruction will include a detailed geological study that will carefully consider topography, \nfaults, and any other soil characteristics to ensure safe practices. The contractor will provide \nsatisfactory treatment and disposal of solid and liquid wastes at the work site and workers\u2019 \ncamps  to  prevent  soil  degradation,  pollution,  and  abuse  of  natural  resources.  Adequate \nmonitoring and mitigation of complaints from the community will also be undertaken.  \n \n6.  A drainage system for upper areas of the STP will be developed during detailed design. \nSludge will be sampled and tested to ensure compliance with agricultural standards and if toxic \nmaterials are found in the dry sludge, municipal authorities will consider safe underground \ndisposal and the significant cost increases associated with treatment. \n   \n7.  Change in Land Use. The proposed site for the STP is currently used to grow food \ncrops and vegetables. The proposed STP requires a large surface area and will significantly \nchange the present land use, degrade aesthetics of the area, and depress property value. \nThese impacts will be permanent, but intensity will be minimized with suitable landscaping, \nplanting, and vegetation.4  \n \n8.  Ecosystems. Mitigation measures are required to limit sediment concentration during \nconstruction which can affect aquatic habitat, minimize construction noise which can disturb \nwildlife  and  birds,  minimize  impacts  on  human  settlements,  and  minimize  effects  on \necosystems. The Project will significantly improve aquatic environments by treating sewage. \nTree  plantation  at  the proposed  landfill  and  STP  sites  will  be  undertaken  to  enhance  the \nappearance of the sites and provide a natural buffer. This will enhance soil retention and \nerosion control, providing an aesthetic and visual screen against sound, dust, toxic emissions, \nnight glare, and pollution of watercourses. Preference will be accorded to indigenous species to \nensure their adaptability to the natural ecosystem.  \n \nB.  Environmental Management Plans \n \n9.  Environmental management plans (EMP) have been formulated for the proposed STP \nand landfill site. They will serve as guidelines for municipal authorities, selected contractors, and \nother  parties  involved  in  mitigating  potential  environmental  impacts.  Regular  environmental \nmonitoring will be carried out and results will be used to evaluate the actual extent of the \nenvironmental impacts, performance of the environmental protection, prevention and mitigation \nmeasures,  compliance  with  rules  and  regulations,  and  overall  EMP  effectiveness.  A \ncomprehensive  EMP  will  be  prepared  for  every  component  during  detailed  design.  During \nreview missions, ADB will assess environmental compliance by the Project Management Unit \n(PMU), authorities, and communities. To ensure that contractors comply with the EMPs, the \nfollowing specifications should be incorporated in all construction bidding procedures: (i) a set of \n                                                 \n4  Land acquisition and resettlement impacts are discussed in Appendix 10. ", "60  Appendix 14 \nenvironmental prequalification conditions for potential bidders, (ii) a list of environmental items \nto be budgeted by the bidders in their proposal, (iii) environmental evaluation factors for bid \nreviewers, (iv) environmental clauses for contract conditions and specifications, (v) full EIA for \ncompliance, and (vi) ADB\u2019s environmental procurement guidelines.  \n \n10.  The executing agency for the Project will be the Rawalpindi Development Authority. The \nPMU will be responsible for overall coordination, planning, implementation, and management of \nall  project  activities.  Private  contractors  will  execute  subprojects  and  be  responsible  for \nimplementing  environmental  mitigation  measures.  The  PMU,  with  the  assistance  of  the \nenvironmental consultant, will supervise and monitor compliance.5 During the operation phase, \nthe  TMA  will  be  responsible  for  compliance  and  monitoring  of  environmental  mitigation \nmeasures for the proposed landfill site and slaughterhouse, while the Rawalpindi Water and \nSanitation  Agency  will  ensure  compliance  and  monitoring  of  mitigation  measures  for  the \nremaining subprojects. The Punjab Environmental Protection Department may check at any \npoint whether activities comply with national environmental legislation and monitor enforcement \nof recommendations for environmental mitigation measures as prescribed in the EIA.6  \n \nC.  Conclusions \n \n11.  The Project will result in substantial environmental benefits including improved ground \nand surface water quality, as well as improved solid waste and sewage collection and treatment. \nThis will significantly improve health and quality of life in Rawalpindi, as well as agriculture and \nfishing in the Soan River downstream. \n \n12.  Predicted adverse significant impacts have been identified. Some impacts are minor and \neasily  mitigated,  while  others  could  potentially  be  significant,  long  term,  and  irreversible  if \nmitigation measures and monitoring plans are not enforced. In this regard, draft EMPs and \nmonitoring  plans  have  been  developed  for  finalization  during  detailed  design  based  on \nrecommendations documented in the summary EIA (Supplementary Appendix F). ADB will \nreview the finalized EMPs. Since all project components are still at the preliminary design stage, \nthe EIA and EMP need to be updated based on the final engineering design. The revised EIA \nand EMP will be submitted to ADB for concurrence. \n                                                 \n5  As part of the consulting services provided to the PMU under this Project, an environmental engineer with good \nknowledge of water treatment, disposal, and solid waste management will be engaged on a full-time basis for the \nduration of the Project. In addition, environmental monitoring and occupational health and safety services training \nwill be provided as part of the training requirements provided in the EMPs. \n6  The government of Punjab is committed to providing at least one environmental engineer and one environmental \nscientist for the STP every shift of operation. The engineer will undertake environmental compliance and day-to-\nday running of the wastewater treatment plant and effluent, the scientist will conduct discharge analysis and \ngeneral environmental onsite monitoring.
