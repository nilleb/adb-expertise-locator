In  2015,  ADB  approved  the first  policy-based  loan  in  the  PRC  under \nthe  program,  which  focused  on  policy reforms and regulatory capacity strengthening  to  improve \nair  quality  in  Hebei  Province. 2 In  2016,  the  second  loan  was  approved  to  establish  a  green \nfinancing platform (GFP) for developing air pollution reduction projects in the region by enabling \nbetter access to finance.3 In 2017, the third loan was  approved to  support  the  adoption  of  high-\nlevel technologies by major polluting entities across key sectors in the region.4 In 2018, the fourth \nloan was approved to help Shandong Province adopt more efficient and advanced technologies \nfor  heat  production  and  refrigeration  by  replacing  coal  with  cleaner  energy  sources  such  as \nnatural gas, renewable energy, and waste heat recovery.5 In 2019, the fifth loan was approved to \naccelerate a switch from coal to natural gas and biogas for residential, commercial, and industrial \nuses to improve air quality in Henan Province.6  The proposed project will be the sixth loan under \nthe air quality improvement  program.7  \n  \n\n \n\n1  The region includes Beijing and Tianjin municipalities; the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region; and Hebei, Henan, \n\nLiaoning, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces. \n\n2  ADB. 2015.

Manila. \n\n7   ADB  is  also  supporting  small  and  medium  sized  local  banks  and  financial  institutions  in  Hebei,  Shandong  and \nShaanxi provinces, including Bank of Xingtai, Shandong Green Development Fund, and Shaanxi Financial Holding \nGroup, to build local capacity and promote green finance.  \n\n \n\n\fthat \n\nit \nthe \n\nis  highly \n\nfollowing  experiences: \n\nlending  program,  and  assessed \n\nADB  has  extended financial  assistance using various  lending  modalities  to  (i)  strengthen \n4. \npolicies  and  regulatory  frameworks,  (ii)  introduce  new  technologies,  and  (iii)  support  inclusive \nenergy  delivery  to  improve  air  quality.  During  2015\u20132017,  the  assistance focused  on  enhancing \npolicy  and  regulatory  frameworks,  and  developing  green  financing  platforms  to  raise  domestic \nfunding for sustainable air quality improvement in the region. During 2018\u20132019, the assistance \ntargeted  the  highly  polluted  provinces  in  the  region  to  support  technology  leapfrogging  and \ninclusive  service  delivery  of  clean  heating  and  fuel  supply.  The  combination  of  institutional \nbuilding and targeted approaches has been mutually reinforcing to effectively support air quality \nimprovement  in  a  geographically  dispersed  area.  The  policy-based  loan  approved  in  2015 \n(footnote  2)  was  rated  highly  successful.8 The  other  four  loans  are  under  implementation.  The \nfollowing  lessons  have  been  learned from  the  multiyear  lending  program:  (i) strong government \ncommitment  to  improve  air  quality  is  essential,  (ii)  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies \nrequire  strong  technical  and  management  capacities  for  effective  implementation,  and  (iii)  the \nproject  design  needs  to  be  flexible  to  accommodate  evolving  government  policies  and \nregulations. ADB\u2019s Energy Sector Group carried out a midterm program evaluation in 2018 for the \nmultiyear \nrelevant,  effective, \n(i)  close \nefficient, and sustainable; the  evaluation  highlighted \ncollaboration    across  ongoing  BTH  projects  and  programs  through  joint  workshops  to  share \nlessons  and  experiences,  and  (ii)  flexible  lending  modalities  and  project  designs    to  adapt  to \nevolving PRC policies.9 \n \n5. \nChange  in  air  pollution  sources.  Government  actions  to  accelerate  air  pollution \nreduction  and  ADB\u2019s  multiyear  lending  support  have  resulted  in  significant  air  quality \nimprovement in the greater BTH region. The annual average concentration of particulate matter \nless  than  2.5  micrometers  in  diameter  (PM2.5)  in  the  region  decreased  by  27%,  from  60.3 \nmicrograms  per  cubic  meter  (\u03bcg/m3)  in  2015  to  47.9  \u03bcg/m3 in  2019.  However,  this  remains  far \nabove  the  national  class  I  ambient  air  quality  standard  and  the  World  Health  Organization \nstandard  (35.0  \u03bcg/m3),  and  the  greater  BTH  region  faces  two  challenges  to  improve  air  quality \nfurther:  (i)  the  dominant  source  of  PM2.5  is  shifting  from  primary  emission  sources  (i.e.,  directly \nemitted  pollutants  from  coal  combustion,  vehicle  exhaust,  biomass  burning,  and  industrial \nproduction  processes)  to  secondary  pollutants  that  are  formed  in  the  atmosphere  through \nchemical reactions of precursor pollutants and transported over long distances, and are estimated \nto  contribute  44%  of  PM2.5  pollution  in  the  BTH  region10 and  (ii)  concentration  of  ground-level \nozone  (O3),  which  is  a  gas  formed  from  precursor  pollutants  and  a  major  source  of  smog, \nincreased by 18%, from 117.1 \u03bcg/m3 in 2015 to 142.2 \u03bcg/m3 in 2019.11 \n \n6. \nWide  area-based  approach  and  government  policy.  Addressing  an  increase  in \nsecondary  pollutants,  including  O3,  in  the  greater  BTH  region  requires  a  wider  area-based \nintervention.  The  Yangtze  River  Delta  (YRD)  region,  which  comprises  Anhui,  Jiangsu,  Zhejiang \nprovinces, and Shanghai Municipality, is the PRC\u2019s second largest economic zone, accounting for \n22%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  and  is  the  area  with  the  second  highest  air  pollution \n\n8  ADB. 2018.

High-time-resolution source apportionment of PM2.5 in Beijing with multiple models. Atmospheric \n\n11 Ground-level O3 is a major constituent of atmospheric smog and is a GHG. It is formed in the air by photochemical \nreaction  of  solar  irradiation  and  nitrogen  oxide,  facilitated  by  volatile  organic  compounds.  O3  exposure  impacts \nhuman health (lung function) and the growth of crops and trees. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fconcentrations in the PRC.12 Air pollutant emissions in the country are highly concentrated in the \nnortheast  corridor  between  Beijing  and  Shanghai,  and  air  quality  in  the  greater  BTH  and  YRD \nregions is interlinked through air pollutants transported across the two adjacent regions. In June \n2018, the Government of the PRC issued the Three-Year Action Plan for Winning the Blue Sky \nWar,  2018\u20132020,13 which  adds  the  YRD  region  as  a  priority  area  for  wider-area  based  policy \nintervention beyond the greater BTH region. It intends to control O3 as well as PM2.5 emissions by \naccelerating (i) closure of heavily polluting industries, (ii) reductions of surplus production capacity \nin industries, (iii) a shift to less air polluting transport modes, and (iv) construction of cleaner and \nless air polluting energy systems. The plan targets reducing emissions by 2020 (from 2015 levels) \nby more than 15% for nitrogen oxide and more than 10% for volatile organic compounds (both of \nwhich are precursors of O3), more than 15% for sulfur dioxide, and more than 18% for PM2.5. \n \nIncreasing  hydrofluorocarbon  emissions.  In  addition  to  air  pollution  targets,  the \n7. \ngovernment issued a nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement committing to \nreaching peak GHG emissions by 2030. GHG emissions growth in the country has been slowing \ndown,  with  annual  GHG  emissions  growth  during  2013\u20132018  reaching  a  plateau  of  0.4%. \nHowever,  emissions  of  hydrofluorocarbon  (HFC),  which  is  one  of  the  most  potent  GHGs,  have \ngrown by about 20% annually in 2010\u20132019. The PRC is the largest HFC producer in the world, \naccounting for 70% of global production.14 In addition, HFC emission is highly concentrated in the \nnortheast corridor between Beijing and Shanghai because of the presence of an industrial cluster \nproducing  HFC.  In the  business-as-usual  scenario,  HFC  emission  is  projected  to  grow  to  about \n428  million  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  equivalent  by  2030  from  182  million  tons  of  CO2 \nequivalent  in  2010.  In  2016,  the  PRC  adopted  the  Kigali  Amendment  to  the  Montreal  Protocol, \ncommitting to reach peak consumption and production of HFC by 2024, with an 80% reduction by \n2045.  In  2019,  the  government  started  implementing  the  Green  and  High-Efficiency  Cooling \nAction Plan to achieve its commitment to the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol.  \n \n8. \nChallenges in sustainable financing for air quality improvement. Public spending on \nair  quality  improvement  reached  CNY744  billion  in  2019,  whereas  an  estimated  annual \ninvestment  of  CNY1,538  billion  is  required  to  meet  the  national  class  I  air  quality  standard  by \n2030. The domestic green bond market is one of the fundraising channels to narrow this funding \ngap. After the first green bond guideline was issued by the People\u2019s Bank of China in December \n2015,  the  PRC\u2019s  green  bond  market  expanded  from  CNY238  billion  issued  in  2016  to  CNY386 \nbillion  in  2019,  making  the  PRC  the  world\u2019s  largest  source  of  green  bond  issuance.15 Despite \nbeing  the  world\u2019s  largest  market  by  size,  the  types  of  green  bonds,  in  the  view  of  issuers  and \ntenors,  are  not  well  diversified.  About  90%  of  green  bonds  in  2019  were  corporate  bonds.  The \ntenor of green bonds is relatively short: about 60% of bonds issued have a maturity of less than 5 \nyears. Developing a range of instruments and tenors is essential to further develop the domestic \ngreen  bond  market  to  meet  growing  green  financing  demand.  In  addition,  there  remain  gaps \nbetween  domestic  green  bond  regulations  and  international  standards  with  regard  to  green \nproject  and  asset  definitions,  tracking  and  management  of  proceeds,  and  external  reviews  and \nassurance;  about  50%  of  PRC  green  bonds  issued  in  2019  were  not  aligned  with  international \n\n \n\n12 In the YRD region in 2019, the annual concentration of PM2.5 was 41\u03bcg/m3 and that of O3 was 164 \u03bcg/m3.  \n13 Government of the PRC. 2018.

These are produced synthetically  and \nprimarily  used  as  a  refrigerant  for  cooling  and  refrigeration.  HFCs  were  developed  as  alternatives  to  O3-depleting \nsubstances to be phased out under the Montreal Protocol. However, HFCs are potent GHGs with thousands of times \nthe global warming potential of CO2. \n\n15 Climate  Bonds  Initiative  and  China  Central  Depository  &  Clearing  Research  Centre.  2020.

Although the gap in standards has been narrowing since 2015, further alignment with \ninternational standards is desirable to gain stronger credibility and transparency in the market. \n \n9. \nChallenges  in  financial  inclusiveness  for  air  quality  improvement.  MSMEs  in  the \nPRC  account  for  about  60%  of  GDP  and  80%  of  urban  employment.  Women  have  a  higher \nrepresentation in MSMEs as managers and employees.16 Despite their substantial contribution to \nthe  country\u2019s  economy,  MSMEs  still  face  limited  access  to  finance  and  high  financing  costs \nbecause of perceived credit risks and stringent collateral requirements by banks. MSMEs lending \naccounts  for  only  22%  of  total  bank  loans  outstanding,  and  the  risk  premium  of  MSMEs  is \nestimated to be 40% higher than that of large enterprises. Because of limited access to finance \nand delayed investment in pollution reduction, it is estimated that 70% of air and water pollution is \nattributed to MSMEs.17 \n \n10. \nIncreasing emissions post COVID-19. Air pollutant concentration and GHG emissions in \nthe  first  quarter  (Q1)  of  2020  dropped  by  about  30%  compared  with  Q1  2019  because  of  the \ncoronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  lockdowns  and  associated  energy  consumption  declines.  With \nthe lifting of the COVID-19 related restrictions in most part of the PRC in late March 2020, year-\non-year  emissions  bounced  back  and  overshot  2019  emissions  by  about  5%  during  April\u2013May \n2020  because  of  the  rapid  economic  rebound.18 Uninterrupted  clean  energy  investment  in  the \npost-pandemic  scenario,  in  parallel  with  economic  recovery,  is  essential  to  maintain  emissions \nreduction momentum. \n \n11. \nProposed  solution.  The  project  aims  to  comprehensively  address  emerging  challenges \nin air quality improvement and GHG emissions reduction in the greater BTH and YRD regions. It \nalso  aims  to  stimulate  post-COVID-19  recovery  investment  with  build-back-better  principles  by \ncontinuously  scaling  up  clean  energy  technologies  and  systems  applications  in  the  targeted \nregions,  which  together  account  for  about  53.4%  of  total  GDP,  53.0%  of  total  primary  energy \nconsumption,  and  45.9%  of  the  total  population  in  the  PRC.  Using  lessons  learned  from  the \nmultiyear lending program (para. 4), the project adopts a flexible lending modality with particular \nattention  on  mobilizing  domestic  funds  and  promoting  financial  inclusiveness  for  sustainable \nclean energy investment. It uses the financial intermediation loan modality, which is the best fit to \nsupport  geographically  scattered  investments  while  maximizing  ADB\u2019s  loan  leveraging  capacity \nthrough  revolving  the  loan  funds  and  mobilizing  domestic  funds.  The  project  expands  the  GFP \nthat  was  established  under  the  second  loan  (footnote  3)  for  sustainable  investments  in  air \npollutant and GHG emission reduction activities in the expanded regions.19 \n \nThe  GFP  is  directly  under  the  control  of  China  National  Investment  and  Guaranty \n12. \nCorporation (I&G), which is a state-owned financial institution specialized in credit enhancement \nto support investment for social and economic development. I&G has strengthened its corporate \ngovernance  since  2015  including  professional  management,  separation  of  management  and \noperations, mixed ownership, and private sector involvement in areas monopolized by the public \n\n \n\n16 Specific statistics are missing, as sex-disaggregated data are not collected on a regular basis. \n17 J.

The  outputs  are  as  follows:  (i)  GFP  and  leveraged  commercial  financing  for  pollution \nreduction projects established, (ii) barriers lowered and financing scaled up for small and medium-sized enterprises \nand  energy service  company from  the  GFP, and  (iii)  capacity  in  financial  products and  to  appraise  and  implement \nGFPs strengthened. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fsector. I&G has successfully promoted mixed ownership and private sector involvement, and 49% \nof the I&G stake is not owned by the PRC government, of which about 38% is owned by private \nfinancial institutions. The GFP is a first-of-its-kind mechanism dedicated to air pollution reduction \nin  the  greater  BTH  region,  and  it  offers  debt  financing,  credit  guarantees,  financial  leasing,  and \nequity  investments.  It  has  already  supported  13  subprojects  with  a  total  investment  of  \u20ac1,043 \nmillion of which ADB has financed \u20ac332 million.20 \n \n13. \nAlignment  with  Strategy  2030  and  country  partnership  strategy.  The  project  is \naligned  with  two  operational  priorities  of  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030:  the  project  will  support  (i) \noperational  priority  2  (accelerating  progress  in  achieving  gender  equality)  through  gender \nmainstreaming  activities;  and  (ii)  operational  priority  3 (tackling  climate  change,  building  climate \nand  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability)  by  accelerating  low  GHG \nemissions  development  and  ensuring  environmental  sustainability.  The  project  will  contribute  to \nSustainable  Development  Goal  5  (achieve  gender  equality),  Sustainable  Development  Goal  7 \n(ensure  access  to  affordable,  reliable,  sustainable,  and  modern  energy  for  all)  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal 13 (take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts). The project \nalso supports the PRC\u2019s nationally determined contribution targeting the following, to be achieved \nby around 2030: (i) peaking CO2 emission, (ii) lowering CO2 emission per unit GDP by 60%\u201365% \nfrom 2005, and (iii) increasing non-fossil fuel usage to 20% of total energy share. The project is \nalso  aligned  with  the  priorities  of  broadening  the  response  to  climate  change  and  strengthening \nenvironmental sustainability in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020.21 \n \nB. \n \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: air quality and public health in the greater \n14. \nBTH  and  YRD  regions  improved  (footnote  13). The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  air \npollutants and greenhouse gas emissions reduced.22 \n \nOutput  1:  Green  financing  platform  operations  expanded.  The  GFP  (para.  12)  will \n15. \nscale  up  its  operations  by  (i)  expanding  regional  coverage  to  the  YRD  region  to  accelerate  air \npollutant  and  GHG  emissions  reduction;  and  (ii)  focusing  on  cutting-edge  technologies  in \nrenewable energy, clean transport, industrial energy efficiency, and cooling system retrofits. Initial \nsubprojects  identified  include  fast  charging  stations  to  support  wider  uptake  of  electric  vehicles; \nhigh-quality  biogas  and  biomass  ethanol  production  plants  for  industrial,  commercial,  and \nresidential energy use;  high conversion efficiency and low degradation solar photovoltaic power \nplants;  heat,  ventilation,  and  air-conditioning  system  renovation  for  industrial  energy  efficiency; \nand a cooling system retrofit using water and ice, which will be the first ADB intervention in the \ncooling  sector  in  the  PRC  for  HFC  reduction.  As  part  of  scaling  up,  the  GFP  will  also  support \nstrengthening women\u2019s leadership in the clean energy sector through networking and training for \nfemale managers and employees of the subborrowers.  \n \n16. \nOutput  2:  Credit  enhancement  scheme  developed.  The  project  will  establish  a  credit \nenhancement scheme in the GFP to diversify green bond instruments with longer maturity. These \ngreen  bonds  will  provide  a  direct  funding  channel  for  domestic  project  sponsors  for  air  quality \n\nProject Description \n\n \n\n20 \u20ac332 million in disbursements under the ADB loan comprises \u20ac43 million for guarantee loss reserve, \u20ac93 million for \n\nfinancial lease, and \u20ac196 million for subloans to subborrowers. \n\n21  ADB.  2016.

The credit enhancement scheme will extend guarantee and investment instruments \nto  improve  the  creditworthiness  of  domestic  developers  to  issue  clean  air  bonds  (CABs).23 The \nscheme  also  supports  the  issuers  in  (i)  capacity  development  for  environmental  and  social \nmanagement  system  (ESMS)  compliance;  (ii)  arrangement  of  credible  independent  review  for \nassessing  the  bond  framework  and  use  of  proceeds  for  green  investments;  (iii)  bond  issuance \narrangements,  including  the  authority\u2019s  approval,  bond  structuring,  marketing,  and  pricing;  and \n(iv) credible tracking and monitoring arrangement for use of proceeds and emission reduction. On \nsuccessful  issuance  with  full  subscription  in  the  market,  the  CABs  will  be  the  first  air  quality \nimprovement-dedicated green bonds in the PRC. \n \n17. \nOutput  3:  Access  to  inclusive  finance  improved.  The  project  will  also  further \nstrengthen  the  GFP\u2019s  capacity  for  financial  inclusion  in  air  quality  improvement  and  GHG \nemissions  reduction.  To  improve  access  to  finance  by  MSMEs,  including  energy  service \ncorporations, and to meet the government\u2019s policy on strengthening financial services access for \nMSMEs,24 the  project  will  introduce  a  fintech-powered  online  lending  platform.  This  will  enable \nsimplified loan application, customer-specific risk-based loan pricing by using real-time big data to \nobtain  comprehensive  information  for  each  loan  application  for  precise  credit  risk  assessment, \nand  credit  risk  monitoring  and  management.  The  project  will  also  help  mainstream  gender  into \nproject  implementation  by  increasing  female  staffing  in  the  GFP  and  supporting  involvement  of \nwomen in clean energy investment. \n \n18. \nThe  project  will  help  catalyze  domestic  funds  for  sustainable  investment  in  air  quality \nimprovement and GHG emissions reduction. It will offer subloans, financial leasing, and a credit \nenhancement  scheme  (para.  16)  to  leverage  domestic  funds  totaling  the  equivalent  of  \u20ac424.02 \nmillion for the initial subprojects (Table 2). Repaid loan proceeds from the initial subprojects will \nreflow into the designated account to be further invested in subprojects in additional batches, with \nan estimated total investment of \u20ac1.1 billion. \n \nC. \n \n19. \nADB financing will add substantial value to expand and strengthen GFP capacity to fully \ncatalyze  domestic  funds  for  sustainable  investment  in  air  quality  improvement  and  GHG \nemissions  reduction  toward  2030,  while  addressing  the  emerging  challenge  of  increasing  O3 \nconcentrations and HFC emissions that impede control of air pollution and GHG emissions in the \nPRC, by (i) supporting cutting-edge energy technologies to stimulate transformational change in \nenergy use and supply; (ii) developing a credit enhancement scheme to support domestic clean \nenergy developers to mobilize finance from the domestic market through issuance of CABs that \nare  aligned  with  international  standards;  and  (iii)  promoting  financial  inclusion  through  fintech-\npowered  lending  platform  development  for  MSMEs,  and  gender  mainstreaming  in  clean  energy \ninvestments. The project is expected to deliver valuable lessons in scaling up investments for air \npollutants  and  GHG  emissions  reduction;  these  lessons  would  be  disseminated  through \nworkshops for other ADB developing member countries for replication in future projects. \n \n\nValue Added by ADB  \n\n \n\n23 The clean air bond is air quality improvement-dedicated bond that aligns with domestic green bond regulations and \n\ninternational standards.

These  subprojects  are  deemed  technically  feasible  and \nappropriate to achieve the intended energy savings and emissions reduction. \n \n26. \nFintech. I&G is deemed to have sufficient capacity and experience to design the fintech \napplication.  In  2015,  it  established  Zhejiang  Online  Financial  Asset  Trading  Center  Co.  Ltd., \nwhich adopted a fintech-based online financial platform, using myriad information from real-time \nbig  data,  to  facilitate  business-to-business  transactions.  Based  on  the  experience  gained,  the \nproject  will  expand  the  fintech  application  for  MSMEs  financing  in  clean  energy  to  develop  a \nflexible  but  robust  platform  for  credit  application,  appraisal,  and  monitoring.  The  fintech \napplication action plan, which comprises two stages (an interim and final assessment), for large \nscale adoption is detailed in Appendix 4 of the PAM (footnote 28). \n \nB. \n \nFinancial  analysis  of  the  project  indicates  an  average  financial  internal  rate  of  return  of \n27. \n11.09%,  with  a  range  of  6.35%\u201313.41%  for  the  seven  initial  subprojects,  all  higher  than  the \naverage weighted average cost of capital of 3.05% and corresponding weighted average cost of \ncapital  of  each  subproject.  Sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  all  subprojects  are  likely  to  be \nsustainable under various adverse scenarios. The economic internal rate of return of the project \nranges  from  12.69%  to  35.72%  for  the  seven  initial  subprojects,  all  above  the  9.00%  economic \nopportunity  cost  of  capital.  Sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  project  is  likely  to  be  sustainable \nwith economic rates of return above 9.00% under various adverse scenarios.29 \n \nC. \n \n28. \nSustainability  of  the  project  relies  upon  the  government\u2019s  policy  and  the  selection  of \nquality  investments.  Commitments  to  air  pollution  and  GHG  emissions  reduction  are  in  the \nThirteenth  Five-Year  Plan,  2016\u20132020 30 and  nationally  determined  contributions  of  the  PRC. \nAppendix 3 of the PAM (footnote 28) defines applicable subproject selection criteria in technical, \nfinancial,  and  economic  viabilities;  the  project  owner\u2019s  creditworthiness;  and  environmental  and \nsocial  safeguard  requirements,  these  criteria  guide  screening  and  appraisal  of  individual \ntransactions.  It  also  excludes  fossil  fuel  fired  power  and  heat  generation  capacity  addition, \nregardless  of  energy  saving  benefit.  The  project  will  also  support  domestic  green  bond  market \ndevelopment  by  the  credit  enhancement  scheme  (output  2)  to  diversify  and  grow  a  funding \nchannel  for  sustainable  clean  investment.  As  the  financial  intermediary,  I&G  has  demonstrated \nsatisfactory  ratings  on  the  criteria  of  capital,  asset  quality,  earnings,  liquidity,  and  sensitivity  to \nmarket  risk.  I&G\u2019s  liquidity  position  became  relatively  weaker  from  2015  to  2019  because  of \nincreased  leverage,  and  its  long-term  financial  sustainability  may  suffer  if  the  trend  continues. \nHowever, its overall liquidity position was still strong in 2019, with a cash and financial asset\u2013debt \nratio of 1.43. Projected financial statements of I&G from 2020\u20132035 consolidating the incremental \nimpact of the project illustrate that the financial sustainability of I&G will improve. \n \n \n \n \n\nSustainability \n\n29 Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n30 Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China. 2016.

The \nprocurement assessment was conducted on the initial potential subprojects. It showed that most \nof  the  subborrowers\u2019  procurement  practices  follow  established  domestic  commercial  practices, \nand procurement procedures are aligned with the PRC\u2019s procurement laws and are acceptable to \nADB. To provide guidance on this, a project-specific procurement manual has been prepared and \nincluded in Appendix 8 of the PAM (footnote 28). \n \nIntegrity  due  diligence  was  conducted. 31  No  significant  integrity  risks  were  identified.  \n31. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment  and  I&G.

Improved air quality will directly benefit about 614 million people, including \n10.4 million poor people in the greater BTH region and 3.8 million poor people in the YRD region \nwho receive the minimum living guarantee subsidy.32 Initial subprojects are estimated to generate \n1,570 job opportunities during construction and 1,048 job opportunities during operation. I&G will \npromote  compliance  with  the  relevant  labor  laws  and  occupational  health  standards  by  all \nsubborrowers.  Subprojects  resulting  in  labor  retrenchment  and  redundancies  because  of  the \nintroduction of new technologies will not be financed. \n \n33. \nGender.  The  project  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming  following  ADB\u2019s \nguidelines.33 A gender assessment was conducted indicating that despite progress, women in the \nrenewable  energy  sector  remain  underrepresented  and  face  barriers  such  as  (i)  gender \nstereotypes  that  influence  hiring  practices  and  individual  professional  choices,  (ii)  lack  of \nawareness  and  information  about  job  opportunities  in  the  sector,  and  (iii)  limited  access  to \nprofessional  networks.  In  addition,  the  lack  of  sex-disaggregated  data  in  the  renewable  energy \nsector  limits  the  capacity  to  formulate  targeted  gender  equality  policies,  including  for  financing \nfemale entrepreneurs. Initiatives to support women in the sector in the PRC include networks and \ncampaigns.34 This is the first time that I&G will be implementing gender equality actions, and its \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nTerrorism.

A  gender  action  plan35 has  been  prepared  that \nincludes  actions  and  targets  to  (i)  increase  transactions  that  support  female  entrepreneurs \nseeking  clean  energy  investment;  (ii)  support  participating  subprojects  to  tackle  gender \nstereotypes  of  women  in  renewable  energy  by  supporting  networking  opportunities  for  female \nleaders  of  MSMEs  and  energy  service  corporations,  and  training  events  for  female  employees \nand  managers;  (iii)  mainstream  gender  in  the  operation  of  the  GFP  by  increasing  female \ninvestment managers in the GFP; and (iv) support the collection of sex-disaggregated data from \nborrowers.  Gender  indicators  are  included  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework,  and  the \nbudget has been confirmed for the implementation of the gender action plan. \n \nF. \n \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n34. \ncategories are FI for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.36 An ESMS \nwas developed based on the experience and lessons learned from the Air Quality Improvement \nGFP  project  (footnote  3)  to  provide  guidance  on  (i)  screening,  categorization,  and  review  of \nsubprojects;  (ii)  capacity  building;  (iii)  grievance  redress;  and  (iv)  monitoring  and  reporting.  I&G \nwill use the ADB program management office with an ESMS unit of four regular staff to conduct \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguards  due  diligence  of  the  proposed  subprojects.  A  series  of \ncapacity building and trainings on ADB safeguard policy requirements was provided to I&G staff \nduring  the  implementation  of  the  GFP  project.  All  13  of  the  subprojects  approved  to  date, \nincluding  one  subproject  categorized  A  for  environment,  have  met  all  the  requirements  in  the \nESMS,  including  screening  and  categorization,  due  diligence,  compliance  monitoring  and \nreporting,  grievance  redress  mechanism,  information  disclosure,  public  consultation,  and \nenvironmental and social audit of existing and associated facilities. I&G has sufficient capacity to \nimplement the project from an environmental and social safeguards perspective. In addition, I&G \nhas signed long-term contracts with national consultants to support the ESMS implementation. \n \nThe ESMS provides for the inclusion of environment category A subprojects. If any such \n35. \nsubprojects are implemented, ADB will review and clear the environmental impact assessments, \nwhich  will  be  posted  on  ADB\u2019s  website  120  days  prior  to  approval  of  the  subprojects.  Each \nsubproject  will  undergo  due  diligence  following  national  regulations,  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement,  and  the  requirements  in  the  ESMS.  Climate  risk  assessments  for  the  proposed \nsubprojects will be conducted, and the findings will be incorporated in the subproject design. For \nsocial  safeguards,  any  subproject  that  triggers  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  or  adverse \nimpacts  on  ethnic  minorities  will  be  excluded  from  financing.  Subprojects  that  result  in  positive \nimpacts  on  ethnic  minorities  (such  as  subprojects  involving  enterprises  owned  and/or  managed \nby  ethnic  minorities  that  aim  to  improve  these  enterprises'  competitiveness  and  support  their \ncontributions to air quality outcomes) will be eligible for financing.37 I&G will be required to submit \nannual  ESMS  implementation  reports  and  consolidated  environmental  and  social  monitoring \nreports during project implementation. \n \n\n \ncommitment by organizations to work toward equal pay, equal leadership, and equal opportunities for women in the \nclean energy sector by 2030.
