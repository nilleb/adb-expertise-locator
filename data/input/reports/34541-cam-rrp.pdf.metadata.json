The Project will\nconcentrate  on  the  national  road  system,  irrigation  and  flood\ncontrol, rural infrastructure, and education and health facilities.\nClassification Primary: Economic\nSecondary: Poverty reduction\nEnvironment Category B\nAssessment\nRationale The unprecedented intensity  and  duration  of  the  2000  floods\nhave resulted in major disruption of people\u2019s lives and economic\nactivity, and have severely damaged physical infrastructure. The\ncost of rehabilitation is beyond the capacity of the Government.\nBy providing funds for  rehabilitation works, the Project will permit\nthe  Government  to  maintain  its  development  programs  at  a\nreasonable level.\nObjectives and Scope The main objective of the Project is to assist the Government to\nrehabilitate key infrastructure damaged by the 2000 floods, and\nto enable the early restoration of economic and social activity,\nespecially  for  the  rural  poor.  The  Project  provides  for\nrehabilitation of facilities in key sectors to pre-flood levels. The\nProject will rehabilitate flood-damaged facilities by providing civil\nworks;  equipment  and  materials;  and  consulting  services  for\ndesign work, evaluation and implementation, supervision, and\ncoordination.\nCost Estimates The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $83  million\nequivalent,  comprising  $47.0  million  (57  percent)  in  foreign\nexchange,  and  $36.0  million  equivalent  (43  percent)  in  local\ncurrency costs.\nFinancing Plan\nForeign Local Total Percent\nSource Exchange Currency Cost Financing\n($ million) ($ million) ($ million)\nADB loan 35.5 19.5 55.0 66.3\nLoan Reallocation 11.0 1.5 12.5 15.0\nWFP grant 0.5 1.5 2.0 2.4\nGovernment 0.0 13.5 13.5 16.3\n     Total   47.0   36.0   83.0  100.0\nADB=Asian Development Bank, WFP=World Food Programme.\nLoan Amount And The equivalent in various currencies of SDR 42,741,000 will be\nTerms from Asian Development Bank\u2019s (AD) Special Funds resources", "iii\nwith a term of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years. The\nannual interest charge will be 1.0 percent during the grace period\nand 1.5 percent thereafter.\nPeriod Of Utilization Until 30 June 2004\nExecuting Agency The Executing Agency is the Project Coordinating Committee,\nestablished especially by the Government for the Project. The\nImplementing Agencies are:\nPart A \u2013 Ministry of Public Works and Transport;\nPart B \u2013 Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology;\nPart C \u2013 Ministry of Rural Development;\nPart D \u2013 Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports; and\nPart E \u2013 Ministry of Health.\nImplementation Each Implementing Agency is responsible for implementing its\nArrangements part of the Project, which will consist of a series of subprojects.\nProject coordination will be provided by the project coordinating\ncommittee,  which  is  responsible  for  subproject  screening,\ncoordination,  and  resolution  of  interagency  problems.\nImplementation will follow procedures established under ongoing\nprojects as far as possible.\nProcurement Advance action and retroactive financing have been approved for\ncertain components, for eligible expenditures after the date of\nappraisal and subject to approval of the loan by ADB.\nGoods and services to be financed by ADB will be procured  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Equipment\nand materials will be procured under international competitive\nbidding if valued at more than $1 million equivalent or less. As\nthe  Project  sites  are  scattered  throughout  the  country,  and\ninvolve relatively small civil works contracts, the civil works are\nnot likely to attract the interest of international contractors. For\nparts B-E, domestic contractors have the capacity and capability\nto undertake the required contracts, following established local\ncompetitive  bidding  procedures.  In  the  interest  of  time,  only\ncontractors  that  have  already  been  prequalified  under  other\ncontracts will be invited to bid. All civil works contracts for the\nrehabilitation of roads and bridges (part A), with a value of $2.5\nmillion or more, will be awarded on the basis of international\ncompetitive bidding procedures. For suitable contract packages\nunder $2.5 million, local competitive bidding procedures will be\nfollowed. The force account procedure will be allowed particularly\nfor small, scattered civil works.\nConsulting Services The  Project  is  expected  to  use  340  person-months  of\ninternational and 830 person-months of domestic consultants,\nsome  of  which  will  be  contracted  under  existing  contract\narrangements.  Consultants  will  be  engaged  by  the  agency\nconcerned in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of", "iv\nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the\nengagement of domestic consultants.\nEstimated Project 31 December 2003\nCompletion Date\nProject Benefits And  The Project will benefit large numbers of people in flood-affected\nBeneficiaries areas  in  Cambodia,  and  especially  poor  people  in  the  rural\nareas.  Since  the  project  activities  will  restore  facilities,  the\neconomic benefits are expected to be high especially because\nmuch lower levels of economic activity would persist without the\nrestoration  work.  A  major  benefit  of  the  Project  will  be  the\nrestoration of essential transportation and social infrastructure\nfacilities. The restoration of transportation links via the national\nhighway system will enable economic activity to resume and will\nmake it easier to distribute relief supplies throughout the country.\nThe restoration of the dike protecting Phnom Penh will benefit all\nresidents, who would otherwise be at risk during the coming\nflooding season. Restoration of irrigation facilities will allow year-\nround  agriculture  production  to  resume  as  soon  as  possible.\nRehabilitation of education facilities will permit children to resume\nschooling  as  early  as  possible,  while  restoration  of  health\nfacilities will allow health services to resume. The rehabilitation of\nADB-assisted projects damaged by the floods will help to ensure\nthat the projected benefits, which could be lost due to the floods,\nwill still accrue.\nRehabilitation of infrastructure, as well as other Project activities,\nwill directly and indirectly benefit the poor. The majority of the\nproject  works  are  labor-intensive,  localized  civil  works  using\nunskilled or semiskilled labor, and will create local purchasing\npower, thereby helping to revive the rural economy. By building\non the existing capacity building components of ongoing ADB-\nassisted projects, the Project is expected to create long-term\ncapacity  for  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  of  infrastructure,\nespecially in rural areas.", "v", "I .  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Emergency Flood Rehabilitation Project, and on a\nproposal to use loan savings from ongoing projects in Cambodia for rehabilitation of flood\ndamage.\nII .  INTRODUCTION\n2. Since July 2000, record floods, in terms of water levels and duration, have inundated\nmore than 50 percent of Cambodia. The floods have caused severe human suffering, major\ndisruption of social and economic life activities, and serious damage to infrastructure. The\nGovernment requested urgent assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the\nrehabilitation of flood-damaged facilities. A reconnaissance mission was fielded 2-6 October,\nfollowed by the Appraisal Mission1 on 2-9 November 2000. The Mission\u2019s objectives were to (i)\nassess the extent of the flood damage and rehabilitation assistance required, (ii) prepare a\nproposal for loan assistance to meet rehabilitation requirements, (iii) liaise closely with the\nexternal funding community in Cambodia to ensure overlap and duplication are avoided, and (iv)\nprepare a grant financing proposal for direct support to the poor.\n3. The  Mission  undertook  field  visits,  met  with  the  National  Committee  for  Disaster\nManagement (NCDM) and senior Government officials, nongovernment organizations (NGOs)\nand financing agencies involved in relief and rehabilitation work. The Mission\u2019s major findings\nwere reflected in a memorandum of understanding, which was discussed and signed at a\nmeeting on 9 November 2000. This report is based on the findings of the Mission, and proposes\napproval of a loan for the Project and use of loan savings from one ongoing project. Appendix 1\nsummarizes ADB\u2019s total assistance package for flood damage rehabilitation.\nII I.  BACKGROUND\nA.  Special Circumstances of the 2000 Floods\n4. Whereas the 1996 flood, which caused extensive damage to infrastructure, lasted less\nthan two weeks, the 2000 flood started in the middle of July and continued until mid-November.\nIn 1996, the Mekong River was above emergency level for about 10 days; in 2000, the river has\nbeen well above emergency level for all of September and well into October. The record high\nlevels of the river systems and the unusually long floods, combined with the residual impact of\nthe 1996 floods, have seriously damaged Cambodia\u2019s infrastructure and caused the people\nextensive  suffering  as  a  result  of  displacement,  food  shortage,  interruption  of  economic\nlivelihood, and disease.\n5. Upriver, north of Phnom Penh, water levels dropped steadily below emergency levels\nafter 26 September, while in the southern delta region water has been draining more slowly, or\nnot at all in some areas, as of early November. Periods of severe rainfall in Cambodia or Viet\nNam  continue  to  cause  fresh  flooding  because  of  this  persistent  situation,  and  have,  on\noccasion, caused additional damage to infrastructure.\n                                                          \n1  A.B. Frielink (Sr. Programs Officer and Mission Leader), T.F. Jones (Senior Project Economist), J. Weinstock\n(Senior Poverty Reduction Specialist), P. Logan (Project Specialist), A. Jude (Project Specialist), M. Dembinski\n(Project Specialist), and M. Noguchi (Counsel). ADB\u2019s Resident Representative in Cambodia, and staff of the\nResident Mission provided valuable guidance and support to the Mission. F. Pante, Jr., Manager, and C. Houser,\nEconomist, gave valuable support and guidance from headquarters.", "2\nB.  Impact of the Floods\n6. The floods have had a serious impact on human life and economic activity, because of\nthe unprecedented water levels, and their unusually long duration. Over 260 people died and\nabout 2.8 million people were affected, 57,000 families were evacuated, and 5,700 houses were\ndestroyed. The long duration of the floods meant a loss of income and a draw down of savings\nfor many people, especially the poor and landless. The poorest of the poor are most at risk.\nPoor nutrition increases the threat from postflood disease, though there are as yet no signs of\nany widespread illnesses. The Government has estimated the cost of rehabilitation at over $140\nmillion.\n7. It is estimated that about 2,600 km of primary roads, out of a total of 7,700 km, have\nbeen damaged by the floods. In addition, more than 3,000 m of bridges have been destroyed or\nbadly damaged. More than 100 flood control and irrigation systems in 15 provinces were\ndamaged during the floods. The Kop Srov dike, which protects the city of Phnom Penh, was in\nserious  danger  of  failing  for  almost  a  month  and  is  in  a  poor  state  of  repair.  Based  on\npreliminary estimates, 1,300 km of laterite roads and 2,000 km of earthfill roads were flooded.\nOf the flooded roads, 57 percent of the laterite roads, and almost 100 percent of the earthfill\nroads were damaged to various degrees. More than 1,000 schools were damaged, often badly.\nAround 170 health centers in 16 provinces were affected to various degrees.\n1.  Economic Impact\n8. The 2000 floods will have a major impact on Cambodia\u2019s macroeconomic performance.\nEstimates of the extent of damage to the rice crop range from 10-20 percent of the cultivated\narea. Although details are unavailable at this time, the magnitude of the economic loss from\nother crops destroyed as well as livestock appears to be relatively small given estimates of retail\nvalue  loss  of  $61.8  million  for  rice,  $8.5  million  for  subsidiary  crops,  and  $0.5  million  for\nlivestock.  Thus,  a  rough  estimate  of  the  direct  economic  impact  of  floods  on  agricultural\nproduction is 1.0-2.0 percent of GDP, or an average of 1.5 percent.\n9. There are two main countervailing macroeconomic influences in 2000. First, industrial\ngrowth should reach double digits in 2000 (perhaps 16 percent) mainly because of the 50\npercent increase in garment exports to the United States in the first eight months of 2000\nrelative to the first eight months of 1999. Second, abstracting from any indirect impacts of the\nflood, service sector growth should reach 4.0 percent in 2000, in part because of the 40 percent\nincrease  in  tourist  arrivals  in  the  first  half  of  2000.  Overall,  the  economy  should  achieve\neconomic growth of perhaps 3.5 percent. The distribution of this modest growth, however, is\nlikely to be very uneven, with positive growth in the urban areas, and contraction in the flood-\naffected rural areas.\n10. In terms of price movements, seasonal increases in food prices are normal from July\nthrough October. Nevertheless, vegetable prices, carrying a 3.8 percent weight in the consumer\nprice index (CPI), increased sharply in September and are up about 12 percent from a year ago.\nHowever, rice price increases, with a 5.3 percent CPI weight, are more modest and prices are\nstill down about 7.5 percent from a year ago. This is not surprising since vegetable prices tend\nto be determined locally while rice is more influenced by world prices, which are down this year\nbecause of a large supply. Meat and poultry prices, with a 7.9 percent CPI weight, rose slightly\nin September but are still down 4.5 percent from last year while fish prices, with a 6.8 percent\nweight, are up sharply in September but still down 10 percent from last year.", "3\n2.  Agriculture\n11. Agriculture,  which  is  the  primary  source  of  income  in  rural  areas,  is  generally\nsubsistence-oriented, with rice as the dominant crop. Rice is mainly cultivated along the Mekong\nRiver and around the Tonle Sap Lake. About 2.1 million ha (more than 90 percent of the total\ncropped area of 2.3 million ha) are planted with rice. Other major agricultural crops include\nmaize (44,100 ha), soybeans (30,600 ha), vegetables (29,100 ha), and mung beans (25,600\nha). Rubber and timber have long been the most important agriculture export products of\nCambodia, but agricultural products are increasingly being traded with neighboring countries.\nThe average farm size is estimated at 1.10-1.26 ha. However, such national averages mask\nconsiderable differences in average farm size between provinces, ranging from 0.55 ha in\nKandal Province in the south to 2.10 ha in Mondol Kiri Province in the east. About three-\nquarters of rural households are also engaged in livestock production.\n12. Recent declines in crop yields were mainly caused by irregular weather conditions,\nparticularly rainfall unfavorable for rainfed rice cultivation, and by the shortage of irrigation\nfacilities. Less than 10 percent of the cultivated area in Cambodia is irrigated. The country\u2019s\nannual yield of unhusked rice was estimated at 1.8 tons per ha in 1999. This yield level is\nconsidered to be the lowest in the region and has improved from 1.0 ton per ha in 1967.\nConstraints to improving agricultural productivity include (i) poor transport infrastructure in rural\nareas;  (ii)  inadequate  irrigation  facilities,  particularly  for  rice  cultivation;  (iii)  ineffective\nagricultural research and extension services; and (iv) lack of reliable and easily accessible\nfinancial  services.  Provision  of  better  access  to  a  package  of  necessary  inputs  such  as\nimproved seed varieties, fertilizers, and pesticides is also required for increased agricultural\nproductivity. Nevertheless, there was a slight increase in total rice production, estimated at\nabout 3.50 million tons in 1998 as compared with 3.45 million tons in 1997.\n13. The projected impact of the floods on rice production is two-fold. Wet season rice, which\nis  not  normally  flooded,  has  been  under  water  for  extended  periods  of  time,  thus  greatly\nreducing or fully destroying the crop. Some of the dry season rice is grown in fields where the\nwater  is  retained  when  floods  recede.  In  a  number  of  areas,  retaining  dams  have  been\nbreached or undermined so that water will escape freely, and consequently, yields can be\nexpected to be lower than normal.\n14. At the village and farm level, many fields have been inundated for extended periods, and\npeople have lost their complete crop. They have also been forced to consume their rice seed.\nMoreover, the poorer part of the population is most likely to live in the lower-lying parts, and will\nbe hardest hit. The continued high water levels also mean that it may not be possible to plant\nlate wet season or recession rice, as the days are getting too short for the crop to grow. Thus, in\nparts of the country there is an acute shortage of food, which the Government and the relief\nagencies are trying to address, and a shortage of seed for the coming seasons.\n3.  Poverty\n15. After years of prolonged civil conflict, Cambodia suffers pervasive poverty.  Using a\nconsumption-based poverty line defined as adequate income to buy a daily 2,100-calorie food\nbasket plus an allowance for nonfood expenditure, in 1997, 36.0 percent of the population were\nclassified as poor. However a large proportion of the population is clustered around the poverty\nline indicating a potential for significant increases in the incidence of poverty when faced with\neven limited environmental, political, or economic uncertainties. Poverty varies considerably", "4\nbetween urban and rural areas, as well as across regions. Urban areas are relatively better off,\nwith  about  90  percent  of  the  poor  in  rural  areas,  especially  those  relying  on  subsistence\nagriculture as the primary source of income.\n16. Widespread poverty in Cambodia is indicated by the paucity of basic economic and\nsocial infrastructure. Only 14 percent of villages have a market, 43 percent have access to\nelectricity (at least in some households), 11 percent have a bank or credit facility, and 4 percent\nhave an agricultural extension worker. Furthermore, only 23 percent of villages have access to\npiped water, 46 percent have a primary school, 5 percent have lower secondary schools, and 16\npercent have a clinic. While richer villages are diversified, with trading as an important economic\nactivity, poorer villages tend to depend heavily on subsistence agricultural activities.\n17. In the poorest quintile of villages, 70 percent of the population are poor.  Furthermore,\nmany of the poorest villages are on less productive lands in areas vulnerable to flood or\ndrought. Hence, while the recent floods have increased the overall national poverty level, in\nareas effected by the flood already high levels of poverty have become extremely high.\nC.  Response to the Floods\n18. The NCDM, under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister, has been directing and\ncoordinating relief efforts from the start. The focus has been primarily distributing food, blankets,\nand medicines, and providing shelter for the displaced. Close coordination has taken place\nthrough regular meetings between the Government, the funding community (cochaired by the\nUnited Nations [UN] Development Programme and World Food Programme [WFP]), and the\nCambodian Red Cross. Line ministries have been charged with damage assessment, although\nin many cases detailed assessment has to await recession of the waters. Priority is given to the\nrestoration of road communications through the national road network.\n19. To coordinate relief efforts with the international community, a core group has been\nestablished for planning and coordination, consisting of the NCDM, Cambodian Red Cross,\nInternational Federation of the Red Cross, and the UN Disaster Management Team. Under the\ncore group, an emergency response group (ERG) was formed as the focal point for coordination\nand information sharing. The ERG has been meeting weekly or every two weeks. Recently, four\nsubgroups have been formed, one each for: (i) emergency relief assistance; (ii) food security;\n(iii) health; and (iv) water, sanitation, and small-scale infrastructure. Action is being taken to\nform a fifth subgroup for data collection and dissemination.\nD.  External Assistance\n20. While funding agencies have generally been actively involved with the ERG, and been\nsupportive of the Government in the management and relief operations, firm financial pledges\nhave been slow in forthcoming. On 5 October 2000, five UN agencies published an appeal for\nrelief and some rehabilitation assistance worth $10.8 million. As of 7 November, pledges of only\n$3 million had been received through the UN system. In addition, the International Federation of\nthe Red Cross pledged $2 million, and smaller amounts were pledged by bilateral agencies and\nNGOs, totaling around $16.6 million (Appendix 2). For the rehabilitation of infrastructure, a\nnumber of donors have shown interest, but few firm commitments have been made to date.", "5\nE.  Lessons Learned\n21. ADB\u2019s 1999 country portfolio review mission concluded that the Government had made\nconsiderable progress in improving project implementation. Core capacity in line ministries\ninvolved in implementing ADB-assisted projects started to emerge over the last few years, while\nthe streamlining measures adopted by the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) to expedite\nprocessing of contract award documents and disbursement requests have yielded positive\nresults. The Government and ADB have made a concerted effort to build capacity of counterpart\nstaff through technical assistances, training seminars, and manuals. Compliance with loan\ncovenants,  particularly  the  timely  submission  of  audited  project  accounts  and  financial\nstatements, has generally been satisfactory. The 1999 mission advised the Government to take\nmeasures to minimize delays in project implementation and to consider increasing delegation of\nauthority to project directors.\n22. A draft audit report for the first emergency rehabilitation loan to Cambodia2 drew the\nfollowing  conclusions.  First,  emergency  loans  should  not  include  sectors  with  complicated\nissues that require an integrated approach and long-term preparation. Second, emergency\nloans should adopt a \u201cprocess approach\u201d to permit flexible adjustment of project design during\nimplementation. Third, special treatment should be given to emergency loans when necessary,\nincluding intensive use of consultants, ADB financing of most or even all project costs, and ADB\nfinancing of operation and maintenance (O&M) funds for a fixed period. Last, follow-up projects\ncould be prepared in parallel with emergency loans to address policy and institutional issues\nand sustain the benefits of the emergency loans.\nF.  The Country Operational Strategy of ADB\n23. ADB\u2019s country operational strategy for Cambodia, Cambodia: Enabling a Socioeconomic\nRenaissance, July 2000,3 emphasizes support for poverty reduction through interventions in\nthree priority areas. First, to broadly support economic development of rural areas, ADB will\ntake a lead facilitative role in water resource management, while playing important supporting\nroles in rural development, critical wetlands protection, and agricultural reform. Second, to assist\nhuman and social development, ADB will lead the facilitation of a sector approach in education\nwith complimentary supporting roles in health and water supply. Third, to bolster private sector\ndevelopment, ADB will lead funding agencies\u2019 efforts to support development of the nation\u2018s\nroad network while playing a key role in finance and a supporting role in energy. Finally, ADB\nwill provide strategic support in economic governance in economic planning, public finance\nmanagement, and legal reform.\nIV .  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n24. The unprecedented intensity and duration of the 2000 floods have resulted in major\ndisruptions  of  people\u2019s  lives  and  economic  activity,  and  have  severely  damaged  physical\ninfrastructure. The cost of rehabilitation is beyond the capacity of the Government alone. By\nproviding funds for rehabilitation work, the Project will permit the Government to maintain its\ndevelopment programs at a reasonable level.\n                                                          \n2 Loan 1199-CAM(SF): Special Rehabilitation Assistance Project  for $67.7 million, approved on 26 November 1992.\n3 STS: CAM 2000-15: Country Operational Strategy, Enabling a Socioeconomic Renaissance, July 2000.", "6\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n25. The  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  help  the  Government  rehabilitate  key\ninfrastructure damaged by the 2000 floods, and to enable the early restoration of economic and\nsocial activity, especially for the rural poor. The Project provides for rehabilitation of facilities in\nkey sectors to preflood levels in 16 provinces. Sectors were identified based on the following\nconsiderations:\n(i)  the priorities of the Government,\n(ii)  ADB experience and involvement in the sector,\n(iii)  damage to ongoing or completed ADB projects,\n(iv)  impact on economic and social welfare of the community, and\n(v)  a clear division of responsibilities with other agencies.\n26. The Project will rehabilitate flood-damaged facilities through the provision of civil works,\nequipment and materials, and consulting services for design, evaluation and implementation,\nsupervision, and coordination. The Project will have six parts:\n(i)  Part A: national transport network comprises urgently needed repair (phase I)\nand  rehabilitation  (phase  II)  of  the  flood-damaged  national  road  network,\nincluding bridges that have been damaged or washed away, and repair of railway\nembankments and railway bridges.\n(ii)  Part B: flood control and irrigation comprises rehabilitation of a major flood\ncontrol dike protecting Phnom Penh, and of major and minor irrigation facilities,\nincluding embankments, water control structures, and canals.\n(iii)  Part  C:  rural  infrastructure  comprises  rehabilitation  of  flood-damaged  rural\ninfrastructure  facilities,  including  rural  roads,  bridges,  and  culverts  within  the\nareas of ADB-financed projects, and of WFP-executed projects.\n(iv)  Part D: education comprises (a) rehabilitation of education facilities, including\nmajor repairs to floors, roofing, and walls; and (b) replacement of furniture and\nequipment.\n(v)  Part E: health comprises repair of health centers and clinics, half of which are\nunder an ongoing ADB project.\n(vi)  Part F: support to the project monitoring and coordination unit (PMCU) will\nassist  the  PMCU  by  providing  consulting  services,  equipment,  supplies,  and\nincremental administrative and personnel costs.\n27. The  Project  will  follow  a  sector  approach,  with  subprojects  selected  during  Project\nimplementation. The sector approach is a suitable response to emergencies, as it allows for\nquick response and maximum flexibility within the agreed framework and selection criteria. For\neach of the five sectors identified for assistance under the Project, on-going ADB-assisted\nprojects are in place. The Project is an essential component of the Government\u2019s overall plans\nfor  the  recovery  from  the  floods.  Two  subprojects  were  already  identified  and  brought  to\nappraisal stage, to allow immediate start of the works under retroactive financing arrangements.", "7\nFor Parts A-E, the respective Implementing Agencies (IAs) will identify eligible subprojects on\nthe basis of general as well as sector-specific criteria.\nC.  Cost Estimates\n28. The total cost of the Project is estimated at $83 million equivalent, comprising about\n$47.0 million in foreign exchange cost and $36.0 million equivalent in local currency, including\ntaxes and duties. Since a sector approach is being followed, the cost estimates are on an\noverall  basis,  and  therefore  no  specific  allowances  have  been  made  for  physical  or  price\ncontingencies. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3.\nD.  Financing Plan\n29. It is proposed that the ADB provide a loan of $55 million equivalent from its Special Fund\nresources, representing 66 percent of the total cost of the Project. The loan will finance the full\nforeign exchange cost of equipment, materials, and services, and 45 percent of local currency\ncosts (excluding taxes and duties). The Government will meet $13.5 million equivalent of the\nlocal cost component of the Project, including taxes and duties of $11.5 million and $2.0 million\nas the counterpart contribution for agriculture, to be financed from the proceeds from the\nAgriculture Program Loan,4 the second tranche of which was released in September 2000. WFP\nwill contribute around $2 million in kind, and $12.5 million will be reallocated from existing loans.\nTable 1: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total Percent\nSource Exchange Currency Cost Financing\nADB loan 35.5 19.5 55.0 66.3\nLoan Reallocation 11.0 1.5 12.5 15.0\nWFP Grant 0.5 1.5 2.0 2.4\nGovernment 0.0 13.5 13.5 16.3\nTotal   47.0   36.0   83.0  100.0\nADB=Asian Development Bank; WFP=World Food Programme.\nSource: Staff Estimates\n30. The Borrower will be the Kingdom of Cambodia. The ADB loan will be from ADB\u2019s\nSpecial Funds resources with a term of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years. The annual\ninterest charge will be 1.0 percent during the grace period and 1.5 percent thereafter.\n31. Local cost financing is justified given the tight fiscal situation in Cambodia and the\nexpenditure required for relief and rehabilitation work. At the same time, revenue generation is\nlikely to decline because of the expected slow down in the economy, which will increase the\nfiscal deficit.\nE.  Executing Agency\n32. Given the multisectoral nature of the Project, and the relatively weak human resource\ncapacity in the Government, close coordination and monitoring is required. The Government\nhas established the PCC, chaired by the Minister of Planning. The PCC is the Executing Agency\n                                                          \n4  Loan 1445-CAM(SF): Agriculture Sector Program, for $30 million, approved on 20 June 1990.", "8\nfor the Project, and is charged with (i) guiding the implementation of the Project to ensure that\nthe Project is implemented within the overall policies and guidelines of the Government and\nADB,  (ii)  monitoring  the  overall  implementation  of  the  Project,  (iii)  providing  all  necessary\nassistance  for  the  quick  and  efficient  implementation  of  the  Project,  (iv)  ensuring  close\ncoordination between all project activities and activities sponsored by other agencies, and (v)\nensuring that ADB is informed in a timely manner of project progress and any issues arising.\nThe PCC will meet at least once every six months. The PCC will, as required, consult with the\nrepresentatives of the IAs on all matters relating to the Project. To enable the PCC to fulfill its\nrole adequately, all project reports being submitted to ADB will also be made available to PCC.\nA representative of ADB\u2019s Cambodia Resident Mission will be invited to attend PCC meetings.\nThe PCC is sufficiently senior in its membership to ensure that any problems arising can be\nquickly resolved. To carry out its activities and responsibilities, the PCC has established the\nPMCU.\nF.  Implementation Arrangements\n33. ADB has ongoing projects in each of the five sectors where emergency assistance is\nproposed, and teams of consultants are in place in most cases. All of the ongoing projects\nconcerned are rated satisfactory. The implementation arrangements for the Project have been\ndesigned to follow the established procedures, practices, and principles as much as possible, in\nthe interest of speed and economy. Other than for the coordination of project activities between\nsectors and with the funding community, no new implementation arrangements are foreseen.\n1.  Project Management and Coordination\n34. The PMCU, established by the PCC and acting for and on behalf of the PCC, shall be\nresponsible for the day-to-day management, monitoring and coordination of the Project activities\namong  the  IAs  and  with  the  MEF.  The  PMCU  shall  carry  out  its  responsibilities  in  close\ncollaboration with the Implementing Agencies, which the PMCU shall assist and advise in any\npossible way to facilitate implementation of the Project. The PMCU shall act as facilitator,\ncoordinator and advisor. The IAs shall be responsible and accountable for management and\ndecision-making in relation to subproject identification, design and implementation.\n2.  Project Implementation\n35. The PMCU shall be headed by the Secretary of State of Planning (the Project Director),\nand shall have a secretariat office in the MOP, supported by staff from the Borrower and\nconsultants. The PMCU shall be responsible for: (i) endorsement and submission of subprojects\nto the ADB for approval; (ii) full-time monitoring and coordination of project implementation; (iii)\nregular reporting to the PCC and the ADB on the progress of implementation; (iv) monitoring\nand coordination of procurement and management of disbursements; (v) consolidation of the\nProject accounts and maintenance of imprest accounts; (vi) guidance and assistance to the IAs\non the ADB\u2019s procedures and all other project implementation matters, and (vii) all matters\nconcerning donor coordination, to ensure consistency, synergy and conflict avoidance with other\nrehabilitation assistance. The PMCU shall be directly responsible to the PCC and the ADB for\ncontinuous monitoring and coordination of project implementation.\n36. The  PMCU  shall  conduct  regular  project  implementation  meetings.  Senior\nrepresentatives, one each from the PCC, PMCU, the MEF and the respective IAs (at the\nDirector  or  Deputy  Director  level)  shall  meet  regularly,  at  least  once  every  two  weeks  to\napprove, endorse, as necessary, subproject proposals and to decide on project implementation", "9\nmatters  that  can  not  be  resolved  by  the  IAs  themselves.  Decisions  made  by  the  project\nimplementation meetings shall be binding. Copies of the Minutes of the meetings shall be\nsubmitted to the PCC for information.\n37. The technical preparation and implementation of subprojects under Parts A-E of the\nProject shall be carried out by the five IAs: Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT),\nMinistry of Water Resources and Meteorology (MOWRAM), Ministry of Rural Development\n(MRD), Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (MOEYS), and Ministry of Health (MOH),\nrespectively. Each of the IAs shall direct existing Project Implementation Units (PIUs) or Project\nManagement Offices (PMOs) to become responsible for their respective part of the Project. The\nPIUs/PMOs, under the overall supervision and guidance of the PMCU, shall be responsible for\n(i)  subproject  identification  and  submission  to  the  PMCU  for  endorsement;  (ii)  subproject\nformulation and design; (iii) subproject implementation, including construction supervision; (iv)\nprocurement and contract administration; (v) maintaining subproject accounts and operation of\nsecondary imprest accounts; (vi) quality control; and (vii) preparation of half-yearly action plans,\nprogress reports and work programs for submission to and agreement with the PMCU. Each\nPIU/PMO shall be headed by a qualified senior staff of the IA, and shall include other technical\nstaff as appropriate to implement the subprojects quickly and efficiently. The IAs shall retain full\naccountability  and  responsibility  for  the  project  implementation.  Sufficient  authority  and\naccountability shall be delegated to the respective PIU/PMO to enable them to act pro-actively\nand effectively carry out their duties and functions.\n38. To ensure timely implementation of the Project, the Government has agreed to specific\nmeasures to ensure that the internal approval process for subproject selection and approval,\nand for contracts does not unduly slow down the Project. In this context, the Government has\nagreed that, for each IA, whenever a signature is required for approval at senior levels within the\nconcerned ministry, the signed approval will be given within five working days, or the papers\nconcerned returned for clarification or additional information. The PMCU has the responsibility\nof closely supervising the adherence to this agreement.\n39. Project implementation needs to be completed within three years after the disaster\noccurred. IAs that have not managed to sign the necessary consultants, supplies, and major\ncivil works contracts within 18 months of appraisal date (9 November 2000), will no longer be\neligible for funding under the loan, and loan proceeds will be reallocated to other parts of the\nproject.\n40. Part F is to support the PMCU in fulfilling its mandate. The assistance will provide\ninternational  consultants,  operational  support,  and  incremental  administrative  costs.  One\ninternational consultant will be hired as soon as possible for a period of three years. The\nconsultant will assist in overall coordination, and ensuring speedy submission and approval of\nsubprojects. An accountant who is already familiar with ADB accounting requirements and\nprocedures will be hired for a period of three years. Operational support will include office\nequipment, vehicles, supplies and costs for field visits. Details of implementation arrangements\nfor each part are in Appendix 4.\n3.  Subproject Selection and Approval\n41. Subprojects will be identified and selected by the IAs, and endorsed by the PMCU, on\nthe basis of the following criteria:", "10\n(i)  the subproject will rehabilitate public infrastructure that is in one or more of the\nfive identified sectors and was damaged by the 2000 floods;\n(ii)  subproject implementation will be completed by 31 December 2003;\n(iii)  the subproject must be the most cost effective or least-cost solution alternative;\n(iv)  subprojects  that  rehabilitate  infrastructure  from  ongoing  or  completed  ADB-\nassisted projects will receive high priority for funding;\n(v)  a subproject will not be financed by any agency other than ADB;\n(vi)  the  subproject  will  meet  the  sector-specific  criteria  agreed  upon  by  the\nGovernment and ADB;\n(vii)  the subproject will confom with ADB\u2019s guidelines on resettlement; and\n(viii)  the  subproject  will  conform  with  the  environmental  requirements  of  the\nGovernment and ADB.\n42. The first subproject to be carried out by each IA under Parts A-E, shall be subject to prior\nreview and approval by ADB. Subsequent subprojects exceeding $250,000 equivalent shall be\nsubmitted by the IA to the PMCU for endorsement and to the ADB for review and approval.\nSubprojects costing less than $250,000 shall be sent to the PMCU and the ADB for information\nonly. Regardless of the amount specified above, for subproject 1 of Part B (rehabilitation of a\nmajor flood control dyke protecting Phnom Penh) and any other subproject in the Project which\nmay include an issue of resettlement, the IA shall prepare and submit a resettlement plan in\naccordance with the ADB\u2019s guidelines on involuntary resettlement and other arrangements\nagreed upon between the Government and the ADB, for ADB approval before carrying out the\nsubproject.\n4.  Consulting Services\n43. Given the tight time schedule and the shortage of well-trained and experienced staff in\nthe  Government,  strong  consultant  support  is  required  for  the  PMCU  and  IAs.  Consulting\nservices are required due to (i) the need for careful verification of flood damage assessment\nreports in each sector, (ii) the sector loan approach requiring preparation and evaluation of\nsubprojects, (iii) the need for intensive supervision for the rapid completion of works, (iv) the\nincreased workload on the existing supervisory staff of the Ias, and (v) the need for consistency\nin design and construction standards. In a number of instances, consultant contracts under\nexisting  loans  can  be  extended  or  expanded  in  scope  to  provide  the  necessary  services,\nthereby minimizing the need for consulting services under the loan. The Project will require an\nestimated total of 340 person-months of international and 830 person-months of domestic\nconsulting services.\n44. Consultants will assist the PMCU in (i) overall project coordination and supervision; (ii)\nmaintenance of project accounts and operation of the imprest account in accordance with ADB\nguidelines;  (iii)  provision  of  guidance  to  IAs  in  identification,  selection,  and  preparation  of\nsubprojects;  (iv)  evaluation  of  proposed  subprojects  and  liaison  with  ADB  to  ensure  early", "11\napproval;  and  (v)  meeting  the  reporting  requirements.  Outline  terms  of  reference  are  in\nAppendix 5.\n45. Consultants to the IAs will help in (i) identify and formulate subprojects; (ii) prepare\nspecifications, designs and cost estimates; (iii) evaluate bids and contract awards; (iv) supervise\nof construction, quality, and cost control, including issuance of payment certificates; and (v)\nreport progress.\n46. All  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  the  IA  concerned  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the\nengagement of domestic consultants. In order to save time, and because many of the IAs have\nalready engaged consultants under related ADB-financed projects, ADB and the Government\nhave agreed that direct engagement of consultants is preferred, as provided for under ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. At the request of the Government, ADB will assist in the\nselection process by shortlisting the consultants, inviting proposals, and evaluating and ranking\nthem.\n5.  Procurement\n47. Goods and services to be financed by ADB will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement.  Equipment  and  materials  will  be  procured  under  international\ncompetitive bidding (ICB) where the cost is valued at more than $1 million equivalent, or by\ninternational shopping where the cost is valued at $1 million equivalent or less. Since the project\nsites  are  scattered  throughout  the  country  and  mostly  involve  relatively  small  civil  works\ncontracts, the civil works are not likely to attract the interest of international contractors. For\nparts B-E, domestic contractors have the capacity and capability to undertake the required\ncontracts, following established local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures. In the interest of\ntime, only contractors that have been prequalified under other contracts will be invited to bid.\nFollowing the procedures established under Loan 1697-CAM5, all civil works contracts for the\nrehabilitation of roads and bridges, with a value of $2.5 million or more, will be awarded on the\nbasis of ICB procedures. For suitable contract packages under $2.5 million, LCB procedures will\nbe followed. The rationale is that ICB contractors will only be interested in the larger continuous\ncivil  works  contracts  while  the  local  contractors,  including  international  contractors  already\nestablished and working in Cambodia, could be interested in contracts in scattered locations,\nsome with security problems. The force account procedure will also be allowed particularly for\nsmall, scattered civil works where it is difficult to prepare logical contract packages mainly\nbecause of the piecemeal nature of the civil works. Procurement periods will be reduced to 21\ndays for LCB contracts and 60 days for ICB tenders.\n48. The tender evaluation and contract documentation for civil works for the first subproject\nselected by each IA and for civil works with a value exceeding $250,000 equivalent, will be\nreviewed and approved by ADB before the award of the contract. The award of subsequent civil\nworks contracts with a value not exceeding $250,000 equivalent will be subject to ADB\u2019s later\napproval; however, if the award or terms of any such contract are not subsequently approved by\nADB, the Government will refund to ADB any payment made from the loan to finance such a\ncontract, and then provide financing from its own or other resources. Equipment or material\nvalued at less than $100,000 equivalent may be procured by direct purchase. Bid packages will\nbe prepared for the subprojects in line with the practice being followed by executing agencies in\nongoing ADB financed projects.\n                                                          \n5  Loan 1697-CAM (SF): Primary Roads Restoration Project approved for $68.0 million on 21 September 1999.", "12\n6.  Advance Action\n49. Given the urgency of the Project, ADB has approved advance action for the procurement\nof  equipment,  materials,  and  civil  works,  and  for  the  recruitment  of  consultants.  The\nGovernment has been advised that such advance action does not commit ADB to finance any\npart of the Project.\n7.  Retroactive Financing\n50. Retroactive financing is essential for the repair or rehabilitation of critical facilities before\nthe next flooding season. The Project therefore provides for retroactive financing of eligible\nexpenditures incurred not earlier than 9 November 2000 (date of appraisal), provided that the\nexpenditures are certified by the IAs and consultants; the certification is acceptable to ADB; and\nthe  subprojects  concerned  were  identified,  appraised,  and  ready  for  implementation  on  or\nbefore 9 November 2000. Retroactive financing has therefore been approved for subproject 1 of\npart A (urgent repairs to the national road network), and subproject 1 of part B (rehabilitation of\nthe Kop Srov flood protection dike). Details are in Appendix 6. The Government has been\nadvised that provision for retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance any part of the\nProject.\n8.  Implementation Schedule\n51. ADB and the Government have agreed that project implementation will be completed as\nmuch as possible before the start of the flooding season in 2003, but in any case not later than\nDecember 2003. This will provide for a partial dry season (2001, assuming that the floodwaters\nwill recede by January 2001), and two full dry seasons (2002 and 2003). Priority will be given to\nsubprojects that are critical to complete before the next flooding season in July 2001.\n9.  Performance Reviews and Reports\n52. The overall progress of project implementation shall be monitored by the PCC. For that\npurpose,  the  PCC,  through  the  PMCU,  shall  establish  a  reporting  system  of  performance\nmonitoring, and issues resolution action plans. Each PIU/PMO and the PMCU shall prepare\nhalf-yearly Performance Actions Plans (PAP) to serve as a management feedback and action\ntool. PAPs shall be reviewed and approved by the PCC and the IAs concerned on a half-yearly\nbasis. PAPs shall establish a work plan with quantitative, qualitative and time bound targets for\nthe following six months. PAPs shall be jointly agreed and approved by the IAs and the PCC.\nThe ADB shall be invited to participate in the half-yearly reviews to address issues and resolve\nproblems encountered during Project implementation.\n53. Within three months of physical completion of the Project, the Government will submit to\nADB a completion report that provides details about implementation, costs, benefits, and other\ninformation as requested by ADB.\n10.  Accounts and Audit\n54. Each IA will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify the goods and\nservices financed from the loan proceeds, the financing resources received, the expenditures\nincurred for the Project, and the use of local funds. Accounts will be established and maintained\nin accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles and following the guidelines in", "13\nthe Project Accounting Manual of MEF. Consolidated Project accounts and related financial\nstatements will be compiled by the PMCU, and audited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB.\nThe audited reports and related financial statements will be submitted to ADB not later than 12\nmonths after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate.\n11.  Imprest Accounts\n55. An imprest account will be established at a bank acceptable to ADB and operated by the\nPMCU. Each IA will also open a new imprest account for the Project. Each imprest account will\nbe operated by the PCC or the IA concerned, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement\nHandbook, and detailed arrangements agreed upon by the Government and ADB. The initial\namount in each imprest account will not exceed four months of estimated expenditures. ADB\u2019s\nstatement of expenditures procedures will be followed for reimbursement of expenditures and\nfor the liquidation of each imprest account, for payments not exceeding $100,000 equivalent in\neach case.\n12.  Operation and Maintenance\n56. All  facilities  rehabilitated  under  the  Project  will  be  operated  and  maintained  by  the\nresponsible IAs after completion of the works. Where facilities form part of an ongoing or\ncompleted subproject, the O&M arrangements agreed upon with ADB for those subprojects will\ncontinue to apply. The Government will make available on a timely basis the funds necessary\nfor this purpose during and after project implementation. Under the Primary Roads Restoration\nProject,6 provision has been made to strengthen the maintenance planning and implementation\ncapability of MPWT. Arrangements are also being made to establish a road fund to help ensure\nfunding for road maintenance. In the case of flood control and irrigation schemes, MOWRAM\nwill be responsible for O&M. MOWRAM has developed a policy and legislation for sustainable\nO&M of irrigation systems, which involves the transfer of O&M responsibilities to farmers over a\nfive-year transitional period.7 The approach for this Project will emphasize the involvement of\nfarmers in the management of the repaired and rehabilitated systems. Staff from MOWRAM\u2019s\nIrrigated Agriculture Department will work closely with farmers to form water user communities\nto manage the rehabilitated schemes. After completion, responsibility for each scheme will be\ntransferred to its water user community\u2019s board.\n13.  Community Participation\n57. Community consultation and participation is important to incorporate local knowledge\nand experience, understand community needs and priorities, and avoid any conflicts of interest\namong beneficiaries. Most of the works will involve the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure\nand should therefore be well accepted by local communities. Rehabilitation works will also\nreinforce the perception that previous inputs in project selection, design, and implementation\nhave  not  been  lost.  Several  of  the  IAs  have  procedures  for  community  consultation  and\nparticipation, especially for rural infrastructure, irrigation, and education. These procedures will\nbe applied in project activities as well.\n                                                          \n6  Loan 1697-CAM (SF): Primary Roads Restoration Project approved for $68.0 million on 21 September 1999\n7 Kingdom of Cambodia, June 2000.

The Implementing Agencies\na.  Part A: National Transport Network\n58. The MPWT will be the IA for part A. MPWT will appoint a senior engineer as a full-time\ndirector, who will be responsible for the day-to-day control of part A. For the works to be\nundertaken, including consultant services through funds provided under ongoing loans, existing\norganizational arrangements will apply. For the ongoing projects, the Project Management Units\n(PMUs) are in place and are operating well.8 Additional staff will be needed within the PMUs to\nhandle the additional work required under the loan.\nb.  Part B: Flood Control and Irrigation\n59. MOWRAM,  the  IA  for  part  B,  was  created  in  1999  by  upgrading  the  Ministry  of\nAgriculture, Forestry and Fisheries\u2019 Directorate General of Agricultural Hydraulics and Hydro-\nMeteorology. MOWRAM is responsible for managing all Cambodia\u2019s water resources in an\nenvironmentally sound manner so as to optimize benefits in the short and long term. MOWRAM\nhas nine technical and administration departments and is overseen by a minister and cabinet of\nsenior officers. This set-up is replicated in each of Cambodia\u2019s 23 provinces. MOWRAM has\n800 staff in Phnom Penh and about the same number in the provinces. MOWRAM has overall\nresponsibility  for  the  identification,  planning,  detailed  design,  construction,  and  O&M  of\nirrigation, drainage, and flood mitigation schemes. Large-scale systems (5,000 ha and over) are\nmanaged from the central level, while all other systems are the primary responsibility of the\nprovinces.\nc.  Part C: Rural Infrastructure\n60. MRD  is  the  IA  for  part  C.  MRD  was  established  in  December  1993  as  the  State\nSecretariat  for  Rural  Development,  the  successor  to  the  short-lived  Ministry  of  Rural\nDevelopment under the provisional Government. The State Secretariat was upgraded to a\nministry in October 1994. MRD\u2019s responsibilities include (i) rehabilitating and reconstructing\nsmall-scale rural infrastructure; (ii) improving production and marketing systems; (iii) ensuring\nfood security for all Cambodians in rural areas; (iv) ensuring the social rehabilitation of returnees\nthroughout the country in a fair and equitable manner; (v) improving the socioeconomic status of\nthe rural poor; and (vi) rehabilitating, constructing, and maintaining tertiary level rural roads.\n61. MRD  has  eight  departments  consisting  of  four  administrative  departments  and  four\ntechnical departments, including the departments of community development (responsible for,\namong  others,  rural  roads  and  rural  infrastructure),  rural  water  supply,  rural  economic\ndevelopment, and primary health care.  Each department is headed by a director, who is\nassisted  by  a  number  of  deputy  directors.  At  the  provincial  level  the  directorate  of  rural\ndevelopment is also headed by a director, seconded by a deputy director, both of whom work in\nclose cooperation with the provincial governor on matters related to rural development. Unlike\nother  provincial  agencies,  the  representation  of  MRD  extends  to  the  district  level,  with\ndevelopment offices under the district chief (rural development).\n                                                          \n8 PMU-1 is responsible for Loan 1659-CAM: Phnom Penh-Ho Chi Minh City Highway Project  and PMU-2 is\nresponsible for Loan 1697-CAM (SF): Primary Roads Restoration Project.", "15\nd.  Part D: Education\n62. The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (MOEYS) will be the IA for part D and will\nhave overall responsibility for planning, organizing, and coordinating the activities related to\nemergency  flood  rehabilitation  assistance  for  damaged  primary  and  secondary  schools,\nincluding monitoring the progress achieved. MOEYS has previous experience implementing\nADB loans9 and TA projects.  In fact, the Special Rehabilitation Assistance Project included a\ncomponent that supported restoring and upgrading selected educational facilities. MOEYS has\nmanaged external assistance from multilateral and bilateral agencies and has the capacity to\nimplement rehabilitation projects. The ongoing Basic Education Textbook Project10 is rated\nhighly satisfactory both in meeting its development objectives and implementation progress.\nWith the assistance of consultants, MOEYS will be able to continue such good progress in\nimplementation.\ne.  Part E: Health\n63. The Ministry of Health (MOH) will be the IA for part E. MOH is responsible for managing\nthe health care system and its facilities. At the provincial level, the provincial health director has\noverall responsibility for the management and administration of services, but the provincial\nhygiene station is a separate unit accountable to the provincial health director for implementing\nselected  national  programs  such  as  maternal  care.    MOH  has  substantial  experience  in\nimplementing ADB-financed projects as well as other projects of similar types. The ongoing\nBasic Health Project11 is rated highly satisfactory both in meeting its development objectives\nand implementation progress. With the assistance of consultants, MOH will be able to continue\nsuch good progress in implementation.\n15.  Part F: Support to the PMCU\n64. The PMCU is in MOP, which was the Executing Agency for ADB\u2019s emergency loan\n(footnote  2).  The  PMCU  needs  two  long-term  international  consultants  to  help  effectively\ncoordinate and supervise the implementation of the Project.\nG.  Environmental and Social Measures\n16.  Environment\n65. The Project has been classified as Category B, and is not likely to have any significant\nadverse environmental impacts. Civil works will involve rehabilitation or reconstruction of flood-\ndamaged infrastructure. Repairs and rehabilitation of the national roads as well as the rural\nroads will follow existing alignments, and will not involve land acquisition. All subprojects will\nfollow environmental safeguards and technical design specifications established for ongoing\nADB-assisted projects, which have already been subjected to ADB\u2019s environmental assessment\nprocedures. If a subproject is proposed that might involve construction of infrastructure along\nnew alignments or acquisition of land, the responsible IA, through the PMCU, will first submit an\ninitial  environmental  examination  for  ADB  approval.  The  IAs  are  familiar  with  ADB\u2019s\nrequirements for environmental assessments, and have undertaken such examinations in the\n                                                          \n9 Loan 1199-CAM (SF): Special Rehabilitation Assistance for $67.7, approved on 26 November 1992; Loan 1368-\nCAM (SF): Basic Skills for $20 million, approved on 30 August 1995; Loan 1446-CAM (SF): Basic Education\nTextbook Project for $29.3 million, approved on 20 June 1996.\n10 Loan 1446-CAM (SF): Basic Education Textbook, approved for $20.0 million on 20 June 1996.\n11Loan 1447-CAM (SF): Basic Health Services approved for $20.0 million on 20 June 1996.", "16\ncontext of previously approved projects. The Project will have positive environmental benefits by\nlimiting land erosion and failure of embankments along damaged infrastructure.\n17.  Social Dimensions\n66. Flood disasters affect the poor disproportionately in terms of health, housing, livelihood,\nemployment, and food security. Rehabilitation of vital infrastructure will allow resumption of\ncommunication links and economic activity disrupted by the floods. The rehabilitation of the Kop\nSrov dike will involve the resettlement of about 40 houses (approximately 200 people of illegal\nsettlers). Compensation will also be needed for some agricultural land will be taken by the dike\nconstruction.  These  have  not  yet  been  quantified  in  detail.  However,  ADB  will  assist  the\nGovernment\u2019s Interministerial Resettlement Committee (IRC) to prepare a draft resettlement\nplan based on a full census of households that will likely be affected. The plan will be prepared\nin accordance ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (November 1995) and the Handbook\non Resettlement: a Guide to Good Practice. Where there are differences between Government\nprocedures and ADB\u2019s requirements, the latter will govern. The draft Resettlement Plan will\ninclude an entitlement matrix, an indicative budget, indicative figures on the number of persons\nnegatively  affected  by  the  Project,  consultative  mechanisms,  grievance  procedures,\nimplementation procedures, and details for external monitoring and evaluation of resettlement\nand  compensation.  An  independent  agency  acceptable  to  ADB  will  monitor  and  evaluate\nimplementation of the Resettlement Plan. For most subprojects, only minor, if any, resettlement\nand compensation issues are expected because rights-of-way are already established.\n67. Compensation and resettlement activities associated with the Resettlement Plan will be\ncoordinated at the national level by the IRC. The IRC will be chaired by MEF, and will include\nthe governor or deputy governor of each concerned province, the national project director of\nMOWRAM\u2019s  project  management  office,  representatives  of  other  provincial  authorities  and\nministries as appropriate, and representatives from the affected districts and communes as\nmembers. Local level resettlement subcommittees, convened by the IRC will conduct detailed\nimplementation of the Resettlement Plan.\nII.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA. Impact on Poverty and Other Benefits\n68. The Project will benefit large numbers of people in flood-affected areas in Cambodia,\nand especially the poorer section of the population living in the rural areas. Since the Project\nactivities  will  involve  the  restoration  of  existing  facilities,  the  economic  benefits(cid:190)while  not\nquantified12(cid:190)are expected to be high especially because much lower levels of economic activity\nwould persist without the Project. Even without quantification, the benefits of the Project are\nclearly identifiable. A major benefit of the Project will be the restoration of essential transport\nand  social  infrastructure  facilities.  The  restoration  of  communication  links  via  the  national\nhighway system will enable economic activity to resume and will make it easier to distribute\nrelief supplies throughout the country. The restoration of the dike protecting Phnom Penh will\nbenefit  all  residents  who  would  otherwise  be  at  risk  during  the  coming  flooding  season.\nRestoration of irrigation facilities will allow year-round agriculture production to resume as soon\nas possible. Rehabilitation of education facilities will permit children to resume schooling as\n                                                          \n12 Operations Manual, Section 25, recognizes that for emergency rehabilitation projects with many subprojects,\neconomic internal rate of return calculations may not be possible or practical.", "17\nearly as possible, while restoration of health facilities will allow health services to resume. The\nrehabilitation of ADB-assisted projects damaged by the floods will help to ensure that the\nprojected benefits, which could be lost due to the floods, will still accrue.\n69. Rehabilitation  of  infrastructure,  as  well  as  other  Project  activities,  will  directly  and\nindirectly benefit the poor. The majority of the Project works are labor intensive, localized civil\nworks using unskilled or semiskilled labor, and will create local purchasing power, thereby\ncontributing to the revival of the rural economy. By building on the existing capacity building\ncomponents of ongoing ADB-assisted projects, the Project is expected to create long-term\ncapacity for rehabilitation and maintenance of infrastructure, especially in rural areas.\nB. Risks\n70. The  major  risk  is  that  of  delays  caused  by  internal  procedural  problems  in  the\nGovernment. The Government has shown strong commitment to the Project, as it has to ADB-\nfinanced  projects  in  general.  Where  procedural  delays  have  occurred,  they  have  been\nincreasingly been solved, and implementation delay problems have diminished over the last few\nyears.  All  five  IAs  have  experience  with  ADB-financed  projects,  and  the  consultants  will\ncompensate for the lack of capacity within the Government. Furthermore, by working as much\nas possible through existing ADB-assisted projects, facilities, and consultants, the customary\ninitial  delays  in  project  implementation  are  avoided.  The  risk  of  selecting  unnecessary\nsubprojects and of governance-related issues is addressed by the detailed selection criteria,\nstrong consultant support, and the provisions of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy, which have been\nspecifically brought to the attention of the Government.\nV .  ASSURANCES\nA.  Implementation\n71. The Government has agreed that it will take all measures necessary to ensure timely\nand speedy implementation of the Project, including the special measures outlined in paragraph\n77. In this context, the PCC and the PMCU will use their authority the fullest extent possible.\n72. IAs that have not managed to sign the necessary consultants, supplies, and major civil\nworks contracts within 18 months of the appraisal date will no longer be eligible for funding\nunder the loan, and loan proceeds will be reallocated to other parts of the Project.\nB.  Agriculture Sector\n73. While  the  Government  had  requested  the  inclusion  of  the  agriculture  sector  in  the\nProject, the Mission\u2019s findings are that such support would not be suitable under the loan. The\nMission agrees with the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, that there is an urgent\nneed to distribute rice seed. ADB and the Government have agreed that the Government will\nallocate up to $2 million from the funds recently released under the Agriculture Sector Program\nloan as counterpart funds for this loan, to purchase seeds and other necessary agriculture\ninputs, and start urgent small repairs to dams, weirs, and canals.", "18\nC.  Advance Action and Retroactive Financing\n74. To support early implementation of the Project, advance action for the procurement of\nequipment and materials, start of civil works, and the recruitment of consultants has been\napproved. The Project also provides for retroactive financing of eligible expenditures incurred\nnot earlier than 9 November 2000 (date of appraisal), provided that (i) the expenditures are\ncertified by the IAs and consultants; (ii) the certification is acceptable to ADB; and (iii) the\nsubprojects concerned were identified, appraised, and ready for implementation on or before 9\nNovember 2000. Retroactive financing has therefore been approved for subproject 1 of part A\n(urgent repairs to the national road network) and subproject 1 of part B (rehabilitation of the Kop\nSrov flood protection dike). The Government has been advised that provision for advance action\nand retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance any part of the Project.\nV I.  AVAILABILITY AND UTILIZATION OF LOAN SAVINGS\n75. ADB\u2019s policy on rehabilitation assistance after disasters13 provides for the use of loan\nsavings for rehabilitation works, subject to certain prudential restrictions. In line with that policy,\nand in view of Asian Development Fund resource constraints, ADB\u2019s portfolio in Cambodia was\nreviewed to determine how to maximize the resources available for rehabilitation. Thus, $12.5\nmillion  has  been  identified  for  reallocation  from  two  ongoing  loans.  The  Government  has\nrequested the use of the loan savings to complement the assistance provided by the Project,\nand the savings will be used, specifically for restoration of the national road network and for\nrural roads.\n76. The  savings  will  come  mainly  from  the  Phnom  Penh-Ho  Chi  Minh  City  Highway\nProject,14 which is expected to be completed in late 2002. The bids for the civil works were\nlower than expected due to very competitive bidding and have resulted in a total savings of\n$13.2 million. Of this amount, it is considered prudent to use no more than $10.0 million. The\nremainder will be kept in reserve to compensate for changes in the Special Drawing Rights rate\nand  as  contingency  for  possible  cost  overruns  necessitated  by  unknown  flood  damage.\nReallocation is also proposed from the Rural Infrastructure Improvement Project,15 which has\nsufficient unallocated funds available for this purpose. The project\u2019s scope will be expanded to\nencompass rehabilitation works and no major change in scope will be required. In both cases,\nthe IA will remain the same.\n77. Since the utilization of loan savings is an integral part of the Project, Board approval is\nsought. Subject to Board approval of the recommendation in paragraph 78, the loan documents\nfor the two ongoing projects will be suitably revised(cid:190)as required (cid:190)to reflect the necessary\nchanges.\nVI I.

During appraisal, the work required was assessed in each of the six sectors covered by\nthe  Project,  and  detailed  implementation  arrangements  were  agreed  upon.  The  following\nsections summarize the situation by sector and describe work to be financed under the Project\nand from loan savings. More detailed descriptions are in the supplementary Appendix.\nA.  Roads, Bridges, and Railways\n1.  Damage and Impact\n2. Cambodia\u2019s total road length extends over about 34,000 kilometers (km). The primary\nroad network, including national and provincial roads, extends over about 7,700 km. Only 2,700\nkm  of  this  length  is  considered  all  weather;  most  of  the  remaining  is  passable  only  by\nmotorcycles and four-wheel motorized vehicles depending largely on weather conditions. While\nsignificant progress had been made in improving the road network, the 2000 floods caused\nsevere damage to many parts of the network, has forced temporary social dislocation, and will\nrequire substantial resources to restore.\n3. Severe flooding in 2000 has caused major damage to parts of the primary road network\nmainly in the northeastern, southern, and western parts of the country. Although much of the\nwestern and southern parts of the country are still under water, the flood has started to recede\nand the damage to the roads is becoming clearer. About 1,800 km of national roads have been\nslightly or significantly damaged, and about 820 km of secondary, provincial town, and riverbank\nroads have been damaged. About 3,025 m of bridges have been destroyed or badly damaged.\nSevere erosion and wash outs are also in evidence.\n4. The cost of repairs and rehabilitation has been estimated at $46.0 million of which about\n$42.8 million is for restoring damaged roads and $1.7 million for restoring/repairing damaged\nbridges. An additional estimated $1.5 million is needed for Royal Railways of Cambodia (RRC).\nMost of the emergency (phase 1) repairs, while extensive in nature, can be undertaken using\nlabor and materials available in the provinces. Rehabilitation/restoration works using specialized\nmaterials or more sophisticated construction techniques will probably require the mobilization of\nforeign  contractors  and  generally  have  very  high  priority  as  they  are  mostly  on  important\nnational highways.\n2.  Project Scope\n5. Part A consists of the emergency repair and rehabilitation of flood damaged national\nprimary and secondary roads and of RRC infrastructure. Consultant services under the Project\ndesign (mainly for the rehabilitation works) and supervision of all subprojects\u2019 works.\n3.  Description\n6. Part A will cover all repair and reconstruction necessary to restore the national primary\nand secondary road network and RRC infrastructure to its condition prior to the 2000 flood.\nPreparation of this part will be based on the detailed damage assessment conducted by the\nprovincial authorities and RRC staff with the actual work and necessary designs identified and\nprepared by consultants. Initial priorities where the extent of damage is known have been\nidentified.  Although  these  priorities  will  be  followed  for  the  preparation  of  subprojects,\nexceptions  can  be  made  based  on  the  final  assessment  and  in  line  with  the  criteria  for", "25\nAppendix 4, page 2\nsubprojects and in consultation with the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Repairs will vary from\nminor  repair  of  an  existing  facilities,  road  culverts,  or  bridges  to  major  rehabilitation.\nRehabilitation work will be carried out to restore facilities to the preflood level or to a marginally\nhigher standard as considered cost-effective, and where appropriate will include measures to\nminimize damage from future floods.\n4.  Cost Estimates\n7. Emergency repairs under the Project (phase 1) will cost about $4.0 million equivalent\nand the restoration work (phase 2) will cost about $37.7 million. Additional consultant services\nand  incremental  administration  costs  will  amount  to  $4.3  million.  The  foreign  exchange\ncomponent comprises about 77 percent or $35.5 million including the interest/service charge of\n$1.0 million. The local currency cost is $10.5 million, or 23 percent of the total and includes\nduties and taxes of about $5.1 million. The cost of civil works is based on them being carried out\nby force account, local competitive bidding and international competitive bidding. The cost of\nconsultant  services  (amounting  to  $3.3  million)  covers  surveys,  designs,  and  civil  works\nsupervision. The cost includes remuneration and other expenses; takes into consideration the\nduration of such services; and provides for office equipment, vehicles, office supplies, and\nvehicle operation.\n8. ADB will finance all of the foreign exchange cost and $4.1 million equivalent of the local\ncurrency cost, for a total of $39.6 million equivalent, or 86 percent of the total cost. ADB will\ncover  the  entire  cost,  both  foreign  and  local,  for  consultant  services  and  incremental\nadministrative expenses.\n5.  Implementation Arrangements\n9. The Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) will be the Implementing Agency\n(IA) for this part A. Overall control will be the responsibility of one of MPWT\u2019s secretaries of\nstate.  MPWT  will  appoint  a  senior  engineer  as  a  full-time  project  director,  who  will  be\nresponsible for the day-to-day control of the project. For the work, including consultant services\nthrough funds provided under ongoing loans, existing organizational arrangements will apply.\nFor the ongoing projects, the project management units are in place and are operating well.1\nAdditional staff will be needed within the units to handle the additional work required under the\nloan.\n6.  Consulting Services\n10. International  and  domestic  consultants  and  MPWT  personnel  will  be  needed.\nConsidering the urgency of the Project and the need for rapid preparation and implementation,\nADB has approved advance action for the engagement of consultants has been approved by\nADB and direct selection of consultants for part A. Conditions for direct selection include that the\nconsultants (i) must be currently engaged in a similar project in Cambodia, (ii) must have the\nexpertise needed available on short notice, and (iii) must have originally been selected for an\nongoing project following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants.\n                                                          \n1  PMU-1 is responsible for the Phnom Penh-Ho Chi Minh City Highway Project and PMU-2 is responsible for the\nPrimary Roads Improvement Project.", "26\nAppendix 4, page 3\n11. Staffing input will be about 170 person-months of international consultants and 360\nperson-months of local consultants and MPWT personnel. Expertise required includes project\nand contract management, materials and hydrological engineering, structural engineering, and\nconstruction operations. The overall period of the services will be about 36 months although\nmost of the inputs are expected to be completed within 24 months. The consultants\u2019 contracts\nwill include facilities and services required by them including accommodation, vehicles, offices,\nand equipment.\n12. The consultants will undertake the following tasks:\n(i)  Review and confirm the findings of the detailed flood damage assessment report\nprepared by MPWT.\n(ii)  Select subprojects that generally meet the criteria previously described.\n(iii)  Design subprojects.\n(iv)  Prepare tender documents that allow for a two-envelope bidding procedure. The\nfirst  envelope  will  contain  the  technical  qualifications  of  the  bidder.  Prior  to\ninviting the first tender, post qualification criteria will be established and agreed\nupon by the Government and ADB. Screening will be undertaken to ensure that\nthe contractors do not exceed their capacity to undertake the work. The second\nenvelope will contain the financial bid.\n(v)  Prepare force account packages and related documents such as agreed rates\nand  work  schedules,  and  ensure  that  the  force  account  organizer  has  the\ncapability to undertake the works.\n(vi)  Assist MPWT to evaluate tenders and force account contracts.\n(vii)  Administer the civil works contracts as the engineer, as defined in the contract\ndocuments.\n(viii)  Supervise the civil works on site by providing suitable, qualified, and experienced\nsupervision staff.\n(ix)  Certify  the  works  and  quantities  achieved  to  the  IA  for  payment  to  the\ncontractors.\n(x)  Ensure that proposed subprojects are environmentally sound and incorporate\nmitigation  measures  as  appropriate  to  meet  the  Government\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s\nenvironment  standards  and  regulations  and  to  ensure  that  implementation\ncomplies with the environmental and social mitigation requirements of the civil\nworks contracts.\n(xi)  Prepare regular progress and other reports.", "27\nAppendix 4, page 4\nB.  Flood Control and Irrigation\n1.  Damage and Impact\n13. The floods have affected many protection dikes and irrigation systems in the vicinity of\nthe Mekong River and Tonle Sap. In normal years, a lot of infrastructure is inundated by floods,\nbut there is rarely much damage because the infrastructure is simply submerged and not\nsubjected to strong flows. The flood in 2000 was unusually high and over a much longer period\nthan normal. As a result, much more infrastructure was affected, and it was subjected to high\nand prolonged strong flows. The worst damage is concentrated along the Mekong River flood\nplain and in the high level breakout channels of the Mekong, particularly in Prey Veng and Svay\nRieng.\n14. The most critical impact was on the Kop Srov dike, which protects the city of Phnom\nPenh from floods. The dike was in serious danger of failing for almost a month during peak flood\nlevels in September and October 2000. Failure would have caused disastrous flooding in the\ncity. In addition, more than 100 flood control and irrigation systems in 15 provinces were\ndamaged during the flood. At the time of appraisal, most of these were still submerged by\nfloodwaters, thus limiting detailed damage assessment. The assessment is being undertaken as\nthe floods recede.\n2.  Project Scope and Description\n15. Part B will undertake two subprojects that require large-scale repairs.2 The most urgent\nis the Kop Srov Dike, which needs to be completed before the next flood season to secure\nPhnom  Penh  against  flooding.  This  subproject  should  be  prepared  for  immediate\nimplementation so investigations and designs are already under way. The subproject is reported\nin more detail in Appendix 6. The second large-scale subproject is Kandal Stung Flood Control\nand Irrigation System in Kandal Province, about 20 km southwest of Phnom Penh. The system\nirrigates 10,000 hectares (ha) and provides flood control for the surrounding agricultural land\nand residential area. A number of regulating structures require repair, including one major one-\ngated  structure.  Flood  dikes,  canals,  and  irrigation  service  roads  are  also  damaged.  This\nsubproject will be implemented over two dry seasons, although part of the flood protection work\nneeds to be completed before the next flood season.\n16. Part B will also repair a selected number of the medium- and small-scale irrigation\nschemes reported as damaged by the preliminary assessment. A decision on which schemes\nwill be included will depend on more detailed damage assessment after the flood has receded\nand a process of vetting according to selection criteria agreed upon between the 1A and ADB\n(Supplementary Appendix). The preliminary estimated repair costs of the irrigation systems that\nare reported damaged indicate that seven require medium-scale repairs, and about 100 small-\nscale subprojects may be considered. Repairs will include minor repair of headworks and\nspillways, desilting and reshaping of main and secondary canals, reinstating of canal service\nroads, and repair of side-slope erosion of small protection dikes.\n                                                          \n2 Repairs are considered large-scale if the estimated costs exceed $1M. Medium-scale repairs are in the range of\n$250,000-$1M. Both large- and medium-scale subprojects require prior approval of ADB before contracts are\nawarded. Repairs less than $250,000 are considered small-scale and maybe considered for ADB\u2019s approval after\naward of contracts.", "28\nAppendix 4, page 5\n3.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n17. The cost of the rehabilitation of the Kop Srov dike is $3.7 million, and the cost of the\nrehabilitation systems identified for ADB financing, $8.7 million, for a total of $12.4 million\nequivalent. Civil works will cost $10.9 million, and the balance of $1.5 million is for consultant\nservices (about $0.7 million) and other support. The foreign exchange component comprises\nabout 45 percent, including an interest charge of $0.1 million. The local currency cost is $6.8\nmillion equivalent, or 55 percent of the total cost, and includes $1.6 million in duties and taxes.\nADB will finance all of the foreign exchange costs amounting to $5.6 million and local cost\nfinancing amounting to $5.2 million equivalent, or a total of $10.8 million equivalent. Consultant\nservices  will  cover  surveys,  designs,  and  civil  works  supervision.  The  cost  will  include\nremuneration and other expenses; take into consideration the duration of the services; and\nprovide for office equipment, vehicles, office supplies, and vehicle operation.\n4.  Implementation Arrangements\n18. The Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology (MOWRAM) will be the IA for the\nflood  control  and  irrigation  component.  MOWRAM  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  the\nidentification, planning, detailed design, construction, and operation and maintenance (O&M) of\neach subproject. The implementing arrangements will follow the same model that was recently\nestablished for the ADB-assisted Stung Chinit Irrigation and Rural Infrastructure Improvement\nProject  (RIIP),3  for  which  a  project  management  office  (PMO)  has  been  established  in\nMOWRAM and is headed by a project director at the level of under secretary. The same PMO\nwill take overall responsibility for part B. For each province involved, a project implementation\nunit (PIU) will be established in the provincial departments of water resources and meteorology\nand will be headed by the provincial director. The PIUs will prepare the small- and medium-\nscale subprojects and submit them to the PMO for vetting and approval. The PIUs will have\nprimary responsibility for implementation under overall supervision of the PMO. The two large-\nscale subprojects will be prepared and implemented directly by MOWRAM. International and\nnational consultants will be engaged to assist the PMO and PIUs.\n19. Depending upon the extent of work and the availability of the necessary experienced\nprofessionals, planning, detailed design, and the preparation of tender and contract documents\nwould be carried out by MOWRAM and PIUs. Prequalified contractors will generally undertake\nconstruction work, although scheme beneficiaries should carry out minor earthworks in tertiary\ncanals. Construction supervision will be the responsibility of MOWRAM for the large-scale\nsubprojects and the provinces for the medium- and small-scale schemes.\n5.  Participatory Process\n20. A weakness identified with previous emergency rehabilitation work4 was the lack of\nparticipation by farmers benefiting from the rehabilitation of the irrigation and drainage schemes.\nAs  a  result,  the  investment  failed  to  generate  the  foreseen  increases  in  production,  and\nmaintenance of the works was insufficient. This is also recognized by MOWRAM, which has\ndeveloped a policy and legislation for sustainable OM of irrigation systems. The approach for\nPart B will emphasize the involvement of farmers in the management of the repaired works.\nStaff from the Irrigated Agriculture Department of MOWRAM will work closely with farmers to\n                                                          \n3 Loan 1753-CAM(SF): Stung Chinit Irrigation and Rural Infrastructure approved on 5 September 2000 for $$16.0\nmillion.\n4 Loan 1199-CAM (SF): Special Rehabilitation Assistance Project approved on 26 November 1992 for $67.7 million.", "29\nAppendix 4, page 6\nform farmer water user communities (FWUCs) to manage the rehabilitated schemes. After\ncompletion, responsibility for the schemes will be transferred to the Board of each FWUC.\nFWUCs will continue to play a valuable role in the management and maintenance of irrigation\nsystems after the completion of the Project.\n21. The  formation  of  a  FWUC  will  follow  a  step-by-step  participatory  and  democratic\nprocess.  A series of village-level forums and public meetings will be held to inform the farmers\nabout the aims and objectives of the rehabilitation and the policy of irrigation management\ntransfer and to solicit their input on the preliminary designs.  Affected farmers will be identified\nand the system beneficiaries will elect the FWUC Board.  Farmer organizers will work with the\nfarmers to organize and manage the system O&M and collect irrigation service fees.  The\nFWUC will set up a committee to draft a statute setting the rules for the system and register with\nthe Government. After ratification of the draft statute by the farmers and acceptance by the\nGovernment, the MOWRAM will provide a registration certificate to the FWUC committee, to\nprovide it with the legal status to the system.\n6.  Consulting Services\n22. International and domestic consultants are be required to assist and advise the PMO\nand PIUs. Considering the urgent nature of the Project and the need for rapid preparation and\nimplementation, ADB has approved advance action for engagement of consultants. Similarly,\ndirect selection of consultants has been approved on the conditions given in para. 10.\n23. Staffing inputs will include about 24 person-months of international and 110 person-\nmonths of domestic consultants with expertise in design, construction supervision, contract\nmanagement, and financial and economic assessment of flood control and irrigation works.\nFurther  support  in  project  administration  and  financial  management  will  be  provided  by\nconsultants already engaged under TA 3292 (footnote 3). The TA will also assist with overall\ndamage assessment and preparation of proposals for the two large-scale subprojects that are\nrequired  to  commence  urgently.  The  work  is  9uwithin  the  scope  of  the  capacity  building\nobjectives of the TA and the additional work can be handled with a short extension of existing\ninputs. Additional short inputs required are about one month each of two domestic consultants\nwith expertise in resettlement and environmental evaluation.\n24. The outline terms of reference for consulting services required under the Project are as\nfollows:\n(i)  Review the detailed criteria for the selection of subprojects for implementation\nand refine as necessary in consultation with MOWRAM and ADB.\n(ii)  Review current design practices, inter alia, by comparison with similar practices\nin other similar countries, and prepare simple design guidelines.\n(iii)  Assist  MOWRAM  to  address  environmental  and  social  aspects,  including\npreparation of resettlement plans where applicable.\n(iv)  Review the economic viability of typical irrigation and flood control schemes and\nevolve practical guidelines for adoption.\n(v)  Training MOWRAM staff in the design and economic guidelines.\n(vi)  Assist the PMO to review subproject proposals submitted by MOWRAM and the\nprovincial PIUs, and (if necessary) recommend appropriate modifications.\n(vii)  Review final designs of selected subprojects.\n(viii)  Assist MOWRAM to prepare tender and contract documents and evaluate bids,\nwith particular emphasis on the large-scale schemes.", "30\nAppendix 4, page 7\n(ix)  Advise  construction  supervisors  and  spot-check  the  quality  of  materials  and\nworks.\n(x)  Spot-check  quantities  and  monthly  payment  certificates.  For  the  large-scale\nsubprojects, counter-sign payments to contractors.\n(xi)  Ensure that any necessary resettlement plans are prepared and implemented.\n(xii)  Prepare  regular  reports  of  physical  and  financial  progress,  help  prepare\nwithdrawal applications from the loan, and prepare a project completion report.\nC.  Rural Infrastructure\n1.  Damage and Impact\na.  Damage\n25. The national rural road network comprises about 28,000 km. In recent years about 7,660\nkm, of which 2,640 km are laterite roads and 5,020 km earthfill roads of lower standard, have\nbeen rehabilitated under various externally financed projects. Of these rural roads 1,300 km of\nlaterite roads and 2,000 km of earthfill roads were flooded.  Of the flooded roads, about 740 km\nof laterite roads (57 percent) and most earthfill roads have been damaged to various degrees.\nAlso damaged were at least 45 bridges and 246 culverts, of which about 13 bridges and 74\nculverts have been completely destroyed. The total cost of repair work needed for laterite roads\nis estimated at $4.0 million (roads, $3.8 million; bridges, $0.1 million; and culverts, $0.1 million).\nRepair works have been prioritized with cost of top priority damage at $1.82 million; second\npriority at $1.28 million; and third priority at $0.9 million. The total damage to earth roads has\nbeen estimated at $8.5 million.\n26. Under the ongoing RIIP5, 440 km of roads with laterite surfacing have been constructed,\nof  which  about  10  km  have  been  completely  washed  out,  involving  repair  costs  of  about\n$50,000. Damage of various levels to numerous sections of laterite or unfinished earth roads\nwill involve repair costs of about $150,000. Damage of RIIP roads is relatively low because of\ntheir good technical standards with adequate cross drainage, compaction, and surfacing.\nb.  Impact\n27. Depending on the type of damage, transport of goods or travel is slowed to various\ndegrees or halted. Water transport has often been substituted for land transport, and adds\nsubstantially to transport time and cost.  As long as roads are under water, even by only few\ncentimeters, traffic must be stopped or the roads will be severely demaged. Interruption of bulk\ntransport of goods, which is widespread, and repackaging and transport of smaller volumes and\nfrequent transloading, have substantial costs. Prices of goods have increased as the cost of\nadditional transport and time are being added. Prices of essential commodities have sometimes\ndoubled due to the flood. The poor and micro-entrepreneurs are especially vulnerable to such\nincreases.\n28. When the water levels have dropped to at least 30 centimeter (cm) below their crest and\nthe surface has dried, traffic may be allowed, if urgently required. About 30 days after flood\nlevels have subsided, repair work can start.\n                                                          \n5  Loan 1385-CAM(SF): Rural Infrastructure Improvement Project approved on 28 September 1995 for $25.1 million.\nLoan closing date is 30 June 2002.", "31\nAppendix 4, page 8\n29. The development and impact of flooding results in three distinct levels of damage to rural\nroads. The first type results from a slow rise of water equally on both sides of a road, slowly\novertopping the road. This damages the upper laterite layer of the road, as compaction is\nweakened and aggregates are dislocated and washed out. If traffic is permitted to continue,\nsevere damage could result. If traffic is halted, as was the case in most locations, damage is\nlimited and repair involves resurfacing (4-5 cm) and compacting the upper laterite layer. The\ncost is estimated at about $2,500 per km on average. About 50 percent of damaged roads are\nestimated to involve this type of damage.\n30. The second type of damage occurs when elevated road sections with inadequate cross\ndrainage  block  water  flows  so  that,  after  the  water  reaches  the  road\u2019s  crest,  cross  flows\ntransport materials and severely erodes one side of the road and weakens the road foundation.\nRepair will require digging up the road section and repairing the road bed. The average cost will\nbe $6,250 per km (50 percent of initial construction). About 30 percent of damaged roads are\nestimated to involve this type of damage.\n31. The third type of damage will result from flash floods and extensive hydraulic erosion,\nleading to a total loss of road sections. These sections have to be fully rebuilt. About 20 percent\nof damaged roads are estimated to involve this type of damage.\n32. Roads  build  to  standards  lower  than  those  used  under  the  RIIP,  specifically\nuncompacted  earth  roads,  have  been  much  more  severe.  Inadequate  compaction  during\nconstruction and cross drainage make this type of roads much more vulnerable to being washed\nout. In a few areas, improper cross drainage has increased damage to crops and to other\ninfrastructure and adjoining roads.\n2.  Objectives and Scope\n33. The main objective of part C is to assist Cambodia to repair and restore damaged rural\ninfrastructure including rural laterite and earth roads and critical infrastructure6 built under the\nADB-financed RIIP, and other projects. To achieve this objective, the capacity of government\noffices and private contractors will have to be enhanced in 10 provinces in line with the proven\napproach used under the ongoing RIIP. Part C will use the existing capacity of the RIIP. Phase I\nof the emergency assistance and the TA requirements will be financed under the ongoing RIIP.\nLabor for the repair of financed by earth roads will be World Food Programme (WFP) parallel\ncofinancing.\n34. The work will include rehabilitation of (i) damaged stretches along about 600 km of\nlaterite roads, (ii) about 300-500 km of earth roads, (iii) 40 bridges, and (iv) about 300 culverts.\nThe assistance will be provided in three phases. The immediate emergency assistance will be\nprovided from 15 December for three months. The second phase will be the succeeding three\nmonths up to the next monsoon. The third phase will cover the second half of 2001 until\nphysical completion of the Project by June 2003. Assistance will include purchase of equipment\nfor about three provinces where force account procedures will be used. Part C will include\nfinancing of maintenance of completed subprojects during the second and third year.\n3. Description\n                                                          \n6 Assistance under the Project will focus mainly on repair of damages of critical infrastructure built under the RIIP\nsuch as markets, and public buildings etc.", "32\nAppendix 4, page 9\n35. Under part C, a significant portion of Cambodia\u2019s damaged laterite road network will be\nrestored to the preflood situation. In addition, part C will support the rehabilitation of critical and\nlarger damaged sections of earth roads (extending beyond 25 km on average) that had been\nconstructed under WFP\u2019s  Food for Work Program with a total length of about 300-500 km. Part\nC will usually not include operations in communes where other agencies are expected to\noperate (e.g., in Kampong Chan, Kampong Thom, and Prey Veng), except where roads extend\nbeyond commune boundaries.\n36. In line with procedures and standards developed under the RIIP, the roads will be\nrehabilitated  using  labor-intensive  methods,  with  a  focus  on  employing  the  disadvantaged\npopulation  of  the  area.  Such  people  will  be  employed  on  a  priority  basis  and  trained  in\nconstruction techniques. Labor-intensive construction of laterite-surfaced roads has proven cost\neffective and to produce roads that are easy to maintain and durable in Cambodia. Part C\u2019s area\nwill include 15 of the 16 provinces that have a significant laterite road network.\n37. Together with the WFP, financing will be provided for the rehabilitation of a substantial\nlength of earth roads. These roads had been previously rehabilitated under WFP\u2019s regular food-\nfor-work program. The partnership between ADB and WFP will enable the rehabilitation of these\nearth roads to a higher standard (mainly compacting), so that they become more flood resistant.\nThe co-financing from WFP will be providing temporary local employment for the poor, prior to\nthem being able to return to their normal livelihoods.\n3.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n38. The total cost of part C is estimated at $12.5 million equivalent, of which 18 percent\n($2.2 million) will be foreign exchange costs, and 82 percent ($10.3 million equivalent) is local\ncurrency costs. The local currency costs include $1.3 million in taxes and duties. Civil works will\ncost $10.5 million, and the balance of $2.0 million is for consultant services (about $0.7 million)\nand other support. ADB will finance all of the foreign exchange costs amounting to $2.2 million\nand local costs amounting to $6.5 million equivalent, or a total of $8.7 million equivalent. WFP\nwill contribute food aid amounting to $2.0 million equivalent, or 16 percent of the costs. The\nGovernment will contribute $1.8 million in taxes and duties. Consulting services will cover\nsurveys, designs, and civil works supervision. The cost will include remuneration and other\nexpenses;  take  into  consideration  the  duration  of  such  services;  and  provide  for  office\nequipment, office supplies, and vehicle operation.\n4.  Implementation Arrangements\na.  General Scope\n39.  Part  C  will  be  implemented  by  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  (MRD)  and  its\nprovincial  offices  (the  directorates  of  rural  development  [DRDs])  over  a  three-year  period.\nProvincial rural development committees (PRDCs) will help mobilize local communities and\nlabor.  MRD  will  plan,  finance,  and  monitor  the  progress  of  subprojects.  The  staff  of  the\nprovincial DRDs will supervise the subprojects. Local labor gangs hired under force account\nprocedure or local contractors will implement the work.\n40.  Rehabilitation work of the first phase have been identified and scheduled. Rehabilitation\nwork under the second and third phases will be implemented under a sector approach. Under\nthis approach individual rehabilitation packages will be considered and prioritized as separate", "33\nAppendix 4, page 10\nsubprojects. Such subprojects will be selected either by a provincial line agency or a group of\nbeneficiaries through the village development committees or district development committees\nand  proposed  to  the  PRDC  of  the  province  concerned.  The  PRDC  will  then  assess  the\nsubprojects,  with  the  assistance  of  provincial  DRD  staff  and  consultants  according  to  set\nselection criteria.  The subproject proposals will then be submitted to MRD for possible inclusion\nin part C. Simple costing and feasibility studies will be prepared and, if considered viable, funds\nwill be provided to the PIU of the provincial government.\n41.  MRD will assume supervisory and monitoring capacity to ensure that implementation\nschedules are followed and special concerns such as beneficiary involvement, environmental\nmitigation and appropriate criteria for participant selection for user training are being taken into\naccount. MRD will also monitor the O&M of the structures provided under the subprojects, after\ncompletion. The actual physical design and implementation of the subprojects will be by the\nprovincial DRDs, with funds being supplied on an imprest basis and liquidated subsequently. In\nprovinces that were not involved under the RIIP, special road sections will be selected to be\nrehabilitated  for  demonstration  purposes.  These  will  be  intensively  supervised  by  the\nconsultants to provide hands-on training to government personnel, private contractors, and\nparticipating communities.\nb.  Project Management and Coordination Arrangements\n42.  Part C will be implemented under the same implementation arrangements developed for\nthe RIIP. The project director of the RIIP will be responsible for implementing part C under the\nguidance  of  MRD\u2019s  project  coordinator.  The  facilities  and  staff  of  MRD\u2019s  PMO  at  MRD\u2019s\nheadquarters at Phnom Penh will be used and expanded as required. At the provincial level, the\nexisting RIIP PIUs will be used. These were set up at the provincial DRD headquarters in each\nprovince, headed by provincial projects managers.\n43.  Subproject work at the provincial level will be coordinated directly between the provincial\nproject managers and the provincial DRDs. These are already established and consist of all\nprovincial government agencies, chaired by the governor with the director of rural development\nas  the  vice  chairman.  The  Government  has  agreed  that,  in  the  provinces  involved  in  the\nrehabilitation  effort,  provincial  project  managers  and  engineers,  and  technical  staff  will  be\nappointed on a timely basis. These staff will undergo training beginning at least three months\nbefore their full-time involvement in the construction works in their province.  At the national\nlevel, part C will be implemented under the general coordination of the PCC and PCMU. MRD\nwill  regularly  inform  PMCU  of  all  subprojects  to  enable  appropriate  funding  coordination.\nSubprojects costing more than $250,000 will be forwarded to the PMCU for endorsement and to\nADB for approval.\n44. Because of time constraints, coordination arrangements with WFP will be developed\nduring implementation. Coordination mechanisms for the second phase (rehabilitation of about\n50 km of earth roads) will be spelled out in letters of understanding that will be issued by WFP\nand the Government at the latest, by the end of January 2001.  Details for the cooperation\nduring the third phase will be agreed upon at the latest during the joint review meeting that will\nbe scheduled toward the end of the second phase of part C.\nc.  Participatory Process\n45. Intended beneficiaries will be involved in selecting, constructing, and maintaining the\nphysical  works.  Staff  of  the  provincial  DRD  will  inform  district  officials  and  villages  about", "34\nAppendix 4, page 11\nactivities in their areas and solicit their support. Intended beneficiaries will be hired for skilled\nand unskilled labor during the implementation of the subprojects.\nd.  Operation and Maintenance\n46.  Under  the  RIIP  and  earlier  under  projects  implemented  by  the  International  Labor\nOrganization  (ILO),  implementation  arrangements  and  procedures  for  routine  and  periodic\nmaintenance have been developed.7 These mechanisms are fully operational, but formally\naccepted policy guidelines and a legal framework to support these still need to be developed.\nSpecifically the sourcing and assurance of adequate funding is yet to be clarified. Suggestions\nhave been made to address this problem through such revenue-generating measures as a local\ntax on vehicle registration or sale of the fuel, or a toll on the rehabilitated road. The objective of\nresolving this issue is included under the scope of the RIIP, and resolution has been initiated.\n47.  The O&M arrangements involve small-scale contract system in which the beneficiaries\nwho participated in the construction of the road are trained and paid to maintain a section of\nroad of about 10-15 km.  Materials, tools, and wages are provided under the RIIP.  The system\nis cost-effective (about $280/year/km) and has demonstrated satisfactory results.  After three\nyears of operation, and despite heavy traffic volumes, which have often exceeded original\nestimations, the roads remain in satisfactory condition.\n48.  During the implementation period, the Project will adopt the proven method for routine\nmaintenance  of  part  C  subprojects  and  will  finance  maintenance  costs  directly  to  ensure\nmaintenance until an appropriate system is established with support under the ongoing RIIP.\ne.  Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n49.  The progress and impact of subprojects will be monitored and evaluated by the unit\nestablished  at  MRD  under  the  RIIP.  The  staff  of  about  five  professional  level  people  will\nundertake/verify (i) surveys prior to the commencement of selected subprojects following an\napproved  format,  (ii)  periodic  reviews  during  subproject  implementation,  and  (iii)  a  final\nevaluation at the end of part C. Parameters to be measured will include adequacy of repairs and\nacceptance by the local population.\nf.  Special Progress Reviews\n50.  The first review will take place at the end of the first phase, by about 15 March 2001. To\nidentify any major constraints to implementation and reassess the capacity of staff at the\nprovincial level, a joint meeting of the Government, ADB, WFP, and the consultant will be held\nat that time. The meeting will decide on the need to review the second phase implementation\narrangements or scope.\n51.  A second review, including a similar joint meeting (para. 49), will be held at the end of\nthe second phase of part C, by about 15 June 2001, again to ensure that the scope and\nimplementation arrangement for the third phase of part C are adequate. In the joint meeting\nselection criteria and selected areas for the involvement of WFP will be refined and finalized.\nThis will also form the basis of the formal memorandum of understanding that will be prepared\n                                                          \n7  Routine maintenance is considered low-cost maintenance, which must be done on a regular basis to ensure\ncontinued long-term operation of rehabilitated roads.  Periodic maintenance, by contrast, involves major works and\nis normally undertaken once every three to five years.", "35\nAppendix 4, page 12\nthe cooperating parties at that time. The meeting will (i) monitor progress of part C, (ii) diagnose\nof implementation problems, and (iii) determine the extent of further assistance needed from the\nconsulting team by MRD to successfully complete the Project.\ng.  Environmental Aspects\n52.  Rehabilitation  of  roads  will  generally  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  environment.\nNevertheless negative impacts need to be considered in detailed designs, including effects\nduring floods of inadequate culverts and unintended ponding of borrow pits. To protect against\nthese impacts, adequate cross drainage of roads and borrow pits needs to be ensured, and\nmonitored.\n5.  Consultants Services and Training\n53.  Part C includes the services of consultants to help MRD with its implementation and\ncapacity building. About 35 person-months of international consultants will be needed. The\nconsultants will have the following expertise and roles: (i) management and supervision of\ninternationally financed projects, to serve as overall coordinator of part C, assisting MOP; (ii)\nmanagement of the rural infrastructure rehabilitation component with experience concerning\nlabor-intensive construction of rural roads; the consultant will assist in the rehabilitation effort on\na  part-time  basis  while  continuing  to  supervise  the  ongoing  RIIP;  and  (iii)  training  in  the\nplanning, quality control, construction, and maintenance of civil works, addressing Government\nand  WFP  staff,  community  workers,  and  core  staff  of  local  contractors;  (iv)  road  network\nanalysis and planning; and (v) project financial control and accounting. Domestic consultant\ninput will be about 108 person-months involving six people to assist implementation in six\nprovinces. All consultants will be financed under the RIIP project.\nD.  Education\n1.  Damage and Impact\na.  Damage\n54. The adverse impact of the flooding on the education system, including students and\nteachers,  is  only  just  becoming  evident.  The  overall  damage  to  the  education  system  is\nestimated at about $15 million but this is only preliminary figure. The Planning Department\nwithin the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (MOEYS) has drawn upon a number of\nsources  for  preparing  an  emergency  rehabilitation  plan,  including  updates  from  National\nSecretariat for Disaster Management and consultations with United Nations (UN) agencies. In\naddition,  MOEYS  has  obtained  field  reports  from  provincial  directors  of  education  and\nundertaken site visits to provinces. The rehabilitation plan is based on an analysis of the near\nterm impact on the school system, with an assessment of the longer term rehabilitation needs.\nDetailed and reliable field information on the severity and coverage of flooding is still being\nassembled as floodwaters recede. At least 1,000 schools in 13 provinces are severely affected\nby the recent floods. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) estimates this figure\nto be around 2,000 schools, which constitute roughly half of the school system.\nb.  Impact\n55. Based on census and geographic information system data, MOEYS estimates that the\nflooding has affected 1.9 million people or 21 percent of the population. The worse hit provinces\nare reported to be Kratie (62 percent of population affected), Kandal (40 percent), Prey Veng", "36\nAppendix 4, page 13\n(36 percent), Kampong Cham (34 percent) and Kampong Chhnang (29 percent). Many of the\nworst hit provinces during the 1996 flooding (e.g., Ratanakiri and Stung Treng) are not featured.\nFurther,  MOEYS  estimates\u2019  maybe  conservative.  For  example,  the  UN  estimates  that  40\npercent of the population maybe affected, e.g., that 3.8 million to 4 million people may have their\nlives and livelihoods disrupted by flooding. Furthermore, severe rains in early October 2000\nhave exacerbated the scale and coverage of flood impact on the education system.\n56. Factors  that  could  prevent  students  and  teachers  from  attending  school  include  (i)\ndamage to access roads, (ii) the need to restore family property, (iii) food shortages and\ndamage to water supply, and (iv) increased incidences of water-borne diseases. Furthermore,\nthe  floods  could  adversely  impact  the  effectiveness  of  external  support  for  education\ndevelopment. Hence, rehabilitation measures are urgently needed that will minimize the risk that\nexternal assistance will not have the desired effect on the education sector. Moreover, assuring\nhealthy pupils and teachers is another objective of the Government\u2019s rehabilitation plan. Given\nthat the school network has 5-6 times the coverage of the health clinics in the country, early\nrehabilitation of the school system will provide an opportunity to use the schools as the basis for\nflood-health  assistance  through  school  feeding,  micronutrient  supplement  schemes,  and\nantidiarreferral hospitaley initiatives.\n57. In early October 2000, MOEYS appealed to the UN for emergency assistance to mitigate\nthe effects of the flood currently affecting many areas of Cambodia. The UN has agreed to\nprovide  $150,0008  (to  be  confirmed)  for  temporary  shelters  for  schools,  United  Nations\nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) is providing $15,000 for field assessment of damage, WFP has\nagreed to provide food for rehabilitation works, and the Government of the Republic of Germany\nis providing $300,000 for temporary school shelters. The German assistance includes TA to\nestablish a disaster management unit the Department of State Assets and to assist MOP\u2019s\nplanning  function  for  education  facilities.  The  unit  will  be  used  for  any  future  disaster\nmanagement  and  will  be  the  point  of  contact  with  the  National  Secretariat  for  Disaster\nManagement.  The  unit  will  also  be  responsible  for  designing  an  overall  monitoring  and\nperformance assessment system of the flood assistance.\n58. Preliminary estimates are that between 0.3 million to 0.4 million primary school students\nare directly affected. If secondary school students are included, the figure is estimated at around\n0.5 million students. However, UN estimates indicate that the school population affected may be\nas high as 0.9 million to 1.0 million students. Including secondary schools, MOEYS estimates\nthat about 7,000 classrooms have been badly affected by flooding. Using MOEYS facilities\ninventory and cost database, the cost of primary school classroom repair will range between\n$2.6 million and $9.9 million. In addition, about 600 classrooms in 120 secondary schools are\nextensively  damaged.  The  indicative  cost  for  secondary  school  classroom  rehabilitation  or\nreplacement is about $1.0 million. Thus, the total cost of classroom repair/replacement will be\n$3.6 million to $10.9 million. Field assessments also indicate extensive damage to school\nfurniture, including blackboards. A large amount of school supplies and textbooks has been lost\nor damaged beyond repair. The estimated replacement cost of furniture and school supplies is\naround $3.7 million.\n                                                          \n8  This is to cover the emergency needs to procure plastic sheets, blackboards and benches for the temporary\nschools damaged but does not include and rehabilitation costs.", "37\nAppendix 4, page 14\n2.  Objectives and Scope\n59. The main objective of part D is to assist MOEYS to rehabilitate damaged primary and\nsecondary schools built under the ADB-financed the Special Rehabilitation Assistance Project\n(footnote 4), Rural Infrastructure Improvement Project (footnote 5), and other projects. The\nMOEYS plan is to ensure that the maximum benefit is derived from this emergency school\nrehabilitation assistance in the coming months. To achieve this objective, MOEYS recognizes\nthe need to identify absolute priorities for repairing schools. The scope of work will include the\nrehabilitation of (i) 105 classrooms in 24 urban primary schools, (ii) 952 classrooms in 206 rural\nprimary schools, and (iii) 321 classrooms in 102 remote primary schools. In addition, 211\nclassrooms in 35 secondary schools will be rehabilitated and furniture procured for them.\n60. The aim is to institute a planning mechanism to update the impact of flooding on the\nschool system and to restore the operation of primary and secondary school system quickly. At\nthe  recently  concluded  National  Meeting  on  Education,  questionnaires  to  assess  damage\ncaused by the flooding at provincial, district, and village levels were distributed to all provincial\nheads. A meeting of provincial school heads is scheduled for in mid-November 2000 to discuss\nthe questionnaire. All questionnaires are to be submitted to MOEYS by 15 December 2000, and\nbased on the findings of these questionnaires, MOEYS will be in a better position to revise the\ncost estimates.\n3.  Description\n61. The part D rehabilitation program will be restricted to rehabilitation of permanent and\ntemporary school buildings and furniture damaged by the floods, focusing on reestablishment of\nthese structures. Temporary schools are those that have been in used for normal teaching but\nwere not constructed as permanent structures due to lack of funds. Most of such primary\nschools have been completely washed out, with wooden structures badly damaged by being\nunder water for a long period. In such instances, primary school structures will be completely\nreplaced with concrete buildings with zinc roofing. In other cases, where the damage is not too\nextensive, assistance will focus on rehabilitation. The exact works required will be determined\nby the field assessment and site appraisal. Works will include selective installation of new\ncement  floors,  erection  of  walls,  and  repair  of  doors  and  windows.  Site  clearance  and\nrestoration  will  be  included.  Damaged  furniture  and  blackboards  will  be  replaced  where\nnecessary.\n4.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n62. The total cost of part D is estimated at $6.7 million equivalent, of which 24 percent ($1.6\nmillion) will be the foreign exchange cost, and 76 percent ($5.1 million equivalent) the local\ncurrency cost. The local currency cost includes $0.9 million in taxes and duties. Civil works will\ncost $4.9 million, and the balance of $1.8 million is for consultants services ($1.0 million) and\nother equipment and materials. ADB will finance all of the foreign exchange costs amounting to\n$1.6 million and local cost financing $4.2 million equivalent, or a total of $5.8 million equivalent.\nThe Government will contribute $0.9 million in taxes and duties.", "38\nAppendix 4, page 15\n5.  Implementation Arrangements\na.  General Scope\n63. An important concern will be the capacity to coordinate aid programming for school\nrehabilitation work ongoing education facilities and construction work already scheduled in\naddition to this emergency rehabilitation. Since the implementation of the Special Rehabilitation\nAssistance Project (footnote 4), a great deal of capacity has been built within MOEYS, and its\nstaff are able to plan, manage, and coordinate major construction work. In addition, other\nagencies (e.g., United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization [UNESCO],\nUNICEF and the European Union) have provided capacity building support that has built a\nstrong capacity within MOEYS\u2019 Planning Department to process and analyze information related\nto the education system and related aid projects.  An ongoing European Commission project is\nworking to support the planning and materials and state properties departments to establish\npolicy, plan education facilities development, and manage school rehabilitation and education\nsystem expansion.\n64. MOEYS will be the IA for the education component. MOEYS will implement part D over\na three-year period. PIU will be in the Department of State Assets, School Construction Office.\nThe day-to-day project management will be the responsibility of two MOEYS project codirectors\n(one responsible for technical issues and the other for financial matters). They will be located in\nthe Department of State Assets. An international consultant (team leader) will assist them with\nsupport from a team of domestic technicians, an accountant, and a draftsman-architect. MOEYS\nhas confirmed the availability of the counterpart support staff and office space for the PIU. The\noperations will be coordinated by the director of the Department of State Assets, who will ensure\nthat part D is dovetailed with other ongoing school building programs, to avoid duplication and\nensure consistency in approach, standardized school building designs, and costs. The terms of\nreference (TOR) for the PMU are given in Appendix 5.\n65. MOEYS will establish a steering committee, chaired by a designated secretary of state.\nThe steering committee members will include representatives from departments of state assets,\nfinance, planning, administration, and primary and secondary education. The director general of\ngeneral  education  will  be  the  secretary.  The  MOEYS  steering  committee  will  include\nrepresentatives  from  the  Ministry  of  Planning,  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance,  and\nNational  Secretariat  for  Disaster  Management  to  ensure  effective  communication  with  the\nbroader  project  co-ordination  committee  (PCC)  located  in  the  Ministry  of  Planning  (MOP).\nMOEYS will organize quarterly meeting with the PCC to review the quarterly progress reports of\nthe education component.\nb.  Consultant Services\n66. Part D includes the services of consultants to help MOEYS in implementation and\ncapacity building. The international consultant services will amount to 36 person-months, and\nthe consultant will have the following expertise and duties: (i) management and supervision of\ninternationally financed projects, to serve as overall coordinator of part D; (ii) management of\nprimary and secondary school infrastructure construction through both local competitive bidding\n(LCB) and community-based rural and remote school rehabilitation; and (iii) project financial\ncontrol and accounting. Domestic consultant input will entail about 320 person-months involving\n25 people to assist implementation in 13 provinces. Because of the urgency of the consultancy\nservices, the international consultant will be directly selected. MOEYS has agreed to provide\nADB with the names of four short-listed experts for consideration.", "39\nAppendix 4, page 16\nc.  Field Monitoring and Impact Assessment\n67. The PIU will design and implement a broad field monitoring and impact assessment\nsystem.  The  provincial  and  district  education  offices  will  be  trained  in  monitoring.  These\nauthorities  will  be  required  to  provide  quarterly  reports  to  the  PIU.  Short-term  impact\nassessment  will  include  analysis  of  restored  enrolment  levels,  and  teacher  and  pupil\nattendance. This will include disaggregation of data between urban and rural areas to give some\nindication of the poverty impact of the rehabilitation. The PIU will commission occasional impact\nstudies as part of a final impact assessment at the end of the program in 2003. These studies\nwill investigate the relationship between food security, public health, and rural access roads and\nthe  school  rehabilitation  activities.  MOEYS\u2019  steering  committee  will  manage  the  impact\nassessment.\nd.  Benefit Monitoring\n68. The major beneficiaries of the program will be the less well-off in both rural and urban\nareas where most of the damaged schools are located. Monitoring will examine the number of\nstudents, parents, and communities who have benefited from the program. Monitoring will also\nlook at how quickly students\u2019 attendance and progression rates have been restored. Sample\nstudies of student and teacher performance as part of quality monitoring in the targeted areas\nwill be undertaken.\n69. Another potential benefit is income generation through the construction and furniture\nprogram.  Sample  studies  in  selected  communities  will  look  at  these  income  benefits  on\ncommunities and families, as part of restoring rural livelihoods. The restoration of the school\nsystem will release parents for agricultural and other income earning activities, which will be\nassessed as part of the broader rural livelihoods rehabilitation. The installation of flood-proof\nstructures is considered as an additional benefit. This could reduce the damage by flooding in\nthe future and provide housing for communities in future floods. Cost benefits of these new\ndesigns will be assessed with MOEYS\u2019 the improved capacity to plan and manage disasters in\nthe future.\ne.  Implementation Progress Reviews\n70. Joint progress reviews by the Government-MOEYS and ADB will take place every six\nmonths beginning in June 2001. The reviews will include assessment of progress reports,\nidentification of any implementation constraints, and field visits, coordinated by the MOEYS\nsteering committee. The reviews will also provide the opportunity to review and update work\nplans and the overall implementation strategy.\nf.  Environmental and Social Assessment\n71. The environmental impact assessment indicates (i) that the overall impact of part D\nshould be strongly positive, and (ii) no negative effects. The introduction of flood proof building\nstructures is an example of positive and sustainable environmental effect.\ng.  Participation\n72. The technical and financial planning and management procedures are designed to build\non the strong tradition in Cambodia of community involvement in the design and construction of", "40\nAppendix 4, page 17\nschool buildings. School parent committee and construction management committees already\nexist. The program design, especially for technical planning and financial disbursements, will\nextensively use these community groups at every stage of the program cycle. The community\nparticipation will ensure community leadership and ownership of the activities and contribute to\nassuring that communities will undertake future maintenance of buildings provided.\nE.  Health\n1.  Damage and Impact\n73. The Government\u2019s preliminary assessments indicate that some of health centers and\nreferral hospitals in the flooded provinces have been damaged. Data on the actual number of\nfacilities affected are limited; however, information from the provinces indicates that about 167\nhealth centers in 16 provinces have been damaged. This estimate is based on the location of\nthe health centers in the flooded areas. About 68 damaged health centers were previously\nfinanced by ADB. Flood damage is severely affecting the operation of health facilities. However,\ndamage to the facilities includes structural damage; and damaged and stained floor tiles, walls,\ndoors, fences, latrines, wells, hand pumps and other facilities (paths, gates, incinerators, needle\ndisposal points, etc.). Where the damage is extensive, health services have been severely\naffected  and  rural  populations  are  experiencing  more  health  problems  due  to  the  floods.\nTherefore, the facilities must be restored to full operation as quickly as possible to overcome the\nincreasing problems.\n74. In 1995, the Council for the Development of Cambodia established the National Disaster\nCommittee. Each ministry was required to form a disaster committee to deal with sector-specific\nemergencies. The disaster committee of the Ministry of Health is under the Department of\nPreventive Medicine. Since the onset of flooding, this committee has been obtaining reports on\nflood related damage to health facilities from the 16 provinces. Although limited information is\navailable on the extent of the flood damage in Banteay Meanchey, Kampong Speu, Kampong\nThom, Pursat, and Siem Reap provinces, these areas are inundated, the water is receding\nslowly, and the number of health centers in those areas likely to have been damaged has been\nestimated. To confirm the estimates, the Ministry of Health (MOH) is sending questionnaires to\nall operational district chiefs. By end of December 2000, MOH will have a good picture on the\nextent of the damage and the number of health centers affected, and the cost will be revised\naccordingly. Repairs need to be undertaken quickly so that health centers can resume providing\nessential health care to the rural population.\n2.  Objectives and Scope\n75. Part E will rehabilitate health centers and referral hospitals damaged by the floods,\nspecifically facilities under the ongoing ADB loan.9 By rehabilitating the damaged health facilities\nin the 16 provinces, part E will enable the rural population in the affected areas to access to\nbasic health services.\n76. The scope of work under part E will include mainly civil works to rehabilitate the health\ncenters and referral hospitals facilities, including their wells and latrines. Damaged furniture and\nhospitals beds will be replaced. Part E will provide domestic consultant services to verify the\ndamage and costs of civil works contracts and to supervise construction.\n                                                          \n9 Loan 1447-CAM (SF): Basic Health Services Project, for $20 million, approved in June 1996.", "41\nAppendix 4, page 18\n3.  Description\n77. The  rehabilitation  work  will  be  restricted  rehabilitation  of  health  center  and  referral\nhospital buildings, furniture, beds, wells, and latrines. Some health center and referral hospital\nbuildings have been destroyed and others have only suffered minor damage. Destroyed health\ncenters and referral hospitals will be completely replaced with new concrete buildings. Where\nthe damage is not extensive, assistance will focus on rehabilitation. The exact work required will\nbe determined by the field assessment and site appraisal. Work will include selective installation\nof  new  or  repaired  cement  floors,  walls,  roof,  doors,  and  windows.  Site  clearance  and\nrestoration will also be included. Damaged furniture and beds will be replaced where necessary,\nincluding the sanitation facilities.\n4.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n78. The total cost of part E is estimated at $1.5 million equivalent, of which 27 percent ($0.4\nmillion equivalent) will be foreign exchange costs and 73 percent ($1.1 million equivalent) local\ncurrency costs. The local currency costs include $0.2 million in taxes and duties. Civil works will\ncost $1.3 million, and $0.2 million is for consultant services and $0.1 million for equipment and\nmaterials.  ADB  will  finance  all  of  the  foreign  exchange  costs  amounting  to  $0.4  million\nequivalent and local cost financing amounting to $0.9 million equivalent, or a total of $1.3 million\nequivalent. The Government will contribute $0.2 million in taxes and duties.\n5.  Implementation Arrangements\na.  General Scope\n79. An important concern will be the capacity to coordinate aid programming for school\nrehabilitation works and ongoing health services and construction work already scheduled in\naddition to this emergency rehabilitation. Since the implementation of the ADB-financed Basic\nHealth Services Project (BHSP, footnote 9), a great deal of capacity has been built within MOH\nand its staff are able to plan, manage and coordinate major construction works. In addition,\nother agencies (World Bank, World Health Organization, and nongovernment organizations )\nhave provided further capacity building support, which has built strong capacity within MOH.\n80. MOH will be the IA for part E. MOH will implement part E over a six-month period.\nArrangements under MOH\u2019s project coordination unit (PCU) for the successful implementation\nof the BHSP are proposed for implementation. The PCU is fully familiar with and experienced in\nthe use of ADB procurement, accounting, and reporting procedures. One additional full-time\ninternational consultant with qualifications and relevant experience in the implementation of civil\nworks will be recruited to help the PCU implement part E.\n81. MOH has proposed that the project director for the BHSP will head part E and that the\nadministrative  structure  and  arrangement  of  the  PCU  will  be  adapted  to  implement  the\nassistance. The engineering supervisory firm that has been employed to manage the civil works\ncomponent of the BHSP will be employed through direct negotiation to provide the required\nconsultancy services. This firm has been employed since August 1997 by the PCU and has\nprovided very satisfactory results for similar civil works.\n82. MOH will establish a steering committee, chaired by a designated secretary of state to\noversee  the  implementation  of  part  E.  The  steering  committee  members  will  include\nrepresentatives from the MOP, Ministry of Economy and Finance, and National Secretariat for", "42\nAppendix 4, page 19\nDisaster Management. The PCU project director will sit on the steering committee and will have\noverall responsibility for implementing part E. The objectives of the PCU are to (i) ensure timely,\nefficient, and effective implementation of part E and the BHSP; and (ii) build capacity within\nMOH for project administration, financial management, and procurement. The functions of the\nPCU will include (I) implementing policy decisions and guidelines of the steering committee, (ii)\nensuring proper record-keeping of activities, (iii) ensuring timely procurement of goods and\nservices under the Project, (iv) supervising monitoring and evaluation activities, (v) accounting\nfor funds of part E, (vi) tracking implementation and remedying any delays, and (vii) assisting in\neffective coordination with the projects of other funding agencies.\nb.  Consultant Services\n83. The  Project  includes  the  services  of  consultants  to  help  with  implementation  and\ncapacity building. The consultant services will amount to 6 person-months of an international\nconsultant  with  the  following  expertise  and  roles:  (i)  management  and  supervision  of\ninternationally financed projects, to serve as overall coordinator of part E; (ii) management of\nhealth centers construction through both LCB and community-based rehabilitation; and (iii)\nfinancial control and accounting. Domestic consultant\u2019s input will be about 36 person-months\ninvolving six persons to assist (i) implementation in 16 provinces, and (ii) in the preparation of\ncontract  documents,  surveys,  and  supervision.  In  addition,  a  finance  administrator  and  a\ndraftsman will be recruited locally. Because of the urgency of the consultancy services, the\ninternational consultant will be directly. MOH has agreed to provide ADB with the names of four\nexperts for consideration.\nc.  Field Monitoring and Impact Assessment\n84. The PCU will design and implement a broad field monitoring and impact assessment\nsystem. The district health chiefs will be trained in monitoring and will be required to provide\nquarterly reports to the PCU. The short-term impact assessment will include analysis of restored\nhealth service levels, and increase in consultations. This will include disaggregation of data\nbetween  urban  and  rural  areas  to  give  some  indication  of  the  poverty  impact  of  the\nrehabilitation.  The study will determine at the relationship between food security, public health,\nand rural access roads on the flooded health facilities rehabilitation program.\nd.  Benefit Monitoring\n85. The major beneficiaries of part E will be the less well off in both rural and urban areas\nwhere most of the damaged health centers are located. Monitoring will examine the number of\nthe communities who have benefited from the program, how quickly health services were\nresumed,  and  how  this  has  helped  contain  out-breaks  of  water-borne  diseases.  Another\npotential benefit is income generation through the construction. Sample studies in selected\ncommunities will look at these income benefits on communities and families, as part of restoring\nrural livelihoods. The restoration of health services will also enable healthy communities to\nreturn quickly to agriculture and other income earning activities. This will be assessed as part of\nthe broader rural livelihoods rehabilitation. The improved capacity of MOH to plan and manage\nsuch disasters in the future will also be assessed.\ne.  Implementation Progress Reviews\n86. The  Government-MOH  and  ADB  will  jointly  review  progress  at  the  end  of  part  E,\nscheduled  for  30  June  2001.  The  review  will  include  assessment  of  progress  reports,", "43\nAppendix 4, page 20\nidentification of any implementation constraints, and effectiveness of the work plans and overall\nimplementation strategy. The review will entail field visits and will be coordinated by MOH\u2019s\nsteering committee.\nf.  Environment\n87. Environmental impact assessment indicates that the overall impact should be strongly\npositive and not have negative effects.\ng.  Participation\n88. To the extent possible, depending on the availability of skills, the local community will be\nemployed  in  the  rehabilitation  works.  The  community  participation  will  ensure  community\nleadership and ownership of the activities and help assure that communities will maintain the\nfacilities provided.", "44\nAppendix 5, page 1\nTERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTING SERVICES FOR THE PMCU\nA.

Emergency Repairs of National Transport System\n1.  Introduction\n1. Part A of the Project is designed to implement repair and restoration works in two\nphases. Phase one involves emergency or immediately necessary repairs to the road sections,\nbridges, and railway facilities damaged by the year 2000 floods. The objective is to restore basic\naccess to the populations served by the facilities and to allow the flow of commerce and people\nthat has been disrupted by the floods. Generally the work will not be a permanent standard but\nwill be suitable for temporary purposes. Although floodwaters have not subsided completely in\nall areas or along all section of the roads or railways, much of the damage can be observed and\nthe extent identified. Some of these work had commenced at the time of appraisal while others\nare expected to start soon.\n2.  Extent of Damage\n2.

Implementation Arrangements\n3. Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) will be the Implementing Agency for part\nA  and overall control will be the responsibility of one of MPWT\u2019s secretaries of state. MPWT will\nappoint a senior engineer as a full-time project director, responsible for the day-to-day control of\nthe part A. For work (including consultant services) to be funded under ongoing loans, existing\norganizational arrangements will apply. For the ongoing projects the project management units\n(PMUs) are in place and are operating well.1 Additional staff will be needed within the units to\naugment staff to handle the additional work required under the loan as well as Royal Railways\nof Cambodia (RRC) staff.\n4.  Procurement\n4. All  goods  and  services  under  the  Project  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  the\nGuidelines for Procurement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Given the urgency of the\nProject, at the request of the Government, ADB approved advance procurement action with the\nunderstanding  that  such  action  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  any  part  of  the  Project.\nSimilarly, ADB has approved retroactive financing. To expedite procurement procedures, the\nGovernment requested and ADB agreed to adopt a two-envelope procedure for international\ncompetitive  bidding  (ICB)  and  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB)  procurement.  Procurement\nperiods will also be reduced to 21 days for LCB contracts and 60 days for ICB tenders.\n5. Following the procedures established under Loan 1697-CAM2, all civil works contracts\nfor the rehabilitation of roads and bridges, with a value of $2.5 million or more, will be awarded\non  the  basis  of  ICB  procedures.  For  suitable  contract  packages  under  $2.5  million,  LCB\nprocedures will be followed. The rationale is that ICB contractors will only be interested in the\nlarger  continuous  civil  works  contracts  while  the  local  contractors,  including  international\ncontractors already working in Cambodia, could be interested in contracts in scattered locations,\nsome  with  security  problems.  Force  accounts  will  also  be  allowed  particularly  for  small,\nscattered civil works where it is difficult to prepare logical contract packages mainly because of\nthe piecemeal nature of the civil works.\n6. Force account works will be undertaken on the basis of detailed technical specifications,\nbills of quantities, and schedules of rates, and will be supervised by the construction supervision\nconsultants. The groups responsible for each force account package will be required to provide\nschedule that requires the agreement of MPWT and the consultant. Payment for force account\nworks will be against agreed criteria for verification and acceptance of the works. This will\nensure accountability for the quality and cost of the works carried out.\n5.  Consulting Services\n7. International  and  domestic  consultants  and  MPWT  personnel  will  be  needed.\nConsidering the urgency of the Project and the need for rapid preparation and implementation,\nadvance action for the engagement of consultants has been approved by ADB. Similarly, direct\nselection of consultants for part A has been approved.

Two  joint  venture\nconsulting firms have been contracted under ongoing ADB-financed projects. These firms with\nappropriately amended contracts will be retained to assist MPWT with identifying and preparing\nsubprojects and supervising the emergency repairs and civil works construction and related\nactivities.\n6.  Environmental and Social Impacts\n8. Subproject criteria specify that repairs and rehabilitation work will be undertaken within\nthe existing alignments and will, therefore, be very unlikely to have any adverse environmental\nimpacts. Nevertheless, subproject preparation will include a initial environmental examination\nand an initial social assessment that will require ADB approval prior to the acceptance of the\nlarger  subprojects  ($250,000  or  more)  or  later  approval  for  the  smaller  ones  (less  than\n$250,000).\n7.  Estimated Cost and Schedule\n9. Emergency repairs are estimated to cost a total of $4.0 million. The repairs will be\nundertaken during the 2000-2001 dry season expected to occur from November 2000 to July\n2001.\nB.  Kop Srov Flood Protection Dike\n1.  Background and Description\n10. The city of Phnom Penh is protected by more than 40 kilometers (km) of flood dikes that\nsurround the city. A 7 km section known as the Kop Srov Dike on the northern side of the city\nwas at high risk of failure for about a month during the 2000 floods. The dike was initially built in\n1972-1973 and has two important functions: flood protection and as a road for heavy traffic to\nbypass the city.\n11. In 1996, under the management of Phnom Penh Municipality, a contract was let to a\nprivate contractor to raise and enlarge the dike. The work was done at the contractor\u2019s expense\nin  exchange  for  concession  rights  to  collect  fees  from  trucks  using  the  dike  road.  The\nimprovement consisted of dumping a layer of poor structural soil on top of the dike. The contract\nis now over, and PPM has resumed collecting fees. During the floods, it became obvious that\nthe standard of the upper layer was inadequate to provide safe flood protection of the city.\nDuring the flood, numerous seepage lines developed and the dike had to be placed under 24-\nhour surveillance to detect seepage points. Seepage through the embankment is particularly\ndangerous, as it could quickly lead to a breaching failure. Wave action was also a major\nconcern, causing extremely rapid erosion; fortunately it occurred for a day. Had it lasted longer,\nthe dike probably would have collapsed.\n12. In view of the importance of the dike for protecting Phnom Penh, it has been placed\nunder the responsibility of the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology (MOWRAM).\nMOWRAM undertook the emergency work need to prevent failure during the flood. A fleet of\nearth  moving  equipment  and  sandbags  were  used  to  undertake  temporary  emergency\nmeasures to prevent water from flowing over the dike, plug more than 70 seepage points, and\ncontrol severe erosion due to the wave action.", "49\nAppendix 6, page 4\n2.  Long-Term Plans\n13. MOWRAM has requested assistance from the Government of Japan for a major upgrade\nof the total Phnom Penh dike system. Since the dike is now is the main route for trucks\nbypassing  the  city,  the  road  will  be  enlarged  and  fully  asphalted.  Its  function  as  a  flood\nprotection dike will also be upgraded. The overall cost is estimated at $30 million. Japan has not\nyet made a firm commitment to fund the project. Even if the work proceeds, the feasibility study\nand design work typically take two years before construction can be started. The project is not\nexpected to commence earlier than 2002. Thus, the emergency repairs are needed to secure\nthe dike for at least the next two flood seasons.\n3.  Proposed Emergency Work\n14. MOWRAM has requested emergency assistance to strengthen a 7 km section of the\ndike and hence protect Phnom Penh. The emergency repairs include raising the height, placing\nan impervious clay blanket on the upstream side to safeguard against failure, and providing\nprotection against waves.\n15. The dike\u2019s current height varies from elevation 10.08 meters (m) to 10.88 in the critical\nsection from National Route 5 to the temple Wat Ang Krapeu. This compares with the peak\nwater level during the flood of 10.40 along the section. The width of the road is approximately 10\nmeters for the first 1.7 km from route 5, then narrows to approximately 8 until the temple.\nAlthough  the  initial  1.7  km  section  was  affected  by  during  the  flood,  it  was  satisfactorily\nprotected by sandbags and by vegetation cover on the upstream side that protected the section\nfrom wave action.\n16. The proposal for this section is to remove the 1996 soil (approximately 0.5 beneath the\ncrest of the road), trim it back to the original well-compacted core, and replace it with well-\ncompacted soil with better structural characteristics while raising the crest to 11.40 m. Further\nin, a compacted clay layer will be placed on the upstream slope and then both sides will be\ncovered with topsoil that will be grassed. Under the emergency repairs, the crest will be paved\nwith laterite for suitable for heavy truck traffic.\n17. The remaining section (approximately 5.2 km) is more critical because it sustained more\ndamage and was in the most danger of collapse. During the flood, layers of sandbags were\nplaced on the upstream slope and in some lower sections a single row of sandbags were placed\nto raise the level to just above 10.40. Much of the poor uppermost layer of soil was cracked.\n18. Waves estimated at 0.6 m flowed over sandbag layer in some sections. For this section,\nthe plan is again to remove the soil layer that was placed during the 1996 improvements, trim\nback to the original core, replace it with material of acceptable structural qualities, and raise the\ncrest to 11.40 m.  An impervious compacted clay layer will be placed on the stream side.  This\nwill be then covered with rock protected with a geotextile filter from the toe of the foundation up\n2.2 m.  Above that will be reinforced concrete slab with a concrete wall on top. The road section\nwill repaved with laterite.  The downstream slope will be formed of newly compacted soil with a\ngrassed layer on top to protect against erosion.\n4.  Preparation of Survey and Designs\n19. MOWRAM has done a complete survey of the dike and taken eight soil cores. Analysis\nrevealed that the core of the dike is sound. This is supported by observations during high water", "50\nAppendix 6, page 5\nlevels,  whereas  there  was  infiltration  through  the  core.    The  design  drawings  have  been\nprepared by MOWRAM and a typical section is shown in attached Figure A7.1. Consultants\nunder  TA  32923  will  review  the  designs  and  prepare  a  detailed  report  on  the  subproject\nproposal, which will be submitted to ADB for approval.\n5.  Cost Estimates\n20. The detailed cost estimates have been prepared by MOWRAM and amount to $3.7\nmillion. These will be reviewed during preparation of the report to be submitted to ADB.\n6.  Social and Environmental Issues\n21. The work will require relocation of about 40-50 illegally settled households that are\nimmediately adjacent to the one section of the dike. Compensation for some loss of agricultural\nland will also be required. MOWRAM will prepare a resettlement plan in accordance with\nGovernment procedures and acceptable to ADB. The Government has agreed to cover the\nassociated resettlement and compensation costs. An initial environmental examination of the\nsubproject will also be undertaken.\n                                                \n3  TA 3292-CAM: Capacity Building at the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology approved for $796,000 on\n10 November 1999."], "metadata": {"Author": "", "CreationDate": "D:20001216201149Z", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "ModDate": "D:20131111174213+08'00'", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Title": "Proposed Loan and Proposal to Use Loan Savings Emergency Flood Rehabilitation Project (Cambodia)"}}
