The  Project  will  support \nthe  development  of \nenvironmental  plans  and  a  waste  management  plan  for  each \nhospital. \n \nThe Project will support eight provinces in the south central coast \nregion  (SCCR)  to  improve  the  provincial  health  systems.  The \nProject will finance a slice of each provincial health plan, focusing \non  district  hospitals  and  human  resource  development,  while  the \ncentral Government is committed to provide complementary funds \nfor  primary  health  care.  Guided  by  the  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH), \neach province was assisted to conduct provincial health accounts \nand  prepare  a  5-year  plan  and  medium-term  expenditure \nframework. These will serve as the basis for a comprehensive and \nresults-based  development  approach  and  for  prioritizing  and \ncoordinating investments among development partners.  \n \nThrough  a  participatory  planning  process,  four  outputs  were \nidentified: \nincluding  standard \nequipment  and  waste  management,  with  a  focus  on  district \nhospitals;  (ii)  strengthened  provincial  human  resources  through \nimproved  human  resource  development  planning  and  training \ncapacity,  in  addition  to  skills  training  at  all  levels;  (iii)  improved \naccess to health care, in particular for poor, remote ethnic minority \ncommunes;  and  (iv)  strengthened  management  of  provincial \nhealth systems, including hospitals.   \n \n\nimproved  health \n\nfacilities, \n\n(i) \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \n\n \n\n\fViet  Nam  has  experienced  strong  economic  growth,  with  real \ngross  domestic  product  expanding  at  7.8%  in  2002\u20132006  and \n8.5%  in  2007.  From  1993  to  2007,  poverty  levels  in  Viet  Nam \ndropped  from  over  58%  to  19.5%  and  per  capita  income  more \nthan  doubled.  Urban  areas  have  benefited  more\u2014in  2004,  the \nincidence of urban poverty was 13.7% compared to 26.4% in rural \nareas. In recent years, however, growth of aggregate demand has \noutpaced  that  of  aggregate  supply.  The  Government  has  shifted \nits  policy  priorities  from  maintaining  high  rates  of  investment  and \noutput  growth  to  curbing  inflation,  reducing  the  trade  and  current \naccount deficits, ensuring stable supply of basic food products to \ndomestic  markets,  and  enhancing  social  assistance  to  poor  and \nvulnerable segments of the population. \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country  strategy  and \nprogram  for  Viet  Nam  aims  at  helping  the  Government  reduce \npoverty  to  10%\u201311%  by  2010  through  (i)  pro-poor  business-led \neconomic  growth,  (ii)  social  equity  and  balanced  development, \nand  (iii)  environment  protection  and  management.  The  country \nstrategy  and  program  emphasizes,  among  other \nthings, \ninvestment  in  rural  infrastructure,  addressing  the  shortage  of \nskilled workers, support to equity issues, access to basic services, \nand promoting governance. In the past decade, ADB has played a \nmajor role in Viet Nam\u2019s health sector, in particular in building up \nprimary  health  care,  nutrition,  and  communicable  diseases \ncontrol.  ADB,  with  adoption  of  its  long-term  strategic  framework \n2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020), will curtail direct support for national \nhealth sector investment projects to focus more on poverty-related \nassistance  for  achieving  millennium  development  goals,  sector \ngovernance  and  financing,  infrastructure,  public  goods,  and \nregional cooperation. \n \nThe  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  support  the  Health  Care \nin the South Central Coast Region (SCCR) Project, in parallel with \na  similar  project  of  the  World  Bank  in  the  North  Central  Coast \nRegion.  Sector  investment  remains  seriously  underfunded.  The \nGovernment also wants to improve sector efficiency and is moving \ntoward  a  sector  approach.  Accordingly,  the  Project  presents  a \ntransition  in  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  the  health  sector  in  Viet  Nam \nconsistent  with  Strategy  2020.  The  Project  will  support  the \nupgrading of provincial health services in eight provinces through \ndeveloping  a  comprehensive  provincial  health  systems  approach \nthat will help coordinate all sector sources and uses of funds. The \nProject  will be  followed by  ADB  support  to  a  sector  development \nprogram for the national sector approach in 2009, currently under \npreparation.   \n \n\nii \n\n \n\nRationale \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nIn  the  SCCR,  the  Project  will  improve  the  health  status  of  the \npopulation, in particular the poor, women and children, and ethnic \ngroups.  The  project  outcome  will  be  more  comprehensive,  well-\nmanaged, and better-used provincial health systems, with a focus \non  health  care  for  the  poor,  women  and  children,  and  ethnic \nminorities, including reproductive health care, in Da Nang City and \nQuang Nam, Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh, Phu Yen, Khanh Hoa, Ninh \nThuan, and Binh Thuan provinces.  \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $80  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $1.87 million.  \n \n\nSource \nADB Loan \nGovernment \nTotal \n\n \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n72.0 \n8.0 \n80.0 \n\nPercentage \nof Total \n90.0 \n10.0 \n100.0 \n\n               ADB = Asian Development Bank. \n               Source: ADB estimates. \n \nThe Government has asked ADB for a loan in SDR equivalent to \n$72 million from its Special Funds resources, including taxes and \nduties  of  $1.57  million,  to  help  finance  the  Project.  The  loan  will \nhave  a  32-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years.  The \ninterest  rate  will  be  1%  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per \nannum  thereafter.  The  Government  will  contribute  $8  million \nthrough central and provincial counterpart contributions. \n \nUntil 30 June 2014 \n \n31 December 2013 \n\n \nThe  MOH  will  establish  a  project  steering  committee  to  review \nproject  progress  and  provide  directions  on  a  quarterly  basis,  as \nwell  as  to  approve  the  annual  report,  plan,  and  budget.  It  will  be \nheaded  by  the  vice-minister  of  health  and  include  senior  officials \nfrom MOH departments and administrations, provinces, and other \nministries, as required. The provincial people\u2019s committee in each \nof the eight provinces will be the implementing agency and will be \nrepresented  by  the  provincial  health  bureau.  The  Project  will  be \nimplemented  through  a  project  management  unit  in  MOH,  and \neight provincial project management units in the provincial health \nbureaus.  \n \nMinistry of Health \n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nAllocation and Terms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \n\n \n\n\fand \n\nresettlement, \n\nenvironmental \n\nAll  ADB-financed  procurement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nProcurement  of  goods  will  use  international  competitive  bidding \nprocedures  if  over  $1  million,  national  competitive  bidding  if \n$1 million  or  less,  or  shopping  if  less  than  $100,000.  Civil  works \nwill  use  international  competitive  bidding  procedures  if  over \n$4 million,  national  competitive  bidding  if  $4  million  or  less,  or \nshopping if less than $100,000. Vehicles will be procured through \nthe  United  Nations,  using  procurement  procedures  acceptable  to \nADB.  \n \nThe Project will require 9 international consultants for a total of 70 \nperson-months, 12 national consultants for a total of 302 person-\nmonths, a nongovernment organization for 48 months, and short-\nterm  national  consultants  for  a  total  of  12  person-months.  MOH \nwill recruit as individual consultants one international engineering \nin  project \nand  environmental  specialist;  national  experts \nmanagement, \nwaste \nmanagement,  and  health  management  information  system;  and \nthe  short  term  consultants.  All  other  consultants  will  be  hired \nthrough  three  firms  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time), using a \nsimplified technical proposal and quality and cost-based selection. \n \nThe  SCCR  has  a  population  of  almost  9  million,  including  about \nhalf a million ethnic minorities. Four of the eight project provinces \nhave  poverty  levels  significantly  above  the  national  average  of \n19.5%,  including  Ninh  Thuan  at  45.0%,  Quang  Nam  at  36.3%, \nQuang  Ngai  at  36.1%,  and  Binh  Dinh  at  28.3%.  The  Project \ncontributes to poverty reduction by improving health services used \nby  the  poor,  and  will  especially  target  reproductive  health \ninterventions  that  benefit  women  and  children.  The  Project  will \nupgrade  or  newly  construct  20  hospitals  (19%  of  all  hospitals  in \nthe  region),  5  district  preventive  medicine  centers,  and  the  Ninh \nThuan  Secondary  Medical  School  for  nursing  and  paramedic \ntraining.  This  includes  equipping  these  and  other  facilities,  and \ntraining  in  waste  management  and  infection  control.  It  will  also \nimprove  staff  skills  throughout  the  project  area  and  add  128 \nspecialists and 160 health workers from ethnic communes. Out of \na total of 1,024 communes in the SCCR, village health care will be \nimproved  in  423  remote  communities,  including  223  communes \nclassified  as  poor,  and  about  250  ethnic  minority  communes.  Of \nthese,  100  ethnic  minority  communes  will  receive  intensified \nhealth  and  nutrition  promotion  and  better  ability  to  access  health \ncare services and health care funds for the poor. \n\niv \n\n \n\nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nIn  terms  of  institutional  benefits,  the  Project  will  support  a \ncomprehensive  and \nresults-based  provincial  health  system \ndevelopment  approach;  and  national  policies  for  (i)  standards  of \nthe  design  and  equipping  of  hospitals,  (ii)  a  provincial  human \nresource development system, (iii) managing health care funds for \nthe poor, and (iv) standards for provincial planning and budgeting. \n \nEconomic  benefits  may  flow  from  reduced  health  care  costs \nthrough  gains  in  labor  productivity  resulting  from  decreased \nincidence and severity of illness. Out-of-pocket cost savings may \nflow  from  (i)  increased  access  to  health  services  that  reduce \ntransport costs, and (ii) more efficient and rational diagnoses and \ntreatments that reduce treatment costs. An important cost factor is \nthat  caring  for  sick  children  also  reduces  adult  productivity.  The \nProject is estimated to reduce lost working days by an annual 6.5 \nmillion  in  the  SCCR,  valued  at  nearly  $14 million  per  year.  The \nProject\u2019s economic internal rate of return is estimated at 19%, with \nan economic net present value of $20.1 million.   \n \nThe  provincial  budget  is  the  most  important  of  the  public  sector \ncontributions,  as  direct  central  budget  support  for  public  health \nsector  is  relatively  minor.  Allocations  are  driven  by  economic \ngrowth  and  tax  revenues.  Changing  political  priorities  may  also \nreduce  the  sector  allocation.  Within  the  overall  sector  allocation, \nprovincial  governments  also  make  strategic  decisions  on  the \nbalance of investments that affect the impacts of provincial health \nsystems  and  the  Project.  The  Project  supports  policy  links  with \nMOH  and  provincial  planning  and  budgeting  to  guide  provinces \ntoward results-based health system development to achieve more \neffective,  equitable,  and  efficient  health  systems  and  to  monitor \nthis  closely.  The  process  is  also  expected  to  contribute  to  the \nnational sector approach and aid harmonization.      \n \nSeveral project activities such as improving the quality of hospital \nconstruction,  waste  management  systems,  and  skills  training  of \nhealth  staff  are  technically  challenging.  MOH  will  manage  the \nrecruitment and fielding of all consultants to ensure that adequate \ntechnical  support  can  be  provided  to  all  provinces  on  an  as-\nneeded basis.   \n \n \nWhile  substantial  experience  has  been  gained  in  managing  the \nprocurement  system,  some  delay  in  procurement  is  expected. \nAdvance action will help mitigate this risk, and MOH has selected \nproject  counterpart  staff \nin  project \nprocurement.      \n \nIn  terms  of  financial  sustainability  of  the  project,  operational \nexpenditures were estimated to add on average 2.3% of provincial \nrecurrent  health  expenditures  after  project  completion.  The \nprovinces  have  committed  to  provide  adequate  recurrent  budget \nfor operations and maintenance.  \n\nthat  has  experience \n\n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fo\n103  00\u2019E\n\no\n108  00\u2019E\n\nHa Giang Cao Bang\n7\n\n9\n\n10\n6\nBac Kan\n\nTrang Dinh\n\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC\nOF  CHINA\n\nLao Cai\n\nLai Chau\n\n4\n\n1\n\n2\n\nDien Bien\nPhu\n\n3\n\n8\nYen Bai\n\nTuyen Quang\n11\n\nThai Nguyen\n\n16\n\nLang Son\n\nSon La\n\nPhu Tho\n\n12\n\nVinh Yen\n\nViet Tri\n5\n\nHoa Binh\n\n14\n\n15\n\nHA NOI\n13\n\n22\n\nHung Yen\n23\nPhu Ly\n24\n\n26\n\n18\nBac Giang\n\n17\n\nMong Cai\n\nCam Pha\n\nHa Long\n\nHai Phong\n\n20\n\n19\nHai\nDuong\n21\nThai Binh\n\n25\nNinh Binh\n\nThanh Hoa\n\nGulf   of   Tonkin\n\n20  00\u2019No\n\n20  00\u2019No\n\nLAO PEOPLE'S\nDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC\n\nSOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF \nVIET NAM\nHEALTH CARE IN THE\nSOUTH CENTRAL COAST REGION\n\nThai Hoa\n27\n\nDien Chau\n\nVinh\n\nHa Tinh\n\n28\n\nN\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n200\n\nKilometers\n\nProject Area\n\nNational Capital\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nNational Road\n\nOther Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nDong Hoi\n\n29\n\nDong Ha\n\n30\n\nHue\n\n31\n\nDa Nang\n\nHoi An\n\n32\n\n33\n\nTam Ky\n\n34\n\nQuang Ngai\n\n35\nKon Tum\n\nBong Son\n\n37\n\nPleiku\n\n36\n\nQuy Nhon\n\n38\n\nTuy Hoa\n\n39\n\nBuon Ma\nThuot\n\n40\n\nDak Song\n\nNinh Hoa\n\nGia Nghia\n\nDa Lat\n\n44\nDong Xoai\n\n42\n\nDi Linh\n\nAn Loc\n\n45\n\nTay Ninh\n\n46\nThu Dau Mot\n\n51\nTan An\n\nBien Hoa\n\n47\n\n49\n\n48\n\nLien Huong\n\nPhan Thiet\n\n41\nNha Trang\n\nCam Ranh\n\n43\n\nPhan Rang-\nThap Cham\n\nGulf   of   Thailand\n\nChau Doc\n\nCao Lanh\n53\n\nVinh Long\n\n54\nLong\nXuyen\n\n57\n\nCan Tho\n\n58\n\nHo Chi Minh City\n50\nMy Tho\n\nDat Do\nVung Tau\n\nBen Tre\n\n52\n\n59\n\nHa Tien\n\nPhu Quoc Island\n\nRach Gia\n\nVi Thanh\n55\n\n56\n\n61\n\n62\n\nCa Mau\n\nBac Lieu\n\n60\n\nTra Vinh\n\nSoc Trang\n\n63\n\no\n103  00\u2019E\n\no\n108  00\u2019E\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\nCAMBODIA\n\n12  00\u2019No\n\n12  00\u2019No\n\nPROVINCES\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\n11.\n12.\n13.\n14.\n15.\n16.\n17.\n18.\n19.\n20.\n21.\n22.\n23.\n24.\n25.\n26.\n27.\n28.\n29.\n30.\n31.\n32.\n33.\n34.\n35.\n36.\n37.\n38.\n39.\n40.\n41.\n42.\n43.\n44.\n45.\n46.\n47.\n48.\n49.\n50.\n51.\n52.\n53.\n54.\n55.\n56.\n57.\n58.\n59.\n60.\n61.\n62.\n63.\n\nLai Chau\nDien Bien\nSon La\nLao Cai\nPhu Tho\nTuyen Quang\nHa Giang\nYen Bai\nCao Bang\nBac Kan\nThai Nguyen\nVinh Phuc\nHa Noi\nBac Ninh\nHung Yen\nLang Son\nQuang Ninh\nBac Giang\nHai Duong\nHai Phong\nThai Binh\nHoa Binh\nHa Nam\nNinh Binh\nNam Dinh\nThanh Hoa\nNghe An\nHa Tinh\nQuang Binh\nQuang Tri\nThua Thien Hue\nDa Nang\nQuang Nam\nQuang Ngai\nKon Tum\nGia Lai\nBinh Dinh\nPhu Yen\nDak Lak\nDak Nong\nKhanh Hoa\nLam Dong\nNinh Thuan\nBinh Phuoc\nTay Ninh\nBinh Duong\nDong Nai\nBinh Thuan\nBa Ria - Vung Tau\nHo Chi Minh\nLong An\nTien Giang\nDong Thap\nAn Giang\nKien Giang\nHau Giang\nCan Tho\nVinh Long\nBen Tre\nTra Vinh\nSoc Trang\nBac Lieu\nCa Mau\n\n08-3566 EG\n\n\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Health  Care  in  the  South  Central  Coast  Region \nProject.

From 1993 to 2007, poverty levels in Viet \nNam have dropped from over 58.0% to 19.5% and per capita income has more than doubled. \nUrban  areas  have  benefited  more,  as  in  2004  the  incidence  of  urban  poverty  was  13.7% \ncompared to 26.4% in rural areas.1 In recent years, however, growth of aggregate demand has \noutpaced  that  of  aggregate  supply.  The  Government  has  shifted  its  policy  priorities  from \nmaintaining high rates of investment and output growth to curbing inflation, reducing the trade \nand current account deficits, ensuring stable supply of basic food products to domestic markets, \nand enhancing social assistance to poor and vulnerable segments of the population.  \n\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) country strategy and program for Viet Nam aims at \n3.  \nhelping the Government reduce poverty to 10%\u201311% by 2010 through (i) pro-poor business-led \neconomic growth, (ii) social equity and balanced development, and (iii) environmental protection \nand  management.  The  country  strategy  and  program  emphasizes,  among  other  things, \ninvestment in rural infrastructure, addressing the shortage of skilled workers, support to equity \nissues,  access  to  basic  services,  and  promoting  governance.  In  the  past  decade,  ADB  has \nplayed a major role in Viet Nam\u2019s health sector, in particular in building up primary health care \n(PHC),  nutrition,  and  communicable  disease  control  (CDC).  With  the  adoption  of  its  long-term \nstrategic  framework  2008\u20132020  (Strategy  2020),  ADB  will  curtail  direct  support  for  national \nhealth  sector  investment  projects  to  focus  more  on  poverty-related  assistance,  including \nachieving  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs),  public  goods,  governance  and  financing, \ninfrastructure, and regional cooperation.2  \n \n4. \nThe  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  support  the  Health  Care  in  the  South  Central \nCoast Region (SCCR) Project,3 in parallel with a similar project of the World Bank in the North \nCentral  Coast  Region.  Sector  investment  remains  seriously  underfunded.  The  Government \nwants  to  improve  sector  efficiency  and  is  moving  toward  a  sector  approach.  Accordingly,  the \nProject represents a transition in ADB\u2019s assistance to the health sector in Viet Nam consistent \nwith  Strategy  2020.  It  will  support  upgrading  of  provincial  health  services  in  eight  provinces \nthrough  developing  a  comprehensive  provincial  health  systems  approach  that  will  help \ncoordinate all  sources and uses of health funds. The Project will be followed by ADB support \nfor  a  sector  development  program  for  the  national  sector  approach  in  2009  currently  under \npreparation.  \n\nThe  Project  will  cover  one  city  and  seven  provinces  in  the  SCCR\u2014Da  Nang  City  plus \n5. \nQuang  Nam,  Quang  Ngai,  Binh  Dinh,  Phu  Yen,  Khanh  Hoa,  Ninh  Thuan,  and  Binh  Thuan \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2006.

The SCCR has a population of almost 9 million, including about half a million ethnic \nminorities.  It  is  largely  a  rural  and  agricultural  region,  with  coastal  fishing,  tourism,  and  salt \nproduction. Compared to the national average poverty level of 19.5%, poverty levels in four out \nof eight provinces in the SCCR are much higher.4 \n \n6. \nViet Nam has made good progress in improving the health status of its citizens. Between \n2000  and  2005,  the  child  malnutrition  rate  (weight  by  age)  has  been  reduced  from  33.1%  to \n25.2%, the child mortality rate from 42 to 28 child deaths per 1,000 live births, and the maternal \nmortality  ratio  from  95  to  80  maternal  deaths  per  100,000  live  births. 5 However,  disparities \nremain.  Its  population  is  undergoing  a  demographic  and  epidemiological  transition.  By  2014, \n10% of the population will be over 60 years old. Demand for health services is rising rapidly due \nto  such  factors  as  rising  incomes  and  education,  population  aging,  rural\u2013urban  migration,  and \ntraffic accidents. However, inequity has also been increasing. Given current trends, the country \ncan  only  achieve  its  MDGs  by  2015  if  it  makes  considerable  efforts  to  improve  the  quality  of \ncare  and  financial  access  for  the  poor  and  ethnic  minorities  in  lagging  communities  with  high \nmortality, morbidity, and malnutrition rates. In 2005, the infant mortality rate in rural areas was \nstill  twice  the  urban  rate.  Health  and  nutrition  indicators  are  much  worse  among  some  ethnic \ngroups. In the SCCR, these communes are mostly located in the mountainous hinterland.  \n \n7. \nDisease  patterns  are  changing.  In  1976,  infectious  diseases  accounted  for  56%  of \nmorbidity, compared to only 26% in 2004, while the share of noninfectious diseases grew from \n43% to 61%, and injuries and accidents from 2% to 13%. The current longevity largely results \nfrom past efforts to reduce child mortality and promote a healthy lifestyle. These gains may be \nlost  in  a  more  affluent  society,  with  less  attention  to  prevention  and  a  rise  in  diseases  of \naffluence.  Still,  the  battle  for  infectious  diseases  control  is far  from  over  and  needs  continuing \ninvestment. The prevalence of HIV/AIDS among adults has climbed to 0.5%, and the incidence \nof tuberculosis has not declined recently. Pandemic influenza and other emerging diseases are \na  constant  threat.  To  address  this  double  burden  of  diseases,  both  major  upgrading  of  health \nservices for the general population and targeted support for poor communes are needed.  \n \n8. \nPreventive and hospital services are mostly public. Private services mainly contribute to \ncurative outpatient care. Viet Nam\u2019s public health system follows the administrative structure of \nthe  village,  commune,  district,  provincial,  and  national  levels.  The  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH) \nstructure  also  has  three  main  vertical  pillars:  curative,  preventive  and  administrative.  Village \nhealth workers (VHWs) provide village health care along with private paramedics and volunteers \nof mass organizations. Commune health stations (CHSs) serve up to 10 villages each and have \nat  least  one  trained  health  worker.  District  hospitals,  with 50\u2013100  beds,  provide  basic  hospital \nservices  for  a  catchment  area  of  about  100,000  people.  Provincial  hospitals,  with  500\u20131,000 \nbeds,  provide  a  range  of  specialized  services  for  about  1  million  people.  MOH  operates  a \nsystem  of  national  referral  hospitals,  including  in  Da  Nang  City.  The  health  services  are \ncomplemented by vertical programs, such as for immunization, CDC, and safe motherhood.  \n \n9. \nAccess to priority interventions, and in particular those supported by vertical programs, is \ngenerally good. Most children are fully immunized and most deliveries are attended by a trained \nhealth worker. However, 44% of pregnant women received fewer than three antenatal checkups \nin 2005, and 22% delivered at home. In addition, women in the poorest quintile were one third \nas  likely  to  receive  checkups,  and  half  as  likely  to  deliver  in  a  health  facility  compared  to  the \n\n                                                 \n4  Poverty  levels  in  Ninh  Thuan  (45.0%),  Quang  Nam  (36.3%),  Quang  Ngai  (36.1%),  and  Binh  Dinh  (28.3%) \n\nprovinces are much higher than the national average.   \n\n5  Ministry of Health. 2006.

There are also gaps in district hospital services, such as emergency care for life-\nthreatening conditions. Provincial hospitals are overused in the SCCR while district hospitals are \nunderused,  resulting  in  considerable  inefficiencies.  To  decongest  provincial  hospitals  and \nprovide better quality care, MOH proposes the development of so-called regional (interdistrict) \nhospitals, upgrading district hospitals, and providing better qualified staff.   \n \n10. \nHealth care costs in Viet Nam have recently escalated. In 2006, it is estimated that total \nhealth expenditure per capita reached $40 (5.5% of gross domestic product). That includes $10 \nin  public  health  spending  amounting  to  about  6%  of  public  spending. 6 Private  expenditure, \nmainly  out-of-pocket  payments,7 accounts  for  about  75%  of  total  expenditure  nationally,  and \nabout 50% in the SCCR. It is mainly for curative care at public hospitals. Out-of-pocket payment \nmakes services less affordable for the poor, in particular for catastrophic illnesses and chronic \ncare. The Government supports provincial health care funds for the poor (HCFP) to address this \nissue.  \n \n11. \nViet  Nam\u2019s  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan  recognizes the  central  role  of  the  health \nsector. It identifies major challenges, including inequitable benefits from public services, rapidly \ngrowing  demand \ninfrastructure,  a \nfor  quality  services,  outdated  and  poorly  equipped \nsubstandard  workforce,  limited  access  for  the  poor,  and  the  challenges  of  managing  and \nfinancing  an  increasingly  complex  health  system.  The  Political  Bureau\u2019s  Resolution  No.  46  of \n2005  calls  for  urgent  action  to  adjust  the  health  system  to  the  modern  market  economy.  The \nComprehensive Design for the Health System in Viet Nam to 2010 and Vision by 20208 form the \nfoundation  and  rationale \nthis  Project.  The  Government  puts  major  emphasis  on \nstrengthening  the  provincial  health  system,  and  it  has  decentralized  the  governance  and \nfinancing  of  health  services  to  provincial,  district,  and  commune  level  administrations.  The \nprovincial  government  receives  budget  support  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  has  some \nflexibility  in  allocating  funds  between  providing  services  and  capital  spending.  Provincial \ngovernments  are  responsible  for  increasingly  complex  health  systems.  They  need  to  address \nrising  demand,  reaching  the  poor,  national  reforms,  and  sector  objectives.  Managing  this \nincreasingly  complex  provincial  health  system  requires  a  comprehensive,  results-based \napproach with strong national support.   \n \nUnder  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance,  each  of  the  eight  provinces  was \n12. \nassisted to prepare provincial health accounts and a 5-year plan and medium-term expenditure \nframework  (MTEF).  The  aim  was  to  help  determine  funding  requirements  and  the  resource \nenvelope, set priorities, mobilize and harmonize funding, develop a results-based approach, and \ncoordinate and monitor services. The Project will support provincial health system development \nand  finance  a  slice  of  each  provincial  health  plan  covering  four  areas:  (i) improving  health \nfacilities; (ii) strengthening human resources; (iii) improving access to health care for the poor, \nwomen,  and  ethnic  minorities;  and  (iv)  strengthening  provincial  health  system  management. \nMOH  and  partners  will  provide  complementary  funding.  This  approach  will  also  help  create \nprovincial  capacity  to  upgrade  and  reform  provincial  services  under  a  comprehensive  national \nsector approach being developed by the Government and major partners including ADB. Project \nprocessing is currently ongoing for this support.      \n\nfor \n\n                                                 \n6  World Bank. 2006. Public Expenditure Review.

Ha Noi.  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\n1. \n\nInsufficient Health Facilities \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nB. \n \n \n \nViet Nam\u2019s  public health sector is burdened with an old infrastructure that is physically \n13. \ndegraded, poorly equipped, and has inadequate systems for water and waste management and \ninfection control. The SCCR has two MOH hospitals (in Da Nang City), 40 provincial hospitals, \n64 district hospitals, 91 polyclinics, and 1,020 CHSs. Appendix 2 provides a sector analysis.  \n \nThe provincial hospital in Viet Nam provides basic specialist services.9 District hospitals \n14. \nin  Viet  Nam  often  lack  these  services  and  are  bypassed  in  favor  of  the  provincial  hospital. \nProvincial  hospitals  are  typically  overwhelmed  with  both  outpatients  and  inpatients.  The  bed \noccupancy rate in provincial hospitals in the SCCR is about 130%, compared to about 80% in \ndistrict  hospitals.  Hospital  admissions  have  grown  by  about  3%  each  year  between  2000  and \n2005.  Even  so,  the  bed:population  ratio  for  provincial  hospitals  in  the  SCCR  is  about  8  per \n10,000  people.  This  is  slightly  higher  than  the  national  average,  suggesting  that  expanding \nprovincial hospitals is not a priority.     \n \n15. \nIn  terms  of  hospital  services,  three  actions  are  simultaneously  needed  in  the  SCCR: \n(i) replace  old  infrastructure,  (ii)  decongest  provincial  hospitals  by  upgrading  district  hospitals \nwhile  possibly  adding  a  gatekeeping  function,  and  (iii)  improve  the  quality  and  efficiency  of \nhospital services. On this last point, the hospital inpatient stay is relatively long at an average of \n8  days.  Financial  incentives  drive  hospitals  to  retain  inpatients  and  to  add  beds.  Accordingly, \nfinancial incentives should be changed to reduce nonessential inpatient stay.   \n \n16.  MOH  estimates  that  only  50%  of  hospitals  meet  80%  of  prescribed  equipment \nstandards. Just 5% of hospitals have modern X-ray equipment. Despite the long list of partners \nin  each  province  (Appendix  3),  only  30%  of  hospitals  report  having  received  external  aid  for \nequipment. MOH has set out criteria to guide the modernization and standardization of curative \nservices. There is a standard list of equipment for every type of health facility. Given increasing \ndemand for high-quality health care, this includes certain equipment for advanced diagnostics, \nin particular for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and trauma.  \n \n17.  Most  provinces  lack  modern  medical  waste  incinerators  or  do  not  have  established \nprocedures  to  coordinate  their  use  among  hospitals.  Lack  of  maintenance,  fuel,  and  other \nequipment and supplies further compromise their efficient use. Special procedures are required \nfor  medical  sharps,  contaminated  wastes,  organic  wastes,  hazardous  chemicals,  and \nradioactive  wastes,  along  with  funds  for  staff  training,  supplies,  and  equipment  maintenance. \nMOH  wants  to  see  hospital  waste  management  systems  and  practices  included  in  every \nhospital project (footnote 8). \n \n18. \nDecongesting  public  hospitals  also  requires  better  facilities  for  basic  health  care.  MOH \nplans  to  improve  CHS  facilities  from  its  own  resources.  MOH  has  also  prepared  a  plan  for \nconstructing  district  preventive  medicine  centers  (DPMCs)  to  strengthen  preventive  care  at \ncommune  level.  These  will  focus  on  infectious  diseases  control,  food  safety,  and  certain \nreproductive health services. MOH is working on a plan to pilot test these centers in the SCCR.    \n \n\n                                                 \n9  Provincial hospitals in Viet Nam are comparable to the World Health Organization\u2019s concept of the district hospital.   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\n2. \n\nInadequate Quality of Health Staff \n\n \n \n19. \nThe  quality  of  services  in  health  facilities  depends  greatly  on  staff  performance. \nEvidence from various studies indicates that staff has serious gaps in their knowledge, attitudes, \nand  skills.  There  are  also  staff  imbalances.  MOH  expects  the  provinces  to  take  the  lead  in \naddressing  these  issues.  The  increasingly  complex  health  context,  including  private  sector \ngrowth,  provides  significant  challenges  to  planning  and  managing  the  health  workforce.  Each \nprovincial  health  bureau  (PHB)  is  responsible  for  preparing,  managing,  and  monitoring  human \nresources  development  (HRD)  in  the  province,  for  which  it  is  ill-prepared.  In  addition,  MOH \nundertakes  few  studies  on  HRD  policy  and  management  issues  that  would  provide  valuable \npolicy inputs for planning the future health workforce. \n \nSix provincial secondary medical schools (SMSs), Da Nang Medical College, and Ninh \n20. \nThuan Medical Training Center together provide most of the education and in-service training to \nnurses  and  paramedics  in  the  SCCR.  Most  of  their  teachers  do  not  possess  postgraduate \nqualifications,  however,  and  some  have  only  secondary  level  qualifications.  In  addition,  most \ninstruction puts little emphasis on problem solving and skills training. While there is a move in \nthis  direction,  most  training  curricula  and  materials  do  not  support  a  skills-based  approach. \nMOH is planning to make SMS education and training more relevant to the daily tasks.   \n \nImportantly, there are no established standards for continuing education for any types of \n21. \nstaff at any level, including doctors. MOH plans to introduce policies on continuing education for \nthose  already  in  the  workforce.10 It  has  recently  initiated  a  new  in-service  training  program  for \nprofessionals, whereby staff at each level will provide training to staff one level lower. There are \nalso  no  established guidelines  for professional  licensure  or  institutional  accreditation,  although \npolicies addressing these issues are being developed.11  \n \n22. \nThe total number and distribution of health staff is fair in the SCCR. For example, 70% of \nCHSs  have  a  doctor  and  almost  all  have  a  female  health  worker.  As  elsewhere  in  Viet  Nam, \nhowever, there are some important imbalances, including (i) shortage of nurses, (ii) lack of core \nspecialists, (iii) lack of health workers with ethnic minority background, and (iv) unwillingness of \nhealth  personnel  to  serve  in  remote  areas.  MOH  has  set  goals  to  recruit  and  train  increased \nnumbers  of  health  staff,  especially  doctors  (core  specialties),  nurses,  technicians,  and \npharmacists,  as  well  as  to  upgrade  the  quality  of  their  training.  MOH  is  planning  to  provide \nscholarships to suitable ethnic minority candidates to serve their communes.    \n \n \n \n23. \nA major thrust of the Government\u2019s health sector plan is to consolidate and complete the \ngrassroots  health  care  network  (footnote  8).  This  is  a  priority  for  remote  communes  that  lack \naccess to higher level services. MOH plans to finance the upgrading, equipping, and staffing of \nCHSs  from  its  own  sources.  At  village  level,  MOH  aims  to  have  one  female  and  one  male \ntrained  VHWs  in  each  village.  Of  the  1,024  communes  in  the  SCCR\u2019s  84  districts,  423  are \nremote or mountainous, including 223 classified as poor, and most of the estimated 250 ethnic \nminority communes. Inadequate knowledge and skills of VHWs is a common issue, and some \n20%  of  remote  villages  lack  competent  VHWs.  Female  VHWs  need  to  be  increased  so  that \nmore attention can be given to reproductive health and nutrition.  \n  \n\nAccess for the Poor and Ethnic Minorities \n\n3. \n\n                                                 \n10 The Department of Science and Training is working on a master plan for the training system. \n11 MOH is developing a law on examination and treatment.  \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\n24.  While  high  mortality  rates  reflect  the  risks  of  living  in  remote  areas,  there  are  other \nimportant factors. For example, one study showed that nearly half of maternal deaths were due \nto  delays  in  making  decisions,  identifying  mothers  at  risk,  and  providing  essential  treatment \n(footnote 5). While a major cause of this delay is the lack of skilled health workers, low demand \nis  another  factor.  Ethnic  minorities,  in  particular,  tend  to  seek  health  services  less  often, \naveraging 2.3 outpatient visits per year compared to 3.5 for Kinh. Traditions, mistrust, and lack \nof  education  affect  demand.  Thus,  promoting  appropriate  health  and  nutrition  among  minority \nwomen\u2014and  preferably  by  women  belonging  to  the  same  ethnic  group\u2014is  considered  a \npriority.   \n \n25.  While other factors influence access, the out-of-pocket cost of health care is perhaps the \nmost significant constraining factor. Utilization of both outpatient and hospital inpatient services \nshows  a  strong  link  with  economic  status.  The  predominance  of  user  fees  at  all  levels  of  the \nhealth  system,  coupled  with  the  cost  of  drugs  and  indirect  expenses  for  travel  and \naccompanying  family  members,  can  be  a  devastating  financial  burden  for  those  living  at  a \nsubsistence level. In 2002, Prime Minister Decision 139 established the HCFP to mitigate these \nfinancial burdens for the poor, ethnic minorities in 12 mountainous provinces, and residents of \nsocioeconomically disadvantaged communes.12  \n \n26. \nSubsequent  decisions  provided  for  issuing  health  insurance  cards  to  all  beneficiaries, \nincreasing the number of eligible people by raising the poverty line, and an expanded benefits \npackage that includes travel cost for referral. HCFP enrollment rose to an estimated 14.9 million \nin  2006\u2014accounting  for  44%  of  the  34.5  million  subscribers  to  all  health  insurance  schemes \n(Appendix 2). But even with its rapid growth, the potential of HCFP has yet to be fully realized. \nAdministration  of  the  funds  at  the  provincial  level  has  been  weak  and  inconsistent.  Enrollees \nsometimes  do  not  understand  their  eligibility  or  how  to  access  health  services.  Improving  the \nmanagement of the HCFP is a priority in the region.   \n \n \n \n27. \nGiven  the  relatively  high  gains  already  made  and  the  growing  complexity  of  health \nsystem  technology  and  finance,  to achieve  further  improvements  in  health  status will  be  more \nchallenging.  It  requires greater  management  sophistication in  planning and  executing  targeted \nprograms designed to upgrade the services and reach entrenched populations of the poor and \nunderserved.  Beginning  in  1996  with  the  introduction  of  the  State  Budget  Law  (footnote  5), \nprovinces  have  had  authority  to  spend  on  provincial  health  services,  with  districts  and \ncommunes  having  responsibilities  for  services  delegated  to  them  by  the  province.  In  addition, \nthe provincial authorities receive central subsidies and have some discretion in determining how \nthese are allocated. However, provincial authorities often lack the information and know-how to \ndo so effectively.     \n \n28. \nBeginning in 2002 with approval of the master plan for the development of the hospital \nnetwork  in  Viet  Nam  for  2005\u20132010,  policy  changes  were  also  introduced  to  promote \ninstitutional  independence.  Reforms  were  aimed  at  systematizing  and  rationalizing  the  system \nand  promoting  greater  financial  autonomy  in  hospitals.  Decree  10  in  2002  introduced \nmechanisms to encourage hospitals to raise their own revenues, hire and terminate employees, \nand  mobilize  funds.  However,  it  stimulated  overuse  of  revenue-producing  services  and \nexpenditure imbalances. It was replaced by Decree 43 in 2006, which allowed certain hospitals \ngreater  freedom  to  set  user  fees  provided  all  operating  costs  were  covered  before  using \n\nPlanning and Managing in Transition \n\n4. \n\n                                                 \n12 Axelson, Henrik. 2007.

In  the  current  process  of \ndecentralization,  managerial  roles  are  changing  and  unclear,  and  hospital  directors  lack  the \ninformation, tools, training, and experience to carry out their new responsibilities effectively.  \n \n29.  Making  increasingly  complex  managerial  decisions  also  requires  a  more  sophisticated \nhealth  management  information  system  (HMIS).  At  the  provincial  level,  there  is  a  dearth  of \nhealth and health services data required for a results-based system. HMIS has been introduced \non a trial basis in a number of provinces with good success. Using external aid, provincial health \nofficers have demonstrated a growing capacity for planning, decision making, and management. \nMOH  wants  to  further  strengthen  HMIS  capacity  by  (i)  introducing  technology,  hardware,  and \ntraining  needed  for  a  modern  HMIS;  (ii)  training  in  institutional  and  health  systems  planning, \nfinance,  and  decision  making;  and  (iii)  introducing  performance-based  monitoring  methods \n(footnote 8).  \n \n \n \nIncreasing demand for services is prompting MOH to plan for upgrading health services \n30. \nand mobilizing local funding and foreign aid. In recent years, financing of the health sector from \nlocal  government  sources  has  improved  substantially  (and  particularly  in  the  better-off \nprovinces).  The  Government  is  issuing  state  bonds  to  boost  sector  investment.  External \nassistance accounts for only 5%\u201310% of total sector spending, and the Government hopes to \nincrease this. Appendix 3 provides a summary of external assistance.  \n \n31.  MOH  is  developing  a  comprehensive  national  health  sector  approach  to  reduce \nfragmentation,  balance  investments,  improve  aid  coordination,  and  reduce  transaction  costs. \nThe  sector  has  been  selected  as  a  pilot  sector  for  aid  harmonization.  MOH  and  the  Health \nPartnership  Group\u2014including  most  major  aid  agencies\u2014are  conducting  joint  annual  health \nreviews and are developing a common agenda for health sector development.13 Some building \nblocks  toward  a  national  health  sector  approach  have  been  initiated,  including  the  piloting  of \nprovincial health accounts, 5-year plans and MTEFs during preparation of this Project, and aid \nharmonization  in  safe  motherhood  and  tuberculosis  programs.  This  will  improve  transparency \nregarding sources and uses of funds, enhance ownership and accountability, establish policies \nand  standards,  strengthen  program  performance  and  monitoring,  and  mobilize  support.  Aid \nharmonization is moving from project coordination to policy dialogue and program support, with \nMOH providing strong leadership to the group. MOH and aid agencies are planning the first joint \npartnership investment in 2009. ADB is planning to support this new partnership in health with a \nsector development program for HRD in 2009.   \n \n32. \nIn anticipation of this development, the Government has requested ADB and the World \nBank to support regional projects to help upgrade provincial health systems. Major investment in \nthe  66  provinces  is  done  in  a  phased  manner  and  is  based  on  clearly  articulated  national \npolicies  and  standards  and  provincial  priorities  and  resources.  At  present,  ADB  supports  five \nprojects in Viet Nam addressing PHC and CDC, in addition to targeted support for the poor with \nthe support of the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction.14 The World Bank is supporting projects in \n\n                                                 \n13 Ministry of Health, Viet Nam, and Health Partnership Group. 2007.

The Government has asked both banks \nto  support  similar  projects  in  the  north  and  south  central  coast  regions,  which  are  areas  with \nhigher poverty levels (footnote 1). Appendix 3 shows that there are substantial commitments for \nexternal  assistance  in  the  region.  According  to  provincial  authorities,  however,  actual \ncontributions  are  much  less.  ADB  is  also  supporting  the  2005  Preventive  Health  System \nSupport  Project  to  upgrade  provincial  preventive  medicine centers  and  four  national  institutes; \nas well as the Greater Mekong Subregion Regional Communicable Diseases Control Project to \nsupport  surveillance  and  response  systems,  the  control  of  neglected  endemic  diseases,  and \nregional cooperation in CDC.   \n \n \n \nViet  Nam\u2019s  health  system  development  is  fragmented,  resulting  in  imbalances, \n33. \ninefficiencies, and relative underspending on preventive care and basic health services. Recent \nnational and provincial programming initiatives\u2014including those under the technical assistance \nfor this Project\u2014should help improve this situation. Health facilities construction has been driven \nby administrative standards. To improve the cost-benefit of infrastructure investment, upgrading \nand planning new hospitals must be carefully justified in view of a rapidly changing context that \nincludes an expanding road network and deregulation of private hospital development by 2010.  \n \nExperiences  with  ADB-assisted  projects  show  that  project  implementation  is  done  in \n34. \nrelative  isolation,  causing  inefficiencies  during  implementation  and  risking  the  sustainability  of \ninvestments.15 In  preparing  for  this  Project,  the  provinces  were  assisted  to  prepare  provincial \nhealth  accounts  and  develop  comprehensive  provincial  health  plans  and  budgets.  ADB  partly \nfinances these plans. Further support for strengthening provincial planning and management is \nincluded  in  the  Project  to  move  toward  a  more  comprehensive,  pro-poor,  and  results-based \napproach  to  developing  provincial  health  systems.  Lack  of  performance  standards  and  quality \ncontrol  mechanisms  are  related  concerns.  MOH  will  be  supported  to  provide  guidance  to  the \nprovinces in terms of policies and standards while learning from provincial development for the \nsake  of  policy  development.  This  needs  to  proceed  in  parallel  with  establishing  a  provincial \nquality control system to ensure proper performance of services.      \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome  \n\nThe Project will improve the health status of the population in the SCCR, in particular the \n35. \npoor, women and children, and ethnic groups. The outcome will be more comprehensive, well-\nmanaged,  and  better-used  provincial  health  systems  with  a  focus  on  health  care  for  the  poor, \nwomen and children, and ethnic minorities, including reproductive health care, in Da Nang City \nand Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh, Phu Yen, Khanh Hoa, Ninh Thuan, and Binh Thuan \nprovinces.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs  \n\n36. \nDuring  project  preparation,  each  of  the  eight  provinces  developed  a  comprehensive \nprovincial  5-year  plan  and  MTEF  to  identify  gaps  and  priorities  in  the provincial  health  system \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \nCommunicable Diseases Control Project.

Based on these plans, and in line with \ngovernment policies, a range of outputs were identified for support by the Project. The project \noutputs are (i) improved health facilities, in particular district hospitals; (ii) strengthened human \nresources  through  improved  workforce  planning  and  training  capacity  plus  specific  training \nprograms centered around the provincial SMSs; (iii) improved access to health care for the poor \nthrough better information and procedures; and (iv) strengthened provincial health systems from \nimproved management and monitoring of the provincial health systems, including hospitals.  \n\n \n1. \n\nOutput 1: Improved Health Facilities   \n\n \n37. \nBased on priorities identified in the 5-year plan, the Project will upgrade health facilities \nin the eight target provinces to increase access and improve the quality of services. The Project \nwill finance (i) civil works, equipment, and related supplies; and (ii) water, sanitation, and waste \nmanagement  systems.  The  Project  will  provide  the  inputs  required  to  bring  each  facility  up  to \nspecified standards. MOH will provide complementary funds to improve PHC. \n \n\na. \n\nNew and Upgraded Health Facilities and Equipment \n\n \n38. \nThe  Project  will  upgrade  or  newly  construct  a  total  of  26  facilities,  including  12  district \nhospitals,  5  regional  (interdistrict)  hospitals,  1  provincial  hospital,  1  rehabilitation  hospital, \n1 traditional medicine hospital, 1 SMS, and 5 DPMCs in the region. The 20 hospitals represent \n19%  of  the  total  hospitals  in  the  region,  and  were  selected  based  on  provincial  priorities  and \nconsistency  with  national  plans  and  project  goals.  Each  construction  site  was  surveyed  for \nresettlement or environmental issues. The Project will also upgrade the national hospital design \nand construction standards and guidelines (para. 78). Once completed, newly constructed and \nrenovated facilities must be properly maintained to realize benefits and justify investments. The \nProject will support preparing guidelines for preventive maintenance, collecting and translating \ntechnical  manuals,  and  training  hospital  personnel  in  preventive  maintenance  procedures  and \narrangements. \n \n\n39. \nThe  Project  will  also  finance  procuring  equipment  for  upgraded  or  newly  constructed \nhospitals and other institutions identified by provincial authorities as serving target populations. \nA total of 31 facilities, including 17 district hospitals, 5 regional hospitals, 3 provincial hospitals, \n1 SMS, and 5 DPMCs in the region will receive equipment. The 25 hospitals represent 24% of \nthe  hospitals  in  the  region.  Equipment  purchases  will  be  in  accordance  with  established  MOH \nstandards  and  will  replace  old  and  nonfunctioning  equipment,  upgrade  technology  for  existing \nprocedures, or provide new services. The Project will support purchasing an initial inventory of \nreagents and other supplies needed to properly utilize the new equipment, as well as training in \nuse of the equipment and maintenance arrangements.   \n \n \n \n40. \nInvestments will be made as needed to ensure that all facilities built or upgraded under \nthe Project have adequate and safe water, sanitation, and medical waste management systems, \nincluding  wastewater  systems,  proper  containers  to  segregate  contaminated  and  hazardous \nwaste, proper collection and storage facilities, and access to modern medical waste incineration \nand/or disposal facilities. A total of 840 hospital personnel (8 per hospital) will be trained in the \ntheory,  methodologies,  and  supervision  of  modern  waste  management  practices.  In  addition, \nthe Project will support consulting assistance to work with authorities in each target province in \ndeveloping a province-wide plan for the management of medical waste. \n \n\nImproved Water, Sanitation, and Waste Management Systems \n\nb.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\na. \n\nb.  \n\nImproved Provincial Training Capacity \n\nOutput 2: Strengthened Provincial Human Resources \n\nImproved Provincial Human Resource Planning and Management \n\n2. \n \nIncreasing the performance of health staff is a local concern and a demanding obligation \n41. \nfor provincial health authorities. The Project will support (i) provincial human resources planning \nand management, (ii) building provincial training capacity, (iii) training for better quality of care, \nand (iv) HRD policy support. \n \n \n \n42. \nThe  Project  will  provide  assistance  to  each  PHB  to  annually  update  and  maintain  the \nprovincial  HRD  plan.  The  plan  will  provide  for  monitoring  and  evaluating  staff  quantity  and \nquality, as well as education and training programs. The annual HRD plan will take into account \nnational  policy  initiatives,  including  those  currently  being  considered  on  licensure,  certification, \nand  continuing  education.  The  plan  will  include  targeted  strategies  to  increase  the  leadership \nrole  of  women  in  managing  health  services.  To  help  boost  the  number  of  female  and  ethnic \nminority health workers in targeted communities, the Project will assist each province to develop \nprovincial  health  sector  gender  and  ethnic  minority  development  plans,  including  focused \ninterventions designed to ensure they reach targets for women and ethnic minorities in training \ncourses at all levels. Health workers serving ethnic minority communities will be given priority for \ntraining, and training programs will include topics that particularly concern ethnic minorities.   \n \n \n \n \n43. \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  quality  of  preservice  education  and  in-service  training  by \nincreasing the capacity of training facilities\u2019 staff.16 Leadership will be enhanced by providing 16 \nscholarships to ensure each SMS has at least two senior staff members with masters degrees \nin  nursing. The  quality  of  teaching  and  learning  at  the  SMSs  will  be  improved  by  linking  them \nwith  centers  of  excellence  at  medical  universities  in  Viet  Nam,  supporting  48  short-course \ntraining  attachments,  and  training  25  university  staff  as  advisors  for  the  8  SMSs.  As  a \nmechanism  for  quality  improvement  in  education  programs,  support  will  also  be  provided  to \nenable SMSs to evaluate graduate preparedness.  \n \n44. \nThe SMSs will also be supported in introducing and/or expanding skills-based training\u2014\nan  approach  that  has  proven  to  be  very  successful  in  improving  health  staff  performance. \nEquipment and materials will be provided to enable students to develop skills in demonstration \nrooms and laboratories. To assist provincial health authorities to implement skills-based training \nprograms,  the  Project  will  support  provincial  training  working  groups  and  encourage  the \nformation of similar groups where they do not exist. Eighty-eight working group members will be \ntrained as master trainers by skills-based training specialists. Support will also be provided for \nSMSs and provincial training working groups to evaluate the impact of in-service training.  \n \n \n \n45. \nThe Project will support well-supervised in-service training to improve the quality of care \nprovided by health staff at all levels. By mobilizing master trainers and other trainers, 100\u2013200 \ndoctors, nurses, midwives, and technicians will be trained annually in each province, about 10% \n\nImproved Quality and Availability of Staff  \n\nc.  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n16 For purposes of this report, the eight training facilities in SCCR (Da Nang Technical Medical College, six provincial \nSMSs, and the Ninh Thuan medical center that is to become the region\u2019s 7th SMS) are jointly referred to as \u201cthe \nSMSs.\u201d \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\n \n\nd. \n\nHRD Policy Studies Conducted   \n\nof staff. Training programs will be short term and will emphasize skills-based training in priority \ntopics. All 400 workplace supervisors will be trained to ensure they have the skills necessary to \nsupport  trainees  back  in  the  workplace.  MOH  is  exploring  options  to  encourage  continuing \neducation as a part of registering and licensing health professionals. The Project will support the \nSMSs  to  offer  subsidized  professional  education  meetings  that  will  be  open  to  health  workers \nfrom both the public and private sectors. \n  \n46. \nTo assist provinces in achieving MOH staffing standards for health facilities, the Project \nwill  support  64  scholarships  for  upgrade  to  bachelor  and  another  64  scholarships  for \npostgraduate  training  in  such  core  specialties  as  surgery  and  pediatrics.  To  address  the \nshortage of health staff in 423 remote CHSs, in particular those serving poor ethnic minorities, \nthe  Project  will  provide  160  scholarships  in  particular  to  female  school  leavers  to  attend \npre-graduate training at SMSs and on completion to be posted to CHSs near their communes.  \nHalf of these students will also be provided with bridging education to qualify for enrollment at \nthe SMS.     \n \n \n \n47.  MOH  is  responsible  for  policy  analysis  and  formulation,  guidance  to  institutions,  and \nprograms  and  services  to  implement  policy  (footnote  8).  To  fulfill  this  role  in  the  decentralized \nhealth system, MOH needs to maintain close links with provincial, district, and commune levels. \nThe Project will support, in coordination with the departments of science and training, therapy, \nand organization and personnel, up to 10 field-based HRD studies related to improving health \ncare for the poor, women and children, and ethnic minorities.   \n \n \n \n48. \nAccess  to  quality  health  care  for  the  poor  requires  collaboration  between  services  and \ncommunities so that health is seen as an issue of communal concern and not simply a technical \nmatter for health workers. In the health services, this requires building skills in community-based \nhealth  care.  At  the  community  level,  VHWs  and  committees  need  backing  from  local  officials \nand  mass  organizations.  This  output  will  aim  to  improve  basic  health  care  for  423 remote \ncommunes,  including  223  communes  classified  as  poor  and  others  with  ethnic  groups  having \npoor health indicators. It includes three interrelated sub-outputs targeting these communes: (i) \ntraining  VHWs  for  remote  communes,  (ii)  promoting  health  and  nutrition  especially  targeting \nethnic minorities, and (iii) reducing financial barriers to improve access for the poor.  \n \n \n   \n49. \nThe Project will support the Government\u2019s policy of strengthening the grassroots network \nof  VHWs  in  423  remote  and  disadvantaged  communes  in  84  districts  in  eight  provinces.  The \nProject aims to train CHS staff near targeted villages as trainers. Most of the 6,500 VHWs in the \ntargeted  communes  will  be  provided  with  a  total  of  20  refresher  training  days  over  the  project \nperiod. About 1,600 additional VHWs will be recruited and trained for an initial period of 1 month \nso that each village has at least one female and one male VHW providing basic health care by \nproject completion. Each provincial training working group and district health bureau will conduct \ntraining  of  CHS  staff  and  VHWs  based  on  needs  assessment,  using  peers  and  skills-based \ntraining  methods.  Provincial  trainers  will  participate  in  training  of  VHWs  to  ensure  adequate \nstandard  of  training,  and  training  will  be  adapted  to  the  needs,  ethnic diversity,  literacy  levels, \nand situations in each targeted district.  \n \n\nBetter-Skilled Village Health Workers in Remote Communes \n\nOutput 3: Improved Access to Health Care for the Poor \n\na.  \n\n3.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nto \n\nb.  \n\n \nc. \n\ninform  poor  and  ethnic  minority  communities, \n\nReduced Barriers to Health Care Funds for the Poor  \n\nHealth and Nutrition Promoted in Ethnic Minority Communes \n\n \n \n \n50. \nTargeting  about  100  poor  and  ethnic  minority  communities,  the  Project  will  promote \nhealth and nutrition for women and children through behavior change communication.  This will \ninvolve the orientation of 830 local leaders and skills training of 100 CHS staff and 200 VHWs or \nother community members. The focus of the program will be on community priorities, such as \nreproductive health and nutrition care, and accessing health services and the HCFP (para. 51). \nThe  Project  will  use  a  participatory  approach  to  develop  innovative,  creative,  and  culturally \nappropriate  health  and  nutrition  promotion  activities.  A  nongovernment  organization  will  be \ncontracted to provide technical support. \n \n \n \n51. \nProject  support  for  Decision  139  is  intended  to  reduce  the  financial  barriers  to  health \ncare services for poor and ethnic minority households in the SCCR provinces by (i) increasing \nawareness  of  Decision  139  among  the  intended  beneficiaries  and  other  local  stakeholders, \n(ii) strengthening  capacity  in  the  SCCR  provinces  to  manage  the  provincial  HCFP,  and \n(iii) providing data and analysis to inform future policy making by the MOH related to Decision \n139. The Project will support preparation and dissemination of locally appropriate materials and \nlocal  governments,  mass \nprograms \norganizations, and health workers about the entitlements and requirements of Decision 139. It \nwill help improve procedures for issuing and replacing health insurance cards for beneficiaries,17 \nstreamline  procedures  and  forms  related  to  HCFP  claims  and  disbursements,  and  train  local \nhealth  administrators  and  Viet  Nam  social  security  staff  related  to  these  procedures.  It  will \nsupport improved coordination and problem solving related to Decision 139 at provincial, district, \nand commune levels, as well as in monitoring the implementation and impact of Decision 139 \nthrough  regular  data  collection  by  the  PHB,  participatory  assessments,  and  special  studies \n(Supplementary Appendix A).  \n \n \n \nDuring  project  preparation,  the  provinces  were  assisted  in  preparing  comprehensive \n52. \nprovincial  health  plans.  The  Project  will  help  strengthen  the  capacity  of  provincial  health \ndepartments and hospitals to better manage their increasingly complex responsibilities to plan, \nmanage,  monitor,  and  finance  the  provincial  health  system.  Managers  need  to  become  more \nresults-oriented  by  establishing  minimum  service  standards,  setting  performance  targets,  and \nmonitoring progress toward reaching their objectives. The Project will support (i) strengthening \nthe management of provincial health systems; (ii) strengthening the management of provincial \nand district hospitals; (iii) providing equipment, software, and staff training needed to introduce \nthe HMIS; and (iv) operating the national project management unit (PMU) and provincial PMUs \n(PPMUs). \n \n \n \n53. \nThe  Project  will  assist  provincial  health  authorities  in  evaluating  their  priorities  to  help \nclose the gap between program obligations and financial resources using a team approach. A \nseries  of  workshops  will  be  planned  for  48  provincial  and  district  managers,  focusing  on \nteam  building,  supervision, \nplanning, \n                                                 \n17 The validity of the health insurance cards issued to Decision 139 beneficiaries in the project provinces will also be \n\nStrengthened Provincial Health Systems Management \n\nOutput 4: Strengthened Provincial Health Systems \n\ninformation-based  problem  solving, \n\nleadership, \n\n4.  \n\na.  \n\n \n\nextended from 1 year to at least 2 years. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13\n\ncommunication, financial management, and project monitoring. Efforts will be made to improve \nmanagement  tools  for  managing  subsystems.  Over  the  life  of  the  Project,  the  annual  plan  will \nbecome  a  key  tool  for  managing  and  monitoring  the  performance  of  the  provincial  health \nsystem,  and  provincial  health  officers  will  become  increasingly  results-oriented  and  skilled  in \nmanaging  their  complex  responsibilities.  The  Project  will  also  provide  16  scholarships  to \nindividuals  from  the  eight  provinces  selected  on  the  basis  of  merit  to  attend  a  postgraduate \nprogram in health system management.   \n \n\n \n\n \n\nb. \n\nStrengthened Hospital Management \n\n \n\n \n54. \nThe  Project  will  support  short,  skills-based  training  programs  designed  to  upgrade  the \nskills of 106 senior hospital managers (one per hospital) and 200 hospital department managers \n(two  per  hospital)  in  planning,  information-based  problem  solving,  leadership,  team  building, \nsupervision,  communication,  financial  management,  and  project  monitoring.  The  Project  will \nsupport  on-site  sessions  on  organizational  development  designed  to  help  identify  minimum \nstandards of service, develop performance targets, prepare work plans, and design a system to \nmonitor and report progress.  \n  \n \n \n The  Project  will  strengthen  HMISs  in  provincial  and  selected  district  offices  and \n55. \n40 hospitals  in  the  target  provinces  using  existing  data  collection  systems  to  provide  more \naccurate  and  timely  information  on  health  services  usage,  personnel  records,  and  financial \naccounts.  Under  a  United  Nations  Population  Fund  project,  software  and  detailed  plans  for \nimproved HMISs have been successfully developed and implemented in several districts of Binh \nDinh.  Based  on  that  model,  similar  systems  will  be  adapted  for  implementation  in  selected \ninstitutions in the eight provinces. HMISs will be computerized at provincial level and in at least \n50% of district health facilities linked through the internet. The Project will support the costs of \ncomputers, associated software, other HMIS office equipment, plus planning and training.  \n\nBetter Health Management Information Systems \n\nc.  \n\n \n\nd. \n\nEffective Project Management Support \n\n \n \n \nThe Project will finance the purchase of vehicles, computers, software, office equipment \n56. \nand supplies needed to establish and operate PPMUs in each of the eight target provinces plus \na national PMU. The PPMUs will be the principal units for implementation in each province and \nwill  be  provided  training  in  project  implementation.  The  national  PMU  will  provide  technical, \ncoordination,  and  logistics  support  to  the  PPMUs  and  other  departments  in  charge  of \nimplementation,  including  computerized  financial  management.  The  Project  will  also  support \nbaseline and end-of-project household and health services surveys to evaluate the progress of \nthe sector and project impact in the targeted provinces.    \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n57. \nThe  project  design  is  based  on  5-year  plans  for  comprehensive  provincial  health \nsystems  development  as  a  building  block  toward  the  national  sector  approach.  Each  province \nhas  prepared  a  provincial  health  account,  5-year  provincial  plan,  and  expenditure  framework. \nWhile  this  planning  process  needs  to  be  strengthened  further,  it  provides  a  good  basis  for \nharmonizing aid at provincial level.    \n \n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\nHealth  management  is  increasingly  complex,  and  managers,  most  of  them  medical \n58. \ndoctors, are not prepared for the task. The Project will strengthen health management in critical \nareas of provincial health system planning and budgeting, hospital management, HRD planning, \nmanaging the HCFP, financial management, managing civil works, and waste management.   \n \n59. \nDeveloping the provincial planning and management capacities will require a strong link \nbetween  MOH  and  the  provinces  for  policy  guidance,  field  studies,  and  provincial feedback  to \ncontribute to policy formulation. A budget for supporting MOH in these areas has been included.   \n      \nD. \n\n  \nProject Investment Plan  \n\nThe total project cost is currently estimated at $80.0 million, including taxes and duties of \n\n60. \n$1.87 million (Table 1).

MOH  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  Project.  The  provincial  people\u2019s \ncommittee (PPC) in each of the eight provinces will be the implementing agencies and will be \nrepresented  by  the  PHB.  MOH  will  establish  a  project  steering  committee  to  review  project \nprogress  and  provide  directions  on a  quarterly basis,  as  well  as  to approve  the  annual  report, \nplan, and budget. It will be headed by the vice-minister of health and include senior officials, as \nrequired,  from  MOH  departments,  provinces,  and  other  ministries.  Similar  oversight  will  be \nprovided by the PPC at provincial level.  \n \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  through  a  national  PMU  in  MOH  and  eight  PPMUs  in \n63. \nthe respective PHBs. The PMU will work under the project steering committee\u2019s guidance and \nbe  responsible  for  overall  project  management.  It  will  have  six  responsibility  areas:  (i)  project \nplanning,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  studies,  and  social  safeguards;  (ii)  civil  works  and \nenvironmental  safeguards;  (iii)  HRD;  (iv)  procurement  and  logistics;  (v) personnel  and \nadministration; and (vi) accounting and disbursement. PMU staff includes a project director, up \nto three deputy directors, a monitoring and evaluation expert, a study coordinator, an engineer, \na  medical  equipment  expert,  a  training  expert,  an  administrator,  and  an  accountant.  MOH \ndepartments  will  be  made  responsible  to  support  the  technical  aspects  of  the  Project.  The \nDepartment  of  Medical  Equipment  and  Construction  will  support  output  1,  the  Department  of \nScience  and  Training  will  support  output  2,  the  Department  of  Preventive  Medicine  and \nEnvironment  will  support  output  3,  and  the  Department  of  Planning  and  Finance  will  support \noutput 4. Additional experts may be contracted for defined periods to do project work. If MOH \nstaff is not available, national experts will be contracted.    \n \n64. \nIn each project province, the PPMU will be responsible for project implementation. Each \nPPMU  will  have  similar  responsibility  areas  as  the  PMU.  The  PPMU  will  work  under  the \nguidance of the PPC, with technical support of the PMU, and will be headed by the director or \ndeputy  director  of  the  PHB.  Each  PPMU  will  have  a  full-time  deputy  director  for  planning, \nadministration, coordination, and monitoring; an engineer; a community development expert; a \nprocurement officer; and an accountant. Local leaders, staff, and beneficiaries will be involved in \ndecision making through various consultative mechanisms.  \n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\n3. \n\n2. \n\nProcurement \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe Project will be implemented over an estimated 5-year period, beginning 1 January \n\n \n \n65. \n2009 and ending 31 December 2013. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 5. \n \n \n \n66. \nEach participating province will prepare an annual procurement plan and submit it for the \nMOH\u2019s  approval  before  the  start  of  the  fiscal  year.  All  ADB-financed  procurement  will  be  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nProcurement  of  goods  will  use  international  competitive  bidding  procedures  if  over  $1  million, \nnational competitive bidding if $1 million or less, or shopping if less than $100,000. Civil works \nwill  use  international  competitive  bidding  procedures  if  over  $4  million,  national  competitive \nbidding if $4 million or less, or shopping if less than $100,000. Vehicles will be procured through \nthe  United  Nations,  using  procurement  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  procurement  plan \nwith indicative contract packages is in Appendix 6.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n67. \nThe  Project  will  require  9  international  consultants  for  a  total  of  70  person-months, \n12 national  consultants  for  a  total  of  302  person-months,  a  nongovernment  organization  for \n48 months, and short-term national consultants for a total of 12 person-months. MOH will recruit \nas  individual  consultants  one  international  engineering  and  environmental  specialist;  national \nexperts  in  project  management,  resettlement,  environmental  and  waste  management,  and \nHMIS; and the short-term consultants. All other consultants will be hired through three firms in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime),  using  a  simplified  technical  proposal  and  quality  and  cost-based  selection.  Capacity \nbuilding  of  counterparts  is  included  in  the  assignment  of  consultants.  The  indicative  terms  of \nreference for consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix C. \n\n \n5. \n\nTraining \n\n \n \n68. \nis in Appendix 7, and the training framework and activities is in Supplementary Appendix B.    \n \n\nThe Project supports a substantial HRD program. The indicative list of training activities \n\n6. \n\nAdvance Action  \n\n \n69.  MOH  will  take  advance  action,  including  to  establish  the  PMU  and  hire  consultants  to \nprepare  for  project  implementation.  ADB  concurrence  with  advance  action  and  retroactive \nfinancing does not commit it to finance the Project or related expenditures under the Project. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n70. \nThe  project  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  MOH  will  open  a  national \nproject  imprest  account,  and  each  of  the  eight  PHBs  a  second-generation  imprest  account \n(SGIA), to manage project funds at any bank that is acceptable to ADB. The initial amount to be \ndeposited by ADB in the national project imprest account will be based on the estimated project \nexpenditure to be paid out of the imprest account for the first 6 months of project implementation \nor $4,000,000, whichever is lower. Similarly, the SGIA advances will be based on the estimated \nprovincial expenditures to be paid out of the imprest accounts for the first 6 months of project \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\nis \n\nlower.  The  statement-of-expenditure  (SOE) \nimplementation  or  $250,000,  whichever \nprocedure may be used to reimburse eligible project expenditures and to liquidate or replenish \nimprest  account  advances.  The  SOE  procedure  is  applicable  to  individual  payments  not \nexceeding  $100,000  equivalent  per  payment  and  to  liquidate  advances  made  into  the  imprest \naccount  as  per  covenants.  For  SGIAs,  this  maximum  is  $50,000  equivalent.  MOH  will  ensure \ntimely  release  of  funds  to  the  provincial  accounts.  Detailed  arrangements  to  establish  the \nimprest  account  and  SOE  procedure  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook.  Sufficient  supporting  documentation  must  be  kept  at  each  level  to \nsubstantiate all expenditures paid from the loan proceeds. The release of funds will be subject \nto the project accomplishment reports at the provincial and national levels. \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n71.  MOH and the departments of health in the eight provinces will maintain separate project \nrecords and accounts that are adequate to identify goods and services financed from the ADB \nloan proceeds. The EA has implemented similar projects financed by ADB and others during the \nlast 10 years, and its financial management capacity is considered adequate.  \n\n72. \nThe  Government  of  Viet  Nam  will  annually  audit  all  accounts  and  financial  statements, \nSOEs  and  revenues,  and  imprest  accounts  related  to  the  Project  in  accordance  with  auditing \nstandards  acceptable  to  ADB  and  using  international  accounting  and  auditing  standards  as  a \nbenchmark.  Audited  financial  statements  and  project  accounts,  together  with  the  report  of  the \nauditor, including the auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of loan proceeds, compliance with covenants, \nand the use of the imprest account and SOE procedures, will be submitted within 6 months of \nthe close of the financial year.   \n\n73.  MOH,  as  the  EA,  will  provide  ADB  with  an  inception  report  and  updated  project \nadministration  memorandum  within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness.  Thereafter,  MOH  and  the \nprovinces  will  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  and  annual  progress  reports  and  plans  for  project \nimplementation within 30 days of each calendar quarter period. The progress reports and plans \nwill be in English and summarize (i) PMU capacity, coordination, and issues; (ii) progress made \nagainst established targets, including quality; (iii) problems encountered in project activities and \nactions  taken  to  resolve  issues;  (iv)  compliance  with  loan  covenants,  including  provision  of \ncounterpart funds; (v) updated implementation schedule of activities for the next 3 months; and \n(vi) financial statements including operations and maintenance support.  \n \n\n9. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n74. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government,  EA,  and  implementing  agencies.  No  reports  of  major  audit  issues  or \nsuspicion  of  fraud  arose  under  these  agencies\u2019  previous  projects.  Consistent  with  its \ncommitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to \ninvestigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices relating to the Project. Relevant provisions of the Anticorruption Policy are included in \nthe  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts \nfinanced  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of \nADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project.   \n \n75.  MOH  has  handled  10  ADB  projects  and  is  familiar  with  ADB  procedures  and \nanticorruption  measures.  These  projects  helped  establish  clear  procedures  and  practices  for \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\n10. \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement \n\nprocuring equipment and civil works. Based on experiences in previous projects, however, the \nquality of civil works needs to be carefully monitored. The project design includes several layers \nof  supervision,  including  an  independent  international  engineer  to  oversee  construction  and \nenvironmental  issues.  Any  governance  risk  will  be  further  minimized  by  providing  detailed \nproject  information  on  a  project  website,  using  detailed  procurement  plans,  making  regular \nproject  reviews,  and  providing  information  and  training  for  MOH  staff  not  familiar  with  ADB\u2019s \npolicy and procedures. Spot-checking will also be done to check adherence to the policy.   \n \n \n \n76. \nThe Project is expected to acquire 186,141 square meters of land, excluding the sites for \n5 DPMCs, which will be identified during implementation. At the assessed sites, 112 households \n(499  people)  will  be  affected  by  the  Project,  52  households  will  lose  more  than  10%  of  their \nproductive  land,  and  32  households  will  be  required  to  relocate.  A  full  resettlement  plan  has \nbeen  prepared  for  the  subprojects  where  sites  have  been  identified,  and  a  resettlement \nframework has been prepared to guide any resettlement or land acquisition that may occur for \nthe  DPMCs  and  any  other  subprojects  identified  during  implementation  (Supplementary \nAppendix D). The base cost of land acquisition and resettlement activities is estimated at $0.86 \nmillion. All households will be compensated for their losses at full replacement costs and current \nmarket  value.  Residential  and  employment  arrangements  will  be  restored  to  pre-project \nstandards, if not better. As detailed designs of civil works are finalized and approved, MOH, with \nthe assistance of the PHBs, will be required to revise and update the resettlement plans for all \ncivil  works.  MOH  will  be  responsible  for  approving  the  resettlement  plans  and  supervising  all \nresettlement-related issues. The summary resettlement plan and framework is in Appendix 9.     \n \n\nEthnic Minorities\u2014Consultation and Participation \n\n11. \n \n77. \nThe  Project  falls  into  indigenous  people  impact  category  A.  Specific  activities  directly \ntargeting ethnic groups as beneficiaries have been mainstreamed in the Project, which therefore \nserves as the ethnic minority development plan. An ethnic minority strategy (Appendix 12) has \nbeen developed to (i) ensure that ethnic minorities are consulted, participate, and benefit from \nthe project throughout project implementation; and (ii) guide the implementation of information, \neducation,  and  participation  methodologies  so  that  they  are  sustainable  and  appropriately \ntargeted to ethnic minority needs. The ethnic minority strategy is based on (i) consultations with \nethnic  minorities,  government  officials,  local  organizations,  and  other  key  stakeholders;  and \n(ii) secondary  sources  and  past  ADB  projects.  The  strategy  is  in  accordance  with  current  Viet \nNam regulations and complies with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998).  \n \n \n \nThe  Project  is  placed  in  category  B.  Mainly  beneficial  impacts  are  expected  from  the \n78. \nProject,  as  it  will  support  the  construction,  rehabilitation,  and  operation  of  health  facilities, \nincluding  improvement  in  water,  sanitation,  and  waste  management  systems.  However,  the \nconstruction of hospitals will cause disturbances and some resettlement. Several facilities have \nold  asbestos  roofing  materials,  and  these  will  be  removed  following  international  practices  to \nprotect  workers  and  residents  as  outlined  in  the  environmental  assessment  and  review \nprocedure  (EARP).  Even  though  project  impacts  are  overwhelmingly  positive,  some  negative \nimpacts are likely because pollution is essentially being concentrated in the health facilities and \nemitted through point sources. There is also a risk that facilities constructed under the Project \nwill pose future health hazards due to poor maintenance, lack of supplies, or other reasons. The \nsite selection, design, construction, replacement work, and operation of health facilities will be \n\nEnvironment \n\n12. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19\n\nimplemented in accordance with the relevant regulations and standards of the Government, as \nrequired under ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). The Project will also support the development \nof environmental management plans and a waste management plan for each hospital involved \nin  construction  or  renovation.  At  this  time,  final  specifications  of  project  components  have  not \nbeen  determined.  As  such,  the  project  has  been  treated  as  a  sector-like  project  loan  for \npurposes  of  the  environmental  assessment,  and  the  initial  environmental  examination  and  an \nEARP  have  been  prepared  to  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  for  sector  loans.  The  summary \ninitial  environmental examination for the Project is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n\n13. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n79. \nIn  support  of  developing  a  comprehensive  provincial  program  approach,  the  project \nperformance  monitoring  system  will  be  integrated  with  and  strengthen  the  Government\u2019s \nprovincial HMIS (output 4). MOH will contract out health and health services surveys in the first \nand fifth project year to assess the performance of the provincial health system. Measurement \nof outputs, activities, and inputs will be disaggregated by source of funding. Particular attention \nwill  be  given  to  monitoring  impacts  on  the  poor,  women,  children,  ethnic  groups,  and  other \nvulnerable groups. Qualitative studies will be undertaken for particular aspects (Appendix 8).  \n \n\n14. \n\nProject Review \n\n80. \nThe  Government  and  ADB  will  jointly  review  project  implementation  twice  a  year, \nincluding related national policy activities and provincial planning, budgeting, and reforms. They \nwill undertake a joint midterm review after 2 years of project implementation. Within 3 months of \nphysical  completion  of  the  Project,  the  Government  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  a  project \ncompletion report on the project execution, including compliance with loan covenants. \n \n\nIV.  \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n1.   \n\nSocial Benefits \n\nProject Benefits and Impact \n\nA. \n \n \n \n81. \nFour  of  the  eight  project  provinces  have  poverty  levels  significantly  above  the  national \naverage  of  19.5%,  including  Ninh  Thuan  at  45.0%,  Quang  Nam  at  36.3%,  Quang  Ngai  at \n36.1%,  and  Binh  Dinh  at  28.3%.  The  Project  contributes  directly  to  poverty  reduction  by \nimproving access and quality of health services used by the poor, in particular district hospitals \nand VHWs. Improved health reduces income losses and expenditures due to illness or disease, \nand it indirectly protects the labor force and production of food and cash crops. Under output 1, \nthe  20  supported  hospitals  represent  19%  of  all  hospitals  in  the  region,  and  the  supported \ndistrict hospitals will directly benefit 1.7 million people, or 19% of the total population. Output 2 \nwill  improve  the  quality  of  health  personnel  throughout  the  project  area  and  increase  health \nworkers  from  ethnic  communes  by  providing  scholarships.  Output  3  aims  to  provide  village \nhealth care for 423 remote communes out of a total of 1,024 communes, including most of the \n223 communes classified as poor and most of the estimated 250 ethnic minority communes. Of \nthese, 100 ethnic minority communes will receive intensified health and nutrition promotion and \nthe  ability  to  better  access  to  HCFP.  To  help  grow  the  number  of  women  and  ethnic  minority \nhealth workers and beneficiaries, each province will be assisted to develop gender and ethnic \nminority  action  plans  as  part  of  the  5-year  and  annual  plans.  The  summary  poverty  reduction \nand social strategy is in Appendix 10, the gender analysis and action plan in Appendix 11, and \nthe ethnic minority strategy in Appendix 12. \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n\n3. \n\n2.   \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\nHealth System Development \n\n \n \n82. \nThe  Project  will  support  the  provincial  governments  in  the  eight  targeted  provinces  to \nimprove their respective provincial health systems. Each provincial government was assisted to \nprepare  provincial  health  accounts,  a  comprehensive  medium-term  health  plan,  and  a  budget \nusing a participatory approach. This analysis and synthesis will strengthen provincial efforts to \nimprove  provincial  health  systems  within  the  resource  envelope  based  on  national  goals  and \npolicies, provincial priorities, and international good practices. The process is expected to result \nin a comprehensive provincial health program that is results-based, pro-poor, and well balanced \nacross  levels  and  services.  Such  plans  will  help  clarify  purpose,  improve  transparency,  set \npriorities,  improve  budgeting,  coordinate  investments,  and  monitor  outcomes.  MOH  is  keen  to \nstandardize  this  approach  and  apply  it  in  other  provinces,  and  the  Project  will  continue  to \nsupport the approach in the targeted provinces to strengthen provincial health systems, address \nthe  needs  of  vulnerable  groups,  improve  service  delivery,  and  as  a  building  block  toward  a \nsector-wide approach and aid harmonization.  \n \nThe Project will support policy development in four areas: (i) updating national standards \n83. \nfor the design and equipping of hospitals, (ii) developing a provincial HRD system, (iii) managing \nHCFP,  and  (iv)  provincial-level  planning  and  management.  The  Project  will  support  MOH  to \nprovide policy support and learn from experiences in the provinces.    \n \n \n \n84. \nThe quantitative cost-benefit analysis for the Project follows the methodologies outlined \nin ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects (1997). Economic benefits may flow \nfrom  reduced  health  care  costs  through  gains  in  labor  productivity  resulting  from  decreased \nincidence and severity of illness. Out-of-pocket cost savings may flow from (i) increased access \nto health services that reduce transport costs, and (ii) more efficient and rational diagnoses and \ntreatments that reduce treatment costs. An important cost factor is that caring for sick children \nalso reduces adult productivity. The Project is estimated to reduce lost workdays by an annual \naverage 6.5 million in the SCCR, valued at nearly $14 million per year. The economic internal \nrate of return from this impact is estimated at 19%, and an economic net present value of $20.1 \nmillion is calculated. The economic and financial analysis is in Supplementary Appendix F.   \n \nB. \n \nThe provincial budget is the most important of the public sector contributions, as direct \n85. \ncentral  budget  support  for  public  health  sector  is  relatively  minor.  Allocations  are  driven  by \neconomic  growth  and  tax  revenues.  Changing  political  priorities  may  also  reduce  the  sector \nallocation.  Within  the  overall  sector  allocation,  provincial  governments  also  make  strategic \ndecisions on the balance of investments that affect the impacts of provincial health systems and \nthe Project. The Project supports policy links with MOH and provincial planning and budgeting \nto guide provinces toward results-based health system development to achieve more effective, \nequitable, and efficient health systems and to monitor this closely. The process is also expected \nto contribute to the national sector approach and aid harmonization.   \n \n86. \nSeveral  project  activities  such  as  improving  the  quality  of  hospital  construction,  waste \nmanagement  systems,  and  skills  training  of  health  staff  are  technically  challenging.  MOH  will \nmanage the recruitment and fielding of all consultants to ensure that adequate technical support \ncan be provided to all provinces on an as-needed basis.   \n \n\nProject Assumptions and Risks \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n21\n\n87.  While  substantial  experience  has  been  gained  in  managing  the  procurement  system, \nsome  delay  in  procurement  is  expected.  Advance  action  will  help  mitigate  this  risk,  and  MOH \nhas selected project counterpart staff that has experience in project procurement.      \n \nIn  terms  of  financial  sustainability  of  the  project,  operational  expenditures  were \n88. \nestimated  to  add  on  average  2.3%  of  provincial  recurrent  health  expenditures  after  project \ncompletion. The provinces have committed to provide adequate recurrent budget for operations \nand maintenance.   \n   \n\nV.  \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n89. \nassurances, which are incorporated into the legal documents: \n\n(i)  Provincial  governments  will  submit  to  MOH  and  ADB  (a)  updated  5-year  plans  and \nMTEFs  by  June  2009,  (b)  annual  provincial  health  plans  and  budgets,  and  (c)  annual \nprovincial work plans for the Project. All these are to be based on a format agreed by the \nparties and will serve as a basis for monitoring performance and allocating funds. \n\n(ii)  Complementary to project investment, MOH has committed, starting in 2009, to provide \n\nadditional support for CHSs and for PHC generally to the project provinces.   \n\n(iii)  Each  province  will  ensure  that  the  annual  HRD  plan  as  developed  under  output  2  will \ntake  into  account  national  policy  initiatives,  including  licensure,  certification,  and \ncontinuing  education,  and  will  include  targeted  strategies  to  increase  th  number  of \nfemale and ethnic minority health workers in targeted communities.  \n\n(iv)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  ADB  loan  funds  are  transferred  to  MOH  and  the \nprovincial  department  of  health,  that  all  necessary  counterpart  funds  for  project \nimplementation are provided in a timely manner, and that reimbursements are made in a \ntimely manner.  \n\n(v)  Each province will ensure that the annual budget allocation to the sector fully covers the \noperation  and  maintenance  of  all  health  facilities,  including  project-supported  facilities, \nbased on projections agreed with MOH.  \n\n(vi)  Each province will ensure that the project gender action plan is included in the updated \n5-year  plan  and  MTEFs  and  that  specific  actions  and  targets  are  included  in  the \nprovincial annual operating plans.

Public  health  administration  is \nconcerned  with  planning  and  budgeting,  management  of  the  health  system,  and  monitoring \nperformance.  It  also  has  a  role  in  accreditation  and  inspection  of  private  services.  Preventive \nand hospital services are mostly public. Private services mainly contribute to curative outpatient \ncare. About 30,000 private clinics operate nationwide.2 In addition to registered pharmacies and \ndrug shops, there are an unknown number of unregistered providers.   \n  \n4. \nIn  2006,  Viet  Nam  had  942  public  hospitals  and  43  private  hospitals  with  a  total  of \n197,686 beds in all health facilities including 132,381 beds in hospitals, or 16 hospital beds per \n10,000  people. 3  The  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH)  managed  21  large  hospitals,  while  local \nauthorities managed 921 hospitals (207 specialized, 117 provincial, and 597 district hospitals). \nThe  country  also  had  838  polyclinics  and  10,679  commune  health  stations  (CHSs)  linked  to \nvillage health workers (VHWs). Seventy percent of hospitals have fewer than 100 beds. The 43 \nprivate hospitals account for 4.1% of all hospitals and 2.4% of patient beds.  \n \n5. \nPreventive  activities  have  been  centered  at  the  commune  level.  In  recent  years, \nhowever,  and  stimulated  by  the  increasing  prevalence  of  HIV/AIDS  and  emerging  diseases, \nMOH  developed  a  nationwide  system  of  provincial  preventive  medicine  centers.  It  has  also \nadopted a plan to establish separate district preventive medicine centers (DPMCs). The DPMCs \nwould primarily be responsible for infectious diseases control, food safety, certain reproductive \nhealth services, and environmental health. These facilities receive direct support from MOH.   \n \n6. \nThe  network  of  health  services  provides  good  coverage  of  essential  services  with  the \nsupport  of  vertical  programs.  For  example,  98%  of  children  under  1  year  of  age  are  fully \nimmunized and 96% of deliveries are attended by a trained health worker. However, there are \nalso gaps. Table A2.3 shows that the poor know less about prevention, use services less often, \nand are more dependent on VHWs. It also shows, if these statistics are correct, that there is an \noverdependence on hospitals as the first contact, including in SCCR. Reliable provincial health \nservices  indicators  are  not  available.  According  to  MOH,  the  provincial  data  are  not \nrepresentative  and  are  inaccurate.4 The  data  provided  in  Table  A2.4,  therefore,  need  to  be \ninterpreted with caution. While there is no doubt that coverage with services is high, it is quite \npossible  that  it  is  actually  somewhat  lower  than  these  data  suggest,  in  particular  when \nconsidering the minorities living in the remote mountain areas in the coastal provinces.    \n \nC. \n \nWhile appreciating the sector\u2019s gains, the Government recognizes the major challenges \n7. \nfacing the sector due to changing demand and residual pockets of high mortality. The Political \nBureau\u2019s Resolution No. 46 of 2005 calls for adjusting the health system to the modern market \neconomy.  The  Government  has  approved  a  range  of  policies  and  plans  to  help  reform  the \nhealth sector. For example, Decree No. 139 of 2002 and Decree No. 63 of 2005 helped finance \nhealth  care  coverage  for  the  poor.  Decision  No.  225  of  2005  approved  the  district  and \ninterdistrict hospitals program.

A \nprovincial hospital covers a relatively small population of about 1 million people and is therefore \ncomparable  to  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  concept  of  the  district  hospital  with  a \nlimited range of specialty services. The bed:population ratio for provincial hospitals is therefore \nan  important  indicator,  and  it  is  about  8  per  10,000  people.  That  is  slightly  higher  than  the \nnational average. Da Nang has more provincial  beds due to its regional function. Quang Nam \nand Quang Ngai have relatively few provincial hospital beds.  \n \n\nTable A2.6: Public Health Infrastructure in the South Central Coast Region \n\nProvincial Hospitals \n\nDistrict \n\nMOH \nHospitals \n\nArea \nViet Nam \nSCCR \nDa Nang \nQuang Nam \nQuang Ngai \nBinh Dinh \nPhu Yen \nKhanh Hoa \nNinh Thuan \nBinh Thuan \nCHS = commune health station, MOH = Ministry of Health, SCCR = south central coast region. \nSource: Ministry of Health.

Planning  the  upgrading  and  new  construction  of  public \nhospitals  is  challenging,  given  the  increasing  demand  for  high  level  quality  care,  improving \nphysical  and  financial  access,  and  expected  deregulation  of  private  hospital  development  by \n2010.  Bypassing  of  district  hospitals  is  thought  to  be  common,  although  firm  statistics  are \nlacking. A major reason is thought to be the lack of specialty services. MOH wants to address \nthe  shortage  of  provincial  hospital  beds  with  specialty  services  by  upgrading  certain  district \nhospitals to regional hospitals serving 2\u20133 districts. However, such regional hospitals are often \nproposed along main roads in low population areas where land is available. Furthermore, new \ndistrict  hospitals  are  sometimes  being  planned  in  suburban  areas  near  provincial  hospitals. \nGiven the tendency to bypass smaller facilities, some form of gatekeeping may be required to \nensure proper use of facilities at all levels. Inpatient stay is particularly long in the SCCR, which \nis  believed  to  be  linked  to  financial  incentives  rather  than  case  mix.  While  there  is  an  overall \nshortage of hospital beds in the country, including in the SCCR, current facilities could be better \nused by introducing such a gatekeeping system and also by shortening inpatient stays. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nAppendix 2 \n\n        31\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHealth Workforce \n\n \n10.  MOH estimates that only 50% of hospitals meet 80% or more of prescribed equipment \nstandards.  Just  5%  of  hospitals  have  modern  X-ray  equipment,  and  30%  of  hospitals  have \nreceived overseas development assistance. MOH has set out criteria to guide the modernization \nand standardization of curative services. There is a standard list of equipment for every type of \nhealth  facility.  Given  increasing  demand  for  high-quality  health  care,  this  includes  certain \nequipment  for  advanced  diagnostics,  in  particular  for  cardiovascular  diseases,  cancer,  and \ntrauma.  In  any  hospital  project,  waste  management  systems  and  practices  will  need  to  be \nbrought up to current standards, and staff will need to be trained to implement these systems.    \n \nE. \n \n11. \nThe  departments  of  science  and  training,  organization  and  personnel,  and  therapy, \nalong  with  provincial  health  bureaus,  universities,  secondary  medical  schools  (SMSs),  and \nothers, are working together to develop a comprehensive human resource development (HRD) \npolicy and to strengthen workforce planning, management, and training (footnote 2, p.48). There \nhas  been  significant  decentralization  of  responsibility  for  managing  the  health  workforce  over \nrecent  years.  Each  provincial  health  department  prepares  an  annual  plan  including  HRD,  and \nparticularly training, consistent with the guidelines provided by MOH. Provinces lack the skills to \nplan and manage HRD in an increasingly complex health environment, however, and also lack \nthe  analytical  capacity  to  examine  specific  HRD  issues.  This  will  require  strong  collaboration \nwith  MOH.  Additional  research  will  be  required  to  support  the  HRD  plan.  However,  local \nresearch grants rarely get used for researching health systems and policy, as they are directed \nto clinical studies.5   \n \nOver the past 5 years, the MOH workforce has grown at 2.28% per year,6 compared to a \n12. \npopulation growth of 1.37% per annum.7 However, the health care workforce in the SCCR grew \nonly by 0.02% in this period. Nationally in 2005, there were 0.6 doctors per 1,000 population, up \nfrom 0.4 in 1993. However, there were only 0.63 nurses per 1,000 population, similar to the 0.62 \nin  1993.8 The  ratio  of  nurses  to  doctors  was  only  1.3,  compared  to  the  WHO  standard  of  4\u20135 \nnurses per doctor (footnote 2, p. 13). Commendably, 94.8% of Viet Nam\u2019s 10,679 CHSs have at \nleast one trained health worker, often a midwife, and 70% have a doctor.9 While most deliveries \nare attended by a trained health worker, this is less common in the remote areas where most \nmaternity  deaths  occur.  In  June  2007,  new  staffing  targets  were  set.  To  boost  the  number  of \ndoctors to the target of 0.7 per 1,000 population and achieve the ratio of 3.5 nurses per doctor, \nthe workforce would need to grow at a combined 3.6% per annum. That is much faster than the \ncurrent growth of the entire workforce.10  \n \n13. \nThe distribution of health staff is inequitable, with poor provinces and rural areas unable \nto attract enough staff to meet MOH guidelines. At district level, there is often lack of specialists \n(e.g.,  obstetrics  and  gynecology). 11  SCCR  provinces  reported  staff  shortages  at  all  levels, \nparticularly  at  commune  level.12 Gender  imbalances  also  exist  in  the  health  workforce.  While \n\n                                                 \n5  WHO. 2006. Rapid Health System Assessment: Viet Nam. Ha Noi (p. 15). \n6  In 2005, the Government employed 259,583 staff in the health sector. About 12% work at the central level, 31% at \nprovincial  level,  25%  at  district  level,  and  19%  at  commune  level.  About  18%  of  hospital  workers  are  contractual \nstaff.  \n\n7  MOH. 2005. Health Statistics Yearbook, 2005. Ha Noi. \n8  MOH. 2007. Viet Nam Health Report 2006.

Most women are nurses or other secondary level staff and comprise only 30% of \npostgraduate  degree  holders  and  39%  of  medical  doctors  or  pharmacists  (footnote  7).  The \nrepresentation  of  ethnic  minorities  in  the  health  workforce  varies  greatly  in  different  provinces \n(footnote 11, p.125). Barriers include lack of required education, language, and training costs.  \n \n14.  Where staff is available, there is ample evidence of gaps in knowledge and skills. Most \nnonmedical  staff  are  trained  at  SMSs,  which  exist  in  all  the  SCCR  provinces  except  for  Ninh \nThuan. These SMSs are also responsible for most in-service training. The education in an SMS \nis demanding but rather theoretical and traditional, and it lacks feedback from the workplace.13 \nMaking  teaching  more  skills-based  requires  teachers  to  adopt  active  teaching  and  learning \nmethodologies and develop appropriate curricula and teaching resources (footnote 11, p.135). \nMost teachers lack postgraduate training, and their skills also need upgrading.14  \n \n15. \nThere are no established continuing education standards for staff at any level, including \ndoctors.  There  is  no  planned  approach  for  updating  on  new  treatment  regimes  (footnote  11, \np.136).  There  are  also  no  established  guidelines  for  professional  licensure  or  institutional \naccreditation, although policies addressing these issues are in development.15 The Government \nhas  stated  its  intent  to  introduce  policies  on  continuing  education  for  those  already  in  the \nworkforce.16 However, funding will be an issue for this proposed training. \n\n \nAccess to Services \n\nF. \n \n16. \nFor the rural poor, access to health care remains problematic. Maternal deaths illustrate \nthe  problem.  While  maternal  deaths  also  reflect  the  risks  of  living  in  remote  areas,  nearly  half \nwere  due  to  delays  in  decision  making,  identifying  mothers  at  risk,  and  providing  essential \ntreatment.17 Ethnic minorities tend to seek health services less often. Customs, language, and \nliteracy also have an impact, and especially for minority women, of which one in four is unable \nto read. Public education on common health problems and services has often not been adjusted \nto the special needs of disadvantaged groups. A major thrust of the Government\u2019s health sector \nplan  is  to  consolidate  and  complete  the  grassroots  health  network  to  carry  out  primary  health \ncare  services  (footnote  2,  pp.35\u201337).  Plans  include  upgrading  the  facilities,  equipment,  and \nstaffing of CHSs. MOH plans to have 1\u20132 VHWs in each village with at least a primary level of \ntraining  qualification  and  a  doctor  in  80%  of  all  CHSs  by  2010  and  in  100%  by  2020.  There \nshould  be  at  least  one  female  staff  member  in  every  CHS  with  training  in  maternal  care. \nUpgrading the skills of CHS staff and VHWs are priorities for achieving MDGs. \n \n17.  While physical and social factors influence access, affordability of health care is the most \nsignificant constraining factor. The predominance of user fees at all levels of the health system, \ncoupled  with  the  cost  of  drugs  and  indirect  expenses  for  travel  and  accompanying  family \nmembers, can be a devastating financial burden for those surviving at a subsistence level. The \nintroduction  of  health  insurance,  especially  the  health  care  funds  for  the  poor  (HCFP),  is \nbeginning to mitigate these financial burdens. A detailed summary is available in Supplementary \nAppendix A.   \n \n\n                                                 \n13 United Nations Populations Fund and MOH. 2006.

While the HCFP has reduced financial barriers to health care, and consequently led to \nincreases in poor people\u2019s utilization of health services, it has contributed little to improving the \nquality  of  health  facilities,  the  training  and  compensation  of  health  staff,  or  the  supply  of \nequipment  and  drugs  at  health  facilities.  To  achieve  HCFP\u2019s  intended  impact,  these  need \naddressing. The processing of claims and reimbursements for health services provided to HCFP \nbeneficiaries has imposed a considerable burden on administrative staff at hospitals and other \nhealth  facilities.  Delays  in  reimbursements  increase  the  financial  burden  on  health  facilities. \nTherefore, there is a strong argument for streamlining these processes while standardizing and \ncomputerizing claim forms and procedures.   \n       \n \nG. \n \nBeginning in 1996 with the introduction of the State Budget Law, planning and budgeting \n19. \nfunctions for the health sector were gradually devolved to the provincial governments with some \nflexibility for allocation of resources. The provincial governments have authority over provincial \nhealth  services,  the  district  governments  over  district  health  services,  and  communes  over \nvillage  health  care.  MOH  retains  control  over  centrally  managed  preventive  and  commune \nhealth services, national health programs, and research. The Ministry of Finance provides funds \ndirectly  to  the  provinces.  Subsidies  from  the  central  budget  are  also  intended  to  resolve \nimbalances by increasing the financial capacity of poorer provinces.  \n    \n20. \nThe  WHO  calculated  that  total  health  expenditure  per  person  was  D504,000  in  2005. \nViet  Nam\u2019s  public  health  spending  is  still  only  1.5%  of  gross  domestic  product.  Private \nexpenditure  accounts  for  77%  of  total  expenditure.18 A  significant  share  of  private  expenditure \noccurs  at  public  establishments,  with  out-of-pocket  funds  supporting  most  health  spending.  In \nthe  SCCR,  private  expenditure  accounts  for  about  40%\u201350%  of  all  expenditures.  Most  public \nspending  is  associated  with  curative  activities19 at  the  provincial  and  district  levels.  Preventive \nservices comprise only 10\u201320% of overall provincial health expenditure.  \n  \n21. \nDuring project preparation, provincial health accounts, 5-year health sector development \nplans, and medium-term expenditure frameworks were prepared for the eight provinces in order \nto  understand  current  sources  and  uses  of  funds  and  to  plan  for  balanced  investment  as  per \npolicy. The health accounts demonstrated the reliance of provincial health departments on user \nfees and insurance for curative services. The process showed that planning is still input-driven \nrather  than  results-based,  with  a  major  local  priority  for  investment  in  civil  works.  Projected \nexpenditures  during  2006\u20132010  exceeded  resources  in  all  categories  in  all  provinces.  The \nobserved  resource  gaps  and  expenditure  imbalances  demonstrate  the  needs  to  (i)  further \nstrengthen  evidence-based  decision  making,  service  delivery  efficiency,  and  allocative \nefficiency;  (ii) increase  health\u2019s  share  of  overall  public  expenditure;  and  (iii)  mobilize  private \ninvestment. \n\n                                                 \n18World Health Organization. http://www.wpro.who.int/countries/vtn/national_health_priorities.htm \n19 World Bank. 2006.

This emphasizes the importance of \nconducting  provincial  health  accounts  to  document  actual  sources  and  uses  of  funds  and  clarify  assumptions \nregarding  aid  flows  at  the  provincial  level.  Compared  to  these  2005  data  of  the  European  Commission,  only  two \nprovinces confirmed to have received substantial external funding for their respective public health budgets in 2007\u2014\nKhanh Hoa (25.4%) and Quang Ngai (10.5%). External funding for public health budgets in other provinces appears \nto be much less. However, part of external assistance is not passed through the budget, and is largely unknown.  \nSource: European Commission in Viet Nam, 2005. \n\n36 \n\n \n \n\n \nAppendix 3 \n \n\nProvince  \n\nDa Nang \n\n \n \n \n \n \nQuang Nam \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \nQuang Ngai \n \n \n \n \n \nBinh Dinh \n \n \nPhu Yen \n \n \nKhanh Hoa  \n \n \n \n\n1% \n\n11% \n\n1% \n\n1% \n\n25% \n\n \n\n \n\n\fDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \n \nTable A4.1: Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\n \n\nD billion \nLocal \nCurrency\n \n\n \n\nForeign \nExchange\n \n\n$ million \nLocal \nCurrency\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n% of Total \nBase Cost \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n13.8 \n426.2 \n282.9 \n52.6 \n134.8 \n37.0 \n\n56.9 \n32.6 \n27.7 \n 1,064.6 \n \n47.4 \n2.2 \n49.6 \n 1,114.2 \n \n135.0 \n \n31.5 \n 1,280.7 \n\n13.8 \n337.4 \n38.8 \n41.6 \n134.8 \n37.0 \n\n33.4 \n32.6 \n27.7 \n697.2 \n \n42.4 \n2.2 \n44.6 \n741.9 \n \n101.6 \n \n 0.0 \n843.6 \n\n0.0 \n5.5 \n15.3 \n0.7 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n\n1.5 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n23.0 \n \n0.3 \n0.0 \n0.3 \n23.3 \n \n1.9 \n \n2.0 \n27.3 \n\n0.0 \n88.8 \n244.1 \n10.9 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n\n23.4 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n367.3 \n \n5.0 \n0.0 \n5.0 \n372.3 \n \n33.4 \n \n31.5 \n437.2 \n\n0.9 \n21.1 \n2.4 \n2.6 \n8.4 \n2.3 \n\n2.1 \n2.0 \n1.7 \n43.6 \n \n2.6 \n0.1 \n2.8 \n46.4 \n \n6.4 \n \n0.0 \n52.7 \n\n0.9 \n26.6 \n17.7 \n3.3 \n8.4 \n2.3 \n\n3.6 \n2.0 \n1.7 \n66.5 \n \n3.0 \n0.1 \n3.1 \n69.6 \n \n8.4 \n \n2.0 \n80.0 \n\n1.2 \n38.3 \n25.4 \n4.7 \n12.1 \n3.3 \n\n5.1 \n2.9 \n2.5 \n95.5 \n \n4.3 \n0.2 \n4.5 \n100.0 \n \n12.1 \n \n2.8 \n \n\n36                  Appendix 4                  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nInvestment Costs \n1.

The \nProject  supports  the  services  of  an  international  monitoring  and  evaluation  specialist  for \n6 person-months, who will be contracted through a firm.    \n \n2. \nTo  monitor  aggregate  health  impact  and  outcome  of  key  interventions,  the  Project  will \ncollect  provincial  statistics  and  verify  these  through  two  provincial  household  surveys  in  each \nprovince,  in  2008  and  2012,  using  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF)  multi-cluster \nmethod. Although specific indicators will help to assess project impact, the main purpose of the \nsurveys is to provide each province with information on the overall health trend in the province \nas  an  input  into  the  planning  cycle.  The  sample  size  will  be  large  enough  to  provide \ndisaggregated data by residence, income, gender, and ethnic group for each of the provinces. \nThe number of indicators will be kept limited, focused on (i) perinatal, infant, and child mortality; \n(ii) child malnutrition; (iii) episodes and types of illness and injuries; (iv) use of different types of \nhealth  services,  in  particular  by  women  and  children;  and  (v)  expenditure  on  health  services. \nStandard  definitions  and  survey  methods  will  be  used  to  allow  comparison  of  data.  The \nmonitoring and evaluation specialist will be responsible for survey design and management, as \nwell as for guiding the selection of a local firm for data collection.  \n \n3. \nAs  part  of  the  inputs  into  the  provincial  planning  process,  the  Project  will  support  two \nhealth  services  surveys  with  a  focus  on  the  quality  of  health  services.  For  project-specific \ninterventions,  the  Project  will  monitor  hospital  statistics  and  conduct  more  detailed  hospital \nperformance  assessment  and  patient  satisfaction  exit  surveys  before  and  after  any  major  civil \nworks.  To  assess  the  impact  of  the  training  programs  on  staff  performance,  staff  and  village \nhealth workers will be pre- and post-tested, and a sample of staff will be assessed in their duty \nstations.    \n \n4. \nThe  Project  will  support  social  analysis,  with  emphasis  on  poverty,  gender,  and  ethnic \nminority issues. In addition, such qualitative methods as focus group discussions will be used in \nthe areas of health services quality, waste management, health services management, planning \nand budgeting, financial management, and access to health care funds.   \n \nTo  monitor  project  activities,  the  Project  will  use  detailed  Gantt  charts,  which  will  also \n5. \nhelp in preparing, planning, and coordinating the project activities; assessing physical progress; \nand  tracking  inputs.  Detailed  monitoring  of  staff  inputs  and  financial  inputs  using  financial \nmanagement tools will be used to track costs and calculate unit costs. This information will be \nshared and used for planning future interventions. \n \n6. \nmeasure overall provincial progress and major project achievement, as shown in Table A8. \n \n\nSeveral  indicators  have  been  selected  by  the  provinces  and  the  Ministry  of  Health  to \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n \nClassification \n \nImpact \n\n \n\nTable A8: Indicative Performance Indicators \n\nProvincial Indicators \n\n1.

A  full  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  for  the  Project,  covering  the  nine \nsubprojects  in  six  provinces  where  resettlement  impacts  have  been  identified.  A  resettlement \nframework  has  also  been  prepared,  because  the  sites  for  some  subprojects  will  be  identified \nduring project implementation. For each of these subprojects found to require land acquisition or \nresettlement,  a  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  by  the  provincial  project  management  units \n(PPMUs),  under  the  guidance  of  the  provincial  people\u2019s  committee  (PPC)  and  the  Ministry  of \nHealth (MOH).  \n\n2. \nScope  of  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement  Impacts.  Based  on  the  result  of  the \ninventory of losses undertaken, a total of 119 affected parties were identified\u2014112 households \n(499  people),  5  people\u2019s  committees  (1  town  people\u2019s  committee  and  4  commune  people\u2019s \ncommittees),  and  2  state-owned  companies  (1  pharmaceutical  and  1  television  station).  The \nsocioeconomic survey found that there are 20 vulnerable households affected.   \n\n \nTable A9: Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n\nAffected \nPersons \nLosing 10% \nor More of \nProductive \nAssets \n\nHouseholdsb \nto be \nRelocated \n\nAffected \nPersonsa \n\nAffected \nPopulation \n\nEstimated Land \nAcquisition (m2) \n\n \nSites \nI.

The  policy  framework  and  entitlements  have  been \n3.  \ndeveloped from the relevant laws, decrees, and regulations of the Government of Viet Nam and \nADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). The Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Viet \nNam,  1992,  confirms  the  rights  of  citizens  to  own  and  protect  the  ownership  of  a  house.  In \naddition,  the  Government  has  enacted  a  number  of  laws,  decrees,  and  regulations  that \nconstitute the legal framework for land acquisition, compensation, and resettlement. Provisions \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n51\n\n \n\nand  principles  adopted  in  the  resettlement  plans  and  resettlement  framework  will  supplement \nthe provisions of relevant decrees currently in force in Viet Nam wherever a gap exists.  \n \n4. \nPrinciples  of  Resettlement.  The  following  principles  were  formulated  to  bridge  the \ndifferences  between  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  and  the  Government\u2019s  resettlement \npolicies and will apply to all civil works undertaken: \n \n\n(i)  \n\n(ii)  \n\n(iii)  \n\n(iv)  \n\n(v)  \n\n(vi)  \n\nAcquisition  of  land  and  other  assets,  as  well  as  resettlement  of  people,  will  be \navoided  or  minimized  as  much  as  possible  by  identifying  possible  alternative \nproject  designs  and  appropriate  social,  economic,  operation,  and  engineering \nsolutions that have the least impact on populations in the project area. \nAffected  households  residing,  working,  doing  business,  and/or  cultivating  land \nwithin the project-affected areas during the conduct of the census and inventory \nof  losses  survey  are  entitled  to  be  compensated  for  their  lost  assets,  incomes, \nand businesses at replacement cost, and they will be provided with rehabilitation \nmeasures  to  improve  or  at  least  maintain  their  pre-project  living  standards, \nincome-earning capacities, and production levels.  \nAffected  households  will  be  eligible \nfor  compensation  and  rehabilitation \nassistance,  irrespective  of  tenure  status,  social  or  economic  standing,  and  any \nsuch factors that may discriminate against achieving the resettlement objectives \nexplained above. Lack of legal rights to lost assets or adversely affected tenure \nstatus  and  social  or  economic  status  will  not  bar  the  affected  households  from \nentitlements to such compensation and rehabilitation measures. \nAffected  households  will  be  fully  consulted  and  given  the  opportunity  to \nparticipate  in  matters  that  will  have  adverse  impacts  on  their  lives  during  the \ndesign,  implementation,  and  operation  of  the  Project.  Moreover,  plans  for  the \nacquisition  of  land  and  other  assets  will  be  carried  out  in  consultation  with  the \naffected  households,  which  will  receive  prior  information  concerning  the \ncompensation, relocation, and other assistance available to them. \nAny acquisition of, or restriction on access to, resources owned or managed by \nthe  affected  households  as  a  common  property  (e.g.,  communal  forest, \ncommunal  farm)  will  be  mitigated  by  arrangements  that  will  ensure  access  of \nthose affected households to equivalent resources on a continuing basis.  \nThere  will  be  no  deductions  in  compensation  payments  for  land,  structures,  or \nother affected assets for salvage value, depreciation, taxes, stamp duties, fees, \nor other payments.  \n\n(vii)   Shop  owners  and  operators  will  be  allowed  to  construct  a  replacement  of  their \nstalls before demolishing the existing ones to minimize, if not avoid, income loss \narising from the disruption of business operations.  \n\n(viii)   Affected  households  that  lose  only  part  of  their  physical  assets  will  not  be  left \nwith a portion that will be inadequate to sustain their current standards of living. \nThe  minimum  size  of  remaining  land  and  structures  will  be  agreed  between \nproject  authorities  and  the  affected  households  during  the  detailed  resettlement \nplanning process.  \nTemporarily  affected  land  and  communal  infrastructure  will  be  restored  to \npre-project conditions.  \nThere will be effective mechanisms for hearing and resolving grievances during \nthe planning and implementation of the resettlement plan.  \nExisting  cultural  and  religious  practices  will  be  respected  and,  to  the  maximum \nextent possible, preserved.  \n\n(xi)  \n\n(ix)  \n\n(x)  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\n \n\nAppendix 9     \n\n \n(xii) \n\nSpecial  measures  will  be  incorporated  into  the  resettlement  plans  and  in \ncomplementary  mitigation  and  enhancement  activities  to  protect  socially  and \neconomically  vulnerable  groups  at  high  risk  of  impoverishment,  such  as  ethnic \nlandless \nminorities,  households  headed  by  women  and/or \nhouseholds,  children  and  elderly  people  without  support  structures,  and  people \nliving  in  poverty.  Appropriate  assistance  will  be  provided  to  help  them  improve \ntheir socioeconomic status.  \n\nthe  disabled, \n\n(xiii)   Adequate resources will be identified and committed during the preparation and \nimplementation  of  subproject  resettlement  plans.  This \nincludes  adequate \nbudgetary support fully committed and made available to cover the costs of land \nacquisition,  compensation,  resettlement,  and  rehabilitation  within  the  agreed \nimplementation  period  for  the  Project.  Adequate  human  resources  will  be \nprovided for supervision, liaison, and monitoring of land acquisition, resettlement, \nand rehabilitation activities.  \n\n(xiv)   Appropriate  reporting,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  mechanisms  will  be  identified \n\nand set in place as part of the resettlement management system.  \n\n(xv)   This  resettlement  plan  or  its  summary  and  the  updated  subproject  resettlement \nplans  or  their  summaries  will  be  translated  into  local  languages  and  placed  in \ncommune  offices  for  the  reference  of  affected  households  and  other  interested \ngroups.  \n\n(xvi)   Civil works contracts will not be awarded for a specific subproject or geographic \narea  until  (a)  compensation  payment  and  relocation  to  new  sites  have  been \nsatisfactorily  completed  for  that  subproject  or  geographic  area,  (b)  an  agreed \nrehabilitation program is in place, and (c) the area is free from all encumbrances \nas per an approved resettlement plan.  \n\n(xvii)   Cash  compensation  or  replacement  land  for  affected  households  losing  their \nentire residential lands will be made available well ahead of civil works to allow \nthe affected households sufficient lead time to reconstruct their houses. \n\n(xviii)   No demolition of assets and/or entry to properties will be done until the affected \n\nhousehold is fully compensated and relocated. \n\n \nEntitlement Matrix. The resettlement plan and resettlement framework contain detailed \n5. \nentitlement matrixes summarizing the types of impact, eligibility, and compensation. Standards \ndescribed  may  not  be  lowered  but  might  be  enhanced  in  the  ensuing  resettlement  plans,  as \nrequired, on the basis of detailed social impact analysis. The entitlement matrix is found in the \nfull resettlement plan and resettlement framework (Supplementary Appendix D).  \n \n6. \nConsultation,  Disclosure,  and  Grievance  Redress.  Local  authorities  and  leaders  in \neach of the project towns and districts were informed about the project proposal, its objectives, \nand  proposed  activities  at  the  early  stages  of  project  preparation.  They  were  consulted  on \ndevelopment  needs  and  resettlement  issues,  their  perceptions  toward  project  objectives, \ntechnical  designs,  and  their  tasks  and  roles  in  project  planning  and  implementation.  Affected \npersons  have  been  informed  about  the  proposed  Project  on  an  individual  household  basis. \nThey  have  been  consulted  about  how  the  Project  will  directly  affect  them  and  have  been \ninvolved  in  developing  the  proposed  resettlement  and  compensation  packages.  Disclosure  of \nthe  resettlement  plan  to  the  affected  persons  was  done  prior  to  appraisal,  using  locally \nappropriate  information  booklets.  Further  consultation  will  be  undertaken  prior  to  finalizing \ndetailed  design  to  incorporate  affected  persons\u2019  requests  and  suggestions  to  minimize \nresettlement  impacts.  A  grievance  mechanism  has  been  established  to  ensure  that  affected \npersons\u2019  concerns  and  grievances  are  addressed  and  resolved  in  a  timely  and  satisfactory \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n \n53\n\n \n\nmanner.  Affected  persons  will  be  made  fully  aware  of  their  rights  to  grievance  and  the \nprocedures, verbally and in writing, during consultation, survey, and time of compensation.  \n \n7. \nImplementation  Arrangements.  MOH  is  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project.  The \nPPCs in each of the eight provinces will be the implementing agencies and will be represented \nby  the  provincial  health  bureaus.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  through  a  national  project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  in  the  Department  of  Planning  and  Finance  and  eight  PPMUs  in  the \nprovincial health bureaus. MOH is responsible for approving the resettlement plan and ensuring \nthat  the  resettlement  plan  is  approved  by  each  of  the  PPCs  involved.  The  PPMUs  will  ensure \ncoordination  of  provincial  and/or  district  agencies  involved  in  resettlement  and  review \ncompensation rates and the resettlement budget. Resettlement committees at the provincial and \ndistrict levels have been established to organize, plan, and carry out daily detailed resettlement \nplan activities in the towns together with the PPMUs. A national consultant will support the PMU \nand PPMUs in carrying out resettlement activities.  \n \n8. \nImplementation  Schedule.  The  resettlement  plan  includes  detailed  implementation \nschedules  that  are  coordinated  with  the  civil  works  schedules  for  the  health  facilities.  All \nsubproject resettlement plans will be reviewed by ADB prior to project implementation. Approval \nto  award  any  civil  works  contracts  will  not  be  given  until  the  required  lands  have  been  fully \nacquired and affected households are appropriately compensated and relocated. \n \n9. \nMonitoring  and  Evaluation.  The  PMU  and  PPMUs  are  responsible  for  the  internal \nmonitoring  activities  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  during  updating  and  implementation. \nThe PPMUs will submit quarterly resettlement reports to the PMU. The PMU will include PPMU \nresettlement progress in the Project\u2019s overall quarterly progress reports that will be submitted to \nADB. Monitoring reports will be uploaded to ADB\u2019s website. The PMU will engage for external \nmonitoring and post-evaluation a suitable domestic agency acceptable to ADB, under terms of \nreference  acceptable  to  ADB.  PMU  and  PPMUs  will  provide  the  domestic  agency  all \nresettlement-related documents.  \n \n10.   Cost  and  Budget.  The  current  cost  of  resettlement  for  the  Project  is  estimated  at \n$0.86 million. This amount includes the cash cost of land acquisition; provision or purchase of \nother  land  for  farmers  (if  land-for-land  compensation  is  applied);  compensation  for  loss  of \nhouses,  structures,  crops,  and  business;  relocation;  living  standards  rehabilitation  measures; \nand monitoring. Adequate budgetary support will be fully committed and made available by the \nMOH, as well as by the provincial and district authorities, to cover the costs of land acquisition \nand resettlement within the agreed implementation period.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\n \n\nAppendix 10   \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\nCountry/Project Title: Viet Nam: Health Care in the South Central Coast Region \n\nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\nProject \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\nSoutheast Asia Department \nSocial Sectors Division \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nWith  a  focus  on  health  care  for  the  poor,  the  Project  supports  Viet  Nam\u2019s  5-year  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan \n2006\u20132010 and the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy. The strategies aim for sustained annual \ngrowth  of  7.5%,  eliminating  hunger  by  2010,  and  halving  poverty  from  2002  to  2010.  Special  emphasis  is  placed  on \nreaching  poor  communities  and  ethnic  minorities  in  remote  areas.  In  health  care,  Viet  Nam  has  targeted  further \nreductions in maternal mortality, infant mortality, and malnutrition; reversing the prevalence of malaria and tuberculosis; \nand  halting  the  growth  of  HIV/AIDS.  The  Government  has  identified  several  key  problems  needing  to  be  addressed, \nincluding  deteriorating  and  poorly  equipped  infrastructure,  shortages  of  skilled  health  workers,  limited  access  for  the \npoor, and an increasingly complex health system. Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) country strategy and program for \nVietnam  (2007\u20132010)  is  directly  linked  to  supporting  the  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan\u2019s  targeted  outcomes. \nSupport will be directed to improving environmental management, human resources development, and gender equity \nwhile supporting ethnic minorities development.   \n \nIn line with Viet Nam\u2019s and ADB\u2019s strategies, the Project will strengthen provincial health systems and help improve the \nhealth  status  of  the  poor,  women,  and  children  in  the  south  central  coast  region  (SCCR).  The  Project  will  contribute \ntoward achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and Viet Nam Development Goals.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: GI \n \n1.  Key Issues \nViet Nam\u2019s recent socioeconomic development progress has been remarkable. Poverty was cut from 58.1% in 1993 to \nan  estimated  19.5%  in  2005.  During  this  period,  income  per  capita  grew  from  $288  to  $622.  Broad-based  economic \ngrowth,  greater  macroeconomic  and  political  stability,  and  targeted  programs  to  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  have  all \nhelped to reduce poverty.  The country has achieved a high level of human development, and health outcomes have \nimproved significantly. Life expectancy has increased by more than 6 years for both men and women since 1990, and \nmaternal  mortality  rates  have  declined  to  130  per  100,000  live  births.  Immunization  rates  have  risen,  and  infant  and \nchild mortalities have fallen. Health services coverage also improved\u2014in 2005, 97.8% of children under 1 year of age \nhad been fully immunized and 96.1% of deliveries were attended by a trained health worker.  \n \nViet Nam has made good progress in achieving MDGs and Viet Nam Development Goals and has already achieved its \npoverty targets. Good progress has been made toward universal primary education, gender equality, maternal health, \nand  access  to  safe  drinking  water.  Despite  these  achievements,  increased  efforts  are  required  to  ensure  key  MDGs \nrelated  to  child  mortality,  drinking  water,  and  HIV/AIDS  are  met.  This  means  improving  the  quality  of  key  services, \ntargeting  pockets  of  poverty,  and  ensuring  sound  and  environmentally  sustainable  practices.  Significant  pockets  of \npoverty  remain.  In  2004,  the  incidence  of  poverty  was  26.4%  in  rural  areas  but  13.7%  in  urban  areas.  While  food \npoverty (at 3.3%) has been largely eliminated in urban households, 8.1% of rural households remain food-poor. Ethnic \nminorities,  in  particular,  have  not  kept  apace  of  the  economic  progress  experienced  by  others.  Similarly,  the  health \nstatus of those who live in rural areas, especially ethnic minorities, has not progressed as rapidly as for urban dwellers. \n \nThe  remoteness  of  many  rural  communities  and  the  unavailability  of  skilled  health  workers  contribute  significantly  to \ntheir poverty and poor health status. The cost of health care is the most significant constraining factor, and user fees, \ncoupled with the cost of drugs and expenses for travel, can be a devastating financial burden for those surviving at a \nsubsistence  level.  While  the  introduction  of  health  insurance  is  beginning  to  mitigate  these  financial  burdens,  the \naccess to quality care remains limited for these groups. Viet Nam\u2019s health system is burdened by an infrastructure that \nis  old,  deteriorated,  and  poorly  equipped,  with  inadequate  systems  for  water  and  waste  management  and  infection \ncontrol.  The  facilities  and  equipment  at  most  district  hospitals  are  old  and  degraded.  Provincial  hospitals  are \noverwhelmed,  with  overcrowded  wards  and  large  volumes  of  outpatients.  Many  commune  health  stations  in  the \nmountainous areas cannot provide basic health care services and lack essential equipment and drugs. \n2.  Design Features \nWhile the health care funds for the poor have reduced some of the financial barriers to health care and led to increases \nin poor people\u2019s utilization of health services, these have not helped to improve the quality of health facilities and health \nstaff or the supply of equipment and drugs.  The Project will address these gaps and improve access to quality health \nservices  for  about  9  million  people  (4.6  million  women,  4.4  million  men,  and  nearly  500,000  ethnic  minority  people) \nliving  in  the  eight  target  provinces,  thereby  directly  or  indirectly  improving  their  health  status.  Key  project  outputs \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n \n55\n\n \n\ninclude (i) improved health facilities, providing improved quantity and quality of health care; (ii) strengthened provincial \nhuman  resources,  increasing  the  number  of  skilled  health  staff  providing  quality  health  care  services;  (iii)  improved \naccess to health care for the poor; and (iv) strengthened provincial health systems in terms of equity, efficiency, and \neffectiveness.  \n \nImproved health reduces income losses and expenditures due to illness or disease, and it indirectly protects the labor \nforce and production of food and cash crops. Four of the eight project provinces have poverty levels significantly above \nthe national average of 19.5%, including Ninh Thuan at 45.0%, Quang Nam at 36.3%, Quang Ngai at 36.1%, Binh Dinh \nat  28.3%,  and  Phu  Yen  at  21%.  The  Project  will  also  be  targeting  such  vulnerable  and  poor  groups  as  women  and \nethnic minorities for specific interventions and training programs.    \n                                                     \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\n \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nAlthough  economic  growth  has  benefited  most  of  society,  the  level  of  inequality,  including  for  health  status,  has \nincreased.  The  poverty  incidence  in  rural  areas  remains  significantly  higher  than  in  urban  areas,  and  61%  of  ethnic \nminority  households  lived  below  the  poverty  line  in  2002  compared  with  14%  of  Kinh  and  Chinese  households. \nSimilarly, the health status of the rural population and ethnic minorities is significantly worse than in urban areas. Based \non a 1999 study, the infant mortality rate was 69 per 1,000 live births for ethnic Gia Rai, 56 for ethnic H\u2019mong, and 21 \nfor  the  majority  Kinh  population.  In  2004,  4%  of  Kinh  and  Chinese  children  under  5  were  severely  malnourished \ncompared  to  33%  of  ethnic  minority  children.  A  Ministry  of  Health  study  conducted  in  2000\u20132001  found  maternal \nmortality  ratios  of  79  per  100,000  live  births  in  urban  areas,  145  in  rural  areas,  269  in  the  mountainous  and  midland \nareas, and 81 for Kinh compared to 316 among ethnic minorities. The proportion of ethnic minority people belonging to \ncommune  health  centers  with  a  medical  doctor  is  only  30%,  compared  to  63%  for  Kinh  or  Chinese  people.  There  is \nalso a shortage of qualified health care professionals from ethnic minorities who can bridge the language and culture \ngap  in  providing  health  services  in  certain  areas.  The  public  health  system  thus  faces  considerable  challenges  in \nprotecting the health of poor and vulnerable groups and in responding to the changing patterns of disease associated \nwith ongoing social, demographic, and epidemiological transitions.  \n \nThere is significant potential for improving health outcomes among the poor and ethnic groups in the project area. The \nProject will upgrade health facilities and equipment and increase the capacity of health workers to provide quality care. \nTo  help  increase  the  number  of  women  and  ethnic  minority  health  workers,  the  Project  will  assist  each  province  to \ndevelop gender and ethnic minority action plans with focused interventions to ensure they reach targets for women and \nethnic  minorities  in  training  courses.  Health  workers  serving  ethnic  minority  communities  will  be  given  priority  for \ntraining,  and  programs  will  include  topics  that  disproportionately  affect  ethnic  minorities.  The  Project  will  also \nspecifically  address  quality  of  care  issues  in  remote  and  poor  commune  health  stations,  where  lack  of  staff  is  a \nproblem, and will provide scholarships for local school leavers to attend health worker training at provincial secondary \nmedical  schools  or  colleges  in  the  SCCR.  The  poorest  communes,  many  of  them  with  significant  ethnic  minority \npopulations having limited access to services and poor health indicators, will be targeted to receive training for village \nhealth workers, health and nutrition promotion, and assistance to reduce financial barriers to health care. \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Consultation and Participation Process during the Project Preparation \nThe  Project  was  designed  following  a  highly  participatory  approach,  including  planning  workshops  with  the  eight \nprovincial health teams and three regional workshops. Stakeholder consultations were carried out with national agencies, \ndevelopment partners,  provincial  and  district  health officials, managers and staff  of  hospitals and  health  centers,  village \nhealth  workers,  and  potential  beneficiaries  that  include  poor  people,  women,  and  ethnic  minorities.  The  active \ninvolvement of all stakeholders will continue during project implementation. \n \n2.  What  level  of  consultation  and  participation  (C&P)  is  envisaged  during  the  project  implementation  and \nmonitoring?  \n \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation     \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n  Empowerment  \n\n Yes     \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?  \n \nA participation strategy is incorporated into the overall project design and detailed in the ethnic minority strategy and \ngender  action  plan.  The  Project  will  place  strong  emphasis  on  gender-inclusive  community  participation  and \nconsultation. Active participation of key stakeholders\u2014especially among the poor and ethnic minority groups\u2014will be \ncrucial  to  help  identify  special  needs  and  ensure  accessibility  to  health  care  services.  Women\u2019s  participation  will  be \ncentral to the development, implementation, and monitoring of project activities. Special provisions and budgets have \n\n No  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\n \n\nAppendix 10   \n\nbeen included to ensure active participation of women, ethnic minorities, and other vulnerable groups. This process will \nbe  regularly  monitored  and  evaluated  by  consultants  and  project  staff,  with  the  results  fed  back  into  ongoing  project \nimplementation.   \n\nC.  Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues \nThere are significant regional disparities in key health indicators, and women are particularly vulnerable in mountainous \nand  remote  communities.  Gender  development  is  intricately  linked  to  issues  of  ethnicity  and  poverty,  and  ethnic \nminorities  throughout  Viet  Nam,  especially  women  and  children,  are  particularly  lagging  behind.  In  ethnic  minority \ncommunities  in  the  central  highlands,  for  instance,  the  burden  of  disease  for  females  of  reproductive  age  (15\u201344)  is \nmore than 25% higher than the national average. The 2001\u20132002 Viet Nam National Health Survey found that, among \nwomen of reproductive age (18\u201334 years), prenatal care and immunization in ethnic minority groups was just two-thirds \nthat  for  the  Kinh  population.  The  maternal  mortality  ratio  is  269  per  100,000  live  births  in  mountainous  and  midland \nregions compared to 81 in the deltas, 81 in the Kinh ethnic majority compared to 316 among ethnic minorities, and 145 \nin rural areas compared to 79 in urban areas. \n2.  Key Actions \n \n\n  Gender plan       \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\nThe Project is designed to particularly benefit women of reproductive age and children under 5 years of age. A project-\nspecific gender action plan (GAP) has been formulated to promote the equal participation of all stakeholders as project \nbeneficiaries. The GAP is in Appendix 11. \n\nIII.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION \n\n \nAre  social  indicators  included  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  to  facilitate  monitoring  of  social  development \nactivities and/or social impacts during project implementation?  \n \n\n   No      \n\n Yes     \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n \n57\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nGENDER ANALYSIS AND ACTION PLAN \n \n\nInstitutional and Legal Framework  \n\nRepresentation in Public Institutions \n\n1.   \nA  project-specific  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  has  been  formulated  to  promote  the  equal \nparticipation of all stakeholders as project beneficiaries and to highlight the special health needs \nof women in the south central coast region. The GAP is based on a gender analysis that was \nprepared  for  the  Project  and  is  designed  according  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s) \nPolicy on Gender and Development (1998). \n \nA.  \n \n2. \nA  strong  policy  and  institutional  environment  supporting  gender  equality  has  been \ninstrumental  in  empowering  Vietnamese  women  and  reducing  gender  gaps.  The  National \nCommittee  for  the  Advancement  of  Women,  a  high-level  multisectoral  committee  that  reports \ndirectly to the President, is the formal state body responsible for promoting gender equality. The \nViet Nam Women\u2019s Union is a mass-based organization for women, facilitating implementation \nof  projects  and  programs  at  the  local  level  and  representing  their  members  in  national  policy \ndialogue. The newly issued Gender Equality Law, 2007, redresses gender disparities in existing \nlaws,  calls  for  gender  mainstreaming  in  public  administration,  and  provides  for  targets  and \nquotas  for  women\u2019s  participation  in  decision  making.  Gender  equality  and  improved  health \nservices for ethnic minorities are key priorities in the National Strategy on Reproductive Health \nCare for 2001\u20132010. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nWhile significant improvements have been achieved, gender disparities in leadership still \nexist  at  all  levels  of  government  and  women  tend  to  be  excluded  from  the  decision-making \nprocess. Viet Nam has a high level of female representation in Parliament, but within the public \nadministration\u2019s central executive level very few women are represented in leadership positions. \nAt the central level in 2005, only 6% of department directors and 14% of deputies were women. \nAt  local  levels,  women  are  almost  invisible  in  leadership  positions  across  departments  and \nsectors.  Slowly  changing  cultural  norms  and  a  lack  of  open  and  transparent  recruitment  and \npromotion practices are key causes for the low representation of women in leadership positions. \nAt  the  provincial,  district,  and  commune  levels,  these  factors  combine  with  lower  educational \nqualifications and skills to prevent women from participating in leadership roles.  \n \nC. \n \nThe  patterns  of  disease  in  Viet  Nam  differ  substantially  between  men  and  women. \n4.  \nWomen  are  vulnerable  to  diseases  associated  with  childbearing,  while  men  have  a  greater \nincidence of accidents and injuries. There are also significant regional disparities in key health \nindicators,  and  women  are  particularly  vulnerable  in  mountainous  and  remote  communities. \nGender development is intricately linked to issues of ethnicity and poverty, and ethnic minorities \nthroughout  Viet  Nam,  especially  women  and  children,  particularly  lag  behind.  For  instance,  in \nethnic  minority  communities  in  the  central  highlands,  the  burden  of  disease  for  females  of \nreproductive age (15\u201344) is more than 25% higher than the national average.1 The 2001\u20132002 \nViet Nam national health survey found that among women of reproductive age (18\u201334 years), \nprenatal  care  and  immunization  in  ethnic  minority  groups  was  just  two  thirds  that  for  the  Kinh \npopulation.  The  maternal  mortality  ratio  is  269  per  100,000  live  births  in  mountainous  and \nmidland regions compared to 81 in the deltas, 81 among the Kinh ethnic majority compared to \n316 among ethnic minorities, and 145 in rural areas compared to 79 in urban areas.   \n\nKey Gender Issues in the Health Sector \n\n                                                 \n1 Ministry of Health. Viet Nam Health Report, 2006. Ha Noi (p. 14). \n\n\f58 \n\n \n\nAppendix 11   \n\n \n5. \nFactors  identified  as  contributing  to  maternal  mortality  are  (i)  delay  in  the  decision  to \nseek health care, (ii) delay in transferring women with obstetric complications to the appropriate \nfacilities, (iii) delay in providing essential treatment, (iv) lack of well-trained health workers, and \n(v)  lack  of  drugs  and  necessary  equipment  (footnote  1).  The  United  Nations  Population  Fund \nassessment  of  three  district  hospitals  in  Ninh  Thuan  province  found  that  (i)  all  hospitals  were \nmissing  equipment  and  drugs  to  meet  maternal  and  neonatal  health  care  needs;  (ii)  two \nhospitals lacked resources to manage postpartum hemorrhage and could not transfuse blood or \nperform life-saving surgery; (iii) all hospitals lacked staff to cover emergencies at the commune \nhealth  stations;  (iv)  ambulances  were  used  to  transport  senior  health  officials  and  lacked \nemergency  equipment;  and  (v)  health  providers  lacked  critical  skills  and  knowledge  to \nadequately manage obstetrics complications, resuscitate a newborn, or provide postnatal care. \nWomen\u2019s  and  children\u2019s  health  is  further  compromised  by  limited  access  to  preventive  and \ncurative services, misuse of self-medication, and lack of trust in modern medicine. The lack of \nknowledge about women\u2019s rights and prevalence of traditional customs, laws, and practices also \nnegatively affect women\u2019s health and development (e.g., relating to early marriage and limited \ndecision-making). \n \n \n6. \nThe proportion of female staff in the health sector is relatively high. In Quang Ngai, for \ninstance, the staff is nearly 62% female in the provincial health service. Women tend, however, \nto  be  predominantly  concentrated  in  the  more  poorly  paid,  lower  levels  of  the  system\u2014as \nmidwives,  nurses,  cleaners,  clerical  staff,  and  laboratory  technicians.  The  directors  of  the \nprovincial health services in Da Nang, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh, Phu Yen, and Khan \nHoa are all males. Increasing the number of female hires and promotions to higher levels may \nbe a significant contributor to increasing the focus and resources for women and ethnic minority \nhealth needs. \n \nD. \n \n\nGender Action Plan and Implementation Arrangements \n\nProject Outputs \n\nActions Proposed \n\nTable A11:  Summary Gender Action Plan \n \n\nOutput 1: Improved Health Facilities  \nNew and Upgraded Health \nFacilities and Equipment \n \nImproved Water, Sanitation, and \nWaste Management \n \n\nNational and provincial project management units (PPMUs) introduce the \nProject to province, district, and village representatives, both male and \nfemale. \nIdentify vulnerable groups and households headed by women.  \nEnsure that households headed by women, irrespective of ethnicity or \nincome levels, will have equal access to participate in the Project. \nEnsure gender impacts on land acquisition and environmental concerns are \nconsidered, as described in resettlement plans and environmental \nexaminations. \nCollect monitoring data disaggregated by gender, ethnicity, and income. \nEnsure that equal wages are paid to men and women laborers. \nGive priority to hospital civil works and equipment for improving quality \nreproductive health care to meet national standards and guidelines.  \nEnsure that health facilities have adequate waiting areas and separate toilet \nfacilities for men and women. \nBudget made available for screening of potential gender impacts and \ndevelopment of enhancement measures, as well as monitoring and \nevaluation activities disaggregated by gender, ethnicity, and income. \n\n \n\n\fProject Outputs \n\nActions Proposed \n\nOutput 2: Strengthened Provincial Human Resources  \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n59\n\n \n\nImproved Provincial Human \nResource Planning and \nManagement \n \nImproved Provincial Training \nCapacity \n \nImproved Quality and Availability \nof Staff \n \nHRD Policy Studies Conducted \n \n\nHRD plans to include: strategies to increase representation of women staff \nin managerial positions, budgetary allocations, implementation of national \nregulations regarding female employees, and the actions of managers to \npromote gender equality initiatives. \nEnsure gender analysis of baseline data disaggregated by gender and \nethnicity is used for HRD planning and to identify any gender gaps in wages \nand promotions. \nEstablish mechanisms to promote women\u2019s representation in decision-\nmaking processes. \nEnsure that provincial training capacity development includes a focus on \ngender needs and strategies. \nOrganize separate meetings with women\u2019s groups to identify specific needs \nfor programs for women within the health sector. \nEnsure each province establishes and reaches targets for women and \nethnic minorities in training courses at all levels. \nTraining programs will include gender sessions and topics that \ndisproportionately affect women. \nTeaching materials will be gender and ethnically sensitive and inclusive.  \nEnsure that all training activities are gender balanced and that women\u2019s \nrepresentation is at least proportionate to their representation in the overall \ntrainee pool.

The  purposes  of  the \nstrategy are to (i) guide the assessment of potential impacts on ethnic minorities to be done for \neach  of  the  provinces  during  implementation;  (ii)  assist  the  preparation  of  specific  actions  to \naddress  the  impacts;  (iii)  present  interventions  to  improve  the  quality  of  services  in  the  basic \nhealth care system for ethnic minorities, including at the village level; (iv) present interventions \nwith  a  gender  focus  to  address  the  needs  of  ethnic  minority  women  and  children;  (v)  help \nensure that ethnic minorities have increased opportunities to participate in training at all levels; \nand  (vi)  guide  the  development  of  information,  education,  and  participation  methodologies  so \nthat they are targeted to ethnic minority needs, culturally appropriate, and sustained. The ethnic \nminority strategy is based on (i) consultations with ethnic minorities, government officials, local \norganizations,  and  other  key  stakeholders;  and  (ii)  secondary  sources  and  past  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  projects.  The  strategy  is  in  accordance  with  current  Viet  Nam \nregulations and complies with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998).  \n\nA. \n\nEthnic Minorities and Health in Viet Nam and the Project Area \n\n2. \nViet Nam had a total population of about 85.3 million people in 2007, of which about 14% \nwere ethnic minorities. There are 53 ethnic minority groups and close to 100 subgroups, most of \nwhich live in the northern and central mountainous regions and in lowland river deltas. Based on \nthe  socioeconomic  indicators  from  the  2004  Viet  Nam  Household  Living  Standard  Survey  and \nother  studies,  ethnic  minorities  are  generally  poorer  than  the  Kinh  and  have  limited  access  to \neducation and health care services. About 39% of those recorded as living in poverty were from \nethnic minorities, and 61% of all ethnic minority people are poor compared with only 14% of the \nmajority  Kinh  and  Chinese.  Only  4%  of  ethnic  minorities  have  access  to  sanitation  and  19%  to \nclean water, compared with the Kinh majority group at 36% and 63%, respectively. A recent ADB \nproject  in  Viet  Nam1 reported  that,  given  the  poverty  gap  for  minorities,  if  current  trends  persist, \npoverty will predominantly be related to ethnicity by 2010. \n\n3.  \nEthnic  minorities  tend to be poorer than  the Kinh or the Chinese  due to (i) geographical \nremoteness,  (ii)  lack  of  farming  knowledge  and  skills,  (iii)  traditional  cultivation  practices  (i.e., \nshifting  cultivation),  (iv)  limited  access  to  cash  and  credit,  (v)  environmental  problems,  and \n(vi) poor physical and social infrastructure. These conditions also limit the development of ethnic \nwomen, who have higher levels of illiteracy, have less access to training for improved agricultural \ntechniques,  participate  less  in  nonagricultural  work,  and  have  less  mobility  and  interaction  with \nothers.  Based  on  the  2004  survey  data,  the  smallest  ethnic  minority  groups  (e.g.,  less  than \n15,000 people) are also the poorest.  \n \n4. \nThe health status of the rural population and ethnic minorities is significantly worse than \nin urban areas. Based on a 1999 study, the infant mortality rate was 69 per 1,000 live births for \nethnic  Gia  Rai,  56  for  ethnic  H\u2019mong,  and  21  for  the  majority  Kinh  population.  In  2004,  4%  of \nKinh  and  Chinese  children  under  5  were  severely  malnourished  compared  to  33%  of  ethnic \nminority children. A Ministry of Health study conducted in 2000\u20132001 found maternal mortality \nratios of 79 per 100,000 live births in urban areas, 145 in rural areas, 269 in the mountainous \nand  midland  areas,  and  81  for  Kinh  compared  to  316  among  ethnic  minorities.  While  98%  of \npeople  live  in  communes  that  have  access  to  a  health  center,  only  59%  of  people  live  in \ncommunes  where  the  health  center  has  a  medical  doctor.  The  proportion  of  ethnic  minority \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2007.

Manila. \n\n\f62 \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\npeople living in communes where the commune health center has a medical doctor is only 30%, \ncompared to 63% for Kinh or Chinese people. There is also a shortage of qualified ethnic health \ncare professionals who can bridge the language and culture gap in providing health services in \ncertain  geographic  areas.  The  public  health  system  thus  faces  considerable  challenges  in \nprotecting the health of poor and vulnerable groups and in responding to the changing patterns \nof disease associated with ongoing social, demographic, and epidemiological transitions. \n \n5. \nThere  are  several  ethnic  minority  groups  in  the  south  central  coast  region  (SCCR), \nmainly the Cham population of the lowlands and a number of other minority populations living in \nthe  upland  fringes  bordering  the  central  highlands.  These  groups  are  significantly  worse  off  in \nterms of poverty and health status than the majority Kinh population. More than 90.0% of ethnic \nminorities in the SCCR lived in poverty in 2004, compared to only 15.0% of Kinh and Chinese. \nIn 2004, 72% of minorities in the SCCR were considered to be \u201cfood-poor,\u201d compared to a few \npercent  among  Kinh. 2  The  so-called  \u201cpoverty  gap\u201d 3  is  also  much  higher  among  minorities \n(19.2%)  than  among  the  poor  Kinh  (2.6%),  with  the  number  for  ethnic  minorities  in  SCCR \nreaching as high as 39.5%.4  \n\n \nTable A12.1: Project Provinces and Ethnic Minorities \n\nProject \nArea \nViet Nam \n(Total) \nDa Nang \n\nRate of \nPovertya \n6.9% \n\nTotal \nPopulation \n84,155,800 \n\n \n\nIMRb \n17.8 \n\n \n\nRural \nPop\u2019n.c \n51 \n\nEthnic Minoritiesd \n \n\n \n\n4.3% \n\n777,100 \n\n9.0 \n\n13.8 \n\n \n\nQuang \nNam \n\n  \n36.3% \n\n1,463,300 \n\n22.0 \n\n82.9 \n\nQuang \nNgai \n\n36.1% \n \n\n1,269,100 \n \n\n20.8 \n\n85.6 \n \n\nBinh Dinh \n\n28.3% \n\n1,556,700 \n\n20.3 \n\n74.8 \n\nPhu Yen \n\n21.0% \n\n861,100 \n\n30.8 \n\n79.1 \n\n99.87% Kinh, \n0.13% Ka Tu \n93.13% Kinh, \n2.83% Co Tu, \n1.73% Ca \nDong, 1.01% \nBhnoong, \n0.5% Xo dang \n\n88.21% Kinh, \n1.15% Xo \nDang, 8.7% \nHre, 1.87% \nCor \n97.98% Kinh, \n1.04% Ba Na, \n0.52% Hre, \n0.3% Cham, \n0.06% Hoa. \n94.48% Kinh, \n2.08% E De, \n0.43% Ban A, \n2.06% Cham \nHo Roi, 0.18% \nTay \n\nMuch of the west of the province \ndominated by the Co-tu population, \nsignificant Gie-trieng and Xo-dang \npopulations in south west bordering Kon \nTum, and a narrow strip of Co population \nalong the southern border with Quang \nNgai. \nMuch of the west of the province \ndominated by large Co and Hre \npopulations, along with small numbers of \nXo-Dang near the border of Kon Tum \n(where most Xo-Dang live). \nLarge Ba Na population throughout west of \nprovince bordering Gia Lai (where most Ba \nNa live).

ADB\u2019s  policy  aims  to  protect  ethnic  minorities  from  the  adverse \nimpacts  of  development  and  to  ensure  that  they  benefit  from  development  projects  and \nprograms.  ADB\u2019s  Operations  Manual  section  on  indigenous  peoples  outlines  ADB  procedures \nand operational guidelines.5  \n\n7. \nViet Nam has a comprehensive legal framework for social equality. The Comprehensive \nPoverty Reduction and Growth Strategy for 2001\u20132010 sets 11 goals, of which 7 deal directly \nwith  issues  of  gender  and  ethnic  minorities  and  2  with  issues  of  vulnerability,  poverty \neradication, and ethnic culture preservation: (i) achieve better education for all; (ii) reach gender \nequality  and  empower  women;  (iii)  reduce  infant  and  child  mortality;  (iv)  improve  maternal \nhealth;  (v)  combat  HIV/AIDS,  malaria,  and  other  communicable  diseases;  (vi)  reduce \nvulnerability; and (vii) eradicate poverty and preserve ethnic minority culture. Key stakeholders \nfor the development of ethnic minorities include the Ministry of Health; Ministry of Labor, Invalids \nand Social Affairs; and the National Institute of Linguistics. The Committee for Ethnic Minority is \nresponsible for coordinating ethnic issues and developing and implementing policies for ethnic \nminority groups in mountainous regions.  \n \n8. \nThe  Government  has  a  stated  commitment  to  improving  health  care  for  the  ethnic \nminority  population.  Directive  No.  6  of  22  January  2002  of  the  Central  Executive  Committee \nemphasizes  the  priority  of  health  care  in  mountainous  and  remote  areas,  and  particularly  for \nethnic minorities. The Ministry of Health has issued Decision 370/2002 promoting health care at \nthe commune level for 2001\u20132010, and its Decision 139 entitles ethnic minorities to free health \ncare that is financed through the national budget. \n \n\n                                                 \n5   ADB. 2006.

During project \nimplementation,  the  provinces  will  review  the  socioeconomic  and  demographic  profiles  of  the \ntarget communities with respect to ethnicity. Using ADB\u2019s checklist on indigenous peoples, the \npotential effects of the Project will be assessed for all ethnic minorities, potential impacts will be \nidentified, and measures to mitigate these impacts will be incorporated into the detailed design \nof  each  subproject.  Budget  will  be  made  available  to  support  the  implementation  of  specific \nactions. Ethnic minorities that are affected by land acquisition and resettlement are eligible for \nthe same entitlements and levels of compensation, regardless of ethnicity or gender.  \n \nD. \n \n10. \nImplementation  arrangements  and  estimated  costs  of  the  ethnic  minority  strategy  are \nintegrated  into  the  Project\u2019s  overall  arrangements  and  total  budget.  Representatives  from  the \nCommittee  of  Ethnic  Minority  and  the  Viet  Nam  Women\u2019s  Union  will  play  a  critical  role  in \nfacilitating  participation  by  all  ethnic  minority  groups  in  project  activities  and  will  be  invited  to \nparticipate  in  steering  committee  meetings.  An  international  social  and  gender  development \nspecialist  (4  person-months)  and  a  national  social  development  specialist  (12  person-months) \nwill support the Executing Agency. The ethnic minority strategy will be monitored as part of the \noverall  system  for  the  Project,  and  socioeconomic  data  will  be  disaggregated  by  gender  and \nethnicity.  Progress  reports  will  provide  periodic  updates  on  the  effects  of  project  outputs  on \nethnic  minorities.  The  midterm  review  mission  will  consider  past  updates  and  make \nadjustments, as required. \n \n \n\nTable A12.2: Anticipated Impacts and Proposed Actions on Ethnic Groups  \n \n \n\nProject Output \n\nAnticipated \nImpacts \n\nAnticipated \nRisks \n\nOutput 1: Improved Health Facilities  \n\nProposed Actions to Enhance Impacts and Mitigate Risks \n\nNew and \nUpgraded \nHealth \nFacilities and \nEquipment \n \nImproved \nWater, \nSanitation, and \nWaste \nManagement \n\n\u25cf Improved \nfacilities and \nequipment for \nhospital services \nin ethnic \nminorities areas \n\u2022 Improved \naccess to health \nfacilities for \nethnic minorities \n\n\u25cf Minor: Ethnic \nminorities are \nnot accessing \nthe upgraded \nfacilities. \n\n\u25cf Budget made available for (i) screening of the potential \nimpacts on ethnic groups, mitigating impacts, managing risks, \nand developing enhancement measures; and (ii) monitoring \nand evaluation activities disaggregated by gender, ethnicity, \nand income. \n\u2022 Incorporate ADB\u2019s indigenous people checklist as part of the \noverall subproject preparation procedures. \n\u25cf Consult with ethnic minority communities during subproject \npreparation and before the start of subproject construction. \n\u25cf After upgrading, ensure ethnic minorities are informed of the \nnew facilities and their right to free health care in the facility.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n        Appendix 12 \n\n65\n\nProject Output \n\nAnticipated \nImpacts \n\nAnticipated \nRisks \n\nOutput 2: Strengthened Provincial Human Resources  \n\n\u25cf Increased \nnumber of \nwomen and \nethnic minority \nhealth workers in \ntargeted \ncommunities \n\u2022  Improved \nquality of health \nworkers serving \nethnic minorities \n\n\u2022 Minor: \nIndividuals \nfrom the \nsmaller ethnic \ngroups do not \nmeet the \nrequirements \nto participate \nin training. \n\nOutput 3: Improved Access to Health Care for the Poor \n\n \n\nImproved \nProvincial \nHuman \nResource \nPlanning and \nManagement \n \nImproved \nProvincial \nTraining \nCapacity \n \nImproved \nQuality and \nAvailability of \nStaff \n \nHRD Policy \nStudies \nConducted  \n\nBetter Skilled \nVHWs in \nRemote \nCommunes \n \nHealth and \nNutrition \nPromoted in \nEthnic Minority \nCommunes \n \nReduced \nBarriers to the \nHealth Care \nFunds for the \nPoor \n\n \n\n\u25cf Improved basic \nhealth care for \nremote \ncommunes and \nethnic minorities \n\u2022  Expanded and \nstrengthened \nnetwork of CHS \nstaff, VHWs, and \nother volunteers \nin remote areas \n\u2022 Improved \ncapacity of CHS \nstaff, VHWs, \nmembers of \nmass \norganizations, \nand others to \npromote the \nhealth and \nnutrition of \nwomen and \nchildren  \n\u2022 Reduced \nfinancial barriers \nand increased \nenrollment in \nhealth care \nservices for poor \nand ethnic \nminority \nhouseholds \n\nProposed Actions to Enhance Impacts and Mitigate Risks \n\n\u25cf HRD plans include strategies to increase the recruitment and \npromotion of ethnic minority staff. \n\u2022 Ensure provinces establish and reach targets for women and \nethnic minorities in training courses at all levels.  \n\u2022 Health workers trained to recognize and understand health-\nseeking behaviors of the relevant ethnic minorities.  \n\u2022 Teaching materials will be gender and ethnically sensitive. \n\u2022 Use of interpreters with multilingual skills as necessary and \nfeasible. \n\u2022 Health workers from and serving ethnic minority communities \ngiven priority for training.
