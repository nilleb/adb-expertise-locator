To  achieve  this,  in  addition  to  the  development  of \nhydropower  and  cross-border  transmission  facilities,  investments  are  required  to  upgrade \nsystem operation reliability and efficiency, and enhance transmission capacity. The project will \ninclude  three  main  components:  (i)  substation  rehabilitation  and  improvement,  (ii)  construction \nof a new Khorga 220/110-kilovolt (kV) substation, and (iii) consulting services.2 \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n1. \n\nSector Overview \n\n3. \nGeorgia has made significant progress in energy sector reforms over the past  10 years \nto  address  chronic  power  shortages  and  the  poor  financial  condition  of  electricity  companies. \nDuring the 1990s, the sector experienced major technical and commercial challenges following \nthe breakup of the former Soviet Union and a general collapse in payments within the sector. In \n1996,  the  existing  utility  was  unbundled  into  separate  generation,  transmission,  and  dispatch \ncompanies.  The  distribution  was  split  between  municipal  and  regional  companies.  Further \nreforms followed with the consolidation of regional distribution companies and the introduction of \nmanagement contractors to manage the unified distribution company. The privatization of power \ngeneration  and  distribution  has  improved  management  of  operations.  Most  of  the  generation \nassets  have  been  privatized  with  the  exception  of  the  Enguri  hydropower  plant  (HPP),  the \nlargest  HPP  with  an  installed  capacity  of  1,300  megawatts  (MW).  It  supplies  about  half  of  the \ncountry\u2019s electricity needs. Distribution is fully privatized to foreign strategic investors. \n \nGeorgian  State  Electrosystem  (GSE)  is  a  100%  state-owned  joint  stock  company \n4. \nproviding  transmission  and  exclusive  dispatch  services  to  about  50  eligible  companies  in \nGeorgia.  GSE  owns  most  of  the  transmission  grid  including  the  220  kV  and  110 kV  lines  and \npart of the 35 kV networks used for transmission services. GSE is also responsible for operation \nof the transmission system and owns the national dispatch center.  \n \n5. \nThe  reliability  of  electricity  services  has  improved  significantly  due  to  investments  in \nenergy  infrastructure  and  maintenance.  Financial  viability  has  strengthened  with  tariff  reforms, \nimproved  revenue  collection,  and  reduced  quasi-fiscal  deficits  in  the  sector.  Retail  tariffs  for \nresidential  customers  are  set  close  to  full  cost  recovery  but  cross-subsidization  persists. 3 \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2010.  Technical  Assistance  to  Georgia  for  Preparing  the  Regional  Power \n\nTransmission Enhancement Project. Manila. \n\n3  The Georgian National Energy and Water Regulatory Commission, the independent regulator, sets tariffs following \nmethodology  and  procedures  set  out  in  its  Resolution  No.  3,  issued  on  1  July  1998.  The  current  tariffs  for \nresidential  customers  are  GEL0.135\u2013GEL0.177  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh),  equivalent  to  $0.075\u2013$0.099  per  kWh; \nthese are reasonable by international and regional standards. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nThe  country  possesses \n\nCollection  rates  increased  to  95%  in  2011.  Since  2006,  network  losses  have  been  reduced \nsubstantially, but remain high by international standards.4 \n \n6. \ntremendous  untapped  hydropower  resources.  Currently, \nhydropower generation accounts for over 85% of annual energy output. Its hydropower potential \nis estimated at up to 80 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year, of which up to 60 TWh are economically \nfeasible. The current system comprises about 60 HPPs with maximum output capability of 8.0\u2013\n9.5 TWh per year, i.e. 15% of the economically feasible potential. \n \n7. \nSince  2007,  generation  production  has  surpassed  the  annual  demand,  due  to  the \nrehabilitation  of  existing  HPPs,  improvement  in  the  efficiency  of  energy  use,  and  reduction  of \nlosses.  Currently, Georgia has power trade with Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and the Russian \nFederation.  In  2011,  Georgia  exported  0.93  TWh  of  electricity,  accounting  for  10%  of  the \ncountry\u2019s total electricity generation.5 \n \n8. \nIn 2008, the Government of Georgia launched a large hydropower investment promotion \ncampaign and has since awarded a number of concession agreements for HPP construction. By \n2016\u20132017,  1,400  MW  of  new  HPPs  are  estimated  to  be  added  to  the  existing  2,510  MW  of \nHPPs, providing an additional 3.8 TWh of capacity available for export at an economic value to \nGeorgia  of  $300  million  per  year.6 Of  Georgia\u2019s  potential  export  markets,  Turkey  is  the  most \nattractive  given  its  summer  peak  in  demand,  projected  capacity  shortfalls,  and  high  market \nprices.7 Transit  trade  from  Armenia  and  Azerbaijan  to  Turkey  is  also  possible.  Power  transit \nthrough Turkey would mean that the rich energy resources in the Caucasus could eventually be \nexported  to  the  European  market.  Georgia  could  therefore  act  as  a  regional  hub  for  energy \ndispatch and transit through the Caucasus area. \n \n\n2. \n\nKey Problems and Constraints \n\nTo develop the hydropower potential and expand power export, and especially to attract \n9.  \nprivate  sector  capital  for  these  investments,  two  critical  technical  issues  need  to  be  resolved:  \n(i)  ensure  the  stability,  reliability,  and  efficiency  of  Georgia\u2019s  power  transmission  system;  and  \n(ii) enlarge the transmission capacity and provide market access to the most promising export \nmarkets for surplus power. \n \n10.  \nThe  government  has  entered  into  agreements  with  neighboring  countries  to  enhance \nand  develop  transmission  infrastructure  and  interconnection  facilities  to  expand  power  trade. \nfor \nNew  cross-border \ncommissioning  in  2013\u20132015. 8  At  present,  domestic  transmission  network  capacity  is \ninadequate and the operating system remains unstable and unreliable, increasing the potential \n                                                \n4  The total transmission losses were reduced from 2.7% in  2006 to 1.9% in 2011. The total distribution losses in 2011 of \n\nlines  with  adjacent  countries  are  scheduled \n\ninterconnection \n\nvarious distribution companies were 16.0%\u201327.0%. \n\n5  In 2011, Georgia\u2019s export market shares are the Russian Federation, 63%; Turkey, 23%; Armenia, 13%; and Azerbaijan, \n1%.  Power  exports  were  during  the  summer  when  Georgia  had  excess  hydro  outputs  and  imports  were  during  winter. \nTotal electricity imports in 2011 were 0.47 TWh, with 95% from the Russian Federation and 5% from Azerbaijan. \n\n6  Sector Assessment (Summary): Energy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7  Wholesale  electricity  prices  in  Turkey  have  been  steadily  increasing  and  are  now  among  the  highest  among  energy \ncommunity members. In 2011, the average wholesale electricity price in Turkey was \u20ac0.08 per kWh ($0.0102 per kWh). \n8  The Black Sea Transmission Network Project, a 500/400 kV interconnection line between Georgia and Turkey,  which will \nadd 1,050 MW of additional interconnector capacity with Turkey, is ongoing and scheduled to be completed in 2013\u20132017 \nin three phases. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank, and German \ndevelopment cooperation through KfW are financing the project. The new 500 kV interconnection line between Georgia \nand  Azerbaijan  was  completed  in  2011.  A  new  400  kV  interconnection  line  between  Georgia  and  Armenia  is \nplanned. \n\n \n\n\frisk  of  frequent  system  blackouts.9 This  constrains  existing  and  future  power  swaps  or  export \npotential.  Since  2008,  considerable  investments  were  spent  to  rehabilitate  existing  substation \nfacilities, mainly in primary equipment. However, the protection systems and substation control \nsystems  supported  by  electromagnetic  analogue  technology  are  obsolete;  they  were  installed \n30\u201350  years  ago  and  have  serious  problems  meeting  operating  and  technical  requirements. \nAny fault on the existing transmission lines will result in a large power deficit in populated areas \nand  have  considerable  social  and  economic  impacts. 10  To  reduce  such  impacts,  more \ninvestment  is  urgently  required  for  substation  rehabilitation  and  enhancement  of  transmission \nfacilities. \n \n11. \nThe Georgian power system has a significant generation-load regional imbalance: two-\nthirds of the energy resources are located in the northwest, while two-thirds of domestic demand \nis  located  in the  east.  Additionally,  most  of the  potential  export market  is  located to the  south. \nThe  major  potential  export  market,  i.e.  Turkey,  is  experiencing  rapid  growth  in  electricity \ndemand.  Other  countries,  such  as  Armenia  and  Azerbaijan,  while  experiencing  modest  or  at \ntimes  zero  demand  growth  are  likely  to  avail  of  a  relatively  cheap  supply  of  hydropower  from \nGeorgia to augment and offset thermal and thermal-nuclear power generation. Power delivery to \nthese markets requires a reliable high-voltage transmission network. \n \nThe  new  Khorga  substation, 11  together  with  other  ongoing  transmission  investment \n12. \nprojects,  will  improve  the  reliability  of  the  grid  and  quality  of  the  power  supply.  The  new \nsubstation  will  increase  transmission  capacity  by  an  additional  400  megavolt-amperes  (MVA), \nstrengthening  and  stabilizing  the  transmission  network  operation.  It  will  guarantee  stable \ntransmission  of  energy  produced  at  Enguri  HPP  to  the  industrial  zone  of  Poti  and  to  Turkey \nthrough  Batumi  substation. In addition,  it  will  help  stabilize transmission power  flows  providing \nadditional event redundancy and lowering the incidence of outages. As energy trading between \nGeorgia and Turkey stabilizes, the risk of incurring power trade contract penalties decreases. \n \nTo accelerate hydropower development, the government asked the Asian Development \n13. \nBank  (ADB)  to  consider  financing  a  run-of-the-river  HPP  with  40\u201350  MW  capacity.  The \ngenerated power will be required to meet the increased demand of domestic water utilities due \nto  rehabilitation  and  expansion  of  the  water  supply  system.12 Part  of  the  generation  may  be \nexported to neighboring countries.  \n \n\n3. \n\nSector Policy and Priorities \n\nThe  government  recognizes  that  the  development  priority  for  power  is  the  effective \n14. \ndevelopment  and  utilization  of  rich  hydropower  resources.13 The  energy  sector  policy  has  a \nstrong  focus  on  (i)  efficient  utilization  of  power  resources;  (ii)  rehabilitation  of  existing \ngeneration,  transmission,  and  distribution  facilities;  (iii)  interconnection  with  neighboring \ncountries  to  promote  energy  trade,  including  transit;  and  (iv)  attraction  of  investment  and \nprivatization. \n \n\n                                                \n9  GSE system blackouts totaled 8 and 2 times, respectively, in 2010 and 2011\u2014high by international standards. \n10 In  2007,  undelivered  energy  due  to  system  faults  totaled  1.2  gigawatt-hours,  representing  a  loss  to  Georgia  of \n\n$706,000 per annum. \n\n11 The Khorga substation is located near Khorga village in Khobi district of Samegrelo region in west Georgia. \n12 ADB  is  providing  a  multitranche  financing  facility  for  $500  million  to  support  Georgia\u2019s  urban  water  supply  and \n\nsanitation sector development plan over 8 years from 2011 to 2020. \n\n13 The  government\u2019s  power  policy  is  set  out  in the  Main  Directions  of  State  Policy  in  the  Power  Sector  of  Georgia, \n\napproved by Parliament on 7 June 2006. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nDue  to  its  geographic  location,  the  government  aims  to  establish  Georgia  to  act  as  a \n15. \ntransit  country  for  import\u2013export  and  transit  operations  of  energy  carriers  in  the  Caucasus \nregion. This will move the Caucasus countries closer to establishing a regional power market to \nfacilitate flexible and mutually profitable cross-border energy exchanges. It will eventually result \nin regional energy resources being used in an efficient and environment-friendly way. \n \n\n4. \n\nADB Operations and Sector Strategy \n\n \nUnder  Strategy  2020,  ADB  will  support  regional  cooperation  activities  to  foster \n16. \naccelerated  economic  growth. 14 ADB  will  help  its  member  countries  realize  growth  through \nintegration  and  closer  links  with  their  neighbors.  The  project  is  in  line  with  ADB's  strategy  for \nGeorgia,  which  focuses  on  upgrading  and  developing  energy  infrastructure  and  enhancing \nregional energy trade by developing the Caucasus regional energy market.15 \n \n17. \nADB has not had lending in Georgia\u2019s energy sector in relation to sovereign operations; \nthe  project  provides  a  unique  opportunity  for  ADB  to  enter  the  sector.  Presently,  government \nfunding is not sufficient on the scale needed for expanding and rehabilitating the power system. \nADB\u2019s  involvement  will  contribute  to filling  the funding gap  and  enhance the  confidence of  the \nprivate sector in investing in power. In addition, the project will complement other ADB support \nfor infrastructure, including the development of the transport and water supply sectors. \n \n18. \nADB will work with the government and development partners to improve the structural, \nlegal,  and  regulatory  framework  needed  to  attract  private  sector  funding  in  the  sector. \nSubstantial  progress  in  sector  reforms  and  strong  improvements  in  the  efficiency  of  power \nthe \noperations  have  been  achieved.  This  has  generated  strong  commitment  among \ndevelopment community to continue supporting the sector through project financing, institutional \nreforms, and capacity building.16 \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n19. \nThe  project  is  an  integral  part  of  Georgia\u2019s  power  development  plan  and  the  selected \ncomponents are under GSE\u2019s investment priorities. The project objective is to enhance regional \npower  trade  by  (i)  rehabilitating  and  improving  11  existing  substations,  and  (ii)  constructing  a \nnew substation. \n \nThe  project  impact  will  be  the  contribution  to  expanding  Georgia\u2019s  power  trade  in  the \n20. \nCaucasus  region.  Net  power  exports  are  expected  to  increase  from  10%  of  domestic  power \ngeneration (2011) to 20% by 2019. The project outcome will be a reliable, stable, and efficient \npower operating system to meet increasing demand for power export and transit. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe project outputs consist of the following components: \n\n(i) \n\nSubstation \nimprovement.

Several transmission and substation \nrehabilitation  projects  funded  by  other  international  development  partners,  such  as  the  World \nBank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank, \nand German development cooperation through KfW are under implementation with satisfactory \nperformance. Goods and works to be financed under the project will be procured in accordance \nwith  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).18 ADB  approved \nadvance procurement  action for  procurement  and  consultants. The government  and  executing \nagencies  have  been  advised  that  approval  of  advance  procurement  does  not  commit  ADB  to \nfinance the project. \n \n26. \nGSE will recruit a consulting firm to support the existing Project Management Unit with \nproject  supervision  and  management.  In  addition,  MOENR  will  recruit  a  consulting  firm  to \nundertake the feasibility  study and safeguards due diligence on potential hydropower projects. \nAll  consulting  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n27. \nthe PAM (footnote 17). \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\n \n\nAspects \n\nArrangements \n\nImplementation period \n\nEstimated completion date \n\nManagement \n(i) \n\nExecuting agency 1 \n\n(ii) \n\nExecuting agency 2 \n\nFebruary 2013\u2013June 2016 \n\n30 June 2016 \n\n \n\nMinistry of Energy and Natural Resources \n\nGeorgian State Electrosystem \n\nProcurement \n\nMethod \n\nContracts \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\nTurnkey contract for  \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nSubstation rehabilitation and improvement \nKhorga 220/110 kV substationa \n \n\n \n\nICB \n\n1 (or 2) \n\n45.0 \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n18 http://www.adb.org/Documents/Guidelines/Procurement/Guidelines-Procurement.pdf \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAspects \n\nArrangements \n\nConsulting services \n\nMethod \n\nPerson-months \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nProject supervision and management \nconsultant (firm) \n\nFeasibility study on potential hydropower \ninvestment project (firm) \n\nQCBS \n(quality: cost ratio, \n90:10) \nQCBS \n(quality: cost ratio, \n90:10) \n\n36 \n\n50 \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\n1.0 \n\n2.0 \n\nAdvance contracting \nDisbursement \n\nProcurement and consultants \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time \nto time) and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the \ngovernment and ADB. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  ICB  = international  competitive  bidding,  kV  =  kilovolt,  QCBS  =  quality-  and  cost-\nbased selection. \na  The Georgian State Electrosystem will procure telecommunication equipment for Khorga substation (estimated at \n\nless than $90,000) using direct contracting. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank \n \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n28. \nThe  current  Georgian  power  operating  system  remains  unstable  and  unreliable. \nRehabilitation and improvement of substation facilities through the installation of modern digital \ncontrol  and  protection  systems  will  significantly  improve  system  reliability  and  security.  The \nprotection  system  is  to  isolate  any  short  circuits  that  may  occur  in  the  system  in  a  time \ncompatible  with  the  security  of  the  power  system.  During  short  circuits,  the  condition  of  the \ntransmission system is unstable. The system must be returned to a stable situation as soon as \npossible by  isolating  the  short  circuit. Ongoing  instablity  may  lead  to  a voltage collapse and a \nregional  or  system  blackout.  Rehabilitation  of  substation  facilities  not  only  helps  GSE  deliver \npower  reliably  and  safely  to  customers  but  also  reduces  transmission  losses  and  lowers \noperating  costs.  The  new  Khorga  substation  will  enhance  transmission  capacity  to  meet  the \nincreasing demand in the western part of Georgia, while the additional capacity will contribute to \npower  transmission  in  the  main  grid.  A  reliable  and  stable  power  transmission  system  is  a \nprecondition  for  efficient  regional  power  trade  as  well  as  investments  in  hydropower \ndevelopment. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\ninternal  rate  of  return, \n\nA financial analysis of the project was carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines.19 \n29. \nAll  financial  costs  and  benefits  are  expressed  at  constant  2012  prices.  Cost  streams  used  to \ndetermine  the  financial \ninvestment,  operation  and \nmaintenance, and taxes, reflect the costs of delivering the estimated benefits. \n \n30. \nThe project\u2019s financial internal rate of return is 3.8%, which compares favorably with the \nestimated weighted average cost of capital of 0.2%, indicating expected financial viability for the \nproject.  Financial  viability  was  gauged  by comparing  the  incremental  costs  and benefits  of the \nwith-project and without-project investment scenarios. The incremental benefits arise from GSE \n\ni.e.  capital \n\n                                                \n19 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.

ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and GSE. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 17). \n \n33. \nGSE  has  adequate  capacity  to  manage  funds  flow  under  the  project.  Until  2006,  GSE \noperated  at  a significant  loss,  and  was nearly  bankrupt  because  of  the failure  of customers to \npay  their  bills.  To  avert  bankruptcy,  in  2008  GSE  entered  into  a  legally  binding  rehabilitation \nplan with its creditors, mainly the Ministry of Finance. The plan sets out plans for investment and \noperating  expenditure  and  a  schedule  of  debt  repayment  in  15  years.  Revenue  collection \nproblems  have  been  resolved  since  2007;  GSE  has  collected  most  of  the  invoiced  amounts. \nGSE reported a profit of GEL19.4 million in 2011.   \n \n34. \nGSE  has  experience  in  managing  externally  financed  projects,  and  maintains  its \naccounting  and  reporting  procedures  according  to  international  financial  reporting  standards. \nThe government has committed to specific financial performance for GSE. Periodic tariff reviews \nwill  be  required  to  overcome  the  risk  of  poor  financial  performance  to  achieve  long-term \nsustainability,  and  to  ensure  that  the  project  does  not  have  an  adverse  fiscal  impact  on  GSE \nand  the  government.  Financial  management  risks  are  assessed  low  after  proposed  risk \nmitigation measures. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n35. \nBy increasing the supply of efficient and reliable electricity to the system, the project will \nincrease  the  reliability  of  the  power  supply  nationwide,  benefiting  the  poor  and  neglected \nregions.  Since  the  rural  poor  are  the  first  to  be  cut  off  from  supply  during  winter  power \nshortages,20 system loss reduction and stronger supply reliability will particularly benefit the poor \nand the socially excluded. Women, who are mainly responsible for household tasks in Georgian \nfamilies, will especially benefit from reliable power supply to households. The project will provide \nequal  opportunities  for  female  staff  to  avail  of  training  opportunities  required  to  operate  the \nsupervisory  control  and  data  acquisition  system.  The  project  will  also  benefit  hydropower \ndevelopment  and  enhance  regional  power  export,  which  will  stimulate  economic  growth  and \nincrease employment opportunities. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nEnvironmental  assessment.  Only  the  construction  of  Khorga  substation  will  involve \n36. \nphysical activities that could potentially result in environmental impacts. The project is classified \nunder environment category B. An initial environmental examination, including an environmental \nmanagement plan in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), was prepared \n\n                                                \n20 Currently,  no  power  supply  deficits  (around  5%  of  the  total  domestic  demand)  during  the  winter  have  to  be \n\nbalanced from imports. \n\n \n\n\fand adopted by the government.21 No significant natural habitats will be affected by the Khorga \nsubstation  development  due  to  its  location  within  an  area  where  the  natural  habitat  has  been \nhighly  modified  by  recent  agricultural  activities  and  human  settlement.  Overall,  the  project  will \ngenerate  only  minor  environmental  impacts  that  can  be  reduced  to  acceptable  levels  through \nimplementation  of  practical  mitigation  measures  normally  associated  with  internationally \nrecognized good engineering practice. \n \n37. \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  Of  all  the  project  components,  only  the  construction  of  the \nKhorga  substation  will  entail  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts.  These  impacts  are \nminor. The area required for the substation belongs to the government and no land acquisition \nwill  be  needed.  However,  three  encroacher  families,  with  no  legal  rights,  cultivate  the  area. \nThese families  will  be  provided  with  compensation for the  crop  income  they  lose  in  2013,  and \nwith allowances for severe impacts and for vulnerable people (the families lose more than 10% \nof  their  income  and  are  registered  as  poor  by  the  province\u2019s  Social  Services  Office).  The \nresettlement plan, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), was prepared \nand adopted by the government.22 \n \n38. \nIndigenous peoples. No indigenous people live in the project area. The project will not \ntrigger  indigenous  peoples  safeguards  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009). The project classification is C. No indigenous peoples development plan is required. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n39. \nThe  government  fully  supports  the  project.  MOENR  will  coordinate  the  work  of \ngovernment  agencies  to  ensure  that  issues,  if  any,  are  resolved  promptly.  Technologies \nadopted  under  the  project  conform  to  international  standards  and  best  practices  that  are \ncommercially  proven  and  widely  used  internationally.  GSE  has  significant  experience  in \nmanaging  projects  in  cooperation  with  international  financial  institutions.  However,  it  remains \nresource-constrained  and  its  ability  to  manage  multiple  large  projects  is  uncertain  without  the \nsupport  of  external  international  expertise.  Another  potential  risk  relates  to  GSE\u2019s  financial \nposition:  a  low  ratio  of  available  cash  from  operations  to  current  capital  expenditure \ncommitments and future debt service obligations, implying continued reliance by GSE on debt to \nfund capital expenditures with little ability to contribute from its own cash reserves.  Risks have \nbeen  analyzed  and  deemed  acceptable  or  mitigated.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are \nsummarized in Table 4 and described in the risk assessment and risk management plan.23 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \n\nGSE has limited project management \ncapacity and lacks experience with \nturnkey contract management. \n\nUnsustainable cash flow from GSE \noperations to cover capital expenditure, \ndebt obligations, and operation and \nmaintenance costs. \n\n \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nInternational consultants will undertake project design, bidding \npreparation support, and evaluation. Project supervision consultants \nwill be recruited to help GSE with project implementation and \nmanagement. \nThe present cost-plus-tariff methodology sufficiently addresses \nimmediate term needs and existing conditions in Georgia. The tariff \nregime allows GSE to apply to the independent tariff regulator\u2014the \nGeorgian National Energy and Water Regulatory Commission\u2014to \nreview the tariff methodology periodically. \n\n \n\n                                                \n21 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nRisks \n\nDelay, failure to complete planned \ninterconnection facilities. \n\nUnexpected increase in prices of \ncommodities and raw materials. \nDelay of procurement due to \ngovernment approvals. \nDelays in construction due to \ninexperience of the turnkey contractors. \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nBulk interconnection transmission lines are under construction and \nadequate financing resources are secured. Supervision consultants \nwere engaged to assist in implementing the project. \nAdequate contingency amounts will be provided. GSE will supplement \nany shortfall. Procurement is at an advanced stage so price increase \nrisks and delay risks are minimized. \n\nADB recruited experienced consultants under the project preparation \ntechnical assistance to support GSE in procuring competitive and \nexperienced turnkey contractors. Experienced supervision consultants \nwill be on-site to assist and monitor the turnkey contractors. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, GSE = Georgian State Electrosystem. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nThe government  and GSE  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants for  the  project, \n\n40. \nThe  government  and  GSE  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n41. \nwhich are set forth in the loan and project agreements. \n \n42. \nNo  withdrawal  will  be  made  until  after  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement,  in  form  and \nsubstance  satisfactory  to  ADB,  has  been  duly  authorized  or  ratified  by,  and  executed  and \ndelivered on behalf of, the government and GSE. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n43. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR30,981,000  to  Georgia  for  the  Regional  Power  Transmission \nEnhancement Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate \nof  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  for  a  term  of  \n32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n23 November 2012 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f    Appendix 1         11 \n\n \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n\n \nAssumptions and Risks \n\n \n\n \n\n \nDesign Summary \n\nImpact \n \nExpanded power trade \nin the Caucasus region \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance Targets \nand Indicators with \nBaselines \n\n \n \nGeorgia power export \nshare increased to 20% \nof domestic generation by \n2019 (2011 baseline: \n10%) \n \nGeorgia power generation \nresources increased to  \n12 TWh by 2019 (2011 \nbaseline: 9.4 TWh) \n\n \n \nMinistry of Energy and \nNatural Resources \npower statistics \n \n \n \nElectricity system \ncommercial operator \nreport on power \ngeneration and trade \n\nOutcome \n \nReliable, stable, and \nefficient power \noperating system in \nGeorgia meets \nincreasing power \ndemand export and \ntransit \n\n \n \nGSE annual report \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGSE annual report \n \n \n \n \n \nGSE annual report \n\n \n \nFull compliance with grid \ncode and stability \nrequirements on power \nsupply trade by 2016 \n(2011 baseline: partly \ncomplied with) \n \nUndelivered electricity to \ncustomers reduced by \n40% to 3,000 MWh by \n2016 (2011 baseline \n5,000 MWh/year) \n \nSubstation capacity on \n220 kV transmission grid \nincreased by 400 MVA in \n2016 (2011 baseline \n5,050 MVA) \n\nAssumptions \n \nGeorgia macroeconomic \nperformance remains stable. \n \nPlanned new hydropower \nprojects in Georgia are \ncommissioned. \n \nElectricity demand in \nneighboring countries, \nparticularly Turkey, \ncontinues to increase \nsteadily. \n \nRisk \n \nRegional insecurity disrupts \nregional power trade. \nAssumptions \n \nContinued progress on \npolicy, regulatory, and \ninstitutional reforms \n \nAdequate GSE resources for \npower grid O&M \n \nLoad growth and system \nexpansion as forecast \n \nAdequate GSE counterpart \nfinancing for associated \nequipment \n \nRisk \nLack of funding for O&M of \nthe existing grids \n\n \n\n\fData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n\n \nAssumptions and Risks \n\nAssumptions \n \nAdequate counterpart \nfunding \n \nAccess to competent \ncontractors and high-quality \nequipment and material \n \nGSE maintains a strong \ncommitment to capacity \ndevelopment. \n \nRisk \nUnexpected increase in \nprices of commodities and \nraw materials. \n \n \n\n12           Appendix 1 \n\n \nDesign Summary \n\nOutputs \n \n1.
