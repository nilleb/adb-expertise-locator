More  broadly,  this  network  is  part  of  a \nlarger network providing links to the ocean ports of Iran and Pakistan to \nthe south, and to the Russian Federation to the north. The project road \nlinks the  Rasht  Valley  in  Tajikistan and  the  capital,  Dushanbe.  Poverty \nincidence  in  the  project  area,  estimated  at  68%,  is  higher  than  the \nnational  poverty  incidence  of  64%.  The  project  outputs  include  (i) \nimprovement of 89 kilometers (km) of the central and border sections of \nthe  Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz  border  road  and  60  km  of  rural  roads;  (ii) \nimproved  sustainability  of  Tajikistan\u2019s  road  network  through  increased \nfinancing  of  road  maintenance,  procurement  of  road  maintenance \nequipment, installation of vehicle weighing systems, and implementation \nof  pilot  cases  of  tendering  road  maintenance;  (iii)  strengthened \ninstitutional  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT);  (iv)  improved \ngovernance  in  MOT  through  the  strengthening  of  its  accounting \ndepartment; and (v) improved road safety through the strengthening of \nthe Transport Safety and Security Unit. \n \nThe road sections to be rehabilitated under the Project are bottlenecks \nto  regional  trade  due  to  their  poor  condition.  In  particular,  these  road \nsections  obstruct  trade  between  much  of  Tajikistan,  Afghanistan,  and \nadjacent  countries  to  the  south,  and  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  the  Xinjiang \nUygur  Autonomous  Region  of  the  PRC,  and  neighboring  countries  to \nthe north. By improving key sections of the road from Dushanbe to the \nTajik-Kyrgyz border, the Project will substantially reduce this obstruction \nto trade, and facilitate regional trade and cooperation. \n \nThe  project  road  provides  the  only  substantial  link  between  the  Rasht \nValley and Dushanbe. Before independence, the immediate project area \nin  the  Rasht  Valley  produced  large  quantities  of  fruit,  which  were \nmarketed throughout the former Soviet Union. However, fruit production \nin the project area has declined substantially since independence. Many \ninhabitants  of  the  project  area  live  in  rural  areas  where  poverty \nincidence  is  particularly  severe.  The  improvement  of  the  Dushanbe\u2013\n\n\fii \n\n \n\nKyrgyz  border  road  and  selected  rural  roads  will  improve  access  to \nDushanbe  and  other  cities  in  the  region,  which  have  higher  prices  for \nagricultural  products  and  more  job  opportunities  than  in  the  immediate \nproject  area.  The  Project  will  lead  to  reduced  transport  costs,  most  of \nwhich will be passed on to transport users. \n \nThe Project includes a $500,000 ADF-IX grant-financed component on \nHIV/AIDS  and  migration,  to  be  carried  out  by  the  Ministry  of  Health\u2019s \nNational  HIV/AIDS  Center.  The  ADF  grant-financed  component  will \ndevelop  an \nintegrated,  community-based  and  gender-responsive \napproach  to  the  prevention  of  HIV/AIDS  and  sexually-transmitted \ninfections  (STI).  Subcomponents  include  (i)  capacity  development  for \nlocal  government  agencies  and  NGOs,  including  training  to  implement \nthe  Government\u2019s  policies,  strategies,  and  regulations  in  HIV/STI \nprevention,  anti-trafficking,  and  regulation  of  migration;  (ii)  behavior \nchange and communication for local communities and high-risk groups \nto  reduce  risks  along  the  road  corridor  and  establish  an  environment \nconducive  to  maintaining  safe  behavior  among  seasonal  migrants, \nwomen,  intravenous  drug  users,  sex  workers,  and  transport  and \nconstruction operators; and (iii) clinical support, through the provision of \nHIV  testing  kits  and  STI  treatment  packages  to  health  clinics,  to  help \nthem  meet  the  incremental  needs  of  mobile  populations  and  local \ncommunities. \n \nThe  project  impact  will  be  increased  trade  in  the  region  and  increased \neconomic  growth  in  the  immediate  project  area.  The  project  outcome \nwill  be  improved  and  sustainable  regional  and  national  road  networks. \nThe  broader  region  served  by  the  road  network  being  rehabilitated \nunder  the  Project  stretches  from  Kazakhstan  to  Afghanistan,  with  links \nto  the  Russian  Federation  in  the  north,  the  PRC  to  the  east,  and \nPakistan and Iran to the south. The immediate project area in the Rasht \nValley  northeast  of  Dushanbe  was  the  scene  of  heavy  fighting  during \nthe civil conflict in the 1990s. \n \nThe total project cost, including physical contingencies, price escalation, \nand  interest  and  other  charges  during  construction,  is  estimated  at \n$39.5  million  equivalent,  of  which  $26.5  million  (67%)  is  foreign \nexchange cost and $13.0 million (33%) equivalent is local currency cost. \n \n\n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nLoan \nGrant \n \n\nSource \nADB \n \n \n \nGovernment \n \nADB=Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nSubtotal \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n26.1 \n0.4 \n26.5 \n0.0 \n26.5 \n\n($ million)\nTotal \nCost \n \n29.5 \n0.5 \n30.0 \n9.5 \n39.5 \n\n \n3.4 \n0.1 \n3.5 \n9.5 \n13.0 \n\n \nImpact and \nOutcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nA loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR20,353,000  from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources  will  be  provided  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nstandard  terms  and  conditions  for  loans  from  its  Special  Funds \nresources.

In addition to the PIU staff implementing ongoing \nprojects, additional staff will be appointed to the PIU before the award of \nthe  civil  works  contracts.  The  PIU  head  will  be  supported  by \nprofessional and clerical staff with expertise and experience in financial \nroad  engineering;  construction  supervision;  contract \naccounting; \nadministration;  and  monitoring  of  environmental,  social,  and \nresettlement  issues.  One  PIU  staff  will  monitor  environmental,  social, \nand resettlement issues.  \n \n\nthrough \n\n \nProcurement \n \n\n \nExecuting Agency  Ministry  of  Transport  for  the  loan-financed  components;  Ministry  of \nHealth\u2019s  National  HIV/AIDS  Center  for  the  ADF-IX  grant  financed \ncomponent on HIV/AIDS and migration. \n \nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Contracts valued in \nexcess  of  $0.5  million  for  goods  and  $1.0  million  for  civil  works  will  be \ninternational  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  among \nprocured \nprequalified  bidders.  Supply  contracts  for  the  equipment  and  supplies \nhave  been  packaged  into  four  contracts,  one  of  which  will  be  financed \nfollowing \nICB  procedures.  Two  supply  contracts  not  exceeding \n$500,000 will be procured through international shopping. One contract \nfor equipment and supplies for the HIV/AIDS and migration component, \nnot  exceeding  $100,000,  will  be  procured  through  direct  purchase  or \ninternational  shopping.  Civil  works  have  been  packaged  into  five \ncontracts. One will be financed following ICB procedures. The other four \nwill  be  financed  following  local  competitive  bidding  procedures.  ADB \napproved  advance  action  for  procurement  of  civil  works  on  18  August \n2005. \n \nInternational consulting services for 46 person-months will  be provided \nby  a  firm,  for  construction  supervision,  project  impact  monitoring  and \nevaluation,  implementation  of  measures  to  improve  road  safety,  and \nproject  management.  The  international  consultants  will  provide  on-the-\njob  training  for  the  counterpart  staff  and  domestic  consultants.  In \nassociation  with  the  international  consultants,  400  person-months  of \n\n \nConsulting \nServices \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nfirms \n\nfor  construction \ndomestic  consulting  services  will  be  provided \nsupervision,  contract  management,  and  other \ntechnical  advisory \nassistance,  as  well  as  for  helping  the  international  consultants  monitor \nthe social and poverty impact of the Project through household surveys \nand  data  analysis.  Consulting  services  for  13  international  person-\nmonths and 185 domestic person-months will be required to implement \nthe  HIV/AIDS  and  migration  component.  Consulting  services  for  6 \ninternational  person-months  will  be  required  to  provide  training  for \nfunction.  Consulting \nMOT\u2019s  accounting  department  and  auditing \nservices  will  also  be  required  for  project  auditing.  For  all  consulting \nservices,  consultants  will  be  recruited  through  an  international  firm  in \nassociation  with  domestic \nthrough  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection,  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  by  Asian  Development  Bank  and  Its  Borrowers  and  other \narrangements satisfactory for the engagement of domestic consultants. \nFull technical proposals will be required for the project supervision and \nmonitoring  services,  and  simplified  technical  proposals  for  the  other \nconsulting services. \n \nThe  region  will  benefit  from  the  Project  through  increased  trade,  while \nthe  immediate  project  area  will  benefit  through  increased  economic \ngrowth.  By  improving  key  sections  of  the  road  from  Dushanbe  to  the \nTajik-Kyrgyz border, the Project will substantially reduce the obstruction \nto trade caused by the poor road condition and will facilitate increased \nregional  trade.  Improvement  of  the  road  will  facilitate  transport  of  fruit \ngrown  in  the  project  area  to  Dushanbe  and  the  regional  markets,  and \nlead to increased agricultural production. The economic internal rate of \nreturn for the Project is 15.4%, and the net present value is $9.8 million. \nTajikistan is estimated to receive 76% of the Project\u2019s net benefits; the \nPRC,  12%;  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  6%;  Afghanistan,  5%;  and  other \ncountries,  1%.  Users  of  passenger  and  freight  transport  and  the \nGovernment  and/or  economy  will  each  receive  about  22\u201323%  of  the \nproject  benefits  accruing  to  Tajikistan.  The  Project  will  help  reduce \npoverty in the project area by directly benefiting approximately 180,000 \npeople,  including  an  estimated  120,000  poor  people.  The  Project  will \ngenerate  approximately  50,000  person-months  of  employment  for \nunskilled labor. \n \nThe Project has been designed to reduce potential risks, which include \ndelays in implementation due to inadequate implementation capacity of \nthe executing agency, failure to provide counterpart financing in a timely \nmanner,  the  traffic  forecast  not  being  realized,  inadequate  road \nmaintenance,  and  lack  of  security  in  the  project  area.  The  Project \nincludes  a  number  of  measures  to  mitigate  the  risk  of  implementation \ndelays. The existing PIU will implement the Project, and additional staff \nwill  be  hired  to  assist  in  implementation.  Advance  action  has  been \napproved. The PIU is familiar with ADB procedures and will be able to \nmake  full  use  of  the  advance  action  provisions.  The  Government  has \nassured  the  project  processing  missions  that  it  can  provide  the \nnecessary  funds  for  all  ongoing  ADB  road  rehabilitation  projects  in  a \ntimely  manner.  In  addition,  ADB  is  monitoring  the  Public  Investment \n\n \nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nthat \n\nto  ensure \n\nProgram restrictions agreed to by the Government and the International \nMonetary  Fund \nthe  Project  does  not  cause \ndisbursements to exceed agreed limits.  \n \nThere is some risk that the traffic forecast will not materialize, especially \nthe generated traffic arising from increased international trade. There is \nalso  a  risk  that  the  project  roads  will  not  be  properly  maintained  and \nthus the full benefits of the Project will not be realized. The Government \nis  aware  of  the  importance  of  road  maintenance,  particularly  in  the \nproject  area,  which  is  mountainous  and  prone  to  landslides  and  rock \nfalls.  The  project  design  includes  elements  to  address  the  risks  of \ninadequate  financing  and  implementation  of  road  maintenance  for  the \nproject  roads.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  the  loan  assurances \nrequiring the allocation of specific levels of financing for maintaining the \nproject  roads,  in  addition  to  the  assurances  on  financing  for  road \nmaintenance nationwide. The Project also includes procurement of road \nmaintenance equipment, which will be used solely on the project roads. \nThe immediate project area is in an area that was placed under a United \nNations security restriction following the civil war. However, the security \nstatus was upgraded in late 2002 and again in September 2005 and is \nexpected to remain in the upgraded condition. \n\n

following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan,  and  (ii)  a  proposed  grant,  both  to  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  for  the  Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz \nBorder Road Rehabilitation Project (Phase II). \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nThe  road  sections to  be  improved  under  the  Project  form  an  integral  part  of  a  regional \n2. \nroad network in Central Asia that directly links Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz  Republic, the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Uzbekistan. More broadly, this network is \npart of a larger network providing links to the ocean ports of Pakistan and Iran to the south, and \nto  the  Russian  Federation  to  the  north.  The  feasibility  study  for  the  Project  was  prepared \nthrough  an  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  technical  assistance  (TA).1  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework for the proposed Project is in Appendix 1. \n \nA. \n \n3. \nUnder the former Soviet Union (FSU), the regional road network existed only as part of \nan internal network, with no links to Afghanistan or the PRC. Following the breakup of the Soviet \nUnion,  the  condition  of  the  national  roads  comprising  the  network  deteriorated  substantially \nbecause  of  the  decrease  in  financing  for  road  maintenance  in  most  countries  (arising  from \nbudget  constraints)  and  civil  conflict  in  Tajikistan  and  Afghanistan.  However,  the  situation  has \nbeen  improving  over  the  last  several  years  because  financing  for  maintenance  has  generally \nbeen increasing and the civil conflicts have ended. Much of the regional road network is being \nrehabilitated  by  ADB  and  other  international  and  bilateral  agencies,  with  many  of  the  projects \nalready completed. The ADB-financed first phase of the rehabilitation of the Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz \nborder  road  is  being  implemented.2  Among  the  recently  approved  projects  to  improve  the \nnetwork are (i) the ADB-financed project to rehabilitate part of the road from Osh to the border \nwith the PRC3 and (ii) the project financed by the Government of the United States to construct \na  bridge  over  the  Pyandzh  River.  The  river  forms  the  border  between  Afghanistan  and \nTajikistan, and is only passable by ferry and only during certain months. Additional projects to \nimprove  remaining  sections  of  the  network  are  planned.  ADB\u2019s  regional  program  for  Central \nAsia includes a loan to rehabilitate the remaining section of the Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz border road \nin  Tajikistan  (standby  for  2007).  The  Islamic  Development  Bank  and  bilateral  agencies  are  in \ntalks  with  the  governments  of  Tajikistan  and  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  to  improve  other  network \nsections. However, the road link from Nurobod in Tajikistan to Sary Tash in the Kyrgyz Republic \n(on  the  road  from  Osh  to  the  PRC\u2013Kyrgyz  Republic  border)  has  not  been  rehabilitated.  The \nsections of this road in Tajikistan, in particular, constitute a bottleneck to regional trade because \nof their poor condition. By removing this obstruction to trade, the Project will help realize the full \nbenefits of the completed, ongoing, and planned projects for the network. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2004.

Manila. \n\n3  ADB.  2004.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  and \nTechnical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  for  the  Southern  Transport  Corridor  Road  Rehabilitation \nProject. Manila. \n\n\f 2 \n\nThe  road  subsector  is  the  most  important  component  of  transport  in  Tajikistan.  The \n4. \ncombined length of the road network is about 26,000 kilometers (km), consisting of 4,800 km of \nnational roads and 21,200 km of local roads. The Ministry  of Transport (MOT) has jurisdiction \nover  13,800  km,  including  all  national  roads  and  42%  of  the  local  roads  (9,000  km).  The \nremaining 12,300 km of local roads not under MOT are mostly rural and farm roads. The major \npart of the network was constructed before 1970. Inadequate maintenance, and damage from \ncivil conflict and natural disasters have left it in a state of severe deterioration. Of the national \nroads, 28% are asphalt, 46% are other pavement, 18% are gravel, and 8% are earth. More than \n70% of the roads are considered to be in poor or very poor condition. The scope of the network \nis  considered  adequate  to  accommodate  existing  traffic  levels  and  support  economic  growth \nand  sustainable  development  in  the  medium  term  as  the  network  was  constructed  during  the \nSoviet era, when transport demand was much higher. Since independence, the road transport \nfleet  has  been  increasingly  privatized  and  private  automobile  ownership  has  significantly \nincreased.  A  road  subsector  analysis  and  the  Transport  Sector  Policy  Reform  Plan  are  in \nAppendix 2. \n \nB. \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nObstacles to Development \n\n \nRegional  Cooperation.  Increasing  trade  is  key  to  accelerating  economic  growth  and \n5. \nreducing  poverty  in  Central  Asia,  particularly  in  Tajikistan  and  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  with  their \nsmall  populations  and  limited  natural  resources  (except  for  hydropower).  Even  in  the  Central \nAsian  republics  (CARs)  with  more  natural  resources\u2014such  as  Kazakhstan  and  the  Xinjiang \nUygur  Autonomous  Region  of  the  PRC  (Xinjiang)\u2014the  contribution  of  trade  to  increased \neconomic  growth  is  constrained  by  their  landlocked  status  and  distances  to  ocean  ports. \nImprovement  of  the  regional  road  network  is  therefore  essential  to  increase  economic  growth. \nThree core problems constrain the development of regional road transport in the CARs: (i) lack \nof  a  unified  regulatory  framework  that  encourages  competition,  (ii)  delays  and  excessive \ncharges at borders, and (iii) physical deterioration of the network.4 ADB is involved in solving all \nthese problems. Development of a unified regulatory framework is one of the issues being dealt \nwith  as  part  of  the  Transport  Sector  Coordinating  Committee\u2019s  work  under  the  Central  Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) program. Regional cooperation in improving customs \nprocessing  is  being  promoted  under  regional  projects  such  as  the  ADB-financed  Regional \nCustoms Modernization and Infrastructure Development Project.5 The deterioration of the road \nnetwork  is  being  addressed  through  a  two-pronged  approach.  First,  ADB  is  continuing  its \nassistance  program  to  improve  roads  comprising  part  of  the  regional  network.  Second,  the \nimplementation  of  these  projects  includes  policy  dialogue  to  increase  financing  for  road \nmaintenance and to carry out institutional reforms to improve the efficiency of the maintenance \nsystem. The Project will continue to improve the road network through both of these avenues. \n \n6. \nThe road sections to be rehabilitated under the Project form a bottleneck that obstructs \ntrade between much of Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and adjacent countries to the south; and Osh in \nthe Kyrgyz Republic (a traditional crossroads for trade), Xinjiang (with its population of 19 million \nand  dynamic  economy),  and  neighboring  countries  to  the  north.  The  significance  of  this \nbottleneck is evident in the PRC\u2019s share of total trade of countries in the region. Kazakhstan and \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance for Reassessment of the Regional Transport Sector Strategy. Manila. \n5  ADB.  2004.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  Proposed  Loans  and \nTechnical  Assistance  Grants  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  for  the  Regional  Customs \nModernization and Infrastructure Development Project. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nthe  Kyrgyz  Republic  have  direct  road  access  to  the  PRC  that  does  not  pass  through  this \nbottleneck. The PRC\u2019s share of total trade of these countries is 14.2% and 23.0%, respectively. \nHowever, the road connecting the PRC with Tajikistan and Afghanistan does pass through the \nbottleneck. The PRC\u2019s share of total trade with these countries is only 1.9% and less than 0.1%, \nrespectively. By improving key sections of the road from Dushanbe to the Tajik\u2013Kyrgyz border, \nthe  Project  will  substantially  reduce  this  obstruction  to  trade  and  will  facilitate  trade  and \ncooperation  between  countries  north  of  the  project  road,  including  the  PRC  and  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic,  and  those  to  the  south,  including  Tajikistan  and  Afghanistan  (para.  55).  The \nimprovement of the project road will also improve access to ocean ports in Pakistan, and lower \ntransport costs for CAR exports and imports. \n \n7. \nThe  increased  trade  and  regional  cooperation  arising  from  the  Project  will  yield \nsubstantial  benefits  for  the  region.  In  addition  to  the  direct  benefits  from  increased  trade,  the \nProject  will  improve  efficiency  in  the  region\u2019s  economies.  The  reduced  transport  costs  and \nremoval  of  the  bottleneck  to  regional  trade  will  result  in  increased  demand  for  exports  and \nimports,  thus  increasing  the  profitability  of  export-oriented  industries  and  decreasing  the \nprofitability  of  import-substituting  industries.  Economic  resources  will  therefore  shift  from  the \nimport-substituting  industries  to  export-oriented  industries,  and  increase  economic  efficiency. \nThis shift will also lead to increased employment, since export industries include agriculture and \nlight  industry  such  as  textiles.  In  the  medium-term,  this  shift  of  resources  to  sectors  in  which \ncountries have comparative advantages will increase total output and living standards through \nmore efficient resource allocation and increased productivity.6 Because some of these benefits \narise from economic adjustments occurring over the medium-term and data are insufficient, the \neconomic analysis follows a conservative approach limited to direct benefits accruing primarily \nto Tajikistan, the PRC, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Afghanistan (para. 54). \n \n8. \nEconomic  Growth  and  Poverty  Reduction.  Tajikistan  has  significantly  reduced \npoverty  in  recent  years.  Strong  economic  growth,  policy  reforms,  and  a  favorable  economic \nenvironment  led  to  sustained  poverty  reduction  from  82%  in  1999  to  64%  in  2003.  However, \npoverty  is  still  highest  among  the  CARs,  with  a  per  capita  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  of \n$310 in 2004.7 Although poverty in the project area has also been reduced, it is still higher than \nfor  the  country.  Poverty  incidence  in  the  project  area  is  estimated  at  68%\u2014significantly  lower \nthan the 91% estimated for the project area for phase I, which is adjacent to the project area for \nphase  II.  Poverty  in  the  project  area  was  reduced  primarily  because  of  increased  remittances \nfrom residents working in the Russian Federation, rather than because of increased agricultural \nproduction, the primary source of livelihood. Before independence, the project area in the Rasht \nValley had large orchards and was a large producer of fruit that was marketed throughout the \nFSU. Fruit production in the project area has declined substantially since independence, and is \nestimated at only 50% of production capacity. The decline is due to (i) destruction from the civil \nconflict,  (ii)  disappearance  of  previous  markets,  (iii)  the  absence  of  an  effective  marketing \nsystem to replace what was used in the FSU, and (iv) the deterioration in road conditions, which \nresulted in high costs for transport and damage to produce. Fruit production requires a relatively \nlong-term  investment,  as  orchards  are  generally  not  substantially  productive  until  7\u20138  years \nafter planting. Rehabilitation of the project road is a prerequisite for investment in orchards and \nfor economic growth in the project area.  \n \n9. \nThe  project  road  provides  the  only  substantial  link  between  the  Rasht  Valley  and  the \ncapital, Dushanbe. Many of the inhabitants of the project area live in rural areas where poverty \n\n                                                 \n6  ADB analytical input for the forthcoming UNDP. 2005. Central Asia Human Development Report. New York. \n7  ADB. 2005. Tajikistan: Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008). Manila. \n\n\f 4 \n\nis particularly severe. The improvement of the Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz border road and selected rural \nroads  will  ease  access  to  Dushanbe  and  other  cities,  where  higher  prices  are  paid  for \nagricultural products and where there are more jobs. The Project will lead to reduced transport \ncosts,  most  of  which  will  be  passed  on  to  transport  users.  Numerous  agriculture  and  other \npoverty  reduction  projects  are  being  implemented  in  the  project  area  by  other  international \norganizations. Improving transport in the area will maximize the benefits of these projects. \n \n10. \nRoad Subsector. MOT is responsible for planning and coordinating the maintenance of \nthe  road  network.  Maintenance  of  the  road  network  throughout  Tajikistan  virtually  ceased \nfollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union due to inadequate funding, and this is reflected in the \ndeteriorated condition of the road network. The situation was exacerbated by the civil war, when \nnumerous  bridges  and  road  sections  were  damaged.  ADB  has  been  addressing  this  issue \nthrough policy dialogue. Financing for road maintenance has increased greatly since 2003.  \n \n11. \nThe Transport Safety and Security Unit (TSSU) of MOT\u2019s Transport Policy Department is \nresponsible  for  the  physical  aspects  of  road  safety,  including  road  conditions  and  signs. \nTajikistan\u2019s road safety record in the mid-1990s was poor, with a fatality rate of 407 per 10,000 \nvehicles.8  Road  safety  has  improved  since  then  because  of  MOT\u2019s  Accident  Prevention  Plan, \nwhich  monitors  about  30  indicators  annually.  Although  the  number  of  vehicles  has  increased \nsubstantially,  the  rates  of  road  accidents  and  fatalities  have  remained  relatively  stable,  with  a \nfatality  rate  of  396  per  10,000  vehicles  in  2001.  However,  the  number  of  accidents  has \nincreased since 2000. There were 1,378 accidents nationwide in 2003 compared with 1,333 in \n2000. In the Rasht Valley, the site of the Project, the number of accidents increased from 20 in \n2002 to 22 in 2003, and the number of fatalities doubled from 14 in 2002 to 28 in 2003. \n \n12. \nOverloaded vehicles cause premature deterioration of roads. Tajikistan is a party to the \nIntergovernmental Agreement on Vehicle Dimension and Weights which has been signed by 10 \nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. Two national decrees have been issued \nto make it effective9 but are not enforced because of lack of vehicle weighing equipment. The \nagreement  and  the  decrees  require  that  overloaded  vehicles  obtain  a  special  permit  to  enter \nTajikistan and the other countries, which are allowed to charge for it. In practice, while Tajikistan \nissues permits jointly through MOT, the Ministry of State Revenue, and the Ministry of Internal \nAffairs, there is no schedule of payments and, therefore, no payments are being collected.  \n \n\n2. \n\nGovernment and ADB Strategies \n\n \nThe  Project  is  fully  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic  objectives  for  regional \n13. \ncooperation in Central Asia, medium-term strategic plan, and regional transport sector strategy. \nThe Project forms part of the core program of the Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program \nfor the CAREC countries for 2005\u20132006. The Project directly supports two of the four long-term \nstrategic  objectives  that  are  identified  in  the  Regional  Cooperation  Strategy  and  Program:  (i) \nincreasing  trade  and  integration  with  large  markets,  including  securing  the  CARs\u2019  access  to \nmarkets  in  South  Asia,  the  PRC,  Iran,  Turkey,  and  the  Russian  Federation;  and  (ii)  improving \neconomic  cooperation  to  reduce  transport  costs  and  to  facilitate  trade.  Within  the  context  of \nthese  long-term  objectives,  ADB\u2019s  medium-term  strategic  plan  for  regional  cooperation \ncomprises  two  components.  The  first,  the  core  program,  continues  ADB\u2019s  focus  on  three \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB. 1995. Technical Assistance for Regional Initiatives in Road Safety. Manila. \n9  Decree  93  of  11  March  2000  on  adoption  of  the  agreement  on  vehicle  dimensions  and  weights  for  international \nroad  transportation  among  CIS  countries;  and  Decree  82  of  4  March  2005  on  adoption  of  the  agreement  to \nintroduce international certificate for weighing cargo vehicles in the territories of CIS countries. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nsectors, including transport and trade. The strategic plan recognizes that adequate capacity in \nthese sectors is essential for achieving sustainable economic growth, private sector growth, and \nforeign  direct  investment,  which  will  create  jobs  and  reduce  poverty,  but  only  with  greater \ninfrastructure capacity. The plan also recognizes that much of the integrated capacity developed \nunder  the  FSU  has  fallen  into  disrepair  and  that  rehabilitation  is  best  undertaken  regionally. \nADB\u2019s regional transport sector strategy for the CARs is to (i) provide physical links to all parts \nof  the  region,  (ii)  provide  access  to  external  markets,  (iii)  integrate  and  upgrade  transport \ninfrastructure,  and  (iv)  enhance  competitiveness.  The  strategy  focuses  on  developing  regional \neast-west  and  north-south  transport  corridors  by  using  existing  infrastructure  to  link  state \ncapitals and local production centers to regional and international markets. \n \n14. \nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  for  Tajikistan  focuses  on  promoting  growth  through  rural \ndevelopment and regional cooperation. Improving transport infrastructure is cited as an aspect \nof both rural development and regional cooperation. The Project is clearly consistent with ADB\u2019s \ncountry  strategy  in  its  objective  to  increase  regional  trade  by  improving  the  regional  road \nnetwork and rural roads. The Tajikistan Country Strategy and Program Update for 2006\u20132008 \n(footnote 7) specifies a loan for the third phase of the rehabilitation of the road for $20 million \nfrom the regional assistance pipeline, as standby for 2007 and firm for 2008. \n \n15. \nThe  Government\u2019s  Transport  Sector  Policy  Statement  outlines  the  policy  directive \nrequiring  development  of  the  transport  sector  to  be  based  on  market-oriented  reforms  and \nrestructuring  to  improve  efficiency.  The  Government\u2019s  strategy  for  the  road  subsector  is  to \nrehabilitate and maintain road infrastructure and to develop an efficient road transport industry \nthrough more private sector provision of transport services, greater reliance on cost recovery to \nfinance road maintenance, and rehabilitation of critical parts of the road network and transport \nservices  that  remain  under  state  control.  The  Government  aims  to  increase  expenditures  on \nroad  maintenance,  and  has  been  doing  so  in  line  with  ADB's  policy  dialogue.  It  also  aims  to \nchange  the  regulatory  framework  to  encourage  greater  private  sector  involvement  in  road \ntransport.  The  Government\u2019s  strategy  includes  developing  international  road  corridors  to \nfacilitate international trade. \n \n\n3. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n \n16. \nThe project design incorporates lessons learned from ADB\u2019s loan and TA operations in \ngeneral, ADB\u2019s road subsector operations in Tajikistan, and other projects and TAs in the CARs. \nOne lesson learned from ADB\u2019s impact evaluation study on rural roads and poverty reduction10 \nis  that  the  long-term  benefits  of  road  projects  can  be  threatened  by  neglecting  road \nmaintenance.  The  study  recommends  devolving  responsibility  for  road  maintenance  to  local \ncommunities,  particularly  for  rural  roads  to  ensure  long-term  sustainability.  An  ADB  TA \nperformance audit report11 found that expenditures on road maintenance should be increased in \nKazakhstan,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  Mongolia.  The  Project  has  loan  covenants  requiring \nspecified increases in financing for national road maintenance and specified levels of financing \nfor project roads, and provides for the purchase of maintenance equipment for the project roads. \nAn ADB special evaluation study12 notes that project implementation units (PIU) are a legitimate \nmeans  of  implementing  large  investment  projects,  but  cautions  against  the  proliferation  of \nseparate PIUs for individual projects. The Project has taken this into account by agreeing with \n\n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2002. Impact of Rural Roads on Poverty Reduction: A Case Study-Based Analysis.

This PIU is physically \nlocated  in  MOT\u2019s  headquarters.  Many  PIU  staff  members  previously  worked  for  MOT,  and \nofficials and staff members of MOT and the PIU interact daily (para 41). \n \nADB is implementing two road rehabilitation projects in Tajkistan. Implementation of the \n17. \nRoad Rehabilitation Project13 had been delayed, but it is now proceeding without problems and \nwill  be  completed  in  December  2005.  The  implementation  delays  were  mainly  because  of  (i) \nlack  of  advance  procurement  action,  (ii)  a  delay  in  declaring  the  loan  effective,  and  (iii)  the \ndetailed  design  being  prepared  by  the  supervision  consultants  under  the  project.  Since  there \nwas no advance action under this project, the supervision consultants, who were responsible for \npreparing the detailed design, could not be recruited until the loan had been declared effective, \nfurther  delaying  the  preparation  of  the  detailed  design  and  the  procurement  of  civil  works.  A \nlesson  related  to  this  project\u2019s  policy  dialogue  is  that  funding  road  maintenance  remains  a \nchallenge  given  Tajikistan\u2019s  fiscal  constraints.  These  lessons  have  been  incorporated  into  the \ndesign of the proposed Project. Advance action for procurement for the Project was approved \non  18  August  2005.  The  PIU  handling  the  ongoing  projects  is  functioning  well,  and  will \nimplement the proposed Project with the assistance of additional staff. Finally, the Government \nand  ADB  have  agreed  on  loan  assurances  that  will  adequately  finance  maintenance  of  the \nproject roads and provide for significant annual increases in the financing of road maintenance \nnationally,  without  exceeding  Tajikistan\u2019s  budget.  ADB  is  implementing  the  Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz \nBorder  Road  Rehabilitation  Project  (Phase  I)  (footnote  2).  Although  mobilization  of  the \ncontractor  was  delayed,  it  was  due  to  the  contractor\u2019s  internal  problems,  and  this  project  is \nexpected to meet the original completion date. \n \nADB has implemented a program loan for the transport and energy sectors, as well as \n18. \nan  emergency  infrastructure  rehabilitation  project  focusing  on  damaged  roads,  bridges,  and \nother  infrastructure.  The  program  completion  report  for  the  program  loan14  found  that,  while \nachievements  were  substantial,  the  extensive  program  of  transport  and  energy  policy  reforms \nwas too ambitious.15 The primary lesson learned was that covenants should be tailored to the \ncountry\u2019s capability to achieve them. The policy reform agenda of the  Project thus focuses on \nthree areas, all of which are core aspects of the road subsector, and the Government and ADB \ndialogued extensively to ensure that Tajikistan is capable of implementing the loan assurances.  \n \n\n4. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n \n19. \nADB  has  provided  more  assistance  to  the  road  subsector  than  any  other  international \norganization  (Appendix  3).  The  Islamic  Development  Bank,  Government  of  Iran,  and  Kuwait \nFund have also provided large amounts of assistance to the transport sector.  \n \nC. \n \n20. \nADB has been intensively involved in policy dialogue on the transport sector, particularly \nthe road subsector. The dialogue covered financing of road maintenance, commercialization of \ntransport  services,  improvement  of  transport  management  efficiency  by  improving  key \ninstitutions,  separation  of  regulatory  and  operational  functions  of  the  sector,  and  other  areas \nrelated to the transition to a market  economy. As a result of policy dialogue and ADB TA, the \n                                                 \n13 ADB.  2000.

MOT is responsible for \nplanning and coordinating all modes of transport. Tariffs for road freight have been completely \nderegulated;  road  haulage  organizations  enter  into  agreements  with  customers  at  negotiated \nrates. Tariffs for passenger transport are still subject to some official regulation, e.g., minimum \nfares,  but  in  practice  fares  vary  according  to  competition.  The  Project  continues  the  policy \ndialogue on road subsector sustainability, institutional development, and road safety. \n \n\n1. \n\nRoad Subsector Sustainability \n\n \n21. \nRoad Maintenance Financing. Increasing the financing of road maintenance is key to \nimproving the sustainability of the road subsector. Both ongoing road subsector projects include \nloan  covenants  on  road  maintenance  financing.  They  are  based  on  a  two-part  approach  to \nincrease allocations for maintenance, and to ensure that maintenance has high priority among \ntotal  sector  expenditures.  First,  the  covenants  require  annual  real  increases  in  budget \nallocations  for  road  maintenance  and  rehabilitation.  Second,  the  covenants  require  that \nallocations for road maintenance and rehabilitation comprise specified percentages of total road \nsubsector expenditures. Allocations for road maintenance and rehabilitation are required to be \nincreased  by  15%  per  year  during  2005\u20132007  and  to  comprise  at  least  80%  of  total  road \nsubsector  spending,  excluding  the  construction  of  the  Anzob  Tunnel  on  the  Dushanbe\u2013\nKhujand\u2013Tashkent road, as it is considered a national priority project.  \n \n22. \nThe  Government  has  exceeded  the  targets  for  annual  increases  in  financing  for  road \nmaintenance  and  rehabilitation.  Approved  budget  allocations  for  road  maintenance  and \nrehabilitation  increased  substantially  in  2004  and  2005.  The  allocation  for  2005  is  57%  higher \nthan in 2004. Compliance with the covenant requiring that road maintenance and rehabilitation \ncomprise  at  least  80%  of  total  road  subsector  spending  has  been  more  challenging,  although \nperformance  is  improving.  The  proportion  was  59%  in  2004  for  actual  expenditures,  and  has \nimproved  to  79%  for  2005.  The  covenant  excludes  from  the  proportion  expenditures  for  the \nconstruction of the Anzob Tunnel. If expenditures for the construction of avalanche galleries on \nthe  approaches  leading  up  to  the  tunnel  are  excluded,  the  proportions  for  2004  and  2005 \nincrease  to  76%  and  86%  respectively,  bringing  the  Government  into  compliance  for  2005. \nUnder  the  proposed  Project,  the  Government  will  continue  to  address  the  financing  of  road \nmaintenance.  It  will  ensure  that  actual  expenditures  for  maintenance  (including  emergency \nmaintenance  but  not  rehabilitation  and  new  construction)  of  MOT  roads  will  be  increased  at \nleast  at  the  same  rate  as  the  increases  in  the  overall  national  budget  during  2008\u20132009.  The \nGovernment  will  allocate  $90,000  per  year  (adjusted  for  inflation)  for  routine  maintenance16  of \nthe  sections  of  the  Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz  border  road  rehabilitated  under  the  Project  and  will \nensure that the rural roads rehabilitated under the Project are adequately maintained. \n \n23. \nRoad  Maintenance  Tenders.  The  Project  will  improve  sustainability  of  the  road \nsubsector  by  introducing  tendering  for  road  maintenance  with  private  sector  participation.  The \nGovernment  will  ensure  that  two  pilot  cases  of  maintenance  of  the  completed  sections  of  the \nDushanbe\u2013Kulyab  road  improved  under  the  Road  Rehabilitation  Project  (footnote  13)  are \ncarried out. It will use a competitive tendering process that is open to public and private entities \nin Tajikistan. This will be the country\u2019s first competitive tendering for road maintenance. \n \n24. \nVehicle  Weighing.  While  Tajikistan  has  legislation  and  national  standards  for \noverloaded  vehicles,  these  are  not  enforced  because  of  lack  of  equipment  (para.  12).  The \ninternational traffic on the project road could include a substantial number of overloaded trucks if \n\n                                                 \n16 Routine maintenance includes cleaning culverts, sealing cracks, filling potholes, and removing debris and snow.  \n\n\f 8 \n\na  vehicle  weighing  system  is  not  implemented.  The  overloaded  trucks  could  damage  other \nrecently rehabilitated roads, as well as the project road. As part of the Project, MOT will procure \nvehicle weighing systems, install them, and make them fully operational on the project road and \nthe roads rehabilitated under the two ongoing ADB-financed road projects.  \n \n\n2. \n\nMOT Institutional Development \n\n \n25. \nADB  has  been  instrumental  in  the  institutional  development  of  the  transport  sector, \nincluding  the  establishment  of  MOT.  MOT  continues  to  reform  its  institutional  structure  to \nimprove its ability to manage the transport sector. In accordance with the recommendations of \nan ADB TA for Institutional and Policy Support to the Road Sector, attached to the loan for the \nRoad Rehabilitation Project (footnote 13), MOT established the Road Planning and Assessment \nUnit  and  the  Economic  Policy  Division.  The  unit  is  responsible  for  assessing  the  needs  for \nmaintenance,  rehabilitation,  and  construction  within  the  road  network,  and  for  planning  road \nwork  within  MOT  resources.  The  division  is  responsible  for  internal  economic  and  financial \nanalysis,  including  auditing  functions.  Under  the  Project,  MOT  will  ensure  that  the  unit  and \ndivision are made fully operational. MOT will address institutional development by reaching an \nagreement  with  the  Tajikistan  Transport  Institute  on  implementing  training  programs  for  MOT \nstaff. \n \n\n3. \n\nRoad Safety \n\n \n26. \nThe Government has made substantial efforts in recent years to improve road safety and \nhas  had  some  success  (para  11).  However,  there  is  still  much  room  for  improvement.  MOT \nrecognizes  the  growing  seriousness  of  the  road  safety  problem  and  the  importance  of  taking \nproactive  steps  to  reduce  the  number  of  deaths  and  injuries.  MOT  has  agreed  to  improve \ncoordination among key agencies with road safety responsibilities, and to strengthen its TSSU \nto monitor and improve road safety. MOT agreed to extend an existing road safety audit (RSA) \nprogram  into  the  planning  and  design  stages  of  all  major  road  schemes  as  soon  as  practical. \nSuch  audits  are  currently  undertaken  only  during  construction  and  operation.  MOT  agreed  to \ninclude  an  RSA  in  the  detailed  design  and  subsequent  stages  of  the  Project,  and  to  include \nsuch specialist services in the contract of the design and supervision consultants. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n27. \nThe  project  impact  will  be  increased  regional  trade  and  increased  economic  growth  in \nthe immediate project area. The project outcome will be improved and sustainable regional and \nnational road networks. The region served by the road network encompassing the project road \nstretches from Kazakhstan to Afghanistan, with links to the Russian Federation to the north, the \nPRC to the east, and Pakistan and Iran to the south. The immediate project area encompassing \nthe  road  sections  to  be  rehabilitated  is  in  the  Rasht  Valley  northeast  of  Dushanbe,  the  site  of \nheavy fighting during the 1990s. Before independence, the project area was a major producer of \nfruit, which was marketed throughout the FSU. \n \nB. \n \nThe project outputs include (i) improvement of 89 km of the central and border sections \n28. \nof the Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz border road and 60 km of rural roads; (ii) improved sustainability of the \nroad  network  through  increased  financing  of  road  maintenance,  procurement  of  road \n\nOutputs \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nmaintenance  equipment,  installation  of  vehicle  weighing  systems,  and  implementation  of  pilot \ncases of tendering road maintenance; (iii) strengthened institutional capacity of MOT by making \nits  Road  Planning  and  Assessment  Unit  and  Economic  Policy  Division  fully  operational,  and \nreaching  an  agreement  with  the  Tajikistan  Transport  Institute  on  a  training  program  for  MOT \nstaff; (iv) improved governance in MOT through institutional strengthening of MOT\u2019s Accounting \nDepartment  and  internal  auditing  function,  and  provision  of  computers;  and  (v)  improved  road \nsafety through strengthening of the TSSU. The primary inputs include (i) implementation of civil \nworks; (ii) consulting services for project supervision, mitigation of impact related to HIV/AIDS17 \nand  sexually  transmitted  infections  (STI),  and  strengthening  MOT\u2019s  accounting  and  auditing \nfunctions;  and  (iii)  procurement  of  equipment  for  road  maintenance  and  vehicle  weighing, \ncomputers  to  strengthen  financial  management  in  MOT,  and  supplies  for  the  HIV/AIDS  and \nmigration component.  \n \n29. \nThe two sections of the Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz border road to be improved are located in the \ncenter  and  at  the  border.  Both  sections  are  two-lane  roads,  although  reduced  to  one  lane  at \nsome points. The central section covers 77 km (km 140\u2013217), and continues from the end of the \nsection that is being improved under phase I. The road passes along riverbanks throughout this \nsection,  which  has  some  severe  geological  conditions.  Originally  sealed  with  bituminous \nsurfacing for its entire length, the road has varied conditions. Some sections have only surface \ndeterioration, while others are no longer paved. In some areas, the road is barely a track. The \ncivil works on km 140\u2013150 will consist of minor pavement repairs and drainage improvements. \nThe  civil  works  on  km  150\u2013200  will  vary  and  include  pavement  overlay  or  reconstruction; \nreinforcement of embankment; slope rehabilitation and protection measures; and installation of \ndrainage systems, safety facilities, and measures to prevent major rock falls and landslides. The \nexisting  800-meter  (m)  section  through  Garm  will  be  improved,  including  straightening  the \nalignment on about 150 m to improve road safety. The civil works on km 200\u2013217 will include \npavement,  drainage,  structural,  and  road-safety  improvements,  but  no  major  earthworks.  The \nProject  will replace  about  11  seriously  deteriorated  bridges,  repair  one  bridge,  and build  three \nnew ones. All the civil works have been designed to comply with the highway design standards \ndeveloped  under  ADB\u2019s  TA  on  road design  standards  in the  CARs.18  The  Project  will  improve \nthe  severely  deteriorating  12-km  section  of  the  road  adjacent  to  the  border.  It  is  closed \nthroughout the winter and periodically during the rest of the year. A major landslide in the middle \nof  this  section  requires  frequent  maintenance.  The  works  on  this  section  include  measures  to \nmitigate  the  landslide  and  construct  a  gravel  surface.  The  Project  will  improve  60  km  of  rural \nroads which are being selected based on socioeconomic criteria and conditions (para. 36). \n \nRoad maintenance equipment will be procured under the Project and used to maintain \n30. \nthe improved central and border sections of the project road. The equipment will allow MOT to \nkeep the road open continuously. The Project addresses the issue of the financial resources for \nroad maintenance (para. 22). Static vehicle weighing systems will be procured for use on roads \nbeing rehabilitated under ongoing ADB-financed projects, including the Dushanbe\u2013Kulyab road \nand the first phase of the Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz border road. A TA attached to the first phase loan \n(footnote 2) will help MOT establish policies and regulations to ensure the effective operation of \nthe vehicle weighing systems.  \n \n31. \nthe  Government\u2019s \nanticorruption  efforts,  the  Project  includes  a  component  for  the  institutional  strengthening  of \nMOT\u2019s Accounting Department and internal auditing function. This component will (i) develop a \n\nin  MOT  and  support \n\nfinancial  management \n\nTo  strengthen \n\n                                                 \n17 Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n18  ADB. 1997.

In addition, computers will be procured to ensure \nmore efficient accounting operations in MOT\u2019s headquarters and regional offices. \n \nC. \n \n32. \nTajikistan  is  at  an  early  stage  of  an  HIV/AIDS  epidemic.  The  number  of  officially \nregistered  HIV  cases  remains  low,  with  385  cases  as  of  May  2005,  but  the  data  may  not  be \naccurate.  Diagnostic  capacity  is  low,  and  some  estimates  consider  the  real  number  of  HIV \ninfections to be 10\u201320 times higher. The rapid rise in cross-border seasonal migration (involving \n10% of the population) to the Russian Federation, the high percentage of households headed \nby  females  (including  war  widows),  conservative  religious  beliefs  and  associated  gender \npractices,  limited  knowledge  of  contraception  and  use  of  condoms,  and  increasing  drug \ntrafficking  and  consumption  patterns,  all  result  in  women\u2019s  vulnerability  to  HIV/AIDS  infection. \nThe  increased  connectivity  and  mobility  during  construction  and  after  project  completion  may \nincrease local communities' exposure to HIV/AIDS and other STI. \n \n33. \nThe Project includes an HIV/AIDS and migration component, to be implemented by the \nMinistry  of  Health\u2019s  National  HIV/AIDS  Center,  to  develop  an  integrated,  community-based, \ngender-responsive approach to HIV/AIDS and STI prevention in the contractor\u2019s campsites and \nin  the  corridor  of  influence.  Subcomponents  will  include  (i)  capacity  development  for  local \ngovernment  agencies  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  providing \nto \nimplement  the  Government\u2019s  policies,  strategies,  and  regulations  in  HIV  and  other  STI \nprevention,  anti-trafficking  measures,  and  regulation  of  migration;  (ii)  behavior  change  and \ncommunication for local communities and high-risk groups, to reduce the level of risk along the \nroad  corridor  and  encourage  safe  sexual  practices  among  seasonal  migrants,  women, \nintravenous drug users, sex workers, and transport and construction operators; and (iii) clinical \nsupport, by providing HIV testing kits and STI treatment packages to health clinics, to help them \nmeet  incremental  needs  of  mobile  populations  and  local  communities.  Monitoring  and \nevaluation  of  the  grant\u2019s  effectiveness  will  be  integrated  into  the  overall  project  performance \nmonitoring. The component will have separate progress reports. The critical financial needs for \nthe rehabilitation of the transport network, limited access to external financing, and lack of any \nsignificant community-based HIV/AIDS prevention program in the project area (other than HIV \ntesting  and  surveillance)  justify  the  use  of  Asian  Development  Fund  IX  grant  resources.  The \ngrant  aims  to  support  a  selective  and  focused  range  of  activities,  and  creates  an  ideal \nopportunity for close ADB collaboration with a wider range of stakeholders and beneficiaries in \nareas  that  would  not  be  feasible  for  loan  financing.  The  component  has  been  designed  in \nconsultation with the Government, UNAIDS,19 and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis \nand  Malaria  to  ensure  consistency  with  the  Government\u2019s  priority  directions  on  HIV/AIDS \nprevention. A detailed description of the component is in Appendix 4. \n \n\ntraining \n\n                                                 \n19 Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. \n\n\f \n\nD. \n \n\nSpecial Features \n\n11\n\n1. \n\nImproving Road Maintenance \n\n \n34.  With  the  assistance  of  ADB-financed  projects  and  the  associated  policy  dialogue,  the \nGovernment  has  made  substantial  progress  in  improving  road  maintenance,  particularly \nfinancing. As required by the loan covenants, financing has been increasing substantially (para. \n22).  Under  ADB  TA,  a  road  maintenance  manual  for  national  roads  was  prepared, \nrecommendations for strengthening MOT\u2019s capacity to plan road maintenance were developed, \nand  training  in  road  subsector  planning  was  provided.  Procurement  of  road  maintenance \nequipment  under  ongoing  ADB-financed  projects  is  improving  road  maintenance  by  replacing \nold equipment that is beyond its operating life and has become expensive to operate. However, \ngiven  the  size  of  the  road  network,  the  difficult  mountainous  terrain,  and  continued  budget \nconstraints relative to the demand, further work is needed to improve road maintenance.  \n \n35. \nADB continues to address this issue through loan covenants and components under the \nProject, which will ensure that the trend of increased financing continues, and that maintenance \nequipment and vehicle weighing systems are procured to prevent the excessive deterioration of \nthe roads. The issue is also addressed through TA to ensure that the funds are used efficiently. \nImplementation of the TA for Strengthening Implementation of Road Maintenance, attached to \nthe  loan  for  the  first  phase  (footnote  2),  is  scheduled  to  begin  shortly.  This  TA  will  help  the \nGovernment  develop  a  new  strategy  to  maintain  the  road  network  along  with  short-  and \nmedium-term programs to implement the strategy. The new strategy and programs will focus on \noptimizing  the  use  of  the  funds  available  for  maintenance, for  example,  by  re-categorizing  the \nnetwork. The TA will develop a manual for the maintenance of secondary roads and will provide \ntraining  in  road  maintenance  management  and  practices.  ADB  is  also  providing  assistance  to \ndevelop new means of maintaining roads, which will reduce dependency on the national budget. \nThe  Tajikistan  Community-Based  Rural  Roads  Maintenance  Project,  financed  by  the  Japan \nFund \nimplement  community-based \nmaintenance  practices  for  local  roads  to  ensure  that  maintenance  is  done  with  the  necessary \nfrequency, and to enable local communities to carry out the maintenance without relying on the \nnational budget (para. 36). \n \n\nfor  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR),20  will  develop  and \n\n2. \n\nRural Roads \n\n \n36. \nThe  Project  will  improve  60  km  of  rural  roads  in  the  project  area.  Rural  roads  to  be \nimproved  are  being  selected  in  a  consultative  process  that  has  included  MOT,  ADB,  and  the \nproject  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  consultants.  The  process  began  with  lists  of \npotential roads to be improved arising from discussions with local jamoat (community) leaders \nand  rayon  (district)  officials.  The  consultants  had  extensive  discussions  with  rayon  leaders \nabout the condition of the rural roads and the potential socioeconomic impacts from improving \nthem,  and  the  roads  are  being  prioritized  based  on  these  factors.  The  condition  of  the  rural \nroads varies, and the works will include grading and profiling of gravel roads; and repairing of \npotholes,  patching,  and,  where  justified,  resurfacing  or  surface  dressing  of  asphalt  roads.  The \nTajikistan Community-Based Rural Roads Maintenance Project will finance maintenance of an \nadditional  330  km  of  low-traffic  local  roads  in  the  phase  I  and  phase  II  project  areas  and  will \ndevelop a system for sustainable maintenance for low-traffic local roads. The project will focus \non lower-category roads that feed into the rural roads and main roads being rehabilitated under \nphases I and II. \n\n                                                 \n20  On 18 October 2005, the President recommended this project for Board approval on 4 November 2005. \n\n\f 12 \n\n3. \n\nStakeholder Consultations \n\n \n37. \nDuring  the  feasibility  study,  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA),  and  resettlement \nplanning,  consultations  were  carried  out  with  government  agencies,  international  and  local \nNGOs,  villagers  and  other  stakeholders  likely  to  be  affected  by  the  Project,  and  local  groups \n(Appendix 5). Environmental concerns, land acquisition and resettlement issues, and economic \ndevelopment  potential  were  discussed.  Village  investigations  and  surveys  were  conducted  in \nthe project area to assess the potential benefits and adverse impacts of the Project. Over 2,300 \npeople  were  interviewed  in  the  public  opinion  surveys,  social  assessment,  environmental \nassessment,  and  resettlement  planning.  For  the  short  resettlement  plan  (SRP)  (para.  62), \nconsultation  meetings  were  held  with  the  affected  townships  and  villages.  The  Project  is  well-\nknown  among  the  rural  people,  and  public  support  for  it  is  high.  Local  officials  explained  the \npolicies  and  regulations  for  compensation  for  potential  land  acquisition  and  demolition  of \nstructures  to  those  who  may  be  adversely  affected.  These  concerns  were  considered  in  (i) \ndetermining  the  alignment  to  reduce  adverse  social,  resettlement,  and  environmental  impacts; \n(ii) designing pedestrian access; and (iii) completing a detailed SRP. The consultation process \nwas  expanded  to  finalize  the  design  and  formulate  compensation  standards  and  rehabilitation \nmeasures  for  people  affected  by  the  demolition  of  structures  in  the  right-of-way.  Villagers \nparticipated  in  the  discussions  and  decisions  on  potential  land  acquisition  and  demolition  of \nstructures in the right-of-way. \n \n\n4. \n\nRoad Safety \n\n \n38. \nImprovement  of  road  safety  is  a  key  area  of  the  policy  dialogue  conducted  under  the \nProject  (para.  26).  Strengthening  MOT\u2019s  TSSU  will  result  in  substantial  improvements  in  road \nsafety  nationwide.  The  rehabilitation  works  will  substantially  improve  project  road  safety  by \nimproving the road surface (where extensive deterioration results in unsafe driving conditions), \nand  replacing  deteriorating  and  narrow  bridges.  The  installation  and  maintenance  of  proper \nsignage and lane markings to highlight changes in alignment and other safety hazards will  be \nemphasized. The Project also includes several other measures to improve road safety. Where \nthe  road  passes  through  settlements,  road  safety  measures  such  as  speed  limits,  speed \nreduction measures, pedestrian crossings, walkways, railings, and lighting will be provided. The \nsupervision consultants will prepare an inventory of slopes subject to rock falls and landslides, \nand draw up slope mitigation measures to be included in the Project\u2019s civil works. Equipment to \nimprove  road  safety  during  the  winter,  e.g.,  through  removal  of  snow,  will  be  procured.  The \nsupervision  consultants  will  examine  the  possibility  of  establishing  rest  areas.  Consulting \nservices  include  an  international  road  safety  expert,  who  will  review  the  detailed  design  and \ndrawings for compliance with road safety requirements, conduct a road safety audit, and advise \nMOT on enforcement measures to improve road safety.  \n \nE. \n \n39. \nThe project costs are estimated at $39.5 million, with a foreign exchange cost of $26.5 \nmillion and a local currency cost of $13.0 million, as shown in Table 1.

The  proposed  loan  and  grant  will  finance  $26.5  million  (100%)  of  the  foreign \nexchange cost and $3.5 million equivalent (26.9%) of the local currency cost, or 75.9% of the total \nproject cost. The proposed ADB loan will have a term of 32 years including a grace period of 8 \nyears, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum  thereafter.  The  Government  will  provide  counterpart  financing  of  $9.5  million,  including \n$5.3 million for value-added tax. Government financing of the value-added tax may take the form \nof a tax exemption or payment. Loan proceeds will not be used to finance taxes. The project loan \nis included in the Government\u2019s Public Investment Program.

MOT,  the  Executing  Agency  (EA),  will  maintain  a  PIU  which  will  (i)  monitor  day-to-day \nproject  implementation,  (ii)  prepare  withdrawal  applications,  (iii)  prepare  project  progress \nreports, and (iv) maintain project accounts and complete loan financial records for auditing the \nProject. The head of the PIU, who must be acceptable to ADB and have adequate experience in \nproject  management,  will  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  supervision  of  implementation \nactivities. The PIU head will be supported by professional and clerical staff with expertise and \nexperience  in  financial  accounting,  road  engineering,  construction  supervision,  contract \nadministration,  and  monitoring  of  environmental,  social,  and  resettlement  issues.  The  PIU  for \nthe ongoing ADB-financed road rehabilitation projects will be responsible for implementing the \nproposed Project as well. The PIU will have 16 staff, including the PIU head, to implement the \nproposed  Project  and  the  ongoing  Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz  Border  Road  Rehabilitation  Project \n(Phase  I)  (footnote  2).  Two  staff  members  will  be  added  to  the  current  level  of  14,  who  are \nimplementing two projects. The additional staff members will be appointed to the PIU before the \nawarding of the civil works contracts. They will implement the Project together with the existing \nPIU staff. One of the additional PIU staff members will be designated to monitor environmental, \nsocial,  and  resettlement  issues.  ADB  has  been  working  closely  with  MOT  and  the  PIU  for \nseveral years on other road rehabilitation projects. ADB believes that MOT and the PIU have, \nwith  consultant  support,  the  financial  management  capacity  to  manage  the  Project  effectively. \nThe Ministry of Health\u2019s National HIV/AIDS Center will be the EA responsible for implementing \nthe component on HIV/AIDS and migration. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n42. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  in  30  months,  from  January  2007  to  June  2009.  This \nincludes mobilization but not the defects liability period, during which the contractor is responsible \nfor  maintenance.  The  civil  works,  including  mobilization,  for  the  project  road  are  scheduled  to \nbegin in March 2007 and to be completed by May 2009. The detailed engineering design will be \nundertaken separately, and will not be financed under the Project. Prequalification, tendering, and \nevaluation  for  the  Project  will  be  undertaken  immediately  following  completion  of  the  detailed \ndesign, and will not be financed under the Project. The proposed implementation schedule is in \nAppendix 7. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n43. \nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Contracts  valued  in  excess  of  $0.5  million  for  goods  and \n$1.0  million  for  civil  works  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB) \namong  prequalified  bidders.  Supply  contracts  for  the  equipment  and  supplies  have  been \npackaged  into  four  contracts,  one  of  which  will  be  financed  following  ICB  procedures.  Two \nsupply contracts not exceeding $500,000 will be procured through international shopping. One \ncontract for equipment and supplies for the HIV/AIDS and migration component, not exceeding \n$100,000, will be procured through direct purchase or international shopping. Civil works have \nbeen  packaged  into  five  contracts.  One  will  be  financed  following  ICB  procedures.  The  other \nfour will be financed following local competitive bidding procedures. Tentative contract packages \nare listed in Appendix 8. \n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n44. \nInternational  consulting  services  for  46  person-months  will  be  provided  by  a  firm,  for \nconstruction supervision, project impact monitoring and evaluation, implementation of measures \nto improve road safety, and project management. The international consultants will provide on-\nthe-job  training  for  the  counterpart  staff  and  domestic  consultants.  In  association  with  the \ninternational  consultants,  400  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  will  be  provided \nfor construction supervision, contract management, and other technical advisory assistance, as \nwell  as  for  helping  the  international  consultants  monitor  the  social  and  poverty  impact  of  the \nProject  through  household  surveys  and  data  analysis.  Draft  terms  of  reference  for  the  project \nsupervision  consulting  services  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C.  Consulting  services  for  13 \ninternational person-months and 185 domestic person-months will be required to implement the \nHIV/AIDS and migration component. Consulting services for 6 international person-months will \nbe  required  to  provide  training  for  MOT\u2019s  accounting  department  and  auditing  function. \nConsulting  services  will  also  be  required  for  project  auditing.  For  all  consulting  services, \nconsultants  will  be  recruited  through  an  international  firm  in  association  with  domestic  firms \nthrough quality- and cost-based selection, in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory \nfor  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  Full  technical  proposals  will  be  required  for  the \nproject  supervision  and  monitoring  services,  and  simplified  technical  proposals  for  the  other \nconsulting services. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \nAll loan disbursements will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \n45. \nHandbook  (2001).  The  disbursement  procedures  will  include  (i)  imprest  account,  (ii)  direct \npayment,  (iii)  commitment,  or  (iv)  reimbursement.  The  Government  has  requested  that  an \nimprest  account  be  established,  after  loan  effectiveness,  at  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to \nADB to expedite disbursement of the loan proceeds. The initial advance of the imprest account \nwill  be  up  to  $500,000.  It  will  be  established  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (2001)  and  other  procedures  to  be  agreed  on  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  The \nGovernment  may  withdraw  funds  from  the  imprest  account  to  finance  PIU  expenditures; \ntraining,  seminars,  and  studies;  procurement  of  locally  available  materials  in  an  amount  not \nexceeding  $50,000  equivalent  per  contract;  and  civil  works  contracts  awarded  under  local \ncompetitive bidding with a value not exceeding the equivalent of $50,000. ADB\u2019s statement of \nexpenditure  procedures  will  be  used  to  reimburse  expenditures  and  liquidate  the  imprest \naccount for payment not exceeding $50,000 equivalent per payment. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n46.  MOT,  together  with  the  PIU,  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  and  annual \nprogress reports on project implementation, the form and content of which will be agreed with \nADB. MOT will maintain separate accounts for all project components financed by ADB and the \nGovernment.  MOT  will  have  them  audited  by  an  independent  auditor  that  has  adequate \nknowledge of and experience with international accounting practices, and is acceptable to ADB. \nThe audit will also cover the imprest account and statement of expenditure, and the final audit \nreport  will  include  separate  audit  opinion  on  these.  The  audited  project  accounts  and  the \nauditor\u2019s  reports  will  be  provided  to  ADB  within  6  months  after  the  end  of  each  financial  year. \nThe Government has been informed of ADB\u2019s requirement for the timely submission of audited \nproject accounts and financial statements, including the suspension of disbursements in case of \n\n\f 16 \n\nnoncompliance. To facilitate evaluation of the Project, the Government has agreed to provide a \nproject completion report to ADB within 3 months of physical completion of the Project. \n \n\n7. \n\nAnticorruption Measures \n\n \n47. \nThe  Government  is  making  a  significant  effort  to  reduce  corruption.  The  principal \nanticorruption measures are outlined in the New Anticorruption Law, which was approved by the \nParliament  in  June  2005.  The  law  defines  the  legal  and  organizational  basis  to  prevent \ncorruption.  In  April  2005,  the  President  assigned  responsibility  to  the  relevant  Government \nagencies  to  improve  accountability  and  reporting  within  their  ministries.  The  President\u2019s  office \nhas  also  issued  a  decree  requiring  all  parts  of  the  Government  to  convert  to  international \naccounting  standards.21  MOT  is  undertaking  measures  to  implement  the  Government\u2019s \nanticorruption  program.  In  January  2005,  it  established  the  Economic  Policy  Division  with \nresponsibilities for internal auditing. The Project will strengthen MOT\u2019s anticorruption efforts by \ntraining MOT\u2019s Accounting Department and by strengthening MOT\u2019s Economic Policy Division, \nwhich has responsibility for internal audits. ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy22 was explained to, and \ndiscussed with, the Government and EA. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any alleged corruption, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy are included in the \nLoan Regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project. The Government is committed to creating \nand  sustaining  a  corruption-free  environment,  and  has  agreed  to  abide  by  the  relevant \nprovisions  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  in  preparing  all  documents  and  contracts  during  the \nbidding process and project implementation. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n48. \nADB  and  MOT  agreed  on  a  preliminary  set  of  indicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluating \nproject  performance  in  relation  to  its  goals  and  purposes,  with  an  emphasis  on  poverty \nreduction.  Representative  indicators  are  included  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework.  At \nthe  beginning  of  project  implementation,  MOT  will  confirm  baseline  values  for  social, \nenvironmental, and poverty reduction impact indicators. Monitoring indicators will be measured, \nwith the necessary frequency, during project implementation. Comments and findings regarding \nthese project indicators will be incorporated in every other quarterly report to ADB. In addition to \nindicators  for  implementation  monitoring,  indicators  for  project  evaluation  will  be  measured  at \nproject completion, 1 year later, and 3 years after completion. Where relevant, indicators will be \ndisaggregated  by  gender.  Participatory  surveys  will  take  place,  and  results  will  be  compared \nwith  the  baseline.  A  final  report  will  evaluate  changes  in  the  preceding  3  years.  MOT  has \ndeveloped its monitoring capability for the ongoing projects, and has the capacity to monitor the \nProject as well. An international consultant will be recruited to help establish the monitoring and \nevaluation  system  and  to  monitor  and  evaluate  all  relevant  socioeconomic  and  environmental \nimpacts of the Project. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n21 The decree did not indicate the specific international accounting standards to be adopted. \n22 ADB. 1998. Anticorruption. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n17\n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n49. \nADB  and  the  Government  will  carry  out  a  midterm  review  of  project  implementation  in \n2008.  The  review  will  focus  on  project  impacts,  particularly  those  relating  to  institutional, \nadministrative,  organizational,  technical,  environmental,  and  social  aspects  and  poverty \nreduction.  The  Project\u2019s  economic  viability,  and  other  aspects  that  may  have  an  impact  on \nproject performance, will be assessed. The review will examine the implementation progress of \npolicy reforms and compliance with assurances specified in the Loan Agreement. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\n \nA. \n \n50. \nTraffic  forecasts  by  vehicle  type  were  prepared  for  the  project  road  sections  for  2006\u2013\n2029 (Appendix 9). The forecasts are based on expected growth in GDP, income elasticities of \ndemand, and analysis of regional trade patterns. Total traffic is forecast to grow at annual rates \nof  11.5\u201315.8%  during  2006\u20132015  (the  years  during  and  immediately  following  project \nimplementation), except for the border section, which has higher growth. The high growth rates \nduring these years are due in large part to the high growth of international traffic and completion \nof the Project and the preceding first phase. Total traffic is forecast to grow at annual rates of \nabout 6.0% during 2016\u20132029. Average annual growth rates for normal and domestic generated \ntraffic  are  estimated  at  6.9\u20137.2%  during  2006\u20132010,  6.0\u20136.5%  during  2011\u20132015,  and  5.9\u2013\n6.2%  from  2016  onwards.  Domestic  generated  traffic  arises  from  increased  passenger  traffic \nand  transport  of  produce  to  Dushanbe.  The  improved  road  condition  lowers  vehicle  operating \ncosts (VOCs) and generates demand through lower fares. It causes less damage to fruit during \nshipment, thereby increasing the demand for production and transport from the project area to \nDushanbe.   \n \nInternational  generated  traffic  is  forecast  based  on  an  analysis  of  trade  patterns  in  the \n51. \nregion  and  potential  trade  from  improved  access  to  ports  in  Pakistan.  Three  pairs  of  trading \npartners  were  examined:  Tajikistan-the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan-the  PRC,  and  the  PRC-\nAfghanistan. Improvement of the regional road network, where project road sections constitute a \nmajor bottleneck, will provide a much more direct and efficient transport route for trade among \nthese  country  pairs.  The  PRC\u2019s  share  of  Tajikistan\u2019s  total  trade  is  estimated  to  increase  from \n1.9% now to 20.0% by 2014, still lower than the PRC\u2019s 23.0% share of the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s \ntrade.  Similarly,  the  PRC\u2019s  share  of  Afghanistan\u2019s  total  trade  is  estimated  to  increase  from \n0.04% now to 10.00% by 2014. International generated traffic is forecast to increase by 43.1% \nduring  2011\u20132015,  and  by  5.9%  from  2016  onwards.  The  high  growth  rate  during  2011\u20132015 \nwill  be  due to  the  increase  in  PRC\u2019s  share  of  total  trade  for  Tajikistan and  Afghanistan,  which \nwill  reach  levels  similar  to  those  of  other  countries  in  the  region.  Normal  traffic  is  expected  to \naccount  for  46\u201352%  of  total  traffic  on  the  project  road  in  2029,  except  for  the  border  section, \nwhere  it  comprises  only  6%.  Domestic  generated  traffic  resulting  from  lower  transport  costs \narising  from  the  Project  accounts  for  2%  or  less  on  the  four  road  sections.  International \ngenerated  traffic  comprises  34%\u201353%  of  total  traffic  in  2029,  except  for  the  border  section, \nwhere it comprises 94%. \n \nB. \n \nThe  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  for  the  Project  by  comparing  the  with-  and \n52. \nwithout-project scenarios (Appendix 10). In the without-project scenario, the road is assumed to \nreceive  only  minimal  maintenance  and  will  continue  to  deteriorate.  The  with-project  scenario \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n\f 18 \n\ninclude \n\nProject  economic  costs \n\nthe  resource  costs  of  road \n\nincludes  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  according  to  international  standards.  The  PPTA \nconsidered  various  mutually  exclusive  project  alternatives,  and  the  proposed  Project  is  based \non the most cost-effective and least-cost option. \n \nimprovement  and \n53. \nmaintenance (including rural roads), equipment, and consulting services. The primary economic \nbenefits for the Project are VOC savings for normal traffic, domestic and international generated \ntraffic,  and  benefits  arising  from  improvement  of  the  rural  roads.  Economic  benefits  were \ncalculated using the same methodology used for costs. VOC savings will accrue primarily from \nimprovements  in  the  road  surface,  horizontal  and  vertical  alignment,  and  increased  average \nspeed on some sections. VOC savings for normal traffic account for about 58% of total benefits, \nand benefits from international generated traffic account for about 37%. Benefits for generated \ntraffic  are  estimated  at  half  the  value  of  VOC  savings  for  normal  traffic.  Domestic  generated \ntraffic  is  defined  as  new  traffic  resulting  from  reduced  transport  costs  arising  from  the  Project. \nInternational  generated  traffic  comprises  new  international  traffic  arising  from  increased  trade \namong  Tajikistan,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  the  PRC  and  from  improved  access  to  ports \nresulting  from  improvement  of  the  project  road.  The  Project  will  have  other  benefits,  such  as \nimproved  access  to  social  services  and  improved  road  safety.  However,  these  have  not  been \nquantified because data is insufficient. \n \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated for the Project, including the \n54. \nrural  roads  and  all  other  components.  The  EIRR  for  the  overall  Project  is  15.4%,  and  the  net \npresent  value  is  $9.8  million,  using  a  12%  discount  rate.  The  EIRR  including  only  benefits \naccruing to Tajikistan is 11.9%. In addition to the direct benefits that have been quantified in the \neconomic analysis, the Project will yield substantial other benefits for Tajikistan. The immediate \nproject  area  was  the  scene  of  heavy  fighting  during  the  civil  conflict  in  the  1990s,  and  the \nGovernment places a high priority on integrating this region\u2014economically and politically\u2014with \nthe  rest  of  the  country,  which  requires  improvement  of  the  project  road.  The  substantial \neconomic benefits arising from increased trade (para. 7) will have a major impact on Tajikistan. \nThe improved road will lead to decreased prices for imported consumer goods, as goods from \nthe  region  replace  those  currently  imported  from  the  Russian  Federation,  which  will  result  in \nsubstantial consumer surplus benefits for the population. Likewise, reduced prices for imported \ninputs will make exports such as agricultural and light industrial products more competitive and \nlead to increased production. These products require labor-intensive production and will lead to \nincreased  employment.  Sensitivity  analysis  was  carried  out  to  test  the  effects  of  negative \nchanges  in  the  key  parameters  that  determine  the  project  benefits  and  costs.  The  sensitivity \nanalysis  indicates  that  either  capital  costs  would  have  to  increase  by  44%,  or  total  benefits \ndecrease by 29% for the EIRR to decrease to 12%. International generated traffic would have to \ndecrease by 80% for the EIRR to drop to 12%. Given ADB\u2019s experience with similar projects in \nTajikistan and other CARs, such changes are not expected. \n \n55. \nA distribution analysis found that Tajikistan would receive 76% of net benefits: the PRC, \n12%; the Kyrgyz Republic, 6%; Afghanistan, 5%; and other countries, 1%. Tajikistan\u2019s share of \ntotal net benefits attributable to regional benefits would be 6%. Tajikistan would receive regional \nbenefits  from  lower  prices  for  imports,  sourced  from  the  PRC  via  the  project  road,  and  from \nincreased exports to the PRC and other countries to the north. The PRC would receive regional \nbenefits  largely  from  increased  exports  to  Tajikistan  and  Afghanistan.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic \nwould  receive  regional  benefits  from  increased  trade  with  Tajikistan  and  to  a  lesser  extent \nAfghanistan, as well as from increased trade arising from improved access to ports in Pakistan. \nThe Kyrgyz Republic would also benefit from border-crossing fees for international traffic at the \nPRC\u2013Kyrgyz Republic border at Irkeshtam and from small-scale businesses providing services, \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nEnvironmental Impact \n\ne.g.,  food  and  vehicle  repair,  for  transit  traffic.  Afghanistan\u2019s  share  of  regional  benefits  would \narise  primarily  from  lower  prices  for  imports  from  the  PRC  and  from  increased  exports  to \ncountries  to  the  north.  Kazakhstan  and  other  countries  in  the  region  would  benefit  from \nimproved access to ports in Pakistan; the reduced transport costs of reaching these ocean ports \nwould facilitate increased trade. In the longer term, the Project would likely facilitate the Kyrgyz \nRepublic\u2019s and Tajikistan\u2019s trade with India. A conservative approach was used in the estimates \nof  the  regional  benefits,  which  are  based  on  estimates  of  increased  trade  of  three  pairs  of \nregional  trading  partners  and  on  the  increased  trade  arising  from  improved  access  to  ports  in \nPakistan provided by the project road. The project benefits accruing to Tajikistan are distributed \namong five  national groups: (i) users of freight transport, (ii) users of passenger transport, (iii) \nvehicle  owners,  (iv)  labor,  and  (v)  the  Government  and/or  economy  of  Tajikistan.  Users  of \npassenger and freight transport, and the Government and/or economy each receive about 22\u2013\n23%  of  total  benefits.  Because  the  market  for  transport  services  in  the  project  area  is  highly \ncompetitive, vehicle owners only retain about 5% of net benefits.  \n \n56. \nA financial analysis examined the project impact on the financial status of MOT and the \nGovernment, particularly the financial impact of the maintenance and operational costs that will \narise from the Project. The additional real maintenance costs of $90,000 per year represent less \nthan  2.0%  of  MOT\u2019s  budget  for  road  rehabilitation  and  maintenance.  Based  on  the  analysis \nundertaken, the Project is financially sustainable. \n \nC. \n \n57. \nThe  environmental  classification  of  the  project  is  Category  B.  An  initial  environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  of  the  Project  was  carried  out  under  the  PPTA  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002) and ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). Based on \nthe results of the IEE, the Project will not generate significant environmental impacts provided \nthe mitigation measures outlined in the IEE are implemented appropriately. The summary IEE is \nin Appendix 11. \n \nD. \n \nAs  a  result  of  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet  Union  and  the  civil  war  that  followed,  poverty \n58. \nlevels  in  Tajikistan  became  very  high.  Although  the  country  is  now  recovering,  the \nsocioeconomic  survey  undertaken  for  the  Project  revealed  that  an  estimated  68%  of  the \npopulation  and  62%  of  the  households  in  the  affected  area  have  an  income  per  head  of  less \nthan TJS600 per year, which has been identified as a suitable poverty benchmark. Even people \nwith  regular  employment  and  who  travel  regularly  are  living  in  poverty  because  of  low  wages \nand  large  households.  As  a  result,  the  poor  are  well  represented  among  road  users  and  are \npotential beneficiaries. Unlike in many other countries, a high proportion of the poor own motor \nvehicles\u2014albeit  old  ones  in  use  since  the  FSU.  There  are  no  large  commercial  transport \noperators, but there is a highly competitive market of owner-drivers, as the supply of commercial \ntransport  services  exceeds  demand.  VOC  savings  are  therefore  likely  to  be  passed  on  as \nreduced costs, fares, and charges. The impact on fares will be tracked as part of the monitoring \nand evaluation procedures agreed on for the Project. \n \n59. \nThe project area\u2019s population consists largely of rural people, most of whom are farmers. \nThe Project will reduce poverty by lowering the transport costs for farm produce and for people \ntraveling to agricultural and labor markets, health and education centers, and other social and \npublic services. The poverty assessment shows that the Project will significantly reduce poverty. \nIt will directly benefit about 180,000 people in the 26 districts adjacent to the project road; and \n\nPoverty Reduction Impact \n\n\f 20 \n\nSocial and Gender Impact \n\nroad  users  from  outside  the  immediate  project  area,  who  use  the  project  road  to  access \nDushanbe.  Of  the  domestic  beneficiaries,  an  estimated  120,000  poor  people  will  be  direct \nbeneficiaries. Others will benefit from lower transport costs leading to reduced consumer prices \nand  generated  economic  and  social  development.  The  Project  will  generate  many  skilled  and \nunskilled  jobs  during  implementation.  Unskilled  labor  will  be  employed  directly  in  road \nconstruction, and indirectly in provision of materials and support services. The Project will create \nabout  45,000  person-months  of  unskilled  labor  for  the  rehabilitation  of  the  Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz \nborder road and 5,000 person-months for the rural roads. The summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 12. \n \nE. \n \n60.  Men and women achieved considerable social and economic gains under the FSU, but \ngender  equality  has  been  undermined  since  independence.  Social  relations  have  been \ndisrupted by changes such as the privatization of economic assets, giving rise to new economic \nrelations among families, communities, and the Government. Access to resources required for \nsurvival  was  further  limited  during  the  civil  war,  with  corresponding  influence  on  social  and \ngender  relations.  The  conflicts  between  traditional  values  and  current  economic  needs  are \nmediated within families, but the conflicts between traditional values and gender roles are more \ndifficult to mediate. Women are expected to uphold traditional values while contributing to their \nfamilies\u2019  livelihoods.  Traditional  gender  roles  and  expectations  of  girls  and  women  limit  their \naccess to education, skills, resources such as land and, frequently to knowledge of the outside \nworld.  Pressure  on  men  to  meet  all  their  families\u2019  needs  is  also  strong,  and  this  stress  is \nsometimes  expressed  as  domestic  violence  or  psychological  harassment.  In  the  immediate \nproject  area,  many  more  men  than  women  access  postsecondary  education.  Out  of  the  210 \nsurveyed households, only 2% of the women had attended vocational schools and/or colleges \ncompared with 17% of men. Females reported lower literacy. While men have a wide range of \njob  opportunities,  women  are  predominantly  engaged  in  cropping  (78%)  and  tending  livestock \n(13%).  The  average  income  of  women  was  only  60%  that  of  men.  Many  men  migrate  to  the \nRussian Federation for seasonal employment and repatriate income. These remittances are the \nlargest source of household income in the project area. \n \nThe Project will have indirect and direct benefits for women. Indirect benefits are mostly \n61. \nrelated to enhanced connectivity and include increased access to education and health facilities; \nincreased travel to towns; increased marketability of women\u2019s products (fruits and vegetables); \nincreased  access  to  jobs  (in  local  markets);  and  increased  access  to  information.  Women  will \nbenefit from outside ideas as access to the rest of the country improves. A direct benefit is the \nadoption  of  an  integrated  and  community-based  approach  to  HIV/AIDS  and  migration  (paras. \n32\u201333), targeting local communities and high-risk groups.  \n \nF. \n \n62. \nAll  the  civil  works  activities  will  take  place  either  within  the  existing  right-of-way  or  on \nunused  state-owned  land.  No  relocation  of  households  or  acquisition  of  productive  land  is \nexpected. If the Project needs new borrow pits or quarries, they are expected to be located on \nunused  state-owned  land.  The  Project  will  directly  affect  10  households  at  most  in  Garm  and \nYangolik village. Of the 10 households, 2 are headed by females. The income per capita per year \nof the 10 households is less than TJS500, with 80% of their income coming from agriculture. One \nsmall shop partly located on the right-of-way will be affected, with its entrance moved by 2 meters \nfrom  the  right-of-way.  An  SRP  was  formulated  in  accordance  with  the  laws  and  regulations  of \nTajikistan,  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995).  The  resettlement  strategy, \n\nResettlement Effects \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nRisks \n\ncompensation standards, entitlements, and rehabilitation plans were based on impact surveys and \nconsultations  with  local  officials  and  affected  households.  Considering  that  the  impact  on  towns \nand villages will be minimal and most of the affected persons have larger incomes than average, \nthe  SRP  will  be  implemented  smoothly.  Demolition  of  structures  on  the  right-of-way  will  be \ncompleted  within  2006,  and  compensation  will  be  paid  before  the  civil  works  start.  Special \nattention will be paid to the two female-headed households and the small-shop owner to prevent \ntheir marginalization or impoverishment. A summary of the SRP is in Appendix 13. \n \nG. \n \n63. \nThe  Project  has  been  designed  to  reduce  potential  risks,  which  include  delays  in \nimplementation  because  of  inadequate  implementation  capacity  of  MOT,  failure  to  provide \ncounterpart  financing  on  time,  the  traffic  forecast  not  being  realized,  inadequate  road \nmaintenance,  and  lack  of  security  in  the  project  area.  The  Project  includes  a  number  of \nmeasures  to  mitigate  the  risk  of  delays.  The  existing  PIU  will  implement  the  Project  and  has \nidentified  the  number  and  type  of  additional  staff  members  needed.  Advance  action  has  been \napproved, and the PIU is now familiar with ADB procedures and will be able to make full use of \nthe advance action provisions. The Government has been made aware of ADB\u2019s emphasis on \nthe timely provision of counterpart funds, and has assured the project processing missions that \nit can provide the necessary funds for all ongoing ADB-financed road projects on time. Project \ndisbursements  will  be  within  the  Public  Investment  Program  restrictions  agreed  to  by  the \nGovernment and the International Monetary Fund.  \n \n64. \nThere is some risk that the traffic forecast will not materialize, especially the generated \ntraffic  arising  from  increased  international  trade.  This  risk  has  been  mitigated  by  using \nconservative  assumptions  to  estimate  benefits  from  international  generated  traffic,  as  only  the \nbenefits  from  increased  trade  of  three  pairs  of  regional  trading  partners  and  additional  traffic \narising  from  improved  access  to  ports  has  been  included. There  is  also  a  risk  that  the  project \nroads will not be properly maintained and thus the full benefits of the Project will not be realized. \nThe  Government  is  aware  of  the  importance  of  road  maintenance,  particularly  in  the  project \narea, which is mountainous and prone to landslides and rock falls. The project design includes \nelements  to  address  the  risks  of  inadequate  financing  and  the  implementation  of  road \nmaintenance  for  the  project  roads.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  loan  assurances  requiring \nthe allocation of specific levels of financing for maintaining the project roads, in addition to the \nassurances  regarding  levels  of  financing  for  road  maintenance  nationwide.  The  additional \nmaintenance  costs  amount  to  less  than  2.0%  of  MOT\u2019s  budget  for  road  maintenance  and \nrehabilitation,  and  will  be  sustainable.  The  Project  includes  procurement  of  road  maintenance \nequipment, which will be used solely on the project roads. A sensitivity analysis indicates that \nthe Project remains economically feasible, with an EIRR of 13.2%, even with only 50.0% of the \nrequired  maintenance  provided.  The  project  area  is  part  of  an  area  placed  under  a  United \nNations security restriction following the civil war. However, the security status was upgraded in \nlate 2002, and again in September 2005. It is expected to remain in the upgraded condition.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n65. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  MOT  have  given  the \n\n\f 22 \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n(a) \n\n \n(b) \n\n \n(c) \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nCounterpart Funding. The Government will provide, on a timely basis, all funds \nand  resources  necessary  for  rehabilitation,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  the \nDushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz border road in accordance with the financing plan agreed for \nthe Project. The Government will ensure that MOF takes all necessary measures \nto enable MOT to implement the Project successfully and operate and maintain \nthe  project  road  after  completion.  Before  the  end  of  each  year  the  Government \nwill  demonstrate  availability  of  funds  necessary  for  the  Project  in  a  public \ninvestment program for the succeeding year. \n\nMaintenance Financing \n\nThe  Government  will  allocate  and  make  available  on  a  timely  basis \nsufficient  funds  to  maintain  the  Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz  border  road.  The \nGovernment  will  allocate  at  least  $90,000  per  year  (plus  inflation  since \n2005) to maintain the project road upon completion. The Government will \nalso ensure adequate maintenance of the Project\u2019s rural roads. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  actual  expenditures  on  maintenance \n(including  emergency  maintenance,  but  excluding  rehabilitation  and \nconstruction)  for  roads  under  MOT  jurisdiction  will  be  increased  at  the \nsame rate as increases of the national budget during 2008\u20132009. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  (1)  detailed  actual  road  maintenance \nexpenditures  are  included  in  every  other  quarterly  progress  report  to  be \nsubmitted  by  MOT  to  ADB,  (2)  independent  auditors  audit  such \nexpenditures annually in accordance with appropriate standards, and (3) \nsuch audited reports are submitted to ADB within 9 months of the end of \nthe year. \n\nRoad Maintenance Tenders. The Government will ensure that two pilot cases of \nconducting  maintenance  of  completed  sections  of  the  Dushanbe\u2013Kulyab  road \nrehabilitated under the Road Rehabilitation Project (footnote 13) are carried out \nby  31  December  2007  and  31  December  2008  (in  succession)  using  a \ncompetitive  tendering  process  open  to  public  and  private  sector  entities  in \nTajikistan. \n\nPrior to 31 December 2006, the Government will approve new legislation \nand/or  issue  decrees  regarding  regulations  and  procedures  for  vehicle \nweighing,  in  particular,  specifying  the  maximum  permissible  vehicle  axle \nloads, and requiring offloading of excess weight from vehicles exceeding \nthe specified limits. \n \n\nMOT  will  install  and  make  fully  operational  static  vehicle  weighing \nsystems, according to legislation and national standards, for the sections \nof  the  national  highway  rehabilitated  under  (1)  the  Road  Rehabilitation \nProject (footnote 13) by 30 June 2007; (2) the Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz Border \nRoad  Rehabilitation  Project  (Phase  I)  (footnote  2)  by  the  time  of  the \nhandover of the road by the contractor; and (3) the Project by the time of \nthe handover of the road by the contractor. \n\nVehicle Weighing \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n23\n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n \n(a) \n\n \n(b) \n\n \n\n \n(v) \n \n\n \n\n \n(ix) \n\n \n(x) \n\nMOT Institutional Development \n\nMOT  will  make  (1)  the  Road  Planning  and  Assessment  Unit  under  the \nRoad Department, and (2) the Economic Policy Division, fully operational \nby  31  December  2006,  including  staffing  of  all  authorized  positions  and \nproviding adequate office facilities and sufficient number of computers.  \n\nMOT will reach an agreement with the Tajikistan Transport Institute by 31 \nDecember  2006  on  a  plan  for  implementing  training  programs  for  MOT \nstaff. \n\n(vi) \n\nConstruction  Quality.  MOT  will  (a)  rehabilitate  the  project  road  per  the  design \ntechnical specifications; and (b) perform construction supervision, quality control, \nand contract management in accordance with internationally accepted standards. \n\n(vii)  Road Safety \n\nMOT will ensure adequate safety measures during and after the Project, \nsuch  as  pavement  markings,  warning  signs,  traffic  signs  and  signals, \ncommunications facilities, hazard barriers, and traffic monitoring facilities.  \n\nMOT will strengthen the existing TSSU, through incorporating RSA in the \ndesign  stage  of  all  road  projects,  staffing  all  authorized  positions,  and \nproviding adequate office facilities and sufficient number of computers by \n31 December 2006. \n\n(viii)  Anticorruption  Measures.  Tajikistan  will  (1)  undertake  necessary  measures  to \ncreate  and  sustain  a  corruption-free  environment,  and  (2)  ensure  that  its \nanticorruption  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  are  strictly \nenforced and are being complied with during project implementation. \n\nregulations,  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy \n\nEnvironment.  MOT  will  ensure  that  project  contractors  implement  social  and \nenvironmental impact management in compliance with applicable environmental \nlaws  and \n(2002),  and  per \nrecommendations  of  the  IEE,  and  will  translate  the  environmental  management \nplan  of  the  IEE  into  a  contract-specific  environmental  management  plan.  MOT \nwill  submit  an  annual  report  on  environmental  performance  during  project \nimplementation. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement. MOT will ensure that land acquisition and \nresettlement  are  carried  out  promptly  and  efficiently  following  the  resettlement \nplan  agreed  with  ADB,  in  line  with  applicable  laws  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  (1995).  MOT  will  ensure  that  implementation  of  the \nresettlement plan is monitored and evaluated and reported to ADB as required in \nthe plan. \n\nGender  and  Development.  MOT  will  monitor  the  project  impacts  on  women \nthroughout  implementation,  in  consultation  with  local  governments,  women's \nassociations,  and  NGOs.  MOT  will  (a)  ensure  women's  participation  during  all \nphases  of  project  implementation;  and  (b)  encourage  local  contractors  to  (1) \n\n \n\n(xi) \n\n\f 24 \n\n \nB. \n \n66. \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n(xii) \n\nemploy  women,  including  disadvantaged  women,  in  project  activities,  and  (2) \nensure safe working conditions for male and female workers. \n\nEmployment.  The  Government  will  encourage  (a)  the  use  of  local  labor  and \nprocurement  of  local  materials,  and  (b)  will  ensure  that  project  contractors  (1) \ncomply with applicable labor laws, including providing for equal pay to men and \nwomen for work of equal type, in accordance with national laws and international \ntreaty obligations, and (2) abstain from using child labor. \n\n(xiii)  Health  and  Social  Risks.

Development  planning  for  the  subsectors  was  the \nresponsibility  of  separate  government  organizations.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Roads \nserved  as  the  national agency  for  road  infrastructure  management.  It  managed  road  transport \nenterprises,  allocated  budgets,  assigned  work,  and  managed  personnel.  The  Tajik  Railway \nCompany served as the agency for railways, while the Tajikistan State Air Company served as \nthe  agency  for  civil  aviation  and  airports.  Each  organization  was  responsible  for  preparing \ndevelopment plans and investment programs for its own subsector. During the implementation \nof  the  development  plans,  the  Office  of  the  President  provided  coordination  for  review  and \nrevision  of  the  investment  programs  and  for  allocation  of  investment  funds  among  the \nsubsectors.  \n \n3. \nAs a result of policy dialogue with and technical assistance from ADB, the administration \nof the transport sector was reorganized and the Ministry of Transport (MOT) was created. MOT, \nwhich  now  regulates  Tajikistan  Railway  (Tajik  Rail)  and  Tajikistan  Airlines  (Tajik  Air),  is \nresponsible  for  planning  and  coordinating  all  modes  of  transport  within  the  country.  The \nGovernment is committed to develop a transport sector that meets the needs of a market-based \neconomy.  The  reorganized  MOT  reflects  a  policy  of  promoting  competition,  increasing  the \nprivate  sector's  role,  and  enabling  customers  to  make  informed  decisions.  In  the  future,  most \nstate-owned enterprises will play a minor role and will be expected to operate as independent \ncommercial enterprises.  \n \nSeparate deputy ministers are responsible for rail transport and air transport. These are \n4. \nregulatory  and  oversight  responsibilities  only  and  the  line  functions  remain  with  Tajik  Rail  and \nTajik  Air.  MOT\u2019s  Roads  Department  is  responsible  for  administration,  maintenance,  and \nconstruction  of  roads  in  Tajikistan,  and  has  a  number  of  associated  entities.  For  example, \nTajikgiprotransstroy  (the  Design  Institute,  a  joint  stock  company)  is  responsible  for  surveys, \ntesting of materials, design of maintenance, and new construction in the subsector. \n \nC. \n \n5. \nTajikistan\u2019s  road  standards  and  specifications  are  based  on  those  of  the  former  Soviet \nUnion  (FSU).  Several  studies  have  indicated  that  the  design  standards  of  FSU  state  roads \nimplemented  in  national  roads  in  Tajikistan  are  sometimes  higher  than  those  of  the  United \nStates or European countries. However, they do not always result in optimum road design. For \nlower-standard roads, FSU standards for design speed and cross sections are similar to those \nused in developing countries, but for higher-category roads, they are excessive. The quality of \nconstruction  of  Tajikistan\u2019s  roads  is  generally  inadequate,  mainly  because  of  a  lack  of  cost-\neffective  construction  techniques  and  independent  construction  supervision.  Road  safety  is \ndiscussed in the main text. \n \n\nRoad Standards and Safety \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n 29\n\nfor  road \n\nRoad Transport Industry \n\nRoad Subsector Revenue and Expenditure \n\n \nD. \n \n6. \nMajor  changes  have  occurred  in  the  road  transport  industry  since  independence, \nespecially  in  the  commercialization,  and  in  some  cases  privatization,  of  the  industry.  In  1998, \nthe  Government  had  jurisdiction  over  81  road  transport  service  enterprises.  Most  intercity  bus \nand  trucking  operations  are  now  organized  as  joint  stock  companies,  with  various  shares  of \npublic and private ownership. For example, of the 52 medium and large transport organizations \nthat  were  formerly  part  of  MOT  and  designated  by  the  Government  for  privatization,  73%  are \nwholly owned by the Government, 6% are wholly privately owned, and 21% have mixed public-\nprivate  ownership.  As  of  March  2002,  5,226  vehicles  were  operated  by  joint  stock  companies \nand  other  organizations  within  MOT.  Of  these,  3,627  vehicles  or  69%  were  operated  by  four \njoint  stock  companies  (Badakshonnakliyot,  Khatlontrans,  Khudjandnaklyot,  and  Kulyabtrans). \nThe remaining vehicles were operated by other MOT departments, Tajik Air, and Tajik Rail. A \nsignificant  portion  of  trucking  and  most  long-distance  bus  services  are  operated  by  private \ncompanies.  Tariffs \nfreight  have  been  completely  deregulated;  road  haulage \norganizations  enter  into  agreements  with  customers  at  negotiated  rates.  Tariffs  for  passenger \ntransport  are  still  regulated.  MOT  and  the  Ministry  of  Economy  jointly  establish  tariffs  for \npassenger transport for buses, minibuses, and taxis for urban and long-distance services. While \nthese official tariffs should be charged by all operators, many bus and minibus operators charge \nmarket fares, according to what they think people will pay, and do not follow the official tariff. \n \nE. \n \nThe state budget allocation for road rehabilitation and maintenance varies from year to \n7. \nyear  according  to  the  Government's  priorities  and  fiscal  constraints.  Prior  to  2000,  road \nsubsector expenditures were financed from the Road Fund, the state budget, and development \nagencies. The Road Fund had four main sources: (i) road-user and other taxes, such as excise \ntaxes on purchases of vehicles and parts, tires, fuel, and lubricants; and also including a 2.5% \ntax  on  transactions  by  all  companies  that  is  generally  not  considered  a  road-user  tax;  (ii) \ncharges on international transit shipments; (iii) vehicle inspection fees and registration fees; and \n(iv) contributions from local governments. In practice, only half of the Road Fund collection was \nallocated  to  road  rehabilitation  and  maintenance;  the  other  half  was  used  to  fund  new \nconstruction.  As  a  result  of  general  fiscal  constraints  and  allocations  to  new  construction, \nexpenditures  on  road  maintenance  and  rehabilitation  have  been  much  lower  than  what  was \nneeded  to  maintain  the  road  network  at  an  acceptable  level.  In  2000,  the  Government \nterminated the Road Fund to meet the International Monetary Fund requirement to maintain one \nconsolidated state budget.1 The taxes and receipts formerly contributing to the Road Fund are \nstill  collected,  but  now  are  paid  directly  to  the  national  treasury.  Road  maintenance  and \nconstruction are now funded from the general state budget. The following amounts have been \nallocated  to  the  road  subsector  in  the  national  budget  for  2005:  TJS18.1  million  for \nmaintenance,  TJS18.7  million  for  new  construction  (of  which  TJS12.2  million  is  for  the  Anzob \nTunnel),  and  TJS4.3  million  for  rehabilitation,  for  a  total  of  TJS41.1  million.  These  are \napproximately equivalent to the following amounts: $5.7 million for maintenance, $5.9 million for \nnew  construction,  and  $1.4  million  for  rehabilitation,  for  a  total  of  $13.0  million.  Details  on  the \ncurrent status of road subsector financing are discussed in the main text. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  The Road Fund was a first-generation fund, and did not include features such as administration by an independent \nboard found in second-generation funds. (ADB. 2003. Road Funds and Road Maintenance: An Asian Perspective. \nManila.) \n\n\f30 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nthrough \n\nRoad Maintenance \n\n \nF. \n \nMOT  is  responsible  for  planning  and  coordinating  the  maintenance  of  Tajikistan's  road \n8. \nfive  regional  road  departments: \nnetwork.  MOT  maintains  roads  and  bridges \nBadakhshan, Dushanbe, Khatlon and Kulyab (combined in 2005), Khudjand, and Rasht. These \nroad  maintenance  departments  are  responsible  for  approximately  13,800  km  of  road,  and \nemploy 2,981 people. The departments are state entities attached to MOT and are composed of \nroad maintenance units (RMUs). None of the departments or RMUs has been privatized. While \nit  is  the  stated  intention  of  MOT  to  eventually  privatize  them,  no  progress  has  been  made  to \ndate. The road maintenance departments prepare annual plans and budgets based on systems \nestablished  during  the  Soviet  era.  This  information  is  then  presented  to  MOT,  which  in  turn \nallocates funding to the various departments. The RMUs are responsible for the part of the road \nnetwork within their jurisdiction, with the actual maintenance being carried out by staff who are \nresponsible  for  specific  sections  of  the  road.  However,  the  plant,  equipment,  and  materials \navailable  to  the  workforce  are  generally  not  sufficient  for  carrying  out  effective  maintenance \nactivities. The Rasht Road Department and the Dushanbe Road Department are responsible for \nmaintenance of roads in the Regions of Republican Subordination. The Rasht Road Department \nis responsible for maintenance of the road to be improved under the Project. The Rasht Road \nDepartment  is  responsible  for  maintaining  885  km  of  roads,  is  composed  of  9  RMUs,  and \nemploys  237  people.  The  Dushanbe  Road  Department  is  responsible  for  maintenance  of  the \nroad sections being rehabilitated under the first phase. \n \nG. \n \n9. \nMarket-oriented  reforms  for  the  transport  sector  are  now  being  introduced  through \nimplementation  of  the  ADB-financed  Road  Rehabilitation  Project,2  the  completed  Postconflict \nInfrastructure  Program,3  the  Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz  Border  Road  Rehabilitation  Project  (Phase  I), \nand  several  related  advisory  technical  assistance  activities.4  The  status  and  achievements  of \nADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  to  date  are  summarized  in  the  Transport  Sector  Policy  Reform  Plan \n(Table A2). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nPolicy Dialogue for the Transport Sector \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB.  2000.

The  number  of  officially \n1. \nregistered  HIV  cases  remains  low,  with  385  cases  (321  males,  64  females),  mostly  under  30 \n(127 males, 38 females) and under 40 years of age (140 males, 17 females) as of May 2005.2 \nThe  methods  of  HIV  transmission  among  registered  cases  include  injected  drug  use  (59.7%), \nsexual  transmission  (8%),  and  unknown  (30.9%).  However,  these  data  may  not  accurately \nreflect  the  real  situation.  Diagnostic  capacity  is  low  and  the  social  stigma  and  discrimination \nassociated with infection mean few of those who are most at risk are tested. The real number of \nHIV infections may be 10\u201320 times higher. \n \n2. \nEconomic stagnation and lack of employment opportunities during and after Tajikistan\u2019s \ncivil  war  in  the  1990s  have  resulted  in  a  rapid  rise  in  cross-border  seasonal  migration.  About \n600,000 people (or 10% of the population) leave each year, mostly to the Russian Federation, in \nsearch  of  informal  income  opportunities.  According  to  the  International  Organization  for \nMigration (IOM), initial migration patterns involved mostly unskilled young males (ages 20\u201329), \nthough  most  recent  trends  suggest  increasing  migration  of  older  males  (ages  40\u201349).  The \nproject  area  in  the  Rasht  Valley  is known  as  a  traditional source  of  migrants.  Migrant  workers \nare  a  high  risk  category  for  contracting  HIV  and  other  sexually  transmitted  infections  (STIs), \nhaving typically two to three sexual partners over the course of an 8- or 9-month work season \nabroad.3 Younger male migrants use commercial sex workers more frequently than older men \nand, considering the high prevalence of HIV infections in the Russian Federation, a majority of \nthese migrants are at very high risk of passing STIs to their sexual partners at home. \n \n3. \nLimited understanding of contraception and strong feelings against the use of condoms \namong men are reflected in the poor understanding of sexual behavior, or the unwillingness to \nchange it. In 2003, only 2% of women between ages 15 and 49 reported using condoms,4 which \nare associated with sex workers and sex outside marriage. These issues are rarely discussed in \npublic, and there is widespread belief that HIV and other STIs are diseases that only prostitutes \nand the dissolute can contract. These attitudes make it difficult for wives to raise the subject of \nthe need for protection against STIs with their returning husbands, especially in more traditional \ncommunities.  There  is  also  a  profound  stigma  against  those  who  are  infected,  discouraging \ntesting  and  open  discussion  of  HIV  and  other  STIs.  Most  Tajik  labor  migrants  have  irregular \nstatus in their countries of destination. The health of migrants in an irregular situation can be at \nrisk  due  to  poverty,  discrimination,  vulnerability  to  labor  exploitation,  separation  from  families \nand  partners,  separation  from  the  sociocultural  norms  that  guide  behavior  in  stable \ncommunities, and, often, lack of access to health care and social services. \n \n4. \nTajikistan is also a country of origin for trafficked persons, mostly women. Two types of \ntrafficking  prevail,  both  of  which  are  increasing  rapidly:  labor  exploitation,  e.g.,  sweatshops  in \nthe  Russian  Federation,  and  trafficking  in  women  and  children  for  sexual  exploitation  and \ndomestic servitude, mostly to the Middle East. According to data received from the Ministry of \nInterior (2005) more than 58 trafficking cases were registered between January 2004 and March \n2005.  Many  Tajik  women  transit  through  Uzbekistan,  Kazakhstan,  and  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  to \ntravel  to  the  Middle  East  or  the  Russian  Federation.  Recent  evidence  from  IOM\u2019s  work  with \n                                                 \n1   Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.  \n2  The breakdown of HIV incidence by region accounts for: 168 (Sughd), 104 (Dushanbe), 57 (Gorno Badakhshan), \n\n48 (Khatlon), and 8 (Regions of Republican Subordination). \n\n3   IOM and Sharq Scientific Research Center. 2003.

Washington, D.C. \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n  35\n\nObjective and Scope \n\nProject Subcomponents \n\nvictims of trafficking shows that Osh (in the Kyrgyz Republic) is becoming a collection point for \ntraffickers from surrounding countries. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nThe  HIV/AIDS  and  migration  component  is  designed  to  mitigate  the  risks  of  HIV  and \nSTIs\u2014in  a  context  characterized  by  cross-border  seasonal  migration  and  human  trafficking\u2014\nduring  and  after  the  implementation  of  the  proposed  Project.  This  will  be  done  by  supporting \nlocal  governments,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  communities  to  develop  and \nimplement  an  integrated  and  gender-responsive  approach  to  HIV/AIDS  and  STI  prevention  in \nthe  construction  campsites  and  corridor  of  influence.  The  project  area  covers  three  districts  in \nthe Regions of Republican Subordination (Nurobod, Rasht, and Tajikabad) with 26 jamoats (or \nvillages) and a population of about 180,000. It includes Karamik, the 12-km section at the Tajik\u2013\nKyrgyz  border.  The  project  area  in  the  Rasht  Valley  is  characterized  by  a  combination  of \ngender-relevant  factors,  which  have  to  be  considered  in  the  design  of  HIV/STI  prevention \nprograms.  These  include  traditional  rural  societies,  seasonal  male  labor  migration  to  the \nRussian  Federation,  conservative  religious  beliefs  and  associated  gender-based  practices,  a \nhigh  percentage  of  female-headed  households  (including  war  widows),  women\u2019s  lack  of \nemployable skills, increasing drug trafficking and consumption patterns, and HIV/AIDS and STI \nstigmas and discrimination. \n \nC. \n \n6. \nBaseline information data on HIV/AIDS, migration, and human trafficking patterns in the \nproject area, including a list of local government and NGO stakeholders, will be gathered based \non existing quantitative and qualitative data.5 \n \n7. \nSubcomponent  1:  Capacity  Development  for  Local  Government  Agencies  and \nNGOs. This subcomponent will consist of training local government authorities (Departments of \nHealth,  Education,  Labor  and  Social  Protection,  Statistics  Committees,  and  Women\u2019s \nCommittees)  and  enforcement  agencies  (police  and  border  guards)  in  the  project  area  in \neffectively implementing the Government\u2019s policies, strategies, and regulations in the prevention \nof HIV/AIDS and other STIs, anti-trafficking, and the regulation of migration in the project area. \nThe training module will be developed by an international organization and will build upon the \ndemonstrated success of approaches in the project area. Training of selected local NGOs will \nbe  based  on  their  involvement  in  and/or  potential  to  increase  the  outreach  and  impact  of \nHIV/AIDS prevention, anti-trafficking, and regulation of migration in the project area. The training \nmodule will be developed by the international organization and relevant government agencies. It \nwill provide (i) technical skills (social, gender, and medical and psychological expertise related \nto  HIV/AIDS,  human  trafficking,  and  migration);  (ii)  administrative,  financial,  and  management \nskills;  (iii)  proposal  writing  skills,  to  ensure  quality  proposals  and  sustainable  access  to  donor \nfunding; and (iv) development of behavior change communication (BCC) strategy and materials \nfor local communities. Upon successful completion of the training, local NGOs will be involved in \nthe implementation of the BCC initiatives. \n \nSubcomponent  2:  Behavior  Change  and  Communication  for  Local  Communities \n8. \nand  High-risk  Groups.  In  the  context  of  an  AIDS  epidemic,  BCC  is  an  essential  part  of  a \ncomprehensive  program  that  includes  services  (medical,  social,  psychological,  and  spiritual) \nand  commodities  (e.g.,  condoms,  needles,  and  syringes).  This  subcomponent  aims  to  reduce \n\n                                                 \n5   At  this  stage,  the  feasibility  of  carrying  out  a  baseline  survey  in  the  project  area  is  uncertain.  It  will  be  further \nassessed by the National HIV/AIDS Center and the selected international organization during project inception. \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nrisk  levels  among  individuals  and  communities  along  the  road  corridor  and  establish  an \nenvironment  conducive  to  safe  sexual  practices.  BCC  activities  will  be  based  on  research \namong  target  groups  to  assess  the  determinants  of  their  sexual  and  reproductive  health \nbehavior.  The  target  groups  include  (i)  seasonal  migrants;  (ii)  women;  (iii)  intravenous  drug \nusers;  (iv)  sex  workers;  and  (v)  transport  companies,  local  business  owners,  and  road \nconstruction  companies  and  workers.  For  seasonal  migrants,  culturally  sensitive  initiatives  will \nbe  developed  in  consultation  with  families  of  migrants  and  community  leaders  to  devise \nsustainable modalities for the prevention of HIV/AIDS and other STIs. Activities for women will \naddress  their  greater  exposure  to  the  risks  and  impact  of  HIV  and  other  STIs.  In  light  of  the \nsensitivity  related  to  discussions  on  gender,  sex  and  sexuality,  risk  behaviors,  and  cultural \npractices  that  may  increase  the  likelihood  of  STIs,  BCC  will  include  food  nutrition,  hygiene, \nsanitation,  sexual  and  reproductive  health,  and  family  planning.  BCC  campaigns  will  be \ndeveloped  by  the  international/local  NGOs  under  the  national  policies  and  frameworks,  in \nconsultation with district- and village-level government agencies and community leaders. \n \n9. \nSubcomponent  3:  Clinical  Support.  HIV  testing  kits  and  STI  treatment  packages  will \nbe provided to health clinics to help meet the incremental needs of mobile populations and local \ncommunities.  These  will  also  complement  existing  programs  supported  by  the  National \nHIV/AIDS Center, United Nations agencies, and other donors. Condoms will be made available \nfree  of  charge  to  construction  workers,  local  communities,  and  target  and  high-risk  groups  for \nabout  2.5  years.  A  limited  number  of  condoms  will  be  distributed  during  the  first  year  of  road \nrehabilitation as part of marketing efforts. The component will closely consult with the National \nHIV/AIDS Center and the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund) on \nsustainable  condom  distribution  during  road  rehabilitation.  Training  to  health  workers  and \nlaboratory  technicians  will  be  provided  under  the  aegis  of  the  National  HIV/AIDS  Center  and \ninvolve  (i)  training,  consultation,  and  operational  support  to  health  workers  for  clinical \nmanagement of STIs as well as voluntary counseling and testing; and (ii) training for laboratory \ntechnicians on epidemiological surveillance and laboratory diagnosis. Training activities will be \nfurther  defined  by  the  National  HIV/AIDS  Center  based  on  the  specific  needs  and  constraints \nfaced  by  health  workers  and  laboratory  technicians  at  the  rapid  testing  centers  in  Rogun  and \nGarm, and at the Trust Center for Migrants in Garm. Clinical support activities will complement \nthe Global Fund's efforts to strengthen HIV/AIDS diagnostic infrastructure. \n \n10. \nThe  HIV/AIDS  and  migration  component  has  been  designed  in  consultation  with  the \nMinistry of Health\u2019s National HIV/AIDS Center to ensure consistency with the priority directions \non HIV/AIDS prevention set forth by the National Coordination Committee (2000). These priority \ndirections  were  further  defined  in  the  National  Strategic  Plan  to  respond  to  the  HIV/AIDS \nepidemic  (2002).  Discussions  with  UNAIDS6  and  the  Global  Fund  confirmed  the  lack  of \nsignificant  community-based  HIV/AIDS  and  STI  preventive  activities  in  the  project  area. \nConsultations  with  UNDP,  UNIFEM,  IOM,  the  Open  Society  Institute,  the  Aga  Khan \nDevelopment Network, and CARE provided valuable insights into lessons learned in the design \nand implementation of the HIV/AIDS and STI prevention program in Tajikistan. These lessons \nwere incorporated in the design of the component. \n \nD. \n \n11. \nThe  total  estimated  cost  is  $600,000,  which  includes  consulting  services;  training; \nseminars  and  conferences;  acquisition  of  HIV  testing  kits,  STI  treatment  packages,  and \ncondoms; and miscellaneous administrative and support costs. \n\nCost Estimate \n\n                                                 \n6   Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n  37\n\nImplementation Arrangement \n\n \nE. \n \n12. \nThe  Ministry  of  Health,  through  its  National  HIV/AIDS  Center,  will  be  the  Executing \nAgency  for  the  component.  The  Ministry  of  Health  will  engage  a  qualified  international \norganization (which could be an international NGO, consulting firm, or other entity) to manage \nand coordinate the implementation of the component. The international organization, which may \nassociate with local consultants or NGOs, will be recruited by quality- and cost-based selection \nusing  simplified  technical  proposals,  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other arrangements  satisfactory  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants. \nThe  international  organization  will  consult  with  the  National  HIV/AIDS  Center  on  the  design  of \nthe  capacity  development  activities  for  local  government  agencies  and  NGOs  (subcomponent \n1), and involve local government agencies and NGOs in the implementation of BCC initiatives \n(subcomponent 2). It will work with the National HIV/AIDS Center in the identification of training \nneeds, selection of consultants, preparation of training materials, and procurement of equipment \nand  supplies  for  STI  treatment  and  voluntary  counseling  and  testing  (subcomponent  3).  The \nterms of reference for the international organization is in (supplementary Appendix D). \n \n13. \nAt  the  central  level,  the  international  organization  will  be  responsible  for  organizing \nquarterly meetings of a steering committee in Dushanbe, chaired by the Director of the National \nHIV/AIDS Center, and including representatives from the Ministry of Transport (MOT) or project \nimplementation unit (PIU), the Committee on Women and Family Affairs, government agencies \ninvolved  in  anti-trafficking  and  regulation  of  migration,  and  relevant  international  organizations \nand local NGOs. At the district level, it will be responsible for organizing quarterly meetings of \nan  advisory  working  group,  chaired  by  the  Department  of  Health,  and  including  local \ngovernment  representatives,  local  representatives  of  the  Committee  on  Women  and  Family \nAffairs, community leaders (jamoat7 level), the UNDP office in Garm, international organizations, \nand local NGOs. The steering committee and advisory working group will provide guidance on \nthe implementation of the component. They will establish a forum for technical discussions and \nupdates  on  ongoing  government-  and/or  donor-funded  programs,  which  may  inform  and/or \ncontribute to orienting the focus of the proposed interventions. \n \nF. \n \nThe  National  HIV/AIDS  Center  is  in  the  process  of  finalizing  national  indicators  for \n14. \nmonitoring and evaluating HIV/AIDS prevention programs. The following output indicators may \nbe  adopted,  as  needed,  during  project  inception  to  ensure  consistency  with  the  national \nindicators:8 (i) number of government agencies and local NGOs trained in the project area; (ii) \nnumber of BCC initiatives carried out and target high-risk groups reached; (iii) number of labor \nskills transfer initiatives for women that have been carried out, and target groups reached; (iv) \nnumber of HIV testing kits, STI treatment packages, and condoms distributed; (v) percentage of \npeople seeking information on HIV/AIDS testing and counseling; (vi) percentage of people being \ntested for HIV; and (vii) number of STI patients seeking care and treatment. \n \n15. \nThe  international  organization  will  submit  a  detailed  work  program  1  month  after  the \ncontract  has  been  signed,  and  submit  quarterly  and  annual  reports  to  the  National  HIV/AIDS \nCenter  for  transmission  to  the  MOT/PIU  and  ADB.  The  international  organization  will  conduct \nmidterm and completion reviews and evaluations of the implementation of the component, after \n1 year and completion of implementation, respectively. \n\nMonitoring and Reporting \n\n                                                 \n7   Traditional local community unit in villages. \n8   At this stage, the feasibility of setting and monitoring impact indicators is uncertain. It will be further assessed by \n\nthe National HIV/AIDS Center and the selected international organization during project inception. \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nDate \n\nLocation \n\nPurpose(s)

Existing  data  on  historical  traffic \ncounts  by  the  Ministry  of  Transport  were  also  reviewed  to  determine  appropriate  base  year \ntraffic. \n \n2. \nThe  dissolution  of  the  former  Soviet  Union  and  the  outbreak  of  civil  war  caused  a \ndramatic reduction in traffic on the Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz border road. Since 1995, however, traffic \nlevels have been slowly increasing. At present, average traffic volume on representative project \nroad sections is 560 vehicles per day on the section south of Garm, 946 on the section in the \nGarm area with its higher levels of local traffic, 413 on the section north of Garm, and only 21 on \nthe section at the Tajik\u2013Kyrgyz border.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nForecasts  by  traffic  and  vehicle  type  were  prepared  for  the  project  road  sections  for \n2006\u20132029.  The  forecasts  are  based  on  expected  growth  in  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in \nTajikistan and international trade in the region and on income elasticities of demand. The traffic \nforecast for representative sections of the project road is summarized in Table A9. Total traffic is \nforecast  to  grow  at  annual  rates  of  11.5\u201315.8%  during  2006\u20132015  (the  years  during  and \nimmediately following project implementation), except for the border section, which has higher \ngrowth. The higher growth rates during these years are due in large part to the high growth of \ninternational traffic (para 5). Total traffic is forecast to grow at annual rates of about 6.0% during \n2016\u20132029. \n \nBased on forecast GDP growth and income elasticities of demand over the total project \n4. \nperiod,  average  annual  traffic  growth  rates  for  normal  and  domestic  generated  traffic  are \nestimated  at  6.9\u20137.2%  during  2006\u20132010,  6.0\u20136.5%  during  2011\u20132015,  and  5.9\u20136.2%  from \n2016 onwards (except for the border section, which has higher growth during 2006\u20132015).2 The \nhigher growth rates during 2006\u20132015 are due to the completion of the rehabilitation of the first \nphase at the end of 2007 and the completion of the Project in 2009. Domestic generated traffic \narises  from  increased  passenger  traffic  to  Dushanbe  and  increased  transport  of  fruit  from  the \nproject  area  to  Dushanbe.  The  improved  road  conditions  will  generate  demand  through  lower \nfares  arising  from  lower  vehicle  operating  costs,  and  as  a  result  of  less  damage  to  the  fruit \nduring shipment. \n \n5. \nInternational  generated  traffic  is  forecast  based  on  an  analysis  of  trade  patterns  in  the \nregion  and  potential  trade  from  improved  access  to  ports.  The  analysis  of  trade  patterns \nexamined  three  pairs  of  trading  partners:  Tajikistan\u2013Kyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan\u2013People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), and PRC\u2013Afghanistan. Improvement of the regional road network, on \nwhich  the  project  road  sections  presently  constitute  a  major  bottleneck,  will  provide  a  much \nmore direct and efficient transport route for trade of these country pairs and will greatly facilitate \ntrade. For Tajikistan and Afghanistan, both of which are landlocked countries, the project road is \nthe most direct route to the PRC, in particular the PRC\u2019s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2004.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  for  Preparing  the  Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz  Border  Road \n\nRehabilitation Project (Phase II). Manila. \n\n2  Real GDP in Tajikistan grew, on average, at more than 10% per year during 2001\u20132004, ADB estimates that GDP \ngrowth  will  slow  down  to  8%  by  2005  and  6%  by  2007.  (ADB.  2005.  Tajikistan:  Country  Strategy  and  Program \nUpdate (2006\u20132008). Manila.) \n\n  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n43\n\nwhich has a population of 19 million and has a dynamic economy, with an average GDP growth \nexceeding the national average during 2001\u20132003. In addition, the city of Karshi in Xinjiang, is \nthe eastern terminus of railway lines to other points in the PRC.  \n \nThe increased trade is based on the assumption that the PRC\u2019s share of the total trade \n6. \nof Tajikistan and Afghanistan will increase from the current very low levels to levels approaching \nthose of the PRC\u2019s other trading partners in the region. Also, trade between Tajikistan and the \nKyrgyz Republic is forecast to increase with the removal of the obstruction to trade. The PRC\u2019s \nshare of trade with Tajikistan is estimated to increase from 1.9% to 20.0% (less than the PRC\u2019s \n23.0%  share  of  trade  with  the  Kyrgyz  Republic)  by  2014.  It  is  assumed  that  80%  of  PRC\u2013\nTajikistan trade will pass through the project road after project completion. The PRC\u2019s share of \ntrade with Afghanistan is estimated to increase from the current level of 0.1% to 10.0% by 2014. \nIt is assumed that 70% of PRC\u2013Tajikistan trade will pass through the project road after project \ncompletion.  Additional  traffic  will  be  generated  by  the  increased  trade  arising  from  improved \naccess  to  ports  in  Pakistan.  Conservative  assumptions  have  been  used  to  estimate  the \ninternational  generated  traffic.  International  generated  traffic  is  forecast  to  increase  at  rates  of \n43.1%  during  2011\u20132015,  and  5.9%  from  2016  onwards.  The  high  growth  rate  during  2011\u2013\n2015 is expected as the PRC\u2019s share of total trade for Tajikistan and Afghanistan increases to \nlevels in line with other countries in the region. \n \n7. \nNormal traffic is expected to account for 46%\u201352% of total traffic on the project road in \n2029,  except  for  the  border  section,  on  which  it  comprises  only  6%  of  the  traffic.  Domestic \ngenerated  traffic  comprises  a  small  portion  of  total  traffic  at  2%  or  less  on  the  representative \nroad sections. International generated traffic comprises 34\u201353% of total traffic in 2029 except for \nthe border section, on which it comprises 94%. \n \n\nTable A9:  Actual and Projected Average Traffic Volume (2005\u20132029) \n(Vehicles per Day) \n \n\nRoad \nSegment \nSouth of \nGarm \n \n \n\n \nComponent \n\nNormal \nGenerated Domestic \nGenerated International \n \n\nTotal \n\nGarm Area  Normal \n \n \n \n\nGenerated Domestic \nGenerated International \n \n\nTotal \n\nNorth of \nGarm \n \n \n\nNormal \nGenerated Domestic \nGenerated International \n \n\nTotal \n\n2005\n560\n0\n0\n560\n\n946\n0\n0\n946\n\n413\n0\n0\n413\n\n2010\n786\n28\n159\n973\n\n1,322\n48\n159\n1,529\n\n583\n20\n159\n762\n\n2015\n1,068\n38\n955\n2,061\n\n1,785\n65\n955\n2,805\n\n801\n27\n955\n1,783\n\nBorder  \nSection \n \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank and technical assistance consultants estimates. \n\nNormal \nGenerated Kyrgyz Traffic \nGenerated China Traffic \n \n\n63\n2\n955\n1,020\n\n36\n1\n159\n196\n\n21\n0\n0\n21\n\n \n2020 \n1,322 \n46 \n1,274 \n2,642 \n\n2,204 \n79 \n1,274 \n3,557 \n\n997 \n33 \n1,274 \n2,304 \n\n84 \n3 \n1,274 \n1,361 \n\n \n2025 \n1,551 \n54 \n1,700 \n3,305 \n\n2,578 \n92 \n1,700 \n4,370 \n\n1,177 \n38 \n1,700 \n2,915 \n\n113 \n4 \n1,700 \n1,817 \n\n2029\n1,765\n61\n2,140\n3,966\n\n2,924\n104\n2,140\n5,168\n\n1,346\n43\n2,140\n3,539\n\n142\n4\n2,140\n2,286\n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\nCosts \n\nGeneral \n\nProject  economic  costs \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nThe  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  for  the  Project,  including  rural  roads,  by \ncomparing  the  with-  and  without-project  scenarios.  In  the  without-project  scenario,  the  road  is \nassumed to receive only minimal maintenance and will continue to deteriorate. The with-project \nscenario  includes  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  according  to  international  standards.  The \nproject  preparatory \ntechnical  assistance  considered  various  mutually  exclusive  project \nalternatives, and the proposed Project is based on the most cost effective and least cost option. \nThe economic analysis covers 23 years (2007\u20132029), based on a 3-year implementation period. \nAll benefits and costs are in constant 2005 prices. The economic prices are expressed using the \nworld price numeraire. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nimprovement  and \nmaintenance  (including  rural  roads),  equipment,  and  consulting  services.  Price  contingencies, \ninterest  during  construction,  and  taxes  and  duties  are  excluded.  Costs  were  divided  into \ntradable and non-tradable portions. A standard conversion factor of 0.9 was applied to the non-\ntradable  portion.  To  take  into  account  local  unemployment  and  underemployment,  costs  for \nunskilled  labor  were  adjusted  by  a  shadow  wage  rate  factor  of  0.75  to  arrive  at  the  economic \nopportunity cost. \n \nC. \n \nThe primary economic benefits for the Project are vehicle operating cost (VOC) savings \n3. \nfor  normal  traffic,  domestic  and  international  generated  traffic,  and  benefits  to  rural  roads. \nEconomic benefits were calculated using the same methodology used for costs. VOC savings \nwill  accrue primarily  from  improvements  in  the  road  surface,  horizontal  and  vertical  alignment, \nand increased average speed on some sections. Unit economic VOCs for six types of vehicles \nwere  estimated  using  the  Highway  Design  and  Maintenance  Standards  Model-IV,  and  are \nshown  in  Table  A10.1.  VOC  savings  for  normal  traffic  account  for  about  58%  of  total  benefits \nwhile benefits from international generated traffic account for about 37%. Benefits for generated \ntraffic are estimated at half the value of VOC savings for normal traffic. \n \n\nthe  resource  costs  of  road \n\nBenefits \n\ninclude \n\nTable A10.1: Representative Vehicle Operating Costs by Vehicle Type \n($ per '000 vehicle-km)  \n \n\nWithout Project \n\nWith Project \n\nVOC Savings \n\n Item \nNorth of Garm \nCar \n4WD \nMini Bus \n2 Axle Truck \n3 Axle Truck \n\nSouth of Garm \nCar \n4WD \nMini Bus \n2 Axle Truck \n3 Axle Truck  \n\n \n\n \n132.94 \n128.24 \n216.47 \n334.12 \n454.12 \n \n178.26 \n178.26 \n313.04 \n430.43 \n586.96 \n\n \n118.82 \n109.41 \n176.47 \n294.12 \n412.94 \n \n117.39 \n108.70 \n173.91 \n295.65 \n413.04 \n\n \n14.12 \n18.83 \n40.00 \n40.00 \n41.18 \n \n60.87 \n69.56 \n139.13 \n134.78 \n173.92 \n\n4WD=four-wheel drive, km=kilometer, VOC=vehicle operating costs. \nSource: Technical assistance consultants estimates. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n45\n\nDomestic  generated  traffic  is  defined  as  new  traffic  induced  from  the  reduction  in \n4. \ntransport  costs  arising  from  the  Project.  International  generated  traffic  comprises  new \ninternational  traffic  arising  from  increased  trade  among  countries  in  the  region  resulting  from \nimprovement  of  the  project  road.  The  Project  will  also  have  other  benefits,  such  as  improved \naccess  to  social  services  and  improved  road  safety,  however,  these  have  not  been  quantified \ndue to the lack of sufficient data. \n \nD. \n \n5. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated for the Project including rural \nroads and all other components (Table A10.2). The EIRR for the overall Project is 15.4%, and \nthe  net  present  value  is  $9.8  million,  using  a  12%  discount  rate.

The sensitivity analysis, shown \nin  Table  A10.3,  indicates  that  capital  costs  would  have  to  increase  by  44%  or  total  benefits \ndecrease by 29% for the EIRR to reach the level of 12%. Given the Asian Development Bank's \nexperience  with  similar  projects  in  Tajikistan  and  other  Central  Asian  republics,  such  changes \nare  not  expected  to  occur.  The  sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  EIRR  exceeds  the  level  of \n12% in all cases. International generated traffic would have to decrease by 80% for the EIRR to \ndrop to 12%. Such an extreme decrease is not expected to occur. \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n \n\nENPV ($ million)  Switching Value (%)  \n\nDistribution Analysis \n\n \n \n50 \n29 \n44 \n \n80 \n \n\n9.788 \n9.033 \n5.915 \n3.101 \n5.299 \n1.426 \n7.331 \n2.918 \n\nTable A10.3: Sensitivity Analysis \n \nEIRR (%) \n15.4 \n15.1 \n14.1 \n13.1 \n13.6 \n12.4 \n14.6 \n13.2 \n\nItem \nBase Case \n1 year implementation delay \nnormal traffic -20% \ntotal benefit -20% \ncapital cost +20% \nnormal traffic -20%; capital costs +20% \ninternational generated traffic -20% \nmaintenance at 50% \nEIRR=economic internal rate of return, ENPV=economic net present value. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and technical assistance consultants estimates. \n \nF. \n \n7. \nDistribution analysis was carried out in order to examine the distribution of the Project\u2019s \nbenefits among countries in the region and to examine the Project\u2019s impact on beneficiaries in \nTajikistan,  using  the  same  EIRR  methodology  and  assumptions  for  discount  rate,  price \nnumeraire, constant price, and standard conversion factor adjustment. The project benefits are \ndistributed primarily among four countries. The distribution of benefits is shown in Table A10.4. \nTajikistan receives 76% of net benefits, and 24% of net benefits accrue to other countries in the \nregion.  The  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  receives  12%  total  net  benefits;  Afghanistan \nreceives 5%, the Kyrgyz Republic receives 6%, and other countries receive 1%. The analysis of \nregional  benefits  is  based  on  estimates  of  increased  trade  of  three  pairs  of  regional  trading \npartners, and on the increased trade arising from improved access to ports in Pakistan provided \nby the project road. Conservative assumptions were used in the analysis. Benefits to the Kyrgyz \nRepublic and Kazakhstan, in particular, may be underestimated. \n  \n8. \nThe project benefits accruing to Tajikistan are distributed among five national groups: (i) \nusers of freight transport, (ii) users of passenger transport, (iii) vehicle owners, (iv) labor, and (v) \nthe  Government  and  economy  of  Tajikistan.  Users  of  passenger  and  freight  transport  and  the \nGovernment and economy each receive 22%\u201323% of total benefits. Due to the very competitive \nnature of the market for transport services, vehicle owners only retain about 5% of net benefits. \n \nG. \n \n9. \nA  financial  analysis  has  been  conducted  to  examine  the  impact  of  the  Project  on  the \nfinancial status of the Ministry of Transport and the Government, particularly the financial impact \nof the maintenance and operational costs that will arise. The additional real maintenance costs \nof  $90,000  per  year  represents  less  than  2.0%  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport\u2019s  budget  for  road \nrehabilitation and maintenance. The Ministry of Finance will be responsible for the debt service \npayments  for  the  Project,  and  has  confirmed  that  the  Project  is  consistent  with  the  Public \nInvestment Program agreed by the Government and the International Monetary Fund. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n47\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nItem \nBenefits \nNormal \nTraffic \n\nDomestic \nGenerated \n\nInt\u2019l \nGenerated \n\nRural \nRoads \n\nCosts \nInvest. \nand \nmaint. \n\nLabor \n\nTable A10.4:   Distribution of Net Benefits \n($ million) \n \n\nInternational \n \n\nTajikistan \n \n\n \n\nKGZ  PRC  AFG  Other  PTU  FTU  TJO  LO  Eco  Benefits  Benefits \n\n \n \nFPV \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nEPV \n \n \n19.36 \n\n \n0.25 \n\n \n12.28 \n\n \n1.54 \n\n \n \n(26.77) \n\n \n \n(20.10) \n\n \nEPV - \nFPV \n \n \n19.36 \n\n \n0.25 \n\n \n1.54 \n\n \n \n6.67 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n12.28 \n\n \n2.58 \n\n \n4.72 \n\n \n2.14 \n\n \n0.49 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n0.25 \n\n \n2.34 \n\n \n \n6.67 \n\nNet \nTajik \n\n \n \n19.36 \n\n \n0.25 \n\n \n2.34 \n\n \n1.54 \n\n \n \n6.67 \n\nNet \nTotal \n\n \n \n\n \n\n19.36 \n\n \n0.25 \n\n12.28 \n\n \n1.54 \n\n \n \n6.67 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n8.71 \n\n \n \n8.71 \n\n \n \n1.94 \n\n \n0.69 \n\n \n0.69 \n\n \n0.15 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n(4.72) \n\n(3.55) \n\n1.18 \n\n1.18 \n\n \n\n1.18 \n\n1.18 \n\n9.79 \n\n(31.49) \n\nNPV \n41.28 \nAFG=Afghanistan;  Eco=economy;  EPV=economic  present  value;  FPV=financial  present  value;  FTU=freight  transport  users; \nInt\u2019l=international; \nInvest=investment;  KGZ=Kyrgyz  Republic;  LO=labor;  maint.=maintenance;  NPV=net  present  value; \nPRC=People\u2019s Republic of China; PTU=passenger transport users; TJO=Tajikistan vehicle owners. \nSources:  Asian Development Bank and technical assistance consultants estimates. \n\n9.41  9.41  2.09  1.18  9.26 \n\n41.28  2.58  4.72  2.14 \n\n31.34 \n\n0.49 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \n\nIntroduction \n\nDescription of the Project  \n\nA. \n \nThis  summary  initial  environmental  examination  (SIEE)  report  has  been  prepared  to \n1. \nsummarize  the  potential  environmental  impacts  of  the  proposed  Project,  which  has  been \nclassified as Category B under the Asian Development Bank (ADB) categorization system. An \ninitial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  prepared  under  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance1  (TA) \nin  accordance  with  the  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental \nAssessment  Guidelines  (2003)  of  ADB.  The  IEE  was  prepared  by  the  TA  consultants  and  the \nMinistry  of  Transport  (MOT).  The  IEE  has  been  reviewed  by  the  State  Committee  for \nEnvironmental Protection and Forestry (SCEPF). \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe proposed Project will consist of the rehabilitation of about 77 kilometers (km) of the \ncenter  section  of  the  Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz  border  road  (km  140  to  km  217),  the  12-km  section \nadjacent  to  the  border,  and  60  km  of  rural  roads  in  the  project  area.  The  project  road  passes \nthrough  the  rayons  (regions)  of  Nurobod,  Rasht,  and  Dzhirgatal.  The  project  activities  will \ncommence  in  2007  and  be  completed  by  the  end  of  June  2009.  Average  daily  traffic  on  the \nsection south of Garm in 2005 is 560 vehicles, which will increase to 973 vehicles in 2010 and \n2,642 vehicles in 2020. The Project continues the scope of the Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz Border Road \nRehabilitation Project (Phase I),2 which is improving the first 140 km of the road. The Project is \nan integral part of a regional road network linking Afghanistan, Tajikistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, \nKazakhstan, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and Uzbekistan. \n \n3. \nresurfacing,  and \nreconstruction),  replacement  of  11  bridges,  repair  of  1  bridge,  and  construction  of  3  new \nbridges. Earthworks will be required in some areas to stabilize erosion, improve slope stability, \ninstall  rock  fall  protection,  improve  drainage,  and  widen  the  road  to  improve  forward  sight \ndistance.  The  Project  will  require  operation  of  a  concrete  batching  plant  and  asphalt  plant, \noperation  of  borrow  pits,  and  temporary  establishment  of  contractors\u2019  yards  and  material \nstorage  sites.  All  construction  activities  will  occur  within  the  existing  right-of-way,  with  the \nexception  of  (i)  minor  road  realignments  in  mountainous  areas  (within  unutilized  government-\nowned land), and (ii) road widening (2\u20134 m) within two short sections through peri-urban areas.  \n \nC. \n \n4. \nTopography  and  Climate.  The  topography  of  the  project  alignment  varies  from  flat, \nrolling  terrain  to  mountainous.  The  major  portion  of  the  alignment  passes  along  the  valleys  of \nthe Surkhob River and its tributaries. The southern section of the alignment has an altitude of \napproximately  1,200  meters  (m)  above  sea  level,  rising  to  approximately  1,700  m  above  sea \nlevel in the north. The alignment is bound to the north, east, and west by mountain ranges, but \nis open to the south, toward Dushanbe. As it flows southwards, the Surkhob River becomes the \nVakhsh River, which feeds several large reservoirs and a  number of large hydropower plants. \nThe  climate  of  Tajikistan  is  arid  continental,  characterized  by  considerable  seasonal  and  daily \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2004.

Manila. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n49\n\nfluctuations  of  temperature,  humidity,  and  precipitation.  Local  climatic  conditions  are  heavily \ndependent on microclimates established by the numerous mountain ranges. The sections of the \nalignment  which  pass  through  the  river  valleys  have  mild  summers  and  cold  winters.  Average \nannual rainfall along the alignment is 970 millimeters (mm) in Nurobod, 904 mm in Garm, and \n460  mm  in  the  Laksh  area.  Average  monthly  temperatures  range  from  10\u00b0C  to  30\u00b0C  during \nsummer and \u20135\u00b0C to 2\u00b0C during winter. The average monthly snowfall in the region varies from \n30 mm to 310 mm between November and January. \n \nGeology  and  Soils.  The  project  corridor  passes  through  geological  zones  of  granitic \n5. \nbedrock  (exhibiting  northwest  to  southeast  striking  faults,  highly  weathered  in  places)  and \nsedimentary deposits of Paleozoic and Mesozoic age (highly jointed exposed faces susceptible \nto block failure). The soils along the alignment in the river valleys are mainly gray alluvial soils. \nThe  soils  outside  the  river  valleys  are  generally  residual  or  colluvial  soils  with  relatively  low \nfertility.  There  is  a  high  percentage  of  rock  outcrops  in  the  more  mountainous  areas.  Perched \nwater  tables  were  observed  in  places  at  the  soil  rock  interface  with  associated  localized  mud \nflows.  Significant  levels  of  soil  erosion  occur  along  the  alignment.  This  is  due  to  both  natural \nconditions  (mountainous  terrain,  deeply  weathered  soil  profiles)  and  man-made  impacts \n(deforestation and overgrazing). Snow avalanches are common during winter. \n \n6. \nWater Resources. The project alignment runs along the valley of the Surkhob River and \nits  tributaries.  Residential  areas  along  the  alignment  use  the  surface  water  from  the  Surkhob \nRiver and its tributaries for irrigation, potable supplies, and some commercial usage. The water \nfrom  the  Surkhob  River  is  used  downstream  in  Tajikistan  and  Uzbekistan  for  hydropower \ngeneration,  irrigation,  industrial  use,  and  potable  water  supply.  Residents  along  the  alignment \nalso  use  groundwater  supplies  for  domestic  purposes.  The  depth  of  groundwater  is  variable \ndepending on the terrain. There are some hot springs located along the alignment.  \n \n7. \nDust  and  Air  Quality.  During  the  dry  autumn-summer  period  there  are  periodic  dust \nstorms  along  the  alignment.  There  are  no  atmospheric  monitoring  stations  located  along  the \nalignment.  However,  due  to  lack  of  industrial  development  the  air  quality  is  anticipated  to  be \nrelatively good. \n \nFlora  and  Fauna.  Tajikistan  hosts  5,000  plant  species,  81  mammal  species,  over  365 \n8. \nbird  species,  and  49  reptile  species.  Two  hundred  twenty-six  plant  species  are  categorized  in \nthe  Red  Book  of  Tajikistan  as  sensitive,  or  potentially  threatened  or  endangered.  Local \ngovernment  officials  have  reported  that  there  are  no  endangered  species  of  flora  and  fauna \nlocated along the project corridor. There are no protected areas along the project corridor. \n \n9. \nEconomic  and  Cultural  Resources.  The  population  of  the  project  area  is  about \n180,000. The project area\u2019s poverty incidence was 68% in 2004. The economy along the project \nalignment  is  primarily  based  on  agriculture,  including  grains,  potatoes,  vegetables,  fruits,  fur, \nmeat,  milk,  eggs,  silk  worms,  and  honey.  The  per  capita  GDP  in  2003  was  $189  in  Nurobod, \n$150  in  Rasht,  and  $237  in  Tajikabad.  A  significant  percentage  of  the  working  population  has \nmigrated from the area to find employment. There are no historical, cultural, or archaeological \nsites along the alignment, with the exception of a cemetery and a  mazar (religious site) at km \n200+700 and a cemetery at km 212+800, both adjacent to the alignment. \n \nD. \n \n10. \nSoil. Potential impacts to the soil along the alignment are from (i) soil erosion, (ii) borrow \npits, (iii) loss of agricultural land, and (iv) soil contamination. Soil erosion may occur along the \n\nScreening Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nalignment due to disturbance of the topography and changes in the local hydrology. Mitigation \nmeasures  during  construction  will  include  appropriate  engineering  design  (including  batter \nslopes,  compaction  levels,  and  installation  of  culverts),  planting  of  vegetation,  construction  of \nappropriate  storm-water  drainage  and  limiting  off-corridor  vehicle  movements.  The  Project  is \nanticipated  to  improve  erosion  due  to  the  construction  of  more  than  50  culverts  along  the \nalignment  and  slope  stabilization  works.  Mitigation  measures  during  operation  will  include \nstrengthened road maintenance capabilities for road drainage and landscaping. \n \nLocalized  impact  to  soil  may  occur  at  borrow  pit  sites  along  the  alignment.  Where \n11. \npossible,  existing  borrow  pits  will  be  used.  All  borrow  pits  will  be  rehabilitated  after  the \ncompletion  of  extraction  activities.  This  will  include  revegetation,  reformation  of  grades  to \nprevent  erosion,  and  replacement  of  stored  topsoil.  The  contractor  will  prepare  a  borrow  pit \nmanagement plan for approval prior to the commencement of excavation activities. Small areas \nof agricultural land may be temporarily lost to construction camps and materials storage areas. \nOff-corridor  construction  traffic  may  impact  agricultural  land,  although  this  is  not  expected. \nWhere  possible,  construction  camps  and  material  storage  areas  will  not  be  located  on \nagricultural land and pre-existing hardstand storage areas will be used. Otherwise, agricultural \nland  will  be  rehabilitated  after  construction  is  completed  and  construction  camps  and  material \nstorage  areas  have  been  removed.  Construction  traffic  will  be  confined  to  the  existing  road \ncorridor.  If  access  roads  are  required,  e.g.,  to  a  new  borrow  pit,  existing  tracks  will  be  used \nwhere possible. Contractors will get approval for proposed access road alignments and hauling \nschedules prior to construction. \n \n12. \nDamage  to  soil  and  groundwater  may  result  from  (i)  spillage  of  hazardous  materials, \nincluding hydrocarbon leakage, at the construction camps; (ii) inappropriate waste handling; and \n(iii)  spillage  of  hazardous  materials  during  transport  along  the  alignment.  Mitigation  measures \nwill include appropriate storage of hazardous materials, including hydrocarbons, and hazardous \nand/or  nonhazardous  wastes.  An  oil  interceptor  will  be  provided  for  all  vehicle  wash  down \nactivities.  All  hazardous  and  nonhazardous  wastes  will  be  disposed  at  local  municipal  waste \ndisposal facilities. There will be no site-specific landfills developed for the Project. The potential \nfor  contaminant  spillage  during  transport  will  be  reduced  by  the  road  improvement.  A \ncontingency plan will be developed for cleanup of spills during the operational phase. \n \n13.  Water Resources. Potential impact to water resources along the alignment includes (i) \nincreased  sedimentation  in  rivers  due  to  bridge  construction  and  earthworks,  (ii)  hydrocarbon \nleakage,  and  (iii)  sewage  discharge  from  construction  camps.  Increased  sedimentation  will  be \nmitigated through erosion control from the proposed earthworks, and management of spoil from \nconstruction  activities  in  or  adjacent  to  the  rivers  during  bridge  construction.  Hydrocarbon \nleakage  will  be  mitigated  through  appropriate  storage  and  handling  of  hydrocarbons  in  work \ncamps,  including  secondary  containment  and  spills  cleanup  equipment.  Sanitary  wastewater \nfrom the construction camps will either be collected and disposed in nearby municipal treatment \nfacilities, disposed in septic tanks located more than 500 m from the local waterway, or treated \non-site  according  to  national  wastewater  discharge  standards  prior  to  disposal  to  local \nwaterways. Sanitary wastewater will not be disposed untreated to adjacent waterways. \n \nAir Quality. During construction, air quality may be impacted by fugitive emissions from \n14. \nconcrete  and  asphalt  batching  plants  and  dust \nfrom  construction  equipment.  During \nconstruction, all concrete and asphalt batching plants will be operated within Tajikistan pollution \ncontrol  guidelines  and  will  be  located  at  least  1  km  from  the  nearest  residential  area.  Dust \ngeneration during construction will be minimized by dust suppression using water and requiring \nhaulage trucks to cover loads. The contractor will submit a dust suppression plan to the project \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n51\n\nimplementation unit (PIU) for approval prior to commencement of construction activities. During \nthe  operational  period,  air  quality  may  be  affected  by  increased  vehicle  emissions  along  the \nalignment.  However,  relative  impact  is  anticipated  to  be  minimal.  If  it  falls  within  national \nstandards,  no  additional  mitigation  requirements  are  recommended.  During  the  operational \nperiod, dust levels are anticipated to decrease due to improvements in the road surface. \n \n15. \nNoise and Vibration. The major impact from noise during the construction phase will be \nfrom  earthworks  machinery  and  rock  scaling.  Mitigation  measures  will  include  limits  on \nconstruction  operation  times  (0600\u20132100  hours  within  500  m  of  residences),  and  regular \nequipment maintenance to minimize noise discharge. During the operational phase, noise levels \nalong the alignment will increase due to larger traffic volumes. Noise modeling for the increased \ntraffic during the operational phase indicates noise levels will meet Tajikistan standards with the \nexception  of  approximately  4  houses  in  East  Garm  which  are  within  3.0  m  of  the  alignment. \nNoise  monitoring  will  be  conducted  in  these  areas  following  completion  of  construction  to \nconfirm noise estimates. Noise mitigation measures will be implemented where required. There \nare no sensitive sites (schools, hospitals, etc.) within 100 m of the alignment, with the exception \nof one school in Yangolik village. The major impact from vibration will be from road rehabilitation \nactivities  (re-grading  and  compaction)  near  residential  areas.  The  main  area  of  concern  is  a \nsection in East Garm where approximately 4 houses are located within 3.0 m of the alignment. \nThese houses will be monitored during construction to ensure structural integrity and the safety \nof  residents.  Vibration  impact  from  blasting  is  not  anticipated  to  be  an  issue  as  blasting \nrealignment  activities  will  be  restricted  to  mountainous  areas,  located  a  considerable  distance \nfrom any residential dwellings. \n \nSolid  Waste  Generation.  Solid  waste  generated  by  the  Project  will  include  domestic \n16. \nwaste, waste oils, and minor waste chemicals from the construction camps. All solid waste will \nbe  appropriately  stored  on-site  and  removed  from  the  site  for  disposal  in  municipal  waste \ndisposal  facilities.  There  will  be  no  site-specific  landfill  established  at  the  construction  camps. \nWaste bitumen generated from the road rehabilitation activities will be recycled, where possible.  \n \n17.   Recycling of Construction Materials. Where possible, reclaimed asphalt pavement will \nbe  reused  as  subbase.  Existing  granular  base  material  will  be  reused,  after  screening  or \nblending  to  achieve  required  specific  particle  size  distribution.  If  the  materials  cannot  be \nrecycled  for  road  construction,  they  will  be  moved  to  a  waste  disposal  site  approved  by  the \nSCEPF.  \n \nCulture  Impact.  There  are  no  historical,  cultural,  or  archaeological  sites  along  the \n18. \nalignment,  with  the  exception  of  a  cemetery  and  mazar  (religious  site)  at  km  200+700  and  a \ncemetery at km 212+800. The Project will not disturb these sites. \n \nFlora  and  Fauna.  The  alignment  does  not  pass  through  or  near  any  ecologically \n19. \nprotected  areas.  The  major  potential  impacts  to  flora  and  fauna  from  the  Project  are  (i) \nincreased poaching and cutting of timber by construction workers, and (ii) improved access to \nforested areas via improved rural roads, making them vulnerable to poaching and timber cutting. \nMitigation measures will include informing construction workers that poaching and timber cutting \nare  strictly  prohibited.  Regular  inspections  will  be  carried  out,  and  strict  penalties  will  be \nenforced. Appropriate access to food supplies and heating or cooking fuels will be provided in \nthe construction camps. \n \n20. \nSocial Impact. Construction activities will be managed to minimize disruption of normal \ntraffic flows. Road safety is expected to improve considerably due to landslide prevention works, \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n\nthe improvement of pavement, and the provision of road signage and barriers. However, since \nvehicle  speeds  will  increase,  livestock  fatalities  are  anticipated  to  increase.  The  Project  may \npotentially  impact  public  health  through  the  spread  of  malaria,  HIV/AIDS,  and  other  sexually \ntransmitted diseases. Mitigation measures will include the implementation of the HIV/AIDS and \nmigration component. \n \nE. \n \nThe Government\u2019s regulation on environmental impact assessment is based on Article 7 \n21. \nof the Law on Ecological Expert Examination (2003), which requires environmental examination \nfor  infrastructure  developments.  The  project  scope  is  not  included  in  the  type  of  projects \nrequiring  full  state  ecological  expertise  (SEE)  or  full  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA). \nTherefore,  the  Project  will  not  require  a  full  SEE  or  full  EIA  under  Tajikistan  law.  However,  in \nthese  situations  SCEPF  has  a  requirement  to  approve  projects  based  on  background \nenvironmental information provided by the applicant or proponent. Therefore, the IEE will serve \nas  a  background  document  required  for  SCEPF  approval.  There  are  no  other  SEE  or  EIA \ndocuments required for Project approval by the Government. \n \n22. \nThe  MOT  is  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  Project.  Together  with  the  construction \ncontractor,  it  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  requirements  of  the  Environmental \nManagement  Plan  (EMP),  and  following  all  applicable  Tajikistan  environmental  laws  and \nregulations.  A  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  will  be  established  within  MOT  and  will  be \nresponsible  for  project  management.  One  PIU  staff  will  be  assigned  responsibility  for \nenvironmental  management  for  the  Project.  An  outline  of  the  EMP  is  included in  the  IEE.  The \nconstruction contractor will prepare the EMP based on this outline and submit it to the PIU for \napproval.  The  recommended  contents  of  the  EMP  and  environmental  monitoring  plan  are \npresented in ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). The construction contractor \nwill  designate  an  environmental  representative  during  implementation  of  the  EMP.  The \nenvironmental  representative  will  be  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  EMP, \nenvironmental monitoring, and preparation of reports for MOT. \n \n23.  MOT  shall  ensure  that  the  contractors  implement  adequate  environmental  and  social \nimpacts  management  in  compliance  with  the  applicable  environmental  laws,  regulations, \nprocedures, and guidelines of both the local and national governments. Compliance with ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003)  should  also  be \nensured. MOT shall further ensure that the contractors implement the recommendations made \nin  the  IEE,  and  translate  the  EMP  in  the  IEE  into  a  contract-specific  EMP.  MOT  and  project \nsupervision  and  monitoring  consultants  will  submit  an  annual  report  to  ADB  on  environmental \nperformance  during  project  implementation.  Environmental  supervision  of  the  Project  will  be \nundertaken by MOT and SCEPF. MOT will ensure that the tender documents and contracts for \nthe Project incorporate environmental mitigation and monitoring measures. MOT will supervise \nthe  consultants  through  weekly  inspection  visits  to  the  sites  (visual  observations  and \ncommunications) and preparation of monthly reports. SCEPF will undertake random and routine \nenvironmental monitoring. \n \nF. \n \n24. \nPublic consultation was conducted in Dushanbe, Nurobod, Rasht, and Tajikabad districts \nand a number of small settlements along the proposed alignment from 10 March to 5 May 2005, \nin  accordance  with  the  guidelines  on  Public  Consultation  and  Information  Disclosure  in  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003).  The  consultation  involved  affected  people, \n\nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n53\n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\ncommunity  leaders,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  central  and  regional  government \nofficials.  Information  regarding  the  proposed  consultations  was  distributed  through  regional \ngovernment  bodies  prior  to  consultation  to  ensure  participation  by  a  wide  cross-section  of  the \ncommunity.  Consultation  methods  included  public  meetings,  focus  group  meetings,  spot \ninterviews, and questionnaires. The consultations were conducted in ten locations and included \nover  250  people.  The  consultation  process  indicated  that  the  public  generally  supports  the \nProject  and  is  anticipating  improved  economic  benefits.  The  major  concerns  identified  are \nrelated  to  employment  opportunities,  soil  erosion,  waste  management,  traffic  safety,  and  dust \nsuppression. Recommendations from the consultation were included in the engineering design. \n \n25. \nInformation  disclosure  is  being  undertaken  by  (i)  placing  the  SIEE  in  the  report  and \nrecommendation of the President which will be posted on the ADB website;3 (ii) providing copies \nof  the  IEE  and/or  SIEE;  (iii)  preparing  and  disseminating  an  information  brochure  in  Tajik, \nexplaining affected peoples\u2019 entitlements and the compensation and grievance procedures; and \n(iv)  establishing  a  formal  grievance  redress  committee,  including  community  representatives. \nThe MOT and/or contractor will be responsible for managing the grievance program. \n \nG. \n \n26. \nConstruction activities associated with the proposed Project consist of the rehabilitation \nof  77  km  in  the  central  section  of  the  road,  12  km  of  the  border  section,  and  improvement  of \napproximately 60 km of rural access roads. The communities along the alignment are generally \npoor, and the Project is anticipated to provide considerable benefits to local economies, as well \nas the national economy. The existing environment along the alignment is under considerable \nstress.  The  major  potential  environmental  impacts  from  the  proposed  Project  are  associated \nwith (i) soil conservation (slope stability and erosion control); (ii) protection of water resources \n(increased sedimentation and hydrocarbon storage); (iii) construction impacts on residents (air \nquality, noise, and vibration); (iv) environmental management of construction yards (solid waste, \nsanitary wastewater, hydrocarbon storage); (v) protection of flora and fauna (poaching and fuel \nwood collection); and (vi) protection from negative social impacts. \n \n27.  Mitigation measures for these impacts have been detailed in the IEE and this document. \nEffective  implementation  of  these  mitigation  measures  is  anticipated  to  reduce  the  identified \nenvironmental impacts to acceptable levels. \n \nH. \n \n28. \nThe proposed road rehabilitation is anticipated to have significant positive impact on the \neconomies  of  the  local  communities  and  to  the  national  economy  of  Tajikistan.  Based  on  the \nresults of the IEE, the Project will not generate significant environmental impacts, provided the \nmitigation  measures  detailed  in  this  document  are  implemented  appropriately.  Based  on  the \nrequirements  of  the  Government  of  Tajikistan  and  ADB,  there  are  no  further  environmental \nstudies required for the proposed Project.  \n\nConclusion \n\n                                                 \n3 http://www.adb.org. \n\n\f \n54 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\n \nIs the sector identified as a \nnational priority in country poverty \npartnership agreement?   \n\n \nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?  \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Tajikistan: \nThe civil war in the mid-1990s caused much destruction in the project area. It resulted in a high level of \npoverty  and  destroyed  basic  social  infrastructure.  Infrastructure  such  as  water  supply,  schools,  medical \nclinics,  and  some  electricity  supply  was  restored  to  a  minimal  level  through  the  effort  of  international \ndonors and NGOs as a part of post-conflict rehabilitation. However, the road infrastructure has not been \nrehabilitated and is subject to frequent damage from floods and landslides. The poor condition of the roads \ndiscourages  in-country  and  regional  trade  and  inhibits  the  population  from  accessing  markets,  other \neconomic opportunities, and basic social services. It thus has a negative impact on people\u2019s welfare and \nreduces living standards. \n \nAccording to the social survey of the project area, the rehabilitation of national and local roads ranks as a \ntop  priority.  The  residents  of  the  project  area  expect  to  benefit  through  improved  links  to  markets  and \nimproved  access  to  employment  opportunities and  social services  for  the  poor;  lower  transport  costs  for \nagricultural  inputs  and  products;  better  access  to  and  interaction  with  other  regions  for  transport  of \nessential  goods  from  urban  to  rural  areas;  and  employment  opportunities  during  construction,  and  after \ncompletion  from  increased  economic  activity.  The  project will  greatly  contribute  to  the  agriculture sector, \nspecifically the production of fruit, which must be transported on the project roads to reach markets. High \nlevels of damage to fruit during transport currently discourage both farmers and traders from investing in \nfruit production and trading. As a result, only 50% of the production capacity is being used.  \nB. \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nIncome poverty incidence in the project area is 68%, with the average income less than TJS600 per capita \nper  year.  Fifty  percent  of  household  income  comes  from  remittances  from  labor  migrants  abroad,  while \n35% is from agriculture. In terms of education, 100% attendance of children up to 9 years for both boys \nand  girls  is  attained  through  free  education.  As  for  health,  every  village  has  trained  medical  assistants. \nPrimary  health  care  centers  with  minimal  facilities  exist  in  all  jamoats  (counties).  Over  90%  of  the \npopulation in the project area has access to running water suitable for drinking. The total population in the \nproject  area  is  about  180,000.  All  of  them  will  benefit  from  the  Project,  including  about  120,000  poor \npeople. \nC. \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n   No  \nThe  Ministry  of  Transport  and  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA) 1 consultants  have \nundertaken socioeconomic surveys and conducted public meetings, which raised the level of awareness of \nthe  Project  and  gained  local  support.  Intensive  consultation  with  village  leaders,  rural  poor,  and  women \nwere  carried  out  during  the  PPTA  socioeconomic  survey  on  project  impact  and  on  resettlement  issues. \nThe  participatory  activities  are  an  ongoing  process  that  will  continue  during  project  implementation, \nincluding for the poor and women. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \nTo  maximize  the  benefits  of  the  Project  to  community  members  in  the  project  area,  the  Ministry  of \nTransport  will  encourage  the  contractors  to  hire  labor  from  the  local  communities  for  construction  of  the \nnational  and  rural  roads,  and  provide  training  as  needed.  As  part  of  the  selection  of  rural  roads  to  be \nrehabilitated,  local  authorities  and  leaders  are  being  consulted  closely  in  order  to  target  the  Project\u2019s \nbenefits on the most critical areas. \n \n \n \n                                                           \n1  ADB. 2004.

Manila. \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n55\n\nGender Development  \n\nD. \nMen  and  women  achieved  considerable  social  and  economic  gains  under  the  FSU,  but  gender  equality \nhas been undermined since independence. Social relations have been disrupted by changes such as the \nprivatization of economic assets, giving rise to new economic relations among families, communities, and \nthe Government.  Access  to  resources  required  for  survival was  further limited during the civil war, with \ncorresponding  influence  on  social  and  gender  relations.  The  conflicts  between  traditional  values  and \ncurrent  economic  needs  are  mediated  within  families,  but  the  conflicts  between  traditional  values  and \ngender  roles  are  more  difficult  to  mediate.  Women  are  expected  to  uphold  traditional  values  while \ncontributing to their families\u2019 livelihoods. Traditional gender roles and expectations of girls and women limit \ntheir access to education, skills, resources such as land, and frequently to knowledge of the outside world. \nPressure on men to meet all their families\u2019 needs is also strong, and this stress is sometimes expressed as \ndomestic violence or psychological harassment. Socioeconomic and gender-relevant issues in the project \narea were considered in the project design. These include traditional rural societies; seasonal male labor \nmigration  to  the  Russian  Federation;  conservative  religious  beliefs  and  associated  gender-based \npractices;  a  high  percentage  of  households  headed  by  females,  including  war  widows;  women\u2019s  lack  of \nemployable skills; increasing drug trafficking and consumption patterns; and women\u2019s greater exposure to \nthe risks and impact of HIV/AIDS2 and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe lack of connectivity between national highways and rural feeder roads critically affect women\u2019s access \nto basic social services (district health and education facilities) and district markets in areas characterized \nby  traditional  conservative  values  and  related  gender-based  discriminatory  practices.  According  to  the \nPPTA\u2019s social and poverty assessment, the project area is characterized by increasing gaps in women\u2019s \naccess  to  post-secondary  education  and  health  services.  Out  of  210  surveyed  households,  only  2%  of \nwomen had attended vocational schools and/or colleges, compared with 17% of men. Females reported \nlower literacy. Limited access to health services has been identified as a critical factor affecting women\u2019s \nlives,  as  reflected  in  low  health  indicators  (with  high  maternal  mortality  rates),  limited  knowledge  of \nsanitation, reproductive health, HIV/AIDS and other  STIs. Household surveys indicated that men have a \nwide range of employment opportunities, while women are predominantly limited to agriculture (78%) and \ntending livestock (13%). The average income of women was only 60% that of men. \n \nThe  Project  will  have  indirect  and  direct  benefits  for  women.  Indirect  benefits  are  mostly  related  to \nenhanced connectivity and include increased access to education and health facilities; increased travel to \ntowns; increased marketability of women\u2019s products (fruits and vegetables); increased access to jobs (in \nlocal markets); and increased access to information. Women will benefit from outside ideas as access to \nthe  rest  of  the  country  improves.  A  direct  benefit  is  the  adoption  of  an  integrated  and  community-based \napproach to HIV/AIDS and migration, targeting local communities and high-risk groups. It will reduce the \nlevel  of  risk  within  the  campsites  and  along  the  corridor  of  influence,  and  establish  an  environment \nconducive  to  the  maintenance  of  safe  sexual  practices  among  seasonal  migrants,  women,  intravenous \ndrug users, sex workers, and transport and construction operators. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\nE. \n  \n \nItem \n\nResettlement \n \n\nSocial Safeguards and Other Social Risks \n\n \nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n \nA maximum of 10 households will be affected by the \nproject.

The  Government  and \nthe  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  agreed  to  post  the  short \nRP on the ADB website.3 \n \nNo  tolls  will  be  charged  on  the  rehabilitated  road. \nTransport  costs  will  be  lowered,  and  local  people\u2019s \nincome  will  increase  from  improved  access  to \nmarkets and generated economic activity.  \n\nthe  PPTA,  and \n\ncommittee \n\nland \n\nand \n\n \nSurplus  labor  is  commonly  available  in  the  project \narea.  The  Project  will  hire  unskilled  labor  from  the \nproject  area  for  construction  of  the  main  road  and \nrural roads, and will provide skills training. \n\nin \n\n \nNon-Tajik  ethnic  groups  only  account  for  0.2%  of \nthe  total  population  in  the  main  project  area  (km \n140\u2013217).  Most  of  them  are  members  of  Tajik \nfamilies  by  marriage.  No  adverse \nimpacts  or \nsignificant changes to their livelihoods or culture are \nanticipated.  Tajik  citizens  of  Kyrgyz  ethnicity  form \nthe  majority  of \nthe  region \nthe  population \nencompassing the 12-km section of the road at the \nborder.  No  people  live  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of \nthis section. The ethnic Kyrgyz are treated the same \nas other citizens of Tajikistan, are not discriminated \nagainst,  and  will  benefit  from  the  Project  to  the \nsame extent as other residents of the project area.   \n \nTajikistan  is  at  an  early  stage  of  an  HIV/AIDS \nepidemic.  HIV/AIDS  prevalence, \nthough  under-\nreported,  has  been  identified  as  a  potential  risk \nduring  road  rehabilitation.  The  Project  will  support \nHIV/AIDS  awareness  and  prevention  programs \nunder  an  ADF  IX4-funded  HIV/AIDS  and  migration \ncomponent.  The  Ministry  of  Health\u2019s  National \nHIV/AIDS  Center  will  implement  this  component \nassisted  by  international  and/or  local  organizations \n(Appendix 4).

All the construction activities \nwill take place either within the existing right-of-way or, if necessary on unutilized state land. \n \n2. \nA  draft  short  resettlement  plan  (SRP)  has  been  prepared  by  the  Ministry  of  Transport \n(MOT),  the  Project\u2019s  Executing  Agency,  with  assistance  from  ADB  consultants.  The  draft  SRP \nwas based on the detailed impact survey completed during preliminary project design, and the \nsocioeconomic  survey  of  affected  households.  The  SRP  covers  all  project  components, \nincluding  all  expected  impacts  and  resettlement  measures.  The  rural  road  component  will  not \ninvolve  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  However,  to  guarantee  that  unforeseen  impacts  are \ntreated in accordance with ADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), MOT assures ADB \nthat if any land acquisition or resettlement is involved, the affected people will receive the same \ncompensation and other assistance provided for in the SRP. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nAll  the  rehabilitation  activities  will  take  place either  within  the  existing right-of-way  or,  if \nnecessary, on unutilized state land. No land acquisition or relocation of households is expected. \nNo loss of community and public resources is foreseen. If it becomes necessary for the Project \nto  use  any  new  borrow  pits  or  quarries,  these  will  be  located  on  unutilized  state-owned  land. \nHowever,  there  are  two  locations\u2014Garm  and  Yangolik  village\u2014where  small  portions  of  the \nright-of-way are occupied by hedges for homesteads and small branch houses.1 It is necessary \nto remove these structures to restore the road to the width necessary for safety. \n \n4. \nIn  Yangolik  village,  hedges  of  two  households  occupy  part  of  the  right-of-way.  Another \nfamily\u2019s small branch house will be adjacent to the road after rehabilitation. Therefore, it may be \nnecessary to move the structure by 2 m to keep the road to its designed width.  \n \n5. \nThe portion of the road in Garm includes a sharp curve in the eastern part of the town. \nThis  sharp  curve  and  the  existence  of  houses  and  an  earth  mound  to  the  west  cause  poor \nvisibility and impair safety. To solve this problem, the Project will straighten this section, which is \nabout  150  m.  Fundamental  engineering  work  for  the  straightening  was  done  17  years  ago \nduring the former Soviet Union. The work that remains to be done is either filling a deeply cut \ngully,  or  building  a  bridge.  Affected  households  were  relocated  and  compensated  years  ago.2 \nHowever, there are three houses on the eastern side of the gully: two are on the alignment; one \nis next to the alignment. One of the houses on the alignment is abandoned, while the other is \nnot inhabited, and is rarely used. The house next to the alignment is inhabited at present, but \nwill be buried if the gully is filled, or will be under the bridge. The owners of all of these houses \nhave  been  compensated,  but  the  owner  of  the  third  house  still  needs  some  assistance  for \nrelocation. \n \n6. \nThe upgrading of the 60 km of rural roads will be done within the existing right-of-way. \nNo  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  are  expected.  MOT  assures  ADB  that  in  case  land \n                                                 \n1  Small houses, like gatehouses, which are separate from the main house. \n2  Interviews with community members and leaders. \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nPolicy Framework and Entitlements \n\nacquisition  and/or  resettlement  are  necessary  for  the  improvement  of  the  rural  roads,  the \naffected  people  will  receive  the  same  compensation  and  other  assistance  provided  for  in  the \nresettlement plan. \n \nC. \n \n7. \nFor the people who are negatively affected by the Project, the resettlement objective is \nto achieve equal or better income and living standards in line with the Land Code of Tajikistan \n(2004) and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995). MOT will ensure that any people \nlosing  land,  housing,  other  assets,  or  income  sources  will  be  assisted  to  fully  restore  their \nincome and living standards. The cash compensation rates proposed represent full replacement \nas defined under ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995).

MOT\u2019s project implementation unit will assign one staff member \n\nInstitutional Arrangements \n\n\fAppendix 13   \n\n59\n\nVulnerable Groups \n\nConsultation and Grievance Redress \n\nresponsibility  for  resettlement,  including  coordinating  the  planning,  implementation,  financing, \nand reporting of land acquisition and/or other resettlement impacts for the project components. \nLocal  land  committees,  each  composed  of  nine  members,  will  be  established  in  all  affected \nvillages  and  towns.  The  local  land  committees  will  take  primary  responsibility  for  the \nresettlement consultation, implementation, and timely delivery of entitlements. \n \nE. \n \nAmong the affected households, two are headed by women. Their income of less than \n10. \nTJS500  per  year  is  below  the  poverty  line  of  TJS600.  Since  the  Project  will  not  affect  their \nfarmland  or  productive  assets,  there  will  be  no  additional  support  from  the  Government  other \nthan  compensation.  However,  MOT  will  provide  the  opportunity  for  these  households  to  be \nemployed under the Project so that they can earn extra income. \n \nF. \n \nThe  Land  Code  of  Tajikistan  (2004)  requires  disclosure  of  information  and  consultation \n11. \nwith people affected. The people affected have been notified about the key elements of the SRP \nduring  meetings  and  interviews.  Prior  to  implementation,  there  will  be  further  consultations \narranged  by  the  local  land  committees  to  discuss  specific  impacts  on  each  household.  The \nresettlement  scope,  expected  timeframe,  compensation  rates  for  land  and  other  assets,  other \nassistance  to  replace  assets,  relocation,  and  the  grievance  redress  mechanisms  will  also  be \nexplained.  The  local  land  committees  will  ensure  that  any  concerns  raised  by  the  people \naffected are quickly addressed. \n \n12. \nAll  complaints  will  be  processed  based  on  Article  47,  Chapter  7  of  the  Land  Code  of \nTajikistan  (2004).  People  affected  must  first  submit  their  written  complaint  to  the  local  land \ncommittee. If their complaint is not settled, they can file an appeal in court. \n \nG. \n \n13. \nSince  the  Project\u2019s  impacts  on  households  will  be  minor,  simple  monitoring  will  be \ncarried  out  to  check  the  process  of  compensation.  Internal  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be \nundertaken by the project implementation unit and reported to ADB through quarterly progress \nreports.  External  monitoring  will  be  done  by  an  international  and/or  domestic  nongovernment \norganization as part of project performance monitoring. Resettlement monitoring for this Project \nwill  be  part  of  the  overall  social  impact  monitoring.  An  annual  budget  of  $5,000  for  5  years  is \nallocated for the social impact monitoring. \n \nH. \n \n14. \nThe SRP budget estimate is $12,000 for all costs including compensation; resettlement \nsubsidy;  and  payments  for  other  assets  such  as  housing,  moving  allowances,  and  fees  for \nresettlement  administration.  The  Government  will  guarantee  to  supplement  the  resettlement \nbudget  as  necessary,  to  meet  any  shortfall  that  may  arise  during  the  achievement  of  the \nresettlement  objectives.  The  resettlement  implementation  schedule  has  been  prepared  based \non the project construction timetable agreed between MOT and ADB, and is presented in Table \nA13.2.  \n \n \n \n\nFinance and
