More broadly, this network is part of a \nlarger network providing links to the ocean ports of Iran and Pakistan to \nthe south, and to the Russian Federation to the north. The project road \nlinks the Rasht Valley in Tajikistan and the capital, Dushanbe. Poverty \nincidence in the project area, estimated at 68%, is higher than the \nnational  poverty  incidence  of  64%.  The  project  outputs  include  (i) \nimprovement of 89 kilometers (km) of the central and border sections of \nthe  Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz  border  road  and  60  km  of  rural  roads;  (ii) \nimproved sustainability of Tajikistan\u2019s road network through increased \nfinancing  of  road  maintenance,  procurement  of  road  maintenance \nequipment, installation of vehicle weighing systems, and implementation \nof  pilot  cases  of  tendering  road  maintenance;  (iii)  strengthened \ninstitutional capacity of the Ministry of Transport (MOT); (iv) improved \ngovernance  in  MOT  through  the  strengthening  of  its  accounting \ndepartment; and (v) improved road safety through the strengthening of \nthe Transport Safety and Security Unit. \n   \nRationale  The road sections to be rehabilitated under the Project are bottlenecks \nto regional trade due to their poor condition. In particular, these road \nsections obstruct trade between much of Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and \nadjacent countries to the south, and the Kyrgyz Republic, the Xinjiang \nUygur Autonomous Region of the PRC, and neighboring countries to \nthe north. By improving key sections of the road from Dushanbe to the \nTajik-Kyrgyz border, the Project will substantially reduce this obstruction \nto trade, and facilitate regional trade and cooperation. \n \nThe project road provides the only substantial link between the Rasht \nValley and Dushanbe. Before independence, the immediate project area \nin  the  Rasht  Valley  produced  large  quantities  of  fruit,  which  were \nmarketed throughout the former Soviet Union. However, fruit production \nin the project area has declined substantially since independence. Many \ninhabitants  of  the  project  area  live  in  rural  areas  where  poverty \nincidence is particularly severe. The improvement of the Dushanbe\u2013", "ii   \nKyrgyz border road and selected rural roads will improve access to \nDushanbe and other cities in the region, which have higher prices for \nagricultural products and more job opportunities than in the immediate \nproject area. The Project will lead to reduced transport costs, most of \nwhich will be passed on to transport users. \n \nThe Project includes a $500,000 ADF-IX grant-financed component on \nHIV/AIDS and migration, to be carried out by the Ministry of Health\u2019s \nNational  HIV/AIDS  Center.  The  ADF  grant-financed  component  will \ndevelop  an  integrated,  community-based  and  gender-responsive \napproach  to  the  prevention  of  HIV/AIDS  and  sexually-transmitted \ninfections (STI). Subcomponents include (i) capacity development for \nlocal government agencies and NGOs, including training to implement \nthe  Government\u2019s  policies,  strategies,  and  regulations  in  HIV/STI \nprevention,  anti-trafficking,  and  regulation  of  migration;  (ii)  behavior \nchange and communication for local communities and high-risk groups \nto reduce risks along the road corridor and establish an environment \nconducive  to  maintaining  safe  behavior  among  seasonal  migrants, \nwomen,  intravenous  drug  users,  sex  workers,  and  transport  and \nconstruction operators; and (iii) clinical support, through the provision of \nHIV testing kits and STI treatment packages to health clinics, to help \nthem  meet  the  incremental  needs  of  mobile  populations  and  local \ncommunities. \n   \nImpact and  The project impact will be increased trade in the region and increased \nOutcome  economic growth in the immediate project area. The project outcome \nwill be improved and sustainable regional and national road networks. \nThe  broader  region  served  by  the  road  network  being  rehabilitated \nunder the Project stretches from Kazakhstan to Afghanistan, with links \nto  the  Russian  Federation  in  the  north,  the  PRC  to  the  east,  and \nPakistan and Iran to the south. The immediate project area in the Rasht \nValley northeast of Dushanbe was the scene of heavy fighting during \nthe civil conflict in the 1990s. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total project cost, including physical contingencies, price escalation, \nand  interest  and  other  charges  during  construction,  is  estimated  at \n$39.5  million  equivalent,  of  which  $26.5  million  (67%)  is  foreign \nexchange cost and $13.0 million (33%) equivalent is local currency cost. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million)\n    Foreign  Local  Total \n  Source  Exchange  Currency  Cost \n  ADB       \n    Loan  26.1  3.4  29.5 \n    Grant  0.4  0.1  0.5 \n      Subtotal    26.5  3.5  30.0 \n  Government  0.0  9.5  9.5 \n        Total  26.5  13.0  39.5 \nADB=Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "  iii\nLoan and Grant  A loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR20,353,000  from ADB\u2019s \nAmount and  Special Funds resources will be provided in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTerms  standard  terms  and  conditions  for  loans  from  its  Special  Funds \nresources.  The loan will have a maturity of 32 years, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, and an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% during the remaining period. A grant of $500,000 \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources will also be provided. \n   \nPeriod of  Until 31 December 2009 \nUtilization \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2009 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The project implementation unit (PIU) for ongoing ADB-financed road \nArrangements  rehabilitation projects in Tajikistan will be responsible for implementing \nthe proposed Project.  In addition to the PIU staff implementing ongoing \nprojects, additional staff will be appointed to the PIU before the award of \nthe  civil  works  contracts.  The  PIU  head  will  be  supported  by \nprofessional and clerical staff with expertise and experience in financial \naccounting;  road  engineering;  construction  supervision;  contract \nadministration;  and  monitoring  of  environmental,  social,  and \nresettlement issues. One PIU staff will monitor environmental, social, \nand resettlement issues.  \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry  of  Transport  for  the  loan-financed  components;  Ministry  of \nHealth\u2019s  National  HIV/AIDS  Center  for  the  ADF-IX  grant  financed \ncomponent on HIV/AIDS and migration. \n   \nProcurement  All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in \n  accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Contracts valued in \nexcess of $0.5 million for goods and $1.0 million for civil works will be \nprocured  through  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  among \nprequalified bidders. Supply contracts for the equipment and supplies \nhave been packaged into four contracts, one of which will be financed \nfollowing  ICB  procedures.  Two  supply  contracts  not  exceeding \n$500,000 will be procured through international shopping. One contract \nfor equipment and supplies for the HIV/AIDS and migration component, \nnot exceeding $100,000, will be procured through direct purchase or \ninternational  shopping.  Civil  works  have  been  packaged  into  five \ncontracts. One will be financed following ICB procedures. The other four \nwill be financed following local competitive bidding procedures. ADB \napproved advance action for procurement of civil works on 18 August \n2005. \n   \nConsulting  International consulting services for 46 person-months will be provided \nServices  by a firm, for construction supervision, project impact monitoring and \nevaluation, implementation of measures to improve road safety, and \nproject management. The international consultants will provide on-the-\njob  training  for  the  counterpart  staff  and  domestic  consultants.  In \nassociation with  the  international  consultants, 400  person-months  of ", "iv   \ndomestic  consulting  services  will  be  provided  for  construction \nsupervision,  contract  management,  and  other  technical  advisory \nassistance, as well as for helping the international consultants monitor \nthe social and poverty impact of the Project through household surveys \nand  data  analysis.  Consulting  services  for  13  international  person-\nmonths and 185 domestic person-months will be required to implement \nthe  HIV/AIDS  and  migration  component.  Consulting  services  for  6 \ninternational  person-months  will  be  required  to  provide  training  for \nMOT\u2019s  accounting  department  and  auditing  function.  Consulting \nservices will also be required for project auditing. For all consulting \nservices, consultants will be recruited through an international firm in \nassociation  with  domestic  firms  through  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection,  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers and other \narrangements satisfactory for the engagement of domestic consultants. \nFull technical proposals will be required for the project supervision and \nmonitoring  services,  and  simplified  technical  proposals  for  the  other \nconsulting services. \n   \nProject Benefits  The region will benefit from the Project through increased trade, while \nand Beneficiaries  the  immediate  project  area  will  benefit  through  increased  economic \ngrowth. By improving key sections of the road from Dushanbe to the \nTajik-Kyrgyz border, the Project will substantially reduce the obstruction \nto trade caused by the poor road condition and will facilitate increased \nregional trade. Improvement of the road will facilitate transport of fruit \ngrown in the project area to Dushanbe and the regional markets, and \nlead to increased agricultural production. The economic internal rate of \nreturn for the Project is 15.4%, and the net present value is $9.8 million. \nTajikistan is estimated to receive 76% of the Project\u2019s net benefits; the \nPRC,  12%;  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  6%;  Afghanistan,  5%;  and  other \ncountries,  1%.  Users  of  passenger  and  freight  transport  and  the \nGovernment and/or economy will each receive about 22\u201323% of the \nproject  benefits  accruing  to  Tajikistan.  The  Project  will  help  reduce \npoverty in the project area by directly benefiting approximately 180,000 \npeople, including an estimated 120,000 poor people. The Project will \ngenerate  approximately  50,000  person-months  of  employment  for \nunskilled labor. \n   \nRisks and  The Project has been designed to reduce potential risks, which include \nAssumptions  delays in implementation due to inadequate implementation capacity of \nthe executing agency, failure to provide counterpart financing in a timely \nmanner,  the  traffic  forecast  not  being  realized,  inadequate  road \nmaintenance,  and  lack  of  security  in  the  project  area.  The  Project \nincludes a number of measures to mitigate the risk of implementation \ndelays. The existing PIU will implement the Project, and additional staff \nwill  be  hired  to  assist  in  implementation.  Advance  action  has  been \napproved. The PIU is familiar with ADB procedures and will be able to \nmake full use of the advance action provisions. The Government has \nassured  the  project  processing  missions  that  it  can  provide  the \nnecessary funds for all ongoing ADB road rehabilitation projects in a \ntimely manner. In addition, ADB is monitoring the Public Investment ", "  v\nProgram restrictions agreed to by the Government and the International \nMonetary  Fund  to  ensure  that  the  Project  does  not  cause \ndisbursements to exceed agreed limits.  \n \nThere is some risk that the traffic forecast will not materialize, especially \nthe generated traffic arising from increased international trade. There is \nalso a risk that the project roads will not be properly maintained and \nthus the full benefits of the Project will not be realized. The Government \nis  aware  of  the  importance  of  road  maintenance,  particularly  in  the \nproject area, which is mountainous and prone to landslides and rock \nfalls.  The  project  design  includes  elements  to  address  the  risks  of \ninadequate financing and implementation of road maintenance for the \nproject  roads.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  the  loan  assurances \nrequiring the allocation of specific levels of financing for maintaining the \nproject  roads,  in  addition  to  the  assurances  on  financing  for  road \nmaintenance nationwide. The Project also includes procurement of road \nmaintenance equipment, which will be used solely on the project roads. \nThe immediate project area is in an area that was placed under a United \nNations security restriction following the civil war. However, the security \nstatus was upgraded in late 2002 and again in September 2005 and is \nexpected to remain in the upgraded condition. \n ",

THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Republic of Tajikistan for the Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz \nBorder Road Rehabilitation Project (Phase II). \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \n2.  The road sections to be improved under the Project form an integral part of a regional \nroad network in Central Asia that directly links Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Uzbekistan. More broadly, this network is \npart of a larger network providing links to the ocean ports of Pakistan and Iran to the south, and \nto the Russian Federation to the north. The feasibility study for the Project was prepared \nthrough  an  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  technical  assistance  (TA).1  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework for the proposed Project is in Appendix 1. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n3.  Under the former Soviet Union (FSU), the regional road network existed only as part of \nan internal network, with no links to Afghanistan or the PRC. Following the breakup of the Soviet \nUnion, the condition of the national roads comprising the network deteriorated substantially \nbecause of the decrease in financing for road maintenance in most countries (arising from \nbudget constraints) and civil conflict in Tajikistan and Afghanistan. However, the situation has \nbeen improving over the last several years because financing for maintenance has generally \nbeen increasing and the civil conflicts have ended. Much of the regional road network is being \nrehabilitated by ADB and other international and bilateral agencies, with many of the projects \nalready completed. The ADB-financed first phase of the rehabilitation of the Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz \nborder  road  is  being  implemented.2  Among  the  recently  approved  projects  to  improve  the \nnetwork are (i) the ADB-financed project to rehabilitate part of the road from Osh to the border \nwith the PRC3 and (ii) the project financed by the Government of the United States to construct \na  bridge  over  the  Pyandzh  River.  The  river  forms  the  border  between  Afghanistan  and \nTajikistan, and is only passable by ferry and only during certain months. Additional projects to \nimprove remaining sections of the network are planned. ADB\u2019s regional program for Central \nAsia includes a loan to rehabilitate the remaining section of the Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz border road \nin Tajikistan (standby for 2007). The Islamic Development Bank and bilateral agencies are in \ntalks with the governments of Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic to improve other network \nsections. However, the road link from Nurobod in Tajikistan to Sary Tash in the Kyrgyz Republic \n(on the road from Osh to the PRC\u2013Kyrgyz Republic border) has not been rehabilitated. The \nsections of this road in Tajikistan, in particular, constitute a bottleneck to regional trade because \nof their poor condition. By removing this obstruction to trade, the Project will help realize the full \nbenefits of the completed, ongoing, and planned projects for the network. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

Manila. ", " 2 \n4.  The road subsector is the most important component of transport in Tajikistan. The \ncombined length of the road network is about 26,000 kilometers (km), consisting of 4,800 km of \nnational roads and 21,200 km of local roads. The Ministry of Transport (MOT) has jurisdiction \nover 13,800 km, including all national roads and 42% of the local roads (9,000 km). The \nremaining 12,300 km of local roads not under MOT are mostly rural and farm roads. The major \npart of the network was constructed before 1970. Inadequate maintenance, and damage from \ncivil conflict and natural disasters have left it in a state of severe deterioration. Of the national \nroads, 28% are asphalt, 46% are other pavement, 18% are gravel, and 8% are earth. More than \n70% of the roads are considered to be in poor or very poor condition. The scope of the network \nis considered adequate to accommodate existing traffic levels and support economic growth \nand sustainable development in the medium term as the network was constructed during the \nSoviet era, when transport demand was much higher. Since independence, the road transport \nfleet  has  been  increasingly  privatized  and  private  automobile  ownership  has  significantly \nincreased. A road subsector analysis and the Transport Sector Policy Reform Plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Obstacles to Development \n \n5.  Regional Cooperation. Increasing trade is key to accelerating economic growth and \nreducing poverty in Central Asia, particularly in Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic, with their \nsmall populations and limited natural resources (except for hydropower). Even in the Central \nAsian republics (CARs) with more natural resources\u2014such as Kazakhstan and the Xinjiang \nUygur  Autonomous  Region  of  the  PRC  (Xinjiang)\u2014the  contribution  of  trade  to  increased \neconomic  growth  is  constrained  by  their  landlocked  status  and  distances  to  ocean  ports. \nImprovement of the regional road network is therefore essential to increase economic growth. \nThree core problems constrain the development of regional road transport in the CARs: (i) lack \nof  a  unified  regulatory  framework  that  encourages  competition,  (ii)  delays  and  excessive \ncharges at borders, and (iii) physical deterioration of the network.4 ADB is involved in solving all \nthese problems. Development of a unified regulatory framework is one of the issues being dealt \nwith as part of the Transport Sector Coordinating Committee\u2019s work under the Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) program. Regional cooperation in improving customs \nprocessing is being promoted under regional projects such as the ADB-financed Regional \nCustoms Modernization and Infrastructure Development Project.5 The deterioration of the road \nnetwork  is  being  addressed  through  a  two-pronged  approach.  First,  ADB  is  continuing  its \nassistance program to improve roads comprising part of the regional network. Second, the \nimplementation  of  these  projects  includes  policy  dialogue  to  increase  financing  for  road \nmaintenance and to carry out institutional reforms to improve the efficiency of the maintenance \nsystem. The Project will continue to improve the road network through both of these avenues. \n \n6.  The road sections to be rehabilitated under the Project form a bottleneck that obstructs \ntrade between much of Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and adjacent countries to the south; and Osh in \nthe Kyrgyz Republic (a traditional crossroads for trade), Xinjiang (with its population of 19 million \nand  dynamic  economy),  and  neighboring  countries  to  the  north.  The  significance  of  this \nbottleneck is evident in the PRC\u2019s share of total trade of countries in the region. Kazakhstan and \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance for Reassessment of the Regional Transport Sector Strategy. Manila. \n5  ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loans and \nTechnical Assistance Grants to the Kyrgyz Republic and the Republic of Tajikistan for the Regional Customs \nModernization and Infrastructure Development Project. Manila. ", "  3\nthe Kyrgyz Republic have direct road access to the PRC that does not pass through this \nbottleneck. The PRC\u2019s share of total trade of these countries is 14.2% and 23.0%, respectively. \nHowever, the road connecting the PRC with Tajikistan and Afghanistan does pass through the \nbottleneck. The PRC\u2019s share of total trade with these countries is only 1.9% and less than 0.1%, \nrespectively. By improving key sections of the road from Dushanbe to the Tajik\u2013Kyrgyz border, \nthe  Project  will  substantially  reduce  this  obstruction  to  trade  and  will  facilitate  trade  and \ncooperation between countries north of the project road, including the PRC and the Kyrgyz \nRepublic,  and  those  to  the  south,  including  Tajikistan  and  Afghanistan  (para.  55).  The \nimprovement of the project road will also improve access to ocean ports in Pakistan, and lower \ntransport costs for CAR exports and imports. \n \n7.  The  increased  trade  and  regional  cooperation  arising  from  the  Project  will  yield \nsubstantial benefits for the region. In addition to the direct benefits from increased trade, the \nProject will improve efficiency in the region\u2019s economies. The reduced transport costs and \nremoval of the bottleneck to regional trade will result in increased demand for exports and \nimports,  thus  increasing  the  profitability  of  export-oriented  industries  and  decreasing  the \nprofitability of import-substituting industries. Economic resources will therefore shift from the \nimport-substituting industries to export-oriented industries, and increase economic efficiency. \nThis shift will also lead to increased employment, since export industries include agriculture and \nlight industry such as textiles. In the medium-term, this shift of resources to sectors in which \ncountries have comparative advantages will increase total output and living standards through \nmore efficient resource allocation and increased productivity.6 Because some of these benefits \narise from economic adjustments occurring over the medium-term and data are insufficient, the \neconomic analysis follows a conservative approach limited to direct benefits accruing primarily \nto Tajikistan, the PRC, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Afghanistan (para. 54). \n \n8.  Economic  Growth  and  Poverty  Reduction.  Tajikistan  has  significantly  reduced \npoverty in recent years. Strong economic growth, policy reforms, and a favorable economic \nenvironment led to sustained poverty reduction from 82% in 1999 to 64% in 2003. However, \npoverty is still highest among the CARs, with a per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of \n$310 in 2004.7 Although poverty in the project area has also been reduced, it is still higher than \nfor the country. Poverty incidence in the project area is estimated at 68%\u2014significantly lower \nthan the 91% estimated for the project area for phase I, which is adjacent to the project area for \nphase II. Poverty in the project area was reduced primarily because of increased remittances \nfrom residents working in the Russian Federation, rather than because of increased agricultural \nproduction, the primary source of livelihood. Before independence, the project area in the Rasht \nValley had large orchards and was a large producer of fruit that was marketed throughout the \nFSU. Fruit production in the project area has declined substantially since independence, and is \nestimated at only 50% of production capacity. The decline is due to (i) destruction from the civil \nconflict, (ii) disappearance of previous markets, (iii) the absence of an effective marketing \nsystem to replace what was used in the FSU, and (iv) the deterioration in road conditions, which \nresulted in high costs for transport and damage to produce. Fruit production requires a relatively \nlong-term investment, as orchards are generally not substantially productive until 7\u20138 years \nafter planting. Rehabilitation of the project road is a prerequisite for investment in orchards and \nfor economic growth in the project area.  \n \n9.  The project road provides the only substantial link between the Rasht Valley and the \ncapital, Dushanbe. Many of the inhabitants of the project area live in rural areas where poverty \n                                                 \n6 ADB analytical input for the forthcoming UNDP. 2005.

The improvement of the Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz border road and selected rural \nroads  will  ease  access  to  Dushanbe  and  other  cities,  where  higher  prices  are  paid  for \nagricultural products and where there are more jobs. The Project will lead to reduced transport \ncosts, most of which will be passed on to transport users. Numerous agriculture and other \npoverty reduction projects are being implemented in the project area by other international \norganizations. Improving transport in the area will maximize the benefits of these projects. \n \n10.  Road Subsector. MOT is responsible for planning and coordinating the maintenance of \nthe  road  network.  Maintenance  of  the  road  network  throughout  Tajikistan  virtually  ceased \nfollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union due to inadequate funding, and this is reflected in the \ndeteriorated condition of the road network. The situation was exacerbated by the civil war, when \nnumerous bridges and road sections were damaged. ADB has been addressing this issue \nthrough policy dialogue. Financing for road maintenance has increased greatly since 2003.  \n \n11.  The Transport Safety and Security Unit (TSSU) of MOT\u2019s Transport Policy Department is \nresponsible  for  the  physical  aspects  of  road  safety,  including  road  conditions  and  signs. \nTajikistan\u2019s road safety record in the mid-1990s was poor, with a fatality rate of 407 per 10,000 \nvehicles.8 Road safety has improved since then because of MOT\u2019s Accident Prevention Plan, \nwhich monitors about 30 indicators annually. Although the number of vehicles has increased \nsubstantially, the rates of road accidents and fatalities have remained relatively stable, with a \nfatality  rate  of  396  per  10,000  vehicles  in  2001.  However,  the  number  of  accidents  has \nincreased since 2000. There were 1,378 accidents nationwide in 2003 compared with 1,333 in \n2000. In the Rasht Valley, the site of the Project, the number of accidents increased from 20 in \n2002 to 22 in 2003, and the number of fatalities doubled from 14 in 2002 to 28 in 2003. \n \n12.  Overloaded vehicles cause premature deterioration of roads. Tajikistan is a party to the \nIntergovernmental Agreement on Vehicle Dimension and Weights which has been signed by 10 \nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. Two national decrees have been issued \nto make it effective9 but are not enforced because of lack of vehicle weighing equipment. The \nagreement and the decrees require that overloaded vehicles obtain a special permit to enter \nTajikistan and the other countries, which are allowed to charge for it. In practice, while Tajikistan \nissues permits jointly through MOT, the Ministry of State Revenue, and the Ministry of Internal \nAffairs, there is no schedule of payments and, therefore, no payments are being collected.  \n \n2.  Government and ADB Strategies \n \n13.  The Project is fully consistent with ADB\u2019s long-term strategic objectives for regional \ncooperation in Central Asia, medium-term strategic plan, and regional transport sector strategy. \nThe Project forms part of the core program of the Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program \nfor the CAREC countries for 2005\u20132006. The Project directly supports two of the four long-term \nstrategic objectives that are identified in the Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program: (i) \nincreasing trade and integration with large markets, including securing the CARs\u2019 access to \nmarkets in South Asia, the PRC, Iran, Turkey, and the Russian Federation; and (ii) improving \neconomic cooperation to reduce transport costs and to facilitate trade. Within the context of \nthese  long-term  objectives,  ADB\u2019s  medium-term  strategic  plan  for  regional  cooperation \ncomprises  two  components.  The  first,  the  core  program,  continues  ADB\u2019s  focus  on  three \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 1995. Technical Assistance for Regional Initiatives in Road Safety. Manila. \n9  Decree 93 of 11 March 2000 on adoption of the agreement on vehicle dimensions and weights for international \nroad transportation among CIS countries; and Decree 82 of 4 March 2005 on adoption of the agreement to \nintroduce international certificate for weighing cargo vehicles in the territories of CIS countries. ", "  5\nsectors, including transport and trade. The strategic plan recognizes that adequate capacity in \nthese sectors is essential for achieving sustainable economic growth, private sector growth, and \nforeign direct investment, which will create jobs and reduce poverty, but only with greater \ninfrastructure capacity. The plan also recognizes that much of the integrated capacity developed \nunder the FSU has fallen into disrepair and that rehabilitation is best undertaken regionally. \nADB\u2019s regional transport sector strategy for the CARs is to (i) provide physical links to all parts \nof the region, (ii) provide access to external markets, (iii) integrate and upgrade transport \ninfrastructure, and (iv) enhance competitiveness. The strategy focuses on developing regional \neast-west  and  north-south  transport  corridors  by  using  existing  infrastructure  to  link  state \ncapitals and local production centers to regional and international markets. \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  for  Tajikistan  focuses  on  promoting  growth  through  rural \ndevelopment and regional cooperation. Improving transport infrastructure is cited as an aspect \nof both rural development and regional cooperation. The Project is clearly consistent with ADB\u2019s \ncountry  strategy  in  its  objective  to  increase  regional  trade  by  improving  the  regional  road \nnetwork and rural roads. The Tajikistan Country Strategy and Program Update for 2006\u20132008 \n(footnote 7) specifies a loan for the third phase of the rehabilitation of the road for $20 million \nfrom the regional assistance pipeline, as standby for 2007 and firm for 2008. \n \n15.  The  Government\u2019s  Transport  Sector  Policy  Statement  outlines  the  policy  directive \nrequiring development of the transport sector to be based on market-oriented reforms and \nrestructuring to improve efficiency. The Government\u2019s strategy for the road subsector is to \nrehabilitate and maintain road infrastructure and to develop an efficient road transport industry \nthrough more private sector provision of transport services, greater reliance on cost recovery to \nfinance road maintenance, and rehabilitation of critical parts of the road network and transport \nservices that remain under state control. The Government aims to increase expenditures on \nroad maintenance, and has been doing so in line with ADB's policy dialogue. It also aims to \nchange  the  regulatory  framework  to  encourage  greater  private  sector  involvement  in  road \ntransport.  The  Government\u2019s  strategy  includes  developing  international  road  corridors  to \nfacilitate international trade. \n \n3.  Lessons Learned \n \n16.  The project design incorporates lessons learned from ADB\u2019s loan and TA operations in \ngeneral, ADB\u2019s road subsector operations in Tajikistan, and other projects and TAs in the CARs. \nOne lesson learned from ADB\u2019s impact evaluation study on rural roads and poverty reduction10 \nis  that  the  long-term  benefits  of  road  projects  can  be  threatened  by  neglecting  road \nmaintenance. The study recommends devolving responsibility for road maintenance to local \ncommunities,  particularly  for  rural  roads  to  ensure  long-term  sustainability.  An  ADB  TA \nperformance audit report11 found that expenditures on road maintenance should be increased in \nKazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Mongolia. The Project has loan covenants requiring \nspecified increases in financing for national road maintenance and specified levels of financing \nfor project roads, and provides for the purchase of maintenance equipment for the project roads. \nAn ADB special evaluation study12 notes that project implementation units (PIU) are a legitimate \nmeans  of  implementing  large  investment  projects,  but  cautions  against  the  proliferation  of \nseparate PIUs for individual projects. The Project has taken this into account by agreeing with \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2002. Impact of Rural Roads on Poverty Reduction: A Case Study-Based Analysis.

This PIU is physically \nlocated in MOT\u2019s headquarters. Many PIU staff members previously worked for MOT, and \nofficials and staff members of MOT and the PIU interact daily (para 41). \n \n17.  ADB is implementing two road rehabilitation projects in Tajkistan. Implementation of the \nRoad Rehabilitation Project13 had been delayed, but it is now proceeding without problems and \nwill be completed in December 2005. The implementation delays were mainly because of (i) \nlack of advance procurement action, (ii) a delay in declaring the loan effective, and (iii) the \ndetailed design being prepared by the supervision consultants under the project. Since there \nwas no advance action under this project, the supervision consultants, who were responsible for \npreparing the detailed design, could not be recruited until the loan had been declared effective, \nfurther delaying the preparation of the detailed design and the procurement of civil works. A \nlesson related to this project\u2019s policy dialogue is that funding road maintenance remains a \nchallenge given Tajikistan\u2019s fiscal constraints. These lessons have been incorporated into the \ndesign of the proposed Project. Advance action for procurement for the Project was approved \non  18  August  2005.  The  PIU  handling  the  ongoing  projects  is  functioning  well,  and  will \nimplement the proposed Project with the assistance of additional staff. Finally, the Government \nand ADB have agreed on loan assurances that will adequately finance maintenance of the \nproject roads and provide for significant annual increases in the financing of road maintenance \nnationally, without exceeding Tajikistan\u2019s budget. ADB is implementing the Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz \nBorder  Road  Rehabilitation  Project  (Phase  I)  (footnote  2).  Although  mobilization  of  the \ncontractor was delayed, it was due to the contractor\u2019s internal problems, and this project is \nexpected to meet the original completion date. \n \n18.  ADB has implemented a program loan for the transport and energy sectors, as well as \nan emergency infrastructure rehabilitation project focusing on damaged roads, bridges, and \nother infrastructure. The program completion report for the program loan14 found that, while \nachievements were substantial, the extensive program of transport and energy policy reforms \nwas too ambitious.15 The primary lesson learned was that covenants should be tailored to the \ncountry\u2019s capability to achieve them. The policy reform agenda of the Project thus focuses on \nthree areas, all of which are core aspects of the road subsector, and the Government and ADB \ndialogued extensively to ensure that Tajikistan is capable of implementing the loan assurances.  \n \n4.  External Assistance \n \n19.  ADB has provided more assistance to the road subsector than any other international \norganization (Appendix 3). The Islamic Development Bank, Government of Iran, and Kuwait \nFund have also provided large amounts of assistance to the transport sector.  \n \nC.  Policy Dialogue \n \n20.  ADB has been intensively involved in policy dialogue on the transport sector, particularly \nthe road subsector. The dialogue covered financing of road maintenance, commercialization of \ntransport  services,  improvement  of  transport  management  efficiency  by  improving  key \ninstitutions, separation of regulatory and operational functions of the sector, and other areas \nrelated to the transition to a market economy. As a result of policy dialogue and ADB TA, the \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2000.

MOT is responsible for \nplanning and coordinating all modes of transport. Tariffs for road freight have been completely \nderegulated; road haulage organizations enter into agreements with customers at negotiated \nrates. Tariffs for passenger transport are still subject to some official regulation, e.g., minimum \nfares, but in practice fares vary according to competition. The Project continues the policy \ndialogue on road subsector sustainability, institutional development, and road safety. \n \n1.  Road Subsector Sustainability \n \n21.  Road Maintenance Financing. Increasing the financing of road maintenance is key to \nimproving the sustainability of the road subsector. Both ongoing road subsector projects include \nloan covenants on road maintenance financing. They are based on a two-part approach to \nincrease allocations for maintenance, and to ensure that maintenance has high priority among \ntotal  sector  expenditures.  First,  the  covenants  require  annual  real  increases  in  budget \nallocations  for  road  maintenance  and  rehabilitation.  Second,  the  covenants  require  that \nallocations for road maintenance and rehabilitation comprise specified percentages of total road \nsubsector expenditures. Allocations for road maintenance and rehabilitation are required to be \nincreased by 15% per year during 2005\u20132007 and to comprise at least 80% of total road \nsubsector  spending,  excluding  the  construction  of  the  Anzob  Tunnel  on  the  Dushanbe\u2013\nKhujand\u2013Tashkent road, as it is considered a national priority project.  \n \n22.  The Government has exceeded the targets for annual increases in financing for road \nmaintenance  and  rehabilitation.  Approved  budget  allocations  for  road  maintenance  and \nrehabilitation increased substantially in 2004 and 2005. The allocation for 2005 is 57% higher \nthan in 2004. Compliance with the covenant requiring that road maintenance and rehabilitation \ncomprise at least 80% of total road subsector spending has been more challenging, although \nperformance is improving. The proportion was 59% in 2004 for actual expenditures, and has \nimproved to 79% for 2005. The covenant excludes from the proportion expenditures for the \nconstruction of the Anzob Tunnel. If expenditures for the construction of avalanche galleries on \nthe approaches leading up to the tunnel are excluded, the proportions for 2004 and 2005 \nincrease to 76% and 86% respectively, bringing the Government into compliance for 2005. \nUnder the proposed Project, the Government will continue to address the financing of road \nmaintenance. It will ensure that actual expenditures for maintenance (including emergency \nmaintenance but not rehabilitation and new construction) of MOT roads will be increased at \nleast at the same rate as the increases in the overall national budget during 2008\u20132009. The \nGovernment will allocate $90,000 per year (adjusted for inflation) for routine maintenance16 of \nthe  sections  of  the  Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz  border  road  rehabilitated  under  the  Project  and  will \nensure that the rural roads rehabilitated under the Project are adequately maintained. \n \n23.  Road  Maintenance  Tenders.  The  Project  will  improve  sustainability  of  the  road \nsubsector by introducing tendering for road maintenance with private sector participation. The \nGovernment will ensure that two pilot cases of maintenance of the completed sections of the \nDushanbe\u2013Kulyab  road  improved  under  the  Road  Rehabilitation  Project  (footnote  13)  are \ncarried out. It will use a competitive tendering process that is open to public and private entities \nin Tajikistan. This will be the country\u2019s first competitive tendering for road maintenance. \n \n24.  Vehicle  Weighing.  While  Tajikistan  has  legislation  and  national  standards  for \noverloaded vehicles, these are not enforced because of lack of equipment (para. 12). The \ninternational traffic on the project road could include a substantial number of overloaded trucks if \n                                                 \n16 Routine maintenance includes cleaning culverts, sealing cracks, filling potholes, and removing debris and snow.  ", " 8 \na vehicle weighing system is not implemented. The overloaded trucks could damage other \nrecently rehabilitated roads, as well as the project road. As part of the Project, MOT will procure \nvehicle weighing systems, install them, and make them fully operational on the project road and \nthe roads rehabilitated under the two ongoing ADB-financed road projects.  \n \n2.  MOT Institutional Development \n \n25.  ADB has been instrumental in the institutional development of the transport sector, \nincluding  the  establishment  of  MOT.  MOT  continues  to  reform  its  institutional  structure  to \nimprove its ability to manage the transport sector. In accordance with the recommendations of \nan ADB TA for Institutional and Policy Support to the Road Sector, attached to the loan for the \nRoad Rehabilitation Project (footnote 13), MOT established the Road Planning and Assessment \nUnit and the Economic Policy Division. The unit is responsible for assessing the needs for \nmaintenance, rehabilitation, and construction within the road network, and for planning road \nwork within MOT resources. The division is responsible for internal economic and financial \nanalysis, including auditing functions. Under the Project, MOT will ensure that the unit and \ndivision are made fully operational. MOT will address institutional development by reaching an \nagreement with the Tajikistan Transport Institute on implementing training programs for MOT \nstaff. \n \n3.  Road Safety \n \n26.  The Government has made substantial efforts in recent years to improve road safety and \nhas had some success (para 11). However, there is still much room for improvement. MOT \nrecognizes the growing seriousness of the road safety problem and the importance of taking \nproactive steps to reduce the number of deaths and injuries. MOT has agreed to improve \ncoordination among key agencies with road safety responsibilities, and to strengthen its TSSU \nto monitor and improve road safety. MOT agreed to extend an existing road safety audit (RSA) \nprogram into the planning and design stages of all major road schemes as soon as practical. \nSuch audits are currently undertaken only during construction and operation. MOT agreed to \ninclude an RSA in the detailed design and subsequent stages of the Project, and to include \nsuch specialist services in the contract of the design and supervision consultants. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n27.  The project impact will be increased regional trade and increased economic growth in \nthe immediate project area. The project outcome will be improved and sustainable regional and \nnational road networks. The region served by the road network encompassing the project road \nstretches from Kazakhstan to Afghanistan, with links to the Russian Federation to the north, the \nPRC to the east, and Pakistan and Iran to the south. The immediate project area encompassing \nthe road sections to be rehabilitated is in the Rasht Valley northeast of Dushanbe, the site of \nheavy fighting during the 1990s. Before independence, the project area was a major producer of \nfruit, which was marketed throughout the FSU. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n28.  The project outputs include (i) improvement of 89 km of the central and border sections \nof the Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz border road and 60 km of rural roads; (ii) improved sustainability of the \nroad  network  through  increased  financing  of  road  maintenance,  procurement  of  road ", "  9\nmaintenance equipment, installation of vehicle weighing systems, and implementation of pilot \ncases of tendering road maintenance; (iii) strengthened institutional capacity of MOT by making \nits Road Planning and Assessment Unit and Economic Policy Division fully operational, and \nreaching an agreement with the Tajikistan Transport Institute on a training program for MOT \nstaff; (iv) improved governance in MOT through institutional strengthening of MOT\u2019s Accounting \nDepartment and internal auditing function, and provision of computers; and (v) improved road \nsafety through strengthening of the TSSU. The primary inputs include (i) implementation of civil \nworks; (ii) consulting services for project supervision, mitigation of impact related to HIV/AIDS17 \nand sexually transmitted infections (STI), and strengthening MOT\u2019s accounting and auditing \nfunctions;  and  (iii)  procurement  of  equipment  for  road  maintenance  and  vehicle  weighing, \ncomputers to strengthen financial management in MOT, and supplies for the HIV/AIDS and \nmigration component.  \n \n29.  The two sections of the Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz border road to be improved are located in the \ncenter and at the border. Both sections are two-lane roads, although reduced to one lane at \nsome points. The central section covers 77 km (km 140\u2013217), and continues from the end of the \nsection that is being improved under phase I. The road passes along riverbanks throughout this \nsection,  which  has  some  severe  geological  conditions.  Originally  sealed  with  bituminous \nsurfacing for its entire length, the road has varied conditions. Some sections have only surface \ndeterioration, while others are no longer paved. In some areas, the road is barely a track. The \ncivil works on km 140\u2013150 will consist of minor pavement repairs and drainage improvements. \nThe civil works on km 150\u2013200 will vary and include pavement overlay or reconstruction; \nreinforcement of embankment; slope rehabilitation and protection measures; and installation of \ndrainage systems, safety facilities, and measures to prevent major rock falls and landslides. The \nexisting  800-meter  (m)  section  through  Garm  will  be  improved,  including  straightening  the \nalignment on about 150 m to improve road safety. The civil works on km 200\u2013217 will include \npavement, drainage, structural, and road-safety improvements, but no major earthworks. The \nProject will replace about 11 seriously deteriorated bridges, repair one bridge, and build three \nnew ones. All the civil works have been designed to comply with the highway design standards \ndeveloped under ADB\u2019s TA on road design standards in the CARs.18 The Project will improve \nthe  severely  deteriorating  12-km  section  of  the  road  adjacent  to  the  border.  It  is  closed \nthroughout the winter and periodically during the rest of the year. A major landslide in the middle \nof this section requires frequent maintenance. The works on this section include measures to \nmitigate the landslide and construct a gravel surface. The Project will improve 60 km of rural \nroads which are being selected based on socioeconomic criteria and conditions (para. 36). \n \n30.  Road maintenance equipment will be procured under the Project and used to maintain \nthe improved central and border sections of the project road. The equipment will allow MOT to \nkeep the road open continuously. The Project addresses the issue of the financial resources for \nroad maintenance (para. 22). Static vehicle weighing systems will be procured for use on roads \nbeing rehabilitated under ongoing ADB-financed projects, including the Dushanbe\u2013Kulyab road \nand the first phase of the Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz border road. A TA attached to the first phase loan \n(footnote 2) will help MOT establish policies and regulations to ensure the effective operation of \nthe vehicle weighing systems.  \n \n31.  To  strengthen  financial  management  in  MOT  and  support  the  Government\u2019s \nanticorruption efforts, the Project includes a component for the institutional strengthening of \nMOT\u2019s Accounting Department and internal auditing function. This component will (i) develop a \n                                                 \n17 Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n18 ADB. 1997.

", " 10 \nhigh-level competency  framework for the accounting function and develop job descriptions \nbased on the existing organization structure; (ii) document core business processes to assess \nthe nature and extent of financial transactions processed by MOT; (iii) review existing financial \naccounting  and  reporting  processes;  (iv)  determine  the  need  for  financial  accounting  and \nreporting manuals; (v) complete a training needs assessment; (vi) develop typical audit work \nprograms focusing on both substantive and compliance procedures; (vii) develop performance \nauditing guidelines; and (viii) design, develop, and conduct training and/or identify training \nopportunities in Tajikistan or externally, focusing on generally accepted accounting principles \nand international standards on accounting and auditing. The detailed terms of reference for the \ncomponent are in Supplementary Appendix A. In addition, computers will be procured to ensure \nmore efficient accounting operations in MOT\u2019s headquarters and regional offices. \n \nC.  Asian Development Fund IX Grant Component on HIV/AIDS and Migration \n \n32.  Tajikistan  is  at  an  early  stage  of  an  HIV/AIDS  epidemic.  The  number  of  officially \nregistered HIV cases remains low, with 385 cases as of May 2005, but the data may not be \naccurate. Diagnostic capacity is low, and some estimates consider the real number of HIV \ninfections to be 10\u201320 times higher. The rapid rise in cross-border seasonal migration (involving \n10% of the population) to the Russian Federation, the high percentage of households headed \nby  females  (including  war  widows),  conservative  religious  beliefs  and  associated  gender \npractices,  limited  knowledge  of  contraception  and  use  of  condoms,  and  increasing  drug \ntrafficking and consumption patterns, all result in women\u2019s vulnerability to HIV/AIDS infection. \nThe increased connectivity and mobility during construction and after project completion may \nincrease local communities' exposure to HIV/AIDS and other STI. \n \n33.  The Project includes an HIV/AIDS and migration component, to be implemented by the \nMinistry of Health\u2019s National HIV/AIDS Center, to develop an integrated, community-based, \ngender-responsive approach to HIV/AIDS and STI prevention in the contractor\u2019s campsites and \nin  the corridor  of  influence.  Subcomponents  will  include  (i)  capacity  development  for  local \ngovernment  agencies  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  providing  training  to \nimplement  the  Government\u2019s  policies,  strategies,  and  regulations  in  HIV  and  other  STI \nprevention,  anti-trafficking  measures,  and  regulation  of  migration;  (ii)  behavior  change  and \ncommunication for local communities and high-risk groups, to reduce the level of risk along the \nroad  corridor  and  encourage  safe  sexual  practices  among  seasonal  migrants,  women, \nintravenous drug users, sex workers, and transport and construction operators; and (iii) clinical \nsupport, by providing HIV testing kits and STI treatment packages to health clinics, to help them \nmeet  incremental  needs  of  mobile  populations  and  local  communities.  Monitoring  and \nevaluation of the grant\u2019s effectiveness will be integrated into the overall project performance \nmonitoring. The component will have separate progress reports. The critical financial needs for \nthe rehabilitation of the transport network, limited access to external financing, and lack of any \nsignificant community-based HIV/AIDS prevention program in the project area (other than HIV \ntesting and surveillance) justify the use of Asian Development Fund IX grant resources. The \ngrant  aims  to  support  a  selective  and  focused  range  of  activities,  and  creates  an  ideal \nopportunity for close ADB collaboration with a wider range of stakeholders and beneficiaries in \nareas that would not be feasible for loan financing. The component has been designed in \nconsultation with the Government, UNAIDS,19 and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis \nand  Malaria  to  ensure  consistency  with  the  Government\u2019s  priority  directions  on  HIV/AIDS \nprevention. A detailed description of the component is in Appendix 4. \n \n                                                 \n19 Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. ", "  11\nD.  Special Features \n \n1.  Improving Road Maintenance \n \n34.  With the assistance of ADB-financed projects and the associated policy dialogue, the \nGovernment  has  made  substantial  progress  in  improving  road  maintenance,  particularly \nfinancing. As required by the loan covenants, financing has been increasing substantially (para. \n22).  Under  ADB  TA,  a  road  maintenance  manual  for  national  roads  was  prepared, \nrecommendations for strengthening MOT\u2019s capacity to plan road maintenance were developed, \nand  training  in  road  subsector  planning  was  provided.  Procurement  of  road  maintenance \nequipment under ongoing ADB-financed projects is improving road maintenance by replacing \nold equipment that is beyond its operating life and has become expensive to operate. However, \ngiven the size of the road network, the difficult mountainous terrain, and continued budget \nconstraints relative to the demand, further work is needed to improve road maintenance.  \n \n35.  ADB continues to address this issue through loan covenants and components under the \nProject, which will ensure that the trend of increased financing continues, and that maintenance \nequipment and vehicle weighing systems are procured to prevent the excessive deterioration of \nthe roads. The issue is also addressed through TA to ensure that the funds are used efficiently. \nImplementation of the TA for Strengthening Implementation of Road Maintenance, attached to \nthe loan for the first phase (footnote 2), is scheduled to begin shortly. This TA will help the \nGovernment  develop  a  new  strategy  to  maintain  the  road  network  along  with  short-  and \nmedium-term programs to implement the strategy. The new strategy and programs will focus on \noptimizing the use of the funds available for maintenance, for example, by re-categorizing the \nnetwork. The TA will develop a manual for the maintenance of secondary roads and will provide \ntraining in road maintenance management and practices. ADB is also providing assistance to \ndevelop new means of maintaining roads, which will reduce dependency on the national budget. \nThe Tajikistan Community-Based Rural Roads Maintenance Project, financed by the Japan \nFund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR),20  will  develop  and  implement  community-based \nmaintenance practices for local roads to ensure that maintenance is done with the necessary \nfrequency, and to enable local communities to carry out the maintenance without relying on the \nnational budget (para. 36). \n \n2.  Rural Roads \n \n36.  The Project will improve 60 km of rural roads in the project area. Rural roads to be \nimproved are being selected in a consultative process that has included MOT, ADB, and the \nproject preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) consultants. The process began with lists of \npotential roads to be improved arising from discussions with local jamoat (community) leaders \nand rayon (district) officials. The consultants had extensive discussions with rayon leaders \nabout the condition of the rural roads and the potential socioeconomic impacts from improving \nthem, and the roads are being prioritized based on these factors. The condition of the rural \nroads varies, and the works will include grading and profiling of gravel roads; and repairing of \npotholes, patching, and, where justified, resurfacing or surface dressing of asphalt roads. The \nTajikistan Community-Based Rural Roads Maintenance Project will finance maintenance of an \nadditional 330 km of low-traffic local roads in the phase I and phase II project areas and will \ndevelop a system for sustainable maintenance for low-traffic local roads. The project will focus \non lower-category roads that feed into the rural roads and main roads being rehabilitated under \nphases I and II. \n                                                 \n20  On 18 October 2005, the President recommended this project for Board approval on 4 November 2005. ", " 12 \n3.  Stakeholder Consultations \n \n37.  During the feasibility study, environmental impact assessment (EIA), and resettlement \nplanning,  consultations  were  carried  out  with  government  agencies,  international  and  local \nNGOs, villagers and other stakeholders likely to be affected by the Project, and local groups \n(Appendix 5). Environmental concerns, land acquisition and resettlement issues, and economic \ndevelopment potential were discussed. Village investigations and surveys were conducted in \nthe project area to assess the potential benefits and adverse impacts of the Project. Over 2,300 \npeople  were  interviewed  in  the  public  opinion  surveys,  social  assessment,  environmental \nassessment,  and  resettlement  planning.  For  the  short  resettlement  plan  (SRP)  (para.  62), \nconsultation meetings were held with the affected townships and villages. The Project is well-\nknown among the rural people, and public support for it is high. Local officials explained the \npolicies  and  regulations  for  compensation  for  potential  land  acquisition  and  demolition  of \nstructures to those who may be adversely affected. These concerns were considered in (i) \ndetermining the alignment to reduce adverse social, resettlement, and environmental impacts; \n(ii) designing pedestrian access; and (iii) completing a detailed SRP. The consultation process \nwas expanded to finalize the design and formulate compensation standards and rehabilitation \nmeasures  for  people  affected  by  the  demolition  of  structures  in  the  right-of-way.  Villagers \nparticipated in the discussions and decisions on potential land acquisition and demolition of \nstructures in the right-of-way. \n \n4.  Road Safety \n \n38.  Improvement of road safety is a key area of the policy dialogue conducted under the \nProject (para. 26). Strengthening MOT\u2019s TSSU will result in substantial improvements in road \nsafety nationwide. The rehabilitation works will substantially improve project road safety by \nimproving the road surface (where extensive deterioration results in unsafe driving conditions), \nand replacing deteriorating and narrow bridges. The installation and maintenance of proper \nsignage and lane markings to highlight changes in alignment and other safety hazards will be \nemphasized. The Project also includes several other measures to improve road safety. Where \nthe  road  passes  through  settlements,  road  safety  measures  such  as  speed  limits,  speed \nreduction measures, pedestrian crossings, walkways, railings, and lighting will be provided. The \nsupervision consultants will prepare an inventory of slopes subject to rock falls and landslides, \nand draw up slope mitigation measures to be included in the Project\u2019s civil works. Equipment to \nimprove road safety during the winter, e.g., through removal of snow, will be procured. The \nsupervision  consultants  will  examine  the  possibility  of  establishing  rest  areas.  Consulting \nservices include an international road safety expert, who will review the detailed design and \ndrawings for compliance with road safety requirements, conduct a road safety audit, and advise \nMOT on enforcement measures to improve road safety.  \n \nE.  Cost Estimates \n \n39.  The project costs are estimated at $39.5 million, with a foreign exchange cost of $26.5 \nmillion and a local currency cost of $13.0 million, as shown in Table 1.

Financing Plan \n \n40.  The Government has requested ADB to provide a loan equivalent to $29.5 million to help \nfinance the Project (with an additional grant of $0.5 million for the HIV/AIDS and migration \ncomponent).  The  proposed  loan  and  grant  will  finance  $26.5  million  (100%)  of  the  foreign \nexchange cost and $3.5 million equivalent (26.9%) of the local currency cost, or 75.9% of the total \nproject cost. The proposed ADB loan will have a term of 32 years including a grace period of 8 \nyears, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter. The Government will provide counterpart financing of $9.5 million, including \n$5.3 million for value-added tax. Government financing of the value-added tax may take the form \nof a tax exemption or payment. Loan proceeds will not be used to finance taxes. The project loan \nis included in the Government\u2019s Public Investment Program.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n41.  MOT, the Executing Agency (EA), will maintain a PIU which will (i) monitor day-to-day \nproject  implementation,  (ii)  prepare  withdrawal  applications,  (iii)  prepare  project  progress \nreports, and (iv) maintain project accounts and complete loan financial records for auditing the \nProject. The head of the PIU, who must be acceptable to ADB and have adequate experience in \nproject  management,  will  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  supervision  of  implementation \nactivities. The PIU head will be supported by professional and clerical staff with expertise and \nexperience  in  financial  accounting,  road  engineering,  construction  supervision,  contract \nadministration, and monitoring of environmental, social, and resettlement issues. The PIU for \nthe ongoing ADB-financed road rehabilitation projects will be responsible for implementing the \nproposed Project as well. The PIU will have 16 staff, including the PIU head, to implement the \nproposed  Project  and  the  ongoing  Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz  Border  Road  Rehabilitation  Project \n(Phase I) (footnote 2). Two staff members will be added to the current level of 14, who are \nimplementing two projects. The additional staff members will be appointed to the PIU before the \nawarding of the civil works contracts. They will implement the Project together with the existing \nPIU staff. One of the additional PIU staff members will be designated to monitor environmental, \nsocial, and resettlement issues. ADB has been working closely with MOT and the PIU for \nseveral years on other road rehabilitation projects. ADB believes that MOT and the PIU have, \nwith consultant support, the financial management capacity to manage the Project effectively. \nThe Ministry of Health\u2019s National HIV/AIDS Center will be the EA responsible for implementing \nthe component on HIV/AIDS and migration. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n42.  The Project will be implemented in 30 months, from January 2007 to June 2009. This \nincludes mobilization but not the defects liability period, during which the contractor is responsible \nfor maintenance. The civil works, including mobilization, for the project road are scheduled to \nbegin in March 2007 and to be completed by May 2009. The detailed engineering design will be \nundertaken separately, and will not be financed under the Project. Prequalification, tendering, and \nevaluation for the Project will be undertaken immediately following completion of the detailed \ndesign, and will not be financed under the Project. The proposed implementation schedule is in \nAppendix 7. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n43.  All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Contracts valued in excess of $0.5 million for goods and \n$1.0 million for civil works will be procured through international competitive bidding (ICB) \namong  prequalified  bidders.  Supply  contracts  for  the  equipment  and  supplies  have  been \npackaged into four contracts, one of which will be financed following ICB procedures. Two \nsupply contracts not exceeding $500,000 will be procured through international shopping. One \ncontract for equipment and supplies for the HIV/AIDS and migration component, not exceeding \n$100,000, will be procured through direct purchase or international shopping. Civil works have \nbeen packaged into five contracts. One will be financed following ICB procedures. The other \nfour will be financed following local competitive bidding procedures. Tentative contract packages \nare listed in Appendix 8. \n ", "  15\n4.  Consulting Services \n \n44.  International consulting services for 46 person-months will be provided by a firm, for \nconstruction supervision, project impact monitoring and evaluation, implementation of measures \nto improve road safety, and project management. The international consultants will provide on-\nthe-job  training  for  the  counterpart  staff  and  domestic  consultants.  In  association  with  the \ninternational consultants, 400 person-months of domestic consulting services will be provided \nfor construction supervision, contract management, and other technical advisory assistance, as \nwell as for helping the international consultants monitor the social and poverty impact of the \nProject through household surveys and data analysis. Draft terms of reference for the project \nsupervision consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix C. Consulting services for 13 \ninternational person-months and 185 domestic person-months will be required to implement the \nHIV/AIDS and migration component. Consulting services for 6 international person-months will \nbe  required  to  provide  training  for  MOT\u2019s  accounting  department  and  auditing  function. \nConsulting  services  will  also  be  required  for  project  auditing.  For  all  consulting  services, \nconsultants will be recruited through an international firm in association with domestic firms \nthrough quality- and cost-based selection, in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory \nfor the engagement of domestic consultants. Full technical proposals will be required for the \nproject supervision and monitoring services, and simplified technical proposals for the other \nconsulting services. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n45.  All loan disbursements will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2001). The disbursement procedures will include (i) imprest account, (ii) direct \npayment,  (iii)  commitment,  or  (iv)  reimbursement.  The  Government  has  requested  that  an \nimprest account be established, after loan effectiveness, at a commercial bank acceptable to \nADB to expedite disbursement of the loan proceeds. The initial advance of the imprest account \nwill be up to $500,000. It will be established in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2001) and other procedures to be agreed on by the Government and ADB. The \nGovernment  may  withdraw  funds  from  the  imprest  account  to  finance  PIU  expenditures; \ntraining, seminars, and studies; procurement of locally available materials in an amount not \nexceeding  $50,000  equivalent  per  contract;  and  civil  works  contracts  awarded  under  local \ncompetitive bidding with a value not exceeding the equivalent of $50,000. ADB\u2019s statement of \nexpenditure  procedures  will  be  used  to  reimburse  expenditures  and  liquidate  the  imprest \naccount for payment not exceeding $50,000 equivalent per payment. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n46.  MOT, together with the PIU, will prepare and submit to ADB quarterly and annual \nprogress reports on project implementation, the form and content of which will be agreed with \nADB. MOT will maintain separate accounts for all project components financed by ADB and the \nGovernment.  MOT  will  have  them  audited  by  an  independent  auditor  that  has  adequate \nknowledge of and experience with international accounting practices, and is acceptable to ADB. \nThe audit will also cover the imprest account and statement of expenditure, and the final audit \nreport  will  include  separate  audit  opinion  on  these.  The  audited  project  accounts  and  the \nauditor\u2019s reports will be provided to ADB within 6 months after the end of each financial year. \nThe Government has been informed of ADB\u2019s requirement for the timely submission of audited \nproject accounts and financial statements, including the suspension of disbursements in case of ", " 16 \nnoncompliance. To facilitate evaluation of the Project, the Government has agreed to provide a \nproject completion report to ADB within 3 months of physical completion of the Project. \n \n7.  Anticorruption Measures \n \n47.  The  Government  is  making  a  significant  effort  to  reduce  corruption.  The  principal \nanticorruption measures are outlined in the New Anticorruption Law, which was approved by the \nParliament  in  June  2005.  The  law  defines  the  legal  and  organizational  basis  to  prevent \ncorruption. In April 2005, the President assigned responsibility to the relevant Government \nagencies to improve accountability and reporting within their ministries. The President\u2019s office \nhas also issued a decree requiring all parts of the Government to convert to international \naccounting  standards.21  MOT  is  undertaking  measures  to  implement  the  Government\u2019s \nanticorruption  program.  In  January  2005,  it  established  the  Economic  Policy  Division  with \nresponsibilities for internal auditing. The Project will strengthen MOT\u2019s anticorruption efforts by \ntraining MOT\u2019s Accounting Department and by strengthening MOT\u2019s Economic Policy Division, \nwhich has responsibility for internal audits. ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy22 was explained to, and \ndiscussed with, the Government and EA. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corruption, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy are included in the \nLoan Regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project. The Government is committed to creating \nand  sustaining  a  corruption-free  environment,  and  has  agreed  to  abide  by  the  relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy in preparing all documents and contracts during the \nbidding process and project implementation. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n48.  ADB and MOT agreed on a preliminary set of indicators for monitoring and evaluating \nproject  performance  in  relation  to  its  goals  and  purposes,  with  an  emphasis  on  poverty \nreduction. Representative indicators are included in the design and monitoring framework. At \nthe  beginning  of  project  implementation,  MOT  will  confirm  baseline  values  for  social, \nenvironmental, and poverty reduction impact indicators. Monitoring indicators will be measured, \nwith the necessary frequency, during project implementation. Comments and findings regarding \nthese project indicators will be incorporated in every other quarterly report to ADB. In addition to \nindicators for implementation monitoring, indicators for project evaluation will be measured at \nproject completion, 1 year later, and 3 years after completion. Where relevant, indicators will be \ndisaggregated by gender. Participatory surveys will take place, and results will be compared \nwith the baseline. A final report will evaluate changes in the preceding 3 years. MOT has \ndeveloped its monitoring capability for the ongoing projects, and has the capacity to monitor the \nProject as well. An international consultant will be recruited to help establish the monitoring and \nevaluation system and to monitor and evaluate all relevant socioeconomic and environmental \nimpacts of the Project. \n \n \n                                                 \n21 The decree did not indicate the specific international accounting standards to be adopted. \n22 ADB. 1998. Anticorruption. Manila. ", "  17\n9.  Project Review \n \n49.  ADB and the Government will carry out a midterm review of project implementation in \n2008.  The  review  will  focus  on  project  impacts,  particularly  those  relating  to  institutional, \nadministrative,  organizational,  technical,  environmental,  and  social  aspects  and  poverty \nreduction. The Project\u2019s economic viability, and other aspects that may have an impact on \nproject performance, will be assessed. The review will examine the implementation progress of \npolicy reforms and compliance with assurances specified in the Loan Agreement. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Traffic Forecast \n \n50.  Traffic forecasts by vehicle type were prepared for the project road sections for 2006\u2013\n2029 (Appendix 9). The forecasts are based on expected growth in GDP, income elasticities of \ndemand, and analysis of regional trade patterns. Total traffic is forecast to grow at annual rates \nof  11.5\u201315.8%  during  2006\u20132015  (the  years  during  and  immediately  following  project \nimplementation), except for the border section, which has higher growth. The high growth rates \nduring these years are due in large part to the high growth of international traffic and completion \nof the Project and the preceding first phase. Total traffic is forecast to grow at annual rates of \nabout 6.0% during 2016\u20132029. Average annual growth rates for normal and domestic generated \ntraffic are estimated at 6.9\u20137.2% during 2006\u20132010, 6.0\u20136.5% during 2011\u20132015, and 5.9\u2013\n6.2% from 2016 onwards. Domestic generated traffic arises from increased passenger traffic \nand transport of produce to Dushanbe. The improved road condition lowers vehicle operating \ncosts (VOCs) and generates demand through lower fares. It causes less damage to fruit during \nshipment, thereby increasing the demand for production and transport from the project area to \nDushanbe.   \n \n51.  International generated traffic is forecast based on an analysis of trade patterns in the \nregion and potential trade from improved access to ports in Pakistan. Three pairs of trading \npartners were examined: Tajikistan-the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan-the PRC, and the PRC-\nAfghanistan. Improvement of the regional road network, where project road sections constitute a \nmajor bottleneck, will provide a much more direct and efficient transport route for trade among \nthese country pairs. The PRC\u2019s share of Tajikistan\u2019s total trade is estimated to increase from \n1.9% now to 20.0% by 2014, still lower than the PRC\u2019s 23.0% share of the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s \ntrade. Similarly, the PRC\u2019s share of Afghanistan\u2019s total trade is estimated to increase from \n0.04% now to 10.00% by 2014. International generated traffic is forecast to increase by 43.1% \nduring 2011\u20132015, and by 5.9% from 2016 onwards. The high growth rate during 2011\u20132015 \nwill be due to the increase in PRC\u2019s share of total trade for Tajikistan and Afghanistan, which \nwill reach levels similar to those of other countries in the region. Normal traffic is expected to \naccount for 46\u201352% of total traffic on the project road in 2029, except for the border section, \nwhere it comprises only 6%. Domestic generated traffic resulting from lower transport costs \narising  from  the  Project  accounts  for  2%  or  less  on  the  four  road  sections.  International \ngenerated traffic comprises 34%\u201353% of total traffic in 2029, except for the border section, \nwhere it comprises 94%. \n \nB.  Economic Benefits \n \n52.  The economic analysis was carried out for the Project by comparing the with- and \nwithout-project scenarios (Appendix 10). In the without-project scenario, the road is assumed to \nreceive only minimal maintenance and will continue to deteriorate. The with-project scenario ", " 18 \nincludes routine and periodic maintenance according to international standards. The PPTA \nconsidered various mutually exclusive project alternatives, and the proposed Project is based \non the most cost-effective and least-cost option. \n \n53.  Project  economic  costs  include  the  resource  costs  of  road  improvement  and \nmaintenance (including rural roads), equipment, and consulting services. The primary economic \nbenefits for the Project are VOC savings for normal traffic, domestic and international generated \ntraffic,  and  benefits  arising  from  improvement  of  the  rural  roads.  Economic  benefits  were \ncalculated using the same methodology used for costs. VOC savings will accrue primarily from \nimprovements in the road surface, horizontal and vertical alignment, and increased average \nspeed on some sections. VOC savings for normal traffic account for about 58% of total benefits, \nand benefits from international generated traffic account for about 37%. Benefits for generated \ntraffic are estimated at half the value of VOC savings for normal traffic. Domestic generated \ntraffic is defined as new traffic resulting from reduced transport costs arising from the Project. \nInternational generated traffic comprises new international traffic arising from increased trade \namong  Tajikistan,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  the  PRC  and  from  improved  access  to  ports \nresulting from improvement of the project road. The Project will have other benefits, such as \nimproved access to social services and improved road safety. However, these have not been \nquantified because data is insufficient. \n \n54.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated for the Project, including the \nrural roads and all other components. The EIRR for the overall Project is 15.4%, and the net \npresent value is $9.8 million, using a 12% discount rate. The EIRR including only benefits \naccruing to Tajikistan is 11.9%. In addition to the direct benefits that have been quantified in the \neconomic analysis, the Project will yield substantial other benefits for Tajikistan. The immediate \nproject area was the scene of heavy fighting during the civil conflict in the 1990s, and the \nGovernment places a high priority on integrating this region\u2014economically and politically\u2014with \nthe  rest  of  the  country,  which  requires  improvement  of  the  project  road.  The  substantial \neconomic benefits arising from increased trade (para. 7) will have a major impact on Tajikistan. \nThe improved road will lead to decreased prices for imported consumer goods, as goods from \nthe region replace those currently imported from the Russian Federation, which will result in \nsubstantial consumer surplus benefits for the population. Likewise, reduced prices for imported \ninputs will make exports such as agricultural and light industrial products more competitive and \nlead to increased production. These products require labor-intensive production and will lead to \nincreased  employment.  Sensitivity  analysis  was  carried  out  to  test  the  effects  of  negative \nchanges in the key parameters that determine the project benefits and costs. The sensitivity \nanalysis indicates that either capital costs would have to increase by 44%, or total benefits \ndecrease by 29% for the EIRR to decrease to 12%. International generated traffic would have to \ndecrease by 80% for the EIRR to drop to 12%. Given ADB\u2019s experience with similar projects in \nTajikistan and other CARs, such changes are not expected. \n \n55.  A distribution analysis found that Tajikistan would receive 76% of net benefits: the PRC, \n12%; the Kyrgyz Republic, 6%; Afghanistan, 5%; and other countries, 1%. Tajikistan\u2019s share of \ntotal net benefits attributable to regional benefits would be 6%. Tajikistan would receive regional \nbenefits from lower prices for imports, sourced from the PRC via the project road, and from \nincreased exports to the PRC and other countries to the north. The PRC would receive regional \nbenefits largely from increased exports to Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The Kyrgyz Republic \nwould receive regional benefits from increased trade with Tajikistan and to a lesser extent \nAfghanistan, as well as from increased trade arising from improved access to ports in Pakistan. \nThe Kyrgyz Republic would also benefit from border-crossing fees for international traffic at the \nPRC\u2013Kyrgyz Republic border at Irkeshtam and from small-scale businesses providing services, ", "  19\ne.g., food and vehicle repair, for transit traffic. Afghanistan\u2019s share of regional benefits would \narise primarily from lower prices for imports from the PRC and from increased exports to \ncountries  to  the  north.  Kazakhstan  and  other  countries  in  the  region  would  benefit  from \nimproved access to ports in Pakistan; the reduced transport costs of reaching these ocean ports \nwould facilitate increased trade. In the longer term, the Project would likely facilitate the Kyrgyz \nRepublic\u2019s and Tajikistan\u2019s trade with India. A conservative approach was used in the estimates \nof the regional benefits, which are based on estimates of increased trade of three pairs of \nregional trading partners and on the increased trade arising from improved access to ports in \nPakistan provided by the project road. The project benefits accruing to Tajikistan are distributed \namong five national groups: (i) users of freight transport, (ii) users of passenger transport, (iii) \nvehicle owners, (iv) labor, and (v) the Government and/or economy of Tajikistan. Users of \npassenger and freight transport, and the Government and/or economy each receive about 22\u2013\n23% of total benefits. Because the market for transport services in the project area is highly \ncompetitive, vehicle owners only retain about 5% of net benefits.  \n \n56.  A financial analysis examined the project impact on the financial status of MOT and the \nGovernment, particularly the financial impact of the maintenance and operational costs that will \narise from the Project. The additional real maintenance costs of $90,000 per year represent less \nthan 2.0% of MOT\u2019s budget for road rehabilitation and maintenance. Based on the analysis \nundertaken, the Project is financially sustainable. \n \nC.  Environmental Impact \n \n57.  The environmental classification of the project is Category B. An initial environmental \nexamination (IEE) of the Project was carried out under the PPTA in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002) and ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). Based on \nthe results of the IEE, the Project will not generate significant environmental impacts provided \nthe mitigation measures outlined in the IEE are implemented appropriately. The summary IEE is \nin Appendix 11. \n \nD.  Poverty Reduction Impact \n \n58.  As a result of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the civil war that followed, poverty \nlevels  in  Tajikistan  became  very  high.  Although  the  country  is  now  recovering,  the \nsocioeconomic  survey  undertaken  for  the  Project  revealed  that  an  estimated  68%  of  the \npopulation and 62% of the households in the affected area have an income per head of less \nthan TJS600 per year, which has been identified as a suitable poverty benchmark. Even people \nwith regular employment and who travel regularly are living in poverty because of low wages \nand large households. As a result, the poor are well represented among road users and are \npotential beneficiaries. Unlike in many other countries, a high proportion of the poor own motor \nvehicles\u2014albeit  old  ones  in  use  since  the  FSU.  There  are  no  large  commercial  transport \noperators, but there is a highly competitive market of owner-drivers, as the supply of commercial \ntransport services exceeds demand. VOC savings are therefore likely to be passed on as \nreduced costs, fares, and charges. The impact on fares will be tracked as part of the monitoring \nand evaluation procedures agreed on for the Project. \n \n59.  The project area\u2019s population consists largely of rural people, most of whom are farmers. \nThe Project will reduce poverty by lowering the transport costs for farm produce and for people \ntraveling to agricultural and labor markets, health and education centers, and other social and \npublic services. The poverty assessment shows that the Project will significantly reduce poverty. \nIt will directly benefit about 180,000 people in the 26 districts adjacent to the project road; and ", " 20 \nroad  users  from  outside  the  immediate  project  area,  who  use  the  project  road  to  access \nDushanbe. Of the domestic beneficiaries, an estimated 120,000 poor people will be direct \nbeneficiaries. Others will benefit from lower transport costs leading to reduced consumer prices \nand generated economic and social development. The Project will generate many skilled and \nunskilled  jobs  during  implementation.  Unskilled  labor  will  be  employed  directly  in  road \nconstruction, and indirectly in provision of materials and support services. The Project will create \nabout 45,000 person-months of unskilled labor for the rehabilitation of the Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz \nborder road and 5,000 person-months for the rural roads. The summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 12. \n \nE.  Social and Gender Impact \n \n60.  Men and women achieved considerable social and economic gains under the FSU, but \ngender  equality  has  been  undermined  since  independence.  Social  relations  have  been \ndisrupted by changes such as the privatization of economic assets, giving rise to new economic \nrelations among families, communities, and the Government. Access to resources required for \nsurvival was further limited during the civil war, with corresponding influence on social and \ngender relations. The conflicts between traditional values and current economic needs are \nmediated within families, but the conflicts between traditional values and gender roles are more \ndifficult to mediate. Women are expected to uphold traditional values while contributing to their \nfamilies\u2019 livelihoods. Traditional gender roles and expectations of girls and women limit their \naccess to education, skills, resources such as land and, frequently to knowledge of the outside \nworld. Pressure on men to meet all their families\u2019 needs is also strong, and this stress is \nsometimes expressed as domestic violence or psychological harassment. In the immediate \nproject area, many more men than women access postsecondary education. Out of the 210 \nsurveyed households, only 2% of the women had attended vocational schools and/or colleges \ncompared with 17% of men. Females reported lower literacy. While men have a wide range of \njob opportunities, women are predominantly engaged in cropping (78%) and tending livestock \n(13%). The average income of women was only 60% that of men. Many men migrate to the \nRussian Federation for seasonal employment and repatriate income. These remittances are the \nlargest source of household income in the project area. \n \n61.  The Project will have indirect and direct benefits for women. Indirect benefits are mostly \nrelated to enhanced connectivity and include increased access to education and health facilities; \nincreased travel to towns; increased marketability of women\u2019s products (fruits and vegetables); \nincreased access to jobs (in local markets); and increased access to information. Women will \nbenefit from outside ideas as access to the rest of the country improves. A direct benefit is the \nadoption of an integrated and community-based approach to HIV/AIDS and migration (paras. \n32\u201333), targeting local communities and high-risk groups.  \n \nF.  Resettlement Effects \n \n62.  All the civil works activities will take place either within the existing right-of-way or on \nunused  state-owned  land.  No  relocation  of  households  or  acquisition  of  productive  land  is \nexpected. If the Project needs new borrow pits or quarries, they are expected to be located on \nunused state-owned land. The Project will directly affect 10 households at most in Garm and \nYangolik village. Of the 10 households, 2 are headed by females. The income per capita per year \nof the 10 households is less than TJS500, with 80% of their income coming from agriculture. One \nsmall shop partly located on the right-of-way will be affected, with its entrance moved by 2 meters \nfrom the right-of-way. An SRP was formulated in accordance with the laws and regulations of \nTajikistan,  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995).  The  resettlement  strategy, ", "  21\ncompensation standards, entitlements, and rehabilitation plans were based on impact surveys and \nconsultations with local officials and affected households. Considering that the impact on towns \nand villages will be minimal and most of the affected persons have larger incomes than average, \nthe  SRP will be implemented smoothly.  Demolition of structures on  the  right-of-way  will be \ncompleted  within  2006,  and  compensation  will  be  paid  before  the  civil  works  start.  Special \nattention will be paid to the two female-headed households and the small-shop owner to prevent \ntheir marginalization or impoverishment. A summary of the SRP is in Appendix 13. \n \nG.  Risks \n \n63.  The  Project  has  been  designed  to  reduce  potential  risks,  which  include  delays  in \nimplementation  because  of  inadequate  implementation  capacity  of  MOT,  failure  to  provide \ncounterpart  financing  on  time,  the  traffic  forecast  not  being  realized,  inadequate  road \nmaintenance,  and  lack  of  security  in  the  project  area.  The  Project  includes  a  number  of \nmeasures to mitigate the risk of delays. The existing PIU will implement the Project and has \nidentified the number and type of additional staff members needed. Advance action has been \napproved, and the PIU is now familiar with ADB procedures and will be able to make full use of \nthe advance action provisions. The Government has been made aware of ADB\u2019s emphasis on \nthe timely provision of counterpart funds, and has assured the project processing missions that \nit can provide the necessary funds for all ongoing ADB-financed road projects on time. Project \ndisbursements  will  be  within  the  Public  Investment  Program  restrictions  agreed  to  by  the \nGovernment and the International Monetary Fund.  \n \n64.  There is some risk that the traffic forecast will not materialize, especially the generated \ntraffic  arising  from  increased  international  trade.  This  risk  has  been  mitigated  by  using \nconservative assumptions to estimate benefits from international generated traffic, as only the \nbenefits from increased trade of three pairs of regional trading partners and additional traffic \narising from improved access to ports has been included. There is also a risk that the project \nroads will not be properly maintained and thus the full benefits of the Project will not be realized. \nThe Government is aware of the importance of road maintenance, particularly in the project \narea, which is mountainous and prone to landslides and rock falls. The project design includes \nelements  to  address  the  risks  of  inadequate  financing  and  the  implementation  of  road \nmaintenance for the project roads. The Government has agreed to loan assurances requiring \nthe allocation of specific levels of financing for maintaining the project roads, in addition to the \nassurances  regarding  levels  of  financing  for  road  maintenance  nationwide.  The  additional \nmaintenance costs amount to less than 2.0% of MOT\u2019s budget for road maintenance and \nrehabilitation, and will be sustainable. The Project includes procurement of road maintenance \nequipment, which will be used solely on the project roads. A sensitivity analysis indicates that \nthe Project remains economically feasible, with an EIRR of 13.2%, even with only 50.0% of the \nrequired maintenance provided. The project area is part of an area placed under a United \nNations security restriction following the civil war. However, the security status was upgraded in \nlate 2002, and again in September 2005. It is expected to remain in the upgraded condition.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n65.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  MOT  have  given  the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n ", " 22 \n(i)  Counterpart Funding. The Government will provide, on a timely basis, all funds \nand resources necessary for rehabilitation, operation, and maintenance of the \nDushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz border road in accordance with the financing plan agreed for \nthe Project. The Government will ensure that MOF takes all necessary measures \nto enable MOT to implement the Project successfully and operate and maintain \nthe project road after completion. Before the end of each year the Government \nwill  demonstrate  availability  of  funds  necessary  for  the  Project  in  a  public \ninvestment program for the succeeding year. \n \n(ii)  Maintenance Financing \n \n(a)  The  Government  will  allocate  and  make  available  on  a  timely  basis \nsufficient  funds  to  maintain  the  Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz  border  road.  The \nGovernment will allocate at least $90,000 per year (plus inflation since \n2005) to maintain the project road upon completion. The Government will \nalso ensure adequate maintenance of the Project\u2019s rural roads. \n \n(b)  The Government will ensure that actual expenditures on maintenance \n(including  emergency  maintenance,  but  excluding  rehabilitation  and \nconstruction) for roads under MOT jurisdiction will be increased at the \nsame rate as increases of the national budget during 2008\u20132009. \n \n(c)  The Government will ensure that (1) detailed actual road maintenance \nexpenditures are included in every other quarterly progress report to be \nsubmitted  by  MOT  to  ADB,  (2)  independent  auditors  audit  such \nexpenditures annually in accordance with appropriate standards, and (3) \nsuch audited reports are submitted to ADB within 9 months of the end of \nthe year. \n \n(iii)  Road Maintenance Tenders. The Government will ensure that two pilot cases of \nconducting maintenance of completed sections of the Dushanbe\u2013Kulyab road \nrehabilitated under the Road Rehabilitation Project (footnote 13) are carried out \nby  31  December  2007  and  31  December  2008  (in  succession)  using  a \ncompetitive  tendering  process  open  to  public  and  private  sector  entities  in \nTajikistan. \n \n(iv)  Vehicle Weighing \n \n(a)  Prior to 31 December 2006, the Government will approve new legislation \nand/or issue decrees regarding regulations and procedures for vehicle \nweighing, in particular, specifying the maximum permissible vehicle axle \nloads, and requiring offloading of excess weight from vehicles exceeding \nthe specified limits. \n \n(b)  MOT  will  install  and  make  fully  operational  static  vehicle  weighing \nsystems, according to legislation and national standards, for the sections \nof the national highway rehabilitated under (1) the Road Rehabilitation \nProject (footnote 13) by 30 June 2007; (2) the Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz Border \nRoad Rehabilitation Project (Phase I) (footnote 2) by the time of the \nhandover of the road by the contractor; and (3) the Project by the time of \nthe handover of the road by the contractor. ", "  23\n \n(v)  MOT Institutional Development \n \n(a)  MOT will make (1) the Road Planning and Assessment Unit under the \nRoad Department, and (2) the Economic Policy Division, fully operational \nby 31 December 2006, including staffing of all authorized positions and \nproviding adequate office facilities and sufficient number of computers.  \n \n(b)  MOT will reach an agreement with the Tajikistan Transport Institute by 31 \nDecember 2006 on a plan for implementing training programs for MOT \nstaff. \n \n(vi)  Construction Quality. MOT will (a) rehabilitate the project road per the design \ntechnical specifications; and (b) perform construction supervision, quality control, \nand contract management in accordance with internationally accepted standards. \n \n(vii)  Road Safety \n \n(a)  MOT will ensure adequate safety measures during and after the Project, \nsuch as pavement markings, warning signs, traffic signs and signals, \ncommunications facilities, hazard barriers, and traffic monitoring facilities.  \n \n(b)  MOT will strengthen the existing TSSU, through incorporating RSA in the \ndesign stage of all road projects, staffing all authorized positions, and \nproviding adequate office facilities and sufficient number of computers by \n31 December 2006. \n \n(viii)  Anticorruption Measures. Tajikistan will (1) undertake necessary measures to \ncreate  and  sustain  a  corruption-free  environment,  and  (2)  ensure  that  its \nanticorruption laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy are strictly \nenforced and are being complied with during project implementation. \n \n(ix)  Environment. MOT will ensure that project contractors implement social and \nenvironmental impact management in compliance with applicable environmental \nlaws  and  regulations,  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  and  per \nrecommendations of the IEE, and will translate the environmental management \nplan of the IEE into a contract-specific environmental management plan. MOT \nwill  submit  an  annual  report  on  environmental  performance  during  project \nimplementation. \n \n(x)  Land Acquisition and Resettlement. MOT will ensure that land acquisition and \nresettlement are carried out promptly and efficiently following the resettlement \nplan  agreed  with  ADB,  in  line  with  applicable  laws  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nInvoluntary Resettlement (1995).

The road subsector is the most important component of domestic transport in Tajikistan. \nThe road network is discussed in the main text. \n \nB.  Road Administration \n \n2.  Prior to the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) involvement with Tajikistan\u2019s transport \nsector, the Transport Department under the Office of the President acted as the central point of \ncoordination  for  the  transport  sector.  Development  planning  for  the  subsectors  was  the \nresponsibility  of  separate  government  organizations.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Roads \nserved as the national agency for road infrastructure management. It managed road transport \nenterprises, allocated budgets, assigned work, and managed personnel. The Tajik Railway \nCompany served as the agency for railways, while the Tajikistan State Air Company served as \nthe agency for civil aviation and airports. Each organization was responsible for preparing \ndevelopment plans and investment programs for its own subsector. During the implementation \nof the development plans, the Office of the President provided coordination for review and \nrevision  of  the  investment  programs  and  for  allocation  of  investment  funds  among  the \nsubsectors.  \n \n3.  As a result of policy dialogue with and technical assistance from ADB, the administration \nof the transport sector was reorganized and the Ministry of Transport (MOT) was created. MOT, \nwhich  now  regulates  Tajikistan  Railway  (Tajik  Rail)  and  Tajikistan  Airlines  (Tajik  Air),  is \nresponsible  for  planning  and  coordinating  all  modes  of  transport  within  the  country.  The \nGovernment is committed to develop a transport sector that meets the needs of a market-based \neconomy. The reorganized MOT reflects a policy of promoting competition, increasing the \nprivate sector's role, and enabling customers to make informed decisions. In the future, most \nstate-owned enterprises will play a minor role and will be expected to operate as independent \ncommercial enterprises.  \n \n4.  Separate deputy ministers are responsible for rail transport and air transport. These are \nregulatory and oversight responsibilities only and the line functions remain with Tajik Rail and \nTajik  Air.  MOT\u2019s  Roads  Department  is  responsible  for  administration,  maintenance,  and \nconstruction of roads in Tajikistan, and has a number of associated entities. For example, \nTajikgiprotransstroy (the Design Institute, a joint stock company) is responsible for surveys, \ntesting of materials, design of maintenance, and new construction in the subsector. \n \nC.  Road Standards and Safety \n \n5.  Tajikistan\u2019s road standards and specifications are based on those of the former Soviet \nUnion (FSU). Several studies have indicated that the design standards of FSU state roads \nimplemented in national roads in Tajikistan are sometimes higher than those of the United \nStates or European countries. However, they do not always result in optimum road design. For \nlower-standard roads, FSU standards for design speed and cross sections are similar to those \nused in developing countries, but for higher-category roads, they are excessive. The quality of \nconstruction of Tajikistan\u2019s roads is generally inadequate, mainly because of a lack of cost-\neffective construction techniques and independent construction supervision. Road safety is \ndiscussed in the main text. \n ", "  Appendix 2  29 \n \nD.  Road Transport Industry \n \n6.  Major  changes  have  occurred  in  the  road  transport  industry  since  independence, \nespecially in the commercialization, and in some cases privatization, of the industry. In 1998, \nthe Government had jurisdiction over 81 road transport service enterprises. Most intercity bus \nand trucking operations are now organized as joint stock companies, with various shares of \npublic and private ownership. For example, of the 52 medium and large transport organizations \nthat were formerly part of MOT and designated by the Government for privatization, 73% are \nwholly owned by the Government, 6% are wholly privately owned, and 21% have mixed public-\nprivate ownership. As of March 2002, 5,226 vehicles were operated by joint stock companies \nand other organizations within MOT. Of these, 3,627 vehicles or 69% were operated by four \njoint stock companies (Badakshonnakliyot, Khatlontrans, Khudjandnaklyot, and Kulyabtrans). \nThe remaining vehicles were operated by other MOT departments, Tajik Air, and Tajik Rail. A \nsignificant portion of trucking and most long-distance bus services are operated by private \ncompanies.  Tariffs  for  road  freight  have  been  completely  deregulated;  road  haulage \norganizations enter into agreements with customers at negotiated rates. Tariffs for passenger \ntransport  are  still  regulated.  MOT  and  the  Ministry  of  Economy  jointly  establish  tariffs  for \npassenger transport for buses, minibuses, and taxis for urban and long-distance services. While \nthese official tariffs should be charged by all operators, many bus and minibus operators charge \nmarket fares, according to what they think people will pay, and do not follow the official tariff. \n \nE.  Road Subsector Revenue and Expenditure \n \n7.  The state budget allocation for road rehabilitation and maintenance varies from year to \nyear  according  to  the  Government's  priorities  and  fiscal  constraints.  Prior  to  2000,  road \nsubsector expenditures were financed from the Road Fund, the state budget, and development \nagencies. The Road Fund had four main sources: (i) road-user and other taxes, such as excise \ntaxes on purchases of vehicles and parts, tires, fuel, and lubricants; and also including a 2.5% \ntax on transactions by all companies that is generally not considered a road-user tax; (ii) \ncharges on international transit shipments; (iii) vehicle inspection fees and registration fees; and \n(iv) contributions from local governments. In practice, only half of the Road Fund collection was \nallocated  to  road  rehabilitation  and  maintenance;  the  other  half  was  used  to  fund  new \nconstruction.  As  a  result  of  general  fiscal  constraints  and  allocations  to  new  construction, \nexpenditures on road maintenance and rehabilitation have been much lower than what was \nneeded  to  maintain  the  road  network  at  an  acceptable  level.  In  2000,  the  Government \nterminated the Road Fund to meet the International Monetary Fund requirement to maintain one \nconsolidated state budget.1 The taxes and receipts formerly contributing to the Road Fund are \nstill  collected,  but  now  are  paid  directly  to  the  national  treasury.  Road  maintenance  and \nconstruction are now funded from the general state budget. The following amounts have been \nallocated  to  the  road  subsector  in  the  national  budget  for  2005:  TJS18.1  million  for \nmaintenance, TJS18.7 million for new construction (of which TJS12.2 million is for the Anzob \nTunnel),  and  TJS4.3  million  for  rehabilitation,  for  a  total  of  TJS41.1  million.  These  are \napproximately equivalent to the following amounts: $5.7 million for maintenance, $5.9 million for \nnew construction, and $1.4 million for rehabilitation, for a total of $13.0 million. Details on the \ncurrent status of road subsector financing are discussed in the main text. \n \n                                                 \n1  The Road Fund was a first-generation fund, and did not include features such as administration by an independent \nboard found in second-generation funds. (ADB. 2003. Road Funds and Road Maintenance: An Asian Perspective. \nManila.) ", "30   Appendix 2 \n \nF.  Road Maintenance \n \n8.  MOT is responsible for planning and coordinating the maintenance of Tajikistan's road \nnetwork.  MOT  maintains  roads  and  bridges  through  five  regional  road  departments: \nBadakhshan, Dushanbe, Khatlon and Kulyab (combined in 2005), Khudjand, and Rasht. These \nroad  maintenance  departments  are  responsible  for  approximately  13,800  km  of  road,  and \nemploy 2,981 people. The departments are state entities attached to MOT and are composed of \nroad maintenance units (RMUs). None of the departments or RMUs has been privatized. While \nit is the stated intention of MOT to eventually privatize them, no progress has been made to \ndate. The road maintenance departments prepare annual plans and budgets based on systems \nestablished during the Soviet era. This information is then presented to MOT, which in turn \nallocates funding to the various departments. The RMUs are responsible for the part of the road \nnetwork within their jurisdiction, with the actual maintenance being carried out by staff who are \nresponsible for specific sections of the road. However, the plant, equipment, and materials \navailable to the workforce are generally not sufficient for carrying out effective maintenance \nactivities. The Rasht Road Department and the Dushanbe Road Department are responsible for \nmaintenance of roads in the Regions of Republican Subordination. The Rasht Road Department \nis responsible for maintenance of the road to be improved under the Project. The Rasht Road \nDepartment is responsible for maintaining 885 km of roads, is composed of 9 RMUs, and \nemploys 237 people. The Dushanbe Road Department is responsible for maintenance of the \nroad sections being rehabilitated under the first phase. \n \nG.  Policy Dialogue for the Transport Sector \n \n9.  Market-oriented  reforms  for  the  transport  sector  are  now  being  introduced  through \nimplementation of the ADB-financed Road Rehabilitation Project,2 the completed Postconflict \nInfrastructure Program,3 the Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz Border Road Rehabilitation Project (Phase I), \nand several related advisory technical assistance activities.4 The status and achievements of \nADB\u2019s policy dialogue to date are summarized in the Transport Sector Policy Reform Plan \n(Table A2). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2000.

", "34  Appendix 4 \nHIV/AIDS AND MIGRATION COMPONENT \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  Tajikistan  is  at  an  early  stage  of  an  HIV/AIDS1  epidemic.  The  number  of  officially \nregistered HIV cases remains low, with 385 cases (321 males, 64 females), mostly under 30 \n(127 males, 38 females) and under 40 years of age (140 males, 17 females) as of May 2005.2 \nThe methods of HIV transmission among registered cases include injected drug use (59.7%), \nsexual transmission (8%), and unknown (30.9%). However, these data may not accurately \nreflect the real situation. Diagnostic capacity is low and the social stigma and discrimination \nassociated with infection mean few of those who are most at risk are tested. The real number of \nHIV infections may be 10\u201320 times higher. \n \n2.  Economic stagnation and lack of employment opportunities during and after Tajikistan\u2019s \ncivil war in the 1990s have resulted in a rapid rise in cross-border seasonal migration. About \n600,000 people (or 10% of the population) leave each year, mostly to the Russian Federation, in \nsearch  of  informal  income  opportunities.  According  to  the  International  Organization  for \nMigration (IOM), initial migration patterns involved mostly unskilled young males (ages 20\u201329), \nthough most recent trends suggest increasing migration of older males (ages 40\u201349). The \nproject area in the Rasht Valley is known as a traditional source of migrants. Migrant workers \nare a high risk category for contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), \nhaving typically two to three sexual partners over the course of an 8- or 9-month work season \nabroad.3 Younger male migrants use commercial sex workers more frequently than older men \nand, considering the high prevalence of HIV infections in the Russian Federation, a majority of \nthese migrants are at very high risk of passing STIs to their sexual partners at home. \n \n3.  Limited understanding of contraception and strong feelings against the use of condoms \namong men are reflected in the poor understanding of sexual behavior, or the unwillingness to \nchange it. In 2003, only 2% of women between ages 15 and 49 reported using condoms,4 which \nare associated with sex workers and sex outside marriage. These issues are rarely discussed in \npublic, and there is widespread belief that HIV and other STIs are diseases that only prostitutes \nand the dissolute can contract. These attitudes make it difficult for wives to raise the subject of \nthe need for protection against STIs with their returning husbands, especially in more traditional \ncommunities. There is also a profound stigma against those who are infected, discouraging \ntesting and open discussion of HIV and other STIs. Most Tajik labor migrants have irregular \nstatus in their countries of destination. The health of migrants in an irregular situation can be at \nrisk due to poverty, discrimination, vulnerability to labor exploitation, separation from families \nand  partners,  separation  from  the  sociocultural  norms  that  guide  behavior  in  stable \ncommunities, and, often, lack of access to health care and social services. \n \n4.  Tajikistan is also a country of origin for trafficked persons, mostly women. Two types of \ntrafficking prevail, both of which are increasing rapidly: labor exploitation, e.g., sweatshops in \nthe  Russian  Federation,  and  trafficking  in  women  and  children  for sexual  exploitation  and \ndomestic servitude, mostly to the Middle East. According to data received from the Ministry of \nInterior (2005) more than 58 trafficking cases were registered between January 2004 and March \n2005. Many Tajik women transit through Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and the Kyrgyz Republic to \ntravel to the Middle East or the Russian Federation. Recent evidence from IOM\u2019s work with \n                                                 \n1  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.  \n2  The breakdown of HIV incidence by region accounts for: 168 (Sughd), 104 (Dushanbe), 57 (Gorno Badakhshan), \n48 (Khatlon), and 8 (Regions of Republican Subordination). \n3  IOM and Sharq Scientific Research Center. 2003.

The HIV/AIDS and migration component is designed to mitigate the risks of HIV and \nSTIs\u2014in a context characterized by cross-border seasonal migration and human trafficking\u2014\nduring and after the implementation of the proposed Project. This will be done by supporting \nlocal governments, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and communities to develop and \nimplement an integrated and gender-responsive approach to HIV/AIDS and STI prevention in \nthe construction campsites and corridor of influence. The project area covers three districts in \nthe Regions of Republican Subordination (Nurobod, Rasht, and Tajikabad) with 26 jamoats (or \nvillages) and a population of about 180,000. It includes Karamik, the 12-km section at the Tajik\u2013\nKyrgyz border. The project area in the Rasht Valley is characterized by a combination of \ngender-relevant  factors,  which  have  to  be  considered in  the  design  of  HIV/STI  prevention \nprograms.  These  include  traditional  rural  societies,  seasonal  male  labor  migration  to  the \nRussian Federation, conservative religious beliefs and associated gender-based practices, a \nhigh  percentage  of  female-headed  households  (including  war  widows),  women\u2019s  lack  of \nemployable skills, increasing drug trafficking and consumption patterns, and HIV/AIDS and STI \nstigmas and discrimination. \n \nC.  Project Subcomponents \n \n6.  Baseline information data on HIV/AIDS, migration, and human trafficking patterns in the \nproject area, including a list of local government and NGO stakeholders, will be gathered based \non existing quantitative and qualitative data.5 \n \n7.  Subcomponent  1:  Capacity  Development  for  Local  Government  Agencies  and \nNGOs. This subcomponent will consist of training local government authorities (Departments of \nHealth,  Education,  Labor  and  Social  Protection,  Statistics  Committees,  and  Women\u2019s \nCommittees)  and  enforcement  agencies  (police  and  border  guards)  in  the  project  area  in \neffectively implementing the Government\u2019s policies, strategies, and regulations in the prevention \nof HIV/AIDS and other STIs, anti-trafficking, and the regulation of migration in the project area. \nThe training module will be developed by an international organization and will build upon the \ndemonstrated success of approaches in the project area. Training of selected local NGOs will \nbe based on their involvement in and/or potential to increase the outreach and impact of \nHIV/AIDS prevention, anti-trafficking, and regulation of migration in the project area. The training \nmodule will be developed by the international organization and relevant government agencies. It \nwill provide (i) technical skills (social, gender, and medical and psychological expertise related \nto HIV/AIDS, human trafficking, and migration); (ii) administrative, financial, and management \nskills; (iii) proposal writing skills, to ensure quality proposals and sustainable access to donor \nfunding; and (iv) development of behavior change communication (BCC) strategy and materials \nfor local communities. Upon successful completion of the training, local NGOs will be involved in \nthe implementation of the BCC initiatives. \n \n8.  Subcomponent 2: Behavior Change and Communication for Local Communities \nand High-risk Groups. In the context of an AIDS epidemic, BCC is an essential part of a \ncomprehensive program that includes services (medical, social, psychological, and spiritual) \nand commodities (e.g., condoms, needles, and syringes). This subcomponent aims to reduce \n                                                 \n5  At this stage, the feasibility of carrying out a baseline survey in the project area is uncertain. It will be further \nassessed by the National HIV/AIDS Center and the selected international organization during project inception. ", "36  Appendix 4 \nrisk  levels  among  individuals  and  communities  along  the  road  corridor  and  establish  an \nenvironment conducive to safe sexual practices. BCC activities will be based on research \namong  target  groups  to  assess  the  determinants  of  their  sexual  and  reproductive  health \nbehavior. The target groups include (i) seasonal migrants; (ii) women; (iii) intravenous drug \nusers;  (iv)  sex  workers;  and  (v)  transport  companies,  local  business  owners,  and  road \nconstruction companies and workers. For seasonal migrants, culturally sensitive initiatives will \nbe  developed  in  consultation  with  families  of  migrants  and  community  leaders  to  devise \nsustainable modalities for the prevention of HIV/AIDS and other STIs. Activities for women will \naddress their greater exposure to the risks and impact of HIV and other STIs. In light of the \nsensitivity related to discussions on gender, sex and sexuality, risk behaviors, and cultural \npractices that may increase the likelihood of STIs, BCC will include food nutrition, hygiene, \nsanitation,  sexual  and  reproductive  health,  and  family  planning.  BCC  campaigns  will  be \ndeveloped  by  the  international/local  NGOs  under  the  national  policies  and  frameworks,  in \nconsultation with district- and village-level government agencies and community leaders. \n \n9.  Subcomponent 3: Clinical Support. HIV testing kits and STI treatment packages will \nbe provided to health clinics to help meet the incremental needs of mobile populations and local \ncommunities.  These  will  also  complement  existing  programs  supported  by  the  National \nHIV/AIDS Center, United Nations agencies, and other donors. Condoms will be made available \nfree of charge to construction workers, local communities, and target and high-risk groups for \nabout 2.5 years. A limited number of condoms will be distributed during the first year of road \nrehabilitation as part of marketing efforts. The component will closely consult with the National \nHIV/AIDS Center and the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund) on \nsustainable  condom  distribution  during  road  rehabilitation.  Training  to  health  workers  and \nlaboratory technicians will be provided under the aegis of the National HIV/AIDS Center and \ninvolve  (i)  training,  consultation,  and  operational  support  to  health  workers  for  clinical \nmanagement of STIs as well as voluntary counseling and testing; and (ii) training for laboratory \ntechnicians on epidemiological surveillance and laboratory diagnosis. Training activities will be \nfurther defined by the National HIV/AIDS Center based on the specific needs and constraints \nfaced by health workers and laboratory technicians at the rapid testing centers in Rogun and \nGarm, and at the Trust Center for Migrants in Garm. Clinical support activities will complement \nthe Global Fund's efforts to strengthen HIV/AIDS diagnostic infrastructure. \n \n10.  The HIV/AIDS and migration component has been designed in consultation with the \nMinistry of Health\u2019s National HIV/AIDS Center to ensure consistency with the priority directions \non HIV/AIDS prevention set forth by the National Coordination Committee (2000). These priority \ndirections  were  further  defined  in  the  National  Strategic  Plan  to  respond  to  the  HIV/AIDS \nepidemic  (2002).  Discussions  with  UNAIDS6  and  the  Global  Fund  confirmed  the  lack  of \nsignificant  community-based  HIV/AIDS  and  STI  preventive  activities  in  the  project  area. \nConsultations  with  UNDP,  UNIFEM,  IOM,  the  Open  Society  Institute,  the  Aga  Khan \nDevelopment Network, and CARE provided valuable insights into lessons learned in the design \nand implementation of the HIV/AIDS and STI prevention program in Tajikistan. These lessons \nwere incorporated in the design of the component. \n \nD.  Cost Estimate \n \n11.  The  total  estimated  cost  is  $600,000,  which  includes  consulting  services;  training; \nseminars  and  conferences;  acquisition  of  HIV  testing  kits,  STI  treatment  packages,  and \ncondoms; and miscellaneous administrative and support costs. \n                                                 \n6  Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. ", "Appendix 4    37\n \nE.  Implementation Arrangement \n \n12.  The Ministry of Health, through its National HIV/AIDS Center, will be the Executing \nAgency  for  the  component.  The  Ministry  of  Health  will  engage  a  qualified  international \norganization (which could be an international NGO, consulting firm, or other entity) to manage \nand coordinate the implementation of the component. The international organization, which may \nassociate with local consultants or NGOs, will be recruited by quality- and cost-based selection \nusing  simplified  technical  proposals,  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory for the engagement of domestic consultants. \nThe international organization will consult with the National HIV/AIDS Center on the design of \nthe capacity development activities for local government agencies and NGOs (subcomponent \n1), and involve local government agencies and NGOs in the implementation of BCC initiatives \n(subcomponent 2). It will work with the National HIV/AIDS Center in the identification of training \nneeds, selection of consultants, preparation of training materials, and procurement of equipment \nand supplies for STI treatment and voluntary counseling and testing (subcomponent 3). The \nterms of reference for the international organization is in (supplementary Appendix D). \n \n13.  At the central level, the international organization will be responsible for organizing \nquarterly meetings of a steering committee in Dushanbe, chaired by the Director of the National \nHIV/AIDS Center, and including representatives from the Ministry of Transport (MOT) or project \nimplementation unit (PIU), the Committee on Women and Family Affairs, government agencies \ninvolved in anti-trafficking and regulation of migration, and relevant international organizations \nand local NGOs. At the district level, it will be responsible for organizing quarterly meetings of \nan  advisory  working  group,  chaired  by  the  Department  of  Health,  and  including  local \ngovernment representatives, local representatives of the Committee on Women and Family \nAffairs, community leaders (jamoat7 level), the UNDP office in Garm, international organizations, \nand local NGOs. The steering committee and advisory working group will provide guidance on \nthe implementation of the component. They will establish a forum for technical discussions and \nupdates on ongoing government- and/or donor-funded programs, which may inform and/or \ncontribute to orienting the focus of the proposed interventions. \n \nF.  Monitoring and Reporting \n \n14.  The National HIV/AIDS Center is in the process of finalizing national indicators for \nmonitoring and evaluating HIV/AIDS prevention programs. The following output indicators may \nbe  adopted,  as  needed,  during  project  inception  to  ensure  consistency  with  the  national \nindicators:8 (i) number of government agencies and local NGOs trained in the project area; (ii) \nnumber of BCC initiatives carried out and target high-risk groups reached; (iii) number of labor \nskills transfer initiatives for women that have been carried out, and target groups reached; (iv) \nnumber of HIV testing kits, STI treatment packages, and condoms distributed; (v) percentage of \npeople seeking information on HIV/AIDS testing and counseling; (vi) percentage of people being \ntested for HIV; and (vii) number of STI patients seeking care and treatment. \n \n15.  The international organization will submit a detailed work program 1 month after the \ncontract has been signed, and submit quarterly and annual reports to the National HIV/AIDS \nCenter for transmission to the MOT/PIU and ADB. The international organization will conduct \nmidterm and completion reviews and evaluations of the implementation of the component, after \n1 year and completion of implementation, respectively. \n                                                 \n7  Traditional local community unit in villages. \n8  At this stage, the feasibility of setting and monitoring impact indicators is uncertain.

Existing Traffic \n \n1.  Seasonally adjusted base year (2005) traffic counts were conducted by the consultants \nduring the project preparatory technical assistance1 and used in the traffic forecast analysis and \neconomic assessments for each section of the project road. Existing data on historical traffic \ncounts by the Ministry of Transport were also reviewed to determine appropriate base year \ntraffic. \n \n2.  The dissolution of the former Soviet Union and the outbreak of civil war caused a \ndramatic reduction in traffic on the Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz border road. Since 1995, however, traffic \nlevels have been slowly increasing. At present, average traffic volume on representative project \nroad sections is 560 vehicles per day on the section south of Garm, 946 on the section in the \nGarm area with its higher levels of local traffic, 413 on the section north of Garm, and only 21 on \nthe section at the Tajik\u2013Kyrgyz border.  \n \nB.  Traffic Forecast \n \n3.  Forecasts by traffic and vehicle type were prepared for the project road sections for \n2006\u20132029. The forecasts are based on expected growth in gross domestic product (GDP) in \nTajikistan and international trade in the region and on income elasticities of demand. The traffic \nforecast for representative sections of the project road is summarized in Table A9. Total traffic is \nforecast  to  grow  at  annual  rates  of  11.5\u201315.8%  during  2006\u20132015  (the  years  during  and \nimmediately following project implementation), except for the border section, which has higher \ngrowth. The higher growth rates during these years are due in large part to the high growth of \ninternational traffic (para 5). Total traffic is forecast to grow at annual rates of about 6.0% during \n2016\u20132029. \n \n4.  Based on forecast GDP growth and income elasticities of demand over the total project \nperiod,  average  annual  traffic  growth  rates  for  normal  and  domestic  generated  traffic  are \nestimated at 6.9\u20137.2% during 2006\u20132010, 6.0\u20136.5% during 2011\u20132015, and 5.9\u20136.2% from \n2016 onwards (except for the border section, which has higher growth during 2006\u20132015).2 The \nhigher growth rates during 2006\u20132015 are due to the completion of the rehabilitation of the first \nphase at the end of 2007 and the completion of the Project in 2009. Domestic generated traffic \narises from increased passenger traffic to Dushanbe and increased transport of fruit from the \nproject area to Dushanbe. The improved road conditions will generate demand through lower \nfares arising from lower vehicle operating costs, and as a result of less damage to the fruit \nduring shipment. \n \n5.  International generated traffic is forecast based on an analysis of trade patterns in the \nregion  and  potential  trade  from  improved  access  to  ports.  The  analysis  of  trade  patterns \nexamined  three  pairs  of  trading  partners:  Tajikistan\u2013Kyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan\u2013People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), and PRC\u2013Afghanistan. Improvement of the regional road network, on \nwhich the project road sections presently constitute a major bottleneck, will provide a much \nmore direct and efficient transport route for trade of these country pairs and will greatly facilitate \ntrade. For Tajikistan and Afghanistan, both of which are landlocked countries, the project road is \nthe most direct route to the PRC, in particular the PRC\u2019s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

Manila. \n2  Real GDP in Tajikistan grew, on average, at more than 10% per year during 2001\u20132004, ADB estimates that GDP \ngrowth will slow down to 8% by 2005 and 6% by 2007. (ADB. 2005.

In addition, the city of Karshi in Xinjiang, is \nthe eastern terminus of railway lines to other points in the PRC.  \n \n6.  The increased trade is based on the assumption that the PRC\u2019s share of the total trade \nof Tajikistan and Afghanistan will increase from the current very low levels to levels approaching \nthose of the PRC\u2019s other trading partners in the region. Also, trade between Tajikistan and the \nKyrgyz Republic is forecast to increase with the removal of the obstruction to trade. The PRC\u2019s \nshare of trade with Tajikistan is estimated to increase from 1.9% to 20.0% (less than the PRC\u2019s \n23.0% share of trade with the Kyrgyz Republic) by 2014. It is assumed that 80% of PRC\u2013\nTajikistan trade will pass through the project road after project completion. The PRC\u2019s share of \ntrade with Afghanistan is estimated to increase from the current level of 0.1% to 10.0% by 2014. \nIt is assumed that 70% of PRC\u2013Tajikistan trade will pass through the project road after project \ncompletion. Additional traffic will be generated by the increased trade arising from improved \naccess  to  ports  in  Pakistan.  Conservative  assumptions  have  been  used  to  estimate  the \ninternational generated traffic. International generated traffic is forecast to increase at rates of \n43.1% during 2011\u20132015, and 5.9% from 2016 onwards. The high growth rate during 2011\u2013\n2015 is expected as the PRC\u2019s share of total trade for Tajikistan and Afghanistan increases to \nlevels in line with other countries in the region. \n \n7.  Normal traffic is expected to account for 46%\u201352% of total traffic on the project road in \n2029, except for the border section, on which it comprises only 6% of the traffic. Domestic \ngenerated traffic comprises a small portion of total traffic at 2% or less on the representative \nroad sections. International generated traffic comprises 34\u201353% of total traffic in 2029 except for \nthe border section, on which it comprises 94%. \n \nTable A9:  Actual and Projected Average Traffic Volume (2005\u20132029) \n(Vehicles per Day) \n \nRoad       \nSegment  Component  2005 2010 2015 2020  2025  2029\nSouth of  Normal  560 786 1,068 1,322  1,551  1,765\nGarm  Generated Domestic  0 28 38 46  54  61\n  Generated International  0 159 955 1,274  1,700  2,140\n    Total  560 973 2,061 2,642  3,305  3,966\nGarm Area  Normal  946 1,322 1,785 2,204  2,578  2,924\n  Generated Domestic  0 48 65 79  92  104\n  Generated International  0 159 955 1,274  1,700  2,140\n    Total  946 1,529 2,805 3,557  4,370  5,168\nNorth of  Normal  413 583 801 997  1,177  1,346\nGarm  Generated Domestic  0 20 27 33  38  43\n  Generated International  0 159 955 1,274  1,700  2,140\n    Total  413 762 1,783 2,304  2,915  3,539\nBorder   Normal  21 36 63 84  113  142\nSection  Generated Kyrgyz Traffic  0 1 2 3  4  4\n  Generated China Traffic  0 159 955 1,274  1,700  2,140\n    21 196 1,020 1,361  1,817  2,286\nSource: Asian Development Bank and technical assistance consultants estimates. \n \n \n ", "44  Appendix 10 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \nA.  General \n \n1.  The  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  for  the  Project,  including  rural  roads,  by \ncomparing the with- and without-project scenarios. In the without-project scenario, the road is \nassumed to receive only minimal maintenance and will continue to deteriorate. The with-project \nscenario includes routine and periodic maintenance according to international standards. The \nproject  preparatory  technical  assistance  considered  various  mutually  exclusive  project \nalternatives, and the proposed Project is based on the most cost effective and least cost option. \nThe economic analysis covers 23 years (2007\u20132029), based on a 3-year implementation period. \nAll benefits and costs are in constant 2005 prices. The economic prices are expressed using the \nworld price numeraire. \n \nB.  Costs \n \n2.  Project  economic  costs  include  the  resource  costs  of  road  improvement  and \nmaintenance (including rural roads), equipment, and consulting services. Price contingencies, \ninterest  during  construction,  and  taxes  and  duties  are  excluded.  Costs  were  divided  into \ntradable and non-tradable portions. A standard conversion factor of 0.9 was applied to the non-\ntradable portion. To take into account local unemployment and underemployment, costs for \nunskilled labor were adjusted by a shadow wage rate factor of 0.75 to arrive at the economic \nopportunity cost. \n \nC.  Benefits \n \n3.  The primary economic benefits for the Project are vehicle operating cost (VOC) savings \nfor normal traffic, domestic and international generated traffic, and benefits to rural roads. \nEconomic benefits were calculated using the same methodology used for costs. VOC savings \nwill accrue primarily from improvements in the road surface, horizontal and vertical alignment, \nand increased average speed on some sections. Unit economic VOCs for six types of vehicles \nwere estimated using the Highway Design and Maintenance Standards Model-IV, and are \nshown in Table A10.1. VOC savings for normal traffic account for about 58% of total benefits \nwhile benefits from international generated traffic account for about 37%. Benefits for generated \ntraffic are estimated at half the value of VOC savings for normal traffic. \n \nTable A10.1: Representative Vehicle Operating Costs by Vehicle Type \n($ per '000 vehicle-km)  \n \n Item  Without Project  With Project  VOC Savings \nNorth of Garm       \nCar  132.94  118.82  14.12 \n4WD  128.24  109.41  18.83 \nMini Bus  216.47  176.47  40.00 \n2 Axle Truck  334.12  294.12  40.00 \n3 Axle Truck  454.12  412.94  41.18 \nSouth of Garm       \nCar  178.26  117.39  60.87 \n4WD  178.26  108.70  69.56 \nMini Bus  313.04  173.91  139.13 \n2 Axle Truck  430.43  295.65  134.78 \n3 Axle Truck   586.96  413.04  173.92 \n4WD=four-wheel drive, km=kilometer, VOC=vehicle operating costs.   \nSource: Technical assistance consultants estimates. \n \n ", "Appendix 10  45\n4.  Domestic  generated  traffic  is  defined  as  new  traffic  induced  from  the  reduction  in \ntransport  costs  arising  from  the  Project.  International  generated  traffic  comprises  new \ninternational traffic arising from increased trade among countries in the region resulting from \nimprovement of the project road. The Project will also have other benefits, such as improved \naccess to social services and improved road safety, however, these have not been quantified \ndue to the lack of sufficient data. \n \nD.  Results of Economic Analysis \n \n5.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated for the Project including rural \nroads and all other components (Table A10.2).

Given the Asian Development Bank's \nexperience with similar projects in Tajikistan and other Central Asian republics, such changes \nare not expected to occur. The sensitivity analysis shows that the EIRR exceeds the level of \n12% in all cases. International generated traffic would have to decrease by 80% for the EIRR to \ndrop to 12%.

Distribution Analysis \n \n7.  Distribution analysis was carried out in order to examine the distribution of the Project\u2019s \nbenefits among countries in the region and to examine the Project\u2019s impact on beneficiaries in \nTajikistan,  using  the  same  EIRR  methodology  and  assumptions  for  discount  rate,  price \nnumeraire, constant price, and standard conversion factor adjustment. The project benefits are \ndistributed primarily among four countries. The distribution of benefits is shown in Table A10.4. \nTajikistan receives 76% of net benefits, and 24% of net benefits accrue to other countries in the \nregion. The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) receives 12% total net benefits; Afghanistan \nreceives 5%, the Kyrgyz Republic receives 6%, and other countries receive 1%. The analysis of \nregional benefits is based on estimates of increased trade of three pairs of regional trading \npartners, and on the increased trade arising from improved access to ports in Pakistan provided \nby the project road. Conservative assumptions were used in the analysis. Benefits to the Kyrgyz \nRepublic and Kazakhstan, in particular, may be underestimated. \n  \n8.  The project benefits accruing to Tajikistan are distributed among five national groups: (i) \nusers of freight transport, (ii) users of passenger transport, (iii) vehicle owners, (iv) labor, and (v) \nthe Government and economy of Tajikistan. Users of passenger and freight transport and the \nGovernment and economy each receive 22%\u201323% of total benefits. Due to the very competitive \nnature of the market for transport services, vehicle owners only retain about 5% of net benefits. \n \nG.  Financial Analysis \n \n9.  A financial analysis has been conducted to examine the impact of the Project on the \nfinancial status of the Ministry of Transport and the Government, particularly the financial impact \nof the maintenance and operational costs that will arise. The additional real maintenance costs \nof $90,000 per year represents less than 2.0% of the Ministry of Transport\u2019s budget for road \nrehabilitation and maintenance. The Ministry of Finance will be responsible for the debt service \npayments for the Project, and has confirmed that the Project is consistent with the Public \nInvestment Program agreed by the Government and the International Monetary Fund. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 10  47\n \n \nTable A10.4:   Distribution of Net Benefits \n($ million) \n \n        International    Tajikistan  Net  Net \n      EPV -                    Tajik  Total \nItem  FPV  EPV  FPV  KGZ  PRC  AFG  Other  PTU  FTU  TJO  LO  Eco  Benefits  Benefits \nBenefits                             \nNormal                             \nTraffic  19.36  19.36  8.71  8.71  1.94  19.36  19.36 \nDomestic                             \nGenerated  0.25  0.25  0.25  0.25  0.25 \nInt\u2019l                             \nGenerated  12.28  12.28  2.58  4.72  2.14  0.49  2.34  2.34  12.28 \nRural                             \nRoads  1.54  1.54  0.69  0.69  0.15  1.54  1.54 \nCosts                             \nInvest.                             \nand  (26.77)  (20.10)  6.67  6.67  6.67  6.67 \nmaint. \nLabor  (4.72)  (3.55)  1.18                1.18    1.18  1.18 \nNPV  (31.49)  9.79  41.28  2.58  4.72  2.14  0.49  9.41  9.41  2.09  1.18  9.26  31.34  41.28 \nAFG=Afghanistan; Eco=economy; EPV=economic present value; FPV=financial present value; FTU=freight transport users; \nInt\u2019l=international;  Invest=investment;  KGZ=Kyrgyz  Republic;  LO=labor;  maint.=maintenance;  NPV=net  present  value; \nPRC=People\u2019s Republic of China; PTU=passenger transport users; TJO=Tajikistan vehicle owners. \nSources:  Asian Development Bank and technical assistance consultants estimates. \n \n ", "48  Appendix 11 \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  This summary initial environmental examination (SIEE) report has been prepared to \nsummarize  the  potential  environmental  impacts  of  the  proposed  Project,  which  has  been \nclassified as Category B under the Asian Development Bank (ADB) categorization system. An \ninitial environmental examination (IEE) was prepared under the project preparatory technical \nassistance1  (TA)  in  accordance  with  the  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines (2003) of ADB. The IEE was prepared by the TA consultants and the \nMinistry  of  Transport  (MOT).  The  IEE  has  been  reviewed  by  the  State  Committee  for \nEnvironmental Protection and Forestry (SCEPF). \n \nB.  Description of the Project  \n \n2.  The proposed Project will consist of the rehabilitation of about 77 kilometers (km) of the \ncenter section of the Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz border road (km 140 to km 217), the 12-km section \nadjacent to the border, and 60 km of rural roads in the project area. The project road passes \nthrough  the  rayons  (regions)  of  Nurobod,  Rasht,  and  Dzhirgatal.  The  project activities  will \ncommence in 2007 and be completed by the end of June 2009. Average daily traffic on the \nsection south of Garm in 2005 is 560 vehicles, which will increase to 973 vehicles in 2010 and \n2,642 vehicles in 2020. The Project continues the scope of the Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz Border Road \nRehabilitation Project (Phase I),2 which is improving the first 140 km of the road. The Project is \nan integral part of a regional road network linking Afghanistan, Tajikistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, \nKazakhstan, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and Uzbekistan. \n \n3.  Project  activities  will  include  road  rehabilitation  (overlay,  resurfacing,  and \nreconstruction),  replacement  of  11  bridges,  repair  of  1  bridge,  and  construction  of  3  new \nbridges. Earthworks will be required in some areas to stabilize erosion, improve slope stability, \ninstall rock fall protection, improve drainage, and widen the road to improve forward sight \ndistance. The Project will require operation of a concrete batching plant and asphalt plant, \noperation  of  borrow  pits,  and  temporary  establishment  of  contractors\u2019  yards  and  material \nstorage  sites.  All  construction  activities  will  occur  within  the  existing  right-of-way,  with  the \nexception of (i) minor road realignments in mountainous areas (within unutilized government-\nowned land), and (ii) road widening (2\u20134 m) within two short sections through peri-urban areas.  \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n4.  Topography and Climate. The topography of the project alignment varies from flat, \nrolling terrain to mountainous. The major portion of the alignment passes along the valleys of \nthe Surkhob River and its tributaries. The southern section of the alignment has an altitude of \napproximately 1,200 meters (m) above sea level, rising to approximately 1,700 m above sea \nlevel in the north. The alignment is bound to the north, east, and west by mountain ranges, but \nis open to the south, toward Dushanbe. As it flows southwards, the Surkhob River becomes the \nVakhsh River, which feeds several large reservoirs and a number of large hydropower plants. \nThe climate of Tajikistan is arid continental, characterized by considerable seasonal and daily \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan and \nTechnical Assistance Grant to the Republic of Tajikistan for the Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz Border Road Rehabilitation \nProject (Phase I). Manila. ", "Appendix 11  49\n \nfluctuations of temperature, humidity, and precipitation. Local climatic conditions are heavily \ndependent on microclimates established by the numerous mountain ranges. The sections of the \nalignment which pass through the river valleys have mild summers and cold winters. Average \nannual rainfall along the alignment is 970 millimeters (mm) in Nurobod, 904 mm in Garm, and \n460 mm in the Laksh area. Average monthly temperatures range from 10\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C during \nsummer and \u20135\u00b0C to 2\u00b0C during winter. The average monthly snowfall in the region varies from \n30 mm to 310 mm between November and January. \n \n5.  Geology and Soils. The project corridor passes through geological zones of granitic \nbedrock  (exhibiting  northwest  to  southeast  striking  faults,  highly  weathered  in  places)  and \nsedimentary deposits of Paleozoic and Mesozoic age (highly jointed exposed faces susceptible \nto block failure). The soils along the alignment in the river valleys are mainly gray alluvial soils. \nThe soils outside the river valleys are generally residual or colluvial soils with relatively low \nfertility. There is a high percentage of rock outcrops in the more mountainous areas. Perched \nwater tables were observed in places at the soil rock interface with associated localized mud \nflows. Significant levels of soil erosion occur along the alignment. This is due to both natural \nconditions  (mountainous  terrain,  deeply  weathered  soil  profiles)  and  man-made  impacts \n(deforestation and overgrazing). Snow avalanches are common during winter. \n \n6.  Water Resources. The project alignment runs along the valley of the Surkhob River and \nits tributaries. Residential areas along the alignment use the surface water from the Surkhob \nRiver and its tributaries for irrigation, potable supplies, and some commercial usage. The water \nfrom  the  Surkhob  River  is  used  downstream  in  Tajikistan  and  Uzbekistan  for  hydropower \ngeneration, irrigation, industrial use, and potable water supply. Residents along the alignment \nalso use groundwater supplies for domestic purposes. The depth of groundwater is variable \ndepending on the terrain. There are some hot springs located along the alignment.  \n \n7.  Dust and Air Quality. During the dry autumn-summer period there are periodic dust \nstorms along the alignment. There are no atmospheric monitoring stations located along the \nalignment. However, due to lack of industrial development the air quality is anticipated to be \nrelatively good. \n \n8.  Flora and Fauna. Tajikistan hosts 5,000 plant species, 81 mammal species, over 365 \nbird species, and 49 reptile species. Two hundred twenty-six plant species are categorized in \nthe  Red  Book  of  Tajikistan  as  sensitive,  or  potentially  threatened  or  endangered.  Local \ngovernment officials have reported that there are no endangered species of flora and fauna \nlocated along the project corridor. There are no protected areas along the project corridor. \n \n9.  Economic  and  Cultural  Resources.  The  population  of  the  project  area  is  about \n180,000. The project area\u2019s poverty incidence was 68% in 2004. The economy along the project \nalignment is primarily based on agriculture, including grains, potatoes, vegetables, fruits, fur, \nmeat, milk, eggs, silk worms, and honey. The per capita GDP in 2003 was $189 in Nurobod, \n$150 in Rasht, and $237 in Tajikabad. A significant percentage of the working population has \nmigrated from the area to find employment. There are no historical, cultural, or archaeological \nsites along the alignment, with the exception of a cemetery and a mazar (religious site) at km \n200+700 and a cemetery at km 212+800, both adjacent to the alignment. \n \nD.  Screening Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n10.  Soil. Potential impacts to the soil along the alignment are from (i) soil erosion, (ii) borrow \npits, (iii) loss of agricultural land, and (iv) soil contamination. Soil erosion may occur along the ", "50  Appendix 11 \nalignment due to disturbance of the topography and changes in the local hydrology. Mitigation \nmeasures  during  construction  will  include  appropriate  engineering  design  (including  batter \nslopes, compaction levels, and installation of culverts), planting of vegetation, construction of \nappropriate storm-water drainage and limiting off-corridor vehicle movements. The Project is \nanticipated to improve erosion due to the construction of more than 50 culverts along the \nalignment  and  slope  stabilization  works.  Mitigation  measures  during  operation  will  include \nstrengthened road maintenance capabilities for road drainage and landscaping. \n \n11.  Localized impact to soil may occur at borrow pit sites along the alignment. Where \npossible,  existing  borrow  pits  will  be  used.  All  borrow  pits  will  be  rehabilitated  after  the \ncompletion  of  extraction  activities.  This  will  include  revegetation,  reformation  of  grades  to \nprevent erosion, and replacement of stored topsoil. The contractor will prepare a borrow pit \nmanagement plan for approval prior to the commencement of excavation activities. Small areas \nof agricultural land may be temporarily lost to construction camps and materials storage areas. \nOff-corridor construction traffic may impact agricultural land, although this is not expected. \nWhere  possible,  construction  camps  and  material  storage  areas  will  not  be  located  on \nagricultural land and pre-existing hardstand storage areas will be used. Otherwise, agricultural \nland will be rehabilitated after construction is completed and construction camps and material \nstorage areas have been removed. Construction traffic will be confined to the existing road \ncorridor. If access roads are required, e.g., to a new borrow pit, existing tracks will be used \nwhere possible. Contractors will get approval for proposed access road alignments and hauling \nschedules prior to construction. \n \n12.  Damage to soil and groundwater may result from (i) spillage of hazardous materials, \nincluding hydrocarbon leakage, at the construction camps; (ii) inappropriate waste handling; and \n(iii) spillage of hazardous materials during transport along the alignment. Mitigation measures \nwill include appropriate storage of hazardous materials, including hydrocarbons, and hazardous \nand/or nonhazardous wastes. An oil interceptor will be provided for all vehicle wash down \nactivities. All hazardous and nonhazardous wastes will be disposed at local municipal waste \ndisposal facilities. There will be no site-specific landfills developed for the Project. The potential \nfor  contaminant  spillage  during  transport  will  be  reduced  by  the  road  improvement.  A \ncontingency plan will be developed for cleanup of spills during the operational phase. \n \n13.  Water Resources. Potential impact to water resources along the alignment includes (i) \nincreased sedimentation in rivers due to bridge construction and earthworks, (ii) hydrocarbon \nleakage, and (iii) sewage discharge from construction camps. Increased sedimentation will be \nmitigated through erosion control from the proposed earthworks, and management of spoil from \nconstruction  activities  in  or  adjacent  to  the  rivers  during  bridge  construction.  Hydrocarbon \nleakage will be mitigated through appropriate storage and handling of hydrocarbons in work \ncamps, including secondary containment and spills cleanup equipment. Sanitary wastewater \nfrom the construction camps will either be collected and disposed in nearby municipal treatment \nfacilities, disposed in septic tanks located more than 500 m from the local waterway, or treated \non-site  according  to  national  wastewater  discharge  standards  prior  to  disposal  to  local \nwaterways. Sanitary wastewater will not be disposed untreated to adjacent waterways. \n \n14.  Air Quality. During construction, air quality may be impacted by fugitive emissions from \nconcrete  and  asphalt  batching  plants  and  dust  from  construction  equipment.  During \nconstruction, all concrete and asphalt batching plants will be operated within Tajikistan pollution \ncontrol guidelines and will be located at least 1 km from the nearest residential area. Dust \ngeneration during construction will be minimized by dust suppression using water and requiring \nhaulage trucks to cover loads. The contractor will submit a dust suppression plan to the project ", "Appendix 11  51\n \nimplementation unit (PIU) for approval prior to commencement of construction activities. During \nthe operational period, air quality may be affected by increased vehicle emissions along the \nalignment.  However,  relative  impact  is  anticipated  to  be  minimal.  If  it  falls  within  national \nstandards, no  additional  mitigation  requirements  are  recommended.  During  the  operational \nperiod, dust levels are anticipated to decrease due to improvements in the road surface. \n \n15.  Noise and Vibration. The major impact from noise during the construction phase will be \nfrom  earthworks  machinery  and  rock  scaling.  Mitigation  measures  will  include  limits  on \nconstruction  operation  times  (0600\u20132100  hours  within  500  m  of  residences),  and  regular \nequipment maintenance to minimize noise discharge. During the operational phase, noise levels \nalong the alignment will increase due to larger traffic volumes. Noise modeling for the increased \ntraffic during the operational phase indicates noise levels will meet Tajikistan standards with the \nexception of approximately 4 houses in East Garm which are within 3.0 m of the alignment. \nNoise  monitoring  will  be  conducted  in  these  areas  following  completion  of  construction  to \nconfirm noise estimates. Noise mitigation measures will be implemented where required. There \nare no sensitive sites (schools, hospitals, etc.) within 100 m of the alignment, with the exception \nof one school in Yangolik village. The major impact from vibration will be from road rehabilitation \nactivities (re-grading and compaction) near residential areas. The main area of concern is a \nsection in East Garm where approximately 4 houses are located within 3.0 m of the alignment. \nThese houses will be monitored during construction to ensure structural integrity and the safety \nof  residents.  Vibration  impact  from  blasting  is  not  anticipated  to  be  an  issue  as  blasting \nrealignment activities will be restricted to mountainous areas, located a considerable distance \nfrom any residential dwellings. \n \n16.  Solid Waste Generation. Solid waste generated by the Project will include domestic \nwaste, waste oils, and minor waste chemicals from the construction camps. All solid waste will \nbe appropriately stored on-site and removed from the site for disposal in municipal waste \ndisposal facilities. There will be no site-specific landfill established at the construction camps. \nWaste bitumen generated from the road rehabilitation activities will be recycled, where possible.  \n \n17.   Recycling of Construction Materials. Where possible, reclaimed asphalt pavement will \nbe  reused  as  subbase.  Existing  granular  base  material  will  be  reused,  after  screening  or \nblending  to  achieve  required  specific  particle  size  distribution.  If  the  materials  cannot  be \nrecycled for road construction, they will be moved to a waste disposal site approved by the \nSCEPF.  \n \n18.  Culture  Impact.  There  are  no  historical,  cultural,  or  archaeological  sites  along  the \nalignment, with the exception of a cemetery and mazar (religious site) at km 200+700 and a \ncemetery at km 212+800. The Project will not disturb these sites. \n \n19.  Flora  and  Fauna.  The  alignment  does  not  pass  through  or  near  any  ecologically \nprotected  areas.  The  major  potential  impacts  to  flora  and  fauna  from  the  Project  are  (i) \nincreased poaching and cutting of timber by construction workers, and (ii) improved access to \nforested areas via improved rural roads, making them vulnerable to poaching and timber cutting. \nMitigation measures will include informing construction workers that poaching and timber cutting \nare  strictly  prohibited.  Regular  inspections  will  be  carried  out,  and  strict  penalties  will  be \nenforced. Appropriate access to food supplies and heating or cooking fuels will be provided in \nthe construction camps. \n \n20.  Social Impact. Construction activities will be managed to minimize disruption of normal \ntraffic flows. Road safety is expected to improve considerably due to landslide prevention works, ", "52  Appendix 11 \nthe improvement of pavement, and the provision of road signage and barriers. However, since \nvehicle speeds will increase, livestock fatalities are anticipated to increase. The Project may \npotentially impact public health through the spread of malaria, HIV/AIDS, and other sexually \ntransmitted diseases. Mitigation measures will include the implementation of the HIV/AIDS and \nmigration component. \n \nE.  Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n \n21.  The Government\u2019s regulation on environmental impact assessment is based on Article 7 \nof the Law on Ecological Expert Examination (2003), which requires environmental examination \nfor  infrastructure  developments.  The  project  scope  is  not  included  in  the  type  of  projects \nrequiring full state ecological expertise (SEE) or full environmental impact assessment (EIA). \nTherefore, the Project will not require a full SEE or full EIA under Tajikistan law. However, in \nthese  situations  SCEPF  has  a  requirement  to  approve  projects  based  on  background \nenvironmental information provided by the applicant or proponent. Therefore, the IEE will serve \nas a background document required for SCEPF approval. There are no other SEE or EIA \ndocuments required for Project approval by the Government. \n \n22.  The MOT is the Executing Agency (EA) for the Project. Together with the construction \ncontractor,  it  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  requirements  of  the  Environmental \nManagement  Plan  (EMP),  and  following  all  applicable  Tajikistan  environmental  laws  and \nregulations. A project implementation unit (PIU) will be established within MOT and will be \nresponsible  for  project  management.  One  PIU  staff  will  be  assigned  responsibility  for \nenvironmental management for the Project. An outline of the EMP is included in the IEE. The \nconstruction contractor will prepare the EMP based on this outline and submit it to the PIU for \napproval.  The  recommended  contents  of  the  EMP  and  environmental  monitoring  plan  are \npresented in ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). The construction contractor \nwill  designate  an  environmental  representative  during  implementation  of  the  EMP.  The \nenvironmental  representative  will  be  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  EMP, \nenvironmental monitoring, and preparation of reports for MOT. \n \n23.  MOT shall ensure that the contractors implement adequate environmental and social \nimpacts  management  in  compliance  with  the  applicable  environmental  laws,  regulations, \nprocedures, and guidelines of both the local and national governments. Compliance with ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003) should also be \nensured. MOT shall further ensure that the contractors implement the recommendations made \nin the IEE, and translate the EMP in the IEE into a contract-specific EMP. MOT and project \nsupervision and monitoring consultants will submit an annual report to ADB on environmental \nperformance during project implementation. Environmental supervision of the Project will be \nundertaken by MOT and SCEPF. MOT will ensure that the tender documents and contracts for \nthe Project incorporate environmental mitigation and monitoring measures. MOT will supervise \nthe  consultants  through  weekly  inspection  visits  to  the  sites  (visual  observations  and \ncommunications) and preparation of monthly reports. SCEPF will undertake random and routine \nenvironmental monitoring. \n \nF.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n \n24.  Public consultation was conducted in Dushanbe, Nurobod, Rasht, and Tajikabad districts \nand a number of small settlements along the proposed alignment from 10 March to 5 May 2005, \nin accordance with the guidelines on Public Consultation and Information Disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003).  The  consultation  involved  affected  people, ", "Appendix 11  53\n \ncommunity  leaders,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  central  and  regional  government \nofficials.  Information  regarding  the  proposed  consultations  was  distributed  through  regional \ngovernment bodies prior to consultation to ensure participation by a wide cross-section of the \ncommunity.  Consultation  methods  included  public  meetings,  focus  group  meetings,  spot \ninterviews, and questionnaires. The consultations were conducted in ten locations and included \nover 250 people. The consultation process indicated that the public generally supports the \nProject  and  is  anticipating  improved  economic  benefits.  The  major  concerns  identified  are \nrelated to employment opportunities, soil erosion, waste management, traffic safety, and dust \nsuppression. Recommendations from the consultation were included in the engineering design. \n \n25.  Information disclosure is being undertaken by (i) placing the SIEE in the report and \nrecommendation of the President which will be posted on the ADB website;3 (ii) providing copies \nof the IEE and/or SIEE; (iii) preparing and disseminating an information brochure in Tajik, \nexplaining affected peoples\u2019 entitlements and the compensation and grievance procedures; and \n(iv) establishing a formal grievance redress committee, including community representatives. \nThe MOT and/or contractor will be responsible for managing the grievance program. \n \nG.  Findings and Recommendations \n \n26.  Construction activities associated with the proposed Project consist of the rehabilitation \nof 77 km in the central section of the road, 12 km of the border section, and improvement of \napproximately 60 km of rural access roads. The communities along the alignment are generally \npoor, and the Project is anticipated to provide considerable benefits to local economies, as well \nas the national economy. The existing environment along the alignment is under considerable \nstress. The major potential environmental impacts from the proposed Project are associated \nwith (i) soil conservation (slope stability and erosion control); (ii) protection of water resources \n(increased sedimentation and hydrocarbon storage); (iii) construction impacts on residents (air \nquality, noise, and vibration); (iv) environmental management of construction yards (solid waste, \nsanitary wastewater, hydrocarbon storage); (v) protection of flora and fauna (poaching and fuel \nwood collection); and (vi) protection from negative social impacts. \n \n27.  Mitigation measures for these impacts have been detailed in the IEE and this document. \nEffective implementation of these mitigation measures is anticipated to reduce the identified \nenvironmental impacts to acceptable levels. \n \nH.  Conclusion \n \n28.  The proposed road rehabilitation is anticipated to have significant positive impact on the \neconomies of the local communities and to the national economy of Tajikistan. Based on the \nresults of the IEE, the Project will not generate significant environmental impacts, provided the \nmitigation measures detailed in this document are implemented appropriately. Based on the \nrequirements of the Government of Tajikistan and ADB, there are no further environmental \nstudies required for the proposed Project.  \n                                                 \n3 http://www.adb.org.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Tajikistan: \nThe civil war in the mid-1990s caused much destruction in the project area. It resulted in a high level of \npoverty and destroyed basic social infrastructure. Infrastructure such as water supply, schools, medical \nclinics, and some electricity supply was restored to a minimal level through the effort of international \ndonors and NGOs as a part of post-conflict rehabilitation. However, the road infrastructure has not been \nrehabilitated and is subject to frequent damage from floods and landslides. The poor condition of the roads \ndiscourages in-country and regional trade and inhibits the population from accessing markets, other \neconomic opportunities, and basic social services. It thus has a negative impact on people\u2019s welfare and \nreduces living standards. \n \nAccording to the social survey of the project area, the rehabilitation of national and local roads ranks as a \ntop priority. The residents of the project area expect to benefit through improved links to markets and \nimproved access to employment opportunities and social services for the poor; lower transport costs for \nagricultural inputs and products; better access to and interaction with other regions for transport of \nessential goods from urban to rural areas; and employment opportunities during construction, and after \ncompletion from increased economic activity. The project will greatly contribute to the agriculture sector, \nspecifically the production of fruit, which must be transported on the project roads to reach markets. High \nlevels of damage to fruit during transport currently discourage both farmers and traders from investing in \nfruit production and trading. As a result, only 50% of the production capacity is being used.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis         Poverty Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nIncome poverty incidence in the project area is 68%, with the average income less than TJS600 per capita \nper year. Fifty percent of household income comes from remittances from labor migrants abroad, while \n35% is from agriculture. In terms of education, 100% attendance of children up to 9 years for both boys \nand girls is attained through free education. As for health, every village has trained medical assistants. \nPrimary health care centers with minimal facilities exist in all  jamoats (counties). Over 90% of the \npopulation in the project area has access to running water suitable for drinking. The total population in the \nproject area is about 180,000. All of them will benefit from the Project, including about 120,000 poor \npeople. \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nThe Ministry of Transport and the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA)1 consultants have \nundertaken socioeconomic surveys and conducted public meetings, which raised the level of awareness of \nthe Project and gained local support. Intensive consultation with village leaders, rural poor, and women \nwere carried out during the PPTA socioeconomic survey on project impact and on resettlement issues. \nThe participatory activities are an ongoing process that will continue during project implementation, \nincluding for the poor and women. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nTo maximize the benefits of the Project to community members in the project area, the Ministry of \nTransport will encourage the contractors to hire labor from the local communities for construction of the \nnational and rural roads, and provide training as needed. As part of the selection of rural roads to be \nrehabilitated, local authorities and leaders are being consulted closely in order to target the Project\u2019s \nbenefits on the most critical areas. \n \n \n \n                                                           \n1 ADB. 2004.

Gender Development  \nMen and women achieved considerable social and economic gains under the FSU, but gender equality \nhas been undermined since independence. Social relations have been disrupted by changes such as the \nprivatization of economic assets, giving rise to new economic relations among families, communities, and \nthe Government.  Access  to  resources  required  for  survival was  further limited during the civil war, with \ncorresponding influence on social and gender relations. The conflicts between traditional values and \ncurrent economic needs are mediated within families, but the conflicts between traditional values and \ngender roles are more difficult to mediate. Women are expected to uphold traditional values while \ncontributing to their families\u2019 livelihoods. Traditional gender roles and expectations of girls and women limit \ntheir access to education, skills, resources such as land, and frequently to knowledge of the outside world. \nPressure on men to meet all their families\u2019 needs is also strong, and this stress is sometimes expressed as \ndomestic violence or psychological harassment. Socioeconomic and gender-relevant issues in the project \narea were considered in the project design. These include traditional rural societies; seasonal male labor \nmigration  to  the  Russian  Federation;  conservative  religious  beliefs  and  associated  gender-based \npractices; a high percentage of households headed by females, including war widows; women\u2019s lack of \nemployable skills; increasing drug trafficking and consumption patterns; and women\u2019s greater exposure to \nthe risks and impact of HIV/AIDS2 and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe lack of connectivity between national highways and rural feeder roads critically affect women\u2019s access \nto basic social services (district health and education facilities) and district markets in areas characterized \nby traditional conservative values and related gender-based discriminatory practices. According to the \nPPTA\u2019s social and poverty assessment, the project area is characterized by increasing gaps in women\u2019s \naccess to post-secondary education and health services. Out of 210 surveyed households, only 2% of \nwomen had attended vocational schools and/or colleges, compared with 17% of men. Females reported \nlower literacy. Limited access to health services has been identified as a critical factor affecting women\u2019s \nlives, as reflected in low health indicators (with high maternal mortality rates), limited knowledge of \nsanitation, reproductive health, HIV/AIDS and other STIs. Household surveys indicated that men have a \nwide range of employment opportunities, while women are predominantly limited to agriculture (78%) and \ntending livestock (13%). The average income of women was only 60% that of men. \n \nThe Project will have indirect and direct benefits for women. Indirect benefits are mostly related to \nenhanced connectivity and include increased access to education and health facilities; increased travel to \ntowns; increased marketability of women\u2019s products (fruits and vegetables); increased access to jobs (in \nlocal markets); and increased access to information. Women will benefit from outside ideas as access to \nthe rest of the country improves. A direct benefit is the adoption of an integrated and community-based \napproach to HIV/AIDS and migration, targeting local communities and high-risk groups. It will reduce the \nlevel of risk within the campsites and along the corridor of influence, and establish an environment \nconducive to the maintenance of safe sexual practices among seasonal migrants, women, intravenous \ndrug users, sex workers, and transport and construction operators. \n \nHas an output been prepared?

The Project will finance rehabilitation of (i) about 89 kilometers (km) of the Dushanbe\u2013\nKyrgyz border road, including the center and border sections of the road; and (ii) about 60 km of \nrural access roads in the Nurobod, Garm, and Tajikabad regions. All the construction activities \nwill take place either within the existing right-of-way or, if necessary on unutilized state land. \n \n2.  A draft short resettlement plan (SRP) has been prepared by the Ministry of Transport \n(MOT), the Project\u2019s Executing Agency, with assistance from ADB consultants. The draft SRP \nwas based on the detailed impact survey completed during preliminary project design, and the \nsocioeconomic  survey  of  affected  households.  The  SRP  covers  all  project  components, \nincluding all expected impacts and resettlement measures. The rural road component will not \ninvolve land acquisition and resettlement. However, to guarantee that unforeseen impacts are \ntreated in accordance with ADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), MOT assures ADB \nthat if any land acquisition or resettlement is involved, the affected people will receive the same \ncompensation and other assistance provided for in the SRP. \n \nB.  Scope of Land Acquisition on the Right-of-Way \n \n3.  All the rehabilitation activities will take place either within the existing right-of-way or, if \nnecessary, on unutilized state land. No land acquisition or relocation of households is expected. \nNo loss of community and public resources is foreseen. If it becomes necessary for the Project \nto use any new borrow pits or quarries, these will be located on unutilized state-owned land. \nHowever, there are two locations\u2014Garm and Yangolik village\u2014where small portions of the \nright-of-way are occupied by hedges for homesteads and small branch houses.1 It is necessary \nto remove these structures to restore the road to the width necessary for safety. \n \n4.  In Yangolik village, hedges of two households occupy part of the right-of-way. Another \nfamily\u2019s small branch house will be adjacent to the road after rehabilitation. Therefore, it may be \nnecessary to move the structure by 2 m to keep the road to its designed width.  \n \n5.  The portion of the road in Garm includes a sharp curve in the eastern part of the town. \nThis sharp curve and the existence of houses and an earth mound to the west cause poor \nvisibility and impair safety. To solve this problem, the Project will straighten this section, which is \nabout 150 m. Fundamental engineering work for the straightening was done 17 years ago \nduring the former Soviet Union. The work that remains to be done is either filling a deeply cut \ngully, or building a bridge. Affected households were relocated and compensated years ago.2 \nHowever, there are three houses on the eastern side of the gully: two are on the alignment; one \nis next to the alignment. One of the houses on the alignment is abandoned, while the other is \nnot inhabited, and is rarely used. The house next to the alignment is inhabited at present, but \nwill be buried if the gully is filled, or will be under the bridge. The owners of all of these houses \nhave been compensated, but the owner of the third house still needs some assistance for \nrelocation. \n \n6.  The upgrading of the 60 km of rural roads will be done within the existing right-of-way. \nNo  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  are  expected.  MOT  assures  ADB  that  in  case  land \n                                                 \n1  Small houses, like gatehouses, which are separate from the main house. \n2  Interviews with community members and leaders. ", "58  Appendix 13 \nacquisition  and/or  resettlement  are  necessary  for  the  improvement  of  the  rural  roads,  the \naffected people will receive the same compensation and other assistance provided for in the \nresettlement plan. \n \nC.  Policy Framework and Entitlements \n \n7.  For the people who are negatively affected by the Project, the resettlement objective is \nto achieve equal or better income and living standards in line with the Land Code of Tajikistan \n(2004) and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995). MOT will ensure that any people \nlosing land, housing, other assets, or income sources will be assisted to fully restore their \nincome and living standards. The cash compensation rates proposed represent full replacement \nas defined under ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995). Entitlements are presented \nin Table A13.1. \n \nTable A13.1: Resettlement Entitlement Matrix \n \nCompensation \nAlignment  Entitled  Implementation \nType of Losses  Level of Impact  Policy and \nOption  Persons  Issues \nStandards \nExisting ROW  Demolishing  3 HHs (60 m2)     Owner  Full cash  The Government, \n(Yangolik  branch houses    compensation to  through local land \nvillage)  losers, TJS200/m2  administration \n  bodies, to work \ndirectly with \naffected \nhouseholds on \ncompensation \nissues. \n       \nExisting ROW  Demolishing  2 HHs (60 m)     Owner  Full cash   \n(Yangolik  structures (earth  compensation to \nvillage)  walls)  losers, TJS50/m \n       \nExisting ROW  Compensation  1HH (shop)     Owner  Full cash   \n(Yangolik  for lost income      compensation to \nvillage)    losers during  \n        rebuilding of shop,   \nTJS5.5/day \n       \nExisting ROW  Demolishing  2 HHs (30 m )     Owner  Full cash   \n(Garm)  plants (bio fence)  compensation to \nlosers, TJS20/m \n       \nExisting ROW  Damage to  10 HHs     Owner  Protective   \n(various  houses caused  construction \nlocations) and  by construction   \nstraightened  vibrations  Cash compensation \nsection  for repairs \n(Garm)  amounting to \nTJS500 per HH \nEA=executing agency, HH=household, m=meter, m2=square meter, ROW=right-of-way, TJS=somoni. \nNotes: (i) Prepared by the Ministry of Transport and project preparatory technical assistance consultants.

The Government will ensure that resettlement entitlements are provided to the people \naffected prior to the commencement of ground leveling and demolition. \n \nD.  Institutional Arrangements \n \n9.  The Government will assume the overall responsibility for implementing resettlement \naccording to the approved SRP. MOT\u2019s project implementation unit will assign one staff member ", "Appendix 13   59\nresponsibility for resettlement, including coordinating the planning, implementation, financing, \nand reporting of land acquisition and/or other resettlement impacts for the project components. \nLocal land committees, each composed of nine members, will be established in all affected \nvillages  and  towns.  The  local  land  committees  will  take  primary  responsibility  for  the \nresettlement consultation, implementation, and timely delivery of entitlements. \n \nE.  Vulnerable Groups \n \n10.  Among the affected households, two are headed by women. Their income of less than \nTJS500 per year is below the poverty line of TJS600. Since the Project will not affect their \nfarmland or productive assets, there will be no additional support from the Government other \nthan compensation. However, MOT will provide the opportunity for these households to be \nemployed under the Project so that they can earn extra income. \n \nF.  Consultation and Grievance Redress \n \n11.  The Land Code of Tajikistan (2004) requires disclosure of information and consultation \nwith people affected. The people affected have been notified about the key elements of the SRP \nduring meetings and interviews. Prior to implementation, there will be further consultations \narranged by the local land committees to discuss specific impacts on each household. The \nresettlement scope, expected timeframe, compensation rates for land and other assets, other \nassistance to replace assets, relocation, and the grievance redress mechanisms will also be \nexplained.  The  local  land  committees  will  ensure  that  any  concerns  raised  by  the  people \naffected are quickly addressed. \n \n12.  All complaints will be processed based on Article 47, Chapter 7 of the Land Code of \nTajikistan (2004). People affected must first submit their written complaint to the local land \ncommittee. If their complaint is not settled, they can file an appeal in court. \n \nG.  Monitoring and Reporting \n \n13.  Since  the  Project\u2019s  impacts  on  households will  be  minor,  simple  monitoring  will  be \ncarried out to check the process of compensation. Internal monitoring and evaluation will be \nundertaken by the project implementation unit and reported to ADB through quarterly progress \nreports. External monitoring will be done by an international and/or domestic nongovernment \norganization as part of project performance monitoring. Resettlement monitoring for this Project \nwill be part of the overall social impact monitoring. An annual budget of $5,000 for 5 years is \nallocated for the social impact monitoring. \n \nH.  Finance and Implementation Schedule \n \n14.  The SRP budget estimate is $12,000 for all costs including compensation; resettlement \nsubsidy; and payments for other assets such as housing, moving allowances, and fees for \nresettlement administration. The Government will guarantee to supplement the resettlement \nbudget  as  necessary,  to  meet  any  shortfall  that  may  arise  during  the  achievement  of  the \nresettlement objectives.
