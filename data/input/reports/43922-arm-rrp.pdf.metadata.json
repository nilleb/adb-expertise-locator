It will increase the passenger-\nhandling capacity of the Zvartnots International Airport (ZIA) to about 3.2 million a year from the \ncurrent  level  of  1.8  million\u20132.0  million  a  year.  The  project  will  be  the  first  private  sector \ninfrastructure  investment  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in  Armenia  or  the  Caucasus \nregion.  \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n\nA. \n\nProject Identification and Selection \n\n2. \nBefore  the  breakup  of  the  Soviet  Union  in  1991,  ZIA,  which  was  built  in  the  1960s  in \nYerevan, operated as a domestic airport. All arrivals to and departures from the former Soviet \nUnion  took place  through  Moscow.  After  1991,  ZIA  assumed  a  critical  role  for  Armenia  as  the \nmost  important  gateway  to  the  country.  However,  from  1991  to  2001,  capital  expenditure  for \nexpansion  and  modernization  was  minimal,  despite  the  significant  need  for  upgrading.  Since \n2002,  significant  investments  to  modernize  the  airport  have  been  made,  but  there  remains  a \ncritical  need  for  further  upgrading  of  the  passenger  terminal  to  bring  it  up  to  international \nstandards  and  to  enable  it  to  cater  to  the  expected  increase  in  aviation  traffic  to  and  from \nArmenia.  The  project  is  the  final  phase  of  the  modernization  and  expansion  of  ZIA.  Upon \ncompletion of the project, ZIA will relocate all its operations from the old airport terminal to the \nnew  facilities,  which  will  increase  passenger  comfort  and  the  speed  of  passenger  processing, \nprovide  a  wider  scope  of  commercial  and  aeronautical  services,  and  bring  the  facilities  up  to \ninternational standards in terms of safety, security and environmental aspects. \n \nB. \n\nSector Background \n\n3. \nArmenia has a population of about 3.2 million and a total area of about 29,800 square \nkilometers.  Given  its  landlocked  location,  civil  aviation  plays  a  crucial  role  in  the  economy. \nFurther  underscoring  the  importance  of  this  sector,  Armenia  has  restricted  use  of  its  southern \nborder due to extreme climatic conditions. There is a very limited railway system in Armenia and \nthe  road  infrastructure  is  in  urgent  need  of  fresh  investment.  As  a  result,  Armenia  is  largely \ndependent on air transportation for cross-border movement of passengers. Additionally, with an \nestimated strength of 7 million, the Armenian diaspora is one of the largest groups of its kind in \nthe world and has a marked impact on the travel market, since members of the diaspora have \nstrong social and economic ties with the country and frequently travel to it.  \n \n4. \nAlthough this is the first ADB involvement in the civil aviation sector in Armenia, the ADB \nCentral  and  West  Asia  Department  has  had  significant  engagement  in  the  transport  sector  in \nArmenia, particularly in roads projects as shown in the table below.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nDetails of ADB Assistance in the Armenian Transport Sector \n($'000) \n\n \nProject \nA.

The  report  recommended \nstrengthening  institutional  capacity,  governance,  and  legislation,  as  well  as  a  tourism-specific \nstrategy  to  eliminate  transport  impediments.  For  airports  and  civil  aviation,  the  primary  goal  is \nthe  development  of  competitively  priced  air  services  providing  extensive  connections  through \nefficient  airports.  The  report  also  recommended  that  the  strategy  should  include  a  national \naviation  system  plan  (which  would  address,  among  others,  the  need  for  new  runway  and \nterminal  infrastructure,  the  feasibility  of  reopening  airports,    passenger  demand  assessment, \nand  the  introduction  of  a  new  Armenian  carrier),  and  identify  the  re-equipment  needs  of \nArmenian Air Traffic Services (the state-owned entity responsible for providing air traffic control, \nnavigation, and aeronautical information services in the airspace of Armenia).   \n \n6. \nThe  Armenian  aviation  sector  experienced  significant  structural  changes  after  the \nbreakup of the Soviet Union. Until 1991, it was a part of the former Soviet Union's centralized \neconomy, and air fares were subsidized. As a result, traffic levels within the former Soviet Union \nwere  very  high  and  passenger  traffic  to  and  from  Yerevan  reached  2.5  million  just  before  the \nbreakup of the Soviet Union. Following the independence of Armenia, subsidies were withdrawn \nfrom  air  fares  and  traffic  to  and  from  Yerevan  collapsed  to  just  over  0.5  million  passengers  in \n2000.  However,  growth  in  passenger  traffic  resumed  in  2001  and  currently  stands  at  over  1.4 \nmillion.  \n \nRecognizing  the  critical  importance  of  the  aviation  sector,  the  Government  of  Armenia \n7. \nhas taken a proactive role in attracting fresh investment. Modernization of ZIA started in 1994, \nwith  EBRD  (European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development)  providing  a  sovereign \nguaranteed loan to the former Zvartnots Airport Company (ZAC), a state-owned airport entity, to \nconstruct a new air cargo terminal. The cargo terminal was completed in 1999 and provides a \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Transport Sector Development Strategy. Consultant's report. Manila (TA 4973-ARM). \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n \n\n \n\nhigh-quality  facility  suitable  for  any  modern  airport  (it  has  a  capacity  of  60,000\u201380,000  tons  a \nyear, with the possibility of an expansion to 110,000 tons).  Under the terms of the EBRD loan, \nZAC was obliged to tender for a private sector manager to take over its cargo operations. The \ntendering  process  was  conducted  in  1998,  but  failed  to  elicit  any  meaningful  private  sector \nresponse. In 2000 the EBRD commissioned an external team of experts from British Aerospace \n(BAe) to review the overall situation.  \n \n8. \nThe conclusion of the BAe experts was that the most feasible option would be to involve \na  private  investor  to  run  the  entire  airport  area,  combined  with  additional  development \nopportunities to be provided by the creation of a free trade zone.  They also indicated that, in \nview of the generally difficult economic situation in Armenia, the proposed investment might be \nof  interest  only  to  a  limited  number  of  investors,  most  likely  of  Armenian  origin,  with  a  longer-\nterm investment perspective. They therefore recommended direct approaches and negotiations \nrather than an open tender for the concession award. In line with the BAe recommendations, in \nDecember 2001 the government negotiated a concession agreement with Corporacion America, \nan Argentinean company controlled by Eduardo Eurnekian (an Argentinean citizen of Armenian \ndescent). In order to implement this concession agreement, ownership of the airport assets was \ntransferred from ZAC to full state ownership, after which the airport concession was granted to \nCorporacion America on an exclusive basis for the management of the entire airport operation \nfor 30 years. The concession agreement became effective in May 2002. Following the granting \nof  the  concession,  Corporacion  America  transferred  the  concession  rights  to  ArIA,  its  affiliate \nand  a  special  purpose  Armenian  company.  Subsequently  EBRD,  along  with  DEG  (Deutsche \nInvestitions-und Entwicklungsgesellchaft), financed phase 1 of the modernization of ZIA.  \n \nThe concession agreement grants ArIA the right to be the manager and airport authority, \n9. \nand  the  government's  control  over  ArIA's  operations  in  certain  specific  areas  is  regulated  by \nArmenian  legislation.  The  General  Department  of  Civil  Aviation  (GDCA),  an  adjunct  body \noperating  under  the  government,  oversees  the  safety  and  security  aspects  of  the  airport's \noperations. It has the authority to establish terms and restrictions for the use of the airport for \nsafety  reasons,  ensure \nInternational  Civil  Aviation  Organization  (ICAO)  security \nrequirements are met, and to carry out inspections and observations for the purpose of ensuring \ncompliance  with  the  ICAO  requirements.  The  Ministry  of  Environment  conducts  environmental \noversight. In addition, the GDCA regulates and supervises the operations of other major players \nin the civil aviation sector: Armavia, the national carrier, and Armenia Air Traffic Services. There \nis,  therefore,  a  significant  concentration  of  power  with  the  GDCA,  which  is  responsible  for \nsetting  procedures  and  technical  regulations,  and  is  also  directly  involved  in  the  day-to-day \noperations of these companies. Any future reform process will have to consider the potential of \nreorganizing the GDCA directly under the Ministry of Transport and Communication, and setting \nup an independent regulatory body in its place (footnote 1).  \n \nUnder  the  concession  agreement,  ArIA  has  the  right  to  propose  adjustments  to \n10. \naeronautical  tariffs  from  time  to  time,  in  order  to  ensure  that  it  receives  the  stipulated  internal \nrate of return under the concession. Any tariff revision requires approval by the government, as \ndetermined  by  an \nintergovernmental  committee  comprising  representatives  of  various \ngovernment agencies. The process of approval of aeronautical tariffs is closely coordinated by \nthe GDCA.  \n \n\nthat \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 \n\nThe project is consistent with ADB's Strategy 2020 which identifies infrastructure as one \n11. \nof  ADB's  five  core  areas. 2 ADB  will  invest  in  key  civil  aviation  infrastructure  in  Armenia  to \nstrengthen  transportation  and  connectivity  between  Armenian  and  other  countries.  Under \nStrategy  2020,  ADB's  infrastructure  operations  will  emphasize  public\u2013private  partnerships  and \nprivate sector engagement, which is consistent with the project. Under Strategy 2020, regional \nintegration  is  one  of  ADB's  three  complementary  strategic  agendas.  The  project  will  directly \npromote regional integration by improving air connectivity between Armenia and other countries. \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with the Country Strategy \n\n12. \nThe project is in line with ADB's economic report and interim operational strategy 2006\u2013\n2009 for Armenia3 as well as ADB's country operations business plan 2008\u201320104 for Armenia. \nThe economic report and interim operational strategy identifies, among others, the promotion of \nthe  private  sector  and  enhancement  of  regional  cooperation  as  ADB's  strategic  priorities.  The \nproject  is  consistent  with  two  of  the  principles  underlying  the  economic  report  and  interim \noperational strategy: (i) being selective in determining initial operational areas and focusing on \ndelivering  swift  results,  and  (ii)  partnering  with  other  development  agencies  to  exploit  the \ninstitutional  infrastructure.  The  country  operations  business  plan  envisages  transport  and \ncommunications  interventions,  focusing  on  modernizing  international  transport  corridors  to \nenhance trade and business opportunities. The project is consistent with this focus. The project \nwill be completed within 3 years and will provide immediate benefits by improving Armenia's civil \naviation  infrastructure  and  air  connectivity.  The  project  is  being  financed  as  a  response  to  the \neconomic  crisis,  with  ADB  working  in  close  collaboration  with  the  EBRD  and  DEG  to  ensure \nspeedy financing and implementation of the project.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Description \n\n1. \n\nThe Shareholder, Sponsor, and Borrower  \n\na. \n\nShareholder and Sponsor \n\n13. \nArIA  is  currently  100%  owned  by  American  International  Airports  (AIA),  a  Delaware- \nregistered  holding  company  created  in  2002  with  the  objective  of  conducting  airport-related \nactivities.

In 2006, in accordance with a master plan \nagreed  with  the  government  under  the  concession  agreement,  ArIA  began  phase  1 \nmodernization program for ZIA, which envisaged the construction of a new passenger terminal \nbuilding  to  house  arrivals  and  an  increase  in  the  overall  airport  capacity.    This  phase  was \ncompleted in May 2007 and was financed by EBRD and DEG. The new arrivals terminal is now \nfully operational.  \n \n15. \nFollowing  completion  of  the  new  terminal,  ArIA  exercised  its  right,  granted  under  the \nexisting  concession  agreement,  to  extend  the  concession  to  the  Gyumri  airport,  the  second \nlargest airport in Armenia. Gyumri airport is a small airport serving only the Commonwealth of \nIndependent States market, but it is of strategic importance as a relief airport for ZIA during the \nwinter,  when  dense  fog  in  ZIA  often  forces  it  to  close  for  2  to  3  days  at  a  time.    The  Gyumri \nrunway rehabilitation works were completed in early 2008 and ArIA now operates Gyumri jointly \nwith ZIA. Following a review of traffic forecasts and an update of the master plan at the end of \n2007, the government and ArIA decided to proceed with the second and final phase of terminal \ndevelopment at ZIA. \n \nArIA  relies  heavily  on  expertise  available  within  the  AIA  group.  AIA  is  committed  to \n16. \nsupporting new investments in ZIA through equity infusion. In addition, AIA provides ArIA with \nmanagerial  support  in  overall  airport  operations,  ground  handling  and  maintenance  activities.  \nAIA  also  supports  ArIA  by  formulating  business  plans,  negotiating  with  local  and  government \nbodies, maintaining relationships with public bodies and institutions, providing financial planning \nand developing sources of funding. AIA also acts as ArIA's interface in negotiating with airlines \nand freight operators in order to attract them to Armenia. It supports ArIA with training and by \nproviding  qualified  personnel  from  its  pool  of  international  expertise.  AIA  provides  extensive \nsupport for the administration of commercial and services-related activities in ZIA.  \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\nThe  project  envisages  the  construction  of  a  new  landside  terminal  building  and \n17. \ninstallation of equipment and facilities to supplement the airside concourse that was built during \nphase 1 of the modernization program. This new terminal, which will house separate departure \nand  arrival  halls,  will  replace  the  existing  terminal  (built  during  the  Soviet  era)  and  house  the \nfunctions previously based there. The design is expected to lead to a simpler and more efficient \noperational layout, allowing for planned growth in the future if needed. Together with the existing \narrivals and departure building in the airside terminal, the project will provide enhanced levels of \nservice  and  comfort  for  passengers  (reducing  walking  distances  and  optimizing  passenger \ncirculation  flows).  Upon  completion  of  the  project,  the  passenger  handling  capacity  of  ZIA  is \nexpected to increase to 3.2 million per annum from the current 1.8\u20132.0 million. \n\n \n18. \nThe  new  terminal  building  is  a  two-level  system  separating  arriving  and  departing \npassengers and their respective processing areas. The new check-in hall will be equipped with \ncounters fitted with common user terminal equipment technology and self-check in kiosks. The \ncheck-in  system  will  be  connected  to  a  new  outbound  baggage  system  taking  luggage  to \ncarousels in the basement, where security personnel will use customs clearance scanners, new \nX-ray  equipment  and  tomographers  to  analyze  it.    The  project  also  includes  a  new  multilevel \nvehicle parking area in front of the arrival hall. Because Yerevan is located in one of the most \nactive  seismic  regions  in  Armenia,  the  proposed  terminal  building  will  be  based  on  the  latest \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nseismic structural designs. The project design, which forms a part of the overall master plan for \nthe development of ZIA, complies with the standards and recommended practices of ICAO and \nthe  International  Air  Transport  Association  (IATA).  The  project  will  also  provide  a  strong \ndemonstration  of  best  practice  in  the  area  of  energy  management  and  environmentally \nsustainable  design.  It  utilizes  several  elements  of  best  available  techniques  for  energy \nperformance of building infrastructure and service equipment.  \n  \n\n3. \n\nProject Outputs and Outcome \n\n19. \nThe  project  will  augment  the  capacity  of  ZIA  from  the  current  level  of  1.8  million\u20132.0 \nmillion  passengers  a  year  to  about  3.2  million  and  will  streamline  and  modernize  passenger \nhandling  and  processing  systems.  When  it  is  completed,  Armenia  will  have  a  modern  airport \nthat  meets  world-class  service,  efficiency  and  safety  standards,  and  high  environmental \nstandards. The proposed new terminal is expected to be significantly less energy-intensive than \nthe  departure  terminal  that  it  will  replace.  Efficiencies  are  expected  in  almost  all  areas  of \npassenger-handling  operations,  including  the  check-in  process,  arrivals  and  baggage  claims, \nsecurity, immigration and customs control. The project has a significant local cost component, \nwhich will increase the level of activity and employment in the local construction industry during \nthe construction phase. Upon completion of the project, the number of jobs at ZIA is expected to \nincrease by at least 500 in the areas of ground-handling, duty free operations, and other retail \nactivities. \n \n20. \nThe  construction  of  a  modern  terminal  will  enhance  passenger  comfort  and  support \noverall growth in civil aviation. The project will support an expected passenger traffic growth of \n3% per annum starting in 2011 (leading to an increase in passenger traffic from the current level \nof  over  1.4  million  to  about  1.7  million  by  2015)  and  corresponding  increases  in  aircraft \nmovements.   \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact \n\n1. \n\nContribution to Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction \n\nAviation is a key facilitator of economic growth. The project will meet a vital infrastructure \n21. \nneed in the aviation sector of Armenia and contribute to economic growth. Aviation is not only a \nmajor  industry  in  its  own  right  (employing  large  numbers  of  highly  skilled  workers  directly  and \nindirectly),  but  also  is  essential  for  integrating  a  country  into  the  rapidly  globalizing  world \neconomy. Aviation generates wealth, jobs, taxes and tourism. For a landlocked country such as \nArmenia, strong and efficient aviation infrastructure is particularly significant. More connections \nto  the  global  air  transport  network  can  boost  productivity  and  economic  growth  by  providing \nbetter access to markets, enhancing links within and between businesses and providing greater \naccess to resources.5  Air transport acts as an economic catalyst by providing a new and faster \nmechanism for distributing goods and services, contributing to growth in existing industries and \nincreasing overall economic efficiency.  \n \nThe project envisages the construction of a state-of-the-art international airport terminal \n22. \nin the capital city of Armenia that will meet high levels of service, safety and security in line with \ninternational standards. Upon completion, there will be tangible improvements in the operational \nefficiency of the airport, which, in addition to improving passenger comfort and ease of travel, is \n\n                                                 \n5  International Air Transport Association. 2007.

Armenia's  air \nconnectivity,  which  is  currently  one  of  the  worst  in  the  Central  Asia  and  Caucasus  region,  is \nlikely  to  get  a  boost  upon  completion  of  the  project.

In addition, the new airport terminal will provide \ngreater opportunities for retail activities and create jobs in various related and ancillary sectors. \nThe  greater  economic  activity  resulting  from  increased  connectivity  and  traffic,  as  well  as \ncommercial activities, will have an indirect effect on poverty reduction. The project is also in line \nwith  the  master  plan  agreed  by  ArIA  and  the  government  and  is  consistent  with  the \ngovernment's development plans for the sector.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPrivate Sector Development \n\nThe 2002 privatization of ZIA was a successful privatization effort in a key infrastructure \n23. \nsector. Since then, significant private capital has been invested in its modernization. The project \nwill augment further private sector investment in the airport development program by supporting \nthe  final  stage  of  its  modernization.  Greater  private  sector  involvement  in  the  airport's \nmanagement will support the government's efforts to bring about efficiency and a high level of \nsafety and security at the airport. Given the project's high profile in Armenia's overall economy, \nit  is  expected  to  play  a  catalytic  role  and  encourage  the  government  to  pursue  similar \nprivatization  efforts  in  other  areas.  Over  the  last  8  years  of  the  concession,  ArIA  has  drawn \nheavily  upon  its  affiliates  for  technical  expertise  in  aviation  management  and  this  has  been \ngradually  transferred  to  local  employees  and  professionals  (as  can  be  seen  by  ArIA's  \nincreasing  reliance  on  local  staff  to  run  airport  operations).  Direct  training  and  development \nprograms are also provided to local staff by ArIA's affiliates operating in South America. \n \nC. \n\nEnvironment and Social Dimensions \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment \n\n24. \nThe potential environmental impacts of the project, as related to its location, construction \nand operation, have been assessed by an initial environmental examination, and were found to \nbe insignificant or temporary. Any environmental impacts of the project can be readily mitigated. \nThe  project  has  been  classified  as  category  B  for  environment  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).    The  project  will  meet  the  ICAO  and  European  Aviation \nSafety Agency environmental standards and will upgrade the environmental, health and safety \nstandards  of  the  airport.  Various  impact  mitigation  measures  have  been  included  in  the \nenvironmental management plan, as part of the initial environmental examination (Appendix 2), \nand adopted by ArIA. The proposed terminal is within the premises of the existing airport, and \nwill be integrated with it. No aesthetic impact is expected. The impact on groundwater or surface \nwater  is  anticipated  to  be  minimal  because  the  groundwater  levels  are  generally  4-8  meters \ndeeper than the building's foundation, and no surface water body, including rivers or lakes, will \nbe  affected.  During  construction,  dust  is  expected  from  excavation,  transportation  of \nconstruction  material,  emissions  from  construction  vehicles,  among  others,  but  this  will  be \nmitigated by measures such as periodic water spraying and covering of construction materials. \nWhen the airport is operational, the only fixed source of pollution will be from the boiler house, \nwhich  will  run  on  natural  gas.  It  will  meet  the  required  emission  standards  and  will  have  no \nmajor impact on air quality. The project is expected to lead to additional vehicular and air traffic, \nbut increases in air emissions will be negligible because (i) the access roads to the airport have \nample capacity for additional traffic so there will be no congestion-related air emissions, and (ii) \nincreased  air  emissions  from  additional  flights  will  be  offset  by  the  fact  that  the  newer  aircraft \noperating in the airport will have much lower emission levels than those operating now.  \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n25. \nThe major sources of noise during construction will include excavation, transportation of \nmaterials, and operation of construction equipment, but their impact will be minimized by careful \nplanning and scheduling of machinery operations and use of low-noise equipment. There are no \nhospitals or schools near the project site.  An analysis of the current and future noise impacted \nareas indicates that, when the airport is operational, aircraft noise impact will decrease and the \naffected area will be smaller than at present because the aircraft will be significantly quieter than \nthose today, particularly the older Russian jets.  In addition, the project requires aircraft to follow \na noise-abatement procedure that establishes noise-preferable routes to avoid flying over areas \nthat are susceptible to noise.  \n \n26. \nThere  are  no  major  health  and  safety  hazards  anticipated  from  project  implementation \nand  operation.  ArIA  has  developed  an  environmental  management  system  according  to  the \nInternational  Organization \nfor  Standardization  (ISO)  14001  and  a  health  and  safety \nmanagement  system  according  to  the  Occupational  Health  and  Safety  Advisory  Services \n(OHSAS)  18001,  which  is  currently  being  implemented.  The  resettlement  site  to  house  the \ndisplaced  persons  has  been  examined  for  its  environmental  impacts.  No  significant  negative \nimpacts will result from the construction of the new residential buildings, which will be on major \nroads  and  in  an  existing  community  where  adequate  waste  and  waste  water  management \ninfrastructure is provided by the government. \n \n\n2. \n\nSocial Dimensions  \n\n27. \nThe  new  terminal  is  being  built  on  vacant  land  owned  and  used  by  ZIA.  Therefore,  no \nland acquisition or involuntary resettlement is required for the project.  However, as part of the \nmaster  plan  for  the  rehabilitation  of  ZIA,  ArIA  is  required  to  remove  four  residential  buildings \ninside the airport territory, affecting 506 residents. The project has therefore been classified as \ncategory A for involuntary resettlement in accordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement \u2013 \nSafeguards  Requirements  on  Involuntary  Resettlement.  ArIA  has  prepared  a  resettlement \naction plan (RAP) in line with ADB and EBRD's policy requirements. Since 2006, ArIA and the \ngovernment  (through  the  General  Department  of  Civil  Aviation)  have  consulted  with  the \ndisplaced  persons,  most  of  whom  are  airport  employees.  An  Armenian  translation  of  the \nsummary RAP (Appendix 3) was disclosed to displaced persons in September 2009.  As per the \nRAP,  displaced  persons  are  entitled  to  relocate  closer  to  Yerevan  City  to  apartments  that  are \nthe same size or larger than their current ones. Moving charges will be shouldered by ArIA and \nfree  daily  transportation  from  their  new  residence  to  the  airport  will  be  provided  to  airport \nemployees. No loss of income or employment is expected as a result of the relocation. The site \nfor the new buildings has already been identified and a preliminary design for the building has \nbeen  agreed  upon  with  the  displaced  persons.  ArIA  will  be  responsible  for  financing  and \nimplementing the relocation process. ArIA has allocated $13 million for the relocation program, \nwhich  has  been  included  in  the  project  cost.  To  comply  with  ADB's  Public  Communications \nPolicy (2005), the RAP will be posted on the ADB website.  There are no indigenous peoples in \nArmenia  and  the  project  does  not  trigger  ADB's  safeguards  requirements  on  indigenous \npeoples.   \n \nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nManagement \n\n28. \nArIA  is  managed  by  a  professional  management  team  headed  by  Marcelo  Wende,  an \nArgentinean expatriate deputed from Corporacion America, the group company that manages a \n\n\f \n\n9\n\n \n\n \n\nnumber  of  operating  airports  in  South  America.  While  a  number  of  expatriates  continue  to  be \ninvolved  in  the  operations  and  management  of  the  company,  highly  skilled  Armenians  have \nbeen progressively added to the management team over the past 8 years, leading to a transfer \nof knowledge and airport management skills from Corporacion America. ArIA continues to draw \nheavily  on  the  technical  expertise  available  in  Corporacion  America  and  the  AIA  group  of \ncompanies.  The  construction  process  is  being  closely  supervised  by  a  team  of  architects  and \nengineers  headquartered  in  Argentina.    Since  the  beginning  of  the  concession  in  2002,  all \ndevelopment  plans  have  been  implemented  on  time  at  ZIA  and  service  levels  have  improved \nsignificantly,  exceeding  expectations.  Based  on  this  successful  track  record,  as  well  as  the \nsatisfactory  progress  in  project  implementation  to  date,  the  incumbent  management  appears \nadequately qualified to complete the project and manage the airport satisfactorily. \n \n\n2. \n\nConstruction Arrangements \n\n29. \nFor  project  construction,  ArIA  is  following  procurement  procedures  similar  to  those \nadopted for phase 1. It has entered into a design and construction management contract with \nEuroport, an Italian service provider with significant experience in supplying goods and services \nin  aeronautical  and  associated  businesses.  Under  the  management  contract,  Europort  is \nresponsible  for  conceptual  and  detailed  design  development,  preliminary  cost  estimation, \npreparation of technical documents required for price bidding, and inspection and supervision to \nensure  compliance  with  construction  documents.  Europort  is  also  responsible  for  coordinating \nthe execution of works, monitoring progress in implementation, issuing service orders and other \nadministrative  work  pertaining  to  project  execution.  For  the  concrete  structures,  roads,  and \naccess-ways,  separate  contracts  have  been  executed  with  Courthill  Corporation,  with  whom \nArIA  has  over  6  years'  satisfactory  experience  during  the  renovation  of  the  runway  and \nconstruction of aircraft stands. Local contractors will perform other construction works such as \nthe  check-in  and  immigration  counters  and  concession  facilities.  In  addition,  ArIA  has  an  in-\nhouse  infrastructure  department,  staffed  with  architects  and  engineers  responsible  for \noverseeing  the  contractors'  activities.  ArIA  draws  heavily  from  the  AIA  group  of  companies' \nglobal expertise in airport construction and management.  \n \n\n3. \n\nOperations Arrangements \n\n30. \nArIA  was  awarded  the  concession  to  operate  ZIA  under  a  concession  agreement \nexecuted  in  December  2001.  Under  the  concession,  ArIA  has  been  granted  exclusive  right  to \nadminister and operate ZIA and related property and equipment, and to conduct all businesses \nrelated to ZIA for a period of 30 years. ArIA has the option to extend the term of the concession \nfor additional periods of 5 years. The concession agreement requires ArIA to prepare a master \nplan  for  the  airport,  agree  it  with  the  government,  and  keep  it  updated  at  least  every  5  years \nthroughout  the  period  of  the  concession;  the  ultimate  objective  being  the  construction  and \noperation  of  a  modern  terminal  complex  with  dedicated  arrivals  and  departures  buildings.  The \nconcession  agreement  permits  ArIA  to  set  aeronautical  tariffs  that  include  aircraft  landing  and \ntake-off  charges,  aircraft  parking charges,  passenger  handling  fees,  and  loading  bridge  usage \ncharges.  \n \n31. \nThe concession agreement allows for a pre-agreed internal rate of return (IRR) to ArIA \nover  the  period  of  the  concession.  In  order  to  reach  this  IRR,  ArIA  is  permitted  to  propose \namendments to the master plan, as well as revisions to aeronautical tariffs. Adjustments to all \naeronautical  tariffs  become  effective  as  soon  as  ArIA  notifies  the  government,  and  may  be \nobjected to by the government within 15 days. All other commercial and non-aeronautical fees \n(except the fuel margin) are set at ArIA's sole discretion. If ArIA does not recover the aggregate \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nIRR, it is entitled to extend the term of the concession at its sole discretion.  Implementation of \nthe  concession  arrangement  has  so  far  been  satisfactory,  with  the  government  approving  a \nnumber of adjustments to aeronautical tariffs proposed by ArIA from time to time.  \n \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n32. \nThe  borrower  and  sponsor  were  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) and policy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing \nof  Terrorism  (2003).  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB will require the borrower and sponsor to institute, maintain, and comply with \ninternal procedures and controls following international best practice standards for the purpose \nof  preventing  corruption  or  money  laundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism  and \ncovenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. The loan documentation between \nADB,  the  borrower  and  the  sponsor  will  further  allow  ADB  to  investigate  any  violation  or \npotential violation of these undertakings. Non-compliance by the borrower or the sponsor of any \nof  the  undertakings  and  covenants  mentioned  above  will  allow  ADB  to  seek  immediate \nprepayment of the ADB loan. \n \n\n5. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring, Reporting, and Evaluation \n\nArIA will provide to ADB quarterly unaudited International Financial Reporting Standards \n33. \n(IFRS) based financial statements and reports on the progress in implementation of the project. \nArIA's annual accounts are audited by Grant Thornton Amyot in accordance with IFRS. On an \nannual basis, ArIA will be required to submit its audited financial statements, a confirmation of \ncompliance with financial covenants, an annual operations review, an environmental and social \nmonitoring report, and a report on the annual energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions (to \nbe  published  on  ArIA's  website).  ADB  will  monitor  the  project  vis-\u00e0-vis  the  updated  business \nplans to be furnished by ArIA, using information from its own sources and the public domain.  A \nlenders'  supervisor  will  be  jointly  appointed  by  the  lenders  for  monitoring  the  progress  in \nimplementation  of  the  project.  Appendix  1  contains  the  design  and  monitoring  framework, \nincluding  the  relevant  performance  indicators.  ArIA  will  be  required  to  report  on  these \nperformance indicators periodically.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\n1. \n\nInstrument and Amount \n\n34. \nThe  proposed  ADB  assistance  will  comprise  a  direct  loan  of  up  to  $40  million  with  a \nrepayment period of up to 10.50 years (including a grace period of about 3.25 years). The loan \nwill be funded using ADB's ordinary capital resources without government guarantee. The loan \nwill  have  a  floating  interest  rate  in  accordance  with  ADB's  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based  lending  facility.  A  commitment  fee  and  a  front-end  fee  will  be  charged  in \naccordance with ADB policy and subject to the approval of the ADB Investment Committee.  \n   \n\n2. \n\nTerms and Conditions \n\nThe  proposed  loan  will  be  documented  in  a  loan  agreement  between  ADB  and  ArIA, \n35. \nwhich  will  contain  standard  terms  and  conditions  applying  to  senior  debt  to  private  sector \nborrowers  without  government  guarantee.  The  loan  agreement  will  set  out  the  covenants, \n\n\f \n\n11\n\n \n\n \n\nrepresentations and warranties, and events of default that will apply to the ADB loan. ADB will \nalso  execute  an  intercreditor  agreement,  a  retention  account  agreement,  and  other  security \nsharing  agreements  with  the  senior  lenders  for  the  sharing  of  the  security  at  an  equal  rate, \nincluding  the  moveable  and  immovable  assets  of  ArIA  and  all  shares  issued  by  ArIA.  The \nsecurity  creation  will  be  subject  to Armenian  law  and  procedure  on  perfection  of  security.  The \nfirst disbursement of the ADB loan will be subject to conditions precedent. During the tenor of \nthe  loan,  ArIA  will  be  bound  by  the  financial  and  operational  covenants  pursuant  to  the  loan \nagreement.  \n \n\n3. \n\nCompliance with Investment Limitations  \n\nThe proposed financing is within ADB\u2019s approved medium-term, country, industry, single \n\n36. \nproject, and group exposure limits for nonsovereign operations.  \n \nB. \n\nJustification for ADB Assistance \n\nThe  proposed  project  will  be  ADB's  first  nonsovereign  intervention  in  the  infrastructure \n37. \nsector in the Caucasus region, and will further the relationship between ADB and Armenia. The \npotential assistance for the project will be justified as a response to the ongoing financial crisis \nand  the  strong  development  impacts  of  the  project.  It  supports  the  government's  plans  for  the \ncivil aviation sector and ADB's operational strategies. ADB will add value in the following areas.   \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe development of the aviation sector is key to the development and economic \ngrowth of Armenia. ZIA is the most important link between Armenia and the rest \nof  the  world  and  is  therefore  of  key  strategic  importance.  Strengthening  and \nmodernizing the airport will help to connect Armenia to the rest of the world and \nmake  movement  of  passengers  more  efficient,  which  will  lead  to  enhanced \neconomic growth. The ADB investment will play an important role in developing a \nsector that has suffered from underinvestment.  \n\nArmenia  has  been  significantly  affected  by  the  global  financial  crisis.  Growth  in \nArmenian GDP declined from 13.8% in 2007 to 6.8% in 2008. During 2009, GDP \nis  estimated  to  have  contracted  by  over  15%. 6  Armenia  is  unable  to  attract \nforeign  direct  investment  for  key  infrastructure  projects.  Loans  from  commercial \nbanks for the project that were originally envisaged are no longer available. The \nADB loan will be a timely crisis response and will be critical to bringing in much \nneeded  external  investment  and  increasing  the  confidence  of  the  international \nbusiness community. The project also represents an ideal opportunity for ADB to \npartner with EBRD for the first time in a private sector infrastructure project and \nto deepen relations with DEG. \n\nThe  proposed  initiative  is  strongly  aligned  with  Strategy  2020.  The  investment \nfocuses on infrastructure development, private sector development, and regional \nintegration.  The  project  is  aligned  with  ADB's  economic  report  and  interim \noperational  strategy  (2006\u20132009)  for  Armenia,  which  identifies  private  sector \npromotion and enhancement of regional cooperation as ADB's strategic priorities. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  work  of  ADB's  public  sector  operations  in \nArmenia's transport sector and regional integration. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n6 The Economist Intelligence Unit. 2009. Country Report \u2013 Armenia. London (November). \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \nC. \n\nAssurances \n\n(iv) \n\nThe proposed financing is consistent with the government's strategy for the civil \naviation  sector.  The  project  will  complement  efforts  to  bring  efficiency  to  the \nsector  through  private  sector  participation.  The  ADB  assistance  is  aimed  at \nsupporting an established private sector entity with a proven, 8-year track record \nin operating a key part of the country's transport infrastructure.   \n\nConsistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),7 \n38. \nthe Government of Armenia will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \nassistance to ArIA. No funding will be disbursed until ADB receives such confirmation. ADB will \nenter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following \napproval of the proposed assistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n39. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove the loan of up to $40,000,000 to Armenia International Airports for the Zvartnots Airport \nExpansion  Project  (Phase  2)  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources with  terms  and  conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to \nthe Board. \n \n \n \n\nC.

Environment \n\nSUMMARY OF INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n\nThe project is located within the existing Zvartnots International Airport which lies within \n1. \nthe  Ararat  valley  at  an  altitude  of  858  meters  (m)  above  sea  level.  Ararat  mountain  is  to  the \nsouth and the project area is situated in the Ararat plain, which is defined by the river Araks in \nthe southwest and the river Kura in the northwest. The airport is about 12 kilometers (km) from \nthe center of Yerevan city. The climate is continental, with hot summers and cold winters. The \nabsolute  maximum  temperature  in  summer  is  420C,  with  a  minimum  of  -300C  in  winter.  The \nArarat valley consists of lower\u2013upper quaternary volcanic tuff and coarse grained debris which \nare  covered  by  contemporary  alluvial  sediments  (clay,  sand,  and  anthropogenic  soils).  The \nYerevan  area  is  considered  one  of  the  most  active  seismic  areas  in  Armenia.  In  the  20th \ncentury,  more  than  10  earthquakes  greater  than  M4  magnitude  have  been  registered,  the \nstrongest of which was in 1937 with a magnitude of M4.7. There are no designated biodiversity \nsensitive  areas,  such  as  nature  reserves,  wetlands,  or  bird  protection  areas  in  the  immediate \nvicinity of the airport. The nearest surface water course is the River Hrasdan about 1,000 m to \nthe east. In Armenia, about 96% of water used for drinking comes from groundwater resources. \nThere are wells in the vicinity of the airport in use for irrigation purpose. \n\n \n\nAnticipated Impacts of the Terminal Construction \n\nSurface  water.  The  project  alignment  does  not  cross  any  major  water  bodies  so  no \n\n1. \n \n2. \nGroundwater. The foundation of the terminal is set between 8.50 m and 10.5 m, deeply \nembedded  in  red  volcanic  tuff.  As  the  groundwater  level  is  at  depths  of  14  m\u201316  m,  the \ngroundwater level is not reached by the foundation and thus no negative impacts are expected. \n \n3. \ndirect impacts on the water flow and quality will be introduced by the project. \n \n4. \nAmbient  air  quality.  During  construction  works,  the  impacts  will  be  dust  due  to \nexcavation,  loading  and  unloading,  transporting  the  construction  material,  and  emissions  from \nconstruction vehicles and equipment. Impact mitigation measures (e.g., periodic watering of the \nconstruction  site  and  covering  of  construction  material)  are  included  in  the  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) and environmental action plan (EAP). When the airport is operational, \nthe  only  fixed  source  of  air  pollution  will  be  the  boiler  house,  which  will  use  natural  gas. \nEmissions  are  within  permissible  limits.  Additional  traffic  will  access  the  airport  and  use  the \napproach  streets.  The  roads  leading  to  the  airport  have  ample  capacity  to  deal  with  the \nadditional  airport  traffic,  so  congestion  leading  to  increased  levels  of  air  pollution  is  not \nexpected.  Additional  flights  are  expected  because  of  the  anticipated  increase  in  air  traffic,  but \ntheir additional air emissions are considered negligible and their impacts insignificant. \n \n5. \nNoise.  The  major  sources  of  noise  during  construction  activities  will  be  during \nexcavation, loading, transportation of materials, and operation of construction equipment. These \nimpacts  will  be  mitigated  by  careful  planning  of  machinery  operations,  use  of  low  noise \nequipment,  and  restricting  scheduling  of  operations  to  the  daytime  to  reduce  their  impacts  to \nreceptors.  There  are  no  hospitals  or  schools  near  the  project  site.  During  operations,  aircraft \nnoise impacts will decrease, and the noise impacted area will be smaller than it is now.  This is \nbecause  the  aircraft  that  will  use  ZIA  when  the  new  terminal  becomes  operational  will  be \nsignificantly quieter than those that fly today.   \n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n   Appendix 2 \n\nHealth  and  safety  hazard  and  management.    There  are  no  major  health  and  safety \n6. \nhazards anticipated from project implementation. There is potential for health impacts from the \ncurrent and past management of hazardous wastes, abandoned fuel tanks, and asbestos on the \nairport  grounds.  ArIA  has  been  informed  of  this  situation  and  will  address  this  in  the \nenvironmental management system implementation.  \n\n \n2. \n\n \n3. \n\nAnticipated Impacts of the Development of the Resettlement Site \n\n \nNo  land  acquisition  is  required.    However,  together  with  the  construction  of  the  new \n7. \nterminal and as part of the master plan developed for the airport, there are four buildings owned \nby the airport that need to be removed for reasons of health and safety.  ArIA is implementing a \nresettlement  action  plan  (RAP)  in  line  with  the  requirements  of  ADB.  The  site  where  the  new \nbuildings will be developed to receive the people from the airport property was investigated to \nexamine the development impacts. No significant impacts were identified. \n\nMitigation of Impacts and Summary Environmental Management Plan \n\nThe  identified  impacts  will  primarily  occur  during  the  construction  phase.

The public has also been informed via mass media. The people who will be \nrelocated have been consulted numerous times and have expressed a general desire to move \nto the new buildings as soon as possible because the buildings they live in are, generally, in a \nvery poor condition.  \n \nC. \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\n11. \nAn analysis of the baseline environmental conditions indicates that the proposed project, \nincluding the relocation site, would not have adverse impacts on the environment that cannot be \nmitigated.  The  identified  impacts  are  limited  to  the  construction  phase  and  therefore  are \ntemporary  and  small-scale.  Adequate  mitigation  measures are  proposed  for  implementation  in \nthe  form  of  an  environmental  management  plan  that  will  be  implemented  during  construction. \nNo further environmental assessment is deemed necessary.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3     \n\n18 \n \n \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN \n\n  \n1. \nIntroduction.  As  part  of  the  master  plan  to  rehabilitate  and  expand  the  operations  of \nZvartnots International Airport, Armenia International Airports (ArIA) has undertaken construction of \nthe new passenger terminal which will replace the old terminal 1 building. The new terminal is being \nbuilt  on  vacant  land  owned  by  Zvartnots  International  Airport.    During  construction  of  the  new \nterminal and as part of the airport master plan, four residential buildings inside the airport territory \nwill be removed.   \n \n2. \nScope of involuntary resettlement impacts. The affected residential buildings include two \nidentical  medium-rise  multi-dwelling  buildings,  a  four-story  hostel,  and  a  training  center  hostel. \nApartment  units  are  either  owned  or  occupied  by  current  or  former  airport  employees.  The  asset \ninventory  and  census  of  residents  was  updated  in  2009  and  found  that  506  residents  in  171 \napartment units will be affected. \n \n3. \nSocioeconomic  profile.  The  airport  and  its  various  service  providers  employ  about  3,000 \npeople.  A  large  percentage  of  the  residents  work  at  the  airport  as  drivers,  mechanics,  customer \nservice  employees,  shift  managers  at  check  in  counters,  flight  attendants,  and  pilots.  School-age \nchildren attend classes at a primary school near the airport or in Yerevan city.   \n \nParticipation,  consultation,  and  information  disclosure.  Since  2006,  ArIA  and  the \n4. \ngovernment  of  Armenia  (represented  by  the  General  Department  of  Civil  Aviation  [GDCA])  have \nconsulted with the building residents, who have been informed about the need to relocate them, the \nlocation of the proposed resettlement site, and their entitlements. ArIA has elected to proceed on a \nvoluntary  basis  and  to  incentivize  residents  to  relocate  by  offering  homes  in  a  better  area. \nResidents  are  willing  to  relocate  provided  that  they  will  be  given  apartments  of  the  same  size  or \nlarger  in  Yerevan  city,  moving  charges  are  covered,  and  free  transportation  is  offered  to  airport \nemployees.  An  Armenian  translation  of  the  summary  resettlement  action  plan  (RAP)  was  made \navailable to affected people in September 2009.  To comply with the Public Communications Policy \n(2005) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the RAP will be posted on ADB website.   \n \n5. \nLegal framework and entitlements.  Analysis of Armenian laws reveals that there are gaps \nbetween national requirements and the involuntary resettlement policies of ADB and the European \nBank for Reconstruction and Resettlement (EBRD).  ArIA has adopted policy principles to address \nthese  gaps,  e.g.  providing  replacement  apartment  units  regardless  of  nature  of  ownership  rights.  \nThe entitlements of affected people are shown in Table A3. \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                              Appendix 3                                           \n\n19\n\n \n \n\nIssue and/or Loss \nLoss of \naccommodation \n\nJourney to work \u2013 \nno longer able to \nwalk to work \nTransfer of title \n\nVulnerable groups \n\nTable A3: Eligibility and Entitlement Matrix \n \n\nEligible Affected Person \nOwners with property \ncertificates \nOccupants of dormitories \nAirport employees \n\nEntitlement \nNew place of accommodation (the same \nsize or larger, depending on condition of \nthe existing apartment).  \nFree transportation will be provided to \nairport employees. \n\nAll affected persons \n\nHouseholds  headed  by \nwomen \nPersons with disabilities \n\nLegal and clerical support will be given to \nensure that title to the apartments will be \ntransferred expeditiously.  \nAssistance provided during relocation \nPersons with disabilities will be given \npreference in the allocation of units on the \nlower floors. \n\nSource: Armenia International Airports. \n\n \n6. \nRelocation to new apartment buildings. The new buildings will be constructed on a plot of \nland  at  Malatya\u2013Sebastia,  Yerevan  city.  The  site  was  selected  as  it  is  closer  than  the  current \nbuildings  to  Yerevan  city  and  to  markets,  schools,  government  and  community  facilities,  and \nemployment  opportunities.  A  preliminary  design  of  the  replacement  buildings  has  been  prepared \nand is being disclosed to the affected people. Each affected owner of the apartment units and each \nregistered  occupant  of  the  hostels  will  be  assisted  by  ArIA  to  register  his  or  her  replacement \napartment  units  as  per  the  Law  of  the  Republic  of  Armenia  on  Apartment  Building  Management \n(2002).  \n \n7. \nGrievance  redress  mechanism.  If  issues,  complaints  or  grievances  arise  about  the \nrelocation,  the  ArIA  Maintenance  and  Environmental  Department  will  engage  the  complainants  to \nidentify solutions and resolve grievances in a participatory manner. If the issue cannot be resolved \nat this level, it will be elevated to the Grievance and Redress Committee with representation from \nArIA, the city government of Yerevan represented by the GDCA, and affected people. \n \nIncome restoration. No loss of income or employment is expected as a result of relocation. \n8. \nAirport  employees  will  retain  their  positions  and  free  transportation  will  be  given.  Those  who  are \nemployed  outside  the  airport  will  be  closer  to  their  jobs  in  the  city  of  Yerevan.  Unemployed \nresidents  will  have  a  better  chance  of  getting  jobs  as  the  new  building  is  close  to  employment \ncentres. \n \n9. \nrelocation process. The GDCA will supervise and monitor the process. \n \n10. \nImplementation  schedule.    ArIA  will  hire  a  contractor  to  build  the  new  building  in \napproximately  2.5  years.  ArIA  will  ensure  that  no  physical  displacement  will  take  place  until  the \nreplacement  buildings  have  been  constructed  and  the  individual  apartment  units  are  ready  for \noccupancy.  Construction  will  begin  in  March  2010  and  will  be  completed  in  November  2011.  The \nresidents will move directly from their current homes to their new residences by February 2012. AIA \nwill assist the residents in the moving process. \n\nInstitutional  arrangements.  ArIA  will  be  responsible  for  financing  and  implementing  the \n\n11.  Monitoring and evaluation. Internal monitoring will involve: (i) administrative monitoring to \nensure  that  implementation  is  on  schedule  and  problems  are  dealt  with  on  a  timely  basis,  (ii) \nsocioeconomic monitoring during and after the relocation process to ensure that people are settled \n\n  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3     \n\n20 \n \n \nand  recovering,  and  (iii)  overall  monitoring  to  determine  whether  recovery  has  taken  place \nsuccessfully  and  on  time.  External  monitoring  will  review  and  validate  internal  monitoring  reports \nand  will  be  carried  out  in  parallel  with  the  implementation  of  the  RAP.  Monitors  will  produce  a \nsemiannual report and a final compliance report. The report will indicate whether the RAP has been \ncarried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB  and  EBRD  policy  requirements  and  to  the  satisfaction  of  the \naffected  persons.  The  external  monitor's  compliance  report  will  be  submitted  to  ArIA,  ADB,  and \nEBRD simultaneously. \n \nBudget. ArIA has allocated $13  million for the relocation program. ArIA will make as many \n12. \nmanned  vehicles  as  necessary  available  for  the  actual  relocation.  Daily  transportation  costs  for \nairport employees are included in general airport costs.  \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 13 February 2010) \n", "Currency Unit \nAMD1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "dram (AMD) \n$0.00262 \nAMD381.50  \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nAIA \nArIA \nBAe \nDEG \nEBRD \nEMP \nGDCA \nGDP \nIATA \nICAO \nIRR \nLIBOR \nRAP \nSCF \nZAC \nZIA \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAmerican International Airports \nArmenia International Airports  \nBritish Aerospace  \nDeutsche Investitions-und Entwicklungsgesellchaft  \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development  \nenvironmental management plan \nGeneral Department of Civil Aviation \ngross domestic product \nInternational Air Transport Association \nInternational Civil Aviation Organization \ninternal rate of return \nLondon interbank offered rate  \nresettlement action plan \nSouthern Cone Foundation \nZvartnots Airport Company \nZvartnots International Airport \n", " \nNOTES \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of Armenia International Airports ends on 31 December. \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "Vice-President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n \n \n \n", "X.
