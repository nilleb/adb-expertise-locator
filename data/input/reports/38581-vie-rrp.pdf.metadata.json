The  Project  will  assist \nthe Government to implement a comprehensive behavior change \ncommunication  (BCC)  action  plan,  including  mass  media  and \ncommunity outreach to effect behavior change and reduce the risk \nof  HIV  infection  among  youth  (15\u201324  years).  The  Project  will  be \nimplemented nationally and in 15 provinces over 5 years. . \n \nIn March 2006, the Government of Vietnam noted that there were \nabout  104,000  reported  HIV/AIDS  cases  in  Viet  Nam.  It  is \nestimated  that  the  actual  number  of  cases  is  three  times  this \nfigure,  with  0.54%  national  prevalence  in  the  15\u201349-year  old \npopulation. These figures represent rapid, exponential growth that \nhas  shown  no  signs  of  abating.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  epidemic  is  largely \ndriven  by  injecting  drug  use  but  a  growing  number  of  infections \noccur  among  sex  workers.  The  clients  of  sex  workers  then \nbecome the bridge to the general community (through their wives \nor girlfriends and, through mother-to child transmission). \n \nYoung  people  between  the  ages  of  15  and  24  years  account  for \nabout  40%  of  cases  and  are  a  key  target  group  for  focused \nprevention efforts. Young men and their risk-taking behavior (drug \nuse and unprotected sex with sex workers) are a driving force of \nthe epidemic. \n \nThe  Government  of  Viet  Nam  has  a  national  HIV/AIDS  strategy \n(endorsed by the Prime Minister in 2004) that identifies behavioral \nchange  information,  education,  and  communication  programs,  as \nwell  as  harm  reduction,  as  priority  activities  for  HIV/AIDS \nprevention  and  control.  With  awareness  levels  already  high, \nthat  role  modeling  and \ninternational  best  practice  dictates \nintegrated  media  and  community-based  approaches \nthat \npersonalize knowledge are the appropriate next step in a learning \nand behavior change continuum. \n \nGrant  financing  is  justified  given  that  HIV/AIDS  prevention  is  a \npublic good and highly cost-effective. \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan \n\n \nGrant Financing Plan \n\nConsistent  with  the  directions  provided  by  the  national  HIV/AIDS \nstrategy,  the  Project  will  reduce  HIV  infection  risk  behaviors \namong  youth  aged  15\u201324.  It  should  result  in  more  than  34,000 \nHIV  infections  being  avoided  over  a  20-year  period.  This  will \nprovide  positive  social  and  economic  benefits,  including  the \navoidance  of  costs  associated  with  reduced  productivity  and  the \nprolonged periods of care and treatment needed by patients. \n \nComponent  1  activities  will  target  leaders,  policy  development, \nand program integration, from the national to the community level, \nwith advocacy and support for youth programs. The outcome will \nbe  an  improved  policy  environment  for  a  youth  focus  in  the \nimplementation of a national HIV/AIDS strategy. \n \nComponent  2  activities  will  support  the  production  of  a  high-\nquality,  mass  media  behavior  change  communication  program \nfocused  on  youth  and  their  families.  The  program  will  include \ntelevision,  radio,  and  print  media  in  an  integrated,  reinforcing \npackage.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  knowledge  in  relation  to \nHIV/AIDS  risks  and  prevention  and  associated  issues  for  youth, \nincluding  accepting  condom  use  as  normal,  and  the  effect  of \nharmful  gender  stereo-types  and  stigma  and  discrimination  on \npeople at high risk and on people already infected. \n \nComponent 3 comprises three subcomponents: (i) comprehensive \nharm  reduction  services  (including  the  provision  of  voluntary \ncounseling and testing, condoms, and needles) and the provision \nof information, and peer education in settings that are accessible \nto  youth;  (ii)  peer  education  and  life  skills  training  for  vulnerable \nyouth in industrial zones, tourism spots, universities and colleges \nwith migrant youth, and other settings; and (iii) primary prevention \nthrough  school-based  education  and  community  outreach  to \nparents  on  youth  and  HIV/AIDS  issues.  The  outcome  in  project \nprovinces  should  be  an  increase  in  the  proportion  of  youth  with \naccess  to  services  and  a  reduction  in  the  number  of  new \ninfections. \n \nComponent 4 activities will support project management, capacity \nbuilding, and youth-focused monitoring and evaluation. \n \nThe Project is estimated to cost $26.7 million, including duties and \ntaxes.  Of  the  total,  $3.73  million  or  14%  is  in  foreign  exchange \ncosts  and  $22.97  million  equivalent  or  86%  represents  the  local \ncurrency costs. \n \nThe  Government  of  Viet  Nam  has \nthe  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to provide a grant of $20 million from its \nSpecial  Funds  (Asian  Development  Fund  IX  Grants  Program), \nrepresenting 75% of the total project cost. The Government of Viet \nNam will provide counterpart funds totaling $6.7 million equivalent.\n\nrequested \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \nGrant Allocation and \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\niii\n\nFinancing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Banka \nGovernment \nTotal \n\nTotal  \n\n20.00 \n  6.70 \n26.70 \n\n% \n\n75.00 \n25.00 \n100.00 \n\na Asian Development Fund grant. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nA grant of $20 million will be provided from the Special Funds of \nADB with terms and conditions in accordance with those set forth \nin the draft grant agreement presented to the Board. \n \nThe grant will be utilized until 31 December 2011. \n \n31 June 2011 \n\nfor  school-based  activities  and \n\n \nViet  Nam  Commission  for  Population,  Family  and  Children \n(VCPFC) \n \nThe  implementing  agencies  include  several  government  entities, \nand  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  led  by  the  respective \nProvincial  Committee \nfor  Population  Family  and  Children \n(PCPFC).  A  contracted  media  production  firm  will  implement \ncomponent 2. Contracted service delivery NGOs and civil society \nand mass organizations such as the Youth and Women\u2019s Unions \nwill  implement  component  3,  along  with  the  Department  of \nthe  PCPFC \nEducation \ncollaborators parent-focused programs.  \n \nA  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will  provide  technical  and \ncoordination support and will work under the guidance of a project \nsteering  committee  headed  by  the  minister  of  VCPFC.  Each \nprovince  will  establish  a  provincial  PMU  to  be  guided  by  the \nPCPFC. \n \nImplementation arrangements will ensure close collaboration and \ncoordination with the Viet Nam Administration for AIDS Control at \nthe  central  level  and  with  its  provincial  equivalent,  the  provincial \nAIDS committee. \n \nAll ADB-financed procurement will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines. \n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n\nConsultants will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  procedures  acceptable  to \nADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  The  Project  will  require \n54 person-months of international consulting services for capacity \nbuilding,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  youth  and  HIV/AIDS \npolicy  enhancement  and  360  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting  services.  There  will  be  single  source  selection  of  the \nWorld  Health  Organization  (WHO)  for  the  provision  of  youth  and \nHIV/AIDS  policy  expertise,  given  WHO\u2019s  shared  objectives  and \nexperience  of  exceptional  worth.  An  international  media  agency \nwill provide technical assistance for the mass media component. \n \nThe Project will result in lower HIV infection rates and will benefit \nyoung  people  who  would  have  been  infected  had  they  not  been \neducated  about  behavioral  options  and  given  the  resources  to \nadopt  new  behaviors  (such  as  being  tested  for  HIV,  using \ncondoms, and not sharing needles). It is estimated that the Project \nwill  result  in  the  avoidance  of  more  than  34,000  HIV  infections \nover  a  20-year  period.  The  reduced  risk  of  exponential  growth  if \ninfection rates are contained and the benefit of productive life will \nbenefit individuals, communities, and the Government.   \n \nThere  will  be  economic  benefits  from  reducing  the  losses  in \nincome incurred by the sick and their carers and from reducing the \npublic health costs of care and treatment for the ill. Benefits will be \ngreater  for  people  who  are  most  vulnerable  to  HIV  infection, \nincluding  the  poor,  young  women,  members  of  ethnic  minorities, \nmobile  youth,  and  young  people  working  in  particular  industries, \nsuch as tourism and transport.  \n \nThe  Project  has  some  financial,  technical,  and  social  risks.  It \nrequires the timely provision of counterpart funds and a sustained \nGovernment  investment  in  programs  and  projects  that  target \nyouth. The PMU and contracted media agencies need to be able \nto address sensitive issues related to sexuality, drug use, stigma, \nand discrimination directly in the media materials in order to effect \nbehavior  change.  Materials  need  to  be  broadcast  at  times  that \nmaximize audiences, especially for youth. Failure to realize these \nconditions will diminish the potential impact of the Project. Project \nimplementation  plans  and  assurances  have  been  designed  to \nreduce and mitigate these risks.  \n \nThe overall impact of the Project is dependent on people changing \ntheir  sexual  behavior  and  cultural  and  traditional  attitudes  to \nsexuality,  drug  use,  youth,  and  gender  relations.

\n\n \n\n1 \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \ngrant to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the HIV/AIDS Prevention among Youth Project. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n2. \nIn December 2004, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved project preparatory \ntechnical  assistance  for  the  HIV/AIDS  Prevention  among  Youth  Project. 1 The  Government, \nrepresented  by  the  Vietnam  Commission  for  Population  Family  and  Children  (VCPFC),  has \nagreed  to  a  project  design  that  emphasizes  support  for  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s \nnational HIV/AIDS strategy.2 The Project includes a major mass media campaign targeted at the \nyouth to be complemented by a comprehensive program of activities and services focused on \nHIV/AIDS prevention for mainstream, vulnerable, and high-risk youth in 15 provinces. \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nSector Background \n\nCurbing the growth in the HIV/AIDS3 epidemic and mitigating the impact on individuals, \n3. \nfamilies,  communities,  and  society,  including  the  economic  costs,  has been  given  high  priority \nby  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam.  It  is  also  a  priority  for  most  governments  in  the  region  and \nglobally  (Appendix  2).  The  Government  is  firmly  committed  to  meeting  the  Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals  (MDGs)  which  include  the  target  to  \u201chave  halted  by  2015  and  begun  to \nreverse  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDS\u201d  (MDG  6,  Target  7).  While  Viet  Nam  has  made  significant \nprogress toward achieving most of the MDGs, including those for poverty and child mortality, the \nprospect of achieving the MDG for HIV/AIDS remains elusive, as the number of new infections \ngrows annually and there is little sign of abatement. \n \n4. \nAccording  to  a  Government  of  Viet  Nam  report  of  March  2006,  there  are  just  over \n104,000 officially reported cases of HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam. It is estimated the actual number is \nthree  times  this  figure  representing  a  national  prevalence  of  0.54%  in  the  15\u201349-year  old \npopulation.4 These  figures  represent  an  exponential  rate  of  growth  in  the  number  of  infections \nthat  has  consistently  exceeded  official  expectations.  In  1995,  there  were  fewer  than  4,000 \nreported  cases,  but  this  had  increased  to  estimated  40,000  new  cases  per  year  by  2005.  In \n2001,  the  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH)  estimated  that  the  actual  number  of  cases  at  the  end  of \n2005 would be 197,000,5 but by March 2006 the estimate had grown to more than 310,000 (see \nfootnote 4).  \n \n5. \nThe majority of infections in Viet Nam occur in groups readily classified by their high-\nrisk  behaviors  including  predominantly  injecting  drug  users  (IDUs)  and  sex  workers.  In  mid-\n2004,  it  was  estimated  that  IDUs  accounted  for  57%  of  newly  reported  cases.  Other  reported \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2004.

Hanoi. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ncategories of HIV cases were sex workers (3%), tuberculosis patients (4.5%), army conscripts \n(1.5%) and blood donors (0.7%). More than 30% of reported cases are classified as \u201cother\u201d or \n\u201cunknown\u201d,  although  it  is  predicted  that  they  are  likely  to  be  IDUs  and  sex  workers.  Men  who \nhave  sex  with  men  are  also  a  group  at  risk  but  there  is  little  information  on  their  numbers  or \nbehaviors. It is unlikely they play a significant role in the growth of the epidemic. \n \n6. \nThe  HIV  prevalence  rate  among  IDUs  increased  from  18%  in  1996  to  over  30%  in \n2002, while among sex workers the increase was from 0.6% in 1994 to 5.2% in 2002. Data from \nsmall studies have shown 25% of sex workers in Ho Chi Minh City and 15% in Hanoi to be HIV \npositive.  All  provinces  have  reported  HIV/AIDS  cases  but  more  than  50%  of  cases  are  in  ten \nprovinces, including Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, Quang Ninh, and Hai Phong.  \n\n \n\nYoung people aged 15\u201324 constitute approximately 20% of Viet Nam\u2019s population. The \n7. \nproportion  of  HIV  infections  occurring  among  young  people  has  grown  steadily.  In  1994, \napproximately  10%  of  newly  reported  cases  were  among  people  aged  15\u201324  years;  5  years \nlater the figure was approximately  40%. Young men and their risk-taking behaviors (drug use, \nalcohol,  and  unsafe  sex)  are  the  driving  force  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  epidemic.  A  recent  survey  of \nVietnamese youth found that 50% of sexually active young men had their first sexual encounter \nin a hotel, likely to have been with a sex worker.6 \n \nA  disturbing  development  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  HIV/AIDS  epidemic  is  the  evidence  that  the \n8. \ndisease  is  spreading  into  the  general  population.  The  infection  rate  among  pregnant  women \nattending  antenatal  clinics  is  an  internationally  recognized  indicator  of  this  movement.  From \n1995 to 2002, this rate increased more than tenfold from 0.03% to 0.4%. Moreover, HIV sentinel \nsurveillance data have shown the rate to be up to 1% in the urban areas of An Giang and Hai \nPhong.  Such  infection  rates  are  indicative  of  the  spread  of  infection  between  IDUs  and  sex \nworkers, from sex workers to married men, and from men to their wives and girlfriends.  \n \n\n2. \n\nThe Response to HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam \n\n9. \nThe Government of Viet Nam\u2019s first official response to HIV/AIDS was in 1987 with the \nestablishment of a \u201csubcommittee\u201d for AIDS prevention. Since then, the status of the institutions \nresponsible  has  been  progressively  upgraded  and  strengthened,  with  accompanying  policy \ndevelopments. The first government directive was in 1995 from the Communist Party\u2019s Central \nCommittee  on  the  work  of  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  control.  In  May  1995,  the  Standing \nCommittee  of  the  IXth  National  Assembly  adopted  an  ordinance  on  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and \ncontrol that provided the legal basis for HIV/AIDS prevention and control activities. Since then, \nmore than 29 legal documents have been issued by the Government, including a decree from \nthe Prime Minister in February 2003 emphasizing the need for a multisectoral response.  \n \nthe  Prime  Minister  signed  Decision  No. \n10. \n36/2004/QD-TTg approving the National Strategy on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control till 2010 \nwith a Vision to 2020 (footnote 2) The overall objective of this national HIV/AIDS strategy is to \ncontrol the HIV/AIDS prevalence rate among the general population to below 0.3% by 2010 and \nto reduce the adverse impacts of HIV/AIDS on social and economic development.  \n \n11. \nViet  Nam\u2019s  national  HIV/AIDS  strategy  has  been  internationally  recognized  as \ncomprehensive and specific in its targets, while acknowledging the key issues that underlie the \ngrowing  epidemic  and  the  steps  needed  to  control  it.  In  particular,  the  strategy  has  noted  the \nimportance of harm reduction, incorporating (i) condom use and safe injecting (for IDUs); (ii) the \n\nNational  Strategy. \n\nIn  March  2004 \n\n                                                 \n6  MOH and WHO. 2005. Survey of Assessment of Vietnamese Youth (SAVY). Hanoi. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3 \n\npriority  of  care  and  treatment  for  people  living  with  HIV/AIDS  (PLWHA);  (iii)  the  importance  of \ncomprehensive  leadership  and  the  involvement  of  all  aspects  of  society,  including  social, \nreligious, and community organizations; and (iv) the need to fight stigma and discrimination as a \nhumanitarian  measure  and  as  a  means  of  controlling  the  ongoing  spread  of  the  virus.  The \nstrategy nominates four priority activities for HIV/AIDS prevention and control:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nintensifying behavioral change information, education, and communication (IEC), \nand collaborating with other related programs to reduce HIV/AIDS transmission; \nstepping up harm-reduction intervention measures; \npromoting counseling, care, and treatment for HIV/AIDS-infected people; and \nstrengthening program management, supervision, and evaluation capabilities. \n\n \nIn addition to the four priority activities, the strategy outlines nine programs of action: (i) \n12. \nbehavioral  change  communication;  (ii)  harm  reduction;  (iii)  care  and  support  for  PLWHA;  (iv) \nsurveillance,  monitoring,  and  evaluation;  (v)  access  to  treatment;  (vi)  prevention  of  mother-to-\nchild  transmission;  (vii)  management  and  treatment  of  other  sexually  transmitted  infections \n(STIs);  (viii)  blood  transfusion  safety;  and  (ix)  capacity  building  and  international  cooperation. \nThe specifics of these programs are being finalized by the Government and to date have been \nlargely driven by the large funding agency projects. MOH has indicated that the proposed ADB \nproject would become a key plank in the first program. \n \n13. \nYouth. The national HIV/AIDS strategy explicitly recognizes the situation of youth, and \nnotes  the  limitations  of  past  programs  and  their  failure  to  integrate  with  comprehensive \nreproductive health care programs. Street children, working young people, school dropouts, and \nyoung  people  from  ethnic  minorities  are  explicitly  recognized  as  being  at  risk  and  needing \ntargeted  intervention  measures,  including  life  skills  training,  access  to  services,  support,  and \ncare. The strategy calls for policies that mobilize well-known people and leaders to participate in \nHIV/AIDS  prevention  and  control  and  to  set  examples  for  the  community,  especially  young \npeople. It emphasizes the need to intensify behavioral change IEC (i) for community groups that \nspecifically include young people; (ii) for services that attract young people in order to efficiently \nmanage STIs and provide reproductive health care and counseling services; and (iii) to link IEC \nactivities to these services with a specific goal of attracting young people.  \n \n14. \nInstitutional  Structures.  The  Government  has  worked  to  strengthen  the  institutional \ncapacity  for  addressing  HIV/AIDS  and,  in  particular,  for  implementing  the  activities  outlined  in \nthe national HIV/AIDS strategy. The MOH is responsible for coordinating implementation of the \nstrategy.  In  August  2005,  the  Viet  Nam  Administration  of  AIDS  Control  (VAAC)  was  created \nfrom  the  former  Department  of  Preventive  Medicine  and  HIV/AIDS  Control  in  MOH  to  bring  a \nrenewed  and  higher  level  of  commitment  to  HIV/AIDS  programs.  The  national  HIV/AIDS \nstrategy envisages a role for all government agencies according to \u201ctheir assigned functions and \ntasks  and  their  own  characteristics\u201d.  The  Vietnam  Commission  for  Population,  Family  and \nChildren  (VCPFC)  is  proposing  to  lead  a  comprehensive  program  of  HIV/AIDS  prevention \nactivities  focused  on  youth  and  their  families.  Other  institutions  mentioned  in  the  national \nHIV/AIDS strategy with special responsibilities in relation to the response to HIV/AIDS include (i) \nthe people\u2019s committees of the provinces (for ensuring resource commitments); (ii) the Ministry \nof Education and Training (for integrating HIV/AIDS prevention and control knowledge into the \ncurricula  of  universities,  colleges,  and  schools);  (iii)  the  Ministry  of  Labor,  War  Invalids  and \nSocial Affairs (for operating the centers providing rehabilitation services to drug users and sex \nworkers);  and  (v)  Vietnam  Television  (VTV),  Voice  of  Vietnam  (VOV)  radio,  and  the  Vietnam \nNews Agency (for broadcasting mass media materials). The strategy also mentions the role of \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nsociopolitical mass organizations such as the Youth Union and Women\u2019s Union in implementing \nthe strategy.  \n \n15. \nA  National  HIV/AIDS  Law.  In  2006,  the  Government  is  expected  to  adopt  a  new \ncomprehensive  law  on  HIV/AIDS.  The  VAAC  in  the  MOH,  as  the  lead  agency  for  this  law-\nmaking  process,  has  consulted  widely  in  preparing  the  legislation,  including  with  the \ninternational  community.  The  draft  (as  of  March  2006)  includes  provisions  for  protecting  the \nrights  of  PLWHA,  fighting  stigma  and  discrimination,  and  strengthening  the  responsibilities  of \ngovernment  institutions,  society,  and  families.  Laws  play  an  important  role  in  facilitating  the \nimplementation  of  programs  and  strategies  in  Viet  Nam,  so  the  passage  of  the  law  will  be  an \nimportant step in facilitating the implementation of the national HIV/AIDS strategy. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nChallenges \n\nRapid  Economic  Development  and  Social  Change. In the past 10 years, Viet Nam \n16. \nhas  made  impressive  progress  in  fighting  poverty,  with  poverty  incidence  falling  from  58%  in \n1993 to 24% in 2004 and nearly 60% of households moving out of poverty.7 However, economic \ngrowth  has  been  uneven  and  concentrated  in  large  cities and  the  river  deltas,  and  the  rate  of \npoverty reduction has slowed in recent years. Viet Nam also has a growing population of young \npeople,  with  just  over  50%  of  the  population  under  the  age  of  25  years.  Young  people  are \nuniquely  affected  by  the  rapidly  changing  economic  conditions.  With  working  and  social  lives \nand  expectations  largely  different  from  those  of  their  parents,  they  potentially  face  issues  that \nthey  are  not  prepared  for,  or  that  their  parents  are  poorly  equipped  to  help  them  with.  The \nbehaviors and social conditions that fuel the HIV/AIDS epidemic are among these. \n \n17. \nMigration.  Accompanying  Viet  Nam\u2019s  rapid  but  uneven  economic  growth  and  the \nyoung population profile have been the high rates of migration\u2014internal, spontaneous, regional, \nand often temporary or repeated a number of times. Studies have found that approximately 37% \nof  the  population  have  migrated  at  least  once  in  their  lives  and  more  than  half  the  internal \nmigration  has  been  to  the  large  urban  centers, particularly Ho  Chi  Minh  City  and Hanoi.  More \nwomen  than  men  migrate  and,  in  the  late  1990s,  it  was  estimated  that  more  than  half  the \ninternal migrants were less than 25 years of age, demonstrating the pull of the rapidly growing \nindustrial  zones,  where  factory  employment  in  industries,  such  as  textiles,  is  increasingly  on \noffer. By nature of their social disconnection, migrant youth are known to be more vulnerable to \nadopting high-risk behaviors in relation to HIV/AIDS.  \n \n18. \nGender  and  HIV/AIDS.  Recognizing  the  different  risks,  behaviors,  and  sociocultural \nsituations of men and women in relation to HIV/AIDS is critical for understanding the epidemic \nand  mounting  an  effective  response.  Girls  and  women  are  physically  more  vulnerable  to \ninfection. Economic and social disempowerment means women are more likely to be involved in \nsex  work  and  to  be  unable  to  protect  themselves  through  condom  use  from  infection.  Social \nstructures  and  cultural  values  that  to  some  extent  promote  and  condone  multiple  sexual \npartners for men, including married men, and the use of sex workers, make a woman\u2019s marital \nstatus  a  risk  factor  for  infection.  As  wives,  women  are  vulnerable  to  infection,  as  they  are \ngenerally powerless to insist that their husbands practice safe sex.  Furthermore, as mothers or \n\n                                                 \n7  Measured using the international standard for the poverty line comprising essential food expenditure for standard \nhuman  energy  intake  (2,100  calories/capita/day)  and  nonfood  expenditure  equivalent  to  2/3  of  food  expenditure \n(Reference: Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. 2005. Viet Nam Achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Hanoi). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5 \n\nwives,  women  are  most  commonly  the  carers  or  financial  supporters  for  those  infected  with \nHIV/AIDS and, as such, experience an uneven share of the financial and physical burdens. \n \n19. \nIt is equally important to understand and address the role that men play in the spread \nof the epidemic. Vietnamese men are more likely to use drugs and to visit sex workers and to \nmake the decisions regarding condom use in their relations with sex workers, casual partners, \ngirlfriends,  and  wives.  Social  activities  outside  the  home  frequently  involve  alcohol  which  is \nclosely  associated  with  high-risk  behavior.  Men  are  also  more  likely  to  be  identified  as \nunemployed and to work in high-risk settings such as construction sites.  \n \n20. \nStigma  and  Discrimination.  Stigma  and  discrimination  against  those  infected  or \nengaged in the high-risk behaviors that lead to infection play an insidious role in the spread of \nHIV/AIDS.  Where  there  is  stigma  and  discrimination  people  are  unlikely  to  seek  testing  to \nascertain their infection status or other services that reduce their risk of infecting others. Stigma \nand discrimination often stem from poor or incorrect knowledge about the spread of HIV/AIDS. \nIn  Viet  Nam,  the  association  of  HIV/AIDS  with  the  Government\u2019s  \u201csocial  evils\u201d  policy  (that \nincorporates  drug  use  and  prostitution)  exacerbates  stigma  and  discrimination,  even  though  a \ngrowing  number  of  those  infected  will  have  no  direct  association  with  these  behaviors  (e.g., \nwomen  infected  by  their  husbands,  children  of  infected  women).  Stigma  and  discrimination \nagainst  those  infected,  particularly  in  areas  of  employment  and  access  to  health  care,  have \nbeen reported and they often extend to family members. \n \n21. \nHIV/AIDS and Poverty. HIV/AIDS and poverty are inextricably linked. Poor people are \nmore likely to be vulnerable or disempowered to protect themselves from the high-risk behaviors \nthat lead to infection (e.g., migration, unemployment, and sex work) while people who become \ninfected  face  an  increased  risk  of  falling  into  poverty  along  with  their  families.  A  study  in  Viet \nNam  has  shown  that  the  health  care  expenditure  of  households  with  a  PLWHA  is  13  times \ngreater  than  the  average  household\u2019s  health  spending.8 The  same  study  found  that  18%  of \nPLWHAs  experience  reduced  income  when  their  status  became  known,  while  50%  gave  up \nwork,  either  because  of  disability  due  to  the  illness  or  because  of  stigma  and  discrimination. \nPeople who care for the sick, usually women, are also at increased risk of poverty because of \nunemployment  and  associated  costs.  At  a  macro  level,  international  experience  shows  that \npoverty improvement rates will slow in countries with growing epidemics. \n \n22. \nYouth  and  HIV/AIDS.  Young  people  represent  the  reservoir  from  which  those  most \nlikely to become vulnerable and adopt high-risk behaviors will come. Strategies for targeting the \nattitudes  and  behaviors  of  young  people\u2014whether  for  commercial  or  social  purposes\u2014are \nunique and evidence from a range of sectors show  they can be effectively developed for high \nimpact. This is the challenge and rationale for targeting youth in HIV/AIDS prevention efforts.  \n \n23. \nIn order to target youth for HIV/AIDS prevention effectively, it is important to distinguish \nbetween the different situations of young people and their risk of HIV/AIDS infection. While an \noverall  goal  of  improving  knowledge  for  behavior  change  will  be  the  same  for  all  groups,  the \nspecific objectives and approaches will differ according to the characteristics of subgroups, their \nsituations and behaviors. The three groups identified for programming purposes are as follows.  \n \n\n(i) \n\nMainstream.  Those  that  could  become  vulnerable  or  high-risk.  They  are  in \nschool  or  employed  with  a  reasonable  salary  and  have  good  family  and \ncommunity support structures and social connectedness. The challenge with this \ngroup is to identify and reinforce the \u201cprotective\u201d factors that reduce their overall \n\n                                                 \n8  UNDP. 2004. Impact of HIV/AIDS on Household Vulnerability and Poverty in Viet Nam. Hanoi. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nlifetime  HIV/AIDS  risk  profile.  As  with  many  public  health  interventions,  primary \nprevention for this group would have significant economic benefits, as the cost of \ninterventions is relatively low.  \nVulnerable.  Those  in  a  situation  that  makes  them  vulnerable  to  adopting  high-\nrisk behaviors. It includes school dropouts, the unemployed or poorly employed, \nmigrant youth, youth living in poverty, and homeless youth. Particular industries \nsuch  as  tourism,  shipping,  and  construction  are  particularly  attractive  to  young \npeople, yet they can place them in situations where they are more likely to adopt \nhigh-risk behaviors.  \nHigh-risk.  Those  already  engaging  in  unprotected  sex  with  multiple  partners \nand/or sex workers and/or injecting drug users who share needles. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n2. \n\nOpportunities \n\n24. \nApproaches  to  HIV  prevention  in  Viet  Nam  have  been  largely  based  on  IEC  that \nprovides general awareness information for general audiences, rather than targeted messaging \nfor behavior change in specific groups. The IEC approach has led to high levels of awareness \nand  some  knowledge  about  HIV  transmission,  although  this  is  often  incomplete  or  incorrect. \nWith  high  levels  of  awareness  and knowledge having  been  achieved,  international  experience \nshows  that,  at  this  stage  in  the  continuum  of  knowledge  development,  the  approach  needs  to \nchange  to  a  focus  on  IEC  that  promotes  attitudinal  and  behavior  change  among  the  target \ngroups (youth) and their social environment (family, teachers, and community leaders). To date, \na long-term, national behavior change communication (BCC) program for HIV/AIDS prevention \nhas not been implemented in Viet Nam. \n \n25. \nEffective BCC should be based on research that identifies the obstacles and motivators \nto behavior change among the target audience. For HIV/AIDS prevention, messages need to be \ntargeted at vulnerable youth in ways that motivate individuals to consider and change their own \nbehaviors  and  attitudes.  The  \u201center-educate\u201d  model  has  been  developed  and  practiced  for \nHIV/AIDS  programs  in  several  international  settings  and  has  had  positive  impact  evaluation \nresults (Appendix 3). Combining \u201centertainment\u201d with \u201ceducation\u201d, the approach aims to attract \nand hold the attention of the audience by engaging its emotions while enhancing knowledge and \nskills so that informed choices can be made.  \n \n26. \nHIV/AIDS programs supported by international agencies in Viet Nam:  \n\nOther  Funding  and  International  Agency  Programs. There are currently four large \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nthe  Department  for  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom  (DFID),  in \nassociation  with  Norwegian  Aid  and  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  have \nprovided financing and technical support for a program focused on harm reduction, \nmanagement, and care of STIs;  \nfinancing from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (the Global \nFund),  is  directed  towards  care  and  support  for  PLWHA,  testing,  and  prevention  of \nmother-to-child transmission;  \nthe  United States\u2019  President\u2019s  Emergency  Plan  for  AIDS  Relief  (PEPFAR)  provides  \nfinancing for HIV treatment as well targeted programs for high-risk behaviors; and  \na  World  Bank  project  is  focused  on  harm  reduction,  rehabilitation,  care,  and \ntreatment for IDUs and sex workers with an extensive program of activities planned \nfor two cities and 18 provinces.  \n\n \n27. \nThere  are  also  many  HIV/AIDS  activities  supported  and/or  implemented  by  bilateral \nand nongovernment organizations (NGOs) underway in Viet Nam, but most are relatively small, \ntheir  activities  take  place  in  a  few  provinces,  and  are  they  tend  to  target  groups  with  high-risk \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7 \n\nbehaviors  (e.g.,  IDUs  and  sex  workers).  More  information  on  these  programs  is  provided  in \nAppendix  4.  While  many  of  these  projects  contain  some  BCC  activities,  none  has  a  specific \nyouth  focus\u2014a  gap  that  has  been  recognized  by  the  Government  and  technical  support \nagencies such as the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) in their reviews \nof current programs in Viet Nam. \n \n28. \nThe  Funding  Gap.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  national  HIV/AIDS  strategy  identifies  the  need  to \nmobilize more funding sources for HIV/AIDS prevention and control and estimates that annual \nexpenditure  by  2010  should  be  approximately  $300  million.  The  Government\u2019s  budget  for \nHIV/AIDS prevention programs in 2003 was $4.4 million. This had risen to $5.6 million in 2005 \nbut remained well short of the amount needed. The annual value of funding agency programs is \ndifficult  to  estimate,  given  the  dynamic  nature  of  the  sector.  However,  it  is  recognized  that \ncurrent and proposed funding agency assistance will not fill the gap between estimated needs \nand  government  resources.  The  Government\u2019s  budget  in  2006  is  about  $6 million  and  it  is \nestimated that funding agency resources from the four major projects (DFID, the Global Fund, \nPEPFAR, and the World Bank) will contribute about $40 million. At $20 million, or $4 million per \nyear  for  5  years,  the  ADB-financed  project  can  make  a  contribution  to  filling  the  remaining \nfunding gap. \n \nADB\u2019s  Strategic  Directions  for  HIV/AIDS.9 In  2005,  ADB  adopted  its  first  strategic \n29. \nframework. This provides guidance on assisting ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs) to \nfight  HIV/AIDS.  The  framework  states  that  goal  of  ADB\u2019s  activities  will be  to  support  DMCs  to \nachieve  Target  7  of  MDG  6:  \u201cto  have  halted  by  2015  and  begun  to  reverse  the  spread  of \nHIV/AIDS\u201d. It notes that ADB will pursue this goal with the objective of mitigating the potential \nimpact of HIV/AIDS on social development and poverty reduction. Three priority areas of action \nare identified: (i) support to strengthen the capacity and role of regional leaders in addressing \nHIV/AIDS; (ii) capacity building at the country and regional levels to address HIV/AIDS; and (iii) \nHIV/AIDS  interventions  that  target  the  poor  and  vulnerable.  It  is  on  this  basis  that  ADB  now \nplans HIV/AIDS-related projects and technical assistance for its DMCs.  \n \n30. \nADB\u2019s  Opportunity.  It  is  clearly  understood  that  the  poor  and  almost  poor  are  more \nvulnerable  to,  and  affected  economically  by,  HIV/AIDS  infection.  The  prevention  programs \ndisproportionately  benefit  the  poor,  so  there  is  a  clear  case  for  ADB  attention.  Moreover,  with \nthe  availability  of  grant  funding  for  HIV/AIDS  and  experience  in  Viet  Nam,  particularly  with \nseveral health and HIV/AIDS projects, there is an important and appropriate opportunity for ADB \nto contribute to implementation of the national HIV/AIDS strategy and to reduce the burden of \ndisease caused by HIV/AIDS. This proposed Project complements the activities of current ADB \nprojects  such  as  the  Regional  Communicable  Disease  Control  Project 10 and  builds  on  the \nexperience of previous projects such as the Community Action for Preventing HIV/AIDS funded \nby the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR).11 The proposal to target youth is in line with \nADB\u2019s  strategic  framework  and  fills  an  identified  gap  in  the  support  available  for  the  national \nHIV/AIDS strategy and for Viet Nam\u2019s achievement of its HIV/AIDS-related development goal.12 \n \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2005.

Analyses show that successful approaches include the following common features: \nensure youth have access to comprehensive health education and reproductive \nhealth  services  (including  voluntary  counseling  and  testing  for  HIV/AIDS),  that \nare available where and when youth will access them;  \ntarget  parents,  teachers,  and  leaders  who  influence  young  people,  since  youth \nact more responsibly and develop self-esteem when such adults offer good role \nmodels, affirming relationships and safe environments;  \nmobilize  the  education  system  to  become  a  vehicle  for  a  comprehensive \nprevention education programs for school-age youth; \nintegrate  HIV/AIDS  prevention  messages  into  a  range  of  venues  frequented  by \nyouth including clubs, religious groups, sports, and workplaces; \naddress  gender  disparities  by  improving  opportunities  for  girls\u2019  education  and \nemployment  as  well  as  by  addressing  concepts  of  masculinity  that  lead  young \nmen to risk behaviors; and   \nopen  dialogue  on  sensitive  issues  so  that  adults  and  youth  work  together  on \nissues of sexuality, sexual health education, sexual violence and abuse, gender \nroles, and cultural practices in culturally acceptable ways. \n\n(vi) \n\n(iv) \n\n(iii) \n\n(v) \n\n \n32. \nInternational  funding  agency  assistance  for  HIV/AIDS  in  Viet  Nam  has  increased \nrapidly  in  recent  years  and,  while  no  major  project  has  been  completed  and  evaluated,  some \nkey  lessons  have  started  to  emerge.  Until the  development  of  this  proposed  Project,  all  major \nprojects  have  worked  with  MOH  which  has  centralized  and,  at  times,  slowed  implementation. \nThe  Government  has  started  to  address  this  limitation  by  upgrading  the  status  of  the \nadministration  within  MOH  (creating  the  VAAC)  and  by  promoting  funding  agency  support  for \nHIV/AIDS  through  other  Government  ministries  and  bodies.  Attention  to  the  capacity  of \nexecuting and implementing agencies is critical for effective and timely project implementation. \nMost  international  assistance  has  focused  on  high-risk  behaviors  and  groups.  While  scale-up \nand replication of efforts is widely called for, without information and capacity it is difficult to do \nmore on these fronts at this stage. \n \n33. \nADB  has  experience  with  several  technical  assistance  (TA)  projects  focused  on \nHIV/AIDS prevention in Viet Nam and the Mekong region. Lessons learned from these projects \ninclude (i) that HIV/AIDS control is a dynamic sector that requires multisectoral approaches and \ninterdisciplinary  collaboration; 13  (ii)  that  NGOs  can  play  an  important  role  in  facilitating \ncommunity  involvement; 14  (ii)  that  participatory  processes  take  time  to  develop; 15  (iii)  that \neducation can play an important role in changing  attitudes and altering practices; and (iv) that \nmultifaceted media programs improve dissemination.16 The JFPR-supported project (footnote 9) \nin  particular  provided  lessons  on  the  importance  of  comprehensive  approaches  to  HIV/AIDS \nprevention at the decentralized, provincial level. \n \n\n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2002.

The need for a \nstrong,  proactive,  partner  agency  is  clear.  It  is  important  to  understand  and  work  with \ngovernment procedures and integrate them into project design and implementation. High-quality \ntechnical  assistance  in  the  form  of  consultants  can  provide  useful  support  for  efficient  project \nimplementation.  Project  design  should  account  for  decentralized  governance  with  the \nappropriate division of actions between central and local authorities. ADB experience elsewhere \nin the health sector demonstrates that government investment in national strategies and master \nplans  (such  as  the  national  HIV/AIDS  strategy)  is  indicative  of  significant  national  ownership. \nProjects  should  align  their  objectives  to  existing  national  priorities  and  take  advantage  of  the \nimportant consensus-building process that goes into preparing government strategies. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n35. \nThe  project  design  is  based  on  an  extensive  review  of  the  needs,  current  portfolio  of \nfunding agency assistance, and identified gaps in the context of the national HIV/AIDS strategy. \nThe  Project  was  developed  through  extensive  consultation  with  the  VCPFC,  MOH,  provincial \nauthorities, and development partners. \n \nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n36. \nThe ultimate goal of the Project is to help Viet Nam achieve target 7 of MDG 6: to have \nhalted by 2015 and begun to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS. To achieve this, the Project aims \nto  reduce  the  HIV/AIDS  infection  risk  among  young  people  by  assisting  the  Government  to \nimplement  a  comprehensive  youth-focused  behavior  change  communication  program.  More \nspecifically,  the  Project  seeks  to  (i)  increase  condom  use,  especially  for  high-risk  sex;  (ii) \nincrease  the  proportion  of  young  people  identifying  a  formal  source  of  condoms;  (iii)  increase \nthe  proportion  of  young  people  15\u201324  years  of  age  with  comprehensive  correct  knowledge  of \nHIV/AIDS; and (iv) reduce needle-sharing among IDUs in targeted provinces. \n \n37. \nA  comprehensive  and  youth-focused  mass  media  campaign  is  the  centerpiece  of  the \nProject. Incorporating television, radio, and print media, the campaign will aim to reduce risk and \nprevent infection for youth and their families. The campaign will be complemented by activities \nfocused on leadership support for HIV/AIDS prevention with a youth focus, as proposed under \nthe  national  HIV/AIDS  strategy,  as  well  as  a  comprehensive  program  of  community-based \nactivities  at  the  provincial  level.  Provincial  activities  will  include  services  for  youth  in  high-risk \nsituations (drug use and sex work) as well as information campaigns focused on youth who are \nvulnerable  by  nature  of  their  work  or  personal  circumstances  (e.g.,  migrants,  unemployed, \nemployed  in  the  growing  industrial  zones).  Province-based  activities  will  also  include  a \ncommunication  program  targeted  at  families,  particularly  parents,  with  the  goal  of  creating \nhealthy  environments  for  youth  where  they  can  receive  support  that  will  reduce  their  HIV \nvulnerability.  Leadership  and  community-focused  activities  will  all  be  based  on,  and  aligned \nwith, the mass media campaign messages to enhance resonance and effectiveness. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n38. \nThe  Project  is  designed  to  deliver  four  specific  outputs:  (i) a  more  effective  policy \nenvironment  for  a  youth  focus  in  implementing  the  national  HIV/AIDS  strategy;  (ii)  more \nknowledge sharing in relation to HIV/AIDS risks and prevention and associated issues for youth; \n(iii)  increased  access  by  youth  to  HIV  harm  reduction  and  prevention  education  programs  in \nproject  provinces;  and  (iv)  a  stronger  capacity  of  VCPFC  to  monitor  and  evaluate  progress  in \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\ndelivering the outputs, and to design and implement programs to continue building its capacity. \nIn line with these outputs, the scope of the Project is divided into the following four components. \n \n\n1. \n\nLeadership and Strategy Support \n\n39. \nThe  Project  will  support  targeted  research  and  advocacy  to  leaders  at  all  levels  on \nyouth  issues,  youth  participation  mechanisms,  and  the  mainstreaming  of  youth  issues  into \npolicy, projects, and service providers. Advocacy activities will target a broad range of leaders, \nincluding  party  and  government  officials  from  national,  provincial,  and  community  levels,  to \nincrease  their  awareness  and  support  for  youth  issues  in  relation  to  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and \nthe  overall  implementation  of  the  national  HIV/AIDS  strategy.  Specific  activities  will  include  (i) \nsupport for the second Survey Assessment of Vietnamese Youth (SAVY), which follows the first \nsurvey in 2003, and other studies, together with dissemination workshops; (ii) the development \nand dissemination of materials targeted at leaders on youth issues; (iii) policy maker forums and \nadvocacy meetings at the community level; (iv) support for the participation of youth in national \nand international conferences and workshops; (v) planning workshops with local authorities and \npartners  to  support  the  integration  of  youth  issues  into  a  community  programs;  and  (vi) \ncommune outreach programs by the VCPFC and its provincial partners. The second SAVY will \nprovide  valuable  data  on  a  range  of  issues  relevant  to  the  Project.  There  will  be  a  concerted \neffort to support outreach activities that facilitate integration of the mass media messages and \nyouth themes across other relevant funding agency and government projects and programs. \n \n\n2. \n\nNational Mass Media Program for Behavior Change \n\nComponent 2 will focus on the production of a national mass media behavior change \n40. \ncommunication (BCC) program focused on youth with the aim of effecting changes to personal \nbehaviors  and  attitudes  in  order  to  reduce  the  risk  of  HIV/AIDS  infection.  The  Project  will \nsupport  the  development  and  production  of  a  television  drama  series  that  utilizes  the \n\u201center(tain)-educate\u201d  approach  to  behavior  change. 17  The  drama  series  will  be  broadcast \nnationally,  free-to-air  on  VTV  during  the  prime  viewing  period,  with  at  least  one  repeat  show \nbroadcast  per  week.18 The  series  will  run  over  3  years  and  facilitate  the  mechanism  of  role-\nmodeling,  which  is  a  best-practice  approach  to  promoting  behavior  change  where  there  is \nalready a high level of awareness of the issue at hand (in this case HIV/AIDS).  \n \n41. \nThis drama series will complemented and supported by radio phone-in programs to be \nbroadcast  nationally,  free-to-air  on  VOV  radio  after  each  TV  broadcast  in  order  to  provide \nimmediate feedback on the interpretation and assimilation of messages and the opportunity for \ninteractive  dialogue  for  youth  concerned  about  issues  raised.  The  Project  will  also  support \ncomplementary, youth-focused documentaries, television and radio community message spots \n(footnote 17), and materials for the print media (newspapers, popular youth magazines, etc.).  \n \n42. \nAll  materials  will  be  based  on  comprehensive,  audience-based  research.  The \nentertainment target will be people of all ages, with specific messages to be targeted at young \npeople  and  their  families,  community  members,  and  other  role  models.  Messages  will  aim  to \nenhance  factors  that  protect  against  vulnerability  and  high-risk  behavior  and  to  increase  the \nlikelihood  of  harm  reduction  behaviors  being  adopted  (e.g.,  condom  use).  In  addition,  the  role \n\n                                                 \n17 More than 86% of Vietnamese youth watch TV at least once a week and 50% on a daily basis, and most identify \n\nTV as a key source of information on reproductive health issues. \n\n18 Details  of  the  TV  and  radio  broadcast  agreements  covering  the  timing  of  broadcasts  and  costs  of  community \nmessage spots will be finalized during project implementation, based on Government regulations and recovery of \ncost rates established by the Government. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11 \n\nmodeling  and  messaging  will  aim  to  reduce  the  stigma  and  discrimination,  and  gender \nstereotypes, associated with HIV/AIDS risk.  \n \n\n3. \n\nCommunity-Based HIV/AIDS Prevention Resources for Youth \n\nThe  Project  will  support  NGOs  and  mass  organizations  to  implement  a  program  of \n43. \nprovince-based, youth-focused activities, including community-based advocacy, peer education, \nlife skills training; and improved access to harm-reduction services at the provincial level. This \ncomponent  is  divided  into  three  subcomponents  that  focus  on  different  groups  of  youth \ndepending  on  their  risk  profile:  (i)  youth  in  high-risk  situations  (e.g.,  IDUs,  sex  workers,  and \nclients  of  sex  workers);  (ii)  vulnerable  youth  (e.g.,  because  of  their  migrant,  education,  or \nemployment or economic status); and (iii) mainstream youth (who may currently be at low risk, \nbut whose status can be protected and strengthened). NGOs and mass organizations such as \nthe  Youth  and  Women\u2019s  Unions  will  be  engaged  as  implementing  agencies  because  of  their \nability to reach youth in community settings effectively, especially those at risk, marginalized, or \nstigmatized.  All  messages  and  materials  will  be  based  on,  and  linked  to,  the  themes  and \ncharacters developed for the media campaign.  \n \n44. \nFifteen provinces have been selected for this component, based on a range of criteria \nrelated to youth, HIV/AIDS, poverty, and capacity (Appendix 5).19 Each nominated province will \nprepare an action plan that assesses the particular characteristics of the province\u2019s geography, \npopulation, economic status, and other factors that might affect youth vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. \nA summary of a sample action plan for Phu Tho province is in Appendix 6. \n \n\na. \n\nHarm Reduction Outreach Services \n\n45. \nThis subcomponent targets youth in high-risk situations. It will support comprehensive \nharm  reduction  services  that  provide  condoms,  clean  needles  (for  IDUs),  and  voluntary \ncounseling and testing (VCT) services for early detection and associated behavior change. VCT \nservices  will  be  linked  to,  and  supported  by,  the  local  Department  of  Health.  Services  will  be \nprovided in locations, and at times, that are youth-friendly, especially to those engaging in high-\nrisk  behaviors,  including  IDUs,  sex  workers,  and  those  who  use  sex  workers.  This \nsubcomponent  will  support  peer  education  programs  that  reach  out  to  youth  in  high-risk \nenvironments. NGOs will be contracted to implement this subcomponent. \n \n\nb. \n\nHIV Prevention for Vulnerable Youth \n\nThe focus of this subcomponent will be targeted BCC and interpersonal communication \n46. \n(IPC)  interventions,  including  life  skills  training  and  peer  education,  through  worksites  and \nvocational  training  or  job-recruitment  centers,  in  industrial  zones  and  other  identified  youth-\nfocused  locations.  Programs  will  use  the  IPC  materials  that  are  aimed  at  changing  the \nknowledge, attitudes and practices of vulnerable youth. NGOs will be contracted to implement \nthe peer-education and training activities. \n \n\nc. \n\nPrimary Prevention for Youth and Families \n\n47. \nLife  skills  training  for  mainstream  youth  (i.e.,  those  not  at  immediate  risk  of  HIV \ninfection) and their families on issues surrounding and related to HIV/AIDS risk behaviors will be \nprovided  under  this  subcomponent.  It  will  support  school  programs,  including  curriculum \n\n                                                 \n19 The  provinces  are  (i)  Ha  Noi,  Ha  Tay,  Bac  Ninh,  Phu  Tho,  and  Quang  Ninh  (phase  1);  and  (ii)  Hai  Duong,  Dien \nBien, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue, Da Nang, Binh Duong, Long An, Dong Thap, Can Tho, and Ba Ria-Vung Tau \n(phase 2). \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\ndevelopment  with  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  Training,  and  community-based  collaborator \noutreach  programs  for  families,  in  particular  the  parents  of  young  people.  These  are  primary \nprevention measures aimed at building the resilience of youth and families and enhancing their \ncapacity  to  protect  themselves,  create  supportive  environments,  and  make  choices  that  mean \nthat high-risk behaviors are avoided. The messages will specifically aim to address the stigma, \ndiscrimination,  and  gender  norms  associated  with  HIV/AIDS,  as  well  as  other  common  belief \nstructures that affect risk (such as those associated with condom use). NGOs will conduct train-\nthe-trainer programs to school personnel and community collaborator networks. \n \n\n4. \n\nProject Management, Capacity Building, Monitoring, and Evaluation \n\nthe  capacity  of \n\nThe  Project  will  help  strengthen \n\n48. \nthe  central  and  provincial \nimplementation  units  through  targeted  training  activities.  The  component  will  support  the \nestablishment  of  monitoring  and  evaluation  structures  that  are  complementary  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s  national  HIV/AIDS  monitoring  and  evaluation  framework.  The  Project  will  also \nsupport  the  development  of  youth-focused  indicators  for  HIV/AIDS  monitoring  and  evaluation \nsystems  through  small-scale  studies  that  enhance  the  knowledge  base  from  which  indicators \nand  assessments  are  derived.  The  Project  will  finance  equipment  and  consulting  services \nrequired for effective implementation of project activities at central and provincial levels. \n \nC. \n\nADF IX Grant Component  \n\n49. \nGrant  financing  of  $20  million  is  consistent  with  the  objectives  and  criteria  set  out  for \nutilization  of  the  Asian  Development  Fund  IX  grants  for  HIV/AIDS  and  other  communicable \ndiseases  and  is  justified  at  both  country  and  project  levels.  The  Project  is  aligned  with  Viet \nNam\u2019s  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy  and  directly  supports  ADB\u2019s \ncommitment to reducing poverty and assisting Viet Nam to achieve its development goals. The \nProject will contribute directly to reducing the impact of the growing HIV/AIDS epidemic in Viet \nNam, particularly among young people who will bear the greatest burden both in susceptibility to \ninfection and in the economic costs at the individual and community level.  \n \nD. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nFocus on Youth in the Context of HIV/AIDS \n\n50.  While a lot of lip service is given to the role young people play in the spread of HIV/AIDS \nand the impact it has on them, very few comprehensive intervention programs, in Viet Nam or \nelsewhere,  have  focused  on  this  group  specifically.  Opportunities  have  been  missed  to  bring \ninnovative public health prevention and control measures to bear on the spread of the epidemic \namong  a  group  that  can  be  targeted.  Models  for  healthy  youth  development  have  been \ndeveloped and tested over many years and for different health issues with the general goal of \nreducing  risks  and  enhancing  protective  factors.  The  Project  will  target  youth  directly  and  via \nthose  that  influence  them  such  as  parents,  teachers,  and  popular  entertainment  and  sports \npersonalities. The results will be in areas such as improved family support and dialogue around \nyouth issues, including sexuality and normalizing condom use. \n \n\n2. \n\nFocus on Youth in the Context of HIV/AIDS \n\n51. \nThe Project will support the development and integration of a youth focus across other \nproject  and  program  activities  under  the  national  HIV/AIDS  strategy.  The  Project  will  provide \npolicy  and  capacity  development  support  to  VCPFC  and  VAAC  to  ensure  youth  issues  are \nintegrated in a consistent and effective manner across a range of activities and policy dialogue \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13 \n\nand  coordination  forums.  The  Project  will  also  develop  the  capacity  of  all  HIV/AIDS-related \nmonitoring and evaluation in Viet Nam to assess youth-specific outcomes and impacts. \n \n\n3. \n\nCommunity and Nongovernment Organization Participation \n\n52. \nThe Project calls for engagement with a wide variety of organizations and groups, both \npublic  and  community\u2013based.  The  IPC  activities  will  offer  opportunities  to  build  relationships \nbetween generations, and between civil society organizations (e.g., youth and women\u2019s unions), \ngovernment  agencies,  and  specialist  NGOs.  These  activities  will  contribute  to  building  the \ncapacity to address youth issues and HIV/AIDS and offer new partnership models. There will be \na  focus  on  flexible  approaches  appropriate  to  local  needs.  Skills  development  for  counseling \nand youth communication will contribute to project sustainability. \n \n\n4. \n\nAddressing Gender Issues in HIV/AIDS Prevention \n\n53. \nCurrently 86% of all PLWHA in Viet Nam are male, largely because most IDUs are male. \nHowever, most sex workers are young women, and there are growing infection rates among these \nwomen  through  their  clients  and  boyfriends  or  husbands.  Employment  opportunities  in  the \nentertainment  industry,  especially  for  women,  are  growing  and  they  are  particularly  attracting \nwomen  who  have  migrated  from  rural  areas.  Gender  roles  create  different  risks  for  young  men \nand young women, and these roles endure across generations and socioeconomic strata. Mass \nmedia materials will aim to address the gender norms that affect HIV risk through messages and \nrole model behaviors. The gender strategy (Appendix 7) addresses these issues in more detail.  \n \n\n5. \n\nAddressing the Role of Migration and Mobility in HIV/AIDS Prevention \n\n54. \nYouth  aged  20\u201324  comprise  the  largest  group  of  a  growing  population  of  mobile \nworkers  traveling  within  Viet  Nam  and  across  borders  to  seek  work.  Large  infrastructure \nprojects, including those that ADB finances, attract large numbers of young men and women as \nworkers (construction and unskilled labor and associated service industries, including sex work). \nWhile  migration  offers  economic  opportunities  for  many,  it  increases  the  risk  of  HIV  infections \nbecause of (i) improved cash resources; (ii) isolation from family and other social structures that \nexert  \u201cpositive\u201d  peer  pressures;  and  (iii)  access  to  alcohol,  drugs,  and  commercial  sex.  In \nprovinces,  where  there  are  large  migrant  or  mobile  youth  populations,  project  activities  will \ntarget this group through worksites, vocational training, or job recruitment centers.  \n \nE. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n55. \nThe Project is estimated to cost $26.7 million equivalent (Table 1). Of this, $3.73 million \nequivalent  (14%)  is  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $22.97  million  equivalent  (86%)  local  currency \ncost.  The  cost  estimates  include  $1.1  million  in  taxes  and  duties  and  8.6%  of  total  costs  for \ncontingencies. A summary of cost estimates is in Table 1, and further details are in Appendix 8.  \n \nF. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nThe Government has requested a grant of $20 million from ADB's Asian Development \n56. \nFund (ADF) for the control of HIV/AIDS and infectious diseases to help finance the Project. The \ngrant will finance all of the foreign exchange costs and $16.27 million of the local currency cost. \nThe Government will provide counterpart funds of $6.7 million equivalent for taxes and recurrent \ncosts.20 The indicative financing plan is in Table 2. \n                                                 \n20 ADB\u2019s appraisal mission reviewed the government\u2019s financing plan and found it to be credible and well supported \n\nby central agencies and provincial authorities. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nAmounts \n\nItem \n\nA. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nBase Costb \n1.

Strengthening  Viet  Nam\u2019s  capacity  and  resources  for  responding  to  HIV/AIDS  is  a \ngovernment priority given the humanitarian and economic costs of a rapidly spreading epidemic. \nWhile  the  Government  has  committed  additional  resources  for  the  implementation  of  a \ncomprehensive  response,  a  financing  gap  exists  even  when  other  international  aid  support  is \naccounted for. Effective responses must be local and engage communities, thus requiring local \nexpenditure. A higher percentage of local financing for this Project is consistent with ADB policy. \n \n58. \nAlthough  no  cofinancing  is  envisioned  at  this  time,  cofinancing  from  both  public  and \ncommercial  sources  may  be  mobilized  in  future  to  complement  ADB  financing.  Cofinancing \narrangements  will  be  presented  for  Government  and  ADB  consideration  as  necessary.  The \nGovernment  has  committed \nto  ensure  early \nimplementation of the Project.  \n \nG. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nto  providing  counterpart \n\nfunds  promptly \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nVCPFC  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA).  A  PMU,  located  within  VCPFC,  will  work \n59. \nunder  the  overall  guidance  of  a  project  steering  committee.  The  steering  committee  will  (i) \nprovide  guidance  to  ensure  timely  and  effective  performance  of  the  Project,  and  (ii)  supervise \nstrategic planning and review and propose modifications and changes to project implementation \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15 \n\nas necessary. The steering committee will be chaired by the leader of VCPFC (Minister or Vice \nMinister)  and  members  will  include  senior  officials  from  the  participating  ministries  and \norganizations,  including  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment,  the  Ministry  of  Culture  and \nInformation, the Ministry of Education and Training, the Ministry of Finance, the State Bank of \nViet  Nam,  the  VAAC  of  MOH,  the  Youth  Union,  the  Women\u2019s  Union,  VTV,  VOV  and  the \nFarmers\u2019 Union.  \n \n60. \nThe PMU will coordinate national and provincial activities, and serve as a liaison point \nbetween  the  provinces,  VCPFC,  and  ADB.  A  project  director  will  head  the  PMU,  with  the \nsupport  of  a  vice  director  and  at  least  six  full-time  staff  to  provide  technical  expertise  and \nadministrative  support  in  areas  of accounting, contract  administration,  disbursement,  planning, \nand procurement. Appendix 9 shows the project management and implementation structure. \n \nA  provincial  project  management  unit  (PPMU)  will  be  established  by  the  Provincial \n61. \nCommittee  for  Population  Family  and  Children  (PCPFC)  for  each  subproject,  with  a  director, \naccountant,  and  component  activity  coordinator(s).  Each  PPMU  will  (i)  oversee \nthe \nimplementation  of  all  subproject  activities  by  NGOs  and  other  mass  organizations,  (ii)  monitor \nand evaluate province-based project activities to ensure the quality of project outputs, and (iii) \nreport to the PMU. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period and Schedule \n\n62. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years  from  about  July  2006  to  July  2011. \nProvincial activities will be implemented in two phases: (i) phase 1 (2006\u20132008) will involve the \nimplementation  of  five  provincial  action  plans,  and  (ii)  phase  2  (2008\u20132011)  will  incorporate \nlessons learned from phase 1 into the action plans for the 10 additional provinces for a total of \n15. Workshops and cross-provincial visits will facilitate the links and sharing of lessons learned \nbetween phases and provinces. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n63. \nAll ADB-financed procurement will be in accordance with ADB Procurement Guidelines. \nLimited international bidding (LIB) or national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures will be used \nwhile  shopping  will  be  used  for  goods  costing  not  more  than  $150,000  and  works  costing  not \nmore  than  $100,000.  The  PMU  will  handle  all  procurement  using  LIB  or  NCB.  Shopping \nprocedures may be used by the provinces, to be supervised by the PMU. The project does not \nsupport civil works. The Government and ADB have agreed upon the methods of procurement \nand selection of consulting services as outlined in the indicative procurement plan (PP) set out \nin  Appendix  11.  As  the  project  was  processed  under  the  former  Guidelines,  there  was \ninsufficient time for the government to approve the PP as required by the new Guidelines. The \ngovernment will expedite approval of the PP and no procurement activity will commence under \nthe project until a PP acceptable to ADB, is approved. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nThe  Project  will  require  54  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  360 \n64. \nperson-months  of  domestic  consulting  services.  Three \ninternational  and  34  domestic \nconsultants  (including  two  for  each  province)  will  be  contracted  as  individual  consultants.  An \ninternational media agency will be recruited as a firm to provide technical assistance inputs and \noversee production of the mass media component. The firm will be selected using ADB quality-\nbased  selection  methods,  as  the  quality  of  the  services  is  of  overriding  importance  for  the \ndownstream  impact  and  outcome  of  the  Project.  There  will  be  single  source  selection  of  the \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nWorld  Health  Organization  (WHO)  for  the  provision  of  youth  and  HIV/AIDS  policy  expertise \nbecause of WHO\u2019s shared objectives and experience of exceptional worth. NGOs, international \nand/or  local  and  including  mass  organizations,  will  be  contracted  to  provide  harm  reduction, \npeer education, and life skills training programs under component 3. Individual consultants, the \nconsulting firm, and the NGOs will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof  Consultants.  Appendix  11  summarizes  the  consulting  services  inputs  and  methods  of \nselection, and provides details on contracting of NGOs (including mass organizations). \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n65. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) was explained to and discussed with the Government \nand  VCPFC.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  VCPFC  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n66. \nThe  PMU  will  use  ADB  imprest  account  procedures  for  eligible  project  expenditures. \nAn  imprest  account  for  the  grant  will  be  established  by  the  PMU  at  a  commercial  bank, \nacceptable to ADB, within 1 month of grant effectiveness. The account will have a ceiling of $1 \nmillion;  the  initial  deposit  will  be  based  on  estimated  expenditures  for  the  first  6  months  of \nproject  implementation  or  $1  million,  whichever  is  lower.  Second  generation  imprest  accounts \n(SGIAs)  will  be  established  by  PPMUs  at  the  Provincial  Treasury.21 The  initial  deposit  will  be \nbased  on  estimated  expenditures  for  the  first  6  months  of  project  implementation  or  $50,000, \nwhichever is lower. The imprest account and SGIAs will be established, managed, replenished, \nand liquidated in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, as amended from \ntime to time, and detailed arrangements agreed upon by the Government and ADB. Statement \nof  expenditure  procedures  will  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  and  liquidate \nadvances  to  the  imprest  accounts  to  facilitate  project  implementation.  The  maximum  payment \nfor any individual item using statement of expenditure is $100,000 per payment.  \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Anticorruption \n\n67. \nVCPFC  has  implemented  a  number  of  similar  projects  financed  by  ADB  and  others \nduring  the  past  10  years  and  its  financial  management  capacity  is  considered  adequate.  \nVCPFC  will  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project  implementation  within  30 \ndays  of  each  calendar  quarter  period.  Progress  reports  will  be  in  English  and  will  include \ninformation on disbursement and the status of all implementation on all aspects of the Project. \n \n68. \nThe Government, acting through VCPFC, will maintain accounts and records showing \na  clear  link  between  activities  and  expenditures  related  to  the  Project.  The  PMU  will  (i)  keep \nproject accounts separate from regular accounts; (ii) ensure accounts and financial statements \n\n                                                 \n21 Second-generation  imprest  accounts  are  considered  appropriate  for  the  Project,  where  PPMU  financial \nmanagement  capacity  can  be  verified,  given  (i)  the  geographical  disbursement  of  project  provinces,  (ii)  the  large \nnumber of small-scale training and outreach activities that PPMUs will manage, and (iii) the fact that such accounts \nwill  be  established  in  the  Provincial  Treasury  ensuring  efficient  management.  Under  recent  amendments  to  the \nGovernment of Viet Nam procedures, such accounts can be audited. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17 \n\nare  audited  annually  in  a  timely  fashion,  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles,  by \nexternal auditors acceptable to ADB; and (iii) submit to ADB, not later than 6 months after the \nclose  of  each  fiscal  year,  certified  copies  of  audited  project  accounts,  including  all  imprest \naccounts, statement of expenditure, and financial statements; and the auditor\u2019s reports, together \nwith  a  report  of  actions  taken  by  VCPFC  to  improve  the  financial  management  system.  The \nProject will finance the cost of independent and external auditing.22\n \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nMonitoring  and  evaluation  of  HIV/AIDS-related  programs  and  projects  are  a  key \n69. \nchallenge  for  the  Government.  There  has  been  significant  technical  expertise  directed  at \nestablishing  a  national  monitoring  and  evaluation  system,  supported  by  the  World  Bank \nHIV/AIDS project. It is expected that all internationally supported projects will utilize a common \nset  of  monitoring  indicators.  While  the  framework  for  Viet  Nam  is  still  to  be  finalized,  the \nmeasures  indicated  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  1)  are  consistent  with \nthe most up-to-date draft. The Project will also support some ongoing analysis of data to further \ndevelop and refine youth- and BCC-related measures, both as an input to refining the design of \nthis Project and for adoption in other activities, including the Government\u2019s national system. The \nPMU will work with the PPMUs to ensure that timely and effective data collection systems are in \nplace and that information collected is analyzed and used to refine project activities through the \ncourse of implementation. All data will be disaggregated by gender and ethnicity. \n \n\n9. \n\nReporting \n\n70. \nPrior  to  grant  effectiveness,  VCPFC  will  submit  monthly  reports  to  ADB  on  the  steps \nbeing  taken  for  achieving  effectiveness.  After  the  Project  becomes  effective,  VCPFC  will \nprepare a quarterly progress report summarizing (i) progress made against established targets; \n(ii) delays and problems encountered, and actions taken to resolve issues; (iii) compliance with \ngrant  covenants;  (iv)  proposed  program  of  activities  for  the  next  6  months;  (v)  expected \nprogress during the succeeding period; and (vi) status of provincial activities. Within 3 months of \nproject completion, the Government will prepare and submit a project completion report to ADB. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n71. \nThe Government and ADB will conduct periodic reviews of the Project to ensure smooth \nimplementation.  The  Government  and  ADB  will  jointly  undertake  a  phase  1  review  after  18 \nmonths of implementation. The review will focus on the experience of implementation in the five \nphase 1 provinces in order to review and enhance phase 2 activities. The Government and ADB \nwill  conduct  a  midterm  review  after  30  months  of  implementation.  Given  the  coordination  role \nplayed  by  the  VAAC  of  MOH  for  Viet  Nam\u2019s  national  HIV/AIDS  strategy,  all  reports  will  be \nshared and participation in review missions will be invited. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n72. \nIt  is  estimated  that  the  Project  will  result  in  the  avoidance  of  more  than  34,000  HIV \ninfections over a 20-year period. The savings of individuals, communities, and governments will \nbenefit, the growth in infection rates will be contained, and individuals will lead more productive \nand healthy lives. Financial, technical and social risks can be addressed. The summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 12. \n                                                 \n22 ADB. 2002.

Guidelines \nfor the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by the Asian Development Bank. \nManila. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n73. \nThe  Project  will  generate  significant  economic  benefits  by  reducing  the  losses \nassociated with HIV infection at the individual, household, community, and national levels. The \ncosts associated with HIV infection include reduced productivity for the infected person and his \nor  her  carer(s),  health  care  costs  (which  can  be  significant  and  sustained  over  long  periods),  \nand  premature  mortality.  These  benefits  will  be  greater  for  those  who  are  most  vulnerable  to \nHIV  infection  and  its  consequences,  including  the  poor,  young  men,  and  members  of  ethnic \nminorities, as well as mobile youth and youth working in particular industries (e.g., tourism and  \ntransport).  There  will  be  economic  benefits  to  communities  at  the  local  and  national  levels \nthrough  (i)  reduced  public  health  care  costs,  and  (ii)  greater  poverty  improvements  which  are \ndirectly affected by growing HIV/AIDS epidemics.  \n \nB. \n\nSocial Benefits \n\n74. \nThe Project will result in lower HIV infection rates and benefit young people who would \nhave  been  infected  had  they  not  been  educated  about  behavioral  options  and  given  the \nresources to change their behaviors (e.g., access to HIV testing, condoms, and clean needles). \nBenefits will extend to the partners and families of people who might have been infected, as the \nsubsequent risk of infection and cost of care and lost productivity is removed. Among all young \npeople, project benefits will be greater for those practicing high-risk behaviors (unsafe sex, drug \nuse) and vulnerable youth as they will be targeted by specific project activities. An overall focus \non  reducing  the  stigma  and  discrimination  associated  with  HIV  infection  should  also  provide \nbenefits  to  sex  workers,  IDUs,  PLWHA,  and  their  families,  as  they  try  to  access  services  and \nretain or regain their social and economic activities.  \n \n75. \nWomen  and  girls  will  benefit  from  increased  awareness  about  their  vulnerability  to \ninfection  and  the  role  of  men,  especially  young  men,  in  the  spread  of  the  epidemic.  The  male \nbehaviors  and  power  imbalances  between  men  and  women  that  exacerbate  women\u2019s  HIV \nvulnerability will be addressed through role modeling and increased awareness. Boys and men \nshould benefit from safer sex and reductions in other risky practices. \n \nThere  will  be  benefits  to  ethnic  minority  populations,  as  project  activities,  including \n76. \nmedia programs, will target language and isolation barriers that increase risk. The Project has \nan ethnic minority action framework (Appendix 15) that outlines the actions needed to address \nthe particular risks faced by youth in isolated communities, especially as they migrate. \n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\n77. \nThe Project has some financial, technical, and social risks. Financially, the Project will \nrequire the timely provision of government counterpart funds at the central and provincial levels. \nIn  the  long  term,  the  sustainability  and  ongoing  impact  of  the  project  investments  will  require \ngrowing  government  HIV/AIDS  budgets  and  a  commitment  to  sustaining  programs  that  have \nbeen proven to be effective and a youth focus to HIV prevention. This risk has been addressed \nthrough  the  course  of  project  preparations,  through  regular  consultations  with  the  Ministry  of \nFinance and through written commitments from provincial governments in all proposed project \nprovinces.  \n \nTechnically,  the  Project  will  need  to  have  creative  control  over  media  materials  to \n78. \nensure effective messages are sent on sensitive topics such as youth sexuality, gender norms, \nand drug use. While the national HIV/AIDS strategy identifies this need generally and stipulates \nthat  there  is  government  support  for  these  approaches,  implementation  is  yet  to  be  tested  on \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19 \n\nsuch a large and public scale. The mechanisms for developing and approving media materials \nhave been established and agreed to in the process of project preparation. \n \n79. \nFor  the  television  drama  series  and  associated  materials  to  have  maximum  impact, \nbroadcasting  will  need  to  be  at  peak  viewing  and/or  listening  times.  The  risk  of  not  securing \nsuch  access  has  been  addressed  through  specific  negotiations  with  VTV  and  VOV  radio.  A \nProject assurance section documents the support that both agencies have guaranteed.  \n \n80. \nThe  Project  also  relies  on  the  capacity  of  the  VCPFC  and  provincial  committees  to \ncontract  and  administer  high-quality  NGO  services  for  the  delivery  of  effective  youth-focused \ninterventions.  This  risk  is  mitigated  by  the  resources  committed  to  project  management  and \ncapacity  building  for  PMU  and  PPMU  staff  as  well  as  the  advance  preparations  for  NGO \ncontracting and selection processes (Appendix 12). \n \n81. \nThe  key  social  risk  is  that,  to  achieve  its  goals  and  objective,  the  Project  needs  to \nchange  the  attitudes  and  behaviors  of  youth  as  well  as  the  knowledge  and  attitudes  of  their \ncontextual  environments,  including  those  of  parents,  families,  and  communities.  To  do  this \neffectively, the project activities will have to appropriately and adequately address the sensitive \ncultural and intergenerational issues that affect behavior. The likelihood of success in this area \ncan  be  improved  through  careful  research,  regular  monitoring  of  the  response  to  media \nmessages,  and  appropriate  adjustments.  Training  for,  and  monitoring  of,  NGOs  and  other \nimplementing partners will also be important. \n \n82. \nSustainability is a key concern for all projects. However, the Government\u2019s budget for \nHIV/AIDS  is  increasing  annually  and  it  is  reasonable  to  expect  that  BCC,  mass  media,  and \nyouth  programs  will  benefit  from  this.  The  Project  will  invest  in  capacity  building  for  the \nimplementation  of  future  mass  media  activities  and  in  the  provinces  for  the  implementation  of \ncommunity-based  youth  outreach  programs  (government  agencies  and  NGOs).  The  planned \nmaterials  should  prove  very  popular,  especially  among  young  people,  leading  to  demand  for \nfurther production and broadcasting. \n \n83. \nrequired as the Project does not support civil works. \n \n\nThere should be no adverse physical impact. Land acquisition and resettlement is not \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  VCPFC  have  given  the \n\n84. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i) \n\nImplementation  of  the  National  HIV/AIDS  Law. The Government will ensure that the \nrelevant  implementation  regulations,  particularly  those  related  to  harm  reduction  and \nVCT access, will be issued following passage of the National HIV/AIDS Law23.  \n \nEthnic  minorities.  The  Government  will  ensure  the  ethnic  minority  development \nframework  is  fully  considered  and  applied  to  all  project  activities  and  that  PMU \nmonitoring of provincial activities will address the implementation of specific measures. \n\nGender  strategy.  The  Government  will  ensure  the  Project\u2019s  gender  strategy  is \nimplemented; that targets and design features are incorporated across project activities \nincluding  the  provincial  action  plans  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  indicators.  Equal \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n                                                 \n23 Enactment is expected during the June 2006 National Assembly.  \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\nemployment and access to opportunities, including training, will be provided for men and \nwomen during project implementation. \n\nCounterpart  funds.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  necessary  counterpart  funds \nare provided in a timely manner and that provincial partners make timely submissions for \nannual  budget  requests  and  take  all  other  measures  necessary  for  the  prompt \nappropriation and disbursement of funds during each year of project implementation.  \n\nInvolvement  of  youth  and  PLWHA.  VCPFC  will  ensure  a  process  is  in  place  so  that \nyouth  and  PLWHA  are  consulted  on  a  semi  annual  basis  and  regarding  all  aspects  of \nproject  implementation,  including  planning,  formative  research,  implementation,  and \nevaluation, and reports are submitted to the project steering committee. \n\n \n(vi)  MOH  will  support  community-based  and  youth-accessible  VCT  services.  The \nGovernment will ensure that project-supported community-based counseling and testing \nare authorized and can access Department of Health testing facilities at the district and \nprovincial  levels,  as  well  as  at  regional  confirmation  facility  and  necessary  health  care \nservices  that  may  be  required  following  a  positive  test  result.  The  Government  will \nensure that health services at the provincial and district levels support this approach. \n\n \n(vii)  Contracting  for  service  delivery.  VCPFC  will  ensure  that  selection  of  NGOs  and/or \nmass  organizations  for  service  delivery  at  the  province  level  is  weighted  in  favor  of \nNGOs  and/or  mass  organizations  that  have  existing  operations  in  the  provinces  and \nwhich have proven that they can deliver high-quality services at the community level for \nhigh-risk and vulnerable youth. Usual ADB recruitment procedures will apply. \n\n \n(viii)  Broadcasting  of  national  mass  media  programs.  VTV  will  ensure  that  free-to-air \nbroadcasting  will  be  provided  on  VTV  Channel  One  during  high-rating  television \nbroadcast  times,  together  with  at  least  one  repeat  screening  per  week  for  about  105 \ndrama  shows  produced  under  the  Project  over  a  3-year  period.

While 70% of current infections are found in Sub-Saharan Africa, the large populations of \nAsia may bear a heavy proportion of the global HIV burden in the next decade. The Joint United \nNations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimates that 8.2 million people in Asia, including \n2.3  million  women,  were  living  with  HIV  at  the  end  of  2004.  This  was  an  increased  from  7.2 \nmillion (1.9 million women) in 2002.1 UNAIDS estimates that 1.2 million people became newly \ninfected  in  the  region  in  2004,  and  540,000  people  died  because  of  AIDS.  The  growing \nepidemics  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  India  dominate  the  region\u2019s  statistics. \nCambodia, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, and Thailand have HIV epidemics that have already \nmoved beyond high-risk groups.    \n \nA. \n\nTransmission \n\n2. \nThe  HIV/AIDS  epidemic  in  Asia,  due  largely  to  injecting  drug  use  and  sex  work,  is \ndistinctly different from that in Sub-Saharan Africa. The spread from injecting drug users (IDUs) \nto other population groups often starts with sex workers. As people who are marginalized\u2014often \nwith  similar  illegal  status\u2014IDU  men  often  partner  with  women  who  are  sex  workers,  or \nthemselves become sex workers to support their drug needs. Transmission from sex workers to \ntheir clients is inevitable if condoms are not used. The clients of sex workers are from all parts of \na broader community, single and married, and include mobile workers and men who have sex \nwith  men  who  lead  ostensibly  heterosexual  lives.  Other  sexually  transmitted  infections  (STIs) \nincrease susceptibility to HIV and the current high prevalence of STIs fuels the epidemic.  \n \nB. \n\nRisk Factors for Transmission \n\nintolerance, \n\nMarginalization.  The \n\n3. \nfear,  and  misunderstanding  associated  with \nmarginalized  groups  (most  particularly  IDUs,  sex  workers,  and  men  who  have  sex  with  men) \ncan  become  a  risk  factor  in  itself.  These  groups  are  isolated  from  information,  education,  and \nhealth  care  services,  and  from  the  economic  and  social  security  that  enables  them  to  protect \nthemselves and their partners.  \n \nWeak Health Systems. Poorly functioning health care systems are not only adversely \n4. \naffected by a growing HIV epidemic, but also become a risk factor for the further spread of HIV. \nWithout effective health care system capacity, including capacity to operate safe blood supplies, \ntreat STIs, provide counseling and testing, and prevent mother-to-child-transmission, the risk of \nHIV transmission remains high and grows as infection spreads. \n \n5. \nYouth  and  Vulnerability.  Young  people  between  the  ages  of  15  and  24,  who \nconstitute  approximately  20%  of  Asia's  population,  are  already  seriously  affected  by  the \nHIV/AIDS epidemic. Of those living with HIV in Asia, 22% are between the ages of 15 and 24. \nThe cultural resistance to teaching youth about the realities of sex (and drugs) has been one of \nthe greatest obstacles to protecting the next generation from HIV and other STIs. \n \n6. \nMobility and Migration. In both Asia and Africa, people on the move have proven to \nbe a significant factor in the spread of HIV. When large numbers of men migrate for work, high-\nrisk  behaviors  increase  and  the  spread  of  HIV  is  almost  inevitable  while  women  are  also \nincreasingly on the move. Mobility, as distinct from migration, also increases vulnerability, and \napplies  to  occupational  groups  such  as  truckers,  sailors,  fishermen,  construction  workers, \n\n                                                 \n1   The UNAIDS categorization of Asia comprises ADB\u2019s South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Greater Mekong Subregion \n\ncountries plus the People\u2019s Republic of China.  \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\ntraders, and sex workers moving where opportunities arise. Mines, logging camps, construction \nsites,  ports,  and  other  economic  enclaves  in  which  large  groups  of  men  with  money  can  be \nfound attract women who sell sex. Mobile women, including sex workers, seasonal workers, and \nfactory workers are also in situations of vulnerability. \n \nC. \n\nVietnamese Youth and the Risk of HIV/AIDS \n\n7. \nVietnamese  traditions  place  great  emphasis  on  the  duty  of  children  to  work  and  study \nhard,  serve  parents,  and  the  family  unit.  Increasingly,  these  traditional  approaches  to \nresponsibility and family structure are not working as smoothly as in the past, especially where \nthere  are  strains  due  to  unemployment,  substance  abuse,  and  changing  expectations  and \naspirations.2  \n \nThere  has  been  much  public  discussion  in  Viet  Nam  about  the  roles,  rights,  and \n8. \nresponsibilities of youth. Some of the focus on youth arises because overall social change (both \npositive and negative) is most evident in the behaviors and lifestyles of young people who adapt \nreadily to new technologies, and seek out new experiences with enthusiasm. Youth are highly \nvisible in some of Viet Nam\u2019s fastest-growing sectors, such as tourism and industrial zones, and \nmake up much of the country\u2019s increasing pool of migrant workers. The high proportion of youth \namong  people  living  with  HIV/AIDS  undoubtedly  adds  to  generalized  concerns  about  this \npopulation. \n \n\n1. \n\nKnowledge and Risk Behaviors \n\n9. \nWhile youth make up the greatest number of people living with HIV/AIDS, most do not \nengage  in  risky  practices,  despite  public  perceptions.  A  1999  survey  in  six  provinces  among \n1,500  youth  aged  15\u201322  found  that  just  10%  of  males  and  5%  of  females  reported  having \npremarital sex. The rate among those aged 15\u201319 was 6% in males and 2% in females (versus \n27%  in  boys  and  3%  in  girls  of  this  age  in  Thailand).3  Similar  findings  were  released  recently \nfrom the 2004 baseline survey of the reproductive health initiative for youth in Asia (RHIYA) Viet \nNam  program,  which  assessed  awareness,  attitudes,  practices,  and  behaviors  among  1,390 \nrural  and  urban  respondents  aged  15\u201324  from  11  provinces.  The  survey  found  just  7.6% \nreported having sexual intercourse and that 45% reported not knowing how to use condoms. \n \nA survey assessment of Vietnamese youth (SAVY)4 conducted by the Ministry of Health \n10. \n(MOH) and the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2004 surveyed 7,584 individuals aged 14\u2013\n25 and found just 16 boys and 4 girls aged 14\u201317 years of age that reported ever having had \nsex. Among those aged 18\u201325, 15.4% of males and 2.3% of females reported having had sex, \nwith rates somewhat higher for urban males (19.8%) than for rural males (13.6%). Female rates \nwere  nearly  identical  for  urban  (2.6%)  and  rural  (2.2%)  residents.  The  survey  found  that  just \n0.5% of respondents reported ever having used any illicit drug. However, 42.4% of urban youth \nand  20.8%  of  rural  youth  said  they  knew  someone  who  had  used  drugs,  suggesting  some \nunderreporting of drug use and experimentation. Among urban males, 16.3% aged 22\u201325 said it \nwas easy to access heroin.  \n \n\n                                                 \n2   It  should  also  be  noted  that  there  is  a  growing  interest  in  a  concept  called  \u201cfamily  development\u201d  in  Viet  Nam, \nincluding through the Viet Nam Commission for Population, Family and Children.  \u201cFamily development\u201d overlaps \nto some extent with WHO\u2019s \u201chealthy youth development\u201d in that it recognizes the needs and potential of the family \nunit in the well-being of the individual and the community.  \n\n3   Mensch, B. et al. 2004.

Survey Assessment of Vietnamese Youth (SAVY) with the Government Statistics Office \n\n(GSO). United Nations Children\u2019s Fund Viet Nam and WHO Viet Nam.  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nThe  SAVY  explored  factors  linked  to  potential  HIV  risk,  including  knowledge  and \n11. \nattitudes.  Results  showed  knowledge  of  STIs  was  incomplete,  with  about  two-thirds  of  the \nsample  able  to  identify  only  three:  hepatitis  B,  syphilis,  and  gonorrhea.  Nationally,  97%  had \nheard  of  HIV/AIDS,  and  about  half  had  heard  about  the  disease  from  multiple  sources,  with \nmass  media  named  most  frequently,  followed  by  family  and  professionals  (schools  and  civil \nsociety organizations).  \n \n12. \nJust over half the sample (52%) were assessed as having a high knowledge level about \nHIV, 39% had a medium level, and 9% a low level. SAVY found 85% knew than an HIV positive \nperson could look healthy. About two thirds knew where they could access HIV testing. Nearly \n98% recognized that condoms could prevent transmission, and 96% knew that sharing needles \nshould be avoided.  About 70% thought condoms reduce pleasure and half felt those who carry \nthem might have \u201cimproper relations\u201d.  \n \n13. \nFar  fewer  young  men  (48%)  had  spoken  to  their  family  about  reproductive  health  than \nhad  young  women  (78%),  though  similar  numbers  reported  talking  about  HIV.  The  SAVY \nresearchers  attributed this  to  the  fact  that  HIV is  \u201ca  predominantly  male  issue\u201d  linked  to  drugs \nand sex workers. Overall, 40% claimed they had never heard of homosexuality, and of the 60% \nwho had, 80% said they would not accept a homosexual man as a friend. \n \n\n2. \n\nEducation and Jobs: Addressing Vulnerability  \n\n14.  While literacy rates are very high in Viet Nam (95% for males, 91% for females in 2000) \nand about 95% of youth have attended school, high dropout rates remain a problem, particularly \nin rural areas. Approximately 54% of youth aged 14\u201325 years in rural areas drop out of school \nat  the  lower  secondary level.  The  figure  for  urban  youth  is 39%.  When  the  figures for  primary \nand  secondary  school  dropouts  are  combined,  less  than  30%  of  rural  youth  complete  upper \nsecondary school. In urban areas, just over 50% complete upper secondary. The main reason \ncited for leaving school was the cost of fees.  \n \n15. \nYouth  job  creation  is  a  major  priority  for  Viet  Nam,  where  around  1.4  million  young \npeople  enter  the  labor  market  annually.  The  UN  Country  Assessment  of  2004  highlights  the \ninadequacy  of  opportunities  for  vocational  training  and  tertiary  education,  calling  youth \nunemployment  a  \u201cmissed  opportunity  for  growth  and  a  root  cause  of  social  problems  such  as \ndepression, crime, and alcohol and drug abuse\u201d.5 \n \n16. \nYouth unemployment is estimated at 4\u20138%, but up to 16% in cities. Young women have \nslightly  higher  unemployment  rates,  but  overall,  around  26%  of  youth  are  underemployed.  \nYoung  people  in  Viet  Nam  are  anxious  about  jobs  and  security.  The  SAVY  found  that \napproximately  12%  of  young  people  (15\u201324  years)  were  neither  in  work  nor  school,  and  this \nrose to 28% among married youth. About 64% report that it is difficult to find a job. When asked \nto name their two highest aspirations, employment was named first by the greatest proportion of \nrespondents  (49.6%),  with  23.3%  naming  economic  security.  Less  than  10%  named  overall \nhappiness, a clear indication that economic vulnerability remains a paramount concern. \n \nJob creation and skills development for youth are important elements of an effective HIV \n17. \nprevention  program  in  Viet  Nam.  It  is  estimated  that  thousands  of  young  Vietnamese  women \nare trafficked outside the country each year, particularly into the Cambodia; People\u2019s Republic \nof China; Republic of Korea; Singapore; Taipei,China; and Thailand. This exploitation is linked \nto  poverty,  family  difficulties,  low  education,  and  unemployment,  and  ultimately  to  high-risk \nbehaviors such as drug use and sex work.  \n\n                                                 \n5   United Nations Country Team. 2004.

Changing youth \nbehavior and reducing the chance that youth will undertake risky behaviors in the first place \nrequire information and services to be delivered, with an accurate understanding of the social \ncontext  in  which  young  people  make  decisions.1  Lessons  learned  over  the  past  decade \nindicate  that  many  approaches  are  needed  for  youth  HIV  prevention,  including  (i)  building \nprotection (through skills, knowledge, and safer environments); (ii) targeted communication to \nrisk groups; (iii) providing harm reduction services and hardware (to enable healthy choices); \nand (iv) involving youth as decision makers and partners in implementation.  \n \nA. \n\nApproaches to Youth HIV Prevention \n\n2. \nThe  concept  of  \u201chealthy  youth  development\u201d  is  based  on  the  pillars  of  building \nprotective factors and removing risks. Protective factors include \u201cadults of influence\u201d (parents, \nteachers, and leaders) that (i) express empathy, (ii) are encouraging and affirming, and (iii) \nare not overly critical. Programs that have effectively enhanced protective factors include (i) \nparenting skills training, (ii) participatory teaching methods, and (iii) school\u2013based programs.  \n \n3. \n\u201cLife  skills\u201d  for  healthy  youth  development  and  HIV  prevention  are  specific  and \ninclude:  negotiation,  conflict  resolution,  empathy,  critical  thinking,  decision-making,  and \ncommunication.  These  skills  help  youth  to  build  supportive  respectful  relationships  among \nthemselves and with parents and adults. They contribute to self-esteem and facilitate dispute-\nresolution and the ability to resist both peer and adult pressure to take unnecessary risks.  \n \n4. \nIn addition to the \u201chealthy youth development\u201d and \u201clife skills\u201d concepts, successful \nstrategies  for  youth  HIV  prevention  have  incorporated  a  number  of  common  features \nincluding: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nproviding a policy context that ensures youth can access HIV and reproductive \nhealth  education  and  services  (including  voluntary  counseling  and  testing), \nand are not discriminated against;  \nreaching people who influence young people (parents, teachers, and leaders), \nsince  youth  act  more  responsibly  when  these  adults  offer  good  role  models, \naffirming relationships, and safe environments;  \nsegmenting  programs  by  age  to  meet  the  needs  of  youth  at  different \ndevelopmental stages and in different environments; \n\n(iv)  mobilizing  the  educational  system  to  become  a  vehicle  for  a  comprehensive \n\nprevention and care program for school-age youth; \naddressing gender  factors  such  as  girls\u2019 opportunities  for education  and  jobs \nand concepts of masculinity that lead young men to risky behavior; and   \nopening  the  dialogue  between  adults  and  young  people  on  sensitive  issues, \nincluding  adolescent  sexuality,  sexual  health  education,  sexual  violence  and \nabuse, gender roles, and traditional practices in culturally acceptable ways. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1   World Bank. 2003.

However, evaluations \nincreasingly showed that individuals cannot always make changes, despite their willingness, \ndue  to  the  influence  of  wider  socio-cultural,  economic,  and  environmental  forces.  For \ninstance, knowing about condoms is not enough if access, skills, and partners willing to use \nthem  are  lacking.  Obstacles  to  behavior  change  must  also  be  addressed  through \ncommunications and through actions that change social norms and situations that make risk-\ntaking behaviors more likely.  \n \nin \n6. \nassessments  of  the  social  and  cultural  context  where  behaviors  occur.3  Communication \nmaterials are often developed according to the assumptions of health programmers or based \non  knowledge  from  unrepresentative  samples.  If  messages  do  not  resonate  with  target \ngroups,  they  are  a  waste  of  time  and  money.  Careful,  formative  research,  using  both \nqualitative  and  quantitative  methods,  is  essential  to  provide  understanding  of  target  needs \nand opportunities.  \n \nIndividual  Change.  Most  health \n7. \ncampaigns  aim  for  lasting  behavior  change  in  order  to  see  a  population-level  impact,  but \nbehaviors  are  practiced  on  an  individual  level.  Campaigns  must  persuade  specific  target \ngroups  about  the  actual  benefits  of  behavior  change,  expressed  in  terms  they  understand, \nrather  than  appealing  to  notions  of  community  benefits  (though  these  may  also  strengthen \nthe argument). This means messages must be  \u201ccustomized\u201d to appeal to and captivate the \ntarget group, rather than vague generic messages for everyone; and they also must be easy \nto act upon.4 \n \n8. \nEntertainment\u2013Education. A key approach directed at changing social norms over \ntime  is  the  \u201center-educate\u201d  model  that  inserts  health  or  social  messages  into  popular \nentertainment. This can be achieved by working messages into television dramas, as well as \ncomic  books.  Magazines  and  newspapers  can  also  be  used  for  high  visibility  and  to  reach \nmass  audiences.  Internet\u2013based  activities  offer  further  scope  to  reach  target  groups.  The \nmodel has been used for HIV prevention in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, and South Africa \n(where it used by the local NGO \u201cSoul City\u201d). Evaluation results have shown that the model \nhad  an  impact  in  changing  behavior.  In  India,  calls  to  a  helpline  increased  250%  during  a \nspecific campaign period and the percentage of individuals reporting having used a condom \nin their most recent visit to a sex worker rose from 87% to 92%. As a proxy indicator, retail \nsales of condoms in the \u201cred light\u201d district tripled after the launch of the campaign. Evaluation \nresults  from  South  Africa  showed  significantly  improved  awareness  of  HIV  risks  and \nimproved dialogue in families, especially from parents, on related issues.  \n \n\n                                                 \n2   Family  Health  International.  2004.

After  successful  targeting  of  high-risk \ngroups,  BCC  should  be  extended  to  the  less  vulnerable,  starting  with  people  who  are \nconnected to high-risk populations. Mass population approaches are also needed to enable a \nsupportive environment for prevention activities\u2014especially harm reduction\u2014to reach those \nindividuals  who  were  not  reached  by  the  earlier  approaches.  Figure  A3.1  shows  the \nmechanism  by  which  a  BCC  campaign  for  HIV/AIDS  prevention  can  target  a  number  of \ngroups for a comprehensive prevention effort.  \n \n\nFigure A3.1: A Comprehensive BCC Model for Youth HIV/AIDS Prevention. \n \n\nYouth \n\nHIV Infection \n\nVulnerable Youth\n \nIncluding school \ndropouts, migrants, \nand unemployed  \n\nYouth with High-Risk \nBehaviors \nIncluding IDU, sex \nworkers, and clients of \nsex workers \n\nProtective Factors \n\nIncluding social \nconnectedness, peer \nand family support, and \naccurate knowledge \n\nBehavior Change \n\nIncluding harm-reduction behaviors \nsuch as condom use, clean needles, \nabstinence, and fewer sexual partners \n\nTo Enhance \n\nTo Encourage \n\nBehavior Change Communication Mass Media Campaign  \nIntegrated with linked interpersonal communication materials and programs \n\n \n\nHIV = human immunodeficiency virus, IDU = injecting drug user. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nC. \n\nAn Expanded and Integrated Approach to BCC \n\n10. \nThe  best  BCC  results  are  produced  by  a  \u201csystems  approach\u201d,  which  combines \nmultiple mass media activities with community collaborations, and training that has credibility \nwith target groups. Interpersonal communication (IPC) between peers or between youth and \nthose who influence them enhance and reinforce learning that aims to persuade individuals \nto try new services or behaviors. Using several approaches simultaneously conveys a sense \nof vigor and enables the use of different approaches, which become mutually reinforcing.. \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n31 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE AND COORDINATION IN THE HIV/AIDS SECTOR \n\n \n1. \nSignificant international assistance has been provided to Viet Nam for the fight against \nHIV/AIDS  in  recent  years  but  funding  gaps  remain.  The  national  HIV/AIDS  strategy  estimates \nthat a comprehensive response, including a full range of activities from prevention to care and \ntreatment,  would  cost  $300  million  per  year.  The  Government  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  budget  for \nHIV/AIDS  activities  in  2006  will  be  approximately  $6  million.  This  has  increased  steadily  in \nrecent  years  from  $4.4  million  in  2003  to  $5.6  million  2005.  Combined  with  annual  donor \nresources it is estimated that resources will soon meet up to 50% of the financing needs. \n \n2. \nThe  Government  of  the  United  States  program  is  the  largest  international  aid  program \nfor HIV/AIDS and incorporates the President\u2019s Emergency Fund for AIDS Reduction and other \nfunding sources. It is mainly implemented through US Government agencies (including the US \nCenters for Disease Control [CDC]) and nongovernment organizations (including Family Health \nInternational [FHI]). Viet Nam is the only country in Asia to receive funding from the Emergency \nFund.  Expenditure  in  2005  was  approximately  $25  million  and  it  is  expected  to  be  up  to  $34 \nmillion  in  2006.  Activities  supported  include  (i)  care,  treatment,  and  support  for  PLWHA, \nincluding  antiretroviral  drugs;  (ii)  voluntary  counseling  and  testing  (VCT)  services,  such  as  the \nCDC  Global Aids Program (GAP),  which is supporting services in up to 40 provinces; and (iii) \ntreatments  for  the  prevention  of  mother-to-child  transmission.  US  Government  funding  has \nsome  conditions  that  limit  the  scope  of  some  programs,  including  (i)  constraints  on  the \ndistribution  of  needles  and  syringes,  and  (ii)  the  requirement  to  implement  policies  explicitly \nopposing prostitution and sex trafficking.  \n \n3. \nThe World Bank project, with grant financing of $35 million over 5 years, was approved \nin  2005.  The  project  is  aimed  at  helping  reduce  the  transmission  of  the  disease  within \nvulnerable groups, as well as to the general population. More than 60% of the grant will be used \nto  support  the  design  and  implementation  of  provincial  specific  action  plans  with  block  grants \nprovided  to  18  provinces  and  2  cities.  Special  emphasis  will  be  placed  on  (i)  strengthening \ncapacity  at  national  and  provincial  levels;  and  (ii)  promoting  the  development  of  innovative, \neffective prevention and treatment approaches and models among vulnerable groups. \n \n4. \nThe Preventing HIV/AIDS Project has been funded by the Department for International \nDevelopment  (DFID)  of  the  United  Kingdom  and  the  Norwegian  Agency  for  Development \nCooperation  (NORAD)  since  2003  and  has  a  total  budget  of  approximately  $25  million.  The \nproject  is  managed  and  implemented  by  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  the  World  Health \nOrganization  (WHO)  in  21  provinces.  The  NGO  DKT  International;  the  Ministry  of  Labor, \nIndustry  and  Social  Affairs;  and  the  Ministry  of  Public  Security  also  support  the  project.  It \nprovides  support  for  (i)  national  and  provincial  policy  and  strategy  development;  (ii)  condom \nprovisions,  especially  in  nontraditional  or  high-risk  venues  along  with  social  marketing;  (iii) \nsexually  transmitted  infection  management  support  for  MOH;  and  (iv)  harm  reduction  services \nfor  drug  users.  The  project  had  a  midterm  review  in  2005  and  is  currently  undergoing  some \nrestructuring  in  its  management  and  administration  with  the  goal  of  improving  operational \nefficiency.  \n \nThe Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has made one grant to Viet Nam \n5. \nexplicitly  for  HIV/AIDS  of  $7.5  million  for  strengthening  care,  counseling,  and  support  for \nPLWHA in three pilot provinces (Ho Chi Minh City, An Giang, and Khanh Hoa).  \n \n6. \nby external assistance currently underway in Viet Nam. \n \n\nTable A4.1 summarizes the main features of the four large HIV/AIDS projects supported \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nTable A4: Major Externally Supported Projects for HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam \n \n\nAgency \n\nTarget Groups and/or Activities \n\nDFID and NORAD \nwith WHO \n\nGlobal Fund \n\nUS Government \n(including \nEmergency Fund \nfor AIDS \nReduction) \nWorld Bank \n\nHigh-risk behaviors and/or condom promotion, \nharm reduction, and management and care of \nSTIs \nHigh-risk behaviors and PLWHA and/or care and \nsupport networks, VCT, and PMCT \nHigh risk behaviors and PLWHA and/or care and \nsupport, including ARVs, VCT, and PMCT \n\nSupport for national HIV/AIDS strategy \nimplementation and province activities, including \nharm reduction, rehabilitation, care and/or \ntreatment for residents of rehabilitation centers. \nSome BCC.  \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n25.0 \n\nImplementation \nPeriod \n2003\u20132008 \n\n7.5 \n\n26.5 \n\n2004\u20132006 \n\n2005\u20132006 \n\n35.0 \n\n2005\u20132010 \n\nARV  =  anti-retroviral,  BCC  =  behavior  change  communication,  DFID  =  Development  Fund  for  International \nDevelopment  (of  the  United  Kingdom  Government),  GFATM  =  Global  Fund  for  AIDS,  Tuberculosis  and  Malaria, \nNORAD = Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation, PEPFAR = President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, \nPLWHA = people living with HIV/AIDS, PMCT = prevention of mother to child transmission, STI = sexually transmitted \ninfection, VCT = voluntary counseling and testing, WHO = World Health Organization. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n7. \nOther  bilateral  donors  active  in  HIV/AIDS  include  the  governments  of  Sweden  and \nAustralia.  Sweden\u2019s  International  Development  Agency  and  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgram are providing support for implementation of the national strategy, especially in the area \nof  leadership  and  advocacy.  From  2006  to  2010,  the  project  will  support  training  and \nawareness-raising with the Communist Party of Viet Nam and the integration of HIV/AIDS into \nViet  Nam\u2019s  socioeconomic  development  plan.  Australia,  through  the  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational  Development,  is  supporting  a  regional  HIV/AIDS  project  that  includes  Viet  Nam \nefforts  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  health  and  public  security  sectors,  including  links \nbetween them for promotion of harm reduction as well as to address stigma and discrimination. \n \nIn addition to FHI (para. 2), a number of other NGOs have important HIV/AIDS activities \n8. \nunderway. CARE International has been active in HIV prevention in Viet Nam since 1991. It has \nimplemented behavior change communication activities focused on vulnerable groups, including \ntruck drivers and mobile workers, provided care and support for PLWHA and some micro-credit \nand  vocational  training  schemes.  Marie  Stopes  International  focuses  on  reproductive  health, \nespecially  for  youth,  and  provides  information,  education,  and  clinical  services.  Since  2003, \nsome services have also included VCT, especially targeting high-risk and vulnerable youth.  \n \n9. \nMost  UN  agencies  are  also  involved  in  HIV/AIDS  programs  in  Viet  Nam,  largely  within \nthe  domain  of  their  focus.  The  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  has  focused  on  prevention  of \nmother-to-child  transmission  and  life  skills  for  young  people;  WHO  on  providing  technical \nsupport,  especially  in  the  area  of  treatment  and  care;  and  the  United Nations  Office  on  Drugs \nand Crime on rehabilitation and harm reduction for drug users.  \n \n10. \nUNAIDS  plays  an  overall  advocacy  and  technical  support  role  focused  on  the \ndevelopment and implementation of the national strategy, technical support for monitoring and \nevaluation,  youth  issues,  and  strategy  implementation.  UNAIDS  also  plays  a  key  role  in \nfacilitating  donor  coordination.  There  is  a  dynamic  international  agency  working  group  for \npurposes of coordination with subgroups focused on areas such as media, treatment, and harm \nreduction. There is also a donor coordination group on reproductive health.  \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n33\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nPROVINCE SELECTION \n\nProvince  selection  was  undertaken  during  the  project  preparatory  phase.

The \npopulation is approximately 1.3 million, with almost 20% being young people aged 15\u201324. Most \nof  the  population  (85%)  lives  in  rural  areas.  More  than  45,000  students  attend  52  education \nfacilities,  including  a  university,  2  colleges  and  7  vocational  training  centers,  13  centers  for \nhigher education, and 29 training centers. Phu Tho is bordered by six provinces and is traversed \nby major transportation routes that connect it to Hanoi and Hai Phong and border crossings with \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic.  The  Ha  Noi\u2013Lao \nCao  rail  and  the  Ho  Chi  Minh  highway  will  be  built  through  this  province.  The  expansion  of \ntransportation  networks  will  increase  Phu  Tho\u2019s  potential  for  tourism,  trade,  and  economic \nexchanges and also the risk of HIV/AIDS.  \n \n2. \nPhu  Tho\u2019s  economy  has  been  shifting  rapidly  from  agriculture  to  manufacturing, \nconstruction,  and  service  sectors.  In  2005,  revenue  from  these  sectors  accounted  for  74%  of \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP).  The  average  GDP  has  risen  9.7%  since  2000  and  the  overall \nrate of poverty has been halved to 5% since 2000. Approximately 6.8% of households have a \ntelephone and 90% have access to television. However, Phu Tho is still a poor province given \nits low economic starting point for development.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nAt  the  end  of  August  2005,  the  Provincial  Administration  of  HIV/AIDS  Prevention  and \nControl had recorded 975 HIV positive people in the province. Of these, 190 had progressed to \nfull  blown  AIDS  and  147  had  died.  The  actual  prevalence  of  HIV/AIDS  in  Phu  Tho  in  2005  is \nestimated  to  be  approximately  3,150  people,  representing  0.23%  of  the  total  population. \nApproximately 90% of those infected are young males.  \n \nC. \n \n4. \nworkforce of 670,000 people of which 190,000 are aged 18\u201324. \n \nMobility. Although 85% of Phu Tho residents live in rural or mountainous areas, many \n5. \nleave  for  other  cities  and/or  provinces  to  look  for  work.  In  one  of  the  poorest  mountainous \ndistricts  of  Cam  Khe,  more  than  30  people  who  had  been,  or  had  relations  with,  migrant \nworkers, were found to be HIV positive.  \n \n6. \nIndustrialization. There are five main industrial zones that include a fertilizer plant and \na paper mill. Industrial enterprises employ nearly 70,000 workers or 11% of the workforce. Most \nof these are young people living away from home for extended periods. \n \n7. \nTourism. Sites such as the Hung Temple, and the annual Hung festival attract millions \nof tourists. There are 70 restaurants and hotels employing thousands of workers, most of them \nare young women.  \n \nDrugs. Phu Tho is recognized as a hot spot for illicit drug use and sex work. There are \n8. \nover 1,300 residents in rehabilitation centers, of which 73% are aged 15\u201335 years, and most of \nthem are male.  \n \nD. \n \n9. \nTo  implement  the  national  HIV/AIDS  strategy,  Phu  Tho  has  developed  an  action  plan. \nThe  goal  is  to  keep  prevalence  of  HIV/AIDS  under  0.3%  prevalence  by  2010  with  no  further \nincrease after 2010, and to reduce the harm caused by HIV/AIDS infection. \n\nUnemployment.  The  unemployment  rate  for  the  province  is  7.6%,  from  an  available \n\nThe Risks for HIV Transmission among the Youth of Phu Tho \n\nProvincial Strategy on HIV/AIDS and Action Plan to 2010 \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n10. \nThe main agencies involved in HIV/AIDS prevention for young people in Phu Tho are the \nDepartment  of  Health,  the  provincial  committee  for  population  family  and  children,  the \nDepartment  of  Culture  and  Information,  the  Department  of  Education  and  Training,  the \nprovincial  police,  the  Department  of  Labor  Invalids  and  Social  Affairs,  mass  media  agencies \n(particularly  provincial  TV  and  radio  stations)  and  mass  organizations  (e.g.,  the  Provincial \nFather Land Front, Women\u2019s Union, Farmers\u2019 Union, and Youth Union). \n \n11. \nSupport of Government and Donors on HIV/AIDS. Phu Tho\u2018s budget is able to meet \nonly  one  third  of  its  estimated  HIV/AIDS  program  needs  and  it  looks  for  the  financial  support \nfrom the central Government. To date, three international agencies have implemented projects \nin Phu Tho, but these projects are all now finished (Table A6).  \n \n\nTable A6: Previous HIV/AIDS Projects in Phu Tho Province \n \n\nOrganization \n\n \nGlobal Fund to Fight  \nAIDS, Tuberculosis \nand Malaria \nICCO (Dutch NGO) \nPlan International \n\nImplementing Site \n \nPhu Ninh, Cam Khe, Viet \nTri, Phu Tho, and Doan \nHung \nViet Tri (3 wards) \nCam Khe (1 village) \n\nTarget Groups \n \n\nHealth care for \nvillages and PLWHA \n\nPeriod \n \n\n2004\u20132005 \n\nPLWHA \nHealth care for \nvillages and PLWHA \n\n2004\u20132005 \n2005 \n\nAIDS  =  acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome,  HIV/AIDS  =  human  immunodeficiency  virus/acquired \nimmunodeficiency syndrome, ICCO = Interchurch Organisation for Development Cooperation, PLWHA = \npeople living with HIV/AIDS, TB = tuberculosis. \nSource: Provincial officials. \n \n\nThe Project Proposal \n\nD. \n \n12. \nGoal  and  Objectives.  To  achieve  the  goal  of  the  Phu  Tho  provincial  strategy  on \nHIV/AIDS prevention 2010\u20132020\u2014to keep prevalence below 0.3% with no further increase after \n2010.  The  specific  objective  is  to  reduce  the  risk  of  HIV/AIDS  transmission  in  young  people \naged 14\u201325 through behavior change communication programs. \n \n13. \nProject  Sites.  Viet  Tri  city  and  Cam  Khe  district  have  been  nominated  based  on \nassessment  criteria  that  included  the  population  of  young  people,  presence  of  education \ncenters,  developing  industrial  zones,  tourism,  HIV  prevalence,  and  the  capacity  of  local \ninstitutions.  Viet  Tri  is  the  capital  of  the  province  and  has  the  highest  number  of  HIV-infected \npeople. Cam Khe is a poor mountainous district, with 200 households and 1,000 ethnic minority \nresidents, a high rate of migration, and a large number of HIV infections. \n \n14. \nTarget  Groups.  The  target  group  is  young  people  15\u201324.  Specific  interventions  will \nfocus on subgroups, including street youth, workers in industrial zones, and youth in vocational \ntraining  centers  and  service  industries,  sex  workers,  and  injecting  drug  users.  Indirect  targets \nare people who have influence on youth such as parents and teachers. \n \nE. \n \n15. \n \n\nComponent 1: Leadership Advocacy and Strategy Development.  \n\nOutputs from Proposed Project Activities \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nAdvocacy  materials  produced  by  the  project  management  unit  distributed  to \nprovincial party, state, and people\u2019s council leaders at different levels. \nParty  and  state  leaders  at  different  levels  support  the  project  components  by \nmaking decisions and decrees. \nA mechanism for the involvement of youth established and implemented. \nYouth-related  issues  and  HIV/AIDS  brought  into  the  development  phase  of \nprograms, policy, project components, and annual plan of the province.  \n\n\f \n\n \n16. \n \n\n \n17. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n37 \n\n(v) \n\nThe budget for HIV/AIDS increased from both province and community. \n\nComponent 2: Mass Media and Interpersonal Communication Materials. \n\nTarget  groups  reached  by  TV  drama  series,  advertising  spots,  phone  hot-line, \nwebsites,  etc.  with  special  attention  to  reaching  people  in  remote  mountainous \nareas such as Cam Khe district (where some  areas do not receive the national \nTV network signal). \n\nComponent 3: Community-Based HIV/AIDS Prevention \n\n(ii) \nvulnerable youth. \n(a) \n\nSubcomponent 1: harm reduction outreach for high-risk settings. \n(a) \n\nA VCT center established in Viet Tri City providing clients with condoms \nand free communication materials. \nPeople  living  with  HIV/AIDs,  IDUs,  and  sex  workers  acting  as  peer \neducators to mobilize their peers to have testing and counseling.   \nNeedles and condoms distributed by peer educators; people who wish to \ngive up drugs reached though community-based rehabilitation programs. \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n \nSubcomponent 2: peer education and interpersonal communication programs for \n\n10  teachers  of  Sympathy  classes  and  10  teachers  of  vocational  training \ncenters trained to become resource persons on HIV/AIDS prevention and \nlife skills. \n300  peer  educators  representing  the  target  groups  trained  on  HIV/AIDS \nprevention.  \nCondoms distributed among the target groups. \n\nSubcomponent  3:  primary  prevention  for  parents  and  community  workers  and \nyouth in secondary schools. \n(a) \n\nTeaching  aids  and  IPC  materials  distributed  to  two  secondary  schools \nand one teachers\u2019 college and to community workers and parents. \nCommunication  equipment  made  available  in  schools  and  community \nsettings. \nEducation  about  HIV/AIDS  delivered  to  students  of  three  schools  in  Viet \nTri  (National  Ethnic  University,  Economic  Skill  Training  School,  Food-\nProcessing Training School). \n100  teachers  of  four  upper  secondary  schools  in  Viet  Tri  and  Cam  Khe \nequipped with knowledge on HIV/AIDS and expertise to use teaching aid \nmaterials \nformal \ncurriculum. \n100  community  workers  equipped  with  competencies  such  as  the \neffective use of IPC materials and counseling methods for adult learners, \nHIV/AIDS and STI knowledge, tools to reduce stigma and discrimination, \neffective parenting, gender awareness, and \u201cfirst aid\u201d for drug users.  \n822  classes  (300  classes  in  Viet  Tri,  522 in  Cam  Khe)  organized  by the \ncommunity workers for 24,000 parents.  \n\nintegrate  HIV/AIDS-related  subjects \n\ninto \n\nthe \n\nto \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n \n\n18. \n \n\nComponent 4: Capacity Building and Project Management.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nA  management  mechanism  to  ensure  the  agreed  implementation  progress \nestablished and implemented. \nProject  officers  are  capable  to  support  implementing  partners  and  technical \nassistance for monitoring and evaluation. \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nGENDER STRATEGY \n\nGender and HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam \n\n \n1. \nThe  HIV/AIDS  Prevention  among  Youth  Project  will  have  a  specific  focus  on  gender \nissues  which  are  inherent  to  HIV/AIDS  risk  and  prevention  in  Viet  Nam.  All  project  activities, \nparticularly  the  mass  media  campaign,  will  specifically  address  the  gender  norms,  including \nthose  related  to  interpersonal  relationships,  empowerment,  and  social  expectations  that  affect \nan  individual's  risk  of  HIV/AIDS  infection.  Both  men  and  women  will  be  covered,  as  there  are \nspecific  features  of  HIV/AIDS  risk  that  are  associated  with  each  sex.  A  gender  strategy  has \nbeen  prepared  to  highlight  and  enunciate  this  focus,  and  to  ensure  sustainable  targets  and \nindicators for project implementation, monitoring, and evaluation are adhered to. \n \nA. \n \nAs in most countries, gender plays an important role in HIV risk in Viet Nam. Girls and \n2. \nwomen have greater vulnerability to infection because of biological factors which include easier \nmale\u2013female transmission, especially in younger women, and the fact that sexually transmitted \ninfections (STI) which increase the risk of HIV infection tend to be less symptomatic (and less \nlikely to be treated) in women. Girls and women are more likely to be trafficked and become sex \nworkers. The illegality of sex work in Viet Nam  means sex workers cannot easily insist clients \nuse  condoms,  despite  the  target  of  100%  condom  use  in  the  National  HIV/AIDS  Strategy. \nMoreover,  condoms  are  unpopular  in  Viet  Nam,  even  among  youth.  They  are  perceived  as \nreducing  sensation,  but  are  also  considered  symbols  of  immorality  for  anyone  who  carries \nthem.1  \n \n3. \nGender roles are quite sharply delineated in Viet Nam. Traditional Confucian values for \nwomen and girls are refinement, self-sacrifice, and obedience, and a focus on home and family. \nMen  should  be  active  outside,  make  key  decisions,  and  engage  socially  with  other  men.2 \nWomen\u2019s  home-based  role  means  they  are  considered  responsible  for  the  family\u2019s  social  and \nmoral conduct.  \n \n4. \nIt is estimated that women and girls bear about 75% of the burden of caring for those \nsick with AIDS.3 Household income spent on health care means less available for nutrition and \neducation, where women and girls already lack access compared with men. At this stage, most \npeople dying from AIDS in Viet Nam are male; their deaths often leave households headed by \nwomen. \n \n5. \nWhile  girls  and  women  do  face  specific  and  increasing  risks  related  to  HIV,  the \noverwhelming majority of infections in Viet Nam have occurred among boys and men. Concepts \nof masculinity promote risk-taking and discourage self-care. Vietnamese males are more likely \nto use drugs. This largely explains the disparity between the sexes in infection rates. Moreover, \nmales  use  sex  workers  and  often  do  not  use  condoms  with  casual  partners  or  with  wives. \nUnemployed young men spend more time outside the home with friends, and thus more readily \nbecome  involved  in  drug  use.  Unemployed  young  women  spend  most  of  their  time  at  home, \nlargely to do housework, but also because parents give them less freedom; therefore, they are \nless likely to engage in risky behavior. \n \n6. \nDespite  its  obvious  role  in  defining  the  risk  of  HIV  infection,  a  consideration  of,  and \nspecific  features  that  address,  gender  have  been  almost  completely  absent  from  prevention \n                                                 \n1  Ministry of Health. 2005.

While  awareness  of  gender  equity  is  high,  there  is  little  awareness  of  the  risks  for \nboth  sexes  from  normative  gender  roles.  There  is  a  widely  identified  need  for  more  public \ndiscussion of these norms and for programs for youth that address gender-related risks. \n \nB. \n \n7. \nThe Project will aim to expand the life skills of young women, especially when they have \na lower level of education, or are from disadvantaged or ethnic minority groups. Young men and \nwomen will be included in all stages of the formative research and special attention will be paid \nto eliciting the views of young girls and women separately and in confidence given the sensitivity \nof  issues  surrounding  reproductive  health  and  sexuality.  Issues  specific  to  young  men,  their \nvulnerability and risk behaviors, will also be included in the project design, both to help identify \nand challenge gender norms and to use their expertise to engage effectively with target groups \nof  marginalized  young  men.  The  Project  calls  for  equal  representation  of  male  and  female \nyoung people in all phases, beginning with the  formative research that will underpin the mass \nmedia  components  that  are  central  to  the  Project.  This  initial  work  will  identify  the  different \ncircumstances and opportunities for young men and women and how they can be influenced to \nmodify their knowledge, attitudes, and risk behaviors in relation to HIV/AIDS.  \n \nC. \n \nImplementation  arrangements  and  estimated  costs  of  the  gender  strategy  are  part  of \n8. \nthe overall project arrangements and total budget, as women are among the Project\u2019s primary \nbeneficiaries.  Each  provincial  action  plan  shall  include  a  gender  analysis  and  a  gender  action \nplan (GAP) based on the gender strategy. The vice director of the PMU will be designated as \nthe  gender  focal  point,  responsible  for  ensuring  all  aspects  of  the  GAP  are  accounted  for \nthroughout the Project\u2019s implementation.4 Each provincial project management unit will have a \ngender  focal  person  who  will  receive  training  in  gender-related  issues.  NGOs  will  have \nexperience and expertise in working with a gender focus. \n \n9. \nMonitoring  of  the  gender  strategy  is  incorporated  in  the  overall  system  for  the  Project \nand  will  include  gender-disaggregated  data  in  all  instances  of  data  gathering  and  research. \nQuarterly and annual reports shall include a specific summary of progress toward implementing \neach GAP, which shall be examined during midterm review.

NGOs,  including \nmass  organizations  such  as  the  Women\u2019s  or  Youth  Unions,  with  experience  in  the  delivery  of \nHIV/AIDS  services  at  the  community  level  will  be  contracted  to  implement  activities  under \ncomponent  3.  NGOs  and/or  mass  organizations  should  have  specific  experience  and  skills  in \ntargeting and reaching young people, especially those in difficult or hard-to-reach environments \nsuch  as  injecting  drug  users  (IDUs),  sex  workers,  clients  of  sex  workers  or  people  who  are \nvulnerable  because  of  their  social  isolation  because  of  migration  and/or  work.  NGOs  and/or \nmass  organizations  offer  a  cost-effective  mechanism  for  delivering  services  in  innovative  and \nflexible ways that will maximize the potential for impact among youth.  \n \n7. \nContracting  Packages.  As  each  of  the  three  subcomponents  has  a  distinct  target \ngroup,  separate  organizations  (mass  or  non-government)  will  be  contracted  for  each \nsubcomponent. A single NGO or mass organization will be contracted to deliver services in five \nor ten provinces according to phase 1 and phase 2 of project implementation.1 Thus there will \nbe six contracts in three areas of service delivery with objectives and outputs as follows. \n\n(i) \n\nYouth-friendly  harm  reduction  services,  including  outreach  voluntary  counseling \nand  testing  (VCT),  in  each  project  province,  targeted  at  youth  with  high-risk \nbehaviors and/or in high-risk settings, with the following outputs: \n\u2022  a harm reduction service, with VCT services, in a community setting; \n\u2022 \n\ntechnical  guidance  and  training  for  counselors,  nurses  and  laboratory \npersonnel; \n\n\u2022  social  marketing  for  the  service,  especially  in  venues  where  youth  with  high-\n\nrisk behaviors are likely to be reached; \n\n\u2022  on-going quality review of VCT through observation, reporting, training of staff; \nincluding  health  services, \n\u2022 \n\nlinks  with  other  support  programs/activities, \ncommunity and home\u2013based care; and \n\n\u2022  condoms, needles, syringes and project IPC materials distribute. \n\n(ii) \n\nPeer  education  and  life  skills  programs  for  vulnerable  youth,  including  street \nyouth,  youth  working  in  services  industries  and  factory  workers,  and  a  life  skills \ntraining program for youth at vocational training or job recruitment centers with the \nfollowing specific outputs: \n\u2022  curriculum and plan of action for each training group based on a foundation of \n\nformative research and existing curricula; \n\n\u2022  participatory training course for peer educators at provincial and district levels; \n\u2022  supervised  peer  education  programs  at  the  community  level  in  a  variety  of \n\nsettings with on-going support and in-service training; \nlife  skills  for  HIV/AIDS  awareness  curriculum  and  plan  of  action  for  each \nprovince; \n\n\u2022  participatory  training  courses  for  students  in  vocational  and  job  recruitment \n\ncenters at provincial and district levels; and \nregular monitoring and evaluation. \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n1  The first three NGO contracts in three areas of service delivery will be awarded for phase 1 for activities in the five \nnorthern  provinces,  commencing  activities  in  year  1  (see  Appendix  5).  The  second  three  NGO  contracts,  each \nassociated with a specific area of service delivery, for activities in the remaining 10 provinces will begin in year 2. \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n51 \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\nTraining  community  collaborators  and  school-based  educators  in  subjects  that \ninclude  interpersonal  communication  skills,  counseling,  HIV/AIDS  and  sexually \ntransmitted  infection  (STI)  prevention,  community-based  care  and  support  for \nPLWHA,  effective  parenting  skills,  and  gender  awareness,  with  the  following \nspecific outputs: \n\u2022  curriculum and action plan for a training and outreach program for community \n\ncollaborators; \ntraining courses using participatory methods across nominated topics; \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022  supervision  of  outreach  program \n\nimplementation, \n\nincluding  number  of \n\nhousehold and school visits, community consultations, etc; and \nregular monitoring and evaluation to ensure relevance and effectiveness. \n\n\u2022 \n\n \n8. \nspecific service expected under the contract but in general will include: \n\nSelection Criteria. The selection criteria for each contract type will be adapted to the \n\n(i)  province-based service delivery experience in the specified area (e.g. VCT, peer \n\neducation and outreach, training of trainers); \n\n(ii)  HIV/AIDS-prevention-related  service  delivery  experience \n\nthe \nprovinces (or provinces with similar HIV/AIDS risk circumstances); and \n\nin \n\ntargeted \n\n(iii)  experience with,  and  capacity  for, managing  internationally  supported programs \n\nincluding those for financial management and reporting. \n\n \n9. \nSelection and Contracting Process. Contracts for the provision of services by NGOs \nand/or  mass  organizations  will  be  competitively  awarded  following  procedures  acceptable  to \nADB. A single organization may bid on any number of contracts, but each bid will be evaluated \nindependently against other bids for the same contract. The project management unit (PMU) will \nmanage the selection and contracting process. A call for bids will be advertised locally and on \nADB\u2019s  website.  International  NGOs  will  be  eligible,  as  will  local  organizations.  Bids  will  be \nevaluated  based  on  (i)  organizational  capacity  (expertise  and  resources  to  provide  the \nnominated service as well relevant experience); (ii) the strength of the technical proposal; and \n(iii) cost. Only NGOs from ADB member countries may be awarded contracts. \n \n10. \nContracts  will  be  implemented  on  the  basis  of  a  lump  sum  contract,  with  quarterly \nprogress  payments  made  contingent  on  satisfactory  contractor  performance.  Contracts  will \nspecify objectively measurable service delivery goals to which payments are linked.  \n \n11. \nMonitoring and Review. All contractors will be required to provide regular reporting to \nthe  PMU  according  to  government  and  ADB  procedures  and  the  reporting  schedule  and \nindicators  set  out  in  the  contract.  Contracts  and  services  will  be  reviewed  by  ADB\u2019s  regular \nproject review missions. \n \n\n\fTable A11.1 Individual Consulting Services by Position and Outputs \n \n\nOutputs \n\n52 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nPosition \n\nInternational Consulting Services \n\nPerson \nMonths \n\nYouth and HIVAIDS Advisor \n(WHO-recruited) a \n\n24 \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \nAdvisor \n\n18 \n\n12 \n\n54 \n\n24 \n\n6 \n\n30 \n\n54 \n\n18 \n\n78 \n\nInstitutional Capacity Building \nAdvisor \n\nSubtotal (A) \n\nDomestic Consulting Services \n\nYouth Advisor (WHO-financed) a \n \n\nSocial development adviser \n\nMedia specialist. \n\nFinance, accounting and \nadministration  \nProject management systems \nspecialist \nProject technical HIV/AIDS and \nyouth specialist \n\nProvincial technical HIV/AIDS \nspecialists \n\nSubtotal (B) \nTotal (A+B) \n\n\u2022  Quality control on youth and HIV/AIDS focus in all project activities \n\u2022  Message development and dissemination strategies \n\u2022  Quality assurance for print media, website and mass media \n\u2022  Participatory workshops for youth at national and provincial levels \n\u2022  Research on youth in relation to reproductive health and HIV/AIDS \nLiaison on youth policy with international partners and Government \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nFunctioning monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system for project \n\u2022  Updated project indicators consistent with national M&E framework \nTechnical support to design and conduct of base-line, mid-term and \n\u2022 \nfinal studies \nTraining and coaching in M&E at provincial level for implementing \nagencies \nTraining and support for PMU and PPMU staff \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022  Monitoring visits to project sites and implementing agencies \n\u2022  Coordination with MOH and technical agencies on M&E indicators \n\u2022  Management training needs analysis for PMU and PPMU staff \n\u2022  Capacity building improvement program for PMU staff \n\u2022 \n\nIn-house training program for staff at the PMU within first 6 months \nof the project implementation \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  Capacity building improvement program for PPMU staff and \n\nprovincial workshops within 12 months of provincial project activity \n\u2022  Assistance to PMU staff in phase 1 and preparations for phase 2. \n \n\nImplementation support to project provinces. \n\n\u2022  Ensure youth issues are emphasized in project activities. \n\u2022  Quality assurance for media materials. \n\u2022  Collaboration with the international consultant on leadership training.\n\u2022 \n\u2022  Support PMU and PPMU to implement Gender Action Plan \n\u2022  Work with PPMUs to develop provincial action plans \n\u2022 \nTo collaborate with the media agency for component 2. \n\u2022  Advise on cultural issues for media materials in Viet Nam. \n\u2022 \n\nFacilitate collaboration between ministries and institutions for \napproval processes with steering committee.  \n\n\u2022  Computerized accounting and establish internal controls \n\u2022  Mid-term review support, project completion support. \n\u2022  Project management and monitoring system \n\u2022  Support on mid-term review and project completion \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nTo monitor and progress activities of all project components \n\nTo monitor technical aspects and progress for component 3 \nactivities at provincial level \n\n\u2022  Provide support on making provincial annual work-plan \n \n \n\n150 \n\n360 \n414 \n\nHIV/AIDS  =  human  immunodeficiency  virus/acquired  immune  deficiency  syndrome;  M&E  =  monitoring  and \nevaluation; MOH = Ministry of Health; PMU = project management unit; PPMU = provincial project management unit; \nWHO = World Health Organization. \na  Under a project implementation agreement with WHO, this international adviser position will be managed by WHO \nin  close  consultation  with  ADB  and  VCPFC  in  order  to  strengthen  links  with  and  support  from  United  Nations \nagencies.

With the exception of households in the \nhighest income quintile, it is likely that all households that include a person living with HIV/AIDS will fall below the \npoverty line because of the income and expenditure effects of infection. Analysis shows that households in the third \nand fourth income quintiles who are affected by HIV/AIDS will become newly poor. Cost-effectiveness analyses rate \nHIV/AIDS prevention efforts among the best buys for public health and development in general. \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nBy reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS and improving public health, the Project will make a positive contribution to \nreducing poverty, and the risk of poverty, through HIV/AIDS infection. This benefit extends not only to the young \npeople targeted by the Project but also to families who are inevitably burdened economically and socially by the need \nto support and care for an infected family member. This benefit extends especially to women (mothers and wives) who \nare almost always the family member providing care and support. \n \nThe economic effect of HIV/AIDS on households is severe and the poor are particularly at risk\u2014both to infection itself \nand to its economic effects. The benefits of economic growth have not been evenly distributed in Viet Nam and some \nsocial groups have missed out on the associated benefits. The maldistribution of these growth benefits is one of the \ncauses of increasing numbers of injecting drug users (IDUs) and sex workers, but it also has an effect among the \ngeneral population. A commitment to equity in the provision of HIV preventive activities is necessary to protect the \npoor from HIV transmission and to reduce the chances of impoverishment caused by HIV/AIDS, and to reduce the \npotential social and private costs of treatment and care. The public provision of effective HIV preventive services also \nincreases feelings of social security and social solidarity that have a flow-on effect in economic terms. The costs of \nhealth care in general, and the costs of HIV/AIDS care in particular, are a major cause of impoverishment in Viet Nam. \nFigures from the Viet Nam Household Living Standards Survey 2002 indicate that household out-of-pocket spending \non health care accounts for at least 62% of total health expenditure.  \n \nThe Project will focus on populations and interventions where the impact of preventing infection will be greatest, the \nyoung (15\u201324). With their full working lives ahead of them and families to care for and support, the economic and/or \npoverty impact of HIV/AIDS infection is inevitably greatest when it occurs in this age group given the poor health and \nloss of productivity that inevitably follows. In addition, the Project will include interventions targeted at those young \npeople engaged in high-risk behaviors (e.g., sex work, drug use) and those vulnerable to adopting these high-risk \nbehaviors (e.g., migrants, the unemployed, and employees in high-risk sectors such as tourism), thereby increasing \nthe likelihood of preventing infection and poverty. Six of the project provinces have a poverty rate greater than the \nnational average. Several of the nominated provinces, including Hanoi, Danang, and Quang Ninh, have poverty rates \namong the lowest in the country. However, it must be noted that, within these provinces, those at greatest risk and \nmost affected by HIV/AIDS will be among the poorest in the province. Moreover, it is widely recognized that many of \nthe households most recently rising out of poverty\u2014also at great risk for HIV infection\u2014are only just above the poverty \nline and the impact of an HIV infection within the household could quickly see them plunge back into poverty. The \nProject will target and provide benefits to such households. \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nA stakeholder analysis was completed during the design phase to identify and understand both the groups at risk of \nHIV infection and the potential partners in project implementation. For the potential partners, the analysis considered \nproject-related interests and the ways in which the respective stakeholders can affect project feasibility and success. \nPrimary stakeholders include, first and foremost, young people, as well as the VCPFC as Executing Agency, along \nwith MOH/VAAC, MOLISA, and MOET. These stakeholders will play an active role in the implementation of project \nactivities, and project activities in turn will have some effect on their operations. For the project activities that aim to \ndevelop support for the implementation of the national HIV/AIDS strategy with a youth focus, stakeholders include \nnational and local government leaders and policy makers. Local and international NGOs will play a role as \nstakeholders and implementing agencies. Youth, as those at risk and targeted, will be actively involved throughout \nproject activities, including as key informants for the formative research, through employment in the television and \nradio production processes, and as peer educators. Mass organizations such as the Youth Union will also be involved. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \nParticipation  is  integrated  into  the  overall  project  design.  VCPFC  will  coordinate  closely  with  MOH  in  all  activities \nrelated  to  the  implementation  of  the  national  HIV/AIDS  strategy.  The  success  of  the  mass  media  component,  which \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No  \n\n  Yes \n\n   No \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n55 \n\nforms the centerpiece for all other project activities, will be closely related to the engagement of young people in the \nformative research and in the media production processes. The participation of other stakeholder ministries (MOLISA \nand MOET) and mass organizations (VWU and VYU) will also be critical to project success and is clearly defined in \nthe project design. The engagement of families through the education processes of the PCPFC collaborators will also \nensure  broad  participation  at  the  community  and  family  level  in  order  to  support  young  people  as  they  make  life \nchoices (education, employment, migration, relationships, and high-risk activities) that affect their overall HIV/AIDS risk. \nD.  Gender Development \n\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nAs in most countries, HIV/AIDS transmission and prevention in Viet Nam has important gender dimensions. This issue \nwas considered in great depth during the design phase and featured prominently in the poverty analysis, stakeholder \nanalysis, and the development of the participation strategy. Currently, 86% of all people living with HIV/AIDS are male \n(MoH 2005a), largely because the vast majority of injecting drug users are male. However, most sex workers are \nyoung women, and there is an increasing tendency for them to inject drugs, thus the risk profile of women is changing \nrapidly. Moreover, as more men become infected it is inevitable that the number of women infected will increase as a \nproportion of all infected as girlfriends and wives become infected by their partners. Normative gender roles are a \ncentral part of the risks faced by women. Women are also most likely to be the carers and supporters of infected men \nand thus bear a disproportionate share of the financial and social burden HIV/AIDS care. The achievement of the \nProject\u2019s purpose and objectives will have benefits for both women and men. Changing the perception of women\u2019s \nrisk, gender roles (especially in social relationships), and the perception of condom use will directly benefit women. \nThe messages conveyed through mass media materials, peer education, and other interpersonal communication \noutreach activities will directly address these perceptions and risks as they affect women.  \n \nHas an output been prepared? \nA gender action plan is at Appendix 7. \nE.

The Project will provide some \nemployment and skills training for youth (including people \nliving with HIV/AIDS) in the mass media production, peer \neducation, youth-friendly harm-reduction services and \ncommunity outreach. The Project will target youth in \nvocational training and job recruitment centers, but project \nactivities will not affect their activities in these places.  \nThe Project will target vulnerable youth in 15 provinces \nsome of which include significant ethnic minority \npopulations. In these provinces, special provisions will be \nincluded in the provincial action plans to ensure materials \nare adapted to effectively reach ethnic minority youth at \nrisk (including language adaptation and distribution \nstrategies). The plan for outreach activities and peer \neducation will also consider the special needs of ethnic \nminority youth at risk of HIV infection. \nThe Project will not have any environmental effects. Harm \nreduction hardware (needles and condoms) will be \nprovided and accompanying IEC materials and peer \neducation will address disposal issues.  \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n \nHIV/AIDS  =  human  immunodeficiency  virus/acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome;  IDU  =  injecting  drug  users;  IEC  = \ninformation, education, communication; MOET = Ministry of Education and Training; MOH = Ministry of Health; MOLISA = \nMinistry of Labour, War Invalids and Social Affairs; NGO = nongovernment organization; PCPFC = Provincial Committee for \nPopulation  Family  and  Children;  VAAC  =  Vietnam  Administration  for  AIDS  Control;  VCPFC  =  Vietnam  Commission  for \nPopulation, Family and Children; VCT = voluntary counseling and testing; VWU = Vietnam Women\u2019s Union; VYU = Vietnam \nYouth Union. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n Yes \n  No  \n\n\f \n56 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nSUMMARY ECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \n\nEconomic Rationale for Investing in HIV/AIDS Prevention among Youth \n\nA. \n \n1. \nThe  case  for  a  strong  government  role  in  HIV/AIDS  prevention  is  based  on  the lack  of \neffective private demand. Public funding of HIV/AIDS prevention activities is justified both as a \npublic good and by positive externalities. The services provided to the community through HIV \nprevention  activities  are  public  goods  for  which  the  consumption  by  a  single  individual  or \nhousehold does not affect the consumption choice of other individuals or households.  \n \n2. \nThe externalities associated with HIV prevention activities mean that the social benefits \nare greater than the private benefits: HIV prevention simultaneously protects the individual (from \ninfection)  and  the  community  (from  increased  rates  of  transmission).  Effective  prevention \nreduces the social costs of, and social spending on, health due to HIV/AIDS-related care.  \n \n3. \nThe implementation of effective preventive activities will reduce the cost to government \nof  HIV-related  treatment  and  care.  Moreover,  effective  prevention  activities  have  a  long-term, \nintergenerational impact in protecting future generations from HIV both broadly, by reducing the \noverall  level  of  infection,  and  more  specifically,  by  reducing  mother-to-child  transmission.  Viet \nNam  has  achieved  significant  improvements  in  child  survival  and  adult  productivity  due  to \nimproved nutrition and education. HIV/AIDS potentially undermines these achievements. In the \ncase of a private good, like the use of condoms, the positive externalities (reducing the risk of \nHIV transmission) are such that government subsidies to promote such behaviors are justified. \n \n4. \nStudies  have  documented  the  value  of  youth-focused  behavior  change  programs  and \ninterventions,  especially  for  youth  practicing  high-risk  behaviors.  In  the  case  of  youth-focused \ninterventions  in  India,  each  avoided  HIV  case  was  estimated  to  cost  $1,324.1  Similarly, \ninterventions  targeting  injecting  drug  users  (IDUs)  and  sex  workers  were  found  to  be  highly \ncost-effective.  Sex  worker  behavior  change  interventions  were  estimated  to  cost  between  $52 \nand $154 for each infection avoided while voluntary testing cost $199 per case avoided. Both of \nthese interventions are in the proposed Project. Intervention costs are significantly less than the \ncosts of treatment and care and the productivity loss that comes with infection and premature death.  \n \nThe nature of HIV prevention as a public good with positive externalities is reinforced by \n5. \nthe  absence  of  market  mechanisms  available  to  address  the  identified  needs.  The  private \nprovision of preventive services is unlikely. Insurance markets likewise will not provide cover for \npreventive  programs  for  the  reasons  already  established  here.  There  is  also  limited,  and  in \nsome  countries,  nonexistent,  access  to  insurance  markets  for  HIV/AIDS  treatment  and  care. \nEven  where  insurance  may  be  available  in  the  private  market,  it  is  accessible  only  to  the \nwealthiest  people.  Additionally,  lack  of  knowledge  about  the  disease  and  the  availability  of \nservices,  and  the  limitations  in  access  to  health  services,  especially  among  the  poor,  restricts \neffective demand for prevention services. \n \nB. \n \n6. \nThe economic effect of HIV/AIDS on households is severe and the poor are particularly \nat  risk\u2014both  to  infection  itself  and  the  economic  effects  of  the  disease.  The  benefits  of \neconomic  growth  have  not  been  evenly  distributed  in  Viet  Nam  and  some  social  groups  have \nmissed out on the associated benefits. The maldistribution of these growth benefits is one of the \ncauses of increasing numbers of IDUs and sex workers, but it also has an effect on the general \npopulation. A commitment to equity in the provision of HIV preventive activities is necessary to \n\nHIV/AIDS Prevention, Equity, and Poverty Reduction \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n57 \n\nEconomic Benefits of the Project \n\nprotect the poor from HIV transmission and to reduce the chances of impoverishment caused by \nHIV/AIDS, and to reduce the potential social and private costs of treatment and care. The public \nprovision  of  effective  HIV  preventive  services  also  acts  to  increase  feelings  of  social  security \nand social solidarity that have a flow-on effect in economic terms. \n \n7. \nThe costs of health care in general, and the costs of HIV/AIDS care in particular, are a \nmajor  cause  of  impoverishment  in  Viet  Nam.  Figures  from  the  Viet  Nam  Household  Living \nStandards  Survey  (VHLSS)  in  2002  indicate  that  household  out-of-pocket  spending  on  health \ncare accounts for at least 62% of total health expenditure. Moreover, financial access to health \nservices is much more limited for the poor than for the wealthy. VHLSS figures indicate that the \npoorest population income quintile spends only 17% as much as the richest income quintile on \nhealth care annually. Financial access for the poor to treatment (for example anti-retrovirals) is \neven more limited. Equity is therefore a strong argument for public spending on HIV prevention. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nIt is anticipated that the distributional effects of project activities will especially benefit the \npoor  and  the  vulnerable  and  youth.  Public  distribution  of  preventive  services  will  have  most \nbenefit for people most at risk of HIV/AIDS, in this case the poor. By targeting youth, the Project \ncovers  the  biggest  group  of  those  likely  to  be  infected,  as  well  as  low-income  groups.  It  will \nreduce the likelihood of impoverishment caused by health costs related to HIV/AIDS treatment \nand care. \n \n9. \nThe 15 provinces have a combined population of approximately 14.9 million people aged \nbetween  15  and  49.  This  group  will  directly  benefit  from  the  strengthening  of  HIV/AIDS \neducation  and  prevention,  and  through  the  dissemination  of  information  through  mass  media \nand  community-based  distribution  methods.  Parents  will  also  be  project  beneficiaries  as  they \nwill be targeted by awareness-raising campaigns. \n \nThe  primary  outcome  will  be  the  number  of  HIV  infections  averted.  Benefits  of  the \n10. \nProject will also be measured in terms of reductions in the losses of productivity, morbidity, and \nmortality due to infection, including the costs of curative care.  \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n \n\nETHNIC MINORITY ISSUES AND ACTION FRAMEWORK \n\nProject Background \n\n \n1. \nAn ethnic minority action framework highlights the features of the Project that will need \nto be adapted and especially designed to ensure there are benefits for young people from ethnic \nminority populations in the targeted provinces. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe Viet, or Kinh, people account for 88% of Viet Nam\u2019s population and are mostly live \nin  the  lowlands.  There  are  54  ethnic  minority  groups  in  Viet  Nam.  Most  of  their  5.5  million \nmembers  live  in  mountainous  areas.  Major  groups  include  the  Tay  (960,000  people),  Hoa \n(930,000  people),  Thai  (770,000  people),  Khmer  (720,000  people),  Muong  (700,000  people), \nand H\u2019mong (441,000 people). Ethnic minority groups represent about 12% of Viet Nam\u2019s total \npopulation and about 28% of the total poor population. \n \n3. \nGeographical  remoteness,  lower  human  development  levels,  and  slower  economic \ngrowth affect the economic and human development of ethnic minority populations. Measures of \nhealth  status  in  particular  are  worse  for  ethnic  minority  populations,  including  infant  mortality \nrates  that  are  double  those  of  the  general  population.  Malaria,  dengue,  tuberculosis,  typhoid, \nand cholera also occur at higher rates than in the broader population. \n \nAcross the region, changing trends in human migration, drug use, human trafficking, and \n4. \nthe  sex  trade  have  contributed  to  an  increased  risk  of  acquiring  HIV/AIDS.  While  this  has \ncontributed  to  a  rapidly  growing  rate  of  HIV/AIDS  infection  in  Viet  Nam  as  a  whole,  among \nethnic minority groups the rate of increase is even faster than the national average. In the past, \nphysical  isolation  has  offered  some  protection,  but  it  has  also  limited  access  to  preventive \neducation programs and campaigns. This particularly affects young people, who are more likely \nto leave the remote areas to travel to provincial capitals or beyond for education or employment. \nPoor  education  levels  and  health  status  also  increase  vulnerability.  Women  from  ethnic \nminorities  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  exploitation  and  trafficking,  and  thus  to  the  risk  of \nHIV/AIDS infection. \n \n5. \nThe features of this Project that will especially target and benefit ethnic minority groups \nhave  been  developed  based  on  the  lessons  learned  from  other  HIV/AIDS  projects  that  have \ntargeted  ethnic  minority  populations.  In  particular,  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s) \nproject  Community  Action  for  Preventing  HIV/AIDS\u20191  addressed  the  needs  of  ethnic  minority \ngroups  in  border  areas  of  Viet  Nam,  Cambodia,  and  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic. \nSimilarly,  ADB\u2019s  regional  technical  assistance  (RETA)  project  on  information,  communication \nand  technology  (ICT)  and  HIV/AIDS  preventive  education2  addressed  issues  related  to \nHIV/AIDS  prevention  in  vulnerable  groups,  including  ethnic  minorities,  using  ICT  and  local \nlanguages  in  cross-border  areas.  Other  RETA  projects  addressed  prevention  in  mobile \npopulations,  including  ethnic  minority  groups,3  and  studied  and  developed  strategies  for \nimproving  the  health  and  education  needs  of  ethnic  minority  groups  in  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion.4  \n\n \n1  ADB.  2001.

ADB\u2019s  policy  on  indigenous  peoples  aims  to  protect \nethnic  minorities  from  the  adverse  impacts  of  development,  and  to  ensure  that  ethnic  minority \ngroups  benefit  from  development  projects  and  programs.  The  Government  of  Viet  Nam \nrecognizes  that  people  from  ethnic  minorities  tend  to  be  poor  and  underprivileged.  The \nComprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy  for  2001\u20132010  sets  11  goals,  6  of \nwhich deal with gender and ethnic minorities in ways that relate to the objectives of the Project: \n(i) achieve better education for all; (ii) reach gender equality and empower women; (ii) combat \nHIV/AIDS,  malaria,  and  other  communicable  diseases;  (iv)  reduce  vulnerability;  and \n(vi) eradicate  poverty  and  preserve  ethnic  minority  culture.  Complementing  this  strategy,  the \nGovernment  has  issued  several  decrees  and  guidelines  that  aim  to  reduce  poverty  and \nvulnerability among ethnic minority populations, including several that aim to increase access to \nhealth services and training courses. \n \nC. \n \n7. \nAlthough  ethnic  minority  groups  in  the  15  provinces  are  culturally  diverse  and \nlinguistically  complex,  the  Project  intends  to  research  and  implement  a  targeted  and  appropriate \ncampaign  to  enhance  benefits  to  ethnic  minority  populations,  particularly  among  ethnic  minority \nyouth. Through consultations with young people, community leaders, parents, and groups such as \nthe Youth Union, a range of actions across the project components will be implemented. \n \n8. \nImplementation arrangements and estimated costs of the ethnic minority action plan are \npart  of  the  overall  project  arrangements  and  total  budget.  The  vice  director  of  the  project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  will  be  designated  as  the  ethnic  minority  focal  point,  responsible  for \nensuring all aspects of the action plan are accounted for. In provinces where ethnic minorities \nmake  up  more  than  5%  of  the  province\u2019s  population,  provincial  project  management  units  will \nalso have a nominated ethnic minority focal person. Nongovernment organizations contracted to \nimplement  component  3  activities  will  all  have  to  show  evidence  of  some  experience  and  in-\nhouse expertise with ethnic-minority-focused programs. \n \nThe monitoring of the ethnic minority action plan will be part of the overall system for the \n9. \nProject.  The  quarterly  and  annual  reports  will  include  a  specific  summary  of  progress  toward \nimplementing the ethnic minority action plan. The midterm review will review these updates and \nadjustments to the action plan recommended based on lessons learned and actions to date. \n \nD. \n \n10. \nThe Project will seek to identify and address the specific issues of HIV/AIDS prevention \nand risk among ethnic minority youth. The communication strategy will improve the knowledge \nof  HIV  prevention  among  ethnic  minority  youth  and  aim  to  reduce  high-risk  behaviors.  The \nProject will improve dialogue between young people and local and national policy makers. \n \nBeyond  the  national  media  campaign,  the  Project  will  target  19  million  people  in  15 \n11. \nprovinces,  including  approximately  220,000  members  of  ethnic  minority  groups,  particularly  in \nHa  Tay  and  Dien  Bien  provinces.  While  there  are  no  specific  data  on  the  numbers  of  young \npeople in the target age group from ethnic minority groups in the provincial populations, using \nthe  overall  percentage  it  is  likely  that  the  Project  will  benefit  46,000  young  people  from  ethnic \nminorities. This may be a conservative estimate, as it is likely the proportion of the population \nthat is young in the ethnic minority population groups is greater than for the population overall. \n\nProject
