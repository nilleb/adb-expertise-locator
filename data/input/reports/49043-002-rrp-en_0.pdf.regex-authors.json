THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \npolicy-based loan from the ordinary capital resources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \n(A loan), and (ii) a proposed loan funded through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN) Infrastructure Fund (B loan), both to the Republic of Indonesia for Subprogram 2 of the \nSustainable and Inclusive Energy Program. The report also describes the proposed technical \nassistance (TA) to be provided by the Clean Energy Fund1 under the Clean Energy Financing \nPartnership Facility for Scaling Up Energy Efficiency, and if the Board approves the proposed \nloans, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.2 \n \n2.  Subprogram 2 supports the revival of Indonesia\u2019s underperforming energy sector through \nreforms initiated in 2014\u20132015, which aim to (i) improve fiscal sustainability and governance, \n(ii) expand private investment in the power and gas markets, and (iii) provide access to clean \nenergy options for all Indonesians. The ADB program, which was approved in September 2015 \nalong with subprogram 1,3 supports the Government of Indonesia\u2019s reform priorities; aligns with \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (CPS), 2016\u20132019;4 and represents a sustained partnership \nbetween ADB, the government, and several development partners. Subprogram 2 deepens the \nreforms begun under subprogram 1 of the programmatic approach. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The development problems. The role of the energy sector as a key enabler of inclusive \ngrowth has become more important as the government is faced with the challenge of expanding \nits economy. The annual rate of growth declined from 6.4% in 2010 to 5.0% in 2016, and is \nexpected to remain at 5.1% in 2017. The energy sector faces far-reaching, interrelated problems \nthroughout the value chain, from the supply of primary energy to the delivery of electricity. \nIndonesia is currently transitioning from being a net energy exporter to an importer of increasing \namounts of energy to meet its domestic needs. Oil production has declined steadily and the \ncountry lost its status as a net exporter in 2004. Similarly, without a significant increase in gas \ninfrastructure investment, Indonesia is expected to become a net gas importer by 2019. The oil \nand gas sector\u2019s share of export earnings declined from an average of 23% in 2000\u20132005 to \nabout 9% in 2016. For many years, energy subsidies led to underinvestment in the sector. \nIndonesia lags its ASEAN peers in the development of its abundant renewable energy resources: \nsolar, wind, biomass, and geothermal. Thus, the electricity subsector is increasing its reliance on \ncoal, which accounted for about 52% of the generation mix in 2015, with a concomitant increase \nin greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Overall, energy investment remains below what is needed, \nand new projects often face long delays in permitting, financing, and construction. \n \n4.  Meanwhile, in 2016, nearly 23 million people in the country lacked access to electricity, \nand the per capita electricity consumption of 950 kilowatt-hours was low relative to its regional \npeers. Poor access to reliable and affordable electricity ranks among the top constraints faced by \n                                                \n1  Financing partners: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  ADB. 2015.

", "2 \nthe manufacturing sector in urban areas. Improved access to affordable and sustainable forms of \nenergy is critical to enhance competitiveness, not only in the country\u2019s manufacturing and \ncommercial centers, but also in remote areas. Lack of access to energy (Figure) constrains efforts \nto transform the eastern part of Indonesia into a new growth engine with a focus on high-value \nagriculture, fisheries, small and medium-sized enterprises, and tourism, all of which rely on a \nstable energy supply.  \n \n5.  Binding constraints. Key binding constraints to the development of the energy sector \nare: (i) poor fiscal sustainability and inadequate governance, (ii) an uncertain and high-cost \nregulatory  environment  that  discourages  private  sector  investment,  and  (iii)  a  regulatory \nenvironment that is not conducive to expanding access to clean energy options.5 \n \n \n \n6.  Poor fiscal sustainability and inadequate governance. Low, below-cost tariffs for fuel \nand electricity, supported by pervasive subsidies that peaked at $27 billion in 2014, have rendered \nthe sector fiscally unsustainable.6 These subsidies, which at their peak represented over 15% of \ngovernment expenditure, have left little resources for infrastructure expansion. The government\u2019s \nplan to expand power generation capacity during 2016\u20132025 is estimated to cost $154 billion, \nincluding $78 billion from public sources, and securing financing poses a massive challenge. \nFurther, the government has been regulating large state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the energy \nsector lightly, whereby the government reimburses the State Electricity Corporation (PLN) for the \ndifference between PLN\u2019s operational costs and the revenue generated from subsidized tariffs \nthrough a public service obligation payment. This does not encourage PLN to curb costs or \nimprove service quality, and has led to PLN operating on short-term financial imperatives, rather \nthan adopting longer-term energy planning that would help optimize costs and benefits. Market \ndomination by monopolistic, subsidized SOEs across the energy supply chain has also led to a \nperception of high financial risk by the private sector. \n \n7.  Uncertain  and  high-cost  regulatory  environment  for  private  investment.  The \nissuance  of  laws  and  their  requisite  implementation  guidelines  is  often  delayed,  causing \n                                                \n5  Sector Assessment (Summary): Energy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  For example, the average cost of electricity in 2016 was Rp1,334 per kilowatt-hour while the average sale price was \nRp1,003 per kilowatt-hour. ", "3 \nuncertainty for private investors. For example, the government is yet to issue implementation \nguidelines pertaining to certain aspects of the Electricity Law, 2009 and the Oil and Gas Law, \n2001. Delays in renegotiating expiring gas production sharing contracts (PSCs) and a lack of clear \nrenegotiation procedures have discouraged investment and led to a decrease in production.7 \nSimilarly, the private sector shows little interest in developing new gas resources, including from \ncoal-bed methane, mainly because of the lack of clarity on the percentage of production paid to \nthe government and the price of gas (domestic prices have risen but are lower than in export \nmarkets). As a result, Indonesia accounted for only $19.3 billion of the nearly $33.0 billion in \nregional  oil  and  gas  investment  in  2014,  a  disproportionate  share  considering  Indonesia\u2019s \nresource endowments.8 Also, projects often encounter cumbersome licensing procedures and \nchallenges in permitting, licensing, land acquisition, and environmental approvals, caused by \noverlapping jurisdictions among ministries, agencies, and different levels of government.9 \n \n8.  Unfavorable regulatory environment for expanding access to clean energy. Low \ntariffs and a lack of incentives have stymied development of the country\u2019s vast renewable energy \nresources and curbed interest in energy efficiency measures. Meanwhile, non-stringent emission \nstandards for fossil fuel power plants, a lack of GHG emission controls, and an abundance of low-\ncost coal have resulted in the expansion of coal-fired power. Several institutional factors impede \nclean energy planning and development. While the Energy Law, 2007 laid out a clear hierarchy \nof policy and planning requirements, implementation has been fragmented. Clean energy targets \nare not developed in a bottom-up manner and do not reflect financial and economic conditions. \nSimilarly, in national electrification efforts, various entities have followed an ad hoc project- rather \nthan a program-based approach focusing on sustainability and replicability. The results are \nuneven electrification with a heavy reliance on costly diesel fuel and unreliable supply. \n \n9.  The  government\u2019s  reform  agenda.  The  National  Medium-Term  Development  Plan \n(RPJMN), 2015\u20132019, charts an ambitious reform program where energy security is a key pillar.10 \nRecognizing  the  importance  of  energy  for  sustainable  and  inclusive  national  economic \ndevelopment, the government has prioritized fuel and electricity subsidy reform; increased energy \nproduction from indigenous sources, particularly natural gas and renewable energy; expanded \naccess for all Indonesians; and more efficient use of energy. The government also recognizes \nthat  a  climate-friendly  energy  sector  development  path  is  a  key  factor  for  sustainable \ndevelopment. This priority is reflected in its ambitious GHG emission reduction goals included in \nits nationally determined contribution to the Paris Climate Agreement, which requires emissions \nto be reduced by 29% by 2030 in comparison to the business-as-usual scenario, and this \nreduction  could  reach  41%  subject  to  available  international  support. 11  In  addition,  the \ngovernment has set an ambitious target of 23% of renewable energy in its primary energy mix by \n2025 in its National Energy Policy and National Energy Plan.12  \n \n10.  Subprogram 1. The government initiated energy sector reforms in 2014\u20132015, many of \nwhich were included in subprogram 1 and are summarized below. To improve fiscal sustainability, \nthe government removed subsidies for gasoline, established a fixed subsidy scheme of Rp1,000 \n                                                \n7  PSCs form the basis for sharing revenues between exploration and production companies and the government. \nTwenty-nine PSCs will expire by 2020. \n8  International Energy Agency. 2015.

For electricity, the \ngovernment removed subsidies for industrial, commercial, and large residential consumers; and \nintroduced a system of monthly automatic price adjustments. Total energy subsidies fell by 61% \nfrom $27 billion in 2014 to $10.5 billion in 2015, and power subsidies fell by 26% from $7.6 billion \nin 2014 to $5.6 billion in 2015. \n \n11.  The government took measures to improve private investment in electricity and gas. It \nstreamlined the negotiation and re-issuance of PSCs for existing gas production concessions, \nand set market rules to use gas for transport. This helped boost investments amid low global \nenergy prices. Total oil and gas investment in Indonesia rose by 15% from $19.3 billion in 2014 \nto $22.2 billion in 2015. The government streamlined and simplified the licensing process for new \nprivate power projects by delegating authority to a new one-stop shop set up by the Indonesia \nInvestment Coordinating Board (BKPM). In line with requirements of the Electricity Law, the \ngovernment established the legal basis for private access to PLN\u2019s transmission lines through \npower wheeling arrangements.13 \n \n12.  The government expanded access to clean energy options through various incentives and \nprograms. It revised the Geothermal Law, 2003 to be more investor-friendly and established price \nincentives for power from biomass, biogas, and mini-hydro projects. It established (i) energy \nefficiency standards for key household appliances (e.g., air conditioners), and (ii) the basis for \naccrediting green buildings. To curtail GHG emissions, the government initiated efforts to pilot \ncarbon capture and storage (CCS); and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). The \nelectrification agenda was furthered through the addition of 3.7 million PLN customers, increasing \nthe electrification ratio to 88% by 2015. Recognizing that a business-as-usual approach will not \nhelp provide access to the remaining population, the government, in its national electricity plan, \n2015\u20132024, articulated a shift to prioritize renewable energy and integrate public and private \ninvestments across grid-based and off-grid approaches. ADB\u2019s assistance directly supported the \ndesign and implementation of these measures.14 \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s experience. Including subprogram 1 of the Sustainable and Inclusive Energy \nProgram, with $500 million approved in 2015, ADB has financed 23 projects and programs in the \nenergy sector since 1970, totaling $3.91 billion in loans.15 Since 2010, ADB has been actively \nsupporting the government\u2019s energy reform efforts through TA activities focused on (i) the \nreduction of subsidies in favor of cost-recovery tariffs for fuel and electricity; (ii) price incentives \nfor geothermal, wind, and solar energy; (iii) energy efficiency-related policies and programs, \nincluding support for energy service companies (ESCOs) and appliance standards; (iv) gas \nmarket  reform;  (v)  least-cost  electrification  planning  to  support  the  government\u2019s  national \nelectrification program; and (vi) pilot-testing of CCS and/or CCUS. ADB contributed an energy \nsector white paper as input to the preparation of the RPJMN.16 ADB assistance also draws on \npolicy-based loans and TA provided to other sectors that have an impact on the energy sector.17 \n                                                \n13 PLN has a de facto monopoly on transmission and distribution, yet the Electricity Law allows private generators to \naccess PLN\u2019s transmission infrastructure to provide power to end users (wheeling arrangement). \n14 Technical Assistance related to the Sustainable and Inclusive Energy Program, Subprogram 2 (accessible from the \nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 List of ADB Loans and Technical Assistance Programs Since 1999 (accessible from the linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n16 ADB. 2014.

Manila. ", "5 \n14.  Lessons. The experience ADB gained from subprogram 1 and from implementing project \ninvestments shows that an enabling policy and implementation environment is a prerequisite for \nscaling up clean energy and inclusive energy access, and policy uncertainty can lead to delays \nor even project cancellation.18 This lesson is highlighted by the geothermal subsector where, \nduring 2010\u20132014, few projects were initiated despite the availability of concessional finance.19 \nSimilarly, prior ADB investments in energy efficiency were only moderately successful in the face \nof low tariffs and lack of incentives.20 ADB\u2019s experience in rural electrification highlighted the need \nfor a national program that integrates grid-based and off-grid approaches, and private and public \ninvestment.21 Finally,  experience  with  policy-based  loans  for  infrastructure  development  in \nIndonesia has underlined the need for such operations to be anchored to the government\u2019s reform \nprogram, reflect an incremental approach to reform, and focus on translating high-level sector \nregulatory reform into sustainable subsector actions. \n \n15.  ADB\u2019s value addition. ADB has directly supported the completion of reforms under \nsubprogram 2 (footnote 14). TA for the Sustainable and Inclusive Energy Program supported \ninvestment needs analysis and subsidy calculations to underpin the development of an improved \nregulatory approach for PLN based on performance, while ongoing results-based loans have \nidentified aspects of PLN\u2019s operational practices that can be improved.22 ADB also supported a \nframework for gas pricing and an updated gas infrastructure master plan; tariff schemes and \nincentives for renewables (including solar, geothermal, and wind); implementation regulations for \nthe revised 2014 Geothermal Law; and the development of least-cost electrification plans in \nsupport of the national electrification program.23 On energy efficiency, ADB helped prepare the \nregulation that established ESCOs and minimum energy performance standards for household \nappliances, and supported the development of a national pilot program on energy-efficient \nstreetlights in 73 cities.24 ADB also supported the preparation of a pilot CCS project and the \nestablishment of a CCS and CCUS center of excellence in Indonesia, which will help catalyze \nnational capacity for scaling up projects in the near term.25 \n \n16.  The proposed program supports ADB\u2019s CPS 2016\u20132019 for Indonesia, which has a strong \nfocus on improved infrastructure services, including energy infrastructure. Under its energy sector \nstrategy for Indonesia, ADB through its sovereign operations, is: (i) undertaking sector policy \nreform to make access to energy sustainable and inclusive; (ii) strengthening the reach, reliability, \nand efficiency of the nation\u2019s electricity grid; and (iii) enabling greater use of clean energy, \nincluding gas-fired power generation. ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department is supporting \nliquefied natural gas production in eastern Indonesia, de-risking of geothermal exploration and \ndevelopment, and gas-to-power projects. Given the synergies between sector policies and project \noutcomes, ADB\u2019s energy strategy as detailed in the CPS will be delivered through closely linked \n                                                \n18 B.

Development partner coordination. Since the initiation of the program in late 2014, ADB \nhas led the donor group directly financing the program, namely, the French Development Agency \n(AFD), German development cooperation through KfW, and the World Bank. Coordination is \nensured through parallel cofinancing of TA activities and joint review missions. AFD provided \n$150 million, KfW $200 million, and the World Bank $500 million as parallel cofinancing for \nsubprogram 1; and they plan to provide cofinancing for subprogram 2 as well. Likewise, there is \nclose collaboration between ADB and the donors through cofinancing of energy sector projects. \nAFD is cofinancing two ADB loans and KfW is providing parallel cofinancing for another ADB loan. \nAlongside ADB\u2019s $600 million results-based loan for grid strengthening in Sumatra, the World \nBank provided a $600 million program-for-results loan based on a similar set of disbursement-\nlinked indicators.26 ADB also closely coordinates energy sector policy dialogue with the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, which has large ongoing investments in geothermal energy \nprojects,  coal-fired  power  plants,  and  high-voltage  power  interconnections,  and  with  the \ngovernments of Australia, Denmark, Germany, New Zealand, Norway, the United Kingdom, and \nthe United States.27  \n \n18.  The policy-based loan and budget support. The government has persevered with \nsector reform even in an environment of low global energy prices, slow economic growth and \nfiscal constraints.28 Given the medium-term horizon required for energy sector reforms and the \ngovernment\u2019s demonstrated commitment, ADB\u2019s choice of a programmatic approach over 2015\u2013\n2019, with three subprograms and a medium-term results framework through 2023, remains \nrelevant. The third subprogram is planned for 2019. \n \n19.  At the inception of the programmatic approach in 2014, the government agreed to \n22 indicative policy actions as a basis for subprogram 2. During processing of the second \nsubprogram, at the government\u2019s request, ADB agreed to refine some actions to streamline the \npolicy matrix.29 Six actions were merged into three as they were related and complementary. Two \nimportant actions that were not originally in the policy matrix were added\u2014(i) a comprehensive \nset of government guarantees for the electricity subsector, and (ii) technical specifications for off-\ngrid energy projects\u2014and two actions were postponed to subprogram 3\u2014(i) guidelines for \nimplementation of electricity wheeling, and (ii) a new gas supply chain management regulation. \nThe revised subprogram 2 now contains 19 reform actions (9 disbursement triggers and 10 policy \nmilestones), which the government completed from October 2015 to June 2017 (Appendix 4).30 \nADB will continue to support additional analysis and stakeholder consultations for ongoing actions \nduring subprogram 3, which contains 21 policy actions (9 disbursement triggers and 12 policy \nmilestones). \n \n20.  Economic impact of the program. The three outputs of the program described in paras. \n22\u201327 are expected to increase public and private investment in the energy sector, enabling the \ngovernment to continue the transition to a cleaner, sustainable, and more inclusive sector. \n                                                \n26 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 The governments of Australia and the United Kingdom have provided grant financing for technical assistance \nactivities that supported specific policy actions or analytical work. See footnotes 14 and 25.  \n28 Government revenues have decreased by about $21 billion in 2016. As the law limits the annual national budget \ndeficit to 3% of the gross domestic product, government spending plans for infrastructure will be constrained. \n29 Reconciliation of the Policy Matrix from the Original Subprogram 2 to the Revised Subprogram 2 (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 Triggers are disbursement conditions, while policy milestones help strengthen the program. ", "7 \nEconomic gains are expected through: (i) efficiency gains in the power sector that accrue through \nincreased tariffs and better governance of public sector energy enterprises; (ii) gains from lower \nregulatory cost burdens, and a more streamlined context for facilitating increased private sector \ninvestment  in  energy  markets;  and  (iii)  economic  growth  resulting  from  an  accelerated \nelectrification program, and greater use of renewables and energy efficiency. The potential \neconomic gains are described in para. 32. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n21.  The impact will be increased domestic energy security and access to modern forms of \nenergy, as reflected in the RPJMN. The outcome will be increased supply from sustainable and \nmore  accessible  energy  sources.  The  policy  matrix  includes  a  medium-term  framework  of \nexpected results and anticipated achievements. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n22.  Output 1: Fiscal sustainability and sector governance improved. This output aims to \n(i) continue the transition to cost-reflective tariffs for electricity, and (ii) further improve PLN\u2019s \nfinancial and service delivery performance. Alongside periodically adjusted power tariffs for large \nusers,  the  government  has  phased  out  subsidies  for  the  remaining  household  consumer \ncategories, unless the household is classified as poor in the government\u2019s integrated social safety \nnet database. This will lead to higher tariffs for 22 million out of the 45 million consumers in these \ncategories, and reduce annual subsidy payments to PLN by at least $2.1 billion in 2017. The \ndiesel subsidy was reduced from Rp1,000 to Rp500 per liter, which will save the government $2.5 \nbillion in 2017. In preparation for full-fledged economic regulation for PLN, the government \nestablished reporting requirements for electricity business licensees, including PLN, on their \noperating assets, in addition to service quality standards. \n \n23.  For subprogram 3, the government will implement a new tariff framework, including \nrationalized tariffs for consolidated consumer categories that consider cost-recovery principles, \nand targeted support for the poor and vulnerable. It will also introduce a performance-based \napproach as the basis for any public service obligation payments to PLN, which balances financial \nsustainability  with  better  practices  and  procedures.  ADB\u2019s  recent  assessments  of  PLN\u2019s \nprocurement  and  safeguard  procedures  have  identified  opportunities  for  improvement  in \nprocurement and safeguard practices, such as better waste management practices, which PLN \nwill mainstream under subprogram 3.  \n \n24.  Output 2: Private participation in power and gas markets enabled. Actions under this \noutput deepen support for planning, financing, and delivering energy projects; and for promoting \ndomestic gas production and supply into the domestic market. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral \nResources  (MEMR)  and  BKPM  further  simplified  the  licensing  process  for  power  plants, \ntransmission line projects, and selected projects in oil and gas. To secure financing for power \nsystem expansion, the government increased its guarantee program by budgeting up to $27.4 \nbillion  to  provide  credit  guarantees  for  PLN\u2019s  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction \ncontracts, and extending investment guarantees for private power projects.31 It expanded support \nfor private investments in the upstream gas market by improving fiscal terms for the exploration \nof unconventional resources and introducing a process for the sale of flared gas for use in various \npower applications. It also took measures to increase the use of natural gas in the domestic \n                                                \n31 Independent power producers are expected to provide most of the new capacity in the government\u2019s expansion \nplans, representing about $78 billion in investment. \n ", "8 \nmarket, including lowering the price of gas for certain industries that use gas as a raw material; \nintroducing a new risk- and revenue-sharing model for new PSC blocks; and allowing large users \nlike PLN to import liquefied natural gas for power plants. Also, the government established a \nmechanism to pre-finance activities in expiring PSCs by the incoming operator to prevent any \nproduction decrease during the transition, along with issuing a gas infrastructure master plan and \nan updated gas supply-and-demand balance. These reforms have helped increase investment in \noil and gas by over 24% from 2014 to 2016 despite low global gas prices. \n \n25.  For subprogram 3, the government will implement private sector-led power wheeling \narrangements and, in the gas market, establish a gas tolling structure and a national gas \ntransmission network, introduce new fiscal incentives to encourage oil and gas exploration and \nproduction, and prepare policy papers in anticipation of the deliberations on the new draft oil and \ngas law in Parliament. This law is expected to expand the role of other SOEs and private sector \nparticipation in midstream and downstream gas markets. \n \n26.  Output 3: Regulatory environment for increased access to clean energy options \nimproved. Actions under this output aim to (i) expand geothermal energy generation potential, \n(ii) increase  support  for  other  renewable  energy  sources,  (iii)  expand  access  to  electricity, \n(iv) improve standards and policies for energy efficiency, and (v) minimize the energy sector\u2019s \nenvironmental impacts. Continuing its efforts under subprogram 1, the government has issued \nimplementing regulations to the revised Geothermal Law that provide guidance on tendering of \nnew concessions, sharing of revenue with local governments, and accessing forest land for \ngeothermal power development. It also issued guidance for procurement of renewables-based \nelectricity by PLN to support the first gigawatt of solar power and 280 megawatts of wind capacity \nin the country, and an additional 4 gigawatts of geothermal capacity by 2023, including stipulation \nof ceiling prices for each renewable energy technology.32 The government has expanded its focus \non electrification through efforts led by PLN and local governments, budgeted $38 million in 2017 \nin special allocation funds for local governments, and set technical standards for renewable \nenergy power plants in off-grid and remote areas. In terms of energy efficiency, the government \nestablished the legal basis for ESCOs and prepared draft regulations to expand the number of \nappliances governed by efficiency standards and labels. It also launched a nationwide program \nfor energy-efficient streetlights in 73 cities. To lower emissions from the electricity subsector, the \ngovernment is supporting the deployment of waste-to-energy projects and the pilot-testing of CCS \nand/or CCUS technologies. \n \n27.  For subprogram 3, the government will update benchmark prices for renewable energy, \nput in place nontariff incentives to further spur its deployment, and prepare a road map for \nintegrating a higher percentage of renewables into the country\u2019s generation mix. It will scale up \nthe  national  electrification  effort  through  public  and  private  business  models  and  initiate \ndemonstration-scale CCS and/or CCUS projects. It will also develop a market for ESCOs and \nestablish a national program of MEPS, labeling, and enforcement for appliances (see para. 31).33 \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n28.  The government has requested (i) a regular loan of $400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources (A loan), and (ii) a loan of $100 million funded through the participation of the \n                                                \n32 The regulation stipulates that PLN must buy electricity from renewable energy sources to meet national targets, \ndevelop standardized procurement documents and power purchase agreements, and preferentially dispatch \nelectricity from all renewable energy projects with a capacity below 10 megawatts when they are available. The \ngovernment has also indicated that it will periodically review the stated ceiling prices and revise them if necessary.  \n33 The development policy letter is in Appendix 3. ", "9 \nASEAN Infrastructure Fund (B loan) to help finance subprogram 2.34 The loans will have a 15-\nyear term, including a grace period of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge \nof 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \nBased on the straight-line method, the average loan maturity is 9.25 years, with no maturity \npremium payable to ADB. The proceeds of the loans will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). Financing will be disbursed on a \npro rata basis of 80% for the A loan and 20% for the B loan. \n \n29.  The gross financing needs for 2017 are $48.7 billion, with an estimated budget deficit of \n2.6%\u20132.9% of gross domestic product and development financing needs of $24.8 billion. To \nfinance the deficit, the government plans to raise $44.9 billion from the issuance of securities and \n$3.8 billion  from  official  foreign  loans.  The  size  of  subprogram  2  primarily  reflects  the \ngovernment\u2019s  financing  needs,  the  strength  of  the  reform  program,  and  its  development \nexpenditure, such as costs of electrification and support for renewable energy.35 For subprogram \n2, development partners have confirmed their contribution of the equivalent of about $320 million \nin collaborative parallel financing ($110 million equivalent from AFD and $210 million equivalent \nfrom KfW).  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n30.  The Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs as the executing agency is responsible for \noverall program implementation and facilitates inter-ministerial cooperation on energy issues. It \nhas established a policy coordination team to oversee overall program monitoring and reporting.36 \nMEMR, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, and BKPM are the \nimplementing  agencies.  The  implementation  periods  are  October  2015\u2013June  2017  for \nsubprogram 2 and July 2017\u2013September 2019 for subprogram 3. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n31.  The attached TA will support MEMR in scaling up energy efficiency programs in the \ncountry by (i) rolling out minimum efficiency performance standards and a labeling program for \nseveral  household  appliances;  (ii)  accrediting  national  testing  laboratories for  the  identified \nappliances; (iii) establishing the regulatory basis for ESCOs to serve the needs of government \nentities; and (iv) improving capacity for energy savings performance contracting.37 The TA is \nestimated to cost $1,100,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Clean \nEnergy Fund38 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n32.  The  program  delivers  positive  macroeconomic contributions,  with  economic  benefits \naveraging $7.6 billion per year and readily exceeding economic costs of $5.7 billion per year \n                                                \n34 Climate mitigation is estimated at $230 million. Climate finance represents 58% of ADB financing for the program. \n35 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n36 The Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs\u2019 Ministerial Decree No. 72/2016 established a Sustainable Energy \nManagement and Energy Access Program Policy Coordination Team. \n37 Attached Technical Assistance Report: Scaling Up Energy Efficiency (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n38 Financing partners: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. \n ", "10 \n(footnote 35). Higher electricity tariffs will lead to (i) fiscal savings that can support infrastructure \ndevelopment  and  welfare  programs,  with  related  multiplier  effects  across  the  economy; \n(ii) stimulation of investment and capacity expansion in the electricity subsector, to boost gross \ndomestic product; and (iii) the promotion of energy efficiency. Better sector governance will help \nlower borrowing costs and improve financial sustainability. Greater private investment in the \nenergy  sector  will  help  increase  domestic  energy  production  and  lead  to  economy-wide \nemployment benefits. Increasing access to clean energy options will reduce the expansion in \ncoal-fired  power  generation  and  related  air  pollution,  while  promoting  economic  growth  in \npreviously underserved areas. To the extent that clean energy will displace diesel generation, the \nprogram will also help save on oil imports and improve the country\u2019s balance of payments. Energy \nefficiency measures will reduce total added generation capacity needs. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n33.  The government has made considerable progress in improving the legal and regulatory \nframework for financial management.  Since  the  enactment  of  laws  on  state finance, state \ntreasury, and state audit in 2003\u20132004, most regulations underpinning these laws have been \npromulgated. In 2012, the number of government agencies that received an unqualified audit \nopinion from the external audit agency increased to 65% (from about 40% in 2009). ADB has \nreinforced this momentum with continuing support to improve state audit technical capacity. Also, \nthe government continued to improve the regulatory framework governing procurement, including \nan emphasis on transparency in the tendering of energy projects. Standardized bidding and \nprocurement documents also help strengthen governance in the sector. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n34.  Reforms under the program will increase access to modern forms of energy, stimulate \neconomic growth, and help create jobs\u2014all key elements in reducing poverty. The program is \nclassified general intervention, since its proposed outputs benefit all citizens, including the poor \nand vulnerable. Output 3 will positively impact the poor by increasing their access to energy and \nstimulating rural and peri-urban small businesses; add value to agriculture, fishing, and forestry; \nand reduce household exposure to indoor air pollution from burning biomass for heat and cooking.  \nWhile subprogram 2 is classified no gender elements, women will benefit substantially from the \nprogram. Having a reliable and affordable electricity supply will reduce the time and energy that \nwomen spend gathering fuel. It will also enable women to run income-generating activities such \nas sewing and food processing from their own homes. Communities will be able to pump and \nstore water, and having well-lit streets will deter crime and reduce incidences of violence against \ngirls and women. 39 \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n35.  Subprogram 2 is classified category B for the environment and category C for involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous people. The envisaged reforms will not entail direct environmental \nimpacts, involuntary land acquisition, or activities in indigenous peoples\u2019 areas. Any potential \nindirect social and environmental impacts arising from increased investment in the energy sector \nwill be evaluated on a project-by-project basis as required by Indonesia\u2019s environmental and land \n                                                \n39 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "11 \nacquisition  legislation  and  the  requirements  of  lenders  and  project  sponsors.40 Mitigation \nmeasures for indirect impacts identified in subprogram 1 have been implemented or initiated. Two \nmitigation actions to counter any indirect environmental risks emanating from subprogram 2\u2014(i) \nthe  development  of  guidelines  and  requirements  to  use  certain  types  of  forest  areas  for \ngeothermal power development activity, and (ii) environmental permitting and impact assessment \nguidelines  for  CCS  and  CCUS\u2014have  been  included  as  mitigation  measures  and  will  be \naccomplished under subprogram 3. The government continues to have the institutional capacity \nand commitment to manage any such risks. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n36.  The main risks to the program\u2019s success arise from the potential for (i) macroeconomic \ninstability, (ii) significant declines in oil and gas prices, (iii) resistance within the legislative process \nto increase private sector participation in the energy sector, and (iv) regulatory backsliding owing \nto changes in Parliament. These and other risks are classified substantial or moderate. The \nprogram\u2019s overall risk level is moderate, and its benefits outweigh its costs.41 \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n37.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 2 shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement, as described in detail in the loan \nagreement. No disbursement shall be made unless ADB is satisfied that the government has \ncompleted the policy actions specified in the policy matrix relating to the program. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n38.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loans would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n(i)  the A loan of $400,000,000 to the Republic of Indonesia for Subprogram 2 of \nSustainable and Inclusive Energy Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nin regular terms, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 15 years, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement \npresented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the B loan not exceeding the equivalent of $100,000,000 to the Republic of \nIndonesia for the Sustainable and Inclusive Energy Program to be funded through \nthe participation of the ASEAN Infrastructure Fund on terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n Takehiko Nakao \n                   President \n \n21 August 2017 \n                                                \n40 Environmental and Social Impact Assessment of the Policy Matrix (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n41 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "12  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Program is Aligned with \nDomestic energy security and access to modern forms of energy increased (National Medium-Term Development \nPlan, 2015\u20132019)a \n  Data Sources \nand Reporting \nResults Chain   Performance Indicators with Targets and Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2020:    Macroeconomic \nSupply from  a.
