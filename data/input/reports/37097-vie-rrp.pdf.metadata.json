This  limits  access  to  markets, \ninputs  (including  irrigation  water),  and  public  services  (such  as \neducation  and  health  services),  and  increases  vulnerability  to \ndisasters.  It  also  reduces  the  impact  of  public  and  private \ninvestment made in other sectors (such as agriculture, health, and \neducation)  that  depend  upon  effective  rural  infrastructure.  In  the \nproject  area,  only  30%  of  provincial  roads  have  all-weather \nsurfaces;  this  severely  limits  communications  in  rural  areas  and \nincreases \nfor  agricultural \nenterprises.  Irrigation  systems  have  deteriorated  over  time  and \nare not able to deliver the water needed to achieve full coverage \nof  service  areas.  Fifty  percent  of  rural  households  do  not  have \naccess to clean water supplies, and defective or deficient coastal \ninfrastructure  can  not  prevent  the  intrusion  of  seawater  into  crop \nlands  and  domestic  water  supplies,  resulting  in  reduced  crop \nyields and an increase in the cost of drinking water. \n\ntransport  costs \n\ntimes  and \n\ntravel \n\n \n\n \n\n\fii \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nin \n\nthe \n\nin  rural \n\nimprovement \n\ninfrastructure \n\nPast experience of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other \ndonors \nface  of \nchallenges  similar  to  those  in  Viet  Nam  have  generally  been \nfavorable.  All  completed  ADB  projects  in  the  sector  have  been \nassessed  as  successful  and  all  were  able  to  achieve  a  wider \nimpact  than  intended  in  the  original  scope.  Independent  studies \nhave  demonstrated  significant \ninfrastructure \ninvestments of all types. The improvement in rural infrastructure in \nViet  Nam  over  the  past  decade  is  considered  to  be  one  of  the \nreasons  for  the  significant  growth  achieved  in  the  agriculture \nsector and the concomitant decline in poverty. \n\nimpact \n\nfrom \n\nFurther  investment  in  rural  infrastructure,  especially  in  the  rural \nareas of the Central Region where poverty levels remain high, is \ntherefore  seen  as  a  key  to  removing  the  constraints  on  the \nproductivity  in  the  project  area  and  hence  contributing  both  to \nreducing  poverty  and  diminishing  the  likelihood  that  people  who \nhave recently escaped the poverty trap will fall back into it. \n\nThe  overall  impact  of  the  Project  is  expected  to  enhance  rural \nlivelihood  opportunities  and  standard  of  living  for  the  rural \npopulation  residing  in  the  Central  Region  of  Viet  Nam.  This  is  to \nbe achieved through improved quality, great coverage and better \nintegration  of \ninfrastructure. \nIncreased  agricultural \nproductivity,  wider  employment  opportunities,  improved  health \nand  education  levels,  and  reduced  exposure  to  natural  disasters \nwill collectively improve standards of living for the rural population. \n\nrural \n\nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  SDR  58,723,000  from \nthe Asian Development Fund to help finance the Project. The loan \nwill have a 32-year maturity including a grace period of 8 years, a \n1%  interest  charge  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  during  the \namortization  period.  The  Project  will  be  jointly  cofinanced  with  a \nloan  by  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD)  in  the \namount  of  \u20ac40  million  ($52.0  million  equivalent).  AFD  will  also \nprovide cofinancing on a grant basis in the amount of \u20ac1.0 million \n($1.3 million equivalent). The proceeds of the loans and the grant \nwill  be  passed  as  a  grant  to  the  13  participating  provincial \ngovernments  by  the  national  Government.  The  balance  of  the \nproject  cost  ($24.8  million  equivalent)  amounting  to  15%  will  be \nfunded  by \nthe  Government  and  participating  provincial \ngovernments from provincial budgets. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nThe investment cost of the Project is estimated at $168.2 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $13.1 million. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nPeriod of Utilization \n\nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \nExecuting Agency \n\nUntil 30 June 2014 \n \n31 December 2013 \n \nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) \n\n\fImplementation \nArrangements \n\nProcurement \n\nthe \n\nrural \n\nroads, \n\nthe  principles  of  decentralization  and \n\n \n \nIn  keeping  with \nthe \ndevolution of responsibilities, the implementing agencies (IAs) for \nrespective  provincial \ninfrastructure  subprojects  will  be \npeoples\u2019  committees  (PPCs)  of  the  13  participating  provinces.  A \nCentral  Project  Management  Unit  (CPMU)  established  within  the \nAgriculture  Project  Management  Board  of  MARD,  will  be \nresponsible  for  project  implementation  at  the  national  level.  At \nprovincial level, day-to-day management will be the responsibility \nof  provincial  project  management  units  (PPMUs)  established  by \nPPCs  of  participating  provinces  within  the  provincial  Department \nof  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (DARD).  A  two-stage \nprocess  for  the  identification  and  preparation  of  subprojects  will \nbe adopted. Firstly, subproject proposals will be selected by PPCs \nfrom  priority \ninvestments  within  provincial  socio-economic \ndevelopment plans (SEDPs). Subprojects chosen should support \nsector  objectives  mainly  comprising \nirrigation \n(including  drainage  and  flood  control),  domestic  water  supply, \nmarkets, and coastal infrastructure with an estimated cost ranging \nfrom $0.5 million to $4 million. These will be confirmed through a \nprocess  of  public  consultation  with  potential  beneficiaries  and \nother  stakeholders,  after  which  a  subproject \nidentification \nproposal  (SIP)  will  be  prepared  by  the  PPMU,  submitted  to  the \nCPMU and, if over $2 million, submitted to ADB for concurrence. \nThe  second  stage  involves  the  preparation  of  a  subproject \ninvestment report (SIR). Upon completion of the SIR, first the PPC \nand  then  the  CPMU  will  review  the  studies  to  ensure  that  they \nmeet  the  eligibility  criteria  for  implementation  financing  and  any \nother internal requirements that may be imposed by the province \nor  the  national  Government.  The  first  SIP  of  less  than  $2  million \nfrom  the  provinces  covered  earlier under  the  Rural  Infrastructure \nSector  Project  (RISP),  and  the  first  SIP  under  $2  million  from \nother  provinces  which  do  not  have  prior  experience  of \nimplementing  the  RISP,  will  also  be  submitted  to  ADB  for \napproval.  The  PPMUs  will  then  be  responsible  for  supervising \ndetailed design and construction of the approved subprojects. \n \nProcurement  will  be  undertaken  by  the  CPMU  and  PPMUs. \nGoods  and  works \nin \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  Contracts  for  works  valued  at  over \n$2  million  equivalent  shall  be  procured  through  international \ncompetitive  bidding  (ICB),  in  accordance  with  ADB  Procurement \nGuidelines. The first five SIPs prepared shall be submitted to ADB \nfor approval on a no-objection basis. Smaller packages for works \nvalued  at  less  than  $2  million  or  equivalent  but  more  than \n$100,000  or  equivalent  shall  be  procured  through  national \ncompetitive bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to ADB using a \none-stage,  two-envelope  system.  For  works  below  $100,000 \nequivalent,  shopping  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  may  be \n\nfinanced  by  ADB  will  be  procured \n\niii \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\nConsulting Services \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nthrough \n\nused.  Contracts  for  goods  valued  at  over  $500,000  equivalent \nshall  be  procured \nin  accordance  with  ADB \nICB \nProcurement  Guidelines.  Goods  costing  less  than  $500,000 \nequivalent  but  more  than  $100,000  shall  be  procured  through \ntwo-envelope  system \nNCB  procedures  using  a  one-stage, \nacceptable  to  ADB.  Smaller  packages  for  goods  valued  at  less \nthan  $100,000  may  be  procured  through  shopping  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. \n\nimplementation  and  capacity-building \n\nThe  Project  will  require  three  types  of  consulting  services: \n(i) international  and  national  consulting  services  to  assist  the \nCPMU  with  implementation  and  training;  (ii)  national  consultants \nthe  preparation  of  environmental, \nto  assist  PPMUs  with \nresettlement, and social safeguards for SIPs and SIRs (including \nassociated  environmental  assessments  and  resettlement  plans); \nand  (iii)  national  engineering  consultants  to  prepare  detailed \nengineering  designs  and  supervise  construction  of  works.  To \nsupport \nthe \nProject  will  fund  a  total  of  60  person-months  of  international \nspecialists  and  271  person-months  of  national  specialists  for  a \ntotal  of  331  person-months.  Consultants  will  be  selected  and \nengaged in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  AFD\u2019s \nprocurement  regulations.  The  CPMU  will  be  responsible  for  the \nrecruitment  of  project  implementation  consultants  through  a  firm \nusing  quality  and  cost  based  selection.  National  consultants \nfacilitating  community  participation  and  providing  advice  on \nsafeguards to the provincial governments will be recruited by the \nCPMU  from  national  firms  using  the  consultants\u2019  qualification \nselection (CQS). PPMUs will be responsible for recruiting national \nconsultants  to  provide  technical  specialists  for  design  and \nsupervision of works using CQS procedures acceptable to ADB. \n\ninitiatives, \n\nline,  whose \nthe \n\nincomes  and \nlack  of  access \n\nThe  intended  beneficiaries  are  productive  members  of  the  rural \npopulation  in  areas  impacted  by  subprojects.  They  are  mainly \nfarmers  and  their  families  who  are  poor  or  live  just  above  the \nlivelihoods  are  currently \npoverty \nimpaired  by \nto  markets,  employment \nopportunities, and services. Other groups of beneficiaries include \n(i)  road  users,  (ii)  general  goods  and  service  providers,  (iii) \nsuppliers  of  agricultural  products  and  services,  (iv)  people \nengaged  in  marketing,  (v)  agricultural  cooperatives,  (vi)  water \nuser  groups  or  associations, \nirrigation  management \ncompanies,  and  (viii)  stakeholder  agencies.  Measures  are  built \ninto the project design to ensure that women and ethnic minorities \nalso benefit from the Project. \n\n(vii) \n\nThe Project will produce a range of economic benefits which vary \ndepending on the type of infrastructure identified for rehabilitation. \nRural  road  investments  have  been  shown  to  produce  a  broad \nrange  of  positive  impacts,  ranging  from  immediate  benefits  such \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fas reduced travel costs and times, to less direct benefits such as \n(i)  a  diversification  of  income  sources,  (ii)  higher  levels  of \nagriculture  production,  (iii)  greater  diversification  of  agriculture \ncrops,  (iv)  greater  access  to  health  and  education  services,  (v) \nreduced  costs  of  inputs  and  household  commodities,  and  (vi) \noverall  reduced  levels  of  poverty  among  communities  served  by \nthe  roads.  The  primary  direct  benefit  from  irrigation  subprojects \nwill  be  increased  agricultural  production  and  the  diversification \ninto  higher  value  crops.  The  benefits  from  improved  coastal \ninfrastructure are broad and varied but include (i) increased crop \nyields,  (ii)  safer  drinking  water  due  to  the  prevention  of  saline \nintrusions,  (iii)  increased  aquaculture  and  salt  production,  (iv) \nreduced  loss  of  farm  land  from  dune  encroachment,  and  (v) \nenhanced  fisheries  due  to  mangrove  rehabilitation.  The  benefits \nof improved domestic water supplies include (i) reduced incidence \nof  water-borne  diseases,  and  (ii)  reduced  time  and  labor  spent \nfetching  water  (especially  for  women  and  children),  releasing \nlabor  resources  for  more  productive  economic  activities  or \neducation.  Improved  attention \nto  planning  and  prioritization \nprocesses  in  design  and  management  of  rural  infrastructure \ninvestments  should  lead  to  efficient  and  targeted  resource \nallocation.  The  cumulative  net  overall  economic  benefits  include \n(i) improved accessibility in rural areas of the Central Region, (ii) \nhigher levels of agriculture and aquaculture production, (iii) lower \ncosts  of  agricultural  inputs  and  consumer  commodities,  (iv) \nenhanced access to markets, (v) responsive investment planning, \nand  (vi)  a  broader  range  of  economic  opportunities  both  within \nand  beyond  the  agricultural  sector.  As  a  consequence,  the \nsignificant  social  impacts  include  (i)  improved  livelihoods,  (ii) \nfewer  poor  communities  in  the  area,  (iii)  higher  levels  of \neducation, and (iv) improved public health. \n\nThe  project  design  assumes  that  the  participating  provincial \ngovernments  have  the  capacity  and  technical  skills  to  identify, \nplan,  design,  and  implement  medium-scale  rural  infrastructure \nrehabilitation  and  upgrading  but  that  they  lack  the  financial \nresources for these purposes. This assumption is proven valid by \nthe  successful  implementation  of  the  predecessor  project,  the \nRISP,  which  was  implemented  to  sound  technical  standards \nwithin  the  designed  implementation  period  and  within  budget. \nImplementing  such  a  project  at  the  provincial  level  in  Viet  Nam \ndoes, however, carry certain risks. Not all provincial governments \nare  adequately  skilled  at  (i)  identifying  high-priority  and  strategic \nsubproject  investments,  (ii)  dealing  with  environmental  or  social \nimpact  issues  (except  for  land  acquisition  matters),  or  (iii) \nappreciating the need for full public consultation. Moreover, many \nprovincial  governments  do  not  fully  appreciate  the  importance  of \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  funding  for  completed  civil \nworks.  The  project  design,  through  carefully  selected  eligibility \ncriteria  and  capacity-building  support,  incorporates  measures  to \nensure  that  these  concerns  are  dealt  with  and  mitigated  to  the \n\nv \n\n \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n\fTechnical Assistance \n\n \n\nextent  necessary  and  feasible,  and  assurances  have  been  given \nby  the  Government  that  structures  built  under  the  Project  will  be \nfully  maintained.  The  overwhelming  direct  and  indirect  benefits \nexpected  from  the  Project  thus  indicate  that  the  impact  will \noutweigh any possible social, environmental, or financial risks the \nProject might face. \n\nThe  CPMU  and  PPMUs  will  be  provided  with  an  advisory \ntechnical  assistance  to  (i)  provide  guidance  and  assistance  at \nboth  national  and  provincial  levels for  further  policy  development \nwith  a  focus  on  O&M,  and  (ii)  ensure  that  both  Viet  Nam\u2019s  and \nADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies  and  procedures  are  understood  and \nfollowed during project implementation. This technical assistance \nwill be implemented prior to and during project start-up and during \nthe first 2 years of implementation. The main thrust of new policy \nimprovement will be a thorough analysis of O&M arrangements of \ninfrastructure funding by provincial governments. The main thrust \nof the support for policy compliance will be to ensure that project \nmanagement  is  established  on  a  sound  financial  and  procedural \nbasis  and \nthat  ADB  and  Government  concerns  regarding \nsafeguards,  the  prevention  of  graft  and  corruption,  procurement, \nand  community  involvement  are  fully  taken  into  account  during \nday-to-day  project  implementation  activities.  The  cost  of  the \ntechnical  assistance  is  estimated  at  $1.1  million  of  which  $1.0 \nmillion will be funded on a grant basis; the balance will be funded \nby the Government.  \n\nvi \n\n \n \n \n\n\fo\n103  00\u2019E\n\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC\nOF  CHINA\n\no\n108  00\u2019E\n\nHa Giang\n\n7\n\n9\n\nCao Bang\n\nSOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF VIET NAM\nINTEGRATED RURAL\nDEVELOPMENT SECTOR PROJECT IN\nTHE CENTRAL PROVINCES\n\n1\n\nLai Chau\n\nLao Cai\n\n4\n\n6\n\n10\nBac Kan\n\n8\nYen Bai\n\nTuyen Quang\n11\n\n16\n\nThai Nguyen\n\nLang Son\n\nSon La\n\nPhu Tho\n5\n\n12\n\nVinh Phuc\n13\n\n18\nBac Giang\n\n17\n\n2\n\nDien Bien\n\n3\n\nHA NOI\n\n15\n\n20\n\nHoa Binh\n\n23\n\n24\n\n14\n\n19\n\nHai\nDuong\n\n21\n\nHai Phong\n\n22\nThai Binh\n\nHa Long\n\n25\n\n26\nNinh Binh\n\nThanh Hoa\n\n27\n\n28\n\nVinh\n\nHa Tinh\n\n29\n\n20  00\u2019No\n\nGulf   of   Tonkin\n\n20  00\u2019No\n\nLAO PEOPLE'S\nDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n200\n\nParticipatory Project Province\n\nN\n\nKilometers\n\nNational Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nNational Road\n\nOther Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\nGulf   of   Thailand\n\nDong Hoi\n\n30\n\nDong Ha\n\n31\n\nHue\n\n32\n\nDa Nang\n\nHoi An\n\n33\n\n34\n\n35\n\nQuang Ngai\n\n36\n\nKon Tum\n\n38\n\nPleiku\n\n37\n\nQuy Nhon\n\n39\n\nTuy Hoa\n\n40\n\nBuon Ma\nThuot\n\nNha Trang\n\nDak Nong\n\n41\n\nDa Lat\n\n42\n\n44\n\nPhan Rang-\nThap Cham\n\nPhan Thiet\n\nSOUTH   CHINA\nSEA\n\nCAMBODIA\n\n46\n\nTay Ninh\n\n47\n\nThu Dau Mot\n\nBien Hoa\n\n45\n\nBinh\nLong\n\n48\n\n50\n\n43\n\n49\n\nHo Chi Minh City\n\nVung Tau\n\n52\nTan An\n53\n\n54\n\n55\n\nLong Xuyen\n\nRach Gia\n\nVinh Long\n\n58\nCan Tho\n\n59\n\n57\nHau Giang\n56\n\n62\n\n51\n\nMy Tho\n\n60\n\nBen Tre\n\n61\n\nTra Vinh\n\n63\n\nSoc Trang\n\nCa Mau\n\nBac Lieu\n\n64\n\nPROVINCES\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\n11.\n12.\n13.\n14.\n15.\n16.\n17.\n18.\n19.\n20.\n21.\n22.\n23.\n24.\n25.\n26.\n27.\n28.\n29.\n30.\n31.\n32.\n33.\n34.\n35.\n36.\n37.\n38.\n39.\n40.\n41.\n42.\n43.\n44.\n45.\n46.\n47.\n48.\n49.\n50.\n51.\n52.\n53.\n54.\n55.\n56.\n57.\n58.\n59.\n60.\n61.\n62.\n63.\n64.\n\nLai Chau\nDien Bien\nSon La\nLao Cai\nPhu Tho\nTuyen Quang\nHa Giang\nYen Bai\nCao Bang\nBac Kan\nThai Nguyen\nVinh Phuc\nHa Noi\nBac Ninh\nHung Yen\nLang Son\nQuang Ninh\nBac Giang\nHai Duong\nHa Tay\nHai Phong\nThai Binh\nHoa Binh\nHa Nam\nNinh Binh\nNam Dinh\nThanh Hoa\nNghe An\nHa Tinh\nQuang Binh\nQuang Tri\nThua Thien Hue\nDa Nang\nQuang Nam\nQuang Ngai\nKon Tum\nGia Lai\nBinh Dinh\nPhu Yen\nDak Lak\nDak Nong\nKhanh Hoa\nLam Dong\nNinh Thuan\nBinh Phuoc\nTay Ninh\nBinh Duong\nDong Nai\nBinh Thuan\nBa Ria - Vung Tau\nHo Chi Minh\nLong An\nTien Giang\nDong Thap\nAn Giang\nKien Giang\nHau Giang\nCan Tho\nVinh Long\nBen Tre\nTra Vinh\nSoc Trang\nBac Lieu\nCa Mau\n\no\n103  00\u2019E\n\no\n108  00\u2019E\n\n07-0502 HR\n\n12  00\u2019No\n\n12  00\u2019No\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Integrated Rural Development Sector Project \nin  the  Central  Provinces,  and  (ii)  proposed  administration  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) of a loan and a grant to be provided by Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) for \nthe  Project.  The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Infrastructure \nPolicy  Reform  Support  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n\nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nIn November 2004 ADB approved a project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) to \n2. \nhelp the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam formulate a project for rural infrastructure improvement \nin  the  country\u2019s  Central  Region.1 The  Project  was  to  be  modeled  on  the  Rural  Infrastructure \nSector  Project  (RISP),  approved  in  1997 2  and  completed  in  2004. 3  During  preparation,  a \ndecision  was  taken  to  amalgamate  the  proposed  Project  with  another  similar  project  being \nprepared  simultaneously  under  another  PPTA.4 This  report  is  based  on  findings  of  the  two \nPPTAs,  Government  feasibility  studies,  findings  of  ADB  missions,  and  discussions  with \ngovernment  officials  and  stakeholders.  The  project  design  and  monitoring  framework  is \npresented as Appendix 1. \n\n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nWhen  ADB  resumed  operations  in  Viet  Nam  in  the  early  1990s  the  country  was  very \n3. \nmuch rural based and poverty was a rural phenomenon. In 1993, 80% of the population lived in \nrural areas, and while the national level of poverty was 58.1%, the percentage of rural people \nliving  in  poverty  was  66.4%.  Since  then  Viet  Nam  has  made  remarkable  progress  in  poverty \nreduction. The overall poverty level has fallen to 23.2% but the rural population still accounts for \n70% of the country\u2019s population and levels of poverty remain higher in rural areas. In 2004, rural \npoverty levels were estimated at 26.4%5 in contrast to 13.7% in urban areas. \n\n \n\n \n\nOne  of  the  main  reasons  for  the  dramatic  advances  in  poverty  reduction  has  been  the \n4. \nstrong  growth  of  the  agriculture  sector,  which  is  the  mainstay  of  economic  activity  for  90%  of \nrural  households.  Despite  declining  commodity  prices  and  the  impact  of  the  Asian  economic \ncrisis, agricultural gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annual average of 4% over the past \ndecade  compared  with  the  economy\u2019s  annual  growth  rate  of  7%.  This  has  been  achieved \nthrough very high production growth rates in spite of depressed rural prices. For example, the \nproduction  of  rice,  the  country\u2019s  staple  crop,  grew  by  43%  between  1995  and  2005. 6 The \nincrease  in  production  of  other  crops  has  been  even  more  impressive,  with  maize  increasing \nmore than threefold and coffee and rubber production more than fourfold over the same period. \nNot  only  did  agricultural  production  increase,  but  there  was  also  deepening  of  the  domestic \n\n                                                 \n\n1   ADB.  2005.

Between  1990  and  2002,  vegetable,  pork,  poultry,  and \negg  production  per  capita  all  doubled.  Since  the  population  of  the  country  also  increased \nsignificantly during this period, this indicates something like a quadrupling of overall production.7 \n\n5. \nSignificant  reductions  in  the  level  of  poverty  in  the  rural  areas  were  also  achieved \nthrough other means. According to World Bank (WB) studies (footnote 7), 2.5 million people in \nrural  areas  were  provided  with  improved  rural  transport  infrastructure  during  the  last  decade. \nThis  has  resulted  in  greater  access  to  services  and  opportunities  and  has  contributed \nsignificantly  to  lower  rural  poverty  levels  -  access  to  off-farm  employment  and  markets  for \nnonfarm products. According to the same studies, only 25% of rural families currently rely solely \non agriculture for their incomes; the remaining 75% earn supplementary incomes from off-farm \nemployment or self-employment. In many areas, this is only possible due to increased access to \nmarkets  and  employment  opportunities  from  enhanced  transport  infrastructure.  Improved \naccess  to  clean  water  (a  major  factor  in  reducing  diseases),  and  increasing  the  availability  of \nproductive labor, especially among women, has also been impressive. Between 1993 and 2002, \nthe percentage of rural households with access to clean water increased from 18.1 to 39.6%.  \n\n6. \nHowever, much remains to be done. In addition to the 26.4% of the rural population still \nliving below the poverty line, a large part of the population has just emerged from poverty yet \nremains  vulnerable  to  economic  shocks  that  could  impact  on  recent  achievements.  Declining \nagriculture  commodity  prices  or  natural  disasters  could  still  push  many  rural  households  back \ninto  poverty.  Such  was  the  case  in  2005  when  a  series  of  major  typhoons  resulted  in  serious \ndamage to crops and infrastructure and a significant decline in paddy production. \n\n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n7. \nIn  Viet  Nam,  poverty  (especially  rural  poverty)  currently  has  a  geographic  and  ethnic \nbias.  The  highest  levels  of  poverty  in  the  country  are  the  Northwest  (51.9%)  and  the  North \nCentral Coast (36.5%) regions, while the highest absolute number of poor people is found in the \nNorth  Central  Coast  Region.  Thanh  Hoa  and  Nghe  An  provinces  (both  part  of  the  proposed \nproject  area)  have  the  highest  numbers  of  poor  people  in  the  country.  This  geographic \nconcentration  of  poverty  also  reflects  an  ethnic bias.  Areas with  the  highest  poverty  incidence \nalso have high numbers of ethnic minority peoples, and among ethnic minorities poverty levels \nare  still  as  high  as  69.3% 8  due,  in  part,  to  inaccessibility.  Poverty  in  Viet  Nam  is  a  rural \nphenomenon, focused to a large extent in the more isolated central and northern regions of the \ncountry,  disproportionately  affecting  ethnic  minorities.  This  is  especially  the  case  for  families \nwith  limited  land  resources  and  those  living  in  natural-disaster  prone  areas  such  as  coastal \nzones. In these areas, soils are typically poor, land holdings are small in size, and large areas \nare  subject  to  flooding  and  seawater  intrusion  during  seasonal  storms  and  typhoons.  This \nsituation prevails along much of the north-central coast, but also exists to a lesser extent along \nthe south-central coast.9 Efforts focused on poverty reduction will need to focus on these areas \nand the particular problems poor communities face. \n\nOne  of  the  main  causes  of  high  poverty  levels  is  inadequate  rural  and  coastal \n8. \ninfrastructure of all types (i.e., in the transport, agriculture, water, and environment subsectors). \nThis  manifests  itself  in  several  ways,  including  (i)  reduced  access  to  health  and  education \n\n                                                 \n\n7 Source: WB. 2006. Accelerating Viet Nam\u2019s Rural Development. Washington, DC. \n8 Based on 2002 figures. The 2004 figures are not yet available. \n9 Ironically, these same areas tend to suffer from drought during the dry season months. \n\n\fservices,  (ii)  increased  transport  costs  (in  time  and  money),  (iii)  constrained  agricultural \nproductivity,  and  (iv)  increased  exposure  to  both  waterborne  diseases  and  natural  disasters. \nAnalysis of this situation showed that the rural infrastructure problem was in turn, caused by (i) \na lack of investments in upgrading and maintaining the existing capital stock, (ii) poor levels of \ncoverage,  notably  missing  items  of  infrastructure,  especially  medium-scale  infrastructure,  and \n(iii) inadequate capacity  in planning and prioritizing investments. With the present emphasis on \ndecentralization,  there  remains  an  essential  need  to  enhance  inter-sector  coordination  and \nimprove  efficiency  of  existing  entities  responsible  for  managing  rural  infrastructure.  These \nentities include (i) state-owned irrigation management companies, (ii) rural irrigation water-user \nassociations, (iii) rural water supply water-user groups, (iv) market management boards, and (v) \nthe  provincial  departments  of  transport  and  road-user  associations  tasked  to  maintain  rural \nroads at commune and district level. \n\n \n\nits \n\nThe  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy 10  and \n\n9. \nlatest  socio-economic \ndevelopment plan (SEDP)11 both place considerable emphasis on the provision of infrastructure \nat the national level and, more directly, at the province, district, and commune levels through the \nbottom-up  planning  process  in  provincial  development  plans.  As  rural  infrastructure  is \nessentially  a  service  sector,  deficiencies  in  its  performance  compromise  investments  made  in \nthe  directly  productive  sectors  (such  as  agriculture  and  education).  The  ADB  country  strategy \nand  program  recognizes  this  priority  and  has  identified  limitations  in  physical  infrastructure  as \none  of  the  main  hindrances  to  accelerated,  private  sector-led  and  socially  inclusive  growth. \nWB\u2019s  recent  rural  development  review  (footnote  7),  moreover,  specifically  mentions  the  gap \nbetween national level and rural level infrastructure at the medium scale (i.e., at provincial and \ndistrict level). It notes that only 30% of provincial roads, for example, have all-weather surfaces, \nseverely  constraining  communications  in  rural  areas,  increasing  travel  times,  and  the  cost  of \ntransport  for  agricultural  enterprises.  A  review  of  the  rural  infrastructure  sector  is  provided  in \nAppendix 2 and Supplementary Appendix A. \n\n \nADB\u2019s past experience in rural infrastructure improvement has been generally favorable. \n10. \nSimilar ADB-funded projects undertaken in the past include the Irrigation and Flood Protection \nRehabilitation  Project,12 the  Red  River  Delta  Water  Resources  Sector  Project,13 and  the  RISP \n(footnote  2)  The  Forestry  Sector  Project 14  also  included  a  significant  component  of  rural \ninfrastructure.  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (MARD)  was  the  executing \nagency for all four projects. The RISP is the closest in design to the proposed Project, involving \nrural  infrastructure  of  several  kinds  (rural  roads,  irrigation,  village  water  supplies,  and  rural \nmarkets).  The  implementation  of  the  RISP  was  effectively  devolved  to  23  participating \nprovinces. Project completion reports (PCRs) for these projects assessed each as successful, \nall  achieving  a  wider  impact  than  originally  intended.  In  particular,  the  RISP  completed  the \nrehabilitation of 1,900 kilometers (km) of rural roads against an appraisal estimate of 1,500 km, \nwhile the irrigation area rehabilitated was 60,000 hectares (ha) against an appraisal estimate of \n20,000  ha.  Similar  projects  funded  by  other  donors  include  the  WB  first  and  second  Rural \nTransport Projects that were also assessed as successful. Appendix 3 lists significant external \nassistance  for  the  development  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  rural  areas  that  were  predominantly  project-\n\n                                                 \n\n10 Government of Viet Nam. 2003.

More recently, donor investment has adopted a program approach with direct budget \nsupport. 15  Previous  ADB-supported  medium  scale \ninvestments, \ncomplementary  to  Program  135  were  coordinated  through  provincial  SEDPs,  as  would  future \ninvestments of a similar scale under Program 135 phase II. \n\ninfrastructure \n\nrural \n\n11.  Major lessons learned from these previous investments include (i) that technical capacity \nexists  in  Viet  Nam  to  undertake  such  projects,  and  (ii)  that  with  adequate  coordination  and \nsupervision; implementation can be successfully devolved to provincial governments. A sector \napproach was also judged to be the most appropriate means of providing investment for a large \nnumber  of  subprojects  located  in  participating  provinces.  While  significant  efforts  have  been \nmade  in  previous  ADB-funded  infrastructure  projects  for  safeguard  compliance  issues  (with \nregard to resettlement and environment), government staff do not always have the expertise to \nadequately  deal  with  these  aspects.  Other  lessons  learned  from  a  recent  special  evaluation \nstudy (SES),16 highlight that investments in rural infrastructure must be contextually appropriate \nto sustainably lift people out of poverty. It also highlights that upgrading isolated roads did not \nlead  to  a  meaningful  impact  on  poverty  reduction  as  these  were  not  integrated  with  other \neconomic  opportunities.  In  the  case  of  irrigation  and  water  supply  subprojects,  the  SES \nquestioned,  among  other \ntechnical  and  economic  viability  of  small-scale \ninvestments,  and  also  noted  issues  in  operation  and  maintenance.  The  proposed  Project \ntherefore includes considerable support to ensure selection and design of strategically relevant \nsubprojects that have the capacity to genuinely tackle the most binding of economic and social \nconstraints  and  are  not  simply  standard  or  inappropriate  physical  designs.  Special  focus  is \nplaced on addressing O&M-related challenges.   \n\nissues, \n\nthe \n\n \nThe project design is based on (i) an identified demand for enhanced medium-scale rural \n12. \nand  coastal  infrastructure  to  further  reduce  the  high  poverty  levels  in  the  central  coastal \nprovinces,  (ii)  the  Government  and  ADB  strategies  of  providing  rural  infrastructure  for  this \npurpose,  (iii)   the  successful  design  and  implementation  experience  of  the  RISP  and  other \nrelated ADB-funded projects, and (iv) the need for future rural infrastructure projects to include \nstronger  measures  to  enhance  both  safeguard  compliance  and  contextual  relevance  in \nsubproject  identification  and  design.  Project  investments  will  be  complemented  by  a  strong \ncapacity-building and awareness-raising program for provincial level implementation staff. \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nThe  project  area  comprises  13  provinces  in  the  Central  Region,17 one  of  the  poorest \n13. \nregions of the country and, as such, identified by both ADB and the Government as a region of \nspecial  focus  for  development  investment.  The  most  densely  populated  areas  are  the  coastal \nzones  and  the  alluvial  plains.  The  uplands  tend  to  be  sparsely  populated  by  ethnic  minority \npeople.  While  the  upland  and  mountainous  areas  have  extremely  high  levels  of  poverty  (in \nsome cases over 60%), the greatest absolute numbers of poor people are found in the coastal \nzone and the alluvial plains where there are higher population densities. \n\n                                                 \n\n15 WB  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing  rural  infrastructure  Program  135-II  for  grassroots  rural  infrastructure \n\nalong with policy and institutional amendments. \n\n16 ADB\u2019s  Operations  Evaluation  Department.  2006.

The main activity is \n14. \nrice cultivation, supplemented in coastal zones by capture fisheries and aquaculture. However, \nsoils tend to be less fertile and sandier than in other parts of the country, while the climate tends \nto  be  drier, resulting  in a  high  demand  for  irrigation  water  to  achieve  full  agricultural  potential. \nMoreover, the region is also disaster prone, being subject to typhoons and consequent floods in \nthe  rainy  season  and  droughts  in  the  dry  season.  This  adds  to  the  precarious  economic \nsituation  of  the  population,  most  of  whom  live  below  or  just  above  the  poverty  line.  Rural \ninfrastructure  in  the  project  provinces  is  in  particularly  poor  condition.  Approximately  70%  of \nprovincial roads are unpaved and impassable during parts of the wet season, while many of the \nirrigation systems require rehabilitation and upgrading. As a result, access to agricultural inputs \n(including water for irrigation) and markets is limited, as is access to public services and clean \nwater supplies. \n\n \n15. \nFacing  these  constraints,  the  proposed  Project  has  been  designed  to  (i)  improve  rural \nlivelihoods  by  increasing  agriculture  productivity,  (ii)  widen  employment  opportunities,  (iii) \nimprove access to health and education, and (iv) reduce exposure to natural disasters. This will \nbe achieved through investments in locally identified, strategically important, medium-scale rural \ninfrastructure  priorities.  Collectively,  investments  made  under  the  Project  will  improve  the \nquality, extend the coverage, and better integrate rural infrastructure in the Central Region. The \nnet effect of this outcome will be to raise the efficiency of investments made in the productive \nsectors  and  to  increase  awareness  of  the  need  for  timely  maintenance  of  rural  infrastructure. \nThe types of rural infrastructure to be improved will include (i) rural roads; (ii) irrigation drainage \nand flood control schemes; (iii) rural markets; (iv) rural water supply schemes; and (v) special \ncoastal  works  such  as  sand  dune  stabilization,  salinity  intrusion  prevention,  and  mangrove \nrehabilitation.  The  proposed  Project  will  finance  locally  determined  priority  infrastructure \ninvestments  outlined  in  provincial  SEDPs.  Such  plans  are  prepared  on  a  5-year  basis  and \nreflect  provincial  rural  development  and  rural  infrastructure  priorities,  identified  on  the  basis  of \ncommunity generated requests from villages, communes, and districts. \n\n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n16. \nThe  Project  has  the  following  three  components:  (i)  rural  and  coastal  infrastructure \ndevelopment, further divided into (a) rural and coastal infrastructure subprojects, and (b) design \nsupport  studies  and  community  participation;  (ii)  capacity  building;  and  (iii)  central  project \nmanagement.  Under  the  rural  and  coastal  infrastructure  development  component,  the  Project \nwill  provide  funds  for  the  design  and  implementation  of  priority  rural  and  coastal  subprojects \nchosen from the provincial SEDPs. In order to ensure compliance with safeguard requirements \nof  the  Government  and  ADB,  support  will  be  provided  for  special  design  studies  relating  to \nresettlement,  ethnic  minorities  and  gender,  and  the  environment  for  all  subprojects.  The \ncomponent relating to capacity building provides resources to facilitate training and guidance for \nnational and provincial staff engaged in the Project. Under the project management component, \nfunds will be provided for the coordination and day-to-day management of the Project and the \nprovision of project implementation assistance and capacity-building consultants to assist in the \nimplementation  of  the  Project  and  training.  These  are  described  more  fully  in  Supplementary \nAppendix B. \n\n \n17. \nBeing  a  sector-style  project,  precise  outputs  of  the  proposed  Project  will  be  identified \nduring  the  implementation  period  from  provincial  priorities  following  public  consultations.  For \nproject  design  purposes,  a  series  of  parameters  was  developed  based  on  (i)  past  experience \nunder  the  RISP,  (ii)  provincial  priorities  so  far  identified,  (iii)  stakeholder  priorities  from  field \ninterviews, and (iv) the contents of the respective provincial SEDPs. On this basis, it has been \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fassumed that approximately 110 rural infrastructure subprojects, with an average cost of about \n$1.4  million,  will  be  funded  under  the  infrastructure  component.  About  50%  of  subproject \ninvestment is expected to be applied to rural roads, 30% for irrigation and the balance for water \nsupply  and  sanitation,  markets,  and  specific  coastal  infrastructure.  Given  the  prevailing  unit \ncosts  for  such  works,  the  envisaged  outputs  will  comprise  construction  and  upgrading  of  (i)  \napproximately  55  rural  roads  totaling  about  1,000  km,  (ii)  20  irrigation,  drainage,  and  flood \ncontrol subprojects impacting on an area of about 30,000 ha, and (iii) approximately 30 further \nrural and coastal infrastructure subprojects (including water supply schemes, rural markets, and \ncoastal  works  such  as  the  upgrading  of  special  infrastructure  for  salt  processing  and \naquaculture,  the  prevention  of  salinity  intrusion,  sand  dune  stabilization,  and  mangrove \nrehabilitation). Four sample subprojects of the type expected under the Project were analyzed \nduring  project  preparation;  each  was  found  to  be  economically  viable  with  a  large  number  of \nbeneficiaries (Supplementary Appendix C). \n\n \n18. \nThe  output  from  the  second  component  will  be  the  training  of  a  significant  number  of \ngovernment  personnel  in  project  design,  implementation,  and  construction  supervision. \nCapacities  of  national  and  provincial  individuals  associated  with  the  Project  will  also  be \nimproved  in  the  area  of  safeguards  (including  environment,  resettlement,  and  social  issues). \nActivities  to  be  undertaken  will  include  (i)  the  training  of  personnel  at  the  provincial  level, \nespecially  on  safeguard  matters,  but  also  in  project  planning,  implementation  supervision, \nmonitoring, and the financial aspects of project management; (ii) the selection of the subprojects \nin consultation with key stakeholders; (iii) the recruitment of design consultants; (iv) subproject \ndesign; (v) contractor recruitment; (vi) the provision of civil works; (vii) the technical aspects of \nO&M required for different road standards and other infrastructure design; (viii) implementation \nmonitoring;  and  (ix)  the  development  of  methods  to  ensure  provision  of  adequate  budget  and \ntraining for O&M of completed subprojects. \n\n \n19. \nOutputs  from  the  third  component  will  be  the  improved  capacities  of  provincial  agency \nstaff  to  manage  small-  to  medium-scale  infrastructure  investments  and  to  maintain  these \nfacilities in sound working condition. \n\n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n20. \nThe most significant special feature of the Project is the devolution of responsibility for \nimplementation  to  provincial  and  district  levels  in  keeping  with  the  Government\u2019s  policy  on \ndemocracy and devolution as expressed in Decree 79/CP on the Regulation of the Exercise of \nDemocracy  in  Communes  (1998)  (also  known  as  the  Grassroots  Democracy  Decree). \nParticipating  provincial  governments  will  be  responsible  for  their  respective  subprojects  and, \nduring implementation, responsibilities will be devolved (to the extent feasible and workable) to \ndistrict level. The extent of commitment and ownership by the provinces to these arrangements \nis  evident  from  the  fact  that  counterpart  funding  for  O&M  of  completed  subprojects  will  come \nwholly from the provincial government budgets and that the provinces are in full agreement with \nthese arrangements. \n\n \nThe attached advisory technical assistance (ADTA) will provide the opportunity to review \n21. \nthe  successes  and  failures  in  the  critical  issue  of  O&M  on  all  types  of  rural  infrastructure \nincluding the more public items such as rural roads, markets, and coastal structures, as well as \nthe more individual items (where the main beneficiaries assume greater responsibility for O&M) \nsuch as water supplies and irrigation rehabilitation. By taking a broad perspective gained from \nreviewing  other  infrastructure-related  projects  in  cooperation  with  other  donors,  there  will  be a \nunique  opportunity  to  influence  government  policy  on  O&M  issues.  This  should  lead  to  (i)  a \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fchange  in  attitude  of  those  allocating  budgets  to  improve  sustainability  of  infrastructure \ninvestment, and (ii) improved technical training in the principles of O&M requirements. \n\n \n22. \nIn  addition,  an  important  aspect  in  the  selection  of  the  subprojects  will  be  their  key \nstrategic  impact,  maximized  through  rigorous  local  contextual  selection  and  design  processes \n(Appendix 4). For example, rural roads will be selected for upgrading not only because they are \nin  poor  condition  but  also  because  they  open  up  areas  where  real  development  potential  and \nthe welfare of the productive poor are presently constrained by a lack of access to markets or \ninputs.  Similarly,  irrigation  subprojects  based  on  simple  and  straightforward  repairs  or \nimprovements will be chosen on the basis of their ability to raise crop production across a broad \narea  so  as  to  maximize  the  benefit  to  a  large  number  of  people  who  may  now  be  only  partly \ndependent  upon  agriculture  for  their  livelihoods.  Water  supply  subprojects  for  the  less \nproductive  poor  areas,  for  example,  will  be  chosen  based  on  the  estimated  cost  savings  in \nareas  where  potable  water  is  not  available  or  seasonal  drought  causes  severe  hardship  in \naddition to time and income losses. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n23. \nThe project investment cost is estimated at $168.2 million, including taxes and duties of \n$13.1  million.  A  project  investment  plan  is  shown  in  Table  1.  Summary  cost  estimates  are \npresented in Appendix 5 and detailed project costs in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem \n\n \nBase Costb \n\n1. \n2. \n3. \n\n \n\nRural and Coastal Infrastructure \nCapacity Building \nCentral Project Management \nSubtotal (A) \n\nContingenciesc \n\nAmountsa \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n156.00 \n  3.20 \n 4.08 \n163.28 \n\n 1.71 \n\n \n\nIn mid 2006 prices. \n\nFinancing Charges During Implementationd \n \n\nC. \n  \nTotal (A+B+C) \na    Includes taxes and duties of $13.1 million. \nb \nc   Physical  contingencies  computed  at  0%  for  civil  works  being  a  sector  type  project;  and  10%  for  training, \nimplementation, consulting services, and operational costs.

The loan will have a 32-year maturity \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  a  1%  interest  charge  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5% \nduring the amortization period. Loan joint cofinancing of the Project will be provided by Agence \nFran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) in the amount of \u20ac40 million ($52 million equivalent).  \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nAsian Development Bank \n\nSource \n\nAFD Loan \n\nAFD Grant \n\nProvincial Government \n\nCentral Government \n\n \n\nTotal \n\nTotal \n\n90.0 \n52.0 \n\n1.3 \n\n24.0 \n\n0.8 \n\n168.2 \n\n% \n53.5 \n\n30.9 \n\n0.8 \n\n14.3 \n\n0.4 \n\n100.0 \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, AFD = Agence Francais de D\u00e9veloppement. \nNote: Numbers may not sum precisely because of rounding. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n25. \nConditions  and  arrangements  for  AFD  cofinancing  will  be  through  a  bilateral  financing \nagreement  to  be  negotiated  between  the  Government  and  AFD.  AFD  will  also  provide \ncofinancing  on  a  grant  basis  in  the  amount  of  \u20ac1.0  million  ($1.3  million  equivalent).  A \ncofinancing agreement will be entered into by ADB and AFD under which the parties will jointly \nfinance the civil works and international consulting services. The proceeds of the loans will be \npassed  to  the  13  participating  provincial  governments  by  the  national Government  as  a grant. \nThe balance of the project cost ($24.8 million equivalent), amounting to 14.7%, will be funded \nby  the  Government  and  participating  provincial  governments.  Provincial  budgets  of  all \nparticipating  provinces  have  been  examined  and  it  has  been  concluded  that  all  have  the \ncapacity  to  provide  the  needed  counterpart  funding  (Supplementary  Appendix  E).  Land \nacquisition  under  resettlement  plans  will  not  be  financed  from  loan  funds  but  will  remain  the \nresponsibility of the provinces. The financing plan is shown in Table 2. \n\n \n26. \nTo facilitate project implementation, the Board is requested to approve the administration \nof  the  proposed  loan  in  an  amount  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  \u20ac40  million  ($52  million \nequivalent) and approve the grant in the amount not exceeding the equivalent of \u20ac1 million ($1.3 \nmillion equivalent), both from AFD, which are expected to be confirmed on or before the date of \nBoard approval. Approval from the cofinancier will be reported to the Board in accordance with \nthe  standard  reporting  procedures.  If  AFD  does  not  approve  the  loan  and  the  grant,  the  AFD \nportions  of  the  loan  and  grant  will  not  be  financed  under  the  Project.  Alternatively,  the \nGovernment  may  make  alternative  arrangements,  satisfactory  to  ADB,  to  cover  the  funding \nshortfall. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n27. \nThe executing agency (EA) for the Project will be MARD. The management structure is \nshown  in  an  organization  chart  in  Appendix  6.  MARD  has  implemented  a  number  of  ADB \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \nF. \n\n \n\n\fprojects including the RISP (the precursor of the proposed Project), and is the EA for a number \nof  ongoing  projects.  Almost  all  completed  projects  undertaken  by  MARD  have  been  rated  as \nsuccessful,  and  while  some  inefficiency  has  been  reported  with  ongoing  projects,  this  may  be \nattributed more to the complexities of design rather than any fundamental deficiency in MARD\u2019s \ncapacity. In keeping with the principles of decentralization and the devolution of responsibilities, \nidentification and approval of the subprojects will be through the provincial people\u2019s committees \n(PPCs) of the 13 participating provinces. Eight of these provinces participated in the RISP and \nhave  had  several  years  experience  in  the  implementation  of  rural infrastructure subprojects  of \nthe  type  proposed.  They  are  familiar  with  technical  aspects  of  subproject  implementation  and \nthe  financial  aspects  of  an  ADB-financed  loan.  The  other  five  provinces  also  have  experience \nwith projects funded by ADB and other multilateral agencies including WB and the International \nFund  for  Agricultural  Development.  To  ensure  their  full  capability  in  subproject  identification, \ndesign, implementation, and financial management, special capacity-building measures will be \nfocused on these provinces during the early stages of implementation. \n\n \n28. \nThe  CPMU  established  within  the  Agriculture  Project  Management  Board  (APMB)  of \nMARD will be responsible for overall project implementation at the national level. The CPMU will \nbe  managed  by  a  national  project  director  and  two  vice  directors  supported  by  appropriate \ntechnical, administrative, and accounting staff. \n\n \nAt  the  provincial  level,  day-to-day  management  will  be  the  responsibility  of  provincial \n29. \nproject  management  units  (PPMUs)  established  by  PPCs  of  participating  provinces  within  the \nprovincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD). Eight of these PPMUs will \nbe  the  same  as  those  established  and  operated  under  the  RISP,  while  five  will  be  newly \nestablished. As noted, the newly established PPMUs will be given support and training as well \nas  assistance  from  the  experienced  PPMUs  of  neighboring  provinces.  The  PPMUs  will  be \nmanaged by a director, and supported by a full-time coordinator appointed to ensure day-to-day \nsupervision  of  the  PPMU  and  to  coordinate  the  work  of  specific  technical  experts  involved  in \nsubproject identification, design, and implementation. PPMU staff will be seconded from DARDs \nas well as other departments as per the requirements. An important position of each PPMU will \nbe the safeguards officer appointed to ensure compliance with public consultation requirements, \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  and  mitigation,  and  social  impact  (including  resettlement) \nassessment and mitigation aspects of subproject implementation.  \n\n \n30. \nAt the district and commune levels, the Project will liaise closely with the existing local \nadministration.  The  PPMUs  shall  be  responsible  for  ensuring  coordination  of  day  to  day \nactivities at the district and commune level.  This will include organizing public consultations and \nmonitoring of the subproject design and implementation by the subproject beneficiaries.  \n\n \n31. \nTo  guide  project  implementation  at  the  provincial  level  and  to  ensure  interagency \ncoordination  as  required,  provincial  project  steering  committees  (PSCs)  will  be  established \nwithin participating provinces. The PSCs will be  chaired by the vice chairman of the PPC and \nwill  comprise  members  of  representatives  from  the  respective  PPC  departments  and  local \nagencies.  PSCs will meet regularly on a 6-monthly basis and intermittently as required. \n\n \n\n2. \n\nSubproject Preparation and Appraisal \n\n32. \nA two-step process has been selected for the identification and preparation of subproject \nproposals.  During  the  first  step,  subproject  proposals  will  be  selected  by  the  PPCs  from \npriorities  within  their  SEDPs.  Subprojects  chosen  should  be  strategic  and  straightforward \nengineering  projects  and  will  comprise  rural  roads,  irrigation  (including  drainage  and  flood \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ncontrol),  domestic  water  supply,  markets,  and  coastal  infrastructure,  with  an  estimated  cost \nbetween  $0.5  million  and  $4  million.  These  will  then  be  reviewed  through  a  process  of  public \nconsultation 18  with  potential  beneficiaries  and  other  stakeholders,  after  which  a  subproject \nidentification proposal (SIP) will be prepared by the PPMU. The PPMU will ensure that all of the \nrequired  initial  screening  selection  criteria  are  properly  addressed  and  reported.  These  will \ninclude the requirements for (i) public consultation, (ii) an initial environmental examination, (iii) \na  preliminary  social  assessment  including  resettlement  and  land  acquisition  impacts,  (iv) \npreliminary  cost  estimation,  (v)  a  preliminary  assessment  of  benefits,  and  (vi)  preliminary \nproposals for O&M. The first two SIPs of less than $2 million\u2014one from an RISP province and \nthe other from a non-RISP province\u2014shall be submitted to ADB for approval (on a no-objection \nbasis). SIPs for subprojects expected to cost more than $2 million will be submitted to ADB for \napproval on a no-objection basis. \n\n \n33. \nThe  second  step  in  the  subproject  identification  process  involves  the  preparation  of  a \nfeasibility  study  or  subproject  investment  report  (SIR).  SIRs  will  be  prepared  by  local \nconsultants  under  the  guidance  of  the  PPMU  to  ensure  that  subproject  eligibility  criteria  for \nimplementation  funding  will  be  met.  This  includes  ensuring  that  all  measures  are  taken  to \nmitigate possible social impacts including special measures for land acquisition, compensation, \nindigenous  people\u2019s  specific  actions  if  required,  and  special  measures  to  improve  the \nparticipation  of  women  and  other  disadvantaged  groups  as  beneficiaries.  Upon  completion  of \nthe SIR, the PPC will review the studies to ensure that they fully meet the eligibility criteria for \nimplementation  financing  and  any  other  internal  requirements  that  may  be  imposed  by  the \nprovince  or  the  national  Government.  Upon  approval  of  the  SIRs  (in  the  case  of  subprojects \ncosting  less  than  $2  million)  or  ADB  (in  the  case  of  subprojects  costing  more  than  $2  million) \nimplementation  activities.  The \nthe  commencement  of \nfunds  will  be  committed \nimplementation process is described in Appendix 7 and the selection criteria in Appendix 4.  \n\nfor \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n34. \nThe proposed Project will be implemented over a period of 6 years from 2008 to the end \nof  2013.  Since  subprojects  will  be  relatively  small  and  most  provinces  already  have  several \nyears  of  experience  in  implementing  similar  subprojects,  and  since  the  responsibility  for \nimplementation  will  be  spread  among  13  provinces,  preparation  work  on  most  subprojects  is \nexpected to begin within the first year. Bidding and construction work will then proceed during \nthe second year and will continue into the fourth year. The initial allocation to provinces will be \nbased on a fixed amount to meet PPMU overheads19 plus a proportional amount reflecting the \nrespective  size  of  the  rural  population  of  participating  provinces.  During  the  fourth  year,  a \nsecond phase of subprojects will then be taken up with funds not utilized during the first phase. \nThese are expected to be somewhat smaller in size and will be completed by the end of the fifth \nyear or the middle of the sixth year. The second allocation will be made using incentives based \non the implementation performance of the province and the proportional incremental increase in \nprovincial budget allocations for O&M. The final half year of the Project will be spent ensuring \nthat  O&M  arrangements  are  in  place  for  completed  subprojects.  Indicative  allocation  to \nprovinces is presented in Supplementary Appendix F. \n\n                                                 \n\n18 A consultation framework was agreed with the Government during the Appraisal Mission. \n19 A figure of $6.1 million equivalent per participating province was agreed at appraisal. \n\n\f4. \n\nProcurement \n\n35. \nA procurement capacity assessment of the EA has been conducted and is presented in \nSupplementary Appendix G. This included a review of the CPMU capacity and a review of the \ncapacity  of  two  participating  provincial  PPMUs.  A  procurement  plan  is  outlined  in  Appendix  8 \nwith  indicative  procurement  and  recruitment  contracts  that  were  based  on  the  capacity \nassessment. Pre- and post-review thresholds were discussed and agreed with the CPMU and \nare included in the plan. \n\n \n36. \nProcurement will mainly be undertaken by PPMUs. Goods and works financed by ADB \nand  AFD  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). Contracts for works valued at over $2  million equivalent shall be \nprocured through international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines.  Smaller  packages  for  works  valued  at  less  than  $2  million  or  equivalent  but  more \nthan  $100,000  or  equivalent,  shall  be  procured  using  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB) \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB  with  a  one-stage,  two-envelope  system.  For  works  below \n$100,000  equivalent,  shopping  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  may  be  used.  Contracts  for \ngoods  valued  at  over  $500,000  equivalent  shall  be  procured  through  ICB  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Goods  costing  less  than  $500,000  equivalent  but  more  than \n$100,000 shall be procured through NCB procedures using a one-stage, two-envelope system \nacceptable to ADB. Smaller packages for goods valued at less than $100,000 may be procured \nthrough shopping procedures acceptable to ADB. \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n37. \nThe Project will require three kinds of consulting services: (i) international and national \nconsulting  services  to  assist  the  CPMU  with  project  implementation,  monitoring,  and  training; \n(ii) national  consultants \nthe  preparation  of  environmental, \nthe  PPMUs  with \nresettlement, and social safeguards for SIPs and SIRs; and (iii) national engineering consultants \nto prepare detailed engineering designs and supervise construction of works.20 \n\nto  assist \n\n \n38. \nConsultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with the ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The CPMU will be responsible for \nrecruiting  the  project  implementation  and  training  consultants21 through  a  consulting  firm.  The \nCPMU  will  also  recruit  national  consultants  to  facilitate  community  participation  and  provide \nadvice  on  safeguards  to  provincial  governments  from  national  firms  using  the  consultants\u2019 \nqualification  selection  (CQS).  This  method  will  be  used  since  (i)  few  consultants  are  qualified, \n(ii) the quality of the firms\u2019 output will be critical to the assessment and mitigation of the Project\u2019s \nenvironmental and social impact; and (iii) recruitment time will be critical.  Individual consultants \nfor capacity building and facilitation are also expected to be recruited by the CPMU. \n\n \n39. \nThe PPMUs will be responsible for recruiting national consultants to provide design and \nsupervision services. These consultants will be recruited using CQS procedures acceptable to \nADB because (i) these consultants will be hired under small packages of $200,000 or less, (ii) \nrecruitment  time  is  critical,  and  (iii)  the  small  size  of  contracts  does  not  justify  the  cost  of  the \npreparation and evaluation of competitive proposals. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n\n20 Since  categories  (ii)  and  (iii)  will  be  recruited  as  needed  on  a  subproject-by-subproject  basis  as  part  of  the  sector \n\nloan package, it is not currently possible to quantify exactly the required number of person-months of expertise. \n\n21 To be partly funded by the AFD grant. \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\fThe  requirement  for  implementation  and  training  consulting  services  and  safeguard \n40. \nconsultants is shown in Appendix 9, and outline terms of reference presented in Supplementary \nAppendix H. To support implementation and capacity-building initiatives, the Project will fund a \ntotal  of  60  person-months  of  international  specialists  and  271  person-months  of  national \nspecialists  for  a  total  of  331  person-months.  Consulting  services  are  necessary  for  smooth \nimplementation of the Project and to incorporate increased emphasis on safeguards, community \nparticipation,  and  O&M  for  subprojects,  as  well  as  to  continue  the  capacity-building  initiated \nunder  the  RISP.  Consulting  services  will  not  only  support  the  CPMU  in  technical  areas  of \nengineering  design  and  construction,  but  will  also  be  instrumental  in  introducing  a  more \nconsultative  approach  during  subproject  identification  and  design  to  improve  sustainability. \nInternational expertise is to be provided in (i) project management, (ii) technical engineering, (iii) \ntraining  coordination,  (iv)  safeguard  requirements  of  ADB  and  the  Government,  (v)  O&M,  and \n(vi)  benefit  monitoring.  National  specialists  will  be  required  in  similar  areas  to  facilitate \ntechnology transfer of the training within PPMUs and other target beneficiaries and will include \ncommunity  participation  specialists,  indigenous  peoples,  and  gender  specialists,  together  with \nexperts in the economic assessment of subprojects. \n\n6. \n\nAdvance Action and Retroactive Financing \n\nThe  Government  requested \n\nthat  ADB  approve  advance  recruitment  action \n\n41. \nfor \nimplementation and training consultants. Advance action is necessary to ensure consultants are \navailable  to  support  the  early  stages  of  project  implementation.  Retroactive  financing \nwithdrawals  from  the  loan  account  may  be  made  for  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures \nincurred under the Project from the date of approval by the ADB Board of Directors to the date \nof  effectiveness  of  the  ADB  loan,  or  a  maximum  of  9  months  prior  to  the  date  of  signing  the \nLoan  Agreement,  whichever  is  later.  The  amount  of  retroactive  financing  will  be  subject  to  a \nmaximum  of  $2  million  equivalent  in  connection  with  the  following  items:  (i) recruitment  of \nimplementation and training consultants; and (ii) consulting services for project design, including \nenvironmental,  social  impact,  land  acquisition,  and  baseline  surveys.  The  Government  was \nadvised  that  ADB  approval  of  advance  contracting  action  and  retroactive  financing  will  not,  in \nany way, commit ADB to approve the proposed loan, and that ADB financing will be dependent \nupon compliance with all aspects of ADB procedural requirements, including compliance of the \nGovernment with relevant provisions of the loan and project agreements and ADB guidelines. \n\n7. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nThe  Government  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to \n42. \ndate)  and  the  Combating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  (2003)  policy. \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan and grant regulations and the \nbidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection \nwith  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the \nrecords and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n \n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n43. \nAfter  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  establish  two  first-generation  imprest \naccounts  (one  for  ADB  and  the  other  for  AFD)  in  a  commercial  bank  in  Hanoi  acceptable  to \nADB. These will be managed by the CPMU under the supervision of the central Treasury. The \nimprest  accounts  will  be  managed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  ADB  disbursement  procedures  will  be  followed  for \ndrawing  down  ADB  and  AFD  loan  funds  through  these  two  first-generation  imprest  accounts. \nThe advance to be deposited into each of the imprest accounts will be based on an estimated 6 \nmonths of project expenditure or a maximum of 10% of the respective loan amounts, whichever \nis the lower. Funds in these first-generation imprest accounts will be used to establish advances \nin  the  second-generation  imprest  accounts  in  participating  project  provinces.  These  will  be \ncontrolled by the PPMUs under the supervision of provincial treasuries. Since a large number of \nsmall payments are expected, most funds for the payment of civil works contracts will be drawn \nfrom  the  provincial  imprest  accounts,  and  these  accounts  will  be  reimbursed  using  the \nstatements of expenditure procedures against progress payments outlined in works construction \ncontracts.  Provincial  imprest  accounts  will  be  replenished  upon  presentation  of  documented \nliquidation of expenditures as outlined in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The CPMU will \nmanage two imprest accounts, one for ADB funds and the other for AFD; similarly, PPMUs will \nmanage two imprest accounts. Disbursement arrangements are presented diagrammatically in \nAppendix 10. \n \n44. \nPayments made directly from the CPMU and PPMUs will be supervised and authorized \nby the treasury at central and provincial levels upon receipt of payment documents. Based on \nthe  payments  authorized  by  provincial  treasuries,  each  PPMU  will  prepare  withdrawal \napplications  with  associated  payment  documents  or  statements  and  the  second-generation \nimprest account balance sheet (using the CPMU format) and submit them to the CPMU. Upon \nthe receipt of reimbursement applications and payment documents from PPMUs, the CPMU will \nprepare  an  aggregated  withdrawal  application  and  submit  it  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance  for \nendorsement.  Authorized  withdrawal  applications  will  be  forwarded  to  ADB  and  AFD  for \nreimbursement  to  the  respective  first-generation  imprest  accounts.  The  percentage  of  each \nclaim  for  reimbursement  will  be  paid  by  the  two  financiers  in  accordance  with  the  loan \nagreements between the Government, ADB, and AFD.  \n \n45. \nThe effectiveness and efficiency of the disbursement procedures will be assessed at the \nmidterm  review  and  actions  taken  to  simplify  or  streamline  the  processes  if  appropriate. \nStatement of expenditure procedures may be used to reimburse expenditures and liquidate the \nimprest accounts for all individual payments not exceeding $100,000. The imprest accounts will \nbe replenished on a monthly basis to ensure liquidity of funds or when the accounts are drawn \ndown to 20% of the initial deposit. The imprest accounts and statements of expenditure will be \naudited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB. \n\n \n\n9. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n46. \nEach  PPMU  and  the  CPMU  will  maintain  records  and  accounts  that  identify  the  goods \nand  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  financing  resources  received,  expenditures \nincurred for the Project, and use of local funds. The accounts will be established and maintained \nin  accordance  with  internationally  accepted  accounting  standards.  Annual  project  accounts  of \nPPMUs  and  the  CPMU  will  be  audited  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Audit  coverage  will \ninclude  a  special  audit  of  project  accounts,  including  separate  opinions  on  (i)  the  utilization  of \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\fthe  primary  and  secondary  imprest  accounts;  (ii)  the  statement  of  expenditures,  including \nwhether the amount claimed is duly supported and verified; (iii) whether the CPMU and PPMUs \nare  operating  the  imprest  accounts  in  accordance  with  ADB  procedures;  and  (iv)  compliance \nwith  financial  covenants  specified  in  the  loan  and  project  agreements.  The  audit  reports, \nmanagement  letter,  and  related  financial statements  will  be submitted  to  ADB  not  later  than  6 \nmonths after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate, or the project closing date if earlier. \nADB  informed  the  Government  of  its  policy  on  submission  of  audited  accounts,  which  covers \nfailure  of  submitting  audited  accounts  and  financial  statements  by  the  due  date.  A  formal \nwarning  will  be  issued  for  accounts  more  than  6  months  overdue,  and  disbursements  will  be \nsuspended for accounts that are 6 months overdue. \n \n47. \nEach  PPMU  will  provide  monthly  progress  reports  to  the  CPMU.  These  will  be \nconsolidated into quarterly reports and submitted to MARD, PSC, ADB, and AFD. These reports \nwill record (i) the progress made, (ii) problems encountered during the review period, (iii) steps \ntaken  or  proposed  to  remedy  the  problems,  (iv)  a  proposed  program  of  activities,  and  (v) \nprogress  expected  for  the  following  quarter.  The  CPMU  will  ensure  that  these  reports  are \nsubmitted to ADB in a timely manner. \n \n48.  Within 6 months of physical completion of the Project, the CPMU will submit to ADB  a \nPCR that describes (i) the physical progress of the Project, (ii) actual costs incurred in relation to \ncost  estimates,  (iii)  the  results  of  capacity-building  activities,  (iv)  the  outcome  of  safeguard \nefforts,  (v)  a  preliminary  assessment  of  achieved  benefits,  and  (vi)  other  relevant  project \nimplementation  matters  requested  by  ADB.  The  financial  management  assessment  of  the \nProject is presented in Supplementary Appendix M. \n\n10. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nProject  progress  and  performance  will  be  monitored  through  a  comprehensive  project \n49. \nperformance  monitoring  system  (PPMS).  Detailed  PPMS  parameters  and  procedures  will  be \ndeveloped during project implementation. Three different kinds of monitoring will be carried out \nincluding  (i)  implementation  progress  monitoring,  (ii)  safeguard  monitoring,  and  (iii)  benefit \nmonitoring and evaluation. Implementation progress monitoring will be one of the main tasks of \nthe CPMU. The monitoring unit within the CPMU will monitor the progress of activities in each \nprovince  based  on  monthly  PPMU  progress  reports.  Withdrawals,  disbursement,  and \nreimbursement  of  project  accounts  will  also  be  monitored  by  the  same  unit.  Safeguard \nmonitoring  with  associated  grievance  mechanisms  will  be  undertaken  to  ensure  that  the \nrequired  policies  and  procedures  and  plans  for  (i)  resettlement  including  land  acquisition  and \ncompensation,  (ii)  environmental  impact  assessment  and  mitigation,  and  (iii) indigenous \npeoples  specific  actions,  are  implemented  and  achieve  their  expected  outcomes  during \nsubproject preparation, implementation, and operation. In addition, an independent agency will \nbe  recruited  to  specifically  monitor  the  implementation  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nactivities to ensure full compliance with all laws, decrees, policies, and plans, and to review the \ngrievance  mechanism  for  affected  persons.  Project  benefit  monitoring  activities  will  entail \nperiodic  monitoring  of  the  benefits  and  impacts  of  a  representative  number  of  selected \nsubprojects.  This  will  be  undertaken  independently  by  a  university,  institute,  or  similar  agency \nwith experience in the identification and quantification of economic development benefits. \n\n \nTo assist in financial management and disbursement of loan funds and implementation \n50. \nprogress  of  infrastructure  development,  specialist  inputs  will  be  provided  under  the  consulting \nservices  contract.  In  addition,  participatory  monitoring  of  infrastructure  construction  will  be \n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fpromoted by the Project to achieve beneficiary commitment to future O&M. Furthermore, each \nSIR will contain a detailed procurement plan that will assist in achieving open and competitive \nbidding  for  design,  construction,  and  supervision  of  works  contracts  and  other  services  as \nrequired.  In  addition,  the  procurement  plan  requires  that  selection  of  the  main  implementation \nconsulting services contract shall be submitted to ADB for prior approval, as will subprojects that \ncost over $2 million.  \n \n\n11. \n\nProject Review \n\n51. \nApart  from  regular  reviews,  ADB,  AFD,  and  the  Government  will  undertake  a \ncomprehensive  review  within  18  months  of  loan  effectiveness  when  the  first  batch  of \nsubprojects will be in the construction stage. A midterm review will also be undertaken within 36 \nmonths  of  loan  effectiveness.  These  reviews  will  include  (i)  a  comprehensive  evaluation  of \nproject implementation arrangements, (ii) detailed evaluation of the scope and implementation \nprocess  and  progress  of  subprojects,  (iii)  feedback  from  the  PPMS,  (iv)  the  performance  of \nconsultants, (v) capacity-building progress, and (vi) the possible reallocation of loan proceeds. \nRemedial action will be instituted as required. \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n52. \nThe policy environment for rural infrastructure in Viet Nam has continued to evolve. With \nemphasis on decentralization, responsibility for allocating resources for O&M expenditures has  \nshifted to the provincial governments. Laws and decrees have been issued  that devolve to local \nadministrations responsibility for rural development and safeguard practices for matters such as \n(i) land acquisition and resettlement, (ii) environmental impact assessment and mitigation, and \n(iii)  community  participation  in  decision  making.  At  the  same  time,  ADB\u2019s  own  policy  and \nsafeguard requirements covering similar issues have also evolved. Financial management and \nprocurement  procedures  have  also  developed  considerably.  All  of  these  new  and  emerging \nresponsibilities will need to be adopted by provincial governments during subproject preparation \nand  implementation,  as  will  the  single  major  policy  issue  in  the  sector  -  that  of  the  need  for \nprovincial  governments  to  assign  sufficient  funding  for  O&M  of  completed  rural  infrastructure \nsubprojects. \n \n53. \nThrough  an  ADTA,  the  CPMU  and  PPMUs  will  (i)  be  provided  guidance  at  both  the \nnational and provincial levels for further analyzing policy developments and their application in \nanticipation  of  future  investments  in  the  sector,  and  (ii)  ensure  that  both  Viet  Nam  and  ADB \npolicies and procedures are understood and followed during project implementation. This will be \nimplemented prior to and during project start-up and during the first 2 years of implementation. \nThe main thrust of policy compliance will be a thorough analysis of a range of issues faced by \nprovincial governments for O&M funding. Support for policy compliance will ensure that project \nmanagement  is  established  on  a  sound  financial  and  procedural  basis  and  that  all  ADB  and \nGovernment  concerns  regarding  safeguards,  the  prevention  of  graft  and  corruption,  and \nprocurement and community involvement, are fully taken into account. The cost of the ADTA is \nestimated at $1.1 million of which $1.0 million will be funded on a grant basis and the balance \nby  the  Government.  Terms  of  reference  and  cost  estimates  for  this  grant  are  provided  in \nAppendix  11.  It  will  provide  54  person-months  of  consulting  services,  comprising  24  person-\nmonths of international and 30 person-months of national expertise. An international consulting \nfirm  will  provide  all  the  international  and  national  consulting  services.  The  consultants  will  be \nengaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The  QCBS \nmethod will be used and the short-listed firms will present simplified technical proposals. \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n54. \nRural road investments have been shown to produce a broad range of positive impacts, \nranging from immediate benefits such as reduced travel costs and times to less direct benefits \nsuch as (i) a diversification of sources of income, (ii) higher levels of agriculture production, (iii) \na greater diversity of agriculture crops, (iv) improved access to health and education services, \n(v)  reduced  costs  of  inputs  and  household  commodities,  and  (vi)  overall  reduced  levels  of \npoverty among communities served by the roads. This is confirmed by economic internal rate of \nreturn  (EIRR)  estimates  for  sample  rural  road  subprojects  of  12\u201319%  based  on  quantifiable \nbenefits  (Supplementary  Appendix  C).  One  additional  potential  subproject  evaluated  in  Nghe \nAhn, being robust to variations in commodity price levels as well as levels of utilization, showed \nan  EIRR  of  16%.  The  impact  on  poverty  reduction  is  illustrated  by  the  50%  increase  in  per \ncapita and household incomes from rehabilitated roads under the RISP. \n \n55. \nThe direct benefit of irrigation rehabilitation will be increased agriculture production and a \nshift  to  higher  value  crops.  The  sample  subproject  analyzed  shows  a  change  in  cropping \npatterns from a single rain-fed rice crop to irrigated sugar cane production, leading to an EIRR \nof 19.9%. The benefits from improved coastal infrastructure are broad and varied but include (i) \nincreased  crop  yields  and  safer  drinking  water  due  to  the  prevention  of  saline  intrusions,  (ii) \nincreased  aquaculture  and  salt  production,  (iii)  reduced  loss  of  farm  land  from  sand  dune \nencroachment,  and  (iv)  enhanced  fisheries  from  mangrove  rehabilitation.  The  benefits  from \nimproved  domestic  water  supplies  are  more  difficult  to  quantify,  but  include  reduced  rates  of \nwater-borne diseases and reduced time and labor (especially for women and children) used in \nfetching  water,  leading  to  additional  time  for  productive  economic  activities  or  education. \nImproved  capacity  building  in  the  prioritization  of  planning,  design,  implementation,  and \nmanagement of rural infrastructure should lead to more efficient resource allocation and further \nopportunities to increase long-term economic growth and short-term poverty reduction impact. \n \n56. \nThe  net  overall  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  include  (i)  increased  accessibility \nthroughout the rural areas of the Central Region, (ii) higher levels of agriculture and aquaculture \nproduction,  (iii)  lower  costs  of  agricultural  inputs  and  consumer  commodities,  (iv)  enhanced \naccess to markets and services, (v) responsive and decentralized investment planning, and (vi) \na  broader  range  of  economic  opportunities  both  within  and  beyond  the  agricultural  sector.  An \noverall economic assessment is presented in Appendix 12. \n \nB. \n\nSocial Benefits and Impacts \n\nA summary poverty reduction and social strategy (SPRSS) is presented in Appendix 13. \n57. \nAn analysis of the project benefits in the context of the SPRSS indicates that, as a consequence \nof the economic benefits described above, the more significant social impacts will be improved \nlivelihoods and reduced levels of poverty for the population of the project area as a whole, as \nwell as higher levels of education and improved public health. The provision of road access to \nethnic minorities living in isolated mountain areas  is likely to have a  positive impact, providing \nthem with an outlet for their produce and access to lower priced household commodities as well \nas  health  and  education  facilities. The  Project  is classified  category B  for  indigenous  peoples, \nand  an  ethnic  minority  development  framework  (Supplementary  Appendix  I)  has  been  agreed \nupon in accordance with the Government\u2019s applicable laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Policy on \nIndigenous  Peoples  (1998).  The  framework  will  help  extend  subproject  positive  impacts  to \n\n\fethnic  minority  groups  and  mitigate  any  negative  impacts.  The  impact  on  women  is  also \nexpected to be positive. Improved road access will open up new opportunities for women who \nlive  in  previously  isolated,  rural  communities.  Not  only  will  they  have  access  to  better \neducational  opportunities  and  health  services,  but  they  will  also  be  able  to  employ \nentrepreneurial skills in developing new income opportunities, particularly in association with the \nupgrading of markets. \n \n58.  Measures have been built into the design to deal with potential negative social impacts. \nTo address the issue of land acquisition and resettlement, a summary resettlement framework \n(Appendix  14)  sets  out  the  compensation  and  other  entitlements  for  any  unanticipated  land \nacquisition  or  resettlement  impacts  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  applicable  laws  and \nregulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995).  The  Project  is  classified  as \ncategory  B.  The  absence  of  significant  resettlement  impacts  is  one  of  the  eligibility  criteria  for \nsubproject feasibility study funding and category A subprojects will be screened out at the SIR \nstage.22 Short resettlement plans will be prepared for any subproject found to have resettlement \nimpacts  to  the  limit  of  category  B.  Compensation  (excluding  land  acquisition),  allowances, \noperation and administration costs, surveys, monitoring, and reporting will be financed from loan \nfunds  to  help  ensure  full  and  expeditious  implementation  of  resettlement  plans,  including \ncompensation  for  any  land  acquired.  Each  PPMU  will  also  appoint  a  safeguards  officer.  The \nProject  also  includes  such  measures  as  capacity  building  for  PPMU  and  CPMU  staff  in  social \nindependent  monitoring  of  compensation  and \nsafeguards,  and  arrangements \nresettlement  during  implementation.  A  representative  resettlement  plan  for  the  Hung  Trung  \u2013 \nNghi  Kieu  subproject  is  attached  as  Supplementary  Appendix  J.  A  resettlement  framework  is \npresented in Supplementary Appendix K. \n \nC. \n\nEnvironmental Impact \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\n59. \nAn  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  conducted  based  on  the  review  of \nselected  completed  subprojects  under  the  RISP  and  one  new  representative  subproject  to \nidentify  potential  impacts,  appropriate  mitigation  measures,  and  monitoring  mechanisms.  It \nconcluded  that  serious  negative  environmental  impact  was  unlikely  since  subprojects  will \nprimarily entail upgradation of small- and medium-scale infrastructure. In general, existing rights \nof  way  will be  used  so there  will  be  little  land  clearing,  and structures  are  generally  simple so \nthere will be minimal disturbance. Activities of primary concern during construction will be (i) the \nprovision  of  filling  material  from  borrow  sites  and  the  disposal  of  excavated  material,  (ii)  the \nimpacts  on  surface  and  ground-water  quality,  (iii)  changes  to  property  access,  and  (iv)  traffic \ndisruption.  For  coastal  infrastructure,  care  will  need  to  be  taken  to  avoid  damage  to  key \necological areas such as estuaries and mangroves. In order to ensure a minimum of negative \nenvironmental impacts, subprojects will follow environmental assessment procedures stipulated \nin  an  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  developed  to  ensure  (i)  exclusion  of \nsubprojects  that  would  cause  significant  adverse  impacts,  and  (ii)  compliance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s environmental regulations and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). A summary IEE \nand environmental assessment review framework are outlined in Supplementary Appendix L. \n \nD. \n\nFinancial Considerations \n\n60. \nSince  most  of  the  investments  under  the  Project  will  be  public  sector  investments,  the \nmain financial issues will concern the ability of the participating provinces to provide counterpart \nfunding  from  their  provincial  budgets  and  the  adequacy  of  O&M  funding.  While  counterpart \n\n                                                 \n\n22 Under the RISP, only two out of 183 subprojects funded had significant resettlement impacts. \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\fresources  are  likely  to  be  made  available  as  per  the  implementation  requirements,  provinces \nare  expected  to  face  difficulties  in  allocating  appropriate  resources  for  O&M  expenditures \n(Supplementary  Appendix  E).  Provincial  budgets  for  the  O&M  of  public  works  are  chronically \nunderfunded  and  there  is  a  likelihood  that  the same  situation  will  prevail  for  works  carried  out \nunder the Project. This is a systemic problem that cannot be resolved through one single project \nbut the Project itself can be used to raise policy issues relevant to O&M.  \n \nE. \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\nThe project design assumes that the participating provincial governments broadly have \n61. \nthe  capacity  and  technical  skills  to  identify,  plan,  design,  and  implement  medium-scale  rural \ninfrastructure rehabilitation and upgrading works but that they do not have sufficient budget to \nmeet the infrastructure rehabilitation and upgrading needs that they face.  \n \n62. \nImplementation of such a project at the provincial level does, however, face certain risks, \nincluding  the  following:  (i)  not  all  provincial  governments  are  adequately  skilled  at  identifying \nhigh-priority and strategic subproject investments; (ii) not all provincial government staff are fully \nfamiliar with environmental or social impact issues (other than land acquisition matters); (iii) not \nall  provincial,  district,  and  commune  staff  fully  understand  the  need  for  public  consultation \nbefore and during subproject identification, design, and implementation; and (iv) many provincial \ngovernments  do  not  place  due  emphasis  on  O&M  funding  for  completed  civil  works.  Through \nthe carefully formulated subproject investment eligibility criteria and the scale and scope of its \ncapacity-building  support,  the  project  design  has  incorporated  a  series  of  measures  to  ensure \nthat  (i)  project  staff  have  the  technical  capacity  to  properly  assess  subproject  proposals,  (ii) \nenvironmental and social safeguard issues are fully taken into account, (iii) the public in general \nand  beneficiaries  in  particular  are  fully  consulted  about  proposed  works,  and  (iv)  sufficient \nunderstanding  and  awareness  is  created  to  ensure  that  O&M  funds  are  made  available  after \nsubproject  completion \nin  rural \ninfrastructure.  The  capacity-building  initiatives  incorporated  into  the  design  represent  a \nsignificant  attempt  to  address  the  sector  policy  development  agenda.  In  view  of  the  specialist \nconsulting  services  support  under  the  associated  ADTA,  the  risk  associated  with  inadequate \nattention to O&M is therefore minimized. \n \nF. \n\nto  sustain  economic  benefits \n\nOverall Assessment \n\ninvestments  made \n\nfrom \n\n63. \nAn analysis of sample subprojects examined during project preparation has shown that \neconomic  returns  will  be  satisfactory  and  the  number  of  beneficiaries  substantial.  Moreover, \nthese  analyses  indicate  that  social  and  environmental  costs  will  be  minor  or  negligible.  In \naddition,  measures  have  been  built  into  the  Project  to  ensure  that  negative  social  and \nenvironmental  impacts  are  kept  to  a  minimum.  The  most  serious  risk  is  that  of  potential \ndeficiencies  in  O&M  funding.  To  the  extent  possible,  measures  have  been  taken  to  minimize \nthis  risk,  and  assurances  have  been  given  by  the  Government  that  structures  built  under  the \nProject  will  be  maintained  in  fully  operational  condition.  The  overwhelming  direct  and  indirect \nbenefits expected from the Project thus indicate that the Project\u2019s impact will far outweigh any \npossible social, environmental, or financial risks the Project might face. \n\n18 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nThe following project-specific assurances were confirmed by the Government in addition \n\n64. \nto the standard ADB assurances to ensure the smooth implementation of the Project. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  subprojects  to  be  financed  under  the  Project  will  have  been  screened  and \nselected in accordance with the criteria agreed between the Borrower and ADB, \nas outlined in Appendix 4. \nOnly  subprojects  where  the  impacts  from  resettlement  are  within  the  limits  of \nADB\u2019s resettlement category B rating will be permitted under the Project. MARD \nwill  ensure  that  civil  works  contractors  are  not  issued  a  notice  of  possession  of \nsite for construction work for any specific section of infrastructure unless, for that \nsection, MARD/PPMUs have, in accordance with the approved resettlement plan, \nprovided compensation payments and relocation to new sites (where relevant) as \nconfirmed by an independent monitoring agency. \nApproval  of  IEEs  by  the  relevant  local  agency  will  be  a  precondition  for  the \ncommencement of civil works for each subproject. \nTender  documents  for  civil  works  will  include  provisions  to  ensure  contractors\u2019 \npreferential hiring of local labor and guaranteeing equal opportunities for female \nworkers and equal pay for work of equal value in compliance with the labor laws \nand regulations of Viet Nam. It will also be ensured that the necessary measures \nare taken to prevent employment of child labor. \n\n(v)  Where  subprojects  link  with  tertiary  infrastructure  (either  existing  or  planned), \nmeasures will be taken to ensure that plans will be developed for the O&M of the \ntertiary infrastructure concurrently with subproject planning. \n\n(vi)  Measures  will  be  taken  to  ensure  that  subprojects  will  not  adversely  affect \nindigenous  people,  households  headed  by  women,  disabled,  elderly  or  other \nsimilarly  vulnerable  groups.

Gross \n1. \ndomestic product (GDP) grew at an average annual rate of just over 8% in 2005, underpinned \nby both strong domestic demand and exports. Despite this recent macroeconomic performance, \npoverty remains an issue. Analysis of the 2002 Multipurpose Household Survey data confirmed \na continuing decline in the incidence of poverty, from 58% in 1993 to 37% in 1998 and 29% in \n2002.  The  decline  in  recent  years  has  not  been  uniform  across  the  country.  Poverty  in  the \nMekong  Delta  area  showed  the  sharpest  drop  (from  37%  in  1998  to  23%  in  2002)  while  it \nremained  the  highest  in  the  Central  Highlands  (about  52%).  Poverty  is  closely  linked  to \nagricultural opportunities. \n\nInfrastructure, Agriculture, and Economic Growth \n\nUnderpinning  Viet  Nam\u2019s \n\nimpressive  economic  growth  has  been \n\nthe  national \n2. \ninfrastructure investment program focused on three levels: (i) national mainstream infrastructure  \nsuch as major roads and highways, along with power generation and the rehabilitation of major \nirrigation  schemes;  (ii)  small-scale,  grassroots  investments  at  the  village  and  commune  level, \noften with the assistance of bilateral donors and NGOs, but also through the Government\u2019s own \ninfrastructure  program  (Program  135);  and  (iii)  medium-scale  investments  linking  these  two \ntypes, such as the ADB funded Rural Infrastructure Sector Project (RISP) and the World Bank\u2019s \n(WB\u2019s) first and second Rural Transport Projects. In each year since 1997, total investment in \ninfrastructure  has  outpaced  GDP  growth  (averaging  about  10%  of  GDP  each  year,  and \nrepresenting about 45% of total investment over the period).1 \n\n3. \nAs  a  result  of  this  investment  in  infrastructure  (including  irrigation  and  rural  transport), \nthe  agricultural  sector  has  grown  at  about  4%  per  annum  since  1998. 2 Earlier,  the  sector \nresponded well to major policy changes (including land decollectivization) initiated by doi moi 3 \nin the late 1980s. Market forces (both domestic and external) now largely drive production and \ntrade  in  agriculture.  Domestic  markets  are  deepening  as  increasing  incomes  and  urbanization \nincrease consumer demand for a greater diversity and quality of higher value products across \ncrop,  livestock,  and  fishery  subsectors.  The  growing  market  orientation  is  also  linking  farmer \nproduction  choices  and  incentives  more  closely  with  world  price  signals  and  market \npreferences.  Transport  access  and  costs  are  fundamental  in  determining  input  and  crop \navailability  and  prices,  production  margins,  and  farm  incomes  that,  in  turn,  depend  upon  the \nstock  of  physical  rural  infrastructure  such  as  irrigation  facilities  and  the  quality  of  services  it \naffords.  This  is  confirmed  by  recent  analyses  of  the  determinants  of  agricultural  growth  that \nidentify the relative contribution of changes in agricultural inputs and of total factor productivity \nas the residual explanation for growth in the agricultural sector. Data from these studies show \nthat future growth will increasingly have to come from total factor productivity sources, including \nthrough gains in the efficiency of rural infrastructure. \n\nRural  transport  infrastructure  is  also  a  critical  contributor  to  the  general  development \n4. \nprocess of structural transformation of the economy. Despite the decline in relative importance \nof  the  agriculture  sector  within  the  economy,  agriculture  still  plays  a  very  important  role  in  the \n\n                                                 \n\n1  WB. 2006.

Washington, DC  \n3   The  reform  process  which  started  in  1986  is  known  as  Doi  Moi  or  the  politics  of  renovation,  is  geared  towards \n\ninstituting market-based reforms in the economy. \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\n \nB. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nlivelihoods of a majority of the country\u2019s population; 80% of people remain in rural areas and the \nsector still employs (fully or partly) around two thirds of the national labor force. However, this \ninvolvement  with  agricultural  activities \nincreasingly \ndisproportionately  female-oriented);  only  about  a  quarter  of  rural  households  are  exclusively \nengaged in farming, while the rest combine farming with waged and nonfarm employment. The \npicture  that emerges  from  recent  income  and  poverty  studies4 across  the  country  is  that  while \nmany  rural  households  are  diversifying  their  activities,  most  wish  to  retain  farming  as  a  major \nsource of income for at least some family members. This implies that for labor generally (and for \nindividual  family  members)  to  be  able  to  do  this,  reliable  and  cheap  rural  transport  is  as \nessential as the availability of income opportunities off-farm. \n\nincreasingly  part-time  (and  also \n\nis \n\n \nC. \n\nRural Infrastructure and Poverty in the Central Region \n\n5. \nThe  Central  Region  has  one  of  the  highest  incidences  of  poverty  in  the  country,  with \nover 37% of the national total. The underlying causes of this poverty are both geographical and \nhistorical. The topographic and climatic conditions are diverse and complicated, but in general \nthey  hinder  rather  than  favor  broad-based,  large-scale  agricultural  development.  Outside  of  a \nnarrow  alluvial  coastal  plain  the  land  is  sloping  and  the  soils  are  generally  unfertile.  This \ntogether  with  frequent  natural  disasters  (storms,  floods,  and  drought),  make  agricultural \nproduction  difficult  and  compound  other  environmental  problems  (including  soil  erosion,  land \ndegradation, and deforestation).5 \n\n6. \nTwo  essentially  historical  factors  also  contribute  to  the  nature  of  the  current \nsocioeconomic situation in the Central Region. The first is the extent of devastation inflicted on \nthe  physical  infrastructure  caused  during  the  wars  of  the  second  half  of  the  20th  century  (the \nDemilitarized  Zone  runs  right  across  the  Central  Region).  The  second  factor  is  the  relative \nunderinvestment  in  the  region\u2019s  physical  and  social  capital  in  recent  years,  as  the  national \npriorities  were  directed  to  promoting  development  in  the  two  most  populous,  and  promising, \nregions\u2014the Red River and Mekong deltas. The net effect of these factors has been to leave \nthe Central Region relatively underdeveloped, and this is reflected in the physical infrastructure \nstock (i.e., a high proportion of unsealed roads, the obvious need for canal linings, and required \nimprovements to the rural water supply and coastal infrastructure). \n\n7. \nExamination  of  the  rural  infrastructure  stock  in  the  provinces  of  the  Central  Region  in \nparticipating provinces confirms that (i) an imperative for further investment is justified, and (ii) \nthere is significant scope for improvement. The proportion of sealed district roads ranges from \nas  low  as  2%  to  a  maximum  of  48%,  over  400,000  hectares  (ha)  of  irrigation  facilities  are  in \nneed of rehabilitation, some 25,000 kilometers (km) of primary and secondary irrigation canals \nare  in  need  of  lining,  and  over  a  third  of  the  rural  population  do  not  yet  have  clean  water \nsupplies.  Also,  while  the  documented  benefits  from  the  RISP  were  considerable  (substantial \ndecreases in poverty, and household income gains of up to 40%), the coverage of that project in \nterms  of  its  aggregate  impact  on  all  rural  infrastructure  in  the  Central  Region  was  modest, \ntypically  renovating  only  6\u201315%  of  the  district  roads  in  each  of  its  provinces  and  5\u201325%  of \nirrigated areas (Supplementary Appendix A). \n\n8. \nThe causal nature of the relationship between the rural infrastructure stock and peoples\u2019 \nlivelihoods (especially including the ways in which poverty is impacted) was examined through \n\n                                                 \n\n4  Klump, Rainer, and Thomas Bonschab. 2004.

What  was  apparent  is  that  both  addressing  rural \npoverty  and  promoting  economic  growth  requires  investment  across  a  range  of  rural \ninfrastructure (roads, irrigation and water supplies, and coastal works) because income sources, \nsocial  and  welfare  activities,  and  population  locations  differ  throughout  the  region,  requiring \ndifferent interventions. The primary need in relation to rural roads, irrigation, drainage, and flood \ncontrol works in the Central Region is to rehabilitate (and slightly expand) existing networks and \nsystems, while in rural water supply and sanitation the main need is to construct new systems in \nplaces presently without safe drinking water. Similarly, investment in coastal works may involve \nrehabilitating  existing  dikes  and  fish  landings,  but  might  also  include  new  environmental \nactivities such as sand dune stabilization and mangrove planting. \n\n9. \nSubprojects  must  be  contextually  appropriate  so  they  will  sustainably  lift  people  out  of \npoverty.  Irrigation  rehabilitation  and  water  supply  establishment  are  expected  to  address  the \nneeds  of  the  poorer  communities.  Rural  road  improvements  can  be  expected  to  benefit  the \nmore productive commercial activities and the relatively poor in the surrounding population, as \nthey  make  use  of  increased  employment  and  marketing  opportunities,  and  also  the  absolute \npoorest  in  terms  of  reductions  in  cost  of  access  to  health,  education,  and  social  facilities.6 By \nproviding rural infrastructure improvements to various groups (especially indigenous peoples) in \nthe  participating  provinces,  the  underlying  dynamic  economic  growth  model  is  inclusive  in \nnature. Whilst physical investment will predominate in such an undertaking due to the relatively \nhigh  cost,  the  analysis  revealed  that  underlying  issues  of  finance,  planning,  community \nparticipation,  and  capacity  building  must  also  be  addressed  if  the  core  problem  is  to  be \neffectively  addressed.  These  two  factors  together  provide  the  logic  in  delivering  the  desired \nproject impact of improved livelihoods. \n\n \nD. \n\nGovernment Plans and Priorities \n\n10. \nThe  Government  remains  committed  to  maintaining  high  levels  of  national  economic \ngrowth  and  to  achieving  structural  transformation  of  the  economy,  as  it  does  to  reducing \npoverty.  The  planning  and  policy  agenda  for  the  sector  as  a  whole  is  moving  in  the  right \ndirection  (in  terms  of  issues  such  as  financing  and  cost  recovery),  and  is  already  being \npromoted under Program 135 and the Third Rural Transport Project. Such trends are in need of \nsupport  rather  than  wholesale  reform  as  such,  hence  the  suitability  of  a  sector  modality  as \nopposed to a policy-based program loan with budget support. \n\n \n11. \nThe  Government  recognizes  the  role  of  infrastructure  in  national  development  and \npoverty reduction planning in both the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy, \nand the current 5-year socio-economic development plan (SEDP).7 The SEDP identifies a clear \nrole  for  rural  transport,  water  supply,  and  other  infrastructure  as  supporting  various  sector \nobjectives  (e.g.,  \u201cthe  State  budget  will  be  focused  only  on  critical  areas  such  as  irrigation, \ntransport, and clean water supply to intensify investment in agriculture and rural development\u201d \n[footnote  6]).  In  planning  for  the  northern-central  and  central-coastal  areas  in  particular,  the \nSEDP also talks of raising GDP per capita to $700\u2013800 by 2010, partly through \u201ccomprehensive \ninfrastructure  development\u201d  (footnote  6)  including  (i)  road-building  to  provide  all-weather  links \nbetween  the  eastern  and  western  areas  of  this region  (from  areas  of  agriculture  production  to \ncoastal  towns  and  seaports)  and  from  highland  areas  to  Cambodia  and  the  Lao  PDR;  (ii)  the \nupgrading  of  large  irrigation  works  and  the  linking  of  irrigation  and  flood  protection  schemes, \n\n                                                 \n\n6 Improving transport facilities is of course only part of the solution to improving access to health, education, and social \nservices; however, without such investments the benefits of increased spending on new facilities such as hospitals, \nschools, and colleges in rural areas will be compromised. \n\n7   Government of Viet Nam. 2006.

Limitations in physical infrastructure are identified as one of \nthe  main  hindrances  to  accelerated  private  sector-led  growth,  as  well  as  to  socially  inclusive \ngrowth. ADB\u2019s past experience in the rural infrastructure sector in Viet Nam has been generally \nfavorable.  Similar  ADB-funded  projects  in  the  past  have  included  the  Irrigation  and  Flood \nProtection Rehabilitation Project,9 the Red River Delta Water Resources Sector Project ,10 and \nthe  RISP.  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Regional  Development  (MARD)  was  the  executing \nagency  for  all  three  projects.  ADB  is  planning  further  investment  of  a  similar  nature  in  the \nnorthern  mountains  and  hills  regions,  for  which  a  project  preparatory  technical  assistance \n(PPTA) is included in the country strategy and program. \n\n \nF. \n\nThe Role and Priorities of Other Donors \n\nFollowing the RISP in the late 1990s, other donors have since funded rural infrastructure \n13. \nprojects. These donors include, among others, Department for International Development, WB, \nAustralian  Agency  for  International  Development,  Finnish  Department  for  Development \nCooperation,  and  Swedish \nInternational  Development  Cooperation  Agency.  About  10 \ncommune-level  rural  development  projects  are  currently  being  implemented  in  the  Central \nRegion,  leading  to  a  situation  in  which  a  large  amount  of  tertiary  infrastructure  has  been \nconstructed  without  the  supporting  medium-  or  secondary-level  infrastructure  to  link  it  to  the \nmain  national  networks. 11  WB  and  ADB  have  also  included  significant  rural  infrastructure \nprovision as part of other projects such as the ADB funded Forestry Sector Project, the Central \nRegion  Livelihood  Improvement  Project  and  the  WB-funded  Agriculture  Diversification  Project. \nWB\u2019s  main  thrust  in  rural  infrastructure  to  date  has  been  through  two  commune-targeted \nprojects  (the  Northern  Areas  Poverty  Reduction  Project  and  the  Community-Based  Rural \nInfrastructure  Project)  and  three  provincial  level  rural  transport  projects  (the  first,  second,  and \nthird Rural Transport Projects). \n\n \n14. \nThe focus within the sector on project or sector lending is in transition as some donors \nwill soon be joining WB for an ambitious program approach to rural infrastructure development \nbuilding on the Government\u2019s Program 135. WB will provide direct budget support ($700 million) \nfor grassroots-level rural infrastructure provision along with policy and institutional adjustments \nto ensure that funds will be properly spent and adequately monitored. \n\n15.  Most prior ADB investments in rural infrastructure focused on secondary level, medium-\nscale infrastructure. This will be the case with the proposed Project and also the future project \nplanned for the northern mountains. ADB investments are therefore seen as complementary to \n\n                                                 \n\n8 ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update Viet Nam 2006\u20132008.

To improve the overall impact of project interventions, potential links with other \ndevelopment  initiatives  will  result  in  such  subprojects  receiving  higher  priority  during  selection \nand  prioritization  of  subprojects  for  funding.  These  subprojects  may  include  strategically \nimportant  investments  (such  as  provincial  roads  linking  several  district-level  roads  to  a  main \nhighway,  or  the  lining  of  key  sections  of  irrigation  canals  to  prevent  water  loss  through \nseepage),  where  higher  benefits  can  be  obtained  than  from  new  infrastructure.  In  situations \nwhere  such  links  cannot  be  substantiated,  yet  the  social  benefits  are  substantial  (as  might  be \nanticipated in the more remote and less populated areas), the lack of obvious links should not \nprevent  the  subproject  from  being  implemented.  The  adoption  of  an  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn (EIRR) figure of 10% for accepting subprojects reflects the fact that some benefits (such \nas  social  benefits)  are  not  readily  quantifiable  and  the  use  of  the  EIRR  level  of  10%  should \nensure  that  subprojects  in  less  viable  areas  are  not  disadvantaged  through  the  selection \nprocess.  \n\nScreening at Subproject Investment Proposal Stage \n\nThe following screening criteria are to be applied at the SIP stage. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nThe  subproject  must  be  included  in  the  provincial  socioeconomic  development \nplan  and  will  be  expected  to  have  significant  impact  on  poverty  reduction, \neconomic growth, and livelihood improvement. \nPriority will be accorded to those subprojects that can demonstrate obvious links \nwith other development initiatives to further enhance the overall impact, or where \nthey improve access to other public services and economic opportunities. \nThe  subproject  cost is estimated  at  greater  than  $0.5  million  but  less  than  $4.0 \nmillion. This cost range is specified to ensure that the number of beneficiaries is \nmaximized, that development is not concentrated in a small area of the province \nbut  is  more  widely  spread,  and  that  the  provincial  project  management  units \n(PPMUs)  do  not  have  too  many  separate  contracts  to  administer.  If  deemed  of \nhigh  priority,  a  number  of  smaller  subprojects  in  one  sector  could  be  combined \ninto one subproject. \nComprehensive  public  consultations  have  been  undertaken  and  documented  in \nSIPs within all affected or participating communes. \nThe subproject has no significant resettlement impact, no significant impact upon \nvulnerable  people,  particularly  ethnic  minority  groups  (Supplementary  Appendix \nK), no obvious negative environmental impact, and is likely to have an EIRR of \ngreater than 10%. \nThe  subproject  proposal  outlines \nfundable  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  arrangements  with  implementing  organizations  identified \nand sources of funds clearly identified. \nThe subproject is a coherent scheme in an identified subsector(s) with provision \nfor  links  with  additional  livelihood-enhancement  activities  or  other  donor  or \n\nfeasible  and \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\n2. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n31 \n\ngovernment  programs  or  projects,  and  is  supported  by  existing  tertiary \ninfrastructure, or will include such tertiary works as appropriate. \n\nScreening at Subproject Investment Report Stage \n\nThe following screening criteria are to be applied at the SIR stage. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nThe  subproject  is  shown  to  be  technically  feasible  and  expected  benefits  have \nbeen  clearly  identified.  In  addition,  the  subproject  is  shown  to  have  an  EIRR  of \nreturn in excess of 10% although this should not exclude those subprojects with \nmore significant social and poverty impacts. \nThe  selected  subproject  will  be  cost  effective  as  measured  by  the  unit  cost  per \nbeneficiary, with  priority  being  given  to  those  with  the  least cost  per  beneficiary \nwhile providing the greatest benefit in terms of the estimated EIRR. \nProcurement  packages  have  been  clearly  identified,  as  have  the  method  of \nprocurement;  cost  estimates  have  been  clearly  identified  and  recorded  and  all \nsources of funding have been identified, agreed, and confirmed. \nThe SIR contains a detailed financing plan for O&M. This requires that an O&M \nentity shall be specified and both a budget amount and corresponding source of \nfunding  specified  and  agreed  upon  by  the  provincial  people\u2019s  committee  and \nother  concerned  parties  to  ensure  that  the  overall  project  investments  will  be \nfinancially viable and sustainable. \nPublic  consultation  on  the  subproject  proposal  has  been  held  in  concerned \ncommunes  and  measures  for  future  public  consultation  at  all  stages  of \nimplementation are clearly defined. \nThe  subproject  is  shown  to  have  no  major  negative  environmental  or  social \nimpacts and mitigation measures have been defined for minor impacts. \nThe subproject is shown to have no significant resettlement impacts and, where \nneeded,  a  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the \nresettlement  framework  and  the  relevant  regulations  of  the  Government  of  Viet \nNam and ADB policy. \n\n \n\n \nB.   \n\n3. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \n \nTable A5.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \n \n\nItem \n\nA. \n\nInvestment Costsa \n\n1.

With  the  devolution  of  responsibility  for  maintenance  to  the \nprovinces  where  there  are  limited  revenue-raising  opportunities,  resources  are  scarce  and \navailable funds are channeled into establishing new infrastructure at the expense of maintaining \nexisting  structures.  The  Government  is  now  in  a  position  to  reassess  its  policies  in  respect  of \nrural  infrastructure  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M).  More  recently,  there  has  been  a \ntendency to overdesign (using higher cost structures), acknowledging that there will be limited \nfunds  available  for  maintenance  in  the  future.  There  is  an  urgent  need  to  change  attitudes  to \ninfrastructure  maintenance  and,  consequently,  the  budgetary  allocations  from  national  and \nprovincial  budgets  for  these  purposes.  New  policies  need  to  be  developed  in  respect  of \ninfrastructure  maintenance  and  there  are  many  projects  that  have  addressed  this  issue  from \ndifferent  perspectives.  The  proposed  advisory  technical  assistance  (ADTA)  will  provide  the \nresources to engage necessary technical expertise to review these options to recommend to the \nGovernment  the  most  appropriate  means  of  addressing  this  critical  issue.  The  ADTA  will  also \nprovide supplementary capacity building in the various technical areas covered by the proposed \nProject, and provide technical specialists to develop appropriate training material while providing \nthe resources for local institutions for delivery of the training material. \n\nIn  addition,  there  has  recently  been  greater  emphasis  by  the  Government  and  donors \n2. \nalike  on  the  inclusion  of  safeguard  measures  (environment,  resettlement,  and  social  issues) \nwhen undertaking infrastructure development. This was attempted under the recently completed \nRural  Infrastructure  Sector  Project  (RISP)  but  met  with  mixed  success  as  provincial  staff  in \nparticipating provincial project management units (PPMUs) did not understand the incremental \nbenefits  to  be  gained  from  attending  to  safeguard  matters  (increasing  ownership-making \ninvestments  are  more  sustainable  and  designs  more  appropriate).  The  ADTA  will  (i)  provide \nresources  to  engage  a  project  start-up  specialist  who  is  familiar  with  safeguard  matters,  (ii) \nensure  that  current  laws  and  decrees  devolve  the  responsibility  for  rural  development  to  local \nadministrations,  and  (iii)  assign  responsibilities  to  local  administrations  for  safeguard  practices \nfor  such  matters  as  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  environmental  impact  assessment  and \nmitigation,  and  community  participation  in  decision  making.  Similarly,  ADB\u2019s  policies  and \nsafeguard  requirements  have  become  more  rigorous,  as  have  their  requirements  for  financial \nmanagement  and  procurement.

It  will  \u201csystematize  the  present  ad  hoc  approach  to  sector  development  through \nemphasis\u2026on  considerations  in  the  development  of  the  sector\u201d,5 an  ADB  requirement  for  a \nsector  loan.  A  more  detailed  analysis  of  four  representative  subprojects  (to  confirm  they  are \neconomically  viable  and  that  they  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction)  is  presented  in \nSupplementary Appendix C. Further material on the sector and planning contexts for the rural \ninfrastructure sector is contained in Appendix 2. \n \nA. \n\nRationale for Government Involvement \n\n2. \nThe  Government\u2019s  Five-Year  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  (SEDP)  (2006\u20132010) \nhas  three  main  outcomes  targeted  for  the  5-year  period:  (i)  growth,  to  boost  the  economic \ngrowth  rate,  quickly  but  sustainably  bringing  the  country  out  of  the  low  development  state  (to \nreach  per  capita  income  of  $950\u20131,000  by  2010);  (ii)  social  development,  to  significantly \nimprove  people\u2019s  material,  cultural,  and  spiritual  life;  and  (iii)  good  governance,  to  create \ninstitutional  and  infrastructure  foundations  to  boost  the  industrialization  and  modernization \nprocess and gradual transformation into a knowledge-based economy. To achieve its economic \ngrowth objective, the Government proposes to (i) liberalize markets, (ii) develop infrastructure, \n(iii) promote science and technology, (iv) improve factor productivity, (v) improve the quality of \nresource allocation and use, and (vi) proactively accelerate international economic integration to \npromote  exports  and  foreign  investment.  To  achieve  and  maintain  its  high  gross  domestic \nproduct (GDP) annual growth rate of 7.5%, Viet Nam needs to develop physical infrastructure \nand maintain investment levels of at least 35% of GDP. \n \n3. \nThe other rationale for Government involvement is that because rural infrastructure is a \npublic  good,  infrastructure  investments  tend  to  require  large  capital  resources,  and  this \nprecludes  private  investment.  In  addition,  the  means  for  recovering  rents  or  user  charges  are \nnot  well  developed  in  Viet  Nam  (although  tollways  are  effective  on  national  routes).  With  the \npossible exception of irrigation facilities and water supplies, benefits are distributed over a large \nand  unidentifiable  number  of  users,  reinforcing  the  public  nature  of  the  investment.  Rural \ninfrastructure  is  essentially  a  public  good;  the  responsibility  rests  with  the  Government  to \nprovide an appropriate environment to facilitate private investment. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n\n1 ADB Economics Research Division. 2005.Technical Note No.14: Economic Analysis of a Sector Loan.

Manila (29 October). \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nB. \n\nGoals of the Plan \n\n4. \nThe  main  elements  of  the  Government\u2019s  rural  infrastructure  strategy  include  (i)  an \nemphasis on rural roads, particularly a complete grid of all-weather roads in the supply areas for \nthe major urban centers and a focus on much simpler linkages in remote areas; (ii) a decision to \ndesign and implement as much rural infrastructure development as practicable at provincial and \nlower  levels  with  beneficiary  or  user  participation;  (iii)  capacity  development  with  regard  to \ntraining  and  equipment  so  as  to  allow  provinces  to  plan  effectively  without  waste  and  to \nsupervise  construction;  (iv)  preparation  and  monitoring  of  standards  for  new  works  and \nmaintenance;  (v) priorities  established  for  major  national  water  projects  within  an  overall  plan; \n(vi) a system to determine priorities for national funding contributions to provincial infrastructure \nplans;  and  (vii) effective  cost-recovery  systems  and  practical,  funded  management  and \nmaintenance  programs  in  place.  In  the  SEDP  plans  for  the  Northern  Central  and  Central \nCoastal regions, targets include raising per capita GDP to $700\u2013800 by 2010. For the Central \nHighlands  region,  the  rural  infrastructure  focus  is  more  on  small-  to  medium-scale  irrigation \nworks,  development  of  rural  markets  to  support  commodity-based  border  and  domestic  trade, \nand the development of side roads, feeder roads, and border roads from the National Highway \n1A.  The  various  ways  in  which  the  provision  of  rural  infrastructure  supports  economic  growth \nand poverty reduction in a range of situations are outlined in Appendix 2. \n \n\nGovernment Plans \n\nC. \n\n5. \n  \n\nD. \n\nAssociated Economic Policies \n\nDetails of Government plans and priorities are given in Section D of Appendix 2. \n\n6. \nTwo recent policy initiatives that are likely to impact upon the rural infrastructure sector \n(other  than  the  sector  development  policy  itself)  are  (i)  the  policy  on  decentralization  and \ngrassroots  identification  of  priority  public  investments,  and  (ii)  the  policy  for  maintaining  rural \ninfrastructure.  The  Government  has  given  significant  importance  to  the  commune-identified \ninvestments  and  has  provided  funding  to  resource  the  implementation  of  these  investments \n(e.g., Program 135, funded from Government resources) and other bilaterally and multilaterally \nfunded  initiatives.  Infrastructure  items  identified  through  these  tend  to  be  smaller-scale  public \ninvestments of immediate relevance to the concerned communities. They tend not to have the \nbroader  economic  development  rationale  or  any  appreciation  of  the  larger-scale  development \nissues. This has created an opportunity for coordination with these smaller-scale investments to \nincrease  their  impact.  Linking  a  number  of  village  or  commune  roads  with  district  road \nrehabilitation has the potential for a far greater impact than the road alignment in its own right. \n \nThe second policy is related to the resources of provinces and their financial capacity to \n7. \nmaintain rehabilitated structures. The Government is clear in its desire to recover operation and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  costs  from  the  immediate  beneficiaries  using  rural  infrastructure.  Local \nauthorities have been charged with responsibility for setting user charges to recover O&M costs. \nFor  the  larger  items  with  broad-based  benefits,  contracts  are  provided  to  state-owned \nenterprises  to  operate  and  maintain  state  assets.  The  pricing  policy  of  local  administrations, \nhowever, does not provide for full cost recovery and in many cases recovered user-charges are \ninsufficient  to  meet  immediate  O&M  needs,  particularly  in  the  case  of  rural  water  supply  and \nsanitation. Local authorities consider that they must retain responsibility for maintaining services \nto the public at subsidized prices. The subsidy that would allow comprehensive maintenance is \nnot  provided  from  provincial  budgetary  allocations;  inevitably,  assets  deteriorate.  The  policy  is \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12     47 \n\n \n\n \n\nbased  on  social  considerations  and  is  highly  political  given  the  limited  capacity  of  some \nhouseholds to afford tariffs set to achieve full cost recovery. With the limited resources available \nin the districts and provinces to subsidize user charges, combined with a lack of appreciation of \nthe  need  for  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  (or  at  least  the  benefits  thereof),  rural \ninfrastructure  is  seldom  maintained  in  sound  working  order.  The  various  dimensions  of  this \nplanning and financing problem, and the nature of the resulting impacts upon rural livelihoods, \nare  explained  in  more  detail  in  Appendix  2.  The  Project  has  addressed  this  issue  by  capacity \nbuilding  for  O&M  requirements  and  by  providing  higher  initial  capital  costs  for  structures \n(increasing design standards). However, the policy of allowing local authorities to set user fees \nat subsidized rates will impact upon the sustainability of the investments under the Project. \n\nE. \n\nGovernment and Local Consultant Capacity \n\n8. \nThe  Government  has  demonstrated  a  capacity  to  implement  an  ADB-funded  sector \nmodality  project  (the  RISP)  between  1998  and  2005  (footnote  2). In  addition,  the  Government \nhas  recently  completed  the  first  and  second  Rural  Transport  Projects  implemented  by  the \nnational Government (i.e., centralized) project management unit. These projects have generally \nbeen  regarded  as  satisfactory  in  terms  of  implementation  efficiency  and  overall  development \nimpact;  over  6,800  kilometers  (km)  of  basic  access  roads  were  rehabilitated,  and  the  projects \nhelped to improve capacity to plan and implement work at the national level, and contributed to \nthe  emergence  of  private-sector  contractors  in  the  country.  The  ADB-funded  RISP  was \nimplemented through provincial project management units where there was significant capacity \nbuilding  in  the  identification,  design,  works  supervision,  and  in  general  project  management. \nWhile it was assessed that more capacity building was needed6 in the areas of safeguards and \neconomic  evaluation,  the  project  was  rated  as  successful,  demonstrating  that  capacity  to \nimplement  a  sector  modality  project  has  been  established.  However,  the  project  completion \nreport recommended (i) that further devolution should not be attempted too hastily, (ii) that there \nbe a period of consolidation, and (iii) the refinement of local consultant capabilities in the social \naspects of identification and design. Similarly, the capacities of the local consultants to prepare \ntechnically  sound  and  appropriate  detailed  designs  and  to  supervise  works  construction  have \nbeen demonstrated. \n\n \nF. \n\nFiscal Impacts \n\n9. \nMost of the rural infrastructure being rehabilitated or established under the Project will be \nof  sufficient  size  that  it  is  unlikely  that  communities  will  assume  responsibility  for  its \nmaintenance. Wherever possible, the Government is committed to charging user fees to provide \nfor,  or  at  least  contribute  towards,  O&M  requirements.  Where  is  it  possible  to  identify  and \ncharge  local  beneficiaries  for  contributions  to  O&M  (as  is  the  case  in  rural  water  supply  and \nsanitation,  markets,  and  irrigation  subprojects),  the  immediate  beneficiaries  will  be  able  to \ncontribute to routine maintenance. For roads, the funding of routine maintenance will inevitably \nbecome the responsibility of the provinces, as will periodic maintenance requirements of other \ninfrastructure. This places a significant demand on provincial and district resources to maintain \nrehabilitated  infrastructure  along  with  their  increased  capital  stock  of  infrastructure.  While  the \nrevenue-raising  capacity  of  the  predominantly  rural  provinces  is  limited,  the  issue  of \nsustainability  is  very  much  dependent  upon  central  Government  allocations.  Sustainability  is \npartly an issue of financial management but is more one of limited resources. \n \n\n                                                 \n\n6 ADB. 2006. Project Completion Report on the Rural Infrastructure Sector Project in Viet Nam. Hanoi. \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nA review of the financial position of the 13 target provinces shows significant growth in \n10. \nthe level of financial activity, sources of funding, and the allocation of these funds to both capital \nand  recurrent  expenditure.  In  the  period  ended  December  2004,  annual  budget  receipts  per \ncapita  (from  all  sources)  in  the  target  provinces  varied  between  D0.6  million  and D2.9  million, \nwith  Binh  Dinh  the  lowest  and  Kon Tum  the  highest  (the latter  due  to  large  transfers  from  the \ncentral  Government).  Annual  per  capita  expenditure  ranged  between  D0.8  million  and  D2.4 \nmillion  with  most  budgets  being  balanced  (made  possible  by  transfers  from  the  central \nGovernment). Provinces maintain their focus on funding capital investments that accounted for, \non  average,  28%  of  provincial  expenditure.  Provincial  allocations  for  routine  and  periodic \nmaintenance  of  infrastructure  have  been  estimated  to  be  approximately  40%  of  actual \nrequirements.  The  heavy  dependence  on  the  central  Government  for  budget  resources \naverages 61% for target provinces, but ranged from 42% in the case of Thua Thien-Hue to 81% \nin Kon Tum. \n \n11. \nThe  Project  and  associated  ADTA  have  designed  the  capacity  building  to  raise  the \nawareness  of  provincial  decision  makers  to  achieve  increased  allocations  for  routine  and \nperiodic maintenance allocations from provincial budgets, but this continues to be a challenge \nfacing  the  resource-poor  provinces.  Furthermore,  as  their  respective  economies  develop, \ngreater allocations will be needed for recurrent expenditure rather than maintaining the focus on \ninvestment  and  capital  infrastructure  as  was  needed  in  the  period  following  the  cessation  of \nconflict to rehabilitate the dilapidated infrastructure. \n \n12. \nADB  funds  are  not  fully  fungible  as  the  three  financing  sources\u2014ADB,  AFD,  and  the \nGovernment\u2014have  already  been  specified  in  the  design  for  the  identified  subprojects.  The \nallocation of counterpart funds proved to be a major concern during the implementation of the \nRISP as 20% funding was sought from the provinces. \n\n \nG. \n\nEconomic Risks \n\n13. \nThe  major  economic  risk  to  the  successful  outcome  of  the  Project  is  the  need  for \nperiodic and routine maintenance to sustain benefits. The economic analysis in Supplementary \nAppendix C draws attention to the sensitivity of the economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) for \nthe  representative  subprojects  to  maintenance  for  road  subprojects  in  particular.  If  the  benefit \nstream stops 5 years after rehabilitation, the estimated EIRR becomes negative; if it stops after \n10 years, the EIRR falls below the cost of capital. Specifically, the sensitivity analysis of the Phu \nQuy  \u2013  Phuoc  Hau,  Phuoc  Thai  \u2013  Lien  Son,  and  Tan  Tai  \u2013  Xom  Lang  roads  suggests  that  if \nmaintenance  stops  after  5  years  the  EIRRs  will  be  about  \u20134.3%,  while  if  maintenance  stops \nafter  10  years  the  EIRR  will  only  be  5.9%.  For  the  Hung  Trung  \u2013  Nghi  Kieu  subproject \n(comprising  roads,  irrigation  rehabilitation,  and  rural  markets)  the  situation  is  similar,  with  the \nEIRR being \u20135.5% if maintenance stops after 5 years and 10.1% if it stops after 10 years. \n \n14. \nThe  importance  of  attending  to  maintenance  of  rehabilitated  structures  cannot  be \noverstated  as  it  has  such  a  dramatic  impact  upon  the  benefits  achieved.  While  the  identified \neconomic  risk  is  part  policy-related  in  that  tariffs  do  not  reflect  the  real  operational  cost  of \nrehabilitated infrastructure, the risk is equally a function of the limited availability of resources to \nmaintain structures. The subproject identification process will go part of the way to ensuring that \nresources are allocated to the rehabilitated infrastructure, but there is a period of time between \nthe commitment to a maintenance program and the commitment of budgetary resources during \nwhich such undertakings could be forgotten. It is therefore important to formalize commitments \nfor maintenance by the provinces and, wherever possible, set minimum financing amounts for \nspecific items of infrastructure. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12     49 \n\n \n\n \nH. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nGovernment Commitment \n\n15. \nThe commitment of both the central and provincial governments was strong during the \nprevious  ADB-funded  sector  loan,  and  has  been  evident  again  during  the  preparation  of  the \nProject.  The  provinces  see  considerable  merit  in  the  outcomes  of  the  Project  as  it  has  been \ndeveloped  in  a  participatory  manner  with  numerous  workshops  and  individual  consultations. \nGovernment commitment is clear, in that it financed 31% of the total project cost, compared with \nthe 20% estimated at appraisal for the RISP. Whilst this was provided to ensure that adequate \nstandards  of  design  were  achieved  given  the  unit  cost  limitations  in  the  RISP  project \ndocuments, it substantiates Government commitment to the sector and its development plan. \n\nI. \n\nCoordination of Foreign Aid \n\n16. \nThere  are  a  number  of  international  agencies  and  bilateral  donors  working  in  the  rural \nand  coastal  infrastructure  sector  (Appendix  3)  as  well  as  a  number  of  state-funded  initiatives \n(such  as  the  Program  135  phase  II).  Clearly  there  is  a  need  to  coordinate  with  these \ndevelopment  initiatives  at  the  provincial  level.  To  achieve  this  coordination,  responsibility  for \nimplementing  has  been  assigned  to  the  provincial  people\u2019s  committees  (PPCs).  Provincial \nsteering committees have been proposed to ensure that subprojects will be consistent with the \nprovincial  SEDPs.  Furthermore,  as  PPCs  will  have  a  major  role  in  approving  identified \nsubprojects, and as the selection and prioritization process will be administered by the provincial \nproject management units, it suggests that donor coordination will be effectively handled. \n\nJ. \n\nConditions Attached to the Loan \n\n17.  Most  conditions  for  the  proposed  Project  relate  to  subproject  identification  and  have \nbeen incorporated in the selection criteria. While policy reform may be appropriate in the case of \nthe rural water supply and sanitation sector, the Project is intended to have some impact upon \npolicy  development  within  this  sector  in  respect  of  the  practices  for  O&M  that  forms  the  main \ncondition  of  the  proposed  loan.  This  also  constitutes  the  main  risk  under  the  Project  that  will \nimpact  on  maximizing  benefits  from  the  investment.  Time-bound  and  quantified  provincial \nbudgetary allocations that can be monitored after completion should be established during the \nselection process. \n\nK. \n\nEconomic Analysis of Representative Subprojects \n\n18. \nGiven the sector modality of the proposed Project, four representative subprojects were \nanalyzed to determine their suitability for funding. In view of the similarity between the proposed \nProject  and  its  predecessor  (the  RISP),  three  completed  subprojects  were  reanalyzed  using \n2006  costs  (indexed  from  actual  costs);  they  were  assessed  against  demonstrated  benefits  in \ncurrent 2006 terms. In addition to the three completed subprojects, a new potential subproject7 \nwas  evaluated  using  similar  approaches  to  the  completed  subprojects  under  the  RISP.  Each \nsubproject demonstrated EIRRs in excess of 12%, ranging from 12.2% to 19.9% based on the \nidentified net benefit flows. In each case, there were additional benefits from the investment that \ncould  not  readily  be  quantified,  and  estimates  were  considered  to  be  conservative.  Sensitivity \ntests  were  carried  out  to  the  main  potential  variables  that  might  impact  upon  the  findings, \nincluding  price  declines,  increases  on  capital  costs,  and  also  a  reduction  in  utilization.  The \n\n                                                 \n\n7 Hung Trung Nieu Tru road rehabilitation and associated irrigation rehabilitation and market structures. \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nsensitivity  to  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  was  also  analyzed  with  utilization  declining  to \nprerehabilitation  levels  after  the  maintenance  ceased.  In  most  cases,  the  benefits  were  not \nsensitive  to  changes  in  price  levels  or  to  increases  in  the  unit  investment  costs.  The  area  of \ngreatest  sensitivity  was  identified  from  maintenance  practices.  Where  the  maintenance  was \nceased after 5 years of operation, the EIRRs fell dramatically below the cost of capital. In cases \nwhere  the  maintenance  ceased  after  10  years  from  completion,  the  EIRRs  were  significantly \nreduced  (but  not  to  below  zero)  as  most  of  the  benefits  would  have  been  received  before  the \ndeterioration  of  the  infrastructure.  This  result  is  more  an  impact  of  the  method  of  estimating \nEIRRs,  as  the  more  substantial  benefits  are  those  occurring  immediately  after  the  initial \ninvestment. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f   \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n51 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nA. \n \n \nIs the sector identified as a national \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \nagreement? \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam: \n \nViet  Nam  has  already  achieved  the  first  Millennium  Development  Goals  of  halving  poverty  by  2015  as  the  national \npoverty  rate  fell  from  about  58.1%  in  1993  to  24.1%  in  2004.  Despite  the  success,  regional  inequalities  remain: \npoverty, particularly extreme poverty, remains heavily concentrated in isolated rural areas and among ethnic minority \ngroups. Over 90% of the poor (73% of the whole population) are found in rural areas. The need for social equity and \nbalanced  development  to  sustain  the  country\u2019s  economic  growth  is  well  recognized  in  the  Government\u2019s \nComprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy  (CPRGS)  and  its  latest  Five  Year  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment  Plan,  2006\u20132010,  and  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)  (2007\u20132010).  Key  focuses  of  the \nCPRGS are the development of a diversified rural economy, inclusive social development, and addressing the needs \nof  the  relatively  impoverished  Central  Region.  Both  plans  place  considerable  emphasis  on  the  provision  of \ninfrastructure,  both  at  the  national  level  and  more  directly  at  the  provincial,  district,  and  commune  levels.  The  CSP \nrecognizes  this  priority  and  has  identified  limitations  in  physical  infrastructure  as  one  of  the  main  bottlenecks  to \naccelerated, private sector-led growth, as well as to socially inclusive growth. \n \nThe Project will contribute to achieve balanced and equitable growth in the 13 provinces in the Central Region. It will \nfund a series of subprojects aimed at rehabilitating and upgrading medium-scale rural and coastal infrastructure such \nas intercommune roads, irrigation facilities, water supply and sanitation, markets, and special coastal zone works. It \nis  expected  that  approximately  50%  of  the  subprojects  will  be  roads  to  improve  access  to  markets,  employment \nopportunities,  health  centers,  and  schools  by  reducing  isolation  and  remoteness  of  rural  communes.  It  is  also \nexpected  that  another  30%  of  the  subprojects  will  be  irrigation  schemes  that  will  increase  the  productivity  of \nagriculture. Improving access to safe water supplies will reduce health and hygiene problems particularly among the \npoor  women  and  children  quite  apart  from  the  time  saved  from  water  collection,  a  task  performed  by  women  and \nchildren.  Likewise,  markets  will  promote  livelihood  diversification  by  encouraging  trade  and  enable  information \nexchange. \n \nB. \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe Project is not a direct poverty intervention because all people will have access to, and benefit from, the various \nsubprojects.  However,  the  Project  will  greatly  benefit  poor  communities  as  subprojects  will  be  located  in \ngeographically poor provinces, where the average rural poverty rate in 13 target provinces is 52%, a figure exceeding \nthe national average of 26.4%. \n \nParticipating provinces are characterized by a long, narrow coastal zone up to about 10 km wide along the coast in \nthe east. This zone borders a flat, productive coastal plain that in turn is flanked by a series of mountains and hills to \nthe  west.  The  most  densely  populated  areas  in  the  provinces  are  the  coastal  zones  and  alluvial  plains.  The \nmountains  and  hills  tend  to  be  sparsely  populated  by  ethnic  minority  tribal  people.  While  the  greatest  absolute \nnumbers of poor are in the coastal zone and the alluvial plain (due the much higher population density), the hill and \nmountain  areas  have  extremely  high  levels  of  poverty.  Households  in  mountainous  communes  are  substantially \npoorer,  with  56%  falling  into  the  poor  income  group,  compared  with  22%  of  households  in  coastal  communes  and \n42% of households in plains communes. \n \nAll  the  provinces  are  predominantly  rural  and  agricultural.  The  main  economic  activity  is  rice  cultivation,  and  this  is \nsupplemented in the coastal zones by capture fisheries and aquaculture. Moreover, the region is also disaster prone, \nbeing subject to typhoons and consequent floods in the rainy season and droughts in the dry season. This adds to \nthe precarious economic situation of the population, most of which lives below or just above the poverty line. Rural \ninfrastructure  in  the  project  provinces  is  in  generally  poor  condition.  Approximately  70%  of  provincial  roads  are \nunpaved and are impassable during the  wet season, while many of the irrigation systems require rehabilitation and \nupgrading. As a result, access to irrigated land and markets is constrained, as are access to services such as health \nand  education.  A  poverty  and  social  assessment  (PSA)  was  undertaken  during  project  preparation  covering  six \nprovinces and six districts in each province with two districts selected in each of the three agro-environmental zones - \ncoastal, plains, and mountainous. According to the PSA, upgrading of roads and bridges to all-weather surfaces and \nimproving  access  to  safe  water  supplies  are  the  highest-ranked  infrastructure  development  priorities  of  most \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nsurveyed households, irrespective of gender or ethnicity. Despite the recognition of the need to improve water supply \nand  sanitation,  survey  respondents  are  more  willing  to  pay  for  improvements  to  infrastructure  such  as  roads, \nirrigation,  and  markets.  The  PSA  also  revealed  that  there  are  differences  between  ethnic  minority  households  and \nKinh households with regard to access to infrastructure and services. Only 18% of ethnic minority households live in \nvillages with a health centre (compared with 26% of Kinh households), 5% with a market (compared with 22% of Kinh \nhouseholds), and 15% with a lower-secondary school (20% of Kinh households). Subproject locations are yet to be \ndetermined.  \n\n   No \n\n  Yes \n\nParticipation Process \n\nC. \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nA  stakeholder  analysis  was  conducted  during  project  preparation  to  identify  key  project  stakeholders,  their  project-\nrelated  interests,  and  their  potential  roles  in  project  implementation.  Project  field  surveys  were  also  conducted  and \napproximately 400 potential beneficiaries per province were included. In addition, a number of province and national \nlevel workshops were held during implementation of the preparation study. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nA participation  strategy has been  integrated into the project design and  social safeguard documents to ensure that \ndifferent  stakeholders  continue  to  participate  during  implementation.  Screening  criteria  for  subproject  investment \nproposals include that the public consultations have been undertaken on the subproject proposals within all affected \nor  participating  communes  and  feedback  from  consultations  have  been  included  in  the  proposal.  The  Project  will \nmobilize community participation specialists in order to ensure that stakeholders, particularly beneficiaries, participate \nin sharing information about the Project, determine the location and design of subprojects, and supervise construction \nand  benefit  monitoring.  The  various  safeguard  processes  (resettlement,  ethnic  minority  development,  and \nenvironment)  also  include  consultation  and  participation  of  the  community  as  a  key  step  in  identification  of  impacts \nand mitigation measures. \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No \n\nGender Development \n\nD. \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nViet Nam has a long tradition of promoting gender equality, having one of the highest economic participation rates of \nwomen in the world (83%). The PSA concluded that women will be beneficiaries of the Project as around half of all \nworkers  in  the  agriculture  sector  are  women,  and  compared  with  men,  women  contribute  more  hours  of  labor  to \ncultivation,  agricultural  processing,  and  marketing  of  agricultural  produce.  In  particular,  market  improvements  will \nprimarily benefit women, as over 90% of traders are women. Improvements in water supply may also ease women\u2019s \nphysical burden. \n\nThe results from the PSA indicate that there is almost no difference between female-head and male-head households \nacross  the  project  area  in  terms  of  poverty  level,  with  female-head  households  being  slightly  better  off  than  male-\nhead  households.  With  regard  to  participation  of  women  in  community  infrastructure  planning  and  implementation, \nacross  the  project  area  there  is  a  relatively  high  participation  of  women  in  the  decision-making  process.  Decisions \nabout  the  types  and  actual  location  of  new  infrastructure  had  consistent  participation  of  women.  Nonetheless, \nsubproject  planning  and  implementation  will  ensure  women,  including  female  household  heads,  are  provided  equal \nopportunity  to  participate  in  and  benefit  from  the  Project.  Gender  will  be  an  integral  part  of  resettlement  plans  and \nenvironmental assessments. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n\n  Yes   \n\n  No \n\n \n\nSocial Safeguards and Other Social Risks \n\n \n\nE. \nItem \n\nSignificant/Not \nSignificant/None \n\nResettlement \n\n Significant \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAffordability \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\nThe Project will upgrade mainly existing infrastructure.

Negative  impacts  from \nthe  Project  are  considered  small  and  are  likely  to  be  confined  to  (i)  permanent  loss  of  small \nareas  of  land  adjacent  to  the  works,  (ii)  minor  damage  to  structures,  crops,  and  trees,  (iii) \ntemporary  loss  or  disruption  of  the  use  of  land  or  other  assets  caused  by  construction  works; \nand (iv) the movement of construction plant and materials to and from work sites. Few, if any, \npeople will be severely affected by land acquisition. In accordance with the Asian Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), the Project is classified category B. Full \nresettlement  plans  (as  required  for  category  A  projects)  will  not  be  required  because  any \nsubproject  with  significant  resettlement  impact  will  not  be  eligible  for  funding 1 .  Short \nresettlement  plans  will  be  prepared  for  any  subprojects  found  to  have  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement impacts up to the limits for category B. \n\n \n\n \n\nB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Entitlements \n\nThe resettlement framework is prepared based on laws, regulations, and policies of the \n2. \nGovernment of Viet Nam and ADB policies and guidelines. It was endorsed by the Government \nand  guides  the  preparation  of  resettlement  plans  (should  any  be  needed)  during  project \nimplementation. The provisions and principles adopted in this framework and subsequent plans \nwill supersede the provisions of the relevant decrees currently in force in Viet Nam wherever a \ngap exists, as provided for under Decree 131/2006/ND-CP  (November 2006), which regulates \nthe management and use of official development assistance. \n\nThe project entitlement matrix (Table A15.1) summarizes the main types of losses and \n3. \nthe corresponding nature and scope of entitlement. The extent of impact on vulnerable groups \nincluding ethnic minority groups and other disadvantaged groups\u2014such as the landless, poor, \nhouseholds  headed  by  women,  elderly,  and  disabled\u2014who  should  receive  special  economic \nrehabilitation  programs  will  be  determined  during  preparation  of  subproject  investment  reports \n(SIR) and resettlement plans. If the ethnic minority population exceeds 20% of all the affected \npersons,  special  economic  rehabilitation  programs  specifically  targeted  to  ethnic  minority \naffected persons will be prepared in consultation with the ethnic minority affected persons. The \ndetails  are  found  in  the  separate  Ethnic  Minority  Development  Framework  (Supplementary \nAppendix I). \n \n\nC. \n\nInstitutional Framework \n\n4. \nThe Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), through the Central Project \nManagement  Unit  (CPMU)  of  its  Agricultural  Projects  Management  Board,  will  assure  overall \nplanning, coordination, and reporting for the Project. In each of the 13 participating provinces, \nthe  respective  Departments  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (DARD),  through  their \nprovincial  project  management  units  (PPMUs),  will  prepare  and  implement  subprojects.  A \nsafeguard  officer  will  be  appointed  in  each  PPMU.  The  CPMU  and  PPMU  will  liaise  with  the \nprovincial people\u2019s committee (PPC), and the PPC will request the district people\u2019s committee \n\n                                                 \n\n1   As per ADB policy, \u2018significant\u2019 resettlement means that 200 or more people (or approximately 40 households based \non an average size of household) will experience being physically displaced or lose $10 or more of their productive \nassets (income-generating). \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14     55 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(DPC) in districts where a subproject is located to establish a Compensation, Assistance, and \nResettlement Board (CARB). The CARB will lead the resettlement process for each subproject, \nincluding  preparation  and  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan.  The  Committee  for  Ethnic \nMinorities and Mountainous Areas and the Fatherland Front have mandates for ethnic minority \nissues,  and  these  agencies  will  be  included  in  the  special  rehabilitation  program  for  ethnic \nminority population wherever possible. \n\nD. \n\nScreening, Preparation, and Implementation of Resettlement Plans \n\n5. \nBased on information given in subproject identification proposals (SIPs), the CPMU will \ndetermine  the  requirements  for  resettlement  plans  using  screening  and  categorization  forms. \nDuring the initial screening of SIPs, subprojects likely to have significant resettlement impact will \nbe rejected for ADB funding. \n\n6. \nA  short  resettlement  plan  will  then  be  prepared  for  each  subproject  investment  report \n(SIR) where resettlement impacts are unavoidable. The preparation of a subproject resettlement \nplan will use the following procedure. \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nthe  subproject, \n\nUndertake a census of all affected persons. \nUndertake  an  inventory  and  detailed  measurement  survey2 of  all  losses  of  all \naffected  persons.  At  the  same  time,  inform  potential  affected  persons  (without \ndiscrimination)  of \nimpacts,  and  principles  and \nlikely \nits \nentitlements as per the resettlement framework. \nUndertake a socioeconomic survey3 of at least 10% of all affected persons, 20% \nof severely affected persons and ethnic minority population. \nUndertake  a  replacement  cost  survey  for  various  types  of  affected  assets  as  a \nbasis  for  determining  compensation  rates  at  replacement  cost.  Determine  the \nlosses in accordance with the entitlement matrix. \nProvide project and resettlement information to all persons affected in a form and \nlanguage  understandable  to  them,  and  consult  them  on  compensation  and \nresettlement options, including relocation sites and economic rehabilitation. \nIn  consultation  with  those  people  affected,  prepare  a  special  rehabilitation \nprogram for affected ethnic minority population when their number exceeds 20% \nof all the affected persons. \nPrepare  the  draft  resettlement  plans  with  time-bound  implementation  schedule, \nprocedures  for  grievance  mechanism,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  a \nbudget. \n\n(viii)  Finalize the subproject resettlement plan in both Vietnamese and English. Submit \nplan  to  the  CPMU  for  preliminary  review,  then  CPMU  will  forward  it  to  ADB  for \napproval. \nDisclose  the  draft  and  final  resettlement  plan  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Public \nCommunications  Policy  (2005)  to  the  affected  communities  and  on  ADB\u2019s \nwebsite. The draft resettlement plan will be disclosed prior to submission to ADB \nfor approval. The final resettlement plan will be disclosed after approval. \n\n(ix) \n\n                                                 \n\n2   Data will be disaggregated by gender and ethnicity. \n3   The socioeconomic survey will include gender analysis and data will be disaggregated by gender and ethnicity. \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nLand  acquisition,  compensation,  and  relocation  of  affected  persons  cannot  commence \n7. \nuntil the resettlement plan has been reviewed and approved by ADB. All resettlement activities \nwill be coordinated with the civil works schedule. MARD will ensure that civil works contractors \nwill  not  be  issued  a  notice  of  possession  of  the  site  until  (i)  compensation  and  relocation  of \naffected  persons  have  been  satisfactorily  completed;  (ii)  agreed  rehabilitation  assistance  is  in \nplace; and (iii) the site is free of all encumbrances (where relevant). \n\nE. \n\nConsultation, Grievance Redress, and Disclosure \n\n8. \nConsultation  with  the  affected  persons  will  take  place  from  the  SIR  preparation  stage, \nand will be completed prior to finalization of detailed designs and resettlement plan so that their \nneeds  and  preferences  can  be  incorporated  into  the  design  where  practicable.  They  will  also \nparticipate in the various resettlement plan processes, including (i) preparation of the inventory \nof  losses,  (ii)  validation  of  compensation  rates  and  entitlements,  (iii)  handover  of  entitlements, \n(iv) monitoring of impacts and benefits, and (v) discussion and settlement of grievances. \n\nTo  ensure  that  all  grievances  of  those  affected  on  any  aspect  of  land  acquisition, \n9. \ncompensation,  relocation,  and  determination  and  payment  of  entitlements  are  resolved  in  a \ntimely  and  satisfactory  manner,  and  that  all  avenues  for  airing  grievances  are  available,  the \nProject will set up a mechanism to deal with any such grievances during project implementation. \nThe affected persons will be made fully aware of their rights (both verbally and in writing) during \nconsultations  and  at  each  phase  of  the  resettlement  process.  Detailed  procedures  for  hearing \nand redressing grievances, including appeal processes, will be made public through an effective \npublic  information  campaign.  The  CARB  will  record  and  report  on  all  complaints  and  their \nresolution.  An  independent  monitor  will  check  procedures  and  resolutions  of  grievances  and \ncomplaints. \n\n \n\n \n\n10. \nThe PPMUs, assisted by the resettlement committees, will disclose (i) draft resettlement \nplans prior to submission for review and approval by ADB, (ii) final resettlement plans approved \nby  the  CPMU  and  ADB,  and  (iii)  any  revisions  to  resettlement  plan  as  a  result  of  changes  in \nscope  or  design  layout.

The CARB will submit \nmonthly progress reports to the PPMU  which will review  and forward them to the CPMU. The \nCPMU  will  consolidate  all  provincial  reports  into  the  project  performance  monitoring  system, \nwhich will be used to prepare regular progress reports for submission to ADB. Monitoring and \nevaluation will also focus on social impacts and whether the people affected are able to restore, \nand preferably improve, their preproject living standards, incomes, and productive capacity. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14     57 \n\nThe  CPMU  will  recruit  an  independent  monitoring  organization  to  conduct  external \n12. \nmonitoring and evaluation of resettlement for the Project, focusing on the social impacts of the \nProject  and  whether  affected  persons  are  able  to  restore,  and  preferably  improve,  their \npreproject  living  standards,  incomes,  and  productive  capacity  about  12  months  after \ncompensation  and  relocation  have  been  completed.  All  such  reports  will  be  submitted  to  the \nCPMU and ADB. \n\nG. \n\nBudget \n\n13. \nAll  compensation  for  land  and  other  affected  assets  will  be  paid  at  replacement  cost \nbased  on  current  market  prices.  Compensation  rates  will  be  established  for  each  project \nprovince, at replacement cost based on market prices during the replacement cost survey. All \ncosts  for  subproject  resettlement  programs  under  the  Project  including  land  acquisition, \ncompensation  and  allowances,  operation  and  administration  costs,  surveys,  monitoring,  and \nreporting  will  be  financed  from  loan  funds.  The  commune  resettlement  committees  will  be \nresponsible  for  payment  of  compensation  directly  to  those  affected.  If  ADB  loan  funds  are \nutilized, the resettlement plans will identify key activities for which funds will be used, and any \ndisbursal and auditing requirements that will facilitate appropriate and timely delivery. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n1.
