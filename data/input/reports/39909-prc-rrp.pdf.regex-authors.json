I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nequity investment of up to $20 million equivalent in Thunip Water Investment Co., Ltd., an \ninvestment company to be established in Beijing, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), by \nThunip  Holdings  Co.,  Ltd.  for  the  Tsinghua  Water  Infrastructure  Development  Project  (the \nProject).1 \n \n \nII.  INTRODUCTION \n2.  The Project is being sponsored by Thunip Holdings,2 a leading domestic engineering-\nprocurement-construction  (EPC)  contractor,  developer,  and  investor  in  the  environmental \nprotection sector in the PRC. Although its investment focus is wastewater treatment and water \nsupply projects, Thunip Holdings engages in various environmental protection activities, mainly \nin  consultancy,  EPC  and  operation,  and  covers  water  supply,  wastewater  treatment,  soil \nrecovery, sanitary landfill, and incineration. Thunip Holdings has been involved in more than \n1,000 environmental protection projects, and its good reputation, solid track record, and awards \nfrom  the  Government  prove  that  the  company  has  outstanding  technical  capacity  and \nmanagement skills.  \n \n3.  The proposed formation of Thunip Water was a response to the increasing opportunities \nfor commercial capital and sound management to participate in the PRC water supply and \nwastewater  treatment  sectors.  Thunip  Water,  through  joint  ventures  with  various  partners, \nincluding the water supply and/or sewage utility companies of various municipalities, will build, \nrehabilitate,  expand,  upgrade,  privatize,  and/or  operate  small  and  medium-scale  water \ninfrastructure facilities, with a strong focus on wastewater treatment projects, in various cities in \nthe PRC.    \n \n \nIII.  BACKGROUND \nA.  The Water and Wastewater Sectors \n4.  Reducing the pollution of rivers and lakes and improving the supply of clean drinking \nwater  is  part  of  any  pro-poor  development  strategy.  The  poor  are  most  vulnerable  to \nenvironment-induced diseases and are least capable of paying for adequate medical attention \nfor digestive track ailments associated with drinking polluted water. The pollution of rivers and \nlakes  reduces  already  scarce  water  sources  for  drinking  water.  Bottled  water  is  a  very \nexpensive alternative to clean, potable tap water. The financial burden of buying bottled water \nfalls most heavily on the poor and can account for a disproportionately high portion of their \nlimited incomes. Much remains to be done to reduce the adverse impact of water pollution on \nthe poor and to end shortages of clean drinking water. \n \n5.  In the PRC, only about 40% of urban wastewater is treated and the rest is discharged \nuntreated into rivers, lakes and seas.  More than 40% of the water in the seven major river \n                                                 \n1  The Project will undertake investments in both the water supply sector and the wastewater treatment sector. Based \non the expertise, track record and strategy of Thunip Holdings and the market situation, it is expected that the main \nfocus will be on wastewater treatment projects. \n2  In 2004, the company changed its name from Tsinghua Unisplendour Environmental Protection Co., Ltd. to Thunip \nHoldings Co., Ltd.  ", "2   \nbasins  does  not  meet  the  Grade  III3 national  quality  standard.  Major  lakes  have  serious \neutrophication problems. The Government is aware that addressing environmental problems is \ncritical for sustainable development and poverty reduction. It plans to increase centralized urban \nwastewater treatment capacity during the 10th Five-Year Plan period (2001\u20132005) by 26 million \nm3/day, which will raise the treatment rate of municipal wastewater from 34% to 45%.4 It is \nestimated that CNY110\u2013120 billion is needed to reach this target, including the cost of building \nsewerage networks. Mainly because of a lack of financial resources, progress is behind the \nGovernment\u2019s schedule.  \n \n6.  The pollution of rivers and lakes puts further pressure on already scarce water sources. \nWater resources and availability in the PRC vary significantly across regions and during the \nyear, and water scarcity is one of the biggest challenges facing the country. There are serious \nwater shortages in northern PRC. Per capita water availability ranges from 360 m3 to 750 m3 \n(both of which are lower than the international definition of water scarcity of 1,000 m3/person). \nAlthough more than 90% of urban households in large cities have access to piped water, this \nfigure  obscures  shortages  in  many  cities,  particularly  those  in  the  water-scarce  northern \nprovinces.  \n \n7.  Increased urbanization has placed pressure on water supply and wastewater treatment \nand has had a negative impact on water quality. Inadequate facilities for treating municipal \nwastewater have led to pollution of already scarce water sources. The urban population in the \nPRC was about 542 million in 2004, and another 150\u2013200 million people from rural areas are \nexpected to migrate to cities over the next 10\u201315 years. More investment is needed to supply \nclean drinking water and to treat wastewater. The Ministry of Construction has estimated the \ninvestment needs for water infrastructure during 2000\u20132010 to be at least CNY530 billion ($65 \nbillion).  \n \n8.  The  responsibility  for  developing  water  infrastructure  falls  on  local  municipalities. \nHowever, funding for water infrastructure in municipalities is limited, mainly because (i) they are \nconstrained by their limited financial budgets and overall infrastructure needs, (ii) they do not \nhave  direct  access  to  multilateral  or  other  external  financing  sources,  and  (iii)  some \nmunicipalities may not be able to meet the Government\u2019s counterpart funding requirements.  \n \n9.  Private  sector  funding  is  clearly  needed  for  both  the  water  supply  and  wastewater \ntreatment sectors. Private sector participation can also lead to more use of new technology and \nenhance  efficiency.  However,  although  the  Government  has  encouraged  private  sector \nparticipation, private funding in water and sanitation infrastructure is negligible in wastewater \ntreatment. This lack of interest is due to (i) complicated and rigid project approval procedures, (ii) \ninconsistent application of government regulations, (iii) inadequate tariff revenue, and (iv) high \ntransaction and operating costs.   \n \n10.  Difficulty in raising financing is another significant barrier to private sector participation. \nWater infrastructure projects, especially wastewater treatment facilities, tend to be small, so \nthere  are  relatively  high  transaction  costs  in  setting  up  complicated  funding  structures. \nTraditional funding structures usually require a high proportion of equity investment and/or \nrecourse to a strong parent company. Experienced international investors are interested only in \n                                                 \n3  Grade III represents the minimum standard of suitable water source for treated potable water supply. \n4  National guidelines also require that cities discharging more than 500,000 m3/day are expected to reach a \ntreatment rate of 60% and major cities, such as provincial capitals, to achieve a wastewater treatment rate of 70% \nby 2010. ", "  3\nlarge projects with sophisticated funding structures, and have little interest in small projects. \nLocal investors, on the other hand, are relatively new and have limited financial resources, so \nthey can develop only a few projects. Limited private sector participation in the water and \nwastewater sectors of PRC, especially in small and medium-scale projects, has restricted the \nmobilization of resources for the sector.  In the  development of water infrastructure in the PRC, \npriority needs to be given to dedicated and qualified local sponsors through equity investments, \nin order to mobilize debt financing in the domestic loan market, which is relatively liquid.  \n \nB.  Government Policies and Plans \n11.  The  Government  has  accorded  priority  in  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005)  to \nresolving water pollution and the scarcity of water, especially in urban areas, as the Government \nplans to develop small- and medium-sized cities to absorb surplus rural labor. According to the \nState Environment Protection Administration (SEPA) this will be continued in 11th Five Year \nPlan (2006\u20132010). The Government\u2019s strategy in the water sector focuses on (i) developing \nwater sources; (ii) protecting existing sources by controlling industrial and residential pollution; \n(iii) controlling  overextraction  from  groundwater  resources;  (iv)  introducing  water-efficient \ntechnologies  and  operations;  and  (v)  using  appropriate  pricing  mechanisms  to  encourage \nconservation and generate funds for operation, maintenance, and investment. To complement \nincreased  investments  in  urban  water  supply  and  wastewater  treatment  facilities,  the \nGovernment will continue to encourage and support raising water and wastewater tariffs to \ncommercial levels, which will improve financial management for water and wastewater projects, \nand encourage private sector participation. \n \nC.  ADB\u2019s Experience and Strategy in Water and Wastewater Sectors \n12.  ADB is active in the water supply and wastewater treatment sectors in the PRC. Its work \nwith  the  Government  helps  to  improve  living  standards  and  economic  productivity,  reduce \nenvironmental degradation, and promote sustainable development. ADB lending to the water \nsupply and wastewater treatment sectors started in 1993, and, as of October 2005, 13 loans \ntotaling $1.3 billion for water supply and sanitation projects, largely in the urban areas, had been \napproved.  These  loans  have  financed  about  4  million  m3/day  of  capacity  to  supply  clean \ndrinking water and more than 2 million m3/day of wastewater treatment. ADB is financing urban \nwastewater, sewage treatment, water supply, and water resources management projects in line \nwith its strategy to support environmental improvement in the PRC. To maximize development \nimpact, especially among the urban poor, ADB's involvement has been targeted at densely \npopulated urban areas.  \n \n13.  The principal objectives of ADB assistance in the sector are to (i) address environmental \nissues in the water sector, (ii) provide safe drinking water and sanitation facilities to improve the \nhealth  and  productivity  of  large  urban  populations,  (iii)  improve  financial  management  to \ngenerate internal resources for investment and ensure sustainable operations and maintenance, \nand (iv) improve institutional capacity to operate and maintain urban systems effectively. These \nobjectives are in line with ADB\u2019s water policy.5  \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2001. Water For All. Manila. \n ", "4   \nD.  Country Strategy and Private Sector Operations in the PRC \n14.  The ADB country strategy and program for the PRC6 is based on four development \nobjectives:  (i)  promoting  equitable  and  inclusive  growth,  (ii)  making  markets  work  better, \n(iii) improving  the  environment,  and  (iv)  promoting  regional  cooperation.  ADB\u2019s  assistance \nfocuses on reducing the inequality between the coastal and interior provinces and the income \ngap  between  the  urban  and  rural  populations.  The  Government  accords  high  priority  to \nexpediting the PRC\u2019s transition to a market economy as the basis for growth and job creation, \nwhich will require more efficient markets for the private sector. This includes tariff reform and the \nconversion of public utility enterprises to private corporations. The Government and ADB also \npromote improvements to the urban environment. It is anticipated that ADB's public sector \noperations in the PRC will support 6\u20137 urban wastewater management projects in 2006\u20132008. \n \n15.  ADB\u2019s private sector operations in the PRC focus on the infrastructure and energy \nsectors, the financial sector, and environmental improvements.   \n \n16.  ADB has played a particularly significant role in promoting private sector involvement in \nthe PRC\u2019s water sector. In 1996, ADB technical assistance promoted private sector involvement \non a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis for water supply projects.7  This was followed by further \ntechnical assistance to help the Government prepare a pilot BOT project8 which resulted in the \nsuccessful preparation  and  implementation  of  the  Chengdu  Water  Supply  Project,9 now  in \ncommercial operation.   \n \n17.  ADB plans to increase its private sector operations in the PRC substantially and has \nrecently raised local currency resources through its first CNY-denominated bond issue. The \nTsinghua Water Infrastructure Development Project will be ADB\u2019s first infrastructure project \nusing local currency in the PRC, which is in line with ADB\u2019s strategy of using local currency and \ntherefore  avoiding  foreign  exchange  risk.  In  the  infrastructure  and  energy  sectors,  ADB \nprioritizes pioneering projects with innovative contractual and financial structuring to encourage \nprivate  sector  participation,  enhance  management  expertise,  and  improve  corporate \ngovernance. ADB promotes commercialization, privatization, and public\u2013private partnerships \nthrough technology and management transfer to local entities currently owned by the public \nsector.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Description \n18.  The Project is designed to attract equity funds to finance the development of municipal \nwater and wastewater infrastructure facilities, with a strong focus on wastewater treatment. It \nwill consist of the initial equity commitments for the capitalization of Thunip Water, totaling up to \n$100 million: 40% from the Thunip Holdings and 60% from commitments by ADB and other \nprivate investors. Thunip Water will enter into joint ventures with various partners, including the \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2005.

Approved \nfor a direct loan of $26.5 million and a loan under the complementary financing scheme of $21.5 million. ", "  5\nwater supply and/or sewage utility companies of various municipalities, to build, rehabilitate, \nexpand,  upgrade,  privatize,  and/or  operate  small  and  medium-scale  water  infrastructure \nfacilities, including water supply and wastewater treatment projects, in various cities in the PRC. \nAfter the committed funds in the Project are fully deployed, it is anticipated that Thunip Water \nwill continue its operations, retaining earnings, and raising funds from other sources   \n \n19.  Thunip Water will target cities for its water supply and wastewater treatment projects. \nMost of its investment will be green field projects under the BOT scheme or other similar \nstructures.  In smaller cities, the form of investment will be tailored to suit the specific local \nsituation. Some projects may involve Thunip Water purchasing an existing water or wastewater \ntreatment plant for refurbishing and/or expanding, and the municipality using the sales proceeds \nto expand the local distribution or sewerage network, add raw water supply capacity, and/or to \ndevelop other water and wastewater infrastructures. Thunip Water is expected to develop 20\u201330 \nnew projects within the next 5 years, building an investment portfolio of $100 million. Thunip \nWater will use the cash receipts from dividends from its joint ventures to develop new projects \nand service its obligations to the investors, including ADB. Through investments successfully \nnegotiated  with  partner  municipalities,  Thunip  Water  may  also  obtain  priority  position  for \nparticipation in future expansion of the facilities involved.  \n \nB.  Sponsor \n20.  Incorporated  in  Beijing  in  2002,  Thunip  Holdings  originated  from  an  environmental \nengineering  centre  (established  in  1988)  of  Tsinghua  University,  a  well-known  national \nuniversity and has outstanding technical capacity. Since its launch, Thunip Holdings has been \nsupported by Tsinghua University and university-owned companies with respect to technology, \nhuman resource and business opportunity. Thunip Holdings is run on a commercial basis and \nenjoys autonomy and managerial freedom.     \n \n21.  Thunip Holdings has considerable experience of developing and operating wastewater \ntreatment  projects  in  the  PRC.    It  has  strong  technology  and  research  capability,  and  its \noperational experience is satisfactory.  Because of its established market reputation and 17 \nyears\u2019 experience in environmental protection, it is often approached by municipalities seeking \nassistance on water and wastewater projects. This helps it to minimize its marketing efforts. \nWith  low  administration  and  marketing  expenses,  Thunip  Holdings  is  able  to  focus  on \ndeveloping small and medium-scale water and wastewater facilities to a high standard.   \n \nC.  Environmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n1.  Environmental Aspects \n22.  The Project will have positive environmental impacts on clean drinking water supply and \nwater pollution control in small and medium-sized municipalities. It will also help the government \nto diversify financial sources for environmental investment and enhance its effectiveness. The \nProject will have limited and short-term adverse environmental impacts and mitigation measures \nwill be taken during construction. Treatment plant sites are usually located outside city limits on \nvacant plots or in sparsely populated areas, which limits their impact. During treatment plant \noperations, noise and odor pollution may be created, so plant designs will include noise and \nodor control facilities and equipment. Treatment plant sites will incorporate landscape designs. \n \n23.  The Project is classified as environmental category FI. Thunip Water will set up an \nenvironmental management system (EMS), including environmental assessment and review \n ", "6   \nprocedures  for  potential  investments  that  are  acceptable  to  ADB.  ADB\u2019s  environmental \nguidelines and policies and the PRC\u2019s environmental laws and regulations will be complied with, \nand implementation of environmental mitigation measures will be monitored in collaboration with \nmunicipal environmental protection bureaus. Such environmental mitigation measures will be \nincluded in progress reports on project implementation and annual reports on environmental \nmonitoring. Thunip Water will confirm to ADB periodically its compliance with ADB and PRC \nenvironmental requirements and make reports on these matters available to ADB. A conceptual \nframework for the establishment of an EMS for the Thunip Water is given in Appendix 2. \n \n2.  Social Dimensions \n24.  The Project is classified as involuntary resettlement category FI and indigenous people \ncategory  C.  Under  the  current  private  sector  participation  arrangements  for  water  and \nwastewater projects in the PRC, land acquisition and relocation of inhabitants are carried out by \nthe municipal governments before the concessions are open for competition. Thunip Water will \ntherefore have only a limited role in land acquisition and relocation. Before investing, Thunip \nWater will undertake due diligence to ensure that any water or wastewater project has not, or \nwill not, involve acquisition of rights to land or displacement of people or enterprises.  In the \nevent that Thunip Water and/or any of the joint venture projects becomes involved in the \nacquisition  of  ownership  or  possession  of  land  use  rights,  and  such  acquisition  results  in \ninvoluntary resettlement, Thunip Water, together with the relevant joint venture, shall ensure \nthat  all  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  are  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the \nrequirements of ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement10 and Thunip Water\u2019s resettlement \npolicy framework and resettlement procedural guidelines, as agreed by Thunip Holdings and \nacceptable to ADB (Appendix 3).  Thunip Water, together with its joint venture projects, shall \nensure compliance with ADB\u2019s policy on indigenous peoples. To ensure tariff affordability, the \njoint venture project selection criteria will include an assessment of tariff affordability.  \n \n3.  Development Impacts \n25.  The Project will develop wastewater treatment facilities in the PRC. Over one third of the \ncountry\u2019s river systems are estimated to be polluted and more than 90% of the catchment areas \naround the cities are badly contaminated. About 50% of water resources do not conform to PRC \ndrinking water standards. Investments in wastewater treatment will improve the environment \nand help arrest pollution of water sources, facilitating delivery of water that meets national \nstandards and reducing threats to public health. The poor tend to suffer the most economically \nfrom increased medical costs or loss of income as a result of waterborne diseases. Investments \nin wastewater will reduce these costs and contribute to improving the economy as a whole.  \n \n26.  The Project may also expand water supply capacity in the PRC. Access to water has \nbeen a major problem in some municipalities, particularly in northern PRC. An increase in the \nwater supply will enable increased industrial output, among other benefits. Access to piped \nwater supply increases productivity by eliminating time spent in fetching and queuing for water \nwhich can now be channeled to other productive activities. For the urban poor, access to safe \ndrinking water reduces the risk of waterborne diseases, improving health and productivity.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 1995. Involuntary Resettlement. Manila. ", "  7\n4.  Development Effectiveness \na.  Project Performance \n \n27.  The Project will be assessed against its specific investment capital, operational, and \nfinancial objectives. Effectiveness will be measured by how successfully the Project attracts \nprivate sector capital, how it secures municipal water and wastewater facility concessions, \nwhether it develops and expands municipal water and wastewater infrastructure facilities, how \nmuch water it supplies, how much wastewater it treats, and whether it improves the quality of \nurban life and public health. The Project will also be judged by its financial profitability, its \nsustainability, and timely returns to investors. \n   \n  b.   Economic Sustainability \n \n28.  From an economic sustainability point of view, the Project will be assessed on its ability \nto develop and implement water infrastructure facilities, supply water to and treat wastewater \nfrom consumers, and contribute to environment improvements and economic growth. Additional \nemployment created as a result of project implementation will also be taken into account.  \n   \n  c.   Private Sector Development \n \n29.  The Project will be assessed on how it contributes to private sector development. The \nfocus will be on its commercial and financial viability, and on its catalytic effect on future private \ninvestments in the water and wastewater sectors and on the broader economy.  \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n30.  Thunip Holdings plans to raise up to $60 million equity, in US dollars and/or yuan, from \nstrategic investors, including ADB, to fund its planned investments in the water and wastewater \nsectors over the next 5 years. The funding needs of Thunip Water will largely depend on the \nequity requirements of its new joint venture projects and ADB\u2019s investment will be used in these \nnew  joint  venture  projects.  The  joint  venture  projects  will  be  able  to  borrow  from  local \ncommercial banks.  \n \nE.  Other Potential Investors \n31.  Thunip Holdings is aiming to raise $60 million from a select group of investors (including \nADB) in a private placement. Commitments from a substantial portion of the private placement \nwill be a condition for ADB\u2019s equity disbursement.   \n \n \nV.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Proposed Equity Investment \n32.  The proposed ADB investment will be up to $20 million equivalent, in US dollars or \nyuan,11 to be disbursed in stages, for a stake of up to 20% of the equity capital of Thunip Water. \n                                                 \n11  The proposed ADB investment will preferably be disbursed in yuan. However, although the Government has given \ngeneral  approval  for  ADB  to  use  of  the  proceeds  of  ADB\u2019s  CNY-denominated  bonds  to  undertake  equity \ninvestment, if ADB is to use the bond proceeds for equity investment in an investment company the Government\u2019s \n ", "8   \nThrough Thunip Water, the ADB funds will be invested in new water supply and wastewater \ntreatment projects. It is expected that the new projects will be developed over the next 5 years, \nso the proposed ADB investment will be available for disbursement for 5 years, based on the \ninvestment requirements of Thunip Water. ADB\u2019s shareholding in Thunip Water will be no more \nthan 20% at any point of time. \n \nB.  Justification \n33.  ADB\u2019s support for the Project is justified because it will have significant development \nimpacts and demonstration effects; it complements the Government\u2019s development plans and \nADB\u2019s operational strategies; and ADB\u2019s participation in the Project will add value.  \n \n(i)  By developing small or medium-scale wastewater treatment and water supply \nfacilities across the PRC, thus helping to reduce pollution of water sources and \nimproving  the  quantity  and  quality  of  water,  the  Project  will  support  the \nGovernment\u2019s  11th  Five-Year  Plan,  and  contribute  to  the  achievement  of \nGovernment targets for urban sewage treatment and water supply. \n \n(ii)  The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country, sector and thematic strategies and \nits involvement in the water supply and wastewater treatment sectors in the \nPRC.12 Lessons learned will be conveyed to the Government.   \n \n(iii)  The  expansion  of  small  and  medium-scale  municipal  water  and  wastewater \ninfrastructure facilities will improve the quality of urban life and public health, \narrest environmental degradation, and sustain acceptable levels of economic \ngrowth.

Introduction   \n \n1.  As a holding company for environmental management, Thunip Water Investment Co., \nLtd. (Thunip Water) is committed to ensuring that its water and wastewater treatment business \nwill not create adverse environmental and social impacts. In this regard, Thunip Water will need \nto establish and effectively operate an appropriate environmental management system (EMS) at \nboth the corporate and joint venture company levels.  This appendix presents a conceptual \nframework for the establishment of EMS in the context of Thunip Water. It is intended to serve \nas a basis for discussion between the ADB and Thunip Water to work out an appropriate EMS \nacceptable to both parties.  \n \n2.  The conceptual framework presented herein is based on a good understanding of: (i) the \nextent to which Thunip Water can manage environmental and social aspects of its business; \nand (ii) environmental and social impacts of water and wastewater treatment projects.  \n \nB.  Environmental Policy Framework \n \n3.  Thunip Water needs to formulate a pragmatic corporate policy for environmental and \nsocial  management  of  its  business.  The  EMS  is  a  tool  to  ensure  that  the  corporate \nenvironmental and social policy will be efficiently and effectively implemented by all its business \nunits  and  joint  venture  companies.  This  section  proposes  a  policy  statement  and  guiding \nprinciples for implementing the policy as part of the normal conduct of the business.  \n \n1.  Suggested Policy Statement \n \n4.  An environmental policy should \n \n(i)  be relevant to activities, \n \n(ii)  comply with relevant environmental legislation and standards, \n \n(iii)  commit to the prevention of pollution, \n \n(iv)  commit to continual improvement, \n \n(v)  commit to setting environmental objectives and targets, \n \n(vi)  be known to employees and public, and \n \n(vii)  encourage  cleaner  production  mechanism  during  design  and  operation  of \nfacilities. \n \n5.  Based  on  the  above  principles,  the  following  policy  statement  for  Thunip  Water  is \nsuggested: \n \n  Our core business is environmental improvement through providing water and \nwastewater treatment services in various cities in the People\u2019s Republic of China.  ", "                                                                                                                                                     Appendix 2   13\nAs a good corporate citizen, we are fully committed to minimizing environmental \nand social impacts of our water and wastewater treatment plant construction and \noperations, in full compliance with all relevant national and local laws, regulations \nand standards regarding environmental and social aspects of our business.  We \nwill strive to excel in this endeavor with full involvement of our staff and the \npublic. \n \n6.  Thunip  Water  should  revise  the  above  suggested  policy  statement  as  it  sees \nappropriate. However, the policy should follow the above principles. \n \n2.  Guiding Principles for Policy Implementation \n \n7.  The following guiding principles are suggested for implementation of Thunip Water\u2019s \nenvironmental and social policy: \n \n(i)  Guiding Principles for Thunip Water \n \n(a)  Thunip Water will avoid participating in bidding for projects that will be \nconstructed on intensively inhabited land or on ecologically or socially \nsensitive areas. Examples of such sensitive areas include cultural sites \nand swamp forests. \n \n(b)  Thunip Water will ensure that the land provided by the local governments \nhas no pending issues with the former occupants related to compensation \nand resettlement assistance. \n \n(c)  Thunip Water will review the project environmental impact assessment \n(EIA)  and  the  recommended  environmental  management  plan  (EMP) \nprepared by the local governments to identify gaps or inadequacies that \ncould undermine the environmental and social integrity of the project. If \nsuch inadequacies are found, Thunip Water will discuss with the local \ngovernments how the EIA and EMP can be improved. \n \n(d)  Thunip Water will review the detailed designs and specifications prepared \nby the engaged design institutes or firms, to ensure that the designs and \nspecifications are environmentally sound and fully comply with the EMP. \n \n(e)  Thunip  Water  will  include  in  the  construction  contracts  appropriate \nenvironmental and social management clauses related to the EMP, and \nwill ensure that the contractors will fully comply with the environmental \nand social management clauses and applicable rules and regulations of \nthe national and local governments.  \n \n(f)  Thunip  Water  will  fully  comply  with  the  monitoring  and  reporting \nrequirements during construction as prescribed in the EMP in compliance \nwith applicable national and local laws and regulations. \n \n(g)  Thunip  Water  will  fully  comply  with  the  monitoring  and  reporting \nrequirements during the operation of project facilities as prescribed in the \nEMP  in  compliance  with  applicable  national  and  local  laws  and \nregulations. ", "14    Appendix 2 \n(h)  Thunip  Water  will  report  its  environmental  and  social  management \nactivities as part of its annual reports. \n \n(ii)  Guiding Principles for the joint venture companies \n \n(a)  Each joint venture company will establish an appropriate EMS to ensure \nfull integration of environmental and social management with its routine \noperation and maintenance of water and wastewater treatment plants and \nassociated facilities.   \n \n(b)  Each joint venture company will efficiently operate water and wastewater \ntreatment plants including environmental management facilities to ensure \nfull  compliance  with  the  applicable  national  and  local  laws  and \nregulations, and efficient use of energy and water resources. \n \n(c)  Each joint venture company will prepare an emergency response plan \n(ERP) specific to its operations. \n \n(d)  Each  joint  venture  company  will  implement  an  appropriate  public \ninformation program related to its environmental and social management \nactivities. \n \n(e)  Each joint venture company is encouraged to be part of the community in \nwhich it operates. \n \nC.  Environmental Management System (EMS) Design Framework \n \n1.  EMS Elements and Activities \n \n8.  The EMS elements will be in line with the four main tasks of management \u201cplan, do, \ncheck, act.\u201d These elements involve different activities during the construction and operation \nstages  of  a  project.  Activities  at  the  corporate  and  joint  venture  company  levels  are  also \ndifferent. The activities at the corporate level are focused on overseeing the environmental and \nsocial management activities carried out at the joint venture company level.  \n \n2.  Work Process and Procedures \n \n9.  In setting up the EMS, Thunip Water will have to establish clear work processes and \nprocedures or guidelines for all tasks at the corporate and subsidiary company levels, including:   \n   \n(i)  Thunip Water Level \n \n(a)  Review of EIA, EMP and detailed design prepared by the engaged design \ninstitutes or firms and approved by the local governments as necessary \n \n(b)  Changes or modifications of EMP and detailed designs \n \n(c)  Review of environmental and social management plan of the contractors\u2019 \nproposals \n ", "                                                                                                                                                     Appendix 2   15\n(d)  Preparation and incorporation of environmental and social management \nclauses in the construction contracts \n \n(e)  Audit of environmental and social management compliance during the \nconstruction and operations of the treatment plants, and rectification of \nnon-compliance and partial compliance \n \n(f)  Reporting the corporate environmental and social performance \n \n(ii)  Joint Venture Company Level \n \n(a)  Monitoring and evaluation of contractor\u2019s compliance with environmental \nand  social  management  requirements  in  the  contract  during  the \nconstruction \n \n(b)  Preparation of environmental and social management plan as part of its \ntreatment plant operational plan \n(c)  Monitoring and evaluation of environmental and social activities as parts \nof routine operations of the treatment plant \n \n(d)  Reporting the company environmental and social performance \n  \n3.  Organization \n \na.  Thunip Water Level \n \n10.  Thunip  Water  should  have  one  designated  manager  for  environmental  and  social \nmanagement to operate the EMS. The environmental and social (ES) manager may have one \nprofessional assistant if the workload warrants. The ES manager should report directly to the \nManaging Director. It would be appropriate to include safety aspects of the treatment plant \noperations in the EMS. \n \nb.  Joint Venture Level \n \n11.  At the treatment plant level, the environmental and social management activities are \ncarried out as part of routine plant operations. For example, the operation and maintenance of \nodor control equipment and facilities are normally a part of the operation and control of the \nwastewater treatment plant. However, the results of environmental and social management \nshould  be  reviewed  and  evaluated  separately  from  those  of  the  normal  treatment  plant \noperations.   \n \n12.  The  organization  for  EMS  operation  at  the  company  level  should  be  simple.  It  is \nproposed that a deputy general manager or assistant general manager concurrently serves as \nenvironmental and social manager. His/her main tasks will be monitoring and evaluation of the \nenvironmental and social performance of the company, rectifying compliance deficiencies, and \nreporting to the general manager.  \n \n4.  Budgeting \n \n13.  Expenses incurred in environmental and social management at the treatment plant level \nwill  be  included  in  the  budget  for  operation  of  the  treatment  plant.  Expenses  incurred  in ", "16    Appendix 2 \nenvironmental and social management at the Thunip Water level will be part of the corporate \noverhead expenses. A large part of the expenses would be personnel costs. \n ", "                                                                                                                                                     Appendix 3  17\nLAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK FOR THUNIP WATER \nINVESTMENT CO., LTD. \n \nA.  Objectives \n \n1.  This resettlement framework defines the policies, procedures, roles and responsibilities \nof  Thunip  Water  Investment  Co.  Ltd.  (Thunip  Water)  for  screening  and  management  of \ninvoluntary  resettlement  in  projects  undertaken  through  joint  venture  companies.    The \nresettlement framework has been prepared by Thunip Water as part of its commitment to \ncomplying with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) safeguard policies, in particular ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995).  \n \nB.  Expected Scope of Involuntary Resettlement in Thunip Water Operations \n \n2.  Thunip Water is a holding company that will form joint venture companies, with various \npartners, to undertake some or all of the following activities: finance, design, construct and/or \noperate water and wastewater projects. The holding company expects to invest in 20-30 such \nprojects  in  various  locations  around  the  PRC.  Some  projects,  such  as  those  that  involve \nrefinancing, upgrading or operation of long-established facilities will not involve involuntary \nresettlement impacts.  Other projects may involve involuntary resettlement impacts through (i) \nland acquisition to expand or construct new facilities; or, (ii) land that has been acquired prior to \nThunip Water\u2019s involvement.  \n \n3.  Thunip Water, itself, will not be involved directly in land acquisition or resettlement. Such \nactivities  will  typically  be  undertaken  by  county  or  municipal  governments,  where  Thunip \nWater\u2019s joint venture companies are located. Accordingly, this resettlement framework sets out \nthe  procedures  roles  and  responsibilities  for  ensuring  that  ADB\u2019s  involuntary  resettlement \nsafeguard requirements are fully complied with by Thunip Water and its joint venture partners. \n \nC.  Investment Selection Criteria \n \n4.  Since water and wastewater investments have a long planning period, preference will be \ngiven to selecting projects for investment that are at an advanced stage of planning, and where \nmunicipal  support  and  solid  preparation  are  demonstrated.  Thunip  Water  will  thus  select \nprojects  that  conform  with  municipal  land  use  planning  regulations,  evidenced  through \nproduction of a valid land transfer contract with the relevant municipal land bureau or private title \nholder, together with a valid land title certificate (with red line site map). In addition, Thunip \nWater will ensure that no project is selected for investment that is not in compliance with ADB\u2019s \nIndigenous Peoples Policy (1998). \n \nD.  Definitions \n \n5.  For the purposes of this framework, the following definitions will apply: \n \n(i)  Involuntary  resettlement\u2014refers  to  social  and  economic  impacts  that  are \npermanent or temporary and are caused (a) by acquisition of land and other fixed \nassets, (b) by change in the use of land, or (c) by restrictions imposed on land as \na result of a Thunip Water investment.   \n \n(ii)  Affected person\u2014-includes any people, households, firms, or private institutions \nwho,  on  account  of  changes  that result  from  the  project,  will  have  their  (a) ", "18      Appendix 3 \nstandard of living adversely affected; (b) right, title, or interest in any house, land \n(including residential, commercial, agricultural, forest, and/or grazing land), water \nresources,  or  any  other  moveable  or  fixed  assets  acquired,  possessed, \nrestricted,  or  otherwise  adversely  affected,  in  full  or  in  part,  permanently  or \ntemporarily;  and/or  (c)  business,  occupation,  place  of  work  or  residence,  or \nhabitat adversely affected, with or without displacement.  \n \nE.  Policy Framework \n \n5.  Thunip Water shall ensure that the involuntary resettlement activities of any joint venture \ncompanies are conducted in accordance with the following: \n \n(i)  ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995); and \n \n(ii)  applicable  national  and  provincial  laws  and  regulations  governing  land \nacquisition, compensation and resettlement, and consultation and disclosure of \nresettlement information.  \n \n6.  Objectives for managing involuntary resettlement impacts are  \n \n(i)  to avoid involuntary resettlement wherever feasible;  \n \n(ii)  to minimize resettlement where population displacement is unavoidable; and \n \n(iii)  to ensure that affected persons receive assistance so that they will be at least as \nwell off as they would have been in the absence of the project.  \n \n7.  Resettlement plans will pay particular attention to addressing the needs of the poorest \naffected people and vulnerable groups that may be at high risk of impoverishment. \n \n8.  Resettlement plans will stipulate eligibility and entitlement provisions for land losses, \nhouse losses, crop losses, and loss of other assets at replacement rates. Land losses will be \ncompensated as follows: (i) people losing agricultural and residential land will be compensated \nthrough \u201cland for land\" arrangements wherever feasible; (ii) if \"land for land\" arrangements are \nnot  feasible,  the  person  losing  agricultural  land  will  be  reclassified  and  provided  with  job \nopportunities; (iii) cash compensation for lost land will be paid at the rates stipulated by the Land \nLaw, 1998, to the villages, which in turn will use the funds received for infrastructure and \nservices directly benefiting the affected communities. Resettlement subsidies for land acquired \nwill be directly paid to the people affected in cash through the village offices. House losses and \nloss  of  other  structures  will  be  directly  compensated  in  cash  at  replacement  cost  free  of \ndemolition  costs  and  salvaged  materials.  In-ground  annual  crop  losses  will  be  directly \ncompensated  in  cash  at  current  market  prices.  Business  losses,  including  transfer  and \ndowntime costs, will be paid directly to the business owners. Vulnerable households will receive \nassistance for house relocation and reconstruction, to be organized by the relevant village or \ntownship committee.   \n \nF.  Screening for Involuntary Resettlement Impacts \n \n9.  As part of the due diligence process, prior to investing in any joint venture company, \nThunip Water\u2019s senior officer responsible for social and resettlement performance will determine \nwhether any projects to be undertaken through the prospective joint venture company have (i) ", "                                                                                                                                                     Appendix 3  19\nhistorically involved land acquisition or involuntary resettlement; or, (ii) or may in future involve \ninvoluntary resettlement.  \n \n  1.  Joint venture Projects with No Involuntary Resettlement Impact \n \n10.  Where no involuntary resettlement impacts are indicated, no further action with regard to \nthis resettlement framework will be required. \n \n  2.  Joint venture Projects with Historical Involuntary Resettlement Impacts \n \n11.  In  case  of  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement 1  prior  to  Thunip  Water\u2019s \ninvolvement, Thunip Water\u2019s senior officer responsible for social and resettlement performance \nwill cause to have prepared a resettlement due diligence report. The resettlement due diligence \nreport should provide (i) a brief history of site land acquisition and resettlement, and parties \nresponsible  for  implementation;  (ii)  details  of  affected  land,  population  and  assets; \n(iii) assessment of outcomes with respect to restoration of standards of living and livelihood; \n(iv) information on any outstanding resettlement grievances or related areas of reputational risk; \nand,  (v)  recommend  whether  a  resettlement  plan  is  required  to  define  actions  to  achieve \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s resettlement requirements. The resettlement due diligence report should \nbe submitted to ADB for review and approval prior to finalizing any joint venture agreement. \n \n  3.  Projects with Planned Involuntary Resettlement \n \n12.  In the event that a joint venture project may involve involuntary resettlement, Thunip \nWater\u2019s senior officer responsible for social and resettlement performance will: \n \n(i)  Prior to investment: \n \n(a)  assess the magnitude of resettlement, and in consultation with ADB, determine \nwhether a short or full resettlement plan is required; \n \n(b)  provide the prospective joint venture partner with copies of the ADB policies and \nguidelines; \n \n(c)  advise the prospective joint venture partner of the need for a resettlement plan; \n \n(d)  ensure  that  resettlement  information  is  disclosed  to  affected  persons  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  requirements  and  PRC\u2019s  State  Council \nDecision on Deepening Reform of Land Administration (28th Decree of State \nCouncil of 21 October 2004); \n \n(e)  once a draft resettlement plan has been completed, submit it to ADB for review \nand approval; \n \n(f)  oversight any revisions required by ADB in order to finalize the resettlement plan; \n \n(g)  obtain the joint venture partners\u2019 endorsement of the resettlement plan; \n                                                 \n1  For the purposes of this resettlement framework, historical impacts for which resettlement due diligence will be \nrequired will be limited to projects for which land acquisition or relocation of people (whichever occurred most \nrecently) occurred less than 3 years ago. ", "20      Appendix 3 \n \n(h)  verify local disclosure of the final resettlement plan; \n \n(i)  submit the final resettlement plan for website disclosure and ADB approval; \n \n(j)  confirm ADB approval before proceeding with investment. \n \n(ii)  Following investment: \n \n(a)  monitor implementation of the resettlement plan; \n \n(b)  prepare  and  circulate  monitoring  reports  as  required  under  the  approved \nresettlement plan.  \n \nG.  Resettlement Plans \n \n13.  Prospective joint venture companies involved in or planning involuntary resettlement will \nprepare  a  short  or  full  resettlement  plan,  dependent  on  the  magnitude  and  complexity  of \nresettlement.    A  full  resettlement  plan  will  be  required  where  resettlement  is  \u2018significant\u2019.  \nInvoluntary resettlement is \u2018significant\u2019 when 200 or more people will experience major impacts, \nwhich are defined as: (i) being physically displaced from housing; or, (ii) losing 10% or more of \ntheir productive assets (income generating). The scope of short and full resettlement plans is \noutlined in Table A3.1 and Table A3.2. \n \nH.  Institutional Responsibilities       \n       \n15.  Thunip  Water  has  overall  coordination,  planning,  implementation,  and  financing \nresponsibilities.  Local  municipal  governments,  through  their  resettlement  offices,  will  be \nresponsible for preparation and implementation of the agreed resettlement plans, including \nassets  valuation,  consultation,  and  delivery  of  entitlements.  The  relevant  municipal  land \nmanagement bureaus are responsible for land recording and acquisition approvals. Field tasks \nsuch as payment of entitlements, replacement land selection, provision of livelihood support, \nand monitoring will be responsibility of township officers. \n \n16.  Thunip Water, together with its joint venture partners and local municipal government, \nwill ensure that the relevant municipal land management and resettlement offices are briefed on \ntheir obligations with respect to ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy and requirements of this \nResettlement Framework. Thunip Water will provide assurance to ADB that payments are made \ndirectly and on time to affected persons, and that any shortfalls required to meet resettlement \nobjectives are covered. The entitlements will be provided to the people affected before ground \nleveling and demolition commence. Income support will be provided for the period of dislocation. \n \n17.  Thunip  Water  shall  ensure  that  the  requirement  to  comply  with  this  Resettlement \nFramework and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Plan (1995) shall be incorporated into the \narticles of association of each joint venture company that it invests in. \n \nI.
