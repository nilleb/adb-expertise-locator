\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nunsecured corporate loan without government guarantee of up to $75 million to PT Perusahaan \nGas  Negara  (Persero)  Tbk  (PGN);  (ii)  a  proposed  complementary  loan  of  up  to  $75  million  to \nPGN  provided  by  one  or  more  international  commercial  banks  under  ADB\u2019s  complementary \nfinancing scheme (CFS); and (iii) a proposed complementary loan of up to $50 million to PGN \nprovided by Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) under ADB\u2019s CFS, for the South Sumatra to \nWest Java Phase II Gas Pipeline Project (the Project) in the Republic of Indonesia. If approved, \nthis will be the first ADB loan without government guarantee to a partially privatized state-owned \nenterprise (SOE) in Indonesia. \n \n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n2. \nIndonesia has abundant gas reserves and supplies approximately one fifth of the world\u2019s \nliquefied natural gas (LNG). Nevertheless, development of the country\u2019s natural gas resources \nfor  domestic  use  has  been  slow,  primarily  because  of  the  Government\u2019s  policy  of  subsidizing \ndomestic  petroleum  product  prices,  which  has  historically  caused  gas  prices  to  be  relatively \nuncompetitive.  In  addition,  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  governing  exploration  and \nproduction  of  gas  for  domestic  consumption  has  been  unclear,  and  the  commercial  terms \noffered to investors have been relatively unattractive. As a result, the share of natural gas in the \ndomestic  energy  mix  has  remained  below  30%.  In  2005,  as  a  result  of  steadily  declining  oil \nproduction and  increased  consumption,  Indonesia  became  the  only  OPEC  member  country  to \nbe a net importer of oil and oil products.  \n \n3. \nThe  Government  is  now  keen  to  reduce  the  country\u2019s  reliance  on  oil  and  petroleum \nproducts  and  at  the  same  time  reduce  the  burden  of  fuel  subsidies  on  the  national  budget, \nwhich  would  allow  savings  to  be  diverted  to  essential  education,  health,  and  infrastructure \nspending.  To  this  end  the  Government  took  the  bold  step  of  increasing  domestic  oil  prices by \n29% in March 2005 and by a further 126% in October 2005. These price increases are expected \nto  lead  to  savings  of  about  $10  billion  in  2006  and  have  also  provided  a  strong  incentive  for \nenergy  consumers  to  switch  to  gas  in  order  to  mitigate  the  price  increase.  In  parallel,  the \nGovernment  is  supporting  the  development  of  the  domestic  gas  market  and  is  aiming  to \nincrease gas to at least 30% of the national energy mix by 2025.1 \n \n4. \nPGN  is  Indonesia\u2019s  leading  provider  of  gas  transmission  services  and  the  country\u2019s \ndominant  gas  distributor.  As  part  of  its  expansion  plans  PGN  is  developing  two  major \ntransmission pipelines that will link major gas fields in South Sumatra with major gas-consuming \nareas in West Java. One of these pipelines is the 661 km South Sumatra to West Java Phase II \nGas Pipeline Project.  \n \n5. \nIn April 2005, the Indonesian Ministry of Finance requested that ADB consider a loan to \nPGN on a stand-alone corporate basis without sovereign guarantee, to fund the Project. PGN \nsubsequently  made  the  same  request  to  ADB  in  early  July  2005.  In late  July  2005,  ING  Bank \nsubmitted a letter to PGN, copied to ADB, proposing its role to underwrite and lend under ADB\u2019s \nCFS  and  arrange  a  debt  tranche  from  one  or  more  European  bilateral  institutions.  In  January \n2006, ADB and ING were mandated by PGN to structure an overall loan package in which the \nGerman development financing institution, KfW, and the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) have \nbeen invited to participate. Due diligence was carried out from January to May 2006. \n\n                                                 \n1   Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources.  2005.

Jakarta. \n\nPresidential Regulation No. 5/2006 (Perpres 5/2006) on National Energy Policy, 25 January 2006.  \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\nA. \n\nThe Oil and Gas Sector  \n\n1. \n\nSector Background \n\n6. \nInformation on the oil and gas sector is in Appendix 2. Indonesia has significant reserves \nof oil, natural gas, and coal. The country is particularly well-endowed with natural gas resources, \nwith more than 90 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of proven reserves, the 13th largest gas reserves in the \nworld and the largest gas reserves of any country in Asia and Pacific region. Indonesia\u2019s proven \ngas reserves are three times the country\u2019s oil reserves on an energy-equivalent basis. Most of \nIndonesia\u2019s gas production is converted to LNG and exported to Japan; the Republic of Korea; \nand  Taipei,China.  Indonesia  supplies  about  one  fifth  of  the  world\u2019s  LNG  from  its  gas  fields  in \nAceh and Kalimantan. Gas is also exported via pipeline to Singapore, including from Sumatra \nthrough  the  Grissik  to  Singapore  pipeline,  which  was  financed  by  the  ADB.  Indonesia  is  the \nworld\u2019s 6th largest gas producer. \n\n7. \nEnergy  consumption  in  Indonesia  is  dominated  by  oil  and  gas,  which  together  account \nfor 80% of the primary energy mix (Table 1). Since 2000, domestic oil production has declined \nbecause  of  the  maturation  of  producing  fields  combined  with  a  slower  reserve  replacement. \nOver the same period, the consumption of oil and oil products increased steadily. As a result in \n2005 Indonesia became a net importer of oil.  \n \n\nTable 1: Share of Different Energy Sources \n(%) \n \n1995 \n\n2001 \n\n2000 \n\n1990 \n\n53.36\n6.53\n\n60.13\n5.60\n\nEnergy Type \n \nCrude Oil and Oil Fuels  \nCoal  \nNatural Gas, LPG, and \nLNG  \nHydropower  \nGeothermal \n \nLNG = liquefied natural gas, LPG = liquid petroleum gas. \nSource: Government of Indonesia. \n\n29.44\n4.38\n0.44\n\n34.62\n3.82\n0.61\n\n57.79\n10.18\n\n27.64\n3.22\n1.18\n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n \n53.35 \n14.32 \n\n28.05 \n2.87 \n1.40 \n \n\n \n54.28 \n14.25 \n\n26.46 \n3.58 \n1.44 \n \n\n53.34\n13.80\n\n27.98\n3.48\n1.40\n\n \n8. \nSince  2000,  the  share  of  natural  gas  in  the  domestic  energy  mix  has  remained  below \n30%. However, recent developments have set the stage for natural gas to play a more important \nrole. First, Indonesia has become a net oil importer. Second, the oil subsidy reductions in March \nand  October  2005  have  made  natural  gas  prices  more  competitive.  Third,  the  legal  and \nregulatory  framework  for  gas  exploration  and  production  has  been  strengthened.  As  a  result, \nprivate investors are poised to develop large new gas fields, and the national electric utility, PT \nPLN  Persero,  is  keen  to  increase  the  share  of  natural  gas  in  its  generation  mix.  The  main \nmarket  for  energy  is  in  Java,  which  has  fewer  gas  reserves  than  Kalimantan,  Irian  Jaya,  and \nSumatra,  and  is  dependent  on  natural  gas  from  these  islands.  Major  pipeline  projects/LNG \nterminals are therefore needed to bring natural gas to the Java market.  \n \n9. \nThe  outlook  for  the  oil  and  gas  industry  will  depend  on  the  Government\u2019s  policies  and \nactions.  These  include  (i)  elimination  of  energy  subsidies,  (ii)  incentives  to  encourage \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n \n\n  \n\nexploration  and  production  in  difficult  areas,  (iii)  clear  regulations  and  their  implementation \nwithout prejudice, and (iv) promotion of the efficient use of natural gas as a domestic fuel and \nthe export any surplus oil.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSector Regulation \n\nIn November 2001, a new oil and gas law was passed.2 It recognizes the importance of \n10. \na certain and transparent legal environment in which to conduct business and contemplates the \nestablishment  of  separate  regulators  for  the  upstream  and  downstream  sectors,  thus  ending \nPERTAMINA\u2019s supervisory role for the upstream sector. The law also removed PERTAMINA\u2019s \ndownstream  monopoly,  requires  transmission  and  distribution  pipelines  to  be  regulated,  and \nrequires that third parties have open access to excess pipeline capacity. \n \n11. \nTo  execute  the  new  oil  and  gas  law,  the  Government  has  prepared  a  series  of \nimplementing regulations3 and established regulatory bodies. BP Migas, a nonprofit state-owned \nlegal entity, was established as the contracting authority for the upstream part of the sector. In \nthis role BP Migas has replaced PERTAMINA in existing production sharing contracts and will \nenter into cooperation contracts with entities undertaking exploration and exploitation of oil and \ngas  in  Indonesia.  The  downstream  regulatory  body-cum-contracting  agency,  BPH  Migas,  is \nauthorized to determine and regulate rates for natural gas transmission and distribution through \npipelines,  to  determine  and  regulate  prices  to  residential  and  small-scale  commercial \nconsumers, to resolve disputes among participants in natural gas transportation activities and to \ngrant access and tender rights to participate in the natural gas master plan. Gas prices charged \nto  industrial  and  other  customers  not  classified  as  small  will  remain  unregulated  and  will \ncontinue to be determined bilaterally between the customer and the provider of gas. \n \n \n12. \nThe  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources  has  prepared  and  will  update  a  natural \ngas  master  plan.  The  master  plan  is  intended  to  focus  on  tendering,  development,  and \nconstruction  of  new  projects  to  develop  the  national  gas  transportation  network.  Before  the \ndevelopment of the master plan, licenses to develop some projects had already been granted, \nand for such projects existing licenses remain valid. PGN has already been granted a license for \nphases I and II of the South Sumatra to West Java gas pipeline project.  \n \nB. \n\nADB\u2019s Operations \n\n1. \n\nADB\u2019s Country Strategy for Indonesia \n\n13. \nADB\u2019s new country strategy for Indonesia, currently under preparation, states that ADB \nwill be guided by the Government\u2019s five priority areas to achieve sustainable economic growth, \nwhich is needed to absorb the large number of new entrants to the labor market and to reduce \npoverty.  The  five  priority  areas  are  (i)  job  creation  and  poverty  reduction;  (ii)  macroeconomic \nstability; (iii) increase of investments, exports, and tourism; (iv) improved access to and quality \nof  education  and  health;  and  (v)  infrastructure  development  by  improving  the  efficiency  of \nexisting services and increasing private sector participation. To support the Government\u2019s goal \nand drawing on lessons learned, ADB will focus on (i) development of infrastructure, (ii) financial \nsector  deepening,  (iii)  decentralization,  (iv)  millennium  development  goal  acceleration,  and  (v) \n\n                                                 \n2   Law of the Republic of Indonesia (Number 22 of 2001) Concerning Natural Oil and Gas. \n3   The  Government  Regulations  on \n\nImplementing  Agency  (BP  Migas),  Regulatory  Agency  (BPH  Migas), \nCorporatization of PERTAMINA, Upstream Businesses, Downstream Businesses, and Appointment of the Head of \nImplementing  Agency,  as  well  as  the  Presidential  Decree  on  the  Establishment  of  Regulatory  Agency,  issued  in \n2002\u20132004.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\nenvironment  and  natural  resource  management.  This  Project  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  focus  on \npoints (i) and (v).  \n \n14. \nADB is proposing a major contribution to the development of infrastructure through the \ninfrastructure  reform  program  (IRP),  currently  being  processed.  The  IRP  is  proposed  as  a \nprogram  cluster  comprising  three  sub-programs,  to  be  implemented  from  2006  to  2009.  The \nobjective  of  the  IRP  is  to  strengthen  the  investment  climate  to  accelerate  infrastructure \ndevelopment  through  private  sector  participation  and  additional  public  sector  resources.4 The \npolicy  framework  for  the  IRP  is  based  on  ongoing  reforms  (for  sub-program  1)  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s  own  medium-term  reform  agenda,  with  the  actions  for  sub-programs  2  and  3 \ndefined  in  an  indicative  manner.  The  policy  framework  for  the  IRP  includes  an  assessment  of \npossible further reforms of the oil and gas sector regulatory framework. \n \n\n2. \n\nADB\u2019s Energy Sector Strategy for Indonesia \n\n15. \nADB\u2019s  energy  sector  strategy  supports,  as  operational  priorities,  (i)  poverty  reduction, \nincluding  by  creating  energy  infrastructure  for  sustainable  economic  growth;  (ii)  promotion  of \nprivate  sector  involvement  by  restructuring  the  energy  sector,  and  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment for the private sector; (iii) addressing regional and global environment impacts by \nsupporting measures to address acid rain problems and use of clean energy; and (iv) promotion \nof regional cooperation. This Project assists points (i) through (iii) of this strategy.  \n \n16. \nADB has played a significant role in the development of gas transmission infrastructure \nin  Indonesia  and  in  developing  the  country\u2019s  regulatory  capacity  for  the  oil  and  gas  sector. \nADB\u2019s  Loan  1357-INO5 supported  the  construction  of  the  trans-Sumatra  gas  pipeline  that  not \nonly  enhanced  domestic  use  of  natural  gas  but  also  established  an  important  segment  of  the \ntrans-ASEAN  gas  grid  promoting  regional  energy  cooperation.  An  important  policy  covenant \nunder  the  loan  required  the  conversion  of  PGN  from  a  state  corporation  to  a  limited  liability \ncompany and this conversion was completed in 1996. ADB also conducted extensive and high-\nlevel policy dialogue on the participation of the private sector and, as a result, PGN created a \nsubsidiary with a 40% private sector participation to own and operate the transmission system \ncomprising  the  Grissik\u2013Duri  line  completed  in  1998,  the  Grissik\u2013Sakernan\u2013Batam\u2013Singapore \npipelines  completed  in  2004  and  the  Batam  distribution  network  completed  in  2005.  ADB  has \nprovided  several  technical  assistance  (TA)  projects 6  to  support  the  establishment  of  the \nregulatory framework and restructuring of the gas sector, development of the gas sector master \nplan,  and  for  gas  distribution  and  use.  An  ongoing  TA  supports  the  development  of  the  least-\ncost option for gas supply to meet growing energy demand in Java.7 \n \n\n                                                 \n4 The  sector  coverage  of  IRP  includes:  transportation  (roads,  ports,  airports,  and  railways);  power;  oil  and  gas; \n\ntelecommunication; and water supply and sanitation. \n\n5   ADB.  1995.

Before 2005, ADB had \napproved  financial  assistance  for  16  projects  in  the  general  industry  and  financial  sectors \ntotaling  $197.5  million.  The  performance  of  some  of  these  projects,  particularly  in  the \nmanufacturing  sector,  was  less  than  satisfactory,  primarily  because  of  issues  of  sector  and \npartner  selection.  The  private  sector  portfolio  was  badly  affected  by  the  Asian  financial  crisis. \nBecause of concerns surrounding concession awards, infrastructure projects have rarely been \nthe \nconsidered  by  ADB.  However,  recently \nGovernment\u2019s  attitude  towards  business,  with  increasing  support  for  transparency  and \ngovernance.  To  support  the  Government  in  its  efforts,  ADB  proposes  to  revitalize  its  private \nsector operations to catalyze the return of private sector investments in infrastructure, especially \nin the energy and transport sectors. This process began with the approval in December 2005 of \na $350 million loan to the Tangguh LNG project,8 and this Project is seen as a continuation of \nthis process in line with the strategy.  \n \n\nthere  have  been  significant  changes \n\nin \n\nIV. \n\nTHE BORROWER \n\nA. \n\nBackground \n\nBackground  information  on  PGN  is  in  Appendix  3.  PGN  is  an  Indonesian  gas  utility \n18. \ninvolved  in  the  transmission,  distribution,  wholesaling,  and  retailing  of  natural  gas.  PGN  owns \nand  operates  four  transmission  pipelines  totaling  1,074  km  and  seven  distribution  networks \nserving  eight  cities  and  consisting  of  3,172  km  of  pipelines.  The  company\u2019s  main  business  is \nselling  natural  gas  to  industrial  customers,  and  PGN  is  the  dominant  gas  distributor  in \nIndonesia, accounting for more than 90% of gas sales by volume. Gas distribution accounted for \n79%  of  PGN\u2019s  revenues  in  2005.  PGN  also  receives  revenue  from  its  transmission  assets  by \ncharging  a  toll  fee  for  transportation  services  and  this  business  contributed  21%  of  revenues \nduring the same period. Following its IPO in December 2003 PGN is listed on the Jakarta and \nSurabaya stock exchanges. PGN is 61% owned by the Government. \n \n19. \nIn calendar year 2005 PGN\u2019s distribution business had gas sales volume of 303 mmscfd. \nPGN  sells  gas  primarily  to  industrial  customers  in  eight  urban  markets9 and  over  the  next  few \nyears the company plans to open gas distribution networks in four new urban markets.10 PGN \nestimates  that  its  current  core  customer  base  of  670  industrial  clients  requires  a  further  500 \nmmscfd of gas supply and that there are another 180 potential customers with a total potential \ndemand of 450 mmscfd. As of 1 June 2006, PGN had entered into preliminary agreements for \ngas sales with 309 of these potential customers.  \n \n20. \nPGN\u2019s  transmission  network  comprises  (i)  the  Grissik\u2013Duri  transmission  pipeline  in \nSumatra through which ConocoPhillips ships gas to Caltex under a long-term gas transportation \nagreement;  (ii)  the  Grissik\u2013Singapore  transmission  pipeline  through  which  PERTAMINA  ships \ngas  to  PowerGas  of  Singapore,  also  under  a  long-term  gas  transportation  agreement,  both  of \nwhich  are  owned  and  operated  through  PGN\u2019s  59.75%-owned  subsidiary,  Transgasindo;  and \n(iii)  two  small  transmission  operations  in  Medan  and  Jakarta  used  by  PERTAMINA  to  supply \ngas to power stations and CNG filling stations. The Grissik\u2013Duri, Grissik\u2013Singapore and Medan \ntransmission systems consist of 1074 km of pipelines with a combined capacity of 807 mmscfd, \nwhile  the  Jakarta  transmission  system  uses  the  existing  distribution  pipelines.  PGN\u2019s \n                                                 \n8  The loan to the Tangguh LNG project was ADB\u2019s first PSOD loan to Indonesia since 1994 and is also the largest \n\nsingle tranche loan by PSOD to date. \n\n9  Jakarta, Surabaya, Medan, Bogor, Cirebon, Palembang, Batam Island, and Pekanbaru \n10 Semarang, Banten, Lampung, and Jambi. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\ntransmission network transported an average of 676 mmscfd of natural gas in the first quarter of \n2006. \n \n21. \nPGN has begun building two pipelines between South Sumatra and West Java, phases I \nand  II  of the  South  Sumatra  to  West  Java  gas  pipeline  project,  and has  received  approval  for \nthe  construction  of  a  509  km  transmission  pipeline  from  Duri  to  Medan.  PGN  also  intends  to \ntender  for  the  right  to  develop  other  gas  transmission  pipeline  projects,  which  are  put  out  to \npublic  tender  by  BPH  Migas  as  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  master  plan  to  develop  Indonesia\u2019s \nintegrated gas transmission and distribution network.  \n \nB. \n\nCorporate Governance \n\nPGN\u2019s  management  team  comprises  a  five-member  board  of  directors  (BOD)  whose \n22. \nactivities are monitored by a six-member board of commissioners (BOC). All current members \nof  PGN\u2019s  BOD  and  BOC  have  extensive  experience  in  the  Indonesian  oil  and  gas  industry. \nMembers of PGN\u2019s BOD have long records of service with the company, ranging from 12 to 23 \nyears.  Members  of  PGN\u2019s  BOC  come  from  a  variety  of  backgrounds,  including  the  Ministry  of \nEnergy  and  Mineral  Resources,  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  PERTAMINA,  and  the  National \nDevelopment Planning Agency (Bapenas). \n \nIn December 2003, PGN listed its shares on the Jakarta and Surabaya stock exchanges \n23. \nin  an  IPO  that  reduced  the  Government\u2019s  shareholding  in  PGN  to  61%. 11  Although  the \nGovernment retains a special share and has the power to direct PGN activities, it has allowed \nthe company to operate as an independent, commercial entity. PGN\u2019s listing has subjected it to \ncompany law and other laws that apply to private sector companies. Listing has also meant that \nPGN\u2019s  commercial  performance  is  subject  to  monitoring  by  shareholders  other  than  the \nGovernment.  The  significant  rise  in  PGN\u2019s  share  price  since  the  IPO,  from  the  listing  price  of \nRp1,500 to Rp12,600 on 1 June 2006, may be seen as a reflection of market confidence and is \nto  a  large  extent  supported  by  PGN\u2019s  reputation  for  good  corporate  governance.  PGN  was \nawarded  the  top  performing  listed  company  2006  by  Investor,  a  local  business  magazine,  in \nApril 2006.  \n \nFollowing  its  listing  PGN  complies  with  the  Jakarta  Stock  Exchange  requirements \n24. \nregarding  financial  reporting,  which  stipulate  that  PGN  must  submit  its  (i)  audited  annual \nfinancial statements for the year ending December 31 by June 30 of the following year, and (ii) \nunaudited interim financial results for the first 6 months of the financial year by 31  August the \nsame  year.  PGN\u2019s  auditors  are  appointed  at  a  shareholders\u2019  meeting  each  year  and  are \nrequired to be one of the private audit firms licensed by the Ministry of Finance and accredited \nby  the  Indonesian  Capital  Markets  Supervisory  Agency  (Bapepam).  As  a  publicly  listed \ncompany,  PGN  is  also  subject  to  the  Bapepam  requirements  regarding  independent  board \nmembers  and  an  independent  audit  committee,  which  is  not  to  be  chaired  by  the  chair  of  the \nboard.  PGN  has  two  independent  commissioners  on  its  BOC  whose  task  is  to  monitor  the \noperations of the business on behalf of public investors. PGN has also formed an independent \naudit  committee,  chaired  by  one  of  the  independent  commissioners,  which  is  responsible  for \nreporting to the BOC on the financial condition of the company and business management and \nfor increasing the effectiveness of internal and external audit functions. \n\n                                                 \n11  ADB  has  been  involved  in  corporate  governance  and  privatization  reforms  through  the  SOE \nGovernance  and  Privatization  Program  between  1998  and  2005.  As  part  of  this  program,  PGN  has \nprepared  Statements  of  Corporate  Intent  outlining  its  corporate  vision  and  operational  plans  on  an \nannual basis. The Government has also included further privatization of PGN in its annual plans since \n2004. However, Parliamentary approval has not been obtained to date. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\n \n\n  \n\nPGN received an ISO 9001:2000 certificate from Lloyd\u2019s Register Quality Assurance in \n25. \n2003,  and  in  2005  PGN  recommitted  itself  to  implementing  good  corporate  governance \nprinciples  of  transparency,  independence,  accountability  and  fairness.  As  part  of  its  corporate \ngovernance  policy  PGN  requires  its  staff  to  adhere  to  its  standard  operating  procedures  for \nsafety  in  emergency  situations  for  transmission  and  distribution  pipelines;  operation  and \nmaintenance  of  distribution  pipelines;  and  pipeline  design  standards,  which  have  all  been \ndeveloped following international codes of practice. \n \nC. \n\nFinancial Performance \n\n26. \nA  review  of  financial  information  on  PGN  is  included  in  Appendix  4  and  key  financial \ninformation  is  summarized  in Table 2.  PGN  is  rated  by  the international  credit  rating  agencies \nMoody\u2019s  and  Standard  &  Poor\u2019s.  On  19  May  2006  PGN\u2019s  foreign  currency  debt  rating  was \nupgraded  from  B1  to  Ba3  by  Moody\u2019s.  PGN  is  therefore  rated  higher  than  the  Indonesian \nsovereign  rating  of  B1  by  Moody\u2019s.  Both  PGN  and  the  Indonesian  sovereign  are  rated  B+  by \nStandard and Poor\u2019s.  \n \n\nTable 2: Summary of PGN Financial Performance 2003-2005 \n(Rp billion) \n \n\n \n2005 \n \n\n \n2004 \n \n\n \n2003 \n \n          3,596  \n             627  \n          2,969  \n          1,278  \n             740  \n             510  \n          1,927  \n          9,127  \n          4,329 \n          5,865  \n          3,262  \n\n         4,458  \n            849 \n         3,609 \n         1,460  \n            683  \n            474  \n         3,347 \n       11,040  \n         6,174 \n         7,862  \n         3,178  \n\n            5,434  \n            1,153 \n            4,280 \n            2,204  \n            1,364  \n               862  \n            3,972 \n          12,575  \n            6,383 \n            8,376 \n            4,198  \n\nItem \n \nRevenue \n  Transmission \n  Distribution \nEBITDA \nPretax Profit \nNet Profit \nCash and Equivalents  \nTotal Assets \nTotal Debt \nTotal Liabilities \nShareholders' Equity \nCurrent Ratio (Current Assets Divided \nby Current Liabilities) \nEBITDA Margin (%) \nNet Margin (%) \nDebt to Equity (Debt Percentage) (%) \nDebt Service Coverage Ratio \u2013 \nEBITDA Divided by Total Debt Service \n(times) \nDebt Divided by EBITDA \n \nEBITDA = earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization  \nSource: PGN Consolidated Financial Statements with Independent Auditors\u2019 Report 2003\u20132005. \n \n27. \nIn 2005, PGN generated total revenues of Rp5.4 trillion (equivalent to $584 million), 79% \nfrom  distribution  and  21%  from  transmission.  Pre-tax  income  in  2005  was  Rp1.4  trillion \n(equivalent to $147 million), which represented a 100% increase compared with the prior year. \nPGN had strong cash flow from operating activities of Rp1.6 trillion (equivalent to $172 million) \nin 2005.

The company\u2019s unrestricted cash position remained healthy at the end \nof 2005 at Rp4 trillion (equivalent to $427 million). PGN\u2019s total borrowings as at 31 December \n2005 were Rp6.4 trillion (equivalent to $686 million), including loans owed to the Government of \nRp2.9  trillion  (equivalent  to  $315  million)  and  amounts  due  under  the  two  Eurobond  issues \ntotaling Rp2.6 trillion (equivalent to $282 million). The loans due to Government were funded by \nJapan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation,  European  Investment  Bank,  World  Bank  and  ADB. \nThe Eurobonds, which were issued in 2003 and 2004, have a 10-year final maturity with a put \noption  after 7  years  and  are  unsecured.  An  analysis  of  PGN\u2019s  borrowings  as  at  31  December \n2005  shows  that  (i)  most  of  the  borrowings  were  long-term  (only  5.3%  of  total  debts  were \nrepayable within 12 months) and (ii) the company\u2019s total debt\u2013equity ratio was 60:40, which is \ncomfortably  inside  the  level  covenanted  to  ADB  under  the  existing  loan  agreement  of  70:30. \nPGN\u2019s total equity at the end of 2005 was Rp4.2 trillion (equivalent to $451 million). As of 1 June \n2006, the company\u2019s stock market capitalization was Rp57 trillion (equivalent to $6.1 billion). \n \nD. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nSOE Lending under IEI Pilot Financing Instruments \n\n \n28. \nAs outlined in ADB\u2019s Innovation and Efficiency Initiative: Pilot Financing Instruments and \nModalities  paper12,  there  are  numerous  SOEs  that  are  creditworthy  and  have  the  long-term \nfinancial viability to borrow without government guarantees. They constitute a \u201cthird generation\u201d \nof  potential  clients,  increasingly  important  as  borrowers  separate  from  the  sovereign.  These \nentities  play  an  important  role  in  creating  jobs  and  providing  infrastructure  and  basic  public \nservices.  Giving  them  access  to  affordable  long-term  credit  is  critical  to  promoting  economic \ngrowth. Starting in 2003, PGN has borrowed from the international debt capital markets without \nGovernment  assistance.  ADB\u2019s  objective  in  processing  this  transaction  is  to  lend,  and  to \nfacilitate  further  lending  through  cofinancing,  in  each  case  without  government  guarantee  to \nPGN so as to ensure that environmentally friendly indigenous energy can be delivered to West \nJava on an economic basis.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSupporting the Sector Reform Program \n\n29. \nAs  indicated  in  the  IEI  Board  paper,  ADB  lending  to  SOEs  should  be  accompanied  by \ncorporate/sector  reforms.  ADB  has  played  a  significant  role  in  developing  the  regulatory \ncapacity  for  the  oil  and  gas  sector  and  the  Government  is  now  fundamentally  reforming  the \nsector  pursuant  to  the  new  oil  and  gas  law.  In  particular,  the  Government  has  initiated  the \nunbundling  of  the  sector  into  its  upstream  and  downstream  components  and  has  mandated  a \nclear  separation  of  the  regulatory  function  from  business  entities.  New  regulators  have  been \nestablished for the upstream and downstream subsectors, and competition has been introduced \nby, for example, calling for tenders for the development and construction of pipelines that form \npart of the natural gas master plan developed by BPH Migas and by removing PERTAMINA\u2019s \ndownstream  monopoly.  To  complement  its  various  sector  reforms  the  Government  has  asked \nthat  ADB  consider  increasing  its  non-sovereign  guaranteed  lending  to  eligible  borrowers \nespecially  in  the  infrastructure  sector  and  the  proposed  loan  to  PGN  is  responsive  to  this \nrequest.  \n \n\n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2005. Innovation and Efficiency Initiative: Pilot Financing Instruments and Modalities. Manila \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\n \n\n  \n\n3. \n\nSupporting PGN\u2019s development \n\n30. \nAs  noted  above,  PGN  is  a  long-standing  borrower  from  ADB  and  an  important  policy \ncovenant under ADB\u2019s previous loan required the conversion of PGN from a state corporation to \na  limited  liability  company.  This  conversion  was  completed  in  1996.  In  addition,  PGN  has \nundertaken  numerous  corporate  governance  reforms  to  improve  performance,  transparency, \nand efficiency, leading to its partial privatization via IPO in late 2003. PGN is now 61%-owned \nby  the  Government.  Subsequent  to  its  IPO,  PGN  has  issued  debt  in  the  international  debt \ncapital  markets  with  a  10-year  maturity  on  an  unsecured  basis  and  without  government \nguarantee.  As  a  publicly  listed  company  with  debt  ratings  from  the  international  credit  rating \nagencies PGN is now subject to substantial scrutiny and market discipline and can be regarded \nas having successfully graduated from being an SOE to being a company that is governed and \nmanaged with a high degree of autonomy and which operates on a fully commercial basis. It is \nanticipated  that  any  future  ADB  support  to  PGN  will  be  provided  without  a  Government \nguarantee, either  on  a corporate  or  on  a  project  finance  basis.  PGN  is seen  as  a  governance \nmodel  for  SOEs  and  may  be  regarded  as  a  successful  model  for  the  reform  and \ncommercialization of SOEs.  \n \n\nV. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Description \n\n31. \nThe Project consists of the construction of 661 km of gas pipeline for the transportation \nof natural gas from major gas fields in South Sumatra to the major gas-consuming markets of \nWest  Java.  The  pipeline  will  be  constructed  in  four  linked  sections  between  Grissik  in  South \nSumatra  and  Rawa  Maju  in  West  Java.  Section  1  of  the  pipeline  will  comprise  196  km  of  36-\ninch-diameter pipeline running from the Corridor Block gas field operated by ConocoPhillips at \nGrissik  in  South  Sumatra  to  Pagardewa,  also  in  South  Sumatra.  Sections  2,  3,  and  4  of  the \npipeline will comprise linked 32-inch-diameter pipelines running (i) 270 km from Pagardewa to \nthe coast of South Sumatra at Labuhan Maringgai; (ii) 161 km offshore beneath the Java Sea \nfrom Labuhan Maringgai to the coast of West Java at Muara Bekasi, and (iii) 34 km from Muara \nBekasi  to  Rawa  Maju  in  West  Java.  Section  2  of  the  Project  will  follow  the  same  alignment \nbetween Pagardewa and Labuhan Maringgai as the South Sumatra to West Java phase I gas \npipeline project under construction by PGN using  official development aid funding provided by \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC).  \n \nThe  Project  is  the  second  component  of  an  overall  PGN  transmission  pipeline  system \n32. \nexpansion designed to address a shortage of natural gas in West Java through the linkage of \ngas supply sources in South Sumatra with West Java. The Project has been designed with the \ncapacity to transport 460 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd) of natural gas from the \nCorridor  Block  operated  by  ConocoPhillips.  Gas  users  will  be  primarily  industrial  customers \nlocated  in  West  Java.  The  construction  of  the  Project  will  make  available  much-needed  gas \nsupply  for  PGN\u2019s  West  Java  distribution  business,  which  in  recent  years  has  been  operating \nsubstantially below capacity because of insufficient supplies of gas. \n \n33. \nIn parallel with the implementation of the Project, PGN is investing in its West Java gas \ndistribution  network  in  Greater  Jakarta  and  the  Banten  area  (funded  by  World  Bank),  the \nCilegon  area  (funded  by  JBIC)  and  in  the  Rawa  Maju  area  (funded  from  internal  resources). \nFrom  2005  to  2008,  PGN  plans  to  invest  over  $200  million  in  its  West  Java  gas  distribution \nnetwork. \n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nB. \n\nKey Implementation Arrangements  \n\n1. \n\nDesign and Land Acquisition \n\nThe  pipeline  design  has  been  completed.  The  design  of  the  pipeline  as  well  as  its \n34. \nsupporting  facilities  has  been  carried  out  in  accordance  with  international  as  well  as  national \nstandards. 13  The  pipeline  will  be  coated  externally  for  corrosion  prevention  and  has  been \ndesigned  for  an  operational  period  of  at  least  20  years.  With  respect  to  project  design,  the \nlenders\u2019 technical consultant14 has concluded that the pipeline facilities in the Project are typical \nof  that  expected  in  projects  of  this  nature.  As  of  May  2006,  PGN  had  acquired  about  85%  of \nland  for  the  pipeline  corridor  and  PGN  expects  to  complete  the  land  acquisition  by  October \n2006. \n \n\n2. \n\nContracting Strategy and Costs \n\n35. \nAn  overview  of  the  construction  contracts  awarded  for  construction  of  the  Project  is  in \nAppendix  5.  For  the  purposes  of  construction,  the  Project  has  been  divided  into  17  contract \npackages, all of which have been awarded on a fixed-price basis. PGN has advised that there \nhave been no variation orders issued under any of the contracts and that the company expects \nthe Project to be completed within the original budget and that the physical contingency will not \nbe used.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nThe  lenders\u2019  technical  consultant  has  reviewed  the  procurement  arrangements  for  the \n36. \nProject and has concluded that PGN has used a well-established transparent and competitive \ntendering process. In particular, to ensure transparency the tender opening process is a public \nevent and PGN allows unsuccessful bidders to lodge objections.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConstruction Progress and Schedule \n\n37. \nAs of the end of April 2006, construction of the Project was 42% complete and PGN was \nworking toward the following milestone dates for the Project: (i) 1 November 2006: gas turn on \nfrom PERTAMINA at the receiving station at Pagardewa, South Sumatra, and delivery to Rawa \nMaju in West Java; and (ii) 1 February 2007: completion of the Grissik\u2013Pagardewa section and \nconnection  with  the  ConocoPhillips  gas  supply.  As  of  May  2006,  the  onshore  construction \ncontractor for the Pagardewa to Labuhan Maringgai section of the Project was about 5 weeks \nbehind  schedule  because  of  inclement  weather  in  early  2006.  The  contractor  has submitted  a \nrecovery  plan  which  would  allow  completion  to  occur  by  1  November  2006,  and  the  lenders\u2019 \ntechnical consultant has advised that this plan is ambitious but may be achievable under ideal \nweather  conditions.  PGN  receives  monthly  progress  reports  on  construction  progress  from  its \ncontractors and the lenders will discuss with PGN the possibility of these being made available \nto lenders.  \n\n                                                 \n13  International standards refer to the (i) American Petroleum Institute, (ii) American Society for Testing Material, (iii) \nAmerican Standard for Mechanical Engineering (ASME) (ASME B-31.8 Gas Transmission and Distribution Piping \nSystems,  ASME  Boiler  and  Pressure  Vessel  Code),  and  (iv)  Det  Norske  Veritas  (DNV-OS-F101  and  DNV  2000 \n[Submarine Pipeline Systems]). National standards refer to SNI (Standar Nasional Indonesia or National Standard \nof  Indonesia)  13-3474-2002  and  Decree  of  the  Minister  for  Mining  and  Energy  of  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  no. \n300.K/38/MPE/1997 on Safety for Natural Gas Transmission Pipeline. \n\n14  As  part  of  the  due  diligence  process,  ADB  and  ING  appointed  a  consortium  led  by  Schlumberger  Business \nConsulting  and  including  JP  Kenny,  ERM  and  other  divisions  of  Schlumberger  to  conduct  a  review  of  PGN  that \nencompassed market, commercial, supply, regulatory, design, construction, environmental, health and safety, and \nsocial and stakeholder issues. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\n \n\n  \n\n5. \n\nConstruction Management and Operations \n\n38. \nPGN  is  responsible  for  overall  management  of  the  Project,  including  construction \nmanagement and operation and maintenance of the pipeline. For the construction phase, PGN \nhas awarded two construction management contracts, one for the onshore portion of the works \nand  one  for  the  offshore  portion.  For  the  operations  phase,  PGN  will  create  an  operation  and \nmaintenance \nfrom  Transgasindo,  who  have \nexperience  of  operating  PGN\u2019s  existing  Grissik\u2013Singpore  and  Batam\u2013Grissik\u2013Duri  pipelines. \nPGN\u2019s  pipeline  operations  and  maintenance  procedures  are  designed  to  international \nstandards.15 The lenders\u2019 technical consultant has concluded that PGN\u2019s existing operation and \nmaintenance procedures are comprehensive and practical.  \n \n\nteam  comprising  staff  members  selected \n\n6. \n\nGas Supply Agreements \n\n39. \nPGN has signed two anchor gas supply contracts for gas supply from South Sumatra to \nWest Java. The first was signed in June 2003 with PERTAMINA for the supply of at least 1 tcf of \ngas over 12 years. Gas deliveries are scheduled begin in the last quarter 2006 at a rate of 150 \nmmscfd, will reach a plateau of 250 mmscfd from 2008 to 2017, and thereafter will be subject to \nactual availability and deliverability of the field. The second major agreement for the supply of \ngas from South Sumatra was signed in August 2004 with ConocoPhillips and is for the supply of \n2.3 tcf of gas over 17 years. Gas deliveries will begin in the first quarter 2007 at a rate of 175 \nmmscfd  and  will  rise  to  412  mmscfd  from  2012  until  contract  termination  in  2023.  The  gas \npurchase price under the contract is fixed for the full tenor of the contract.  \n \n\n7. \n\nGas Sales Arrangements \n\n40. \nIndustrial  customers  accounted  for  98%  of  PGN\u2019s  sales  in  2005.  PGN\u2019s  industrial \ncustomers typically sign 3-year gas purchase contracts. Key industrial sectors include glass and \nceramics, chemicals, and paper, which together accounted for 62% of total gas sales in 2005. \nThe typical profile of PGN\u2019s largest customers are domestic export-oriented manufacturers and \nIndonesian subsidiaries of international companies. Given current oil prices, there is substantial \nfinancial  benefit  to  consumers  in  switching  to  gas  from  oil-based  fuels.  The  lenders\u2019  technical \nconsultant  has  concluded  that  there  is  likely  to  be  sufficient  demand  for  all  of  the  gas \ntransported by the Project and that PGN\u2019s sales volumes are more likely to be constrained by \nthe availability of gas supplies than by a shortfall in demand by end users.  \n \nC. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment \n\nThe  Project  has  been  classified  under  environmental  category  B.  A  summary  of  the \n41. \ninitial environmental examination for the Project is included as Appendix 6. The proposed 466 \nkm Project pipeline corridor in South Sumatra traverses through agricultural land, degraded and \nfragmented forests, rural settlements, and roads. The terrain is mostly low-lying plains. The 34 \nkm  pipeline  corridor  between  Muara  Bekasi  and  Rawa  Maju  in  West  Java  passes  through \nterrain similar to that of South Sumatra. The mangrove on the coast around Labuhan Maringgai \nand  Muara  Bekasi  is  either  fragmented  or  used  for  fishponds,  which  is  no  longer \nenvironmentally sensitive. Despite the fact that the Project will not pass through environmentally \nsensitive areas, PGN is committed to rehabilitate and improve the ecosystem in an area of 1 ha \nof  lost  mangrove  habitat  at  the  coastlines  at  Labuhan  Maringgai  and  Muara  Bekasi,  the  two \n\n                                                 \n15  ASME B-31.8 - Gas Transmission and Distribution Piping Systems. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\npoints  where  the  pipeline  meets  the  sea.16 The  offshore  pipeline  alignment  avoids  the  coral \nreefs around the Seribu Islands. The sea around Labuhan Maringgai and Muara Bekasi has no \ncoral reef or marine mammals of ecological importance.  \n \nDuring  construction,  the  Project  will  create  transient  disturbances  to  environmental \n42. \nquality.  However,  the  disturbances  common  to  all  civil  work  construction  would  not  create \nsignificant impacts considering the short construction period over a section of the corridor before \nthe construction progresses to other sections of the narrow construction area. The construction \nwill  not  have  significant  impacts  on  wildlife  and  forest.  The  corridor  will  be  covered  with  grass \nand  shallow-root  vegetation  to  minimize  soil  erosion.  During  operation,  the  pipeline  will  not \npollute  the  environment  as  it  does  not  generate  wastes.  The  only  issues  of  note  will  be  noise \nand  safety.  To  ensure  system  performance  and  integrity,  a  supervisory  control  and  data \nacquisition  system  will  be  installed  to  manage  the  operations  of  the  pipeline,  including  leak \ndetection.  An  information-sharing  and  education  program  for  communities  near  the  onshore \npipeline routes will also be developed to prepare the communities for emergency response and \nevacuation in the event of accidents.  \n \n43. \nPGN  has  prepared  an  environmental  management  plan,  which  contains  mitigation \nmeasures  for  all  identified  major  impacts,  and  monitoring  activities  to  be  carried  out  during \nconstruction  and  operation.  PGN  has \nincorporated  within  each  construction  contract \nenvironmental management requirements to be complied with by the contractors.  \n \n44. \nThe Project will create environmental benefits by replacing more polluting fuels such as \nhigh speed diesel and coal, with natural gas. Based on the estimates of natural gas use, the net \npresent  value  of  the  environmental  benefits  is  estimated  at  about  $74.52  million  for  the \noperating life of 20 years and a discount rate of 8% per annum.  \n \n45. \nAll  environmental  plans  relating  to  the  Project  have  been  scrutinized  by  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental  specialists  and  the  lenders\u2019  technical  consultant  and  have  been  found  to  be \nsatisfactory.  \n \n\n2. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement, Indigenous Peoples  \n\n \n\n46. \nThe Project has been classified under involuntary resettlement category A and a full land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  plan  (LARP)  has  been  prepared.  A  summary  of  the  LARP  is \nincluded as Appendix 7. The onshore pipeline alignment was selected because it minimizes the \nnumber of structures and persons affected. In South Sumatra and Lampung provinces, PGN is \nacquiring 1,137.76 ha of land for the Project including 951.42 ha of privately owned land. In all, \n4,791  land  parcels  belonging  to  4,315  users  (both  legal  owners  and  non-titled  users)  are \naffected. The land acquired is mainly agricultural land such as rice fields, traditional plantations, \ndrylands, and arable homesteads. A total of 28 structures in South Sumatra and 12 in Lampung \nwith an average area of 50.5 m2 are also affected. The structures affected are semi-permanent \nwooden houses, huts, and farm field shelters. No community structures and common property \nresources  nor  social  facility  structures  are  directly  affected  by  the  Project.  Since  all  affected \npersons in South Sumatra and Lampung have opted for cash compensation, no resettlement is \nrequired.  Land  used  for  the  Project  in  West  Java  will  be  leased  from  Perum  Jasa  Tirta  II  and \nruns adjacent to an existing drainage canal.

The Project will also decrease imports of oil and petroleum products \nthereby  increasing  energy  self-sufficiency  and  insulating  energy  consumers  from  any  sharp \nincrease  in  fuel  prices  that  would  result  from  future  subsidy  reductions.  The  proposed  ADB \nassistance will also further the aim of graduating PGN from a Government-guaranteed borrower \nto  a  stand-alone  borrower  and  will  support  PGN  as  a  model  of  SOE  reform  and \ncommercialization in Indonesia.  \n \nE. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n50. \nThe Project\u2019s total investment cost is estimated at $652.5 million, which includes the cost \nof  land  acquisition,  the  cost  of  the  17  fixed-price  contract  packages  that  have  been  awarded, \nand an allowance for physical contingencies.

The loan will have a 15-year term including a grace period of 3 years. \nIn addition, ADB has been asked to provide two complementary loans: (i) up to $75 million to be \nfunded  by  one  or  more  international  commercial  banks  under  ADB\u2019s  CFS,  and  (ii)  up  to  $50 \nmillion to be funded by KfW under ADB\u2019s CFS.  \n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\n \n\n  \n\nIn its role as lead arranger of the financing for PGN, ADB has introduced the Project to \n53. \nthe Islamic Development Bank (IDB), which is expected to provide a direct loan to PGN of up to \n$75  million  with  a  term  of  up  to  15  years.  The  balance  of  the  funding  required  for  the \nimplementation of the Project will come from PGN\u2019s own resources, which include proceeds of \nthe company\u2019s IPO in December 2003, two bond issues carried out in 2003 and 2004 and cash \nflow generated from operations. As of 31 December 2005, PGN had cash and cash equivalents \n(including  restricted  cash)  of  Rp4.15  trillion  (equivalent  to  $445  million)  and  therefore  is  in  a \nposition to fund its portion of the Project cost with relative ease. \n \n \n\nVI. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nADB Loans \n\n1. \n\nNature and Amount \n\n54. \n \n\n(i) \n\nThe proposed ADB assistance to PGN will comprise three loans: \n\nA  direct  loan  of  up  to  $75  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  an \namortization  period  of  15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  and \nsemiannual  repayments.  Interest  will  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility  and  PGN  will \nconsider  the  option  of  either  a  floating  or  a  fixed  interest  rate.  Front-end  fees, \ncommitment  fees,  and  the  interest  margin  will  be  determined  by  ADB\u2019s  Interest \nRate Committee; \nA  complementary  loan  of  up  to  $75  million  to  be  funded  by  one  or  more \ninternational  commercial  banks  under  ADB\u2019s  CFS,  with  a  term  of  6  years, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  1.5  years,  with  interest  at  LIBOR  plus  an  agreed \nmargin.  ADB  will  charge  an  arrangement  fee  as  a  percentage  of  the  CFS  loan \nand also an annual administration fee in line with ADB policy; and \nA  complementary  loan  of  up  to  $50  million  to  be  funded  by  KfW  under  ADB\u2019s \nCFS, with a term of 12 years, including a grace period of 3 years, with interest at \nLIBOR  plus  an  agreed  margin.  ADB  will  charge  an  arrangement  fee  as  a \npercentage  of  the  CFS  loan  and  also  an  annual  administration  fee  in  line  with \nADB policy.  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n2. \n\nMain Terms and Conditions \n\n55. \nThe  proposed  direct  and  CFS  loans  will  each  be  documented  in  a  loan  agreement, \nwhich will contain standard terms and conditions that apply to loans to private sector borrowers \nwithout government guarantees and CFS, respectively. ADB will also enter into the following: (i) \na participation agreement with the participating cofinancing banks, and (ii) related and ancillary \ndocumentation. The proposed loans are structured as a corporate finance transaction and since \nPGN has no secured obligations the loans will have recourse to all the assets of PGN. During \nthe  tenor  of  the  loan,  PGN  will  be  bound  by  financial  and  operational  covenants  as  well  as \ncovenants related to ADB\u2019s policies pursuant to the ADB loan agreement.18  \n \n\n                                                 \n18 These  covenants  include  (i)  compliance  with  ADB's  environmental  and  social  safeguard  policies;  (ii)  compliance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  anti-money  laundering,  anti-terrorism,  and  anti-fraud  policies;  (iii)  the  maintenance  of  adequate  debt \nservice coverage ratio and debt to equity ratio; and (iv) negative pledge on PGN's existing assets. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\n56. \n \n\nB. \n\nJustification for ADB Assistance \n\nThe Project merits ADB\u2019s support for the following reasons: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nThe  Project  helps  achieve  the  Government\u2019s  objective  of  increasing  the \nproportion  of  indigenous  natural  gas  in  the  domestic  energy  mix  by  substituting \nexpensive  and  polluting  oil  products  with  more  economic  and  environmentally \nfriendly natural gas. \nThe substitution of oil products with natural gas will reduce the requirement for oil \nimports, thus increasing Indonesia\u2019s energy self-reliance. \nThe Project will reduce the burden of oil subsidies on the national budget when \noil prices are high. \nThe Project will encourage growth in economic activity in West Java. \nThe  financing  is  responsive  to  MOF\u2019s  request  to  ADB  to  lend  to  PGN  without \nsovereign  guarantees,  thereby  furthering  the  objective  of  graduating  PGN  from \nsovereign guaranteed borrowing. \nIf PGN opts for fixed-rate financing, then the financing will provide PGN access to \nfixed-rate  financing  over  longer  tenors  than  may  be  available  from  commercial \nsources. \nThe  financing  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  of  supporting  mixed  (i.e.,  joint \nprivate  and  public  sector)  enterprises  or  commercially  run  state-owned \nenterprises  with  management  autonomy  and  high  standards  of  corporate \ngovernance under its IEI policy.  \n\n(viii)  The Project is consistent with the ADB energy policy19 and its promotion of clean \nenergy  and  also  with  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  for  Indonesia,  which \nemphasizes  infrastructure  development,  environment  and  natural  resources \nmanagement, and the encouragement of private sector participation.   \n\n \nC. \n\nPercentage Investment \n\n57. \nThe  proposed  loan,  which  is  ADB\u2019s  first  assistance  to  PGN  without  a  Government \nguarantee  since  it  was  partially  privatized  will,  if  approved  by  the  Board,  represent  4.16%  of \nADB\u2019s  non-sovereign  exposure.  ADB\u2019s  non-sovereign  exposure  to  Indonesia  will  be  5.05%  of \nADB\u2019s aggregate non-sovereign exposure. ADB\u2019s non-sovereign exposure to transmission and \ndistribution will rise to 7.87% of ADB\u2019s aggregate non-sovereign exposure. \n \nD. \n\nAnticorruption Policy, Combating Money Laundering, and Financing of Terrorism  \n\n58. \nAs  a  publicly  listed  company,  PGN  is  subject  to  monitoring  by  Bapepam  and  by \ninstitutional  and  individual  shareholders.  PGN  must  also  comply  with  the  financial  reporting \nrequirements of the Jakarta Stock Exchange, which require the company\u2019s financial reports to \nbe audited by licensed independent auditors, and is closely monitored by the international credit \nrating  agencies  in  connection  with  its  international  public  market  debt  issuance.  The  lenders\u2019 \ntechnical consultant has reviewed PGN\u2019s procurement processes for the Project and has found \nthat  PGN\u2019s  procurement  processes  are  well  established  and  transparent.  Tenders  are  well \nadvertised, with appropriate oversight to reduce the risk of collusion. Safeguards are included in \nthe procurement process such as formal prequalification or technical prequalification of bidders. \nPGN also ensures that tender opening is a public event, allows unsuccessful bidders to lodge \nobjections, and will declare a tender void in the case of an insufficient number of bidders. PGN \nhas systems in place to ensure that project-related documents are properly filed and is setting \n\n                                                 \n19  ADB. 2000.

Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require PGN to institute, maintain, and \ncomply with internal procedures and controls following international best practice standards for \nthe  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money  laundering  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and \ncovenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. The loan documentation between \nADB and PGN will further allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these \nundertakings.  \n \nE. \n\nAssurances \n\n60. \nA framework agreement relating to ADB\u2019s status, privileges, and immunities with respect \nto  its  equity  investments  and  lending  operations  in  the  private  sector  is  in  effect  between  the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development \nBank,  the  Government  will  be  requested  to  confirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed \nassistance  to  PGN.  No  funding  will  be  disbursed  until  ADB  receives  such  confirmation.  In \naddition  no  funding  will  be  disbursed  until  PGN  has  completed  to  ADB\u2019s  satisfaction  the \nrequirements in relation to land acquisition and resettlement set out in paragraph 48 above.  \n \n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n61. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove  \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nthe loan of up to $75,000,000 to PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) Tbk for \nthe  South  Sumatra  to  West  Java  Phase  II  Gas  Pipeline  Project  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a term of 15 years, including a grace period \nof  3  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  this  report  and  as  may  be  reported  to  the \nBoard;  \n\nthe  complementary  loan  of  up  to  $75,000,000  to  PT  Perusahaan  Gas  Negara \n(Persero)  Tbk,  to  be  funded  by  one  or  more  international  commercial  banks \nunder ADB\u2019s complementary financing scheme, with a term of 6 years, including \na grace period of 1.5 years, with interest at LIBOR plus an agreed margin, and \non such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board; and \n\nthe  complementary  loan  of  up  to  $50,000,000  to  PT  Perusahaan  Gas  Negara \n(Persero)  Tbk,  to  be  funded  by  KfW  under  ADB\u2019s  complementary  financing \nscheme, with a term of 12 years including a grace period of 3 years, with interest \nat LIBOR plus an agreed margin, and on such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  this  report,  and  as  may  be \nreported to the Board.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n19 July 2006 \n\n \nLiqun Jin \nVice President \n\n \n\n\f \n \n \nStatistics/yearbook from: \n \n   a.

Foreign  companies  have  an  active  history  in  the  exploration \nand  production  of  oil  and  gas  in  Indonesia.  However,  of  late  there  has  been  limited  new \ninvestment in exploration and production activities.  \n \nThe country is well endowed with energy resources and has significant reserves of oil, \n2. \nnatural gas and coal. It has 94.7 trillion cubic feet (ft3) of \u201cproven\u201d natural gas reserves (Table \nA2.1),  the  13th  largest  in  the  world  and  the  largest  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  The  proven  gas \nreserves are three times Indonesia\u2019s oil reserves in energy equivalent terms, and can supply the \ncountry  for  35  years  at  current  production  rates.  If  the  \u201cpossible\u201d  gas  reserves  are  included, \nfuture  supply  could  be  longer  than  50  years.  However,  not  all  of  these  reserves  are \ncommercially  viable  and  not  all  of  their  gas  is  exportable,  due  to  gas  quality  and  distance  to \nmarket. \n  \n\nTable A2.1: Energy Reserves \n(2004) \n \n\nEnergy Type \n\n \n\nUnits \n\nQuantity\n\n \nOil \nGas \nCoal \n   Anthracite \n   Sub-bituminous and Lignite \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nBillion barrels \nTrillion cubic feet \nMillion tonnes \nMillion tonnes \nMillion tonnes \n \n\n   Source: BP Energy Statistics 2005, Migas. \n \n\nReserves/ \nProduction Ratio\n \n11.5 \n34.9 \n38.0 \n \n \n \n\n \n4.72 \n94.7 \n4968 \n740 \n4228 \n \n\n3. \nA majority of Indonesia\u2019s natural gas is produced for the manufacture of LNG, which is \ncurrently exported to Japan, Korea and Taiwan. Due to the decline in natural gas production in \nArun,  natural  gas  and  LNG  production  have  declined.  However,  new  LNG  projects  are  under \ndevelopment,  including  the  BP-operated  Tangguh  LNG  project  in  Irian  Jaya,  as  well  as  the \nPertamina  led  Donggi  LNG  project  in  Sulawesi.  Natural  gas  is  also  exported  via  pipelines  to \nSingapore  from  the  Natuna  gas  fields,  and  from  Sumatra  through  the  Grissik  to  Singapore \npipeline financed by ADB. \n \n4. \nEnergy  consumption  in  Indonesia  is  dominated  by  oil  and  gas,  which  account  for  80 \npercent of the total energy (Table 2). Since 2000, the domestic oil production has declined, due \nto natural maturation of producing fields combined with a slower reserve replacement rate. The \nconsumption of oil and oil products has increasing steadily. As a result in 2004, Indonesian oil \nproduction and consumption was just about even, and in 2005 Indonesia became a net importer \nof oil.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n  \n\n21\n\n \n\nTable A2.2: Share of Different Energy Sources \n(% share) \n\n \nEnergy Source \n \n \nCrude Oil and Oil Fuels  \nCoal  \nNatural Gas, LPG, and \nLNG  \nHydropower  \nGeothermal \n \n\n1990  1995  2000  2001  2002  2003 \n\n \n60.13 53.36 57.79 53.34 53.35  54.28 \n6.53 10.18 13.80 14.32  14.25 \n29.44 44.62 27.64 27.98 28.05  26.46 \n\n5.60\n\n \n\n4.38\n0.44\n\n3.82\n0.61\n\n3.22\n1.18\n\n3.48\n1.40\n\n2.87 \n1.40 \n \n\n3.58 \n1.44 \n \n\nLNG = liquefied natural gas, LPG = liquid petroleum gas. \nSource: Government of Indonesia. \n\n \n5. \nAlthough Indonesia is the world\u2019s sixth largest natural gas producer and supplies about a \nquarter of the world\u2019s LNG from its fields in Aceh and Kalimantan, until  recently the abundance \nof cheap oil limited the domestic use of natural gas.  Moreover, lack of clarity regarding the legal \nand  regulatory  environment  and  poor  incentives  in  terms  of  return  on  investment  hampered \nexpansion  in  current  production  sharing  contracts  and  new  gas  field  exploration. 1 Share  of \nnatural  gas  in  the  domestic  energy  mix  has  remained  below  30%  due  to  an  inadequate  gas \nsupply infrastructure. Several recent developments have set the stage for natural gas playing a \nmuch  more  important  role.  First,  Indonesia  has  been  on  the  verge  of  becoming  a  net  oil \nimporter.  Second,  the  fuel  subsidy  reductions  in  March  and  October  2005  have  made  natural \ngas competitive. Third, the legal and regulatory framework has been strengthened. As a result, \nprivate  investors  are  poised  to  develop  new  large  gas  fields,  and  PLN  is  keen  to  substantially \nincrease  the  share  of  natural  gas  in  its  generation  mix.  The  main  market  for  energy  is  in  the \nisland of Java which has fewer gas reserves than Kalimantan, Irian Jaya, and Sumatra, and is \ndependent  on  natural  gas  from  these  islands.  Major  pipeline  projects  and/or  LNG  terminals \nneed to be implemented to bring natural gas to the Java market.  \n \nIndonesia\u2019s natural gas production reached 73,300 million m3 in 2004, 8th largest in the \n6. \nworld  and  largest  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  The  country\u2019s  gas  exports  have  grown  60-fold  from \n661 million m3 in 1977, when LNG exports started, to 39,600 million m3 in 2004. Natural gas is a \nlarge revenue generator for the country. Indonesia\u2019s natural gas exports have traditionally been \nin the form of LNG. Indonesia presently is the largest LNG producer in the world with nearly a \n20%  market  share.  LNG  exports  are  the  country\u2019s  main  energy  export,  and  thus  a  principle \nsource  of  revenue.  LNG  exports  averaged  9.5%  of  the  country\u2019s  total  exports  during  1998\u2013\n2004. During the same period, the contribution of LNG to the country\u2019s gross domestic product \naveraged  3.5%.  Since  1998  the  share  of  LNG  has  declined  and  domestic  consumption  of \nnatural  gas  has  increased.  This  rate  of  growth  in  consumption  is  expected  to  increase  further \nwith  the  Government\u2019s  decree  prioritizing  the  domestic  use  of  indigenous  fuels  to  reduce \ndependence on the volatile international oil market. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Gas contracts signed before 1971 still account for almost 60% of Indonesia\u2019s commercial reserves, and large gas \n\nfields have remained unexplored. \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nF. \n\nSector Regulations \n\n7. \nAs part of a wider program for deregulation, the Government announced reforms in the \noil and gas and in November 2001 a new oil and gas law providing a new framework for the oil \nand gas industry: Law of the Republic of Indonesia (Number 22 of 2001) Concerning Natural Oil \nand Gas (the new oil and gas law) was approved. It recognizes the importance of a certain and \ntransparent  legal  environment  in  which  to  conduct  business  activities,  and  contemplates  the \nestablishment  of  upstream  and  downstream  environments  with  an  appropriate  regulatory \nframework  for  each.  Though  similar  in  its  philosophy  to  the  annulled  Electricity  Law  No. \n20/2002, the Oil and Gas Law No. 22/2001 was upheld by the Constitutional Court in December \n2005, except for provisions related to domestic market obligation, and oil and gas pricing. The \nConstitutional  Court  ruled  that  a  minimum  allocation  for  the  domestic  market  should  be \nstipulated  for  oil  and  gas  producers,  and  that  gas  prices  should  be  set  administratively  rather \nthan being determined by competition. \n  \n8. \nTo  execute  the  new  oil  and  gas  law  the  Government  has  prepared  a  series  of \nimplementing regulations and established regulatory bodies. The upstream regulator, BP Migas \ncontrols  upstream  activities  on  behalf  of  the  Government  through  cooperation  contracts  with \nentities undertaking exploration and exploitation of oil and gas in Indonesia, and has replaced \nPertamina in the existing production sharing contracts. The downstream regulator, BPH Migas, \nis  authorized  to  determine  and  regulate  rates  for  gas  transmission  and  distribution  through \npipelines, and prices for residential and small-scale commercial consumers. BPH Migas is also \nentrusted to resolve disputes among participants in natural gas transportation activities and to \ngrant access and tender rights to participate in the natural gas master plan. Gas prices charged \nto  industrial  and  other  customers  not  classified  as  small-scale  will  be  unregulated  and  will  be \ndetermined bilaterally between the customer and the provider of gas and the margin on the gas \nprice will not be subject to regulation.  \n \nBPH  Migas  has  undergone  capacity  building  to  fully  operationalize  its  downstream \n9. \nregulatory  functions.  Under  the  current  arrangements,  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mineral \nResources  (MEMR)  is  responsible  for  policy  making,  regulation  of  the  upstream  part,  and  \u2013 \ntogether  with  BPH  Migas  \u2013  regulation  of  the  downstream  part. 2    BP  Migas  acts  as  the \ncontracting authority in the upstream part, and BPH Migas in the downstream part. The dual role \nof  regulator  and  contracting  authority  played  by  BPH  Migas  may  raise  concerns  among \noperators  about  its  objectivity  in  the  case  of  contractual  disputes.  The  subdivision  of  the \ncontracting authority for the upstream and downstream business between  BP  Migas  and  BPH \nMigas  may  lead  to  inconsistencies  in  the  planning  and  implementation  of  upstream  and \ndownstream  projects.  Consequently,  the  current  arrangements  should  be  reviewed  in  the \nmedium term, with a view to creating a single regulatory body and a single contracting agency, \nand ensuring that the former has no links to the latter and is fully independent.3  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n2  The regulatory role within MEMR is exercised by its Directorate General of Oil and Gas (DG Migas). \n3  Such independence can be achieved by  giving the new regulatory  body a statutory authority and ensuring that it \n(i) has  adequate  technical  expertise,  (ii)  reports  to  the  President  of  Indonesia,  (iii)  has  no  financial  stake  in  any \nsector operator, (iv) is financially autonomous through funding from levies on the regulated industry, (v) is headed \nby  commissioners  appointed  for  fixed  terms  and  on  the  basis  of  transparent  selection  criteria,  and  (vi)  has  an \nappropriate  stakeholder  representation.  Apart  from  managing  tariffs  not  prescribed  by  contract  or  determined  by \nthe market, the new body should take over some other regulatory functions currently exercised by MEMR, such as \nissuing licenses and setting service standards. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3      23          \n\nBACKGROUND ON PGN \n \n\n1. \nPT  Perusahaan  Gas  Negara  (Persero)  Tbk  (PGN)  is  Indonesia\u2019s  leading  natural  gas \nutility, dominating the gas distribution market while also serving as the leading provider of gas \ntransmission services. \n \n2. \nPGN  started  operations  as  a  private  Dutch  company,  Firma  L.J.N.  Eindhoven  &  Co. \nGravenhage, in 1859. This Dutch entity was the first to introduce manufactured gas made from \ncoal  to  Indonesia.  In  1958,  the  Indonesian  Government  assumed  control  of  the  entity  and \nchanged its name to Badan Pengambil Alih Perusahaan-Perusahaan Listrik dan Gas, becoming \nBadan  Pimpinan  Usaha  \u2013  Perusahaan  Listrik  Negara  (BPU-PLN)  in  1961.  On  May  13,  1965, \nBPU-PLN was established as a state company and became known as Perusahaan Negara Gas \n(PN  Gas).  Pursuant  to  subsequent  Government  Regulations  No.  27  of  1984  PN  Gas  was \nconverted  into  a  public  service  enterprise  under  the  name  Perusahaan  Umum  Gas  Negara. \nPGN became a limited liability company and adopted its current name in 1996 and the company \nwas given an exclusive license to develop and distribute natural gas and manufactured gas in \nIndonesia.  Pursuant  to  the  New  Oil  and  Gas  Law  passed  in  2001,  PGN  is  deemed  to  have  a \nlicense  to  continue  its  existing  distribution  and  transmission  business.  PGN\u2019s  59.75%-owned \nsubsidiary, Transgasindo, has a license to conduct its transmission business which was issued \non February 26, 2002.  As at 1 June 2006, PGN has a total of 1,274 permanent employees, at \nthe parent level and in Transgasindo, its subsidiary. \n \n3. \nPGN  operates  its  business  through  various  strategic  business  units  based  on  regions \nand through one subsidiary. Three strategic business units have been formed for the distribution \nbusiness: SBU I, covering West Java and South Sumatra area, SBU II covering East Java and \nCentral  Java,  and  SBU  III  covering  North  Sumatra.

PGN\u2019s  distribution  business in  these seven  districts  in \nthe three months ended 31 March 2006 distributed an average of 337 mmscfd of natural gas, \nprincipally to industrial customers. Demand for natural gas in Indonesia has been increasing, in \npart as a result of the progressive reduction of fuel oil subsidies which began in 2001 and which \nhas  made  natural  gas  an  attractive  alternative  fuel.  In  order  to  meet  this  increasing  demand, \nPGN has plans to expand its distribution business to include networks in two districts, Lampung \nand  Semarang  which  are  strategically  located  in  close  proximity  to  the  proposed  new \ntransmission pipelines, as well as to expand its existing networks. \n \n6. \nMost  of  PGN\u2019s  distribution  networks  have  operated  below  full  capacity  in  recent  years \ndue  to  supply  constraints.  Demand  generally  has  exceeded  the  volume  of  natural  gas  which \ncould be transported to the company\u2019s distribution networks due to the limitations of the existing \ngas transmission infrastructure in Indonesia. PGN expects that the construction of planned new \ntransmission  pipelines,  including  the  Project,  will  assist  in  reducing  existing  gas  supply \nconstraints  and  will  allow  PGN  to  increase  utilization  of  its  distribution  networks,  as  well  as \nconstraining upward pressure on gas supply prices.  \n \n7. \nPGN\u2019s  transmission  network  currently  comprises  (i)  the  Grissik-to-Duri  transmission \npipeline  in  Sumatra  through  which  ConocoPhillips  ships  gas  under  a  gas  transportation \nagreement  to  Caltex;  and  (ii)  the  Grissik-to-Singapore  transmission  pipeline  through  which \nPertamina ships gas under a gas transportation agreement to PowerGas of Singapore, both of \nwhich  are  owned  and  operated  through  PGN\u2019s  59.75%-owned  subsidiary,  Transgasindo;  and  \n(iii) two small transmission operations in Medan and Jakarta used by Pertamina to supply gas to \npower  stations  and  CNG  filling  stations.  The  Grissik-to-Duri,  Grissik-to-Singapore  and  Medan \ntransmission systems consist of 1,074 km of pipelines with a combined capacity of 869 mmscfd \nwhile  the  Jakarta  transmission  system  utilizes  the  existing  distribution  pipelines.  PGN\u2019s \ntransmission  network  transported  an  average  of  676  mmscfd  of  natural  gas  in  the  3  months \nended 31 March 2006.   \n \n8. \nIn  addition  to  its  existing  transmission  network,  PGN  has  begun  the  construction  of \nPhases  I  and  II  of  the  South  Sumatra-to-West  Java  transmission  pipeline  project  and  has \nreceived approval for a transmission pipeline from Duri to Medan. PGN also intends to tender \nfor  the  right  to  develop  other  gas  transmission  pipeline  projects  which  are  put  out  to  public \ntender  by  BPH  Migas  as  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  plan  to  develop  Indonesia\u2019s integrated  gas \ntransmission and distribution network.1 These projects are namely: the East-Kalimantan to Java \nand Sengkang to Makassar transmission pipelines. \n  \nA. \n\nCorporate Governance \n\n9. \nPGN can be cited as a model for SOE reform.  In December 2003 PGN listed its shares \non  the  Jakarta  and  Surabaya  stock  exchanges  with  an  Initial  Public  Offering  which  saw  the \nGovernment  reduce  its  shareholding  in  PGN  to  61%.    Although  the  Government  retains  a \n\n                                                 \n1   To  promote  the  use  of  natural  gas  and  to  ensure  that  existing  demand  can  be  satisfied,  the  Government  has \nindicated  its  plans  to  establish  a  national  integrated  transmission  and  distribution  network  for  piped  natural  gas. \nThis  integrated  network  is  expected  to  comprise  pipelines  that  will  connect  gas  fields  and  customers  from  North \nSumatra  through  Java  to  East  Kalimantan.  In  order  to  plan  for  and  develop  this  network,  the  Government  has \nprepared a natural gas Master Plan, which includes the development of new transmission and distribution projects. \nAll new projects under the Master Plan are subject to an open tender process and PGN intends to compete for the \nrights to develop, own and operate selected new projects under the Master Plan. \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\nSpecial  Share  and  has  the  power  to  direct  PGN\u2019s  activities,  it  has  allowed  the  company  to \noperate as an independent, commercial entity. \n \n10. \nPGN\u2019s listing has subjected it to company law and other laws that apply to private sector \ncompanies.  Listing  has  also  subjected  PGN\u2019s  commercial  performance  to  monitoring  by \nshareholders  other  than  the  Government  because  shareholders  have  a  residual  rather  than \nprior claim on the firm\u2019s asset.  The significant rise in PGN\u2019s share price since the IPO, from the \nlisting  price  of  Rp1,500  to  Rp12,600  at  1  June  2006  may  be  seen  as  a  reflection  of  market \nconfidence  and  is  to  a  large  extent  supported  by  PGN\u2019s  reputation  for  good  corporate \ngovernance.  PGN  was  awarded  the  top  performing  listed  company  2006  by  Investor,  a  local \nbusiness magazine, in April 2006.  \n \nAs a publicly listed company, PGN is also subject to the requirements of the Indonesian \n11. \nCapital Markets Supervisory Agency (Bapepam) regarding independent board members, and an \nindependent audit committee which is not to be chaired by chairman of the board.  PGN has two \nindependent commissioners on its board of commissioners (BOC) whose task is to monitor the \noperations  of  the  business  on  behalf  of  the  public  investors.  PGN  has  also  formed  an \nindependent  audit  committee,  currently  chaired  by  one  of  the  independent  commissioners, \nwhich is responsible to report to the BOC on the financial condition of the company, business \nmanagement and to increase the effectiveness of internal and external audit functions. \n \n12. \nPGN received an ISO 9001:2000 certificate from Lloyd\u2019s Register Quality Assurance in \n2003, and in 2005, PGN committed itself to implement good corporate governance principles of \ntransparency,  independence,  accountability  and  fairness.  As  part  of  its  corporate  governance, \nPGN requires its staff to adhere to its Standard Operating Procedures for safety in emergency \nsituations for transmission and distribution pipelines; operations and maintenance of distribution \npipelines; and pipeline design standards, which have all been developed following international \ncodes of practice. \n\n13. \nAs part of its SOE reforms, PGN is required to borrow from private lenders without the \nbenefit  of  a  government  guarantee,  subjecting  it  to  scrutiny  by  commercial  lenders  and \ninternational credit rating agencies. In 2003, the company issued its first $150 million unsecured \nEurobond and in 2004, PGN raised its second Eurobond amounting $125 million. Both its bonds \nwere  rated  B  by  Moody\u2019s.  In  mid  2005  PGN  started  discussions  with  international  commercial \nbanks to raise debt financing for its South Sumatra \u2013 West Java Phase II project, on corporate \nbasis, without government guarantee. \n \n14. \nIn implementing the SSWJ Phase II project, PGN\u2019s commitment to rehabilitate an area of \nlost mangrove habitat at the coast lines of Labuhan Maringgai and Muara Bekasi the two points \nwhere the pipeline meets the sea, demonstrates PGN\u2019s appreciation of environmental mitigation \nefforts.    In  managing  its  land  acquisition  for  the  project,  a  formal  grievance  mechanism  is  in \nplace and communicated to affected people. As of 1 June 2006, land acquisition has reached \n99.9%  for  the  Pagardewa  to  Labuhan  Maringgai  section,  71%  for  the  Grissik  to  Pagardewa \nsection and 40% for the Muara Bekasi to Rawa section.  To date, no formal complaint has been \nfiled. \n \nB. \n\nManagement Team \n\nPGN\u2019s  management  team  comprises  a  five  member  board  of  directors  (BOD)  whose \n15. \nactivities  are  monitored  by  the  six  members  of  the  BOC.  In  compliance  with  Jakarta  Stock \nExchange regulations on annual general meetings (AGMs), PGN\u2019s next AGM is scheduled to be \nheld on 8 June 2006.   \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n  \n\n27\n\n \n\n \n16. \nAll  current  members  of  PGN\u2019s  BOD  and  BOC  have  extensive  experience  in  the \nIndonesian oil and gas industry.  Members of its BOD have served the company for long period \nof  service,  ranging  from  12  to  23  years.    PGN\u2019s  BOC  come  from  a  variety  of  backgrounds \nincluding the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, the Ministry of Finance, PERTAMINA \nand the National Development Planning Agency (Bapenas).Tables A3.1 and A3.2 show PGN\u2019s \nBOC and BOC. \n\n \nTable A3.1: PGN\u2019s Board of Commissioners \n \n\n \nProfessional Background \n\n \nEducational Background \n\n \nServing \nSince \n\n \nMembers \n \n\n \nSumarno Surono \n\n \nBemby Uripto \n\n \nCurrent \nPosition \n \n\n \nPresident \nComissioner \n \nComissioner \n\n \nPudja Sunasa \n\n \nComissioner \n\n \nSahal Lumban Gaol \n\n \nComissioner \n\n \nNenny Miryani Saptaji \n\n \nRudy Tavinos \n\n \nIndependent \nComissioner \n\n \nIndependent \nComissioner \n\n \nHead of Monetary Bureau, \nMinistry of Finance \n \nNational Development \nPlanning Agency \n\n \nHead of General Bureau \nDirectorate of Energy and \nNatural Resources, Ministry \nof Energy and Mineral \nResources \n \nDirector of Oil Income and \nNon-Tax , Ministry of \nFinance \n \nAdvisor to Pertamina\u2019s \nCommissioners for \ndownstream business \n \nSeveral oil and gas private \ncompanies including Medco, \nBadak LNG and Arun LNG \n\n \nPhD in Economics \nUniversity of Hawaii, US \n \nMasters in Finance, \nColorado School of Mines, \nDenver, US \n \nPetroleum Engineering \ndegree, Bandung Institute \nof Technology \n\n \nPhD in Economics,  \nIowa State University, US \n\n \nPhD in Engineering, \nUniversity of Auckland, \nNew Zealand. \n \nBachelor\u2019s in Chemical \nEngineering degree, \nBandung Institute of \nTechnology \n \n\n \nOct \n2003 \n \nOct \n2003 \n\n \nJun \n2002 \n\n \nJun \n2002 \n\n \nOct \n2003 \n\n \nMay \n2004 \n\n PGN = PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) Tbk, US = United States.  \n Source: PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) Tbk. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\n \n\nMembers \n\n \nWMP SImandjuntak \n\n \nDjoko Pramono \n\n \nAdil Abbas \n\n \nNursubagjo Prijono \n\n \nCurrent \nPosition \n \n\n \nPresident \nDirector \n \nDirector of \nFinance \n \nDirector of \nBusiness \nDevelopment \n \nDirector of \nOperations \n\nTable A3.2: PGN\u2019s Board of Directors \n \n\n \nProfessional Background \n\n \nEducational Background \n\n \nServing \nSince \n\n \nHead of Administration at oil \nand gas research in 1984 \n \nPGN \n\n \nHead of Planning Programs \nat  oil and gas research  \n\n \nHead of exploitation project \nstudies at  oil and gas \nresearch  \n\n \nAccountancy degree from \nUniversity of Indonesia \n \nAccountancy degree from \nUniversity of Pajajaran \n \nCivil engineering from \nUniversity of Gajahmada \n\n \nDegree in Petroleum \nEngineering, Bandung \nInstitute of Technology.  \nPost graduate, University \nof Tulsa, US \n \nPost graduate from \nUniversity of Indonesia \n \n\n \n2001 \n\n \n2001 \n\n \n2001 \n\n \n2001 \n\n \n2001 \n\n \nDirector of \nGeneral Affairs \n\n \nPGN \n\n  PGN = PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) Tbk, US = United States. \n  Source: PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) Tbk. \n\n \nSutikno \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4      29          \n\nSUMMARY OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION ON PGN \n \n\n1. \nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  of  PT  Perusahaan  Gas  Negara  (Persero)  Tbk \n(PGN)  for  the  years  ended  31  December  2004  and  2005  have  been  prepared  in  accordance \nwith  Indonesia  accounting  standards.  The  statements  have  been  audited  by  independent \nauditors Prasetio, Sarwoko & Sandjaja (a member firm of Ernst & Young) who have been given \nan unqualified audit opinion.  The statements consolidate PGN\u2019s 59.75% owned subsidiary, PT \nTransportasi Gas Indonesia (Transgasindo) which accounted for 21% of revenues and 39% of \ntotal  assets  in  2005.  Transgasindo\u2019s  financial  statements  were  audited  by  other  auditors  who \nhave provided an unqualified report on these statements to PGN\u2019s auditors \n \nA. \n\nIncome Statement and Profitability  \n\n2. \nPGN\u2019s  total  revenues  have  increased  steadily  over  the  past  three  years,  reflecting  the \nexpansion  of  the  company\u2019s  distribution  and  transmission  business.    In  2005  PGN  generated \ntotal  revenues  of  Rp5.4  trillion  (equivalent  to  $584  million)  comprising  (a)  Rp4.3  trillion \n(equivalent to $460 million) from distribution, and (b) Rp 1.1 trillion (equivalent to $124 million) \nfrom  transmission.    Cost  of  goods  sold  in  2005  was  Rp2.6  trillion  (equivalent  to  $285  million), \nrepresenting  49%  of  revenues.    Total  operating  expenses  (transmission,  distribution  and, \ngeneral  and  administration)  were  Rp1.2  trillion  (equivalent  to  $132  million)  or  23%  of  total \nrevenue.  PGN\u2019s income from operations was Rp1.6 trillion (equivalent to $167 million) and the \ncompany\u2019s total pretax profit was Rp1.4 trillion (equivalent to $147 million).   \n \n3. \nRevenues were generated from (i) selling 112,304 million standard cubic feet (mmscf) of \ngas through seven distribution networks in West Java, East Java and Sumatra; (ii) transporting \nan  average  of  219,890  mmscf  through  three  transmission  lines.    Revenues  from  operations, \nyear  on  year,  grew  24%  in  2004  and  22%  in  2005,  reflecting  higher  gas  volume  sales  and \nhigher gas sales prices.  Operating income grew 22% in 2004 and 56% in 2005.  Net income in \n2004 was negatively affected by large forex losses of Rp242 billion (equivalent to $26 million) \nwhile in 2005, forex losses were significantly lower, at Rp91 billion (equivalent to $ 10 million). \nThe increase in revenue, together with better cost control and substantially lower forex losses, \nled to net income of  Rp862 billion (equivalent to $93  million) for 2005, which represented an \n82% increase compared to the prior year\u2019s net income.

The  Project  pipeline  will  run  in  the \nsame corridor from Pagardewa to Labuhan Maringgai with the other gas pipeline (SSWJ-Phase \nI). The two projects require separate gas pipelines as the gas from the Pagardewa gas field is \ndifferent in quality from that of the Grissik gas field. \n \nIn  conformance  with  Indonesia\u2019s  environmental  impact  analysis  (AMDAL)  regulation,1 \n2. \nPGN  prepared  three  AMDALs,  respectively,  for  section  1-the  onshore  pipeline  from  Grissik  to \nPagardewa  in  South  Sumatra;  section  2-the  onshore  pipeline  from  Pagardewa  to  Labuhan \nMaringgai also in South Sumatra; and section 3-the undersea pipeline from Labuhan Maringgai \nto  the  shore  at  Muara  Bekasi  in  West  Java  and  the  onshore  pipeline  from  Muara  Bekasi  to \nRawa Maju. This summary initial environmental examination (SIEE) summarizes major findings \nof  the  three  AMDALs  and  updates  of  the  original  assessments  based  on  latest  available \ninformation on land use and forest along the proposed pipeline corridor.   \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe  Project  will  construct  196  kilometers  (km)  of  steel  pipelines  of  36  inches,  and  465 \nkm  of  32  inches.  Major  facilities  along  the  Project  corridor  will  include  2  receiving  stations,  1 \ndelivery  station,  2  gas  compressor  stations,  and  a  supervisory  control  and  data  acquisition \n(SCADA) system. \n \nThe pipeline will be laid in a 25 m wide corridor for both Phase I & II pipelines. Each pipe \n4. \nwill be laid at about 9 m from the boundaries of the pipeline corridor right of way. The pipeline \ncorridor will be cleared of vegetation and debris. The pipes will be buried in trenches at least 1.5 \nm  deep  below  ground  surface.  Except  for  the  top  0.25  m,  excavated  soil  will  be  backfilled, \nleveled, and compacted in layers of 0.2 m to prevent subsidence and stress on the buried pipe. \nFor the top 0.25 m, the excavated topsoil will be used for backfilling up to a height 0.1 m above \nthe  natural  ground.  The  topsoil  will  not  be  compacted  mechanically.  After  the  pipeline  is \ncompleted, markers will be placed along the pipeline at 1 km intervals. \n \n5. \nPipeline construction across small water courses will be done using an open cut method. \nAt major river crossing, pipes will be laid using a horizontal directional drilling (HDD). At major \nroad crossings, a thrust boring (TB) method will be used to avoid traffic disturbances. For small \nroad crossings, an open cut method will be used. \n \n6. \nThe offshore pipeline will cross the Java Sea and the Jakarta Bay. Generally, the pipe \nwill be laid on the sea bed for water depths greater than 13 m. For water depths less than 13 m, \nthe pipe will be buried.  In areas with heavy sea traffic, the pipe will be covered by rock armour \nto  protect  the  pipeline  from  ship  anchors.  For  crossing  with  other  undersea  facilities,  such  as \nfiber  optic  cables  and  other  undersea  pipes,  the  pipes  will  be  laid  on  concrete  mattress \nsupports.  \n\n                                                 \n1   Decree of the Minister for the Environment no. 17 of the year 2001. \n \n\n \n\n\f38     Appendix 6 \n\nRoutine inspection and maintenance of the pipeline during the project operation will be \n\n \n7. \ndone by foot patrols and the use of vehicles. For annual inspections, helicopters may be used. \n \nThe Project requires about 1,250 ha of land consisting of 1,165 ha in South Sumatra and \n8. \n85 ha in West Java. As of February 2006, PGN has acquired about 77% and 80% of land for the \npipeline corridors in South Sumatra and in West Java, respectively. PGN expects to complete \nthe land acquisition by October 2006. The Project will affect 4,980 households along the 500 km \nland corridor due to the loss of income earned from crops and trees in the acquired land. Only \n40  structures,  including  rudimentary  farm  field  shelters  and  wooden  houses,  will  be  physically \naffected.  After  the  pipeline  is  laid,  cultivation  and  building  construction  on  the  corridor  will  be \nprohibited.  \n \n \n9. \nPGN  will  be  responsible  for  overall  management  of  the  Project,  including  construction \nand  operations.  Project  implementation  will  be  under  the  responsibility  of  the  director  of \ndevelopment.  After  project  completion,  operations  of  the  pipeline  system  will  be  under  the \nresponsibility of the director of operations. About 176 persons will be required for the operations \nof the gas pipeline system.  \n \nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n \n\n1. \n\nPhysical Environment \n\n10. \nThe onshore pipeline sections in south Sumatra and in West Java will be constructed on \nrelatively  flat  land  with  0\u20133%  slope  and  with  elevations  ranging  from  10  to  38  m  above  mean \nsea  level.  The  466  km  section  from  Grissik  to  Labuhan  Maringgai  in  Sumatra  will  traverse \nplantations, areas designated as forests, farm lands, paddy fields and settlements.  \n \nHydrocarbon levels in the air of West Java ranged from 23.2\u2013105.2 \u00b5g/m3, and those in \n11. \nSouth Sumatra 11.15\u201328.0 \u00b5g/m3. The hydrocarbon levels were well below the safety threshold \nof 160 \u00b5g/m3. \n \nThe pipeline in South Sumatra will cross 21 major rivers. The Muara Bekasi-Rawa Maju \n12. \nsection in West Java will cross three major rivers. The major rivers in South Sumatra upstream \nand downstream of the pipeline crossings are mainly used for transportation. In West Java, the \nrivers are mainly used for irrigation.  \n \n13. \nThe  rivers  in  West  Java  are  grossly  polluted  by  industrial  and  domestic  wastes.  The \nrivers  in  South  Sumatra  are  relatively  less  polluted  and  the  quality  meets  the  provincial  water \nquality standard for raw water supply sources. \n \n14. \nSea water quality between Labuhan Maringgai and Muara Bekasi shows a slight degree \nof pollution against the standards for marine life, Decree No. 51/2004, Ministry of Environment. \nThe  coastal  water  around  Muara  Bekasi  was  found  to  be  more  polluted  than  that  of  Labuhan \nMaringgai due to higher densities of population, industrial and other economic activities. \n \n \n\nBiological Environment \n\n2. \n\nForests in Sumatra have long been encroached upon by various development activities, \n15. \nparticularly  for  large  oil  palm  and  rubber  plantations.  Most  of  the  remaining  forests  in  South \nSumatra  exist  in  small  and  isolated  patches  scattered  in  the  region  and  provide  no  significant \n\n \n\n\f \n\n    Appendix 6     39 \n\necological  value  to  wildlife,  especially  the  Sumatran  tigers.  Only  39.6  ha  of  land  along  the \ncorridor  in  South  Sumatra  are  designated  as  forest  areas,  consisting  of  37.8  ha  in  South \nSumatra Province and 1.8 ha in Lampung Province.2 The forests in West Java are small and so \ndegraded  that  they  no  longer  serve  an  ecological  function.  The  onshore  pipeline  corridor  in \nWest Java will not pass through any forests. \n \n16. \nThe coast around Labuhan Maringgai is mostly sandy. The mangrove forests along the \ncoasts of Labuhan Maringgai and Muara Bekasi vary in density and expanse. They have been \nsubjected  to  considerable  stress  by  human  activities  and  the  width  has  been  reduced  to  less \nthan 20 m. In Muara Bekasi there is very little left of the mangrove forests as most of the areas \nare now being used for fishponds. \n \n17.  Most  of  the  fish  species  where  the  pipeline  will  pass  have  economic  value.  There  are \nalso  coral  fish  in  the  Kepulauan  Seribu  Area,  which  are  not  classified  as  rare  species.  The \noffshore  pipeline  alignment  has  been  selected  to  avoid  the  coral  reefs  around  the  Seribu \nIslands.  However,  the  sea  areas  around  Labuhan  Maringgai  and  Muara  Bekasi  have  no  coral \nreef or marine mammals of ecological importance.   \n \n \n\nSociocultural Environment \n\n3. \n\nThere are 115 villages near the pipeline corridor between Grissik\u2013Labuhan Maringgai in \n18. \nSouth Sumatra and  Muara Bekasi\u2013Rawa Maju  in West Java. These villages have populations \nranging  from  508  to  27,297.  The  villages  in  West  Java  in  general  have  higher  population \ndensities, ranging from 72 to 7,205 per km2. \n \n19. \nIn South Sumatra, the villagers are mostly farmers and laborers employed in rubber and \npalm oil plantations, paddy fields, farm lands, fishponds and fishing activities.  In West Java, the \nmajority  of  the  villagers  work  as  farmers,  fishermen,  and  fishpond  farmers.  Some  are  self-\nemployed  micro  entrepreneurs  in  the  informal  economic  sectors,  such  as  vendors  and  small \ntraders. Some are also employees of private sector enterprises.  \n \n20. \nEducation infrastructure in South Sumatra is inadequate and schools are only available \nup to the elementary level. Health facilities are inadequate in South Sumatra.  Most villages are \nserved  only  by  small  health  clinics  providing  only  basic  medical  care.  In  West  Java,  health \nclinics  at  village  level  in  Muara  Bekasi  are  adequately  equipped.  Despite  this,  environmental \nsanitation in both areas is poor. \n \nD. \n\n Anticipated Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n21. \nConstruction  activities  under  the  Project  that  could  create  adverse  environmental \nimpacts are: (i) movement of heavy equipment for trenching, transport of pipes and movement \nof  personnel,  (ii)  clearing  of  vegetation  within  the  corridor,  (iii)  trenching  activities  including \nstorage of excavated materials, (iv) laying of pipes under the rivers, (v) laying of pipes under the \nsea,  and  (vi)  construction  of  the  gas  receiving  and  compressor  stations.  The  impacts  would \ninclude (i) noise, (ii) dust, (iii) loss of vegetation in the corridor, (iv) emissions from vehicles and \nheavy equipment used in the construction, and (v) increased turbidity of the river and sea water \nduring pipe laying. In general, the impacts would not be significant and they will be transient in \nnature  since  (i)  the  pipeline  is  a linear  structure and  the construction  activities  are  confined  to \nshort sections along a narrow corridor for around 5\u201310 days, (ii) the onshore corridor is mostly \n\n                                                 \n2   PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) Tbk. 2006. PGN Land Compensation Data as of April 2006. \n\n \n\n\f40     Appendix 6 \n\nPGN  will  ensure \n\nwithin  sparsely  populated  areas,  and  (iii)  the  offshore  section  is  within  areas  which  are  not \necologically  sensitive.  PGN  will  monitor  the  actual  environmental  impacts  of  the  Project  and \nensure the mitigation plans from all the AMDAL monitoring and mitigation documents (RKL and \nRPL) are implemented. \n \n22. \nTo  ensure  the  system  performance  and  integrity,  a  supervisory  control  and  data \nacquisition  (SCADA)  system  will  be  installed  to  manage  the  operations  of  the  gas  pipeline, \nincluding leak detection. The SCADA system will be operated from the master control station at \nBojonegara.  In  the  event  of  emergency,  the  SCADA  system  will  automatically  isolate  the \naffected pipe section by remotely operated valves. \n \n23. \nimplement  best \nenvironmental  management  practices  in  their  construction  to  minimize  normal  environmental \ndisturbances  associated  with  civil  works  construction.  In  addition,  the  contractors  will  also  be \nrequired to be responsible for providing basic facilities such as temporary housing, water supply, \nbasic health care, and sanitation facilities for the work force. Heavy construction machinery and \nequipment will be moved only along the right of way.  \n \n24. \nThe pipeline is designed to have an economic life of 20 years. However, technically the \nworking life of the pipeline can be as long as 40 years. After its useful life, the pipeline will be \ndecommissioned to make it free from fire hazard. The decommissioning of both the onshore and \noffshore  sections  of  the  pipeline  will  use  the  same  procedure.  The  residual  natural  gas  in  the \npipeline  will  be  purged  with  nitrogen  gas,  followed  by  water.  The  abandoned  pipes  will  stay \nburied filled with water.   \n \nE. \n\n Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n\nthe  contractors  will \n\nthrough  contracts \n\nthat \n\n25. \nThe AMDALs include preparation of RKL (environmental management plan (EMP)) and \nRPL  (environmental  monitoring  plan).  The  EMP  contains  mitigation  measures  for  all  identified \nmajor  impacts  during  the  construction  and  operations  phases,  and  monitoring  activities  to  be \ncarried  out  during  the  construction  and  operations.  PGN  has  incorporated  within  each \nconstruction  contract  environmental  management  requirements  to  be  complied  with  by  the \ncontractor  and  subcontractors.  In  addition,  the  contractors  will  be  briefed  on  the  conditions \nimposed by the MOE on the Project, the potential problems and mitigation measures as outlined \nin  the  AMDAL  reports,  and  their  obligations  in  meeting  those  requirements.  The  EMP  is \nsummarized in an Appendix to the IEE.  \n \n26. \nThe  implementation  of  the  RKL/RPL  by  PGN  will  involve  the  following  activities  (i) \nmaintaining  coordination  with  the  environmental  regulatory  agencies  and  contractors  for \neffective    project  environmental  management,  (ii)  monitoring  and  inspection  activities  of  the \nProject,  including  project  sites  and    enforcing  reporting  requirements  by  the  contractors  as \nstipulated in the contracts, (iii) coordination with the local agencies and communities to ensure \ncooperation  and  effective  execution  of  the  RKL/RPL,  and  (iv)  submission  of  semiannual \nenvironmental  monitoring  reports  as  required  by  MOE  and  the  local  governments  during  both \nconstruction and operation phases.3 \n\nIn the operations phase, the gas pipeline performance will be monitored by the SCADA \n\n \n\n27. \nsystem supplemented by foot patrolling.  \n \n\n                                                 \n3   The reports would also be required by ADB. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n    Appendix 6     41 \n\nDuring  the  construction,  about  38  environmental  staff  under  the  manager  of  Quality \n28. \nAssurance and Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) will be responsible for regular monitoring \nand  monthly  evaluation  of  the  environmental  management  results.  During  operations  83  HSE \nstaff  will  be  employed.  Bapedalda  (Badan  Pengendali  Dampak  Lingkungan  Daerah,  Local \nEnvironmental  Impact  Assessment  Agencies)  and  ESDM  Department  (Energi  dan  Sumber \nDaya Mineral, Energy and Mineral Resources) will monitor Project environmental performance. \nPGN will allocate approximately $50,000 annually for environmental monitoring. \n \nF. \n\n Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n\n(after \n\ninput  and  opinions  were  given  30  days \n\n29. \nPGN  has  carried  out  extensive  public  consultation  and  disclosure  with  the  Project\u2019s \nstakeholders since the early stage of the AMDAL process, including (i) dissemination of project \ninformation through mass media including local broadcasting. Community members who wished \nto  give \nthe  announcements  were \nbroadcasted/published) to make submissions to the local BAPEDALDA or PGN; (ii) surveys of \npublic  attitudes  towards  the  Project;  and  (iii)  public  meetings  held  in  nine  regencies  and \nsubdistricts along the entire Project area from November 2003 to August 2005 with an average \nof 100 people attending each meeting. These meetings provided information on the Project and \nits impacts on community members. The people consulted generally supported the Project but \nexpressed some concerns regarding the adequacy of compensation for land acquisition.  \n \n30. \nA survey of the attitudes of local communities towards the project reveals the following; \n(i)  of  those  interviewed  along  the  Grissik\u2013Pagardewa  section,  78%  expressed  support  for  the \nproject, 5% stated otherwise and 17% abstained; (ii) in West Java, attitudes towards the project \nshow  47%  expressed  support,  39%  stated  otherwise  and  the  balance  abstained;  and  (iii)  in \nLabuhan Maringgai, 40% expressed support, 45% stated otherwise and the balance abstained. \nThe survey in Labuhan Maringgai was carried out before 1999 prior to any public consultations \nheld to explain the benefits of the project. PGN will carry out further public consultations before \nOctober  2006  to  gauge  current  attitudes  for  the  Pagardewa-Labuhan  Maringgai  segment,  and \ntake  proper  measures  to  address  local  communities\u2019  concern  about  the  project.  PGN  will \ncontinue public consultations including the disclosure of relevant information for the duration of \nthe Project. \n  \n31. \nBased  on  field  findings  from  community  involvements  activities,  PGN  has  prepared  a \ncommunity  development  program  (CDP)  for  local  communities.    The  CDP  will  provide  social \ninfrastructure (including religious activities, medical equipment and supply, renovation of school \nbuildings  and  supply  of  handbooks),  consultation  and  counseling,  and  additional  community \nservices based on specific needs for the communities. The CDP budget is approximately Rp 5 \nbillion and is included in the project cost. \n \nG. \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\n32. \nThe Project is the most practical way to increase the share of natural gas in the energy \nprofile of West Java.  Pipeline transport is the only viable option to bring natural gas from the \nonshore production fields in Sumatra to industrial and residential consumers in West Java.  \n \n33. \nDuring  construction,  the  Project  will  create  transient  disturbances  to  environmental \nquality.  However,  the  disturbances  common  to  all  civil  work  construction  would  not  create \nsignificant impacts considering the short construction period over a section of the corridor before \nthe construction progresses to other sections of the narrow construction area.  \n \n\n \n\n\f42     Appendix 6 \n\nDuring the construction and operation phases, PGN will follow the mitigation measures \n34. \nand monitoring schedules identified in the three RKLs/RPLs that were approved by the MOE to \navoid  environmental  impacts  of  the  Project.  PGN  will  establish  the  manager  of  Quality \nAssurance  and  HSE  to  conduct  regular  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  environmental \nmanagement  results.  PGN  will  submit  semi-annually  environmental  monitoring  reports  to  both \nMOE and ADB. \n \nH. \n\nConclusions \n\n35. \nThe Project will create environmental benefits by replacing more polluting fuels such as \nHSD  and  coal,  with  natural  gas.  Based  on  the  estimates  of  natural  gas  use,  the  net  present \nvalue of the environmental benefits is estimated at about $74.52 million for the operating life of \n20 years and a discount rate of 8% per annum.  The Project can be justified on environmental \ngrounds because its benefits exceed its Environmental costs.     \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7     43     \n\nSUMMARY OF THE LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n\n \nA. \n\nProject Description \n\n1.  The South Sumatra to West Java Phase II Gas Pipeline Project (the Project) will transport \ngas  from  the  Grissik  gas  field  in  South  Sumatra  to  Rawa  Maju  in  West  Java.  The  Project \nconsists of a 661 km pipeline and includes 500 km of onshore pipeline and 161 km of offshore \npipeline.  Construction  began  in  January  2006  and  is  scheduled  to  be  completed  no  later  than \nFebruary 2007. \n\nB. \n\nScope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n2.  The  onshore  pipeline  alignment  was  selected  because  it  minimizes  the  number  of \nstructures,  persons,  and  the  forest  ecosystems  affected.    The  pipeline  right  of  way  (RoW) \nrequires  the  acquisition  of  land  and  other  fixed  assets.    In  South  Sumatra  and  Lampung \nprovinces,  the  Project  will  acquire  951.42  ha  of  privately  owned  land  and  186.34  ha  of  land \nowned by corporations. In all, 4,791 land parcels belonging to 4,315  users (both legal owners \nand  non-titled  users)  are  affected.  The  land  acquired  is  mainly  agricultural  land  such  as  rice \nfields, traditional plantations, drylands, and arable homesteads.  Affected persons (APs) inhabit \n115 villages with a combined population of 393,426 and an average population density of 166 \nper  km2.   A  further  40  households  will  incur  loss  of  structures,  totaling  28  structures  in  South \nSumatra  and  12  in  Lampung,  with  an  average  area  of  50  m2.1   No  community  structures  and \ncommon property resources nor social facility structures will be directly affected by the Project. \nThe pipeline will have temporary impacts during construction on some public facilities such as \nirrigation canals and village roads. Since all APs in South Sumatra and Lampung have opted for \ncash  compensation,  no  resettlement  is  required.  Land  used  for  the  RoW  in  West  Java  will  be \nleased  from  Perum  Jasa  Tirta  II  (PJT  II).  Additional  data  on  levels  of  affectedness  of  non-\ntitleholders, APs owning or using structures and number of sharecroppers is being gathered and \nthe land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) will be updated to incorporate this data.  \n\nC. \n\nSocioeconomic Information on Affected Persons \n\n3.  A  socio-economic  survey  conducted  in  1997  indicates  that  64%  of  the  population  in \naffected villages is in the productive age range (15\u201355 years). Average household size is about \n5\u20138  members.  Farming  is  the  main  occupation  for  both  males  and  females.    The  secondary \noccupations of males are wage laboring, civil service, and trading while, for females, the main \nsecondary occupation is the retailing of food crop products. The average levels of education are \nelementary and junior high school levels. Skill levels are limited, mostly carpentry, mechanics, \ndriving, and handicrafts. The project area will not pass through any communities of indigenous \npeople  and  none  of  the  communities  along  the  RoW  are  isolated  communities  with  closed \neconomic systems.  \n\nD. \n\nInformation  Dissemination,  Consultation,  Participatory  Approaches,  and \nDisclosure Requirements \n\n4.  Since  the  early  stage  of  the  land  acquisition  process  in  2004,  and  prior  to  its  acquisition \nnegotiations,  PGN  carried  out  extensive  and  thorough  information  dissemination,  consultation \nand disclosure with the Project\u2019s stakeholders including: (i) information dissemination regarding \n\n                                                 \n1 These structures comprise semipermanent wooden houses, huts, and farm field shelters. \n\n \n\n\f44     Appendix 7 \n\nrights to entitlements, (ii) public consultation meetings with APs, and (iii) the formation of Land \nAcquisition  Committees  (LACs)  chaired  by  the  vice  governor  or  regent  in  each  regency.    APs \nhave been able to participate in the LARP preparation through institutional channels, which are: \nvillage  governments,  village  boards  of  resilience  (LKMD),  and  district  &  regency  level \ngovernments.  PGN representatives have cooperated extensively with these institutions. \n\n5.  Public  consultations  have  been  carried  out  through  various  means,  including;  (i) \ndissemination of project information through the mass media.  Community members were given \n30  days  after  the  announcement  notifications  to  submit  input  and  opinions  to  the  local \nBAPEDALDA  or  to  PGN;  (ii)  surveys  of  public  attitudes  towards  the  Project;  and  (iii)  public \nmeetings held in nine regencies and sub-districts along the entire Project area from November \n2003 to August 2005 with an average of 100 people attending each meeting.  Those meetings \nprovided  information  on  the  Project  and  its  impacts.    They  also  solicited  AP  views  on  impact \nmitigation,  and  sought  cooperation  of  communities  and  all  related  parties.  PGN  will  continue \npublic  consultations,  take  proper  measures  to  address  local  communities\u2019  concern  about  the \nProject and continue to disclose relevant information for the duration of the Project.  \n\nE. \n\nGrievance Redress Mechanisms \n\n6.  The  grievance  procedure,  based  on  Presidential  Decree  No.  55/1993,  is  designed  to \nmitigate disputes regarding compensation levels for land. Since the determination of the Project \nalignment  and  the  land  acquisition  program  is  participatory  in  nature  and  carried  out  in \nconsultation  with  the  APs,  the  need  for  grievance  redress  procedures  has  been  minimal. \nHowever, complaints and grievances can still occur in the course of project implementation. All \ngrievances  must  be  registered  within  a  month  from  the  announcement  of  the  result  of  the \nmeasurement  and  inventory  of  the  land,  structures  and  assets  and  are  addressed  by  the \nrelevant  LAC.    If  the  LAC  cannot  resolve  the  problem  specifically  regarding  financial \ncompensation  then  the  dispute  sent  to  the  district  court  (Pengadilan  Negeri)  for  resolution. \nDuring the disputation settlement, the compensation is held in an escrow account by the district \ncourt.  Grievance  redress  mechanism  and  procedures  are  publicized  at  meetings  with \nstakeholders so that APs are aware of their rights and procedures for grievance redress. \n\nF. \n\nPolicy and Legal Framework \n\n7.  PGN\u2019s  general  policy  for  land  acquisition,  compensation  and  resettlement  regarding  gas \ntransmission and distribution projects follows Presidential Decree (KEPPRES) No. 55/19932 on \nLand  Acquisition  which  also  specifies  grievance  procedures  for  landowners;  defines  \"public \ninterest\"  for  development  purposes;  separates  private  projects  which  should  use  regular  land \npurchase  arrangements;  places  increased  emphasis  on  community  consultation  and  reaching \nagreement with people affected regarding the form and the amount of compensation; and which \npresents  options  for  compensation  including  substitute  land,  resettlement  and  cash.  The \nRegulation  of  the  State  Minister  of  Agrarian  Affairs  and  National  Land  Agency  No.  1  of  1994 \nspecifies  that  each  Provincial  Governor  addresses  establishment  of  a  Land  Acquisition \nCommittee  or  LAC3 (Panitia  Pengadaan  Tanah)  in  each  kabupaten  (regency/district)  and  kota \n\n                                                 \n2  Presidential Regulation (PERPRES) No. 36/2005 replaces Presidential Decree (KEPPRES) No. 55/1993, for only \n\n21 different categories of public works, and does not include gas transmission pipelines. \n\n3 Comprising: (i) Head of Kabupaten/Municipality (Bupati/Walikota) as Chairman; (ii) Head of Kabupaten/Municipality \nAgrarian/Land  Office  as  Vice  Chair;  (iii)  Head  of  Land  and  Building  Tax  Office;  (iv)  Head  of  local  Public  Works, \nBuildings  Agency;  (v)  Head  of  local  agriculture  (Plantation  &  food  Crops  Agency);  (vi)  Head  of  District  (Camat) \nwhere  project  will  be  build;  (vii)  Head  of  Village  (Lurah);  (viii)  Secretary  of  Bupati/Walikota  as  First  Secretary  of \nCommittee; and (ix) Head of Division in local Land Office as Second Secretary of the Committee. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n    Appendix 7     45 \n\n(municipality)  to  be  chaired  by  the  Bupati  or  Walikota,  and  compensation  is  also  given  to \npersons using land without any titles (Art 20).  The LAC includes representatives of the Level II \nLand Office, Tax Office, Public Works Agency, Agriculture Agency, the heads of the sub-district \nand villages where land acquisition will take place, and two additional members.  Compensation \nis provided at the same replacement rates to all affected persons including holders of hak adat \nor ulayat (customary rights), and also to long-term squatters on government land. \n\n8.  The  policy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  is  set  out  in  the \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995).  PGN  has  also  used  the  ADB  Handbook  on \nResettlement:  A  Guide  to  Good  Practice  (1998)  and  ADB  Handbook  on  Poverty  and  Social \nAnalysis  (2001)  as  guidelines.    PGN\u2019s  framework  for  land  acquisition,  compensation  and \nresettlement regarding gas transmission and distribution project follows KEPPRES No. 55/1993, \nand specifies that compensation for APs will be negotiated based on the latest NJOP (Nilai Jual \nObjek  Pajak,  government  land  value)  and  current  market  value.    The  scope  of  PGN\u2019s  land \nacquisition, compensation and resettlement framework covers compensation for loss of assets \nand  restoration  or  enhancement  of  livelihood  of  all  categories  of  APs  (directly  or  indirectly \naffected,  title  holders  and  non-title  holders)  and  provides  that:  (i)  compensation  and \nrehabilitation provided to APs will be sufficient to reestablish their pre-project standard of living, \nwith  the  prospect  of  improvement;  (ii)  all  APs  will  be  adequately  informed  on  eligibility, \ncompensation rates and standards, livelihood and income restoration plans, and project timing; \nand (iii) no land acquisition will take place prior to satisfactory compensation and resettlement of \nthe APs. \n\nG. \n\nEligibility and Entitlements \n\n9.  Payment  of  cash  compensation,  allowances  and  income  rehabilitation  will  comply  with \nKEPPRES  55/1993  and  is  witnessed  by  the  relevant  LAC  and  monitored  by  a  provincial  level \nmonitoring team. The compensation value for land acquisition is determined by negotiation and \nagreement (musyawarah) on the basis of replacement values, in particular when the Tax Object \nSelling Price (NJOP) is below the market price. The compensation rates used vary for different \nregions, land types, and land productivity. The budgeted amount of cash compensation for land \nacquisition  in  South  Sumatra  and  Lampung  Provinces,  as  of  12  July  2006,  totaled  Rp62.8 \nbillion. Compensation for the 40 structures affected by the Project is based on price estimates \nfrom  PU  (Ministry  of  Public  Works)  and  estimated  at  Rp1.2  billion.  Aside  from  receiving  cash \ncompensation  for  land,  APs  also  received  cash  compensation  for  the  standing  crops  on  the \nproject  affected  lands.  Total  estimated  cash  compensation  for  standing  crops  amounts  to \nRp47.9  billion.  No  social  facility  structures  are  affected  by  the  Project.  Entitlements  are \nsummarized in Table A7. \n\nH. \n\nRelocation of Housing and Settlement \n\n10.  The  selected  onshore  pipeline  alignment  minimizes  the  number  of  structures  affected. \nPGN had offered APs the choice of replacement land and structures and/or cash compensation. \nThis process was officially documented, and to date, all APs have chosen to accept the offer of \ncash  compensation  for  loss  of  land  and  structures.    Hence  in  the  case  of  South  Sumatra  and \nLampung Provinces there is no requirement for resettlement.   \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f46     Appendix 7 \n\nI. \n\nIncome Restoration and Rehabilitation Strategy \n\n11.  The  field  survey,  conducted  in  2004,  anticipated  no  significant  loss  of  assets,  income  or \nlivelihood, or displacement of people due to the Project. The survey found no vulnerable groups. \nThe emphasis is on the provision of adequate compensation to ensure that the economic and \nsocial  future  of  the  APs  is  at  least  as  favorable  as  it  would  have  been  in  the  absence  of  the \nProject.  Separately,  as  part  of  its  corporate  responsibility  program,  PGN  is  implementing  a \ncommunity  development  program  (CDP)  with  an  NGO  (PKBL)  in  the  area  impacted  by  the \nProject.  The  CDP  comprises  (i)  a  partnership  program  with  small  scale  business  enterprises; \nand (ii) a community empowerment program. Aside from PKBL, PGN has also implemented a \nCDP  based  on  the  need  assessment4 of  people  in  the  affected  villages.  The  ultimate  goal  of \nCDP activities is to contribute to the growth of the village economies. Funding for the programs \nis allocated from PGN\u2019s profit.5 \n\nJ. \n\nBudget and Financing \n\n12.  The  total  budget  for  implementation  of  the  LARP  is  estimated  at  Rp161  billion.    Land \npurchase  in  South  Sumatra  (in  Lampung  and  South  Sumatra  provinces)  is  the  largest \ncomponent,  accounting  for  Rp62.8  billion  while  cash  compensation  for  trees  and  crops  is  the \nsecond  largest  component,  at  Rp47.9  billion.  The  estimated  cost  of  the  acquisition  of  land  in \nWest Java is Rp17.7 billion. PGN will provide all funding for implementation of the LARP from its \nown cash resources.  \n\nK. \n\nImplementation Schedules \n\n13.  PGN will implement a control and monitoring process to ensure that the APs receive the \ncompensation  satisfactorily  before  pipeline  construction  activity  starts  in  a  particular  area. \nInternal and external monitoring will be conducted by PGN and a third party consultant for the \nProject  from  March  2004  until  December  2007.  As  of  30  June  2006,  land  acquisition  and \ncompensation  activities  in  the  Lampung6 province  have  been  completed.    Meanwhile  for  the \nprovince of South Sumatra, two out of a total of six affected7 regencies have been completed.  \nThe remaining four regencies which are located along the Grissik to Pagardewa segment of the \npipeline are expected to be completed by August 2006.   \n\nL. \n\nOrganizational Framework for Land Acquisition and Resettlement  \n\n14.  The overall responsibility for the enforcement of the policy framework and the planning and \nimplementation of the LARP lies with PGN. The Project Coordinator from PGN will maintain a \nclose liaison with the local authorities, representatives of APs and NGOs.  At the local level, the \nlocal authorities with PGN will have  the responsibility for all LARP activities including surveys, \nconsultation and negotiation with the APs and acting through the LAC.  The Project Coordinator \nmakes  special  efforts  to  maintain  good  community  relationships,  and  resolve  compensation \nproblems  and  complaints  including  the  active  and  effective  participation  of  the  APs  in  the \npreparation and implementation of LARP. The Project Coordinator monitors the Project activities \nand prepares reports for PGN\u2019s Director of Development and Director of Finance.  \n\n                                                 \n4 Need assessment is a survey conducted to identify potentials of the affected villages to ensure that CDP activities \n\nare efficient, on-target and enduring. \n\n5  For 2006 total funding allocated for PKBL is 1.5% of previous year\u2019s profit. \n6  Covering four affected regencies : Waykanan, TUBA, Lampung Tengah and Lampung Timur. \n7 OKU  Induk  and  OKI  Timur  are  completed,  MUBA,  Banyuasin,  Muaraenim  and  Prabumulih  are  expected  to  be \n\ncompleted in August 2006. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n    Appendix 7     47 \n\nM. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n15.  Monitoring  and  supervision  of  the  LARP  implementation  involves  internal  monitoring  and \nexternal monitoring. The third party consultants monitor and evaluate the LARP implementation. \nMonitoring will consist of (i) random review of documents on acquisition and compensation, to \nensure  full  compliance  with  the  policy\u2019s  requirements;  (ii)  random  site  visits  to  ensure  that \ncompensation has been duly paid prior to the start up of construction works, its compliance to \nthe  principle  of  replacement  cost  and  grievances;  (iii)  special  studies  about  the  adequacy  of \ncompensation paid for APs loss of assets compared to current market prices; (iv) periodic field \nvisits  and  surveys  to  assess  the  public  consultation  concerning  with  project  activities;  and  (v) \nperiodic field visits to assess grievance procedures and the solution of land disputes, if any. \n\n16.  PGN progress activities report provides information in terms of internal/routine monitoring \nand  reports  on  (i)  status  of  payment  of  compensation  on  a  timely  basis  and  to  the  agreed \namount; (ii) status of payment of compensation to all eligible APs, and only to eligible persons; \n(iii) planning and implementation of income and livelihood restoration measures that has been \nagreed  in  the  entitlement  matrix  and  as  per  budget;  (iv)  assessment  of  progress  on  income \nrestoration and maintaining / improving on pre-project standards of living; and (v) inspection of \nthe complaints registered and actions taken for resolution if there are conflicts. \n\n17.  The  monitoring  reports  by  third  party  consultants  will  be  sent  as  (i)  an  Inception  Report \nsubmitted to the project authorities within one month of beginning of the assignment, and (ii) six \nmonthly reports to the project authorities and the lending institutions.  \n\n \n\n\f48     Appendix 7 \n\nType of \nLoss \nLoss of \nagriculture \nland \n\nEntitled \nPerson \n\nFarmers who \ncultivate the \nland \n\nLoss of \nresidential \nland \n\nLegal occupant \nof the land with \ncertification \nfrom relevant \nauthority \n\nLoss of \nstructure \n\nLegal owner of \nthe structure \n\nTenants and \nillegal \noccupants   \n\nLoss of \nstanding \ncrops \n\nFarmers who \ncultivate the \nland \n\nTable A7: Entitlement Matrix \n \n\nCompensation Policy \n\nImplementation Issues \n\nProvide equivalent nearby \nCash compensation at \nreplacement cost \nIf only partial land is affected \nbut the remaining become \neconomically unviable, the \nAPs will be entitled to get \ncash compensation for entire \nland at full replacement cost. \n \nIf remaining land is enough \nto absorb APs, replacement \nland will be provided within \nthe community. \nIf remaining area is not \nenough an alternative house \nplot or equivalent will be \noffered.  \nCash compensation at \nreplacement cost \n \n(i)  Cash compensation at \nmarket price. \n(ii)    Transport allowance for \nrelocated APs. \n \nReceive assistance for \nrelocating and replacement \ncost for any structure that \nthey have erected. \n \nCompensation in kind for \ncrops based on productivity \nof the land in the past  \n\nA list of available land in each \naffected community is required \nAssistance to farmers to \ndevelop new crops and improve \nproduction \nReplacement cost will be \ndetermined by local \ngovernment \n\nThe value of the new site has to \nbe equivalent but not less than \nthe value of the current property \nof APs.

During the survey, the \namount and type of structures \nneeded will be evaluated.  \nb.  Cash compensation will be \nbased on market price and \nnegotiation between PGN and \nAPs. \n\nPrices of agriculture products in \nlocal market will be checked for \ncomparison. \nAPs will be given written notice \nseveral months in advance of \nactual land acquisition.
