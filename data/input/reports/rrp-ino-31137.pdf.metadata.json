The  Project  will  also  support\ndecentralization  of  basic  education  management  in  the  context  of  the\nadministrative and fiscal decentralization being effected in Indonesia.\n\nClassification\n\nPoverty:   Core poverty intervention\nThematic: Human development\n\nEnvironmental\nAssessment\n\nCategory  C.  Environmental  implications  were  reviewed,  and  no\nsignificant adverse environmental impacts were identified.\n\nRationale\n\nObjectives\nand Scope\n\nThe  National  Development  Plan  (PROPENAS)  of  the  Government\nand the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country operational strategy\nprioritize  poverty  reduction  and  regional  equity.  Achieving  and\nsustaining  these  goals  require  equitable  provision  of  quality  basic\neducation  to  set  a  foundation  (i)  to  reduce  existing  gaps  in  human\ndevelopment  across  the  country,  and  (ii)  to  ensure  the  availability  of\ntrainable  human \nto  support  social  and  economic\ndevelopment.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  these  strategic  goals\nthrough (i) focused investment in basic education targeted to poverty-\naffected areas, schools, and children; and (ii) improved management\nand  governance  of  basic  education  through  decentralization,  and\nmeasures  for  a  transparent  basic  education  system,  accountable  to\ncommunities and civil society.\n\nresources \n\nThe broad goals of the Project are to contribute to (i) reducing poverty\nand inequity in human development by supporting the achievement of\nuniversal basic education, and (ii) implementing regional autonomy by\nsupporting  decentralized  management  of  basic  education.  The\nimmediate  objectives  are  (i)  to  improve  poor  children\u2019s  participation,\ncompletion,  and  learning  outcome  from  nine  years  basic  education,\n(ii) to develop the capacity of districts to manage decentralized basic\neducation; this includes support to establish school boards and make\nthem  operational  as  well  as  enhance  school  committees  for  greater\ncommunity participation in community or school-based management;\nand (iii) to demonstrate the effectiveness of block grant mechanisms\nto support school, community, and district-based initiatives to improve\nbasic education and enhance school effectiveness.\n\nCost Estimates\n\nThe  estimated  Project  cost  is  $125.0  million  equivalent,  of  which\n$30.9  million  (25  percent)  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $94.1\nmillion equivalent (75 percent) is the local currency cost.\n\nFinancing Plan\n\n    \n\n        ($ million)\n\n\fPeriod of Utilization\n\nUntil 31 December 2008\n\nExecuting Agency\n\nLoan Amount\nand Terms\n\nImplementation\nArrangements\n\nProcurement\n\niii\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n100.0\n\n25.0\n\nPercent\n\n80\n\n20\n\n78.9\n\n25.0\n\nAsian\nDevelopment Bank\nGovernment\n\n21.1\n\n0.0\n\n21.1\n\nTotal\n\n103.9\n\n125.0\n\n100.0\n\nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  various  currencies\nequivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  77,579,000  from  its  Special\nFunds  resources  (ADF).  The  loan  will  have  a  term  of  32  years,\nincluding  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  with  an  interest  charge  of  1\npercent  per  year  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per  year\nthereafter. ADB will finance 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost\nof the Project and 73 percent of the local cost. The Government will\nfinance about $25.0 million equivalent in local currency.\n\nMinistry  of  National  Education  (MONE).  The  Ministry  of  Religious\nAffairs  (MORA) will be co-Executing  Agency  and  will  second  staff  to\nthe  central  facilitation  unit  (CFU),  provincial  project  monitoring  units\n(PPMU),  and  district  project  management  and  monitoring  units\n(DPMMU) to ensure integration and equitable treatment of madrasah\n(Islamic schools) catering to poor children.\n\nThe Implementing Agencies will be the district governments of the 21\ndistricts  covered  by  the  Project.  District  project  management  and\nmonitoring  units  (DPMMU)  will  be  established  in  each  district.  The\nDPMMUs  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  planning,  management,\nand implementation of Project activities.\n\nAll  ADB-financed  procurement  for  the  Project  will  follow  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement. Each  contract  for  the  supply  of  goods,\nequipment,  and  furniture  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $500,000\nequivalent  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive\nbidding  (ICB)  procedures,  while  contract  packages  of  $500,000\nequivalent or less will follow international shopping, local competitive\nbidding (LCB), direct purchase (DP) procedures, or local procedures\nas applicable.\n\nThe  Project  will  support  the  rehabilitation  of  school  facilities  that  do\nnot meet the minimum conditions for learning. It is estimated that the\nProject will support rehabilitation of approximately 1,400 primary and\njunior  secondary  schools.  Considering  the  small  unit  costs  of  civil\nworks  (maximum of $12,000 per school), mainly  in  remote  and  rural\nsites  with  associated  difficulties  in  material  delivery,  rehabilitation\nworks are unlikely to attract international or domestic contractors and\nsuppliers  at  the  national  level.  In  addition,  experience  indicates  that\n\n\fiv\n\ncommunity-managed rehabilitation ensures greater transparency and\naccountability,  cost-effectiveness  (36  percent \nthan\ncontractor-managed or implemented rehabilitation), stronger sense of\nownership  and  better  facility  maintenance  by  the  communities.\nTherefore,  beneficiary  schools  and  communities  will  procure  civil\nworks  for  school  rehabilitation  and  school  furniture  (both  labor  and\nmaterials) locally through procedures acceptable to ADB.\n\nless  costly \n\nThe Project will procure a small amount of office equipment such as\ncomputers for administration and data processing and management,\nand vehicles for the CFU, PPMUs, and DPMMU. Each package is\nestimated to cost less than $50,000 and will be procured under DP\nprocedures showing evidence of limited local tender to obtain the\nmost competitive prices. As districts have slightly different\nrequirements and begin project implementation in phases, equipment\nwill be packaged and procured by district in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement.\n\nThe  Project  will  finance  the  purchase  of  textbooks  and  other\nteaching/learning  materials  through  the  School  Development  Fund\n(SDF)  school  improvement  category.    Actual  requirements  will  be\ndetermined  by  each  school,  but  will  not  exceed  $6,000  per  school.\nSchools  will  select  and  purchase  textbooks  and  materials,  using  DP\nshowing  evidence  of  limited  local \ntender  to  obtain  the  most\ncompetitive  prices.    The  choice  of  DP  was  based  on  lessons  from\npast  or  ongoing  projects  indicating  that  consolidated  purchase\nthrough LCB does not result in economy of scale or timely provision\nof textbooks and teaching/learning aids. Delivery of centrally procured\nmaterials by contracted forwarders is not cost-effective or reliable for\nremote  and  rural  schools,  and  school  and  community-managed\npurchase and delivery are more likely to ensure timely and complete\ndelivery.\n\nConsultants  will  be  required  for:  (i)  district  capacity  building  and\nimplementation support (Package A), and (ii) independent monitoring\nand  evaluation  (Package  B).  Package  A  will  comprise  one\ninternational  consultant \n(12  person-months)  and  46  domestic\nconsultants  (1,656  person-months).  Package  B  will  comprise  one\ninternational consultant (24 person-months), 26 domestic consultants\n(456  person-months),  and  about  300  test  administrators.  A  large\nnumber of domestic consultants are required because of the Project\u2019s\nemphasis  on  capacity  building,  independent  monitoring,  and  district\nand  school-based  project  implementation.  A  separate  package  of\nmentoring  services  will  be  provided  under  the  SDF  component.  The\nmentoring  services  will  comprise  one  international  consultant  (24\nperson-months),  13  domestic  consultants  (684  person-months),  and\nabout 85 domestic community level mentors to work directly with the\nschools  and  the  communities.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  and\nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of\nConsultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB for engaging\ndomestic consultants. On 21 May 2001, ADB Management approved\n\nConsulting Services\n\n\fEstimated Project\nCompletion Date\n\n30 June 2008\n\nProject Benefits and\nBeneficiaries\n\nv\n\nretroactive financing and advance action for recruiting consultants to\npermit  their  timely  fielding  for  effective  project  implementation.  The\nProject also provides for retroactive financing of eligible expenditures\nincurred  not  earlier  than  9  July  2001  (date  of  the  first  day  of\nappraisal), for a maximum of $2,000,000 equivalent. The Government\nhas  been  advised  that  such  advance  action  and  the  provision  for\nretroactive  financing  do  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  any  part  of  the\nProject.\n\nThe  Project  almost  exclusively  targets  children  from  poor  families.\nThe Project is estimated to benefit a total of 1.26 million primary and\nsecondary school children (ages 7-12 and 13-15 years, respectively)\nin the 21 Project districts.  Of this number, 0.896 million children (71\npercent  of  the  total  beneficiaries)  are  estimated  to  be  from  families\nliving below the poverty line. The Project will benefit about 5 percent\nof  all  school-age  children  in  Jakarta,  29  percent  in  Bali,  and  64\npercent in NTB.  Beneficiary children in Jakarta will consist largely of\nthose  residing  in  slum  areas.    Beneficiary  children  in  Bali  are\npredominantly  in  the  northern  districts  with  a  high  concentration  of\npoor tenant farming and fishing communities.\n\nin \n\nfamilies \n\nBy  targeting  poor  children  and  using  poverty  indicators  in  the\nselection  criteria  for  beneficiary  schools,  the  Project  is  expected  to\ngenerate  direct  benefits  for  children  from  below  the  poverty  line  and\nthe  children  will  have\ntwo  ways:  (i) \nlow-income \nopportunities  to  obtain  and  complete  primary  and  junior  secondary\neducation  by  having  access  to  scholarships,  school  fee  waivers,\ntutorials,  and  other  support;  and  (ii)  their  completion  of  junior\nsecondary education will improve their marketability in the job market\nor give them opportunities to continue their formal education. At least\n50 percent of the beneficiaries of the scholarship and other school aid\nprograms  will  be  children  from  families  below  the  poverty  line.  Net\nenrollment  and  completion  rates  will  increase  among  the  children\nfrom families below the poverty line.  Benefit evaluation studies during\nthe  fourth  and  seventh  years  of  project  implementation  will  allow\nmonitoring of increased primary school completion, transition to junior\nsecondary schools, junior secondary school completion, labor market\nabsorption or entry into higher education.\n\nThe  Project  will  improve  the  beneficiary  schools\u2019  ability  to  deliver\nbasic education, and meet the needs of low-income and poor families\nfor  quality  education  through  better  on-site  targeting  and  direct\nparent-school  communication.  The  indicators  for  such  improvements\ninclude (i) attendance of communities in participatory processes to be\nsupported  in  the  school  based  management  (SBM)  subcomponent;\n(ii) budget allocations for scholarships and other school aid from the\nSDF  subcomponent  to  beneficiary  schools;  (iii)  scores  reflecting\n\n\fvi\n\nschool  efficiency  and  quality  of  education  services;  and  (iv)  reduced\nrepetition and dropout rates among students.\n\nPreliminary  estimates  during  Project  preparation  indicate  that  about\n3,000 schools clustered in poor communities in 17 districts will qualify\nfor  assistance  through  the  SDF  subcomponent,  and  an  additional\n115,000  children  from  poor  households  in  all  21  districts  will  receive\nsupport through the social equity program under the district education\ndevelopment  fund  (DEDF)  subcomponent.  Target  schools  serve\nabout 56-78 percent of students from poor families. Methodologically,\nmore accurate projections are not possible as the as specific project\nsites  and  beneficiary  schools  can  only  be  determined  during  Project\nimplementation,  on  the  basis  of  thorough  socioeconomic  surveys  to\naccurately  capture  the  geographic  distribution  and  concentration  of\npoverty.  Nevertheless,  the  special  support  for  poor  children  and  the\ntargeting  criteria  for  beneficiary  school  selection  will  ensure  that  the\nProject  covers  children  from  households  below  the  poverty  line  and\nthat at least 50 percent of the total beneficiaries of scholarships and\nother support will come from poor families. Children from low-income\nbut non-poor families will also be eligible to receive special assistance\nif  they  are  otherwise  unable  to  attend  school.  In  this  manner,  the\nProject  is  designed  to  address  poverty  using  income  as  well  as  non\nincome aspects of social deprivation among families with school-age\nchildren. Through this broader interpretation of social deprivation, the\nProject  will  also  contribute  to  the  national  objective  of  providing\nuniversal access to basic education.\n\nThe  Project  risks  are  largely  attributable  to  the  combination  of  the\ndecentralized implementation arrangements and intended targeting of\npoverty-affected  areas.  The  key  risks  are  (i)  decentralized  Project\nimplementation  context;  (ii)  challenges  exacerbated  by  the  Project\u2019s\nattempts  to  reach  the  poorest  communities  and  schools,  which  are\noften  remote  and  hard  to  reach;  and  (iii)  heavy  involvement  of\nconsultants.\n\nIn  the  context  of  the  decentralization  laws,  the  Project  will  be\nimplemented by local (district) governments. Most of the districts have\nsome  degree  of  experience  in  implementing  investment  projects  in\nthe  social  sectors  financed  by  either  ADB  or  the  World  Bank.\nNevertheless, each district government is at the developmental stage,\nand  a  series  of  system,  organizational,  and  staff  changes  are\nanticipated  during  the  course  of  Project  implementation.  In  addition,\nvariations are expected in the organizational structure and systems in\neach  district,  including  their  relationships  with  the  provincial  and\nnational governments. To safeguard against risks associated with the\nnewly decentralized administrative context, the Project (i) integrates a\nmajor  capacity-building  component;  (ii)  emphasizes  direct  resource\ntransfer to, and involvement of, schools and communities, the stable\ndelivery point of basic education services; and (iii) employs a process\n\nProject Risks\n\n\fvii\n\noriented  design  to  maintain  maximum  flexibility  and  adaptability  to\nevolving  circumstances.  Implementation  will  take  longer  than  usual,\nanticipating  slow  start-up  and  low  disbursement  during  the  first  few\nyears. Districts will begin implementation in phases. Undue pressure\non fast disbursement during the first years would undermine the need\nto build sufficient and accountable project implementation capacity.\n\nThe Project targets poor areas that are often remote, difficult to reach,\nand  where  the  capacity  of  the  schools  and  communities  is  limited.\nThe  building  capacity    of  schools  and  communities  is  a  prerequisite\nbefore development activities and resource flows start. Such capacity\nbuilding  in  difficult-to-reach  areas  will  require  on-site  and  ongoing\ntechnical  support  that  is  not  threatening  to  local  communities.  The\nProject  plans  to  engage  a  large  number  of  community-worker  type\nconsultants  that  can  be  best  provided  through  nongovernment\norganizations  (NGOs)  and  community-based  organizations  (CBOs).\nWhile on-going projects have had positive results, use of NGOs and\nCBOs is not yet a common practice in Indonesia.  Similarly, capacity-\nbuilding  support  that  must  take  place  at  the  district  level  and\nrequirements  for  independent  monitors  and  auditors  will  involve  a\nlarge number of consultants. General experience to date in Indonesia\nindicates  that  the  Government  needs  considerable  lead  time  to\nengage  loan-financed  consultants;  this  may  take  even  longer  if  the\nProject requires new types of service providers. To minimize the risk\nof implementation becoming consultant-led and to ensure localization\nof  Project  experience,  (i)  the  Project  will  primarily  use  domestic\nconsultants  associated  with  a  minimum  number  of  international\nconsultants,  and \nfor  SBM  and  decentralization/\nimplementation  support  consultants  will  pair  off  with  government\ncounterpart teams.  To ensure timely engagement, ADB management\nhas endorsed advance action and retroactive financing for consulting\nservices.\n\n(ii)  mentors \n\n\fv\n\ni\ni\ni\n\n\fI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  a  proposed\n\n1.\nloan to the Republic of Indonesia for the Decentralized Basic Education Project.\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nIn 1997, the Government of Indonesia requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to\nsupport the improvement of basic education in the provinces of Bali and Nusa Tenggara Barat\n(NTB)  and  the  Special  Capital  Region  (DKI)  Jakarta.  The  Government  selected  these  places\nconsidering  gaps  in  basic  education  provision  in  those  areas  as  well  as  the  regional\ndemarcation  between  ADB  and  the  World  Bank.1  ADB  approved  (1998)  a  small-scale  project\npreparatory  technical  assistance  (TA),2  but  project  preparation  was  suspended  to  prioritize\ntimely responses to the economic crisis and to observe political and administrative changes that\nfollowed  the  crisis.  In  2000,  the  Government  and  ADB  agreed  to  resume  project  preparation.\nThe Government requested that the Decentralized Basic Education Project (DBEP) support the\nprocess  of  decentralizing  basic  education  management,  in  the  context  of  Law  22/1999  on\nRegional  Governance  and  Law  25/1999  on  Fiscal  Decentralization.  The  Government  further\nrequested  that  the  DBEP  build  on  accomplishments  of  the  ADB-funded  crisis  response\nprogram,  the  Social  Protection  Sector  Development  Program  (SPSDP).3  Subsequently,  ADB\napproved a small-scale TA4 to redesign the DBEP to suit the new context. This report is based\non the findings of the Loan Appraisal Mission5 conducted during 6-26 July 2001 and earlier ADB\nmissions,  consultation  with  project  beneficiaries,  reports  prepared  by  the  TA  consultants,\ndiscussions  with  the  central  and  local  governments,  and  discussions  with  international\nassistance agencies. The project framework is given in Appendix 1.\n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA. \n\nSector Description\n\n1. \n\nSocioeconomic Context\n\nIndonesia has experienced considerable upheaval in recent years, and the processes of\n3.\npolitical and economic transformation are still ongoing. The country is ethnically diverse, and the\ndistribution  of  poverty  is  uneven.  Natural  resources,  climate,  and  local  cultures  vary  widely\namong the regions, as does the potential for economic growth and poverty reduction.\n\n4.\nPrior  to  the  economic  crisis,  the  annual  growth  of  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)\nexceeded  7  percent  for  over  two  decades.6  Indonesia  made  substantial  progress  in  human\nimproved  basic  social  services  and\ndevelopment  as \n\nthe  Government  expanded  and \n\n                                                          \n1 The World Bank is supporting basic education projects in the provinces of Sumatra, West Java, East Java, Central\nJava,  Nusa  Tenggara  Timur,  Kalimantan,  and  Sulawesi,  and  is  also  preparing  a  new  basic  education  project\ncovering South and West Sumatra and East Java.\n\n2 TA 3007-INO: Basic Education in Bali and Nusa Tengara Barat Project, for $150,000, approved on 16 April 1998.\n3 Loan  1622-INO:  Social Protection Sector Development Program,  for  $100  million;  and  Loan  1623-INO:  Social\n\nProtection Sector Development Project, for $200 million, approved on 9 July 1998.\n\n4 TA 3456-INO: Preparation of Decentralized Basic Education Project, for $150,000, approved on 14 June 2000.\n5 The  Mission  comprised  I.  Matsumoto,  Senior  Education  Specialist/Mission  Leader;  C.  Gregory,  Senior  Project\nSpecialist;  S.  Chowdhury,  Senior  Programs  Officer;  K.  Emzita,  Counsel;  S.  Handayani,  Social  Development\nSpecialist, and A. Inagaki, Education Specialist. Fiscal decentralization and implications on the local budget were\nexamined  during  loan  fact-finding  by  N.  Usui,  Economist.  The  Appraisal  mission  was  assisted  by  F.  Munger,\nCapacity  Building  Specialist/Staff  Consultant;  J.  Wood,  Teacher  Development  Specialist/Staff  Consultant;  and  S.\nKataoka, Financial Analyst/Staff Consultant.\n\n6 ADB 2001, Indonesia: Country Assistance Strategy, March.\n\n\f2\n\ninfrastructure.  Education,  health,  family  planning,  and  nutrition  indicators  improved,  as  did\naccess  to  water  and  sanitation  services.  However,  notable  regional  variations  remain  in  the\nproportion and absolute number of the poor. The economic crisis severely affected Indonesia,\nand eroded the social and economic development gains achieved since the mid-1970s. Poverty\nincidence rose to 24.2 percent, a nearly 50 percent increase from 1996 to 1998. While the crisis\nhit  urban  areas  the  hardest  (the  urban  poverty  rate  increased  by  60  percent),  the\ninterdependence of urban and rural economies also brought a rise in poverty in the rural areas\n(where the poverty rate increased by 30 percent).7 The crisis hit the delivery of social services,\nincluding basic education. Government expenditure on education declined in real terms. School\nincomes fell considerably, as many parents had to delay or stop paying fees.\n\n5.\nThe  national  output  data  at  the  end  of  1999  confirmed  the  recovery  of  the  Indonesian\neconomy  from  the  crisis,  and  this  trend  continued  through  2001.  The  recent  official\nmeasurement of poverty indicated that transient poverty triggered by the crisis began to reverse\nby  mid-1999,  along  with  a  slow  rise  in  nominal  wages  and  price  deflation,  particularly  of  rice.\nThe poverty rate has returned to near pre-crisis levels of 18.2 percent (15.1 percent urban and\n20.2  percent  rural).  Nevertheless,  following  the  crisis,  the  depth  of  poverty,  i.e.,  the  average\namount of income required to raise the poor above the poverty line, increased in all provinces.\nThe intensity or severity of poverty also increased. This meant an increase in the proportion of\nthe  ultra  poor.  At  the  broadest  level,  the  pattern  of  the  geographic  distribution  of  poverty  in\nIndonesia has been one of steady improvement across most of the country, with the exception\nof the eastern part, including NTB.\n\n2. \n\nBasic Education\n\n6.\nThe education system in Indonesia consists of preschool, primary education (grades 1 to\n6),  junior  secondary  education  (grades  7-9),  senior  secondary  education  (grades  10-12),  and\ntertiary education (Appendix 2). Basic education covers nine years of compulsory primary and\njunior  secondary  education.  The  success  of  the  Government\u2019s  supply-side  approach  to  the\neducation sector\u2019s development resulted in rapid growth in the number of primary schools since\nthe 1970s. This success brought about a fast rise in primary net enrollment rate (NER)8 from 60\npercent  in  1971  to  92.6  percent  in  1999,9  although  NER  rates  vary  depending  on  the  data\nsource. In 1994, Indonesia established a goal to achieve universal nine-year basic education by\n2003.10  The  junior  secondary  NER  improved  considerably  between  1993  and  1999,  from  46.7\npercent  to  54.8  percent,11  and  did  not  decline  during  the  crisis,  indicating  the  positive\ncontribution  of  the  scholarship  and  block  grants  programs  accompanied  by  extensive  social\nmarketing to prevent dropouts that ADB initiated during the crisis (SPSDP).\n\n7.\nPrivate schools enroll 41 percent of students at the junior secondary level. All public and\nprivate  primary  and  junior  secondary  schools  share  a  common  core  curriculum  known  as\nCurriculum  1994.12  The  size  and  diversity  of  the  clientele  strains  the  basic  education  system,\n\n                                                          \n7 ADB 2000, Poverty Assessment in Indonesia, October.\n8 The  primary  net  enrollment  rate  (NER)  refers  to  the  percentage  of  students  7-12  years  old  enrolled  in  primary\nschools against the total school-age population (7-12 years); junior secondary NER concerns children 13-15 years\nold. The data was drawn from the National Socioeconomic Survey (SUSENAS).\n\n9 SUSENAS, 1999.\n10  The  Government  has  deferred  the  target  year  to  2010,  considering  the  effects  of  the  crisis  on  the  government\n\nbudget.\n\n11 Ministry of National Education, Jakarta 2000.

Curriculum 1994 aims to prepare the students for further education, and also to develop in\nthe individual the basic knowledge, skills, and attitude to become a productive member of society. Curriculum 1994\nreserves 20 percent of class time for local content such as the local dialect, arts and crafts, and local environmental\nconcerns.\n\n\f3\n\nwhich caters to more than 38 million children in the world\u2019s fourth largest multiethnic and multi-\nlanguage country, across 14,000 islands spread across 4,000 kilometers.\n\n8.\nPrior  to  the  economic  crisis,  education  expenditures  in  Indonesia  rose  steadily  but\nremained relatively low compared with those of neighboring countries. Education expenditures\n(1995-1997)  averaged  2.3  percent  of  GDP  and  12.3  percent  of  the  total  Government\nexpenditures  (Appendix  3).  During  the  same  period,  the  Government  expenditures  on  primary\nand  junior  secondary  education  rose  by  33  and  44  percent,  respectively.  The  expenditures\nincluded subsidies to private primary and junior secondary schools (e.g., provision of teachers\nand  administrators).  During  the  crisis,  education  expenditures  declined  to  8.5  percent  of  total\nGovernment expenditures (1998), recovering slightly to 9.6 percent of Government expenditure\nin  1999.  Education  expenditures  as  a  percentage  of  GDP  dropped  from  2.1  percent  (1997)  to\n1.7  percent  (1998),  then  rose  slightly  to  1.9  percent  (1999).  The  share  of  basic  education\nexpenditures in the total Government expenditures decreased during the crisis from 8.4 percent\n(1995)  to  5.9  percent  (1998).  Yet,  intrasectoral  allocation  to  basic  education  within  education\nexpenditures  was  well  protected,  and  the  share  of  basic  education  in  total  education\nexpenditure  increased  from  67.6  percent  (1995)  to  71.5  percent  (1999).13  This  attests  to  a\npositive  effect  of  the  financial  support  and  the  policy  framework  agreed  upon  through  the\nSPSDP.\n\nEffective January 2001, management and financing of basic education14 were devolved\n9. \nto  district  governments.  Prior  to  decentralization,  basic  education  was  managed  centrally\nthrough  complex  and  compartmentalized  structures  in  three  ministries:  Ministry  of  National\nEducation  (MONE),  Ministry  of  Religious  Affairs,  (MORA),  and  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs\n(MOHA). MONE was responsible for overall planning, coordination, and regulation for education\nat  all  levels,  and  directly  administered  and  financed  public  junior  secondary  education.  MOHA\nadministered and delivered public primary education (teacher management, establishment and\nmaintenance of primary schools, and provision of subsidies to private primary schools). MORA\nadministered and financed public primary and junior secondary madrasah (Islamic school), and\nsupervised  and  provided  financial  assistance  to  private  madrasah.  This  three-ministry  system\nwas replicated at provincial and district levels where each ministry was represented in parallel\nby local offices. Paralleling this complex management structure, basic education budgeting and\nfinancing  involved  five  ministries:  MONE,  MORA,  MOHA,  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  and  the\nNational  Development  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS),  with  a  mix  of  financing  arrangements\nand funds sources for each type and level of school.\n\n10. With  decentralization,  district  governments  became  responsible  for  planning,  financing,\nmanaging,  and  delivering  basic  education.  Their  responsibilities  also  cover  school  staff\nappointment,  transfer,  and  school  location  planning.  The  central  Government  establishes\npolicies,  the  national  curriculum,  a  national  examination/assessment  system;  and  sets\nstandards for (i) achievement at each age; (ii) learning materials; (iii) acceptance, transfer, and\ncertification  of  students;  and  (iv)  learning  time  for  basic  education  and  fixing  the  educational\ncalendar.  The  central  Government  sets  standards  and  procedures  for  staff  appointment,\nremoval,  dismissal;  determines  pension,  salary  and  benefits,  rights  and  obligations;  and  the\nlegal  status  of  civil  servants  and  regional  civil  servants  including  teachers  and  principals.\nProvincial governments (i) define policy on student selection and acceptance including equity for\nminority  students,  students  from  poor  families  and  remote  areas;  (ii)  provide  instructional\nmaterials  for  basic  education;  (iii)  assist  in  higher  education  management,  curriculum\nproduction,  accreditation,  staff  appointment,  opening  and  closing  of  colleges;  and  (iv)  manage\nspecial  institutions,  including  training  centers,  teacher  training  institutions,  and  special\n\n                                                          \n13 Source: Statistical Office of the Ministry of Finance.\n14 Preschools and senior secondary education (including vocational/technical) were also devolved.\n\n\f4\n\neducation.  In  addition,  provincial  governments  may  effect  interdistrict  transfer  of  civil  servants\nincluding  school  principals  and  teachers,  and  their  transfer  between  districts  or  cities  and\nprovinces and vice versa.\n\n11.\nTo  absorb  the  devolved  responsibilities,  district  governments  are  undergoing  major\nreorganization.  District  government  structures  vary  but  all  include  an  executive  body  with  an\nelected head and a legislative body or local parliament (DPRD). The local development planning\nagency  (BAPPEDA)  is  responsible  for  overall  development  planning,  including  development\nstrategies  and  budget  planning  for  the  devolved  sectors.  BAPPEDA\u2019s  Office  for  Social  and\nCultural Affairs is responsible for planning for development and monitoring performance of the\nbasic  education  sector.  Sector  offices  within  the  district  government  are  responsible  for  daily\nmanagement  and  administration  of  the  devolved  sectors,  including  education.  These  sector\noffices replace the former district offices of the line ministries.\n\n12.\nFiscal decentralization changed the financing arrangements for education, and replaced\nthe  past  system  that  earmarked  central  Government  grants  for  sector-specific  routine  and\ndevelopment budgets (Appendix 4). Under the new system, the central Government transfers to\nprovinces  and  districts  (i)  a  portion  of  shared  revenues  (including  land  and  property  taxes,\nduties on land and property transfer, personal income tax, and nontax revenues from forestry,\nmining,  oil,  gas,  and  fishery);  and  (ii)  block  grants  from  a  General  Allocation  Fund15  set  at  a\nminimum of 25 percent of the total domestic revenue of the central Government; and (iii) grants\nfrom a Special Allocation Fund earmarked for specific purposes. District governments determine\nthe  allocation  of  both  shared  revenues  and  block  grants  from  the  General  Allocation  Fund  to\nrecurrent  and  development  expenditures  across  the  11  devolved  public  service  sectors,  in\nprinciple,  in  accordance  with  their  development  priorities.  However,  for  the  foreseeable  future,\nrecurrent expenditure patterns (particularly personnel) will reflect the patterns inherited from the\ncentralized  system.  This  applies  especially  to  the  education  sector,  as  it  employs  a  large\nnumber  of  civil  servants,  particularly  teachers.  The  level  of  basic  education  financing,\nparticularly  the  development  budget,  will  be  determined  by  both  the  financial  capacity  of  each\ndistrict government and by the relative priority assigned to basic education.\n\n3. \n\nKey Subsector Issues\n\n13.\nPost  decentralization  Indonesia  presents  an  opportunity  to  refocus  on  long-standing\neducation  sector  issues:  (i)  equity  and  quality  of  service  provision,  and  (ii)  efficiency  and\neffectiveness of management and financing.\n\na. \n\nEquity\n\n14.\nThe  impressive  rise  in  access  to  basic  education  masks  the  considerable  disparity\nbetween regions and income groups in access to quality primary education and to any form of\njunior secondary education. To reduce inequity, attention and resource allocation must focus on\n(i) provinces and districts with higher incidence of poverty; (ii) pockets of economically, socially,\nand  culturally  disadvantaged  communities  within  better  developed  provinces  and  districts;  and\n(iii) private primary and junior secondary schools that cater to poor communities and children.\n\n15.\nPoor Children\u2019s Access to Quality Basic Education. Achievement of universal basic\neducation  in  Indonesia  requires  concerted  efforts  to  boost  enrollment  and  completion  of  basic\neducation  for  low-income  children  by  addressing  not  only  poorer  provinces  and  districts,  but\nalso poverty pockets within relatively better-off areas. The national aggregate primary NER was\n\n                                                          \n15 The General Allocation Fund is allocated through a formula based on (i) population, land area, and poverty index;\n\nand (ii) economic potential, including revenue-raising capacity.\n\n\f5\n\n92.6  percent  in1999,  yet  the  NER  differed  by  more  than  13  percent  between  the  highest  and\nlowest provinces (94.6 percent in North Sumatra and 80.9 percent in Irian Jaya).16 The variation\nin  junior  secondary  NER  is  even  wider,  with  a  gap  of  42.7  percent  between  the  highest  and\nlowest  (77.6  percent  in  DKI  Jakarta  and  34.9  percent  in  NTB).  Six  provinces  fell  below  the\nnational  average  primary  NER  and  13  provinces  fell  below  the  national  average  junior\nsecondary NER. Provincial NER ranking generally correlates with provincial poverty ranking.\n\n16.\nThe  NER  within  a  province  is  not  homogeneous.  The  intraprovince  NER  variation\nbetween  income  groups  attests  to  the  strong  correlation  between  poverty  and  school\nenrollment. The NER among children from poorer households remains low, even within better-\noff  provinces  that  exhibit  high  aggregate  NER.  While  public  basic  education  is  tuition  free  in\ntheory,  families  still  bear  direct  costs  for  schooling  (e.g.  contribution  to  parent-teacher\nassociations,  school  uniforms,  and  supplies),  indirect  costs  (lost  children\u2019s  household  labor),\nand  opportunity  costs  (lost  income  from  children\u2019s  earnings).  These  are  significant  burdens  to\npoor households.\n\nAmong the poorest provinces, NTB has one of the lowest provincial primary and junior\n17.\nsecondary  NER.  Yet,  the  NER  among  higher  income  children  is  at  par  with  the  national\naverage.    On  the  other  hand,  while  the  aggregate  primary  NER  in  DKI  Jakarta  (93.1  percent)\nwas above the national average (92.6 percent), there was an 8 percent difference in the primary\nNER between the highest income group (94 percent) and the lowest income group (86 percent).\nThe primary NER for children in the lowest income group in DKI Jakarta is one of the lowest in\nthe  country,  and  well  below  the  national  average  for  the  lowest  income  group  (90  percent).\nPrimary school children from poor households in Jakarta are more likely not to be in school than\nthose  in  other  parts  of  the  country.  The  difference  at  the  junior  secondary  level  NER  in  DKI\nJakarta is even more significant.  While the provincial NER is the highest in the country, there is\na  35  percent  difference  in  NER  between  the  highest  (80.1  percent)  and  lowest  (44.9  percent)\nincome  groups.  More  than  half  of  children  aged  13-15  years  old  in  poor  households  in  DKI\nJakarta are not enrolled in junior secondary schools.\n\n18.\nDisparity  in  Public  Resource  Allocation.  The  mechanisms  used  for  transfer  of  the\nbasic education budget from the central Government to districts brought varied allocations to the\nregions.  Data  limitations  (the  likely  result  of  the  fragmented  multiministry  education  financing\nsystem)  constrain  full  analysis  but  the  per-student  operational  budget17  in  2000  for  public\nprimary  schools  averaged  $0.89  nationally  and  was  $1.04  in  Bali,  $0.72  in  DKI  Jakarta,  and\n$0.76 in NTB.18 Another indicator of disparity is the teacher student ratio. The national average\n(2000)  is  27  students  per  teacher.  Bali  enjoys  a  high  teacher  student  ratio  (1:15),  while  DKI\nJakarta averages 27 students per teacher, and NTB has poor teacher student ratio (1:30).\n\n19.\nAt  the  public  junior  secondary  level,  transfers  of  recurrent  budget  from  the  national\nGovernment19  to  regions  averaged  $39.70  per  student  (2000).  Transfers  per  student  to  Bali\nwere  above  average  ($55.30)  while  DKI  Jakarta  and  NTB  were  below  average  ($34.70  and\n$35.50, respectively). Within those provinces, resource allocation across districts was uneven,\ngenerally  disadvantaging  poor  districts.  In  the  case  of  DKI  Jakarta,  the  relatively  low  level  of\nbudget transfer was offset by supplements from the local government, parents, alumni/business\n\n                                                          \n16 Provincial Poverty and Social Indicators SUSENAS 1993-1999, March 2000 appended to Poverty Assessment in\n\nIndonesia, ADB, October 2000.Data referred to in paragraphs 8 to 9 are for 1999.\n\n17 This  budget  used  to  be  transferred  by  the  national  Government  to  provincial  governments  to  cover  school\nadministrative  costs,  excluding  teacher  salaries,  which  are  transferred  separately.  Reliable  financial  data  on\nprimary schools is not available.\n\n18 Mission estimates based on 2000 allocation data provided by Bali, Jakarta, and NTB.\n19 Budget  transfers  covered  teacher  salaries,  building  maintenance,  utilities,  incentives/allowance  for  teachers,\n\ntransfers, learning materials and learning process support.\n\n\f6\n\ncommunities,  and  others.  In  addition,  the  high  population  density  and  larger  schools  in  urban\nJakarta,  probably  permit  greater  economy  of  scale  in  resource  use  by  schools.  However,  the\nlow  transfers  to  poor  and  sparsely  populated  rural  provinces  with  smaller  schools  (e.g.,  NTB)\ncould  not  easily  be  offset  by  contributions  from  local  governments,  communities,  and  parents.\nResource constraints limit the delivery and quality of basic education.\n\n20.\nThe impact of fiscal decentralization on resource allocation for basic education is not yet\nknown.  In  the  absence  of  agreed  subsidy  mechanisms  within  the  decentralized  education\nfinance  system,  there  is  no  guarantee  that  fiscal  decentralization  will  offset  cross-regional\ndisparities  in  public  financing  for  basic  education.  Poor  districts,  where  provision  of  basic\neducation needs major improvements, require proportionately greater financing to achieve parity\nwith better-off areas. Local governments with weak local revenue-generating capacity (districts\nin NTB and poorer districts in Bali) require continued and substantial transfers of resources from\nthe national Government.\n\n21.\n  Role  of  Private  Schools  in  Poor  Communities.  Inequity  in  basic  education  is  also\nseen in the unique role of private schools in Indonesia. Private schools, particularly madrasah,20\nare  prominent  providers  of  basic  education  for  poorer  communities  and  children  because:  (i)\npoor rural areas are often under-served by the public system;  (ii) parents may prefer madrasah,\nparticularly for girls; and (iii) poor children with relatively weaker primary education may not be\nsuccessful  entering  public  junior  secondary  schools  where  admission  is  based  on  competitive\nexamination results.\n\n22.\nNationwide, private madrasah enroll 2.6 million primary schoolchildren (9 percent of total\nprimary  enrollment)  and  1.3  million  junior  secondary  schoolchildren  (14  percent  of  total  junior\nsecondary  enrollment).  In  NTB,  private  madrasah  account  for  9  percent  of  total  primary\nenrollment  and  27  percent  of  total  junior  secondary  enrollment.21  The  quality  of  education  in\nprivate  madrasah  is  generally  low  due  to  inadequate  resources  per  student.  Their  operations\nrely much on community contributions, tuition fees, and parental contributions. Although private\nmadrasah receive some government support, including teachers seconded from public schools,\noverall resources are inadequate. Resources per student are much lower than in public schools.\nThere also are considerable resource differences by region with lower resources per student in\nlower income areas.\n\n23.\nParents\u2019  economic  capacity  directly  affects  the  resource  capacity  of  private  madrasah.\nWhile  the  average  recurrent  budget  per  student  for  public  junior  secondary  school  in  DKI\nJakarta is $34.70 (2000), that for private madrasah in DKI Jakarta was $23.40, 67 percent of the\npublic  schools.  Per  student  resources  are  lower  in  poorer  districts  within  DKI  Jakarta.  Private\nmadrasah in Jakarta Barat operated on $15.70 per student. The public-private gap widens even\nmore  in  rural  NTB,  where  the  public  junior  secondary  schools  had  an  average  budget  per\nstudent  of  $35.50  while  private  madrasah  operated  on  $7.40  per  student,  only  20  percent  of\npublic  junior  secondary  school  budget.22  Due  to  inadequate  resources,  madrasah  catering  to\npoor  children  offer  poor  quality  education,  are  chronically  short  of  teaching  resources  and\nteachers,  and  have  limited  capacity  to  implement  the  curriculum.  Achieving  greater  equity  in\naccess  to  quality  basic  education  requires  integrated  strategies  (i)  to  foster  poorer  children\u2019s\naccess  to  quality  public  education,  (ii)  to  improve  the  quality  of  public  schools  serving  poor\nareas and communities, and (iii) to support improvement of private madrasah.\n\n                                                          \n20 While  there  are  public  madrasah,  a  large  proportion  of  madrasah  are  private  schools  normally  financed  by\nfoundations  and  communities.  Both  public  and  private  madrasah  are  supervised  by  MORA  and  implement\nCurriculum 1994 developed by MONE.\n\n21 Source: Ministry of National Education, 2000.\n22 Source: Ministry of Religious Affairs, 2000.\n\n\f7\n\nb. \n\nQuality\n\nStudies  on  learning  outcomes  in  Indonesia  reveal  that  graduates  of  primary  and  junior\n24.\nsecondary  school  are  not  sufficiently \nliterate  or  numerate,  and  have  not  mastered\ncommunication  and  reasoning  skills.23  On  subject  mastery,  some  improvements  have  been\nreported  from  achievement  test  scores  in  Bahasa  Indonesia  and  science,  but  not  in\nmathematics.  Less-than-desired  student  learning  outcomes  are  associated  with  constraints  on\n(i)  school  leadership/management;  (ii)  teacher  effectiveness  (mastery  of  subject  and  teaching\nmethodologies);  (iii)  quality  or  availability  of  inputs  (instructional  materials,  facilities  and\nequipment);  and  (iv)  policies,  procedures  and  standards,  including  teacher  assignment  and\nmanagement  policies,  budget  and  resource  allocation,  curriculum,  and  learning  assessment\ntools.\n\nThe  Government  has  made  considerable  investments  in  school  inputs  and  teacher\n25.\ndevelopment:  improving  facilities,  providing  free  textbooks  to  all  primary  and  junior  secondary\nschools, adopting various strategies and policies on pre-service and in-service teacher training.\nYet, many schools, particularly in poorer and rural areas, still remain below minimum conditions,\nas  inadequate  resource  flows  do  not  permit  regular  maintenance  and  provision  of  education\ninputs.\n\nSchool  inputs  alone  do  not  automatically  result  in  improved  quality  of  education.24\n26.\nInternational  and  local  experience  shows  that  the  quality  of  education  improves  when  schools\nexercise greater decision-making power. More attention needs to be geared to the critical roles\nof schools and classrooms, and overall school performance. So far, schools in Indonesia have\noperated  as  an  extension  and  the  lowest  point  of  the  largest  bureaucracy  within  the  public\nservice  (i.e.  the  public  education  system).  Schools  do  not  have  sufficient  authority,  effective\nleadership,  staff,  or  resources  to  proactively  improve  the  process  of  education  and  thus  to\naddress the learning needs of students. Public schools have been accountable solely to parent\nministries;  private  schools  have  been  primarily  accountable  to  the  foundations  financing  the\nschools.  To  increase  school  effectiveness  to  yield  improved  outcomes  of  student  learning,\ngreater  participation  of  the  beneficiaries  and  communities  is  required.  By  empowering  school\ncommittees,  the  Government  plans  to  encourage  school  principals  and  teachers  to  be\nresponsible  for  the  educational  process,  while  the  school  committees  become  responsible  for\nschool  management  including  planning,  budgeting,  resource  mobilization,  and  monitoring  of\nteacher effectiveness.\n\nc. \n\nEffectiveness and Efficiency of Management and Financing  \n\n27.\nThe  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  the  basic  education  system  in  Indonesia  were\nhampered by the rigidity of the centralized management and financing system. The complexity\nof  the  system  and  limited  interministerial  coordination  for  basic  education  management\nconstrained the system\u2019s capacity to devise and implement flexible solutions enhancing equity\nand quality. The budgetary process for basic education was fragmented across five ministries,\nand  preparation  of  the  recurrent  and  development  budgets  lacked  coordination.  The  budget\nallocation  process  was  not  data  based,  due  to  the  absence  of  a  systematic  or  consolidated\ninformation  system  to  track  the  details  of  education  expenditures.  The  system  did  not  allow\nadjustments to respond to local or school requirements, because fixed line items in the budget\nlimited  the  flexibility  to  transfer  resources  between  line  items  during  the  year.  Fund-flow\nmechanisms  were  cumbersome  and  resources  for  basic  education  diminished  as  they  trickled\n\n                                                          \n23 World Bank, 2000.

If  implemented  successfully,  decentralization\noffers the potential to enhance efficiency, transparency, and accountability, as well as to provide\na closer match between community expectations and the results of schooling, and to increase\ncommunity  contributions  to  education.  To  achieve  these  benefits  there  must  be:  (i)  sufficient\ninstitutional arrangements and capacity at all levels commensurate with the new functions and\nresponsibilities;  (ii)  effective  vertical  and  horizontal  communication  mechanisms;  (iii)  human\nresources strategies to ensure rational and balanced staffing and skills mix at each level of the\ndecentralized  education  management  system;  (iv)  resources  for  social  services  during  the\ntransition;  (v)  an  education  budget  system  that  ensures  adequate,  equitable,  and  timely\nresource \nto\ninstitutionalize school-based management (SBM) and to achieve of minimum service standards;\nand (vi) effective mechanisms to provide education-specific subsidies to disadvantaged districts.\nWithout these, there is a risk decentralization will contribute to further compartmentalization and\ndeterioration  of  overall  service  delivery,  potentially  widening  the  gaps  in  equity  and  quality  of\nservice delivery.\n\nlocal  governments  and  schools\u2013commensurate  with \n\nthe  policy \n\nflows \n\nto \n\n29.\nA  parallel  plan  to  enhance  SBM  and  transfer  greater  management  responsibilities  to\nschools  and  communities  offers  an  added  opportunity  to  enhance  the  quality,  efficiency,  and\neffectiveness  of  education  management  that  depends  primarily  on  the  way  schools  are\nmanaged, rather than on the availability of resources.25 To maximize this potential, the process\nof  consolidating  decentralized  education  management  needs  to  integrate  development  of\nsupportive  administrative  systems  (e.g.  direct  resource  flows  to  schools)  for  SBM  as  well  as\nleadership training and professional development of school principals.\n\n30.\nA  smooth  transition  from  centralized  to  decentralized  management  requires  timely  and\nadequate institutional arrangements by the district administrations, BAPPEDAs and DPRDs to\nabsorb  the  delegated  responsibilities.  Substantial  capacity  building  needs  to  accompany  this\nprocess to help the local institutions to effectively carry out the new responsibilities that range\nfrom  personnel  management,  finance,  procurement,  to  overall  sector  planning.  Capacity\nbuilding needs to encompass advocacy to gain district government support for basic education,\nincluding  timely  dissemination  of  key  education  sector  issues  as  well  as  national  goals  and\npolicy  priorities  (especially  the  concepts  of  SBM  and  minimum  service  standards).  The\nestablishment  of  effective  mechanisms  for  objective  and  data-based  planning  becomes\nparticularly critical to foster rational, transparent, and efficient sector planning and local resource\nallocation. The capacity and interest of the district governments in education vary. Stakeholders,\nincluding heads of local government, DPRDs, civil society, and communities, are not necessarily\nfamiliar with education issues or effective sector strategies, as sector knowledge was formerly\nsequestered  in  the  local  MONE  offices'.  District  governments  are  expected  to  absorb\nresponsibilities over madrasah, and provision of adequate support to private madrasah needs to\nbe  integrated  within  the  district  government\u2019s  basic  education  plans.  Furthermore,  within  the\nbroader national policy of institutionalizing school and community-based management, effective\ninvolvement  of  civil  society  and  communities  is  important  to  create  a  demand  for  education\nservices  and  for  transparent  planning  and  management  of  education  services  by  the  district\ngovernment.\n\n                                                          \n25 United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), 2000. School Based Management.\n\n\fB. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n9\n\n31.\nLaw  25/2000  or  the  National  Development  Plan  (PROPENAS)  defines  medium-term\n(2001-2004)  national  development  policies  and  priorities.  It  attaches  high  priority  to  education\ndevelopment,  and  commits  the  Government  to  (i)  reduce  inequity,  (ii)  improve  quality  and\nrelevance,  and  (iii)  enhance  management  efficiency.  Within  this  framework,  the  Government\nplans to undertake a major development program for basic education, comprising three thematic\npillars:  (i)  achieving  universal  nine-year  basic  education  by  2010,  particularly  by  addressing\nunder-served areas and poor communities; (ii) enhancing transparency and accountability of the\nsystem  by  fostering  SBM  and  community  participation;  and  (iii)  establishing  school  boards  in\neach district, and school committees in each primary and junior secondary school.\n\n32.\nThe  PROPENAS  also  underscores  the  Government\u2019s  aim  to  maintain  a  synchronized\nand  integrated  national  education  system,  as  management  and  delivery  are  decentralized.\nNational minimum service standards serve as one of the tools to ensure the integrity, equity and\nquality of post decentralization basic services.\n\n33.\nThe  formation  and  piloting  of  school  board  and  school  committees  is  scheduled  to  be\ncompleted  in  2001.  The  concept  of  the  school  board  and  school  committee  is  intended  to\nsupport  a  system  for  delivering  education  that  is  more  democratic,  transparent,  effective,  and\nefficient, and encourages community and parent participation in education management.\n\n34.\nThe Government defines decentralization of basic education as going beyond devolving\nresponsibilities  to  the  district  level.  The  ultimate  aim  is  to  transfer  considerable  resources  and\nmanagement responsibilities to the school level. The Government has already piloted a national\nprogram on SBM during school year 1999/2000 in a selected number of public junior secondary\nschools  in  27  provinces.    The  Government  plans  to  expand  this  initiative  over  the  next  few\nyears.\n\nC. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n35.\nIndonesia  has  vast  experience  in  implementing  education  improvement  programs  and\nprojects,  with  both  national  and  international  financing.  The  main  funding  agencies  ADB,\nAustralian Agency for International Development (AusAid), Canadian International Development\nAgency (CIDA), German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ), Japan Bank for International\nCooperation (JBIC) Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), United Nations Educational\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), and\nthe  World  Bank.  These  projects  have  supported  teacher  training,  education  management\nincluding  preparing  for  decentralization  and  SBM.  Investment  projects  (mainly  through  ADB,\nJBIC  and  World  Bank)  also  provided  textbooks,  and  rehabilitated  and  upgraded  schools.  Civil\nworks  increasingly  involve  community  management.  Given  the  size  of  Indonesia,  external\nassistance generally covered a segment of the country, either by province or district, although it\nwas managed centrally.\n\nADB\u2019s  support  to  the  education  sector  in  Indonesia  started  in  1975.  To  date,  ADB  has\n36.\nsupported  30  education  and  training  projects  totaling  $2,117  million,  and  provided  about  $16\nmillion  for  36  TA  grants  in  Indonesia  (Appendix  5).  Until  1990,  ADB  supported  mainly  the\nvocational,  technical,  and  higher  education  subsectors.  Since  the  early  1990s,  ADB  has\nprogressively  increased  support  to  the  basic  education  subsector  that  is  now  a  dominant\nsubsector the ongoing program. Reflecting ADB\u2019s support to the 1994 Government commitment\nto  achieve  universal  basic  education  and  extend  compulsory  education  to  nine  years,  ADB\u2019s\nassistance  to  basic  education  has  covered  both  public  and  private  schools  (including\n\n\f10\n\nmadrasah),  and  aimed  at  increasing  poor  children\u2019s  (particularly  girls)  participation  in,  and\ncompletion of, basic education, as well as improving the quality of learning outcomes. Since the\nfirst Junior Secondary Education Project26 in 1992, ADB has supported four investment projects\nand one crisis-response sector development program loan in basic education, with a total loan\namount of $414 million.  Lessons learned from the past or on-going support to basic education\nare discussed below.\n\n37.\nRecognizing the important role of school management in effective education, a number\nof projects supported training for school principals and introduced SBM. ADB and World Bank\ninvestment  projects  have  supported  fairly  large-scale  principal  training  programs  on  school\nmanagement  skills.  More  recently, \nin\nUNESCO/UNICEF  and  JICA  supported  projects  that  encouraged  training  in  and  implementing\nschool  or  site  based  management.  Those  projects  provide  school  block  grants  as  a  capacity-\nbuilding tool, integrated with on-site training for communities and schools promoting community\nparticipation in school management and improvement programs.\n\nthe  Government  piloted  a  program  on  SBM \n\nIn addition, the crisis response program initiated with the ADB-supported SPSDP, joined\n38.\nlater  by  the  World  Bank,  provided  nationwide  support  to  a  scholarship  and  school  block  grant\nprogram.  The  SPSDP  introduced  and  demonstrated  the  effectiveness  of  direct  channeling  of\nblock grants to schools and independent monitoring. The outcomes have been positive: primary\nand  junior  secondary  school  enrollments  remained  stable  during  the  crisis.  The  SPSDP  also\ninitiated  substantial  policy  dialogue,  laying  the  groundwork  for  post  crisis  Indonesia  to  further\ndevelop and refine social safety net mechanisms, through better targeting and improved access\nof  the  poor  to  basic  social  services  including  education.  Attention  during  the  crisis  focused  on\nboth  protecting  the  poor  and  putting  in  place  a  framework  of  reforms  designed  to  strengthen\ndecentralized  delivery  and  management  of  education.  The  gains  achieved  in  policy  and\nprocedural  improvements  need  to  be  sustained  along  with  tighter  targeting  to  increase\nenrollment  and  completion  rates  at  all  levels  and  transition  rates  from  primary  to  junior\nsecondary school of children from poor families.\n\n39.\nPreparing and processing DBEP involved extensive collaboration and coordination with\nother  funding  agencies.    Several  joint  project  preparation  missions  were  conducted  with  the\nWorld  Bank,  which  is  currently  preparing  a  basic  education  project  covering  three  provinces\n(West and South Sumatra and East Java).  The ADB and the World Bank projects share similar\nproject approaches and strategies. Preparation also involved close consultations with JICA and\nUNESCO/UNICEF  that  are  supporting  pilot  projects  in  SBM  and  community  participation.\nFurthermore,  there  are  ongoing  or  planned  projects  supporting  education  quality  improvement\nand  local  government  capacity  building  within  the  project  provinces  and  districts.  DBEP\npreparation and processing missions also consulted closely with those projects. DBEP's strong\npoverty  focus  and  emphasis  on  equity  complement  other  ongoing  efforts,  and  envisage\nthe  GTZ-supported  Science  Education  Quality\nconcrete  coordination  particularly  with \nImprovement Project in DKI Jakarta and NTB, UNESCO/UNICEF-supported Creating Learning\nCommunities  for  Children  Project  in  NTB,  and  district  government  institution-building  projects\nsupported  by  GTZ  and  district  government  projects  in  NTB  supported  by  the  United  Nations\nDevelopment Programme.\n\nD. \n\nLessons Learned\n\nPast and ongoing projects, including those financed by ADB, have generated a number\n40.\nof  pertinent  lessons  and  recommendations.  Experience  with  decentralization  or  decentralized\n\n                                                          \n26 Loan 1194-INO: Junior Secondary Education Project, for $105 million, approved on 19 November 1992.\n\n\f11\n\nproject implementation in other countries in the region (e.g., the Philippines) also provides some\nrelevant lessons. These have been carefully examined and integrated into DBEP design.\n\n41.\nBlock Grants to Schools. The SPSDP pioneered and demonstrated the effectiveness\nof block grants. The scheme has also been implemented through the Government pilot program\non SBM, the Creating Learning Communities for Children Project (UNESCO/UNICEF), and the\nRegional  Education  Development  and  Improvement  Project  financed  by  JICA.  Positive\noutcomes  include  (i)  quicker  and  more  transparent  flow  of  resources  to  schools  and\nbeneficiaries;  (ii)  effective  use  of  resources  to  secure  inputs  and  support  relevant  to\nrequirements of students, classrooms, and schools; (iii) efficient use of funds27 and minimizing\nadministrative  levies  on  or  leakage  of  project  funds  as  they  trickle  down  the  system;  and  (iv)\ngreater sense of ownership and more proactive roles of schools.\n\nSustainability  of  School  Grants.  Measures  to  ensure  integration  of  the  block  grant\n42.\nscheme in the government (national and local) education finance mechanisms have been built\ninto  the  overall  DBEP  strategy.  The  Government  pilot  program  on  SBM  has  taken  the  step  to\nintegrate block grants into MONE\u2019s development budget at the junior secondary level. In light of\ndecentralization,  district  governments  need  to  be  convinced  to  supplement  block  grant\nprovisions  with  the  local  education  financing  mechanism.  This  will  require  both  an  effective\npolicy framework at the national level and demand from schools and communities themselves.\nThe latter is particularly important under decentralization.\n\n43.\nCommunity Involvement. Sustaining the school block grant scheme in the local budget\nstructure  requires  both  effective  operations  and  creation  of  community  demand  addressed  to\nlocal governments for school block grants. This calls for active participation of communities and\neffective  school-community  partnership  in  both  planning  and  monitoring  the  use  of  the  block\ngrants. Experience indicates that project activities involving community participation enhance a\nsense  of  ownership,  sustainability  of  benefits,  transparency,  and  accountability.  Ongoing  ADB\nand World Bank-financed projects demonstrate that community-managed school rehabilitation is\nmore  cost-effective  than  centrally  procured  and  contractor-managed  civil  works,  and  allows\nregular maintenance by community members.\n\ntraining.  Experience \n\nJoint  Training.  Effective  community  participation \n\nrequires  considerable  social\n44.\npreparation  and \nthe  UNESCO/UNICEF  Creating  Learning\nCommunities for Children Project and JICA Regional Education Development and Improvement\nProject identified joint training among communities, school staff, and local administration staff as\nan essential step in fostering effective collaboration among all parties involved in school-or site-\nbased management.\n\nfrom \n\n45.\nTeacher  Development.  With  a  quality  improvement  objective  within  the  broader\nframework of the Government\u2019s teacher upgrading program, a number of externally supported\nprojects have supported teacher development (mostly in-service training in both subject content\nand  pedagogical  methodologies).  During  the  1980s,  teacher  training  was  supply-driven,  and\ntrainees received one-time mass training at central and provincial centers. Evaluation of these\nprojects noted limited effectiveness and sustainability of the mass training approach, and led to\nincreased use in the 1990s, of cluster-based and ongoing training at school sites. Teachers give\npositive feedback on peer support integrated into teacher development strategies.\n\n                                                          \n27 The Project Management Unit of the World Bank- supported West Java Basic Education Project estimates that the\ncost  of  school  and  community-managed  school  rehabilitation  was  about  36  percent  less  than  conventional\ncontractor-managed civil works.\n\n\f12\n\n46.\nSite-Based  and  Ongoing  Training.  The  effectiveness  of  training  is  enhanced  if\nimplemented on site (e.g., in the classroom in the case of teacher effectiveness, in the school in\nthe  case  of  school  management).  One-time  mass  training  was  found  less  effective  than  regular\nand ongoing on-site training tailored to the requirements of smaller groups of participants.\n\nTechnical Support. In addition to training, continuing demand-based technical support\n47.\nis desired to improve the effectiveness of community-based activities. For example, community-\nbased  school  rehabilitation  will  still  require  regular  engineering  and  construction  supervision\nsupport  to  ensure  the  professional  quality  of  work,  unless  community  members  have  the\ntechnical  requirements.  A  mentoring  approach  that  provides  onsite  technical  assistance,\norientation,  facilitation  and  coaching  has  found  to  be  effective  in  assisting  schools  and\ncommunities to implement these activities.\n\nSchool  and  District  Committees.  The  SPSDP  introduced  the  creation  of  school  and\n48.\ndistrict  committees  as  the  body  to  oversee  allocation  and  use  of  school  block  grants.  Local\neducation  administration,  community,  parents,  and  school  staff  were  expected  to  be\nrepresented  on  the  committees.  The  results  of  independent  monitoring  as  well  as  discussions\nwith recipients have pointed to the need to improve the balance in committee membership. The\ncurrent  committees  tend  to  comprise  largely  public  sector  representatives  including  recently\nretired officials and teachers; this should be reversed to increase representatives from broader\ncommunities  and  civil  society.  Similarly,  formalizing  the  school  and  district  committees  and\nensuing greater commitment and involvement of the members will require regular allocation of\noperational budget for the committees\u2019 activities.\n\nTransparency and Accountability. The critical importance of a public announcement of\n49.\nschool fund allocation, amount, and use was confirmed through the SPSDP, UNESCO/UNICEF\nCreating Learning Communities for Children Project and JICA Regional Education Development\nand  Improvement  Project.  Independent  monitoring  and  effective  mechanisms  for  resolving\ncomplaint  are  also  essential  for  transparency  and  accountability  of  scholarships  and  school\nblock grants. The absence of clear consequences and penalties for infractions has limited the\neffectiveness of the current complaint resolution mechanism.\n\nBlock  Fund  Allocation  and  Targeting.    Contrary  to  original  intentions,  the  fund\n50.\nallocation formula for the scholarships and school block grant program was applied rigidly and\ndid  not  take  full  advantage  of  the  intended  flexibility  at  district  level.  The  resulting  area-based\ntargeting excluded some poor schools and students in relatively better-off areas. The allocation\nof block grants in developmental projects must be proposal-based and targeted locally based on\na thorough baseline assessment and profile of poor communities.\n\n51.\nUse  of  Educational  Inputs.  Providing  inputs  alone  does  not  improve  the  quality  and\neffectiveness  of  the  teaching-learning  process.  Inputs  need  to  be  accompanied  by  well-\ndesigned orientation and training programs on input use, monitoring of the effectiveness of use,\nand  improved  school  management  capacity  to  translate  the  inputs  into  effective  teaching-\nlearning process and outcomes.\n\nlong-term \n\n52.\nFlexibility and Simplicity.   Experience from locally implemented projects in Indonesia as\nwell  as  in  the  Philippines  underscores  the  need  for  a  simple  and  flexible  project  design,  and  a\nfocus  on \ninstitutional  and  capacity-building  support.  Compared  with  centrally\nimplemented  projects  with  a  top-down  decision-making  process,  decentralized  projects  require\nprocess-oriented,  bottom-up  planning  and  implementation.  Decentralized  projects  involve\nconsiderably longer lead time before the implementation pace picks up, and hence require longer\nproject  implementation  periods.  Financing  arrangements  between  the  national  and  local\n\n\f13\n\ngovernments  also  need  to  be  flexible  and  simple.  Experience  also  shows  the  need  for\nconservative expectations of local governments\u2019 contributions to project counterpart funding while\nthe  decentralized  budget  and  finance  systems  are  being  tested.  In  addition,  a  safety  net\nmechanism is required for local governments with a smaller revenue base.\n\nCapacity Building.  A study of capacity building for district governments supported by\n53.\nthe United Nations Development Programme notes that strengthening institutions involves more\nthan training the staff. It requires various interventions that go beyond expanding the individual\u2019s\nknowledge and skills and include developing  appropriate organizational structures  and creating\nsupportive policies, systems, and management process.\n\nE. \n\nADB Sector Strategy\n\nThe  draft  updated  ADB  policy  on  education28  sets  six  priorities  in  supporting  ADB\u2019s\n54.\nstrategic  policies  to  reduce  poverty,  enhance  the  status  of  women,  and  facilitate  economic\ngrowth.  The  priorities  are  (i)  increasing  equity,  access,  and  retention  especially  for  the  poor,\nwomen, and other marginalized groups; (ii) improving the quality of education at all levels; (iii)\nstrengthening management, governance, and efficiency, with emphasis on greater stakeholder\nparticipation;  (iv)  mobilizing  resources  for  sustainable  education  delivery,  while  protecting  the\npoor\u2019s  access  to  affordable  basic  education;  (v)  strengthening  collaboration  with  partners  and\nbeneficiaries; and (vi) emphasizing more experimentation with and dissemination of innovative\nstrategies and technologies.\n\n55. Within the education sector policy and the broader context of the poverty reduction and\nhuman  development  objectives  of  ADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  for  Indonesia  (2001-2003),  ADB\nwill continue to prioritize support to education. Investment in basic education directly contributes\nto  social  and  economic  development,  and  yields  a  higher  rate  of  return  than  investment  in\nhigher  levels  of  education.  ADB  support  will  aim  directly  at  achieving  universal,  quality  basic\nimproving  basic  education\neducation  primarily  by  addressing  regional \nopportunities  for  poor  children,  the  group  requiring  focused  attention.  The  basic  education\nsector  strategy  includes  supporting  the  process  of  devolving  basic  education  management  to\ndistrict  governments  as  well  as  encouraging  community  participation  in  school  planning  and\nmanagement.\n\ninequities  and \n\nF. \n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\nOver the past decade, the Government and ADB have conducted regular policy dialogue\n56.\non the education sector. The policy dialogues centered around equity and quality issues, as well\nas  greater  integration  and  public  support  to  private  education  within  the  broader  sector\ndevelopment policies and strategies. The preparation and implementation of the crisis response\nprogram  (SPSDP),  the  first  policy-based  lending  to  the  education  sector,  consolidated  policy\ndialogue  on  the  basic  education  subsector.  The  SPSDP  policy  framework  was  not  limited  to\ncrisis-specific  issues,  but  encompassed  fundamental  policy  issues  related  to  long-standing\nconcerns  of  quality,  equity,  and  efficiency  of  basic  education.  The  policy  actions  agreed  upon\nunder  the  SPSDP  are  even  more  relevant  to  post-crisis  Indonesia  that  faces  an  added\nchallenge  to  maintain  and  improve  basic  education  services  under  decentralization.  Policy\ndialogue through the DBEP preparation process built on the policy initiatives of the SPSDP, and\nfurther improvements and institutionalization of earlier policy initiatives. Discussions focused on\nequity and efficiency in decentralized management and delivery of basic education.\n\n                                                          \n28 Working paper discussed by the Board on 24 April 2001.\n\n\f14\n\n57.\nAchieving  Equity  in  Basic  Education  Opportunities  by  Targeting  Poor  Children.\nDBEP is aimed at directly reducing disparities between regions and between income groups. To\nthis  end,  DBEP  resources  will  be  predominantly  allocated  to  poorer  districts,  poverty  pockets,\nand schools catering to students from low-income households. It is essential to ensure effective\ntargeting based on an objective measure of poverty and deprivation of the opportunity for basic\neducation.  Targeting  strategies  and  general  criteria  for  DBEP  were  defined  from  an  in-depth\nreview of lessons from past and ongoing initiatives as well as workshops with representatives of\ncommunities, schools, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and local governments in DBEP\ndistricts.  In  the  absence  of  reliable  subdistrict  and  village-level  poverty  and  education  data,\nDBEP,  through  pre-implementation  baseline  surveys  (including  school  and  teacher  mapping),\nwill undertake thorough socioeconomic surveys in the sub-districts to capture the distribution of\nsocio-economically  and  educationally  deprived  communities.  The  information  will  be  used  in\nprioritizing and finalizing the selection of beneficiary schools, communities, and students. Each\ndistrict government will refine the targeting strategies with community participation, recognizing\nthe value of local community knowledge and the need to ensure DBEP's responsiveness to the\nlocal  poverty  context.  To  support  poor  students  who  will  enroll  and  complete  basic  education,\nDBEP will employ various strategies such as improving the learning environment, scholarships,\nand other remedial support to reduce financial and other barriers to enrollment and completion.\n\n58.\nFiscal  Decentralization  and  National  Government  Support  to  Address  Inequity  in\nBasic  Education.  Post  decentralization  mechanisms  for  central  Government  education\nsubsidies  to  financially  less  capable  local  governments  and/or  support  to  implement  national\npriority  programs  are  being  developed.  ADB  has  provided  TA  to  assist  the  Government  to\ndevelop  mechanisms  to  support  basic  education  services  for  financially  less  capable  local\ngovernments29 and plans assistance on mechanisms to transfer external loans to districts with\nvarying financial capabilities and for revenue and nonrevenue-generating projects. During DBEP\npreparation local budgets for basic education were reviewed, before and after decentralization.\nFinancing arrangements for DBEP, particularly for the poor districts that are the primary target\nbeneficiaries, were discussed with both central and local governments. DBEP intends to remedy\nthe existing gaps in basic education services in poor districts and poverty pockets. As such, the\nnational  Government  will  remain  as  the  sole  Borrower  of  the  ADB  loan  for  DBEP  and  will\nassume  the  repayment  responsibilities  although  basic  education  is  devolved  to  local\ngovernments.  However,  to  promote  local  ownership  and  to  enhance  the  sustainability,  local\ngovernments will supply about 90 percent of DBEP counterpart funding.\n\n59.\nThe  DBEP's  primary  focus  is  support  to  districts  in  NTB  and  poor  districts  in  Bali  with\nhigh  poverty  incidence,  weak  revenue-generating  capacity,  and  consequent  high  dependence\non  transfers  from  the  national  Government.  Before  decentralization,  these  districts  received\nrelatively  small  transfers  for  education,  and  needed  substantial  additional  resources  to  fill  the\ngaps. DBEP includes a lower level of support to DKI Jakarta and the better-off districts in Bali,\nfocusing on schools and children in poverty pockets. Local government revenue is fairly strong\nin DKI Jakarta and southern Bali. Schools in DKI Jakarta enroll a large number of students who\nreside outside the province but commute to DKI schools, attracted by the relatively high quality\nof education in the capital. As a result, the children of poor DKI Jakarta residents are displaced\nby the commuting children who are financially better-off. DBEP support to DKI Jakarta will target\nexclusively the displaced low-income students who reside in DKI Jakarta.\n\n60.\nSince policies and strategies for fiscal decentralization are evolving, policy dialogue on\nthe implications of fiscal decentralization for basic education services will continue during project\nimplementation  based  on  findings  and  recommendations  of  ADB  TA  and  other  studies.  ADB\nand  the  Government  will  periodically  review  the  effectiveness  and  relevance  of  the  financing\n                                                          \n29 TA 3701-INO: Support for Decentralized Education Management, for of $990,000, approved on 8 August 2001.\n\n\f15\n\narrangements for DBEP and, if necessary, introduce mutually acceptable adjustments to best fit\nthe emerging context and to maximize the project benefits and sustainability.\n\nintensive  on-site  capacity  building \n\nEnhancing  School-Based  Management.

Through  the  provision  of  school  block  grants\nfor  SBM,  DBEP  encourages\naccompanied  by \ninstitutionalization  of  the  financial  autonomy  of  schools.  Instead  of  a  predetermined  allocation\nformula, DBEP will introduce a system of proposal-based allocations to stimulate more proactive\nplanning,  management,  and  decision  making  on  school  improvement  initiatives  in  the  school\nand  the  community.  To  enhance  transparency  and  accountability  of  schools  to  communities,\ndirect and active participation of communities and parent-teacher associations will be an integral\nstrategy to enhance school-and site based management.\n\nPromoting  Effective  and  Efficient  Local  Education  Management.  Attaining  the\n62.\nbenefits  of  decentralization  depends  largely  on  the  capacity  of  local  governments  to  prioritize\nbasic education and ensure effective and efficient planning and management of the subsector.\nFinancial  support  from  DBEP  will  be  based  on  the  commitment  of  the  local  government  to\nprioritize  and  allocate  an  adequate  local  development  budget  to  basic  education  and  to\ncompleted  a  thorough  baselining,  situation  analysis,  and  medium-term  (five  year)  planning\nprocess.  To  maximize  rational  and  efficient  use  of  resources  for  basic  education,  DBEP  will\npromote  objective  data-based  planning  and  resource  allocation  at  the  district  level.  Where\nappropriate, rationalization or consolidation of schools will be encouraged. DBEP inputs will be\nused to provide incentives for school consolidation.\n\nSupport  to  Private  Schools  Including  Madrasah.  The  Government  will  continue  to\n63.\nprovide public support to private schools, particularly madrasah catering to students from low-\nincome  families.  In  this  context,  DBEP  will  encourage  full  integration  of  private  schools  and\nmadrasah as eligible beneficiary schools as long as they serve poor children. Baseline surveys\nand  school  mapping  will  cover  both  public  and  private  schools,  and  the  targeting  process  will\nensure  full  inclusion  of  madrasah  serving  poor  communities.  DBEP  will  also  promote  joint\nactivities  between  private  and  public  schools,  such  as  site-and  cluster-based  training.  It  is\nprobable that, in some areas, private schools will benefit more than their public counterparts.\n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n64.\nThe  PROPENAS  and  the  ADB  country  operational  strategies  in  Indonesia  prioritize\npoverty  reduction  and  achievement  of  regional  equity.  Achieving  and  sustaining  these  goals\nrequire equitable provision of quality basic education to the poorer segments of the population\nto set a foundation (i) to reduce existing gaps in human development across the country, and (ii)\nto  balance  the  availability  of  trainable  human  resources  to  support  social  and  economic\ndevelopment. The Project will contribute to these strategic goals through (i) focused investment\nin basic education targeted to poverty-affected areas, schools, and children; and (ii) improving\nmanagement and governance of basic education by supporting decentralization and measures\nfor  transparency  and  accountability  of  the  basic  education  system  to  communities  and  civil\nsociety.\n\nThe PROPENAS commits the Government to achieve universal access to quality basic\n65.\neducation by 2010 and to address the needs and constraints of poor children as the foremost\nsector priority. Despite potential long-term benefits, decentralization is not risk free; any adverse\neffects are likely to impact more on the poor segments of society, whose access to quality basic\n\n\f16\n\neducation  is  already  limited.  At  the  outset  of  decentralization,  therefore,  timely  support  should\nbe  given  to  poverty-affected  communities  and  children.  The  Government,  through  the  crisis\nresponse program, laid the foundations for mechanisms and policies (particularly school block\ngrants)  to  achieve  equity,  quality,  and  governance/management  reforms  the  basic  education\nsystem. The Project  directly builds  on the earlier achievements of the Government, to provide\nconsistent  long-term  support  to  ensure  consolidation  and  institutionalization  of  the  block  grant\nscheme and policy initiatives.\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n66.\nThe  broad  goals  of  the  Project  are  to  contribute  to  (i)  poverty  reduction  by  addressing\ninequity  in  human  development  through  improved  access  to  and  completion  of  the  nine-year\nbasic  education  for  poverty-affected  children,  and  (ii)  implementation  of  regional  autonomy  by\nsupporting  decentralized  management  of  basic  education.  The  immediate  objectives  are  to  (i)\nimprove poor children\u2019s participation in and completion of quality nine-year basic education; (ii)\ndevelop the capacity of districts to plan, manage, finance and deliver basic education services,\nimprove  community  participation  in  developing  basic  education;  and  (iii)  demonstrate  the\neffectiveness of the proposal-and demand-based block grant mechanisms to support initiatives\nof the school, community, and district for basic education improvement.\n\nThe Project covers primary and junior secondary education programs offered by public\n67.\nand  private  schools  and  madrasah  in  21  districts  in  Bali,  DKI  Jakarta,  and  NTB.  The  Project\nallocates  financing  and  support  to  each  district  in  proportion  to  the  incidence  and  depth  of\npoverty.    Poor  districts  will  receive  higher  allocation  of  resources;  hence  most  resources  are\nallocated to districts in NTB and in northern Bali where poverty incidence is high.  The Project\ncomprises  three  parts:  (i)  part  A:  school  development;  (ii)  part  B:  district  basic  education\ndevelopment; and (iii) part C: monitoring, evaluation, and reporting.\n\n1.\n\nSchool Development (Part A)\n\n68.\nThis  component,  with  two  sub-components,  aims  to  develop  the  capacity  of  schools\ncatering to poor communities and children to become self-managed schools accountable to the\ncommunities.  Activities  primarily  take  place  at  the  school  and  community  level.  School\ndevelopment will be implemented in 17 of 21 target districts where poverty incidence is above 5\npercent.\n\na.\n\nCapacity Building for School Based Management (A-1)\n\n69.\nThis  subcomponent  supports  the  target  schools  catering  to  poor  communities  and\nchildren to become self-managed and accountable to communities.  Beneficiary schools will be\nprioritized  through  poverty  screening,  using  data  and  information  from  the  socioeconomic\nsurveys, family planning and welfare offices, and local or community knowledge. Key activities\nwill include (i) community preparation and socialization for SBM; (ii) establishment and operation\nof school/education committees; (iii) orientation and training workshops on SBM for principals,\nteachers, school committees, and other stakeholders; (iv) facilitated participatory baseline study\nand  self-assessment  of  target  schools;  (v)  participatory  preparation  of  school  improvement\nplans;  (vi)  orientation,  training,  and  implementation  of  community  monitoring  of  school\nimprovement;  and (vii) ongoing mentoring for beneficiary schools to implement SBM.\n\n\f17\n\nb.\n\nSchool Improvement through School Development Fund (A-2)\n\n70.\nThe  School  Development  Fund  (SDF)  is  a  flexible  funding  mechanism  to  support\nimplementation  of  school  improvement  plans  (para.  69[v]).  The  primary  targets  are  schools\npredominantly  catering  to  poor  children,  selected  through  poverty  screening.  The  SDF  will\nsupport  the  beneficiary  schools  to  meet  the  minimum  learning  conditions,  to  improve  poor\nchildren\u2019s enrollment (this includes re-entry of out-of-school children), completion, and learning\noutcomes.  Communities,  district  project  management  and  monitoring  units,  and  independent\nmonitors  will  ensure  transparency  and  accountability  of  SDF  use  in  each  school.  External\nauditors  will  annually  audit  SDF  accounts.  Appendix  6  gives  details  of  eligible  items  for  SDF,\ncriteria and process for selecting beneficiary schools and mechanisms.\n\n2.\n\nDistrict Basic Education Development (Part B)\n\n71.\nThis component covers all 21 districts and aims to develop district capacity to effectively\nand  efficiently  plan,  manage,  finance,  and  govern  the  basic  education  system,  as  well  as  to\nimplement and monitor district programs to improve basic education services.\n\na.\n\nDistrict Capacity Building to Plan and Manage Decentralized Basic \nEducation (B-1)\n\n72.\nThis  subcomponent  supports  (i)  school-teacher-pupil  mapping  to  capture  the  status  of\nbasic  education  in  each  district;  (ii)  socioeconomic  surveys  at  district  and  subdistrict  levels  to\ncapture the distribution and concentration of poverty; (iii) data-based self-assessment of equity\nand quality of basic education in each target district; (iv) facilitated assessment of the district\u2019s\ncapacity-building requirements to strengthen planning and management of basic education;  (v)\ndevelopment of a  medium-term (five years) plan to improve the basic education system in each\ndistrict;  and  (vi)  socialization,  orientation,  establishment,    and  operationalization  of  the\neducation or school board in each district.\n\nb.\n\nImproving District Education through District Education \nDevelopment Fund (B-2)\n\n73.\nThis  subcomponent  introduces  a  District  Education  Development  Fund  (DEDF)\u2014a\nflexible  funding  mechanism  that  supports  implementation  of  the  priority  district  education\ndevelopment  programs  and  identified  capacity-building  activities.  While  the  scope  of  DEDF-\nsupported activities may vary across districts, DEDF will support activities aimed at (i) improving\nequity  of  basic  education  services,  including  support  to  poor  children  in  districts  or  schools  in\nbetter-off areas who not benefit from SDF support; (ii) improving the quality of basic education,\nincluding  teacher  development;  and  (iii)  building  district  capacity  to  effectively  and  efficiently\nplan,  manage,  and  govern  basic  education  services.  The  school  board  and  the  Central\nFacilitation  Unit  (CFU)  will  monitor \ntransparency  and\naccountability of DEDF use.\n\nimplementation  progress,  and \n\n 3.\n\nMonitoring, Evaluation and Reporting (Part C)\n\n74.\nThis  component  supports  the  systematic  monitoring  of  the  school  development  and\ndistrict  basic  education  development  components,  as  well  as  transition  monitoring  of  the\nprocess and impacts of decentralization on basic education service delivery in DBEP districts.\n\n\fa.\n\nProgram and financial compliance monitoring (C-1)\n\n18\n\n75.\nThis subcomponent aims to ensure that (i) SDF and DEDF are awarded, distributed and\nused in accordance with the agreed upon criteria and guidelines established by DBEP; and (ii)\npublic  accountability  and  transparency  of  the  SDF  and  DEDF  award  and  use  are  maintained.\nFor SDF, (i) the community will monitor the implementation of SDF-supported activities and use\nof  the  SDF  resources;  (ii)    the  district  project  management  and  monitoring  unit  (DPMMU)  will\nvisit  the  beneficiary  schools  regularly  for  routine  compliance  checks  and  random  compliance\naudit; and (iii) independent monitors will make unannounced visits to randomly selected sample\nschools  to  audit  school  eligibility,  selection  process,  and  SDF  activities  against  the  school\nimprovement  plan.  For  DEDF,  (i)  the  CFU  and  provincial  project  monitoring  unit  (PPMU)  will\nconduct  internal  monitoring  through  regular  visits  to  monitor  a  match  between  the  DEDF-\nsupported  activities  against  the  district  education  development  plan,  and  (ii)  independent\nmonitors  will  conduct  in-depth  compliance  audits  in  each  district  twice  during  project\nimplementation.  Financial auditors will audit SDF and DEDF accounts annually.\n\nb.\n\n Progress and Performance Monitoring (C-2)\n\n76.\nProgress  and  performance  will  be  monitored  to  assure  that  project  implementation\nactivities are meeting targeted outputs and indicators of success. At the school and community\nlevels,  the  school  committee  will  monitor  progress  against  the  school  improvement  plan,  and\nreport on progress and outcome of the SDF-financed activities to parents, teachers, community,\nand  DPMMU  every  quarter.    In  the  districts,  the  DPMMU  will  monitor  SBM  capacity  building,\ndistrict  capacity  building,  and  progress  and  achievement  of  the  DEDF-supported  activities\nagainst  the  district  education  development  plan  on  a  quarterly  basis,  and  report  the  progress\nand issues to the district school boards, district heads, and the CFU.  The CFU will review and\nconsolidate  the  overall  project  progress  against  the  project  implementation  plan  and  logical\nframework, and report the progress and issues to the project steering committee and ADB.\n\nc.\n\nBenefit Evaluation (C-3)\n\n77.\nBenefit  evaluation  will  measure  the  project  results  against  stated  goals,  (i)  to  improve\npoor children\u2019s participation in and completion of nine years of basic education; (ii) to develop\nschool  capacity  to  become  self-managed,  accountable,  transparent,  and  effective;  and  (iii)  to\ndevelop district capacity to effectively plan, manage, and govern a basic education system and\nservices.   Indicators to measure achievement of these goals are presented in the project logical\nframework (Appendix 1).  The actual performance targets for each indicator will be set by each\ndistrict through the district education planning process (para. 72). Project benefits and impacts\nwill be evaluated by independent evaluators at baseline, year four, and year seven.\n\nd.\n\nTransition Monitoring (C-4)\n\n78.\nThe  transition  management  and  monitoring  unit  (TMMU)  at  MONE  will  monitor  the\nprocess and impacts of decentralization on education management and service delivery. ADB-\nfinanced TA29 will support TMMU activities at the national level and baseline situation analysis,\ncapacity  assessment  and  initial  capacity  building  of  first  phase  districts  covered  by  DBEP.\nTechnical  support  for  capacity  assessment,  and  capacity  building  in  the  first  phase  districts  is\nexpected to provide recommendations on systems, regulations, and guidelines to make them\nconducive  to  and  supportive  of  decentralized  education  management,  SBM,  and  delivery  of\noverall education services.\n\n                                                          \n29 TA 3701-INO: Support for Decentralized Education Management, for $990,000, approved on 8 August 2001.\n\n\fC. \n\nCost Estimates\n\n19\n\n79.\nThe estimated total project cost is $125.0 million equivalent, comprising $21.1 million in\nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $103.9  million  equivalent  in  local  currency  cost  (Table  1).  It  is\nproposed that ADB finance the entire foreign exchange cost and $78.9 million equivalent in local\ncurrency (76 percent of the total local currency cost). The Government will finance $25.0 million\nequivalent in local currency. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 7.\n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nADB\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nGovernment\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nComponent\n\nA.

The  loan  will  have  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8\nyears, with an interest charge of 1 percent per year during the grace period and 1.5 percent per\nyear  during  the  remaining  term.  ADB  will  finance  80  percent  of  the  total  project  cost.  ADB\nfinancing will cover 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost and 76 percent of the local cost\n(Table 2). The Government will finance about $25.0 million equivalent in local cost. The national\nGovernment  will  provide  the  loan  proceeds  through  annual  national  budgetary  allocation  to  (i)\ndistricts and (ii) beneficiary schools during project implementation.\n\nSource\n\nAsian Development Bank\nGovernment\n\nTotal\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nForeign\nExchange\n21.1\n0.0\n21.1\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n78.9\n25.0\n103.9\n\nTotal\nCost\n100.0\n25.0\n125.0\n\nPercentage\n80.0\n20.0\n100.0\n\n81.\nIn  line  with  the  decentralization  policy  and  to  encourage  local  government  ownership,\nGovernment  financing  will  be  shared  by  the  central  and  local  governments.  The  central\n\n\f20\n\nGovernment  financing  is  estimated  at  about  $2.8  million  equivalent  (11  percent  of  the\nGovernment financing) and the local governments will finance about $22.2 million equivalent (89\npercent of the Government financing). The central Government will finance (i) salaries, offices,\nand operational costs of the central steering and technical committees, as well as the CFU;  (ii)\norientation,  socialization,  and  training  on  DBEP  concepts  and  key  national  policies  on  basic\neducation;  (iii)  school  mapping  and  other  baseline  surveys;  and  (iv)  progress  and  compliance\nmonitoring.    The  district  governments  will  finance  (i)  salaries,  offices,  and  operational  costs  of\nthe district project implementation staff, (ii) salaries and incentives for school staff at the project\nbeneficiary schools, and (iii) incremental recurrent cost of project schools.\n\n82.\nIt is proposed that ADB provide Special Funds resources and finance 80 percent of the\nproject cost. The reasons include (i) the persistence of severe economic and fiscal constraints\nresulting  in  large  budget  deficits  in  post-crisis  Indonesia;  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  banks\nsuch as the World Bank and the JBIC are now financing 80 percent or more of project costs; (ii)\nDBEP  is  nonrevenue-generating,  primarily  intended  to  support  the  achievement  of  universal\nbasic  education  for  poor  children  and  capacity  building  for  local  governments,  schools,  and\ncommunities; (iii) local governments finance a majority of the counterpart requirement, while the\nnational Government provides some counterpart and absorbs the repayment responsibilities for\nthe loan. The Project is classified as core poverty intervention, targets poor districts and poverty\npockets,  and  expects  considerable  positive  impacts  in  reducing  inequity  in  basic  education\nopportunities  for  poor  children.  Loan  allocation  across  districts  is  based  on  the  estimated\nnumber of children below the poverty line. Poorer districts receive greater loan allocations. NTB,\nwhere  all  seven  districts  have  33-55  percent  of  school-age  children  below  the  poverty  line,\nreceives 65 percent of the loan allocation. Bali, where four districts have 15 percent or more of\nchildren below the poverty line, receives 20 percent of the loan allocation. DKI Jakarta, where\nthe  proportion  of  children  below  the  poverty  line  is  generally  below  10  percent  (but  absolute\nnumbers  are  large)  receives  15  percent  of  the  loan  allocation.  Correspondingly,  poor  districts\nwill  provide  greater  counterpart  financing  responsibilities.  The  economy  of  the  poor  target\ndistricts  is  based  on  agriculture  and  fishery,  and  has  low  revenue-  generating  capacity.  The\ncentral  Government  itself  has  a  limited  budget  as  fiscal  decentralization  transfers  a  larger\nbudget to local governments, and the overall Government budget itself is severely constrained.\n\nE. \n\nThe Executing Agency\n\n83.\nThe Executing Agency of the Project will be MONE. MORA will co-execute the Project\nand  second  staff  to  the  CFU,  PPMUs,  and  DPMMUs  to  ensure  balanced  attention  to  the\nrequirements of madrasah that cater to poor children. Implementing Agencies will be the local\ngovernments of DKI Jakarta,30 nine districts in Bali, and seven districts in NTB. In line with the\ndelineation roles of decentralization between national, provincial, and district governments, with\nthe functions of executing and implementing agencies are defined differently from those in past\nprojects  in  Indonesia.  MONE  and  MORA  will  provide  overall  national  policy  and  technical\ncoordination  and  guidance,  mainly  on  the  SBM  and  minimum  service  standards.  They  will\nensure  that  project  implementation  adheres  to  Government  and  ADB  procedures  and\nguidelines,  as  well  as  be  responsible  for  overall  transparency  and  accountability  in  loan  use.\nProvincial governments, through their education offices, will cover the devolved functions of the\nnational ministries, coordinate cross district activities, and monitor project activities at the district\nlevel.  District  governments,  will  carry  out  day-to-day  management,  administration,  and\nimplementation  and  will  be  accountable  for  the  project  activities  and  financial  management  in\ntheir  respective  districts.    The  project  execution  and  implementation  structures  are  shown  in\nAppendix 8.\n\n                                                          \n30 The  local  government  unit  in  DKI  Jakarta,  the  national  capital  area,  is  administratively  equivalent  to  a  province,\n\nbecause its five districts/municipalities do not have the separate DPRDs..\n\n\fF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n21\n\n1. \n\nProject Organization and Coordination\n\na. \n\nNational and Provincial Levels\n\n84.\nProject  Steering  Committee  (PSC)  and  Central  Technical  Committee  (CTC).  The\nPSC  will  comprise  directors  general  or  equivalent  senior  staff  of  BAPPENAS,  MOF,  MONE,\nMORA, MOHA, representatives of the beneficiary local governments, and representatives of the\nPPMUs.  The  PSC  is  chaired  by  the  director  general  of  primary  and  secondary  education  of\nMONE  and  will  provide  overall  guidance  in  project  implementation.  The  PSC  will  (i)  set  the\nproject  implementation  policy,  (ii)  review  project  progress  and  impact,  (iii)  advise  on  project\nplans, and (iv) facilitate coordination between the different agencies and departments involved\nin  project  implementation.  The  CTC  provides  technical  guidance  and  coordination  at  the\noperational level, and comprises directors and division heads from BAPPENAS, MOF, MONE,\nMORA and MOHA; and is chaired by an official appointed by the PSC. The CTC will (i) oversee\nand give regular technical guidance to the CFU on operationalizing key policies including SBM\nand  minimum  service  standards  through  DBEP;  (ii)  review  the  annual  work  plan  and  budget\nproposals;  (iii)  provide  technical  guidance,  review,  and  approve  project  implementation\nguidelines; (iv) review project monitoring and evaluation reports and advise on follow-up actions;\nand (v) resolve incidents and advise on follow-up actions.\n\n85.\nCentral  Facilitation  Unit.    CFU  will  be  responsible  for  overall  planning,  coordinating,\nimplementing and administering of DBEP, with staff from MONE and MORA. CFU will be based\nat  MONE  and  will  (i)  orient  districts  on  the  DBEP  objectives,  design  framework,  and  project\nadministration;  (ii)  monitor  implementation  in  all  districts  and  the  provision  of  implementation\nsupport  required  by  the  districts;  (iii)  ensure  adequate  allocation  of  counterpart  funds;  (iv)\nconsolidate  quarterly  progress  reports  and  annual  reports,  and  submit  them  to  the  PSC  and\nADB (in English); (v) ensure annual external audit of project accounts (national, as well as local\naccounts  including  DEDF  and  SDF);  (vi)  ensure  timely  submission  to  ADB  of  unaudited  and\naudited  project  financial  reports;  (vii)  ensure  timely  transfer  of  loan  funds  to  districts;  (viii)\nregularly  monitor  compliance  and  progress  of  the  project  activities  in  each  district;  (ix)  identify\npolicy and technical issues requiring steering and technical committee\u2019s review and decisions;\nand  (x)  prepare  for  and  coordinate  regular  review  missions  from  ADB.  The  Government  has\nestablished and staffed CFU.\n\n86.\nProvincial  Project  Monitoring  Unit  (PPMU).    Provinces  in  the  Project  will  primarily\ncarry  out  the  devolved  functions  of  the  national  ministries  (MONE  and  MORA),  and  focus  on\ncoordination,  facilitation,  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  project  activities  and  impacts.  The\nPPMU  will  be  based  in  the  provincial  education  office  and  staffed  by  BAPPEDA,  MORA\nprovincial office staff, and other relevant provincial entities.\n\nb. \n\nDistrict Level\n\n87.\nDistrict  Coordination  Committee  (DCC)/School  Board  Leadership  and  membership\nof the DCCs may vary, depending on the local administrative setup. It will typically be based at\nthe  district  school  board,  and  its  membership  would  overlap  with  the  school  board.  Where\nschool  board  has  not  been  established,  the  DCC  would  include  representatives  from  the\nBAPPEDA,  district  education  offices,  MORA,  as  well  as  representatives  from  local  NGOs  and\ncivil society. The chairperson will be selected by the members of DCC. DCCs will address and\nresolve policy issues affecting DBEP, ensure adequate provision of counterpart funds, staff, and\nfulfillment of other local government responsibilities agreed upon for the project; and approve\n\n\f22\n\nSDF for junior secondary schools. The Government is establishing SBM teams in each district\ninitially within the local education office, but later to be transferred to the district school board.\nThe SBM team will be responsible for implementing the school development component.  DCC\nwill delegate the authority to review and approve school improvement plans of primary schools\nto a supporting unit of DCC at sub-district level.\n\n  will  be \n\nresponsible \n\nDistrict  Project  Management  and  Monitoring  Unit    DPMMUs  to  be  established  in\n88.\neach  district \nfor  day-to-day  management,  administration,  and\nimplementation of DBEP. Functions would include but not be limited to (i) financial planning and\nmanagement of both loan and counterpart funds, and adherence to principles of accountability\nand  transparency  of  project  accounts;  (ii)  coordinating,  planning,  and  implementing  project\nactivities  supported  by  the  DEDF;  (iii)  monitoring  SDF  activities;  and  (iv)  preparing  district\nquarterly  and  annual  financial  statements  and  implementation  progress.  Considering  the\ndiversity of organization structures in the participating local governments, the base office of the\nDPMMU may vary across districts. Each DPMMU will be headed by a project manager whose\nqualification and experience are acceptable to ADB and will be supported by a secretary, and a\nteam  of  6-8  persons  specialized  in  education  programs  (primary  and  junior  secondary,  SBM),\nschool  rehabilitation  management,  finance,  procurement,  and  administration.  To  ensure\ninclusion  of  madrasah  in  the  project  activities,  the  DPMMU  will  have  representatives  from  the\nMORA district office.\n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n89.\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  seven  years,  starting  in  2002  and  will  be\ncompleted in 2008. Implementation will be phased. During the first year (2001-2002), the focus\nbe  on  seven  pilot  districts.  The  remaining  districts  will  phase  in  during  2002  and  2003.  A\nprovisional implementation schedule is in Appendix 9.\n\n3. \n\nProcurement of Goods and Services\n\na. \n\nConsulting Services\n\n90.\nConsultant  will  be  required  for:  (i)  district  capacity  building  and  implementation  support\n(Package  A),  and  (ii)  independent  monitoring  and  evaluation  (Package  B).  Package  A  will\ncomprise one international consultant (12 person-months) and 46 domestic consultants (1,656\nperson-months)  Package  B  will  comprise  one  international  consultant  (24  person-months),  26\ndomestic  consultants  (456  person-months),  and  about  300  test  administrators.  In  addition,  a\nseparate  package  of  mentoring  services  will  be  provided  under  the  SDF  component.  The\nmentoring services will comprise one international consultant (24 person-months), 13 domestic\nconsultants  (684  person-months),  and  about  85  domestic  community  level  mentors  to  work\ndirectly  with  the  schools  and  the  communities.  A  large  number  of  domestic  consultants  are\nrequired because of the Project\u2019s emphasis on capacity building, independent monitoring, and\ndistrict and school-based project implementation. The consultants will be selected and engaged\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements\nacceptable  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for\nconsultants  are  in  Appendix  10.  On  21  May  2001,  ADB  Management  approved  retroactive\nfinancing and advance action for recruiting consultants to permit their timely fielding for effective\nproject  implementation.  The  Project  also  provides  for  retroactive  financing  of  eligible\nexpenditures  incurred  not  earlier  than  9  July  2001  (date  of  the  first  day  of  appraisal),  for  a\nmaximum  of  $2,000,000  equivalent.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that  such  advance\naction and the provision for retroactive financing do not commit ADB to finance any part of the\nProject.\n\n\fb. \n\nTraining and staff development\n\n23\n\n91.\nThe  Project  will  train  parents,  school  communities,  school  staff,  and  district  officials\nthrough  workshops,  mentoring,  focused  group  discussions,  seminars,  and  organized  training\nprograms.    Training  and  orientation  will  benefit  about  58,660  community  members,  principals,\nteachers  and  local  government  officials.  Local  governments  will  procure  organized  teacher\ndevelopment  programs,  depending  on  district  needs,  to  be  implemented  by  training  providers\nengaged through a local competitive process, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use\nof Consultants.\n\nc. \n\nCivil Works and School Furniture\n\n92.\nThe Project will support the rehabilitation of school facilities that do not meet minimum\nconditions for learning. It is estimated that DBEP will cover rehabilitation of approximately 1000\nprimary and junior secondary schools. Small scale civil works (maximum of $12,000 per school)\nin  remote  and  rural  sites  with  associated  difficulties  in  material  delivery  are  unlikely  to  attract\ninternational  or  domestic  contractors  and  suppliers  at  the  national  level.  Past  experience\nindicate  that  community-managed  rehabilitation  ensures  greater  transparency  accountability,\nand cost-effectiveness (footnote 27), and better sense of ownership and facility maintenance by\nthe communities. Therefore, civil works for school rehabilitation and school furniture (both labor\nand  materials)  will  be  procured  locally  by  beneficiary  schools  and  communities  through\nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB,  based  on  procedures  already  working  under  ongoing  ADB-\nfinanced projects.\n\n93.\nIn  the  context  of  the  three-year  school  improvement  plan  (para.  69),  the  schools  and\ncommunities  will  jointly  prepare  a  proposal  for  facility  rehabilitation.  Once  the  school\nimprovement  plans  are  approved  by  the  DCC  for  junior  secondary  schools  and  by  subdistrict\ncoordinating  committee  for  primary  schools,  the  school  committees  of  eligible  schools  will\nestablish community school rehabilitation teams. The teams will prepare detailed plan for school\nfacility  rehabilitation  with  the  assistance  of  the  school  rehabilitation  supervisor  at  the  district\nlevel.  The  school  committee  and  the  community  school  rehabilitation  team  will  then  organize\nand  implement  the  rehabilitation  work,  largely  utilizing  locally  available  construction  materials,\nwhere possible, and labor provided by the community members.\n\nd. \n\nOffice Equipment\n\n94.\nThe  Project  will  procure  a  small  amount  of  office  equipment  for  the  project\nimplementation  units  (CFU,  PPMU,  and  DPMMU),  such  as  computers  for  administration  and\ndata management, and vehicles. Each package is estimated to cost less than $50,000 and will\nbe  procured  under  direct  purchase  procedures  showing  evidence  of  limited  local  tender  to\nobtain  the  most  competitive  prices.  As  each  district  has  slightly  different  requirements  and\ndistricts begin project implementation in phases, the equipment will be packaged and procured\nby each district in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.\n\ne. \n\nInstructional Materials and Library Books\n\n95.\nThe Project will finance the purchase of textbooks and other teaching/learning materials\nthrough the SDF school improvement category. Each school will determine actual requirements\nwhich  will  not  exceed  $6,000  per  school.  The  schools  will  select  and  purchase  textbooks  and\nmaterials using direct purchase procedures. This procedure was selected because lessons from\npast  and  on-going  projects  indicate  that  consolidated  purchase  through  local  competitive\nbidding does not result in economy of scale or timely delivery. Delivery by contracted forwarders\n\n\f24\n\nis  not  cost-effective  or  reliable  for  remote  and  rural  schools.  School  and  community-managed\npurchase and delivery are more likely to ensure timely and accurate delivery.  The procurement\nmode and the packages are summarized in Appendix 11.\n\n4. \n\nDisbursements, Accounts, Auditing and Reports\n\n96.\nTo  expedite  the  disbursement  of  loan  funds,  the  Government  will  establish  an  imprest\n(special)  account  at  Bank  Indonesia.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,\nreplenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook  and\ndetailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  ceiling  of  the  imprest\naccount will not exceed $10 million. Funds for DEDF and SDF categories will be transferred to\nbeneficiary  districts  and  schools  from  the  imprest  account  (Appendix  12).  The  districts  and\nschools will use the statement of expenditures (SOE) procedures.\n\n97.\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify  the  goods\nand  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  maintained.  Separate  accounts  of  the\nProject  will  be  maintained,  and  accounts  and  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  by\ninternationally  accepted  external  auditors  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing  standards\nacceptable to ADB.  Certified copies of such audited accounts will be submitted to ADB within\nnine  months  after  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year.  All  such  reports  and  statements  will  be\nsubmitted  in  English.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  finance  from  the  loan  proceeds  costs\nrelated to the annual auditing.\n\n98.\nThe  CFU  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  on  the  implementation  of  project-funded\nactivities.    The  reports  will  be  in  a  format  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  will  indicate,  among  other\nthings,  progress  made  against  established  targets,  problems  encountered  during  the  quarter,\nsteps taken and steps proposed to resolve the problems, compliance with loan covenants, and\nproject activities to be undertaken during the next quarter.  A project completion report will be\nprepared within three months of project completion.  All reports will be in English.\n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Measures\n\n99.\nThe  Mission  explained  the  ADB  anticorruption  policy,  particularly  the  section  on  fraud\nand  corruption,  as  stated  in  ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants.   Project  accounts  including  accounts  held  for  SDF  and  DEDF  will  be  audited\nannually by external independent auditors, and loan allocation provides financing for this.\n\n6. \n\nComprehensive Review\n\n100. Considering  the  process  orientation  of  the  Project,  comprehensive  reviews  of  project\nimplementation will be conducted at least twice, at the end of years 2 and 4. The first review will\nfocus  on  the  effectiveness  of  the  implementation  mechanisms  of  the  SDF,  DEDF,  funds  flow,\nand poverty targeting. Improvements, as required, will be defined and agreed upon during this\nreview.  The  second  review  will  focus  on  the  overall  benefits  of  the  project  and  likely\nachievement of the Project objectives and goals by the end of the project.\n\nG. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1. \n\nEnvironment\n\nThe Project will not have significant adverse environmental impacts, and is classified in\n\n101.\nenvironmental category C. Rehabilitation will comprise minor repairs of existing schools,\n\n\f25\n\nprimarily on land already allocated specifically for schools. Nevertheless, MONE, MORA and the\nparticipating local governments will ensure that the site, design, construction, and operation of\nschool  facilities  under  the  Project  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Environmental Guidelines for Selected\nInfrastructure Development Projects and relevant environmental review procedures.\n\n2. \n\nPoverty and Social Measures\n\n102. About 1.9 million families in the DBEP area are estimated to live below the poverty line.\nThe nature of poverty and poverty incidence (percentage of families living below the established\npoverty  line)  in  the  three  project  areas  vary  considerably.  DKI  Jakarta  has  urban-based\neconomic sectors and socioeconomic structures. While the overall poverty incidence is relatively\nlow (ranging from 1.4 percent in South Jakarta to 9 percent in North Jakarta), DKI Jakarta has\nthe  highest  Gini  coefficient  (0.461),  indicating  the  worst  income  inequality  in  Indonesia.  Poor\nhouseholds in DKI Jakarta are generally employed in the informal sector with low and irregular\nwages. Bali province  as  a whole has a strong economic base, associated mainly with tourism\nand related service industries. However, northern districts that depend on agriculture and fishery\nexhibit high poverty incidence. While poverty incidence in Denpasar City is 1.5 percent, poverty\nincidence in the northern districts is 18.8 percent in Karagasem and 14.4 percent in Buleleng.\nNTB, one of the poorest provinces in the country, is characterized by traditional rural poverty in\nIndonesia,  based  on  predominantly  tenant  agriculture  and  fishery  economy.  Poverty  incidence\nin NTB ranges from 24.2 percent in Mataram City to 45 percent in Dumpu.\n\n103. DBEP design takes these socioeconomic features into account by using a two-pronged\ntargeting approach to (i) skew resource allocation to districts with high poverty incidence and to\nschools serving poor areas (largely rural poor), and (ii) provide selective intervention in poverty\npockets  in  better-off  areas  (largely  urban  poor).  The  School  Development  component  directly\ntargets  schools  serving  poor  areas,  on  the  assumption  that  their  school  population  is\npredominantly children from poor households. Under this component, socioeconomic surveys at\nthe  subdistrict  level  and  rapid  assessments  at  school/community  level,  respectively,  will  be\nconducted to capture the distribution and concentration of poverty within districts as well as to\nobtain  and  validate  site-specific  and  school-specific  information.  Based  on  the  findings,  the\nschools  in  each  district  will  be  ranked  according  to  the  expected  enrollment  of  poor  children,\nincluding the presence of out-of-school children for potential reentry to the school. Priority will be\naccorded to schools where at least 50 percent of the school population are children from poor\nhouseholds.    Such  schools  will  be  eligible  to  apply  for  support  under  the  SBM  and  SDF\nprograms.  In this manner, the poverty-oriented project provisions will be allocated to match the\nactual needs of the schools and the poor communities they serve.  Through the District Basic\nEducation  Development  component,  DBEP  provides  a  funding  mechanism  that  will  support\ndistrict activities to be proposed in the district education development plans aimed at targeting\nsimilar  support  for  poor  children  attending  schools  in  nonpoor  or  less  poor  areas.    Thus,\ntargeting of poor children will be effected in the context of a district-level effort to address social\nequity in the school system.  The mechanisms are described in Appendix 6.\n\n104.\nTwo other pro-poor features are incorporated in the DBEP implementation arrangements\nto adequately match services and resources with site-specific needs of the poor communities.\nThe amount of assistance to be allocated under the SBM and SDF activities to target schools\nwill  be  proportional  to  the  number  of  poor  children  they  are  expected  to  serve.  Funds  are\nearmarked  for  surveys  and  rapid  assessments  to  ensure  that  the  targeted  schools  have  the\nnecessary  information  for  accurate  targeting  of  poor  children  and  for  executing  their  school\nimprovement plans.\n\n105. DBEP  will  directly  address  the  basic  education  opportunities  of  children  from  poor\nfamilies,  examine  gender  barriers  to  basic  education,  and  promote  community  involvement  in\n\n\f26\n\nschool management. The major target group is disadvantaged children i.e., those from families\nengaged in the informal sector, in subsistence farming and fishing, in manual labor in the slum\nareas; female-headed households; and children from indigenous communities mostly below the\npoverty line.  The Project makes the community and schools, rather than distant district offices,\nthe major decision point to identify and prioritize support required by poor families to make their\nchildren to enroll and complete basic education.  The SDF provides financial and other support\nto reduce pressure on poor families to enter into debt to meet large expenditures such as entry\nfees and costs of uniforms.\n\nThe Project incorporates several measures to address gender concerns and to meet the\n106.\nneeds of girls in acquiring and completing basic education. Women will be encouraged to take\nan active role in parent-teacher associations and school board committees within communities.\nSeparate  toilets  for  boys  and  girls  provided  as  part  of  the  school  rehabilitation  program  will\nbenefit girls\u2019 enrollment.  Targeted scholarships will make it easier for girls from poor families to\nattend and complete primary and junior secondary schools. They will also directly benefit girls\nwho  bear  the  responsibility  for  meeting  household  needs,  including  school  supplies,  monthly\nschool fees, and other incidental expenses related to education.\n\n107.\nThe  Project  will  support  the  Government  in  designing  mechanisms  that  promote  more\ncommunity  and  civil  society  participation  in  basic  education  planning  and  management,  and\nperformance monitoring.  The formation of school committees will lead to improved community-\nschool  relationship  through  interaction  programs,  and  teacher-parent  meetings.  The  broad-\nbased school education committee will be an effective medium in guaranteeing the sustainability\nof decentralized education services.\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nProject Beneficiaries\n\nThe  Project  almost  exclusively  targets  children  from  poor  families  (para.  103).  It  is\n108.\nestimated  that  between  56  and  78  percent  (an  average  of  71  percent)  of  beneficiaries  will  be\nchildren  from  poor  households.  The  Project  is  estimated  to  benefit  1.26  million  primary  and\nsecondary school children (ages 7-12 and 13-15 years, respectively) in the 21 DBEP districts.\nOf this number, 0.896 million children (71 percent of the total beneficiaries) are estimated to be\nfrom families living below the poverty line. The Project will benefit about 5 percent of all school-\nage  children  in  Jakarta,  29  percent  in  Bali,  and  64  percent  in  NTB.    Beneficiary  children  in\nJakarta  will  consist  largely  of  those  residing  in  slum  areas.    Beneficiary  children  in  Bali  are\npredominantly  in  the  northern  districts  with  a  high  concentration  of  poor  tenant  farming  and\nfishing communities.\n\n109. By  targeting  poor  children  and  using  of  poverty  indicators  in  the  selection  criteria  for\nbeneficiary  schools  (para.  103  and  Appendix  6),  the  Project  is  expected  to  generate  direct\nbenefits  for  children  from  below  the  poverty  line  and  low-income  families  in  two  ways:  (i)\nproviding  opportunities  to  obtain  and  complete  primary  and  junior  high  school  education  by\nhaving  access  to  scholarships,  school  fee  waivers,  tutorials  and  other  support;  and  (ii)\nsupporting completion of junior secondary education, improving their value in the job market and\nopening  opportunities  to  continue  formal  education  through  senior  secondary  education  and\nbeyond.  Such  benefits  will  be  reflected  in  (i)  surveys  demonstrating  at  least  50  percent  of  the\nbeneficiaries of the scholarship and school block grants program will be children from families\nbelow  the  poverty  line;  and  (ii)  increased  NER  and  completion  rates  among  the  children  from\nfamilies  below  the  poverty  line.  Benefit  evaluation  studies  to  be  conducted  during  year  4  and\nyear  7  of  project  implementation  will  allow  for  monitoring  of  increased  primary  school\n\n\f27\n\ncompletion, transition to junior secondary schools, junior secondary school completion, and the\ngraduate\u2019s absorption into the labor market or entry into higher education.\n\n110.\nThe Project will improve the ability of the beneficiary schools to deliver basic education,\nenhance the quality of education, and meet the needs of low-income and poor families through\nbetter  on-site  targeting  and  direct  parent-school  communication  to  remove  constraints  to\neducational  achievements  of  children \nfor  such\nimprovements  include  (i)  participation  of  communities  in  the  SBM  subcomponent,  (ii)  budget\nallocations for scholarships and other school aid from the SDF to beneficiary schools, (iii) scores\nreflecting  school  efficiency  and  quality  of  education  services,  and  (iv)  reduced  repetition  and\ndropout rates among students.\n\nlocal  communities.  The \n\nindicators \n\nin \n\nB. \n\nPoverty and Social Impacts\n\n111. Preliminary  estimates  during  DBEP  preparation  indicate  that  about  3,000  schools\nclustered in poor communities in 17 districts would be covered under the SDF subcomponent,\nand an additional 115,000 children from poor households in all 21 districts will receive support\nunder  the  social  equity  program  under  the  DEDF  subcomponent.  Assuming  that  all  target\nschools are eligible for support, about 56-78 percent of students will be from poor families. It is\nnot  possible  to  provide  more  accurate  projections  than  these  estimates  as  the  specific  project\nsites and beneficiary schools will only be determined during implementation, based on thorough\nsocioeconomic  surveys  to  accurately  capture  the  geographic  distribution  and  concentration  of\npoverty.  Nevertheless,  the  special  support  for  poor  children  and  the  targeting  criteria  for\nbeneficiary school selection will ensure that the Project covers children from families below the\npoverty  line,  and  that  at  least  50  percent  of  the  total  beneficiaries  of  scholarships  and  other\nsupport will be from poor families. It should be noted that children from low-income but nonpoor\nfamilies will also be eligible for special assistance if they are otherwise unable to attend school.\nIn this manner, the Project is designed to address poverty using income as well as nonincome\nindicators  of  social  deprivation  among  families  with  school-age  children.  Through  this  broader\ninterpretation  of  social  deprivation,  DBEP  will  contribute  to  the  national  objective  of  providing\nuniversal access to basic education.\n\nC. \n\nAffordability and Sustainability\n\n112.\nIn  line  with  decentralization,  district  governments  will  finance  the  majority  of  the\ncounterpart  and  incremental  recurrent  costs.  Financial  capacity,  particularly  local  revenue-\ngenerating capacity, differs considerably across the project districts. Jakarta and a few southern\ndistricts in Bali have a fairly strong local revenue-generating base. On the other hand, the poor\ndistricts  in  Bali  and  NTB,  with  economies  based  on  agriculture  and  fishery,  have  limited\nrevenue-generating  capacity  and  are  highly  dependent  on  budget  transfers  from  the  national\nGovernment.\n\n113.\nIn Jakarta and southern Bali districts, the Project selectively addresses poverty pockets.\nThe  numbers of  beneficiary  children, resource allocations, counterpart financing requirements,\nand  incremental  recurrent  costs  are  relatively  small.  The  Project  is  easily  affordable  and\nsustainable  in  those  districts.  The  loan  investment  accounts  for  about  0.5  percent  of  the  total\ndistrict  development  budget,  and  about  7  percent  of  the  district  development  budget  for\neducation. Counterpart financing accounts for 0.1-0.2 percent of the total district recurrent and\ndevelopment budget annually. The incremental recurrent cost to sustain the project benefits will\nrequire about 0.1 percent of the total district recurrent budget and less than 0.3 percent of the\nprojected district recurrent budget for education.\n\n\f28\n\nThe  Project  skews  loan  allocations  to  poor  districts  in  northern  Bali  and  NTB.  The\n114.\nfunds  requirements,  and\nloan  allocations,  counterpart \nnumber  of  beneficiary  children, \nincremental recurrent costs are greater in those poor districts where financial capacity is not the\nstrongest.  These  districts  now  allocate  about  31-43  percent  of  the  district  budget  to  basic\neducation.  DBEP  will  be  affordable  and  sustainable  in  the  poor  beneficiary  districts,  provided\nthat  (i)  ADB  finances  80  percent  of  the  project  costs,  and  (ii)  beneficiary  districts  are  able  to\nmaintain or increase the level of the local budget through transfers from the national budget or\nincreased local revenue, as well as maintain and progressively increase the budget allocation to\nbasic education.\n\n115.\nIn the poor project districts, DBEP investment is estimated to account for 4-20 percent of\nthe  total  district  development  budget  or  56-150  percent  of  the  district  education  development\nbudget  annually.  DBEP  will  provide  significantly  more  development  resources  to  basic\neducation in the target districts. The additional development resources and counterpart budget\nwill  be  primarily  directed  to  schools  catering  to  poor  children;  these  schools  are  estimated  to\naccount  for  50-60  percent  of  the  schools  in  the  poor  project  districts.  To  maximize  the  use  of\ninvestment  resources,  DBEP  will  employ  community-managed  school  rehabilitation,  which  is\nexpected to cost 36 percent less than contractor-managed rehabilitation. Counterpart financing\nis  estimated  to  require  0.6-1.9  percent  annually  of  the  total  district  budget,  or  1.2-4.1  percent\nannually the district education budget.\n\n116. Annual incremental recurrent cost is estimated to account for about 2 percent of the total\ndistrict  recurrent  budget.  Use  of  community-managed  school  rehabilitation  minimizes\nincremental  recurrent  costs  to  the  local  government,  as  materials  are  locally  available  and\nfamiliar techniques are used permitting regular maintenance by the communities. To strengthen\nthe local government\u2019s resource base to sustain the benefits, the Project includes building the\ncapacity  to  make  financial  plans  and  mobilize  resources.  This  support  aims  to  help  local\ngovernments  explore  options  to  maintain  and  increase  their  budget  allocation  to  basic\neducation,  as  well  as  options  to  mobilize  nonpublic  resources,  such  as  contribution  from  local\nindustries and foundations.\n\n117. An  important  gage  of  project  sustainability  is  incorporation  of  the  school  block  grant\nscheme in the local government financing mechanisms for education. The timing of the Project\nis  favorable  at  the  outset  of  decentralization  when  local  governments  are  in  the  process  of\ndetermining structure and mechanisms to channel resources to schools. The national policy on\nSBM is another positive factor, setting an example of transferring the national budget to junior\nsecondary schools as block grants. To pave the way to sustain the block grant scheme, ongoing\nADB-financed  TAs31  are  providing  parallel  support  covering  capacity  building  and  policy\ndialogue  on  ways  to  institutionalize  the  school  block  grant  scheme  in  decentralized  education\nfinance mechanisms.\n\nD. \n\nRisks\n\n118.\nThe  project  risks  are  largely  attributable  to  the  combination  of  the  decentralized\nimplementation  arrangements  and  intended  targeting  to  poverty-affected  areas.  Key  risks\ninclude  (i)  decentralized  project  implementation  context,  (ii)  challenges  exacerbated  by  the\nProject\u2019s attempts to reach the poorest communities and schools that are often remote and hard\nto reach, and (iii) heavy dependence upon consultants.\n\n                                                          \n31 TA 3042-INO: Capacity Building for Decentralized Social Services, for $900,000, approved on 9 July 1998, and TA\n\n3071-INO: Support for Decentralized Education Management, for $990,00, approved on 8 August 2001.\n\n\f29\n\n119. Consistent  with  decentralization  laws,  the  Project  will  be  implemented  by  district\ngovernments. A series of discussions with the local governments in DBEP pilot districts during\nproject  preparation  confirmed  their  high  level  of  interest  and  commitment.  Most  districts  have\nsome  experience  in  implementing  investment  projects  in  the  social  sectors  financed  by  either\nADB or the World Bank. Nevertheless, each district government is at the developmental stage,\nand a series of system, organizational, and staff changes are anticipated during the course of\nproject  implementation.  In  addition,  variations  are  expected  in  the  organizational  and  system\nsetups in each district, including their relationships with the provincial and national governments.\nTo safeguard against risks associated with the newly decentralized administrative context, the\nProject  (i)  integrates  a  major  capacity-building  component;  (ii)  emphasizes  direct  resource\ntransfer  to  and  involvement  of  schools  and  communities,  the  stable  delivery  point  of  basic\neducation services; and (iii) uses a process-oriented design that maintains maximum flexibility.\nThe  implementation  schedule  is  longer  than  usual,  anticipating  a  slow  start-up  and  low\ndisbursement  during  the  first  few  years.  Districts  will  begin  implementation  in  phases.  Undue\npressure on fast disbursement during the first years may undermine the need to build sufficient\nand accountable project implementation capacity.\n\nThe Project targets poor areas that are often remote and difficult to reach, and where the\n120.\ncapacity  of  the  schools  and  communities  is  limited.  Building  the  capacity  of  schools  and\ncommunities  is  a  pre-requisite  before  development  activities  and  resource  flows  start.  Such\ncapacity building in difficult-to-reach areas will require on-site, ongoing technical support that is\nnot  threatening  to  the  local  communities.  The  Project  plans  to  engage  a  large  number  of\ncommunity- worker type consultants (i.e. mentors) that can best be provided through NGOs and\ncommunity  based  organizations.  While  experience  in  ongoing  projects  has  been  positive,  the\nuse  of  NGOs  and  community-based  organizations  is  not  yet  a  common  practice  in  Indonesia.\nExperience in Indonesia indicates considerable lead time is often needed for the Government to\nengage loan-financed consultants; this may take even longer if the Project requires new types of\nservice providers.  To minimize the risk that project implementation may be consultant-led and\nto ensure localization of the project experience, the Project primarily uses domestic consultants\nand few international consultants. Mentors for SBM and decentralization/implementation support\nconsultants  will  work  closely  with  the  government  counterpart  teams.  To  ensure  timely\nengagement,  advance  action  and  retroactive  financing  for  engaging  consultants  has  been\nendorsed.\n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe Government has given the following specific assurances, in addition to the standard\n\n121.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\nA. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nSpecial Assurances\n\nLaws 22 and 25 of 1999.  The provision of funds from the loan proceeds and the\ncorresponding  counterpart  funds  necessary  for  financing  Project  activities  will\ncontinue throughout the Project implementation period by earmarking the funds,\nnotwithstanding  any  changes  in  national  or  district  government  responsibilities\narising  from  the  full  implementation  of  Laws  22  and  25  of  1999,  unless  ADB\notherwise agrees.\n\nFunds  Channeling.  Unless  ADB  otherwise  agrees,  the  loan  proceeds  will  be\nthroughout  project\ntransferred \nimplementation to make payments for all Project expenditure, including, to (a) the\nparticipating districts, and (b) the beneficiary schools.\n\nthrough  annual  budgetary  allocation \n\n\f(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n30\n\nCounterpart  Funds.  All  counterpart  funds  for  project  implementation  will  be\nprovided on time. The Government and the participating districts will make timely\nsubmissions  of  annual  budgetary  appropriation  requests  and  ensure  prompt\ndisbursement of appropriated funds during each year of project implementation.\n\nExternal  Auditors,  Annual  Auditing  and  Financial  Statements.  External\nauditors will be engaged to audit project accounts, including the DEDF and SDF\naccounts.  The  consolidated  annual  audited  accounts  and  financial  statements,\ntogether  with  audit  reports,  in  English,  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  nine\nmonths following the end of the relevant Government fiscal year.\n\nPoverty  and  Social  Dimensions.    Priority  will  be  given  to  children  from  poor\nfamilies, remote rural villages, and urban slum areas in the participating districts.\nAt  least  50  percent  of  the  beneficiaries  are  children  from  households  below  the\npoverty line. Beneficiary sub-districts and schools will be prioritized by incidence\nand depth of poverty, based on (a)  an integrated poverty factor calculated from\nthe proportion of families below the poverty line in the subdistrict, (b) NER, and\n(c) dropout rate. The process of prioritizing must be participatory.\n\nSDF  and  DEDF.  SDF  will  be  given  to  schools  registered  with  either  the  local\ngovernment of the project district or MORA or both, that serve poor communities\nand  students.  Identifying  and  selecting  eligible  schools,  and  the  mechanics  of\nawarding SDF will follow the criteria set out in Appendix 7. DEDF will be awarded\nto participating districts that have satisfied the requirements set out in Appendix\n6.\n\n(vii) \n\nSupport  to  Madrasah.   Madrasah  will  be  included  in  the  process  of  identifying\neligible  schools,  selecting \nidentifying\nbeneficiaries for the programs supported by the DEDF.\n\nthe  SDF  beneficiary  schools,  and \n\n(viii)  Community  Participation.    The  national  and  local  governments  will  ensure\ninvolvement  of  civil  societies  and  full  participation  of  beneficiary  communities  in\nimplementing  the  Project,  and  preparing  and  implementing  of  proposals  for  the\nSDF  in  preparing  and  implementing  the  DEDF.    DCC/school  board  will  have\nadequate staff to represent madrasah.\n\nCounterpart  Staff.    All  necessary  staff  and  facilities  for  the  CFU,  PPMU,\nDCC/school  board,  SBM,  and  DPMMU,  will  be  maintained  throughout  project\nimplementation.  The  Government  and  ADB  will  review  the  effectiveness  of  the\nCFU  and  DPMMUs  one  year  after  the  effective  date,  and  if  required,  adopt\nmeasures to improve implementation effectiveness.\n\nMonitoring  and  Benefit  Evaluation.  The  award,  distribution,  and  use  of  the\nSDF  and  DEDF  will  be  monitored  to  ensure  that  they  are  carried  out  in\naccordance  with  the  agreed  upon  criteria  and  guidelines  established  by  the\nProject.  To  ensure  that  public  accountability  and  transparency  are  maintained,\nbenefit  evaluation  activities  will  measure  the  project  results  against  the  Project\ngoals.\n\n(xi) \n\nGender.  Special  measures  will  be  undertaken  to  promote  the  participation  of\nwomen in the project activities.  In each participating district, (a) the school\n\n\f31\n\neducation  committees,  subdistrict  selection  committees,  and  board  education\ncommittees  will  include  at  least  two  women  representatives;  (b)  women  will\ncomprise  at  least  50  percent  of  teachers  in  the  development  programs;  (c)\nwomen  will  compose  of  at  least  30  of  the  participants  in  workshops  on  SBM\ntraining;  (d)  girls  will  comprise  at  least  50  percent  of  the  recipients  of\nscholarships; and (e) separate sanitation facilities for girls and boys will be part of\nthe school rehabilitation component.\n\n(xii) \n\nEnvironment.    Although  no  significant  environmental  impacts  were  identified,\nsite selection, design, construction, and operation of school facilities rehabilitated\nunder  the  Project  will  be  implemented  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental\nguidelines.\n\nB.\n\nCondition for Loan Effectiveness\n\nThe effectiveness of the Loan Agreement will be subject to the issuance of decrees by\n\n122.\nthe Minister of National Education establishing the PSC and CTC.\n\nC. \n\nCondition for Loan Disbursement\n\n123. Except  for  mobilization  payment  for  consultants,  loan  disbursement  will  not  take  place\nuntil:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\ndecrees  establishing  of  the  DCC/school  board  and  DPMMU  are  issued  for  the\nseven districts in the first phase.\n\nthe CFU has prepared and submitted to ADB, in form and substance satisfactory\nto  ADB,  the  guidelines  on  consequences  of  noncompliance  with  or  violation  of\nthe  project  criteria  on  the  use  of  DEDF  and  SDF,  and  the  general  code  of\nconduct on the use of the loan proceeds.\n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  Loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\n124.\nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to\nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  77,579,000  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Decentralized  Basic\nEducation  Project,  with  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  with  an\ninterest charge at the rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per\nannum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with\nthose set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board.\n\n 31 October 2001\n\nTadao Chino\n    President\n\n\f32\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nNumber Title\n\nPage\n\nCited on\n(page, para.)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nProject Framework\n\nThe Formal Education System in Indonesia\n\nEducation Expenditures in Indonesia\n\nFinancial Decentralization\n\nADB Assistance to the Education Sector\n\nSchool Development Fund and District Education\nDevelopment Fund\n\nDetailed Cost Estimates\n\nProject Management Organization\n\nProject Implementation Schedule\n\nTerms of Reference for Consulting Services\n\nIndicative Procurement Packages\n\nFunds Flow and Disbursement Procedures\n\nPoverty and Social Assessment\n\n33\n\n39\n\n40\n\n41\n\n43\n\n45\n\n50\n\n51\n\n52\n\n53\n\n57\n\n58\n\n60\n\n1, 2\n\n2, 6\n\n3, 8\n\n4, 12\n\n9, 36\n\n17, 70\n\n19, 79\n\n20, 83\n\n22, 89\n\n22, 90\n\n23, 95\n\n24, 96\n\n27,111\n\n\f33\n\nAppendix 1 page 1\n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\n\nDesign Summary\n\nProject Indicators / Targets\n\nMonitoring\nMechanisms\n\nAssumptions and\nRisks\n\nTo support PROPENAS\n(National Development Plan)\ngoal to achieve universal nine-\nyear basic education that\nserves the needs of poor and\nmarginalized people and is\nresponsive to local needs\n\nImproved indicators in PROPENAS 2001-\n2005 such as gross enrollment rates\n(GERs) of 120.7 percent for primary\neducation and 78.9 percent for junior\nsecondary education.

\n\nintergovernment \n\nDecentralization  has  drastically  changed \n\n1. \nin\nIndonesia.  Before  decentralization,  there  were  two  transfers  from  the  central  Government  to\nregional governments: (i) subsidy to regions, which was mainly used to finance salaries of local\ncivil servants; and (ii) regional development funds for development expenditures. These central\ntransfers  were  recorded  in  the  regional  budgets  as  \u201csubsidy\u201d  and  \u201ccontribution\u201d,  respectively.\nStarting with fiscal year (FY) 2001, both transfers were eliminated and combined into the more\nflexible General Allocation Fund (GAF) set at minimum of 25 percent of total domestic revenues\nin the central Government budget. The GAF is allocated based on a formula that incorporates\nfinancial needs and the capacity of all regions. The GAF can be allocated for any purpose at the\ndiscretion  of  the  regional  governments.  With  the  introduction  of  GAF  and  the  widening\nresponsibilities of the regions, regional governments are expected to be able to make decisions\non budgetary allocations based on their own priorities.\n\nAnother newly introduced transfer channel is the Special Allocation Fund (SAF). Funds\n2. \nare  made  available  to  regional  governments  for  investments  in  specific  sectors  given  national\npriority. The funds can be provided on a matching-grant for basis projects that originate from the\nregional governments. In this system, regional governments are required to provide at least 10\npercent as counterpart funds.\n\n3. \nAn  additional  transfer  from  the  central  government  is  revenue  sharing.  Even  before\ndecentralization, regions received a portion of revenues from the land and building tax, duty for\nobtaining  rights  on  land  and  building,  and  forestry  and  mining  royalties.  With  decentralization,\nthe regional governments can receive larger shares from these revenues and also new shares\nfrom the personal income tax and the on natural resources including oil, gas, and fishery.\n\nIn  the  central  Government  budget  for  2001  includes  all  three  transfers  totalling  $808\n4. \nmillion  (revenue  sharing  $201  million,  GAF  $599  million,  and  SAF  $9  million).  Compared  with\nthe previous year, the amount transferred to regions increased by 82.7 percent. Of this amount,\nprovincial  governments  received  $106  million  and  district  governments,  which  are  the  major\ntarget of decentralization, received $701 million (Table A4).\n\nTable A4: Central Government Budget\n\nItem\n\nFiscal Year\n\n2000\n\nFiscal Year\n\n2001\n\n$ Million\n\nPercentage\n\n$ Million\n\nPercentage\n\nGrant Total\nCentral Spending\n\nRoutine Expenditures\nDevelopment Expenditures\n\nTransfer to Regions\n\nShared Revenues\nGeneral Allocation Fund\nSpecial Allocation Fund\nSource: Ministry Finance.\n\n2,600\n2,518\n1,813\n345\n442\n35\n408\n-\n\n100\n83.0\n69.7\n13.3\n17.0\n1.3\n15.7\n-\n\n3,126\n2,317\n1,882\n435\n808\n201\n599\n    9\n\n100\n74.1\n60.2\n13.9\n25.9\n6.4\n19.2\n0.3\n\nIncrease\n2000-2001\nPercent\n\n20.2\n7.4\n3.8\n25.9\n82.7\n486.1\n46.7\n-\n\n\f42\n\nAppendix 4, page 2 \n\nAccording  to  Law  25/1999,  regional  governments  have  the  following  resources  for  their\n5. \nbudgets: (i) surplus of previous year; (ii) local revenue; (iii) balanced fund, which consists of revenue\nsharing, the GAF, and SAF; and (iv) regional loans.\n\nPrior  to  decentralization  regional  revenues  depended  heavily  on  the  central  transfers.  In  the\n6. \nlast five years (FY 1995/96 to FY 2000), dependence on transfers from the central Government was\n58.3  percent  in  provinces  and  84.2  percent  in  the  districts.  Local  revenues  accounted  for  only  33.5\npercent and 11.7 percent, respectively.\n\n7. \nTraditionally,  regional  governments  had  access  to  only  limited  tax  instruments.  Major\nprovincial revenues came from the tax on automobiles, the fee for change of vehicle ownership, and\nthe tax on fuel for vehicles. The tax rates were determined by the central Government. At the district\nlevel,  there  were  many  minor  excise  taxes  such  as  hotel  and  restaurant  tax,  entertainment  tax,\nadvertisement tax, tax on street lights, etc. The district government could set their tax rates within the\nceiling  rates  set  by  the  central  Government.  The  Government  revised  the  regional  tax  law  (Law\n34/2000), and a new sharing scheme between the provinces and districts was introduced. However,\nwith the current assignment of tax instruments, it will be difficult for regional governments to improve\ntheir revenue position and significantly reduce dependence on central transfers.\n\n8. \nRegional loans (development receipts) are marginal in the total revenues and account for only\nabout  1  percent  in  both  provinces  and  districts.  Weak  revenue  bases  have  limited  the  scope  for\nregional  borrowing,  leading  to  heavy  dependence  on  central  transfers.  To  improve  their  borrowing\ncapacity  regional  governments  must  increase  their  revenues.  However,  the  possibility  of  improving\ntheir revenue position is limited.\n\n9. \nThe  structure  of  the  regional  budget  is  prescribed  by  the  central  government.  Regional\nbudgets  are  divided  into  revenues  and  expenditures.  The  expenditure  part  comprises  separate\nsections  for  routine  and  development  expenditures.  The  development  expenditure  is  structured  into\nthe  same  standard  sectors  as  the  national  budget.  However,  the  structure  of  routine  expenditures\ndiffers  from  that  of  the  national  budget  in  that  there  is  no  analysis  by  sector.  Instead,  routine\nexpenditure  is  prepared  by  the  spending  agency  of  the  regional  governments,  and  is  classified  into\nfive categories: personnel, equipment, maintenance, official travel, and others.\n\n10. \nIn both the provinces and districts, the shares of current expenditure were about 60 percent of\nthe total expenditures. Current expenditures are mainly for personnel costs (49.1 percent in provinces\nand 70.2 percent in districts). There is little difference in the expenditure pattern of the development\nbudget at the provincial and district levels.\n\n\f43\n\nAppendix 5, page 1\n\nADB ASSISTANCE TO THE EDUCATION SECTOR\n\nTable A5.1:   Loans\n\nNumber\n\nTITLE\n\nDate of\nApproval\n\nAmount\n($ million)\n\nClosing\nDate\n\nA.

It will support two types of schools: (i) schools in disadvantaged areas serving a\nhigh proportion of children from poor families, and (ii) schools in relatively advantaged areas but\nserving poor communities and children.\n\n2.\nIt is estimated that 10-60 percent of primary and junior secondary schools in the target\ndistricts  will  be  eligible  for  SDF  support.  The  actual  proportion  and  the  number  of  beneficiary\nschools will vary depending on the degree of poverty in a given district. Poorer districts will have\nlarger  proportion  and  number  of  beneficiary  schools.      It  is  estimated  that  about  2,100  (54\npercent)  primary  and  junior  secondary  schools  in  Nusa  Tenggara  Barat  (NTB):    500,  (16\npercent) schools in Bali, and 400 or 8 percent of schools in DKI Jakarta will implement school\nimprovement activities through SDF.\n\n2. \n\nIdentifying and Selecting Eligible Schools Through Poverty Targeting\n\n3.\nSDF  will  be  provided  to  schools  registered  with  either  the  district  government  or  the\nMinistry of Religious Affairs that service poor communities and students. The Project will employ\na participatory process to select the SDF beneficiary schools. The district will rank subdistricts\nby  the  incidence  of  poverty  as  defined  by  the  Bureau  of  Statistics  (BPS).  Because  there\ncurrently is no information on the incidence of poverty below the district level, the Project  will\nfinance  subdistrict  and  village-level  socioeconomic  surveys,  to  be  conducted  as  an  extended\nactivity  of  the  BPS\u2019s  annual  socioeconomic  surveys  at  the  district  level.    This  will  be\nimplemented  to  capture  the  distribution  and  concentration  of  poverty  affected  communities\nwithin each district.  In ranking subdistricts, districts will also use information on the (i) proportion\nof families categorized under the National Family Planning Coordinating Board (BKKBN) welfare\nindicators, (ii) proportion of students from familiesin the lowest category (BKKBN data), (iii)  per-\nstudent  expenditure  at  the  school,  (iv)  commitment  to  school  based  management  (SBM),  and\n(v) subdistrict net enrollment and dropout rate data.\n\nEach subdistrict will then review and list the distribution of \u201celigible\u201d SDF schools, based\n4.\non  the  information  from  the  socioeconomic  surveys,  school  and  school  neighborhood\ncharacteristics,  and  local  knowledge  including  consultations  with  villages.  The  subdistrict  will\nprepare a list of eligible schools, and conduct participatory rapid assessments of eligible schools\nwith villages and communities. Then it will categorize the eligible schools into (i) poor schools in\npoor  neighborhoods,  (ii)  better  schools  in  poor  neighborhoods,  (iii)  poor  schools  in  rich\nneighborhood, and (iv) better schools in rich neighborhood but with poor children. This process\nwill be based on (i) the catchment community and student profile (parental income, occupation),\n(ii) conditions of school facilities compared with minimum service standards (including furniture\nand school sanitation), and (iii) interest in or commitment to SBM.\n\n\f46\n\nAppendix 6, page 2\n\n3. \n\nEligible Items for SDF support\n\n5.\nThe  SDF  will  broadly  support  items  aimed  at  improving  of  (i)  equity,  (ii)  minimum\nlearning  conditions,  and  (iii)  quality  (teaching-learning  process  and  learning  outcomes).\nExamples of eligible items  follow:\n\n(i) \n\nEquity\n\n(a)  Financial and other support to students from poor households\n\n(b)  Remedial/catch-up programs/tutoring for students who were absent to help\n\nfamilies (e.g., seasonal harvesting, fishing, etc.)\n\n(c)  Alternative programs for children who are unable to regularly attend classes\n\n(i) \n\nMinimum learning conditions\n\n(a)  Repairs and rehabilitation of facilities that are dangerous to students\n\n(b)  Purchase of classroom and library furniture\n\n(c)  Basic water and sanitation facilities for schools\n\n(ii) \n\nQuality\n\n(a)  Textbooks and library books\n\n(b)  Teaching aids and classroom supplementary materials\n\n(c)  School and/or cluster based teacher development activities\n\n4. \n\nMechanisms for SDF Award\n\n6.\nSchool  Improvement  Plan  (SIP).  Once  the  local  government  determines  the  groups  of\nschools eligible for SDF, each eligible school and catchment communities will receive intensive\ncapacity  building/mentoring  on  (i)  SBM,  including  community-school  partnership  and  school\ncommittee  formation  or  consolidation  (if  the  school  already  has  a  school  committee);  and  (ii)\nfacilitated  self-assessment  of  school  effectiveness,  with  full  participation  of  communities,  and\npreparation  of  the  three-year  SIP.

The  imprest  account\nwill  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  the  Asian\nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Loan Disbursement Handbook and arrangements agreed upon by\nthe  Government  and  the  ADB  as  detailed  here.    The  deposit  for  the  imprest  account  will  not\nexceed $10.0 million.  The account will be used to direct the loan proceeds through two systems\nof  funds  channeling:  one  for  the  School  Development  Fund  (SDF)  and  another  for  the  District\nEducation  Development  Fund  (DEDF)  and  for  other  project  expenditures.    The  systems  are\nshown in Figures A12.1 and A12.2.\n\nA. \n\nSchool Development Fund (SDF)\n\n2.\nEligible  primary  schools  (Appendix  6)  will  prepare  and  send  school  improvement  plans\n(SIPs)  to  the  subdistrict  coordinating  committee  and  eligible  junior  secondary  schools  to  the\nDistrict Coordinating Committee (DCC). Each SIP will be for three years, with an annual rolling\nplan  budget.    Upon  approval  of  the  SIP,  the  schools  will  open  a  separate  bank  account  in  a\ndistrict/subdistrict branch of the selected bank1 to transfer SDF funds.  If this bank has no such\nbranches  near  the  school,  the  school  will  open  the  bank  account  at  the  closest  bank  in  its\nlocality.  Once the committees approve the school proposals, the DCC issues a decree signed\nby  the  chairperson  DCC.    The  decree  will  contain  the  list  of  schools,  their  bank  account\ninformation, and amount of funds to in transferred from the BI to each school for the first year.\nThe first year budget represents tranche one, i.e., the approved planned expenses for the first\nyear of the schools\u2019 activities.\n\n3.\nThe District Project Management and Monitoring Unit (DPMMU)  will send a copy of the\ndecree to Central Facilitation Unit (CFU)  and to the district branch of the selected bank.  Based\non the decree, CFU will send the payment request to Ministry of Finance (MOF) to request for\ntransfer  of  funds,  and  MOF  will  issue  a  payment  order  to  BI  to  transfer  the  SDF  funds  to  the\ncentral branch of the selected bank.  Upon receiving the funds, the central branch through an\n\u201cinformation  note\u201d  informs  its  district  branch  of  the  availability  of  funds.    Immediately  following\nthis advice, the district branch bank will transfer the SDF funds for the first tranche directly to the\nbank accounts of schools.\n\nThe schools will submit to the DPMMU quarterly financial and annual program reports.\n4.\nBased on these reports, the second year plan of activities and budget may be revised.  Upon\nsatisfactory review of financial and program reports by DPMMU and DCC, the second tranche\nfor  the  second  year  budget  will  be  released  from  BI  to  the  school  bank  accounts  in  the  same\nmanner as in the first year.  The same review and approval of reports will be necessary for the\nrelease of the third and last tranches of SDF.\n\n5.\nWithin three months of each funds transfer from BI to the school bank account, DPMMU\nwill  prepare  the  statement  of  expenditures  (SOE)  summarizing  the  SDF  funds  provided  to  the\nschools of the entire district by category, i.e., for school improvement and facilities improvement.\n\n                  \n\n1 The bank will be a state-owned commercial bank, which will be selected by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) for the\ntransfer of SDF funds.  MOF will discuss and negotiate with 2-3 such banks for the best terms and conditions this\ntask.  The bank should agree to transfer funds without charging transfer fees, to transfer the funds as directed by\nthe DCC decree in the most efficient and timely manner;  and the transactions are subject to  independent audit of\nthe  Project  expenditures.    MOF  will  issue  a  decree  to  give  the  details  of  the  agreement  on  the  tasks  to  be\nperformed by the selected bank.\n\n\f59\n\n  Appendix 12, page 2\n\nDPMMU  will  use  the  bank  statements  from  the  bank  district  branch,  attach  these  to  the  SOE,\nand submit these to CFU. MOF will send a copy of the payment order, BI statement, and bank\nstatement  of  the  commercial  bank  central  branch  to  CFU.    CFU  will  prepare  the  withdrawal\napplications  based  on  district  SOEs,  attach  the  relevant  BI  statement,  payment  order  and\ncommercial  bank\u2019s  statements,  and  submit  them  to  MOF  for  endorsement  and  submission  to\nADB for replenishment of the imprest account held at BI.  The transfers from the district branch\nof  the  commercial  bank  to  schools\u2019  bank  accounts  according  to  the  approved  SDF  budget\ntranche will serve as the basis for SOE.\n\nThe  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  with  appropriate  evidence  that  the  Government  is\n6.\nalso  disbursing  counterpart  funds  for  the  parallel  activities  during  ADB\u2019s  review  missions.  The\nappropriate  evidence  will  be  based  on  the  payment  orders  of  Government  expenditures  for\nproject activities financed from the central Government and regional budgets.\n\nB.\n\nDistrict Education Development Fund (DEDF)\n\n7.\nThe DPMMU in each district will submit a five-year plan as well as an annual rolling plan\nand budget to the DCC/school board.  After DCC\u2019s review and endorsement, the DEDF plan will\nbe submitted to the Central Technical Committee (CTC) for approval, and CTC will inform CFU\nof the approval.  Based on this approval, CFU will inform the paying office of MOF in the district\nand DPMMU of the amount to be transferred.  DPMMU will then send a payment request to the\npaying  office  in  the  district  to  transfer  the  funds  from  BI  to  DPMMU  project  bank  account,\nthrough  a  payment  order.    This  amount  will  represent  the  planned  expenses  for  the  first  six\nmonths program of activities of DEDF (first tranche).\n\n8.\nDPMMU  will  submit  a  quarterly  financial  report  and  an  annual  program  report  to  CFU.\nThe second tranche for the second six months activities will be released from the BI to DPMMU\nproject  bank  account  in  the  same  way  through  the  paying  office  in  the  district  office  at  the\nrequest  of  DPMMU,  following  satisfactory  review  of  the  first  quarterly  financial  report  by  CFU.\nThe second and subsequent years\u2019 release of funds from the BI to DPMMU will depend upon a\nsatisfactory review of both the financial and program reports.  Revisions and adjustments may\nalso be made to the second and subsequent years\u2019 plan and budget.\n\n9.\nWithin one month of each funds\u2019 transfer from BI to DPMMU, DPMMU will obtain a copy\nof  the  payment  order  from  the  paying  office  in  the  district  and  send  it  to  CFU,  and  MOF  will\nprovide a copy of the BI statement to CFU.  CFU will prepare the withdrawal applications and\nattach the relevant BI statement and payment order, and submit them to MOF for endorsement\nand  submission  to  ADB  for  replenishment  of  the  imprest  account  at  BI.    The  transfers  from\ndistrict  paying  office  from  BI  to  the  DPMMU  bank  account  according  to  the  approved  DEDF\nbudget tranche will serve as the basis for SOE.\n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 13, page 1\n\nA.\n\nPoverty in the Project Area\n\nPOVERTY AND SOCIAL ASSESSMENT\n\n1.\nThe  incidence  of  poverty  in  the  project  area  varies  considerably  from  4  percent  in  DKI\nJakarta  to  33  percent  in  Nusa  Tenggara  Barat  (NTB).  While  DKI  Jakarta  has  a  fairly  low\npercentage of population below the poverty line, its Gini coefficient (indicating the gap in income\nbetween  the  rich  and  the  poor)  is  the  highest  in  the  country.  This  suggests  that  other  poverty\nindicators for DKI Jakarta, particularly those based on population \u201caverages\u201d, do not necessarily\nreflect the reality of poverty in Jakarta. During the economic crisis, DKI Jakarta had one of the\nlargest reductions in primary and junior secondary school enrollment.1 Bali is among Indonesia\u2019s\nmore developed provinces. The human development index places Bali 8th of the country\u2019s 30\nprovinces.    However,  the  province  has  many  communities  that  can  be  classified  as  remote  or\nisolated  and  there  are  emerging  signs  of  an  increase  in  poverty.    Poverty  is  evident  in\nagricultural and fishing villages, particularly around seaports in the northern part of the province.\nNTB is among the poorest and least developed provinces in Indonesia. As ranked by the human\ndevelopment  index  NTB  is  26th  of  30  provinces.  NTB  has  the  characteristics  of  traditional\npoverty, i.e.,  tenant agriculture or fishery-based and subsistence economy, where poor families\nlack cash-generating employment.\n\n2.\nIndonesia  has  been  relatively  successful  in  providing  access  to  primary  education  in\neven  the  most  remote  villages.  There  is  only  a  3  percent  difference  in  net  enrollment  rates  in\nprimary school between households in the lowest and highest expenditure quintiles. Enrollment\nfrom  poor  households  at  junior  secondary  level  is  significantly  below  that  of  children  from\nwealthier  households.    There  is  a  35  percent  difference  in  enrollment  of  children  between\nhouseholds in the lowest and highest quintiles.  This difference is caused by a number of factors\nincluding the quality of the primary school experience and the significantly higher cost of a junior\nsecondary education due to the need for transportation, uniforms, books, and fees, and physical\naccess to junior secondary schools  in remote areas.\n\nB.\n\nPoverty Targeting\n\n3.\nPoverty  targeting  will  be  implemented  through  a  two-step  process  based  on  area\ntargeting and local knowledge about the schools and their clientele.  Allocation to districts has\nbeen  done  based  on  the  incidence  and  depth  of  poverty.    Districts  with  a  relatively  high\nconcentration of the poor will receive a high level and proportion of the school development fund\nas well as district education development fund.  Districts with a lower concentration of poverty\nwill receive DEDF using appropriate criteria to target individual poor students.\n\nFor  allocation  purposes  at  the  subdistricts,    ranking  according  to  welfare  indicators  will\n4. \nbe  used  to  identify  areas  with  a  high  concentration  of  the  poor.  Primary  and  junior  secondary\nschools  will  be  targeted  by  different  criteria  to  take  into  account  local  variables  such  as\napplication-to- enrollment ratios  (a favored or better-off school will have a high application-to-\nenrollment  ratio),  low  average  scores  on  final  State  Exams  (NEM),  physical  condition  of  the\nschool, dropout rates, and local knowledge based on feedback from the surveys.\n\nC.  Project Benefits and Impact on Poverty\n\n1.  Project Beneficiaries\n\n5. \nThe principal target groups are primary (age 7-12 years) and junior secondary (age 13-\n15 years) school-age children  from low-income households (two lowest income quintiles) in 21\n\n1  The British Council.  The Impact of Scholarships and Grants Program.  Jones, Hagul, and Damayanti. May 2000.\n\n                  \n\n\f61\n\nAppendix 13, page 2\n\ndistricts  in  DKI  Jakarta,  Bali  and  NTB.  The  Project  is  estimated  to  benefit  about  1,256,097\nchildren:  243,580  or  about  13.0  percent  of  the  school-age  children  in  DKI  Jakarta,  about\n156,971  or  25.0  percent  of  school-age  children  in  Bali,  and  about  855,549  children  or  75.0\npercent  of  the  school  aged  children  in  NTB.  By  targeting  poor  children  through  the  use  of\npoverty  indicators,  the  Project  will  benefit  approximately  871,766  primary  school  children  and\n161,972  junior  secondary  school  children  from  families  below  the  poverty  line.    Table  A13\nshows  that  approximately  72.25  percent  of  student  beneficiaries  are  from  families  below  the\npoverty line.\n\nThe Project is estimated to benefit 3,209 primary and junior secondary schools, of which\n6. \napproximately 64 percent will be in NTB.  The Project will improve the schools\u2019 ability to deliver\nbasic education, improved education quality, and services tailored to the needs of low-income\nand poor families.  Such families will be identified through direct parent-school communication\nto  remove  constraints  to  the  educational  achievements  of  the  children.  Furthermore,  about\n31,000 teachers and 3,209 school principals will benefit from the Project through improvement\nof  (i)  teacher  effectiveness  (mastery  of  subject  and  teaching  methodologies);  (ii)  school\nleadership/management;  and  (iii)  policies,  procedures,  and  standards,  including  teacher\nassignment/management  policies,  budget/resource  allocation,  curriculum,  and \nlearning\nassessment tools.\n\n2.  Expected Social and Poverty Reduction Impacts\n\n7.\nBy  improving  poor  children\u2019s  access  to  quality  basic  education,  the  Project  will  help\nimprove beneficiary children\u2019s opportunities for further education. Employment and hence better\nearnings  will  help  break  perpetuating  intergeneration  poverty.  Recent  studies  in  Indonesia2\nrevealed  that  in  the  16-60  years  age  group,  those  who  completed  primary  school  earn  38.4\npercent more than those who did not. Assuming that each of the six grades of primary school\nyields  the  same  increment  to  earnings,  this  implies  that  earnings  increase  by  5.6  percent  for\neach grade at the primary level. Completion of junior secondary education yields an additional\nearning  increment  of  34.4  percent,  or  10.4  percent  for  each  of  the  three  years.    Senior\nsecondary education yields another 59.8 percent increase in earnings, or 16.9 percent for each\nof  the  three  years.    The  average  5.6  percent  annual  private  return  per  additional  year  of\nschooling at the primary level and 16.9 percent at the secondary level provide a strong private\nincentive  for  households,  particularly  poor  families,  to  send  their  children  to  primary  and\nsecondary schools.\n\n8.\nBenefits  go  beyond  the  increased  income-earning  capacity.    Education  and  basic\nschooling, in particular, can generate improvements in the quality of life of the population. While\nIndonesia has achieved almost universal participation at the primary school level, the quality of\neducation has a direct impact on the students\u2019 ability to make the transition and complete junior\nsecondary education.  Hence, to complete nine years of education, it is crucial to improve the\nquality  of  primary  education.    In  addition,  participation  in  junior  secondary  education  yields\nadditional  benefits  beyond  the  labor  market  and  results  in  improved  outcomes  in  a  number  of\nimportant  socioeconomic  indicators.    For  example,  women  who  have  some  secondary\neducation  have  a  significantly  lower  total  fertility  rate    than  women  who  have  only    primary\neducation.
