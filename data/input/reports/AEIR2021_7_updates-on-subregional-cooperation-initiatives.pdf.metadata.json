Generally, they all seek greater cooperation \nand economic integration in transport and trade, access \nto global value chains, markets, and tourism, along with \neconomic corridor and shared resource development. \nThe key is connectivity and easing border crossings for \nboth people and cargo.\n\nNothing is more anathema to this than a highly \ninfectious viral pandemic. The coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) led to lockdowns, border closings, and strict \nlimits on people\u2019s mobility. Yet, for many subregional \ninitiatives, the crisis brought officials together to share \ninformation on the pandemic response, to determine \nhow to safely reopen borders, trade, and tourism,  \namong others.\n\nThis chapter examines three well-established initiatives \nand how they have progressed over the past year. \nAnd it describes two areas where cooperation offers \nheightened benefits in a post-pandemic \u201cnew normal,\u201d \nwhether pooling resources to provide vaccines or in \naccelerating adaptation to digital technology.  \nThe discussions highlight contributions of the  \n\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) in promoting \nsubregional cooperation through inclusive, sustainable \ncross-border development. \n\nCentral and West asia:  \nCentral asia regional Economic \nCooperation Program65\n\nThe CAREC Program includes Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, \nGeorgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, \nPakistan, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nTajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The CAREC \n2030 strategy aims to create an open and inclusive \nregional cooperation platform to help connect people, \npolicies, and projects for shared and sustainable \ndevelopment.66 Building on 20 years of progress in \ntransport, energy, and trade connectivity (Table 7.1), \nCAREC is expanding cooperation into new areas\u2014\nincluding economic and financial stability, agriculture \nand water, and human development. The evolving \nCOVID-19 pandemic poses significant challenges to the \nregion. CAREC members more than ever need to work in \nunison to restore economic activity and renew progress \ntoward the prosperity and the well-being of their citizens.\n\n65  Contributed by Saad Abdullah Paracha, CAREC unit head, Central and West Asia Department (CWRD), Asian Development Bank (ADB); Xinglan Hu, \n\nprincipal regional cooperation specialist, CWRD; and Ronaldo Oblepias, CAREC consultant, CWRD, ADB.\n\n66  The CAREC 2030 Strategy focuses on five operational clusters: (i) economic and financial stability; (ii) trade, tourism, and economic corridors;  \n\n(iii) infrastructure and economic connectivity; (iv) agriculture and water; and (v) human development.\n\n160\n\n\fUpdates on subregional Cooperation initiatives\n\n161\n\ntable 7\ufffd1: selected economic indicators, 2019\u2014CaReC\n\nPopulation\n(million)\n\nnominal gdP \n($ billion)\n\ngdP growth \n(2015 to 2019, \naverage, %)\n\ngdP per Capita    \n(current  \nprices, $)\n\ntrade openness \n(total trade,\n% of GDP)\n\nChina, People\u2019s Republic of\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfghanistan\n\nAzerbaijan\n\nGeorgia\n\nKazakhstan\n\nKyrgyz Republic\n\nMongolia\n\nPakistan\n\nTajikistan\n\nTurkmenistan\n\nUzbekistan\n\nCaReC\n\n38.0\n\n10.0\n\n1,433.8\n\n4.0\n\n18.6\n\n6.4\n\n3.2\n\n216.6\n\n9.3\n\n5.9\n\n33.0\n\n19.6\n\n47.3\n\n14,140.2\n\n17.7\n\n179.3\n\n8.5\n\n13.6\n\n282.5\n\n8.1\n\n44.4\n\n57.9\n\n2.4 \n\n0.4\n\n6.7\n\n4.4\n\n2.9\n\n4.2\n\n4.2\n\n4.5\n\n7.0\n\n6.3\n\n5.8\n\n6\ufffd6\n\n514\n\n4,706\n\n9,862\n\n4,439\n\n9,667\n\n1,319\n\n4,229\n\n1,305\n\n870\n\n7,465\n\n1,756\n\n8,331\n\nCAREC = Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation, GDP = gross domestic product.\n\nNotes: CAREC\u2019s average GDP growth rate is weighted using nominal GDP.

Since \nthe pandemic began, CAREC members have actively\u2014\nand jointly\u2014responded to the crisis. They report new \ncases daily, share experience in fighting COVID-19, \nand provide medical teams and relief equipment to \nthose in need (such as from the PRC and Kazakhstan to \nother members). Central Asian leaders communicate \nproactively with each other to share pandemic \ninformation and discuss joint actions to keep borders \nopen for the free flow of food, medical equipment, and \nhumanitarian aid. CAREC countries are also working \ntogether to keep international railway freight traffic \noperating within and across the region following strict \ndisinfection measures. \n\nADB has stepped up its budget support and emergency \nassistance through its Countercyclical Support Facility\u2014\nspecifically its COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option \n(CPRO)\u2014to help CAREC countries mitigate the health, \nsocial, and economic impacts of the pandemic. As of 31 \nDecember 2020, a total of $3.16 billion emergency and \nCPRO assistance in loans  and grants were committed \nby ADB to support CAREC countries in response to \nCOVID-19 (Table 7.2). \n\nImplementation of CAREC 2030 continues \namid COVID-19.\n\nCOVID-19 has significantly affected implementation \nof CAREC 2030 across all five operational clusters, \nresulting in the cancellation and/or delay of planned \nmeetings and project-related field activities including \nCAREC\u2019s 20th anniversary celebration. Despite the \nchallenges and difficulties, progress continues with \nsupport from CAREC countries and development \npartners, with most programs and activities  \nundertaken virtually.\n\neconomic and Financial stability\ufffd Activities under \nthis cluster continue to promote policy dialogue among \nCAREC countries to strengthen information sharing \non economic and financial challenges facing the region \nand discuss policy options. On 28 October 2020, a \nCAREC High-Level Virtual Panel on Countercyclical \nFiscal Measures for Recovery was jointly organized \nwith the International Monetary Fund and the World \nBank. The panel discussed fiscal policy measures for \neconomic recovery for the CAREC countries in response \nto the COVID-19 pandemic. A CAREC High-Level \nPolicy Dialogue on COVID-19 and Financial Stability \nImplications was held on 14 December 2020, which \n\n\fUpdates on subregional Cooperation initiatives\n\n163\n\ndiscussed challenges to the economies and financial \nsystems caused by the pandemic in CAREC countries  \nand coordinated solutions at regional and global levels \nwith regional cooperation platform playing a significant \nrole.  CAREC is continuing implementation of the \nregional technical assistance (TA) on \u201cDeveloping a \nDisaster Risk Transfer Facility in the CAREC Region,\u201d \nwhich aims at building countries\u2019 physical and financial \nresilience to infectious disease outbreaks, such as \nCOVID-19, and natural hazards.\n\ntrade, tourism, and economic Corridors\ufffd The Regional \nTrade Group and Customs Cooperation Committee \nmet virtually in September 2020 and highlighted the \nimportance of keeping trade open and maintaining the \nmomentum of regional cooperation under the CAREC \nIntegrated Trade Agenda (CITA) 2030 (ADB 2018a). \nAzerbaijan and Uzbekistan have renewed negotiations \nfor World Trade Organization (WTO) accession, \nwhile Turkmenistan gained observer status. Regional \nImprovement of Border Services projects in Mongolia, \nthe Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan continue to upgrade \ntheir border crossing points, and Tajikistan launched its \nnational single window system. Uzbekistan acceded to \nthe International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) as \npart of its reforms to improve phytosanitary measures and \nbecame the first CAREC country to implement IPPC\u2019s \ne-Phyto system. As part of post-pandemic economic \nrecovery, CAREC countries welcomed the initiatives on \nexpanding services trade and developing e-commerce \nfollowing the recommendations of completed studies and \nseries of webinars in May to September 2020. Capacity-\nbuilding activities were organized at various levels such as \nthe forum between CAREC and South Asia Subregional \nEconomic Cooperation customs agencies in October \n2019, tailor-made training for Kazakhstan\u2019s hosting of the \nWTO\u2019s 12th Ministerial Conference, and the food safety \npilot project for Turkmenistan was launched in November \n2019. A $1.2 million ADB TA was approved in August \n2020 to strengthen knowledge and capacities for the \ndesign and implementation of free trade agreements  \nin CAREC.\n\nA $2 million ADB TA to support the formulation of  \nCAREC Tourism Strategy 2030 has made substantial \nprogress. Several milestone activities were undertaken to \npromote tourism development in CAREC and prepare a \n\nCAREC tourism strategy leading to 2030. These include \n(i) a high-level dialogue on \u201cPromoting Sustainable \nTourism Development in the CAREC Region through \nPublic\u2013Private Partnerships\u201d held during the 18th  \nCAREC Ministerial Conference in November 2019;  \n(ii) an inception workshop of the CAREC tourism expert \ngroup held in December 2019, which discussed the vision, \nobjectives, and components of the strategy; and  \n(iii) consultations with the CAREC countries held virtually \nin August\u2013September 2020. The CAREC Tourism \nStrategy 2030, accompanied by a regional tourism \ninvestment framework 2021\u20132025, aims to promote \nsustainable, safe, and more inclusive tourism development \nin the CAREC region to support countries\u2019 socioeconomic \nrecovery, help restore jobs and livelihoods, and achieve \nsustainable growth going forward.\n\nThe pilot Almaty\u2013Bishkek Economic Corridor (ABEC) \nmade good progress. The ABEC Tourism Master Plan \nwas adopted to guide tourism development, and a \nbusiness plan for a regional tourism skilling center has \nbeen completed. The governments of Kazakhstan \nand the Kyrgyz Republic agreed to work together to \nimprove border crossing points (BCPs), develop a \nmodern agricultural wholesale market network, and \ndevelop joint health laboratories in the next 2\u20133 \nyears. An ABEC video and website was launched in \nNovember 2019 for better dissemination of ABEC. An \nadditional $750,000 cofinancing was mobilized by \nADB to continue supporting ABEC. The road map for \nthe Shymkent\u2013Tashkent\u2013Khujand Economic Corridor \n(STKEC) development among Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, \nand Tajikistan has been finalized and published. ADB has \nmobilized $1 million additional financing to support the \nimplementation of the STKEC road map. ADB is  \nalso implementing a TA project to support the \nGovernment of Pakistan on economic corridor planning \nto reap expanded regional cooperation and  \nintegration benefits. \n\ninfrastructure and economic Connectivity\ufffd  \nThe CAREC Transport Sector Strategy 2030 is being \nimplemented with ADB TA support including training \nand workshops for CAREC countries on key transport \nissues such as the railway sector assessment, road \nasset management systems, and performance-based \ncontracting. Progress also continues in other transport \n\n\f164\n\nasian Economic integration report 2021\n\nsubsectors including the conduct of several key studies: \n(i) a scoping study on CAREC ports and logistics has been \ncompleted which identified opportunities and challenges \nin port and logistics cooperation; (ii) railway assessments \nfor all CAREC countries are being conducted, which \nanalyze key railway aspects and contribute to the \ndevelopment of potential CAREC railway projects; and \n(iii) a study of the COVID-19 impact on CAREC aviation \nwhich examined global trends, market recovery strategies, \ntechnological changes, and possible applications in \nCAREC countries has been completed. There were \nalso increased consultations with CAREC countries to \neffectively implement cross-border transport agreements, \nimprove corridor performance measuring and monitoring, \nstrengthen road safety, road asset management, and \ncross-border trade facilitation. \n\nThe CAREC Energy Strategy 2030 is being implemented \nthrough a $2.5 million in new ADB TA to support \n(i) the establishment of a new regional transmission \ncooperation association, (ii) promote market reforms, \n(iii) establish a financing vehicle for green energy \nprojects, and (iv) develop a CAREC energy outlook and \na women-in-energy program. CAREC\u2019s large regional \nenergy and infrastructure projects have been on track \nincluding the flagship Turkmenistan\u2013Uzbekistan\u2013\nTajikistan\u2013Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan Power Interconnection \nFramework and Central Asia\u2013South Asia Electricity \nTransmission and Trade Project. The Uzbekistan\u2013\nAfghanistan 500-kilovolt Power System Interconnection \nProject agreement\u2014under the Afghanistan Energy \nSupply Improvement Investment Program\u2014was signed \non 20 October 2020, which will help strengthen \nthe sustainability of Afghanistan\u2019s power sector, and \npromote cross-border trade in energy.\u00a0Also, the first \nphase of the Turkmenistan\u2013Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan\u2013India \nNatural Gas Pipeline project is planned to be launched \nin 2021. A regional flagship TA project for five Central \nAsian countries, which determined the financial savings \nthrough regional cooperation in integrating large volumes \nof renewable energy into the grid, was successfully \ncompleted in June 2020.\n\nTo mitigate the infrastructure gap in the CAREC \nregion and jumpstart regional projects, the CAREC \nSecretariat is embarking on developing a CAREC \n\nRegional Infrastructure Projects Enabling Facility. A TA \nproject has been approved to help prepare the concept \nfor examining its scope, eligibility criteria, structure, \ngovernance, and financing instruments and modalities; \nand identifying a potential project pipeline that could be \nsupported by such a facility. The facility will ultimately \nsupport CAREC governments in preparation of regional \nprojects and readiness, initial design, and application \nof appropriate financial solutions while promoting \nknowledge exchange and capacity development. This \nvehicle is expected to become an important tool in \nenhancing private sector participation and expanding \nproject financing using innovative approaches. \n\nagriculture and Water\ufffd Progress has been made \nunder this new cluster, with two new TA programs \nlaunched in 2020. The first TA supports international \nfood safety standards in agricultural value chains, \nwhich aims to improve public health and agro-food \ntrade facilitation in CAREC countries through enabling \nregulatory environment reforms, enhancing laboratory \ninfrastructure and capacity, strengthening capacity in \nthe value chain, and advancing network linkages and \npeer-to-peer institutional cooperation. The second TA \nsupports the development of the CAREC water pillar, \nthrough analysis of economic aspects and sustainable \nfinancing of water resource management including \ncross-border water resource management through \nregional cooperation, with a focus on climate change and \ndisaster risk management. \n\nhuman development\ufffd Activities in the health sector \nwere initiated, with a scoping study on CAREC health \ncooperation completed after a regional consultation \nworkshop held virtually on 15 October 2020. The study \nproposes measures for regional health cooperation \ngoing forward, including (i) strengthening regional \nhealth security, (ii) supporting national health systems \nthrough regional cooperation, and (iii) improving health \nservices for migrants, mobile populations, and border \ncommunities. To jumpstart the implementation of \nrecommendations, a TA project has been approved \nthat will help CAREC countries address public health \nthreats, including from COVID-19, as well as support \nthe formulation of a CAREC health strategy leading to \n2030. A scoping study on strengthening cross-border \n\n\fUpdates on subregional Cooperation initiatives\n\n165\n\ncommunity collaboration in the CAREC region assessed \nhow CAREC can promote closer economic and social \ncooperation and people-to-people contacts among \nborder communities, and proposed directions and \nopportunities for scaling up cross-border community \ndevelopment initiatives in the region. To implement \nrecommendations from an education scoping study in \n2019, ADB is mobilizing financing for a regional TA to \nsupport CAREC higher education and technical and \nvocational education and training.  \n\nThe CaReC 2030 Results Framework has been \ndeveloped which includes concrete indicators, baseline \ndata, data sources, and output levels that will ensure \nregular monitoring and evaluation of CAREC 2030 \nStrategy\u2019s goals and objectives. \n\nProspects\n\nNew CAREC gender and tourism strategies \nwill promote inclusive development to \nmitigate the COVID-19 impact.  \n\nIn the CAREC region, quarantines and mobility \nrestrictions have greatly weakened economic activity. \nDomestic demand and production plummeted, plunging \nglobal economic activity slashed external demand, \namid a collapse in global commodity prices. As a result, \ngross domestic product (GDP) growth in the CAREC \nregion (excluding the PRC) is forecast to contract by \n1.1% in 2020.  Hardest hit are small and medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs) in tourism, hospitality, education, and \nother services. In addition to existing gender disparities, \nthe pandemic has also had a disproportionate effect on \nwomen due to increased unpaid care work and intensified \nhome-based violence from lockdown measures; and \nacute vulnerabilities due to insecure labor markets and \ninformal economy where women often work.\n\nWith trade, transport, and energy strategies being \nimplemented, CAREC is advancing into areas that \npromote human development\u2014particularly those \nsupporting increased women\u2019s capacity to have equal \naccess to economic opportunities in the region, and \nthrough regional tourism development. The CAREC \n\nGender Strategy 2030 was formulated to reduce gender \ndisparities and to promote gender equality in the \nregion. The strategy promotes gender mainstreaming \nacross all five clusters of CAREC 2030 through \nfour strategic pillars: (i) promote women\u2019s access to \neconomic activities; (ii) contribute to women\u2019s social \nempowerment; (iii) support women\u2019s regional networks \nand policy reform for women\u2019s empowerment; and \n(iv) enhance women\u2019s access to information and \ncommunication technology (ICT). Virtual consultations \non the CAREC gender strategy were held with CAREC \ncountries in September-October 2020. The CAREC \nTourism Strategy 2030 adopts a holistic approach to \npromote safe and sustainable tourism destinations \nin the region through five pillars: (i) connectivity and \ninfrastructure, (ii) quality and standards, (iii) skills \ndevelopment, (iv) marketing and branding, and  \n(v) market intelligence. The strategy also mainstreams \nsix crosscutting themes including health, safety and \nsecurity, digitalization, gender equality, environmental \nsustainability, private sector participation, and universal \naccess to tourism services.  Both new strategies were \nendorsed at the 19th CAREC Ministerial Conference \nheld virtually on 7 December 2020.  \n\nPolicy Challenges\n\nCAREC needs to revive growth while \ncontaining and mitigating the impact  \nof the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nAmid COVID-19 pandemic, prospects are uncertain with \nno significant relaxation on restrictions across the region. \nIt is critical that CAREC countries maintain the right \npolicy balance between restoring economic activities \nand protecting public health. Regional cooperation \ncan help keep the hardest-hit sectors (such as trade, \ntourism, and health) functioning, while preparing for a \nfull recovery during post-pandemic time.\n\nIn these challenging and uncertain times, maintaining \ntrade flow is essential to save lives and livelihoods. \nCAREC countries can work together to reduce \nrestrictions on trading medical equipment, food, \nand other products that help save lives and ensure \n\n\f166\n\nasian Economic integration report 2021\n\nfood security. Gradually easing restrictions offers \nopportunities for countries to reopen borders and \nrestore travel and tourism by initially creating tourism \n\u201cbubbles.\u201d CAREC members can jointly develop a \nharmonized set of health and safety protocols for travel \nand tourism, through multisector collaboration among \nairlines, hotels, and other tourism services. The CAREC \nTourism Strategy 2030 provides a timely platform to \nhelp reboot tourism in the region.\n\nEnsuring a safe and healthy environment is a \nprecondition for restoring economic activity across all \nsectors. Thus, cooperation on health issues is critical \nfor mitigating public health risks as countries gradually \nreopen. The CAREC health scoping study calls for \nstrengthening health cooperation to fight public health \nthreats (such as COVID-19), secure regional health \nsecurity, and build resilient health systems for the \nfuture. CAREC countries can step up regional health \ncooperation to provide a solid basis for economic \nrevival through mitigating COVID-19 impacts and other \nregional health threats. \n\nsoutheast asia: greater Mekong \nsubregion Program67\n\nCambodia, the PRC (Yunnan Province and Guangxi \nZhuang Autonomous Region), the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR), Myanmar, Thailand, and \nViet Nam comprise the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). \nADB houses the GMS Program secretariat. In its 28 years \nof cooperation, the GMS has created an interconnected \nsubregion that continues to improve economic growth \namid enhanced connectivity and competitiveness. From \nthe program\u2019s launch in 1992 to 2020, 107 investment \nprojects amounting to $26.6 billion have been approved. \nOf this, ADB contributed $12.2 billion, GMS governments \n$6 billion, and other development partners/private \nsector $8.3 billion. These projects have built, upgraded, \nor improved over 11,000 kilometers (km) of roads and \n\nover 500 km of railways; installed over 2,600 km of power \ntransmission and distribution lines; and added almost \n3,000 megawatts (MW) of power generation to bring \nelectricity to almost 150,000 households.\n\nOverview \n\nGMS economies are expected to contract \namid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe GMS Program supports subregional projects in \nagriculture, energy, the environment, health, tourism, \ntransport connectivity, transport and trade facilitation, \nand urban development. In 2019 and prior to the \n2020 pandemic, the subregion\u2019s aggregate growth \nrate rose from 6% (2014\u20132018) to 6.2% (2015\u20132019), \nled by strong growth in Cambodia; Viet Nam; and \nYunnan Province, PRC. Thailand\u2019s growth continued \nto improve from a low of 1% in 2014. However, with \nthe COVID-19 pandemic, the GMS economies are \nexpected to contract, in particular tourism-driven \nsegments in Thailand and Cambodia. ADB has \nprovided countercyclical budget support to Cambodia, \nMyanmar, and Thailand. In addition to responding \nto the COVID-19 pandemic, GMS countries are \nworking together on subregional health cooperation, \nstrengthening various aspects of regional health security \nand border areas.\n\nPrior to the pandemic, regional interconnectedness \nhad been strengthening continuously, particularly \nin intraregional trade and tourism. By 2019, \nintraregional trade had grown to $552 billion, or 10% \nof the subregion\u2019s total trade (up from 5.7% in 2009). \nHowever, excluding the PRC, intraregional trade for \nGMS countries was only 1.5% of the total, underscoring \nthe critical importance of the PRC to intraregional \ntrade growth. Trade with GMS partners was particularly \nsignificant for Cambodia (43% of total trade), the \nLao PDR (88%), and Myanmar (50%). While trade \nremains a significant driver of growth across most of \n\n67  Contributed by the GMS Secretariat, Southeast Asia Department, ADB.\n\n\fUpdates on subregional Cooperation initiatives\n\n167\n\nthe subregion\u2014as shown by the high degree of trade \nopenness (trade as a percentage of GDP)\u2014trade\u2019s share \nof GDP is dropping slightly. However, foreign direct \ninvestment (FDI) is beginning to contribute more to \nGDP, with its percentage of GDP increasing slightly \nacross much of the GMS, especially in Cambodia and \nViet Nam (Table 7.3). In addition, the subregion is \nbecoming increasingly interconnected through tourism. \nBy 2018, intra-GMS tourism accounted for nearly 23% \nof overall GMS tourism.\n\nPerformance and Progress  \nover the Past Year  \n\nA long-term strategic framework to 2030 is \nbeing developed for the GMS Program.\n\nIn 2019, the GMS Program continued to implement the \nHa Noi Action Plan (2018\u20132022)\u2014endorsed by GMS \nleaders in March 2018\u2014which outlines the strategic \ndirections and operational priorities for subregional \nintegration. The plan operates under the Regional \n\nInvestment Framework 2022 (RIF 2022), a medium-\nterm pipeline of priority GMS projects supported by \nnational governments, the private sector, development \npartners, and ADB. The RIF 2022: Third Progress Report \nand Update for 2020\u2014endorsed by GMS ministers in \nNovember 2020\u2014described progress made on 210 \ninvestment and TA projects, with a pipeline valued at \n$78.3 billion. By November 2020, 71% of the pipeline \nprojects had identified financing, with 16% of projects \ncompleted, 42% ongoing, and 42% of projects  \nyet to start. \n\nUnder the direction from the GMS leaders and in \nresponse to the evolving global environment, work began \nin early 2019 and continued through the COVID-19 \npandemic on a new long-term strategic framework for \nthe GMS Program up to 2030. The secretariat is leading \nthis work, with inputs from GMS members, development \npartners, the private sector, and subregional think tanks. \nThe GMS Strategic Framework 2030 will be considered \nby GMS ministers at the 24th GMS Ministerial Meeting, \nand then by GMS leaders at the 7th GMS Leaders\u2019 \nSummit in March 2021. \n\ntable 7\ufffd3: selected economic indicators, 2019\u2014greater Mekong subregion\n\nnominal \ngdP \n($ billion)\n\ngdP growth \n(2015 to 2019, \naverage, %)  \nand trend\n\ngdP per Capita    \n(current prices, $)\n\ntrade openness \n(total trade,\n% of GDP)\n\n% Change in \nFdi (2015  \nto 2019)a\n\nFdi openness \n(total FDI \nInflows,\n% of GDP)a\n\n47.9\n\n13.7\n\n\u00a0\n\nCambodia\n\nGuangxi Zhuang Autonomous \nRegion, PRC\n\nYunnan Province, PRC\n\nLao PDR\n\nMyanmar\n\nThailand\n\nViet Nam\n\ngMs\n\n27\n\n308\n\n337\n\n19\n\n66\n\n544\n\n262\n\n1,562\n\n7.1 \n\n7.1 \n\n8.8 \n\n6.5 \n\n6.4 \n\n3.4 \n\n6.8 \n\n6\ufffd1 \n\n1,621\n\n6,210\n\n6,933\n\n2,668\n\n1,221\n\n7,807\n\n2,715\n\n4,568\n\n141\n\n22\n\n10\n\n69\n\n54\n\n84\n\n198\n\n75\n\n\u201364.9\n\n0.0\n\n41.1\n\n\u201330.1\n\n118.1\n\n27.9\n\n28\ufffd7\n\n0.1\n\n0.3\n\n6.9\n\n3.5\n\n1.1\n\n6.2\n\n2\ufffd0\n\nFDI = foreign direct investment, GDP = gross domestic product, GMS = Greater Mekong Subregion, Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, PRC = People\u2019s \nRepublic of China.\n\nNotes: Average GDP growth rate for GMS is weighted using nominal GDP.

The study results were presented at \nthe 11th Economic Corridors Forum in October 2020.\n\nThe GMS Program\u2019s performance has further \nstrengthened the competitiveness, connectivity, and \ncommunity within the GMS itself and, increasingly, \ncreates new links to other subregions.\n\nThe GMS Subregional Transport Forum has also been \nfocusing more on the softer but important aspects of \ntransport development, and initiated studies on road \nasset management and road safety, for example.\n\nCross-border transport Connectivity and economic \nCorridor development\ufffd Further strengthening regional \nconnectivity infrastructure continued to be a priority. An \nextensive medium-term pipeline of transport projects \nare in various stages of development under RIF 2022. \nAccording to the RIF 2022 2nd Progress Report and \nUpdate, transport projects had an estimated value of \n$77 billion, or 83% of the RIF pipeline total. Several of \nthese were recently completed\u2014such as the Road and \nBorder Crossing Infrastructure at Mae Sot\u2013Myawaddy, \nlinking Myanmar and Thailand; the Coastal Terminal \nDevelopment Project of Laem Chabang Port in Thailand; \nand the Bus and Truck Drivers Training and Testing \nCenter in Cambodia. \n\nWith the shift to multimodal transport under the GMS \nTransport Sector Strategy 2030, the Greater Mekong \nRailway Association (GMRA) continued to work on \nthe feasibility and investment requirements of nine \npriority GMS railway links. The GMRA is also working \non a Framework Agreement on Cross-Border Railway \nTransport Connectivity that covers the software side of \nrailway connectivity in the subregion. A new ADB TA will \nsupport the strengthening of the GMRA; prepare a plan \nto develop a modern GMS railway network; update the \nGMS railway strategy; and update and refine rail demand \nprojections. Some GMS countries (Viet Nam) are also \npreparing logistics studies and development plans \nalong with projects that establish logistics complexes \n(Cambodia) that support transport efficiency.\n\nA study was completed identifying ways to cooperate \nand transform a key sub-corridor of the North\u2013South \nEconomic Corridor between the PRC and Myanmar\u2014\nNSEC-5 (Kunming\u2013Muse\u2013Mandalay\u2013Yangon\u2013\nThilawa)\u2014into a full-fledged economic corridor that \nincreases investment, employment, and incomes \nwithin and around the sub-corridor in an inclusive and \n\ntransport and trade Facilitation\ufffd In 2019, and prior \nto the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak, cross-border trade \nand transport facilitation under the Early Harvest \nimplementation of the GMS Cross-Border Transport \nFacilitation Agreement were progressing well. Officials \nwere trained, transport operators briefed, administrative \ncirculars distributed, GMS transport permits and \ntemporary admission documents (TADs) issued, and \nnational registers compiled and exchanged with other \nmembers. Supporting documents such as permits, TADs, \ntraining and outreach materials, and implementation \nguides were prepared and published online. In 2019, the \nJoint Committee of the GMS Cross-Border Transport \nFacilitation Agreement agreed to extend cooperation in \nseveral key areas to continue advancing the transport \nfacilitation agenda. These include (i) expanding the \npermitted cross-border route network and border \ncrossing points; (ii) circulating and sharing national \nregisters of permits and TADs; (iii) regularly monitoring \ncross-border trade agreement implementation;  \n(iv) sharing transport and trade facilitation data;  \n(v) developing country handbooks that identify key \nhost-county traffic rules and specifying permissible \nroutes and places for passenger (dis)embarkation and \ncargo (un)loading; and (vi) facilitating foreign operators\u2019 \naccess to national customs transit systems.\n\nTo ease increased barriers to transport and trade \ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic, GMS countries \ncontinued to coordinate and exchange information \non the status of border crossing points and the new \nmeasures applied in respective countries. The National \nTransportation Facilitation Committee\u2014which leads \nthe implementation of the GMS Cross-Border Transport \nFacilitation Agreement\u2014met on 22 June 2020 to help \nGMS countries better coordinate and cooperate to \nensure the safe movement of goods and passengers \nacross GMS borders. Some of the agreed immediate \n\n\fUpdates on subregional Cooperation initiatives\n\n169\n\nto medium-term recovery measures include (i) an \ninformation platform to facilitate interagency and \ncross-border information exchange between officials; \n(ii) a portal to keep businesses and the public informed \non border crossing issues; and (iii) accelerating the \npublication of country handbooks agreed on in 2019, \nspecifying host county traffic rules (for example, \nmaximum permissible weights and dimensions, speed \nlimits, vehicle markings, and third party insurance \nproviders, among others), and specifying the permissible \nroutes and places for passenger (dis)embarkation and \ncargo (un)loading. \n\nenergy\ufffd Power trade has entered Stage 2 (country-to-\ncountry power trade) as cooperation remains a priority \nof the Regional Power Trade Coordination Committee \n(RPTCC). The working groups for (i) planning and \noperation (formerly, performance standards and grid \ncodes); and (ii) regulatory issues focus on enhancing and \ndeepening Stage 2 of GMS power trade. GMS members \ncontinue to work on power grid interconnection, \npower trade with neighboring countries, and the future \ndevelopment of the power sector. The Nam Ngiep 1 \nHydropower Project in the Lao PDR, funded by private \nsector investments, began operations in September 2019 \nwith an installed capacity of 272 MW\u2014with some sold \nto the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand as \nwell as to Electricit\u00e9 du Laos. Also in September 2019, \nthe Lao PDR, Malaysia, and Thailand agreed to expand \na trilateral power deal, under which the Lao PDR will \nsell electricity to Malaysia via Thailand\u2019s grid\u2014raising \ncapacity from 100 MW to 300 MW. Cambodia also \nsigned a power purchase agreement with the Lao PDR in \nSeptember 2019, with 195 MW of electricity transmitted \nto Cambodia beginning in January 2020.\n\nAs power trade continues to grow, revitalizing the \nRegional Power Coordination Center is crucial to \nmaximize the potential for future GMS power trade. \nWork needs to accelerate for the regional body to \ncoordinate the application of grid codes, performance \nstandards, and regional regulatory functions.\n\ntourism\ufffd In 2019, GMS recorded nearly 80 million \ninternational tourist arrivals. They contributed $101 \nbillion in tourism receipts (15.9% of the economy) \nand sustained over 18 million jobs in the subregion. \nTourism contributed significant shares to the national \neconomies of Thailand (20% of GDP), Cambodia (12% \nof GDP), Viet Nam (12%), and the Lao PDR (9%). \nOverland intraregional tourism arrivals reached 83% of \ntotal arrivals in the Lao PDR, 59% in Myanmar, 31% in \nCambodia, and 14% of arrivals in Thailand. Following \nthe spread of COVID-19 and the subsequent ban on \ninternational arrivals and restrictions on domestic \nmovement, tourism fell significantly in the first quarter of \n2020 before stopping completely in the second quarter. \nIn the third quarter, economies began to promote \ndomestic tourism to support the sector. However, \nin Thailand and Cambodia where 71% and 77%, \nrespectively, of tourism spending in 2019 was  \nfrom international tourism,68 the tourism economy \ncontinues to struggle.\n\nDuring the initial COVID-19 response and mitigation \nphase, the Mekong Tourism Coordinating Office and \nthe Tourism Working Group website, https://www.\nmekongtourism.org/, served as an information platform \nand portal, connecting travelers with vital, rapidly \nchanging information. It also provided a resource for \ntourism operators on various government relief and \nsupport efforts. A clear source of information on the \nstatus and safety of travel will continue to be needed as \npublic confidence returns to resume travel. The Tourism \nWorking Group also works with destination management \norganizations and tourism suppliers to adapt and \nstrengthen electronic supply chains between producers \nand end users, and create social media and tourism \nmarketing initiatives to promote a return to tourism. \n\nurban and border area development\ufffd GMS countries \nhave increased their focus on urban development \ninvestments for planning smart and livable cities, and  \non urban development for riverine and coastal cities  \nand towns\u2014as these related to healthy regional  \noceans and waterways.\n\n68  World Travel and Tourism Council. https://wttc.org/ (accessed June 2020).\n\n\f170\n\nasian Economic integration report 2021\n\nThe GMS Urban Development Working Group discussed \nthe ADB Ocean Financing Initiative (under The \nAction Plan for Healthy Oceans and Sustainable Blue \nEconomies) as well as the ASEAN Smart City Initiative. \nSuggestions for possible projects in GMS countries to \nbe supported by ADB\u2019s urban sector investments or the \noceans action plan include solid waste management \nfor cities along the Mekong River and Irrawaddy basin; \nimproving transportation infrastructure links between \ntowns and regions; managing urban growth through \npublic\u2013private partnerships or by deploying new \ntechnologies; creating more integrated urban planning \nand solid waste and wastewater management; and \nintegrating coastal zone planning and coastal adaptation \nplanning to address rapid erosion issues and increase \nresilience of coastal cities. Under the ASEAN Smart \nCity Initiative, the Urban Development Working Group \nrecommended implementing smart city pilots in selected \ncities, with the first batch starting in 2020.\n\nHealthy Oceans and ASEAN Smart Cities components \nare expected to be incorporated into future GMS \nurban sector investments, including a Livable Cities \nInvestment Project in Cambodia in 2021, which will \nfocus on enhancing urban planning, building community \nresilience, and providing infrastructure to improve \nlivability in Cambodia\u2019s secondary cities such as \nBattambang, Bavet, Kampot, and Poipet. \n\nhealth and other human Resources development\ufffd \nThe GMS Health Cooperation Strategy 2019\u20132023 was \nendorsed by GMS countries in 2019 and is accompanied \nby a strategic results framework to monitor and evaluate \nits implementation and effectiveness. Furthermore, the \nGMS Health Cooperation Working Group is preparing \na regional action plan to operationalize the strategy and \nsupport its three pillars: (i) strengthening national health \nsystems to address transnational health threats and \nhealth security as a regional public good; (ii) respond  \nto the health challenges and health impacts as a  \nresult of connectivity and mobility; and (iii) health \nworkforce development. \n\nThe GMS Regional Health Security Project in Cambodia, \nthe Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam is progressing \nas it strengthens public health security mechanisms by \n\nimproving regional and cross-border communicable \ndisease control services; disease surveillance and \noutbreak response; hospital infection prevention and \ncontrol; and laboratory quality and biosafety. The \nregion is also preparing a GMS Healthy Border Special \nEconomic Zones Project for Cambodia, the Lao PDR, \nand Myanmar to strengthen health care for migrant \nworkers in border areas, develop knowledge partnerships \nbetween Thailand and its GMS neighbors, and develop \na regional communicable disease control center for \nregional monitoring and surveillance of outbreaks.\n\nOngoing GMS health projects and the Working Group \non Health Cooperation enabled the GMS Program to \nrespond immediately to COVID-19. As early as February \n2020, $2 million in additional financing was approved \nto support capacity for epidemic response\u2014including \ninvestigation, surveillance, prevention, and control\u2014by \nadding funds to the ongoing technical assistance project, \nStrengthening Regional Health Cooperation in the \nGMS. In the same month, the Working Group on Health \nCooperation convened a virtual meeting to explore \nareas of national and regional financial and technical \nsupport. So far, as a result of these early actions, nearly \n$60 million has been mobilized through GMS Health \nCooperation in Cambodia, the Lao PDR, Myanmar, and \nViet Nam. The support includes additional financing of \n$20 million in the Lao PDR and $30 million in Myanmar \nunder the GMS Health Security Project; and ongoing \nproject funds direct for procuring $860,000 for thermal \nscanners, personnel protective equipment, real-time \npolymerase chain reaction machines, and infrared \nthermometers for the Lao PDR; $270,000 for thermal \nscanners for border screening in Cambodia; $6.6 million \nfor thermal scanners, personnel protective equipment, \nlaboratory equipment, and intensive care unit respiratory \nventilators in Myanmar; and $500,000 to support \nemergency response activities in Viet Nam provinces. \n\nAs part of the continuing support over the medium- \nand long-term, pipeline projects such as the GMS \nHealthy Border Special Economic Zones project are \nbeing adjusted to address COVID-19 needs as well as \nbuild pandemic resiliency. The technical assistance for \nStrengthening Regional Health Cooperation in the GMS \nis also funding \u201cOne Health\u201d assessments to strengthen \n\n\fUpdates on subregional Cooperation initiatives\n\n171\n\nprevention in areas where animal and human health \ninterconnect, such as healthy livestock. \n\nagriculture\ufffd Regional technical assistance on the \nGMS Sustainable Agriculture and Food Security \nProgram (2020\u20132025) was approved in December \n2019 to support the Strategy for Promoting Safe and \nEnvironment-Friendly Agro-Based Value Chains and \nSiem Reap Action Plan for 2018\u20132022. The program \nfocuses on (i) green agribusiness supply chains and \nagribusiness financing; (ii) crop and livestock safety \nand quality; and (iii) climate-adaptive agriculture in the \ncontext of the water\u2013food\u2013energy nexus.\n\nThe GMS Climate-Friendly Agribusiness Value Chains \nSector Project is underway in Cambodia, the Lao PDR, \nand Myanmar to harmonize safety and quality standards \nfor agricultural products and strengthen institutional \nand technical capacity for safety and quality testing. The \nproject will also support rural livelihoods and job creation \nthrough rehabilitating and upgrading infrastructure, all \ninstrumental in post-COVID-19 recovery efforts. The \nGMS Cross-Border Livestock Health and Value Chains \nImprovement Project is being prepared to help Cambodia, \nthe Lao PDR, and Myanmar better prepare for and \nprevent future outbreaks of transboundary animal disease, \nzoonoses, and antimicrobial resistance, as well as improve \nlivestock value chains and COVID-19 responses.\n\nFurther, discussions on the COVID-19 response are \nunderway, including (i) GMS response and recovery \nefforts in agriculture and food security, (ii) digital \ntechnologies for greening pandemic-responsive \nagribusiness supply chains, and (iii) livestock health \nmanagement.\n\nenvironment\ufffd A regional technical assistance on the \nGMS Climate Change and Environmental Sustainability \nProgram was approved in December 2019 to help \nimplement the GMS Core Environment Program \nStrategic Framework for 2018\u20132022. The program will \nfocus on (i) climate and disaster resilience, and low \n\ncarbon transitions; (ii) climate-smart landscapes and \nenvironmental sustainability, including pollution control \nand waste management; and (iii) green technologies and \nclimate and disaster risk financing instruments.\n\nThere are ongoing discussions with GMS countries on  \n(i) COVID-19 response and recovery efforts and impacts \non environmental sustainability, (ii) opportunities \nfor making COVID-19 recovery efforts green and \nclimate-resilient, (iii) biodiversity conservation and \nwildlife management in the wake of COVID-19, and \n(iv)\u00a0sustainable waste management of COVID-19 \nrelated waste.\n\nA technical assistance program for Thailand, Climate \nChange Adaptation in Agriculture for Enhanced \nRecovery and Sustainability of Highlands, began in \nearly 2020, and aims to reduce vulnerability of highland \ncommunities and ecosystems to cope with climate \nchange impacts. The project will focus on (i)\u00a0assessing \nclimate change vulnerability of highland agriculture;  \n(ii) prioritizing gender-responsive, climate-smart \nagriculture practices; (iii) enhancing agricultural product \nquality, value addition, and market linkages; and  \n(iv) strengthening the capacity of local governments and \ncommunities to address climate change.\n\nProspects \n\nA GMS medium-term COVID-19 recovery \nplan is in the works.\n\nWhile GMS members have done well in containing the \nspread of COVID-19 both nationally and regionally, \neconomic growth has been disrupted and is expected \nto contract given the significant drop in demand for \ngoods and services worldwide and the cessation of \ninternational tourist arrivals across the GMS. More than \n8 million people have lost jobs with a further 8 million \npeople pushed below the poverty line.69 \n\n69  These estimates are made by ADB from March to June 2020 from various briefing materials and are indicative only. They do not include data from \n\nGuangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Yunnan Province. \n\n\f172\n\nasian Economic integration report 2021\n\nAlthough COVID-19 has drastically affected the \nGMS economy, it also highlighted the value of having \nestablished regional cooperation mechanisms to \nrespond quickly to emerging needs, like regional health \ncooperation and trade facilitation. Regional tourism \ncooperation also provides support to sustain tourism and \nfoster dialogue on effective mechanisms for reopening \nthe sector, first to domestic travel, then to regional or \nbubble tourism in the medium term, before returning \nto global travel and tourism. Other regional dialogues \non the environment and agriculture offer guidance \nand options on a \u201cgreen recovery,\u201d methods to sustain \nlivelihoods through regional agriculture value chains, and \nbuilding safe and resilient cross-border livestock trade. \n\nIn the medium term, these will be guided by the GMS \nCOVID-19 Response and Recovery Plan 2021\u20132023, \nto be presented to the GMS leaders for endorsement in \nMarch 2021. GMS members are now developing national \nmedium-term recovery plans (2021\u20132023) aimed at \nrebuilding their local economies, the regional economy, \nand their engagement in the global economy. The GMS \nis a unique association well-suited to collaborating \nwith other GMS members to address the regional \ncooperation and integration constraints on this medium-\nterm recovery plan.\n\nIn the long term, the GMS is working on developing a \nlong-term strategy to guide countries through 2030. \nGMS 2030 will be presented for GMS leader adoption at \nthe GMS Summit in early 2021. \n\nthe working groups on transport and trade facilitation, \ntourism, agriculture and health will need to work closely \nand coordinate activities. Cooperation and coordination \nacross countries will also be critical, particularly in areas \nwhere policies and regulations must harmonize with \nimmediate neighbors and the GMS more broadly. The \nGMS Secretariat and working group secretariats will be \ncoordination points when requested.\n\nEast asia: support for regional \nCooperation and integration \ninitiatives under the CarEC and \ngMs subregional Programs and \nknowledge-sharing activities70\n\nThe PRC and Mongolia are both active members of \nthe CAREC Program, and ADB, through its East Asia \nDepartment (EARD), are committed to supporting \nregional cooperation and expanding knowledge- and \nexperience-sharing opportunities within and across \nsubregional platforms. In particular, EARD leads the \nimplementation and monitoring of the CITA 2030 \nand its 3-year Rolling Strategic Action Plan for the \n11\u00a0CAREC members. EARD also facilitates and supports \nparticipation of the PRC in the GMS Program, with \nspecific focus on the North\u2013South Economic Corridor, \nand the Northern Economic Corridor connecting  \nthe PRC with the Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand,  \nand Viet\u00a0Nam.\n\nPolicy Challenge\n\nSubregional cooperation and coordination \nwill be critical in responding to COVID-19.\n\nCOVID-19 response plans require multisector \ncoordination to ensure economies and borders can \nreopen safely, that people\u2019s health and the environment \nare safeguarded, and that vulnerable communities are \nprotected and included in recovery efforts. In particular, \n\nOverview\n\nEast Asia embarked on coordinated investments in \nthe PRC and Mongolia to fully realize the potential \nbenefits of increased physical connectivity and policy \ncoordination between the two countries as part of \nbroader regional economic corridor development. \nAmong these are parallel projects to develop a cross-\nborder economic cooperation zone that will link \n\n70  Contributed by the Regional Cooperation and Integration (RCI) team of ADB\u2019s East Asia Department.\n\n\fUpdates on subregional Cooperation initiatives\n\n173\n\nthe Erenhot pilot zone in the PRC\u2019s Inner Mongolia \nAutonomous Region (IMAR) and Mongolia\u2019s Zamyn-\nUud free zone. These investments are part of a wider \nframework of regional cooperation and trade facilitation \nprojects traversing CAREC corridor 4B. \n\nEnhancing knowledge- and experience-sharing for \nregional cooperation remains a high priority for East Asia, \ninvolving collaboration with the CAREC Institute and \nunder the Regional Knowledge Sharing Initiative (RKSI), \namong others. Trade facilitation, upgrading sanitary and \nphytosanitary measures, and regional cooperation have \nbecome more important than ever for the PRC, Mongolia, \nand their trading partners\u2014not only to expand and diversify \ntrade but to ensure food safety and improve resilience to \nongoing and future transboundary health threats.\n\nPerformance and Progress  \nover the Past Year\n\nADB continues to support projects in \nMongolia and the PRC related to CAREC  \nand the GMS.\n\nIn June 2019, the PRC and Mongolia signed a bilateral \nagreement to develop an economic cooperation \nzone under the framework of their bilateral strategic \npartnership and regional cooperation initiatives. ADB \nsupport includes a $30 million concessional loan for \nMongolia\u2019s Developing the Economic Cooperation \nZone Project, which was approved in June 2020 \n(ADB 2020c).71 The project will develop the physical \ninfrastructure and operationalize the Zamyn-Uud free \nzone, promote sustainability, and support seamless \ntransit to and from the PRC\u2019s Erenhot zone in IMAR. \n\nThe Inner Mongolia Sustainable Cross-Border \nDevelopment Investment Program for the PRC\u2014a \n$420 million multitranche financing facility (approved in \nOctober 2020)\u2014will install smart ports with one-stop \ninspection systems to improve customs clearance between \nthe two zones and establish a regional cooperation \n\nmechanism for better coordination between the PRC and \nMongolia zones.72 Estimated at $196.3 million, tranche \n1 will also upgrade key infrastructure and services in \nborder areas; promote the use of high-level technology \nfor ecological restoration within the cooperation zone; \ncreate income-generating opportunities by establishing \ninclusive agricultural value chains and improving access to \nfinance for SMEs; and improve border infrastructure in the \nMandula port. \n\nADB also approved $27 million in additional financing \nfor Mongolia\u2019s Regional Improvement of Border Services \nProject in 2019 to upgrade border crossing points in \nBichigt, bordering the PRC in the east; and Borshoo, \nwhich borders the Russian Federation in the west \n(2019a). This will replicate the development initiatives of \nthe ongoing project, which is already upgrading facilities \nand equipment at the crossing points in Altanbulag and \nSukhbaatar, located in the northern part of Mongolia, \nand enhancing the Customs Automated Information \nSystem toward creating a single window. Construction \nworks start in 2020 to upgrade laboratories, quarantine \nand inspection facilities under Mongolia\u2019s $15 million \nRegional Upgrades of Sanitary and Phytosanitary \nMeasures for Trade Project, approved in 2016. \n\nThe PRC\u2019s Guangxi Regional Cooperation and Integration \nPromotion Investment Program Tranche 2\u2014approved in \n2018 for $180 million\u2014continued to strengthen SMEs, \ndevelop cross-border e-commerce platforms, and \nupgrade infrastructure and services for border economic \nzones (ADB 2018b). The Yunnan Lincang Border \nEconomic Cooperation Zone Development Project\u2014\napproved in 2018 for $250\u00a0million\u2014became effective \nin July 2019 and is making robust headway toward \nbuilding trade and logistics capacity, and developing \nborder zones. A new TA for policy research and capacity \nbuilding in the PRC\u2019s Yunnan and Guizhou provinces will \npromote sustainable trade and investment facilitation \nand economic linkages between the two provinces \nand the GMS, by integrating environment, social, and \ngovernance principles; and introducing innovations in \nmobilizing green finance.\n\n71 \n\n72 \n\nSee ADB.

Building on a regional workshop on \nenvironmental readiness for e-commerce (December 2018 \nin Shanghai, PRC), a technical study initiated by ADB and \nthe CAREC Institute in 2019 evaluated CAREC countries\u2019 \nlegislative and regulatory frameworks (CAREC Institute \n2020). In May 2020, a virtual workshop organized by \nADB, the CAREC Institute, ADB Institute, and the Asia-\nPacific Finance and Development Institute, explored policy \noptions and discussed examples from other countries in \ndeveloping e-commerce. In September 2020, a CAREC \nwebinar on e-commerce and paperless trade underscored \nthe need to align domestic legislations with international \nstandards and the role of cross-border connectivity and \nimproved customs services for e-commerce development. \nThe next phase of the research will focus on e-commerce \ninfrastructure\u2014including e-payments, logistics, and \ninformation and communication technology for business-\nto-business and business-to-consumer transactions. \nADB and the CAREC Institute are also jointly assessing \nphytosanitary certification systems in CAREC countries \nto determine the feasibility of an electronic certification \nsystem to support harmonization within the region and  \nwill deliver training modules for improving border services \nand capacity building on free trade agreements from  \n2020 to 2021. \n\nIn 2019, ADB and the CAREC Institute initiated a \n5-year collaborative partnership for implementation \nand dissemination of the CAREC corridor performance \nmeasurement and monitoring (CPMM) mechanism. It \nwill also design and deliver an enhanced set of CPMM \nproducts, including annual reports, midyear updates, \ncountry-specific analysis, and policy briefs. The \npartnership will leverage the CAREC Institute\u2019s growing \nnetwork of research and knowledge institutions to \nexpand the current CPMM methodology and outputs, \noptimize data collection and validation, and more \neffectively promote the use of CPMM data and  \nanalysis in policy-related decision-making and \nindependent research. \n\nSince 2012, the PRC\u2019s Ministry of Finance and ADB \nhave been jointly implementing the RKSI program to \nfacilitate exchange of development-related knowledge \namong ADB\u2019s developing members. RKSI and its partners \norganized, among others, the 14th ASEAN\u2013China Forum \non Social Development and Poverty Reduction; the 5th \nCAREC Think Tank Forum; the Special Economic Zones \nas Catalysts for Economic Corridors, Value Chains and \nProduction Networks Training for ASEAN and PRC \nOfficials; and the 2020 North-East Asia Development \nForum, which fostered analytical discussions on policies \nand practices of development cooperation, and identified \npotential areas of collaboration among northeast Asian \ncountries in global public goods, including health, disaster \npreparedness, and response. Despite the ongoing \npandemic, the RKSI program continued to deliver timely \nand relevant lecture and webinar series on international \ndevelopment and on the PRC\u2019s experience in COVID-19.  \n\nProspects\n\nADB supports cross-border investment in \nregional cooperation and integration (RCI).\n\nADB continues to support PRC investments in RCI \nthrough the preparation of tranche 2 ($118.4 million) \nof the Inner Mongolia Sustainable Cross-Border \nDevelopment Investment Program for approval in 2022, \nwhich will expand economic opportunities and better \nliving conditions along IMAR\u2013Mongolia border areas. \nTranche 2 will provide climate-resilient infrastructure \nand services, improve targeted ecological areas through \nforestation and desert restoration, as well as promote \ngreen SME business development services. \n\nFurthermore, the Guangxi RCI Promotion \nInvestment Program will prepare its third and final \ntranche\u2014$140\u00a0million for 2021 approval\u2014which \nanticipates expanding RCI benefits along border areas of \nthe Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and northern \nViet Nam. Subprojects are expected to develop cold-\nchain logistics systems, update industrial park facilities in \nthe border economic zone, and enhance road networks \nat border crossings. Tranche 3 will also explore and \ndevelop sustainable regional tourism opportunities.\n\n\fUpdates on subregional Cooperation initiatives\n\n175\n\nPolicy Challenges \n\nEnhancing resilience to transboundary  \nhealth risks will sustain economic growth  \nand promote integration with global  \nand regional economies. \n\nADB mobilized a comprehensive pandemic response, \nincluding $100 million in countercyclical budget support \nto Mongolia, support for the procurement of emergency \nmedical equipment, and technical assistance for the \nregion\u2019s pandemic response. \n\nThe unprecedented disruption caused by the COVID-19 \npandemic and increasing global trade tensions significantly \nreduced the subregion\u2019s exports during 2020\u20132021 and \nresulted in economic slowdown. Facilitating international \ntrade therefore remains crucial to the post-pandemic \neconomic recovery of the PRC and Mongolia. This will \nrequire policies that make cross-border movement of \ngoods and people safer and more efficient. Worldwide \ntravel restrictions, border closures, and stricter border \ncontrols have highlighted the importance of strengthening \nresilience against transboundary health risks and future \npandemics. Effective resilience will require cooperation and \ncollaboration among border agencies, such as customs, \ninspection, immigration, and health agencies under a  \n\u201cOne Health\u201d approach. Transparency, data-sharing, use of \ntechnology and stronger systems among these agencies can \nhelp coordinate risk management and improve traceability \nof people and goods crossing borders. \n\nGreater resilience will further enhance the region\u2019s \nparticipation in global agriculture value chains. The \nseamless movement of agricultural products (including \nanimal and meat products) will help diversify trade \nwhile at the same time ensure food security in the \nPRC, Mongolia, and beyond. Robust policies will help \ncountries intensify cooperation in modernizing sanitary \nand phytosanitary measures to address food safety, \ntransboundary plant pests and animal diseases, and \nrisks to human health. Compliance with international \ninstruments and initiatives\u2014such as those of the \n\nWTO, World Customs Organization, World Health \nOrganization, and the World Organisation for Animal \nHealth\u2014and creating synergies with regional initiatives \nsuch as the CAREC program and partnerships with \nneighboring countries will help achieve harmonized, \nresponsive, and relevant policy reform. \n\nADB\u2019s pipeline projects for approval in 2021 include a \n$200 million loan to strengthen health security for the \nPRC. It covers capacity building to enhance cross-border \ninformation-sharing for timely response to outbreaks \nand establish a regional platform for technical forums \nand continuing education. A proposed $30 million \nproject for Mongolia will strengthen integrated early \nwarning systems and disaster preparedness to facilitate \nregional pandemic monitoring and surveillance. These \nwill be complemented by technical assistance for \nknowledge-sharing on digital actions for sustainable \nand resilient food systems and managing the risk of food \ninsecurity during and after the COVID-19 crisis. \n\nsouth asia: south asia subregional \nEconomic Cooperation73\n\nThe ADB-supported South Asia Subregional Economic \nCooperation (SASEC) program had a landmark year in \n2019. Five RCI projects\u2014with cumulative ADB assistance \nof $1,205 million\u2014were committed during the year, \nsignificantly more than the three projects committed \nin 2018 with $350 million in ADB assistance. The 2019 \nSASEC projects included two transport connectivity \nprojects (in Nepal and Sri\u00a0Lanka) with $495\u00a0million \nin ADB financing to improve key international trade \ncorridors and improve freight logistics.

Fortunately, instead of \nresorting to isolationist pressures, the countries of South \nAsia have banded closer together using existing (and new) \nplatforms. A virtual South Asian Association for Regional \nCooperation (SAARC) Summit was held on 15 March 2020 \nto explore ways to jointly combat the disease, resulting in \nthe launch of a COVID-19 emergency fund, with an initial \ncontribution of $10 million from India. As of July 2020, it \nhas $21.6 million contributed by all SAARC members. The \nsummit was followed by virtual meetings of senior health \nprofessionals, trade officials, and health ministers in March \nand April, which considered various ways to collectively \ncombat the pandemic, including adopting a telemedicine \nframework, joint diagnostic and therapeutic research, and \napplying pragmatic solutions to promote trade.      \n\nSASEC members have also outlined their approach \nto economic revival and recovery post-pandemic. It \ncomprises stimulus packages and public investment to \npromote trade and expand credit, among other measures. \nIn the \u201cnew normal,\u201d public spending on transport, energy, \nand trade facilitation will continue as important SASEC \nareas, but may be affected by shifts in each member\u2019s \nnational economic strategy. Strengthening SASEC\u2019s \ncooperation mechanisms will revolve around addressing \nthese needs. Virtual SASEC platforms may be increasingly \nutilized to oversee projects and determine actions to \nadvance new priorities and initiatives. In transport and \ntrade facilitation, for instance, smart approaches (like \nautomation) and common protocols may be used to \nminimize disruptions in supply chains for essential goods \nand enhance the overall resiliency of trading systems. \n\npopulation sizes constrain purchasing power and \nimplementing capacity, and remote locations lead \nto higher transport costs. The project represents a \nsignificant step in safeguarding public health through \nregional action. It also promotes regional knowledge \ntransfer as the four countries will meet periodically and \nhave access to a pool of experts that will work across \ncountries and throughout the project duration. \n\nOverview\n\nA regional approach will be key to \nbroadening immunization coverage  \nin the Pacific.    \n\nGeographic remoteness and limited resources \nconstrain Pacific health systems to effectively deliver \ncomprehensive health services to the population. \nIndividually, these countries lack the purchasing \npower and capacity to procure adequate supplies of \ncritical vaccines for human papillomavirus (HPV), \npneumococcal conjugate (PCV), and rotavirus, as well \nas the equipment and training needed to store and \nadminister these properly.\n\nADB has approved a project to address this gap by \npooling procurement and capacity building to provide \nthese vaccines to four Pacific developing member \ncountries.

Outbreaks of dengue fever in the Marshall \nIslands and in countries affected by Tropical Cyclone \nHarold (Fiji, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Vanuatu), as well \nas risks from COVID-19, further highlight the need to \nbolster health-care systems that could easily become \noverwhelmed if preventive measures are not taken and \ndisease spreads unchecked. \n\nbarriers to adequate health-care coverage\ufffd  \nMany Pacific governments subsidize and deliver  \nhealth services; where services are not free, any user  \nfees charged are generally low relative to global \nbenchmarks (Figure 7.7). \n\nHowever, available facilities may be inadequate and \ndifficult to access; especially for patients who must \ntravel from remote outer islands to the nearest major \nurban center\u2014or even abroad\u2014to seek treatment. \n\nFigure 7.7: Composition of Domestic Health Expenditure \n(% of current expenditure, average for 2000\u20132017)\n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n2\n\n1\n0\n0\n2\n\n2\n0\n0\n2\n\n3\n0\n0\n2\n\n4\n0\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n0\n2\n\n6\n0\n0\n2\n\n7\n0\n0\n2\n\n8\n0\n0\n2\n\n9\n0\n0\n2\n\n0\n1\n0\n2\n\n1\n1\n0\n2\n\n2\n1\n0\n2\n\n3\n1\n0\n2\n\n4\n1\n0\n2\n\n5\n1\n0\n2\n\n6\n1\n0\n2\n\n7\n1\n0\n2\n\n8\n1\n0\n2\n\n9\n1\n0\n2\n\nBCG\n\nDTP3\n\nHepB3\n\nMCV1\n\nPol3\n\nNotes: This figure shows average coverage in ADB\u2019s Pacific developing member \ncountries.

Screening and treatment \nfor cervical cancer have been especially challenging \ndue to resource, logistical, and follow-up constraints. \nIn addition, many governments face shrinking fiscal \nresources. Development partners continue to provide \ncritical support in key areas of health care such as human \nresources, vaccines, and specialist services. \n\nMost national immunization programs in the Pacific \nprocure vaccines through the Vaccine Independence \nInitiative (VII) under the United Nations Children\u2019s \nFund. However, the VII has mainly focused on coverage \nfor traditional vaccines. New vaccines such as HPV, PCV, \nand rotavirus vaccines are much more expensive than \ntraditional ones, and small island Pacific countries lack \nthe individual purchasing power and capacity to procure \nand administer them. Among ADB\u2019s developing member \ncountries in the region, only four have introduced these \nvaccines: Fiji, and the three North Pacific countries (the \nFederated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and \nPalau) who receive grant support under their Compacts \nof Free Association with the United States (ADB 2018d). \nMost Pacific countries are ineligible for immunization \nfinancing mechanisms for low-income countries,  \nsuch as the subsidized prices offered by the Vaccine \nAlliance (ADB 2018d).\n\nFurther, significant investments are required to upgrade \ncold-chain equipment and supply-chain management \nfor the safe delivery, storage, and management of \nvaccine stocks, training of vaccinators and related \nhealth workers to administer and monitor at routine \nand outreach immunization, and strengthening risk \ncommunication on the benefits of immunization \nthrough community engagement and minimize vaccine \nhesitancy. The wide dispersal of islands within a Pacific \ncountry also adds significant costs and logistical \nchallenges to take these vaccines through \u201cthe last mile\u201d \nto remote communities.\n\nA Regional Approach to Strengthening \nHealth-Care Systems\n\nGiven these specific and severe constraints, a regional \nhealth support mechanism is essential. Pooled resources \nand collective action will make it easier to purchase \nsupplies and make the necessary investments to broaden \nvaccine coverage, as well as help Pacific countries build \nthe capacity to provide primary health care and channel \nlocal resources toward more sustainable, cost-effective \nmeasures. Pacific leaders recognize that cooperation \nand collective action is key to fighting cervical cancer, \nidentified as a regional development priority (ADB \n2018d; Pacific Islands Forum 2016).\n\nIn November 2018, ADB approved a Systems \nStrengthening for Effective Coverage of New Vaccines in \nthe Pacific Project. Over the next 5 years, it will support \npublic health in Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu in \nseveral ways:\n\n\u2022\t strengthen vaccine procurement in the region by \nfunding the purchase, through the VII, of the HPV, \nPCV, and rotavirus vaccines, and related cold-chain \nequipment and supplies. The project will work with \nat least 90% of health facilities in planning the rollout \nof these vaccines to selected priority communities, \nusing vaccine forecasting to ensure adequate supplies \nnationwide even in times of emergency. It will also build \nthe capacity of these facilities for more effective planning \nand procurement of health-related commodities.  \n\n\u2022\t strengthen local health systems by providing \n\nsupport to (i) update immunization and cold-chain \npolicies, guidelines, and training materials; (ii) train \nhealth workers to administer vaccines, as well as \nmanage supply chains and conduct preventive \nmaintenance, among others, to help ensure adequate \nvaccine stocks are available nationwide; (iii) build \nhealth staff capacity in evidence-based planning \nand bottom-up budgeting; (iv) report and integrate \nsex-disaggregated immunization data in the \nbroader health information system; and (v) conduct \nnationwide surveys on immunization coverage and \nother related matters to assess the quality and equity \nof vaccine management.\n\n\f182\n\nasian Economic integration report 2021\n\n\u2022\t improve community awareness about \n\nvaccinations by assisting ministries of health\u2014in \npartnership with other stakeholders such as civil \nsociety and church groups\u2014to heighten public \nawareness on the efficacy of vaccinations  \n(vaccine acceptance).\n\nToward More Responsive Health \nSystems in the Pacific \n\nThe project is in the early stages of implementation, but \nrepresents a significant step in safeguarding public health \nthrough regional action. Pooling procurement through \nthe VII will allow Pacific countries to benefit from \nestablishing a regional buffer stock of vaccines across \nSamoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu in case of health \nemergencies, such as an outbreak. These countries \nwill also benefit from bulk purchasing prices, quality \nproducts, and technical expertise toward broadening \nvaccine coverage, particularly those critically important \nto women and children under 5 years. \n\nFurther, the regional approach will help lower project \nimplementation costs while enhancing the efficiency, \nsustainability, and accessibility to immunization and \nprimary health services across multiple countries. \nImproving primary care over the course of the project \nshould help countries better respond to emergencies \nsuch as COVID-19. Engaging local stakeholders will also \nhelp spread important information on disease prevention \nand treatment, and promote better health-seeking \nbehavior in communities.\n\nThe project directors in the four beneficiary countries \nhave come together annually to discuss the project \ndesign features and implementation, and more regular \nmeetings are anticipated as the project activities are \nstepped up. Under the project, the four countries share \na pool of experts in health financing, gender, monitoring \nand evaluation, procurement, and public health. \nBesides providing project implementation support to \nthe individual ministries, these experts will also enable \nsharing of knowledge across countries throughout \nproject duration.\n\nUnlocking the Potential  \nof Digital Platform Economies\n\nDigital platforms can be strong catalysts for economic \nvalue, as they significantly lower the cost of acquiring \nand using information, thereby lowering transaction and \nproduction costs. They are seen as an important means \nfor stronger growth, and their ability to minimize human \nphysical contact makes them a valuable tool in ensuring \nmarkets continue working during a pandemic.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, ICT plays an \nincreasingly critical role in keeping people and services \nconnected despite the unprecedented lockdowns and \nvirtual suspension of social and economic activities. \nIt allows activities to go online (such as schooling, \nshopping, virtual meetings, and socializing) and could \nmake the option of \u201cworking and learning from home\u201d \nstandard. Digital technology also helps countries \nrespond to the pandemic more effectively by enabling \ne-medicine (online consultations and diagnostics) \nand e-tracing (patients and their contacts) along with \nother services (such as hospital automation). Social \nand business videochat applications and collaborative \nplatforms are proving increasingly indispensable during \nthe pandemic, and will likely become essential venues \nin a post-pandemic era. For example, ICT drives \ne-commerce, which boosts efficiency, enhances market \naccess for businesses and consumers, and generates \nsubstantial spillover effects.  \n\nA Digital Future for Central Asia\n\nCAREC countries are pursuing national digital strategies \nand modernizing infrastructure to boost international \nand local connectivity. Network coverage is wide with \ncosts lower than the world average. Although internet \nuse varies widely, e-commerce is gaining momentum \nthrough international digital platforms. \n\nCAREC 2030 promotes integration of ICT use across \nall CAREC operational clusters to raise the quality and \n\n\fUpdates on subregional Cooperation initiatives\n\n183\n\nefficiency of public services and support private sector \ngrowth. CAREC members, despite uneven levels of \nintegrated ICT solutions, are on average sufficiently \nprepared to increasingly use improved ICT to mitigate \nthe COVID-19 impact and promote national and regional \neconomic recovery. Challenges remain, however, including \noutmoded laws on e-transactions and customs rules, \npreference for cash payments, insufficient e-banking \nservices, and inadequate delivery systems. CAREC \ncountries still need to bridge the digital divide, to fully \nharness ICT potential in the region. ICT investment \nand knowledge services are needed to address the key \nchallenges of inadequate internet connectivity and limited \naccess to the latest technologies, and a shortage of support \nprograms to promote digital technology initiatives. \n\nADB is providing a $1 million TA to help CAREC \ncountries apply digital technologies with strengthened \nICT capacities; and better prepare for a new normal\u2014\ncontinuously containing the COVID-19 virus while \nsupporting economic revival. The TA supports the  \ndigital transformation and start-up ecosystem \ndevelopment in the region. \n\n\u2022\t Digital\ttransformation\tof\tthe\tCAREC\tProgram\twill\tbe\t\nsupported through (i) assessing current integration \nof digital technologies and ICT in member countries \nand through CAREC clusters, and (ii) developing \na CAREC Digital Strategy 2030. New digital \nmechanisms, tools, and needed equipment will be \nprovided to facilitate virtual dialogue and enable \nremote collaboration and information exchange \namong CAREC countries. Virtual training activities, \nworkshops, and seminars will be used to strengthen \nthe required skill set to effectively apply ICT.  \nThese efforts will feed into the development of the \nCAREC Digital Strategy 2030 setting out a vision  \nand a plan toward 2030.\n\n\u2022\t The\tstart-up\tecosystem\twill\tbe\tsupported\tthrough\t\nknowledge-sharing and capacity-building activities. \nA regional platform will be established to harness \ninnovative ideas and digital solutions by encouraging \nparticipation in collaborative projects that address \n\nthe problems posed by the pandemic. Strengthening \npartnerships between private and public initiatives \nincluding government officials, financial institutions, \nstart-ups, incubators, accelerators, and universities, \nand increasing access to global centers of innovation \nand start-up excellence\u2014particularly from Japan, \nMalaysia, the PRC, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, \nEuropean countries, the United Arab Emirates, and \nthe United States\u2014will accelerate knowledge transfer.\n\nBanking on ICT for GMS Trade \nFacilitation and Border Opening\n\nAs intraregional trade and overland tourism\u2014as well \nas intraregional labor migration\u2014continue to be major \ndrivers of the GMS economy, the use of digital platforms \n(such as e-customs clearance and digital contracting \ntechnology) will offer a safe way for GMS countries to \nreopen their land borders. Due to the virus outbreak, \ntravel restrictions, border closures, and mobility \nrestrictions will increase trade costs for industries linked \nto global supply chains by 1%\u20132% (Park et al. 2020). \nDigital platforms can help mitigate these increased \ncosts. For example, in trade facilitation, ADB has been \nsupporting a feasibility study in Cambodia to assess \nthe use of an ICT-based cargo tracking system that \nallows automated surveillance systems to monitor cargo \nmovement. This cargo tracking system\u2014along with \nan information platform that allows interagency and \ncross-border information exchange between officials \nand electronic customs clearance\u2014can ease the trade of \ngoods across the subregion.\n\nSimilarly, as the COVID-19 infection rate remains \nlow and well contained across the subregion, GMS \ncountries could use a digital contact tracking and tracing \nplatform to allow the freer movement of people across \nGMS borders. With 23% of GMS tourism arrivals from \nintraregional tourism, and overland arrivals reaching as \nhigh as 83% of total tourism in the Lao PDR and 59% \nin Myanmar, GMS economies could benefit greatly by \nsafely opening land border crossings. \n\n\f184\n\nasian Economic integration report 2021\n\nThe E-Readiness of East Asia\n\nOf the world\u2019s 70 largest digital platforms, the \nPRC accounts for 22% (by market capitalization). \nThey include companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, \nJD.com, and Baidu. Government policy, private sector \nparticipation, and a large ICT manufacturing base \nhave created the world\u2019s largest telecommunications \nand e-commerce market\u2014and one of the most \nadvanced intelligent connectivity systems. Although \nnot at the same stage as the PRC, Mongolia also has \na liberalized and competitive telecommunications \nmarket, a developed backbone network, and is improving \nconnectivity with the PRC. Businesses use existing \nplatforms and cloud-hosted software and data services \nto cater to more than 65% of online shoppers (Delger \net al. 2020). The PRC and Mongolia are advancing \ntheir efforts in enhancing their regulatory frameworks \non e-commerce. The PRC has enacted its Electronic \nSignature Law and E-Commerce Law in 2019 and is \na signatory to the United Nations (UN) Framework \nAgreement on Facilitation of Cross-Border Paperless \nTrade in Asia and the Pacific. Meanwhile, the Parliament \nof Mongolia has on 15\u00a0May 2020 passed the legislation \nto accede to the UN Convention on the Use of \nElectronic Communications in International Contracts.\n\nSASEC Program to Harness  \nBenefits and Address Challenges  \nof Digital Platforms \n\nE-commerce is expected to become a key driver of \ngrowth in South Asia, potentially enhancing competition \nand productivity, and encouraging production and export \ndiversification (World Bank 2020). Its online trade \npotential can help integrate the region into international \nvalue chains and strengthen commercial linkages \nbetween countries. However, while e-commerce has \ngrown, it pales relative to other regions. Online sales,  \nas a proportion of total retail sales, is below 2% in India \nand Bangladesh, compared with 15% in the PRC and  \n14% globally. \n\nSouth Asia, with a large proportion of young people \nhighly receptive to digital technology, could greatly \nexpand e-commerce.77 SASEC countries face many \nbarriers to e-commerce, including poor logistics \nand trade processes, restrictive digital regulations \nand inadequate ICT infrastructure. Cross-country \ncoordination to lower these barriers is being addressed \nunder SASEC\u2019s trade facilitation platform. Its efforts to \nautomate and streamline border trade processes will  \ngo a long way to enhance digital service platforms.  \nThe SASEC platform can also help synchronize \ngovernment efforts to address related issues such as \ndigital inclusion, cybersecurity, copyright violations, and \ntax capture, among others. \n\n77  The World Bank (2020) noted that removing regulatory and logistical challenges to e-commerce would increase SME exports, employment, and \n\nproductivity by as much as 20%\u201330%.\n\n\fUpdates on subregional Cooperation initiatives\n\n185\n\nreferences\n\nAleksanyan, L. and W.
