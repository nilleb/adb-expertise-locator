THE ONGOING PROJECT \n \n1.  On 30 April 2020, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a loan of $100 million \nfrom concessional ordinary capital resources (COL) for the COVID-19 Response Emergency \nAssistance Project.1 The loan was signed on 13 May 2020, became effective on 16 May 2020, \nand will close on 31 October 2023. The project will support the government\u2019s efforts under its \nNational Preparedness and Response Plan to contain, mitigate, and manage the coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19).2 The ongoing project supports procurement of equipment and supplies, \nupgrading of health and testing facilities, and building system and community capacities for \nsurveillance, prevention, and response to COVID-19. The Directorate General of Health Services \n(DGH) under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) is the implementing agency of \nthe project. As of 30 November 2020, no contract has been awarded, and $10 million has been \ndisbursed from the advance account. The project is rated for attention due to procurement delay. \n \n2.  The ongoing project is aligned with the following impact: Accelerated social and economic \nrecovery of COVID-19 affected population in Bangladesh (footnote 2). The project will have the \nfollowing outcome: health and well-being of COVID-19 affected persons improved. The outcome \nwill be achieved through three outputs: (i) immediate and medium-term equipment needs for \ntesting and managing COVID-19 met; (ii) infrastructure and related equipment for supporting and \nsustaining prevention and management of COVID-19 delivered; and (iii) health system and \ncommunity capacities in combatting COVID-19 strengthened.  \n \n3.  Under output 1, the project will help meet the government\u2019s immediate and medium-term \nneeds to prevent the spread of COVID-19, by supporting emergency procurement and provision \nof the most crucial medical equipment and supplies. These will help treat and protect affected \npeople and healthcare workers from infection, and equip selected health facilities with essential \ninfection prevention and control supplies. Output 2 will support modification and rehabilitation of \ninfrastructure which includes providing screening facilities at air, land, and sea ports of entries; \nequipping medical college hospitals with critical care units and isolation units to reduce  secondary \ninfections; and strengthening microbiological diagnostic facilities\u2019 capability to apply real-time and \nadvanced diagnostics. Output 3 will support measures to strengthen health system\u2019s response \ncapacities and implement short- and medium-term capacity development, such as incentives to \nfrontline health workers, operational research on COVID-19, and COVID-19 risk communication \nstrategy and plan. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n4.  The COVID-19 outbreak, declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) \non 11 March 2020, has spread rapidly across the globe, with severe impact on lives and \neconomies. In Bangladesh, the first case was reported on 8 March 2020. Cases have risen steeply \nwith 464,932 confirmed cases and 6,644 deaths as of 30 November 2020.3 The country is now in \na fourth stage of infection (community transmission).  \n \n \n1  The approved Report and Recommendation of the President of the project is in Appendix 2. \n2  Government of Bangladesh, MOHFW. 2020. National Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19 Bangladesh. \nVersion 5. 18 March 2020. Dhaka. \n3  Coronavirus COVID-19 Dashboard, 2020. Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare \n(MOHFW).  http://103.247.238.81/webportal/pages/covid19.php (accessed on 30 November 2020).  \n ", "2 \n5.  High population density,4 rapid urbanization, a large population of migrant workers, and \nmore  than  20%  of  its  urban  population  living  in  slums  without  adequate  sanitation,  made \nBangladesh vulnerable to infectious disease outbreaks. The pandemic has led to significant \nnegative impact on the economy with gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate projected to \ndecline to 5.2% in FY2020 from 8.2% in FY2019.5 ADB estimates indicate that job losses could \nbe as high as 3.7 million; many informal workers (85.1% of the workforce) 6 lost their livelihoods \ninstantly after the nationwide lockdown. With 20.5% of the population under the poverty line, and \n10.5% living in extreme poverty (FY2019),7 Bangladesh is especially vulnerable to economic \nshocks. Any economic shock would push a significant proportion of the near poor under the \npoverty line and deepen the poverty of those already poor, reversing previous gains made in \npoverty reduction. It is, therefore, crucial to support Bangladesh\u2019s efforts to mitigate the impact \nand flatten the curve for COVID-19 as well as strengthen health system\u2019s capacity in the medium- \nto long-term to deal with such health emergencies in the future. \n \n6.  The health sector is in the front line of the battle against health emergencies, both in its \nrole as provider of health services to the public and as victims in terms of the high toll the COVID-\n19  has  already  taken  on  health  sector  workers.  However,  according  to  WHO\u2019s  scale  of \nInternational Health Regulations core capacities, Bangladesh has limited capacity to prevent, \ndetect, and respond to public health emergencies.8 Overall, the health system is underdeveloped \nand underfunded, with only 9.9 doctors, nurses and midwives9 and 8.8 hospital beds per 10,000 \npeople.10 Current health expenditure is only 2.3% of gross domestic product, while out-of-pocket \nexpenditure accounts for over two-thirds of health spending, making healthcare unaffordable to \nmany.11 Business process of procurement of drugs and equipment, and inventory and warehouse \nmanagement is inefficient. Key categories of need include: (i) the capacity of the health sector to \nassess and monitor the COVID-19 pandemic (and other emerging diseases); (ii) the capacity of \nthe health sector to handle and cure suspected and probable COVID-19 patients (health facilities, \nmedical  and  laboratory  equipment,  and  supplies);  (iii)  the  needs  of  health  personnel  for \ninformation, protection, and training; (iv) information, education, and communication campaigns \nfor health professionals and the public on COVID-19 and other future health emergencies; and (v) \nhygienic disinfection and appropriate sanitary measures to prevent spread of diseases.12 \n \n7.  The proposed technical assistance (TA) will provide capacity building and implementation \nsupport to expedite the implementation of the ongoing project, develop automated medicines and \nequipment procurement and logistics management system, establish effective monitoring and \nevaluation system. The TA will also support medium to long term efforts to build health system \ncapacity to respond quickly and flexibly to prevent and contain future emergencies, and provide \ntechnical support for planning and developing future ADB-assisted investment projects to help \n \n4  Bangladesh has 1,253 people per square kilometer of land area, among the highest density in the world.

Given the emergency nature of the project, and the overburdened government resources \nto respond to the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, the government needs consulting services to \nsupport the implementation of the ongoing emergency assistance project to achieve intended \nresults in a smooth and timely manner.  As loan proceeds will be used to maximize immediate \nsupport to procure medical equipment and supplies, and rehabilitate infrastructure for critical care \nunits and isolation units, allocation for consulting services needs to be augmented through the \nTA.  In addition, the TA will finance strengthening the health system and community capacities \n(output 3 of ongoing project). The TA will also respond to additional needs identified by the \ngovernment to further strengthen the health system\u2019s capacity to combat future contagion, such \nas  the  installation  of  distributed  automation  system  (DSA),  standardizing  border  screening \nprocedures, strengthening medical programs, and developing future investment pipelines for the \nhealth sector.  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Strengthened implementation capacity for COVID-19 response. Technical \nexpertise and capacity building support will be provided to executing and implementing agencies \nfor the successful implementation of COVID-19 Response Emergency Assistance Project.  The \nTA will fill gaps in loan resources allocated for project implementation support (para. 8). Output 1 \nwill provide support in the following areas: (i) carrying out procurement of equipment, works, \ngoods and consultant packages including stockpiling of emergency medical equipment and drug \nsupply,  and  inventory  system; (ii)  coordinating human resources  development  and training \narrangements; and (iii) strengthening project coordination, procurement, financial management \nand governance, and safeguards systems in the project implementing unit (PIU). \n \n10.  Output 2. Enhanced health system and community capacities to combat future \ncontagion. Output 2 will support measures to strengthen the health system\u2019s response capacities \nand its medium- to long-term capacity development. To improve the efficiency of procurement, \ninventory and warehouse management of medical supplies and equipment, Central Medical \nStores Depot (CMSD) business processes will be re-engineered by assessing its procurement \nsystem, piloting an innovative IT-based DSA in CMSD, and rolling it out to other districts. To \nimprove surveillance, cross-border screening procedures will be standardized, and regional \nsharing of health monitoring and surveillance information will be supported. Human resource \ndevelopment in the health sector will be supported by strengthening infection prevention and \ncontrol programs of medical schools. Public awareness on communicable disease prevention and \ncontrol will be heightened through information and education campaigns.  Target beneficiaries of \nthe activities will be confirmed during the TA inception mission. The TA will also facilitate the \nstrategic planning and development of ADB\u2019s future investment projects to meet long-term needs \nfor the health systems towards building resilient systems and addressing future health security \nthreats posed by communicable disease outbreaks.  \n \n11.  The proposed support for design and installation of DSA system for CMSD will be an \ninnovative approach in strengthening the health system of Bangladesh and supporting its COVID-\n19 response. The DSA system will be designed to have inter-operability with other health \ninformation systems in Bangladesh, particularly, the District Health Information Software 2, an \n \n13 The technical assistance first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 29 April 2020. \n ", "4 \nopen source Health Management Information System used by the Ministry of Health for health \nfacilities. \n \n12.  Output 3: Established effective monitoring and evaluation system. A well-functioning \nproject monitoring and management information system will be established under the project \nimplementation unit to monitor progress on procurement, quality of equipment and civil works, \ncontract management, implementation, fund flows, accounting, audit, and reporting functions. A \ncomprehensive project monitoring dashboard will be developed and operationalized to track \nprogress towards achieving project output and outcome indicators in the design and monitoring \nframework.14 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s TA Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. \nThe government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, \noffice supplies, secretarial and coordination assistance, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will administer the TA in consultation with the executing and implementing agencies. \nADB\u2019s South Asia Department will select, supervise, and evaluate the consultants. ADB will \nrecruit  international  and  national  consultants  using  firm  and  individual consultant  selection \nprocess (paras. 17\u201318). \n \n15.
