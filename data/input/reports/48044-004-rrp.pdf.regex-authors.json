THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed policy-\nbased loans to Georgia for subprogram 2 of the Improving Domestic Resource Mobilization for \nInclusive Growth Program.1  \n \n2.  The proposed program aims to improve domestic resource mobilization to help achieve \nmore  inclusive  growth  in  Georgia.2 The  program  supports  improved  debt  and  fiscal  risk \nmanagement,  more  efficient  revenue  and  public  expenditure  management,  generation  of \ndomestic savings, and mobilization of private resources for investment. Inequality of income and \nopportunity will be addressed through redistributive fiscal policy, specifically in tax and social \nprotection measures.   \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The Georgian economy grew at an annual average of 5.8% during 2004\u20132014. The \ngrowth reflected reforms to liberalize the economy and remove bureaucratic barriers, while \nstrengthening transparency and accountability.  Consequently governance and the business \nenvironment improved, although significant barriers remain to business operations and private \nsector competitiveness. The World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Competitiveness Report for 2014\u2013\n2015 ranks Georgia 69th out of 144 countries. Constraints to private sector development include \nan inadequately skilled workforce, limited access to finance, and gaps in infrastructure.3 \n \n4.  Economic activity in the region has been decelerating  as a result of the  economic \nslowdown in the Russian Federation and a significant fall in oil prices. The economic contraction \nin the Russian Federation has also led to a sharp drop in remittances, erasing any gains from \nlower oil prices in Georgia, which is a net importer. Overall, the regional outlook has not been \nthis weak since the global financial crisis  of 2008\u20132009.4 In February 2015, the Georgian \ngovernment cut gross domestic product (GDP) growth projections by more than half, to 2.0%. \nThe fiscal deficit is expected to rise in Georgia, requiring fiscal consolidation in the short and \nmedium term. The current economic environment is also creating pressure on the country\u2019s \nfinancial system. Currency depreciation is increasing credit and solvency risks, and slowing \neconomic  growth  is  heightening  credit  risk.5 Continuing  structural  reforms  are  essential  to \nincrease  domestic  resource  mobilization  for  more  inclusive  economic  growth,  while \nguaranteeing social assistance to the poor and vulnerable during the slowdown and thereafter.   \n \n5.  Social  expenditures  and  fiscal  pressure.  Georgia\u2019s  generally  strong  growth \nperformance has not been matched by commensurate reductions in unemployment and poverty. \nDespite a decline in the unemployment rate from 16.9% in 2009 to 12.4% in 2014, further \nreduction is needed. The percentage of the population living below the national poverty line \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The proposed program is included in the country operations business plan, 2015\u20132017 for Georgia. ADB. 2014. \nCountry Operations Business Plan: Georgia, 2015\u20132017. Manila. \n3  World Economic Forum. 2014. Global Competitiveness Report 2014\u20132015. Geneva. According to the report, \nGeorgia\u2019s banking system has much work to do in improving access to credit (ranked 110 among 144 countries \ncompared to Armenia at 97, Azerbaijan at 79, and Kazakhstan at 43) and affordability of financial services (ranked \n75 with Armenia at 81, Azerbaijan at 77, and Kazakhstan at 55). \n4  International Monetary Fund. 2015. Regional Economic Outlook Update for the Caucasus and Central Asia. \nWashington, DC. \n5  Since November 2014, the Georgian lari has depreciated by about 31% against the dollar. ", "2 \n(60% of median consumption) was 21.4% in 2014, down from 24.6% in 2004. Beginning in 2012 \nthe  government  has  worked  to  pair  better  economic  performance  with  improved  social \noutcomes. Social spending\u2013\u2013on health, education, and social assistance\u2013\u2013increased to 11.7% \nof  GDP  in  2014  from  11.2%  in  2013,  an  increase  of  nearly  31%  over  2012  budgeted \nexpenditure. Growth in social expenditure is pressuring public finance. Pensions are the largest \nsocial spending item in the state budget; in 2014 it represented 55% of all social benefits and \nabout 19.9% of public expenditure (4.5% of GDP). These costs are expected to continue to \nincrease due to the growing number of pensioners and the rising cost of pension benefits. \n \n6.  Domestic savings and access to finance. The fully government-financed universal \npension system (pillar zero) is the largest component of the current pension system in Georgia, \naccounting for almost 84% of total pension expenditure.6 The system entitles all citizens to \nreceive pension benefits (at 60 years of age for women and 65 for men), making it an important \ninstrument of poverty reduction and income security for the elderly. The flat rate pension has \nmore than doubled over the last 5 years, but is still only marginally above the subsistence level. \nIn the absence of additional opportunities to save, public pressure to raise the universal pension \nrate will increase the government\u2019s financial burden and challenge long-term fiscal sustainability.  \n \n7.  Development and implementation of a multi-pillar pension system will help achieve key \nfiscal and social objectives. Incorporating contributory elements in the pension system will         \n(i)  increase  old-age  income  from  sources  outside  of  the  state  budget;7 and  (ii)  reduce \nexpectations placed on the pillar zero system and (once the new pension system matures) \nspread the burden of financing future pensions more fairly across stakeholders and generations. \nThere is limited domestic funding capacity in Georgia, with a long-term investment horizon that \nrestrains economic growth, creating an over-reliance on foreign inflows. Pension fund assets \nhave long-term investment objectives, with a primary focus of maintaining real asset values. \nThis can stabilize bond markets and security exchanges, and help finance infrastructure needs. \nA defined contributory pension system is expected to improve the overall savings rate in the \ncountry. \n \n8.  Public debt and capital markets. Georgia\u2019s public debt to GDP ratio was 35.5% in \n2014,  75%  of  which  is  denominated  in  foreign  currency  (largely  in  dollars).  This  exposes \nGeorgia to foreign exchange risk, creating a source of vulnerability. Additionally the multilateral \nconcessional windows are closing, raising the average external borrowing rate. A challenging \ntransition from external sources of finance to local currency-denominated government securities \nwill be needed over the medium term. The shift is needed not only to manage the country\u2019s \nforeign exchange exposure, but to support the development of the Georgian bond and capital \nmarkets and to sustain public investment plans. Development of the domestic government yield \ncurve is essential for market infrastructure and information, as it sets the pricing and evaluation \nof domestic credit options for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and capital markets.  \n \n9.  The SME sector represents nearly 95% of registered businesses and employs 37% of \nthe workforce in Georgia, but accounted for only 16.9% of business turnover in 2014. Firms cite \n                                                \n6  Pillar zero is the existing state-run universal pension plan, which offers basic coverage and is primarily focused on \nreducing poverty.  \n7  Contributory elements include a mandatory funded system that recipients and employers pay into (pillar II) through \npension funds and defined contribution savings plans, and possibly voluntary privately funded accounts (pillar III) \nthrough individual savings plans and insurance. The design details of the proposed pension system are included in \nSector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n \n ", "3 \nlimited access to bank credit, high interest rates, and expensive financial services as major \nconstraints to growth. Underdeveloped securities and capital markets as well as reliance on a \nfully publicly funded pension scheme prevent higher savings rates and limit the funds available \nfor lending. Increased access to finance, especially for small businesses managed by women, is \nimportant for diversification of the economy.   \n \n10.  Private  finance  and  fiscal  risks.  The  government  wishes  to  mobilize  private \ninfrastructure investment, highlighting the need to manage fiscal risks. The policy to implement \npublic projects with private sector participation needs to be set up for consistent implementation, \nbecause  many  projects  with  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP)  characteristics  are  being \ndeveloped.  Existing  contracts  for  PPP-type  projects,  as  well  as  projects  currently  under \ndevelopment, contain contingent liabilities for the government. The lack of a framework for fiscal \nrisk means that the contingent liabilities of existing and future PPP contracts are not transparent \nand are not well understood or managed by the government. This exposes ministries, state-\nowned enterprises (SOEs) and local governments to the risk of entering into new contracts \nwithout an accurate assessment of the affordability or fiscal risk. It also makes the market less \ntransparent for the private sector.  \n \n11.  Government efforts and development coordination. The government has initiated a \npension reform program to address adequacy, fairness, and sustainability. A Pension Reform \nUnit was established and staffed in the Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development \n(MOESD)  in  2014  to  design  a  new  defined  contributory  pension  system.  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has been instrumental in facilitating these reforms and in designing \nthe mandatory and voluntary contributory pension schemes. The government is developing the \ndomestic debt market, seeking increased market participation. ADB is working closely with the \ngovernment  to  update  the  regulatory  environment,  to  ensure  issuer  and  trading  price \ntransparency and deepen investor protection. The government has undertaken several activities \nto address fiscal risk management for projects with private involvement, and is increasing the \navailability of finance to SMEs.  \n \n12.  Many  multilateral  and  bilateral  development  agencies  are  supporting  the  country\u2019s \neconomic development. The World Bank is working to strengthen fiscal oversight of public \ninstitutions, upgrade the quality and coverage of social services, and support financial sector \ndeepening through policy lending during 2015\u20132017. In 2014 the European Parliament ratified \nthe European Union\u2019s Association Agreement with Georgia, including an agreement on a deep \nand  comprehensive  free  trade  area  spanning  2014\u20132017,  which  together  with  political \nassociation and market opening aims for approximation of Georgian systems and norms with \nthose of the European Union. In 2014, Georgia entered into a 3-year standby arrangement with \nthe International Monetary Fund that provides a cushion against external balance of payment \nshocks, and sets a framework for discipline in macro-fiscal policies.  \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s  value  additions  and  lessons.  The  program  supports  inclusive  growth  by \ngenerating long-term savings and making short-term capital available for small businesses and \ninfrastructure. The programmatic approach adopted for the program-- sequencing of reforms \nwith the flexibility to incrementally change the reforms based on the progress achieved-- allows \nthe government to build on achievements and lessons from the reforms and to steer the next \nphase of policy reforms accordingly.8 It allows the government to take on complex reforms in a \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2014.

Manila. \n ", "4 \nphased  manner  that  might  have  been  otherwise  delayed.  For  example,  the  government \nembarked on reforms to better manage fiscal risks and contingent liabilities, and to contain the \nburgeoning fiscal costs of the universal pension system. Relevant lessons on the need for policy \nreforms, a stronger focus on inclusive growth, and longer-term engagement in public sector \nreforms have been incorporated from the evaluation findings of Georgia\u2019s country program \nportfolio, and continue to be applied throughout the program cluster.9 Relevant lessons from \nsubprogram 1 include the need for longer-term engagement with the government in key policy \nareas  through  technical  assistance  (TA)  and  sector  reforms  while  strengthening  the \nmacroeconomic framework. ADB is providing ongoing TA, and plans to continue working on \nmacroeconomic and public sector issues. \n \n14.  Alignment  with  ADB\u2019s  strategy.  The  Socio-Economic  Development  Strategy  of \nGeorgia (Georgia 2020) establishes policy directions for sustainable and inclusive economic \ngrowth.10 The proposed program corresponds closely to the core areas of fiscal efficiency, \npublic debt management, domestic savings, access to finance for SMEs, and capital markets. \nThe  program  also responds  to  the  2014\u20132016  National  Action  Plan for  Implementation  of \nGender Equality Policy in Georgia, which includes support for gender equality in economic and \nfinance sectors.11 The program is consistent with the ADB country partnership strategy, 2014\u2013\n2018 for Georgia and the findings from the ADB Midterm Review of Strategy 2020.12 The \ncountry partnership strategy aims to foster inclusive economic growth through measures to \nenhance  private  sector  competitiveness,  improve  public  sector  management,  and  increase \nsavings and domestic resource mobilization for investment. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n15.  The program impact will be that citizens, particularly women, benefit from higher living \nstandards and more employment opportunities. The outcome will be the effective mobilization of \ndomestic resources for increased public and private investment.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n16.  The program comprises three annual subprograms to support the government\u2019s reform \ninitiatives. It specifically covers medium-term issues in four areas: (i) improving management of \ndebt, cash, and fiscal risk; (ii) strengthening revenue and public expenditure management;        \n(iii)  enhancing  generation  of  domestic  savings;  and  (iv)  increasing  mobilization  of  private \nresources for investment. Subprogram 2 has 27 policy actions, with two additional actions \ncompleted that facilitate access to finance for small businesses. Some targets were exceeded: \nthe  actual  number  of  female  auditors  was  147  (versus  a  target  of  110),  and  the \nEntrepreneurship Development Agency (EDA) budget allocation stood at GEL21 million (versus \na target of GEL20 million). The policy action on submission of a capital market strategy to the \ncabinet was modified, with review and approval by the  Economic Council prior to cabinet \ndeliberations. This ensures that the views of all stakeholders are considered through intensive \npublic\u2013private dialogue sessions. There are 25 indicative policy actions for subprogram 3. \n \n17.  Output 1: Improved management of debt, cash, and fiscal risk. The objective of this \noutput  is  to  improve  fiscal  consolidation  through  strengthened  debt,  cash,  and  fiscal  risk \n                                                \n9  ADB.

Subprogram 1 improved debt management capacity by strengthening relevant \ngovernment  processes,  increasing  transparency  and  developing  analytical  and  forecasting \ncapabilities, and facilitating introduction of the medium-term debt strategy. Subprogram 1 also \nstrengthened fiscal risk management by drafting a strategy to deal with different types of fiscal \nrisks and by determining the fiscal position of large SOEs, to enable adoption of systematic \nprocedures and resources to better manage fiscal risks and assess contingent liabilities.  \n \n18.  Subprogram 2 (i) prepared a medium-term debt management strategy covering the loan \nportfolio and goals and principles to apply when incurring new debt; (ii) prepared an action plan \nto strengthen the middle office (analytical) function of the Public Debt and External Financing \nDepartment in evaluating and advising on the public debt portfolio; (iii) developed a systematic \nprocess for debt and loan guarantee recordkeeping, reporting, and validation; (iv) set up a \ndedicated  analytical  function  for  cash  flow  forecasting,  with  budget  and  personnel;                    \n(v) established a dedicated staffed and budgeted function to manage fiscal risks, including \ncontingent  liabilities  of  SOEs  and  PPP  projects;  (vi)  established  procedures,  assigned \ninstitutional responsibilities, and set aside adequate human and financial resources to monitor \nand help manage different types of fiscal risk; and (vii) carried out the first complete assessment \nof (a) macro risk, (b) external debt sustainability, and (c) risk associated with loan guarantees \nand other similar contingent liabilities. \n \n19.  Subprogram 3 will build on the accomplishments of subprograms 1 and 2 by continuing \nto improve the management of debt, cash, and fiscal risk over the medium term. The legislative \namendments  required  to  implement  the  newly  prepared  debt  strategy  will  be  debated  in \nParliament.  Debt  management  and  risk  analysis  systems  will  be  upgraded.  A  systematic \nprocess will be developed to track debt and loan guarantees and report the government\u2019s \nfinancial statements in a timely manner. Information on contingent liabilities related to SOEs and \nPPPs will be provided.  \n \n20.  Output  2:  Strengthened  revenue  and  public  expenditure  management.  The \nobjective of this output is to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of revenue collection, \nimprove  public  expenditure  management,  and  strengthen  local  government  transfers. \nSubprogram  1  established  a  new  administrative  department  under  the  Georgia  Revenue \nService, enabling recovery of tax arrears and increasing revenue collection. Subprogram 1 \ndevised an action plan to replace external auditors with in-house tax auditors, and provided the \nrequisite training. Budgeting and budget execution functions of government entities were also \nintegrated into the public financial management system and the treasury single account.  \n \n21.  Subprogram 2 (i) recovered arrears from active taxpayers of GEL80 million in 2015 (to \ndate); (ii) reduced the statutory time limitation of tax notices and taxpayer notices from 6 to 5 \nyears,  shortening  the  tax  liability  imposition  period  and  providing  relief  to  taxpayers;                \n(iii) increased the number of in-house tax auditors to 286 (versus a target of 275), of which 147 \nare women (significantly exceeding the target of 110); (iv) moved cash operations of local self-\ngovernments and legal entities of public law to the treasury single account, with budgeting and \naccounting  processes  handled  through  the  public  financial  management  (PFM)  system;13                \n(v) MOESD identified gaps in the legal and regulatory framework for preparation, appraisal, and \nimplementation of PPP projects; and (vi) the government submitted to Parliament proposals for \namendments to the Budgetary Code defining the separation of revenues among the state, \nautonomous region, and municipality budgets. \n                                                \n13 There are more than 2,000 schools and kindergartens, many of them in remote and rural areas, which do not \nstrictly come under the purview of legal entities of public law and are not covered. \n ", "6 \n22.  Subprogram 3 will build on the accomplishments made under subprogram 1 and 2. A \nreduction in tax notice time limitations, writing off of tax arrears of defunct businesses on the \nbasis of legally approved categories, and increasing the number of in-house tax auditors to the \nfull complement will streamline tax collection efforts. Drafting of regulations  to support the \npreparation, appraisal, and implementation of PPP projects will facilitate participation of the \nprivate sector in infrastructure projects. \n \n23.  Output 3: Enhanced generation of domestic savings. The objective of this output is \nto reform the existing pension system so that it helps prevent old-age poverty, is affordable for \nboth individuals and society, and is sustainable in the long term. The aim is to streamline the \nuniversal pension and create a supplementary private pension savings scheme. Subprogram 1 \nestablished a government pension reform unit, tasked with designing a pension system built on \na legal and institutional framework covering asset security, consumer protection, professional \nmanagement of investment funds, and a transparent reporting and information system. \n \n24.  Subprogram 2 (i) completed the forecast of the present and future cost of universal \npensions under various scenarios, using the Prost Modeling system developed by the World \nBank and other approaches; (ii) submitted to the government pension system revisions ensuring \ncontinuity of equitable treatment for men and women; (iii) completed analysis of key areas of \npension  system  design  and  structure,  incorporating  mandatory  and  voluntary  dimensions;              \n(iv)  issued  a  consensual  paper  on the  nature  of  the  hybrid  pillar,  including  discussion  on \nmembership, contributions, tax considerations, benefits, gender, and relationships with the zero \npillar; (v) submitted to the cabinet for approval a strategy and time-bound action plan for pension \nreforms, including legal and regulatory gaps, data privacy, and tax legislation; (vi) developed an \napproach for public awareness programs for zero and hybrid pillars, outlining specific measures \nfor continuing equitable treatment of men and women; and (vii) completed the review of the \nexisting private pension structure to incorporate any required changes in the related legislation.  \n \n25.  Under subprogram 3 preparatory steps for implementation will take place, including the \ndevelopment of an individual account system, drafting of legislation for the private pension \nsavings scheme, and launching of a nationwide communication campaign. \n \n26.  Output 4: Increased mobilization of private resources for investment. The objective \nof this output is to mobilize long-term finance and enhance access to finance through small \nbusiness  financing,  development,  and  gender  targeting.  Subprogram  1  established  an \ninteragency  working  group  to  initiate  capital  market  development.  The  EDA  and  Georgia \nInnovation and Technology Agency (GITA) were also created to provide mini- and matching \ngrants to micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises.  \n \n27.  Subprogram 2 (i) issued a public notification on the concept and direction of capital \nmarket  reforms,  including  corporate  securities,  expansion  of  the  bond  market,  and  money \nmarket instruments for secured interbank trading; (ii) submitted to the Economic Council for \napproval, as a precursor to cabinet approval, a strategy and time-bound action plan for capital \nmarket reforms, that addresses legal and regulatory gaps and improvements to market structure \nand efficiency; (iii) allocated a budget of GEL21 million to EDA; (iv) allocated a budget of GEL6 \nmillion to GITA; (v) expanded, within the existing budget, EDA\u2019s matching grant facility for micro, \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises by GEL4 million, with 30% earmarked for businesses run \nby women; (vi) expanded, within the existing budget, GITA\u2019s financial instruments to support \nprivate sector innovation and technology development by GEL3 million, with 30% earmarked for \nbusinesses run by women; and (vii) implemented the gender action plan and publicly reported \non results included in the program policy areas, such as small business training and financing. \n ", "7 \nAdditionally, EDA launched a new program \u201cProduce in Georgia\u201d with a component on micro \nand small enterprise development in rural areas, with a budget of GEL20 million (for 2015\u2013\n2017).  GITA  created  Geolab\u2013\u2013a  mobile  training  and  knowledge  exchange  platform  and \nfabrication  laboratory\u2014for  research  and  development,  with  a  budget  of  GEL1.1  million.  In \naddition three innovation labs were created with GITA support, and construction of the first \ntechno park in Georgia is ongoing. \n \n28.  Under subprogram 3, the implementation of capital market development plan will be in \nan advanced stage, including review of laws and regulations on investment, governance, risk \nmanagement, and fund managers; approval of account and prudential regulations for repos and \nsecurities  lending;  and  expansion  of  the  matching  grant  facility  for  small  enterprises,  with \nspecific gender targets. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n29.  The  overall  program  is  estimated  to  cost  $200  million  equivalent  for  2014\u20132016. \nSubprogram 2 comprises single-tranche loans in the aggregate amount of $75 million equivalent. \nSubprogram  1,  with  a  loan  amount  of  $75  million  equivalent,  was  disbursed  in  2014. \nSubprogram 3, with a loan amount of $50 million equivalent, is subject to further discussion \nbetween  ADB  and  the  government.14 To  help  finance  subprogram  2,  the  government  has \nrequested (i) a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR37,966,000 ($53 million equivalent) \nfrom ADB's Special Funds resources, and (ii) a loan of \u20ac19,891,500 ($22 million equivalent) \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources.15 The Asian Development Fund  loan will have a 25-year \nterm, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \nThe ordinary capital resources loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, \nthe straight-line repayment method, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s European interbank offered rate (EURIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge \nof 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \nBased on this, the average loan maturity is 9.25 years with no maturity premium payable to ADB. \n \n30.  The loan size is based on government\u2019s development financing needs, the nature and \nsequence  of  the  required  reforms,  and  potential  development  impact.  The  government\u2019s \ndevelopment-related financing gap is estimated at GEL1,625 million, an increase of 2.7% in \n2015 relative to 2014.16  The government intends to meet this gap by borrowing from domestic \n(30.8%) and foreign (69.2%) sources. Domestic borrowing comprises GEL400 million issues of \ntreasury securities (net), with an additional GEL100 million issue deposited with banks. While \nforeign borrowing comprises financing and long-term investment credits projected at GEL620 \nmillion, and anticipated budget support from the World Bank and other development partners of \nGEL505 million equivalent (equivalent of GEL172 million policy-based loan from ADB, GEL276 \nmillion  in  development  policy  operations  from  the  World  Bank,  and  GEL57  million  in \nmacroeconomic support from the European Union). ADB\u2019s subprogram 2 will help narrow the \ngovernment\u2019s financing gap by about 34.1% in 2015 and will help meet part of the financing \nneeds. Public debt is projected to climb slightly over 40.0% of GDP at the end of 2015 as a \nresult of government borrowing and program-based budget support, before declining in the \n                                                \n14 The significant economic slowdown and currency depreciation pose serious challenges to the government\u2019s \nongoing reforms with respect to fiscal consolidation, increased domestic resource mobilization, improved financial \nsector diversification, and guaranteed social protection. To cover the larger-than-expected financing gap, the \ngovernment has requested that ADB increase the subprogram 2 amount from the original $50 million to $75 million. \n15 The development policy letter from the government is in Appendix 3. \n16 Government  of  Georgia,  Ministry  of  Finance.  2015.

Budget support is necessary to finance part of the development financing needs, \nparticularly for the period from the introduction of reforms to the realization of fiscal benefits.17 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n31.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) is the executing agency and MOESD and MOF are the \nimplementing  agencies  for  the  program.  A  program  steering  committee  has  been  formed \ncomprising senior officials from the two ministries, chaired by the deputy minister of finance. The \ncommittee meets semiannually to review progress in achieving the program\u2019s agreed policy \nactions. The proceeds of the policy-based loan will be disbursed to Georgia in accordance with \nthe provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements \nfor Program Loans.18 The loan proceeds will be used to finance the cost (excluding local taxes \nand duties) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible \nitems and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The implementation \nperiod  for  the  overall  program  is  from  January  2014  to  December  2016,  while  the \nimplementation period for subprogram 2 is from November 2014 to September 2015. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial  \n \n32.  The reforms supported by the  program entail direct and indirect fiscal costs to the \ngovernment\u2014the cost of implementing and monitoring the reforms\u2014along with fiscal savings in \nthe medium to long term. The reforms bear both the direct and operating costs of dedicated \npublic  functions  and  agencies  established  under  the  program.19 Higher  expenditures  are \ntherefore warranted over the short term to realize these savings, necessitating the need for \nbudget support. Over time, these reforms will generate a positive fiscal feedback by creating a \nwider and more diversified economic base and improved management of macroeconomic risks. \nThe reform program will result in cost savings and additional gains due to (i) declining pension \nfunding costs and a reduced burden on public finances from the introduction of a supplementary \npension system; (ii) financial savings from more efficient and effective use of public resources \nthrough better cash, debt, and fiscal risk management; and (iii) financial gains from additional \nrevenues due to increased mobilization of private capital for investment.  \n \n33.  Pension reforms alone will have major budgetary implications. Pension costs increased \nto GEL1.33 billion (4.5% of GDP) in 2014 and are projected to grow to GEL1.39 billion in 2015. \nGiven regular increases in the universal pension rate and in the number of pensioners, the \ngovernment will incur GEL8 billion in pillar zero payments for 2016\u20132020.20 The government \ncontribution for the proposed pillar II supplementary pension is estimated at GEL313 million in \nthe first 3 years and GEL631 million in the first 5 years of implementation.21 Development of the \nmedium-term debt strategy under the program aims to meet the government\u2019s public financing \nneeds and payment obligations while minimizing long-term costs, with debt ceilings set at 10.5% \n                                                \n17 Paras. 31\u201332 and the Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2) discuss and analyze the direct and indirect fiscal costs to the government of implementing and monitoring the \nreforms, and consequent adjustments to the ongoing policies and programs.  \n18 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n19 The costs incurred to public agencies are in terms of administrative and enforcement costs related to monitoring, \nimplementation and enforcement, as well as direct fiscal costs. The latter include the expense associated with \nestablishing statutory agencies, budget increases, staff time, expenditure programs, and foregone revenue. \n20 Calculations are based on fiscal projections developed by National Bank of Georgia and MOESD; the World Bank \nprojects that pension spending under the current universal system will double to 9% of GDP by 2070. \n21 A detailed analysis and calculations are in the Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked of \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nof budget revenues, 40% of GDP, and 30% of total borrowing. The reform will lead to additional \nbenefits and savings associated with fiscal discipline and with improvements in core budgetary \nand fiscal risk responsibilities as a result of increased risk management capacity within MOF. \nAdditional revenues of GEL80 million have been realized and increased intergovernmental \ntransfers of up to GEL40 million are expected through the program. Developing capital markets \nto mobilize long-term finance will spur growth and increase the efficiency of SMEs through \ngreater  access  to  finance  and  better  gender  targeting.  Mobilizing  private  resources  for \ninvestment is important given the low national savings rate, which compounds the twin deficit of \nfiscal and external imbalances with a low reliance on internal sources of financing. \n \nB.  Governance  \n \n34.  Public financial management risks are manageable for this program. Following the 2003 \nRose  Revolution,  far-reaching  structural  reforms  were  introduced,  strengthening  PFM  and \nreducing  corruption.  The  integrated  PFM  system  was  implemented  and  state  financial \ntransactions unified under a single treasury account. However challenges remain, including \ninadequate monitoring and analysis of government contingent liabilities, the failure to include the \nrevenues and expenditures of some legal entities of public law in budget execution reports, \ninadequate predictability and transparency of intergovernmental transfers, limited internal audit \ncapacity, and weak legislative scrutiny of external audit reports.22 Fighting high-level corruption \nis  a  government  priority.  Aggressive  enforcement  of  anticorruption  policies  has  largely \neliminated petty corruption. The State Procurement Agency continues to improve transparency \nin public procurement processes by adopting international standards. A new electronic module \nwas recently integrated into the e-procurement system that provides a platform for meeting the \nprocurement requirements of multilateral development banks. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the MOF and MOESD.  \n \nC.  Poverty and Social  \n \n35.  The basic pension plays an important role in poverty reduction and serves a valuable \nwelfare distribution function. Without the basic pension, poverty would increase from 24% to \n33%, and inequality would increase the Gini coefficient from 37.7 to 40.9.23 Subprogram 2 is \ncategorized as effective gender mainstreaming. It will address the unequal access to assets and \nresources, and the insufficient attention paid to gender in economic development policy. The \nGeorgia  Revenue  Service  is  hiring  an  equal number  of  women  and men  as  in-house tax \nauditors. Pension reforms will ensure equitable treatment of men and women, allowing both to \naccumulate  sufficient  pension  assets  to  ensure  an  adequate  income  during  old  age  while \nmaintaining prevention of old age poverty through the universal pension. EDA has allocated \n30% of matching grants to women entrepreneurs for business development. GITA has funds \nearmarked to support private sector innovation and technology development,  with 30% for \nwomen entrepreneurs. The government will continue implementing the gender action plan and \nsupporting increased participation of women in economic and business development.  \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n36.  Program activities are confined to policy and institutional reforms. None of the activities \nwill  result  in  or  lead  to  involuntary  resettlement  or  affect  indigenous  peoples.  No  adverse \nenvironmental impacts have been identified. Safeguard categories for environment, involuntary \n                                                \n22  ADB. 2015.

Georgia\u2019s economy has been hit by several severe external shocks: the Russia\u2013Ukraine \ncrisis, the deepening recession in the Russian Federation, and currency devaluations in trading \npartner  countries.  Macroeconomic  management  is  generally  sound.  Because  of  its  solid \nfundamentals,  reform-minded  authorities,  and  improved  market  access  to  the  European \nUnion,24 Georgia  is  well  placed  to  overcome  the  current  challenges.  Weak  monitoring  of \ncontingent  liabilities  and  limited  coverage  of  PFM  are  risks.  PFM-related  risks  are  being \naddressed with support provided under the program and by the TA.25 The integrated benefits of \nthe program are expected to outweigh the costs.26 \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n38.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 2 shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \ndocuments. \n \n39.  The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for subprogram 2, which are \nset forth in the loan agreements. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n40.
