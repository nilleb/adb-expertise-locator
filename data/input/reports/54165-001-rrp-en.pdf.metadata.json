RPPL is anticipating such delays from its main customers\u2014India\u2019s state \npower  distribution  companies  (DISCOMs)\u2014as  a  result  of  the  lockdown  (announced  by  the \nGovernment of India on 24 March 2020) to contain the spread of COVID-19, and the resulting \nsubdued  economic  activity.  The  lockdown  and  reduced  economic  activity  have  also  led  to  a \ntemporary  decline  in  power  demand.  Industries  and  commercial  establishments  are  normally \nprofitable DISCOM customers but have substantially reduced their power consumption, which is \nnegatively impacting DISCOM cash flows.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nProject  identification.  India  is  the  world\u2019s  third-largest  electricity  producer  after  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and the United States,1 with an installed capacity of 370.1 gigawatts \n(GW)  as  of  March  2020.2 India\u2019s  electricity  generation  capacity  increased  by  213  GW  during \n2010\u20132019. Although thermal power accounts for 62.3% of installed capacity, renewable energy \nhas been a key driver of growth. India ranks fifth in installed renewable energy capacity globally,3 \nand  added  71  GW  of  renewable  power  generation  capacity  during  2010\u20132019.  Despite  these \nachievements in increasing installed capacity, India\u2019s average per capita energy consumption of \n1,181  kilowatt-hours  in  FY2019  was  estimated  to  be  one-third  of  the  global  average.  India\u2019s \nrenewable  energy  installed  generation  capacity  is  expected  to  increase  to  450  GW  by  2030,4 \nequal to 40% of total generation capacity.5 India has a shorter-term interim target of adding 175 \nGW of renewable installed capacity by FY2022, including 100 GW of solar and 60 GW of wind \nenergy capacity.6  \n \n4. \n \n5. \nWhile India is making progress towards meeting its development goals, gender disparities \nare prevalent across all sectors, including a decline in women\u2019s labor force participation and an \nincrease in crimes against women.7 The health and economic crisis triggered by the COVID-19 \npandemic  is  further  widening  these  gender-based  disparities,  with  economic  impacts  falling \ndisproportionately on women and girls, who generally earn less, save less, and hold insecure jobs \n\n(Confidential information redacted.) \n\n \n\n1  Enerdata. 2019.

The health of women generally is adversely impacted by the \nreallocation  of  resources  and  priorities,  including  away  from  sexual  and  reproductive  health \nservices.  Unpaid  care  work  has  increased,  as  children  are  out  of  school,  older  persons  have \nheightened  care  needs,  and  health  services  are  overwhelmed.  Gender-based  violence  is \nincreasing exponentially with restricted movement and social isolation measures.8  \n \n6. \n \nProject design. A majority of RPPL\u2019s operational portfolio (77.8%) consists of long-term \n7. \nPPAs  with  various  DISCOMs,  which  have  weak  to  moderate  financial  risk  profiles.  The  lower \npower demand resulting from the COVID-19 lockdown is expected to extend receivable days for \nindependent  power  producers.  The  direct  impact  of  an  increase  in  the  working  capital  cycle \nincludes  (i)  an  increase  in  working  capital  liquidity  required  to  be  provided  by  RPPL  to  its \nsubsidiaries  and  affiliates,  and  (ii)  a  reduction  in  the  dividend  income  from  subsidiaries  and \naffiliates to RPPL as a result of reduced cash available because of delays in receipt of revenue.  \nRPPL proposes to mitigate this impact by (i) postponing planned capacity expansion by delaying \nconstruction of some projects by a few months, (ii) borrowing a short-term liquidity facility of $50 \nmillion  from  ADB,  and  (iii)  utilizing  part  of  its  existing  cash  balance.  The  proceeds  from  the \nproposed debt financing facility will be used by RPPL to fund its working capital requirements. \nRPPL will infuse liquidity into its operating special purpose vehicles by way of shareholder loans \nthat will enable the special purpose vehicles to sustain business operations even with reduced \ncash flows. \n \n8. \nBorrower. RPPL is India\u2019s largest independent renewable power company by operational \ncapacity. It was incorporated in 2011 and commenced operations in 2012 with a 25.2 megawatt \n(MW) wind power project located in Gujarat, India. As of 31 March 2020, RPPL had 5.49 GW of \noperational wind and solar power capacity across nine states in India. (Confidential information \nredacted.)  The  projects  owned  and  under  implementation  by  RPPL  are  backed  by  PPAs  with \ncentral or state government off-takers, with predefined tariffs; 92.2% of RPPL's operating assets \nare held by fully or majority-owned subsidiaries, except for six projects with a combined capacity \nof 492.3 MW that are held directly by RPPL.9  \n \nCapacity  growth.  RPPL\u2019s  operational  capacity  has  increased  at  a  compound  annual \n9. \ngrowth  rate  of  85%  from  FY2012  (25.2  MW  capacity)  to  FY2020  (5.49  GW  capacity)  through \ninternal growth and acquisitions. RPPL acquired KCT Renewable Energy Pvt. Ltd. and its portfolio \nof 103.10 MW of wind energy projects in November 2017, and Ostro Energy Private Limited and \nits portfolio of 1,108.10 MW of wind and solar energy projects in March 2018. As of 31 March \n2020, the operational capacity of RPPL consists of wind power capacity of 3.25 GW, utility-scale \nsolar power capacity of 2.10 GW, and rooftop solar capacity of 144 MW. \n \n10. \n \n11. \n \n12. \n\nADB conducted integrity due diligence.10  (Confidential information redacted.)

The  outputs  of  the  project  are:  (i)  continuity  of  RPPL  operations  ensured; \n(ii) continuity of salary payments to female and male employees ensured; (iii) gender equality of \nCOVID-19 staff arrangements enhanced; (iv) women\u2019s entrepreneurship opportunities enhanced \nand; (v) gender equality of corporate social responsibility program enhanced. \n \nC. \n \nConsistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project, through its support \n16. \nfor sustaining renewable energy operations, is consistent with following operational priorities of \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: (i) priority 2: accelerating progress in gender equality; (ii) priority 3: tackling \nclimate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental \nsustainability;  and  (iii)  priority  4:  making  cities  more  livable. 14 The  project  will  help  enhance \nRPPL\u2019s  gender  inclusiveness.  The  project  qualifies  for  climate  mitigation  as  it  supports  the \noperations  of  renewable  energy  projects,  which  is  an  eligible  activity  under  the  multilateral \ndevelopment  banks\u2019  climate  finance  tracking  methodology.15 However,  there  can  be  no  direct \nemission reduction effect that can be attributed to the project as the renewable energy generation \nby RPPL does not increase as a result of the investment. Ensuring the supply of electricity will \nenable economic activity across the country and enhance the resilience of Indian cities to sustain \nand support an effective response to the pandemic and limit its negative externalities. The project \nis  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  India,  2018\u20132022,  specifically  with \npillar 2  (providing  inclusive  access  to  infrastructure  networks  and  services  by  improving  the \ninfrastructure bottlenecks in lagging regions).16 \n \nConsistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project is aligned \n17. \nwith  ADB\u2019s  $20  billion  response  package  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  (announced  on \n13 April 2020). 17  As  part  of  this  emergency  package,  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations \n\n \n\n11 ADB. 2016.

The proposed project is \nin line with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Private Sector Operations, 2019\u20132024,18 as well as ADB\u2019s \nEnergy Policy,19 as it supports the operations of India\u2019s largest renewable energy company. \n \n18. \nLessons from previous operations. This is ADB\u2019s second transaction with RPPL and \nfifth transaction with the RPPL group.  The previous projects improved ADB\u2019s understanding of \nthe  renewable  sector  in India  and the  challenges  faced  by  developers  in  the  sector.    The  key \nchallenges facing the renewable sector in India are construction delays resulting from delays in \nland  acquisition  and  delays  in  receipt  of  payments  from  DISCOMs.  These  challenges  can  be \nmitigated by acquiring most of the land required for the project before starting construction of the \nproject and having an adequate liquidity buffer so that the developer can provide any short-term \nliquidity support needed to its projects. The proposed project design acknowledges lessons from \nprevious  projects  in  the  renewable  sector  and  will  provide  RPPL  with  short-term  liquidity  that \nwould be used to address any temporary funding needs of its operational projects resulting from \ndelays in receipt of payments from off-takers. \n \nD. \n \n19. \n \nE. \n \n20. \n \n\nTable 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements.20 \n\n(Confidential information redacted.) \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nRegulatory framework \n\nManagement \n\nImplementation period \nConstruction \narrangements: Bidding \nprocess \n\nConstruction \narrangements: \nconstruction process \n\nArrangements \nThe  power  sector  in  India  is  regulated  by  the  Central  Electricity  Regulatory \nCommission, the state electricity regulatory  commissions, and the Central Electricity \nAuthority. The Government of India\u2019s MNRE promotes renewable energy; it is assisted \nby  the  Solar  Energy  Corporation  of  India,  a  government  enterprise  under  MNRE\u2019s \ncontrol, in implementing and facilitating schemes for solar, wind and solar\u2013wind hybrid \nprojects. \nRPPL has a strong management team headed by Sumant Sinha, who has extensive \nexperience  across  operational  and  strategic  focus  areas.  The  key  employees  in  the \nmanagement  team  have  been  with  RPPL  since  its  inception  and  have  a  proven \nperformance  record.  RPPL  has  a  well-developed  organizational  structure,  which \nincludes  experienced  mid-level  and  field-level  personnel  and  a  significant  number  of \nqualified technical personnel.

This \nwill enable RPPL, which is an essential services business, to continue its operations and deliver \na  reliable  supply  of  power to the  domestic  grid during  the  crisis.  The  project  complements the \ngovernment\u2019s $11.9 billion financial package to provide liquidity to DISCOMs to enable them to \npartly clear their payment obligations, which had been  building up even prior to the COVID-19 \ncrisis.21 ADB support would address short-term liquidity constraints at a time of crisis when local \ncommercial banks have become risk averse and have reduced lending activity.22 ADB\u2019s existing \nrelationships have enabled it to build a strong relationship with RPPL, which in combination with \nthe  proposed  debt  financing  facility  will  facilitate  an  enhancement  of  gender  inclusiveness  of \nRPPL, even during this crisis. \n \n \n\n \n\n21 The  liquidity  would  be  infused  (in  two  equal  tranches)  through  Power  Finance  Corporation  (PFC)  and  Rural \nElectrification Corporation (REC).

In  line  with  ESMS  requirements,  RPPL  has  also  established  a  corporate \nenvironment and social team with qualified and dedicated personnel to manage  environmental \nand social operations in coordination with subproject-level environment and social staff.  \n \n31. \nADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social \nimpacts  of the  project  and  the measures to avoid, minimize,  mitigate,  and compensate  for  the \nadverse impacts in the safeguard reports and plans. ADB\u2019s due diligence focused on the seven \nsubprojects funded  by  ADB  against  the requirements  of the  ESMS.  The annual  environmental \nand  social  monitoring  reports  and  supervision  records  were  reviewed,  and  consultations  were \nheld  with  RPPL\u2019s  environment  and  social  team  to  understand  the  status  and  management  of \nsample subprojects under normal and current COVID-19 scenarios. These reviews confirmed the \nadequacy of the ESMS in managing and mitigating environmental and social impacts in line with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. The review also validated the implementation \nof the ESMS across subprojects throughout the project cycle processes. The environmental and \nsocial measures and the institutional capacity and commitment of RPPL to manage the project\u2019s \nsocial and environmental impacts are deemed adequate. RPPL has committed to conducting an \nindependent  portfolio  audit  (based  on  a  review  of  sample  projects)  to  confirm  the  effective \nimplementation of the ESMS. RPPL will implement time-bound corrective action plans in the event \nof any identified gaps. ADB will continue to monitor RPPL\u2019s environmental and social progress \nand performance on an ongoing basis.  \n \n32. \nEffective gender mainstreaming. Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development \n(1998),  RPPL  has  incorporated  measures  to  promote  gender  equality  and/or  women\u2019s \n\n23 ADB.

RPPL  will  submit \nperiodic reports on its implementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \n33. \nRPPL will (i) apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list; (ii) ensure that investments \nusing ADB funds comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and abide by national laws and \nregulations, and comply with national labor laws, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy \n(2001); (iii) take measures to comply with internationally recognized core labor standards;25 and \n(iv) commit to undertake the recommended improvements in the implementation of  its ESMS. \nInformation  disclosure  and  consultation  as  applicable  will  be  conducted  following  ADB \nrequirements.
