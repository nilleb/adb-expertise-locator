The report also describes the \nproposed administration of a loan of $50,000,000 to be provided by the Clean Technology Fund \n(CTF), which will be a rollover from an existing CTF facility supporting phase 1 of the project),1 \nfor  the  Rantau  Dedap  Geothermal  Power  Project  (Phase  2);2 and  if  the  Board  approves  the \nproposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  approve  the \nadministration of the CTF loan. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n1. \n\nProject Identification \n\n \n2. \nIndonesia,  the  largest  economy  in  Southeast  Asia,  had  an  estimated  gross  domestic \nproduct of $932.3 billion (current United States dollars) in 2016.3 It experienced consistent growth \nafter the Asian financial crisis, averaging 5.0% per year during 2011\u20132016, down from 6.4% in \n2010. Improved access to affordable and sustainable forms of energy is critical to enhance the \ncompetitiveness of Indonesia\u2019s power infrastructure, which has been struggling to keep up with \nthe  country\u2019s  strong  economic  performance.  The  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources \n(MEMR) anticipates power demand to increase under current forecasts, resulting in a shortage \nthat could undermine the country\u2019s sustainable growth potential if not addressed adequately. \n \n3. \nIndonesia  has  an  estimated  potential  of  29.5 gigawatts  (GW)  of  geothermal  energy \nresources (the largest in the world), 75.0 GW of hydropower, 532.6 GW of solar power, 32.6 GW \nof biomass and biogas, and 113.5 GW of wind power.4 Nearly every renewable subsector remains \nundeveloped, and the total installed geothermal power capacity in 2017 was only 1.8 GW.5 \n \n4. \nTo  cope  with  predicted  future  electricity  shortages,  the  Government  of  Indonesia \nintroduced  fast-track  programs  to  accelerate  power  generation  development.  In  its  national \ndevelopment plans for 2015\u20132024, it introduced a third fast-track program targeting the addition \nof 35 GW of power by 2019. In early 2017, pursuant to the National Electricity Business Plan, \n2017\u20132026, it adjusted the target completion dates and capacities under this program to 29 GW \nby the end of 2019 and 35 GW by the end of 2021.6 While the largest share of generated energy \nis still expected to come from fossil fuels, the government is encouraging greater use of renewable \nenergy  sources  in  the  generation  mix.  It  has  set  ambitious  targets  to  increase  the  share  of \nrenewable energy from 12% in 2013 to 23% in 2025 in the primary energy mix.7 \n\n                                                            \n1  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2014.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors: \nProposed  Administration  of  Loan  to  PT  Supreme  Energy  Rantau  Dedap  for  the  Rantau  Dedap  Geothermal \nDevelopment Project (Phase 1) in the Republic of Indonesia.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fSimultaneously, the government aims to reduce electricity generation costs. MEMR issued \n5. \nnew regulations in January 2017 to set renewable energy tariffs against local and national grid \nprices, to regulate the procurement process, and more generally to reallocate some risks under \npower purchase agreements (PPAs).8 \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n \n6. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and CTF support for phase 1 of the project (footnote 1) \nvia a $50 million exploration loan financed entirely by CTF in 2014 supported initial drilling and \nexploration  which  successfully  quantified  and  characterized  the  nature  of  the  geothermal \nresources. This has resulted in Phase 2 which will develop the geothermal steam resources at \nthe site through further drilling and construction of production and injection facilities prior to the \noperation and maintenance of a power plant. \n \n7. \nSERD will construct, operate, and maintain the project, with a design gross capacity of \n98.4  megawatts  (MW)  and  net  capacity  of  90.9  MW,  in  South  Sumatra  Province.  It  is  located \nabout  225  kilometers  (km)  southwest  of  Palembang  across  the  administrative  areas  of  Muara \nEnim  Regency,  Lahat  Regency,  and  Pagar  Alam  City.  It  is  within  the  353  square  km  Rantau \nDedap Geothermal Working Area along the Great Sumatran Fault and the Bukit Barisan mountain \nrange at an altitude of 1,500\u20132,600 meters above sea level. \n \n8. \nThe project will be connected from its switchyard to the Lahat grid owned by Perusahaan \nListrik  Negara  (PLN),  Indonesia\u2019s  state-owned  power  utility.  PLN  is  responsible  for  the \ntransmission line that will run from the Rantau Dedap Geothermal Plant to the substation.  \n \n\n3. \n\nBorrower and Sponsors \n\n \n9. \nSERD,  a  special  purpose  vehicle  incorporated  in  Indonesia  is  the  borrower.  SERD  is \nowned  by  PT  Supreme  Energy  (Supreme),  Engie,  Marubeni  Corporation  (Marubeni),  and  by \nTohoku Electric Power (Tohoku).  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n  \n10. \nBased in France, Engie is among the world\u2019s leading independent power producers. Its \ncore operations include power, natural gas and energy services. With operations in 70 countries \nit has 113 GW of installed capacity, of which 21.5 GW is in the renewable energy sector. Marubeni \nis  a  Japanese  trading  house  with  activities  in  a  variety  of  sectors  such  as  textiles,  chemicals, \nenergy,  metals,  mineral  resources,  and  power.  In  the  power  sector,  Marubeni  has  41  GW  of \ncapacity  in  23  countries  around  the  world.

ADB climate \n\nfunding for phase 2 consists only of the $177.5 million ADB loan. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fprogress toward commercial sustainability. ADB\u2019s engagement helps make this project viable and \nwill inspire trust in interested investors from the private sector. \n \n23. \nThe project\u2019s sustainability depends on its ability to amortize its very high up-front capital \ncosts  over  a  long  period  to  reduce  annual  debt  service.  The  long  tenor  of  the  ADB  loan  is \nnecessary for the project to achieve sound debt service levels over the life of the project. \n \n24. \nThe project supports the government\u2019s objective to accelerate and expand private sector \ninvestment in clean energy infrastructure in Indonesia. ADB plays a pivotal role in building a critical \nmass of renewable energy projects in Indonesia to stimulate investor interest in future renewable \nenergy investments and build on the experience of these first-generation investments. \n \nC. \n \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n\nRisks \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n25. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  (SPS),  the  project  is \nclassified category A for the environment, category B for involuntary resettlement, and category \nC for indigenous peoples. \n \n26. \nSERD has completed the construction of the access roads, well pads, and other facilities; \nand the exploration drilling program. The potential environmental and social impacts of the project \nhave been identified and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the \nadverse impacts are incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. The institutional capacity \nand commitment of SERD to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed \nadequate. SERD has undertaken meaningful consultation with the relevant stakeholders and has \nestablished a grievance redress mechanism. A transmission line and a proposed new substation \nto be constructed by PLN are considered associated facilities. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nThe  transmission  line  passes  mostly  through  modified  habitat,  with  a  small  section \n27. \ncrossing  natural  habitat.  Although  the  sponsors  are  not  responsible  for  the  impact  of  the \ntransmission line, they have included measures to offset the impact on the natural habitat in their \nbiodiversity offset strategy. The sponsors are coordinating closely with PLN, and ADB will work \nwith the sponsors to ensure that SPS requirements for associated facilities are met. SERD carried \nout an audit of the existing facilities and committed to a corrective action plan following the SPS. \nThe audit found that the project complies with ambient environmental standards. The project is \nlocated  in  a  nationally  designated  protection  forest  and  is  consistent  with  the  legal  and \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nmanagement requirements for this type of forest.24 The designation is not equivalent to protected \narea Category I or II of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, but the project affects \nthe  natural  habitat  of  endangered  and  endemic  species. 25  A  critical  habitat  assessment \nundertaken  by  qualified  biodiversity  experts  has  resulted  in  the  development  of  a  biodiversity \naction  plan (BAP),  which  includes  both  long-term  biodiversity  conservation  actions  and  on-site \nmitigation measures linked to the construction and operation activities of the project. The BAP will \nbe supported with a biodiversity offset strategy and a biodiversity offset management plan. The \nbiodiversity  offset  strategy  includes  ongoing  contingency  for  management  beyond  the  offset \nmanagement period. The sponsors have committed to these plans to ensure that the project will \nnot  have  an  adverse  impact  on  critical  habitat  such  that  (i)  there  are  no  measurable  adverse \nimpacts on the critical habitat that could impair its ability to function, and (ii) there is no reduction \nin the population of any recognized endangered or critically endangered species. ADB will closely \nmonitor the construction and operational activities, focusing on BAP implementation. \n \n28. \nSERD acquired land for the project through negotiated settlements with project-affected \nhouseholds.  The  2018  social  safeguards  compliance  audit  confirmed  that  (i)  no  households \nexperienced physical displacement; (ii) SERD has compensated all project-affected households \nfollowing  negotiated  compensation  rates  for  land,  crops,  assets,  and  structures;  (iii)  affected \nhouseholds  are  given  opportunities  for  skills  development,  apart  from  prioritization  for \nemployment created by the project; and (iv) no outstanding grievances or complaints related to \nland procurement and compensation exists. ADB has discussed and agreed corrective actions \nwith the borrower. These actions, identified in the social safeguards compliance audit, will further \nimprove stakeholder engagement and livelihood improvement activities implemented by SERD. \nPLN has initiated land acquisition for the transmission line, an associated facility to the proposed \nproject. SERD commits to carry out a compliance audit upon completion of the land acquisition \nby PLN, and implement any corrective actions identified, coordinating closely with PLN to make \nsure  the  approach  is  consistent  with  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements.  BAP \nimplementation is not expected to have involuntary resettlement impacts. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n29. \nThe  proposed  project  does  not  trigger  indigenous  peoples  safeguards.  The  social \nsafeguards compliance audit confirmed that (i) the consultations were conducted in a culturally \nappropriate  manner  and  with  facilitators  from  the  Semendo  community;  (ii)  the  Semendo \ncommunity do not qualify as vulnerable social and cultural groups that experience a higher risk of \npoverty and social exclusion than the general population; (iii) although the Semendo community \nshow to a certain degree some of the characteristics of \u201cindigenous peoples\u201d, they do not fully \nmeet the definition of indigenous peoples in Appendix 3 of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, \nand  therefore  the  policy  is  not  triggered;  and  (iv)  the  Semendo  community  fully  supports  the \nproject and is anticipating benefits from employment creation and integrated social development \nprogram implementation. \n \n30. \nThe audit confirmed that national labor laws and regulations and internationally recognized \ncore labor standards are followed, monitored, and reported. SERD will comply with national labor \nlaws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001), will take measures to comply with \n\n                                                            \n24 Indonesia has three categories of forests: conservation, protection, and production. Protection forests provide a basic \nlife  support  function  such  as  watershed  or  soil  protection  or  flood  control.  Certain  developments  may  occur  in \nprotection  forests  in  accordance  with  a  license.  Conservation  forests  are  those  set  aside  for  the  conservation  of \nbiodiversity and ecosystems. \n\n25 International Union for Conservation of Nature.
