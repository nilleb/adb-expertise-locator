An  environmental  assessment  and \nreview  framework  has  been  prepared  to  guide  environmental \nassessment of projects during implementation. \n \nThe  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Investment  Program  (the \nInvestment  Program)  will  improve  the  quality  and  coverage  of \nurban  services  in  secondary  towns  and  peri-urban  areas \nsurrounding  Baku. \nIt  will  benefit  approximately  500,000 \nresidents.  \n \nThe Investment Program has three components: (i) constructing \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS)  infrastructure  to  boost \nservice  coverage,  quality,  and  reliability  (Component  A);  (ii) \ndeveloping  institutional  effectiveness,  including  management \nand  governance  (Component  B);  and  (iii)  instituting  program \nmanagement  facilities  to  oversee  program  implementation  and \nfor \ntreatment  of \nenvironment  and  social  safeguards  and  gender  mainstreaming \n(Component C).  \n \nfrom  component  A  will  provide  (i) \nPhysical \nincreased  water  supply  coverage;  more  connections  to  piped \nnetworks; and reduced system leaks to ensure 24-hour supply of \npressurized,  safe  drinking  water;  and  (ii)  increased  wastewater \ndisposal  and  treatment.  Components  B  and  C  will  finance \nnonphysical  investments  targeting  (i)  institutional  improvements \nfor  WSS  service  delivery;  (ii)  capacity  development  for  better \nsystem  planning,  operation,  and  maintenance;  (iii)  enhanced \ncost recovery through metering, billing, and collection tariffs; (iv) \nincreased  efficiency  for  timely  processing  of  effective  WSS \nprojects;  and  (v)  a  twinning  arrangement  with  an  external  WSS \nutility  to  support  capacity  development.  Component  C  will \ninclude  project  management  support;  assistance  to  carry  out \ndue  diligence  for  new  tranches;  help  with  gender,  environment \nfinancial,  and \nand  social  safeguards,  governance, \n\nrequirements  such  as \n\ninvestments \n\ntechnical \n\nthose \n\nlegal, \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nMultitranche Financing \nFacility  \n\n \nRationale \n\nadministrative  matters;  design  works  for  subsequent  tranches; \nand general training and development.  \n \nThe  Government  of  Azerbaijan  requested \nthe  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  extend  financing  for  the  Investment \nProgram  through  a  multitranche  financing  facility  (MFF).  The \nMFF modality\u2014up to $600 million\u2014is justified, because  \n\nthat \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nit establishes the foundation for an 8-year partnership \nbetween ADB and the Government of Azerbaijan,  \nit combines interrelated physical and nonphysical \ninvestments, \nit allows for investments to be phased, and  \nit is backed by a clear strategy and policy framework \nand underpins a sound investment program. \n\n \nA stand-alone project would lead to higher transaction costs and \ndeny  the  chance  to  establish  a  long-term  partnership.  A  sector \nloan  approach  would  be  less  efficient  than  an  MFF,  as  the \nInvestment  Program  has  relatively  large  investments  that  are \nless  suitable  for  sector  loan  lending.  A  program  loan  modality \nwould only focus on reforms.  \n \nFollowing  the  dissolution  of  the  Soviet  Union,  the  quality  and \nefficiency of water service delivery declined in Azerbaijan, due to \npoor  management  and  inadequate  investments.  The  existing \nWSS system is over 50 years old. Water supply sources are in a \npoor  state  of  repair,  and  other  modes  of  supply  (e.g.,  through \nprivate  vendors)  are  expensive  and/or  unreliable.  Water \ntreatment  facilities  in  secondary  and  small  towns  are  either \nabsent  or  largely  dysfunctional.  Despite  an  83%  piped-network \ncoverage  rate  in  these  towns,  the  majority  of  residents  do  not \nhave  access  to  safe  drinking  water.  The  sewage  system  is  in \neven  worse  condition.  Pipes  are  broken  or  clogged  with  silt \nand  debris,  and  wastewater  is  discharged  into  ditches  or  the \nnearest  watercourses.  Poor  sanitation  and  leaking  sewers \ncreate serious health risks and environmental hazards. \n \nInsufficient and unreliable infrastructure and services are adding \nto  household  costs  and  are  diminishing  the  quality  of  life  in \nsecondary \nintensive  program  of  reforms  and \norganizational  development  targeting  service  delivery  bodies, \ncoupled  with  long-term  capacity  programs  and  investments,  is \nnow  needed  to  meet  the  targets  under  the  state  program  on \npoverty  reduction  and  sustainable  development  for  2008\u20132015. \nThese  actions  are  also needed  to  ensure  24-hour  water  supply \nand 80%\u201385% coverage in secondary towns. \n\ntowns.

The  design  and  monitoring \nframeworks for the MFF and the first tranche are in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n In its state program on poverty reduction and sustainable development for 2006\u20132015,1 \n2. \nthe Government of Azerbaijan committed to improving access to basic services. Considering the \nimportance  of  safe  drinking  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS),  the  state  program  is  targeting \nimproved  WSS  coverage  and  service  quality  by  2015.  This  includes  100%  coverage  with \n24-hour water supply in Baku and 80%\u201385% coverage in secondary towns and villages.  \n \n3. \n Given  the  magnitude  of  WSS  investment  requirements  and  the  scale  of  related  policy \nreforms, the Government recognizes that improving WSS services in secondary towns requires \nsequenced  interventions  linked  with  reforms.  The  Government  requested  that  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) help finance part of its overall investment program.  \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nEconomic, Demographic, and Poverty Profile \n\nAzerbaijan's  economy  declined  immediately  after  its  independence  from  the  Soviet \n4. \nUnion in 1991. By 1995, its gross domestic product (GDP) had dropped by about 63% from its \npre-independence level. However, due to development of its oil industry, the GDP grew steadily \nbetween 2000 and 2008 by about 10% annually, and the share of oil and gas production of the \nGDP increased from about 27% in 2000 to about 52% in 2008. While non-oil outputs also grew \nat  about  10%  annually,  the  non-oil  sector\u2019s  share  of  GDP  has  remained  relatively  low.  The \nGovernment has recognized that improving infrastructure sectors, including WSS, is as critical \nfor expanding the non-oil sector as it is for improving living standards among its population.  \n \n5. \nOf Azerbaijan's 8.2 million people, about 52% live in urban areas. The average annual \npopulation growth rate for both urban and rural areas has remained steady at about 0.7% since \n2001. Baku, the capital and largest city, has a population of about 2.1 million, followed by Ganja \n(310,000)  and  Sumgayit  (270,000).  There  are  also  11  major  cities  with  populations  above \n50,000 and 28 secondary towns with 20,000\u201350,000 people. \n \n6. \nPoverty  levels  have  declined  from  an  estimated  49.0%  of  the  country\u2019s  population  in \n2001  to  about  13.2%  in  2009.  Although  Baku  has  the  greatest  number  of  poor  people, \nsecondary towns have higher incidences of poverty. Furthermore, rural areas and small towns \nsuffer  from  unreliable  supplies  of  energy,  water,  and  gas,  and  they  often  lack  access  to  basic \neducation and health services.  \n\n2. \n\nWater Supply and Sanitation Services in Secondary Towns \n\n7. \n\nThe WSS sector in Azerbaijan has weak institutions, inefficient operations, outdated and \n\n                                                 \n1   Government  of  Azerbaijan.  2008.  State  Program  on  Poverty  Reduction  and  Sustainable  Development  for  \n\n2006\u20132015. Baku. \n\n\fdilapidated  physical  infrastructure,  and  severe  financial  constraints.  As  a  result,  consumers \nreceive poor quality WSS services. Existing WSS services have especially impaired the poor as \n(i)  they  spend  more  time  collecting  mostly  unsafe  water;  and  (ii)  they  must  obtain  smaller \nquantities  of  water  from  vendors,  often  paying  10  times  above  what  high-income  households \npay.  \n\n8. \nUntil  2004,  the  WSS  sector  comprised  (i)  Greater  Baku  and  the  Apsheron  peninsula, \nserved by the joint stock company (JSC) Apsheron Regional Water Company; and (ii) all urban \nand  rural  communities  outside  the  Apsheron  peninsula,  served  by  the  Azersukanaltemir \nProduction Union (AzerSuKanal), a department within the State Committee for Construction and \nArchitecture. In June 2004, Presidential Decree No. 252 liquidated AzerSuKanal and transferred \nits  functions  and  assets  to  JSC  Azersu  (AZERSU),  formerly  Apsheron  Regional  Water \nCompany, for improving WSS management. \n\n9. \nAzerSuKanal  had  51  local  branches  or  water  and  wastewater  enterprises,  known  as \nSuKanals,  to  provide  WSS  services  in  provincial  towns  and  other  residential  areas.  Under \nPresidential Decree No. 252, AZERSU now manages all SuKanals and JSCs,2 coordinates their \nactivities, and prepares proposals on implementing state policy to improve WSS systems. The \nexception  is  in  Nakhchivan  Autonomous  Republic,  where  WSS  is  overseen  by  the  State \nAmelioration and Water Management Agency (SAWMA). \n \n10. \nThe  current  institutional  setup  is  complex,  as  several  institutions  have  overlapping \noversight  functions.  They  include  (i)  the  State  Property  Company  under  the  cabinet  of \nministers,  which  holds  AZERSU\u2019s  shares;  (ii)  the  Tariff  Council,  which  regulates  sector \neconomics and pricing; and (iii) the Ministry of Health, which is responsible for monitoring water \nquality.  Consequently,  overall  sector  performance  is  not  well  monitored  or  documented.  The \nsector needs a leading policy oversight body with sufficient authority to monitor performance, to \nensure  that  funds  provided  to  AZERSU  and  SAWMA  are  well  spent,  and  to  improve  service \ndelivery.3 \n \nSuKanals  and  JSCs  have  limited  institutional  capacity.  They  are  predominantly  \n11. \nengineering-focused,  with \ninfrastructure \nmaintenance. They lack efficient operational planning, financial management, and commercial \nperformance.  Comprehensive \ninstitutional  structures, \nmanagement, staff composition, and skills mix for them to function as full-pledged WSS utilities.  \n \n Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the quality and efficiency of water service \n12. \ndelivery declined due to poor management and inadequate investments. Now, the WSS system \nis over 50 years old and in a poor state of repair. Other modes of supply (e.g., through private \nvendors)  are  expensive  and/or  unreliable.  Water  treatment  facilities  in  many  secondary  towns \nare  either  absent  or  dysfunctional,  and  distribution  networks  are  inappropriately  sized  and \ndilapidated.   Despite  an 83%  piped-network  coverage  rate  in  secondary  towns,  the  majority  of \nresidents  do  not  have  access  to  safe  drinking  water.  Unaccounted-for  water  is  difficult  to \nestimate,  because  there  have  been  no  realistic  assessments  due  to  the  absence  of  water \nmeters.  Moreover,  engineering  drawings  of  the  distribution  systems  are  rare,  which  make \nmaintenance  and  repairs  difficult.  Service  levels  vary  from  town  to  town.  The  latest  municipal \n\nto  system  operation  and \n\nreforms  are  necessary \n\ninsufficient  attention \n\ntheir \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n2   In Agdash, Ganja, Goychay, and Sheki, WSS operations are currently being carried out under separate JSCs\u2014the \nsubsidiary companies of AZERSU formed under projects financed by ADB and German development cooperation \nthrough KfW. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fservices  survey4 carried  out  across  the  country  in  2003  revealed  that  at  least  81%  of  urban \nhouseholds  and  over  90%  of  the  households  in  major  cities  had  house  water  connections.  In \nsmaller  secondary  towns,  more  than  75%  of  households  relied  on  wells  and  private  water \nvendors. \n \n13. \n The sewage system is in even worse condition. Only 55% of Azerbaijan\u2019s population \nhas  access  to  sanitation  facilities.  Access  in  urban  areas  is  higher  than  in  rural  areas,  with \ncoverage estimated at 73% and 36%, respectively.5 The sewage network in Baku serves about \n78% of the city's population.6 Sewage coverage in other urban areas is about 32%. Pipes are \nbroken or clogged with silt and debris, and wastewater is discharged into ditches or the nearest \nwatercourses.  Poor  sanitation  and  leaking  sewers  are  creating  serious  health  risks  and \nenvironmental hazards.  \n \n14.  Water  supply  in  Azerbaijan  is  intermittent,  of  limited  quantity,  and  of  poor  quality  with \nhigh  levels  of  silt.  Many  consumers  buy  water  from  private  vendors  to  augment  their  supply. \nDuring  heavy  rains,  raw  sewage  floods  streets  and  house  compounds,  and  existing  treatment \nfacilities  do  not  operate.  River  pollution  increases,  and  stagnant  sewage  threatens  health \nconditions. Data on drinking water quality in Azerbaijan are scant due to inadequate monitoring \nand record-keeping practices at the SuKanal and JSC level. While some reports indicate that \nwaterborne diseases (e.g., bacterial dysentery, parasitic infections, viral hepatitis, and typhoid) \nwere  widespread  during  the  1990s,  official  health  statistics  indicate  that  their  incidence  is \ndeclining. \n \n Furthermore,  the  current  financial  performance  of  SuKanals  and  JSCs  is  poor. \n15. \nAlthough SuKanals and JSCs are self-financing agencies in principle, they are unable to fully \nrecover  tariffs  directly  due  to  the  poor  condition  of  infrastructure  and  related  services.  For \nnonroutine repairs, SuKanals and JSCs rely on additional funds from AZERSU, which are not \nalways  forthcoming.  Additionally,  operating  revenues  from  tariffs  are  inadequate  for  proper \noperation  and  maintenance,  which  has  led  to  the  continued  deterioration  of  WSS  systems. \nBilling and recording of outstanding amounts are not properly managed, and customers resist \npaying water bills due to poor service. The current method of door-to-door payment collection \nalso  compromises  the  ability  to  monitor  payment.  The  absence  of  residential  and  bulk  water \nmetering not only makes it impossible to measure consumption and to establish suitable tariffs, \nbut also reduces incentives for demand management.  \n  \n16. \nUnsurprisingly,  AZERSU  is  currently  saddled  with  a  huge  backlog  of  arrears  inherited \nupon  its  establishment  in  2004.  Both  AZERSU  and  SAWMA  have  not  been  generating \nsufficient revenues to cover operation and maintenance costs and depreciation, rendering them \nunable to expand systems and to improve service quality.  \n \nB. \n\nKey Problems and Opportunities \n\n17. \nFiscal Constraints. WSS services will continue to deteriorate without further investment \nin  their  operation  and  maintenance  and  in  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  associated \nfacilities.  The  fiscal  and  financing  dimensions  are  significant,  with  estimates  of  urban  and \nindustrial  WSS  investment  and  operating  needs  necessitating  $350  million  annually  over  the \nnext 10 years. While Azerbaijan\u2019s high economic growth offers an opportunity to meet some of \n\n                                                 \n4   World Bank. 2003. Azerbaijan Municipal Services Study. Washington, DC. \n5   2004 data. World Bank. 2004. World Development Indicators 2004. Washington, DC. \n6   The United Nations Environmental Performance Review, 2004 gives sewage coverage in Baku as 72%.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fthese  needs,  investments  alone  are  inadequate  to  solve  the  existing  problems  unless  overall \nmanagement of WSS service delivery is improved and efficiency measures are introduced.  \n \n18. \nImproved  public  infrastructure,  sustainable  environmental  management,  better  public \nadministration, and good governance are key strategic goals of the state program (footnote 1). \nThe  Government  has  developed  a  large-scale  investment  program,  estimated  at  $3.5  billion \nover  the  next  10  years.  To  date,  the  Government  has  received  about  $890  million  from \ninternational  financial  institutions  to  upgrade  service  quality.  For  financial  sustainability,  the \nGovernment established the Tariff Council to guide tariff policies, and increased water tariffs in \nJanuary  2007  by  about  87%  for  all  water  users.  It  also  introduced  international  financial \nreporting  standards  for  all  utilities,  including  SuKanals,  to  improve  financial  management  and \nsustainability.  However,  the  Government  still  needs  additional  financial  support  for  WSS  both \nfrom international financial institutions and its own resources.  \n \n19. \nOperational  and Financial  Management. In general, SuKanals and JSCs lack clearly \ndefined  statements  of  functions,  duties  and  responsibilities,  and  operating  procedures.  Key \nissues are \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nInsufficient  autonomy.  Lack  of  autonomy  for  SuKanals  and  JSCs  to  operate, \nmaintain,  and  manage  WSS  systems\u2014and  dependence  on  AZERSU  and \nSAWMA  for  operational  decisions\u2014impede  the  sense  of  ownership,  initiative, \nresponsibility,  and  accountability,  which  are  the  foundations  of  good  utility \nmanagement.  Water  and  sewage  tariffs  are  low,  and  collection  of  revenues  is \nhampered  by  unwillingness  of  SuKanals  and  JSCs  to  discontinue  services  to \nnonpaying customers. \nLack  of  managerial  capacity.  Excessive  focus  on  production  and  insufficient \nattention  to  maintenance,  efficiency,  and  information  management  typify  weak \nmanagement  and  poorly  governed  systems  in  SuKanals  and  JSCs.  All \ninformation is manually recorded, and updated and reliable engineering drawings \nand  maps  are  often  unavailable.  Actual  data  on  operations  and  network  are \nvirtually  nonexistent,  and  performance  monitoring  and  benchmarking  systems \nare  rarely  adopted.  Manual  billing,  poor  collection  efficiency,  inadequate \nbookkeeping,  and  outdated  customer  databases  contribute  to  poor  financial \nmanagement and low productivity.  \n\n \n20. \nPolicy  dialogue  was  held  with  the  Government  on  several  key  issues:  (i)  economic \nconsiderations  of  investments  and  the  necessity  of  designing  WSS  infrastructure  of  optimal \nsize  and  capacity;  (ii)  independent  municipal  and  corporatized  utilities  regulated  by  AZERSU \nand  SAWMA;  (iii)  tariff  levels  and  the  importance  of  the  utilities\u2019  financial  sustainability;  (iv) \noutsourcing  and  introduction  of  performance-based  management  contracts  following  the \ncompletion  of  physical  works;  (v)  viewing  WSS  as  one  sector,  and  the  importance  of \nenvironmental  sustainability;  (vi)  conversion  of  SuKanals  to  JSCs  following  the  infrastructure \ndevelopment;  and  (vii)  public  outreach  program  for  mainstreaming  consumers'  concerns, \nincluding gender.  \n \nTo  become  sustainable,  SuKanals  and  JSCs  need  to  improve  their  operational \n21. \nefficiency,  reform  their  management  structure,  and  introduce  cost-saving  and  revenue-\nimproving  measures.  Two  main  areas  for  improving  financial  management  are  revenue \ncollection  and  operating  costs.  Revenue  collection  can  be  increased  by  (i)  improving  service \ndelivery, (ii) reforming billing and collection procedures, (iii) updating the consumer database to \nregister all new and illegal consumers, (iv) classifying customers by their payment history and \ntargeting  intermittent  payers  and  persistent  non-payers  with  public  outreach  programs,  (v) \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fgranting legal powers to SuKanals and JSCs to enforce a disconnection policy for bill defaulters, \nand (vi) metering all connections. Operating costs can be reduced by introducing improved cost \ncontrol and budgeting systems and procedures and by implementing cost-reduction techniques. \nPrime areas for cost reduction include electricity and redundant administrative costs. \n\nC. \n\nProgram Rationale \n\n22. \nThe  quality,  coverage,  and  reliability  of  infrastructure  and  services  have  not  kept  pace \nwith the rapid growth of Azerbaijan\u2019s economy and secondary town population. Insufficient and \nunreliable infrastructure and services are adding to household costs and diminishing the quality \nof life of the towns' population. An intensive program of reforms and organizational development \nof service providers\u2014coupled with long-term capacity development and significant investment in \ninfrastructure  and  services  at  the  town-level\u2014is  necessary,  especially  for  meeting  the  state \nprogram on poverty reduction and sustainable development goals.  \n \n23. \nIncreasing  demands  on  existing  WSS  infrastructure  mean  that  WSS  needs  cannot  be \nfully  met  through  traditional  government  provision,  subsidies,  and  transfers.  Therefore, \nalternative  sources  of  financing  and  new  ways  of  providing  infrastructure  and  self-financed \nservices are required. The Government requested that ADB extend financing for the Investment \nProgram through an MFF. The MFF modality is justified, because \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nit  establishes  the  foundation  for  an  8-year  partnership  between  ADB  and  the \nGovernment; \nit combines interrelated physical and nonphysical investments;  \nit allows for investments to be phased; and \nit  is  backed  by  a  clear  strategy  and  policy  framework  and  underpins  a  sound \ninvestment program. \n\n \n24. \nStand-alone  projects  would  lead  to  higher  transaction  costs  and  deny  the  chance  to \nestablish a long-term partnership. A sector loan approach would be less efficient than an MFF, \nas  the  Investment  Program  has  relatively  large  investments,  less  suitable  for  sector  loan \nlending. A program loan would only focus on reforms. \n \nD. \n\nPrior External Assistance and Lessons  \n\n25. \nCurrent  ADB  assistance  to  WSS  in  Azerbaijan  comprises  a  $30  million  loan  for  the \nUrban WSS Project and a $1.24 million grant for related technical assistance.7 The Investment \nProgram  builds  upon  these  interventions  by  greatly  assisting  secondary  towns  in  Azerbaijan. \nOther  development  partners  helping  develop  Azerbaijan\u2019s  urban  WSS  include  the  European \nBank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  Natexis \nBanques Populaires, German development cooperation through KfW, and World Bank. Details \non external assistance are in Appendix 3. \n \n26. \nThe Investment Program design takes into account lessons from the current ADB WSS \nProject,  which  experienced  start-up  delays  but  is  now  performing  well.  There,  ADB's \nengagement in the sector, like all other donors, has been affected by (i) executing agency (EA) \ndelays in recruiting consultants, preparing engineering designs, and appointing contractors; (ii) \nAZERSU's lack of autonomy in procurement and dependence on government decision-making \n\n                                                 \n7   ADB.  2004.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  Proposed  Loans  and \nTechnical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Republic  of  Azerbaijan  for  the  Urban  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Project. \nManila (Loans 2119-AZE(SF)/2120-AZE, $30 million). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fprocesses; (iii) limited national consulting and contract management capacity; (iv) limited role of \nSuKanals  and  JSCs  in  project  implementation;  (v)  little  support  from  EAs  to  develop  SuKanal \nand  JSC  capacity  to  operate  and  maintain  completed  projects;  (vi)  lack  of  community \nawareness  of  project  benefits;  and  (vii)  limited  public  awareness  of  project  planning  and \noperation and maintenance requirements. ADB, along with other key donors, are tackling these \nproblems  with  a  range  of  responses,  including  a  major  institutional  reform  study  by  the  World \nBank,  augmented  by  a  capacity  development  facility  for  strengthening  agencies  involved  in \ninfrastructure delivery. \n \n27. \nADB has identified key lessons, such as (i) consumers understand the need for higher \ntariffs,  but  first  need  to  see  adequate  and  reliable  WSS  services  in  place;  (ii)  rigorous  project \nadministration  and  quick  responses  to  emerging  problems  are  important  to  achieve  timelines; \n(iii)  given  the  involvement  of  several  development  partners  that  have  similarly  large  programs \n(e.g.,  World  Bank),  strong  coordination  and  a  shared  view  on  reforms  are  crucial;  (iv)  a \nsuccessful  water  utility  requires  skilled,  experienced  staff;  and  (v)  sustainable  operation  and \nmaintenance  practices  underlie  the  achievement  of  a  project's  economic  benefits.  Finally,  an \nadequate provision for staff training, based on a needs analysis, ensures that capacity gaps are \naddressed.  \n \n28. \nThe  Investment  Program  design  addresses  these  lessons  by  (i)  commencing  advance \nprocurement  actions  on  consultant  recruitment  and  works  from  the  loan  fact-finding  stage;  (ii) \nintroducing  a  program  management  facility  to  AZERSU  and  SAWMA  to  identify,  process,  and \nimplement projects on schedule; (iii) providing a financing modality (i.e., the MFF) that provides \nmore  clarity  for  longer-term  project  funding  in  the  sector;  (iv)  encouraging  economies  of  scale \nwith  larger  and  fewer  construction  contracts  and  better  supervision;  (v)  introducing  incentive \nprovisions in the contractors' contracts to speed up execution; (vi) obtaining strong government \nsupport  for  expediting  approval  procedures  through  monthly  review  meetings;  committing  to \ninstitutional restructuring; and rationalizing systems related to tariff setting, computerized billing \nand recording, and metering; (vii) including institutional effectiveness (component B) through a \ntwinning  arrangement  with  an  external  WSS  utility  for  sharing  of  technical,  financial,  and \nadministrative  best  practices;  and  (viii)  including  a  public  outreach  program  to  generate \nawareness  about  the  Investment  Program,  and  promoting  equity  and  inclusiveness  through  a \ngender  action  plan.  The  design  and  implementation  of  measures  for  improved  WSS \nmanagement will be closely coordinated with other ongoing donor-funded projects.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n29. \nThe  Investment  Program  will  improve  public  health  and  the  environment  in  the \nparticipating  secondary  towns  and  peri-urban  areas  surrounding  Baku\u2014areas  comprising \n500,000  residents.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  coverage,  and  the  continuity  and  quality  of \nwater supplies and wastewater disposal.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n30. \nThe  outputs  of  the  Investment  Program  include  (i)  the  physical  expansion  of  the  WSS \nsystem;  (ii)  greater  institutional  efficiencies  and  management;  and  (iii)  better  planning, \nmonitoring, evaluation, and reporting. The Investment Program spans over 8 years and includes \nthe following components. \n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n1. \n\nComponent A: Water Supply and Sanitation Infrastructure Development  \n\n31. \nComponent A will include rehabilitation, reconstruction, and extension of WSS networks \nin  six  towns  and  peri-urban  areas  surrounding  Baku.  Activities  will  comprise  (i)  water  source \ndevelopment  (i.e.,  identification,  improvement,  and  augmentation);  (ii)  laying  new  and/or \nrehabilitating  existing  water  transmission  and  distribution  pipelines;  (iii)  developing  storage \nreservoirs  and  water  treatment  plants;  (iv)  installing  bulk  and  individual  water  meters;  (v) \nconducting  water  quality  monitoring;  (vi)  undertaking  sewage  network  improvements;  and  (vii) \nconstructing new and/or rehabilitating existing wastewater treatment plants.  \n \n32. \nTranche  1.  Under  the  first  tranche,  component  A  will  finance  physical  investments  in \nWSS  systems  covering  (i)  water  distribution  and  sewage  system  reconstruction  and  their \nextension  in  Goychay;  and  (ii)  for  Nakhchivan,  new  water  intake  and  treatment  facilities,  new \nwater  transmission  mains  from  the  water  reservoir  to  the  city,  water  feeder  mains,  and  trunk \nsewers  in  selected  zones.  This  component  will  also  finance  installation  of  bulk  and  individual \nwater meters, and ensure water quality and treated effluent monitoring in both areas. \n \n33. \nTranches  2\u20135.  Under  the  subsequent  tranches,  component  A  will  finance  WSS \ninfrastructure  in  Agdash,  Agdjabedi,  Balaken,  Beylagan,  Goychay,  Nakhchivan,  peri-urban \nareas surrounding Baku, and other developing urban centers. \n\n34. \nThis  component  will  increase  water  supply  coverage  and  the  number  of  metered \nconnections  to  piped  networks;  reduce  system  leaks  to  ensure  24-hour  supply  of  pressurized, \nsafe drinking water; and improve the disposal and treatment of wastewater.  \n\n2.  \n\nComponent B: Institutional Effectiveness  \n\nThis  component  will \n\ninstitutional \n35. \nimprovements  for  WSS  service  delivery;  (ii)  capacity  development  for  better  system  planning, \noperation,  and  maintenance;  (iii)  enhanced  cost  recovery  through  metering,  billing,  and \ncollection  tariffs;  (iv)  increased  efficiency  for  timely  processing  of  effective  WSS  projects;  and \n(v) a twinning arrangement with an external WSS utility to support capacity development.  \n\nfinance  nonphysical \n\ninstruments \n\ntargeting \n\n(i) \n\na. \n\nImproving Operating Efficiency  \n\nThis subcomponent will improve institutional performance through streamlined financial, \n36. \ntechnical, and procurement operations. Planned interventions are (i) technical, operational, and \nmanagement  training  for  SuKanals  and  JSCs;  (ii)  improving  financial  management  by \nintroducing  better  accounting  procedures,  computerized  billing,  and  management  information \nsystems that feature budgeting, inventory of assets and staffing, operation and maintenance of \nassets,  meter  reading,  billing,  revenue  collection,  and  reporting  systems;  (iii)  rationalizing \nexisting  tariffs  and  introducing  a  tariff  plan  that  incorporates  progressive  tariff  revision  by \nincluding  inflation  and  cost  of  services;  (iv) measures  for  reduction  of  electricity  and \nadministrative costs; (v) asset management and development of operational manuals; and (vi) \nintroducing  a  performance  benchmarking  system  for  SuKanals  and  JSCs  comparing  their \nprogress over time. Wherever possible, technical training will be linked to measurable outputs to \nhelp  determine  whether  skill  levels  have  been  achieved  and  technical  training  is  applied.  This \nsubcomponent  will  also  finance  office  furniture  and  basic  office  equipment  to  computerize \noperations. The design and implementation of measures for improved WSS management will be \ncoordinated with ongoing donor-funded projects.  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f \n37. \nUnder  this  subcomponent,  a  disconnection  policy  for  non-payers  will  be  formulated  to \nempower SuKanals and JSCs. In parallel, an incentive plan will be prepared for regular payers. \nCustomer care centers, with trained male and female employees, will be established to resolve \ncustomer  complaints  through  effective  information  and  customer  feedback  systems.  This \nsubcomponent will also improve business rules by clearly defining staffing needs, functions, and \nduties, and clarifying responsibilities of management. \n\nb. \n\nPublic Outreach Program \n\n38. \nThis  subcomponent  will  generate  program  awareness  and  mainstream  consumers  in \nsupporting project  implementation.  Town  water  users\u2019  associations  (TWUAs)  will  be  formed  to \nrepresent  consumer  interests,  including  gender.  TWUAs  will  monitor  consumer  satisfaction  of \nthe improved service quality, and ensure timely reporting  of any system  malfunction, leaks, or \nenvironmental  issues  to  SuKanals  and  JSCs.  TWUAs  will  also  educate  consumers  on  their \nresponsibility  to  pay  for  improved  services.  Under  this  subcomponent,  TWUA  capacity  will  be \ndeveloped  through  program  monitoring  facilities  in  public  awareness;  hygiene  and  sanitation; \nand  information,  education,  and  communication  campaigns.  Both  men  and  women  will \nparticipate in the public hygiene awareness campaign. This subcomponent will also develop a \ncomprehensive communications strategy to encourage information sharing and effective press \nrelations. \n \n39. \nTranche 1 and Subsequent Tranches. Component B will be implemented in its entirety \nunder  the  tranche  1  project  in  the  towns  of  Goychay  and  Nakhchivan.  Under  subsequent \ntranches, component B will finance similar activities in Agdash, Agdjabedi, Balaken, Beylagan, \nperi-urban areas surrounding Baku, and other urban centers.  \n \n\n3.   \n\nComponent C: Establishment of a Program Management Facility  \n\n40. \nComponent  C  will  provide  (i)  project  management  support  and  assistance  to  carry  out \ndue  diligence  for  new  tranches;  (ii) help  with  gender,  safeguards,  governance,  legal,  financial, \nand administrative matters; (iii) design works for subsequent tranches; and (iv) general training \nand development.  \n \n41. \nA  program  management  office  (PMO)  to  be  established  for  each  EA  (AZERSU  and \nSAWMA)  will  have  counterpart  staff  members  and  program  management  facility  consultants. \nEach  program  management  facility  will  comprise  a  team  of  international  and  national \nconsultants  to  be  recruited  through  international  firms  and  individuals.  These  consultants  will \nsupport  PMOs  in  (i)  preparing  periodic  financing  requests;  (ii)  preparing  detailed  design  for \nfuture investments; (iii) managing bid processes; (iv) supervising procurement and construction; \n(v) overseeing safeguards and gender compliance; (vi) coordinating rayon (town) agencies; (vii) \nmonitoring  and  evaluating  program  progress  and  preparing  progress  reports;  (viii)  providing \nexpertise  in  project  management,  planning,  results  measurement,  and  training;  and  (ix) \nproviding  hands-on \nto  SuKanals  and  JSCs  during  each  stage  of  program \nimplementation. \n \n42. \nTranche 1 and Subsequent Tranches. Under the tranche 1 project, component C will \nfinance  operations  of  PMOs  and  implementation  oversight  at  Goychay  and  Nakhchivan  JSCs. \nThe  component  will  also  (i)  finance  the  international  consulting  firm  to  undertake  bid  process \nmanagement, (ii) help the JSCs oversee construction, (iii) prepare detailed engineering designs \nand  drawings  for  works  at  Agdjabedi,  Balaken,  and  Beylagan;  and  (iv)  undertake  feasibility \n\ntraining \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fstudies  in  peri-urban  settlements  of  Baku.  Subsequent  tranches  will  finance  implementation \noversight  at  JSCs  and  consulting  services  for  supervising  works  in  the  remaining  program \ntowns. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n43. \nAdvance  Project  Readiness.  The  existing  WSS  infrastructure  needs  in  Azerbaijan \ndemand  expeditious  preparation  of  projects  and  timely  processing  of  loans.  The  sector \ndevelopment  road  map  and  investment  plan  (Appendix  2)  implementation  includes  special \narrangements  to  meet  this  requirement.  Detailed  design  of  works  under  the  tranche  1  project \nhas  already  been  completed.  With  advance  procurement  actions  already  under  way,  contract \nawards for priority packages of works and consultancy services are planned immediately after \nloan  effectiveness.  Also,  due  diligence  for  the  tranche  2  project  has  also  been  completed  in \nparallel, and processing for the second PFR is planned to be completed within 6 months after \napproval of the Investment Program. Accordingly, the program management facility consultants \nunder  the  first  tranche  project  will  have  four  teams  to  carry  out  tasks  for  tranche  1,  2,  and  3 \nprojects. Team 1 will be responsible for contract awards and construction supervision of tranche \n1  project  activities,  team  2  will  carry  out  advance  detailed  design  work  for  tranche  2  project \nactivities, team 3 will conduct due diligence for tranche 3 project activities, and team 4 will carry \nout tasks for the institutional effectiveness of service providers and help the PMOs with gender, \nsafeguards,  governance,  legal,  financial,  and  administrative  matters,  and  general  training  and \ndevelopment.  \n \n44. \nChange  in  Business  Culture  and  Management.  Because  of  heavy  subsidies \ntraditionally provided to the sector\u2014as well as deteriorated systems, inadequate resources, low \ntariffs, and poor payment discipline in the sector\u2014water supply in Azerbaijan is widely perceived \nto  be  a  loss-suffering  business.  SuKanals  have  become  reactive  service  providers  without \nadequate  incentives  to  expand  their  customer  base.  As  a  result,  their  management  is  not \nforward-looking,  staff  members  are  inadequately  motivated,  daily  operating  procedures  are \nabandoned, and consumer complaints are not properly recorded and answered. The Investment \nProgram  will  strengthen  the  financial  viability  of  WSS  services  and  make  the  SuKanals  more \nautonomous  and  accountable  by  investing  in  infrastructure  improvements,  introducing  needed \ninstitutional  and  financial  reforms,  and  enhancing  the  skills  and  capability  of  SuKanal  staff. \nSuKanals  will  be  given  more  incentives  to  improve  their  performance  and  expand  their \nbusiness, procedures will be prepared and implemented in daily operations, performance will be \nbenchmarked,  and  a  consumer  complaint  mechanism  will  be  developed  and  adopted.  The \nSuKanals  should  thus  be  transformed  gradually  from  reactive  to  business-oriented  service \nproviders,  with  a  forward-looking  strategy  and  internal  incentives  to  upgrade  knowledge  and \nskills, control costs, improve performance, and expand their customer base. Consumers\u2019 rights \nand customer contracts will become a core part of the SuKanals\u2019 business culture. \n \n45.  Metering. The water meter is the cash register and a critical management tool in water \nsupply  systems.  Together  with  volumetric  pricing, \nfor  water \nconservation,  thereby  protecting  water  resources  and  enabling  the  postponement  of  costly \nsystem expansion. It also allows SuKanals and JSCs to locate distribution losses and to charge \nfor  water  consumption  on  the  basis  of  use\u2014generally  perceived  to  be  the  fairest  way  of \nallocating  the  costs  of  water  supply  to  users.  However,  most  water  consumers  and  water \nproduction  and  pumping  facilities  in  Azerbaijan  are  not  metered,  preventing  SuKanals  from \nproperly  planning,  charging  for,  and  measuring  their  operation.  The  Investment  Program  will \nprovide  water  meters  for  all  production,  distribution,  and  consumption,  thereby  creating  an \nessential  foundation  for  many  SuKanal  and  JSC  operations,  including  business  planning  and \n\nit  provides  an \n\nincentive \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fis  another \n\nPerformance  Benchmarking.  Performance  benchmarking \n\nmanagement, water loss reduction, efficient operation and maintenance, revenue collection, and \nperformance measurement and targeting. \n \n46. \nimportant \nmanagement  and  planning  tool  for  utility  management.  The  results  of  the  benchmarking \nprogram will help sector decision makers and SuKanal and/or JSC managers understand more \nprecisely WSS service performance, difficulties, and challenges, and compare performance with \nother  water  utilities  in  the  region,  country,  and  even  worldwide.  The  decision  makers  and \nmanagers  can  thus  come  up  with  more  relevant  decisions  and  actions  to  improve  sector \nmanagement and development, set realistic service targets, and strengthen the performance of \nSuKanals  and  JSCs.  Performance  benchmarking  is  also  essential  in  sector  regulation  and \nprovides  important  reference  information  for  setting  service  standards  and  reviewing  tariffs. \nHowever, performance benchmarking is not practiced in Azerbaijan, mainly because there are \nnot enough meters installed. Once meters are installed, the Investment Program will help each \nSuKanal develop and implement a simple benchmarking system with one or two indicators for \neach  key  performance  area  (i.e.,  technical,  financial,  institutional,  and  customer  services). \nTraining will be provided to build the capacity to collect, analyze, and compare the data as part \nof  ongoing  performance  monitoring.  This  process  of  performance  monitoring  will  help  set  the \nbasis for further reforms in the sector, including public\u2013private partnerships.  \n \nD. \n\nInvestment Plan \n\n47. \nSector  investment  needs  are  based  on  the  sector  development  road  map  and \ninvestment plan, which estimates the total sector needs at $3.5 billion by 2015 for 62 secondary \ntowns  and  rayon  centers.  Committed  financing  through  international  financial  institutions  is \n$1.235 billion, resulting in a shortfall of $2.310 billion. The Investment Program is estimated at \n$800 million equivalent (Table 1) and covers approximately 35% of the shortfall. The remaining \n65%  may  be  met  through  additional  resources  from  international  financial  institutions  and  the \nGovernment's  own  contribution.  Detailed  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan  for  the  tranche  1 \nproject are in Appendix 4. \n\n \nTable 1: Investment Program, 2009\u20132017a \n($ million) \n\nSector \nInvestment \nPlan \n2,264 \n\nInvestment Program Component \nA  Water Supply and Sanitation Infrastructure Development \nB   Management Capacity Development  \nC  Project Management Facility \n \nFinancing Sources \n \n \na     Last PFR submission under the Investment Program is expected in 2014.    \nb   These  figures  are  based  on  indicative  estimates  for  the  Investment  Program,  which  will  be  adjusted  based  on \n\n Asian Development Bank \nGovernment \n\n34.4 \n17.4 \n30.4 \n34.6 \n \n75 \n25 \n\n    Total Investment Program \n\n2,310 \n \n \n \n\n46 \n\nInvestment \nProgram \n778b \n 8b \n 14b \n800 \n \n600 \n200 \n\n% Share of \nInvestment \nPlan \n\ndetailed assessment during processing of each tranche.  \n\nSources:  Asian  Development  Bank;  Azersu  Joint  Stock  Company;  and  State  Amelioration  and  Water  Management \nAgency, Nakhchivan estimates. \n \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n48. \nADB  will  finance  the  Investment  Program  through  an  MFF,  in  an  amount  up  to  $600 \nmillion,  from  its  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  over  an  8-year  implementation  period.8 This \nrepresents 75% of the Investment Program\u2019s total cost. The loans will cover cost of civil works, \nequipment and material, institutional development and capacity building, land and resettlement, \nloan  financing  charges,  and  part  of  the  expenditures  for  consultancy  and  contingencies.  The \nGovernment  will  provide  counterpart  financing  to  cover  PMO  expenditures,  surveys  and \ninvestigation,  part  of  the  consulting  services  costs,  local  taxes  and  duties,  and  other \nmiscellaneous costs. The financing plan for the Investment Program and the tranche 1 project is \nin Table 2 and estimates for subsequent tranches in Table 3. \n \nThe MFF will consist of several loans to finance a range of projects under the Investment \n49. \nProgram,  subject  to  the  submission  of  related  PFRs  by  the  Government;  execution  of  related \nloan  agreements  (FFAs);  and  fulfillment  of  terms,  conditions,  and  undertakings  set  forth  in  a \nFFA  by  the  Government.  The  OCR  financing  will  follow  the  provisions  of  ordinary  operations \nloan  regulations  applicable  to  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  loans,  subject  to \nmodifications that may be included under individual loan agreements.  \n \n50. \nThe  Government  has  submitted  to  ADB  the  PFR  for  tranche  1,  requesting  a  loan  of \n$75 million from ADB\u2019s OCR to help finance the tranche 1 project. The loan will have a 24-year \nterm, including a grace period of 4 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement. The Government has provided ADB with \n(i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis \nof  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The \nGovernment  will  relend  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  to  AZERSU  ($47  million)  and  SAWMA  ($28 \nmillion)  on  the  same  financial  terms  and  conditions  as  those  of  the  ADB  loans.  The  minimum \namount of subsequent PFRs will be $75 million. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nInvestment Program \nAmount \n600.0 \n200.0 \n800.0 \n\n% \n75 \n25 \n100 \n\n \n\nTranche 1 \n\nAmount \n75.0 \n25.0 \n100.0 \n\n% \n75 \n25 \n100 \n\n \nSource  \nADB Ordinary Capital Resources \nGovernment  \nTotal \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nTable 3: Indicative Financing Plan by Tranche \n($ million) \n\nSource \n\nADB \n\nGovernment \n\nTranche 1  Tranche 2  Tranche 3 Tranche 4\n\nTranche 5 \n\nTotal \n\n75.0 \n\n25.0 \n\n170.0 \n\n 56.7 \n\n180.0 \n\n 60.0 \n\n 240.0 \n\n100.0 \n\n 33.3 \n\n 133.3 \n\n 75.0 \n\n 25.0 \n\n 100.0 \n\n600.0 \n\n200.0 \n\n800.0 \n\n% \n\n75.0 \n\n25.0 \n\n100.0 \n\nTotal \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. estimates \n\n100.0 \n\n226.7 \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2008.

Progress  toward  the \nexpected  outcomes  as  set  out  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  will  be  part  of  the \ndecision-making criteria and filters for continuing ADB support. Satisfactory compliance with the \nsafeguards requirements and social development policies, as well as with all other undertakings \nset  forth  in  the  FFA,  will  also  guide  ADB\u2019s  decision  to  continue  financing  under  individual \ntranches. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nInvestment  Program \n\n1. \n\nInvestment Program Management \n\n52. \nAZERSU will be the EA for all project activities except those in Nakhchivan Autonomous \nRepublic,  where  SAWMA  will  be  the  EA.  The PMOs  created  at  AZERSU  and  SAWMA  will  be \nresponsible  for  supporting  project  implementation.  Each  PMO  will  comprise  international  and \nnational consultants to be engaged through international firms and individuals, and counterpart \nstaff.  The  EAs  will  maintain  their  respective  PMO  counterpart  staff  with  at  least  a  program \ndirector  and/or  contract  management  specialist,  a  financial  management  and/or  disbursement \nspecialist,  a  WSS  and/or  monitoring  and  evaluation  specialist,  and  a  safeguards  expert.  The \nPMOs  will  (i)  submit  PFRs;  (ii)  undertake  due  diligence  for  subsequent  projects;  (iii)  prepare \ndetailed design for future investments; (iv) supervise procurement and construction; (v) oversee \nsafeguards  and  gender  compliance;  (vi)  coordinate  among  rayon  agencies;  (vii)  monitor  and \nevaluate program progress and prepare progress reports; and (viii) provide expertise in project \nmanagement, planning, results measurement, and training. Sukanals and JSCs in participating \nrayons  will  designate  a  qualified  implementation  team  to  work  with  the  PMO  during  program \nimplementation. Such team will include at least 1 water supply engineer, 1 sewage specialist, 3 \nfield inspectors, and 2 electromechanical technicians. The PMOs will provide hands-on training \nto staff during each stage of program implementation. To further ensure sustainable operation of \nWSS  services,  SuKanals  and  JSCs  will  be  trained  through  a  twinning  arrangement  with  an \nexternal WSS company. The structure of the PMO and the lines of communication are shown in \nAppendix 5, Figures A5.1 and A5.2.  \n \n53. \nloan effectiveness. \n(i) \n\nIn  support  of  the  Investment  Program,  2  committees  will  be  set  up  within  3  months  of \n\nA  program  steering  committee  (PSC)  will  be  established  by  the  cabinet  of \nministers.  It  will  be  headed  by  a  high-level  official  from  the  cabinet  of  ministers \nand composed of officials from AZERSU, the Ministry of Economic Development, \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance,  the  Ministry  of  Health,  SAWMA,  and  heads  of  related \nrayon  administrations.  The  committee  will  provide  general  policy  and  strategic \noversight, resolve interagency problems, and oversee progress of projects. It will \nalso decide on subsequent PFRs and evaluate implementation of the Investment \nProgram  based  on  the  design  and  monitoring  framework.  It  will  meet  at  least \nonce every 3 months, and share the minutes of its meetings with ADB. \nAt  the  operational  level,  a  project  implementation  review  committee  (PIRC)  will \nbe established by the administration for each participating rayon, chaired by the \nhead  of  the  rayon  administration  and  comprising  officials  from  SuKanals  and \nJSCs,  TWUAs,  and  related  program  management  facility  consultants.  These \ncommittees  will  review  monthly  implementation  progress  and  ensure  timely \nresolution  of  operational  issues.  Any  unresolved  issue  may  be  referred  to  the \nrelevant EA or the project steering committee for action.  \n\n(ii)  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule and Period \n\n54. \nThe overall implementation period for the Investment Program is 8 years from November \n2009  to  May  2018.  The  projects  for  the  first  two  tranches  will  mainly  comprise  subproject \nactivities in Goychay, Nakhchivan, and Agdash. The subproject activities have been selected on \nthe  basis  of  their  relative  priority  under  the  Investment  Program  and  their  readiness  for \nimplementation.  Subsequent  tranches  will  be  sequenced  based  on  (i)  their  state  of  readiness, \nand  (ii)  the  compliance  level  with  the  reform  milestones  set  out  in  the  sector  road  map \n(Appendix 2). The implementation schedule of the Investment Program is in Appendix 6. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n55. \nProcurement  financed  from  the  loans  under  the  MFF  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  International \ncompetitive bidding procedures will be followed for civil works contracts estimated at $3 million \nor more. Civil works contracts estimated at less than $3 million will be procured under national \ncompetitive bidding procedures. Single-stage, one-envelope bidding procedure will be adopted \nfor all civil works contracts under the Investment Program. Appendix 7 contains a procurement \nplan and main contract packages under the first tranche.  \n \n56. \nInternational competitive bidding procedures will be used to procure goods and services \nestimated  to  cost  $1  million  or  more.  National  competitive  bidding  procedures  will  be  followed \nfor  procurement  of  goods  and  services  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $1  million.  For  specialized \nequipment,  such  as  proprietary  software  and  small  materials  contracts  valued  at  less  than \n$100,000, ADB\u2019s shopping procedures may be followed.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n57. \nConsultants will be recruited using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection procedures \nand/or  individual  consultant  selection  procedures  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). One consultancy firm selected under each \ntranche  for  the  two  program  management  facilities,  one  each  at  AZERSU  and  SAWMA,  will \ndesignate  a  separate  team  for  each  EA.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  program \nmanagement facility consultants are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n58. \nUnder each tranche, ADB may, subject to its policies and procedures, allow on request: \n(i)  advance  contracting;  and  (ii)  retroactive  financing  of  eligible  expenditures  up  to  20%  of  the \nproposed  individual  loan,  incurred  prior  to  loan  effectiveness  but  not  earlier  than  12  months \nbefore the date of signing of the related legal agreement. The Government acknowledges that \nany  approval  of  advance  contracting  and/or  retroactive  financing  will  not  constitute  a \ncommitment by ADB to finance the related project. \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy and Governance Measures \n\n59. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government,  AZERSU,  and  SAWMA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\fInvestment  Program.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy  are  included  in  loan  regulations  and  bidding  documents  for  the  Investment  Program.  In \nparticular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Investment  Program  shall \ninclude provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of \nAZERSU,  SAWMA,  participating  SuKanals  and  JSCs,  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Investment Program. \n \n60. \nThe financial management capacity of AZERSU and SAWMA to be strengthened under \nthe  Investment  Program  is  expected  to  mitigate  the  risks  of  corruption  under  the  Investment \nProgram.  The  comprehensive  public  sector  reforms  and  institutional  development  program  is \nintended  to  increase  public  accountability  of  AZERSU,  SAWMA,  SuKanals,  and  JSCs,  and  to \nreduce the risk of corruption. AZERSU and SAWMA will ensure that (i) anticorruption provisions \nacceptable  to  ADB  are  included  in  all  bidding  documents  and  contracts,  including  provisions \nspecifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  AZERSU, \nSAWMA,  relevant  SuKanals  and  JSCs,  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other \nservice providers as they relate to the activities carried out under the Investment Program; (ii) all \ndecisions  relating  to  procurement  are  made  by  the  Tendering  Committee  that  comprises \nrepresentatives  of  the  Ministry  of  Economic  Development,  Ministry  of  Finance,  State \nProcurement  Agency  (as  observer),  and  other  relevant  agencies  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines; and (iii) the supervision consultant verifies the contractors\u2019 invoices in \naccordance with working drawings and contract specifications.  \n \n61. \nAZERSU  and  SAWMA  agreed  to  take  additional  measures  to  improve  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  including  (i)  independent  external  auditing  of  contracts, \naccounts,  and  financial  statements;  and  (ii)  timely  disclosure  of  information  on  selection  of \nconsultants  and  contractors  through  local  newspapers.  Regarding  financial  management,  the \nInvestment  Program  will  support  the  development  of  AZERSU  and  SAWMA's  accounting \nsystems  and  publication  of \nIn  strengthening \ntransparency,  AZERSU  and  SAWMA  will  disclose  basic  information  concerning  activities  and \nprogress of the Investment Program on their respective websites, including procurement-related \ninformation,  financial  statements,  and  physical  progress.  AZERSU  and  SAWMA  have  also \nagreed to establish a web-based public grievance redress system that can be used for handling \ngrievances  related  to  the  Investment  Program.  Regarding  the  procurement  of  international \ncompetitive  bidding  contracts,  the  websites  of  AZERSU  and  SAWMA  will  disclose  lists  of \nparticipating  bidders,  names  of  winning  bidders,  basic  details  of  the  bidding  procedures \nadopted, contract values, and lists of goods and services procured.  \n \n\ntheir  websites. \n\ninformation  on \n\nfinancial \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n62. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Additional  disbursement  arrangements  may \nbe set forth in the loan agreements.  \n \n63. \nTo  ensure  timely  release  of  loan  proceeds  and  expedite  project  implementation, \nimmediately after the effectiveness of each tranche, an imprest account will be established for \neach executing agency at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB to cover eligible expenditures \nunder  the  Investment  Program.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  established,  managed, \nreplenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and \nagreed detailed arrangements. The initial amount to be deposited into each imprest account will \nnot exceed the lower of (i) the estimated expenditure to be financed from the imprest account \nfor AZERSU or SAWMA for the initial 6 months of project implementation; or (ii) the equivalent \n\n14 \n\n \n\n\fthe \n\nrespective \n\nloan  amounts \n\nto  AZERSU  or  SAWMA.  The  \nof  10%  of \nstatement-of-expenditures  procedure  may  be  used  for  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures \nfor  the  Investment  Program  and  to  liquidate  advances  provided  to  the  imprest  accounts.  Any \npayment to be reimbursed or liquidated under the statement-of-expenditures procedure will not \nexceed  $100,000.  The  loan  proceeds  may  also  be  disbursed  directly  to  the  consultants  and \ncontractors under the direct payment procedure. \n \n\nrelent \n\n8. \n\nAccounts, Records, and Audits \n\n64. \nAZERSU and SAWMA will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify \nfinancing resources received and expenditures made under the MFF, including expenditures for \nworks,  equipment,  and  services  financed  out  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  local  funds.  Both \nAZERSU and SAWMA will have a full set of financial statements. These project accounts and \nrelated  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing \nstandards and by auditors acceptable to ADB. AZERSU and SAWMA will submit annual audited \nreports  (including  separate  audit  opinions  on  use  of \nthe  \nstatement-of-expenditure procedures) and audited financial statements to ADB within 6 months \nafter the end of each fiscal year. \n \n\nimprest  account  and \n\nthe \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nframework, \n\n65. \nAZERSU  and  SAWMA,  through  their  respective  PMOs,  will  establish  an  investment \nprogram  performance  monitoring  system  acceptable  to  ADB  within  3  months  of  the \neffectiveness of the first loan under the MFF. These systems will help monitor and evaluate the \nperformance  of  the  Investment  Program  and  projects  under  each  loan  of  the  MFF.  It  will \nincorporate a set of performance monitoring indicators relating to outputs and outcomes in the \ndesign  and  monitoring \nincluding  service  delivery  performance,  physical \nimplementation, management improvement, and capacity development milestones. The PMOs \nwill  develop  baseline  data  for  each  of  the  selected  indicators,  conduct  annual  surveys,  and \nupdate  ADB  on  the  progress  against  each  indicator.  For  project  activities  procured  under  the \nturnkey  and  design\u2013build\u2013operate  modalities  planned  following  the  tranche  1  project,  key \nperformance indicators satisfactory to ADB will be developed during the preparation of requests \nfor proposals and draft contract documents for such project activities. \n \n66. \n The PMO of AZERSU and SAWMA will prepare annual reports on the progress against \nthe above performance monitoring indicators, to be  submitted to ADB within 30 days after the \nreview  period.  The  reports  will  incorporate  the  information  provided  by  relevant  SuKanals  and \nJSCs.9 The  reports  will  discuss  progress  made  during  the  period  of  review,  changes if  any  on \nimplementation schedule, problems or difficulties encountered and remedial actions taken, and \nwork to be undertaken in the coming quarter.  \n \n\n10. \n\nInvestment Program Review  \n\n67. \nThe  Government,  AZERSU,  SAWMA,  and  ADB  will  jointly  review  implementation \nprogress  of  the  Investment  Program  twice  yearly.  The  review  will  discuss  performance  of  the \ncomponents under each project and any changes to implementation arrangements or remedial \nmeasures needing to be undertaken toward achieving the objectives of project components and \nthe overall Investment Program.  \n\n                                                 \n9  These targets will be reflected in each sukanal and/or JSC annual work plan and budget, and serve as the basis for \n\nmonitoring progress. \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f \n68. \nA  more  comprehensive  review  at  the  midterm  of  each  project  will  (i)  evaluate  the \nproject\u2019s  scope,  design,  and  implementation  arrangements;  (ii) evaluate  the  progress  of \ncomponents A, B, and C; (iii) evaluate the performance of the program management facility; (iv) \nidentify  changes  needed  in  any  or  all  of  the  above  areas;  (v)  assess  the  implementation \nperformance  against  agreed  targets  in  the  respective  design  and  monitoring  frameworks;  (vi) \nidentify  critical  issues  and  constraints,  if  any;  and  (vii)  recommend  adjustments  to  the  project \ndesign  and/or  implementation  arrangements,  if  necessary.  Such  midterm  reviews  will  also \nconduct  performance  assessments  of  previous  projects  to  evaluate  the  achievement  of \nexpected  development  impacts.  A  similar  midterm  review  of  the  Investment  Program  will  be \nundertaken in the fifth year from the date of ADB\u2019s approval of the MFF.  \n \nAZERSU and SAWMA will submit to ADB a project completion report (for each individual \n69. \nproject)  and  a  completion  report  for  the  Investment  Program  within  3  months  of  their  physical \ncompletion.  These  reports  will  provide  detailed  evaluation  of  the  projects  (to  the  extent \napplicable  to  AZERSU  and  SAWMA,  respectively),  including  the  (i)  design;  (ii)  costs;  (iii) \ncontractor  and  consultant  performance;  (iv)  social,  environmental,  and  economic  impacts;  (v) \neconomic rate of return; and (vi) other details for each project and the Investment Program, as \nmay be requested by ADB. \n \n\nIV. \n\nINVESTMENT PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial Analyses \n\nThe  economic  and  financial  analysis  was  carried  out  on  the  tranche  1  project.  For  the \n70. \nfinancial  analysis,  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  was  estimated  at  2.47%,  the  financial \ninternal  rate  of  return  in  the  base  case  ranged  between  4.5%  and  5.5%,  and  the  financial  net \npresent  value  in  the  base  case  ranged  from  $14.9  million  to  $15.0  million.  The  economic \nanalysis  indicates  that  the  project  is  economically  viable,  with  the  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn  (EIRR)  exceeding  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  in  all  cases.  The  economic \nopportunity  cost  of  capital  was  assumed  at  12%,  the  EIRRs  in  the  base  case  range  between \n18.0%  and  20.8%,  and  the  economic  net  present  value  in  the  base  case  ranged  from  $7.55 \nmillion to $7.63 million. The resulting benefit\u2013cost ratios for the tranche 1 project range between \n1.38  and  1.54,  also  denoting  feasibility.  Economic  benefits  were  derived  from  analysis  of \nwillingness-to-pay surveys. Sensitivity analysis conducted to test the robustness of the financial \nsustainability and economic viability of subcomponents when subject to change (a 20% increase \nin capital cost, 20% increase in operation and maintenance cost, 20% reduction in benefits, and \n1-year  delay  in  benefits)  indicate  that,  in  all  cases,  subcomponent  financial  internal  rates  of \nreturn  surpass  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,  and  EIRRs  surpass  the  economic \nopportunity cost of capital. Details of the economic and financial analyses are in Appendixes 8 \nand 9, and in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n71. \nAssessment of financial sustainability and economic viability suggests that the integrated \nbenefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs.  For  higher  financial  and  economic \nreturns, the planned coverage needs to be achieved and a smooth transition undertaken from \ncompletion  of  works  to  operation.  Analysis  findings  indicate  that  the  tranche  1  project  is \nfinancially  viable  on  two  measures:  (i)  required  periodic  tariff  increases  (herewith  assumed \nevery  2  years),  and  (ii)  providing  viability  gap  funding  based  on  cost  recovery  with  regard  to \nconsumer  affordability.  For  these  measures  to  be  relevant  to  succeeding  subcomponents  in \nsubsequent  tranches,  they  would  be  incorporated  when  preparing  subcomponent  financial \noperational plans. These plans and related issues have been discussed and agreed to with the \n\n16 \n\n \n\n\fEAs  for  achieving  financial  sustainability  of  the  overall  investment.  Issues  pertaining  to \nsubsidization,  manner  of  implementation,  and  funds  sourcing  are  specifically  relevant. \nAffordability  is  a  major  factor  in  determining  the  subsidy  requirement,  and  thus  household \nincome bases may need to be reviewed periodically. There is an ongoing effort by the JSCs for \nimproved tariff collection by focusing on better service delivery and registering complaints.  \n \nB. \n\nFinancial Management Assessment \n\nThe  financial  management  assessment  of  AZERSU  and  SAWMA  (Supplementary \n72. \nAppendix  E)  confirmed  that  the  financial  management,  reporting,  and  monitoring  systems \npractices are satisfactory, with low to moderate risk to ADB and other financiers. The EAs are \nadequately staffed with efficient and experienced personnel. Project staff members are trained \nin  procedural  requirements  of  ADB  and  national  accounting  standards.  Systems  and  controls, \nincluding  accounting  and  financial  reporting,  auditing,  internal  control,  fund  disbursement  and \nflows, and information systems, comply with good operating practices and meet the Investment \nProgram's  financial  management  requirement.  Fund  flows  from  ongoing  projects  and  local \nsources  are  satisfactory,  with  special  accounts  and  fund-flow  procedures  established  for  each \nproject. Improved financial performance monitoring systems under the Investment Program will \nmitigate delays in release of counterpart funds and existing weakness in information exchange \nbetween  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies.  Project  external  audit  arrangements  are \nsatisfactory  and  follow  international  auditing  standards.  The  management  improvement  and \ncapacity development component under the Investment Program will substantially improve staff \ncapacity in adopting prudent financial management practices.  \n \nC. \n\nSummary of Benefits, Poverty Reduction, and Social Development \n\n73. \nThe  Investment  Program  will  provide  an  estimated  500,000  persons  with  safe, \naffordable,  and  reliable  piped  water  supplies  in  addition  to  dependable  wastewater  collection \nand  treatment  services.  The  Investment  Program  will  also  enhance  institutional  capacities  for \nthe  repair  and  management  of  the  water  and  wastewater  systems.  Residents  of  secondary \ntowns  within  Azerbaijan  and  the  Nakhchivan  Autonomous  Republic  will  enjoy  the  benefits  of \nenhanced  living  conditions  and  improved  health  as  their  basic  water  and  wastewater  services \nare  upgraded  and  access  to  them  is  expanded.  Benefits  from  the  first  tranche  include  (i)  an \nestimated  34,200  new  or  rehabilitated  water  supply  connections  with  a  24-hour  continuous \nservice;  (ii)  a  65%  increase  in  availability  of  treated  water;  (iii)  rehabilitation  of  drainage  and \nsewage systems; and (iv) sewage collection capacity to handle 100% of the waste generation in \neach  of  the  participating  towns.  Table  4  highlights  selected  tranche  1  project  benefits.  Less \ntangible  benefits  include  (i)  improved  tariff  collection,  financial  planning,  and  information \nsystems  (including  system  maps  and  inventories,  the  building  blocks  for  good  utility \nmanagement);  (ii)  greater  customer  orientation  and  more  informed,  responsible  consumers \n(particularly  via  the  TWUAs  to  be  created);  and  (iii)  increased  performance  as  AZERSU, \nSAWMA,  SuKanal,  and  JSC  operational  staff  gain  the  necessary  safety  training,  physical \nresources, and technical supervision to do their jobs well.  \n \n\nTable 4: Tranche 1 Project Benefits  \n\nItem \nHouseholds with Piped Connections (%) \nNumber Households with Potable Water > 24 hours day \nTreated Water Availability (cubic meters per day) \nWastewater Collected (%) \n\n2008\u20132009 \n35 \nnone \nnone \n15 \n\n2010\u20132017 \n\n100 \n34,200 \n19,500 \n100 \n\n      Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n74. \nThe  summary  poverty  reduction  and  strategy  in  Appendix  10  highlights  that  many \nhouseholds in secondary towns have low incomes, and approximately 65% of the existing town \npopulation  has  no  formal  connection  to  piped  networks.  The  Investment  Program  will  support \nthe  development  of  service  delivery  strategies  for  low-income  consumers,  which  can  include \nreducing  barriers  to  connection,  using  small-scale  service  providers,  adopting  pro-poor  tariffs, \ntargeting customer outreach, and other innovative approaches. \n \nGender. Improvements in the quality, coverage, and reliability of WSS systems will have \n75. \na  particularly  positive  impact  on  women.  As  women  are  the  main  collectors  of  water  in \nhouseholds without individual connections, gender concerns will be mainstreamed in the public \noutreach  programs,  consultations,  customer  complaint  mechanisms,  and  public  accountability \nmeasures  taken  to  promote  transparency.  In  line  with  the  state  program  (footnote  1),  which \nrequires promotion and protection of gender equality in all sectors, the Investment Program will \naddress  gender  issues  by  (i)  strengthening  the  role  of  female  representatives  in  sector \nmanagement,  (ii)  developing  women\u2019s  roles  at  the  community  level,  (iii)  collecting  gender-\ndisaggregated survey data to develop gender-sensitive social and economic indicators, and (iv) \nconducting monitoring and evaluation to assess gender impacts so appropriate gender planning \ncan be addressed in subsequent tranche designs. The gender action plan gives further details \non how the Investment Program will mainstream gender concerns to promote the inclusion and \nempowerment of women (Appendix 11 and Supplementary Appendix F).  \n  \nD. \n\nSocial and Environmental Safeguards  \n\nSocial  Safeguards.  The  tranche  1  project  will  not  have  any  land  acquisition  and \n76. \nresettlement  impacts  as  documented  in  the  due  diligence  report  prepared  for  each  town \n(Supplementary Appendix J). The Investment Program has generally avoided such impacts by \nchoosing  appropriate  design  options  and  by  prioritizing  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of \nexisting facilities. New construction, to the extent feasible, will be done on unused land already \nowned  by  the  Government.  However,  for  any  potential  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  the \nInvestment Program will finance the cost to expedite implementation.  \n \nTo  address  potential  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  issues  associated  with  the \n77. \nfollowing  tranches,  a  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  applicable  laws  and \nregulations of Azerbaijan. The framework describes general principles, the land acquisition and \nresettlement  process,  compensation  and  assistance  measures  for  affected  people,  and \ninstitutional arrangements. Project-specific land acquisition and resettlement plans or measures \nwill also be prepared for individual tranches. The framework is applicable to all tranches but will \nbe  reviewed  and  updated  if  necessary  at  the  beginning  of  each  tranche.  The  summary  land \nacquisition and resettlement framework is given in Appendix 12.  \n \n78. \nThe  Investment  Program  is  not  expected  to  affect  indigenous  people  as  defined  under \nADB's  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998). Upon  effectiveness  of  the  ADB  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) in January 2010, safeguards requirements under that policy will apply in place \nof the Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), the Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) and the \nEnvironment Policy (2002).10  \n \n\n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2009. Safeguard Policy Statement. Manila (para. 81). \n\n \n\n\fEnvironmental  Safeguards.  The  provision  of  potable  piped-water  supply  and \n79. \nwastewater  collection  and  treatment  will  improve  the  environment  in  each  participating  town. \nThe  designs  involve  simple,  appropriate,  low-cost  technology  and  do  not  pose  any  significant \nadverse environmental consequences. The tranche 1 project has been categorized as B under \nADB's Environment Policy (2002). Potential negative environmental impacts for each project are \nmainly  short  term  during  the  construction  period  and  can  be  minimized  by  the  proposed \nmitigation  measures  and  environmentally  sound  engineering  and  construction  practices.  An \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework,  prepared  following  ADB  procedures \n(Appendix  13  and  Supplementary  Appendix  G),  follows  the  environmental  assessment  and \nreview  procedures  in  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003).  The  EAs  will \nprepare initial environmental examinations for each project, as appropriate. The examination for \nthe  tranche  1  project  shows  no  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  (Appendix  14  and \nSupplementary Appendix H). As these examinations, including environment management plans, \nwere  prepared  based  on  field  reconnaissance  survey  and  secondary  reports,  they  will  be \nupdated during the detailed engineering design stage. The design and environment consultant \nwill prepare contract-level and site-specific plans based on the updated and final environmental \nmanagement  plan.  This  will  form  the  basis  for  issuance  of  bidding  documents,  and  the \nenvironmental requirements will be reflected in the contractors' contracts. The contract-level and \nsite-specific environmental management plan will guide the contractors during construction and \nwill also assist the supervision consultant in tracking the contractors' implementation progress.  \n \n80. \nEnvironmental project selection criteria ensure that the Investment Program will not have \nsignificant negative environmental impacts and will have no impact on environmentally sensitive \nareas.  Impacts  that  are  potentially  significant  and/or  irreversible  will  be  avoided.  Potential \nnegative  environmental  impacts  of  typical  projects  are  expected  to  be  mostly  localized  and \ntemporary. These impacts can largely be avoided through proper project design (particularly site \nselection), through proper source abstraction designs, and through appropriate choice of water \nand wastewater treatment technologies and process design parameters. Alternatively, they can \nbe  mitigated  through  proper  implementation  of  mitigation  measures  and  environmental \nmanagement.  The  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework  will  help  ensure \ncompliance  with  applicable  government  and  ADB  environmental  requirements  and  guide  the \ndesign and implementation of future subprojects. The environmental team within each PMO will \ninclude  an  environmental  and  social  safeguard  specialist  who,  with  assistance  from  an \ninternational  environmental  consultant,  will  apply  and  enforce  the  environmental  assessment \nand  review  framework.  Training  will  be  conducted  by  the  international  consultants  to  pertinent \nenvironmental group staff within AZERSU, SAWMA, SuKanals, and JSCs. Separate training by \nvarious  outside  specialists  will  also  be  provided  for  operational  staff  on  the  operation  and \nmaintenance of water, wastewater, and metering systems. \n \nE. \n\nAssumptions and Potential Risks \n\nThe  Investment  Program  faces  several  implementation  risks.  The  following  key  risks \n\n81. \nhave been discussed with the Government and mitigation measures agreed.  \n \nPotential  Shortfall  in  Contractors.  The  Government  has  recently  signed  two  large \n82. \nprojects  with  the  World  Bank  for  WSS  in  43  towns  and  with  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency for 10 towns. With the commencement of the Investment Program, severe shortage of \ncivil works contractors is expected,  which may  delay implementation. To mitigate  this risk, the \nInvestment  Program  includes  (i)  large  international  competitive  bidding  contracts  to  attract \ninternational contracting firms; (ii) advance procurement actions, already undertaken, to ensure \nthat  works  are  commenced  shortly  after  loan  approval;  and  (iii)  incentive  provisions  in  the \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\fcontractors'  contracts  to  expedite  implementation  and,  by  timely  completion,  enable  the \ncontractors to apply for new contracts under the Investment Program. \n \n83. \nLimited  Executing  Agency  Capacity.  AZERSU  and  SAWMA  are  also  the  EAs  for  all \nother  donor-funded  projects.  They  lack  the  capacity  to  administer  a  large  portfolio  of  existing \nmultimillion-dollar  projects.  Therefore,  implementation  is  likely  to  suffer  and  to  experience \ndelays. To mitigate this risk, the Investment Program includes program management facilities, \ncomprising  teams  of  international  and  national  consultants,  who  will  provide  technical  and \nmanagement support to the EAs.  \n \n84. \nLack  of  Executing  Agency  Autonomy.  At  present,  AZERSU  and  SAWMA  are \nconstrained  on  making  independent  decisions  on  SuKana  and  JSC  staffing;  procurement  of \nworks, goods, and services; and financial transactions. This may result in implementation delays \nand restrict much-needed capacity development of SuKanals and JSCs. The Government has \ncommitted  to  streamlining  the  approval  process  by  allowing  more  autonomy  to  AZERSU  and \nSAWMA for implementing the Investment Program.  \n \n85. \nLack  of  Beneficiary  Participation.  The  EAs\u2019  inability  to  reach  out  to  the  community, \ncreate awareness, and elicit support may create customer dissatisfaction, lack of their support \nduring implementation, and hence delay implementation of the Investment Program. This risk is \nmitigated through a well-designed public outreach program that will ensure that beneficiaries are \neducated on the benefits and provide adequate support during implementation.  \n \n86. \nPoor  Maintenance  of  Assets  after  Completion. Lack of EAs\u2019 foresight and long-term \ncommitment to build SuKanal and JSC staff capacity on technical, financial, and administrative \nmatters is likely to affect the quality of service delivery. This risk is mitigated through program \nmanagement facility input and a twinning program designed to guide SuKanal and JSC staff in \nasset maintenance, financial management, and service delivery. \n \n\nV. \n\nUNDERTAKINGS AND ASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nUndertakings \n\n87. \nincorporated in the FFA: \n\nThe Government has agreed to the following undertakings for the MFF which have been \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nensure timely implementation of the Investment Program, including (a) executing \nthe  implementing  arrangements  set  out  in  the  FFA;

To meet the ever-growing demand for water, the state program provides the \nfollowing guidelines:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nEnsure that the potable water supply to the population conforms to international \nstandards.  \nEncourage  the  overall  development  of  the  WSS  sector  with  AZERSU  taking \nactions  to  construct  new  facilities  using  state-guaranteed  loans;  completing  the \nOghuz\u2013Gabala\u2013Baku  pipeline;  and  refurbishing  older  water  pipelines,  tanks, \npumping  stations,  distribution  networks,  in-building  water  systems,  and  sewage \ntreatment facilities in Baku. \nAchieve 100% consumer fee collection for water provision over the state program \nperiod.  \nContinue  ongoing  restructuring  works  to  attract  greater  investment  in  the  WSS \nsector,  and  ensure  uninterrupted  service  corresponding \ninternational \nstandards. \nEngage  the  private  sector  and  municipalities  in  creating  infrastructure  and \ndelivering services. \n\nto \n\n \n3. \nSustainable  Environmental  Management.  The  state  program  provides  directions  to \nresolve environmental deterioration and improve its management. Priority directions include (i) \nsustainable  management  of  water  resources;  (ii)  comprehensive  waste  management;  (iii) \nimprovement  of  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks,  monitoring  systems,  and  environmental \nmanagement resources; and (iv) increasing environmental education and awareness. \n \nOn  gender  development,  the  state  program  states  that  empowering  women  and \n4. \nreducing  gender  inequality  is  not  only  a  goal,  but  also  a  tool  of  economic  development  and \npoverty reduction. Therefore, in all sectors, attention has been paid to the way in which the state \nprogram affects the rights and opportunities of both men and women. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Government  of  Azerbaijan.  2008.  State  Program  on  Poverty  Reduction  and  Sustainable  Development  for  2006\u2013\n\n2015 Baku. \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nThe multitranche financing facility (MFF) for the Water Supply and Sanitation Investment \n5. \nProgram (the Investment Program) affords the scope for a programmatic, long-term approach to \nthe development of basic urban infrastructure in Azerbaijan\u2019s secondary towns guided by road \nmaps for critical sector and institutional reforms. Notably, the MFF  modality (i) establishes the \nfoundation for an 8-year partnership between the Government and the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB),  (ii)  combines  interrelated  physical  and  nonphysical  investments,  (iii)  allows  for \ninvestments to be sequenced, and (iv) is supported by a sector road and policy framework. \n\n3. \n\nDevelopmental Challenges  \n\n6. \nGrowth and Poverty Reduction. Azerbaijan is one of fastest growing economies in the \nworld. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 20.2% in 2004\u20132008, supported by \nsurging crude oil production and exports. The gross national product per capita rose to $6,142 \nin 2008 from $390 per capita in 1995. This rapid growth is mainly attributed to developments in \nthe  oil  industry,  which  accounts  for  almost  one  third  of  Azerbaijan\u2019s  GDP.  Oil  sector  growth \nspurred growth in transport, communications, and services. On the production side, growth was \nled  by  construction,  services,  and  agriculture.  Construction  output  expanded  by  12%  in  2008 \nlargely  in  secondary  towns  and  rural  areas,  residential  and  office  centers  across  the  country, \nand transport. Non-oil GDP grew at almost 16% in 2008, the highest rate of growth in the past 5 \nyears.  \n \n7. \nUnsurprisingly,  Azerbaijan\u2019s  growth  prospects  are  closely  linked  to  oil  prices.  GDP \ngrowth  is  projected  to  fall  to  8.0%  in  2009  and  further  to  6.7%  in  2010,  reflecting  relatively \nmodest growth in the hydrocarbon sector. Growth in crude oil and natural gas exports will also \nslow.  With  foreign  investments  declining  in  the  oil  sector,  public  investment  will  become  the \nsingle  largest  source  of  growth  over  the  medium  term,  accounting  for  about  60%  of  total \ninvestments.  In  2009,  public  spending  expansion  will  moderate  to  around  15%  versus  an \naverage  of  65%  in  the  past  3 years.  Of  concern  is  the  likelihood  that  direct  transfers  from  the \nState Oil Fund of Azerbaijan Republic will become the key source revenues for the state budget \nin 2009, and it is likely that this fund will be the largest nontax contributor for annual budgetary \nexpenditure.  \n \nThe  Government  seeks  to  build  upon  the  opportunities  provided  by  its  oil  revenue,  as \n8. \nwell as to put in place measures that will ensure growth in the non-oil economy to ensure that \nthe full benefits of economic growth reach all sectors and segments of society. Although it will \nreduce  fiscal  spending  over  the  medium  term,  the  Government  will  expand  capital  investment \nmoderately and restructure expenditures in the basic urban and social sectors.  \n \n9. \nPoverty levels have declined from an estimated 49% of the country\u2019s population in 2001 \nto about 13.2% in 2009. Poverty is higher in urban areas. Baku has the highest number of poor \npeople,  but  secondary  towns  have  higher  incidences  of  poverty.  Rural  areas  and  small  towns \nsuffer the most from unreliable supplies of energy, water, and gas, and they often lack access to \nbasic  education  and  health  services.  The  existing  WSS  services  have  seriously  impaired  the \npoor as (i) they spend more time collecting mostly unsafe water at the expense of working; and \n(ii) they must obtain smaller quantities of water from vendors, often paying 10 times above what \nhigh-income households pay.  \n \n10. \nTechnical  State  of  Sector  Assets.  Following  the  dissolution  of  the  Soviet  Union,  the \nquality and efficiency of water service delivery declined in Azerbaijan due to poor management \nand  inadequate  investment.  The  existing  WSS  systems  are  over  50  years  old.  Water  supply \nsources are in a poor state of repair, and other modes of supply (e.g., through private vendors) \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n33 \n\nare expensive and/or unreliable. Water treatment facilities in many secondary towns are either \nabsent  or  largely  dysfunctional,  and  distribution  networks  are  inappropriately  sized  and \ndilapidated.  Despite  an  83%  piped-network  coverage  in  secondary  towns,  the  majority  of \nresidents  do  not  have  access  to  safe  drinking  water.  Unaccounted-for  water  is  difficult  to \nestimate,  because  there  have  been  no  realistic  assessments.  Engineering  drawings  of  the \ndistribution systems are rare, which make maintenance and repairs difficult. Service levels vary \nfrom town to town. The latest municipal services survey2 carried out across the country in 2003 \nrevealed that at least 81% of urban households and over 90% of the households in major cities \nhad house water connections. In smaller secondary towns, more than 75% households relied on \nwells and private water vendors. \n \n11. \nThe sewerage system is in even worse condition. Only 55% of Azerbaijan\u2019s population \nhas access to improved sanitation facilities. Access in urban areas is higher than in rural areas, \nwith  coverage  estimated  at  73%  and  36%,  respectively.3 The  sewage  network  in  Baku  serves \nabout 78% of the population,4 while sewage coverage in other urban areas is about 32%. Pipes \nare  broken  or  clogged  with  silt  and  debris,  and  wastewater  is  discharged  into  ditches  or  the \nnearest watercourses. Poor sanitation and leaking sewers are creating serious health risks and \nenvironmental hazards.  \n \n12. \nLevel  and  Quality  of  Sector  Services.  Water  supply  is  intermittent  and  of  limited \nquantity.  The  water  quality  is  poor,  with  high  levels  of  silt.  Many  consumers  buy  water  from \nprivate vendors to augment their supply. Sewerage systems are failing, and pipes are clogged \nand  broken.  During  heavy  rains,  raw  sewage  floods  the  streets  and  house  compounds,  and \nexisting  treatment  facilities  do  not  operate.  River  pollution  increases,  and  stagnant  sewage \nthreatens  health  conditions.  Data  on  drinking  water  quality  in  Azerbaijan  are  scant  due  to \ninadequate  monitoring  and  record-keeping  practices.  While  some  reports  indicate  that \nwaterborne  diseases,  such  as  bacterial  dysentery,  parasitic  infections,  typhoid,  and  viral \nhepatitis,  spread  in  Azerbaijan  during  the  1990s,  official  health  statistics  indicate  that  the \nincidence of these diseases is declining. \n \n13. \n Financial Aspects of Sector Services. The current financial performance of SuKanals \n(town WSS agencies) and joint stock companies (JSCs) is poor. Although SuKanals and JSCs \nare self-financing agencies in principle, they are unable to recover tariffs directly due to the poor \ncondition of infrastructure and related services. For nonroutine repairs, SuKanals and JSCs rely \non  additional  funds  from  AZERSU,  which  are  not  always  forthcoming.  Moreover,  operating \nrevenues from tariffs are inadequate to undertake proper operation and maintenance, leading to \nthe continued deterioration of WSS systems. Tariffs are low, and customers resist paying water \nbills  due  to  poor  service.  Billing  and  recording  of  outstanding  amounts  are  not  properly \nmanaged. The absence of residential and bulk water metering not only makes it impossible to \nmeasure consumption and to establish suitable tariffs, but also reduces incentives for demand \nmanagement.  The  current  method  of  door-to-door  payment  collection  also  compromises  the \nSuKanals and JSCs' ability to monitor payment. \n\n14. \nAdministrative  Structure. Until 2004, the WSS sector comprised (i) the Greater Baku \nand the Apsheron peninsula, served by the JSC Apsheron Regional Water Company; and (ii) all \nurban and rural communities outside the Apsheron peninsula, served by the Azersukanaltemir \nProduction Union (AzerSuKanal), a department within the State Committee for Construction and \n\n                                                 \n2  World Bank. 2003. Azerbaijan Municipal Services Study. Washington, DC. \n3   2004 data. World Bank. 2004. World Development Indicators 2004. Washington, DC. \n4   The United Nations Environmental Performance Review, 2004 gives sewage coverage in Baku as 72%.  \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nArchitecture. In June 2004, Presidential Decree No. 252 liquidated AzerSuKanal and transferred \nits functions and assets to the JSC Azersu (formerly JSC Apsheron Regional Water Company). \n\n15. \nAzerSuKanal  had  51  local  branches  (water  and  wastewater  enterprises,  known  as \nSuKanals)  to  provide  WSS  services  in  provincial  towns  and  other  residential  areas.  Under \nPresidential Decree No. 252, AZERSU now manages all SuKanals and JSCs,5 coordinates their \nactivities, and prepares proposals on implementing state policy to improve WSS systems. The \nexception is the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, which is overseen by the State Amelioration \nand Water Management Agency (SAWMA). \n\n4. \n\nPolicy Framework \n\nRationale  for  Sector \n\n16. \nInvestment.  The  Government  and  international  financial \ninstitutions  have  identified  deterioration  in  physical  condition  of  WSS  infrastructure  and  the \nprovision  of  wastewater  and  fecal  sludge  treatment  facilities  as  key  interventions  to  address \nimprovements  in  the  provision  of  WSS  services.  Assessment  of  the  country's  economic \nperformance  indicates  that  production  growth  was  led  by  construction  (36%  growth  in  2007\u2013\n2008), indicating development of secondary town and rural infrastructure along with residential \nand  commercial  building  construction.  However,  investigations  during  design  and  construction \nof existing projects indicate that a substantial level of investment is required to meet the targets \nindicated in the state program and its strategic goals (footnote 1). Overriding the infrastructure \nneed  is  the  requirement  to  ensure  that  investments  are  environmentally  sustainable  and  that \ngood governance practices are adopted to improve levels of service delivery. \n \nStrategic  Vision.  The  strategic  vision  of  the  road  map  is  to  improve  the  availability, \n17. \nquality,  reliability,  and  sustainability  of  WSS  services  in  Azerbaijan\u2019s  rayon  (regional)  centers \nand settlements surrounding Baku. The road map will comprehensively address the objectives \nof  the  following  key  strategic  documents:  (i)  the  ongoing  country  partnership  strategy,  and  (ii) \nthe state program. \n \n18. \nThe  Investment  Program  will  improve  the  quality  and  coverage  of  urban  services  in \nsecondary towns, peri-urban areas surrounding Baku, and other centers in the country. Physical \noutputs  will  include  (i)  increased  water  supply  coverage,  increased  number  of  connections  to \npiped  networks,  and  reduced  system  leaks  to  ensure  24-hour  supply  of  pressurized,  safe \ndrinking  water;  and  (ii) \nIt  will  benefit \nincreased  wastewater  disposal  and \napproximately 500,000 residents.  \n \n19.  Main  Challenges  and  Operating  Conditions.  The  WSS  sector  is  faced  with  the \nfollowing  developmental  challenges:  (i)  ability  to  ensure  infrastructure  or  asset  creation  on \nschedule  based  on  limited  construction  capacity  in  the  country;  (ii)  lack  of  skilled  staff  in \nSuKanals  and  JSCs  to  maintain  WSS  systems,  especially  wastewater  treatment  plants;  (iii) \nability to increase tariffs progressively and to overcome shortfalls in operation and maintenance \ncosts  to  achieve  financial  sustainability;  (iv)  ability  to  ensure  environmental  sustainability  of \ninvestments;  (v)  ability  to  develop  staff  capacity  of  SuKanals  and  JSCs  to  plan,  design,  and \nmanage  WSS  services;  and  (vi)  ability  to  institute  good  governance  practices  (e.g., \nmanagement  information  systems,  prudent  financial  management  and  accounting  practices, \nand  human  resource  development)  in  service  delivery.  Overcoming  these  challenges  is \ncontingent  on  the  reform  agenda  adopted  by  the  executing  agencies\u2014Azersu  and  SAWMA\u2014\n\ntreatment. \n\n                                                 \n5   In  Agdash,  Ganja,  Goychay,  and  Sheki,  WSS  operations  are  currently  being  carried  out  under  separate  JSCs\u2014 \nsubsidiary  companies  of  Azersu  formed  under  projects  financed  by  ADB  and  German  development  cooperation \nthrough KfW. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n35 \n\nand  their  action  plan  to  progressively  improve  the  environmental,  institutional,  and  financial \nsustainability of WSS services. \n \n20. \nReform  Agenda. The WSS sector's reform agenda will (i) ensure service sustainability \nthrough institutional and managerial reforms; (ii) improve efficiencies in service delivery through \nstrengthened  management  measures,  introducing  performance-based  service  contracts,  and \nmanaging  scales  of  operations  by  clustering  local  governments  where  possible;  (iii)  improve \nsystem accountability through better information flow, decentralized systems, and benchmarking \ncosts and performance; and (iv) improve financial management through revenue enhancement \nmeasures, budget prioritization, and asset and liability management. \n \n21. \nA  set  of  sequenced  reform  actions  and  sector  investments  will  bring  improvements  in \nservice delivery. The Investment Program responds to these needs by adopting a long-term and \nholistic  approach  improving  institutions,  capacities  and  systems,  and  service  delivery.  The \nInvestment  Program  will  finance  instruments  targeting  (i)  institutional  improvements  for  WSS \nservice  delivery;  (ii)  capacity  development  for  better  system  planning,  operation,  and \nmaintenance;  (iii)  enhanced  cost  recovery  through  metering,  billing,  and  collecting  tariffs; \n(iv) increased efficiency for timely processing of effective WSS projects; (v) asset management; \n(vi) introducing a performance benchmarking system; and (vii) a twinning arrangement with an \nexternal  WSS  utility  to  support  capacity  development.  The  Investment  Program  also  includes \nprogram management support to help with (i) gender, safeguards, governance, legal, financial, \nand administrative matters; (ii) design works for subsequent tranches; and (iii) general training \nand development.  \n\nB. \n\nInvestment Program \n\n1. \n\nSector Investment Need \n\nBased on WSS priorities set in the state program, Azerbaijan\u2019s WSS sector needs $3.5 \n22. \nbillion  in  investment  by  2015.  Out  of  this,  $1.235  billion  has  already  been  committed  by \ninternational financial institutions and the Government (Table A2.1), and the remaining $2.310 \nbillion  is  to  be  mobilized  through  additional  international  financial  institution  funding  and  the \nGovernment's  own  resources  (Table  A2.2).  The  total  investments  include  infrastructure \ndevelopment  and  management  interventions  to  ensure  the  sector's  technical  and  financial \nsustainability.  \n \n\nInternational Financial Institution \n\nTable A2.1: Azerbaijan Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Investments Committed by \nInternational Financial Institutions and the Government \n ($ million) \n \n Towns  \n      3  \n1  ADB \u2013 1 \n      2  \n2  KfW + SECO \n     22  \n3  World Bank - 1 \n     21  \n4  World Bank - 2 \n     10  \n5  JBIC \n      1  \n6  Natexis Banques Popularies  \n \n     59  \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank;  JBIC  =  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation;  SECO  =  Swiss  Economic \nCooperation Agency.  \nSource: Azersu Joint Stock Company; State Amelioration and Water Management Agency (Nakhchivan) estimates. \n\nProject \n   39.90  \n   71.37 \n  310.00  \n  410.00  \n  320.00  \n   84.00  \n 1,235.27  \n\nLoan \n   30.00  \n   48.49 \n  230.00  \n  260.00  \n  272.00  \n   51.80  \n  892.29  \n\nGov\u2019t \n   9.90  \n   9.88  \n  80.00  \n  150.00  \n  48.00  \n  32.20  \n  329.98  \n\nGrant \n     -  \n  13.00  \n     -  \n     -  \n     -  \n     -  \n  13.00  \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nTable A2.2: Azerbaijan Water Supply and Sanitation Sector \nRemaining Investment Needs by Component \n($ million) \n\nSector \nWater Supply \nSanitation \nInstitutional Development and Capacity Building a \nTotal \na Includes program management and survey and investigations cost estimates. \nSource: Azersu Joint Stock Company; State Amelioration and Water Management Agency (Nakhchivan) estimates. \n \n23. \nwhich totals $600 million.

The  economic  analysis \n\n1. \nObjectives.  The  following  discussions  present  the  economic  viability  analysis  of  two \noperational joint stock companies involved in two subprojects under the tranche 1 project of the \nWater  Supply  and  Sanitation  Investment  Program  (the  Investment  Program).  These  two \nsubprojects were considered for the range of supply sources, population coverage, and system \noperation and maintenance in the areas where they operate. \n \nfollows  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \n2. \nguidelines,  including  the  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects1 and  Handbook  for \nthe  Economic  Analysis  of  Water  Supply  Projects. 2  The  analysis  describes  the  economic \nrationale  and  target  beneficiaries  and  undertakes  a  viability  analysis  of  the  two  subprojects. \nBased  on  sector  review,  demand  analysis,  and  subproject  beneficiary  assessment,  economic \nbenefit\u2013cost  and  sensitivity  analyses  were  carried  out.  The  economic  benefit\u2013cost  analysis \ncompares the calculated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) with the economic opportunity \ncost  of  capital  (EOCC),  assumed  to  be  12%.  With  an  EIRR  greater  than  an  EOCC,  the \nsubproject  proposal  is  deemed  economically  feasible.  A  sensitivity  analysis  was  conducted  to \nsee  the  effects  of  certain  adverse  conditions  on  system  capital  investment  and  operation  and \nmaintenance costs, revenue generation, and overall subproject viability. The analysis uses the \ndomestic price numeraire, as benefits are nontradable in nature. The analysis was undertaken \nat constant mid-2008 price levels and assesses the subproject effects over a 30-year period. \n \n3. \nEconomic  Rationale  and  Goals.  The  subproject  rationale  results  from  the  increasing \nconcern  over  the  deteriorating  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS)  conditions  in  towns  and \ncommunities,  mainly  resulting  from  insufficient  funds  and  system  mismanagement.  Without \nurgent  investments  to  pursue  the  long-term  objective  of  providing  sufficient  and  secure  WSS \nservices,  negative  impacts  on  the  health  of  the  poor  and  their  economic  condition  would  only \ntend to nullify any limited effort already undertaken. The Investment Program is considered high \npriority by the Government of Azerbaijan and is well integrated with other investment planning \nactivities in the sector. \n \n4. \nSelection  Approach. The subprojects were selected based on the sector development \nplan and road map for the Investment Program (Appendix 2).3 The selection process required (i) \nconsistency  with  demand,  based  on  community  willingness  to  participate  and  contribute;  (ii) \nleast-cost  approach  of  meeting  effective  demand  in  terms  of  location,  scale,  scope,  and \nappropriate technology; and (iii) economic benefits to exceed economic costs. Preference was \nalso  given  to  communities  with  higher  water-related  health  risks  and  to  multiple  communities \nserved by single integrated systems. \n \n5. \nProject  Components.  The  tranche  1  project  focuses  on  the  secure  and  sustainable \nsupply  of  good-quality  potable  water  to  the  towns  of  Goychay  and  Nakhchivan.  The  physical \nworks comprise WSS networks. The local distribution network will include metered connections. \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 1997.

Manila. \n3  Subcomponents under the infrastructure component will (i) construct, upgrade, or rehabilitate water and sewerage \ninfrastructure to improve service delivery in the sector and meet the following strategic goals of the state program \non  poverty  reduction  and  sustainable  development\u2014improved  public  infrastructure,  sustainable  environmental \nmanagement,  and  improved  public  administration  and  good  governance;  (ii)  be  in  line  with  approved  feasibility \nassessment  meeting  the  engineering,  financial,  economic,  environmental,  and  social  requirements  of  Azerbaijan \nand  ADB;  (iii)  have  been  allocated  counterpart  funding  sufficient  to  implement  the  project  or  subcomponents  as \nscheduled  and  maintain  such  project  or  subcomponent  facilities  upon  completion;  and  (iv)  have  been  granted \ngovernment approvals and endorsements. \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nThe  tranche  1  project  will  also  receive  management  improvement  and  capacity  development \nsupport,  and  a  program  management  facility  will  oversee  project  design,  supervision, \nmanagement, and administration. \n \nEconomic  Costs.  The  economic  capital  investment  and  annual  operation  and \n6. \nmaintenance costs have been calculated from the financial cost estimates given in Appendix 9. \nTaxes  and  duties  are  excluded  from  the  financial  costs  as  they  represent  transfer  payments. \nPrice  inflation  and  market  distortions  are  also  excluded.  The  subproject  capital  and  operation \nand  maintenance  costs  are  distributed  into  traded  and  nontraded  components  and  labor.  For \ntraded and nontraded components, the shadow exchange rate factor is assumed at 1.02 based \non previous and ongoing projects by the ADB and the World Bank in Azerbaijan. Unskilled labor \nis  available  in  the  secondary  town,  which  means  the  opportunity  cost  is  lower  than  the  wage \nrate. The shadow wage rate is assumed at 0.8 for unskilled labor, following estimates made for \nagricultural and highway projects in the regions. The economic costs are given in real terms and \nphased  over  the  project  design  period  of  24  years  under  the  multitranche  financing  facility. \nTable A8.1 presents the calculation of the economic project costs for the two subprojects. \n \n\nTable A8.1: Conversion of Financial Cost to Economic Project Cost \n($.million) \n\nSubproject Goychay \n\nItem\n\nCivil Works\nLand Acquisition & Resettlement\nEquipment & Materials\nInfrastructure Cost\n\nInstitutional Dev & Capacity Building\nProgram Management Facility\nViability Gap Funding\n\nFinancial Foreign\n\nCost\nTotal\n    \n14.252\n          \n-\n      \n1.180\n    \n15.432\n\nCost\n\n    \n4.276\n        \n-\n    \n0.708\n    \n4.984\n\nLocal Unskilled Balance Taxes Other\nLocal\nCost\nCost\n    \n6.984\n        \n-\n    \n0.472\n    \n7.456\n\nLabor\n30%\n     \n2.993\n         \n-\n         \n-\n     \n2.993\n\n   \n1.796\n       \n-\n   \n0.319\n   \n2.114\n\n    \n5.188\n       \n-\n    \n0.153\n    \n5.341\n\n    \n9.977\n        \n-\n    \n0.472\n  \n10.449\n\nForeign Unskilled Other Economic\nx SERF x SWRF\n\n1.02\n    \n4.361\n        \n-\n    \n0.722\n    \n5.083\n\n0.80\n      \n2.394\n          \n-\n          \n-\n      \n2.394\n\nx SCF\n1.00\n    \n5.188\n        \n-\n    \n0.153\n    \n5.341\n\nProject\nCost\n     \n11.943\n           \n-\n       \n0.876\n     \n12.819\n\n      \n      \n\n0.850\n7.000\n\n    \n    \n\n0.090\n1.600\n\n    \n    \n\n0.760\n5.400\n\n         \n-\n         \n-\n\n    \n    \n\n0.760\n5.400\n\n-\n       \n       \n-\n\n    \n    \n\n0.760\n5.400\n\n    \n    \n\n0.092\n1.632\n\n          \n-\n          \n-\n\n    \n    \n\n0.760\n5.400\n\n       \n       \n\n0.852\n7.032\n\nBase Cost\n\n    \n\n23.282\n\n    \n\n6.674\n\n  \n16.609\n\n     \n\n2.993\n\n  \n13.616\n\n   \n\n2.114\n\n  \n11.501\n\n    \n\n6.807\n\n      \n\n2.394\n\n  \n11.501\n\n     \n\n20.703\n\nPhysical Contingency\n\n      \n\n2.260\n\n    \n\n0.226\n\n    \n\n2.034\n\n         \n-\n\n    \n\n2.034\n\n       \n-\n\n    \n\n2.034\n\n    \n\n0.230\n\n          \n-\n\n    \n\n2.034\n\n       \n\n2.264\n\nTotal Cost\n13.535\n  \nSERF = shadow exchange rate factor; SWRF = shadow wage rate factor; SCF = standard conversion factor \n \nSubproject Nakhchivan \n\n13.535\n\n18.642\n\n15.649\n\n25.542\n\n6.900\n\n2.394\n\n7.038\n\n2.993\n\n2.114\n\n      \n\n    \n\n    \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n   \n\n22.967\n\n \n\nItem\n\nCivil Works\nLand Acquisition & Resettlement\nEquipment & Materials\nInfrastructure Cost\n\nInstitutional Dev & Capacity Buildin\nProgram Management Facility\nViability Gap Funding\n\nFinancial Foreign\n\nCost\nTotal\n\n      \n9.574\n          \n-\n      \n0.872\n    \n10.446\n\nCost\n\n     \n2.872\n         \n-\n     \n0.523\n     \n3.395\n\nLocal Unskilled Balance\nLabor\nCost\n30%\n     \n2.011\n-\n         \n         \n-\n   \n2.011\n\nLocal\nCost\n     \n4.691\n         \n-\n     \n0.349\n   \n5.040\n\n    \n6.702\n        \n-\n    \n0.349\n  \n7.051\n\nTaxes\n\nOther\n\n     \n1.206\n         \n-\n     \n0.235\n   \n1.442\n\n     \n3.485\n         \n-\n     \n0.113\n   \n3.598\n\nForeign Unskilled\nx SWRF\nx SERF\n1.02\n0.80\n       \n2.930\n          \n-\n       \n0.534\n     \n3.463\n\n       \n1.608\n          \n-\n          \n-\n       \n1.608\n\nOther\nx SCF\n1.00\n\n       \n3.485\n          \n-\n       \n0.113\n       \n3.598\n\nEconomic\nProject\nCost\n\n       \n8.023\n          \n-\n       \n0.647\n     \n8.670\n\n      \n      \n\n0.850\n4.250\n\n     \n     \n\n0.090\n0.800\n\n    \n    \n\n0.760\n3.450\n\n-\n         \n         \n-\n\n     \n     \n\n0.760\n3.450\n\n         \n-\n         \n-\n\n     \n     \n\n0.760\n3.450\n\n       \n       \n\n0.092\n0.816\n\n          \n-\n          \n-\n\n       \n       \n\n0.760\n3.450\n\n       \n       \n\n0.852\n4.266\n\nBase Cost\n\n    \n\n15.546\n\n     \n\n4.285\n\n11.261\n\n   \n\n2.011\n\n   \n\n9.250\n\n   \n\n1.442\n\n   \n\n7.808\n\n     \n\n4.371\n\n       \n\n1.608\n\n       \n\n7.808\n\n   \n\n13.788\n\nPhysical Contingency\n\n      \n\n1.395\n\n     \n\n0.139\n\n    \n\n1.255\n\n         \n-\n\n     \n\n1.255\n\n         \n-\n\n     \n\n1.255\n\n       \n\n0.142\n\n          \n-\n\n       \n\n1.255\n\n       \n\n1.398\n\n \n\n   \n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n4.425\n\n2.011\n\n1.442\n\n16.941\n\n12.516\n\n10.505\n\nTotal Cost\n9.064\nSERF = shadow exchange rate factor; SWRF = shadow wage rate factor; SCF = standard conversion factor \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n7. \nTable  A8.2  indicates  the  projected  annual  economic  operation  and  maintenance  costs \nfor the two subprojects.

Prior  to  and  without  the  tranche  1  project,  over  50%  of \nhouseholds  in  the  subproject  towns  relied  on  alternative  water  either  through  tankers,  bottled, \ncollected,  or  pumped  from  distant  irrigation  canals,  springs,  and  rivers.  With  the  tranche  1 \nproject,  piped  water  will  replace  all  alternative  supplies  from  these  sources,  which  will  now \ncomprise  nonincremental  demand.  The  existing  water  systems  in  the  two  subprojects  have \nrecently undergone improvement since initial investment to increase supply coverage to about \n80%  in  the  central  districts,  but  large  areas  outside  the  town  centers  are  yet  to  see \ndevelopment.  However,  low-quality  supplies  still  afflict  served  and  unserved  populations.  The \nsupply situation is projected to rise with the population growth rate and to increase annually to \nreach the design target population served at 90% by 2013 (year 5). \n \n9. \nExisting  demand  averages  150\u2013200  liters  per  capita  per  day  for  house  connections. \nDemand  is  based  on  existing  reports  and  actual  survey,  and  is  assumed  to  improve  with  the \nsubprojects  in  place.  In  the  selected  program  towns,  households  without  connections  could \nspend  about  2\u20134  hours  daily  covering  a  distance  of  500\u20131,500  meters  to  collect  water  from \nunsafe  sources,  such  as  open  irrigation  canals  and  unprotected  surface  water.  Poor \nmaintenance  of  the  existing  piped  systems\u2014due  to  lack  of  funds  resulting  from  inadequate \ntariffs and low collection rates\u2014has also led connected households to supplement their current \nneeds  in  the  same  manner,  with some  reverting  to  the  more  expensive  supplies from  delivery \ntankers  and  other  vendors.  However,  with  available  supplies  mitigated  through  the  financial \noperational  plans  outlined  in  the  financial  analysis  (Appendix  9),  current  demand  levels  are \nexpected be met. In more developed sections of the program towns, there are consumers who \nexceed design demand levels, and have the capacity and willingness to pay for the excess. This \ninduced demand arises with the lower price offered with the piped service. However, if tariffs are \nmaintained at current levels, the situation leads to the depletion of supply sources earlier than \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nthe projected design horizon at 24 years, or by 2033. In this instance, sufficient funds will have \nbeen  generated  from  the  improved  financial  operations  to  finance  development  of  additional \nsupplies to augment increased demand.  Financial projections indicate that with proposed tariff \nincreases and viability gap fund, sufficient surpluses are generated over time to finance capital \ninvestments either directly or by leveraging surpluses for debt. Table A8.3 presents the current \nand future demand situation in the two sample subprojects. For purposes of the analysis, year 0 \n(2008) is taken to represent the without-project situation, for although the systems are partially \noperational, any reported improvements to the system and service prior to project interventions \nremain  insignificant.  The  first  year  of  full  or  improved  system  operation\u2014when  all  facilities \nincluding financial operational reform plans are established\u2014is placed toward the end of year 4 \n(2012) or early in year 5 (2013). \n \nSubproject  Beneficiaries.  Subproject  beneficiaries  comprise  domestic  and \n10. \nnondomestic users with existing connections and those who are yet to avail of connections but \npreviously  obtained  water  from  alternative  sources.  Beneficiaries  also  include  households  that \nwill  continue  to  depend  on  alternative  sources  as  main  supply  sources  for  economic  and \ntechnical reasons. In Goychay, the number of beneficiaries is seen to rise by 39% by year 25 \n(2033)  from  the  without-project  situation,  and  in  Nakhchivan,  by  25%  in  the  same  period.

The  main  benefits  would  arise  from  resource \n\n11. \ncost savings and from incremental water demand: \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThere will be incremental benefits that accrue from induced demand\u2014estimated \nat  15%\u201320%  of  total  projected  demand\u2014due  to  lower  costs  associated  with \npiped service from the tranche 1 project. The with- and without-project scenarios \nare evaluated to determine the benefits effects.  \nThe  benefits  are  quantified  based  on  cost  savings  or  avoided  costs  for \nnonincremental  water  supply.  The  cost  of  time  used  for  collecting  water  is \nestimated at 50% of the average hourly wage rate in the area and using average \ndistance  and  collection  time.  This  is  multiplied  by  the  shadow  wage  rate  at  0.8 \nand  the  number  of  hours  spent  annually  on  water  collection.  To  this,  the \npurchase  cost  for  in-house  storage,  maintenance,  and  water  supply  treatment \n(i.e.,  boiling  and  filtration)  is  added.  These  benefits  account  for  the  costs  that \nhouseholds would have incurred in the without-project situation. The total cost to \nthe  household  is  then  divided  by  the  total  water  consumption,  to  arrive  at  the \nnonincremental benefit per unit consumption (in $ per cubic meter).  \nExisting  supplemental  supplies  through  water  vendors  and  tankers  will  be \nreplaced by the new piped system and also form part of nonincremental inputs. \nThe price of delivered water is estimated at $10\u2013$20 per month per household. \nOver 50% of subproject town population rely on this service. Bottled water users \nthat make up 1%\u20133% of the population pay as much as $1.50 per day.  \nInduced  demand  would  comprise  incremental  benefits,  which  are  valued  using \nthe  average  willingness-to-pay-based  actual  survey  conducted  in  the  areas \nduring project preparation, and the long-run marginal cost proxied by the average \nincremental economic cost in the analysis.  \nThere are no benefits assumed from nontechnical loss, such as pilferage, meter \ntampering,  and  illegal  connections,  as  these  occurrences  are  atypical  in  the \nsubproject communities. \n\n \n12. \nEconomic Benefits for Sanitation. Economic analysis for this program part cannot be \npractically  undertaken  due  to  difficulty  in  monetizing  the  expected  benefits  from  the \nimprovement of sewage and on-site sanitation facilities. One baseline indicator on sanitation\u2014\nhouseholds\u2019  willingness  to  pay  a  premium  for  sewer  connection  versus  the  expenditure  being \nincurred  for  on-site  sanitation  systems\u2014reveal  only  about  a  50%  premium.  This  means \nsubstantial investments in sewerage would be difficult to justify in economic terms if only private \nbenefits  are  taken  into  account.  There  will  be  public  benefits  for  both  community  and \nenvironment  that  need  to  be  carefully  assessed  from  a  qualitative  standpoint  given  the \nchallenge  associated  with  sanitation  benefits  quantitative  analysis.  Some  key  benefits  that  do \nnot  lend  to  quantitative  analysis  due  to  lack  of  information  include  (i)  long-run  marginal  cost \nsavings, (ii) increase in property values, (iii) health impact, and (iv) impact on the environment. \n \n13. \nEconomic Benefit\u2013Cost Analysis. The main economic costs evaluated in the analysis \ncomprise  capital  investment  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs.  The  major  economic \nbenefits include  nonincremental  water  assessed  using  a  resource  cost-savings  approach.  The \nannual cost streams are set against the annual benefit streams and discounted using the EOCC \nat 12% as the hurdle rate. The resulting present value of benefits is divided by the present value \nof  costs,  and\u2014if  the  resulting  ratio  is  greater  than  or  equal  to  1.0\u2014the  subproject  is  deemed \nacceptable.  Table  A8.4  summarizes  the  results  for  the  two  subprojects,  all  of  which  show \nbenefit\u2013cost ratio above 1.0. \n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n \n \nTable A8.4: Benefit\u2013Cost Analysis \n($ million) \n\nAverage \n\nSubproject \nGoychay \n\n Subproject \nNakhchivan \n\nParticulars \nPresent Value of Benefits\n\nNon-incremental \nIncremental\n\nTotal Benefits \nPresent Value of Costs \nCapital Investment\nReplacement \nOperation and Maintenance \n\nTotal Costs \nBenefit\u2013Cost Ratio\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n11.29\n \n \n13.35\n \n24.64\n\n14.98\n \n \n0.01\n2.05\n \n17.05\n \n1.45\n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n13.42\n \n \n14.11\n \n27.53\n\n18.04\n \n \n0.01\n \n1.93\n19.98\n \n1.38\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n9.17\n  \n  \n12.58\n  \n21.75\n\n11.93\n  \n  \n0.01\n2.18\n  \n14.12\n  \n  \n1.54\n\n \n\n                  \n14. \nEconomic  Internal  Rate  of  Return.  The  benefits  streams  from  resource  cost  savings \nare  compared  with  the  cost  streams  of  capital  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs  to \ndetermine the discounted net cash flows and the resulting EIRR for each subproject joint stock \ncompany.  Following  ADB  guidelines,  the  EOCC  is  set  at  12%.  The  results  show  base  case \nEIRR exceeding the EOCC. The average EIRR is at 19.4%. For the individual subprojects, the \nEIRR  ranges  between  18.0%  and  20.8%.

The  EIRRs  are  tested  for  sensitivity  using  the  following \nparameters: (i) a 20% increase in capital cost, (ii) 20% increase in operation and maintenance \ncost, (iii) 20% reduction in benefits, and (iv) 1-year delay in benefits. Likewise, switching values \nare applied to the cost and benefit parameters. For Nakhchivan, economic returns are generally \nrobust,  except  for  increased  capital  cost  and  lower  benefits-generation  scenarios.  The \nsubproject  in  Goychay  results  in  positive  returns  in  all  scenarios.  The  joint  stock  companies \nwould find highest risk in decreased benefits, and a 1-year delay in benefits would have slight \neffects. The switching values represent the change in costs and benefits that sets the EIRR at \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n53 \n\n12%. The results show the subprojects can absorb changes in capital cost of 35.7%\u201347.8% and \nstill  remain economically  viable.  Decreases in benefits  of 27.6%\u201335.5%  are  also manageable. \nCapital cost may increase by as much as 41.7%\u201363.8% with the EIRR still satisfying an EOCC \nof 12%. \n \n16. \nConclusion. The economic benefit\u2013cost analysis indicates that the selected subprojects \nare economically viable, with EIRR values exceeding the EOCC at base case, with an average \nat  19.4%.  The  sensitivity  analysis  for  the  two  subprojects  demonstrates  the  results  to  be \ngenerally  acceptable,  even  when  tested  under  stress  conditions.  The  resulting  economic \nbenefit\u2013cost  ratios  for  the  subproject  average  1.50,  also  denoting  economic  feasibility.  Over \n130,000 beneficiaries are expected on subproject implementation. \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n\n1. \nBackground  and  Objectives.  The  tranche  1  project  under  the  Water  Supply  and \nSanitation Investment Program (the Investment Program) will cover subprojects in Goychay and \nNakhchivan.  In  these  towns,  the  existing  water  supply  and  sanitation  system  is  over  50  years \nold. Water supply sources are in a poor state of repair, and water treatment facilities are largely \ndysfunctional. The sewage system is in even worse condition. Pipes are broken or clogged \nwith  silt  and  debris,  and  wastewater  is  discharged  into  ditches  or  the  nearest  watercourses. \nPoor sanitation and leaking sewers are creating serious health risks and environmental hazards. \nSewerage  connections  are  only  25%.  Presently,  the  population  served  by  the  existing  water \nsupply  system  in  the  two  towns  is  reportedly  80%.  However,  the  majority  of  residents  do  not \nhave  access  to  safe  drinking  water.  Further,  low  water  supply  and  sanitation  tariffs  and \ncollection  efficiency,  due  to  poor  services,  have  aggravated  the  situation  as  profits  are  barely \nsufficient to cover recurrent costs, let alone asset replacement. \n \n2. \nA  review  of  the  finances  of  joint  stock  companies  (JSCs)  operating  in  these  towns \nindicates the need to set up a financial operational plan to help ensure the sustainability of all \nthe  subprojects  undertaken  through  the  Investment  Program.  The  approach  to  the  analysis, \nassumptions, and conclusion are discussed in the following sections. \n \nMethodology.  The  two  subprojects  were  analyzed  following  ADB's  Handbook  for  the \n3. \nEconomic  Analysis  of  Water  Supply  Projects 1  and  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of \nProjects. 2  The  financial  analysis  assesses  the  ability  of  the  subprojects  to  meet  capital \nexpenditure,  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  and  if  appropriate,  debt  servicing  and \ndepreciation or reinvestment margins. \n \n4. \nThe analysis is conducted on a with- and without-project basis by estimating incremental \ncosts and revenues over a 25-year period. The main financial viability parameters analyzed are \n(i) the financial internal rate of return (FIRR), which must be greater than the weighted average \ncost of capital (WACC), with the financial net present value as proxy; (ii) operating ratio, which \nmust  be  less  than  or  equal  to  unity  when  the  subproject  is  fully  operational;  and  (iii)  tariff \naffordability,  which  is  normally  acceptable  at  a  maximum  of  5%  of  the  average  household \nincome. Details of the analysis are presented in the Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n5. \nThe  analysis  looks  closely  at  the  operating  ratio  as  the  main  indicator of  sustainability, \nwhere  operation  and  maintenance,  depreciation,  and  interest  expenses  are  measured  against \ntariff  revenues.  A  ratio  at  less  than  unity  reflects  cost  recovery,  thus  a  certain  level  of \nsustainability; at greater than unity, the lack thereof, thus the need to increase tariffs or to obtain \nsubsidies.

As the basis for calculating existing \ntariffs  is  difficult  to  verify,  the  required  initial  increase  at  subproject  completion  by  2012  (year \n4)\u2014which could be substantial\u2014has been determined based on user affordability and targeted \ncost recovery levels, including (i) operation and maintenance cost coverage, (ii) operation and \nmaintenance  cost  plus  depreciation  coverage,  and  (iii)  operation  and  maintenance  cost  plus \ndepreciation  and  loan  interest  coverage.  Where  tariffs  exceed  maximum  affordability,  subsidy \nneeds have been estimated. A \u201csoft\u201d pre-project tariff increase of 25% is likewise proposed by \n2010  (year  2).  The  increases  and  assessed  subsidies  will  form  part  of  the  financial  reform \noperational plan. \n \n8. \nThe analysis is based on the design demand of about 150 liters per capita per day for \ndomestic connection, increasing to 200 liters per capita per day when the system becomes fully \noperational  by  the  end  of  2012.  Nondomestic  demand  is  at  20%  of  domestic  demand. \nWastewater generation is at 70% of total water demand. \n \nThe demand forecast assumes all water from  existing alternative sources, i.e., through \n9. \ntankers,  bottled,  collected  from  point  source,  or  pumped,  will  be  replaced  from  the  subproject \nwater  supply.  This  is  featured  as  nonincremental  water  in  the  economic  analysis.  System \nimprovements  with-project  will  curb  unaccounted-for  water  from  current  levels  of  about  \n30%\u201340% upon project completion, and further to 20% within 2 years hence, to make billable \nwater available to the system, thereby improving the cost recovery perspective.

Weighted Average Cost of Capital. The WACC is calculated in real terms and used as \nthe hurdle rate for FIRR to measure subproject viability. Funding sources are the ADB loans and \nthe  Government\u2019s  contribution,  at  about  75%\u201325%  sharing.  Inflation  is  estimated  at  2.5%  for \nforeign cost and 10.1% annual average for local costs. The rates are computed on an after-tax \nbasis, resulting in the WACC in real terms estimated at 2.47%.

Subproject  operation  and  maintenance  costs \ninclude  JSC  staff  salaries,  power  and  energy,  chemical  treatment,  maintenance,  and \nmiscellaneous  expenses,  and  are  based  on  SuKanal  (town  WSS  agency)  historical  financial \noperations. Bad debt expense is assumed at 1% of sales. Escalation is applied based on local \ninflation.  Depreciation  is  assumed  at  2%  annually  (50-year  items)  for  civil  works  and  6.7%\u2013\n10.0%  (10-  to  15-year  items)  for  replacement  materials  and  equipment.  Replacement  of  fully \ndepreciated assets is assumed to be financed through internal cash. \n \n15. \nCost-Recovery Analysis. Tariffs are established by dividing all cash requirements plus \nmargins by  the combined volume of water sold  and wastewater generated. It is projected that \nthe collection rate would improve as services improve. In the analysis, the actual collection rate \nof  about  60%  for  Goychay  and  Nakhchivan  is  expected  to  reach  90%  by  2012  (year  4).  The \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nanalysis  determines  the  level  of  tariffs  required  to  satisfy  various  cost-recovery  options.  The \nrequired subsidy levels have been assessed in the form of a viability gap fund where tariffs are \ninsufficient to attain full cost recovery. \n \nCurrent Tariffs. Tariffs follow current practice that differentiates tariffs for domestic and \n16. \nnondomestic  use.  All  tariffs  are  volumetric  and  thus  structured  to  prevent  waste.  However, \nmetering  is  very  limited,  with  coverage  averaging  less  than  30%  of  total  services.  Where \nmetering  is  available,  wear  and  disrepair  have  made  the  equipment  unreliable,  and  complete \nreplacement  is  recommended  and  budgeted  under  the  subproject  capital  investment.  House \nconnections for combined water and sewage services are presently charged, on average, $0.14 \nper cubic meter in the two towns. Commercial and industrial connections are charged about 5 \ntimes that at $0.72 per cubic meter. A service charge for bulk quantity water used as production \nraw  material  is  at  $25.76  per  cubic  meter.  The  existing  structure,  although  allowing  for  \ncross-subsidization among connection types, does not necessarily target the poor.  \n \n17. \nTariff Basis and Forecast. In the financial projections, where costs are given in nominal \nterms,  the  tariffs  are  projected  to  increase  biennially  to  cope  with  cost  inflation.  The  projected \nincreases should be considered in planning financial reforms. In the FIRR cash flows, the tariffs \nare taken in real terms. It is proposed to include tariff restructuring as part of financial reforms \nwhere the poor, who have lower disposable incomes, would be able to at least cover their basic \nwater needs (e.g., 40 liters per capita per day or 3\u20135 cubic meters per month). Higher-income \nhouseholds,  generally  requiring  more  water  and  consequently  incurring  higher  marginal  costs, \nwould  be  made  to  pay  more.  Commercial  and  industrial  charges  may  be  revisited  so  more \nappropriate  levies  are  designed  to  encourage  on-time  payment.  As  backyard  gardening  and \nthe  subproject  area, \nlimited \nconsumption  for  such  purposes  may  be  attached  to  tariffs  to  be  established  for  public  stand \nposts. \n \nAffordability  Analysis.  An  affordability  analysis  was  undertaken  to  check  the  level  of \n18. \nwater expenditure against the average household income. Table A9.4 presents the affordability \nlevels in each subproject for year 1 (2009), year 5 (2013), year 10 (2018), and year 25 (2033). \nThe number of persons\u2014an average of 5.0 per household\u2014and unit consumption\u201490 liters per \ncapita per day in 2009\u2014are based on field surveys and actual operational reports. The average \nhousehold  incomes  are  based  on  social  surveys  conducted  in  the  subproject  towns  during \nproject preparation and adjusted to price inflation. \n \n\nlivestock  raising  are  commonly  practiced,  particularly \n\nin \n\nTable A9.4: Tariff Affordability  \n\nAverage\n\nParticulars\nPersons per household\nConsumption, lpcd\nAverage consumption/mo, m3\nAverage HH income/mo, $\nAverage HH Bill/mo, $\nIncome spent for water (%)a\n\n   \n\nYr 1\n4.9\n115\n17\n740\n3.26\n  \n0.4\n\n   \n\nYr 5\n4.9\n140\n21\n846\n4.32\n  \n0.5\n\n    \n\n4.9\n160\n24\n\nYr 10 Yr 25\n4.9\n160\n24\n1,029 1,853\n122.93\n16.20\n \n6.6%\n1.6\n\nSubproject Goychay\n\n   \n\n     \n\nYr 1 Yr 5 Yr 10 \n5.1\n5.1\n   \n5.1\n160\n140\n140\n21\n24\n21\n846 1,029\n805\n20.08\n4.72\n4.72\n \n \n \n2\n1\n1\n\nYr 25\n       \n5.1\n160\n24\n1,853\n179.63\n \n10\n\nSubproject Nakchivan\nYr 1 Yr 5 Yr 10 Yr 25\n4.7\n4.7\n160\n160\n23\n23\n846 1,029 1,853\n3.93 12.32 66.23\n4\n\n4.7\n90\n13\n674\n1.80\n0\n\n4.7\n140\n20\n\n1\n\n0\n\nlpcd = liters per capita per day; m3 = cubic meter \na Tariffs are deemed affordable at about 5% of average household income. Per social survey, customer -willingness- to-pay \n\n \n\nis much higher with improved service. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n59 \n\nBased  on  the  analysis,  tariff  increases  for  subproject  Goychay,  which  are  required  to \n19. \nsatisfy viability parameters, will eventually exceed consumer affordability, specifically during the \nfirst 5\u20137 years of debt payments (Supplementary Appendix C). During such periods, subsidies \n(i.e.,  viability  gap  funding)  will  need  to  be  considered.  Table  A9.4  indicates  that  the  monthly \ncharge for Goychay exceeding the generally accepted limit of 5% of household income in year \n25 (2033). This is not likely to happen in Nakhchivan, where income spent for water is below the \nlimit throughout the study period. The main factor for the difference is the larger customer base \nin Nakhchivan relative to the system type, which is also cheaper to operate. In future selection \nof subprojects under the Investment Program, due consideration to such technical factors will be \nemphasized. Additionally, while the Investment Program will account for meter installation in the \ncapital cost, the amount will be recovered from consumers over a 1-year period through tariffs. \nThe subsidization by way of deferred payment is to ensure that the cost is not an upfront load \non household income, consumers eventually own the meters, and working condition is ensured. \n \n20. \nTable  A9.5  presents  the  optimum  biennial  tariff  increases  needed  to  attain  financial \nsustainability at the defined cost recovery levels. Tariff increases every 2 years are required to \nattain  this  optimum  level  of  self-sufficiency.  However,  to  attain  full  financial  viability,  subsidies \nare required to soften the tariff burden on users. To minimize operational subsidy needs, tariffs \nmay  be  further  increased  by  larger  and  more  frequent  increments.  However,  consumer \naffordability may be compromised, as in Goychay, where the projected tariffs will go beyond the \ngenerally  accepted  limit  of  5%  as  early  as  year  16  (2024).  However,  over  the  project  period \n(2009\u20132029),  Goychay  will  average  4.1%  and  Nakhchivan  1.9%\u2014both  well  within  the  5% \nconsumer affordability limit. \n \n\nTable A9.5: Optimum Biennial Cost Recovery Tariff Increases \n(%) \n\n Level \nI \nII \nIII\n\n Cost Recovery \n\nAverage \n\nO&M Cost \nO&M Cost + Depreciation\nO&M Cost + Depreciation + Debt\n\n24\n48\n48\n\n25\n55\n55\n\nO&M = operation and maintenance \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nSubproject \nGoychay \n\n Subproject \nNakchivan \n\n22\n40\n40\n\n \n\n \n21. \nFinancial Viability Approach. The subproject is considered viable if the resulting FIRR \nis  greater  than  the  WACC,  and  cost  recovery  tariffs  are  within  consumer  affordability. \nAdditionally,  the  operating  ratio  must  be  maintained  lower  than  unity  throughout  the  project \nperiod  to  ensure  sustainability.  Initial  spreadsheet  iterations  reveal  that  without  the  subproject \nimprovements,  JSC  operations  will  not  be  sustainable,  with  operation  and  maintenance \nexpenditures  exceeding  tariff  revenues.  To  satisfy  all  viability  and  sustainability  parameters, \ntariffs must be subsidized until the end of the project through viability gap funding. Spreadsheet \niterations  were  run  to  determine  the  operating  ratio  with-project.

Figure A9.2 shows operating ratios \nin  the  without-  and  with-project  situations  at  full  cost  recovery,  including  operation  and \nmaintenance,  depreciation,  and  debt.  The  revenue  surplus  built  over  time  (and  beyond  the  \n10-year period for viability gap financing) will allow the JSCs to invest in capital expenditure and \nasset creation either directly or by leveraging the surplus for debt financing. \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\nFigure A9.2: Operating Ratio Without and With Project\n3.00\n\no\ni\nt\na\nR\n \ng\nn\ni\nt\na\nr\ne\np\nO\n\n2.50\n\n2.00\n\n1.50\n\n1.00\n\n0.50\n\n-\n\n9\n0\n0\n2\n\n1\n1\n0\n2\n\n3\n1\n0\n2\n\n5\n1\n0\n2\n\n7\n1\n0\n2\n\n9\n1\n0\n2\n\n1\n2\n0\n2\n\n3\n2\n0\n2\n\n5\n2\n0\n2\n\n7\n2\n0\n2\n\n9\n2\n0\n2\n\nGo ychay Witho ut\n\nGo ychay With\n\nNakhchivan Witho ut\n\nNakhchivan With\n\n \n\n                                  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n22. \nTo  maintain  an  operating  ratio  of  unity  from  2009  to  2019,  a  viability  gap  fund  as  an \noperational  subsidy  is  required.  It  is  assumed  that  optimum  biennial  tariffs  are  insufficient  to \nensure required operating ratios. With tariffs set at optimum biennial increases (Table A9.5), the \ntotal annual accumulative tariff subsidies or viability gap funding would amount to $24.12 million \nfor both JSCs for ensuring full cost recovery, as given in Table A9.6. \n \n\nTable A9.6: Subproject Subsidy Needs \n($ million) \n\n Level \nI \nII \nIII \n\n Cost Recovery \n\nO&M Cost \nO&M Cost + Depreciation\nO&M Cost + Depreciation + Debt\n\n \n \n \n\nTotal \n4.132\n \n21.033\n \n \n24.119\n\n \n \n \n\nSubproject \nGoychay \n\n2.913\n  \n13.913\n \n \n15.684\n\n Subproject \nNakchivan \n1.219\n \n7.120\n \n \n8.434\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nO&M = operation and maintenance. \nAsian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n \n23. \nFinancial  Viability  and  Sensitivity  Analysis.  Sensitivity  tests  were  performed  to \ndetermine the effects of (i) a 20% increase in investment cost, (ii) a 20% increase in operation \nand  maintenance  costs,  (iii)  a  20%  decrease  in  revenue,  and  (iv)  a  1-year  delay  in  project \nrevenue generation on subproject viability. Table A9.7 shows both subprojects remaining robust \nin all sensitivity parameters. For the two subprojects, the highest risk will be a 20% decrease in \nrevenue  generation.  A  change  in  capital  investment  cost  by  36.5%  in  Goychay  and  64%  in \nNakhchivan will still result in an acceptable FIRR and positive financial net present value for the \nsubprojects. The two subprojects are found to be financially viable, but will require operational \nsubsidies  to  attain  full  cost  recovery  (i.e.,  operation  and  maintenance,  depreciation  and  debt \ncoverage). At tariffs set to FIRR greater than WACC, FIRR for subproject Goychay is 4.5%, and \nfor subproject Nakhchivan, 5.5%, an average of 5.0% for the two subprojects.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n61 \n\nTable A9.7: Subproject FIRR \n(%) \n\nParticulars \n\nAverage \n\nSubproject \nGoychay \n\n Subproject \nNakchivan \n\nBase Case \nCapital Cost plus 20%\nO&M Cost plus 20%\nRevenue less 20%\n1-year Delay in Benefit\nSwitching Value - Capital Cost \nSwitching Value - Revenue \nAt WACC, Capital Cost variablea\nWACC = weighted average cost of capital \naCapital cost may increase by this variable and still remain within WACC.\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n5.0\n3.7\n4.5\n2.9\n4.0\n40.0\n23.8\n50.3\n\n4.5\n3.2\n4.2\n2.6\n3.6\n32.3\n21.6\n36.5\n\n5.5\n4.2\n4.8\n3.2\n4.5\n47.8\n26.1\n64.0\n\n \n24. \nConclusion. Analysis findings indicate that the subproject JSCs are financially viable on \ntwo  conditions:  (i)  required  periodic  tariff  increases  (herein  assumed  every  2  years),  and  (ii) \nviability  gap  funding  for  full  cost  recovery  within  consumer  affordability  levels.  For  these \nconditions  to  be  relevant  to  the  succeeding  subprojects,  they  must  be  incorporated  when \npreparing  the  financial  reform  operational  plans.  These  reform  plans  and  related  issues  have \nbeen  discussed  with  and  agreed  to  by  AZERSU,  State  Amelioration  and  Water  Management \nAgency (SAWMA), and other pertinent government agencies with the aim of achieving financial \nsustainability  of  the  overall  investment.  Issues  pertaining  to  subsidization,  manner  of \nimplementation,  and  funds  sourcing  are  specifically  relevant.  Income  affordability  is  a  major \nfactor  in  determining  subsidy  requirement,  and  thus  the  household  income  base  must  be \nreviewed periodically. \n\n \n\n\f62  \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry/Project Title: Azerbaijan/Water Supply and Sanitation Investment Program \n\nLending/Financing \nModality:  \n\nMultitranche Financing Facility \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision \n\nCentral and West Asia Department \nUrban Services Division \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nAn  8-year,  $600  million  program  under  a  multitranche  financing  facility,  the  Investment  Program  will  fund  basic  urban \ninfrastructure  improvements  in  secondary  towns  within  Azerbaijan  and  the  Nakhchivan  Autonomous  Republic.  The \ninvestments  in  water  supply  and  wastewater  infrastructure,  along  with  institutional  reforms  and  capacity  development \ninitiatives  to  improve  service  delivery,  are  consistent  with  the  key  strategic  goals  of  Azerbaijan\u2019s  state  program  on  poverty \nreduction and sustainable development.a The Investment Program will uphold the state program\u2019s goals by improving public \ninfrastructure, developing sustainable environmental management, and improving public administration and good governance. \nThe Investment Program also aims to reduce the 13% poverty level in the towns in conjunction with the state program target \ngoals of an overall poverty level of 8% and extreme poverty elimination by 2015. Also, in accordance with the state program, \nthe Investment Program will promote the participation and employment of women in decision-making roles ranging from local \nto executive levels and will reduce the gap in indicators for female and male employment. \n \nThe Investment Program will focus on providing approximately 500,000 persons with access to improved water and sanitation \nservices.  With  direct  access  to  basic  services,  the  poor  in  the  region  will  be  able  to  productively  use  the  available  time  in \ngainful  employment,  thereby  alleviating  poverty  levels.  Improvements  in  the  quality  of  water  and  disposal  of  treated \nwastewater will lead to public health improvements and reductions in the burden of waterborne diseases, treatment costs, and \nproductive losses, the impact of which is predominantly felt by the poor. Women, especially poor women, will benefit from the \nreduction  in  the  time  and  energy  spent  in  fetching  and  storing  water,  and  in  the  work  associated  with  cleaning  and  family \nhealth care. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                 Targeting Classification: General Intervention \nPoverty remains relatively high in Azerbaijan. According to a 2008 speech given by the chairperson of statistics, on the basis \nof  consumption  per  capita,  an  estimated  13.2%  of  the  population  lives  below  the  poverty  line  and  2.0%  live  in  extreme \npoverty. However, in 2003, the poverty level was 45.0% while the extreme poverty level was 9.6%. The national poverty line is \nestimated as the cost of a minimum consumption basket, calculated on the basis of per capita monthly minimum consumption \nnorms.  The  unit  of  observation  for  poverty  statistics  is  the  individual.  Analysis  of  house  budget  survey  data  for  2002\u20132005 \nshows that there is a small difference in the poverty rates for urban and rural areas. The exception is between Baku and the \nrest of the country; the poverty incidence Baku has been declining at a faster rate than for the rest of the population. There \nare  also  regional  differences  in  poverty  levels,  with  the  Nakhchivan  Autonomous  Republic  and  Upper  Shirvan  having  the \nhighest levels. Furthermore, internally displaced persons (refugees) have higher poverty levels than the rest of the population. \nIn  2007,  the  average  poverty  incidence  among  these  persons  was  37%  (compared  to  16%  for  the  country).  The  highest \npoverty incidence among internally displaced persons in 2003 was observed in rural settlements (61%), while in urban areas, \nthe poverty level for internally displaced persons was approximately 42%. In contrast, there are no significant differences in \nthe poverty levels for men and women. \n\nTo deal with poverty issues, approximately 30 types of social benefits for 13 categories of vulnerable groups are included in \nAzerbaijan\u2019s  poverty  alleviation  programs.  These  programs  were  created  under  the  Law  of  the  Republic  of  Azerbaijan  on \nSocial Benefits (2006). \n\nThere  is  a  significant  level  of  uneven  economic  development  in  Azerbaijan.  The  wealthiest  10%  of  the  population  control \n29.5% of the wealth, while the poorest 10% control only 3.1%. The wealth was originally attributed to the booming oil industry. \nHowever,  the  recorded  share  of  the  non-oil  sector  in  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  2008  was  approximately  50%.  The \nGDP has remained relatively high in spite of the global economic crisis. The GDP real growth rate for Azerbaijan was 15.6% \nin 2008, and its economic growth is reflected in its low unemployment rate of 6.5% (2007). The GDP rates were 26%, 35%, \nand 24%, respectively, in 2005, 2006, and 2007. Poverty has responded strongly to economic growth\u2014in the past 4 years, \noverall poverty has fallen by 16%, a 4% decrease. \n\na Republic of Azerbaijan. 2008.

Findings of Social Analysis  \nThe  average  monthly  household  income  for  2007  in  rural  and  urban  areas  was  AZN110  ($136).  As  of  2008,  the  minimum \nsalary  wage  per  month  was  AZN60  ($74).  The  2007  unemployment  rate  for  Azerbaijan  was  6.5%,  with  more  women \nregistered  as  unemployed.  In  program  towns,  the  majority  of  men  work  in  agriculture,  while  the  women  work  in  lower-paid \npublic sectors including teaching, medicine, and nursing. There is a relatively decent representation of health care and school \nfacilities within the project towns. \n\nIn  Azerbaijan,  approximately  60%  of  the  Baku\u2013Absheron  region  and  46.5%  of  the  towns  and  villages  have  access  to  an \nuninterrupted,  good-quality  water  supply.  In  program  towns,  approximately  35%  of  the  towns  have  access  to  a  piped  water \nsupply system. Of the percentage of people that have water supply, none receive a continuous 24-hour supply, some lacking \nwater for several days. On average, 35% of people obtain water from water trucks, and 18% must walk to water sources with \ndistances ranging from 150 meters to a maximum of 3 kilometers. Water sources other than water trucks include standpipes \nand private wells. About 75% of the population is dissatisfied with the water quality and pressure. Between 3% and 23% have \nfallen ill with short-term stomach sicknesses due to poor-quality water within program towns. \n\nWithin  the  towns  surveyed,  15%  of  the  population  has  sewage  collection.  Most  households  use  pit  latrines  and  some  use \nseptic tanks, which often overflow. Also, households discharge sewage directly to the roadside channels that line the streets \nand flow through the towns. During periods of rain, sewage overflows into the streets and on public property. Also, there are \nmany blockages and overflows that often affect residential areas. Approximately 85% of respondents surveyed have sewage \nproblems on their property. There is currently no  wastewater treatment in most towns. Although in many towns, there  were \nplans to build conventional wastewater treatment plants during Soviet times, the plants were never constructed.  \n\nWater  was  perceived  as  the  highest  priority  for  all  the  towns  surveyed;  sanitation  in  all  towns  was  also  recognized  as  a \npriority.  The  general  awareness  of  sanitary  standards  is  lacking  in  the  towns.  Many  surveyed  did  not  realize  that  the  open \nsewage channels were linked with malaria and other waterborne diseases. \n\nAbout 45%\u201380% of locals were willing to pay for a 24-hour, good quality water supply and sanitation collection services. Most \nwould  be  willing  to  pay  AZN2.0\u2013AZN5.5  ($2.50\u2013$6.80)  per  month  for  water  supply  or  according  to  what  the  water  meter \nreads.  Similarly,  most  would  be  willing  to  pay  AZN5.0  ($6.20)  per  month  for  wastewater  collection.  They  were,  therefore, \nwilling to pay a maximum of approximately 10% of their salaries for basic water and wastewater services. \n\nThe  potential  primary  beneficiaries  of  the  Investment  Program  are  the  urban  populations  of  towns.  The  urban  populations \ninclude refugees and displaced persons. Between 100 and 6,000 refugees and 20 to 1,600 internally displaced persons have \nresidence in the project towns. Under the Investment Program, basic services will be provided to all refugees and internally \ndisplaced  persons.  The  Investment  Program  will  also  provide  an  opportunity  to  strengthen  the  role  of  women  in  the \ncommunity, thereby raising their status. It is expected that women will become empowered by being involved in the local town \nwater users\u2019 associations and in decision-making positions within the implementing and executing agencies. The Investment \nProgram  will  also  lessen  the  burden  on  women  as  the  main  collectors  of  water  and  as  nurses  for  the  sick  affected  by \nunsanitary conditions. The subprojects will provide employment opportunities for residents, both in the construction or repair \nof water supply and sanitation systems, as well as in the management of the systems. Overall, time will be saved, and better \nhealth will improve the productive capacity of the whole population. \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.   Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n\nExtensive consultations have been undertaken with stakeholders, including project towns, nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs) and community-based organizations, elected representatives, administrative departments, rayon (town) \nadministrations, and representatives of various government ministries. Meetings, focus group discussions with NGOs, and \nstructured interviews were undertaken with stakeholders.  \n\n2.

Was a C&P plan prepared? \n\n Yes  \n\n No  \n\nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n\nExtensive  consultations  have  been  undertaken  with  stakeholders  including  affected  persons  (emphasizing  women  and  the \ndisadvantaged), beneficiary communities, NGOs and community-based organizations, elected representatives, administrative \ndepartments,  rayon  administrations,  and  representatives  of  various  government  ministries.  Meetings,  focus  group \n\n \n\n\f64  \n\nAppendix 10 \n\ndiscussions,  public  awareness  campaigns,  and  structured  interviews  were  undertaken  with  stakeholders  to  enable \ntransparency of project works and operations. To date, consultations were held with six sample project towns. The meetings \ninvolved  municipal  officials,  elected  representatives,  NGOs,  and  a  sample  of  randomly  selected  citizens  (of  which  at  least \n50%  were  female).  In  these  meetings,  mayors  and  project  engineers  familiarized  the  towns  with  the  designs.  The  towns\u2019 \nenvironmental  concerns  and  ideas  on  improving  the  water  and  sanitation  systems  have  been  analyzed  and  incorporated \nwhere  appropriate  into  the  project  designs  and  mitigation  measures.  All  towns  showed  interest  in  participating  in  the  town \nwater users\u2019 associations to liaise with the program management facility and administrative officials to address any water- or \nwastewater-related  concerns  or  issues.  All  public  consultation  notes  are  attached  to  the  initial  environmental  examinations \nincluded as supplementary appendixes. \n\nThe consultation and participation plan comprises three distinct components: (i) the community awareness and participation \nprogram, (ii) hygiene and sanitation education program, and (iii) training program. A major feature of the proposed institutional \ndevelopment and capacity building component includes enabling SuKanals (town water supply and sanitation agencies) and \njoint stock companies to take a more participatory approach to water supply and sanitation development and service delivery. \nImplementation support has been developed, including the provision of a social development specialist within the executing \nagencies and provisions supporting the creation of town water users\u2019 associations.  \n\nOngoing  consultations  and  participatory  monitoring  will  take  the  form  of  community  forums  or  focus  group  discussions \ncombined with annual surveys including disaggregated gender, internally displaced persons, refugee, and poverty surveys to \nnotice effects on women and the disadvantaged. The media for this public information mechanism will include local television, \nnewsletters, and community meetings. \n\nC.  Gender and Development \nKey Issues  \n\nWomen are most frequently the household members who are most affected by the lack of adequate, clean, and safe water. \nAdult  women  are  the  main  collectors  of  water  when  there  is  no  individual  house  connection  (in  approximately  65%  of  the \nhouseholds  for  the  project  towns).  As  such,  there  is  a  clear  need  to  ensure  women  are  involved  in  the  design,  monitoring, \nevaluation,  and  management  of  the  water  supply  and  sewage  collection  systems.  However,  in  most  towns,  women  are \nseverely  underrepresented  on  the  town  councils.  Currently,  the  share  of  women  working  on  the  municipal  decision-making \nlevel is only 4.08%. Public consultation meetings indicated that women expressed a clear desire to play a more central role in \nthe planning and management of the water and wastewater system planning and implementation.  \n \nUnder  the  gender  action  plan,  women  will  constitute  at  least  one  third  of  the  town  water  users\u2019  association  representative \nbodies.  Also,  at  least  one  third  of  the  joint  stock  companies\u2019  board  of  directors  will  be  qualified  women.  The  Investment \nProgram includes available funds for the employment and training of women as well as a budget to promote public awareness \nof  gender  issues  by  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies.  Investment  Program  costs  also  include  hiring  a  social \nspecialist  and  NGOs  focused  on  women\u2019s  issues  (65  such  NGOs  currently  exist  in  Azerbaijan)  that  will  update  the  gender \naction  plan  and  prepare  annual  progress  reports  on  gender  impacts.  Furthermore,  the  5%  unemployment  gap  within \nAzerbaijan  in  the  indicators  for  women  and  men\u2019s  employment  will  be  reduced  by  employing  and  encouraging  the \nparticipation of women in positions on local and executive levels.  \n\nFurther planning for analyses on gender-sensitivity and gender mainstreaming in the program cycle will be determined based \non progress. It is planned to use monitoring and evaluation systems, which will generate gender-disaggregated information to \nenable the tracking of gender implications brought about by the Investment Program. \nKey Actions \n\nMeasures  included  in  the  design  to  promote  gender  equality  and  women\u2019s  empowerment\u2014access  to  and  use  of \nrelevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n\n \n\n Gender plan   \n\n Other actions/measures   \n\n No action/measure \n\nThe Investment Program responds to the key issues above in the design of its subprojects.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n65 \n\nPlan or Other Measures \nIncluded in Design \n\n   Full Plan \n   Short Plans \n   Resettlement Framework \n   No Action \n   Plan \n   Other Action \n  \n\nIndigenous Peoples \nFramework \n\n   No Action \n   Plan \n   Other Action \n   No Action \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nIssue \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement \n\nNo impact. \n \n\nIndigenous Peoples \n\nNo impact.  \n\nStrategy to Address \nIssue \n\nSubprojects involving \ninvoluntary resettlement \nwill be addressed through \nresettlement plans. \n \n\nNo job loss will occur.

With  AZERSU  and  the  State \nAmelioration  and  Water  Management  Agency  (SAWMA)  as  executing  agencies  (EAs),  the \nAzerbaijan Water Supply and Sanitation Investment Program (the Investment Program) will be \nfinanced  through  a  multitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  involving  five  tranches.  The  tranche  1 \nproject  for  which  details  have  been  finalized  aims  to  improve  water  supply  and  sanitation \nfacilities  in  the  towns  of  Goychay  and  Nakhchivan.  No  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is \nrequired  for  the  tranche  1  project.  If  any,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  for \nsubsequent  tranches  are  expected  to  be  minimal.  To  address  this  possibility,  the  EAs  have \ndeveloped a land acquisition and resettlement framework, which is summarized below.  \n\nB. \n\nGeneral Procedures \n\n2. \nLand acquisition and resettlement will follow the existing laws of the Government, ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  and  Operations  Manual  section  on  involuntary \nresettlement.1 The MFF, each tranche appraisal, and the approval and implementation of each \ntranche project with land acquisition and resettlement issues will require the preparation of   \n\na land acquisition and resettlement framework to be reviewed\u2014and if necessary \nupdated\u2014and then submitted for ADB approval at the start of the preparation of \neach tranche after the first; \nan  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment  indicating,  for  each  tranche,  whether \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  occur,  and  if  so,  expected  impacts,  type, \nand magnitude; \na  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  to  be  updated,  if  necessary,  based  on \ndetailed  design  for  each  subproject  with  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nimpacts.2 \n\n \n3. \nwill follow these land acquisition and resettlement-related conditions.  \n\nThe  MFF  and  each  tranche  appraisal  comprising  project  approval  and  implementation \n\nMultitranche financing facility and first tranche appraisal. Conditional to the \npreparation  of  (a)  a  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  for  the  MFF \napproved  by  ADB  and  EAs;  and  (b)  implementable  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement plans approved by ADB and EAs for all tranche 1 subprojects with \nland acquisition and resettlement impacts (if any). \nPeriodic financing request approval for successive tranches. Conditional to \n(a)  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  review  and  update;  and  (b) \npreparation of an implementable land acquisition and resettlement plan approved \nby  ADB  and  EAs  and  consistent  with  the  revised  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement \nland  acquisition  and \nfor  each  subproject  with \nresettlement impacts. \n\nframework \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2006. Operations Manual. OM F2: Involuntary Resettlement. Manila. \n2  As  noted  in  the  ADB  Operations  Manual  section  on  involuntary  resettlement,  the  details  and  complexity  of  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  plans  depend  on  impact  severity.  If  impacts  are  severe  (more  than  200  affected \npersons resettled or with more than 10% income losses), a subproject is classified as category A and a full plan is \nto be prepared. If impacts are non-severe (less than 200 affected persons resettled or with less than 10% income \nlosses), a subproject is classified as category B and only a short plan is to be prepared. \n\n \n\n\f70  \n\nAppendix 12  \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nCivil  works  contract  awards  signing.  Conditional  to  the  preparation  of  an \nimplementable  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans  approved  by  ADB  and \nEAs and consistent with the land acquisition and resettlement framework. \nProvision of notice to proceed to contractors. Conditional to full land acquisition \nand  resettlement  plan  implementation  (full  delivery  of  compensation  and/or \nrehabilitation provisions) for the relevant project. This condition will be clearly spelled \nout in the civil works contract. \n\nC. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement Framework \n\n \n\nleast  minimizing \n\nInvestment  Program  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  be  carried  out  based  on  (i) \n4. \navoiding  or  at \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement;  (ii)  compensation \nguaranteeing  the  maintenance  of  affected  persons\u2019  pre-project  living  standards;  (iii)  fully \ninforming affected persons of compensation options; (iv) supporting and using affected persons' \nsociocultural  institutions;  (v)  applying  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  provisions  equally  to \nwomen and men; (vi) not barring compensation and/or rehabilitation due to lack of a formal title; \n(vii)  paying  particular  attention  to  households  headed  by  women  and  vulnerable  groups;  (viii) \nexecuting  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  as  integral  part  of  a  project,  and  including  land \nacquisition and resettlement budgets in project costs; and (ix) providing full compensation prior \nto taking over acquired property.  \n \n5. \nare \n\nEligibility.

Affected persons settling in affected areas after the cut-off \ndate  will  not  be  eligible.  They,  however,  will  be  given  sufficient  advance  notice  to  vacate \npremises  or  dismantle  affected  structures  prior  to  project  implementation.  Their  dismantled \nstructures will not be confiscated, and they will not be fined or sanctioned. \n \nEntitlements.  Entitlements  for  affected  persons  losing  land,  houses,  or  income; \n7. \nrehabilitation subsidies for land, house and building, crops and trees, and business and income \nlosses;  and  cash  allowances  for  relocation  will  be  provided  to  severely  affected  persons  and \nvulnerable affected persons.

AZERSU has overall responsibility for all aspects of the \nInvestment  Program,  although  SAWMA  will  be  responsible  for  the  Investment  Program  in \nNakhchivan.  The  AZERSU  program  management  facility3 is  tasked  with  day-to-day  program \nmanagement,  including  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  interagency  coordination.  The \nsafeguards  unit  at  the  program  management  facility  is  directly  responsible  for  land  acquisition \nand  resettlement-related  planning,  implementation,  interagency  coordination,  and  monitoring. \nHowever,  it  will  carry  out  this  responsibility  with  assistance  from  consultants  and  the  active \nparticipation  of  the  rayon  (town)  executive  powers  and  the  State  Land  and  Cartography \nCommittee.  \n \nTo  provide  effective  interagency  coordination  and  officially  endorse  surveys  and \n9. \ncompensation  rates,  each  affected  rayon  will  establish  a  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \ncommission  with  members \nfrom  rayon  administration,  State  Committee  of  Land  and \nCartography, and State Real Estate Registration Service. This commission will have jurisdiction \nover  land  administration,  valuation,  and  acquisition.  At  the  national  level,  the  Government  will \nestablish a similar central commission, chaired by the State Committee of Land and Cartography. \nThis commission will carry out final land acquisition and resettlement plan reviews and approve their \nfinancing and implementation. \n  \n10. \nAll  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  tasks  will  be  carried  out  in  consultation  with \naffected  persons,  details  of  which  will  be  documented  in  the  plans.  As  an  appraisal  condition, \nland acquisition and resettlement plans and framework will be disclosed on the ADB website in \nEnglish, while they will be disclosed directly to affected communities in the local language. \n \n11. \nGrievances will be handled first at local level; then, in the absence of a solution, formally \nthrough  rayon  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  commissions;  and  finally  through  the  central \nland acquisition and resettlement commission. If the grievance remains unresolved, the affected \npersons may seek remedies through the appropriate court of law.  \n \n12. \nThe  program  management  office  will  internally  monitor  and  report  to  the  EA  on  land \nacquisition and resettlement implementation, and the EA, in turn, will report to ADB quarterly. In \n\n                                                 \n3 Functions indicated for Azersu are applicable to SAWMA for the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n73 \n\nthe  case  of  category  A  projects,  external  monitoring  will  be  assigned  to  an  independent \nmonitoring agency. Independent monitoring agency reports will be submitted to ADB prior to the \nimplementation  of  project  civil  works.  One  year  after  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \ncompletion,  the  independent  monitoring  agency  will  carry  out  a  general  evaluation  of  land \nacquisition and resettlement implementation. \n \n13. \nThe  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  states  that  each  resettlement  plan \nmust  provide  detailed  budget  and  implementation  schedules  linking  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement tasks with initiation of civil works. \n\n \n\n\f74 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nSUMMARY ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND REVIEW FRAMEWORK \n\nThe purposes of the Water Supply and Sanitation Investment Program (the Investment \n1. \nProgram)  are  to  provide  access  to  safe,  reliable,  and  sustainable  water  supply  and  sanitation \n(WSS) services for towns throughout Azerbaijan and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic and \nto  promote  a  healthier  environment  by  developing  proper  wastewater  collection  and  treatment \nsystems.  The  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  will  be  adopted  for  the \nInvestment  Program  for  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  of  future  projects.  These \nprocedures  have  been  developed  during  the  preparation  of  initial  environmental  examinations \n(IEEs)  for  core  subprojects  in  Agdash,  Agdjabedi,  Balaken,  Beylagan,  Goychay,  and \nNakhchivan  towns.  The  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  must  be  conducted \nfor projects to comply with the Azerbaijan and Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic Law on State \nEcological  Expertise  under  the  competence  of  the  Ministry  of  Ecology  and  Natural  Resources \nand Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003) of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB).  \n \nB. \n\nInvestment Program Review \n\n2. \nAfter  thorough  analysis  of  six  sample  subcomponents  of  projects,  the  Investment \nProgram  is  classified  under  ADB  guidelines  as  category  B.  A  screening  and  categorization \nprocedure  will  be  completed  for  each  new  project  to  ensure  that  the  potential  environmental \nimpacts will not change the existing categorization. Investment Program components comprise \nthree parts: (i) construction of source water intake, disinfection, and retention infrastructure; (ii) \nrehabilitation and extension of water distribution and sewage systems; and (iii) construction of \nwastewater treatment infrastructure.  \n \nC. \n\nImpacts and Measures \n\n3. \nThe  screening  process  carried  out  for  the  IEEs  identified  minor  possible  adverse \nenvironmental impacts likely to be caused by the Investment Program. Most potential negative \nimpacts  may  occur  during  construction,  including  noise,  dust,  traffic  congestion,  and  runoff. \nHowever,  these  impacts  will  be  temporary  and  can  be  mitigated  to  acceptable  levels.  Other \nimpacts from source abstraction and discharge into receiving water bodies will be mitigated by \nproper design. All potential environmental threats and respective mitigation measures are listed \nin the summary IEE (Appendix 14) and all subcomponent IEEs (Supplementary Appendix H). \n \nD. \n\nAzerbaijan\u2019s Environmental Assessment Laws and Institutions \n\n4. \nInstitutions.  There  are  four  principal  environmental  institutions  in  Azerbaijan  and  the \nNakhchivan  Autonomous  Republic  that  handle  water  resources  protection,  management,  and \noperation. These include (i) Ministry of  Ecology and  Natural Resources; (ii) Ministry of  Health; \n(iii)  Ministry  of  Emergency  Situations,  which  implements  construction  safety  supervision  and \nstandards and regulates safe sewerage discharges and WSS operations; and (iv) AZERSU and \nState Amelioration and Water Management Agency (SAWMA), which will manage WSS in the \nInvestment Program.  \n \n5. \nLaws.  The  most  pertinent  laws  within  Azerbaijan  and  the  Nakhchivan  Autonomous \nRepublic affecting water and wastewater infrastructure\u2014which have been incorporated into the \nenvironmental  management  plan\u2014include:  Environmental  Protection  (1999);  State  Ecological \nExpertise (1996); Water Code (1998); Water Supply and Wastewater (2000); Sanitary\u2013Hygienic \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n75 \n\nState  (1992);  various  water  quality,  air,  and  noise  standards;  GOST  (various  years);  the \nEuropean  Economic  Community  directive  for  wastewater  standards;  construction  norms  and \nregulations; and SNiP. \n \nE. \n\nEnvironmental Categorization and Criteria for Subproject Selection \n\nto  determine  whether  environmental \n\n6. \nAll  sample  subcomponents  reviewed  are  classified  as  category  B  under  ADB's \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines.  Category  B  specifies  that  an  IEE  is  required  for  the \nimpacts  warrant  an \nproject  or  subcomponents \nenvironmental impact assessment. If an assessment is not needed, the IEE is regarded as the \nfinal  environmental  assessment  report.  Within  Azerbaijan  and  Nakhchivan  Autonomous \nRepublic, environmental assessment and review frameworks must be in accordance with state \necological expertise. If an activity is assessed to result in more than minor potential impacts, a \nfull  environmental  impact  assessment  is  required.  Since  categorization  is  absent  under \nAzerbaijan  and  Nakhchivan  Autonomous  Republic  environmental  regulations,  ADB  guidelines \nwill be adopted for project categorization under the Investment Program. \n \n7. \nNo  category  A  projects  will  be  approved  under  the  Investment  Program.  The \nenvironmental  criteria  used  for  the  first  level  of  screening  will  exclude  all  subcomponents  that \nhave (i) any subcomponent located in strict nature reserves, (ii) any significant loss of primary \nforest  or  other  sensitive  wetland,  (iii)  any  permanent  negative  effect  on  a  known  rare  or \nendangered  species,  (iv)  any  significant  impacts  on  air  or  water  quality,  (v)  any  significant \nadverse  impacts  to  downstream  ecosystems  and  water  users,  (vi)  any  proposed  water \nabstraction  rates  beyond  Azerbaijan\u2019s  prescribed  value,  or  (vii) any  permanent  damage  to \ncultural relics. \n \nF. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment and Review Procedures \n\nState ecological expertise within the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources mandate \n8. \nan  environmental  impact  assessment.  The  basic  procedures  for  the  assessment  are \ndocumented  in  a  1996  handbook,  which  indicates  that  if  a  full  assessment  is  required,  the \nimplementing agency must submit associated documentation to state ecological expertise for a \n3-month review period. If the application is accepted, the implementing agency must provide a \nprogress report to state ecological expertise within 12 months of the decision. After approval is \ngiven, the construction works must begin within 1 year. \n \nUnder the ADB Environmental Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines, \n9. \ndeveloping an environmental impact assessment for category B projects involves submitting an \nIEE  and  developing  an  environmental  management  plan.

The  plan  defines  the  mitigation  measures, \nresponsible party, cost of mitigation, parameters to monitor, frequency of monitoring, time and \nlocation of monitoring, responsibility, and cost of monitoring. It must be adapted to the specific \nrequirements  of  the  project  in  question.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  review  subproject \ndocumentation ex poste and to gain access to the subproject sites if deemed necessary.  \n\n12. \nThe  consultants  will  prepare  a  contract-level  and  site-specific  environmental \nmanagement  plan  to  facilitate  tracking  of  their  performance  in  the  implementation  of  the \nmitigation measures. Also, the terms of reference for the consultants must specify supervision \nand  monitoring  of  its  performance.  The  consultants'  duties  include  updating  and  completing \nprogram details, responsibilities, and contingency to show progress on mitigation actions.  \n\n13.  Water  quality  monitoring  requirements  for  the  plan  are  in  accordance  with  GOST \n17.1.3.07-82  standards.  Control  on  water  quality  will  be  conducted  1  kilometer  (km)  upstream \nand 0.5\u20131.5 km downstream from the point of intake. Each borehole or infiltration gallery will be \nsampled  during  development  and  operation,  and  the  raw  water  quality  and  outlet  of  the \n\n \n\n \n\n\f78 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\ntreatment plant and reservoir must be monitored daily. During operation, intermediate points as \nwell  as  the  extremities  of  the  network  will  be  sampled  daily.  Test  for  both  free  and  residual \nchlorine and chemical and microbiological tests will be conducted. Control on water quality will \ncommence  at  least  3  months  before  construction  to  establish  a  baseline.  The  program \nmanagement  facility\u2019s  safeguard  specialists  will  be  responsible  for  conducting  periodic \nmonitoring.  \n\n14. \nAs  there  are  no  specific  wastewater  discharge  sampling  requirements  and  limits \nspecified  under  Azerbaijan  or  Nakhchivan  Autonomous  Republic\u2019s  regulations,  a  European \nEconomic Community directive (No. 91/271/EEC), has been adopted by the Ministry of Health in \nAzerbaijan and Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic within the environmental management plan. \nAccording  to  this  directive,  daily  samples  will  be  taken  at  a  well-defined  point  in  the  inlet  and \noutlet  of  the  wastewater  treatment  plant.  Under  the  Investment  Program,  a  third  sample  is \nrequired  to  be  taken  at  a  distance  downstream  to  determine  the  effect  on  the  receiving  water \nbody.  If  the  receiving  water  body  is  prone  to  eutrophication,  special  attention  will  be  given  to \ntotal  phosphorous  and  total  nitrogen  levels.  Depending  on  the  annual  number  of  samples,  a \nmaximum  number  of  exceedances  are  permitted  (excluding  extreme  events  such  as  heavy \nrainfall).  Stricter  regulations  are  required  for  effluent  being  discharged  into  canals  used  for \nfishing  purposes.  Sludge  will  be  reused  whenever  appropriate,  dewatered,  and  dried  before \ndisposal  to  a  Ministry  of  Health-approved  landfill  site.  The  specific  sampling  points  will  be \ndetermined  during  detailed  design.  The  wastewater  treatment  plant  operators  will  be \nresponsible for daily testing. \n\nI. \n\nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure \n\nAccording to Azerbaijan regulation, public consultation for any project has to be carried \n15. \nout twice\u2014first at the detailed design stage (to address all important comments) and then at the \nend  of  the  project.  All  stakeholders,  as  well  as  any  affected  persons,  must  be  present  at  the \nsecond public consultation. All environmental project documents must also be stored in Baku's \nAarhus Centre and filed at the project towns\u2019 public libraries.  \n\n16. \nADB  also  requires  public  consultation  and  information  disclosure  in  the  environmental \nassessment  process  for  category  B  projects  in  accordance  with  para.  7  of  its  Public \nCommunications Policy (2005). The information disclosure and consultation must be carried out \nwith  local  nongovernment  organizations  as  early  as  possible  in  the  project  cycle.  Public \nconsultation feedback must be disclosed to the public and attached as an appendix to the IEEs. \nAny grievance redress issues will be resolved according to the Program\u2019s land acquisition and \nresettlement framework. \n\nJ. \n\nFuture Subprojects  \n\n17. \nThe  frameworks  documented  herein  conform  to  ADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard policies as outlined in ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). A budget \nhas also been outlined in Table A13.2 to provide general costs for future project towns to gain \nthe capacity to follow these procedures. By adhering to this document and using the six sample \nsubcomponents as examples, future projects will be able to uphold the environmental and social \nstandards mandated by the Investment Program. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n79 \n\nTable A13.2: Environmental Assessment and Mitigation Costs to Investment Program \n \n\nEnvironmental Mitigation Item \nHiring national social and environmental specialists \n\nPreparing environmental assessment reports \nWater and wastewater monitoring cost \nCalculating source abstraction limits \nProtecting source from contamination \nInvoluntary resettlement issues \nPerforming environmental monitoring \n\nGood design of water and wastewater pipelines \nPrevention of unsafe water delivery \nDamage to soil, ecology, heritage, crops  \nPreventing construction pollution and wastes \nProtecting against soil and water contamination \nDust, air quality, noise \nProper waste disposal  \nTraining \nWorker health and safety \nWWTP operation \nChlorine handling and health and safety \nRepair of water, sewage, and metering systems \nO&M for water and sewer distribution networks; \nmaintaining pressures and detecting leaks \n\nInvestment Program Costs  \n$147,250 (two consultants for 30 person-months and one \n\nhydrogeologist for 2 person-monthsa, at 30 person-months) \n\n$10,000 \n$20,000 \nCovered by program consultants \nCovered by program consultants \nCovered by safeguards specialist  \nCovered by AZERSU or SAWMA experience and by hiring \n\nenvironmental specialist \n\nCovered by program consultants \nCovered by program consultants \nCovered by environmental and social specialists \n \nCovered by tender and contract documents  \nCovered by tender and contract documents  \nCovered by tender and contract documents  \n \nCovered by tender and contract documents  \nTraining provided by contractor and vendor \nTraining provided by contractor and vendor \n$100,000 \n$100,000 \n\n$377,250 \n\nTotal \n\n2 months. \n\nAzerSu  =  AzerSu  Joint  Stock  Company;  SAWMA  =  State  Amelioration  and  Water  Management  Agency;  WWTP  = \nwastewater treatment plant \na  For  the  Agdash  and  Goychay  well  developments,  an  additional  $4,750  is  required  to  hire  a  hydrogeologist  for   \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank; AZERSU Joint Stock Company; State Amelioration and Water Management Agency.\n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n80 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n\nThis  summary \n\n(IEE)  analyzes \n\ninitial  environmental  examination \n\nthe  potential \n1. \nenvironmental  impacts  and  mitigation  measures  associated  with  the  Azerbaijan  Water  Supply \nand  Sanitation  Investment  Program  (the  Investment  Program)\u2014specifically,  based  on  IEE \nreports  for  two  subprojects  under  the  tranche  1  project,  water  and  wastewater  infrastructure \nimprovements.  The  Investment  Program  is  classified  under  Asian  Development  (ADB) \nguidelines as category B. According to ADB policy for category B projects, an IEE is required as \nthe first stage in developing an environmental impact assessment. The Republic of Azerbaijan \nLaw on State Ecological Expertise (also adopted by the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic) also \nrequires infrastructure upgrading projects to be subjected to environmental assessment. \n \n2. \nIEEs have been prepared for two subproject towns (Goychay and Nakhchivan) under the \ntranche  1  project.  No  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  were  noted  in  these \nsubprojects, and identified minor environmental impacts can be readily mitigated using sensible \ndesign  and  construction  contract  and  management  measures.  Implementation  of  these \nsubprojects  will  be  subject  to  IEE  approval  by  Azerbaijan\u2019s  Ministry  of  Ecology  and  Natural \nResources (MENR) and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic\u2019s MENR. \n\nB. \n\nDescription of the Investment Program \n\n3. \nWater supply to consumers in the program towns is intermittent and of limited quantity. \nWater  quality  is  poor  and  contains  high  levels  of  silt.  Many  consumers  purchase  water  from \nprivate  vendors  to  augment  their  supply.  Similarly,  sewage  systems  are  failing,  and  pipes  are \nclogged and broken. During heavy rains, raw sewage floods the streets and house compounds, \nand  existing  treatment  facilities  fail  to  operate.  Approximately  35%  and  15%  of  the  existing \npopulation is connected to the water supply and sewage collection systems, respectively. \n \n4. \nInvestment Program components comprise three parts: (i) construction of source water \nintakes,  disinfection,  and  retention  infrastructure;  (ii)  rehabilitation  and/or  construction  of  water \nsupply  and  sanitary  collection  systems;  and  (iii)  construction  of  wastewater  treatment \ninfrastructure. Proposed subproject components under the tranche 1 project are listed in Table \nA14.1. \n \n\nTable A14.1: Proposed Construction Works for Sample Subprojects \n\nItem  Proposed Construction Works \n\n1  New reservoir(s) \n\n2  New water trunk main to town network \n3  New water supply network \n4  New wastewater collection network \n\nGoychay \n\n1 X 500 m3 \n1 X 1000 m3 \n-\n108 km\n98.5 km\n\nNakhchivan \n1 X 10,000 m3\n\n7.5 km\n22 km\n33 km\n\nkm = kilometer; m3 = cubic meter. \nSource:  Asian  Development  Bank;  AZERSU  Joint  Stock  Company;  State  Amelioration  and  Water \nManagement Agency estimates. \n\nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n5. \nGoychay  is  located  at  an  average  altitude  of  150  meters.  The  average  annual \ntemperature  is  14  degrees  Celsius  (\u00b0C),  and  the  annual  average  precipitation  level  is \n\n \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                           Appendix 14  \n\n81\n\napproximately 400 millimeters. The town of Nakhchivan is located at an altitude of 1,000 meters. \nThe  average  summer  and  winter  temperatures  are  28\u00b0C  and  \u20135\u00b0C,  respectively.  The  average \nannual precipitation is 270 millimeters. \n \nThe water supply for Goychay currently comes from river infiltration galleries, which were \n6. \nconstructed about 45 years ago. The town also uses supplementary boreholes; however, these \nwells have insufficient capacity. Due to floods, the infiltration galleries have been destroyed, and \nthe water quality is poor. These galleries are also located in the environmentally sensitive and \nprotected area of Turyanchay State Nature Reserve. There is, however, a sufficient supply from \nexisting well sites used by Goychay if new wells are constructed at deeper depths.  \n \n7. \nNakhchivan extracts infiltration gallery water from the Nakhchivan River floodplain area \nto feed the town. The river source has sufficient supply, is relatively pristine, and will continue to \nbe used after improved galleries are built to withstand flood conditions and to filter turbid water \nat  flood  times.  Also,  the  Heydar  Aliyev  Water  Reservoir  has  recently  been  constructed \nupstream,  which  will  enable  flood  control,  sedimentation  of  turbid  water,  and  a  more  constant \nflow  rate.  In  Nakhchivan,  local  households  have  also  built  keherises  (shallow  wells),  which \ncannot  continue  to  be  used,  because  many  have  collapsed  or  have  been  contaminated  by \nsewage.  Similarly,  several  boreholes  within  the  town  can  no  longer  be  used,  because  their \ncapacity is not sufficient to supply the entire town. \n \n8. \nThe  towns\u2019  most  prevalent  water  quality  problems  are  the  deterioration  of  existing \nsewage collection and treatment systems, and high silt content in the source water due to the \ndeterioration  of  existing  infiltration  galleries.  Currently,  sewage  is  collected  in  open  channels, \nposing  serious  health  risks.  With  the  Investment  Program,  designs  include  effective  treatment \nmeasures;  however,  the  Nakhchivan  source  should  be  filtered  and  softened  as  well  as \nchlorinated.  All  towns  will  have  new  reservoirs  constructed  and  some  rehabilitated.  Improved \nchlorination facilities will be built at all reservoir sites. New wastewater treatment facilities will be \nconstructed in all towns, as existing treatment plants were either never fully constructed or not \nmaintained. New water supply and sewage collection lines also need to be constructed due to \nsignificant  leaks.  Existing  asbestos  concrete  pipes  will  be  left  undisturbed  due  to  the \nenvironmental risks of repair.1  \n \n9. \nThe  Investment  Program  includes  about  13%  of  the  population  living  in  poverty  within \neach town. The base of the district economy in Goychay is agriculture with cropping of grains, \ncotton,  and  fruit,  as  well  as  animal  breeding.  Nakhchivan\u2019s  economy  is  based  upon  small \nindustry, clothing, and tourism, as well as agriculture. The towns have sufficient educational and \nmedical facilities. Overall, populations are increasing in Goychay at an average rate of 1.0% and \nin Nakhchivan at an average rate of 0.5%. \n \nIEE  fieldwork  and  interviews  did  not  reveal  concerns  with  vegetation  at  the  subproject \n10. \nsites, as it is of low value and can be regrown or replanted easily. Although cultural sites such \nas cemeteries exist, no cultural, archeological, or heritage sites are expected to be affected by \nthe subprojects, as they have been avoided in the designs. If important archeological resources \nare  found,  the  water  or  wastewater  component  will  be  rerouted  or  moved  to  an  appropriate \ndistance away from the site, meeting Ministry of Culture requirements. Furthermore, although all \n\n                                                 \n1   Asbestos piping is dangerous to handle due to the risks of exposure to airborne asbestos fibers, which may lead to \ndiseases such as asbestosis and lung cancer. Working with asbestos piping requires specific protection measures \nin accordance with the National Asbestos Management Plan, 2006, Australia. \n\n \n\n\f \n82 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nsubproject sites are within 2\u201316 kilometers of a nature reserve, no program components will be \nconstructed within the reserves or will impose adverse impacts. \n\nD. \n\nScreening of Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n11. \nIdentified  negative  impacts  during  construction  are  moderate  in  extent  and  can  be \nmitigated.  All  potential  environmental  threats  and  respective  mitigation  measures  are  listed  in \nTable A14.2. \n\nE. \n\nInstitutional Arrangements and Monitoring Program \n\n12. \nThe  Investment  Program  will  be  executed  by  AZERSU  in  Goychay  and  by  the  State \nAmelioration  and  Water  Management  Agency  (SAWMA)  in  Nakhchivan  through  the  program \nmanagement  facility.  The  joint  stock  companies  will  develop  the  project  works  in  the  towns \nunder the guidance of the program management facility. A summary of the responsible parties \nand  their  respective  environmental  assessment  and  review  tasks  is  included  in  the  summary \nenvironmental assessment and review framework in Appendix 13. \n\n13. \nThe  environmental  management  plan  for  the  towns  defines  the  mitigation  measures, \nresponsible party, cost of mitigation, parameters to monitor, frequency of monitoring, time and \nlocation  of  monitoring,  responsibility,  and  cost  of  monitoring.  Procedures  for  conducting \nenvironmental  monitoring  are  detailed  in  the  summary  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework.  Water  quality  samples  must  adhere  to  GOST  17.1.3.07-82  standards.  Maximum \nallowable  wastewater  discharge  limits  are  defined  according  to  a  European  Economic \nCommunity directive, No. 91/271/EEC, which has been adopted by the Ministry of Health. The \nenvironmental management plan for all towns will be updated and expanded to include specific \nwater  and  wastewater  quality  testing  locations  and  procedures  during  detailed  engineering \ndesign. \n\n14. \nThe  executing  agencies  has  existing  capacity  and  knowledge  to  perform  water  quality \ntests  and  to  monitor  environmental  mitigation  measures.  The  organization  has  accumulated \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  management  and  mitigation  experience  through  current  and \ncompleted  water  and  wastewater  improvement  and  construction  works  throughout  Azerbaijan \nand Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The joint stock companies will be trained by AZERSU \nor SAWMA with water quality testing and environmental monitoring. \n\nA national environmental and social specialist will be hired to undertake capacity building \n15. \nfor  environmental  management  and  assessment.  The  staff  must  also be  trained  regarding  the \nrisks of wastewater treatment operation, construction, chemical handling, and specific water and \nwastewater  network  operations  and  maintenance  tasks.  The  budget  needed  for  these \nenvironmental tasks and typical mitigation measures is included in the summary environmental \nassessment and review framework and the individual IEEs in Appendix 13 and Supplementary \nAppendix H, respectively.  \n\nF. \n\nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure \n\n16. \nAccording  to  Azerbaijan  regulation  (which  has  been  adopted  by  the  Nakhchivan \nAutonomous Republic), public consultation for all subprojects has to be carried out twice\u2014first \nat  the  detailed  design  stage  (to  address  all  important  comments)  and  then  at  the  end  of  a \nproject when presenting subproject results. ADB also requires public consultation for category B \nprojects  where  the  Borrower  must  consult  with  groups  affected  by  a  project  and  with  local \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                           Appendix 14  \n\n83\n\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Public \nnongovernment  organizations  as  early  as  possible \nCommunications Policy (2005). Any grievance redress issues will be resolved according to the \nProgram\u2019s land acquisition and resettlement framework. \n\nFor  the  two  subproject  IEEs  analyzed  herein,  ADB  conducted  public  consultations  in \n17. \neach  town  between  April  and  August  2003.  The  social  assessment  process  included  project \nhousehold  surveys  (200  people  in  Goychay  and  400  people  in  Nakhchivan),  focus  group \nmeetings, local and executive stakeholder consultations, and informal interviews with vulnerable \nmembers  in  Azeri.  Information  gathered  included  (i)  the  frequency  of  delivery  of  water  and \ncollection  of  wastewater,  (ii)  water  and  wastewater  tariffs  charged  to  consumers,  (iii)  the \ncommunity\u2019s  willingness  to  pay  for  water  and  wastewater  services,  and  (iv)  if  town  members \nvolunteered to participate in the town water users\u2019 associations. Environmental concerns were \nnoted  during  public  consultations  and  have  been  incorporated  into  the  proposed  mitigation \nmeasures. The developments and timeline of construction was disclosed to the public.  \n\nG. \n\nConclusions \n\n18. \nThe  level  of  environmental  assessment  within  this  IEE  is  sufficient  to  indicate  the \nInvestment  Program\u2019s  impacts  and  to  outline  necessary  mitigation  measures.  No  additional \nstudies are required. The Investment Program is unlikely to cause any adverse environmental \nimpacts,  because  (i)  potential  negative  impacts  associated  with  the  design,  construction,  and \noperation of the subproject activities are likely to be temporary and localized in extent and can \nbe mitigated to acceptable levels using proven technology and management measures; and (ii) \nan  environmental  management  plan  was  prepared  to  ensure  environmentally  sustainable \nimplementation  of  the  subprojects.  Based  on  the  findings  of  the  two  subproject  IEEs,  the \nenvironmental assessment and review procedures, and the subproject selection criteria for the \nInvestment  Program,  it  is  likely  that  subsequent  subproject  environmental  assessment  will  not \nwarrant a detailed environmental impact assessment. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fTable A14.2: Summary of Environmental Impacts, Mitigation Measures and Responsible Institutions \n \n\nPotential Impacts \nDesign and Location \nSource Abstraction \n\nProposed Mitigation Measures \n \nPerform long duration pumping tests or wetted perimeter analyses to confirm abstraction limits during dry seasons \n\nProviding sufficient supply  \n\nConfirm river abstractions are not greater than 50% of flow (Water Code, 1998) \n\nSource Protection \n\nProtecting raw water pollution \n\nProvide a protection buffer zone of at least 100 m upstream of river intakes and 30 m surrounding boreholes, (Article \n22 of the Land Code, 1999), and restrict access.  \n\nCap the source to prevent entry of polluted surface water \n\nUndertake water quality and downstream BOD loading tests prior to scheme construction \n\nEquip wells with full water quality and drawdown monitoring devices \n\nRoute pipelines, preferably PE pipe, around environmentally and culturally sensitive sites  \n\nInstall shoring for trenches and improve drainage where necessary \n\nDamage to Soil, Land, \nEcology, Heritage, Crops and \nTrees \n\nReplace all vegetation destroyed if categorized under the Rule for Use and Protection of Trees and Bushes (2005) \n\nResettlement \n\nDesign installation of water supply pipelines in existing roads, footpaths or rights of way wherever possible \n\nInvoluntary resettlement \n\nConsult affected persons, prepare resettlement plans and provide adequate compensation and grievance redress \nmechanisms in line with ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2005) \n\nTreated Water Quality \n\nCover, ventilate and fence all treated water reservoirs \n\nSafeguard quality of treated \nwater  \n\nDesign of Sewer and Water \nPipelines \n\nDesign distribution network for minimum residual pressure of at least 10 m to prevent contamination or backflow  \n\nDesign disinfection units to enable one unit to be taken offline for maintenance without disrupting plant operation \n\nDesign elevation of water pipelines above sewer pipelines and in different trenches than water pipelines \n\nWater and wastewater pipes should be uPVC or HDPE on a sandbed \n\nIncreased Sewage Generation  Perform more detailed design calculations for the potential impacts of increased sewage generation \n\nConstruction \nAir and Noise Pollution, \nCongestion \n\nSludge will be recycled, dewatered and dried before disposal to a designated MOH landfill \n\n \nAvoid use of vehicles and equipment with excessive exhaust or noise emissions \n\nInstall silencers \n\nDo not burn waste on the construction site \n\nProvide secure material truck covers \n\nCarry out construction in sections \n\nHealth and Safety  \n\nInstall barrier fencing around construction site, provide road signs, control access of unauthorized persons to site \n\nProvide first aid and safety training to construction staff \n\n8\n4\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n4\n \n\ni\n\nResponsible \n \nPMO and/or \nPMF and \nJSCs \nPMO and/or \nPMF and \nJSCs \n\nPMO and/or \nPMF and \nJSCs \n\nPMO and/or \nPMF and \nJSCs \n\nPMO and//or \nPMF and \nJSCs \n\nContractor, \nPMO and/or \nPMF and \nJSCs \nPMF and \nJSCs \n\n \nContractor, \nPMO and/or \nPMF and \nJSCs \n\nContractor, \nPMO and/or \nPMF and \nJSCs \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fPotential Impacts \nConstruction Pollution \n\n \n\nProposed Mitigation Measures \nAdminister an initial retention fee to contractors for deposit and collection once they have cleaned-up and revegetated \nor covered exposed areas created during construction and disposed of materials properly \n\nOperation \nHealth and Safety \n\n \nTrain operators to handle chlorine powder, Install safety showers and eye wash stations near all chlorine equipment \n\nUndertake periodic inspections of electrical equipment,  training \n\nAsbestos piping will be marked and will be undisturbed due to the risk of exposure to airborne asbestos fibers.
