It  will  improve  maritime  facilities  in  the  three  outer  islands  of  Nukulaelae, \nNanumaga,  and  Niutao  as  well  as  strengthen  the  government\u2019s  capacity  in  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) and develop a transport sector master plan.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nRegional  context. Tuvalu is one of the smallest and most remote member countries of \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  Its  challenges  in  the  transport  sector  and  economic \ndevelopment  come  from  its  dispersed  geography:  (i)  the  country  comprises  nine  atoll  islands, \nstretching  over  680  kilometers  (km)  in  the  southwest  Pacific;  (ii)  it  has  a  small  and  dispersed \npopulation of 10,100 as of June 2016,3 with over 6,000 people in Funafuti, the capital, and the \nrest spread in the outer islands; and (iii) the population of the outer islands is decreasing as a \nresult of limited economic opportunities. Tuvalu is over 1,100 km away from Fiji and more than \n3,000 km  away  from  Australia  and  New  Zealand.  Internationally,  flights  to  and  from  Funafuti \ndepart  from  and  arrive  at  Suva,  Fiji,  twice  a  week,  and  a  commercial  cargo  ship  arrives  in \nFunafuti once every 3 weeks. \n \n4. \nGovernment  shipping  service.  Domestic  transportation  depends  entirely  on  the  two \ngovernment-owned  ships  operated  by  the  Ministry  of  Communication  and  Transport  (MCT), \nwhich continuously travel between Funafuti, the outer islands, and Fiji to provide lifeline support \nto people in the outer islands by transporting necessary goods such as food and fuel, as well as \ntransportation  to  people  who  need  social  services  such  as  medical  care  and  education.  This \nshipping service is critical for outer islands people, as the country has no other private shipping \nor civil aviation services. \n \n5. \nchallenges:  (i)  the  two  ships  operating  continuously  can  only  reach  each  island  once  every                 \n2\u20133 weeks;4 (ii) no outer island has a docking facility for the government ships, and passengers \nand cargo are transferred by small workboats between the ship and the shore; (iii) transferring \nbetween  the  ship  and  the  workboats  is  particularly  dangerous  when  the  sea  is  rough; \n                                                 \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  the  Outer  Island \nMaritime  Infrastructure  Project  (TA  8923-TUV),  and  a  project  design  advance  (PDA)  grant  for  the  detailed \nengineering design and assistance to the government for the procurement of civil works for the project and project \nmanagement (PDA 6003-TUV). Tuvalu is categorized a fragile and conflict-affected state. \n\nMaritime transport challenges. The government\u2019s shipping service faces the following \n\n3  Secretariat  of  the  Pacific  Community-Statistics  for  Development  Division  (PRISM  Project).  Population  Statistics. \n\nhttp://prism.spc.int/regional-data-and-tools/population-statistics (accessed 27 September 2016). \n\n4  These  ships  are  46\u201358  meters  in  length,  with  583\u20131,043  in  gross  tonnage,  and  carry  200\u2013300  passengers  and \n\ncargo. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n(iv) workboats need to pass through channels, some of which are dangerous when the sea is \nrough  or  too  shallow  to  use  during  low  tide;  and  (v)  except  for  Vaitupu,  Nanumea,  and \nNukufetau,  the  outer  islands  also  lack  docking  facilities  even  for  the  workboats.  In  the  past, \nserious  accidents  have  occurred  during  passenger  transfers  and  passing  through  the \nchannels,  resulting  in  loss  of  lives  and  economic  values.  Transfer  operations  cannot  be \ncarried  out  when  the  sea  is  rough  or  after  dark,  which  reduces  the  efficiency  of  ship \noperations. \n \n6. \nOn  top  of  these  challenges,  Tuvalu  faces  constant  and  increasing  threats  of  natural \nhazards such as tropical cyclones. For example, Tropical Cyclone Pam in March 2015 caused \nsevere flooding and erosion, and damaged maritime infrastructure in most of the outer islands. \nIn  Nukulaelae,  a  ramp  was  damaged  and  the  channel  was  silted.  In  Nanumaga,  a  ramp  was \nwashed  away.  In  Nanumaga  and  Niutao,  the  channels  were  blocked  with  boulders  and  sand. \nThe  government,  with  the  help  of  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  prepared  the \nTuvalu  Tropical  Cyclone  Pam  Recovery:  Vulnerability  Reduction  Plan.  Following  this  plan, \nvarious climate-proofing activities are ongoing in the country. At the government\u2019s request, ADB \nManagement  set  aside  $3.0  million  from  the  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  Disaster \nResponse  Facility  for  Tuvalu,  and  this  project  proposes  to  undertake  further  rehabilitation \nworks. \n \nThe  government\u2019s  priority.  The  Government  of  Tuvalu  places  very  high  priority  on \n7. \nimproving  access  for  the  outer  islands.  The  National  Strategy  for  Sustainable  Development, \n2016\u201320205 sets  out  the  government\u2019s  vision  to  make  maritime  transportation  more  efficient \nand  safer  to  (i)  enhance  economic  development,  especially  local  fisheries;  (ii)  improve \nlivelihoods  and  safety  conditions  in  the  outer  islands;  and  (iii) reduce  migration  from  the  outer \nislands  to  Funafuti,  which  is  facing  urban  problems  of  overcrowding,  pollution,  and  spread  of \ndisease.  The  government  has  requested  ADB  to  finance  the  proposed  project  given  ADB\u2019s \nrecent  experience  in  maritime  transport  in  the  Pacific,  including  Papua  New  Guinea,  Solomon \nIslands, and Vanuatu. The government is also seeking assistance from development partners to \ndevelop outer islands maritime facilities.   \n \n8. \nHarbor development approach. While the most efficient and safest transfer operation \ncan be achieved by building harbor facilities that can directly accommodate government ships, \nwhich  is  the  ultimate  aspiration  of  all  Tuvaluans,  the  construction  of  such  harbors  in  all  outer \nislands  is  estimated  to  cost  several  hundred  million  dollars.  It  is,  therefore,  necessary  to \ndevelop harbors in stages based on a long-term transport master plan. This will also help the \ngovernment to seek financing from development partners in a phased and prioritized manner. \nThe  government  prioritizes  Nukulaelae  as  the  first  island  for  construction  of  small-scale \nmaritime facilities, and Nanumaga and Niutao for minor rehabilitation of their boat ramps. The \nimprovement  of  transfer  operations  is  also  expected  to  help  Nukulaelae\u2019s  efforts  to  increase \nthe climate resilience of community infrastructure by making the transportation of construction \nmaterials  more  efficient.  This  is  timely  for  Nukulaelae  because  it  has  been  raising  all \ncommunity and private houses since late 2015 to prevent flood damage. \n \nThe total cost for physical improvements under the project is estimated at $10.2 million. \n9. \nWith  a  total  population  of  about  1,400  on  these  three  islands,  the  project  carries  a  high  per \ncapita cost. This reflects, in part, the significant remoteness premium involved in any investment \n\n                                                 \n5  Government  of  Tuvalu.  2016.  Te  Kakeega  III:  National  Strategy  for  Sustainable  Development,  2016\u20132020. \nFunafuti. As of May 2016, the Tuvalu Infrastructure Strategy and Investment Plan 2016 Update is being prepared \nbased on Te Kakeega III to replace the previous Infrastructure Strategic Investment Plan, 2011\u20132015. \n\n\fin Tuvalu because almost all construction materials and equipment have to be transported from \noutside the country. Nevertheless, without such investments, these communities run the risk of \nbeing increasingly cut off from the outside world. \n \nLessons from past projects. Some of ADB\u2019s maritime transport projects in the Pacific \n10. \nfaced  issues  such  as  delays  in  start-up  activities,  including  detailed  design  and  procurement, \ncost overruns, and difficulties in establishing satisfactory O&M arrangements. To prevent such \nissues under the project, the government has (i) established a task force at the project concept \ndesign  stage  and  a  project  management  unit  (PMU)  at  the  start  of  the  feasibility  study, \n(ii) established a deferred maintenance fund in 2015 to secure resources for O&M, (iii) used a \nproject design advance (PDA) to bring the detailed design forward and establish accurate cost \nestimates, (iv) prepared a procurement strategy to attract competent civil works contractors for \nbidding,  and  (v)  incorporated  an  institutional  strengthening  program  as  a  core  project \ncomponent.  \n \n11. \nADB  assistance.  Since  2008,  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  in  Tuvalu  have  focused  on \npublic  financial  management  (PFM)  with  policy-based  grants  and  technical  assistance.  With \nADB\u2019s  decision  to  increase  the  ADF  minimum  allocation  to  $6  million  per  country  from  2017, \nADB\u2019s operation in Tuvalu will expand to include vital infrastructure improvements. PFM aims at \nenhancing  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  public  spending  and  domestic  resource \nmobilization,  including  procurement  reforms. The  infrastructure  improvement program finances \ncapital spending. Through PFM, ADB is also assisting the authorities to develop and strengthen \ninfrastructure maintenance financing. To date, ADB has financed only one physical investment \nproject in Tuvalu for the education sector, which was completed in 2011. This project is ADB\u2019s \nsecond investment project for Tuvalu. It is well aligned with the Pacific Approach, particularly in \nstrengthening  connectivity  within  the  country,  strengthening  climate  change  resilience,  and \nimproving people\u2019s access to social services.6 \n \nExternal  assistance.  The  government\u2019s  request  to  ADB  for  supporting  outer  islands \n12. \nmaritime  transport  reflects  the  fact  that  most  other  development  partners  have  focused  on \ninvestments in Funafuti. No other development partners are involved in maritime transport. The \nWorld Bank has committed over $46 million in grants to Tuvalu since the country joined in 2010, \nincluding about $21 million to upgrade the international airport and $7 million to increase the use \nof  renewable  energy  in  Funafuti.  Japan  provided  about  $7.9  million  to  improve  the  Funafuti \nwharf,  completed  in  2009,  and  provided  a  total  of  $23.1  million  for  the  two  ships  delivered  in \n2002  and  2015.  New  Zealand  provides  Tuvalu  about  $10  million  per  year,  with  a  focus  on \nrenewable  energy  and  improving  climate  resilience,  water  supply,  and  the  borrow  pit \nreclamation in Funafuti. From 2008 to 2014, New Zealand provided assistance in outer islands \nmaritime transport. Australia provides about $7 million per year, with a focus on education. Most \npartners,  including  ADB,  have  worked  together  to  provide  policy-based  financing  to  assist  the \ngovernment\u2019s  reform  efforts  and  strengthen  PFM.  In  June  2016,  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme received approval from the Green Climate Fund to provide $36 million \nto strengthen coastal protection in three islands\u2014Funafuti, Nanumea, and Nanumaga. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n13. \nThe  impact  will  be  safe  and  efficient  domestic  maritime  transportation  that  helps \nincrease climate resilience of community infrastructure. The outcome will be improved maritime \n\n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2016. Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020.

The MCT will continue to be the executing agency for the project, which \nappointed its director of Marine and Port Services as project director in July 2015 on a part-time \nbasis  and  as  the  focal  person  for  project  management.  The  project  director  is  assisted  by  the \nPMU,  which  has  been  operating  since  March  2016,  with  three  individual  national  consultants. \nThese  three  consultants  financed  by  the  PDA  will  be  reengaged  by  single-source  selection \n(SSS)  of  individual  consultants  under  the  project,  as  the  MCT  has  confirmed  their  satisfactory \nperformance. The project director and PMU will supervise and provide counterpart support to a \nconsulting firm and a contractor who will be engaged under the project.  \n \n18. \nA project support and master planning consultant (including construction supervision and \ninstitutional strengthening) will be selected through SSS of the consulting firm that was engaged \nunder the project preparatory technical assistance and PDA in two separate contracts. The firm \nwas  selected  through  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  for  both  contracts;  it  has  been \nperforming satisfactorily and has had no integrity issue.9 The use of SSS is justified because (i) \nit is a continuation of assignments from detailed design and procurement assistance under the \nPDA  to  construction  supervision  and  institutional  strengthening  under  the  project,  as  these \nassignments are usually packaged together in ADB\u2019s projects where a PDA is not used; (ii) the \nexperience  acquired  by  the  PDA  consultant  amid  the  highly  limited  connectivity  to  the  outer \nislands  communities  will  create  a  seamless  and  efficient  transition  from  detailed  design  to \nconstruction  based  on the  consultant\u2019s  established  trust  and  confidence with  the  outer  islands \ncommunities; and (iii) the use of SSS will continue the consultant\u2019s professional liability with the \ndesigned facilities, avoiding misinterpretation of the design based on the surveys and analyses. \nAll  consultant  recruitment  under  the  project  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All  procurement  of  works  and  goods  will \nfollow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time).10 \n \nThe project will be implemented over about 4.5 years and is expected to be completed in \n19. \nDecember  2020.

All \nfacilities  are  being  designed  according  to  Australian  and  New  Zealand  technical  standards  to \nhave  a  design  life  of  50  years.  Climate  change  impacts  such  as  a  possible  sea  level  rise,  an \nincrease in wave height, or an increase in the intensity and frequency of tropical cyclones have \nbeen  analyzed  under  the  climate  risk  vulnerability  assessment  and  are  being  reflected  in  the \ndetailed design. The facilities are also being designed to minimize their impact on erosion and \nsiltation.  While  structures  made  of  concrete  and  steel  do  not  require  significant  maintenance, \nthe  new  channel  dredged  in  Nukulaelae  is  anticipated  to  require  maintenance  dredging  after \nevery major cyclone. Institutional strengthening of the government to enhance its O&M capacity \nis included under the project to ensure the sustainability of the project facilities. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n21. \nThe project will meet the basic needs of the people of Tuvalu, improve access to social \nservices  such  as  medical  care  and  education,  and  thereby  improve  the  livelihood  of  outer \nislands  people\u2019s  life.  The  improved  maritime  infrastructure  is  also  expected  to  help  promote \nfisheries  in  the  outer  islands,  which  would  improve  their  health  conditions,  increase \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fopportunities for economic activities, and reduce the poverty and inequality of the outer islands \ncompared  with  Funafuti.  In  assessing  economic  viability,  standard  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  is \ninapplicable in the case of this project. This is because the small population in the target outer \nislands yields disproportionately low quantifiable benefits relative to investment costs. Instead, a \nbasic needs or basic public goods and services provision perspective is more applicable, which \ntakes  into  account  that  the  without-project  scenario  would  negatively  impact  livelihoods  if  the \npopulation  is  unable  to  import  basic  goods.  Hence,  a  cost-effectiveness  analysis  is  used  to \nevaluate  the  project  from  an  economic  perspective.  A  cost-effectiveness  analysis  was \nundertaken for two locations in Nukulaelae: one on the north of the island and the other on the \nsouth. The assessment results suggest that the southern option is the most cost-effective. This \noption has the lowest capital and recurrent costs, and has the shortest travel time between the \nship  and  the  shore.  The  southern  option  is  also  expected  to  be  less  affected  by  the  current \nbetween the lagoon and the ocean. \n \n22. \nThe  government\u2019s  capacity  to  sustain  the  project  outputs  and  shipping  services  was \nassessed  as  adequate,  while  this  is  not  a  revenue-generating  project.  Passenger  and  cargo \nrevenues do not cover O&M of the shipping service, including the project facilities, but the MCT \nhas  been  satisfactorily  maintaining the  ships\u2014avoiding  any  major  troubles  during  operation  to \ndate. The major incremental O&M associated with the project will be the maintenance dredging \nof  a  new  channel  after  every  major  tropical  cyclone,  which  has  been  happening  about  every \n10 years. Notwithstanding this, budget for major maintenance will be allocated on a yearly basis \nto  ensure  sufficient  funds  are  available  when  a  cyclone  occurs.  For  this  incremental  major \nmaintenance  dredging,  which  is  estimated  to  cost  A$100,000  per  dredging,  and  other  O&M \nrequirements,  the  MCT  is  expected  to  have  sufficient  revenues  and  budgetary  allocations  as \nshown  in  the  financial  analysis.  It  is  also  developing  institutional  arrangements  to  improve \ntechnical  and  resource  capacities  for  O&M  under  the  project.  In  addition,  the  government  has \nbeen improving its asset management system with the help of development partners as part of \nPFM  reforms.  In  2015,  the  government  started  the  deferred  maintenance  fund  while  an  asset \nmanagement plan that will define how to use the fund has yet to be developed. The government \nand  development  partners  are  discussing  the  establishment  of  a  disaster  restoration  fund. \nThese  funds  are  expected  to  provide  incremental  funding  to  ease  the  government\u2019s  fiscal \nburden. Since the government shipping services provide lifeline support to the outer islands, the \ngovernment will continue prioritizing budget allocation to sustain the shipping services. Coupled \nwith  the  institutional  strengthening  activities  planned  under  the  project,  satisfactory  O&M \narrangements will be established covering financial, technical, and institutional aspects. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n23. \nFinancial management. A project financial management assessment was prepared for \nthe  MCT  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economic  Development,  which  indicated  the  overall \nfinancial  management  risk  as  high.  The  assessment  identified  the  following  key  risks: \n(i) inadequate  accounting  and  claiming  of  project  funds,  (ii)  incomplete  auditing,  (iii)  delayed \nrelease of the government counterpart fund, and (iv) no internal audit function. Mitigating action \nplans  were  discussed  and  agreed  with  the  government.  The  government  has  provided \nA$15,000  as  working  capital  for  PMU  operations,  the  use  of  which  will  be  reimbursed  by  the \nproject funds for eligible expenditures. The PMU will scrutinize all invoices from the contractor \nand  the  consulting  firm,  and  prepare  withdrawal  applications  that  MCT  management  and  the \nMinistry of Finance and Economic Development will review before endorsing to ADB. The PMU \nwill  prepare  a  single  set  of  financial  statements  covering  all  financial  resources,  using \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\faccounting  software. 11  ADB  staff  will  provide  capacity  building  for  ADB\u2019s  disbursement \nprocedure  and  financial  management  for  the  government  staff  involved  in  the  financial \nmanagement from time to time. The auditor general, who was notified of the start of the PDA, \nhas  confirmed  that  it  will  audit  the  project  financial  statements  in  addition  to  those  under  the \nPDA according to ADB\u2019s financial reporting and auditing requirements. \n \n24. \nProcurement  capacity. A project procurement risk assessment was completed for the \nMCT, the Central Procurement Unit (CPU), and other relevant offices. Overall, the procurement \nrisk  is  assessed  as  moderate.  This  improved  on  the  previous  assessment  of  high  risk, \nconducted before 2015, following the introduction of the Tuvalu Public Procurement Act (2013) \nand the Public Procurement Rules and Regulations, and the establishment of the CPU in 2015. \nTechnical  assistance  from  ADB  supported  this  legislation  and  institutional  strengthening.12 As \nthe  experience  of  implementation  of  new  legislation  and  the  CPU  is  limited,  further \nstrengthening is required. As one of the on-the-job training opportunities, procurement under the \nproject will follow the newly established procurement processes with the help of an international \nprocurement specialist under the PDA. ADB staff will oversee procurement activities under the \nproject to ensure good governance. \n \n25. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed  in  the  PAM  (footnote  7).  ADB  staff  will  provide  strengthened  oversight  works  and \ncapacity  building  assistance  during  project  implementation  to  mitigate  the  risk  of  fraud  and \ncorruption. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n26. \nThe  improvement  in  maritime  infrastructure  will  enhance  access  to  essential  services \nand economic opportunities among the outer islands communities. Safe and efficient movement \nof  people  and  goods  are  expected  to  increase  economic  activities,  particularly  among  small \nbusiness owners, and reduce migration from the outer islands to Funafuti. Poor and vulnerable \ngroups  such  as  women,  people  with  disabilities,  and  elderly  requiring  medical  attention  are \nexpected  to  benefit  the  most  as  they  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  the  safety  risk  of  lack  of \nharbor facilities in the outer islands. The project is proposed for effective gender mainstreaming, \nand  a  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  has  been  prepared.  The  GAP  includes  specific  features  to \naccommodate women\u2019s needs such as ensuring user-friendly design of the facilities and setting \ntargets  for  women\u2019s  participation  in  potential  employment  during  construction  and  awareness, \ntraining, and workshop activities. The MCT and PMU will implement and monitor implementation \nof  the  GAP.  Intermittent  international  and  national  social  development  and  gender  specialists \nwill be engaged to assist in implementing the GAP. Awareness activities on HIV/AIDS and other \ncommunicable diseases will be prepared and implemented during construction. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n\n27. \nSocial  safeguards.  The  project  is  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement  and \n(2009). \nindigenous  peoples \nConsultations  have  been  undertaken.

The government will establish lease agreements with the landowners, in accordance with \nthe accepted and long-standing process for accessing nongovernment land, where private land \nwill be required. The government will comply with the negotiated settlement requirements under \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  will  not  expropriate  any  land  if  it  fails  to  agree  with  the \nlandowner, and will comply with the negotiated settlement requirements under ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. The project is not expected to have adverse impacts on, or target any, distinct \nor  vulnerable ethnic  or tribal  group. The  project will  be  implemented  in  a  culturally  appropriate \nand  participatory  manner.  An  involuntary  resettlement  due  diligence report  has  been  prepared \nfor  the  project  recording  all  these  findings.  The  Land  Department  and  the  Ministry  of  Home \nAffairs and Rural Development have sufficient capacity to enter into the lease agreement for the \nproject  site \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Public \nCommunications Policy 2011, the report will be disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. \n \n28. \nEnvironment  safeguards. The project is category B for environment. The impacts are \nsite-specific, limited to the footprint of the small-scale harbor (including channel) and associated \nland-side  facilities  (Nukulaelae)  and  improvement  works  at  existing  sites  (Nanumaga  and \nNiutao),  and  can  be  mitigated  and  managed  to  acceptable  levels  provided  the  measures \nidentified  in  the  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  and  environmental  management  plan \n(EMP)  are  implemented,  and  subsequently  monitored  and  reported.  A  number  of  alternative \nlocations  for  the  new  channel  at  Nukulaelae  have  been  considered,  and  the  proposed  option \nprovides  the  most  suitable  from  an  environmental  (coastal  processes,  i.e.,  littoral  drift,  sand \ntransportation,  wave  climate,  and  marine  ecological)  perspective.  The  Department  of \nEnvironment within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Trade, Tourism, Environment, and Labor has \nadequate capacity to manage environmental issues with the consultant\u2019s support. The IEE and \nEMP will be updated during the PDA when further studies and detailed design provide additional \ninformation  (including  baselines);  existing  information  gaps  will  be  filled  at  this  time.  In \ncompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy,  the  IEE  and  updated  IEE  will  be \ndisclosed on ADB\u2019s website. \n \n29. \nThe  project  will  provide  resources  and  support  to  ensure  that  safeguards  are \nimplemented  effectively.  A  project  support  and  master  planning  consultant  will  include  an \nenvironmental specialist to support the PMU and the Department of Environment to ensure that \nenvironmental safeguards are properly implemented and to monitor the contractor\u2019s compliance \nwith  the  approved  construction  EMP  during  construction.  The  contractor  will  recruit  an \nexperienced  environmental  specialist,  with  expertise  in  marine  ecosystems,  to  prepare  the \nconstruction  EMP  (including  site-specific  plan  and  construction  methodology  for  temporary \nworking areas and/or platforms) and to monitor its implementation. \n  \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n30. \nThe  project  risk  is  assessed  to  be  high.  It  is  the  second  ADB  investment  project  for \nTuvalu; the first project completed in 2011 was rated partly satisfactory at completion. The root \ncause of the risks is Tuvalu\u2019s small population size and the limited number of government staff \nwho  have  experience  in  implementing  large  projects;  most  government  staff  are  also  heavily \nloaded with routine assignments. Against these risks, the project team has developed sufficient \npreventive mitigating measures with the government, as summarized in Table 4 and described \nin  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 13  The  integrated  benefits  and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the costs.  \n\n                                                 \n13 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nRisks \nProject implementation capacity. \nGovernment staff are restricted in number \nand have limited experience in implementing \nlarge investment projects. \nClimate risk.
