The  project  will  increase \ndomestic  energy  supply  and  international  electricity  trade,  improve  asset  management  and \nsector  planning,  and  strengthen  sector  operational  performance. 3 The  project  complements \nongoing  sector  developments  in  asset  rehabilitation,  system  loss  reduction,  tariff  policy,  and \nsector governance. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic  power  sector  is  characterized  by  ageing  assets,  high  commercial \nlosses, below-cost tariffs, and poor performance of sector companies. Power sector assets are \nover  30  years  old  and  approaching  the  end  of  their  economic  life.  This  results  in  reduced \nreliability  and  high  system  technical  losses  (15%  of  net  supply).    The  sector  also  suffers  from \nhigh commercial losses (15% of net supply), poor financial management and performance, and \ntariffs  that  are  below  cost  recovery.  Following  exceptionally  high  growth  in  domestic  demand \n(50%  from  2009  to  2013),  there  is  a  critical  need  for  major  rehabilitation,  replacement,  and \naugmentation of sector assets. \n \nThe government has identified development of the energy sector as a major component \n4. \nof  its  development  plan. 4  The  government\u2019s  strategy  is  to  (i)  improve  sector  financial \nperformance  and  corporate  management,  (ii)  increase  energy  security  by  development  of \ndomestic resources, (iii) expand regional power exports, and (iv) phase in cost-recovery tariffs \nby 2017.  \n \n5. \nOver $5 billion of investment in the generation and transmission subsectors is planned in \n2014\u20132024, including $4 billion of proposed commercial export-oriented HPPs to be developed \nby the private sector. While the private sector projects are under active development, financing \nis not confirmed. The project focuses on the immediate priority of ensuring domestic supply. \n \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The power sector consists of  two generation companies, EPP and Chakan GES; one electrical-grid transmission \ncompany, National Electrical Grid of Kyrgyzstan; and four regional electricity distribution companies: Vostokelectro \n(eastern  region),  Oshelectro  (Osh  and  Batken  regions),  Jalalabatelectro  (southern  Jalalabat  region),  and \nSeverelectro (Bishkek, Chuy, and Talas regions). \n\n3  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  the  Toktogul \n\nRehabilitation Project Phase 2 (TA 8434-KGZ). \n\n4  Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2013.  The Kyrgyz Republic Sustainable Development Program, 2013\u20132017. \n\nBishkek.  Approved by Government Resolution No. 3694-V on 18 December 2013.  \n\n1 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nEPP,  the  owner  and  operator  of  Toktogul  HPP,  wishes  to  implement  the  complete \n6. \nrehabilitation  of  the  Toktogul  HPP.    Toktogul  HPP  is  the  country\u2019s  largest  and most  important \npower  plant,  with  installed  capacity  of  1,200  MW.  It  produces  40%  of  the  country\u2019s  average \nelectricity output, and is critical both as a domestic power source and for power export; it also \nprovides  frequency  regulator  services  to  the  Central  Asian  power  system.  Toktogul  HPP  was \nplaced into service in 1975, and has undergone no significant rehabilitation. Critical equipment \ncomponents  are  failing,  resulting  in  availability  dropping  to  80%;  a  continued  decline  in \navailability  is  expected  in  the  absence  of  rehabilitation.  An  assessment  concluded  that  all  the \nHPPs on the Naryn Cascade require rehabilitation; rehabilitation of Toktogul HPP was identified \nas  the  highest  priority.5 Failure  of  Toktogul  HPP  would  affect  the  stability  of  the  Central  Asian \npower system and be catastrophic for the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s electricity supply. \n \nThe  complete  rehabilitation  of  Toktogul  HPP  is  planned  over  a  three-phase  program. \n7. \nThe  first  ongoing  phase  under  ADB  financing  covers  replacement  of  secondary  electrical  and \nmechanical  equipment,  which  was  identified  as  the  top  priority. 6  The  proposed  project \nconstitutes the  second  phase,  and  will  rehabilitate  two of  the four turbine  and generator  units. \nThe  proposed  project  is  included  in  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  country  operations \nbusiness  plan  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  2014\u22122016.7 The  third  phase  will  rehabilitate  the  two \nremaining  turbine  and  generator  units  and  will  carry  out  repairs  to  civil  structures  as  may  be \nidentified by an ongoing dam safety assessment study being financed by ADB. Each phase is a \nstandalone  project  that  is  independent  of  each  other.  The  three-phase  program  is  consistent \nwith ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \n8. \nOngoing  ADB  and  donor  projects  are  assisting  the  government  in  addressing  (i)  loss \nreduction  by  establishment  of  an  independent  electricity  settlement  center  and  installation  of \nwholesale  and  retail  meters;  (ii)  policy  reform  through  establishment  of  an  independent \nregulator, introduction of a cost-recovery tariff, and implementation of an information program to \ninform  the  public  of  the  need  for  tariff  increases;  (iii)  sector-wide  asset  rehabilitation;  and  (iv) \ncommercial  strengthening  of  sector  companies  through  improved  governance  and  business \nprocesses.  \n \n9. \nAdditional  sector  issues  to  be  addressed  to  ensure  sector  viability  include  (i)  poor \noperational performance of EPP because of deficient governance and management procedures \nand  practices,  and  inadequate  business  systems;  (ii)  absence  of  an  up-to-date  power  sector \nmaster plan leading to sub-optimal sector development; (iii) weak asset inventory and valuation, \nwhich  inhibits  financial  control;  and  (iv)  preparation  for  the  rehabilitation  of  the  180  MW  Uch \nKurgan HPP, the next priority project after Toktogul. \n \n10. \nTariffs  are  below  cost  recovery,  with  a  2013  weighted  average  consumer  tariff  of \nSom0.92  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh).  The  government  will  implement  a  phased  tariff  increase  in \naccordance  with  its  medium-term  tariff  plan,  which  will  increase  the  weighted  average  tariff  in \n2017  to  Som1.43/kWh.8 The  government  is  empowered  to  implement  such  a  tariff  increase \nfollowing  decisions  by  the  Parliament  (in  June  2014)  and  by  the  President  (in  July  2014)  to \ntransfer  tariff  approval  authority  from  Parliament  to  the  government.

The TA concluded that the entire \nplant\u2019s  electrical  and  mechanical  equipment  needed  to  be  replaced.  Considering  funding \nconstraints,  a  phased  rehabilitation  was  recommended,  with  the  first  phase  to  cover  priority \nauxiliary  equipment,  and  the  second  and  third  phases  to  be  done  on  a  turbine  and  generator \nunit  basis.  The  ongoing  Power  Sector  Rehabilitation  Project  covers  priority  common  electrical \nequipment.  ADB-financed  TA  for  preparation  of  this  project  recruited  the  same  international \nconsultant to conduct due diligence for  phase 2. The TA identified rehabilitation of turbine and \ngenerator  units  2 and  4 as  the  next  priority,  with  the final  third  phase  to cover  replacement  of \nturbine and generator units 1 and 3. \n \n23. \nThe project will replace turbine and generator units 2 and 4 and all associated auxiliary \nand control equipment and repair the existing hydraulic steel structures. The project benefits will \ninclude (i) increasing unit power output from the existing 300 MW to 360 MW, (ii) increasing unit \nefficiency  by  2.5  percentage  points  from  90.0%  to  92.5%,  and  (iii)  improving  availability  from \n80% to 95%. Life expectancy of the rehabilitated units will be 35 years. \n \nSuitable  replacement  equipment  is  available  in  the  international  market,  uses  proven \n24. \ntechnology, and is appropriate for Toktogul site conditions. The consultant will prepare technical \nspecifications  in  accordance  with  industry  practice  for  turnkey  contracts  to  (i)  design, \nmanufacture,  install,  and  commission  the  new  turbine  and  generator  units;  and  (ii)  perform \nrepairs  of  the  hydraulic  steel  structures.  Firms  qualified  to  perform  the  turnkey  contract  are \navailable in the international market. Training of EPP staff on operation and maintenance will be \nprovided by the turnkey contractor. \n \nThe climate change impact on the hydrology of the Syr Darya river basin, which supplies \n25. \nToktogul  reservoir,  has  been  assessed  under  separate  TA. 11  A  hydrology  specialist  was \nrecruited  to  assess  the  impact  of  climate  change  on  the  project  and  to  assess  reservoir \nsedimentation. The  specialist\u2019s  report  supports the Toktogul  HPP  rehabilitation  and  states  that \n(i) the reservoir and dam spillways can safely cater for water inflows that will first increase (due \nto melting of glaciers) and then decrease, (ii) average energy production will decrease by 11% \nover  the  next  40  years  (0.25%  per  year),  and  (iii)  sediment  transport  has  not  significantly \ndecreased the volume of the reservoir.  \n \n26. \nTo  ensure  complementarity  of  the  project  with  the  ongoing  first  phase  of  the  Power \nSector  Rehabilitation  Project  (footnote  7),  under  which  the  turnkey  contract  rebidding  is  in \nprogress, the scope of the first phase has been adjusted by (i) adding an underwater survey of \nthe  hydraulic  steel  structures,  to  allow  specification  of  the  work  to  be  done  under  the  project; \nand  (ii)  removing  the  generator  and  turbine  control  systems,  which  are  better  associated  with \nthe provision of the turbine and generator units in the project. \n\n                                                \n10 ADB.  2013.

The  project\u2019s  economic  viability  takes  into  account \ncost\u2013benefit streams resulting from rehabilitation of Toktogul HPP and operation over the life of \nthe  project.  The  incremental  benefits  come  from  avoided  outages  and  major  incidents  and \nassociated  repair  costs,  and  reduced  energy  imports.  Regional  economic  benefits  are  not \nincluded  in  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  calculations  because  they  accrue  to  countries \nother than the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \n28. \nThe financial internal rate of return is calculated at 9.1%, which compares favorably with \nthe weighted average cost of capital of 4.8%. Financial viability  was gauged by comparing the \nrevenue  and  cost  streams  of  \u201cwith-project\u201d  and  \u201cwithout-project\u201d  scenarios.  The  sensitivity \nanalysis indicates the project\u2019s economic and financial viability is robust even under unfavorable \ncircumstances. \n \nEPP\u2019s  financial  situation  is  critical.  Its  average  tariff  (Som0.28/kWh  in  2014)  is \n29. \ninsufficient to cover costs. Equity is forecast to be depleted by 2016. To ensure that EPP will be \nfinancially  sustainable  and  in  a  position  to  meet  its  financial  covenants  by  2019, 12  the \ngovernment  will  (i)  transfer  ADB  and  EDB  loan  and  grant  funds  to  EPP  through  50%  equity \ncontribution and 50% relending, (ii) waive taxes and duties on project-related expenditures, and \n(iii)  provide  at  least  60%  of  incremental  heat  and  electricity  sector  revenues  resulting  from \nimplementation of the Medium-Term Tariff Policy as additional EPP revenues. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n30. \nA  financial  management  assessment,  which  includes  a  risk  management  assessment, \nwas  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines.  While  the  country\u2019s  public  financial \nmanagement capacity is weak, EPP is an autonomous corporate enterprise with strong financial \nmanagement, accounting, and reporting systems. EPP has been implementing the first phase of \nthe  Toktogul  HPP  rehabilitation  since  2012  and  has  submitted  an  external  audit  report  for  the \nproject financial statements on time with no material qualifications. Consequently, the financial \nmanagement  arrangements  now  in  place  for  the  Power  Sector  Rehabilitation  Project  are \nconsidered  acceptable  for  the  project.  The  assessment  found  that  internal  control  could  be \nstrengthened and adherence to accounting standards and disclosure improved. A procurement \ncapacity  assessment  was  also  conducted  and  found  that  procedures  are  not  followed  and \ncapacity is weak. In order to improve corporate performance, improvements must be made to (i) \nfinancial management capabilities, internal control and auditing, and procurement capacity and \nprocedures. This will be addressed under the EPP business process improvement project. \n \n31. \nmeasures to: \n \n\nTo  ensure  good  governance  in  project-related  activities,  the  project  will  include \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\ninternational  consulting \n\nstrengthen the existing PIU and maintain separate project accounts by EPP; \nrecruit  an \nimplementation; \nestablish  a  direct  payment  procedure  and/or  commitment  procedure  for \ndisbursements to contractors and consultants; and \n\nto  provide  assistance \n\nin  project \n\nfirm \n\n                                                \n12 Debt\u2013service coverage ratio not less than 1 (by 2017) and 1.3 (by 2019), debt\u2013equity ratio (debt as a percentage of \nthe sum of debt and equity) not more than 75% (by 2017) and 70% (by 2019), current ratio of at least 1, and self-\nfinancing ratio of at least 20% (by 2019). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f(iv) \n\nensure the project accounts of each agency and corporate accounts of EPP are \naudited  annually  by  an  independent  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB,  in  accordance \nwith international standards. \n\nSafeguards \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n32. \nwith  the  government  and  the  EPP.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \n33. \nThe general population will benefit from a transparent, accountable, and efficient power \nsector.  During  power  cuts,  the  poor  are  disproportionally  affected  as  they  must  rely  on  more \nexpensive (non-electric) energy sources. \n \n34. \nThe project will not impact affordability or operational employment opportunities. During \nconstruction, the turnkey contractor will be required to ensure equal opportunities for all social \ngroups,  equal  pay  for  equal  work  regardless  of  gender,  and  prohibition  of  child  labor.  The \ncontractor  will  also  be  required  to  undertake  HIV/AIDS  awareness  activities  with  construction \nworkers. \n \nE. \n \nEnvironmental  assessment.    The  project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B \n35. \naccording  to  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  An  initial  environmental  examination \n(IEE) \nincluding  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  was  prepared  and  public \nconsultation was carried out. The IEE has been endorsed by EPP and disclosed in mid-August \n2014 on the EPP website. ADB has advised its no objection and posted the IEE on its website \non  8  August  2014.  The  IEE  will  be  updated  by  the  PIU  with  assistance  from  the  project \nimplementation  consultant  based  on  detailed  design  by  the  turnkey  contractor.  A  copy  of  the \nState Agency for Environmental Protection and Forestry approval of the IEE will be sent to ADB \nduring project detailed design. \n \n36. \nThe  main  environmental  impacts  of  the  project  include  (i)  occupational  and  health  and \nsafety  at  the  project  site;  (ii)  management  of  the  waste  oil  and  grease;  (iii)  disposal  of  scrap \nmetal  and  other  solid  waste;  and  (iv)  transportation  of  construction  materials  and  heavy \nequipment  to  the  project  site,  as  well  as  generated  waste  out  of  the  project  site.  The  EMP \nspecifies adequate mitigation measures and monitoring plans to cover these impacts. Released \noil and scrap metal will be safely kept at the onsite storage area, improvement for which will be \nfinanced  by  the  phase  1  loan,  for  use  throughout  all  phases  of  the  Toktogul  rehabilitation \nprogram.  EPP  is  responsible  for  recycling  and  disposing  of  oil  and  scrap  metal,  which  will  be \nperformed  by  licensed  companies  under  the  monitoring  and  supervision  of  the  project \nimplementation consultant (PIC) and PIU. \n \n37. \nThe  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  EMP  implementation  with  assistance  from  the  project \nimplementation consultant and staff of the EPP Service of Reliability and Safety department. An \nenvironmental and hazardous waste management specialist will be hired upon commencement \nof  the  construction  contract  to  work  for  3  years  in  the  PIU  to  build  EPP\u2019s  in-house  capacity. \nEnvironmental monitoring will be performed by the PIC. Monitoring results will be included in the \nproject quarterly progress reports and semi-annual environmental reports. \n \n38. \nThe costs of EMP mitigation measures will be included in the turnkey contract, and the \ncost  of  environmental  monitoring  will  be  included  in  the  project  implementation  consultant \n\n8 \n \n\n \n\n\fcontract. EPP costs for disposal of waste material will be covered by revenue from the sale of \nwaste material. \n \n39. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  as \ncategory C for both involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). The project investment will be implemented in the existing \nToktogul HPP, and land acquisition and resettlement impacts are not envisaged. The site where \nthe project is to be implemented has been in operation for 45 years. There are no outstanding \nsafeguard issues. The possible transport routes for equipment and machines were also found to \nhave no safeguard issues. The project is not expected to affect indigenous peoples as defined \nunder ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements for indigenous peoples. \n \nF. \n \n40.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.13 The overall assessment is that risks have \nbeen  identified  and  mitigated  and  that  the  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to \noutweigh the costs. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nWeak financial \nmanagement, internal \ncontrol, and risk \nmanagement. \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nThe government is implementing an action plan to reform the public \nfinancial management system. \nMOEI has mandated creation of an internal audit department in EPP. \nExternal audits will be required to meet international standards. \nSpecialist support will be provided to the project implementation unit. \nDirect payment procedures will be used for consultants and contractors. \nEPP governance and business processes will improve as ERP study \nfindings are implemented. \n\nCentral Asia power \nsystem ceases to operate \nand export markets \ncollapse. \n\nRegional cooperation and trade are supported by the Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation Program. \nExport markets are diversified through the World Bank-developed \nCentral\u2013Asia South Asia Electricity Transmission and Trade Project. \n\nDam integrity is being assessed through a safety assessment study that \nwill identify priority remedial measures. \nIncreased EPP tariffs will allow a higher maintenance budget. \n\nAn international consulting firm will be recruited to assist with project \nimplementation. \n\nDemand will reduce as tariffs are increased. \n\nFailure of HPPs on the \nNaryn cascade. \n\nDelayed implementation \ndue to weak procurement \ncapacity. \nContinued high growth in \ndomestic demand. \n\nReduction in losses does \nnot occur. \n\nA settlement center is being established, thereby increasing transparency \nand assisting in loss reduction.
