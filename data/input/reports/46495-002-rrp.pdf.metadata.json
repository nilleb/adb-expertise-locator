THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed \nadministration of a grant to be provided by the Strategic Climate Fund1 to Papua New Guinea \n(PNG) for Building Resilience to Climate Change in Papua New Guinea. \n \n2.  The project2 will support the implementation of PNG\u2019s Strategic Program for Climate \nResilience (SPCR) to (i) pilot and demonstrate approaches for integration of climate risk and \nresilience into development policies and planning; (ii) support the strengthening of capacities at \nthe national levels to integrate climate resilience into development planning; (iii) scale up and \nleverage climate resilient investment, especially by building on other ongoing initiatives; (iv) \nenable learning by doing and lesson sharing at the country, regional and global levels; and (v) \nstrengthen cooperation and capacity at the regional level to integrate climate resilience in \nnational and appropriate regional development planning and processes. This will be achieved \nby mainstreaming climate resilience into development planning in vulnerable communities in 21 \npriority vulnerable islands and atolls in the provinces of Bougainville, East New Britain, Manus, \nMilne  Bay,  and  Morobe,  which  have  been  identified through  a  participatory  process  using \nSPCR-identified  risk  factors  in  four  sectors:  infrastructure,  natural  resources,  health,  and \nagriculture.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  PNG  is  a  low  middle-income country  of  approximately  6.5  million  people  with  high \nvulnerability  to  volcanic  eruptions,  earthquakes,  tsunamis,  cyclones,  droughts,  and  other \nweather-induced  extreme  events.  Key  impediments  facing  PNG\u2018s  efforts  to  facilitate \ntransformational change toward climate-resilient development include (i) inadequate human, \ntechnical, and financial resources at all levels; (ii) limited knowledge of climate change risk \nmanagement;  and  (iii)  poorly  designed  infrastructure  that  is  vulnerable  to  climate  change \nimpacts. \n \n4.  Climate change could result in losses of up to 15.2% of PNG\u2019s gross domestic product \nby 2100 (under a business-as-usual scenario), with agriculture being the most affected sector.4 \nCoral reefs around the Pacific will be affected, with implications for recreational opportunities for \ntourism, coastal protection, habitat, nursery functions for commercial fisheries, and other goods \nand services. Some 4,500 kilometers of the total 17,100 kilometers of shoreline are expected to \nbe inundated, affecting up to 30% of PNG\u2019s population. Those most vulnerable to climate \nchange are the 2,000 coastal villages with a combined population of around 800,000. Food \nshortages are common in the island regions. Poverty rates are high, and increased during \n2003\u20132008 from 37% to 54%.5 Ports and wharves are critical for interisland transport, but are \nnot designed to withstand climate extremes. Upgrading such coastal infrastructure is necessary \nfor timely delivery of perishable food products to markets, and for agricultural inputs for farming \nand  fisheries.  Given  the  declining  productivity  in  agriculture  due  to  limited  arable  land, \nunsustainable farming practices,  and  overexploitation  of  coastal  resources,  climate-induced \n                                                \n1  Under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience. \n2    The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  The 21 priority target islands are presented in the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n4  ADB. 2014. The Economics of Climate Change in the Pacific. Manila. \n5   Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "2 \nstorm surges and coastal flooding are likely to worsen the situation. Public health will also be \naffected.1 \n \n5.  There is, therefore, a clear need to (i) build institutional, technical, and financial capacity \nto deal with climate change risks; and (ii) enhance resilience of island and atoll communities by \nincreasing productivity of the natural resource base, increasing access to water supply and \nsanitation,  improving  food  processing  and  storage,  and  strengthening  port  infrastructure. \nEstablishment of an enabling policy environment is a prerequisite for success. Addressing these \nimpediments will not only facilitate mainstreaming climate change in development but also \nensure  sustainable  use  of  the  country\u2019s  natural  resources  and  the  long-term  economic \ndevelopment of the country. The SPCR will complement climate change adaptation initiatives to \nbuild  climate  resilient  development  in  PNG.  These  are  prerequisites  for  effective  social \ndevelopment, food security, and overall poverty reduction. \n \n6.  Government  plans.  PNG\u2019s  Vision  20502 includes  a  focus  area  on  environmental \nsustainability and climate change.3 PNG\u2019s Development Strategic Plan, 2010\u20132030 includes \nclimate change as a crosscutting issue, with one of its goals being to \u201cadapt to the domestic \nimpacts of climate change and contribute to global efforts to abate greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d4 \nThe PNG Medium-Term Development Plan, 2011\u20132015 focuses on \u201cdeveloping governance \nand institutional capacity together with essential infrastructure and policies\u2026to improve the \nquality of life.\u201d 5 The predecessor6 of the Climate Change and Development Authority (CCDA) \ndeveloped the Climate Compatible Development Strategy aimed at \u201cshaping development to be \nmore climate resilient\u201d and setting up a sustainable climate change financing framework, both \npriorities under Vision 2050. 7 The challenges are exacerbated  by limited understanding of \nclimate risks and a lack of technical capacity. The SPCR can best help mainstream climate risk \nmanagement into PNG\u2018s national climate-resilient development program by providing support to \naddress these priority areas. \n \n7.  ADB strategic priorities. ADB developed the Climate Change Implementation Plan for \nthe  Pacific  in  2010. 8 It  identifies  the  strategic  program  for  mainstreaming  climate  change \nconsiderations into country programming. ADB\u2019s Interim Pacific Approach, 2010\u20132014;9 country \npartnership  and  strategy,  2016\u20132020;10 and  country  operations  business  plan,  2016\u20132018 \nemphasize the need for integration of climate change adaptation and disaster risk management \nto deal with climate-induced disasters. 11 Climate change resilience and disaster risk reduction \nare being incorporated as an integral part of all ADB-supported initiatives in PNG. The proposed \nproject has a multisector focus incorporating transport and public sector management (country \n                                                \n1   Sector Assessment (Summary): Multisector (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n2  Government of Papua New Guinea.

Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact of the project will be increased resilience to the effects of climate variability \nand climate change. The outcome will be improved capacities of communities (in vulnerable \natolls and islands), government agencies, and civil society to plan and respond to the impacts of \nclimate change. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n9.  Output  1:  Climate  change  and  vulnerability  assessments  carried  out  and \nadaptation plans developed for target communities. For the 21 identified vulnerable islands \nthe  project  will  (i)  prepare  local  climate  projections;  (ii)  undertake  climate  vulnerability \nassessments in consultation with local administrations and beneficiary communities, develop \nclimate change vulnerability adaption plans and emergency response strategies in the event of \nextreme climate events, and provide training in actions and procedures to be followed if such \nextreme climate events occur; (iii) install around 190 priority water supply and storage facilities \nand 100 ventilation-improved pit latrines identified during the vulnerability assessments near \ncommunity facilities (schools, aid posts, and churches with their large collection areas and \npublic access) to improve village hygiene against waterborne disease; (iv) assist communities to \nprepare climate adaptation subprojects; and (v) incorporate the climate adaptation subprojects \nin  local,  district,  and  provincial  development  plans.  Based  on  these  plans,  the  project  will \nsupport  communities  in  preparing  financing  applications  for  identified  climate  adaptation \nsubprojects  to  either  the  government\u2019s  District  Services  Improvement  Program12 or,  where \nappropriate, a small grant facility (SGF)13 to be established under the project. Subprojects, to be \ndeveloped in consultation with local communities, are estimated to cost $20,000\u2013$50,000 per \nsubproject,14 and will be approved by the project steering committee subject to conformity with \neligibility criteria, and administered by a suitably qualified financial administrator. 15 The $5 \nmillion  allocated  to  the  SGF  under  the  project  will  be  used  to  finance  approved  climate \nadaptation subprojects (requiring a 20% in-kind contribution from the beneficiary communities) \nand financial administrator fees. \n \n10.  Output 2: Sustainable fishery ecosystems and food security investments piloted \nin nine vulnerable island and atoll communities. The project will assist local communities in \nnine sites to (i) pilot techniques used in the rehabilitation of protective coral reefs and degraded \nmangrove forests, including delineation and operation of locally managed marine areas and the \ndevelopment  and  implementation  of  management  plans,  mapping,  and  environmental \nmonitoring (including fish, coral, and seaweed species); (ii) pilot income-generating activities in \nthe  marine  environment,  including  aquaculture  of  fish  and  crustaceans,  and  localized \nprocessing of marine products to extend their shelf life and improve food security; and (iii) pilot \n                                                \n12  The national government allocated K10 million to each of the 89 districts in PNG to be spent on infrastructure and \nrehabilitation  maintenance  projects  covering  education,  health  law  and  justice,  water  supplies,  agriculture, \nelectrification, transport, and community infrastructure. \n13  This facility will serve as a pilot for the Climate Change and Green Growth Trust Fund, which the government \nintends to establish in due course. \n14  Individual subproject financing will range from $20,000 to $30,000. However, a maximum of $50,000 can be \nconsidered as long it can be justified, especially in areas where the cost of construction materials is high because \nof importation cost and/or logistics. \n15  Eligibility criteria and the process for approval is in Annex 1 of the Project Administration Manual (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4 \nthe stabilization of watershed catchment areas adopting a ridge-to-reef approach in island \nhinterlands through tree planting and other slope stabilization measures, as appropriate. 16 \n \n11.  To further improve food security in the same nine vulnerable islands and strengthen \ntrading links between the islands and the mainland, the project will (i) assess the extent of food \ninsecurity anticipated from climate change and variability, (ii) identify options and priorities to \naddress  food  insecurity  in  consultation  with  local  communities,  (iii)  demonstrate  how  to \nimplement  selected  priority  options,17 and  (iv)  increase  the  production  and  distribution  of \nplanting material on selected agricultural stations. \n \n12.  Output 3: Enabling framework for climate-resilient infrastructure established and \ncommunications  network  extended.  The  project  will  develop  an  enabling  framework  to \nmitigate the impacts of climate change on coastal infrastructure (ports, wharves, and jetties) by \n(i) developing policy documents, (ii) upgrading engineering design standards, (iii) incorporating \nbenefits  from  climate  protection  in  feasibility  studies,  and  (iv)  recommending  sustainable \nfinancing alternatives for operations and maintenance. 18 Training will be provided to enhance \nthe capacity of national agencies,19 the PNG Ports Corporation, provincial administrations, and \nCoastal and Inland Fisheries Development Agency personnel to incorporate climate change \nconsiderations into design, construction, operation, and maintenance of coastal infrastructure. \n \n13.  The project will extend the radio communications network to improve communications \nand an early warning system through the installation of a very-high-frequency network linked to \nPNG\u2019s National Disaster Center. Equipment for five relay stations will be installed on existing \ntowers (one in each province), together with receiving equipment and disaster warning sirens on \nthe 21 target islands complemented by operation and maintenance training of communities. \n \n14.  Subject to additional funding from the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience, a change in \nscope to output 3 may be made to include the upgrading of Alotau provincial government wharf \nin  Milne Bay.20 This will serve as a model for climate proofing similar structures currently \nplanned in PNG. \n \n15.  Implementation  management  and  coordination  will  be  provided  through  a  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) to be established in CCDA and supported by project implementation \nsupport consultants (PISCs) recruited under the project. The PISCs will provide training and \nsupport the CCDA in the management of the project, particularly in procurement and financial \nmanagement. The PMU will ensure adherence to Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time), together with timely \nprogress  and  financial  management  reporting  to  ADB  and  the  government.  Knowledge \nmanagement will be a priority output as lessons from new approaches to climate adaptation \nmeasures are captured. \n                                                \n16  Manus (Ponam, Andra, and Ahus Islands), Milne Bay (Trobriand Islands: Kiriwina, Munuwata, and Kaeleuna \nIslands), and East New Britain (Duke of York Islands: Mioko, Utuan, and Kerawara Islands). \n17  Demonstrations will include production techniques, drought-tolerant planting material, water management, and \nrehabilitation of sago areas. \n18  These will include the strategic policies for operation and maintenance of port facilities and designs for climate-\nproofing coastal assets; upgrading national, provincial, and Coastal and Inland Fisheries Development Agency \nmanaged facilities; and the extension of infrastructure in support of the marine transport network in the islands. \n19  Additionally,  the  Department  of  Finance  and  Treasury,  Department  of  National  Planning  and  Monitoring, \nDepartment of Transport, and Office of Rural Development and Implementation. \n20  Estimated to cost $5 million, including feasibility study and associated social and environmental safeguards due \ndiligence.  \n ", "5 \n \nD.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n19.  Target island vulnerabilities were confirmed during project  preparation using current \nsocioeconomic and climate data together with consultative meetings attended by national and \nprovincial agencies, civil society, and community representatives. Central to the individual island \nvulnerability  assessment  is  the  frequency  and  extent  of  anticipated  risks  against  which \nvulnerabilities will be assessed. Climate modeling in the Pacific by Australia\u2019s Commonwealth \nScientific and Industrial Research Organisation includes a downscaling service. To secure the \nbest estimates of anticipated climate change, the project will recruit the organization to provide \nlocal climate projections for vulnerability assessments. Structures in smaller-scale subprojects \nto be financed from the SGF comprising civil works will be simple and within the capabilities of \nlocal contractors using design standards developed under the project. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n20.  Benefits assessed under building community capacity in addressing climate resilience \nevaluate the reduced damage from extreme climate events, including damage to property and \nlife. Water and sanitation initiative benefits are based on the reduced incidence of waterborne \ndisease, expressed in terms of increased working days (for the working-aged population) made \npossible by the project. For fisheries ecosystems, the benefits consider the incremental value of \na coral reef under with- and without-project scenarios in pilot sites. For food security benefits, \nthe  incremental  productivity  in  food-producing  locations  was  estimated  and  adoption  rates \nassumed to provide an overall benefit stream. The benefits from improved communication and \nearly warning were estimated from reduced loss of lives valued at a derived value of statistical \nlife. The analyses were carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic \nAnalysis of Projects using component costs as appropriate to generate internal rates of return.24 \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the overall project is estimated at 12.6% and is \nrelatively stable to analyzed risks. A 20.0% increase in costs reduces the EIRR to 9.9%. A \n20.0% reduction in overall benefits reduces the EIRR to 9.3% and a delay of 1 year for project \n                                                \n24  ADB. 1997.

The  analysis  incorporates  quantifiable  benefits  that \nunderestimate the anticipated economic benefits from the project.25 \n \n21.  For financial sustainability, in the case of SGF civil works, beneficiary communities will \nbe responsible for maintenance of works requiring mostly labor inputs for routine maintenance \nwhereas  periodic  maintenance  will  have  to  be  financed  through  the  District  Services \nImprovement Program or other local available funding sources. In the case of communication \nequipment installed on existing towers, maintenance of equipment will be carried out by the \ntower owner as part of the installation agreement or as agreed with the National Disaster Centre \nfrom central government budgetary allocations. Implementation support provided by facilitating \nnongovernment organizations can be replicated using budgetary resources if demonstrated to \nbe cost effective and appropriate. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n22.  Financial management. Ongoing challenges are (i) late submission of audited project \nfinancial statements by executing agencies, (ii) lengthy government procurement processes, (iii) \nlimited capacity of executing agencies to manage social and environmental safeguards, and (iv) \nlimited capacity of executing agencies to monitor performance against sector results.26 The \nreview  also  recognizes  the  significant  challenges  associated  with  governance  issues  that \ncontinue to cause delays in project implementation, particularly in the area of recruitment and \nprocurement.  The  government  agrees  that,  in  view  of  the  potential  governance  issues,  a \nseparate PMU should be established that will subsequently become an operational unit of \nCCDA to manage future climate change projects. A financial management assessment has \nbeen carried out for CCDA.27 \n \n23.  Small  grant  facility.  The  SGF  will  be  disbursed  through  an  independent  financial \nadministrator with the necessary fiduciary controls to ensure funds are applied for their intended \npurpose  under  the  scrutiny  of  an  independent  monitoring  mechanism  to  guard  against \nmisappropriation. \n \n24.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government and the CCDA. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n25.  The populations on small isolated islands are among the poorest in PNG. More than \n85% of the country\u2019s population relies on subsistence or semi-subsistence agriculture and \nfishing, supplemented with wild food gathered from forests and shorelines. Climate change is \nalready impacting these activities. Opportunities to earn cash income in  coastal areas are \nconstrained by a declining resource base and a lack of transport infrastructure limiting market \naccessibility, while cash income is increasingly required to meet basic needs and food security. \nThe project will positively affect social capital and livelihoods in the target islands by building \ncooperation, social cohesion, and resilience to threats from climate change.28 \n                                                \n25   Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26  ADB. 2014.

No land acquisition is needed as communication equipment will be located on existing \ntowers and resettlement requirements relating to subprojects will render them ineligible for SGF \nfinancing. Community participation is part of the design and involves women in community \ndecision making. Interventions will be identified by target communities involving representation \nfrom the socioeconomic spectrum following the vulnerability and food security assessment. A \ngender action plan has been prepared to support women\u2019s participation in decision making for \nclimate-change-related resource allocation and community-based project investments. 29 \n \n27.  Approximately 13,000 inhabitants of the 21 vulnerable islands will directly benefit from \nthe project while nationwide benefits will accrue from increased capacity to manage climate \nchange risks, establishment of early warning systems, access to finance by communities, and \ndevelopment  of  national  databases  and  knowledge  management  systems.  Preparation  of \nvulnerability maps and adaptation plans will help improve awareness and build capacity to \naddress risks of climate change impacts and disasters among target communities. This will help \navoid loss of life, assets, and livelihoods. Employment will be created during project works and \nmaintenance (especially for unemployed youth, who can be trained in construction of protective \nisland infrastructure such as coastal stabilization). Improved community health will result from \nwater and sanitation activities, reducing health risks from water- and vector-borne diseases. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n28.  Environment. The project is categorized B for environmental impact. Impacts may occur \nduring installation of water supply and latrine facilities, together with subproject investments \nidentified during vulnerability assessments such as coastal stabilization. The environmental \nimpact from these activities can be addressed by following the environmental assessment and \nreview framework.30 The PISC environmental specialist will ensure environmental management \nplans are adhered to, particularly the SGF initiatives, and will be responsible for ensuring the \nenvironmental assessment and review framework is applied in assessing proposed subprojects. \n \n29.  Involuntary resettlement. The project is categorized C for involuntary resettlement. The \nproject is not expected to require land acquisition or resettlement. The majority of project \nactivities under outputs 1 and 2, such as water tanks and latrines, will be at a household or \ncommunity  level;  communication  equipment  will  be  installed  on  existing  towers.  The \nidentification of subprojects will involve exhaustive community consultation. Each community will \nidentify  its  adaptation  priorities  and  a  few  may  require  small-scale  construction  works. \nCandidate subprojects requiring involuntary land acquisition will not be financed. If a subproject \nrequires additional land that communities are willing to provide voluntarily in consideration of \nproject benefits, the land use rights for the subproject will be arranged through a voluntary land \nuse agreement or negotiated settlement, for which a framework has been prepared.31 \n \n30.  Indigenous peoples. The project is categorized C for indigenous peoples. The project \nis not expected to affect any vulnerable group of indigenous peoples as defined under ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). Project beneficiaries are part of mainstream Melanesian \nsociety  and  their  institutions  are  not  separate  from  mainstream  society.  They  are  not \ndiscriminated against (either in practice or law) based on ethnicity and are not vulnerable \nbecause they are the dominant groups locally and the main beneficiaries in the project context. \n                                                \n29  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30  Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31  Voluntary Land Use and Negotiated Settlement Framework (accessible from the supplementary documents in \nAppendix 2). \n ", "10 \nThe  subprojects  will  benefit  local  communities,  without  any  disproportionate  risks  against \nparticular groups, and they will be implemented in a participatory manner. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n31.  Mitigating measures have been designed to address major risks with an inexperienced \nexecuting agency in project implementation and governance. These measures will effectively \nreduce the risks to manageable levels (Table 4). The benefits and impacts are expected to \noutweigh the costs. The details are in the risk assessment and risk management plan.32 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nDesign complexity (involving multiple line  Inclusion of quarterly meetings of the national steering \nagencies and participation of facilitating NGOs)  committee until implementation is running smoothly. \nrequires interagency cooperation and has the  Provincial advisory committees to enhance cooperation at the \npotential to slow implementation progress.  lower levels of government and to coordinate agency inputs \nfrom the provincial and district authorities. \nThe technical and management skills of staff  Consultants will be recruited to provide training and support \nfrom the CCDA and other implementing  the CCDA in its management of the project, particularly in \nagencies may prove inadequate, which would  areas concerning procurement and financial management. \nadversely affect implementation performance. \nMultiple packaging in procurement may result in  Procurement specialist to be recruited in PISC contract to \ndelays.  provide training to PMU appointees \nWeak financial management capacities and  Financial management specialist to be recruited under PISC \nexperience within executing agency  contract to establish systems and procedures and provide \ntraining \nCCDA  =  Climate  Change  and  Development  Authority,  NGO  =  nongovernment  organization,  PISC  =  project \nimplementation support consultant, PMU = project management unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank consultations with government. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n32.  The government and the CCDA have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and grant documents. \n \n33.  The government and the CCDA have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the grant agreement. No disbursements will be made under the \nproject until the CCDA has appointed a full-time financial management officer for the project \nmanagement unit and the PISC financial management specialists, and such specialists have \ncommenced their work at CCDA. \n \nV.
