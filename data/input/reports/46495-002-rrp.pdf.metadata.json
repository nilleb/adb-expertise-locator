This  will  be  achieved \nby mainstreaming climate resilience into development planning in vulnerable communities in 21 \npriority vulnerable islands and atolls in the provinces of Bougainville, East New Britain, Manus, \nMilne  Bay,  and  Morobe,  which  have  been  identified  through  a  participatory  process  using \nSPCR-identified  risk  factors  in  four  sectors:  infrastructure,  natural  resources,  health,  and \nagriculture.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nto \n\nRationale \n\nimpediments \n\nfacing  PNG\u2018s  efforts \n\n \nA. \n \nPNG  is  a  low  middle-income  country  of  approximately  6.5  million  people  with  high \n3. \nvulnerability  to  volcanic  eruptions,  earthquakes,  tsunamis,  cyclones,  droughts,  and  other \nweather-induced  extreme  events.  Key \nfacilitate \ntransformational  change  toward  climate-resilient  development  include  (i)  inadequate  human, \ntechnical,  and  financial  resources  at  all  levels;  (ii)  limited  knowledge  of  climate  change  risk \nmanagement;  and  (iii)  poorly  designed  infrastructure  that  is  vulnerable  to  climate  change \nimpacts. \n \nClimate change could result in losses of up to 15.2% of PNG\u2019s gross domestic product \n4. \nby 2100 (under a business-as-usual scenario), with agriculture being the most affected sector.4 \nCoral reefs around the Pacific will be affected, with implications for recreational opportunities for \ntourism, coastal protection, habitat, nursery functions for commercial fisheries, and other goods \nand services. Some 4,500 kilometers of the total 17,100 kilometers of shoreline are expected to \nbe  inundated,  affecting  up  to  30%  of  PNG\u2019s  population.  Those  most  vulnerable  to  climate \nchange  are  the  2,000  coastal  villages  with  a  combined  population  of  around  800,000.  Food \nshortages  are  common  in  the  island  regions.  Poverty  rates  are  high,  and  increased  during \n2003\u20132008  from  37%  to  54%.5 Ports  and  wharves  are  critical  for  interisland  transport,  but  are \nnot designed to withstand climate extremes. Upgrading such coastal infrastructure is necessary \nfor timely delivery of perishable food products to markets, and for agricultural inputs for farming \nand  fisheries.  Given  the  declining  productivity  in  agriculture  due  to  limited  arable  land, \nunsustainable  farming  practices,  and  overexploitation  of  coastal  resources,  climate-induced \n\n                                                \n1  Under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience. \n2  \n3  The 21 priority target islands are presented in the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked \n\n The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n4  ADB. 2014.

Public  health  will  also  be \naffected.1 \n \n5. \nThere is, therefore, a clear need to (i) build institutional, technical, and financial capacity \nto deal with climate change risks; and (ii) enhance resilience of island and atoll communities by \nincreasing  productivity  of  the  natural  resource  base,  increasing  access  to  water  supply  and \nsanitation,  improving  food  processing  and  storage,  and  strengthening  port  infrastructure. \nEstablishment of an enabling policy environment is a prerequisite for success. Addressing these \nimpediments  will  not  only  facilitate  mainstreaming  climate  change  in  development  but  also \nensure  sustainable  use  of  the  country\u2019s  natural  resources  and  the  long-term  economic \ndevelopment of the country. The SPCR will complement climate change adaptation initiatives to \nbuild  climate  resilient  development  in  PNG.  These  are  prerequisites  for  effective  social \ndevelopment, food security, and overall poverty reduction. \n \nGovernment  plans.  PNG\u2019s  Vision  2050 2  includes  a  focus  area  on  environmental \n6. \nsustainability  and  climate  change.3 PNG\u2019s  Development  Strategic  Plan,  2010\u20132030  includes \nclimate  change  as  a  crosscutting  issue,  with  one  of  its  goals  being  to  \u201cadapt  to  the  domestic \nimpacts of climate change and contribute to global efforts to abate greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d4 \nThe  PNG  Medium-Term  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132015  focuses  on  \u201cdeveloping  governance \nand  institutional  capacity  together  with  essential  infrastructure  and  policies\u2026to  improve  the \nquality  of  life.\u201d 5 The  predecessor6 of  the  Climate  Change  and  Development  Authority  (CCDA) \ndeveloped the Climate Compatible Development Strategy aimed at \u201cshaping development to be \nmore  climate  resilient\u201d  and  setting  up  a  sustainable  climate  change financing  framework,  both \npriorities  under  Vision  2050.  7 The  challenges  are  exacerbated  by  limited  understanding  of \nclimate risks and a lack of technical capacity. The SPCR can best help mainstream climate risk \nmanagement into PNG\u2018s national climate-resilient development program by providing support to \naddress these priority areas. \n \nADB  strategic  priorities. ADB developed the Climate Change Implementation Plan for \n7. \nthe  Pacific  in  2010.  8  It  identifies  the  strategic  program  for  mainstreaming  climate  change \nconsiderations into country programming.

The  outcome  will  be  improved  capacities  of  communities  (in  vulnerable \natolls and islands), government agencies, and civil society to plan and respond to the impacts of \nclimate change. \n \nC. \n \n9. \nOutput  1:  Climate  change  and  vulnerability  assessments  carried  out  and \nadaptation plans developed for target communities. For the 21 identified vulnerable islands \nthe  project  will  (i)  prepare  local  climate  projections;  (ii)  undertake  climate  vulnerability \nassessments  in  consultation  with  local  administrations  and  beneficiary  communities,  develop \nclimate change vulnerability adaption plans and emergency response strategies in the event of \nextreme  climate  events,  and  provide  training  in actions  and  procedures  to  be  followed  if  such \nextreme climate events occur; (iii) install around 190 priority water supply and storage facilities \nand  100  ventilation-improved  pit  latrines  identified  during  the  vulnerability  assessments  near \ncommunity  facilities  (schools,  aid  posts,  and  churches  with  their  large  collection  areas  and \npublic access) to improve village hygiene against waterborne disease; (iv) assist communities to \nprepare climate adaptation subprojects; and (v) incorporate the climate adaptation subprojects \nin  local,  district,  and  provincial  development  plans.  Based  on  these  plans,  the  project  will \nsupport  communities  in  preparing  financing  applications  for  identified  climate  adaptation \nsubprojects  to  either  the  government\u2019s  District  Services  Improvement  Program 12  or,  where \nappropriate, a small grant facility (SGF)13 to be established under the project. Subprojects, to be \ndeveloped  in  consultation  with  local  communities,  are  estimated  to  cost  $20,000\u2013$50,000  per \nsubproject,14 and will be approved by the project steering committee subject to conformity with \neligibility  criteria,  and  administered  by  a  suitably  qualified  financial  administrator.  15 The  $5 \nmillion  allocated  to  the  SGF  under  the  project  will  be  used  to  finance  approved  climate \nadaptation subprojects (requiring a 20% in-kind contribution from the beneficiary communities) \nand financial administrator fees. \n \n10. \nOutput  2:  Sustainable  fishery  ecosystems  and  food  security  investments  piloted \nin nine vulnerable island and atoll communities. The project will assist local communities in \nnine sites to (i) pilot techniques used in the rehabilitation of protective coral reefs and degraded \nmangrove forests, including delineation and operation of locally managed marine areas and the \ndevelopment  and \nimplementation  of  management  plans,  mapping,  and  environmental \nmonitoring (including fish, coral, and seaweed species); (ii) pilot income-generating activities in \nthe  marine  environment,  including  aquaculture  of  fish  and  crustaceans,  and  localized \nprocessing of marine products to extend their shelf life and improve food security; and (iii) pilot \n\n                                                \n12   The national government allocated K10 million to each of the 89 districts in PNG to be spent on infrastructure and \nrehabilitation  maintenance  projects  covering  education,  health  law  and  justice,  water  supplies,  agriculture, \nelectrification, transport, and community infrastructure. \n\n13  This  facility  will  serve  as  a  pilot  for  the  Climate  Change  and  Green  Growth  Trust  Fund,  which  the  government \n\nintends to establish in due course. \n\n14   Individual  subproject  financing  will  range  from  $20,000  to  $30,000.  However,  a  maximum  of  $50,000  can  be \nconsidered as long it can be justified, especially in areas where the cost of construction materials is high because \nof importation cost and/or logistics. \n\n15  Eligibility criteria and the process for approval is in Annex 1 of the Project Administration Manual (accessible from \n\nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nthe  stabilization  of  watershed  catchment  areas  adopting  a  ridge-to-reef  approach  in  island \nhinterlands through tree planting and other slope stabilization measures, as appropriate. 16 \n \n11. \nTo  further  improve  food  security  in  the  same  nine  vulnerable  islands  and  strengthen \ntrading links between the islands and the mainland, the project will (i) assess the extent of food \ninsecurity  anticipated  from  climate  change  and  variability,  (ii)  identify  options  and  priorities  to \naddress  food  insecurity  in  consultation  with  local  communities,  (iii)  demonstrate  how  to \nimplement  selected  priority  options, 17  and  (iv)  increase  the  production  and  distribution  of \nplanting material on selected agricultural stations. \n \n12. \nOutput  3:  Enabling  framework  for  climate-resilient  infrastructure  established  and \ncommunications  network  extended.  The  project  will  develop  an  enabling  framework  to \nmitigate the impacts of climate change on coastal infrastructure (ports, wharves, and jetties) by \n(i) developing policy documents, (ii) upgrading engineering design standards, (iii) incorporating \nbenefits  from  climate  protection  in  feasibility  studies,  and  (iv)  recommending  sustainable \nfinancing  alternatives  for  operations  and  maintenance. 18 Training  will  be  provided  to  enhance \nthe capacity of national agencies,19 the PNG Ports Corporation, provincial administrations, and \nCoastal  and  Inland  Fisheries  Development  Agency  personnel  to  incorporate  climate  change \nconsiderations into design, construction, operation, and maintenance of coastal infrastructure. \n \nThe  project  will  extend  the  radio  communications  network  to  improve  communications \n13. \nand an early warning system through the installation of a very-high-frequency network linked to \nPNG\u2019s  National  Disaster  Center.  Equipment  for  five  relay  stations  will  be  installed  on  existing \ntowers (one in each province), together with receiving equipment and disaster warning sirens on \nthe 21 target islands complemented by operation and maintenance training of communities. \n \n14. \nSubject to additional funding from the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience, a change in \nscope to output 3 may be made to include the upgrading of Alotau provincial government wharf \nin  Milne  Bay. 20 This  will  serve  as  a  model  for  climate  proofing  similar  structures  currently \nplanned in PNG. \n \n15. \nImplementation  management  and  coordination  will  be  provided  through  a  project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  to  be  established  in  CCDA  and  supported  by  project  implementation \nsupport  consultants  (PISCs)  recruited  under  the  project.  The  PISCs  will  provide  training  and \nsupport  the  CCDA  in the management  of  the  project,  particularly  in procurement  and financial \nmanagement. The PMU will ensure adherence to Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time), together with timely \nprogress  and  financial  management  reporting  to  ADB  and  the  government.  Knowledge \nmanagement  will  be  a  priority  output  as  lessons  from  new  approaches  to  climate  adaptation \nmeasures are captured. \n\n                                                \n16   Manus  (Ponam,  Andra,  and  Ahus  Islands),  Milne  Bay  (Trobriand  Islands:  Kiriwina,  Munuwata,  and  Kaeleuna \n\nIslands), and East New Britain (Duke of York Islands: Mioko, Utuan, and Kerawara Islands). \n\n17   Demonstrations  will  include  production  techniques,  drought-tolerant  planting  material,  water  management,  and \n\nrehabilitation of sago areas. \n\n18   These will include the strategic policies for  operation and maintenance of port facilities and designs for climate-\nproofing  coastal  assets;  upgrading  national,  provincial,  and  Coastal  and  Inland  Fisheries  Development  Agency \nmanaged facilities; and the extension of infrastructure in support of the marine transport network in the islands. \n19   Additionally,  the  Department  of  Finance  and  Treasury,  Department  of  National  Planning  and  Monitoring, \n\nDepartment of Transport, and Office of Rural Development and Implementation. \n\n20   Estimated to cost $5 million, including feasibility study and associated social and environmental safeguards due \n\ndiligence.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nD. \n \n16. \nexpenditure category and financier are included in the project administration manual.21 \n \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $27.29  million  (Table  1).

The steering committee shall meet quarterly \ninitially  and  then  biannually  once  implementation  stabilizes  or,  as  required,  to  review  project \nimplementation  performance  and  approve  annual  work  plans  and  budgets.  A  PMU  will  be \nestablished in the CCDA, headed by a full-time project director seconded from the CCDA who \nwill be supported by a full-time national project coordinator and PISCs. The PISCs will provide \ntechnical  support  to  the  PMU  as  well  as  financial  management,  procurement,  and  support  for \nSGF-related  activities.

Central to the individual island \nvulnerability  assessment  is  the  frequency  and  extent  of  anticipated  risks  against  which \nvulnerabilities  will  be  assessed.  Climate  modeling  in  the  Pacific  by  Australia\u2019s  Commonwealth \nScientific  and Industrial Research Organisation  includes  a downscaling  service. To  secure the \nbest estimates of anticipated climate change, the project will recruit the organization to provide \nlocal  climate  projections  for  vulnerability  assessments.  Structures  in  smaller-scale  subprojects \nto be financed from the SGF comprising civil works will be simple and within the capabilities of \nlocal contractors using design standards developed under the project. \n \nB. \n \n20. \nBenefits  assessed  under  building  community  capacity  in  addressing  climate  resilience \nevaluate the reduced damage from extreme climate events, including damage to property and \nlife. Water  and sanitation initiative  benefits  are based  on the  reduced  incidence  of  waterborne \ndisease, expressed in terms of increased working days (for the working-aged population) made \npossible by the project. For fisheries ecosystems, the benefits consider the incremental value of \na  coral  reef  under  with-  and  without-project  scenarios  in  pilot  sites.  For  food  security  benefits, \nthe  incremental  productivity  in  food-producing  locations  was  estimated  and  adoption  rates \nassumed to provide an overall benefit stream. The benefits from improved communication and \nearly warning were estimated from reduced loss of lives valued at a derived value of statistical \nlife.  The  analyses  were  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Economic \nAnalysis of Projects using component costs as appropriate to generate internal rates of return.24 \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the overall project is estimated at 12.6% and is \nrelatively  stable  to  analyzed  risks.  A  20.0%  increase  in  costs  reduces  the  EIRR  to  9.9%.  A \n20.0% reduction in overall benefits reduces the EIRR to 9.3% and a delay of 1 year for project \n                                                \n24  ADB. 1997.

The  analysis  incorporates  quantifiable  benefits  that \nunderestimate the anticipated economic benefits from the project.25 \n \n21. \nFor financial  sustainability,  in the  case  of  SGF civil  works,  beneficiary  communities  will \nbe responsible for maintenance of works requiring mostly labor inputs for routine maintenance \nwhereas  periodic  maintenance  will  have  to  be  financed  through  the  District  Services \nImprovement  Program  or  other  local  available  funding  sources.  In  the  case  of  communication \nequipment  installed  on  existing  towers,  maintenance  of  equipment  will  be  carried  out  by  the \ntower owner as part of the installation agreement or as agreed with the National Disaster Centre \nfrom central government budgetary allocations. Implementation support provided by facilitating \nnongovernment  organizations  can  be  replicated  using  budgetary  resources  if  demonstrated  to \nbe cost effective and appropriate. \n \nC. \n \n22. \nFinancial  management.  Ongoing  challenges  are  (i)  late  submission  of audited  project \nfinancial statements by executing agencies, (ii) lengthy government procurement processes, (iii) \nlimited capacity of executing agencies to manage social and environmental safeguards, and (iv) \nlimited  capacity  of  executing  agencies  to  monitor  performance  against  sector  results.26 The \nreview  also  recognizes  the  significant  challenges  associated  with  governance  issues  that \ncontinue to  cause  delays  in  project  implementation,  particularly  in  the  area  of  recruitment  and \nprocurement.  The  government  agrees  that,  in  view  of  the  potential  governance  issues,  a \nseparate  PMU  should  be  established  that  will  subsequently  become  an  operational  unit  of \nCCDA  to  manage  future  climate  change  projects.  A  financial  management  assessment  has \nbeen carried out for CCDA.27 \n \n23. \nSmall  grant  facility.  The  SGF  will  be  disbursed  through  an  independent  financial \nadministrator with the necessary fiduciary controls to ensure funds are applied for their intended \npurpose  under  the  scrutiny  of  an  independent  monitoring  mechanism  to  guard  against \nmisappropriation. \n \n24. \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  CCDA.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \n \nD. \n \n25. \nThe  populations  on  small  isolated  islands  are  among  the  poorest  in  PNG.  More  than \n85%  of  the  country\u2019s  population  relies  on  subsistence  or  semi-subsistence  agriculture  and \nfishing,  supplemented  with  wild  food  gathered  from  forests  and  shorelines.  Climate  change  is \nalready  impacting  these  activities.  Opportunities  to  earn  cash  income  in  coastal  areas  are \nconstrained  by  a  declining  resource  base  and  a  lack  of  transport  infrastructure  limiting  market \naccessibility, while cash income is increasingly required to meet basic needs and food security. \nThe  project  will  positively  affect  social  capital  and  livelihoods  in  the  target  islands  by  building \ncooperation, social cohesion, and resilience to threats from climate change.28 \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n                                                \n25   Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26  ADB. 2014.

Community  participation  is  part  of  the  design  and  involves  women  in  community \ndecision making. Interventions will be identified by target communities involving representation \nfrom  the  socioeconomic  spectrum  following  the  vulnerability  and  food  security  assessment.  A \ngender action plan has been prepared to support women\u2019s participation in decision making for \nclimate-change-related resource allocation and community-based project investments. 29 \n \nApproximately  13,000  inhabitants  of  the  21  vulnerable  islands  will  directly  benefit  from \n27. \nthe  project  while  nationwide  benefits  will  accrue  from  increased  capacity  to  manage  climate \nchange  risks,  establishment  of  early  warning  systems,  access to finance by  communities,  and \ndevelopment  of  national  databases  and  knowledge  management  systems.  Preparation  of \nvulnerability  maps  and  adaptation  plans  will  help  improve  awareness  and  build  capacity  to \naddress risks of climate change impacts and disasters among target communities. This will help \navoid loss of life, assets, and livelihoods. Employment will be created during project works and \nmaintenance (especially for unemployed youth, who can be trained in construction of protective \nisland  infrastructure  such  as  coastal  stabilization).  Improved  community  health  will  result  from \nwater and sanitation activities, reducing health risks from water- and vector-borne diseases. \n \nE. \n \n28. \nEnvironment. The project is categorized B for environmental impact. Impacts may occur \nduring  installation  of  water  supply  and  latrine  facilities,  together  with  subproject  investments \nidentified  during  vulnerability  assessments  such  as  coastal  stabilization.  The  environmental \nimpact from these activities can be addressed by following the environmental assessment and \nreview framework.30 The PISC environmental specialist will ensure environmental management \nplans  are  adhered  to,  particularly  the  SGF  initiatives,  and  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  the \nenvironmental assessment and review framework is applied in assessing proposed subprojects. \n \n29. \nInvoluntary resettlement. The project is categorized C for involuntary resettlement. The \nproject  is  not  expected  to  require  land  acquisition  or  resettlement.  The  majority  of  project \nactivities  under  outputs  1  and  2,  such  as  water  tanks  and  latrines,  will  be  at  a  household  or \ntowers.  The \ncommunity \nidentification of subprojects will involve exhaustive community consultation. Each community will \nidentify  its  adaptation  priorities  and  a  few  may  require  small-scale  construction  works. \nCandidate subprojects requiring involuntary land acquisition will not be financed. If a subproject \nrequires  additional  land  that  communities  are  willing  to  provide  voluntarily  in  consideration  of \nproject benefits, the land use rights for the subproject will be arranged through a voluntary land \nuse agreement or negotiated settlement, for which a framework has been prepared.31 \n \nIndigenous  peoples. The project is categorized  C for indigenous peoples. The project \n30. \nis  not  expected  to  affect  any  vulnerable  group  of  indigenous  peoples  as  defined  under  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  Project  beneficiaries  are  part  of  mainstream  Melanesian \nsociety  and  their  institutions  are  not  separate  from  mainstream  society.  They  are  not \ndiscriminated  against  (either  in  practice  or  law)  based  on  ethnicity  and  are  not  vulnerable \nbecause they are the dominant groups locally and the main beneficiaries in the project context. \n\nlevel;  communication  equipment  will  be \n\ninstalled  on  existing \n\n                                                \n29  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30  Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31  Voluntary  Land  Use  and  Negotiated  Settlement  Framework  (accessible  from  the  supplementary  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe  subprojects  will  benefit  local  communities,  without  any  disproportionate  risks  against \nparticular groups, and they will be implemented in a participatory manner. \n \nF. \n \n31.  Mitigating  measures  have been  designed  to  address major  risks  with an  inexperienced \nexecuting  agency  in  project  implementation  and  governance.  These  measures  will  effectively \nreduce  the  risks  to  manageable  levels  (Table  4).  The  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to \noutweigh the costs. The details are in the risk assessment and risk management plan.32 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nDesign complexity (involving multiple line \nagencies and participation of facilitating NGOs) \nrequires interagency cooperation and has the \npotential to slow implementation progress. \n\nThe technical and management skills of staff \nfrom the CCDA and other implementing \nagencies may prove inadequate, which would \nadversely affect implementation performance. \nMultiple packaging in procurement may result in \ndelays. \nWeak financial management capacities and \nexperience within executing agency \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nInclusion of quarterly meetings of the national steering \ncommittee until implementation is running smoothly. \nProvincial advisory committees to enhance cooperation at the \nlower levels of government and to coordinate agency inputs \nfrom the provincial and district authorities. \nConsultants will be recruited to provide training and support \nthe CCDA in its management of the project, particularly in \nareas concerning procurement and financial management. \n\nProcurement specialist to be recruited in PISC contract to \nprovide training to PMU appointees \nFinancial management specialist to be recruited under PISC \ncontract to establish systems and procedures and provide \ntraining \n\nCCDA  =  Climate  Change  and  Development  Authority,  NGO  =  nongovernment  organization,  PISC  =  project \nimplementation support consultant, PMU = project management unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank consultations with government. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \n32. \nThe  government  and  the  CCDA  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and grant documents. \n \n33. \nThe  government  and  the  CCDA  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \nproject,  which are  set forth in the  grant  agreement.
