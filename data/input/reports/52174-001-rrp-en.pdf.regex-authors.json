THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Emergency Assistance Project.1 The report also \ndescribes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Implementing  the  Emergency  Assistance \nProject, and if the Board approves the proposed grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The project will support the Government of Bangladesh in addressing the immediate and \nurgent needs of the displaced persons from Myanmar in Coxsbazar District, as identified by the \nUnited Nations (UN) in its Joint Response Plan (JRP) (displaced persons).2 The project will mainly \nsupport the improvement of water supply and sanitation, disaster risk management, sustainable \nenergy supply, and access roads.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Description of the emergency. Since August 2017, Bangladesh has received more than \n700,000 displaced persons. These displaced persons, which mostly reached Bangladesh by \ncrossing the nearby border on foot, joined about 400,000 other displaced persons who had arrived \nin waves from Rahkine State earlier.4 The vast majority of displaced persons who have arrived in \nBangladesh are living in 32 camps in Coxsbazar District, with more than 600,000 living in the \nKutupalong\u2013Balukhali mega camp. The large influx of displaced persons has caused a huge \nstrain on the local infrastructure and economy. The 2:1 ratio of displaced persons to the local \npopulation poses significant challenges to the food supply, shelter, health, sanitation, water, and \nother essential services. Although UN agencies and other donors are providing humanitarian relief \nsuch as food, water, medical aid, and temporary shelter, the existing services are stretched, and \nlarge gaps remain.5 \n \n4.  Request for emergency assistance. On 7 May 2018, the Government of Bangladesh \nrequested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for grant support to provide high-priority basic \ninfrastructure and essential services to help address the humanitarian crisis caused by the arrival \n                                                \n1  The provision of a grant to Bangladesh from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Special Fund resources (Asian \nDevelopment Fund [ADF]) for the project is subject to the Board\u2019s approval of a separate proposal (submitted in \nparallel to this paper) waiving provisions of applicable ADB policies that would otherwise prohibit such grant support. \nPrior to submission of this proposal to the Board, ADF donors endorsed the allocation of $100 million in ADF \nresources to provide special grant support to Bangladesh for the project. \n2  UN, Strategic Executive Group. 2018. 2018 JRP for Rohingya Humanitarian Crisis, March\u2013December 2018.

The international community, led by the UN, has \nengaged in multisector needs assessments, consultations, and strategic planning that culminated \nin a joint humanitarian response plan and the JRP.7 The JRP lays out a vision for a coordinated \nresponse to address the immediate needs of the displaced persons and mitigate the impact on \nthe local communities. The cost to implement the JRP for March\u2013December 2018 is about $950 \nmillion, of which only 21% is funded. The JRP identifies the key needs related to (i) decongestion \nand relocation to protect more than 200,000 displaced persons currently vulnerable to floods and \nlandslides in camp areas; (ii) the lack of sludge management facilities to process 420,000 \nkilograms of human waste generated per day in camps; (iii) the construction and maintenance of \nhand pumps and surface water treatment plants to provide 16 million liters of safe water; and (iv) \nfood and cooking fuel; basic health care, obstetric and childcare, and disease prevention; \neducation and skills; and ecosystem rehabilitation. In response to the government\u2019s request, ADB \nfielded a reconnaissance mission on 15\u221216 May 2018 to collect the most up-to-date information \nand consulted with government officials, development partners, and stakeholders. Accordingly, \nADB identified a preliminary scope of the project, in coordination with development partners, in \nline with the JRP. A fact-finding mission during 3\u22127 June confirmed the high-priority needs.8 \n \n6.  Disaster risk. The southeastern part of Bangladesh is highly susceptible to various types \nof natural hazards, and cyclone and monsoon seasons, which include flooding, landslides, \nwindstorms,  lightning,  fires,  heat  waves,  and  cold  spells.9  Climate  change  is  expected  to \naggravate the intensity, frequency, and unpredictability of extreme weather events. Much of the \nland used for the camps is steep or low-lying and prone to flooding and landslides. This is further \nexacerbated by hill cutting and vegetation clearing on the mainly clay hills (footnote 5). The host \npopulation  in  the  seven  Upazilas  (subdistricts)  comprising  Coxsbazar  District  is  among \nBangladesh\u2019s most vulnerable because of food insecurity, poor health conditions, and poverty \nrates that are well above Bangladesh\u2019s national average (footnote 5). Congested living conditions \nand poor sanitation in the camps create additional health risks, including fires and vector- and \nwaterborne diseases. Women and children in these camps are among the most vulnerable \npopulation groups in disaster events.10 \n \n7.  Economic impacts. There is no clear estimate of the economic and financial losses \ncaused  by  the  crisis  emanating  from  the  influx  of  displaced  persons,  according  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s Office of the Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commission (RRRC). However, a \nwide range of sectors have been affected. After crossing the border, hundreds of thousands of \ndisplaced persons walked through paddy fields causing significant agricultural production losses. \nIn addition to the camp areas, which occupy about 2,350 hectares of reserve forest land, the \nequivalent of about four football field-sized areas of forest is being cut down every day for fuel. \nThe prices of necessary commodities have increased significantly because of rising demand. \nOverburdened infrastructure in the area is also causing social and economic losses. \n                                                \n6  The project meets the five eligibility criteria for an emergency assistance loan, as well as the six characteristics of an \nemergency assistance loan, as defined in ADB. 2015.

Manila. \n7  The JRP targets 1.3 million people, including 336,000 host community members. Its four strategic objectives are to \n(i) provide timely lifesaving assistance and protection to and improve the living conditions of people; (ii) ensure the \nwell-being and dignity of people; (iii) support environmentally sustainable solutions; and (iv) build the confidence and \nresilience of people. \n8  Summary Assessment of Damage and Needs (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  Disaster risk is a function of hazards, exposure, and vulnerability. \n10 UN, Inter Sector Coordination Group.

Coxsbazar  District,  especially  the  Teknaf  and  Ukhia  Upazilas \n(subdistricts), has high baseline levels of poverty, environmental vulnerability, underemployment, \nand underinvestment; and had poor access to services even before the 2017 influx.11 The poor \ndepend on daily labor as their main source of income. Most settlements are in rural villages and \nagricultural plots interspersed with government forest, plantations, and ecologically critical areas. \nThe  geographical  location  produces  a  multi-hazard  environment  where  recurrent  extreme \nweather events undermine households\u2019 resilience and livelihoods. \n \n9.  Development partner coordination. Twelve UN agencies, some 127 international and \nnational  nongovernment  agencies,  and  several  faith-based  organizations  and  government \ninterventions are providing humanitarian aid and relief.12 The UN-led Inter Sector Coordination \nGroup (ISCG) prepared the JRP in coordination with the government (para. 5). The World Bank \nis preparing its support in phases. The first phase would amount to $240 million and include (i) a \nhealth, nutrition, and population service project to expand health service provisions; (ii) an \neducation and skills training project that would target out-of-school children and expand basic \nnumeracy and literacy programs and life skills training; and (iii) a multisector support project that \nwould combine interventions in disaster risk management, water and sanitation, environmental \nprotection, social protection, gender equality and social inclusion. \n \n10.  ADB would ensure that there is no duplication with other development partners through \nits Bangladesh Resident Mission, which is coordinating closely with the Local Consultative Group, \nUN  agencies,  and the World  Bank. The  Strategy  Executive  Group\u23af  led  by  the  UN  High \nCommissioner  for  Refugees,  the  UN  Resident  Coordinator  (UNRC),  and  the  International \nOrganization for Migration\u23afin Dhaka and the ISCG and RRRC in Coxsbazar are coordinating \nwith  the  donors.  The  National  Task  Force  is  the  government\u2019s  highest  coordination  body \nconstituted by a cabinet comprising of 37 ministries and agencies, with the secretariat in Ministry \nof Foreign Affairs. \n \n11.  At the Donors\u2019 Consultation Meeting organized by ADB on 6 June 2018, development \npartners agreed to collaborate closely to avoid duplication and to take up the prioritized projects.13 \nADB has held detailed consultations through bilateral meetings with the World Bank, the World \nFood Programme, the UN Development Programme, the UNRC, and other development partners; \nand regularly briefs the Local Consultative Group, which coordinates donors in Bangladesh. ADB \nwill continue to participate in the Strategy Executive Group\u2019s fortnightly meetings and will also join \nthe site-level coordination group in Coxsbazar to avoid duplicating activities and to maintain \nquality and speed during implementation. \n \n                                                \n11 According to the UN Development Assistance Framework, Coxsbazar is one of the 20 (out of 64) lagging districts in \nBangladesh based on poverty, literacy, and nutrition indicators; and environmental degradation risks. Further, \naccording to the pockets of social deprivation evaluation of the UN Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), Teknaf and Ukhia are \namong the 50 most socially deprived subdistricts of Bangladesh, based on indicators of literacy, child labor, access \nto sanitary toilets, and connection to electricity. On average, 33% of the population in these two subdistricts lives \nbelow the poverty line (17% live below the extreme poverty line), and 38% is vulnerable to food insecurity (12.5% is \nconsidered highly vulnerable). Food production in the district is scarce, leading to increased household expenditures \non food and economic vulnerability overall. \n12 Emergency Assistance Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 Participants included Australia, Canada, Danida, European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations, the \nEuropean Union, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, the International Organization for Migration, Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, the Netherlands, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, \nUNICEF, the UN Development Programme, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the UN Population Fund, \nUNRC, the United States, the United States Agency for International Development, the World Bank, and the World \nFood Programme. \n ", "4 \n12.  Lessons in disaster response. The government is successfully coping with cyclone risk \nand has a track record of emergency preparedness and community-based disaster risk reduction. \nEmergency preparedness and community-based disaster risk management in the project area \nwill build on past and ongoing government efforts and will complement the JRP. In addition to \nensuring that new infrastructure will factor in the risks of natural hazards and climate change, the \nproject will support awareness raising, capacity development, and risk management action \nplanning in the camps and local communities. To promote transparency, reduce the administrative \nburden, and ensure sound management, ADB will provide a TA grant to set up results-based \nmonitoring and evaluation systems. ADB will also coordinate closely with donors while selecting \nand designing the individual subproject activities to identify synergies and avoid duplication. \n \n13.  Proposed ADB support. Given the urgent need to provide basic infrastructure services \nto the displaced persons, ADB proposes grant financing of $100 million for investments that will \nhelp with the immediate needs of the displaced persons, with the possibility of additional financing \nof up to $100 million in a second phase. The scope and timing of the second phase of support \nwould be subject to the progress of the first phase, an assessment of needs, and the availability \nof additional grant funds, among other factors. ADB support will be within the framework of the \nJRP in the following areas: (i) water and sanitation, (ii) disaster risk management, (iii) energy \nsupply, and (iv) road access to and within camps.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  The project is aligned with the following impact: social recovery of displaced persons in \nTeknaf  and  Ukhia  camps  accelerated.  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  living \nconditions and the resilience of displaced persons improved (footnote 3). The project will directly \nbenefit the lives of people in camps while indirectly co-benefitting host communities in some \ninstances. ADB is cognizant of sensitivities and potential conflicts among and within affected \ncommunities. These will be addressed through a gender- and socially-inclusive approach, among \nothers. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n15.  Output 1: Water supply and sanitation improved. This consists of providing the camp \nareas with (i) mobile water carriers for the distribution of treated water; (ii) community bathing \nfacilities for women; (iii) mini piped water supply systems with a production tube well, distribution \npipe network, and standpipe water distribution points; (iv) an integrated waste management \nfacility with collection system; and (v) small surface water treatment plants. \n \n16.  Output 2: Disaster risk management strengthened. This includes constructing in and \naround the camp areas (i) multipurpose cyclone shelters with emergency access roads, (ii) food \ndistribution centers, (iii) hill slope protection and/or toe walls to resist landslides, and (iv) storm \nwater  drainage  networks. The  project  will  also  provide  lightning  arresters  and  support the \npreparation of gender-sensitive disaster risk management plans with community-based disaster \nrisk reduction approach. \n \n17.  Output 3: Energy sources provided. This includes providing the camp areas with (i) \nretained heat cookers; (ii) stand-alone solar powered street lights with solar photovoltaic panels, \nbattery boxes, and mini grid-connected street lights; and (iii) access to electricity by augmenting \nsubstations, distribution lines, and transformers. \n \n ", "5 \n18.  Output 4: Access roads improved. This consists of rehabilitating (i) rural roads to \nconnect to food storage and distribution centers, field hospitals, primary health care centers, and \nprimary education centers; (ii) emergency access roads to the camp areas; and (iii) existing \naccess  roads  to  and  within  the  camps  and  drainage  systems.  The  project  also  supports \nresurfacing the road from Coxsbazar to Teknaf, which is the main supply line. \n \n19.  Subprojects. ADB will apply a sector lending approach in selecting an investment under \neach of the outputs.14 Within the JRP framework, ADB will prioritize subprojects for development \nand implementation to optimize the available resources in close coordination with the government \nand development partners. Each subproject will be subject to ADB\u2019s prior approval based on the \nfollowing selection criteria: \n(i)  direct impact on the lives of the international displaced persons in the camp areas, \n(ii)  no or minimal land acquisition or acquisition of government land, \n(iii)  compliance with ADB\u2019s safeguards requirements and no activities inside critical \nhabitats and protected areas, \n(iv)  no duplication of activities funded by other donors, \n(v)  implementation period not extending beyond the project closing date, and \n(vi)  inclusion of feedback from a beneficiary consultation process. \n \nD.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.  The project will be implemented over 2.5 years, and the grant will close by 30 June 2021. \nAs a condition for being selected, each subproject must have an implementation period that can \nbe completed prior to the project closing date (para. 19). \n \n24.  To  provide  the  necessary  guidance  to  expedite  subproject  development  and \nimplementation, ADB proposed that the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief form a \ncentral committee comprising senior officials from the ministries involved. \n \n25.  Based on the guidance of the central committee, RRRC will coordinate the proposed \ninterventions of ADB and other development partners in Coxsbazar on behalf of the Ministry of \nDisaster Management and Relief. RRRC and ADB will conduct regular coordination meetings \ninvolving  all  executing  and  implementing  agencies;  stakeholders,  including  the  deputy \ncommissioner of Coxsbazar; and other development partners and agencies. ADB plans to \nestablish a liaison office in Coxsbazar to facilitate coordination with RRRC, the ISCG, and other \ndevelopment partners; and expedite subproject development and implementation. \n \n26.  The  Local  Government  Engineering  Department,  the  Department  of  Public  Health \nEngineering, the Roads and Highways Department, and the Bangladesh Rural Electrification \nBoard will each be concurrent executing and implementing agencies for project activities in their \nrespective  areas  of  responsibility.18  Dedicated  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  will  be \nestablished in each implementing agency, as needed, and will be headed by experienced project \ndirectors to manage day-to-day implementation activities, project management, and reporting. \n \n27.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 15). \n \n28.  Procurement. Executing and implementing agencies will carry out the procurement of \ngoods, works, and consulting services in a manner consistent with the simplified and expedient \nprocedures in ADB Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (2004), the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time), and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers \n                                                \n17 Climate Risk Assessment and Management Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18  The Local Government Engineering Department is expected to implement subprojects under outputs  2, and 4 within \nits areas of responsibility. Depending on the nature of the activity, subprojects will be implemented by the Department \nof Public Health Engineering (output 1), the Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board (output 3), and the Roads and \nHighways Department (output 4). \n ", "7 \n(2017, as amended from time to time). Most civil works and goods contracts will be awarded \nthrough open competitive bidding (OCB) and the national advertisement method. To ensure \nefficiency, special procedures for emergency lending will be used, including reducing the bidding \nperiod  to  14  days  when  appropriate;  using  single-stage  one-envelope  bidding  procedures; \ndeveloping a master bid document for each implementing agency; and developing a time-bound \naction plan to award contracts, including a contract management plan. Some civil works and \ngoods  contracts  may  be  procured  using  direct  contracting,  where  appropriate,  following \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Small and simple works and goods up to $100,000 may be \nprocured using international and/or national request for quotations. ADB encourages community \nparticipation in the procurement of small works of a simple nature. Subject to bidding documents \nbeing modified to comply with ADB requirements, the national electronic government procurement \nsystem will be used for OCB to award most civil and supply contracts, although manual or off-line \nbidding may be used where appropriate. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  July 2018\u2013December 2020 \nEstimated completion date   31 December 2020 \nEstimated grant closing date  30 June 2021 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Central Committee \nOffice of the Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commission in Coxsbazar  \n(ii)   Executing agency  LGED, DPHE, RHD, BREB \n(iii)  Implementing agencies  LGED, DPHE, RHD, BREB  \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Dedicated PIU of each implementing agency \nProcurement  OCB (national advertisement)  55 contracts  $99.1 million \nDirect contracting \nLCB \nRequest for quotation \nConsulting services  QCBS and CQS, OCB, international  266 person- $2.9 million \nand/or national advertisement, or LCB  months \nSingle source selection \nIndividual consultant international \nadvertisement/national advertisement \nRetroactive financing and advance  Advance and retroactive financing will apply for the procurement of civil \ncontracting  works, goods, and consulting services; and for project administration.

To  support  project  implementation,  consulting  firms  will  be  recruited  through  OCB \nprocedures, local advertisements, and/or limited competitive bidding using a quality- and cost-\nbased selection procedure, a simplified technical proposal, or a biodata technical proposal. Other \nmethods, such as the consultants\u2019 qualifications selection, may also be used where appropriate. \nIndividual consultants will be recruited using the individual selection method with international \nand/or local advertisements, based on the project\u2019s requirements. Consultants who are already \nengaged in ADB-financed projects and provide similar services as those required for the project \nmay be recruited directly, subject to their satisfactory performance. This arrangement will provide \n ", "8 \nan  efficient  way  to  recruit  consultants  under  the  circumstances.  Local  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) may provide some social and gender studies and/or support. The option to \nhave a direct contract or a memorandum of understanding with NGOs and/or UN agencies \nalready engaged in the project area may also be explored where appropriate. \n \n30.  Goods,  works,  and  consulting  services  will  be  procured  based  on  the  detailed \narrangements  in  the  project\u2019s  procurement  plan,  including  the  procurement  and  selection \nmethods, the type of bidding documents, and ADB\u2019s review requirements. ADB will review two \nsimilar contracts for each respective agency prior to tendering, and the rest of the contracts will \nbe post reviewed (sampling). All executing and implementing agencies will be required to (i) use \nthe Procurement Activity Monitoring Tool, a web-based database, to record and monitor the time \ntaken for each step of the procurement process and track any delays; and (ii) take appropriate \nactions for all prior and post-review packages of goods and works under the project.19 \n \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n31.  To strengthen and sustain the institutional and technical capacities of the executing and \nimplementing agencies for the timely and efficient delivery of the project outputs, the government \nhas requested ADB to provide TA grant support for the project. ADB, through its Bangladesh \nResident Mission, will administer the TA to support the project activities being carried out by the \nexecuting and implementing agencies within their respective areas of responsibility. The TA will \nhave three outputs: (i) institutional and technical capacity strengthened; (ii) planning, designing, \nand implementing the proposed subprojects supported; and (iii) an effective monitoring and \nevaluation system established. The first output will provide capacity building support to the \nexecuting and implementing agencies and RRRC, including the liaison office, for procurement, \ncontract  management,  quality  control,  and  disbursement.  The  second  output  will  support \nexecuting and implementing agencies with capacity constraints and low readiness of subproject \nselected,  technical  and  safeguards  due  diligence,  design,  procurement,  and  contract \nmanagement. The third output will help establish monitoring and evaluating systems for the \nexecuting and implementing agencies, RRRC, and the liaison office. The TA is estimated to cost \n$3,100,000, of which $3,000,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nSpecial  Fund  (TASF  6).20  The government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the form  of \ncounterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  office  supplies,  secretarial  assistance,  local \ntransportation, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n32.  All new infrastructure will be disaster-resilient and climate-smart and will be based on \nhazard, climate, and risk analyses; modified design criteria; and the careful selection of materials \nand monitoring of field practices. The final selection of subprojects will follow the subproject \nselection criteria included in the PAM (footnote 15). These include adherence to safeguard \nrequirements and technical and economic viability. The implementing agencies and ADB will lead \nthe screening process of priority projects, in coordination with other development partners to avoid \nduplication. \n \n                                                \n19 ADB developed the Procurement Activity Monitoring Tool under TA (ADB. 2013.

Economic and Financial \n \n33.  The project is likely to generate significant social benefits to the displaced persons through \nimproved water supply and sanitation, disaster risk management, energy supply, and access to \nroads. However, because of the short processing time available for the emergency response, it \nwas not possible to collect data and undertake full economic due diligence prior to seeking Board \napproval. Therefore, economic due diligence will be conducted on all selected subprojects during \nproject implementation following ADB guidelines on economic analysis to ensure that the selected \nsubprojects are economically viable. The TA for project implementation will include resources to \nundertake the necessary subproject economic analysis in compliance with ADB requirements. \n \n34.  Project outputs are public service goods with no opportunity for cost recovery, so no \nfinancial viability assessment is required. Water supply and sanitation systems, buildings and \nstructures, energy supply systems, and roads constructed under the project will be maintained \nusing the relevant ministries\u2019 ongoing recurrent budget. While this will be assessed during project \nimplementation, government commitment has also been obtained as a grant assurance. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n35.  ADB conducted an updated financial management assessment of the executing and \nimplementing agencies for the project.21 The review is based on existing financial management \nassessment of the same executing and implementing agencies taking into consideration the \nlessons  learned  during  implementation  of  past  and  existing  projects,  various  sector  level \ngovernance assessments, and interviews with project management units and other relevant \ngovernment staff.22 All four executing and implementing agencies have experience implementing \nADB-funded projects. The overall financial management risk is substantial, but it can be managed \nby implementing the mitigation measures agreed with the executing and implementing agencies, \nincluding (i) deploying PIU staff with prior ADB project experience, and (ii) strengthening internal \ncontrols and financial reporting based on detailed assessments. Financial management experts \nfunded by the TA grant will be engaged to provide capacity building support and fiduciary risk \nmonitoring, including compliance with audited project financial statement requirements. \n \n36.  A procurement assessment of the executing and implementing agencies revealed that \nprocurement  and  contract  management  risk  is  manageable  through  the  implementation  of \nmitigation measures agreed with the executing and implementing agencies, including (i) deploying \nPIU staff with prior ADB project experience, and (ii) introducing an efficient contract award and \ncontract implementation management plan. Procurement experts funded by the TA grant will be \nengaged to provide capacity building support to ensure compliance with agreed procurement \nprocedures. \n \n37.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \n                                                \n21 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 LGED is currently implementing loans 2462, 3142, 2695, 3550 and 2542; DPHE is currently implementing loans 3133 \nand 3550; RHD is currently implementing loans 2949 and 3592; and BREB is currently implementing loans 3522 and \n3350. \n \n ", "10 \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n38.  The project is expected to ease basic infrastructure and social service constraints in the \nTekhnaf and Ukhia camps. The settlements are in rural villages and agricultural plots interspersed \nwith government forest, plantations, and ecologically critical areas. Providing clean water and \naccess to sanitation and latrines in and around the camps will improve the health conditions of \nthe communities and prevent waterborne diseases. Better lighting will make it safer for women \nand children to move and will help bridge the supply and demand gap for fuel and energy in \nhouseholds. The construction and rehabilitation of roads will accelerate relief distribution, improve \nmobility in the camps, and facilitate economic activities and income generation. \n \n39.  The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming, and ADB has prepared a gender \nequality and social inclusion (GESI) action plan in consultation with the ISCG and its Gender in \nHumanitarian Assistance platform. To ensure the effective implementation of the GESI action \nplan, the project team will hire social development experts based in Coxsbazar and a national \nNGO for effective social mobilization services. This will ensure the effective participation of \nwomen and disadvantaged groups in project-supported activities, in line with the commitments \nset out in the action plan, including labor opportunities, decision-making processes, and access \nto basic services. ADB will collect sex-disaggregated data to report GESI-related results. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n40.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.23 \n \n41.  Environment (category B). ADB formed subproject selection criteria to avoid significant \nadverse environmental impacts. An environmental assessment and review framework (EARF) \nhas been prepared following ADB\u2019s Safeguards Policy Statement (2009) and government laws \nand regulations. ADB has disclosed the EARF on its website. Implementation arrangements build \non the implementing agencies\u2019 experience from other ADB-financed projects, and the project \nteam will help the implementing agencies gain adequate capacity to manage environmental \nimpacts  through  consultant  support.  Initial  environmental  examinations  and  environmental \nmanagement plans will be prepared consistent with the EARF and will be incorporated in bidding \ndocuments and contract documents to be implemented by contractors and monitored by the \nimplementing agencies. Executing and/or implementing agencies will provide environmental \nreport to the Bangladesh Resident Mission on a semiannual basis. \n \n42.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). ADB formed subproject selection criteria to avoid \nland acquisition and involuntary resettlement impacts and social risks. A resettlement framework \nhas been prepared and disclosed, following ADB\u2019s Safeguards Policy Statement and government \nlaws and regulations, to guide planning studies and detailed designs of subprojects. The project \nteam will help the implementing agencies gain adequate capacity to prepare resettlement plans, \nif required, through consultant support. Consultations will be undertaken with stakeholders in \nproject  areas  during  implementation.  Executing  and/or  implementing  agencies  will  provide \nresettlement implementation report to the Bangladesh Resident Mission on a semiannual basis. \n                                                \n23 ADB.
