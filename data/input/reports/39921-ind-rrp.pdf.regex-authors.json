I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nIndian rupee-denominated loan, without government guarantee, supported by a partial credit \nguarantee (PCG) from German development cooperation through KfW Bankengruppe (KfW), to \nPetronet LNG Limited (PLL) for the Dahej Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Terminal Expansion \nProject. If approved, this will be the first loan of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to receive \nrisk participation by a third party financial institution. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  INTRODUCTION \n2.  PLL owns and operates India\u2019s first LNG import and regasification terminal, located in \nDahej, Gujarat. The terminal was built with first phase capacity of 5 million metric tons per \nannum (MMTPA) with the intention of expanding to 10 MMTPA in the second phase. PLL also \nplans to construct another LNG terminal in Kochi, Kerala. \n \n3.  PLL is a product of ADB\u2019s advisory work with the Government of India from its public \nsector window. In 1997 ADB provided a Japan Special Fund-financed technical assistance1 for \na study on setting up a public-private joint venture to build and operate LNG terminals. The \ntechnical assistance completion report2 states that the LNG terminal project could be funded in \npart under ADB\u2019s private sector window. The concept to set up a public-private joint venture for \nLNG  terminals  was  later  incorporated  in  the  Hydrocarbon  Vision  2025,  the  Government \nframework for energy development. \n  \n4.  Based on the study and framework, four leading state companies\u2014Bharat Petroleum \nCorporation Limited (BPCL), GAIL (India) Limited (GAIL), Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOC), \nand Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC)\u2014formed PLL to implement the first LNG \nterminal in the country. Throughout this process, ADB maintained dialogue with the Government \nand  the  four  project  promoters  and  helped  make  the  project  commercially  viable.  After \nincorporating ADB\u2019s advice on the project structure, including 50:50 joint public-private sector \nownership and gas pricing, in 2002 the four companies reconfirmed their desire to have ADB \nfinancial assistance.  \n \n5.  In response, on 13 January 2004, the ADB Board approved an equity investment and \nPCG  amounting,  in  exposure  terms,  to  Rs3.525  billion  (equivalent  to  $75  million  at  the \nexchange rate of that time) to finance the first phase of PLL\u2019s Dahej terminal. ADB subscribed to \n5.2%  equity  of  PLL.  The  terminal  started  commercial  operation  on  9  April  2004  and  its \nproduction reached full capacity of 5 MMTPA in March 2005. \n \n6.  The terminal was financed with equity and debt. The entire debt requirement was met by \nloans  from  Indian  banks  that  carry  floating  interest  rates.  It  was  intended  that  after  the \ncommencement of commercial operation, PLL would replace part of the Indian bank loans with \na bond issue partially guaranteed by ADB. The bonds would provide long-term, fixed interest \nrate funds, which are not available in India. ADB\u2019s PCG would upgrade PLL\u2019s credit rating, \nmaking its bond issue possible and helping stabilize the project\u2019s economics.  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997. Technical Assistance to India for the Liquefied Natural Gas Terminal Project. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance Completion Report on the LNG Terminal Project in India. Manila. \n ", "2   \n7.  However, PLL did not proceed with a bond issue due to changes in the bond market \nconditions since PLL and ADB started negotiating the PCG.  Under the new market conditions, \na bond issue would not provide PLL with a low enough interest rate.  \n \n8.  As the expansion of the Dahej terminal became imminent, PLL decided to keep the \nexisting debt arrangement for the first phase terminal and not pursue a bond issue to refinance \npart of the existing loans. PLL still asked ADB to provide finance for the Dahej expansion and to \ndo so in collaboration with KfW, which had expressed strong interest in financing PLL, but only \nin association with ADB. After obtaining concept clearance for the Dahej expansion project on \n16 August 2005 and cancelling the board approval for the PCG on 26 August 2005, ADB fielded \na due diligence mission in March 2006. \n \nIII.  BACKGROUND \nA.  The Gas Sector  \n1.  Demand and Supply \n9.  India\u2019s primary energy consumption stood at 3.7% of the world\u2019s total in 2004.3 India is \nnow the fifth largest consumer of primary energy in the world. However, per capita supply of \nenergy is still low, even among Asian developing countries. In 2003, compared with the world \ntotal primary energy supply per capita of 1.69 tons of oil equivalent, India recorded only 0.52,4 \nreflecting the strong potential for continuing growth in the Indian energy sector.  \n \n10.  The predominant source of primary energy continues to be coal (54.5%), followed by oil \n(31.7%), natural gas (7.7%), hydro (5.1%), and nuclear (1.0%). Recent environmental concerns \nas well as spiraling oil prices have boosted natural gas as a source of energy. While the share \nof natural gas is much lower than the world average of 23.7%,5 growth has been faster than for \nany other fuel. From only 16.6 billion cubic meters (bcm) (equivalent to 45 million standard cubic \nmeters per day [MMSCMD]) in 1994, natural gas use was nearly 29.4 bcm (81 MMSCMD) in \n2004. The share of natural gas is expected to increase from 8% to 15% by 2011\u20132012 and to \n20% by 2024\u20132025, provided that gas is made available from domestic and imported sources.  \n \n11.  India\u2019s natural gas demand was met by domestically produced gas, but with the start-up \nof PLL in April 2004, India started importing gas. Most domestic gas production currently takes \nplace in the Bombay high fields and Gujarat. State-owned ONGC and Oil India Limited still \ndominate gas production (79%), with joint ventures and private sector companies accounting for \nthe rest. In the mid-1990s, domestic production was deemed to have peaked and was forecast \nto decrease as low as 36 MMSCMD by 2025. However, major new gas fields have been \ndiscovered since 2000, most notably Reliance Industries\u2019 KG-D6 block in the Krishna Godavari \nBasin offshore of Andhra Pradesh, with an estimated 400 bcm reserves. With such discoveries, \n                                                 \n3  BP  plc.  2005.  BP  Statistical  Review  of  World  Energy  2005.  Available:  http://www.bp.com/liveassets \n/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/publications/energy_reviews_2005/STAGING/local_assets/downloads/p\ndf/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2005.pdf. Primary energy refers to commercially traded fuels. \nFuels  such  as  wood,  peat,  and  animal  waste,  which  though  important  in  many  countries,  are  unreliably \ndocumented in terms of consumption statistics and are excluded. \n4  International Energy Agency. 2005. Key World Energy Statistics 2005. In 2003, the per capita total primary energy \nsupply  of  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  members  averaged  4.67  tons  of  oil \nequivalent; Asia, excluding the People\u2019s Republic of China, 0.61; and the People\u2019s Republic of China, 1.10. \n5  BP  plc.  2005.  BP Statistical Review  of  World Energy 2005.  Available: http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/ \nglobalbp/globalbp_uk_english/publications/energy_reviews_2005/STAGING/local_assets/downloads/pdf/statistical\n_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2005.pdf \n ", " \n3\nIndia\u2019s proven reserves are now 920 bcm (665 million metric tons [MMT] in LNG). At the current \nproduction level of 80 MMSCMD, the reserves are expected to last for 31 years.  \n \n12.  Even with new reserves, India\u2019s domestic supply is not likely to keep pace with demand \nand the country needs to import significant amounts of gas either as LNG or via pipeline. PLL\u2019s \nfirst phase terminal was India\u2019s first initiative in this direction and has added gas supply of 17.5 \nMMSCMD to domestic supply. Following PLL, Shell constructed a 2.5 MMTPA (8.8 MMSCMD \nof gas) at Hazira, Gujarat. PLL Dahej and Shell Hazira are the only LNG terminals operating in \nIndia today.  \n \n13.  Current gas demand is estimated to be around 163 MMSCMD (equivalent of 43 MMTPA \nof LNG), against the total supply capacity of 99 MMSCMD (equivalent to 26 MMTPA of LNG), \nwhich implies a deficit of around 64 MMSCMD (17 MMTPA of LNG). The demand-supply gap is \nexpected  to  widen,  with  demand  projected  to  exceed  300  MMSCMD  by  2011  and  390 \nMMSCMD by 2024. Supply is projected to grow to around 250 MMSCMD, including PLL\u2019s Dahej \nexpansion and Kochi terminal. India is negotiating with Australia, Iran, Malaysia, Oman, and \nQatar for procurement of LNG. India has not started importing gas by pipeline yet. Plans are \nunder way for pipeline import from Bangladesh, Iran, Myanmar, and Turkmenistan; but these \nare not expected to be implemented in the near future due to technical challenges and political \nsensitivities.  \n \n14.  About 80% of natural gas is consumed by the power and fertilizer subsectors. Demand \nfrom other sectors is increasing, including refineries as fuel and feedstock; transport sector as \ncompressed natural gas; petrochemical plants as feedstock; and glass, ceramics, automotive \nindustries, sponge iron, and other industries as fuel. \n \n2.  Gas Sector Regulation \n15.  India\u2019s oil and gas subsector is regulated in two areas: upstream and downstream. For \nthe  upstream,  exploration  and  production  is  regulated  by  the  Directorate  General  of \nHydrocarbons under the administrative control of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas \n(MPNG) based on the Oilfields (Regulations and Development) Act, 1948 and the Petroleum \nand Natural Gas Rules, 1959. The downstream has been regulated by the Oil Coordination \nCommittee, also under MPNG, based on the Petroleum Act, 1934 and control orders passed by \nMPNG from time to time. However, with the passing of the long-awaited Petroleum and Natural \nGas Regulatory Board Bill, 2005 by Parliament on 21 March 2006, the downstream regulation \nwill be transferred to an independent regulator, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory \nBoard, in the near future. The board will regulate refining; processing; storage; transportation; \ndistribution; marketing; and sale of petroleum, petroleum products, and natural gas.  \n \n16.  With liberalization initiated in 1991, the oil and gas subsector was opened to private \nsector participation with concession rights awarded for a few small- and medium-sized fields for \ndevelopment by joint ventures and the private sector. The 1999 New Exploration Licensing \nPolicy was to encourage private sector participation in the exploration program; concessions \nhave been awarded through five rounds of bids. The Government has already removed all \nrestrictions on importing natural gas. The private sector is free to import gas either by pipeline or \nas LNG. While GAIL still has a near monopoly on onshore transmission, the Petroleum and \nNatural  Gas  Regulatory  Board  Act,  2006,  is  expected  to  induce  more  entrants  into  the \ntransmission business. Under the act, all gas pipelines will be required to offer open access to \nall users. Gas distribution is already open to the private sector. \n \n ", "4   \n3.  Gas Price \n \n17.  Natural  gas  sold  in  India  is  priced  differently  for  different  suppliers  and  users:  (i) \nnominated gas, which is produced by ONGC and Oil India Limited from the nominated reserves, \namounts to 55 MMSCMD and is distributed by GAIL at controlled prices determined by the \nadministered price mechanism; (ii) other domestic gas, amounting to 20 MMSCMD, is produced \nby joint ventures and private sector producers and sold directly to consumers at a market-linked \nprice; and (iii) imported gas (PLL and Shell Hazira), amounting to 27 MMSCMD, is sold at the \nmarket price.  \n \n18.  In  1997  the  Government  announced  phased  dismantling  of  the  administered  price \nmechanism for certain petroleum products. In March 2002, it gave notice that marketing and \npricing of all petroleum products except kerosene and LPG was to be deregulated with effect \nfrom April 2002. As of mid 2006, however, due to political reasons, nominated gas is still sold to \npower, fertilizer, compressed natural gas, and other small consumers at the administered price \nmechanism  price,  which  is  currently  $1.9/million  British  thermal  units  (MMBTU).  The  price \napplicable to other users of nominated gas is linked to the price of imported LNG, which is \ncurrently $3.5/MMBTU (ex LNG import terminal price [= LNG price + shipping + import tariff + \nregasification charge]). The price of other domestic gas, since July 2005, is market-linked, and \nis already very similar to the price of imported LNG. Gas to be produced from new fields will be \npriced completely freely.  \n \nB.  Asian Development Bank Operations \n1.  Country Strategy \n19.  Mainstreaming  poverty  reduction  is  the  central  organizing  theme  of  ADB\u2019s  country \nstrategy and program for India.6 It draws on all three pillars of ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy: \npro-poor growth, social development, and good governance. The strategy aims to support the \nGovernment\u2019s high-growth agenda through assistance for fiscal consolidation, infrastructure \ndevelopment,  and  private  sector  development.  Consensus  is  now  emerging  within  the \ndevelopment community on the strong nexus between infrastructure and poverty reduction. The \nstrategy  aims  to  emphasize  investments  in  publicly  provided  infrastructure,  including \nhydrocarbons, to remove key bottlenecks where private investment is not forthcoming. Physical \ninvestments are also to be combined with policy reforms and capacity building, which are as \nimportant as physical investment in improving infrastructure.  \n \n20.  Private  sector  development  is  integral  to  ADB\u2019s  operational  strategy.  The  country \nstrategy  and  program  focuses  on  promoting  an  enabling  environment  for  private  sector \ndevelopment  through  financial  sector  interventions  to  improve  financial  intermediation  and \nresource mobilization, policy reforms to remove impediments to private investment, investment \nin public infrastructure, public-private partnerships, and investments in private sector projects. A \nlist of ADB\u2019s private sector operations in India is in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2003. Country Strategy and Program (2003\u20132006) India. Manila; and ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and \nProgram Update (2006\u20132008) India. Manila. \n ", " \n5\n2.  Energy Sector Strategy \n21.  ADB\u2019s energy sector strategy7 designates ADB\u2019s operational priorities as (i) reducing \npoverty by, among others, creating energy infrastructure for sustainable economic growth; (ii) \npromoting  private  sector  involvement  by  restructuring  the  energy  sector  and  creating  an \nenabling environment for private investors; (iii) addressing regional and global environmental \nimpacts; and (iv) promoting regional cooperation. In particular, the strategy strongly encourages \nADB interventions to increase private sector participation in the energy sector to take advantage \nof the higher operational efficiencies that private operators can achieve and to meet the large \ncapital  requirements.  ADB\u2019s  energy  sector  strategy  promotes  a  shift  to  cleaner  fuels  and \nprocesses,  which  in  India  includes  shifting  from  coal  to  natural  gas.  The  strategy  also \nencourages liberalization of markets and elimination of subsidies.  \n \n3.  The Project\u2019s Consistency with Asian Development Bank Strategies \n22.  The Project is in line with ADB\u2019s country, energy sector, private sector development, and \nenvironmental protection strategies. As a public-private partnership, PLL was the first step in \ncommercializing the gas sector\u2019s LNG import segment, and the policy dialogue associated with \nPLL has led to delicensing of this segment and deregulation of input and output pricing. The \nexpansion of PLL\u2019s terminal will augment supplies of environment-friendly fuel that will displace \nuse of more polluting fuels, and will do so cost-competitively. The Project will help India diversify \nits energy sources. PLL\u2019s successful operation has demonstrated that the concept of public-\nprivate partnership in infrastructure development that ADB has advocated can be implemented \nsuccessfully, with careful planning and structuring. This model has drawn the interest of several \ncountries in the region for possible replication. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Project Description \n1.  Existing Facilities \n23.  The Project involves the expansion initially to 7.5 MMTPA and later to 10 MMTPA of an \nexisting LNG import and regasification terminal with a capacity of 5 MMTPA at Dahej, Gujarat. \nPLL  is  the  owner  of  the  LNG  terminal.  The  existing  facilities  consist  of  marine  facilities; \nunloading facilities; two full containment LNG storage tanks each with a net capacity of 148,000 \ncubic meters (m3); boil-off gas recovery system for recondensation of boil-off gas; send-out \nfacilities, including \u201cshell and tube\u201d and \u201csubmerged combustion\u201d vaporizers; auxiliary facilities, \nincluding a gas-fired captive power plant with three 7.6-megawatt gas turbines, electrical and \ncontrol systems, utilities production, metering, and fire and gas detection and protection system; \nand a jetty. \n \n24.  Originally, a 660-meter C-shaped breakwater was included in the first phase project \nscope  to  restrict  downtime  during  monsoons.  About  20%  of  work  was  completed  on  the \nbreakwater. However, based on the actual morphological data collected during implementation \nof the first phase project, PLL, in consultation with Gaz de France and other experts, concluded \nthat the estimated downtime without the breakwater would still be at an acceptable level, and \nthat  an  additional  LNG  storage  tank  would  provide  more  operational  flexibility  than  the \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2000. Energy 2000: Review of the Energy Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila. \n ", "6   \nbreakwater.8 Thus PLL is removing the breakwater and constructing the third LNG storage tank. \nPLL is implementing this in conjunction with the processing capacity expansion.  \n \n2.  Expansion Facilities \n25.  The Dahej terminal was designed with a configuration easily expandable to 10 MMTPA. \nThe Project will, to a large extent, use the existing facilities. Additional facilities include (i) the \nthird LNG storage tank with a capacity of 148,000 m3, which replaces the function of the \nbreakwater;  (ii)  the  fourth  LNG  storage  tank  with  a  net  capacity  of  148,000  m3;  (iii)  one \nadditional compressor for the boil-off gas recovery system; (iv) another set of send-out facilities \nwith in-tank pumps; (v) two additional gas turbines; and (v) other minor associated facilities.  \n \nB.  Management and Ownership \n26.  PLL,  a  public  limited  company  established  under  the  Companies\u2019  Act,  1956  is \nimplementing the Project. Its sponsors are BPCL, GAIL, IOC, and ONGC, holding 50% in total. \nOther shareholders are GDF International (GDFI) holding 10%, ADB 5.2%, and public investors \n34.8%. PLL, a private sector company under the Indian Companies Act, is managed by a team \nof business professionals with energy sector and private sector backgrounds. \n \n27.  BPCL, 66% owned by the Government, is India\u2019s second largest petroleum refining and \nmarketing company following IOC. GAIL, 57% owned by the Government, is India\u2019s largest gas \ntransmission  and  marketing  company.  IOC,  82%  owned  by  Government,  is  India\u2019s  largest \npetroleum refining and marketing company and is ranked 170th in the Fortune 500 list of the \nworld\u2019s largest companies. IOC has also been ranked first in petroleum trading among the 15 \nnational oil companies in Asia and the Pacific. ONGC, 74% owned by the Government, is \nIndia\u2019s largest oil and gas producer, accounting for nearly 80% of crude oil and natural gas \nproduced domestically. All four sponsors are run commercially, with significant autonomy from \nthe Government.  \n \n28.  GDFI is a subsidiary of Gaz de France S.A. (GDF), a state-owned natural gas company \nin France, and responsible for all GDF international operations. GDF, the world\u2019s fourth largest \npurchaser of natural gas and Europe\u2019s largest importer of LNG with a regasification capacity of \n42 MMSCMD, operates Europe\u2019s largest gas transmission and distribution system. In February \n2006, it announced a merger with Suez S.A., a Franco-Belgian multi-utility and the sixth largest \nnatural gas company in Europe. After the merger, GDF-Suez will become Europe\u2019s largest gas \ncompany. \n \n29.  PLL\u2019s board has 15 members: secretary of MPNG (chairperson); and one representative \nfrom each of ADB, BPCL, GAIL, GDFI, IOC, ONGC, the lenders, and the Gujarat government;9 \nthree management staff (managing director and chief executive officer, director technical, and \ndirector finance); and three independent directors. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n30.  The Project\u2019s contractual framework is shown in Appendix 3. \n \n                                                 \n8  An LNG storage tank would mitigate the impact of suspension of LNG delivery resulting from not only bad weather \nconditions but also LNG receiving machinery breakdowns. \n9  The Gujarat government is not a shareholder of PLL but has the right to nominate a director on PLL\u2019s board as per \nthe concession agreement. \n ", " \n7\n1.  Concession \n31.  PLL is implementing the first phase terminal and the Project on a build-operate-transfer \nbasis  under  a  30-year  concession10  from  the  Gujarat  Maritime  Board.  The  concession \nagreement was not executed in time for commencement of construction of the first phase and \nPLL implemented the first phase based on a letter of intent from the Gujarat Maritime Board, \npursuant to which it took over the land measuring 58.6 hectares. The concession agreement \nwas finally signed on 20 December 2005.  \n \n2.  Liquefied Natural Gas Supply \n32.  PLL is currently sourcing 5 MMTPA of LNG for the first phase production from Ras \nLaffan Liquefied Natural Gas Company Limited (II) (Rasgas II) under a 25-year LNG sales and \npurchase agreement (SPA) dated 31 July 1999. Rasgas II was selected through international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB). Rasgas II is a joint venture between Qatar Petroleum (70%) and \nExxonMobil Corporation (30%). The two companies have access to North Field,11 one of the \nworld\u2019s largest nonassociated gas fields, with the proven and probable reserve of 25,000 bcm \n(18,000 MMT in LNG equivalent). The recoverable reserves of the blocks allocated to Rasgas II \nare about 900 bcm (650 MMT in LNG equivalent).  \n \n33.  The LNG SPA obligates supply and offtake of 7.5 MMTPA, of which 5.0 MMTPA is for \nthe first phase of the Dahej terminal and 2.5 MMTPA (tranche A) was originally intended for \nPLL\u2019s other proposed terminal in Kochi, Kerala, which is at the initial stages of planning and \ndevelopment. PLL and Rasgas II have agreed to reallocate tranche A to the Project because the \nProject is progressing faster than the Kochi terminal. Two side letters were executed on 22 \nSeptember 2005 and 20 December 2005 respectively to indicate the commencement date, \nquality, and quantity of tranche A LNG. Rasgas II is obligated to start supply of tranche A on 1 \nOctober 2009, while the completion of the expansion facilities and the delivery date of the third \nLNG tanker are expected on 31 March 2009. During this 6-month period, PLL hopes to acquire \nLNG from Rasgas II from its spare capacity12 or buy LNG on short-term contracts from other \nsources.13  \n \n34.  PLL is obligated to purchase LNG from Rasgas II on a take-or-pay basis for 25 years at \na fixed price of $2.53/MMBTU for the first 5 years of the contract (January 2004\u2013December \n2008). During the remaining contract period, the LNG price will fluctuate with the Japan crude-\noil cocktail price of crude oils, with a cap and a floor. \n \n3.  Liquefied Natural Gas Transport \n35.  Currently, two dedicated tankers, with a capacity of 138,000 m3 each, transport LNG \nfrom Qatar under two 25-year time charter agreements (TCAs) awarded through ICB. The \n                                                 \n10 The terminal facilities are divided into the port terminal and the regasification facility. After 30 years the port \nterminal will be transferred to the Gujarat Maritime Board. PLL will own the regasification facility for 90 years. PLL \nwill maintain its access to and use of the port terminal by a port-user agreement with the Gujarat Maritime Board.  \n11  North Field, discovered in 1971, extends over 6,000 square kilometers, predominantly underwater, to the northeast \nof Qatar. A portion of North Field underlies the Qatari landmass and another portion extends into Iran\u2019s territorial \nwaters. \n12 Qatar Petroleum and ExxonMobil, through another joint venture, own trains 1 and 2 with a capacity of 3.3 MMTPA \neach. Rasgas II owns and operates trains 3 and 4 with a capacity of 4.78 MMTPA each, and is constructing train 5 \nof the same capacity. Yet another joint venture of Qatar Petroleum and ExxonMobil is constructing trains 6 and 7 \nwith a capacity of 7.8 MMTPA each. Tranche A for PLL will be produced at train 7. \n13 An LNG tanker is available for spot hiring at a price of $70,000\u2013$80,000 per day depending on the demand. \n ", "8   \ntankers are owned by two consortia comprising Mitsui OSK Lines Limited (29.1%), Shipping \nCorporation of India Limited (29.1%), Nippon Yusen KK (17.9%), Kawasaki Kisen KK (8.9%), \nand Qatar Shipping Corporation (15%).14 The tankers were built by Daewoo Shipbuilding and \nMarine Engineering Company Limited. Both tankers were delivered in advance of the contract \ndelivery dates and have been operating without any problems. \n \n36.  PLL conducted an ICB for a TCA for the 2.5 MMTPA of additional LNG supply from \nRasgas II and awarded the contract to a consortium of Mitsui OSK, Shipping Corporation of \nIndia, Nippon Yusen, and Kawasaki Kisen. The contract contained an option for PLL to get a \nshare in the consortium for assignment to Qatar. This time, Qatar Gas Transportation Company \nwill have a 20% share and PLL will retain a 3% share, leaving 26% each for Mitsui OSK and \nShipping Corporation, 16.7% for Nippon Yusen, and 8.3% for Kawasaki Kisen. The third tanker \nwill have a capacity of 154,800 m3 and be constructed by Samsung Heavy Industries. The third \nTCA was executed on 21 February 2006. \n \n4.  Gas Offtake \n37.  Gas from the first phase terminal is being purchased by GAIL, IOC, BPCL (offtakers) in \nthe  ratio  of  60%,  30%,  and  10%  respectively  under  gas  sales  and  purchase  agreements \n(GSPAs). The rights and obligations under the GSPAs mirror those under the Rasgas II LNG \nSPA: as long as PLL takes or pays for LNG and delivers gas, the offtakers are obligated to take \nor pay for the gas. The offtakers have agreed to purchase tranche A gas in the same proportion \nand on the same terms and conditions as the first 5 MMTPA. This agreement was recorded in a \nside letter to each of the GSPAs dated 31 December 2005 for GAIL and 29 December 2005 for \nIOC and BPCL. \n \n38.  The offtakers sell almost all of the gas to third parties. The end users are predominantly \nindustrial users along the Hazira\u2013Bijaypur\u2013Jadgishpur (HBJ) pipeline, who have switched from \nmore expensive alternatives such as naphtha and diesel to natural gas. The first phase Dahej \nterminal and the Shell Hazira terminal, the second LNG terminal in India, have not satisfied the \ndemand in Gujarat and surrounding areas. Significant gas supply shortage is projected in areas \ncurrently served or could be served by PLL if a pipeline connection is established. Additional \noutput from PLL is expected to be absorbed again by industrial users along the HBJ pipeline, \nincluding the offtakers\u2019 plants. In addition, GAIL is laying a 475 km pipeline connecting Dahej to \nUran in Maharashtra targeting completion within 2006. Once this pipeline is operational, PLL will \nbe able to expand its service area to Maharashtra, India\u2019s most industrialized state. \n \n39.  39.  PLL\u2019s gas price is set commercially without any government control. It is currently \n$3.51/MMBTU at PLL\u2019s delivery point (ex-terminal price) and consists of (i) the LNG rate, (ii) the \ntaxes and duties rate, and (iii) the regasification rate. The LNG and taxes and duties rates \nreflect the actual cost of LNG supply and taxes and duties. The regasification rate covers PLL\u2019s \noperation and maintenance costs, debt service, and return to shareholders.  \n \n40.  PLL\u2019s gas price is considerably higher than the price of nominated gas to the protected \nend users (power, fertilizer, and small users) of $1.9/MMBTU, but compares favorably with the \nprice of other domestic gas. PLL gas does not compete with nominated gas or other domestic \ngas; rather PLL gas has met and will continue to meet demand that is either not met at all, \n                                                 \n14 The consortia originally consisted of Mitsui OSK, Shipping Corporation of India, Nippon Yusen, and Kawasaki \nKisen. The contract contained an option for PLL to obtain a share in the consortia for assignment to Qatar. Qatar \nShipping Corporation subsequently bought a 15% share in both consortia. \n ", " \n9\ncausing capacity underutilization, or met by more expensive alternate fuels such as naphtha, \ndiesel, and fuel oil. Domestic gas from newly found reserves is not considered a threat to the \nDahej terminal. Projections from various sources of gas demand and supply suggest that, even \nincluding new domestic gas supply sources, the demand-supply gap will not disappear for the \nforeseeable future.  \n \n41.  The take-or-pay GSPAs contractually shield PLL from market risk. The primary risk for \nPLL is the creditworthiness of the offtakers. GAIL and IOC are rated AAA by the India Credit \nRating Agency, and BPCL is rated AAA by the Credit Rating Information System of India \nLimited.15 Introduction of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board Act in the near future \nwill mean not only more competition for GAIL but also more business opportunities, which GAIL, \nwith its dominant infrastructure, should be able to take advantage of. IOC and BPCL have been \nmaking losses over the past year due to crude oil price hikes without commensurate increase of \npetroleum product prices. In the first quarter of fiscal year (FY) 2006, both companies (along \nwith Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited, the third largest petroleum company after the \ntwo) recorded losses for the first time in history, which continued until the third quarter. All three \nearn a wide refining margin, but the prices of their products are regulated by the Government \nbelow the cost-recovery level. Altogether losses of Rs400 billion are expected for FY2006 for \nthe entire downstream oil industry, all such losses will be supplemented by the Government. \nThe India Credit Rating Agency and Credit Rating Information System of India Limited believe \nthat IOC and BPCL\u2019s downturn is temporary, and that with liberalization of the downstream \npetroleum industry, particularly retail product pricing, IOC and BPCL business will grow to meet \never-increasing energy demand in the country and the region. IOC and BPCL are expected to \nmaintain the AAA rating for the foreseeable future. The business and financial performance of \nthe three offtakers are summarized in Appendix 4. \n \n5.  Gas Transport \n42.  PLL gas is transported through the HBJ pipeline, India\u2019s major trunk line operated by \nGAIL. It covers Gujarat, Western Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and \nDelhi. IOC and BPCL executed gas transmission agreements with GAIL, which have been \namended by side letters dated 29 December 2005 to reflect increased gas transmission volume \nfor tranche A supply. Under the gas transmission agreements, GAIL is obligated to transport \ngas to receiving points of IOC and BPCL\u2019s end users. PLL is contractually protected from the \ngas transportation risk as it is entitled to receive take-or-pay gas charges from the offtakers as \nlong as it is in a position to supply gas to designated entry points on the pipelines. \n \n43.  The original HBJ pipeline had a capacity of 33 MMSCMD, of which 30 MMSCMD was \nused. To accommodate gas from PLL, GAIL expanded the capacity to 56 MMSCMD by laying \nan 82 km pipeline from Dahej to Vemar, Gujarat, and a 528 km pipeline parallel to the existing \nHBJ  pipeline  from  Vemar  to  Bijaypur,  Madhya  Pradesh.  Currently,  40  MMSCMD  of  the \nexpanded HBJ pipeline is being used, including 18 MMSCMD for PLL, leaving spare capacity of \n16 MMSCMD. PLL gas requires additional 9 MMSCMD transmission capacity at 7.5 MMTPA \nproduction, and 18 MMSCMD at 10 MMTPA. With an additional compressor, the HBJ pipeline \ncapacity can be raised by 7 MMSCMD, thus all PLL gas, even at the 10 MMTPA production \nlevel, can be transported through the HBJ pipeline. \n \n                                                 \n15 The India Credit Rating Agency and Credit Rating Information System of India Limited are India\u2019s major credit \nrating agencies. \n ", "10  \n44.  In addition, GAIL is laying a 475 km pipeline connecting Dahej to Uran in Maharashtra, \ntargeting completion within 2006. Once this pipeline is operational, PLL will be able to expand \nits service area to Maharashtra. The Dahej\u2013Uran pipeline will have a capacity of 12 MMSCMD.  \n \n6.  Construction \n45.  The  first  phase  terminal,  except  the  breakwater,  was  successfully  completed  in \naccordance with an EPC contract by a consortium of Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries \nCompany Limited (IHI), Ballast Nedam International BV, Toyo Engineering India Limited, Toyo \nEngineering Corporation, Itochu Corporation, and Mitsui & Company Limited. This consortium \nwas  selected  through  an  ICB.  The  terminal  was  commissioned  on  9  April  2004  and  the \nprovisional acceptance certificate, which marked the commencement of the warranty and the \nlatent defects liability period, was achieved on 13 June 2004. PLL and the EPC contractor \nexecuted a supplemental agreement on 8 December 2005 to remove the breakwater from the \nscope of work and reduce the contract price. \n \n46.  The EPC contract for the third LNG storage tank was awarded to IHI alone without \nbidding.  After  analyzing  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  contracting  with  the  same  or  a \ndifferent contractor, PLL concluded that engaging the original EPC contractor would reduce \nimplementation time as a detailed engineering design could be skipped based on the design \nand drawing for the existing two tanks. As per this lump-sum, fixed-price, date-certain, turnkey \nEPC  contract  dated  9  December  2005,  the  work  has  commenced  and  the  tank  will  be \ncompleted by 26 December 2008. The third tank is being constructed ahead of the expansion \nfacilities to allow increase of output even before completion of the expansion facilities if short-\nterm LNG supply can be arranged. \n \n47.  The EPC contract for the expansion facilities was awarded through a fresh ICB to a \nconsortium  comprising  IHI,  Toyo  Engineering  India  Limited,  Toyo  Engineering  Corporation, \nItochu Corporation, and Mitsui & Company Limited. This contract, dated 23 January 2006, is \nalso on a lump-sum, fixed-price, date-certain, turnkey basis, with performance guarantees. The \nguaranteed provisional acceptance date is 26 June 2008 for the regasification facilities and 26 \nDecember 2008 for the fourth tank. Adding a 3-month commissioning period, the expansion \nfacilities will be ready to commence commercial operations by the end of March 2009.  \n \n7.  Operation and Maintenance \n48.  Following  industry  practice,  PLL,  as  the  owner,  has  operated  and  maintained  the \nterminal with its in-house staff. PLL was supported with key personnel for the initial period from \nONGC and technical support from GDFI. As per the technical services agreement, dated 21 \nOctober 2003, GDFI provided comprehensive training of operators and managers at GDF\u2019s \nfacilities, onboard LNG tankers, and at the Dahej terminal. GDF developed and updated the \noperating  procedure  from  time  to  time.  The  technical  services  agreement,  scheduled  to \nterminate on 1 September 2005, was extended until 31 August 2006 with a reduced scope of \nwork, focusing on safety aspects, in particular, ensuring that a proper lock-out procedure is \nfollowed  in  case  of  LNG  leakage.  According  to  GDF,  the  terminal  system  is  already  well \nunderstood by PLL and the certification of compliance was obtained.   \n \nD.  Environmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n49.  The  first  phase  terminal  was  assigned  environmental  category  A.  However,  the \nproposed  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B  as  the  major  facilities  to  be \n ", " \n11\nconstructed during the expansion phase will involve only two additional storage tanks and \nassociated equipment. Both of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) reports, one for \nonshore storage and regasification facilities and the other for marine facilities, were updated. \nThe existing LNG terminal received a no-objection certificate from the Gujarat Pollution Control \nBoard based on the original EIA reports prepared during 1999\u20132000, which also cover the \nsecond phase of development. However, the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MEF) granted \nenvironmental clearance only for the first phase development. PLL submitted the two updated \nEIA reports to MEF in April 2005 and received environmental clearance for the Project from \nMEF on 23 November 2005.16 The summary initial environmental examination was prepared in \nline with ADB\u2019s environmental and social safeguard policies and information disclosure for \nenvironmental category B projects. The summary initial environmental examination is based on \nthe existing EIA documents as well as the two updated EIA reports, and has been posted on the \nADB website. The Project is being implemented within the existing site and no additional land \nacquisition is required. The Project is not being implemented in areas inhabited by indigenous \npeople. The Project has been assigned category C for impact on involuntary resettlement and \nindigenous people. \n \n50.  PLL has been accredited with ISO 9001, OHSAS 18001 for it occupational health and \nsafety management system, and ISO 14001 for its environmental management system. In \naddition, PLL strictly enforces a policy and a manual on health, safety, and environment, which \nincludes an emergency response plan. Since the commencement of operations, the existing \nLNG  terminal  has  not  experienced  major  incidents  related  to  environment  and  safety  or \noccupational  health.  Environmental  mitigation  measures  and  a  monitoring  program  for  the \nconstruction and operation phases of the Project were developed from the existing measures \nand program, which are based on best practices of LNG industries. The impact of construction \nactivities  of  the  two  LNG  storage  tanks,  such  as  dust,  noise,  and  emissions  of  heavy \nconstruction equipment and vehicles, will be insignificant and confined within the existing project \nsite with no communities nearby. The health, safety, and environment unit will monitor the EPC \ncontractor\u2019s compliance with the requirements of Gujarat Pollution Control Board and MEF. \nDuring operation, the only cumulative environmental impacts of the Project will be increased \ngaseous emissions from the additional gas turbine generators and vaporizers. Natural gas is \nconsidered a clean fuel with a low impact on air quality. Nitrogen oxide, the major air pollutant, \nwill be controlled through the use of lean-burn technology in the gas turbine generators, and \nhigh  stacks  for  rapid  dispersion  of  emissions.  The  emission  of  nitrogen  oxides  after  the \nexpansion is predicted to be within the limit prescribed under the National Ambient Air Quality \nStandard.17 \n \n51.  Safety is the key issue for LNG terminal operations. The major risks are pool-fires and \nvapor  dispersion  if  LNG  spills  or  leaks  from  the  storage  tanks,  pipelines,  and  process \nequipment.  PLL  will  comply  with  the  well-established  industry  standards  for  design, \nconstruction, and operation of LNG terminal facilities,18 as well as emergency response and \ndisaster management plan and procedures, which were adopted during the phase I project. The \n                                                 \n16 In updating the EIA for the Project, public consultation was carried out in a more limited scale since the public \nconsultation during the previous EIA already included public meetings and newspaper announcements to inform \nthe public of the Project and solicit their comments and covered the full-scale development. In addition, the Project \nis located within the boundary of the existing project site. PLL published the project information as well as the \nMEF\u2019s environmental clearance on 30 November 2005 in two local newspapers and also on MEF\u2019s website. No \npublic concerns were received after the publication of the project information.  \n17 Based on a model of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. \n18 Both the national design codes, i.e., the Oil Industry Safety Directorate OISD\u201494, and the international design \nstandards, i.e., the European standard, EN\u20141473, the US National Fire Protection Association standard, NFPA\u2014\n59A and British Standard BS777. \n ", "12  \ntwo additional storage tanks will be full containment tanks, following the same standards as the \ntwo existing LNG storage tanks. Full containment tanks have the highest standard of safety \nfeatures compared with single and double containment tanks. The standard practices reduce \nthe probability of explosion and pool fire caused by LNG leakage from pipes and storage tanks \nto extremely low levels.19 The consequence analysis of an LNG leakage under the EIA of the \nphase I project indicated that the vapor dispersion exclusion zone and thermal exclusion zone \nare within the site boundary. \n \n52.  The facilities not within the scope of the Project but associated with the Project are the \nthree pipelines that transport or will transport the gas from the Project: Dahej\u2013Vemar, Vemar\u2013\nBijaypur, and Dahej\u2013Uran pipelines. All are owned and operated by GAIL. The Dahej\u2013Vemar \nand  Vemar\u2013Bijaypur  pipelines  received  no-objection  certificates  from  the  pollution  control \nboards of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh states and MEF environmental clearance, and are \nalready in operation. The 82 km Dahej\u2013Vemar pipeline was constructed on a new right-of-way \nacquired by GAIL. The 528 km Vemar\u2013Bijaypur pipeline was constructed parallel to the original \nHBJ pipeline on the existing right-of-way owned by GAIL. According to GAIL, the handover of \nland was temporary and the affected people were duly compensated. In July 2004 the new 475 \nkm Dahej\u2013Uran pipeline received environmental clearance from MEF; construction is expected \nto be completed by the end of 2006. The EIA of the Dahej\u2013Uran pipeline found no significant \nenvironmental impacts; the pipeline corridor will not traverse ecologically sensitive areas. Due \ndiligence is ongoing on the handover and compensation process of the land for the Dahej\u2013Uran \npipeline.  \n \nE.  Development Impact \n1.  Impact, Outcome, and Output \n \n53.  The Project aims to promote India\u2019s sustainable economic development by providing \ncleaner and lower cost energy. With the duly completed and operated expansion facilities of the \nLNG  terminal  (outputs),  the  Project  will  provide  additional  natural  gas  to  industrial  and \nhousehold users (outcome). The Project will help India increase energy supply, shift to cleaner \nenergy away from more polluting energy, and enhance energy security by diversifying the \nenergy base (impact).  \n \n2.  Development Effectiveness \n \n54.  The development effectiveness of the Project will be assessed in terms of private sector \ndevelopment,  business  success,  and  economic  sustainability  as  per  the  guidelines  for \nimplementing  the  Good  Practice  Standards  for  Evaluation  of  Private  Sector  Investment \nOperations prepared by the Evaluation Cooperation Group of multilateral development banks. In \nterms of private sector development impact at the company level, the first phase terminal has \ntransferred managerial and operational know-how and skills required of an LNG terminal for the \nfirst  time  to  India  through  technical  support  by  GDFI.  Through  expanded  operation  of  the \nterminal, the Project will continue to improve the skills and knowledge of local staff. During the 3 \nyears of construction, PLL will employ about 500 workers on average. Currently, PLL employs \nabout 145 staff for its existing operations at the terminal and 55 staff at its head office in Delhi. \nAn additional 176 staff will be employed indirectly through shipping LNG, outsourcing jetty \nmanagement, and security. The Project is expected to increase the total number of staff at the \n                                                 \n19 The probability for pipeline rupture is estimated at 9 x 10-9 per year, while that for the LNG storage tank on fire is 2 \nx 10\u201328. \n ", " \n13\nterminal to 204. The Project is expected to yield private sector development impact beyond the \ncompany.  The  first  phase  terminal  has  demonstrated  that  an  LNG  terminal  could  be \nimplemented as a public-private partnership successfully and profitably in India and could attract \ncommercial  financing.  The  Project  will  (i)  demonstrate  good  practices  in  public-private \npartnership in infrastructure development and financing; (ii) provide a benchmark for other gas \nproducers  in  terms  of  pricing  and  operation;  (iii)  promote  competition;  (iv)  facilitate \nrationalization of gas price; and (v) in the long run, improve efficiency in the gas subsector and \ncontribute  to  the  generation  of  more  affordable  environment-friendly  energy.  The  Project\u2019s \ndevelopment effectiveness framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nF.  Economic Evaluation \n55.  The economic analysis of the Project was carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor the Economic Analysis of Projects. The economic analysis adopts conservative assumptions \nand covers the same period as the financial evaluation. The incremental gas supply from the \nProject will meet both incremental and nonincremental demand. Incremental demand stems from \nthe expansion of industrial projects, and economic benefits are the economic value-added of \nthese projects. Nonincremental demand represents the replacement of more expensive fuel like \nnaphtha, and resource cost savings are treated as economic benefits.  \n \n56.  Economic costs include both incremental costs directly related to the expansion of the \nLNG terminal and incremental costs of associated facilities, which are borne by the offtakers \nand end users. Incremental costs incurred by PLL include capital costs and operation and \nmaintenance costs. A shadow exchange rate factor was applied to traded components of the \ncosts. Labor conversion factors were applied to unskilled and skilled labor. The economic \ninternal rate of return is estimated at 28.6%, which is above the social discount rate of 12%. The \nresults of the sensitivity analysis indicate that the Project will be economically robust and viable \nunder adverse scenarios.  \nV.  THE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \nA.  Loan \n57.  The proposed ADB loan of up to Rs6.750 billion to PLL will be denominated in Indian \nrupees and provided from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources without government guarantee but \nwith a KfW PCG covering up to Rs3.375 billion of amounts outstanding under the ADB loan. \nADB will be exposed to the credit risk of KfW, which is rated AAA; therefore ADB\u2019s net exposure \nto the risk of PLL will be reduced. The financing structure whereby KfW participates with a PCG \nin the ADB loan is proposed for two reasons. First, by having risk participation by a third party \nfinancial institution, ADB\u2019s net exposure to the risk of PLL could be reduced to the level within \nADB\u2019s  single  project  exposure  limit  applicable  for  nonsovereign  guaranteed  operations.20 \n                                                 \n20 Reducing ADB\u2019s risk exposure to a project by obtaining a guarantee from another financial institution was \nenvisaged in ADB. 1985. Bank Assistance to the Private Sector. Manila (R58-85 dated 25 June. Paragraphs 25\u201327 \nof this paper read: \u201cOne of the principal concerns regarding this facility [lending without government guarantee] is \nthat Bank loans to private enterprises without a DMC [developing member country] government guarantee will \ninevitably involve higher risk in comparison with loans guaranteed or relent through DMC governments\u2026..In the \nshort term, the Bank will have to adopt other measures to minimize and safeguard against the risk of providing \nloans without government guarantee\u2026..Where necessary, the Bank could also seek a guarantee for its loan from a \nfinancial institution acceptable to the Bank, or obtain appropriate collateral arrangements or other forms of \nsecurity.\u201d Catalyzing larger funds through risk-sharing is also one of the pilot financing instruments envisaged \nunder the Innovations and Efficiency Initiative launched in November 2003. ADB. 2005. Innovation and Efficiency \nInitiative: Pilot Financing Instruments and Modalities. Manila (R194-05 dated 4 August). \n ", "14  \nSecond, this structure would enable KfW, which does not currently have rupee funding capacity, \nto assist a project that needs long-term rupee financing.  \n \n58.  ADB has an existing equity investment in PLL. The ADB loan amount will be determined \nso that ADB\u2019s total net exposure to the PLL risk, including that from ADB\u2019s existing equity \ninvestment in PLL, and taking into account the KfW PCG coverage will be up to Rs3.375 billion \n(equivalent to $75 million), the single project exposure limit.  \n \nB.  Justification  \n59.  The Project merits ADB support for the following reasons:  \n \n(i)  The Project will help India meet the growing demand for energy and contribute to \nIndia\u2019s sustainable economic development by providing cleaner and lower cost \nfuel and feedstock to industrial users and households. The Project will enable \nsupply of natural gas to several cities and towns in north India for provision of \ncompressed natural gas for industrial and public transportation use. This will help \nreduce pollution levels.21 \n \n(ii)  The Project will enhance energy security by diversifying the energy base away \nfrom coal and imported oil. India is close to large gas reserves in the Middle East \nand Central Asia, and so the rationale for increasing LNG receiving terminal \ncapacity on India\u2019s west coast is strong. Alternative plans to import gas through \ntranscontinental pipelines require prior resolution of technical and political issues, \nwhich will take time. \n \n(iii)  PLL operates the first LNG terminal in India and ADB\u2019s support since project \nconceptualization has had demonstration effects and promoted strategic private \nsector  investment  in  the  gas  sector.  ADB\u2019s  involvement  in  the  Project  will \nstrengthen PLL\u2019s operation as a private sector entity and facilitate PLL\u2019s dialogue \nwith the Government on gas sector reform. \n \n(iv)  The Project (a) embodies ADB\u2019s country and energy strategies, which emphasize \nsupporting energy infrastructure development with private sector participation; (b) \nsupports  thematic  priorities  of  economic  development,  private  sector \ndevelopment, good governance, and environmental protection; (c) demonstrates \ngood practices in public-private partnership in infrastructure development; and (d) \nwill  transfer  the  best  available  technology  and  know-how  in  LNG  terminal \noperation.  \n \n(v)  ADB\u2019s  loan  will  provide  rupee-denominated  long-term  financing  with  a  fixed \ninterest rate, much needed for infrastructure development in India. Long-term, \nlocal  currency,  fixed  interest  rate  financing  enhances  sustainability  and \naffordability  of  projects  and  avoids  a  mismatch  between  the  currency  of \nborrowing and the currency of revenue. Indian financial institutions have limited \ncapacity to provide long-term, fixed-rate funding. \n \n                                                 \n21 ADB is also supporting construction of gas distribution networks in Kanpur to deliver compressed natural gas to \nvehicles  and  piped  natural  gas  to  commercial,  industrial,  and  residential  users.

Anticorruption and Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n60.  PLL  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policies  on  anticorruption22  and  combating  of  money \nlaundering and the financing of terrorism.23 Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB will require PLL to maintain and comply with internal \nprocedures  and  controls  following  international  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of \npreventing corruption or money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism, and covenant \nwith ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. The financing documentation between ABD \nand PLL will allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \nVI.  REQUEST TO WAIVE CERTAIN INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS \n61.  The proposed loan of up to Rs6.750 billion to PLL will, once approved, represent 8.0% of \nthe total exposure of ADB\u2019s private sector operations\u2019 portfolio and will exceed the single \nproject, group, and sector exposure limits as shown in Table 6. However, if the portion of the \nloan guaranteed by KfW is deducted from the computation of the exposure to PLL risk, the \nresidual net exposure to PLL\u2019s risk would be up to $75 million equivalent, within the single \nproject  and  group  exposure  limits.  ADB\u2019s  Risk  Management  Unit  has  considered  these \nbreaches and supports a waiver of each of these limits for the proposed ADB assistance. Board \napproval is requested on the waiver of the single project exposure limit. Management has \nendorsed this request and endorsed the waivers of the group and sector exposure limits. \n \n                                                 \n22  ADB. 1998. Anticorruption.

Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) was formed in 1976 as a result of the \namalgamation of Burmah Shell Oil Storage and Distribution Company of India Limited with \nBurmah Shell Refineries Limited. BPCL\u2019s paid-up capital as of 31 March 2005 was Rs3 billion, \nof which the Government held 66.2%. BPCL is listed on the national, Calcutta, Delhi, Madras, \nand Mumbai stock exchanges; and is rated AAA by the Credit Rating Information System of \nIndia Limited. It ranked 429th in the Fortune 500 list.  \n \n2.  BPCL  operates  an  integrated  refinery,  and  markets  petroleum  products  including \nlubricant and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). It is India\u2019s second largest petroleum company, \nwith about a 22% share of the domestic petroleum market. BPCL recorded crude throughput of \n19.10 million metric tons per annum (MMTPA) (including BPCL\u2019s refinery at Mumbai, Kochi \nRefineries Limited [KRL] and Numaligarh Refinery Limited) and market sales of 21.8 MMTPA in \nFY2005. The group\u2019s net sales increased from Rs555.6 billion in FY2004 to Rs644.2 billion in \nFY2005. However, its net profit declined from Rs23.6 billion to Rs20.7 billion due mainly to the \ncontrol  over  retail  petroleum  prices  and  reduction  in  marketing  margin.  BPCL\u2019s  marketing \nbusiness is required to purchase its products from refineries at import parity prices, while it is \nsubject  to  government  controls  on  retail  prices.  Nevertheless,  the  adverse  impact  on  the \nmarketing  margin  has  been  partially  offset  by  the  strong  refinery  margin  due  to  a  rise  in \npetroleum  prices.  In  addition,  the  Government  has  implemented  measures  to  revive  the \ndeteriorating financial condition of oil marketing companies by allowing limited price increases in \nJune and September 2005, and requiring upstream oil companies to offer discounts to oil \nmarketing  companies.  These  factors  contributed  to  BPCL\u2019s  stable  financial  performance. \nBPCL\u2019s consolidated financial statements are summarized in Table A4.1. \n \n3.  Currently, BPCL\u2019s organization structure consists of one asset-based strategic business \nunit, which is a refinery, and five customer interface strategic business units along its product \nlines, i.e., aviation, industrial and commercial, LPG, lubricants, and retail. BPCL recently merged \nwith KRL, its subsidiary with a 54.81% stake. KRL benefited from a high refining margin in \nFY2005 and recorded net profit of Rs8.42 billion, an increase of 52% from the previous year. \nThe merger will result in savings due to synergies in its operations and savings on sales tax, \nwhich KRL has been paying on its output sold to BPCL.  \n \n4.

GAIL (India) Limited  \n \n5.  GAIL (India) Limited (GAIL), the principal gas transmission and marketing company in \nIndia, was set up by the Government in 1984 to create infrastructure for sustained development \nof the market in the country. Since its establishment, GAIL has expanded into gas processing, \npetrochemicals,  LPG  transmission,  liquefied  natural  gas  (LNG)  regasification,  city  gas \ndistribution, exploration and production, and telecommunications. As of 31 March 2005, GAIL\u2019s \npaid-up share capital was Rs8.46 billion, of which the Government held 57.3%; its market \ncapitalization was recorded at Rs179.45 billion. GAIL is listed on the Mumbai and national stock \nexchanges in India; as well as the London Stock Exchange. In 2005, GAIL was ranked among \nthe top 10 Indian companies in terms of profits and revenues. It is rated AAA by the India Credit \nRating Agency.  \n \n6.  Currently, GAIL has a near monopoly position in the natural gas transmission business \nthrough its ownership and operation of India\u2019s largest gas transmission networks for the total \nlength  of  5,340  kilometers  (km),  representing  88%  market  share.  In  addition,  it  owns  and \noperates the world\u2019s longest exclusive LPG pipeline with total length of 1,269 km; seven gas \nprocessing facilities with aggregate capacity of 1.3 MMTPA of LPG, propane, and other liquid \nhydrocarbons; and India\u2019s largest gas-based petrochemicals complex. \n \n7.  GAIL is the sole transporter and the principal marketer of the regasified LNG from PLL. \nGAIL has constructed a 610 km long pipeline from Dahej in Gujarat to Bijaypur in Madhya \nPradesh to evacuate LNG from the Dahej terminal. The Dahej\u2013Bijaypur pipeline has increased \nthe  transmission  capacity  along  the  Hazira\u2013Bijaypur\u2013Jadgishpur  corridor  by  23  MMSCMD. \nMoreover, GAIL is now expanding its pipeline network by constructing the Dahej\u2013Uran pipeline \nand  Bijaypur\u2013Kota  pipeline.  The  Dahej\u2013Uran  475  km  pipeline,  which  is  scheduled  to  be \ncompleted  by  December  2006,  will  link  the  two  important  gas  markets  of  Gujarat  and \nMaharashtra; and enable Maharashtra to have access to other gas sources than the currently \n ", "Appendix 4  25 \nsole supply from the Bombay high fields, which is decreasing. The Bijaypur\u2013Kota pipeline will be \ncompleted by December 2006 and will supply LNG mainly to Rajasthan.  \n \n8.  The fixed transmission charges and subsidized price of natural gas, which is used as \ninput in the LPG and petrochemical business, have contributed to GAIL\u2019s high profitability. \nDuring FY2005, GAIL exhibited growth in all its businesses. The sale of gas rose from 21.0 \nbillion cubic meters in FY2004 to 22.8 billion cubic meters in FY2005. Other petroleum products \nalso recorded an increase in sales. The company\u2019s total revenues increased from Rs122.3 \nbillon in FY2004 to Rs139.1 billion in FY2005, while its net profits registered a slight increase \nfrom Rs28.1 billion to Rs28.7 billion. With strong operating cash flows and low working capital \nrequirements, GAIL has been able to finance its capital investments through minimal use of debt. \nGAIL\u2019s financial statements are summarized in Table A4.2. \n \n9.  Going forward, GAIL plans to expand its national gas transmission network and its \ngrowth in other downstream activities. It will be subject to the recently approved Petroleum and \nNatural Gas Regulatory Board Bill, which allows open access in transmission infrastructure. \nAdditional  regasification  capacity  of  PLL  through  the  expansion  of  the  Dahej  terminal  and \nconstruction of the Kochi terminal will increase the volume of its LNG marketing business. Given \nthe substantial unmet demand for LNG in India and price competitiveness of LNG compared \nwith other more expensive fuels such as naphtha, the risks associated with LNG marketing are \nbelieved to be relatively low over the medium term. Aside from the LNG business, GAIL plans to \nexpand the capacity of its petrochemical complex from 300,000 tons to 450,000 tons by 2007. \nFurthermore, GAIL, through its wholly owned subsidiary GAIL Global (Singapore) Pte. Limited \n(GAIL Global), will continue to explore international business opportunities. During FY2005, \nGAIL Global acquired a 15% equity stake in National Gas, one of the largest local distribution \ncompanies in Egypt; and 8.5% participating interest in China Gas Holding Company, which \nprovides natural gas supply to residential, industrial, and commercial sectors in the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. GAIL has been accredited with ISO 9002 and ISO 14001 for its pipeline \nsystem and LPG plants.  \n \n ", "26  Appendix 4 \nTable A4.2: Financial Summary of GAIL (India) Limited \n(Rs million) \nItem  FY2003 FY2004  FY2005\nIncome Statement Data       \nSales  99,982           105,418             120,373 \nOther Income         16,712              16,860               18,763 \nTotal Income       116,694            122,278             139,136 \nExpenditures         83,678            103,174             118,062 \nEBITDA         33,390              36,138            39,530 \nNet Profit         25,100              28,118               28,723 \nBalance Sheet Data       \nCurrent Assets        46,437             41,071               64,140 \nFixed Assets and Intangible Assets         69,502              89,574               81,550 \nTotal Assets       122,818            138,364             153,529 \nCurrent Liabilities         27,760              30,302               34,742 \nLoans         20,471              21,335               19,974 \nTotal Liabilities         59,428              63,913               67,268 \nShareholders' Equity         63,391              74,452               86,261 \nRatios       \nEBITDA Margin (%)     28.61     29.55         28.41 \nNet Profit Margin (%)        21.51        23.00     20.64 \nLong-Term Debt to Equity Ratio          0.50           0.45        0.38 \nReturn on Equity (%)           39.60            37.77           33.30 \nEBITDA= earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization, FY = fiscal year. \nSource: GAIL (India) Limited. \n \nC.  Indian Oil Corporation Limited \n \n10.  Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOC) has engaged in the oil and gas business since its \nestablishment in 1964 through the merger of Indian Oil Company Limited and Indian Refineries \nLimited. IOC refines and markets petroleum and its derivatives. It is currently India\u2019s largest \ncompany by sales with consolidated turnover of Rs1.51 trillion and net profits of Rs48.91 billion \nin FY2005. In 2005, IOC was ranked 170th in the Fortune Global 500 listing, the highest ranked \nIndian company. It was also the 18th largest petroleum company in the world and the first-\nranked petroleum trading company among the national oil companies in the Asia-Pacific region. \nIOC\u2019s paid up capital as of 31 March 2005 was Rs11.68 billion, of which the Government held \n82%. IOC is listed on the national and Mumbai stock exchanges. IOC\u2019s international credit \nratings are Baa3 by Moody\u2019s and BB+ by Standard and Poor\u2019s, and its local credit rating by the \nIndia Credit Rating Agency is AAA. \n \n11.  IOC and its subsidiaries account for 56% market share of petroleum products among \npublic sector oil companies, 42% of national refining capacity, and 69% of downstream pipeline \nthroughput capacity. IOC\u2019s group owns and operates 10 of India\u2019s 18 refineries with a combined \nrefining capacity of 54.2 MMTPA. The refinery business registered a record throughput of 36.63 \nMMTPA during FY2005 with capacity utilization rate of 88.6%. All refinery units are accredited \nwith ISO 9002 and ISO 14001 certifications. IOC owns and operates the country\u2019s largest \nnetwork of 8,892 km of crude oil and petroleum product pipelines for combined capacity of \n60.42 MMTPA. Furthermore, IOC operates the largest and widest network of retail outlets in the \ncountry with the sale of 50.13 million tons of petroleum products, and has reached a significant \nmilestone  with  the  commissioning  of  the  company\u2019s  10,000th  petrol  station  in  FY2005. \nRegarding its gas business, IOC has already been marketing 5.26 MMSCMD. In addition to the \n ", "Appendix 4  27 \ninvestment  in  PLL,  IOC  along  with  its  subsidiary  Chennai  Petroleum  Corporation  plans  to \ndevelop an LNG import terminal at Ennore near Chennai.  \n \n12.  Losses from the retail marketing business due to government price controls on LPG, \ndiesel, and other petroleum products have been partly offset by improved refining margins and \nthe stable contribution from its pipeline operations (Table A4.3). An increasing output of refined \nproducts from planned new capacities at a faster pace than domestic demand is expected to \nworsen the oversupply situation and negatively affect the refining margin. However, IOC has \ncompetitive advantage over its competitors given that over 67% of its refining capacity is in the \nnorthwest  where  demand  is  relatively  vibrant  and  its  ownership  of  a  downstream  pipeline \nenhances its ability to sell its products. Government ownership, along with IOC\u2019s integrated and \ndiversified operations and its adequate financial profile are anticipated to mitigate the adverse \nimpact on its marketing business if government controls on petroleum retail prices continue. IOC \nhas set a revenue target of $60 billion by FY2012 and plans to achieve this by continuing its \nvertical integration strategy forward into petrochemicals and backward into exploration and \nproduction of crude oil as well as diversifying its natural gas business.    \n \nTable A4.3: Financial Summary of Indian Oil Corporation Limited \n(Rs million) \nItem  FY2003 FY2004 FY2005\nIncome Statement Data     \nSales    1,010,132         1,134,015         1,316,440 \nOther Income       117,312              56,985              53,535 \nTotal Income    1,127,444         1,191,000         1,369,975 \nExpenditures    1,006,191         1,055,351         1,261,688 \nEBITDA       121,253            135,649            108,287 \nNet Profit         66,627              78,374              59,009 \nBalance Sheet Data \nCurrent Assets       273,311            278,607            356,350 \nFixed Assets and Intangible Assets       295,269            327,706            377,820 \nTotal Assets       613,892            653,453            781,780 \nCurrent Liabilities       197,160            203,373            236,360 \nLoans       169,428            149,461            203,298 \nTotal Liabilities       409,580            400,998            490,214 \nShareholders' Equity       204,312            252,456            291,566 \nRatios \nEBITDA Margin (%)           10.75                11.39                  7.90 \nNet Profit Margin (%)             5.91                  6.58                  4.31 \nLong-Term Debt to Equity Ratio             1.04                  0.78                  0.87 \nReturn on Equity (%)           32.61                31.04                20.24 \nEBITDA= earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization, FY = fiscal year. \nSource: India Oil Corporation Limited. \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20060905084400+08'00'", "Author": "PL4", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20060906095141+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - RRP IND Dahej MAIN TEXT abbreviated_REVISED_31Aug06.doc"}, "author_page": "   \n \nNOTES \n(i)  In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \n(ii)  The fiscal year (FY) ends on 31 March.
