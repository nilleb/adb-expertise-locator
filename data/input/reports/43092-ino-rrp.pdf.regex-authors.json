It is \na  continuation  of  DPSPs  1\u20134.  The  DPSP  series\u2014cofinancing  the \nDevelopment Policy Loan (DPL) series supported by the World Bank and \nthe Government of Japan\u2014is embedded in the Government\u2019s Medium-\nTerm National Development Plan (RPJM) for 2004\u20132009. It supports the \nRPJM\u2019s  broad  goals  of  stimulating  higher  and  sustainable  economic \ngrowth, with lower levels of unemployment and poverty, in three core areas: \n(i) investment climate, (ii) public financial management and governance, \nand (iii) poverty alleviation and public service delivery to the poor. DPSP-5 \nis  also  a  single-tranche  operation  based  on  completed  actions \ndemonstrating satisfactory progress. It builds on reforms undertaken during \npast DPSPs and establishes policy actions for possible future operation. \n   \nRationale  The primary rationale of DPSP-5 is to reinforce the Government\u2019s efforts to \nimprove  competitiveness,  enhance  public  financial  management  and \ngovernance,  and  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  and  improved  public \nservice delivery to the poor. In addition, the DPL series aims to harmonize \npolicy reform support from key development partners. The involvement of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the DPL process effectively builds \non and deepens reforms supported by ADB through its past, ongoing, and \nplanned  operations  under  the  Indonesia  country  strategy  and  program \n2006\u20132009. \n \nADB\u2019s participation in the DPL also aims to improve aid effectiveness by \nreducing  transaction  costs  for  its  developing  member  countries.  The \napproach is consistent with ADB\u2019s reform agenda, as outlined in the long-\nterm  strategic  framework  and  the  middle-income  country  initiative. \nParticipation in the DPL helps implement and fulfill ADB\u2019s obligations to the \nParis  Declaration  on  Aid  Effectiveness  (March  2005)  and  the  Jakarta \nCommitment (2009). ", "ii   \nImpact and  The proposed Program will contribute to higher pro-poor economic growth \nOutcome  sustained over the medium term. The expected outcome of the Program is \nimproved overall economic management anchored in good governance. \nThe Program's outputs, which are expected to underpin the outcome, are \n(i)  an  improved  investment  climate,  (ii)  improved  public  financial \nmanagement  and  governance,  and  (iii)  reduced  poverty  and  improved \npublic service delivery to the poor. \n   \nFinancing Plan  For DPSP-5, the Government has requested that ADB provide a loan of \n$200 million. DPSP-5 will provide parallel cofinancing for the World Bank-\nsupported sixth DPL (DPL-6), for which the Government requested $750 \nmillion. The Government also intends to request parallel cofinancing of \n$100 million from the Government of Japan for DPL-6. \n   \nLoan Amount  A single-tranche program loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nand Terms  resources  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 15-year term, including \na grace period of 3 years; an interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nannum; conversion options that may be exercised in accordance with the \ndraft  Loan  Agreement,  the  loan  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  conversion \nguidelines; and such other terms and conditions as are set forth in the draft \nLoan Agreement. \n   \nDisbursement  The loan will be disbursed in a single tranche upon declaration of loan \neffectiveness. \n   \nProgram Period  The  program  implementation  period  for  DPSP-5  is  from  January  to \nDecember  2009.  All  actions  included  in  the  policy  matrix  have  been \nimplemented within the year. DPSP-5 fits within the overall reform agenda \nsupported under the DPLs, which cover the period 2003\u20132009. \n   \nExecuting  Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs \nAgency \n   \nProcurement  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs \n(excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB \nmember countries, excluding ineligible items and imports financed by other \nbilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of \nADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements  for  Program  Loans  (1998),  the  loan  proceeds  will  be \ndisbursed to the Republic of Indonesia as the Borrower. No supporting \nimport  documentation  will  be  required  if,  during  each  year  when  loan \nproceeds  are  expected  to  be  disbursed,  the  value  of  Indonesia\u2019s  total \nimports minus imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and \nimports financed under other official development assistance is equal to or \ngreater than the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during such \nyear. The Government will certify its compliance with this formula with each \nwithdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing \nprocedures will be required. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of loan \nproceeds and verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. ", "  iii\n   \nProgram  The key benefits expected from the DPSP series are (i) progress toward \nBenefits and  the Government\u2019s medium-term objectives of macroeconomic stability and \nBeneficiaries  creditworthiness, an improved investment climate, better public financial \nmanagement  and  governance,  reduced  poverty,  and  improved  public \nservice delivery; (ii) raising the profile of key policy issues at the ministerial \nlevel, accelerating the timetable for policy actions to be taken, addressing \nadministrative and bureaucratic bottlenecks to reform, and providing an \nimpetus for decision makers to coordinate further across economic and line \nministries;  (iii)  institutional  development  within  government  institutions; \n(iv) sustained ADB engagement in policy dialogue with the Government on \nthe direction and content of, and strategies for, its economic, structural, and \ninstitutional reform  agenda\u2014with  DPSP-5  providing  for policy  continuity \nand  consistency  in  sectors  where  ADB  has  been  actively  involved; \n(v) facilitation, through crosscutting reforms, of reforms in sectors where \nADB is providing or planning support; and (vii) harmonization and parallel \nfinancing  by  the  key  development  partners  (ADB,  the  Government  of \nJapan,  and  the  World  Bank)  around  a  common  policy  framework  and \ndialogue, and the resulting endorsement of the Government\u2019s sound policy \nimplementation and macroeconomic management. \n \nRisks and  Implementation of the DPSP series is subject to the following risks:  \nSafeguards  (i)  External  vulnerabilities.  Indonesia  has  weathered  the  global \neconomic  crisis  well,  reflecting  increased  resilience  to  external \nshocks  built  up  before  the  crisis.  Nevertheless,  risks  remain. \nIndonesia  has  an  open  financial  system.  Domestic  residents  can \nswitch to foreign assets easily and foreign holdings are significant, \nespecially in the stock market and in government bonds. Indonesia is \nthus vulnerable to shifts in investor sentiment. If significant funds are \npulled back because of liquidity demands in the US and elsewhere \nand/or increased emerging market risk aversion, this could lead to \nincreased  pressure  on  domestic  interest  and  exchange  rates.  In \naddition, the Government has large gross financing needs over the \nnext  few  years,  and  tighter  credit  markets  and  increased  risk \naversion  could  limit  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  tap  international \nfinancial markets. This could force the Government to cut budgetary \noutlays to maintain fiscal balance, with adverse consequences for \ninfrastructure  investment  and  social  expenditures.  It  could  also \ndistract the Government from implementing its medium-term reform \nagenda,  including  those  supported  by  the  DPL/DPSP.  Several \nmeasures  taken  over  the  past  year,  including  bilateral  swap \narrangements with the People's Republic of China and Japan, and \nsupport from the Public Expenditure Support Facility (PESF), will \nhelp  mitigate  this  risk.  Structural  reforms  supported  by  the \nDPL/DPSP would also help maintain investor confidence. \n(ii)  Subsidies. As international oil prices have declined since mid-2008, \ndomestic fuel subsides have also declined. However, a return to high \ninternational fuel prices remains a risk, as the recent increase in \ninternational fuel prices has shown. Fixed domestic fuel prices and \nthe subsidies they create represent a risk to fiscal sustainability in the \nlonger term. They are also regressive and inefficient, and carry high \n ", "iv   \nopportunity costs. The Government has shown that it is willing to \nraise domestic prices and reduce subsidies\u2014most recently in May \n2008. ADB will continue to engage the Government in this area. \n(iii)  Fiduciary  constraints.  Fiduciary  assessments  undertaken  since \n2001  (as  part  of  the  country  financial  accountability  assessment) \nhave indicated considerable improvements. Still, utilization of public \nresources continues to be a concern. Ongoing programs supported \nby  several  development  partners  provide  significant  technical \nassistance support to strengthen fiduciary governance. By focusing \non  improving  budget  preparation,  execution,  and  transparency  in \nfinancial  management,  the  DPL/DPSP  will  significantly  enhance \ntransparency. \n(iv)  Heightened  security  risks.  Alerts  stemming  from  sectarian  and \nregional conflicts and terrorism could slow foreign direct investment \nand  set  back  the  tourism  industry.  The  Government  and  law \nenforcement authorities have taken a range of measures aimed at \nrestoring public and investor confidence. \n \n \n ", "1 \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Indonesia for the Fifth Development Policy Support Program (DPSP-5). The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC AND SECTOR CONTEXT \nA.  Macroeconomic Developments \n2.  Indonesia has performed impressively since its emergence from the Asian crisis of \n1997\u20131998.  Prudent  macroeconomic  management  has  resulted  in  moderate  inflation,  low \nbudget deficits, a sharp decline in public debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio, and a \nhealthy  external  account.  The  rehabilitation  and  consolidation  of  the  banking  sector  and \nregulatory reforms initiated since the crisis have buttressed the financial sector. GDP growth \nhas exceeded 5% in every quarter since 2005, reaching 6.4% in the third quarter of 2008 before \nsuccumbing to the intensifying global economic crisis. Progressively higher GDP growth has led \nto rising per capita real GDP, boosting the average Indonesian citizen's living standards.  \n \n3.  The foundation of macroeconomic and political stability established in the last decade, \ncoupled with the economy's high reliance on domestic demand, has helped Indonesia weather \nthe current global economic crisis. The economic slowdown came later and has been more \nmoderate than in many other countries. GDP growth in the first half of 2009 decelerated to 4.2% \nyear-on-year from 6.1% in 2008, but was higher than in most other countries in Asia. Domestic \ndemand,  led  by  private  and  government  consumption,  was  strong.  Households  recovered \nconfidence as real incomes were supported by moderating inflation, the final tranche of the \nunconditional cash transfer program, and, for rural households, a good harvest. By contrast, \ninvestment spending slowed further in the first half of 2009, reflecting the growth slowdown and \nunclear prospects for the global economy.  \n \n4.  Inflation decelerated to 2.8% in September 2009 from a peak of 12.1% in September \n2008, reflecting declining food and fuel prices, the lagged effects of the tighter monetary policy \nimplemented  in  2008,  and  slower  economic  growth.  Indonesia\u2019s  external  accounts  have \nimproved in 2009; international reserves rose to $62.3 billion in September from $51.6 billion at \nend-2008. Merchandise exports continued to decline in the first half of 2009 with softer external \ndemand and lower international commodity prices. However, imports fell faster on weaker \ndomestic  demand,  especially  investment  demand;  reduced  fuel  imports;  and  a  decline  in \nimported intermediate goods used in export production. Portfolio inflows were buoyant in the \nfirst half of 2009, following large outflows in the fourth quarter of 2008 when uncertainty in global \nfinancial markets peaked and investors' aversion to risk intensified.  \n \n5.  Indonesia's  banks  proved  resilient  to  the  current  global  crisis,  their  balance  sheets \nhaving been rehabilitated and strengthened after the 1997\u20131998 Asian crisis. They had little \ndirect exposure to subprime assets when the current crisis hit. Banking indicators suggest good \nhealth overall. The capital-to-assets ratio is about 17%, and ratio of nonperforming loans is less \nthan 4%. However, lending growth has slowed somewhat, partly reflecting lower demand for \ncredit with the slowdown in investment.  \n \n6.  The authorities' response to the worsening global economic environment last year was \nquick. Among other measures to stabilize the financial system, Bank Indonesia shifted monetary \npolicy away from the anti-inflationary stance of mid-2008 by cutting its reference interest rate by \n ", "2   \n300 basis  points  to  6.5%  between  December  2008  and  August  2009.  With  the  economy \nshowing signs of recovery, Bank Indonesia signaled that its August rate cut was likely to be its \nlast, and its focus has since shifted from supporting demand to monitoring the outlook for \ninflation in 2010.  \n \n7.  The  Government  adopted  a  more  expansionary  fiscal  policy,  including  a  stimulus \npackage equivalent to 1.4% of GDP, in 2009. About 77% of the stimulus package comprised tax \ncuts for low- and middle-income workers, as well as to businesses.1  The remainder consisted \nmainly of spending on labor-intensive infrastructure. The package was designed to provide a \nquick  boost  to  domestic  demand  as  tax  cuts,  and  the  associated  increase  in  disposable \nincomes, especially of lower-income workers, were likely to be spent more quickly than capital \nexpenditures, which are afflicted by slow disbursement.2 The higher deficit, coupled with large \namortization payments on domestic and foreign debt, has increased the Government's financing \nrequirement.  \n \nB.  Sector Performance, Issues and Opportunities \n1.  Investment Climate \n \n8.  The  Government  has  made  significant  progress  in  improving  the  investment \nenvironment. Notable recent reforms include (i) the passage of the amended Income Tax Law, \n2008, which lowered tax rates, simplifies tax administration and increases legal certainty; (ii) the \npassage of the Tax Administration Law, 2007, which strikes a better balance between the rights \nand obligations of taxpayers and the powers of tax officials, an issue of longstanding concern to \nthe business community; (iii) the passage of the law recognizing electronic signatures, which \nclears the way for multiple e-Government initiatives such as electronic registration and filing of \ntax returns; and (iv) the passage of an Investment Law in 2007, providing a single legislative \nframework  for  domestic  and  foreign  investment,  which  for  the  first  time  required  a \ncomprehensive investment negative list. Reform of customs administration is also underway. \n \n9.  Regulatory reforms have improved the ease of establishing and operating a business. \nAccording  to  the  Doing  Business  2010  survey,  Indonesia's  rank  in  overall  ease  of  doing \nbusiness improved to 122 (out of 183 economies) in 2009, from 129 the previous year.3 The \ntime required to set up a business has fallen from 168 days in 2003, to 105 days in 2007, to 60 \ndays  in  2009.  Tax  reform  has  addressed  some  of  the  key  complaints  from  the  business \ncommunity. Reforms in tax administration have halved the average time required to process \nvalue-added  tax  (VAT)  refunds;  in  addition,  more  than  Rp10  trillion  (roughly  $1  billion)  in \noutstanding VAT refunds have been settled. Doing Business 2010 shows a decline in the \nnumber of hours required for an SME to pay applicable taxes, from 560 in 2005 to 266 in 2009. \nPartly as a result of the regulatory reforms, investment rates rose from below 20% of GDP in \n2003 to 27.6% in 2008.  \n \n                                                 \n1  These tax cuts on income were in addition to the decreases in corporate and personal income tax under the \nIncome Tax Law, 2008, which lowered the top marginal tax rate on personal income from 35% to 30%, reduced the \nnumber of income brackets, and increased the minimum threshold for income subject to tax by 20%. It also \nreduced the corporate tax rate to 28% in 2009, to be further lowered to 25% in 2010.  \n2  The low leverage of households in Indonesia means that the increase in disposable incomes is more likely to be \nspent than saved. Also, the marginal propensity to consume of people in the lower-income bracket tends to be \nhigher. \n3   World Bank. 2009. Doing Business 2010. Washington, DC. ", "3 \n10.  It's important to keep in mind that the recent gains have occurred from a low base, and \nthat businesses in Indonesia still face an overall poor business climate compared with other \ncountries.4 The poor relative performance partly reflects the complex challenges Indonesia \nfaces with its recent political transition, geographic dispersion, and decentralized policy-making \nframework, among others. In part, it also reflects other countries' progress in reforming their \ninvestment climates. Indonesia\u2019s rank in overall ease of doing business in the 2010 World Bank \nsurvey  (122),  for  example,  ranks  lower  compared  with  its  regional  peers\u2014Thailand  (12), \nMalaysia (23), the People's Republic of China (89), and Viet Nam (93). Indonesia ranked \nparticularly low (161) in ease of starting a business. Although this is a marked improvement \nfrom 173 in 2008, and is higher than the Philippines (162), the country ranks substantially lower \nthan Thailand (55) and Malaysia (88).  \n \n11.  Simpler, more efficient procedures and lower costs for business entry would stimulate \nthe creation of new companies, foster competition, and facilitate the transfer of workers and \ncapital across sectors, especially when economies experience sector-specific shocks. With high \nfixed costs of entry, firms also cannot easily move into expanding industries that are benefiting \nthe most from trade openness. \n \n12.  As global markets become more integrated, business expansion and job creation are \nmore severely affected by long, costly import and export processes. The delay in exporting by \nan extra day prior to shipping, for example because of cumbersome procedures, is estimated to \nreduce trade volumes by about 1%. For perishable agricultural products the reduction is nearly \n3%. Streamlining documentation requirements, providing electronic filing of trade documents \n(through electronic data interchange systems), and using risk-based inspections are a few key \nmeasures  that  would  reduce  the  time  and  costs  of  importing  and  exporting.  Electronic \ntransmission  of  documents  not  only  speeds  up  the  clearance  of  goods,  but  it  also  often \nimproves governance. One approach for speeding up trade is to provide a single window for \nobtaining  different  permits  and  authorizations,  thereby  reducing  the  time  spent  on \ndocumentation.  \n \n13.  Effective  implementation  of  investment  climate  reforms  has  been  slowed  by  poor \noordination among relevant Government agencies. Uncertainty about the legal framework and \njudicial intervention remains high. The local level investment climate has been of particular \nconcern because of inconsistent and often arbitrary regulation imposed by local governments. \nRecognizing  the  challenges  ahead,  the  Government  has  outlined  a  medium-term  reform \nagenda.5 The Government is placing a high priority on customs and trade facilitation, improving \ntax administration, and continued reform of investment procedures and regulations, among \nothers.  \n \n2.  Public Financial Management and Governance  \n \n14.  The public financial management (PFM) reform program has progressed significantly \nsince the White Paper on public financial management reforms6 was published in 2002. A series \nof laws enacted in 2003 and 2004\u2014on state finance, treasury, state audit, and development \nplanning\u2014provided the legal framework for subsequent reforms. A state budget combining the \n                                                 \n4  Investment climate surveys point to macroeconomic instability, transportation infrastructure, governance issues at \nboth the central and local level, and economic policy uncertainty, among the top five constraints to investment.  \n5  See para 30 for various policy packages, including on investment climate, announced by the Government in recent \nyears. \n6  Financial Management Reform Committee. 2002.

A  chart  of  accounts  broadly  consistent  with  the  Government \nFinance Statistics (GFS) Manual 2001 was introduced in 2005. The Government Accounting \nStandards of 2005 are being adhered to. The Government has also made good progress in \nensuring timely availability of annual financial statements to Parliament and to the public. The \nimplementation of a treasury single account (TSA), under State Treasury Law No. 1/2004, is \nalmost complete.  \n \n15.  Public procurement has also witnessed improvements with the establishment in 2007 of \nan independent agency\u2014LKPP (National Public Procurement Agency), which is responsible for \nplanning and developing strategies, policies and regulations associated with procurement using \npublic funds. The roles and responsibilities of different players in internal and external audit \ninstitutions  have  been  clarified  with  Government  Regulation  60/2008  on  the  Government\u2019s \ninternal controls. The Financial and Development Supervisory Board (BPKP) has received a \nsignificant increase in its operating budget to fund an increase in the number of auditors and \nregional  offices.  Powerful  independent  oversight  and  prosecutorial  institutions  such  as  the \nCorruption Eradication Commission (KPK) and the Anti-Corruption Court have begun to deliver \ntangible results, and parliamentary oversight of budget processes has been strengthened. \n \n16.  These  reforms  have  contributed  to  improved  governance  (Table  1).  According  to \nindicators compiled by the World Bank across six dimensions of governance, Indonesia's rank \nimproved for all of them between 1998 and 2008. For political stability and regulatory quality, the \ncountry temporarily fell in rank between 1998 and 2004, reflecting fundamental political and \neconomic changes in the aftermath of the 1997\u20131998 Asian crisis, but by 2008 it had more than \nmade up for the loss. Its progress in voice and accountability, government effectiveness, and \ncontrol of corruption is particularly impressive. \n \nTable 1:   Indonesia: Governance Indicators \n  \nRule \n \nVoice and  Political  Government  Regulatory  of  Control of \nYear  Accountability  Stability  Effectiveness  Quality  Law  Corruption \n2008  44.2  15.8  47.4  45.4  28.7  31.4 \n2004  38.5    7.2  40.8  25.9  25.2  18.9 \n1998  16.3  10.1  19.4  39.0  23.8   9.2 \nNote: The numbers in the table refer to percentile rank.

The achievements thus far provide a firm foundation for further progress, but significant \nchallenges remain across the public financial management cycle, including budget formulation, \nexecution, and reporting and auditing.7 While the budget has been unified for presentation and \nreporting  purposes,  the  budget  preparation  process  continues  to  suffer  from  a  de  facto \ncontinuation  of  dual  budgeting,  with  few  links  between  discretionary  and  non-discretionary \nexpenditure, and insufficient emphasis on expenditure prioritization. The 2008 budget included \n                                                 \n7  The June 2008 public expenditure and financial accountability (PEFA) assessment noted that the upstream \nsections of the budget process have been reformed in recent years and that the budget is increasingly credible, \ntransparent, and policy-based. External scrutiny and audit has been equally enhanced but there is still room for \nreform. Lower scores are generally in the downstream sections of the budget process. ", "5 \nfor the first time a medium-term fiscal framework based on aggregate macro-fiscal forecasts of \nboth revenue and expenditures for 2 subsequent years.  \n \n18.  Input-based annual budgeting has contributed to problems in budget execution, causing \nexpenditure releases to remain skewed toward the second half of the fiscal year. Some 50% of \ncapital expenditure is disbursed in the last quarter of the fiscal year. This disrupts project \nimplementation and results in under-spending on needed infrastructure investments. Detailed \ninput controls make it difficult to alter the budget during execution. Spending warrants (DIPAs) \ncontain excessive amounts of detail, leaving little flexibility for adjustments in the composition of \ninputs needed to carry out a given activity. Reallocations across DIPAs from delayed programs \nto better performing ones require lengthy revisions, sometimes involving parliamentary review \nand approval. Spending agencies also do not effectively use their authority to reallocate budgets \nbetween budget line items, either because the authority has not been clearly understood or \nbecause of an inherent preference to pass on the responsibility to the Directorate-General for \nBudget and Directorate-General for Treasury.  \n \n19.  The budget needs to be structured along program lines, where the policy priorities can \nbe easily identified, and where the results of the programs supported by the budget can be \nmonitored and assessed. In addition, public programs must be sustained over a number of \nyears. A strictly annual approach to budgeting limits the Government\u2019s ability to plan and \nexecute its budget in a strategic way, in alignment with both the Government\u2019s priorities and \noverall fiscal sustainability.  \n \n20.  The  budget  execution  process  also  suffers  from  fragmented  data,  inaccurate  and \ndelayed  reporting  of  both  revenue  and  expenditure  transactions,  rudimentary  cash \nmanagement,  and  a  lack  of  information  on  program  execution.  While  a  uniform  chart  of \naccounts exists that is largely consistent with GFS Manual 2001, further strengthening of coding \nof programs, activities, and subactivities is required. The chart of accounts needs to be aligned \nto performance-based budgeting (PBB) and the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF). \nRefinements to transactions coding are required to capture commitments and payables against \nthe line item in the budget for purposes of controlling and reporting budget execution.  \n \n21.  The  development  of  a  TSA  to  strengthen  cash  management  was  a  significant \nachievement, but operational cash planning remains at an early stage of development. Poor \ncash  flow  monitoring  has  perpetuated  year-end  bunching  of  expenditures.  Although  the \ninstitutional setup for procurement is being put in place, the legal framework for public sector \nprocurement needs to be strengthened by anchoring it in an overarching, consolidated, and \ncomprehensive national public procurement law.  \n \n22.  The Government recognizes that numerous challenges remain and that ensuring the \ncoherence of future reforms while maintaining momentum for reform is crucial. The medium-\nterm focus of Government reform efforts is on restructuring budgeted programs and introducing \nan MTEF and PBB, improving the chart of accounts, rolling out the TSA, implementing an \nintegrated financial management information system, passing a new procurement law, and \nimproving internal controls and internal and external audit systems. \n \n3.  Poverty Alleviation and Public Service Delivery \n \n23.  The poverty rate, based on the national poverty line, fell to 14.2% in March 2009 from \n15.4% a year earlier, in spite of the slowdown in economic growth. This reflected a decline in \nfood and fuel prices, a strong harvest, and the Government's cash transfer programs to the poor \n ", "6   \nand the near-poor. But, with 35 million people classified as poor, the poverty rate remains \nelevated. Furthermore, nearly 50% of the country's population are near-poor, living on less than \n$2 a day.8 \n \n24.  Regional disparities in poverty also remain.  For example, the poverty rate in Jakarta is \n4.6%, in contrast to a rate of more than 35% in Papua. Services are unequally distributed \nacross regions, with an undersupply of facilities in remote areas of the country, partly reflecting \nan  underinvestment  in  infrastructure.9  Human  development  indicators  lag  behind  in  some \ndimensions\u2014such as the high maternal mortality rate, malnutrition rate, and low transition from \nprimary school to secondary school. Only 55% of 16- to 18-year-olds from the poorest quintile \ncomplete junior secondary school. A quarter of children below the age of five are malnourished \nand Indonesia\u2019s maternal mortality rate is three times that of Viet Nam. Only 15% of rural \nhouseholds have access to drinking water from piped or pumped sources, and just 21% have \nseptic tanks for disposal of human waste.  \n \n25.   Post-decentralization, about one-third of total public expenditures is allocated to the \ndistrict level. Yet local governments have weak capacity to plan, budget, and execute public \nspending to improve the delivery of public services. In recent years, this has been reflected in \nincreased surpluses run by local governments. Local governments and local service providers \nneed to substantially improve their capacity to plan, budget, and deliver public services. \n \n26.  The challenges are to build on the foundations of macroeconomic and social stability; \nand accelerate growth to reduce unemployment, poverty, and overall levels of vulnerability. \nOver  the  past  few  years,  the  Government  has  launched  several  large-scale  programs  to \nalleviate poverty and improve access of marginalized groups to basic services. To insulate the \npoor from rising fuel prices in 2005 and 2008, it implemented an unconditional cash transfer \nprogram which reached approximately 19.1 million households. In 2007 it began a 3-year scale-\nup  of  its  flagship  poverty  program\u2014National  Community  Empowerment  Program  (PNPM \nMandiri). Village block grants are now being provided to every subdistrict in Indonesia.  \n \n27.  Building on the unconditional cash transfer program, the Government introduced in 2007 \na  pilot  conditional  cash  transfer  program  for  about  700,000  poor  households.  Funds  are \nprovided to poor families who obtain preventive basic health and nutrition services and send \ntheir children to school. In addition, the Government has invested in a range of social assistance \nprograms  that  target  the  poor,  such  as  a  subsidized  rice  scheme,  a  school  operational \nassistance program, and a health insurance reform scheme.  \n \n28.  Such significant investments in a range of social assistance programs demonstrate that \npoverty alleviation remains one of the Government's key development priorities. In addition to \nallocating more resources to poverty alleviation programs,10 the Government will continue to \npursue several critical initiatives to enhance the delivery and effectiveness of poverty programs, \nmaximize the impacts of increased funding, and manage the impact of the global financial crisis \non the most vulnerable segments of society. These include (i) improving poverty program \nevaluation and linking results with budget allocation and planning; (ii) introducing procedures to \nbetter  target  the  poor  and  marginalized  groups;  and  (iii)  empowering  local  government, \ncommunities, and service providers to deliver quality services.  \n                                                 \n8  In terms of purchasing power parity. \n9  Infrastructure investments fell from more than 6% of GDP before the 1997\u20131998 Asian crisis to a low of 2% in \n2000, before stabilizing at 3% in recent years.  \n10  The average size of the block grants for the 2,000 poorest subdistricts increased from Rp1.8 billion in 2008 to \nRp2.6 billion in 2009.  ", "7 \nIII.  GOVERNMENT STRATEGY, PROGRAM EVOLUTION AND RESULTS \n29.  The Government\u2019s national medium-term development plan (RPJM) aims to achieve \npeace and security, justice and democracy while advancing the welfare of the people within the \ntime frame of 2004\u20132009. The RPJM is focused on achieving the Millennium Development \nGoals. It places human development and poverty reduction at the center of the development \nagenda.  \n \n30.  To help implement the RPJM priorities, several economic policy packages have been \nintroduced since 2006 that specify measures to be achieved within a defined period. In 2006, \nthe  Government  issued  three  economic  policy  packages  covering  investment  climate, \ninfrastructure, and financial sector reform. In 2007, a comprehensive follow-up package was \nissued detailing measures to accelerate development and empower micro-, small, and medium \nenterprises (MSMEs). The latest package, introduced in May 2008, builds on the previous \npackages and details reforms in the following eight areas: (i) investment climate; (ii) financial \nsector; (iii) energy security; (iv) natural resources, environment, and agriculture; (v) small and \nmedium enterprises (SMEs); (vi) implementation of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN)  commitments;  (vii)  infrastructure;  and  (viii)  labor  policy.  Through  these  policy \npackages, the Government has demonstrated its firm intent to address several complex and \npolitically sensitive issues.  \n \nA.  The Development Policy Support Program and Government Strategy \n31.  DPSP supports the Development Policy Loan (DPL) series prepared by a joint team of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Government of Indonesia, the Government of Japan, \nand the World Bank.11 The DPL series aims to help the Government achieve its medium-term \ngrowth  and  poverty  reduction  objectives  through  three  core  policy  areas:  (i)  improved \ninvestment  climate,  (ii)  improved  public  financial  management  and  governance,  and  (iii) \nenhanced poverty alleviation and improved delivery of public services to the poor. Building on \nthe support provided by DPSP-4 (approved in December 2008), the proposed DPSP-5 will \nprovide parallel cofinancing support to the Government to help implement reforms under the \nsixth Development Policy Loan (DPL-6), the sixth in a series of annual, single-tranche loans.  \n \n32.  The DPSP series has allowed the Government to work with development partners in a \nflexible manner to implement critical high-level macroeconomic and crosscutting sector reforms \nthat  address  constraints  to  growth  and  poverty  reduction  while  providing  predictability  of \nfinancial support. As such, its coverage is broad. Governance is a recurring theme throughout \nthe DPSP series, as it aims to promote transparency in all of its core policy areas. The proposed \nDPSP-5 is anchored in the ADB Country Strategy and Program (CSP) for Indonesia,12 which in \nturn  provides  for  deeper  sector  interventions  to  complement  the  macroeconomic  and \ngovernance  reforms  supported  through  the  DPSP  series.  DPSP-5  builds  on  past  DPSP \noperations to support the Government further on key reform measures in the core areas of \ninvestment climate, public financial management and governance, and poverty alleviation and \nservice delivery to the poor.  \n                                                 \n11 ADB did not provide financial support to the first DPL (DPL-1), which began in 2004, and a different title\u2014DPSP\u2014\nhas been adopted for ADB operations. The correspondence between DPL and DPSP is as follows: DPL-1 = ADB's \nparticipation through policy dialogue; DPL-2 = DPSP-1; DPL-3 = DPSP-2; DPL-4 = DPSP-3; DPL-5 = DPSP-4; \nDPL-6 = DPSP-5.  \n12 ADB. 2006.

The economic environment since the second half of 2008 has been marked by intense \neconomic uncertainty arising from the global economic crisis. Still, as a sign of its commitment, \nthe  Government  is  pursuing  its  medium-term  agenda  on  broad  structural  and  institutional \nreforms, while implementing measures to mitigate the effects of the global crisis. \n \n34.  In response to the global crisis, ADB, as well as other development partners, have \nassisted the Government on two fronts. First, ADB and other development partners provided \ncontingent financing and support for fiscal stimulus to shore up market confidence and cushion \nthe impact of the global crisis on economic growth. Second, they continued to support the \nGovernment\u2019s  medium-term  reform  agenda  through  the  DPL/DPSP  process  and  sector \nprograms.  \n \n35.  In  June  2009,  ADB  assisted  the  Government  with  the  Public  Expenditure  Support \nFacility (PESF) Program,13 which is part of a joint effort with the Government of Australia, the \nGovernment of Japan, and the World Bank to provide contingent budget financing in the event \nof further instability in credit markets that may result in a shortfall in budget financing. The PESF \nProgram included a series of confidence-boosting policy measures aimed at sending a strong \npositive signal to the markets, making it more likely that Indonesia would meet its commercial \nmarket borrowing targets for 2009. These policy measures comprised actions to (i) reassure \nfinancial markets and maintain financial system stability, (ii) sustain critical public expenditures \nwhile maintaining budget discipline to mitigate the poverty impacts of the growth slowdown, and \n(iii) draw in private investment and support exports.  \n \n36.  ADB  is  also  providing  support  to  the  Government  for  its  countercyclical  spending \nprogram  for  2009  through  the  countercyclical  support  facility.  The  facility  will  help  ensure \npredictability  in  the  Government\u2019s  budget  financing  given  the  need  for  a  temporary  fiscal \nexpansion. It will allow the Government to stimulate economic recovery in 2009 and 2010, \nprotect its social spending and poverty alleviation programs, and continue with its longer-term \ndevelopment objectives. Both the PESF and the countercyclical support thus complement the \nDPL/DPSP series, which focuses on medium-term reforms.  \n \n37.  As noted above, support for the RPJM through the DPSP series is a key pillar of ADB\u2019s \nCSP for 2006\u20132009. Under the CSP, a dual-track approach is adopted to ensure that the high-\nlevel macroeconomic and governance reforms supported through the policy dialogue of the \nDPL/DPSP series complement, and are reinforced by, ADB\u2019s sector programs. Underpinning \nthe policy dialogue has been a series of advisory technical assistance (TA) projects provided by \nthe World Bank and ADB.  \n \n38.  Figure  1  presents  the  approach,  which  involves  structuring  ADB\u2019s  support  through \n(i) participation  in  the  DPLs  to  strengthen  the  macroeconomic  and  fiscal  framework  while \naddressing crosscutting concerns; and (ii) sector-specific policy interventions in the areas of \ninfrastructure, financial sector, local government finance, and poverty reduction.  \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2009.

ADB\u2019s  approach  aims  to  harmonize  and  align  development  partner  strategies  with \nIndonesia\u2019s country strategy and priorities. The participation of (i) ADB and the Government of \nJapan in the World Bank-coordinated DPL series; (ii) the Government of Japan and the World \nBank  in  ADB\u2019s  Infrastructure  Reform  Sector  Development  Program;  and  (iii)  ADB,  the \nGovernment of Australia, the Government of Japan, and the World Bank in the PESF have \nhelped reduce the Government\u2019s transaction costs of policy dialogue with some of the country\u2019s \nmost important development partners.  \n \n40.  Moreover, development partner harmonization around the Government\u2019s own programs \nhas bolstered country ownership of the reform process and helped nurture its relationship with \ndevelopment partners. ADB\u2019s active participation in the policy discussions in all areas of the \nDPL  and  the  parallel  policy  dialogue  on  PESF  and  sector  reforms  have  been  particularly \nappreciated by the Government, as these have helped in setting the overall macroeconomic \nframework for sector reforms, including those supported by ADB. ADB\u2019s engagement in these \npolicy  discussions  and  its  strength  in  the  areas  of  infrastructure,  financial  sector,  and \ndecentralization have helped avoid duplication of effort and improved the monitoring as well as \nthe quality of the DPL/DPSP triggers. \nC.  The Evolution of the Program \n41.  The focus of the DPL/DPSP series has evolved over the years, reflecting changes in the \ncountry's needs and priorities (Appendix 2). At its inception with DPL-1, the emphasis was on \nensuring medium-term macroeconomic stability and building the basic legal and regulatory \nframework for investment as well as public financial management and governance. At that time, \nthe economy was emerging from the 1997\u20131998 Asian crisis, the country was graduating from \nthe  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  program,  and  fundamental  political  changes  were \nculminating in the first direct presidential elections. The DPL was expected to provide the \nfoundation  for  continued  medium-term  policy  engagement  in  the  areas  of  macroeconomic \nstability, the investment climate, and public financial management and anticorruption. It also \nprovided for a flexible means of taking into account the pace and fluidity of the reform process. \nAs the program evolved, the scope of the Government-led reform agenda has been broadened. \nIt has also deepened, whereby successive DPL operations have built on previous ones to \nensure steady progress in implementation.  \n \n42.  Within  this  context,  the  main  focus  of  DPL-1  was  on  macroeconomic  stability  and \ncreditworthiness,  investment  climate,  and  public  financial  management  and  governance. \nReflecting the Government\u2019s success in achieving macroeconomic stability and attaining the \nmacroeconomic triggers of the DPL program ahead of time, the Government and development \npartners  agreed  in  early  2006  to  remove  the  macroeconomic  pillar  in  the  proposed  DPL-\n4/DPSP-3, but to continue the policy dialogue on macroeconomic stability. At the same time, the \nincreased fiscal space generated by (i) the reduction in fuel subsidies in 2005, (ii) declining debt \nservice payments, and (iii) increasing revenues opened up opportunities for a greater focus on \npublic service delivery as a new policy area. The DPL/DPSP operations currently focus on three \ncore policy areas: the investment climate, public financial management and governance, and \npoverty alleviation and public service delivery.  ", "11 \nD.  Results Achieved14 \n43.  Policy  actions  under  the  macroeconomic  pillar  relating  to  debt  and  fiscal  policy \nmanagement  contributed  considerably  to  lower  levels  of  debt  relative  to  GDP  and  a \nconsiderable increase in non-oil tax revenues. Rating agencies have also cited debt reduction \nand  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  reforms,  including  changes  to  the  Investment  Law, \ncustoms and tax reforms, and fiscal reforms\u2014all activities supported by the DPL/DPSP\u2014as the \nreason for recent sovereign rating upgrades. Policy actions supported under the investment \nclimate have led to significant improvements in business start-up times and VAT refund times, \nand  have  led  to  the  establishment  of  a  sounder,  more  sustainable  financial  safety  net. \nDPL/DPSP policy measures have also supported revisions to the Tax Administration Law, 2007, \nthe implementing decree relating to tax audit procedures, implementation decrees supporting \nthe Investment Law, and the gradual rollout of a national single window (NSW) with online \nclearance of merchandise.  \n \n44.  A  key  achievement  under  the  public  financial  management  pillar  has  been  the \nimplementation of the TSA to improve cash management of public finances. The DPL/DPSP \nprogram has helped move forward reforms to reengineer business processes across the budget \ncycle. The national budget is now compatible with the international standard GFS classification. \nFiscal reporting is more comprehensive and timely, and a medium-term fiscal framework is \ngradually being introduced. Initial steps to address civil service reform were taken under the \nDPL/DPSP series, resulting in an overhaul of the structure and remuneration framework for \nhigh-ranking  state  officials.  A  task  force  was  set  up  to  examine  the  entire  compensation \npackage with the goal of creating a more transparent, systematic, and coherent framework for \npay and allowances based on a comprehensive job evaluation and pay grading. Building on \nthis, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) has developed a comprehensive civil service reform action \nplan, which is being pilot-tested in other agencies.  \n \n45.  Important  steps  were  also  established  under  the  DPL/DPSP  series  to  help  lay  the \ngroundwork for improving poverty targeting of basic services. As the 2005 fuel price hike made \nmore resources available for social spending, the DPL/DPSP supported building capacity in \ngovernment institutions to strengthen the evaluation function in order to improve the targeting of \nthese released funds. Lessons from targeting were then incorporated into the new cash transfer \nprogram that accompanied the May 2008 fuel price increase. DPSP/DPL has also supported \ncritical actions to improve the quality of public service delivery in education and community-\nbased development. \nE.  Lessons \n46.  Development  coordination.  The  DPL/DPSP  facility  provided  a  useful  platform  for \ncoordination of development partners' policies and programs. The Government welcomed the \ndevelopment  of  a  consistent  approach  among  key  development  partners  to  critical  reform \nissues. Sharing of technical advisory support, information, and data also had implications for \ncooperation  in  other  operational  areas,  most  notably  in  programs  to  support  infrastructure \ndevelopment, where ADB took the lead role (Appendix 6). \n \n47.  Coordination within Government. The negotiations to develop the DPL/DPSP and the \nneed  to  develop  joint  positions  on  policy  issues  necessitated  regular  and  continuous \n                                                 \n14  This section, and the subsequent section on lessons, is based on the findings of program completion reports \nundertaken for DPSP-1 in 2008, and for DPSPs 2\u20133 in 2009 (Appendix 3 provides more details on results). \n ", "12  \ninteragency consultation and coordination that may have contributed to improvements in the \npolicy coordination process within and across key agencies of the Government.  \n \n48.  Design and specification of specific triggers. Policy triggers were defined on the \nbasis of mutual trust and understanding between the Government and the three development \npartners, with a clear understanding of the direction of reforms, without excessive specificity that \nwould create political difficulties or compromise the flexibility of the Government in overcoming \nobstacles to reform.15 This was especially important in areas where the Executing Agency, the \nCoordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs (CMEA), or the agencies working most closely with \nit\u2014MOF and the National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS)\u2014had no direct control \nover implementation of a particular reform, as other agencies or Parliament were involved. \n \n49.  Role of policy triggers. The triggers comprise part of the Government-owned and led \nreform program. The choice of triggers was important in guiding both the direction and pace of \nthe  reform  process.  The  inclusion of  a  trigger  in  the  DPL/DPSP  was  welcomed  by  those \nadvancing particular reforms within the Government, as this would increase the profile of the \nreform and could help ensure maintenance of the momentum needed to achieve the reform.  \n \n50.  Importance of continuity in the reform process, building on earlier changes. Some \nreforms led to solid progress on a reform objective, and the DPL/DPSP played a clear role in \ntheir achievement. In PFM, for example, the DPL/DPSP support for the TSA led to a significant \nimprovement in cash management, setting the stage for better cash planning. These reforms \nare also more sustainable, as the reforms were institutionalized as they progressed, and as the \nparties involved remained engaged in the reform process. \n \n51.  Strengthening change management capacity in the Government. The success of \nthe DPL/DPSP programs has hinged on the proactive role taken by key counterparts willing to \ntake up difficult change management functions. This has necessitated a strong communications \nstrategy with all concerned stakeholders. Assessing the potential gains and losses for key \nstakeholders, realistically assessing the time frames required to implement specific actions, and \nidentifying potential obstacles, risks, and remedial actions to be taken have all been vital to the \nprocess. It was widely recognized in the DPL/DPSP process that supporting the agencies \nleading the reform process through advisory services or technical support would yield greater \nbenefits in terms of the design and facilitation of future reforms. DPL/DPSP reforms have \ntended to be most successful in areas where they were complemented by a strong TA program. \n \n                                                 \n15 In keeping with the programmatic DPL modality, which has been characterized by medium-term engagement, \nstrong country ownership, and continuous policy dialogue with the Government, triggers are used in a more \nprocess-oriented and flexible sense with less of a focus on compliance with conditions. International experience \nwith policy-based lending and recent literature on the subject suggests that a focus on traditional conditionality \ncould undermine country ownership and the sustainability of the reform process (World Bank. 2005. Conditionality \nRevisited. Washington, DC; ADB. 2007. Special Evaluation Study on Policy-Based Lending: Emerging Practices in \nSupporting Reforms in Developing Member Countries. Manila). ", "13 \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n52.  The DPSP-5 will contribute to higher pro-poor economic growth that is sustained over \nthe medium term. The expected outcome of the Program will be improved overall economic \nmanagement anchored on good governance. The Program's outputs, which will underpin the \noutcome, are (i) improved investment climate, (ii) improved public financial management and \ngovernance, and (iii) enhanced poverty alleviation and public service delivery to the poor.  \n \n53.  The development policy letter is provided in Appendix 4, and the policy matrix for the \nDPSP-5 is in Appendix 5. \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n54.  DPSP-5  is  substantively  a  continuation  of  DPSPs  1\u20134,  the  programmatic  series  of \nannual single-tranche operations from 2005 to 2008. It continues the policy dialogue on, and \nsupport to, the Government's reform program in the three core areas that were the focus of \nDPSP-4: (i) the investment climate, (ii) public financial management and governance, and \n(iii) enhanced poverty alleviation and public service delivery to the poor. Improvements in the \ninvestment climate are critical to accelerating growth. Enhanced public financial management \nand governance are essential for increasing the effectiveness of the Government's policies and \nprograms. Improving service delivery to the poor and poverty alleviation efforts are important if \nIndonesia is to bring about more broad-based improvements in welfare for its population.  \n \n55.  The  triggers  in  these  three  areas  were  chosen  as  part  of  the  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment during preparation of DPSP-4, and represent a natural progression from those that \nwere achieved in that program. The DPSP-4 program document laid out 12 indicative policy \ntriggers  across  eight  policy  areas  for  DPSP-5.  Subsequently,  the  Government  and  its \ndevelopment partners agreed to merge the trigger on \"drafting key performance indicators for all \nbudgeted programs\" with another on developing a revised program structure for RPJM 2010\u2013\n2014, since the former was an integral part of the latter. Furthermore, the trigger on updating the \nregulation on investment negative list (para. 59) was revised in early 2009 to take into account \nthe drafting of the revised regulation that was included as part of the policy action for the PESF. \nAll of the triggers under the proposed program registered satisfactory progress (Table 2).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "14  \n \nTable 2: Status of Triggers for the Fifth Development Policy Support Program \n \nPolicy Triggers  Status \nCore Policy Area I: Improving the Investment Climate   \nRegulatory Environment for Investment   \n(i)  Complete interministerial review and convene a ministerial plenary session to review and  Achieved \nendorse the draft of a new regulation on the investment negative list that updates sector and \ninvestment restrictions, and clarifies the status of publicly listed companies, foreign equity limits \nfor direct investment, and grandfathering. \n(ii)  Issue implementing regulations for the 2007 Investment Law on one-stop shops (PTSPs),  Achieved \nsimplifying the steps required to set up a domestic or foreign company and the role of the \ncentral Government relative to provincial and local governments in approving or licensing \ndomestic or foreign direct investment. \nTrade Facilitation   \n(iii)   Finalize a draft proposal for the operational model and governance structure of the Indonesia  Satisfactory \nNSW. \nTax Reform   \n(iv)  Issue Directorate General (Tax) decree allowing recognition of digital signatures for individual  Achieved \ntaxpayer registration and for filing personal income tax returns. \n(v)  Issue Directorate General (Tax) decree implementing new simplified standard formats capturing  Achieved \nkey financial indicators and annual tax returns from all types of businesses, and eliminating the \nneed for taxpayers to submit separate financial statements. \nFinancial Sector   \n(vi)  Issue Ministry of Finance regulation on credit guarantee and re-guarantee companies.

", "15 \n1.  Core Policy Area I: Improved Investment Climate \n56.  The DPSP-5 aims to improve the investment climate further by focusing on reforms to: \nclarify regulations for investors, reduce the cost of complying with the regulations by making the \nprocess of compliance more efficient, improve tax administration, and increase SMEs' access to \nfinance.  \n \na.  Trigger 1: Complete interministerial review and convene a ministerial \nplenary session to review and endorse the draft of a new regulation on \nthe investment negative list that updates sector and investment \nrestrictions, and clarifies the status of publicly listed companies, foreign \nequity limits for direct investment, and grandfathering. (current status: \nachieved) \n \n57.  Before the 2007 Investment Law was passed, the investment negative list (DNI) allowed \nsubstantial scope for ministries and agencies to impose ad hoc restrictions. These restrictions \nwere poorly documented; lacked a clear, legal basis; could be applied on a case-by-case basis; \nand often contradictory. The 2007 law required the issuance of a presidential regulation on a \nnew DNI. This new list was more detailed and comprehensive and hence more transparent. But \nit  also  entailed  restrictions  on  ownership  of  companies  in  key  sectors  such  as \ntelecommunications,  health,  shipping,  ports,  logistics,  pharmaceuticals,  and  insurance. \nMoreover, it raised new issues with regard to the treatment of publicly listed companies, the \ncreation of restrictions outside the DNI, international commitments, and a grandfathering clause \nfor existing investors. In response to concerns raised by the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce, \nthe  Government  committed  in  2008  to  further  simplify  the  list  and  address  specific \nshortcomings. \n \n58.  The original trigger for DPSP-5 called for monitoring and assessing the DNI and issuing \nsupporting regulations. It did not call for a revision of the presidential regulation on the DNI. As a \nprior action for the PESF, the Government drafted a new revised presidential regulation in \nFebruary 2009 and discussed it with stakeholders, including the business community. The \nGovernment  subsequently  initiated  an  interministerial  review  of  the  draft.  Considering  the \nprogress made under the PESF, the Government and the development partners agreed to \nreplace the original trigger for DPL-6/DPSP-5 with a policy action calling for completion of the \ninterministerial review and the endorsement of the draft by the ministerial plenary session.  \n \n59.  The draft was endorsed by a plenary meeting of 20 ministers in July 2009. According to \nthe draft, some 70 business activities will become less restrictive compared with the 2007 \nregulation, while eight activities will become more restrictive. Investment regulations on 59 \nactivities  will  be  clarified.  Ownership  limits  on  about  40  types  of  construction  works  were \nincreased from 55% to 67%, and construction consultancy services were moved from the list \nreserved for micro-, small, and medium-sized enterprises to the list with an ownership limit of \n55%. Equity limits on a number of tourism activities were increased from 50% to 51%. Among \nthe  activities  that  were  made  more  restrictive,  five  types  of  security  services,  which  were \npreviously excluded from the DNI, were included in the draft revised regulation with a 49% \nownership limit and a requirement to obtain a license from the national police; two were in \nagriculture and one was in tourism.  \n \n60.  The draft regulation clarifies that (i) provisions on the DNI will not apply to investments \nmade before the issuance of the revised regulation; these investments will be governed by their \noriginal letter of approval, and (ii) publicly listed companies are excluded from the DNI. The \n ", "16  \nrevised regulation also incorporates international commitments under the ASEAN Framework \nAgreement on Services for the first time in an investment negative list in Indonesia. The draft \nregulation is now being reviewed by the President\u2019s office. The Government views the DNI as a \ndynamic list from a medium-term perspective, with the intent of making it less restrictive and \nsimpler as it is revised. \n \nb.  Trigger 2: Issue implementing regulations for the 2007 Investment Law \non one-stop shops (PTSPs), simplifying the steps required to set up a \ndomestic or foreign company and the role of the central Government \nrelative to provincial and local governments in approving or licensing \ndomestic or foreign direct investment. (current status: achieved) \n \n61.  The 2007 Investment Law stipulates issuance of a presidential regulation on one-door \nintegrated  investment  service,  or  one-stop  shops  (PTSPs).  The  presidential  regulation  on \nPTSPs  was  issued  on  23  June  2009.  The  new  regulation  allows  ministries  and  central \nGovernment agencies to turn over or delegate their authority to issue business licenses to the \nNational Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM). It authorizes BKPM to establish a one-stop \nshop for investment licensing as well as an electronic information and licensing service. At the \nlocal government level, the regulation requires that business licensing authority be transferred to \nlocal one-stop shops, and it empowers BKPM to monitor the implementation and performance \nof the local one-stop shops.  \n \n62.  Since  the  technical  skills  to  assess  license  applications  lie  with  the  ministries  and \nagencies that regulate each sector, the challenge will be to reach agreement on which licenses \ncan be transferred to BKPM\u2019s new one-stop shop without compromising the quality of the \nlicensing process. Following the issuance of this PTSP regulation, detailed technical regulations \nfor  investment  within  each  sector  will  be  required.  An  online  investment  licensing  system \ntechnical team has been established and a work plan agreed upon. The online system, to be \nmade accessible to the public within 3 years, will connect (i) licenses already delegated to \nBKPM  and  further  delegated  to  subnational  governments;  (ii)  licenses  by  subnational \ngovernments; and (iii) licenses under the authority of line ministries. A prerequisite for the \nsmooth functioning of the new system will be the mapping and subsequent simplification of \nexisting business licensing systems and a reduction in the number of licenses required. Going \nforward, the DPL series will continue to support implementation of the PTSPs. \n \nc.  Trigger 3: Finalize a draft proposal for the operational model and \ngovernance structure of the Indonesia NSW. (current status: satisfactory) \n \n63.  The  NSW  for  imports  and  exports  is  the  most  important  trade  facilitation  initiative \nunderway in Indonesia. Under a fully operational single window system, traders (importers and \nexporters) will no longer be required to apply individually to multiple government agencies\u2014\nsuch as customs, the port authority, the Ministry of Trade, the Food and Drug Agency, and \nquarantine\u2014to  clear  cargoes.  A  single  application  is  instead  submitted  using  a  single \nadministrative document and this application is then transmitted to each relevant agency by the \noperator of the single window. Approval is transmitted back to the operator so that the trader \ncommunicates directly with one authority rather than multiple authorities. The Indonesia NSW is \nbeing established in the framework of several ASEAN agreements as an initial step toward an \neventual ASEAN single window for international trade. \n \n64.  Eight  government  agencies  are  currently  implementing  steps  toward  the  Indonesia \nNSW, with customs as the lead agency, until the operational model and governance structure ", "17 \nfor the NSW is established and the operator is selected. The agencies have begun to revamp \ntheir business processes to work toward a single submission and single approval of applications \nby traders.  In December 2008 these processes became mandatory for imports in Tanjung Priok \nand Semarang. During July 2009 they became mandatory for imports in Surabaya and a pilot \nhas been launched for exports in the same port.  \n \n65.  The decision on the operational model and the governance structure for the Indonesia \nNSW  was  originally  scheduled  for  December  2008.  However,  the  requisite  donor-funded \ntechnical assistance came in place only in February 2009, and the need to refine further the \noperational model recommended by experts under the TA has meant that the process has been \ndelayed by about 1 year.  \n \n66.  A draft proposal for the operational model was submitted to the coordinating minister for \neconomic  affairs  in  August  2009.  This  included  a  detailed  institutional  structure  for  an \nindependent entity to oversee the NSW, comprising a governing council with representatives \nfrom 15 ministries and agencies; a chief executive officer; a Secretariat; and one division for \npolicy and one for technical and operational matters. The latter division will select the NSW \noperator.  There  are  also  three  units  under  each  participating  ministry  for  policy,  customer \ninterface, and for technical and operational matters, which, among other tasks, will develop the \nelectronic platform linking the agency with the NSW. A final decision on the operational model \nand governance structure is expected to be made in early 2010. Selection of the operator is \nsupported by the next DPL. \n \nd.  Trigger 4: Issue Directorate-General (Tax) decree allowing recognition of \ndigital signatures for individual taxpayer registration and for filing personal \nincome tax returns. (current status: achieved) \n \n67.  In an effort to strike an appropriate balance between taxpayer service and enforcement, \nthe  Directorate  General  (Tax)  has  embarked  on  a  major  reform  process  to  modernize  its \norganizational structure and to introduce a modern compliance management approach. It has \nsuccessfully  restructured  its  headquarters  by  moving  from  a  \u201ctax  type\u201d  to  one  classified \naccording to functions (registration, returns processing, etc.). It is establishing a field office \nnetwork targeted to specific taxpayer segments (large, medium, and small taxpayer offices). It \nhas  also  introduced  a  taxpayer-centered  approach  to  improve  voluntary  compliance. \nAccomplishments include increasing taxpayer registration, increasing tax return filings by new \nand existing taxpayers, the recovery of tax arrears, and the introduction of e-registration and \ne-filing. The number of registered taxpayers, comprising mainly individuals, increased from 4.4 \nmillion in 2005 to 7.1 million in 2007 and an estimated 15.1 million in 2009. \n \n68.  The issuance in December 2008 of the decree allowing recognition of digital signatures \nfor individual taxpayer registration and for filing personal income tax returns has permitted the \nrollout of e-registration and e-filing for taxpayers. Subsequently, the Directorate General (Tax) \nissued a new regulation (no. 24/PJ/2009) to enable electronic tax registration. The regulation \nspecifies the procedures for electronic registration with a taxpayer identification number and/or \nVAT collector number. Replacing paper filing with electronic filing will reduce taxpayer burden \nand filing costs.  \n \ne.  Trigger 5: Issue Directorate General (Tax) decree implementing new \nsimplified standard formats capturing key financial indicators and annual \ntax returns from all types of businesses, and eliminating the need for \n ", "18  \ntaxpayers to submit separate financial statements (current status: \nachieved) \n \n69.  The Directorate General (Tax) decree to implement new simplified standard formats \ncapturing key financial indicators and annual tax returns, from all types of businesses, was \nissued in July 2009. It will do away with the need to physically deliver financial statements to tax \noffices, enabling completely online submission of tax documents.  \n \n70.  Over the next year, the Directorate General (Tax) aims to continue to reduce taxpayer \nburden by calibrating the schedule for filing of tax and VAT returns by specific companies \naccording to their sector characteristics. It also expects to initiate a major reform of core tax \nsystems, which will entail (i) improving taxpayer registration, (ii) automated processing of tax \nreturns, (iii) improved accounts processing, (iv) a centralized document management system, \nand  (v)  enhanced  information  and  communication  technology  infrastructure  to  integrate  all \nautomated systems with increased security and backup facilities.  \n \nf.  Trigger 6: Issue Ministry of Finance regulation on credit guarantee and \nre-guarantee companies. (current status: achieved) \n \n71.   Access to credit is still widely regarded as a major constraint to the growth of MSMEs in \nIndonesia. Numerous line ministries and state-owned enterprises have tried to run several \nschemes for MSMEs with limited success. MSMEs with viable business models do not have \naccess to bank credit for several reasons, including lack of collateral and limited understanding \nby the banks about the enterprises' business risks. In 2007, the Government moved toward \nrationalizing all SME financing programs of line ministries into a unified guarantee facility\u2014the \nKredit Usaha Rakyat (People\u2019s Entrepreneurship Credit Program). Under the Kredit Usaha \nRakyat, the banks assume 30% of the credit risk and the credit guarantee facility assumes the \nremaining 70%. In addition, following the issuance in January 2008 of Government regulation \n(PP) no.2/2008, which allows for the establishment of national and provincial credit guarantee \nand  re-guarantee  companies,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  issued  an  implementing  regulation \n(222/2008) in December 2008 that clarifies, among other things, the legal status of these \ncompanies, their ownership structure, reporting mechanisms, and investment options. Under the \nnew regulation, both private and state-owned credit guarantee and re-guarantee companies can \nbe established at the national and provincial level.  \n2.  Core Policy Area II: Improved Public Financial Management and \nGovernance \n72..  The  DPL-6/DPSP-5  supports  four  policy  actions  to  further  improve  PFM  and \ngovernance. It bolsters the Government's efforts to orient the budget process toward results in \npriority  policy  areas.  The  DPL-6/DPSP-5  also  supports  reforms  to  ensure  more  effective \nmanagement of public funds through (i) continued implementation of a TSA by automating the \ntreasury payments system in relation to revenue accounts; (ii) implementation of a new state \nbudget  and  treasury  system  (SPAN);  and  (iii)  more  streamlined  procurement  bidding \ndocuments.  \n \na.  Trigger 7: Develop a revised program structure for RPJM 2010\u20132014 \nwith measurable results and targets, draft corresponding key performance \nindicators for all budget holders, and finalize requisite guidelines and \nformats. (current status: achieved) \n ", "19 \n73.  To improve the results orientation of the budget process, BAPPENAS and MOF have \ncommitted to developing a revised program structure that will be used in the medium-term plan \n(RPJM 2010-2014) to be implemented by the new Government and to be issued in 2010. On \n19 June 2009, a joint circular was signed by both the finance and planning ministers stating that \na  revised  results-based  program  structure  is  to  be  implemented  by  the  76  ministries  and \nministry-level agencies in the process of developing the 2010\u20132014 RPJM and the Ministry and \nAgency Medium-Term Strategic Plan (Renstra-KL). This is a critical first step in achieving the \ngoal of a results-based budget. The programs and activities in the revised structure would have \nmeasurable  results  and  targets,  and  the  activities  related  to  policy  priorities  should  be \nidentifiable. \n \n74.  BAPPENAS  and  MOF  launched  on  14  July  2009  a  manual  on  performance-based \nbudgeting (PBB) within the MTEF that provides guidance to line ministries for the preparation of \nthe revised program structure of their medium-term plans. Dissemination of the PBB/MTEF joint \nmanual  and  consultations  on  the  new  program  structures  and  activities  are  ongoing.  The \nPBB/MTEF joint manual also includes detailed guidance on how to develop key performance \nindicators  for  budgeted  programs  with  appropriate  targets  over  a  given  time  period.  Key \nperformance indicators would help monitor the outputs and outcomes of public expenditures \nand programs, and track their progress. It is expected that the final versions of the new program \nstructures, activities, and key performance indicators for all 76 budget holders will be completed \nby December 2009.  \n \nb.  Trigger 8: Implement daily sweep of revenue accounts into the TSA for \nall commercial banks. (current status: achieved) \n \n75.  Under its treasury management program, the Government has continued to expand \nimplementation of the TSA to consolidate all government bank accounts. Regulations issued in \n2007 authorized MOF to bring all government bank accounts under the TSA. Since 2007, the \nTSA for expenditure management has been made operational in all MOF Treasury offices. \nHowever,  an  annual  census  of  the  government  bank  accounts  revealed  that  a  significant \nnumber of accounts are still outside the coverage of the TSA. The TSA has now been extended \nto cover most of the imprest bank accounts currently owned by budgetary institutions for petty \ncash and salary payments. \n76.  The consolidation of the TSA has advanced significantly since 2008. MOF and Bank \nIndonesia have signed a memorandum of understanding providing for the payment of interest \non Government cash balances being held in the TSA with Bank Indonesia. The next-day daily \nsweep  of  the  Government's  revenue  accounts  in  all  commercial  banks  into  the  TSA  was \ncompleted this year. The MOF decree No. 116/2009, issued in June 2009, states that by \nJanuary 2010 all revenue accounts maintained in collecting bank branches will be swept to the \nTSA by the end of the same day. The staged implementation of the same-day daily sweep of \nrevenue accounts into the TSA started on 1 July 2009 in the western region. This reform, \ncoupled with the agreement between MOF and Bank Indonesia on payment of interest on \nGovernment cash balances held in the TSA, should enable the Treasury to optimize on cash \nbalances, including the investment of surplus cash. \n \n77.  The consolidation of funds into TSA also helps in cash forecasting and thus in relieving \nthe year-end bunching of expenditures. The next DPL program will support the issuance of a \nnew  MOF  regulation  on  cash  forecasting,  which  will  also  set  the  stage  for  subsequently \nimproving cash forecasting at the provincial treasury offices (KPPNs) and budget forecasting \ncapabilities in some 22,000 satkers (spending units). \n ", "20  \nc.  Trigger 9: Sign contract for procurement of the new budget and treasury \nsystem (SPAN). (current status: achieved) \n \n78.  MOF is in the process of implementing an integrated financial management system to \nstreamline the multitude of financial data processing applications currently used by government \ninstitutions and to enhance budget execution. The contract for SPAN was signed on 10 July \n2009. It is projected to become operational in selected pilot offices of the treasury beginning in \n2011 and then rolled out to all KPPNs and pilot line ministries in 2012. It is also expected that \nthe Directorate General for Treasury will have identified and completed improvements in the \nbusiness processes of participating institutions in 2010, and that a final version of the chart of \naccounts will be available and integrated into the SPAN.  \n \n79.  SPAN  will  provide  the  backbone  for  modernized  treasury  operations  with  modules \nrelated to all aspects of the budget execution process. A number of deficiencies that currently \nexist in the budget execution process\u2014fragmented data, inaccurate and delayed reporting of \nboth revenue and expenditure transactions, and lack of information on program execution\u2014will \nbe mitigated with the automation of business processes. The establishment of an integrated \nfinancial database will provide the ability to capture transactions at every stage of the budget \nexecution process.  \n \nd.  Trigger 10: Prepare a draft revised Presidential Decree No. 80/2003 to \naccommodate a new set of national standard bidding documents for use \nby all government agencies. (current status: satisfactory) \n \n80.  Progress on streamlining the regulatory framework for public procurement is underway, \nthough not at the pace anticipated. LKPP (National Public Procurement Agency) is currently \nworking  on  two  tracks\u2014the  preparation  of  a  new  procurement  law  and  revision  of  the \nPresidential Decree 80/2003. It has initiated background studies for a draft procurement law and \nexpects to have the studies as well as a first draft of the legal text of the new procurement law \nprepared by September 2010. However, the enactment of a new procurement law could be a \nlengthy  process,  as  it  will  require  significant  consultation  and  consensus  building  with \nstakeholders, and will possibly face opposition from interest groups. In the interim, LKPP is \nworking to revise Presidential Decree 80/2003 with the intention of mandating a set of standard \nbidding documents to be used by all agencies.16 Presidential Decree 80/2003 promotes the \nbasic  principles  of  procurement:  transparency,  open  and  fair  competition,  economy,  and \nefficiency. It covers all areas of procurement that use public funds and contracting entities at all \nlevels of Government. \n \n81.  LKPP  has  recently  prepared  a  draft  of  the  revised  Presidential  Decree  80/2003, \nmandating a set of standard bidding documents to be used by all agencies. However, before \nsubmitting the draft for interdepartmental review LKPP has requested that ADB, the World \nBank,  and  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID)  review  the  revised \npresidential decree to identify gaps with each institution's procurement guidelines. The revised \npresidential decree is expected to be submitted to the new administration in November 2009, \nwith final issuance scheduled for January 2010. Harmonizing Presidential Decree 80/2003 and \nthe standard bidding documents with international best practice would improve procurement in \n                                                 \n16 The standard bidding documents were drafted with support from ADB.

Progress is also being made in other aspects of procurement. LKPP recently issued a \ndecree  for all  districts to  set  up  procurement  service  units  to  assist  local  governments  to \nimplement  the  presidential  decree,  including  the  use  of  e-procurement.  ADB  provided  TA \nsupport to help LKPP develop e-procurement systems countrywide. ADB is also providing \nassistance to assess the public procurement system in selected sectors.  \n3.  Core Policy Area III: Improved Delivery of Public Services \n83.  Beyond allocating more resources to poverty alleviation programs, several initiatives are \nbeing pursued to enhance the effectiveness of these programs. These include improvements in \nthe  targeting  of  poverty  alleviation  programs  to  ensure  that  they  reach  the  appropriate \nbeneficiaries. DPSP-5 will support the Government\u2019s reform objectives in terms of enhancing \nthe pro-poor impact of public expenditures by increasing funding for poverty programs. \n \na.  Trigger 11: Continue to use poverty targeting in determining the size of \nthe subdistrict community block grants under PNPM and increase the \naverage size of the block grant for the poorest subdistricts. (current \nstatus: achieved) \n \n84.  The  National  Community  Empowerment  Program  (PNPM  Mandiri)\u2014a  program  of \ncommunity block grants that is the Government\u2019s flagship anti-poverty program\u2014is being scaled \nup in terms of geographical coverage.17 The size of the average block grant is being increased \nat the same time. By the end of 2009, the program will reach every subdistrict (kecamatan) \nacross Indonesia (6,400 subdistricts, of which about 4,500 are located in rural areas) and full \ncoverage throughout the country will be maintained in 2010. Central Government funding for the \nentire  PNPM  program  is  planned  to  increase  by  23%,  from  Rp10.3  trillion  in  2009  to  an \nestimated Rp12.7 trillion in 2010. The Government has also introduced poverty targeting to \ndetermine the size of community block grants, so that the increased funds are allocated to \nintended beneficiaries. The average size of the block grant for the 2,000 poorest subdistricts \nwas increased to Rp2.6 billion in 2009, from Rp1.8 billion in 2008. \n \n85.  A  unified  household  targeting  database  is  necessary  to  effectively  target  poverty \nprograms.  Many  Government  poverty  alleviation  programs,  such  as  the  unconditional  and \nconditional  cash  transfer  programs,  the  rice  subsidy  program,  and  the  health  insurance \nprogram, are directed to households. However, they are currently implemented by different line \nministries, each using an independent database of beneficiaries. To improve the effectiveness \nand coordination of poverty programs, and reduce duplication of efforts in data collection, the \nGovernment intends to improve the accuracy of information on poor households and move \ntoward the use of a single database. The DPL program will support the establishment of a \nunified household targeting database and the institutional mechanisms to update the database, \nexpected to be completed in 2010.  \n                                                 \n17 ADB is currently supporting PNPM Mandiri through the Rural Infrastructure Support to PNPM-Mandiri (RIS-PNPM) \nproject, which includes community facilitation and mobilization, and rural infrastructure support in the four provinces \nof Jambi, Lampung, Riau, and South Sumatra. \n ", "22  \nC.  Some Key Reforms in DPL/DPSP Core Areas Not Included in the Policy Matrix \n86.  Indonesia\u2019s  progress  in  the  core  policy  areas  that  the  DPL/DPSP  supports  were \ncomplemented by actions not included in the DPL/DPSP policy matrix. These include policies \nunder the PESF to bolster market and investor confidence following the global financial turmoil \nin late 2008, passage of a new Public Service Law, and passage of a regional taxes bill.  \n \n87.  Under the PESF, several measures were initiated to (i) reassure financial markets and \nmaintain financial system stability by enhancing the financial safety net, maintaining the stability \nof the banking system, and ensuring predictability in the Government\u2019s financing requirements \nfor 2009 and 2010; (ii) sustain critical public expenditures while maintaining budget discipline to \nmitigate the poverty impacts of the growth slowdown; and (iii) draw in private investment and \nsupport exports by revising the Presidential Regulation on the DNI, improving transparency in \nrevenues from extractive industries through the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, \nand enhancing access to trade finance.  \n \n88.  The new Public Service Law, passed by Parliament on 23 June 2009, provides a clear \nblueprint for the new administration to pursue civil service reform. The law (i) defines public \nservices  and  public  service  providers;  (ii)  requires  periodic  reporting  on  public  service \nperformance; (iii) authorizes the merger of different Government entities for the purpose of \nincreasing the efficiency and effectiveness of services; (iv) sets forth the rights and obligations \nof  civil  servants;  (v)  obliges  all  institutions  providing  public  services  to  set  clear  service \nstandards;  and  (vi)  establishes  principles  for  handling  complaints  as  well  as  meaningful \nsanctions for nonperformance or wrongdoing. All rules and regulations pertaining to public \nservice provision are required to comply with the stipulations of the new law within 2 years of its \npassage. \n89.  Parliament passed a regional taxes bill in August 2009, to be fully implemented by 2011. \nThe bill, which had been under deliberation since 2006, specifies a closed list of 41 taxes and \nlevies  within  ranges  that  provincial  and  district  authorities  are  allowed  to  impose.  The \nintroduction of a closed-list mechanism in the bill will prevent regions from introducing taxes or \nlevies not included in the list, thus lending a degree of certainty to investors.  \nD.  Triggers for Future DPLs/DPSPs \n90.  The current DPL program is the sixth such operation in Indonesia, and the second of a \n3-year  DPL  series  as  proposed  under  the  World  Bank\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for \nFY2009\u2013FY2012. Indicative triggers for the next DPL series have been developed, as noted \nabove,  after  discussions  between  government  counterparts  and  the  development  partners \ninvolved in the DPL/DPSP process (Table 3).  \n \n91.  The triggers for DPL-7/DPSP-6 will be further discussed and validated with the new \nGovernment. The 2010 program continues to support reforms in the same policy areas. Among \nthe  policy  actions  proposed  are  ones  that  are  intended  to  further  reduce  uncertainty  for \ninvestors by implementing PTSPs; select an operator for the NSW; accelerate tax administration \nreforms; further improve the results orientation of the budget and its execution; continue to \nmove  toward  an  enhanced  regulatory  framework  for  public  procurement,  improve  the \ngovernment accounting and auditing systems (Appendix 8); and launch a unified household \ntargeting database to enhance the pro-poor impact of poverty alleviation programs.  \n ", "23 \n \nTable 3: Indicative Triggers for DPL-7/DPSP-6 \n \nPolicy Aim \nPolicy Area 1: Improving the investment climate \n1.1.

Financing Plan \n92.  The Government has requested a loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources for DPSP-5. DPSP-5 provides parallel cofinancing for the World Bank-supported \nDPL-6, for which the Government has requested $750 million. In addition, the Government \nintends to request $100 million from the Government of Japan for parallel cofinancing of the \nDPL-6. The DPSP loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum; conversion options that may be exercised in \naccordance  with  the  draft  Loan  Agreement,  the  loan  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  conversion \nguidelines;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  program  Loan \nAgreement. The Government has made its own independent decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, and it has given an undertaking that this choice was not made on \nthe basis of any advice from ADB. Responding favorably to the Government\u2019s request will signal \nADB\u2019s relevance in an emerging, confident, and well-performing middle-income country.  \n \n ", "24  \n93.  The Government's gross financing needs have increased from $18.2 billion in 2008 to an \nestimated $25.8 billion in 2009 (Table 4). This reflects a higher fiscal deficit and high levels of \ndomestic  and  foreign  debt  principal  repayment.  ADB\u2019s  proposed  support  is  based  on  the \nstrengths of the policy package, its development impact, the importance of the sectors covered, \nand investment needs.  \n \nTable 4: Projected Financing Requirement of the Government of Indonesia for 2009  \n($ billion) \nFinancing Mix  Proposed Amount \nGross Financing Requirement  25.770 \nLess Amortization  12.150 \nNet Financing Requirement  13.620 \n   \nProgrammed Official External Borrowing for 2009  6.600 \nOf which:   \nADB's Proposed Loan Pipeline for 2009  0.734 \nCapital Market Development Program Cluster II  0.300 \nFifth Development Policy Support Program  0.200 \nIndonesia Infrastructure Financing Facility Project  0.100 \nJava\u2013Bali Electricity Distribution Performance Improvement  0.050 \nRural Infrastructure Support to PNPM Mandiri Project II  0.084 \nADB = Asian Development Bank; PNPM = Program Nasional Pemberdayaan Masyarakat (National Community \nEmpowerment Program) \nNote: Exchange rate: $1 = Rp 10,500. \nSources: Ministry of Finance and ADB estimates. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Management \n94.  The  Coordinating  Ministry  for  Economic  Affairs  will  be  the  Executing  Agency, \ncollaborating closely with MOF. Implementation of DPL-6/DPSP-5 actions is coordinated with \nseveral other ministries and agencies, including BAPPENAS and the Ministry of Trade.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n95.  The program implementation period for DPSP-5 is from January to December 2009.  \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements  \n96.  The  program  loan  of  $200  million  will  be  released  in  a  single  tranche  upon  loan \neffectiveness.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs \n(excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, \nexcluding the items specified in the negative list of ineligible items (Appendix 7) and imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In accordance with ADB provisions for \nsimplifying disbursement of program loans,18 the proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed \nto the Republic of Indonesia as the Borrower. No supporting import documentation will be \nrequired if during each year that loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed the value of \nIndonesia\u2019s  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and \nimports financed under other official development assistance is equal to or greater than the \namount of the loan expected to be disbursed during such year.

", "25 \ncompliance with this formula with each withdrawal request. Otherwise, import documentation \nunder existing procedures will be required.  \n4.  Anticorruption  \n97.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Program. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Program shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Program. In addition, DPSP-5 has \na core focus on improving governance and anticorruption. It promotes transparency in PFM. \nNoteworthy  progress  has  been  achieved  through  the  TSA  system,  which  will  help  the \nGovernment  in  its  anticorruption  efforts.  The  Program\u2019s  focus  on  tax  audit  procedures, \nsimplifying and/or eliminating unnecessary business licenses, and implementing good corporate \ngovernance in state-owned banks will also further the Government\u2019s anticorruption agenda and \nimprove the investment climate. \n \n98.  The Government places significant emphasis on strengthening internal control systems \nand  overall  PFM,  with  support  from  the  World  Bank  through  the  Government  Financial \nManagement  and  Revenue  Administration  Project  and  from  ADB  through  the  State  Audit \nReform  Sector  Development  Program.19  Reforms  and  capacity  development  initiatives \nsupported under both of these programs have led to initial progress in strengthening PFM. \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n99.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification for the withdrawal applications. Before withdrawal, the Government \nwill nominate a deposit account at Bank Indonesia to receive all loan proceeds. The account will \nbe managed, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB.  \n6.  Performance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Program Review \n100.  The CMEA, MOF, and BAPPENAS will continuously monitor implementation of the DPL-\nrelated reforms and their impacts, in line with the overall program framework and outcome and \noutput indicators agreed upon with the Government. Participating development partners will also \nevaluate the triggers based on frequent discussions with key government counterparts, and on \nevidence in the form of key implementation decrees, circulars, etc.  \nV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Expected Impacts \n101.  The key benefits expected from implementation of the Program are \n \n                                                 \n19 ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of Indonesia for the State Audit Reform Sector Development Program. Manila (Loan 2127-INO[SF], \napproved in December, for the equivalent of $25.0 million). \n ", "26  \n(i)  progress  in  meeting  the  Government\u2019s  medium-term  objectives  through \nimprovements in (a) the investment climate, (b) public financial management and \ngovernance, and (c) service delivery to the poor; \n(ii)  raising the profile of key issues at the ministerial level, accelerating the timetable \nfor  policy  actions  to  be  taken,  addressing  administrative  and  bureaucratic \nbottlenecks to reform, and encouraging policy coordination across economic and \nline ministries; \n(iii)  sustained  ADB  engagement  in  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  on  the \ndirection  and  content  of,  and  strategies  for,  its  economic,  structural,  and \ninstitutional  reform  agenda  (with  DPSP-5  providing  for  policy  continuity  and \nconsistency in sectors where ADB has been actively involved); \n(iv)  aid harmonization and cofinancing by the key development partners (ADB, the \nGovernment of Japan, and the World Bank) around a common policy framework \nand dialogue,  \n(v)  facilitation,  through  crosscutting  reforms,  of  sector-specific  reforms  in  areas \nwhere ADB is providing or is planning future support. \n \n102.  Institutional. Significant benefits stem from the engagement of Indonesia\u2019s three main \ndevelopment partners, which collectively provide an estimated 80% of official external support. \nParticipation in the DPL series has contributed to effective institutional coordination among \ndevelopment partners as well as between the Government and these partners (Appendix 6). In \nsome of the core areas, such as public financial management and poverty alleviation, the \ncoordination process is formalized through multi-donor facilities (such as the PFM Multi-Donor \nTrust Fund and the PNPM Support Facility), chaired by the Government and managed by the \nWorld  Bank.  This  has  helped  streamline  and  coordinate  the  provision  of  advisory  support \nthrough  TA  to  best  meet  the  Government\u2019s  needs.  The  measures  supported  under  the \nDPL/DPSP series will result in sustained improvements in institutional capacity in key areas of \npolicy formulation such as fiscal policy, debt and treasury management, and public expenditure \nand financial management. \n \n103.  Social. The main contributions of the DPSP series in this area is to improve public \nadministration, reorient public expenditures toward productive needs, and continuously support \ngovernment  measures  to  align  its  resources  effectively  with  its  medium-term  objectives  of \neconomic growth and poverty reduction. By supporting strategic reforms aimed at improving \npublic service delivery, the Program will have a direct and beneficial social impact. Appendix 9 \npresents a summary poverty reduction and social strategy. \n \n104.  Economic. The nature of the DPSP series limits the scope for quantitative economic \nanalysis. In qualitative terms, the Program's main impacts will be lower business transaction \ncosts,  improved  access  to  assets  (specifically  capital  for  MSMEs),  and  progressive \nimprovements in both the quantity and quality of public services (including better targeting of \nsuch  services  to  the  poor).  It  is  expected  that  the  lower  business  transaction  costs  from \nregulatory reform, and reduced times for business licensing, VAT refunds, and import and \nexport applications through the NSW, will lead to greater competition and encourage more \nproductive investments. These benefits will help foster economic growth and reduce poverty in \nthe medium term. The net effect of improved access to finance for MSMEs will be to reduce \npoverty  indirectly  by  fostering  additional  growth.  Initially,  the  main  beneficiaries  would  be \nMSMEs, with benefits eventually filtering to the wider population through increased employment \ngeneration.  \n ", "27 \n105.  Reforms  to  the  budget  formulation  and  execution  process\u2014through  more  results-\noriented  budget  documents  and  improved  cash  management\u2014would  improve  budget \nallocations and operational efficiency, and reduce corruption. This is likely to be enhanced in the \nmedium to longer term, especially after full adoption of the PBB/MTEF approach in the next 5-\nyear plan. Increases in the 2009 PNPM allocation are expected to have a more immediate effect \nthrough increased block grant transfers for community-led development projects. The programs\u2019 \nnear-term impact on the poor will be realized mostly through the PNPM block grant increases, \nwhile improved service access and delivery for poorer groups will be realized over the medium \nto longer term. \n \n106.  Resettlement, indigenous people, and environment. Implementation of the DPSP-5 \nmeasures will cause no direct or indirect involuntary resettlement, nor will it lead to any issues \naffecting indigenous peoples. The measures supported under DPSP-5 are unlikely to have any \nadverse environmental impacts. \nB.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n107.  Implementation of DPSP-5 is subject to the following risks: \n \n(i)  External vulnerabilities. Indonesia has weathered the global economic crisis \nwell, reflecting its increased resilience to external shocks built up over previous \nyears. Factors limiting the potential impacts of external shocks include diversity \nof  exports,  moderate  public  debt,  limited  external  debt  exposure,  and  an \nadequate level of reserves. The banking sector is also now sufficiently strong. \nThe  maintenance  of  a  financial  sector  safety  net  supported  by  PESF  and \nDPL/DPSP will further improve the resilience of the banking sector.  \n \nNevertheless, risks remain high, especially during a period of global financial \nturmoil. Indonesia has an open financial system. Domestic residents can switch \nto foreign assets easily and foreign holdings are significant, especially in the \nstock market and government bonds. The country is thus vulnerable to shifts in \ninvestor  sentiment.  If  significant  funds  are  pulled  back  because  of  liquidity \ndemands in other countries and/or increased emerging market risk aversion, this \ncould increase pressure on domestic interest and exchange rates. In addition, \nthe Government has large gross financing needs over the next few years, and \ntighter credit markets and increased risk aversion could limit the Government\u2019s \nability to tap international financial markets. This could force the Government to \ncut budgetary outlays to maintain fiscal balance, with adverse consequences for \ninfrastructure and social expenditures. It could also distract the Government from \nimplementing its medium-term reform agenda, including those supported by the \nDPL/DPSP. \n \nThe measures taken since mid-2008 to mitigate the effects of the global financial \ncrisis, including the bilateral swap arrangements with the People's Republic of \nChina and Japan and support from the PESF, will help reduce this risk. But it will \nalso  require  close  cooperation  between  Bank  Indonesia  and  the  economic \nministries to reassure bondholders that their investments are safe (from inflation \nand exchange rate movements) while drawing in private investment through the \nkinds of structural reforms supported by the DPL/DPSP. \n \n ", "28  \n(ii)  Subsidies. As international oil prices have fallen since mid-2008, domestic fuel \nsubsides have also declined. The proposed budget for 2010 envisages energy \nsubsidies of 1.6% of GDP, down from 1.9% of GDP in 2009 and a recent peak of \n4.5% of GDP in 2008. However, the recent increase in international fuel prices \nsuggests that a return to high international fuel prices remains a risk. Fixed \ndomestic fuel prices and the subsidies they create represent a threat to fiscal \nsustainability in the longer term. They are also regressive and inefficient, and \nhave high opportunity costs. The Government has shown its willingness to raise \ndomestic prices and reduce subsidies, most recently in May 2008. ADB will \ncontinue to engage the Government in this area through policy dialogue.  \n \n(iii)  Fiduciary constraints. Utilization of public resources continues to be a concern, \nnotwithstanding the improvements underway. The overall fiduciary assessments \nundertaken since the 2001 country financial accountability assessment point to \nconsiderable  improvements  in  Indonesia's  fiduciary  environment.  Ongoing \nprograms supported by several development partners provide significant TA to \nstrengthen fiduciary governance. The DPL/DPSP focus on strengthening budget \npreparation,  execution,  and  transparency  in  financial  management  will \nsignificantly enhance transparency (Appendix 8). \n \n(iv)  Security  risks.  Alerts  stemming  from  sectarian  and  regional  conflicts  and \nterrorism could slow foreign direct investment and set back the tourism industry. \nThe  Government  and  law  enforcement  authorities  have  taken  a  range  of \nmeasures aimed at bolstering public and investor confidence. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n108.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n(i)  Counterpart funds will be used to finance the development needs as outlined \nunder DPSP-5 implementation arrangements. \n(ii)  The policies and actions taken before the date of the DPSP-5 Loan Agreement, \nas described in the development policy letter (including the policy matrix), will \ncontinue to be in effect for the duration of ADB\u2019s engagement in the DPL series, \nand subsequently.

From DPL-4/DPSP-3 the Government and development \npartners agreed to remove macroeconomic stability and creditworthiness as a core policy area, and replace it with improved delivery of public services. \nSource: Government of Indonesia. \n \n ", "Appendix 3  41 \nRESULTS ACHIEVED UNDER THE DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN/ \nDEVELOPMENT POLICY SUPPORT PROGRAM \nA.  Core Policy Area 1: Macroeconomic Stability \n \n1.  The DPL/DPSP series in 2004\u20132006 sought to improve debt management and fiscal \npolicy management by reducing subsidies to the nonpoor and making revenue administration \nmore efficient through the expansion of modern tax officers. \n \n2.  Overall  macroeconomic  fundamentals  remain  sound  and  fiscal  consolidation  has \nimproved with the expansion of the tax base and improved efficiency of tax administration. From \n2004\u20132008, economic growth averaged a substantive 5.7%, the public debt-to-gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) ratio declined nearly 28 percentage points to a moderate 33%, budget deficits \nwere manageable, and international reserves remained adequate to provide the country with a \ncomfortable liquidity cushion. Increasing non-oil and gas revenues as a percentage of GDP \nwere supported by a prior DPL/DPSP action to expand modernization of tax offices and the tax \nbase  to  include  medium  and  small  taxpayers.  Additional  reforms  to  improve  tax  analysis, \nincluding the creation of a Tax Policy Office, are expected to generate improvements in revenue \ncollection.  \n \n3.  On the expenditure side, reductions in untargeted fuel subsidies in 2005 allowed greater \nsocial spending, but untargeted subsidies remain burdensome. In 2005, the Government raised \nfuel prices, resulting in the decline of fuel subsidies from 4% of GDP in 2004 to 2.8% in 2006, \nfreeing up $10 billion a year. This amount was rolled out into cash transfers targeted at the poor, \nor went toward higher health and education expenditures. However, as oil prices continued to \nbreak records throughout 2008, fuel subsidies rose sharply, causing the Government to spend \nan  additional  Rp50  trillion  (1.2%  of  GDP)  in  the  first  part  of  the  year.  In  May 2008,  the \nGovernment again increased fuel prices by almost 30% and accompanied this with a widely \npublicized and improved cash transfer program. This move, together with a reduction in oil \nprices in the second half of 2008, limited the energy subsidy in 2008 to 4.5% of GDP. \n \n4.  Rating  agencies  have  responded  favorably  to  Indonesia\u2019s  lower  debt  ratio  and  the \nreform packages. In a reflection of the country\u2019s more sound economic footing, all three credit \nagencies have raised their credit ratings at least three notches since 2003. Standard and Poor\u2019s \nupgraded Indonesia\u2019s credit rating from CCC+ in 2003 to BB\u2013 by 2008; likewise in this period, \nMoody\u2019s raised its ratings from B2 to Ba3; and Fitch raised its from B to BB. In supporting their \nratings upgrades, the agencies cited debt reduction as the primary cause, as well as the \nGovernment\u2019s  commitment  to  broad-based  reform,  including  changes  to  investment  laws, \ncustoms and tax reforms, and fiscal reforms, specifically in treasury and budget\u2014measures \nsupported by the DPL/DPSP series. \n \nB.

The DPL/DPSP series seeks to improve the investment climate through several key \nentry areas, including regulatory reform, tax reform, custom and trade reform, financial sector \nstability, and improved access to finance by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). \n \n6.  In 2006, the Government issued three economic policy packages covering investment \nclimate, infrastructure, and financial reform. In 2007, a comprehensive follow-up package was \nissued  detailing  168  specific  reform  measures  to  be  carried  out.  As  a  result,  business \nperceptions have improved. A study of manufacturing firms in mid-2007 indicated improvements \n ", "42   Appendix 3 \nin  VAT  refunds,  tax  filing  processes,  informal  payments,  and  faster  import  and  custom \nclearance. Surveys of foreign investors also show that perceptions of Indonesia are improving. \nIn the annual Japan Bank of International Cooperation survey, 620 Japanese multinational \ncompanies, operating in global markets, ranked Indonesia the eighth most promising country for \noverseas business in 2008, similar to its rank in the previous year. Although full implementation \nof  the  investment  policy  packages  has  yet  to  take  place,  initial  signs  are  encouraging\u2014\ninvestment rates have risen from less than 20% of GDP in 2003 to 27.6% in 2008. \n \n7.  Regulatory reforms supported by the DPL/DPSP process, particularly those relating to \nsimplifying  and  eliminating  unnecessary  business  licenses  and  multiple  registration \nrequirements, have led to more streamlined procedures supportive of the investment climate. \nAccording to Doing Business 2010, the time to set up a business has fallen significantly from \n168 days in 2003, to 105 days in 2007, to 60 days in 2009.1 Another key achievement has been \nthe passage of the Investment Law, which clarified previously arbitrary investment rules. The \nlaw  focuses  on  equal  treatment  of  foreign  and  domestic  investment,  removes  the  forced \ndivestment and limited duration of foreign investment in the old law, lengthens the time horizon \nto hold land, liberalizes some immigration procedures, and allows for international arbitration. \n \n8.  Tax reform has addressed some of the key complaints from the business community. \nReforms in tax administration have halved the time for VAT refunds; in addition, more than \nRp10 trillion (roughly $1 billion) in outstanding VAT refunds have been settled. New procedures \nhave been put in place to issue VAT refunds to export companies within set time frames. \nStandard operating procedures for a complaint management system have been issued. The \nDPL/DPSP has also supported the issuance of a decree on tax audit procedures that allows \ntaxpayers to delay payment of tax assessments from disputed audits. However, this decree only \naffects disputes arising since the 2008 tax year; older disputes continue to be arbitrated under \nthe old rule. \n \n9.  Significant progress on trade and customs reform has been made, with pilot testing of \nIndonesia\u2019s national single window (NSW) and paperless import clearance. Implementation of \nthe NSW is one of the country\u2019s most important trade facilitation initiatives. Under a single \nwindow, exporters and importers will no longer be required to apply individually to multiple \nagencies\u2014significantly reducing the number of days it takes to export and import goods. A pilot \nproject is underway in Jakarta\u2019s main port and will be expanded to other ports in preparation for \nthe establishment of an ASEAN single window. Other trade reforms sought by the DPL aimed to \nimprove the technical capacity of the tariff team in setting and evaluating tariff changes and \nnontariff barriers imposed by line ministries. \n \n10.  An original objective of the DPL/DPSP series was to strengthen the financial sector by \nreducing the role of state-owned banks and increasing the share of financial assets at nonbank \nfinancial institutions. As of June 2008, the share of state-owned banks in the banking system \n(36%) was a significant 10 percentage points less than in 2003, indicating that the role of private \nbanks  in  the  sector  is  increasing.  Less  progress  has  been  made  with  nonbank  financial \ninstitutions\u2014they accounted for 19.9% of total assets in the financial sector as of March 2008, \ncompared with a 17.4% share in 2005. However, other indicators point to a healthier financial \nsystem\u2014profitability ratios such as net interest margin, return on assets, and return on equity \nremain  strong.  Nonperforming  loans,  particularly  in  state-owned  banks,  have  declined \nsubstantially after peaking in 2005. In terms of diversification, SME lending has been rising \nrapidly and now accounts for half of the lending portfolio.  \n                                                 \n1 World Bank. 2009. Doing Business 2010. Washington, DC. \n ", "Appendix 3  43 \n11.  In strengthening the stability of the financial sector, the DPL/DPSP has supported the \nimplementation of a sounder financial safety net. At the start of the DPL series, there was a \nneed to reduce the economic distortion and potential moral hazard caused by the blanket \nguarantee that existed at the time, which had been introduced during the Asian crisis 1997\u2013\n1998  to  stem  bank  runs.  To  this effect,  the DPL/DPSP  series supported  several  reforms, \nincluding a deposit insurance scheme, institutionalizing Bank Indonesia\u2019s role as lender of last \nresort, and establishing institutional processes and mechanisms for resolving troubled banks. \nBy the end of the DPL-4/DPSP-3 in 2007, coverage on deposits had been reduced from a \nblanket guarantee in 2003 to Rp100 million. Indonesia is one of the few countries in the world \nthat removed its blanket guarantee on schedule. In October 2008 the authorities announced \nseveral confidence-building measures in response to the global financial crisis, including a \ntwenty-fold increase in the deposit guarantee to Rp2 billion (approximately $200,000).  \n \nC.  Core Policy Area 3: Public Financial Management and Governance \n \n12.  To  improve  the  efficiency,  transparency,  and  accountability  of  public  finances,  the \nDPL/DPSP series has focused on three key areas of reform: (i) modernizing public financial \nmanagement  systems,  (ii)  strengthening  institutional  reform  within  the  Ministry  of  Finance \n(MOF), and more recently (iii) civil service reform.  \n \n13.  Changes in the legal and regulatory architecture for PFM are now largely complete and \nthe focus has moved toward implementing a modern PFM system. Before the start of the \nDPL/DPSP series, the Government\u2019s financial operations were based on outdated laws (from \n1925) that had been updated with a series of inadequate decrees. The previous PFM system \nallowed for systematic and pervasive corruption, collusion, and nepotism because assignments \nwere unclear, transparency was low, and enforcement poor. Budget formulation was opaque \nand inefficient, making it difficult to quantify basic concepts of the budget. Budget execution was \noften delayed and monitoring arrangements were weak. Procurement processes were prone to \ncorruption and collusion. Accounting and reporting were fragmented and not always reliable, \nand mandates of government audit bodies were not clearly defined. The DPL supported various \nmeasures in the areas of budget preparation and execution to create the regulatory framework \nfor a more modern PFM system.  \n \n14.  A key achievement under the DPL/DPSP series has been the implementation of the TSA \nto improve cash management of public finances. At the start of the DPL series, more than \n18,000 commercial bank accounts\u2014and other accounts not even known to the Treasury\u2014\nhandled government funds. As an initial step, DPL-1 addressed regulatory deficiencies in the \nPFM  system,  including  the  passage  of  several  laws  defining  the  regulatory  framework. \nReorganization of MOF was also carried out to begin the process of establishing a TSA, and to \nclean  up  the  Government\u2019s  cash  management  issues.  DPL-2/DPSP-1  then  supported \nregulations underlining these laws and adopted an implementation plan. DPL-3/DPSP-2 pilot \ntested the TSA to have zero-balance accounts in more than 50 provincial treasury offices \n(KPPNs).  DPL-4/DPSP-3  extended  the  TSA  coverage  to  nearly  full  implementation  on \ngovernment  expenditure  accounts.  Progress  on  covering  revenue  accounts  was  more \ncomplicated, but has now advanced significantly. \n \n15.  Budgeting  procedures  have  improved,  but  execution  remains  problematic.  The \nDPL/DPSP series has helped move forward reforms to reengineer business processes across \nthe budget cycle. The national budget is now compatible with the international standard GFS \nclassification. Fiscal reporting is more comprehensive and timely. Elements of a medium-term \nexpenditure framework have been introduced, although they are not yet fully operational in the \n ", "44   Appendix 3 \nbudget system. Whereas the planning and reporting side of the budget process has improved, \nexecuting the budget has remained weak, with about 50% of capital expenditures being spent in \nthe last quarter. \n \n16.  Procurement  reform  has  been  slow  to  take  off.  The  original  trigger  aimed  only  at \nstrengthening the existing National Procurement Office. Instead, the Government established a \nnew National Public Procurement Agency (LKPP) as an independent office directly responsible \nto the President. As an independent agency with adequate resources, authority, and strong \npolitical backing, it will be in a stronger position to drive public procurement reform. However, \nbecause of the time required to set up the LKPP, there was a lack of progress on other \nprocurement reforms, such as developing a comprehensive national public sector procurement \nlaw. This law is needed to address the numerous inconsistencies resulting from decentralization \nreforms, which have enabled authorities at various levels of government to issue their own \nprocurement procedures. Other deficiencies of the system include slow progress in the passage \nof  regulations,  and  the  adoption  of  standard  tools  such  as  bidding  documents  and  user \nmanuals. \n \n17.  Initial steps to address civil service reform have been launched. Lack of administrative \ncapacity  and  distorted  incentives  in  government  bureaucracy  have  constrained both  policy \nimplementation and delivery of public services. As an initial step to reforming the civil service, \nthe  DPL/DPSP  in  2006-2007  supported  comprehensive  reform  of  the  structure  and \nremuneration framework for high-ranking state officials. A task force was set up to examine the \nentire compensation package with the goal of creating a more transparent, systematic, and \ncoherent framework for pay and allowances based on a comprehensive job evaluation and pay \ngrading. Building on this, MOF has developed a comprehensive civil service reform plan and \naction plan for itself, which is now being pilot-tested in other agencies.  \n \nD.  Core Policy Area 4: Improved Delivery of Public Services \n \n18.  The groundwork for improving poverty targeting of basic services has been initiated. \nBefore the rise in fuel prices in 2005, Indonesia\u2019s social protection system was characterized by \nemergency short-term safety net programs and price subsidies. The country\u2019s three targeted \nprograms accounted for less than 0.5% of GDP, compared with almost 4.0% of GDP for the \nuntargeted fuel subsides, of which less than 0.2% of GDP went to the poorest quintile. As the \nfuel price hike freed up more funds for social spending, the DPL supported capacity building \ninitiatives  to  improve  the  targeting  of  these  released  funds.  The  2005  fuel  hike  was \naccompanied by a new cash transfer program to help alleviate the impact on the poorest \nhouseholds\u2014representing a substantial shift from the ineffective and inefficient general subsidy \nprogram. Evaluative assessments were conducted to improve targeting and performance of the \ncash transfer program, and the lessons were incorporated into the new cash transfer program \nthat accompanied the May 2008 fuel price increase. The Government has moved to set up a \ncomprehensive monitoring and evaluation function, including the establishment of a unit to \nundertake  performance  evaluations,  with  the  findings  to  be  used  as  an  input  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s planning and budgeting cycle. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 4  45   \n ", "46   Appendix 4 \n \n ", "  Appendix 4  47   \n \n ", "48   Appendix 4 \n ", "  Appendix 4  49   \n \n ", " \nPOLICY MATRIX FOR THE FIFTH DEVELOPMENT POLICY SUPPORT PROGRAM  5\n0\n \nDPSP-5 Policy Measures  Status as of September 2009 \nA\nCore Policy Area I: Improved Investment Climate  p\np\ne\nA.

Major Development Partners \n \n1.  The  DPL/DPSP  series  is  a  partnership  between  the  Government  of  Indonesia,  the \nGovernment of Japan, the World Bank and ADB.  ADB began participating in the series in \n2005,1 contributing $200 million annually for a total of $800 million through 31 December 2008.  \nThe Government of Japan's contribution was $100 million annually during 2004\u20132006 and in \n2008, and $200 million in 2007. The World Bank's contribution rose from $300 million for DPL-1 \nin 2004 to $750 million for DPL-5 and DPL-6 in 2008 and 2009 respectively, for a total of $3,400 \nmillion. \n \n2.  A number of bilateral and multilateral agencies provide technical assistance in the core \nareas of the DPL/DPSP.  Table A6 presents some key programs of development partners in \nthese core areas. \n \nB.   Institutional Arrangements and Processes for Development Coordination \n \n3.  Since the dissolution of the Consultative Group for Indonesia process in 2007, there has \nnot  been  a  regular  development  partners'  forum  although  BAPPENAS  has  maintained \nresponsibility for overall coordination among development partners.  Donor coordination is also \nsupported through institutional arrangements under key Government programs. For example, \nthe DPL series has contributed to effective institutional coordination in key reform areas among \ndevelopment  partners  as  well  as  between  the  Government  and  these  partners.  In  public \nfinancial  management  and  improved  public  service  delivery  to  the  poor,  the  coordination \nprocess is also formalized through multi-donor facilities, such as the PFM Multi-Donor Trust \nFund and the PNPM Support Facility, chaired by the Government and managed by the World \nBank.2 This has helped streamline and coordinate the provision of advisory support through \ntechnical assistance (TA) to best meet the Government\u2019s needs. \n \nC.  Achievements and Issues \n \n4.  Significant benefits stem from the DPL/DPSP partnership. Policy triggers were defined \non  the  basis  of  mutual  trust  and  understanding  between  the  Government  and  the  three \ndevelopment partners, with a clear understanding of the direction of reforms, without excessive \nspecificity that would create political difficulties or compromise the flexibility of the Government \nin overcoming obstacles to reform. This was especially important in areas where the Executing \nAgency, the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs (CMEA), or the agencies working most \nclosely with it\u2014MOF and the National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS)\u2014had no \ndirect control over implementation of a particular reform, as other agencies or Parliament were \ninvolved. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB did not provide financial support to the first DPL (DPL-1), which began in 2004, and a different title\u2013DPSP\u2013\nhas been adopted for ADB operations. The Correspondence between DPL and DPSP is as follows: DPL-1 = ADB's \nparticipation through policy dialogue; DPL-2 = DPSP-1; DPL-3 = DPSP-2; DPL-4 = DPSP-3; DPL-5 = DPSP-4; \nDPL-6 = DPSP-5 \n2 The PFM Multi-Donor Trust Fund is funded by contributions from the European Commission (\u20ac 9.2million) and by \nthe Government of the Netherlands ($6 million).  The PNPM Support Facility is funded by contributions from \nAusAid  ($4.2  million),  Danish  International  Development  Agency  ($10  million),  Department  for  International \nDevelopment ($5.5 million), and Government of the Netherlands ($37.3 million). \n ", "54  Appendix 6 \n5.  The  DPL/DPSP  facility  provided  a  useful  platform  for  coordination  of  development \npartners' policies and programs in related areas, enabling a consistent approach to critical \nreform issues. The support by Australia, ADB, the Government of Japan, and World Bank for \nthe Public Expenditure Support Facility is a case in point.  Sharing of technical advisory support, \ninformation, and data also led to cooperation in other operational areas, notably in programs to \nsupport reforms for infrastructure development with parallel cofinancing from ADB, Government \nof Japan and World Bank. \n \nD.

Background and Analytical Underpinnings \n \n1.  This note summarizes the current state of the public financial management system, maps \nthe reform efforts being conducted, and provides an outlook with regards to overcoming current \nreform challenges, with a view to assessing fiduciary risks.  \n \n2.  Public financial management (PFM) reform, as previously outlined in the Government's \nWhite Paper1, continues to be at the center of attention of Indonesian policy makers, with the \nglobal  economic  downturn  adding  further  urgency  to  the  agenda:  Indonesia  anticipates  a \nsubstantial reduction in both tax revenues and foreign exchange reserves resulting from the \nslowdown in the economy and sluggish trade. The exchange rate has weakened since last year, \ndriving up the cost of foreign debt servicing, and unemployment is high, which will adversely \nimpact the poverty rate.  \n \n3.  The crisis has fortunately been tempered by a decline in world oil prices. The decrease in \noil prices has resulted in a reduction of oil subsidies, providing more fiscal space in the budget to \ncounter the effects of the global economic downturn. Also, as a result of ongoing efforts among \nkey stakeholders, well-sustained reforms have mitigated the impact of this downturn on the \ncountry\u2019s  economy.  Nonetheless,  PFM  systems  in  the  country  now  face  unprecedented \nchallenges to ensure efficient and effective budget allocations and disbursements, in line with the \npolicy responses to the global and domestic economic turmoil.  \n \n4.  In the face of these challenges, the commitment of key stakeholders in the budget \nprocess to vigorously pursuing the reform agenda remains unwavering and strong. The evolving \nagenda continues to be broad-based, comprising (i) improving results orientation in state budget \nplanning and development, (ii) improving budget and treasury management, (iii) strengthening \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  of  public  expenditures  and  programs,  (iv)  improving  public \nprocurement systems, and (v) improving the Government accounting and audit functions. In \nsummary, the agenda is designed to improve how revenues are raised and how funds are \nallocated, used, and accounted for\u2014both at the central and regional levels. PFM improvement \ncontinues to be a key area of focus for DPL-6/DPSP-5, which will be a crucial instrument for the \nGovernment to flexibly, and in a self-determined fashion, underpin and flank its reform targets.  \n \n5.  The following assessment draws on recent economic and sector work undertaken by \nAsian Development Bank (ADB), the World Bank, and other development partners. A public \nexpenditure and financial accountability assessment was concluded in June 2008. In addition, \nthis assessment has taken into account the findings of a joint World Bank\u2013IMF mission on \nstrengthening budget management undertaken in June 2008, the results of a previous joint \nWorld Bank\u2014IMF mission on budget reform priorities reported to the Government in June 2007, \nthe September 2008 update of the Report on Observance of Standards and Codes on Fiscal \nTransparency in Indonesia from 2006,2 and an ADB sector report on accountability and audit in \nIndonesia.3 The assessment also draws on the ongoing policy dialogue and advisory services \n                                                 \n1  Financial Management Reform Committee. 2002.

Reform Priorities: Achievements, Challenges and the Way Forward \n \n1.  Improving Results-Orientation in State Budget Planning and Development \n \n6.  To  facilitate  policy-based  budgeting,  the  Government  continues  to  prioritize  the \nimplementation  of  performance-based  budgeting  (PBB)  and  the  medium-term  expenditure \nframework (MTEF). The Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the National Development Planning \nAgency  (BAPPENAS)  have  been  working  together  in  developing  a  road  map  for  the \nimplementation of PBB in Indonesia starting from 2009, as required in the State Finance Law. \n \n7.  Based on the PFM reform framework as legislated, BAPPENAS and MOF have started \nrevising  the  existing  program  structure  used  for  planning  and  budgeting  purposes  to  align \nprograms  with  organizational  structures  and  with  the  development  agenda  defined  in  the \nMedium-Term  National  Development  Plan  (RPJM).  The  new  program  structure  will  be \nincorporated in the RPJM for 2010\u20132014, and is intended to be used during 2010 for the \npreparation of the 2011 budget.  \n \n8.  The budget and work plans of agencies (RKA-KL) are currently being revised to simplify \nbudget  submissions  and  link  them  more  closely  to  programs.  A  manual  on  planning  and \nbudgeting  for  restructuring  program  within  a  PBB  framework  has  been  finalized  by  the \nDirectorate General for Budget and BAPPENAS, and has been issued under a circular signed \njointly by the Minister of Finance and the Minister for BAPPENAS. The contents and procedures \nof this manual are now being disseminated to all budget holders. It is anticipated that the reforms \nprescribed in the manual will be implemented in the 2011 budget preparation process. Forward \nestimates at the aggregate level, based on MTEF, were introduced in the 2008 and 2009 state \nbudgets. \n \n9.  MOF is also in the process of building its capacity in strategic performance management \nbased on the \u201cbalanced scorecard\u201d performance management tool. The possibility of interfacing \nsome  balanced  scorecard  indicators  with  corresponding PBB  indicators  being  developed  to \nmonitor and evaluate program implementation is being explored.  \n \n10.  Generally, a need still exists to deepen and sustain momentum in reforming Indonesia\u2019s \nbudget system. The continuing objective is to make state budget planning and development \nmore results-based, and to improve links between policy, planning, and budgeting in accordance \nwith the intent of the Law on State Finances. To this end, the Government\u2019s capability to assess \nthe impact of various policy decisions on key economic and fiscal indicators needs to be further \nenhanced. Also, staff in various ministries require more training in PBB and MTEF.  \n \n11.  In terms of legislative oversight, the House of Representatives' (DPR's) role in shaping \nthe state budget and fiscal policy has been institutionalized by law. Budget documentation has \nalso improved significantly. The DPR\u2019s Budget Commission is currently discussing proposals to \nenact a new law defining the role and authority of DPR, including a proposal to establish a \nparliamentary budget office. \n                                                 \n4  World Bank. 2004. Loan to the Government of Indonesia for the Government Financial Management and Revenue \nAdministration Project in Support of the First Phase of the Government Financial Management and Revenue \nAdministration Program. Washington, DC. \n ", "Appendix 8  59 \n12.  However, the DPR continues to face several structural challenges, particularly in the \nareas of (i) building independent support and research capacity to support legislative budget \nreview; (ii) general capacity development in budget analysis and oversight, including familiarity \nwith PBB and MTEF; and (iii) follow-up of external audit findings to ensure that the executive is \nheld accountable for transparent and efficient budget execution. Capacity development of the \nDPR will thus remain an important reform goal.  \n \n2.  Improving Budget and Treasury Management \n \n13.  Though significant advances have been made in the budget preparation side, actual \nexpenditures continue to deviate from plan. Indonesia thus remains committed to smoothing \nbudget implementation and execution through modernization of the treasury system. Most of the \nregulations  to  support  the  implementation  of  the  State  Treasury  Law  of  2004  have  been \nestablished, while others are being finalized. The design and implementation of an automated \ntreasury and budget system (SPAN) is ongoing. SPAN, as a crosscutting reform, will increase \nthe timeliness, reliability, and transparency of budget disbursement and reporting as well as \nimprove the capability of managers in the efficient management of public resources. Business \nprocess improvements in the area of budget formulation and budget execution are underway and \nare expected to be completed by 2011. A SPAN turnkey implementation vendor has already \nbeen contracted (the contract was signed on 10 July 2009).  \n \n14.  A new Treasury Transformation Directorate, which will focus on SPAN implementation, \nhas been established. Ministerial decrees establishing a project governance system for SPAN \nhave been issued. SPAN is projected to become operational in the central treasury beginning in \n2011, and will be rolled out to provincial treasury offices (KPPNs) and pilot line ministries in \n2012,  replacing  the  multitude  of  financial  data  processing  applications  currently  used  by \nGovernment institutions.  \n \n15.  The  latest  challenges  for  MOF  in  implementing  SPAN  include  reviewing  and \nreformulating the chart of accounts, and strengthening MOF\u2019s capability to provide ICT services \nfor SPAN. The capacity development needs for both preparatory and implementation activities \nunder SPAN will thus be considerable. It will be necessary to tap advisory services to facilitate \nthe implementation of treasury reforms in general, and SPAN in particular. Also, it is recognized \nthat building the capacity of agencies for accounting standards, including migration to accrual \naccounting, is a priority. \n \n16.  Cash management has improved significantly with the continued implementation of the \nTSA, and since 2007 TSA for expenditure management has been launched in all MOF Treasury \noffices.  An  annual  census  of  Government  bank  accounts  revealed  that  a  large  number  of \naccounts were still outside the coverage of the TSA, and that the TSA arrangement did not \nadequately cover bank accounts used for revenue collection. The TSA is now being extended to \ncover imprest bank accounts currently owned by budget holders for petty cash and salary \npayments. The extension of TSA to cover revenue bank accounts is being rolled out from July \n2009 to January 2010.  \n \n17.  Cash-flow forecasting has been rudimentary and the poor quality of cash forecasts is one \nof the factors resulting in year-end bunching of expenditures. The accelerated drawdown of \nGovernment cash balances in December perpetuates wasteful procurement practices and also \nimpacts monetary policy. The recently concluded joint World Bank\u2013International Monetary Fund \n(IMF)  assessment  of  the  Government\u2019s  asset  and  liabilities  management  indicated  that  the \nuncoordinated management of the gross asset\u2013liability portfolio of the Government and Bank \n ", "60   Appendix 8 \nIndonesia could lead to substantial risk to the overall balance sheet. The risks need to be \nmitigated  through  optimization  of  borrowing  and  better  reserve  management.  Critical  TSA \nimplementation milestones have been incorporated as performance indicators in the DPL series. \n \n3.  Strengthening Monitoring and Evaluation of Public Expenditures and \nPrograms \n \n18.  To ensure more effective public spending, improved capacity to analyze the efficiency \nand effectiveness of public spending is essential. BAPPENAS recently established a separate \ndepartment  and  designated  a  deputy  to  monitor  and  evaluate  public  expenditures.  Several \nanalytical pieces have been produced in the last few years, and efforts by BAPPENAS and MOF \nto  improve  the  quality  of  public  spending  by  improving  public  service  delivery  should  be \nbolstered.  \n \n19.  The  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  implementation  of  the  new  RPJM  will  require \nBAPPENAS to continue to expand expenditure analyses at the sector level (e.g., education, \nhealth, agriculture, and infrastructure). A deeper understanding of spending in different sectors \nshould  also  enhance  the  general  capacity  of  BAPPENAS  and  line  agencies  to  implement \nperformance-based budgeting.  \n \n4.  Improving the Public Procurement System \n \n20.  Presidential  Decree  80/2003  provided  a  national  public  procurement  regulation  that \nmeets  most  of  what  is  generally  regarded  as  accepted  international  practice,  including \ntransparency, open competition, economy, and efficiency. This decree also paved the way for \nestablishing  a  regulatory  body  for  public  procurement.  With  the  introduction  of  Presidential \nDecree 80/2003, a previous certification (\u201cpre-qualification\u201d) process for suppliers and providers \nof goods and services was, in most instances, abandoned by the Government. Presidential \nDecree 80/2003 also established the basis for sanctions and for complaint handling, and laid out \nrequirements for certification of users. In December 2007 an independent agency, the National \nPublic Procurement Agency (LKPP), that is responsible for sustainable, integrated, focused, and \ncoordinated planning and development of strategies, policies, and regulations associated with \nthe  procurement  of  goods,  works,  and  services  using  public  funds,  was  established.  This \ninstitution reports directly to the President of Indonesia. In addition to the chair, who heads \nLKPP, and an executive secretary, there are four departments, each headed by a deputy with \nresponsibilities for (i) strategy and policy development, (ii) monitoring evaluation and information \nsystems, (iii) human resources development, and (iv) legal affairs and settlement of objections. \nThe LKPP is currently operational with plans for further staffing. \n \n21.  While Presidential Decree 80/2003 was a welcome development for the country, the \npublic  procurement  system  still  has  significant  regulatory  and  implementation  deficiencies. \nProgress has been slow in developing solid procurement regulations, standard tools for bidding \ndocuments, and procurement guidelines. Collusion and corruption in the bidding process as well \nas  concerns  over  the  efficiency  of  complaint  mechanisms  and  sanction  measures  are  still \nsignificant. However, the most glaring deficiency is the absence of professional procurement \nmanagement and weak procurement capacity in the implementing agencies, especially at the \nprovincial and district levels. \n \n22.  The existence of these deficiencies is supported by the findings of various analytical tools \nand reports, such as the self-diagnostic assessment conducted by the Government in 2007, \nwhich used a baseline indicators tool developed under the World Bank and OECD Development \n ", "Appendix 8  61 \nAssistance Committee Procurement Round Table initiative. The assessment of the baseline \nindicators presents a \u201csnapshot\u201d comparison of the actual system against international standards \nor  the  \u201cmodel  system\u201d  that  the  baseline  indicators  represent.  Baseline  benchmarking  of \nIndonesia\u2019s procurement system in June 2007 showed it scoring 62.5% for the legislative and \nregulatory framework (pillar I), 55% for institutional framework and management capacity (pillar \nII), 59.3% for procurement operations and market practices (pillar III) and 69% for integrity and \ntransparency of the public procurement system (pillar IV).5 While the establishment of LKPP \nwould improve the score for pillar II, the baseline assessment indicates that many areas would \nstill need further improvement. \n \n23.  The LKPP is currently moving on parallel tracks to reform the public procurement system \nas follows: \n \n24.  Legislative and regulatory framework. The LKPP is currently working on two tracks: \npreparation  of  a  new  procurement  law,  and  revision  of  Presidential  Decree  80/2003.  The \npreparation and enactment of a new procurement law may be a lengthy process, slowed by \nsignificant  stakeholder  consultation  processes  and  consensus  building  efforts  aimed  at \novercoming possible opposition from interest groups. As an interim measure, LKPP is in the \nprocess  of  reviewing  Presidential  Decree  80/2003.  The  main  purpose  of  this  review  is  to \nreorganize it into different sections dealing with specific topics and to mandate use of a new set \nof standard bidding documents. This process is behind schedule because of the methodology of \nwork being carried through a committee, which generates lengthy discussions and necessitates \nconsensus building. LKPP has prepared a draft of the revised Presidential Decree 80/2003 and \npresented  it  to  key  development  partners  for  review.  The  draft  will  then  be  submitted  for \ninterministerial review. Having a revised presidential decree and its potential endorsement this \nyear would represent an important reform step that could lead to changes in the way the 2010 \nbudget is implemented.  \n \n25.  The country currently lacks national standard bidding documents that are used regularly \nby all government agencies. Some implementing agencies (such as the Ministry of Public Works) \nhave developed standard bidding documents for their own use. The predecessor of LKPP, \nthrough the support of ADB, drafted eight national model (standard) bidding documents including \n(i) an explanatory guide, (ii) goods with prequalification, (iii) goods with postqualification, (iv) \nworks  with  prequalification,  (v)  works  with  postqualification,  (vi)  other  services  with \nprequalification, (vii) other services with postqualification, and (viii) consulting services. The use \nof these documents is still not mandatory and they are being used on a pilot basis. It is important \nfor LKPP to collect final comments from users on these documents, improve them, and mandate \ntheir use nationally. One improvement would be to harmonize such documents with those of \ninternational  development  partners  like  ADB,  the  Australian  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment (AusAID), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) , and the World Bank. \n \n26.  The approach of LKPP toward preparing a procurement law and reviewing Presidential \nDecree 80/2003 will ensure phased progress toward meeting the Government's agenda, taking \ninto  account  coordination  among  different  agencies  (LKPP,  ministries,  Parliament,  etc.).  To \nmaximize the opportunity for reform when preparing the procurement law, it is important to \nconsider that a number of laws have been enacted since 2000 that impact, or make reference to, \npublic procurement. These include a construction law, as well as laws on state finance, treasury, \naudit, and small-scale business. The pace of Indonesia\u2019s decentralization reforms has impacted \n                                                 \n5 The indicators suggest, for example, that 69% of the standards for integrity and transparency were achieved. \n ", "62   Appendix 8 \npublic sector procurement at all levels of Government, with ministers, governors, and even \nmayors able to issue decrees, regulations, and instructions.  \n \n27.  The regulations are often inconsistent and some do not meet accepted international \npractice. Consequently, national procurement reform and the need for national procurement \npolicies and standards are critical. Indonesia\u2019s legal framework for public sector procurement can \nbest be strengthened by anchoring it with an overarching consolidated and comprehensive \nnational public sector procurement law at the highest level that (i) establishes the fundamental \nprinciples  and  procedures  applicable  to  all  public  sector  procurement,  (ii)  establishes  clear \nresponsibilities  for  a  permanent  procurement  management  function  within  implementing \nagencies, (iii) amends other laws that refer to public sector procurement and ensures that the \nnew law has the necessary authority in a decentralized environment. In the meantime, the review \nof Presidential Decree 80/2003 should attempt to address some of these issues.  \n \n28.  Public procurement function and capacity building. There has been growing concern, \nboth  in  the  Government  and  among  international  development  partners,  over  the  pace  of \nimplementation of development projects. Significant delays and slow disbursement plague the \nentire PFM cycle. Projects report delays and difficulties in budget preparation and approval, \nbudget execution, and procurement. Specifically, concerns have arisen over the organization of \nthe procurement management function and the capacity of procurement committee members. \nWhile Presidential Decree 80/2003 requires certification of all procurement committee members, \nthe current certification process does not support the development of procurement capacity and \nthe  current  ad  hoc  nature  of  procurement  management  inhibits  the  buildup  of  sustainable \nknowledge within implementing agencies. \n \n29.  LKPP is currently conducting a survey to identify deficiencies in the procurement process \nand determine the various levels of competency required for carrying out procurement tasks. It is \nalso in the process of recruiting a long-term international expert to support the development of a \nnational strategy on capacity development in  procurement. In addition, LKPP is developing \ndifferent models for introducing central procurement units at ministries and local governments. \n \n30.  In  summary,  several  procurement  reform  initiatives  are  underway,  but  progress  in \nprocurement  reform  has  nonetheless  been  slow.  The  absence  of  professional  procurement \nmanagers in implementing agencies, fragmentation of procurement responsibility, and weak \nprocurement capacity are the most important impediments. LKPP should focus its resources on \ndeveloping a human resources strategy that can tackle the challenges in this area. The capacity \nof Government auditing agencies to carry out procurement audits must be strengthened. Another \nimportant goal should be to develop a set of performance indicators to monitor procurement \nperformance within implementing agencies.  \n \n31.  Corruption, sanctions, and independent appeals mechanism. Key reforms that would \nimprove the transparency of the procurement system include establishment of an independent \ncomplaints mechanism, establishment of an effective sanctions mechanism, and implementation \nof e-procurement.  \n \n32.  Presidential  Decree  80/2003  requires  the  establishment  of  a  complaint-handling \nmechanism. However, this is not set up independently but within each implementing agency. \nLKPP  is  now  in  the  process  of  finalizing its strategy  for  complaint  handling.  It  is  currently \nweighing different modalities for managing complaint handling and the role of LKPP. While it is \nimperative to develop procedures for an independent complaint-handling mechanism, LKPP \n ", "Appendix 8  63 \nshould avoid becoming the agency to which these complaints are addressed, but rather develop \na system and monitor its efficiency and reliability.  \n \n33.  The  sanctions  mechanism  is  operated  by  each  implementing  agency  according  to \nPresidential  Decree  80/2003  requirements.  The  effectiveness  of  this  system  is  unclear;  an \nassessment of the mechanism, to be conducted by LKPP, is therefore warranted.  \n \n34.  E-procurement. The LKPP is currently taking the lead on behalf of the Government for \nimplementing e-government procurement in Indonesia at the national and subnational levels. \nThe Ministry of Public Works, Ministry of Communications and Information, and City of Surabaya \nare at the forefront of the drive to develop e-government procurement technology. The critical \nissue now is developing a road map for expanding e-government procurement in the country. \nThe road map should establish roles for different stakeholders to define core data standards for \nthe various e-government procurement providers to comply with. \n \n5.  Improving Government Accounting and Audit Functions  \n \n35.  Accounting  and  reporting  on  budget  execution.  Even  though  the  aggregate \nGovernment annual financial statements have been prepared in a timely manner since 2004, \nthey continue to receive a \u201cdisclaimer\u201d audit opinion from external auditors. One of the reasons \ncited  for  the  \u201cdisclaimer\u201d  opinion  is  weak  internal  control  in  the  preparation  of  financial \nstatements. Improving the quality of financial statements is thus an important priority for the \nGovernment. \n \n36.  Capacity constraints in the line ministries are the biggest challenge to improve financial \nstatements. Line ministries and subnational governments have few trained accountants and the \nquality of their work needs improvement. The Directorate General for Treasury has an ambitious \ntraining program in place that aims to train at least one person for each of the country\u2019s 22,000 or \nso satkers (spending units) by 2010. About 9,000 people have been trained so far, and the \nremaining  officials  are expected  to  be  trained  by  2010.  However,  this  is  only  a  short-term \nsolution; in the long term, sustained and continuous training of line ministry staff is needed. The \nEducation  and  Training  Unit  within  MOF  is  considering  a  plan  for  working  with  regional \nuniversities to institute  a long-term program for training accountants. However, the plans are at \nan early stage at this point.  \n \n37.  A plan is in place to move from cash-based accounting to full accrual accounting for line \nministries  and  subnational  governments  by  2014.  The  accounting  standards  for  accrual \naccounting have already been drafted and are currently undergoing a review.  \n \n38.  Internal  controls  and  internal  audit.  The  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial \nAccountability assessment of 2008 identifies weaknesses in internal controls as a significant risk \nto  reforms  introduced  in  other  areas  of  PFM.  The  internal  audit  function  in  the  country  is \nclassified as fragmented and characterized by weak capacity.  \n \n39.  The key reform priorities in the area of internal control and internal audit are (i) rollout of \nSPAN; (ii) implementation of Committee of Sponsoring Organization (COSO)6 framework; and \n(iii) strengthening of internal audit function of the Government.  \n                                                 \n6  The  COSO  framework  was  developed  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organization  of  the  Treadway \nCommission\u2014a nonprofit entity established in 1992, which established a common definition of internal control and a \nframework for evaluating its effectiveness. \n ", "64   Appendix 8 \n40.  The rollout of SPAN, targeted for 2011, will strengthen internal controls by introducing a \nformal commitment control system in the line ministries, ensuring adherence to the budget \nceilings and reducing time lags in processing payments and budget revisions. Limited capacity in \nMOF and other line ministries and ownership of the program are key challenges.  \n \n41.  Through Government Regulation (PP) 60/2008, the Government has adopted COSO as \nits internal control framework. However, implementing the regulation has proved challenging. \nThe Government regulation entrusts the Financial and Development Supervisory Board (BPKP) \nwith designing the internal control implementation, as well as with providing guidance to and \ntraining the line ministries on COSO. In June 2009, BPKP and MOF organized COSO workshops \nto help managers and auditors gain a better understanding of the concepts and implementation \nexperiences related to COSO. BPKP is in the process of preparing an ambitious strategic plan \nfor COSO implementation, which may start through some pilots. Limited capacity at BPKP in \nimplementing major reforms and limited interest from the management of line ministries remain \nsignificant challenges. As part of its implementation strategy, BPKP is seeking the support of \nexpert staff to meet these challenges. However, implementation of COSO is currently only at the \nplanning stage; implementation on a pilot basis may begin in 2010.  \n \n42.  PP 60/2008 also gives BPKP a mandate to strengthen the internal audit function in the \ncountry, which is currently fragmented and suffers from a serious lack of capacity. The quality of \naudit by inspector generals in line ministries and regional supervision agencies (Bawasdas) in \nlocal governments remains suboptimal, with little focus on risk-based auditing. A peer review of \nBPKP in 2008 concluded that even though BPKP follows international standards of auditing, \nweaknesses exist in practice. BPKP has drawn up an action plan to address those weaknesses. \nA lack of trained and skilled auditors and the sheer size of the country (Bawasda auditors are in \nmore  than  500  locations)  make  the  task  of  reforming  the  internal  audit  function  especially \nchallenging.  \n \n43.  External audit. The Supreme Audit Agency (BPK) has a mandate to audit all government \nentities, including state-owned enterprises, and has grown considerably since 2004 in terms of \nits budget, the number of regional offices, and the number of auditors it employs.7 The main \npriority at this point is technical capacity building of BPK staff. ADB has been supporting BPK \nthrough its State Audit Reform Project. \n \n44.  BPK  performs  financial,  performance,  and  special-purpose  audits.  The  audits  are \nundertaken  in  accordance  with  BPK  auditing  standards,  which  are  generally  in  line  with \ninternational auditing standards. The agency has an arrangement with National Audit Office \n(NAO) Australia on technical skills transfer in performance auditing, and has benefited from  \ntraining programs and from a staff exchange program with NAO.  \n \n45.  BPK has managed to submit audited financial statements within 5 months of the end of \nthe fiscal year for the past 5 years. It also submits interim audit reports to the Parliament every 6 \nmonths.  \n \n46.  BPK is currently undergoing a peer review with the Dutch Supreme Audit Agency. The \nreview is expected to identify critical areas for the development of the institution. BPK expects to \ndraw up a comprehensive institutional development plan based on the results of the peer review, \nwhich will be available in late 2009.  \n                                                 \n7  The number of BPK staff has risen from 2,854 in 2004 to 4,382 in 2008. The annual budget for 2009 is Rp1.7 trillion, \ncompared with Rp234 billion in 2004. The number of regional offices has risen from 7 in 2004 to 33 in 2009. \n ", "Appendix 8  65 \n6.  Reforming Regional Public Financial Management \n \n47.  Decentralization has provided subnational governments with significant resources and \nresponsibilities.  More  than  one-third  of  public  spending  is  now  executed  by  subnational \ngovernments. This level of expenditure requires an adequate regulatory framework, together with \nsufficient PFM capacity, at the subnational level if it is to be fully effective. To address this need, \nin  2005  the  central  Government  passed  comprehensive  legislation  on  PFM  reform  at  the \nsubnational level, with the aim of mirroring reforms already being implemented at the national \nlevel. However, most regions lack the technical and human resource capacity to implement the \nreforms. For example, subnational governments are obliged by law to report certain fiscal and \nfinancial  information  to  the  central  Government  within  a  clear  time  frame.  In  reality,  many \nsubnational governments struggle to meet their deadlines for submission. \n \n48.  Current budget allocation and disbursement practices contribute to fiscal discipline at the \ncentral level but constrain successful financial management at the local level. Allocations to \nindividual  subnational  governments  are  formally  issued  after  the  passage  of  the  central \nGovernment  budget  in  October  for  the  following  year,  and  commence  through  derivative \nregulations  (e.g.,  ministerial  decrees).  While  this  may  appear  to  allow  sufficient  time  for \nsubnational governments to finalize their budgets, in reality budget allocations of shared, non-tax \nrevenue (oil and gas) are frequently issued in the first few months of the fiscal year. The \nallocations are frequently underestimated by the central Government and disbursements from \nthe center to the regions are back-loaded toward the end of the fiscal year. This is because the \ntransfers  in  the  final  quarter  are  based  on  actual  revenues,  which are  usually  higher  than \nprojected revenues. \n \n49.  Subnational governments are struggling to spend their increased budgets and have built \nup  reserves  in  recent  years  for  three  main  reasons.  First,  they  often  underestimate  their \nrevenues because they lack revenue management capacity. This is compounded by the Central \nGovernment\u2019s under-budgeting of transfers. Second, delays in the budget approval process and \nlack of implementation capacity result in under-spending of budgeted programs by subnational \ngovernments. Third, subnational governments may not have the capacity to spend the resources \nat their disposal when these resources increase significantly and abruptly. This was the case \nwith the 64% increase in \"general allocation funds\" from 2005 to 2006, which led to a significant \nincrease in subnational government reserves. \n \n50.  Some challenges in addressing PFM constraints at the subnational level include: (i) \nproviding timely estimates from the sectoral ministries of revenue-sharing transfers; (ii) building \nthe capacity of subnational governments to manage accumulated reserves; and (iii) improving \nand streamlining the budget approval process. The need to streamline the budget approval \nprocess  in  particular  affects  Law  No.  33/2004,  which  stipulates  that  provincial  and  district \nbudgets must be approved by the Ministry of Home Affairs and the provincial government. This \nprocess may be one factor that lengthens the budget approval process. \n \n51.  To address the financial management issues and challenges at the subnational level, the \ncentral Government has implemented several reforms: \n \n52.  \u201cBurden-sharing policy.\u201d Introduced in 2009, this policy incorporates major subsidies, \nincluding fuel subsidies, into the \"general allocation funds\". The policy will increase the accuracy \nof transfer projections during the full fiscal year, given that there is a disincentive for the central \nGovernment  to  underestimate  the  oil  price  assumption,  especially  in  relation  to  regional \n ", "66   Appendix 8 \ntransfers. A more rational oil price assumption will lead to better estimates of revenue sharing, \nwhich in turn will help subnational governments better plan their budgets.  \n \n53.  Two actions are needed to optimize this policy. First, the central Government should \nestablish a system to regularly monitor quarterly revenue-sharing transfers, as stipulated in Law \nNo. 33/2004. Second, the central Government, through the relevant agencies, needs to improve \nproduction estimates for revenue sharing, especially if back-loaded transfers at the end of the \nfiscal year persist.  \n \n54.  Late budget approval sanctions. Since 2008 the Government has applied sanctions to \nimprove the budget approval process. Based on Government Regulation (PP) No. 56/2005 and \nMOF Decree No. 46/2006 regarding the regional financial information system, provincial and \ndistrict governments have to submit their annual budgets to MOF before 31 January of the fiscal \nyear. Subnational governments that miss the deadline by at least 1 month will receive a warning \nletter to submit their budget before 31 March. If a subnational government has not submitted its \nbudget by that date, MOF, in coordination with the Ministry of Home Affairs, can sanction the \nsubnational government by postponing the transfer of its \"general allocation funds\" (25% of \nmonthly transfers) until the budget is submitted. This initiative has resulted in more timely budget \nsubmissions. Between 2006 and 2007, 54% of subnational governments approved their budgets \nafter March. In 2008, the year the sanction was introduced, 87% of subnational governments \nsubmitted their budgets to MOF before March.  \n \n55.  MOF can also assist subnational governments in managing reserves and surpluses by \nstrengthening the regulatory framework for subnational financial management. In doing so, MOF \nshould develop guidelines for regions on accumulating and using reserves. These guidelines \nshould help subnational governments use their reserves more effectively, for example, by (i) \nsettling outstanding arrears, given that about 85% of subnational governments in arrears could \nclear  these  arrears  by  drawing  on  reserves;  and  (ii)  where  subnational  governments  have \nconstant or increasingly high levels of reserves, using them to increase investment in public \ninfrastructure.  \n \n7.  Governance and Anticorruption \n \n56.  Public confidence in the Government\u2019s efforts to combat corruption has been slowly \nrestored over the past few years, as reflected in a number of opinion polls and corruption \nperception surveys. The Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) continues to take the lead in \ninvestigating and prosecuting high-profile corruption cases. At an unprecedented level, politicians \nand  high-ranking  government  officials  are  under  investigation  or  have  been  convicted  of \ncorruption, including members of Parliament, the former national police chief, former governors \nand officials of the central bank, and heads of local government. Even after the recent arrest for \nmurder of the chair of the commission, the KPK has been proving its effectiveness as an \nindependent  law  enforcement  agency.  The  Attorney  General\u2019s  Office  has  also  created  an \nanticorruption task force to more effectively investigate and prosecute corruption.  \n \n57.  Apart from stronger enforcement of anticorruption laws, civil service reform and judicial \nreform are the linchpins of the Government\u2019s strategy to combat corruption. The Government \nplans to expand ongoing civil service reform efforts to other agencies under the leadership of the \nMinistry  of  State  Apparatus  Reform.  While  the  ministry  still  lacks  the  capability  to  monitor, \nevaluate,  and  drive  bureaucracy  reform,  government  agencies  are  undertaking  significant \nreforms. The Supreme Court, in particular, has undergone significant restructuring, and as a \n ", "Appendix 8  67 \nresult the quality of its decisions has improved. The majority of Supreme Court decisions have \nreinforced a strong stance against corruption. \n \nC.  Key Areas for Future Attention \n \n58.  In the period ahead, progress on the following key ongoing PFM reforms will need to be \nclosely monitored: \n(i)  Ensuring coherence and momentum in PFM reform.  \n(ii)  Deepening  the  reforms  of  central  Government  budgetary  systems  to  ensure \nresults-orientation in budget formulation and execution. \n(iii)  Ensuring greater integrity and more effective management of public funds by \nimplementing a TSA, automating the treasury payments system, and instituting \nmeasures to prevent the proliferation of off-budget bank accounts. \n(iv)  Implementing a new budget and treasury system, extending implementation of \ngovernment  accounting  standards,  and  reengineering  underlying  business \nprocesses  at  spending  agencies  to  ensure  relevant  and  reliable  financial \nreporting. \n(v)  Extending  modern  financial  accountability  and  management  processes  to \nsubnational governments in a coordinated manner, and bringing these fully in line \nwith emerging national standards.  \n(vi)  Improving the monitoring and evaluation capacity of BAPPENAS by expanding \nexpenditure analysis at the sector level and developing a deeper understanding of \nspending at the sector level. \n(vii)  Creating a road map for the development of e-government procurement in the \ncountry, defining the roles of the different stakeholders and ensuring minimum \ninteroperability  and  core  data  standards  for  the  various  e-government \nprocurement providers to comply with.  \n(viii)  Designing  a  human  resources  strategy  to  tackle  challenges  in  procurement \nreform, such as instituting a permanent procurement management function in line \nministries and agencies, developing a sustainable capacity-building program, and \nsupporting training institutions in universities and the private sector.  \n(ix)  Continuing  to  improve  human  resource  capacity  in  the  area  of  government \naccounting and reporting.  \n(x)  Preparing a strategic plan for COSO implementation, which may start through \nsome pilots.   \n(xi)  Strengthening the internal audit function in the country by modernizing internal \naudit  institutions,  providing  intensive  training  to  internal  audit  staff,  and \nestablishing synergistic relationships between the BPKP, inspector generals, and \nBawasdas. \n(xii)  Continued strengthening of BPK through technical assistance.  \n(xiii)  Improving  the  management  of  reserves  and  surpluses  by  strengthening  the \nregulatory framework for subnational governments' financial management.  \n(xiv)  Continuing  to  monitor  subnational  governments'  budget  submissions  and  the \nimplementation of sanctions for late performers. \n(xv)  Expediting the process of budget approval by streamlining Law No. 33/2004, \nwhich currently requires the Ministry of Home Affairs to approve provincial and \ndistrict budgets.  \n(xvi)  Promulgating  a  law  on  the  special  powers  of  KPK,  the  powers  of  the \nanticorruption court, and the role of non-career or ad hoc judges.  \n \n ", "68   Appendix 8 \n59.  The Government is actively considering and/or prioritizing many of these reforms. The \ncapacity to centrally monitor these and other reforms has recently been established at the \nsecretary general\u2019s office of MOF. Indonesia would benefit from a coherent reform plan or \nstrategy to ensure proper phasing and coordination of PFM reforms. This would also allow for \nenhanced  monitoring  and  accountability  within  the  Government  and  thus  provide  additional \nmomentum and direction to reform efforts. \n \nD.  Management of Foreign Exchange \n \n60.  The foreign exchange control environment is assessed to be generally satisfactory. The \ncountry  graduated  from  the  IMF  program  in  2003.  Bank  Indonesia  was  last subject  to  the \ntransitional procedures under the IMF's safeguards assessment policy in 2002. That assessment \nrecommended remedial action to address several vulnerabilities in the audit arrangements of \nBank  Indonesia.  The  main  recommendations  have  been  implemented,  including  the \nestablishment of an independent audit committee at Bank Indonesia and the publication of Bank \nIndonesia\u2019s audited financial statements. Audited financial statements for Bank Indonesia for \n2008 have been reviewed and the audit report issued by the BPK contained an \"unqualified\" \nopinion. \n \nE.  Conclusion \n \n61.  Indonesia has established a sound legal and administrative framework for modern PFM. \nChanges in the legal and regulatory architecture are now largely complete and the momentum \nhas shifted toward implementation. \n \n62.  Known weaknesses in financial management and accountability continue to be gradually \naddressed through the PFM reform program discussed above. The development partners are \nactively engaged in this process. Key elements of the reforms are supported by the DPL/DPSP \ntriggers, as well as by other development partner programs. However, much remains to be done, \nand it will take time to realize the full impact of these reforms.  \n \n63.  Meanwhile,  some  fiduciary  risks  will  arise  for  this  operation.  Although  the  pace  of \nimplementing the planned reforms has been somewhat slow, the trajectory of reform is in the \nright direction and the Government continues to demonstrate a commitment to complete the \nplanned  PFM  reforms.  Taking  this  into  consideration,  the  DPL/DPSP  series\u2019  development \npartners do not propose putting in place any additional fiduciary arrangements for this operation. \n ", "Appendix 9  69 \n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \nCountry/Project Title: Indonesia: Fifth Development Policy Support Program (DPSP-5) \n \nLending/Financing  Department/  Southeast Asia Department (SERD) \nPolicy-Based \nModality:  Division:  Indonesia Resident Mission (IRM) \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nBefore the Asian financial crisis, Indonesia had been successful in fighting poverty. The poverty rate\u2014the proportion of \nthe population living below $1/day\u2014was reduced from 44% (1976) to 11% (1996). However, the economic crisis in \n1997 increased the poverty rate to 23.6% in 1998. With successful macroeconomic management following the crisis, \npoverty incidence steadily declined to 15.4% by 2008. Although the decline of the $1/day poverty rate is considered \nremarkable, close to half of the population still lives below the $2/day international poverty line (2008). Disparities \nacross regions are striking, as provinces in outlying regions have poverty rates that are well above the national \naverage.  \n \n \nThe Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJM) for 2005\u20132009 focuses on poverty reduction and the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). Its priority areas include (i) job creation and poverty reduction programs; \n(ii) macroeconomic stability with stable prices, fiscal sustainability, and financial sector reforms; (iii) accelerating \ninvestments, exports, and tourism through reforms for a healthy business climate and flexible markets; (iv) improved \naccess to and quality of education and health; and (v) infrastructure development by improving the efficiency in \ndelivering existing services and by greater private sector participation. \n \nIn August 2006, the Government launched the National Program for Community Empowerment (PNPM Mandiri), which \nbuilds upon Indonesia\u2019s accumulated experience with community-driven development (CDD) programs. The PNPM \naims  to  reduce  poverty  by  (i)  promoting  community  participation  in  development  planning  and  management, \n(ii) delivering basic services and infrastructure using the CDD approach, and (iii) committing to expand coverage of the \nprogram to all kecamatans (6,627) by 2010. DPSP-5 is in line with ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program for Indonesia \nfor the period 2006\u20132009, which aims to help the government achieve its medium-term RPJM objectives of higher \nlevels of pro-poor sustainable growth and achieving the MDGs. \n  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1. Key Issues  \n \nIndonesia\u2019s poverty reduction strategy paper identified four major causes of poverty, including (i) lack of access to key \nsocial services; (ii) absence of economic opportunities, particularly in rural areas; (iii) poor infrastructure in villages; and \n(iv) inadequate access to markets. In addition, weak governance hampers further progress in addressing these major \ncauses of poverty. The National Poverty Reduction Strategy considers macroeconomic stability as the foundation for \nreducing poverty and includes five basic strategies for poverty reduction: (i) broadening income-earning opportunities, \n(ii) empowering community institutions, (iii) increasing capacity at the local levels, (iv) providing social protection, and \n(v) promoting global partnerships. \n  \n2. Design Features. Not applicable \nC. Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \nDPSP-5 aims to contribute to higher pro-poor economic growth that is sustained over the medium term through three \ncore policy areas: (i) improved investment climate, (ii) improved public financial management and governance, and \n(iii) enhanced efforts to alleviate poverty. \n \nThe majority of triggers under the first two core policy areas will not directly affect the income level of poor households. \nHowever, it is expected that improving the investment climate and public financial management and governance in \ngeneral will contribute to improved business opportunities in the informal sector, which employs about two-thirds of the \nlabor force and provides the most important income earning prospects for the poor.  \n \nThe third policy area aims to strengthen poverty targeting in determining the size of community block grants to \nsubdistricts under the PNPM program, and to increase the average size of the block grant for the poorest subdistricts. \nImproving the poverty targeting of the PNPM block grants will have unambiguously beneficial effects on the poor\u2014\nparticularly on poor living in isolated villages in less-developed districts that lack basic services and infrastructure. \nAdditional support to improve basic infrastructure in villages that have higher-than-average poverty levels will help \n ", "70  Appendix 9 \nincrease the availability and accessibility of education and health services and improve income earning opportunities. \nCommunity investments under PNPM are expected to (i) reduce the time and costs spent on obtaining good quality \nwater, (ii) diminish the incidence and severity of waterborne diseases, (iii) increase the availability and accessibility of \neducation and health services for the rural poor and near poor, (iv) improve access to services and markets, and (v) \nprovide income earning opportunities and welfare through increased employment and trade. Support to build capacity \nof local administrations and communities to plan, implement, and manage infrastructure investments will promote good \ngovernance at the local level. More efficient and equitable provision of services to the poorest villages will contribute to \nhealth- and education-related MDGs. \n  \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nAs discussed above, the reforms under the first two core policy areas will have only indirect impacts on the welfare of \npoor  people.  Improving  poverty  targeting  of  the  PNPM  program  and  increasing  the  size  of  block  grants  for \ninfrastructure  investments  in  the  poorest  subdistricts  will  contribute  to  improved  living  conditions  of  the  poor. \nInfrastructure investments in poor rural areas will improve access to social services and accelerate social development. \n \nBetter targeting of PNPM support to improve basic infrastructure in poor villages will contribute to addressing the major \ncauses of poverty as identified in the National Poverty Reduction Strategy paper, including (i) lack of access to key \nsocial services, (iii) poor infrastructure in villages, and (iv) inadequate links to markets. Indonesia\u2019s infrastructure \nprovision in poor rural areas is weak by regional standards. Electrification rates are the lowest in the region, while road \nnetworks are limited and in poor condition. People living in isolated areas with poor market links lack both economic \nopportunities and adequate levels of service delivery. More than 15% of all Indonesian villages are inaccessible all year \nround. Lack of access to quality education significantly decreases productivity, employment opportunities, and personal \nincome. Investments in transportation infrastructure, agricultural infrastructure (irrigation), and education and health \nfacilities can significantly improve living conditions in remote areas, create the basis for economic growth, and improve \nthe welfare of the local population. The positive effect of infrastructure investments on rural welfare has been \nempirically demonstrated; surveys have revealed that there\u2019s a significant correlation between the presence of good \nroads and a community\u2019s mean level of income.a  \n \nApproximately 60% of the population lives in rural areas where agriculture is the main source of livelihood. One reason \nfor low incomes in the agriculture sector is that \u201cfarm gate prices\u201d are very low compared with urban prices for the \nsame goods of the same quality. This is due to high transport costs for rural marketable surpluses over poor quality \nroads. Transport costs are even higher for non-motor-vehicle transport methods in areas where roads are absent. In a \nrapid assessment of causes of poverty in five of Indonesia\u2019s districts, villagers in isolated areas identified high transport \ncosts as a major cause of poverty. New roads in previously unserved agricultural areas can significantly lower \ntransaction costs and hence raise farm gate prices, which will mean higher incomes for people in the agriculture sector, \nthe poorest group of the population.  \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n  \nDuring  preparation,  regular  consultations  were  held  with  key  stakeholders  (government  officials,  NGOs  and \ndevelopment partners). During implementation, the program will maintain broad stakeholder participation to discuss \nand  review  reform  efforts.  The  Government\u2019s  National  Community  Empowerment  Program  (PNPM)  supports \ncommunity empowerment and strengthens local capacity and governance to implement infrastructure investments. \nThe Government has engaged extensively with civil society on tax and investment law reforms. The entire set of \nDPSP-5 policy actions will likely feature in discussions with Parliament.  \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n \n   Information sharing   Consultation   Collaborative decision making   Empowerment \n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes   No  \n \n  \nC. Gender and Development \n1. Key Issues.  \n \nThe  country  gender  assessment  identified  four  key  themes  through  a  consultative  process:  (i)  the  impact  of \ndecentralization on gender, (ii) women\u2019s inadequate representation in political decision\\ making, (iii) violence against \nwomen, and (iv) women and international migration. While Indonesia has made progress over the years, gender \ninequalities persist. Indonesia was ranked 111 out of 182 economies in the United Nation's human development index \nin 2007 and 93 out of 155 in the gender development index. In 2007, women\u2019s labor force participation was 40%, \ncompared with 80% for men. The shift to regional autonomy under the decentralization law has already shown potential \n ", "Appendix 9  71 \nfor increased participation of women in local governance.  \n \n2.  Key Actions.  \n \nDrawing a comprehensive conclusion on issues related to gender and income poverty in Indonesia is difficult, as \nconsistent, disaggregated data by sex is not available. DPSP-5 will create indirect gender impacts. Improved poverty \ntargeting of public spending will increase women\u2019s access to essential services for achieving MDG targets, including \nreducing child and maternal mortality. Improvement of financial management systems and governance, through \nincreased transparency and accountability at all levels, will provide civil society with the basic information necessary to \nmonitor government actions and empower men and women in communities to participate in policy and budget \ndecisions. To the extent that policies under DPSP increase credit to micro, small, and medium enterprises, the program \nwould have an indirect beneficial impact on women considering their predominant role in microenterprises. \n \nThe community-driven development approach used by the Government's PNPM program will ensure that perspectives of \nboth men and women are represented in planning, designing, and implementing village infrastructure investments. The \ncommunity implementation organizations\u2019 executive committees will include at least two women, and at least 40% of the \ntotal membership will be women.
