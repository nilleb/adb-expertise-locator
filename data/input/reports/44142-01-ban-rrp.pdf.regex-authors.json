I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People's  Republic  of Bangladesh for  the  Subregional Transport  Project  Preparatory \nFacility. \n \n2.  The proposed technical assistance loan will provide the facility to prepare a series of \nregional cooperation and integration (RCI) transport projects in roads and railways. The loan will \nensure the projects are ready for implementation by providing funding for feasibility studies, \ndetailed design preparation, procurement assistance, and safeguard implementation. The focus \nwill be on priority transport corridors identified in the South Asian Association for Regional \nCooperation (SAARC) Regional Multimodal Transport Study.1 Transport corridors linking with \nthe Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) \ncountries2 \u2014such as the Asian Highway Network and the Trans-Asia Rail Network\u2014will also be \ntargeted. While the facility will cover 8% of Bangladesh's major roads and 12% of its railways, \ndevelopment of these corridors would complete the subregional land transport network, which \nwill stimulate both subregional trade and the Bangladesh economy.  \n \nII.   THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Although South Asia has been one of the fastest-growing economic regions in the world, \nintraregional trade accounts for only about 5% of total trade in the region. By comparison, \nintraregional trade accounts for 26% of total trade in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN), 52% of total trade in North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) countries, and \n58% of total trade in the European Union. The South Asian Free Trade Area is slowly getting \nimplemented while bilateral free trade agreements have also been demonstrating encouraging \nincrease  to  trade  volumes.  However,  investment  in  the  region  needs  to  be  accelerated, \nparticularly in less-developed areas such as Bangladesh. \n \n4.  Countries with well-developed and integrated transport and communications systems \ntend to attract more foreign direct investment. Integrated transport systems improve access to \nsubregional markets, making structural changes in their production capacities that can expand \nand diversify the basket of goods available for export. This is essential to transforming the \nfortunes of the smaller economies of South Asia. \n \n5.  Bangladesh has the potential to become a transport and transshipment center for the \nsubregion. It borders India and Myanmar and is geographically close to Bhutan, Nepal, and \nKunming\u2014the key transportation hub in southwest People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). With the \nopening of the Bhangabandhu Bridge over the Jamuna River (the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge) \nand the proposed development of the Padma Bridge, the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong transport corridor \nand  other  strategic  transport  corridors  can  facilitate  trade  between  Bangladesh  and  the \nnortheastern states of India, the Indian state of West Bengal, Bhutan, and Nepal, thereby \nattracting more foreign and domestic investment to the country. \n \n                                                \n1  SAARC  Secretariat.  2007.  Regional  Multimodal  Transport  Study.  Kathmandu  (prepared  under  ADB.  2004. \nTechnical Assistance for Promoting South Asian Regional Economic Cooperation. Manila [TA 6187-REG]). \n2  Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand ", "2 \n6.  While overall trade in Bangladesh has increased since economic liberalization in 1980\u2019s \nand its acceleration in 1990\u2019s, exports to East Asia (6.8%) and South Asia (1.6%) continue to \naccount for a small share of overall trade. A 2008 Asian Development Bank (ADB) study3 \nidentified weak trade-related infrastructure and poor connectivity are one of the more serious \nimpediments to expansion of trade and investment among countries, in addition to a narrow \nexport base and few complementarities with other countries in the region. Another study\u2014the \nBIMSTEC Transport Infrastructure and Logistics Study4\u2014determined that improved transport \ninfrastructure and improved access to modern transport systems are the keys to enhancing RCI \nin Bangladesh. \n \n7.  Because of its location, Bangladesh plays a key role in RCI. The SAARC Regional \nMultimodal Transport Study identified priority corridors among SAARC countries. Six out of 10 \npriority  road  corridors  and  two  out  of  five  priority  rail  corridors  go  through  Bangladesh. \nBangladesh also has two of the priority ports (Chittagong and Mongla) providing international \ngateways  for  international  trade.  Bangladesh  requires  massive  investment  to  improve \ninfrastructure along these priority corridors. Such investment would not only contribute to the \ndevelopment of Bangladesh's own economy, but would also contribute heavily to increasing \nsubregional trade. \n \n8.  The proposed technical assistance loan would focus the country\u2019s transport investment \neffectively on these subregional transport infrastructure projects that will have national as well \nas subregional economic impacts. To promote RCI, these subregional transport infrastructure \nprojects need to be ready for implementation. The proposed loan will immediately support \ngovernment initiatives to develop subregional projects in the wake of recent summits with India \nand the People's Republic of China. Indicative follow-on RCI loans in transport are already \nenvisioned in the ADB\u2019s South Asia regional cooperation strategy,5 which is in line with priorities \noutlined in the SAARC Regional Multimodal Transport Study and the Transport Infrastructure \nand Logistics Study undertaken by BIMSTEC. \n \n9.  The proposed facility will also address two key problems related to ADB's involvement in \ntransport infrastructure that were mentioned in the country assistance program evaluation for \nBangladesh6 in October 2009: (i) land acquisition and procurement delays, and (ii) start-up \ndelays. These problems were caused by the project design where detailed design, usually \nfinanced by the loan itself, starts long after loan approval). One of the major recommendations \nof the country assistance program evaluation was to reduce start-up delays by ensuring that \ntransport projects are ready for implementation shortly after loan approval. \n \n10.  A summary of the transport sector in Bangladesh is in Appendix 2.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact of the facility will be to increase subregional trade among South Asian \ncountries, especially from, to, and through Bangladesh. The outcome of the facility will be to \nimprove implementation efficiency of RCI land transport projects and promote investments to \nRCI projects by other development partners and the government. \n \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2009.

For the selected RCI road subprojects, \nthe facility will provide: (i) a feasibility study, if required, and detailed design; (ii) safeguard \nimplementation and procurement support, and (iii) capacity development support to the Roads \nand Highways Department (RHD) to enhance RHD operational efficiency and governance. The \nRCI road subprojects selected for preparation under this component of the facility shall target \npriority roads that have substantial RCI impacts, including SAARC road corridors identified in \nthe SAARC Regional Multimodal Transport Study and Asian Highways network.7 Although most \nsubprojects  shall  be  those  already  identified,  should  any  replacement  or  supplemental \nsubprojects be proposed for inclusion after Board approval, these may be considered if they \nsatisfy  agreed  criteria,  including  in  particular  the  requirement  that  they  have  substantial \nsubregional implications.8  In principle, all roads will be designed as four-lane, but the final \ndesign will depend on the feasibility study, taking into account engineering, economic, social, \nand environmental viability. Consultants will also explore possible private\u2013public partnerships \nfor financially viable subprojects. Capacity development support will improve the RHD's internal \ncontrol mechanisms, asset management systems, business procedures, and human resource \nmanagement. The facility aims to prepare at least 300 km for tendering in 2012, and an overall \napproximate length of 1,700 km by end of 2013. \n \n13.  Bangladesh Railway component. For selected RCI railway subprojects, the facility will \nprovide: (i) a feasibility study, if required, and detailed design; and (ii) support for safeguard \nimplementation and procurement. The RCI railway subprojects selected for preparation under \nthis component of the facility shall target priority railways (footnote 7) that have substantial RCI \nimpacts,  including  railways  along  SAARC  rail  corridors  identified  in  the  SAARC  Regional \nMultimodal Transport Study and Trans-Asian Railways network. Although most subprojects \nshall  be  those  already  identified,  should  any  replacement  or  supplemental  subprojects  be \nproposed for inclusion after Board approval, these may be considered if they satisfy agreed \ncriteria,  including  in  particular  the  requirement  that  they  have  substantial  subregional \nimplications. (footnote 8). The final design will depend on the feasibility study, which will take \ninto account engineering, economic, social, and environmental viability. The facility aims to \nprepare at least one project, or minimum 85 km, for tendering by the end of 2012, based on the \nfollowing studies: (i) feasibility study and detailed design for two railway line constructions, (ii) \ndetailed  design for  one  railway  line  construction,  and  (iii) feasibility  study  for  three railway \nbridges and one signaling project. \n \n14.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  to  prepare  feasibility  studies  and  detailed  design  for \nselected subprojects, as well as provide assistance with procurement. Safeguard consultants in \nthe fields of resettlement, social aspects, and environment will also be engaged to (i) provide \nsupport  on  safeguards  planning,  implementation,  and  capacity  development;  (ii)  facilitate \neffective  coordination  among  relevant  stakeholders;  and  (iii)  monitor  implementation  of \nsafeguard plans. Capacity development consultants will be engaged to work with RHD staff to \nupdate and utilize the financial management systems and asset management systems.9  \n \n                                                \n7  List of Priority Subregional Road Projects (Appendix 2). \n8  Selection Criteria for Studies Under the Facility (Appendix 2). \n9  For the railway subsector, ADB provides support to capacity development under the ongoing loan (ADB. 2006. \nProposed Multitranche Financing Facility and Technical Assistance Grant to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh \nfor the Railway Sector Investment Program [Loan 2317-BAN]) and attached technical assistance (Institutional \nSupport for Railway Reforms [TA 4847-BAN]). \n ", "4 \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n15.  The facility is projected to cost $27.59 million, including taxes and duties, physical and \nprice  contingencies,  and  interest  and  other  charges  during  implementation  (Table  1).

The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR14,917,000  ($23  million  equivalent) from ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  inclusive  of \n$12.00 million equivalent from the subregional pool of the ADF, to help finance the facility. The \nloan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and \nconditions as are set forth in the draft loan agreement. The government will provide $4.59 \nmillion for local taxes and duties, and project administration. The ADB and the Government will \nfinance 83.36% and 16.64% of total investment cost, respectively.

To avoid start-up delays, the government has requested that ADB carry out consultant \nselection on its behalf. The government will retain its authority for contract negotiation and \ncontract signing. The recent summit agreement between Bangladesh and India requires the \ngovernment to move forward on significant RCI projects. This is in line with ADB's long-term \nstrategy  to  promote  RCI.  To  further  accelerate  the  development  of  RCI  projects,  quality \nconsultants should be engaged in a timely manner.  \n \nIII.   DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic \n \n19.  The follow-on transport investments prepared under the proposed facility will support \nBangladesh's economic growth and reduce poverty by connecting major markets in the country \nand providing communities with access to economic and social services. It will also contribute to \nregional cooperation and integration by strengthening connectivity with neighboring countries \nand  increasing  trade  competitiveness  of  Bangladesh.  A  preliminary  study  on  transit  traffic \n ", "6 \nthrough  Bangladesh11 estimates  that  the  improvement  of  Bangladeshi  sections  of  priority \nsubregional transport corridors could facilitate the movement of about 18 million tons of freight \nin Bhutan, India, and Nepal.   \n \n20.  The proposed facility will combine support for project feasibility studies, detailed design, \nprocurement, and safeguard implementation, ensuring that (i) follow-on investment projects will \nbe implemented without delay, (ii) the positive impacts of follow-on investment projects will \nmaterialize  without  delay,  and  (iii)  the  government  will  minimize  commitment  and  interest \ncharges arising under follow-on loans. The facility will help the government ensure the economic \nand financial viability of transport corridor projects with subregional impacts, and will mitigate the \nsocial and environmental risks of any follow-on projects. \n \n21.  By  providing  detailed  design,  procurement,  and  safeguard  implementation  support \nimmediately after the feasibility study, the proposed facility will accelerate the commencement of \nphysical works of the follow-on loans by at least 1 year compared with projects processed under \nconventional schemes. Currently, project executing agencies in Bangladesh can start recruiting \nconsultants only after the project loans have been approved. By contrast, the proposed facility \nwill allow executing agencies to undertake detailed design immediately after completion of \nfeasibility studies. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n22.  Financial  management.  Both  the  RHD  and  Bangladesh  Railway  have  prior  and \nongoing experience with implementing ADB-funded projects, and have knowledge of project \nfinancial accounting methods and ADB disbursement procedures. For the proposed facility, one \naccountant will be included in each project implementation unit. The RHD and Bangladesh \nRailway have participated in workshops run by ADB consultants on good practice of financial \nmanagement systems. \n \n23.  The RHD and Bangladesh Railway will establish and maintain separate project records \nand  accounts  to  identify  the  finances  received  and  expenditures  made  under  the  facility, \nensuring  an  adequate  audit  trail.  The  accounts  will  be  set  up  in  accordance  with  sound \naccounting principles. Independent auditors, acceptable to ADB, will audit the accounts and \nrelated financial statements annually.  \n \n24.  Procurement  and  anticorruption. Recruitment of consultants will be carried out in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). ADB will select the consultants and the executing agencies will negotiate and contract \nwith the consultants thus selected (refer to para 18). This recruitment process will help to ensure \nthat consulting services are available in a timely manner. The procurement rules for selection of \ncontractors  required  by  international financial  institutions  such  as  the  ADB  are  considered \nsufficiently robust to deter corruption at the bid selection stage. National procurement regulation \nhas also improved recently through the Public Procurement Act, 2006, and through related \nPublic Procurement Rules (2008) with subsequent amendments. During implementation of the \nfacility,  reports  will  be  submitted  to  executing  agencies  and  ADB  in  line  with  submission \nmilestones to ensure the quality and timeliness of consultants' work. \n \n                                                \n11 ADB. Bangladesh: Preliminary Draft Report on Estimate of Gains from Developing Functional Corridors for Transit \nTraffic through Bangladesh. Unpublished. \n ", "7 \n25.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and executing agencies (the RHD and Bangladesh Railway). The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are set out in the project administration \nmanual (footnote 10). \n \nC.  Safeguards \n \n26.  The proposed facility will ensure development of environmentally and socially viable \ninvestment loans. Because the facility is focused on project preparation, it is not expected to \nhave any adverse social and environmental consequences. The safeguard categorization for \nthe facility is \u201cC\u201d for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples, respectively. \nFollow-on projects will be designed in accordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009) and government guidelines, regulations, and policies. During the feasibility studies, the \nconsultants  will  prepare  environmental  impact  assessments  or  initial  environmental \nexaminations,  as  applicable,  including  environmental  management  plans  for  the  selected \nsubprojects. Similarly, resettlement planning, indigenous peoples planning, and gender analysis \nwill be prepared for the selected subprojects during this stage. \n \nD.  Social \n \n27.  The facility is not expected to have any impacts on gender and social dimensions. \nFollow-on loans will be prepared in compliance with ADB's Handbook for Incorporation of Social \nDimensions in Projects and Handbook on Social Analysis.12 Gender, labor, HIV/AIDS, and other \nsocial risks related to follow-on loans will be assessed, and a mitigation plan will be prepared to \naddress those issues. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n28.  Major  risks  associated  with  implementing  the  facility  were  identified  and  practical \nmeasures were assessed as appropriate. To minimize delay in mobilization of consultants, \nselection will be undertaken by ADB on behalf of the government. Emphasis is put on quality in \nthe selection process and the contract is packaged in a large size to ensure engagement of \nquality consultants. For timely and quality report submission by consultants, executing agencies \nhave set up teams to review consultants' reports. Reports will also be submitted to ADB for \nreview  and  quality  check.  Strong  internal  control  is  ensured  in  financial  management  by \nadopting a direct payment procedure. Progress payment will be made in line with the payment \nschedule after quality check by executing agencies and ADB. \n \n29.  The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. Major risks and \nmitigating measures are summarized in the risk assessment and risk management plan.13 \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n30.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the facility shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the project \nadministration manual and loan documents. \n                                                \n12  ADB. 1994.
