The \nRectangular  Strategy;  National  Strategic  Development  Plan  (NSDP),  2006\u20132010;2 and  NSDP \nPlan Update, 2009\u20132013 are key government documents focusing on maintaining robust growth. \nThe Rectangular Strategy provides a medium-term development strategy that focuses on better \ngovernance and institution building, including anticorruption measures and public administration \nreforms. The NSDP aims to operationalize the Rectangular Strategy. The government adopted \nseveral  sector  strategies  to  implement  the  strategy  and  plan,  such  as  the  trade  sector-wide \napproach (SWAp), which underpins a diagnostic trade integration study. The trade SWAp aims \nto  expand  the  private  sector  by  improving  foreign  and  domestic  trade  and  developing  efficient \nbackward links in the economy.3 \n \n3. \nThe  policy  priorities  of  the  NSDP  update  intersect  closely  with  Strategy  2020  and  the \ncountry  partnership  strategy (CPS),  2011\u20132013 for  Cambodia  of the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB).4 The  overarching  objective  of  the  CPS  is  poverty  reduction  in  line  with  government \npriorities. The CPS aims to help reduce poverty and promote inclusive growth with an integrated \napproach to rural development, targeting the areas where most poor reside. With nearly 75% of \nthe population engaged in agriculture, the government sees economic diversification and private \nsector  development  as  two  ways  to  help  achieve  inclusive  growth,  i.e.,  reach  its  poverty \nreduction goal of more than 1% per annum and accomplish the NSDP update policy thrusts. \n \nThe NSDP, the NSDP update, and the trade SWAp have helped Cambodia improve its \n4. \ncompetitiveness.  According  to  the  global  competitive  index  produced  by  the  World  Economic \nForum, Cambodia\u2019s competitiveness rank improved from 109 in 2008 to 97 in 2012.  However, \nthe  economic  base  of  the  economy  remains  narrow;  in  2007,  three  subsectors\u2014garments, \nconstruction,  and tourist-related  services\u2014accounted for  up  to  42%  of gross domestic product \n(GDP). Garments contributed 16% of GDP in 2007 and 15% in 2008. Its share of total exports \nhas  been  more than  90%  since  2003.  During  2010\u20132011, garments  accounted for  76%  of the \nmanufacturing  sector.  During  the  same  period,  while  its  percentage  share  in  GDP,  the \ncontribution  to  export revenue  decreased  to  74%  of GDP. The  high  economic  dependence  on \ngarment exports makes the economy vulnerable to external shocks. Hence, a more diversified \neconomy  supported  by  vibrant  private  sector  development  is  needed  for  Cambodia  to  sustain \nhigh  economic  growth,  reduce  economic  volatility,  and  reduce  poverty.  This  requires  more \ndifficult  reforms  to  improve  competitiveness  throughout  the  supply  chain.  Value-chain  studies \nidentify constraints to export diversification as poor product quality, an inadequate sanitary and \nphytosanitary  standards  (SPS)  policy  framework,  limited  access  to  technology  and  business \ndevelopment  services,  underdeveloped  links  between  the  rural  and  modern  sectors  of  the \neconomy, and relatively costly logistics. \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of Cambodia. 2006.

The subprogram included a $2 million \nSPS  capacity  development  project  (footnote  4).  Subprogram  2,  which  is  financed  by  ADB \n(SDR6.565 million as a loan and $9 million as a grant), responded to policy challenges arising \nfrom the impact of the global financial crisis, such as the need for competition policy, regulatory \nefficiency,  and  innovation  to  promote  private  sector  competitiveness.  Similar  to subprogram  1, \nsubprogram  2  included  a  capacity  development  project  for  SPS  and  regulatory  impact \nassessment (RIA).7 \n \nIn implementing the program, ADB has closely coordinated with development partners, \n6. \nsuch  as  the  European  Commission,  the  International  Finance  Corporation,  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme,  the United Nations Industrial Development Organization,  the United \nStates  Agency  for  International  Development,  the  World  Bank,  and  the  World  Trade \nOrganization.  This  provides  holistic  support  for  private  sector  development  in  Cambodia \n(Appendix 3). \n \n7. \nSubprogram 3 is the last subprogram of the program cluster. It is built on progress made \nunder  subprograms  1  and  2  on  investment  climate,  trade  policy,  and  trade  facilitation. \nSubprogram  3  draws  on  best  international  practice  for  a  comprehensive trade  and  investment \nprogram. Activities include (i) establishment of an office of regulatory impact assessment (ORIA) \nto be responsible for regulatory review and thus decrease the regulatory burden for the private \nsector, (ii) capacity development assistance to address constraints of SPS service providers for \nsmall  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs),  (iii)  implementation  of  a  pilot  SPS  technology \nmatching  grants  component  that  aims  to  address  demand-side  issues  of  SMEs,  and  \n(iv) assistance for Cambodia\u2019s global and regional integration efforts via support for World Trade \nOrganization\u2019s trade policy review (TPR) on Cambodia and its participation in the Association of \nSoutheast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  regional  trade  agreements  and  ASEAN  commitments  to \ndevelop competition policy and law. \n \nSubprogram  3  incorporates  gender  considerations  in  its  policy  reforms.  This  is  in  line \n8. \nwith government recognition of the importance of women\u2019s entrepreneurship as a growth engine \nfor  the  economy.  In  2011,  Cambodia\u2019s  economic  survey  showed  that  60%  of  500,000 \nestablishments in the country were owned and operated by women, of these, 180,000 were new \nestablishments.  Women  owned  nearly  40%  of  the  new  establishments.  The  government \nsupports the role of women in catalyzing private sector development. The Ministry of Women\u2019s \nAffairs  has  assisted  the  Ministry  of  Commerce  (MOC)  in  setting  up  MOC\u2019s  gender \nmainstreaming action plan, which promotes women entrepreneurs. \n \n\n                                                \n5  The Development Policy Letter is in Appendix 3 and the Policy Matrix, listing the triggers and milestones defined for \n\nthis program and including the postprogram partnership framework, is in Appendix 4. \n\n6  ADB. 2008.

ADB  provides  national  assistance  to  SPS \n(through the Promoting Economic Diversification Program) and regional assistance through the \nGreater Mekong Strategy Trade Facilitation Program.8 Subprogram 3 focuses on the regulatory \nreform  of  SPS  management  in  Cambodia,  while  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Trade \nFacilitation Project builds on and strengthens SPS management capacity in Cambodia and the \nLao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  to  contribute to  intraregional trade,  export  competitiveness, \nand health protection. \n \nB. \n \n10. \nThe  impact  of  the  Promoting  Economic  Diversification  Program  is  an  expanded  and \ndiversified  private  sector.  By  the  end  of  2015,  the  program  is  expected  to  have  increased \ninvestment and economic diversification through more robust competition in domestic markets, \nlowered  regulatory  compliance  costs  and  better  investor  protection,  increased  exports  and \ndiversification  of  products  through  private  sector  access  to  better  quality  SPS  services  and \ntechnology, and reduced customs trade facilitation costs. \n \n11. \nThe  outcome  of  the  program  will  be  an  improved  business  environment  where  the \nprivate  sector  operates  efficiently  and  effectively.  This  will  be  reflected  in  an  improved \ncompetition  policy  framework  and  institutionalized  government  regulatory  review  systems  that \npromote better  appreciation  of the  costs  and  benefits  of regulations and greater transparency, \nstrengthen the SPS management system, increase government capacity to assess trade policy, \nand address the backlog in World Trade Organization (WTO) compliance and legal notifications. \n \nC. \n \n12. \nThe  report  and recommendation  of  the  President  for  subprogram  2  identified  10  policy \ntriggers for  subprogram  3  (Appendix  4).  In the  process  of  assessing  implementation  progress, \nthe government proposed a revision to a policy trigger on submission of trade remedy legislation \nto  the  national  assembly.  All  21  measures  (10  triggers  and  11  milestones)  required  for \nsubprogram  3  were  completed  by  the  end  of  August  2012  (Appendix  4).9 The  immediate  and \nmedium-term challenges are briefly outlined in the postprogram partnership framework (PPPF) \nin the program\u2019s policy matrix (Appendix 4). The PPPF advocates for continued support for the \ndevelopment of the policy framework and institution building, identifies government priorities for \nreform, and emphasizes needed improvements for the policy coordination framework. \n \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nRegulatory Efficiency and Competition Policy \n\n \n13. \nSubprogram 3 supports the government\u2019s agenda to improve the regulatory environment \nfor  business.  The  objective  is  to  promote  greater  competition  in  domestic  markets  and  lower \nregulatory  compliance  costs  faced  by  businesses  through  measures  linked  to  subprogram  2 \naccomplishments.  Such measures  are reforms  in  institutionalizing  good practices  in regulation \nand RIAs, and public consultation for the draft competition law. The following measures toward \nachieving these objectives are complete. \n \nInstitutionalize  regulatory  impact  assessments  in  government.  The  government \n14. \nestablished ORIA under the Economic, Social, and Cultural Council (ECOSOCC) of the Office \n\n                                                \n8  ADB. 2012.

Manila. \n9  Performance  of  the  Promoting  for  Economic  Diversification,  Subprogram  3  Triggers  (accessible  from  the  list  of \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nof  the  Council  of  Ministers  (OCM).  This  is  the  culmination  of  the  conceptualization  of  ORIA  in \nsubprogram 2. The establishment of ORIA institutionalizes good policymaking and reduces the \nregulatory burden in Cambodia. The fully operationalized ORIA produced a manual, guidelines, \nand  checklist  on  RIA.  These  products  introduce  policymakers  to the  importance  of  calculating \nthe costs and benefits of a regulation, and the need to weigh alternative solutions to problems \nidentified. Thus, the end result improves Cambodia\u2019s business climate. In promoting RIA, ORIA \nestablished  RIA  pilot  projects  in  four  line  ministries,  i.e.,  the  Ministry  of  Industry,  Mines,  and \nEnergy (MIME), MOC, the Ministry of Tourism (MOT), and the Ministry of Environment. \n \n15. \nBuild awareness and capacity to undertake regulatory impact assessments. MIME \nand MOC have taken ownership of the RIA process. In MIME, the RIA unit is a permanent task \nforce and, starting in 2011, all regulatory proposals in MIME\u2019s  General Department of Industry \nare subject to the RIA process. In MOC, the RIA process is applied to the regulatory processing \nof two main important laws: Competition Law and Trade Remedies. Both MIME and MOC have \ncompleted  one  preliminary  impact  assessment.  The  four  pilot  RIA  units  have  completed  their \n2012\u20132013 work plans. The newly created ECOSOCC website (www.ecosocc.gov.kh) includes \nORIA activities and preliminary impact assessments. \n \n16. \nIncrease female  participation in  regulatory  efficiency.  ORIA mainstreams gender in \nits activities and takes into account gender issues in regulatory analysis. As such, the recently \ndeveloped  manual  for  preliminary  impact  assessments  includes  a  checklist  for  gender  impact \nassessment, and analyses of the impact on women and equity, impact on women\u2019s roles, and \nthe participation of women in decision-making. RIA assessors first consult female entrepreneurs \nwhen assessing new regulations. \n \nPromote  competition  in  the  domestic  market.  The  government  conducted  a  public \n17. \nconsultation for the draft competition law. MOC, as the lead agency for drafting the law, shared \nthe draft law with other relevant government stakeholders and with the private sector through a \nseries  of  public  consultations.  This  action  supports  the  government\u2019s  commitment  to  have  a \ncompetition  policy  by  2015\u2014one  of  the  main  actions  the  government  will  accomplish  in  the \nRectangular Strategy, phases 1 and 2. For the government, a competition policy is expected to \nimprove  the  efficiency  of  the  economy,  thus  benefitting  consumers.  It  is  also  part  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s  commitment  to WTO  and  ASEAN.  The  ASEAN  Economic  Community  Blueprint \nrequires that all ASEAN countries introduce a competition policy by 2015.10 \n \n\n2. \n\nInvestment Climate \n\n \nSubprogram  3,  as  the  last  subprogram  of  the  Promoting  Economic  Diversification \n18. \nProgram,  implements  reforms  that  allow  the  government  to  improve  the  investment  climate \nthrough  the  promotion  of  technology  diffusion,  increased  access  to  finance,  and  gender \nmainstreaming. Measures accomplished by the government include (i) the General Department \nof  Taxation  at  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  (MEF)  is  giving  priority  to  negotiating  a \ndouble tax agreement (DTA) and has a DTA module, (ii) the General Department of Industry at \nMIME  is  starting  to  implement  the  capacity  development  plan  for  technology  and  innovation \npolicy, and (iii) MEF is introducing a partial credit guarantee facility for a sector-specific industry. \n \nInvestor confidence and protection. The government, with ADB technical assistance, \n19. \nis finalizing a draft policy framework for the DTA, a draft DTA negotiation program that identifies \nthe first country for negotiation, and a draft DTA module. The government sees the importance \nof DTA because it provides foreign investors with security and stability on the issue of taxation \n\n                                                \n10 ASEAN. 2003.

Hence,  it  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  foreign  investment  in \nCambodia. \n \n20. \nTechnology  diffusion. The government  is  implementing the Technology  Development \nFund  (TDF).  The  TDF  is  a  pilot  matching  grants  fund  between  ADB  and  the  government  that \nassists  SMEs  with  a  proven  track  record  in  food  processing  to  upgrade  their  SPS-related \nproduct quality and management processes, thus enhancing their competitiveness in domestic \nand  international  markets.  The  matching  grant  would  be  up  to  50%  of  an  SME\u2019s  upgrading \nproject  cost  to  a  maximum  of  $30,000.  During  the  first  round  of  the  TDF,  the  government \nselected  10  food  processing  SMEs  using  a  lottery  scheme.  The  fund-matching  disbursement \nwas  approximately  $256,000,  ranging  from  $15,000  to  $30,000  per  SME.  Women  own  and \nmanage seven of the 10 selected SMEs. This indicates an increase in female entrepreneurship \nand is in line with the findings of the 2011 economic survey. The government is currently in the \nprocess of selecting the next TDF recipients in the second round, which will draw from 25 food-\nprocessing SMEs. \n \n21. \nAccess to finance. MEF and the National Bank of Cambodia introduced a partial credit \nguarantee scheme to guarantee loans from commercial banks to companies and rice millers. In \n2010,  the government  adopted  a new  rice policy  based  on  an  ambitious  5-year  plan  aimed  at \nexpanding  the  production  and  export  of  rice.  However,  lack  of  financing  is  constraining  the \ngovernment\u2019s  goal  of  expanding  its  production  and  export  capacity  and  becoming  a  major \nexport  nation.  To  be  able  to  export  more  milled  rice,  local  rice  millers  need  more  financing  to \npurchase large amounts of Cambodia\u2019s paddy rice for processing domestically. The  new credit \nguarantee  scheme  provides  short-term  loans  to  the  rice  millers.  In  the  2011  budget,  the \ngovernment allocated up to $25 million to the partial credit guarantee scheme. In addition, the \nWorld  Bank  is  providing  the  government  with  another  partial  credit  guarantee  scheme  with  a \nbroader  scope  (including  working  capital  and  investments  for  agribusiness  in  general)  and \nlonger loan maturities (medium- to long-term).11 \n \nGender  dimension.  Selected  private  participants  in  the  food  processing  industry,  in \n22. \nconjunction  with  the  Sanitary  and  Phytosanitary  Standards  Management  Systems  Project \n(footnote 5), set up an informal private sector consultative group that meets quarterly. The group \npromotes  innovativeness  and  access  to  technology  in  the  food  processing  industry.  Women \nowners  of  food  processing  companies  account  for  almost  40%  of  the  group  members.  The \ngroup is an effective forum for exchanging information and provides inputs and comments to the \ngovernment on SPS issues, particularly relating to food safety, tax, regulatory burden, the TDF, \nstandards, and legal framework support. \n \n\n3. \n\nTrade Policy and Facilitation \n\n \n23. \nSubprogram 3 implements the government\u2019s reform agenda on trade policy that started \nin subprogram 2. These reforms  aim to lower the cost of doing business for the private sector \nand  provide  implementing  measures  to  improve  trade  facilitation  (customs  and  SPS)  for \nenhanced competitiveness. The following measures are complete. \n \n24. \nTrade  policy  reforms. Trade policy reforms continue with WTO publishing Cambodia\u2019s \nfirst  TPR.  The  government  finalized  the  revised  trade  remedies  legislation  and  accompanying \nimplementing  regulations.  Subprogram  3  assisted  the  government  in  conducting  and  finalizing \nthe TPR12 in November 2011. Cambodia is the first least-developed country to produce a TPR. \n\n                                                \n11 World Bank. 2010. Cambodia\u2013Agribusiness Access to Finance Project. Washington, DC. \n12 The  TPR  provides  a  review  of  Cambodia\u2019s  trade  and  investment  policies  and  highlights  the  government\u2019s \n\ncommitment for continuing trade reform. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nFor  trade  remedies,  the  government  shortened  the  2010  draft  trade  remedies  legislation  from \n100  articles  to  46  (footnote  7).  The  trade  remedies  working  group13 believes  that  shorter  draft \nlegislation,  comprising  only  the  substantive  part  of  the  law  and  not  the  implementing  articles, \nwould  gain  wider  support  from  relevant  stakeholders.14 The  working  group  also  produced  the \nimplementing regulations. The policy trigger initially anticipated the draft law\u2019s submission to the \nNational  Assembly.  However,  the  consultation  process  on  the  proposed  trade  remedies \nlegislation has been prolonged to ensure greater stakeholder support. Consistent with domestic \nlaw-making practice, the government now plans submission to the OCM by September 2012 for \nits endorsement and submission to Parliament in 2013. \n \n25. \nTrade  facilitation  in  customs  reforms.  The  General  Department  of  Customs  and \nExcise  (GDCE)  rolled  out  the  national  automated  system  for  customs  data  (ASYCUDA)  in  all \nmajor  ports  in  Cambodia.  This  continues  the  process  of  introducing  ASYCUDA  to  three  main \nports  in  subprogram  2;  ASYCUDA  now  operates  in  Sihanoukville  Port,  Phnom  Penh \nInternational  Airport,  Phnom  Penh  Port,  and  dry  ports  and  customs  border  checkpoints (MSE-\nKPM,  Poi  Pet,  So  Nguon,  Bavet,  Tech  Srun,  Teng  Lay,  Trapaing  Phlong,  and  Trapaing  Sre), \nand  covers  both  import  and  export  processing.  Progress  has  also  been  made  in  customs \nvaluation  transaction.  As  of  1  January  2011,  the  government  terminated  the  use  of  price  list \nmethods for valuing certain sensitive items and high-risk goods, including used vehicles, other \nused  items,  and  petroleum  products.  Instead,  a  complaint  procedure  and  appeals  process  for \nthese valuations is in place. GDCE implemented the WTO valuation agreement in parallel with \nthe decentralization of customs valuation decision-making, and obtained significant early results. \nFor example, 50% of dutiable goods were processed using the transaction value. \n \n26. \nCapacity,  enforcement,  and  awareness  in  food  safety  management  systems.  In \nsubprogram  3,  the  government  strengthened  risk  management  on  cross-border  market \nsurveillance activities for food safety. The Ministerial Regulation (Prakas 155) introduced a risk \nmanagement unit in the Cambodia Import\u2013Export Inspection and Fraud Repression Directorate \nGeneral  of  MOC.  The  government  also  improved  interministerial  coordination  on  food  safety \nbetween  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Forestry,  and  Fisheries  (MAFF),  the  Ministry  of  Health \n(MOH),  MOC,  MEF,  MIME,  and  MOT  by  issuing  an  interministerial  prakas  (IMP)  in  October \n2010 on the implementation of food safety based on the farm-to-table approach (IMP 868). The \nregulation  defines  the  roles  and  responsibilities  for  food safety  within  the  supply  chain  among \nthe  six  government  ministries  and/or  agencies.  On  the  implementation  of  food  safety,  the \ngovernment issued food safety guidelines, which were to be a precursor to the food policy. The \ngovernment also strengthened the delivery of SPS services to the private sector and community \nby  improving  the  quality  of  services  of  the  Institute  of  Standards  of  Cambodia  (ISC)  and  the \nIndustrial Laboratory Center of Cambodia (ILCC). Lastly, the government, with the assistance of \nthe ADB grant (footnote 5), drafted a food policy. \n \n27. \nProfessionalization  of  the  food  safety  management  system.  The  government  built \nthe  capacity  of  ILCC,  ISC,  MAFF,  MOC,  and  MOH  personnel  through  a  series  of  programs \nfinanced  under  the  program  cluster.  The  government  views  the  development  of  a  pool  of \nqualified  and  internationally  registered  auditors  as  critical  to  professionalize  food  safety \nmanagement.  This  capacity  building  is  complete.  First,  with  the  assistance  of  the  ADB  SPS \nproject,  19  government  food  safety  auditors  (four  are  women)  were  trained  as  International \n\n                                                \n13 The trade remedies working group is an interministerial working group led by MOC and comprising the Council of \n\nJurists, ECOSOCC, GDCE, MAFF, MIME, and the National Assembly. \n\n14 The current legislative process to prepare a draft law in Cambodia requires the draft law to be reviewed first by the \ninterministerial meeting before it is approved by the Council of Ministers for approval by the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. \nA  delicate  balancing  between  maintaining  the  core  of  the  draft  law  while  accommodating  the  needs  of  the  other \nstakeholders is crucial to gain support. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nDevelopment Financing and Program Costs \n\nOrganization for  Standardization  (ISO)  22000  lead  auditors.15 The  result  has  been  impressive: \n11 auditors (3 are women) passed the ISO qualification examinations. Second, 33 staff of ILCC, \nISC,  and  MIME  (12  are  women)  are  enrolled  in  intermediate  and  pre-intermediate  technical \nEnglish  classes.  The  classes  are  a  critical  requirement  for  ISO  accreditation.  Third,  the \nCambodia  Certification  Department  of  ISC,  which  is  responsible  for  the  certification  schemes, \nwas  also  assessed  by  international  accreditation  bodies  for  compliance  with  ISO  17021  and \nILCC  for  compliance  with  ISO  17025.  The  Cambodia  Certification  Department  addressed  the \ntwo main conformities found during the audit and is currently waiting for the response from the \naccreditation  body.  ILCC  has  obtained  ISO  accreditation  for  test  parameters  and  ISO  17025 \naccreditation  from  the  National  Association  of  Testing  Authorities  in  Australia  for  seven \nmicrobiology  tests. ILCC  has  also  been  awarded  certification  for ISO  17025 for  a full range of \nfood  and  water  tests.  These  accreditation  processes  increase  the  professionalization  of  food \nsafety management in Cambodia. Fourth, ILCC, with the assistance of an ADB grant, provided \nstaff  with  on-the-job-training  and  targeted  training  programs  for  food  safety  in  other  countries, \nsuch  as  Sri  Lanka,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam.16 Eight  ILCC  staff  (three  are  women)  enrolled  in \nexternal training courses. Fifth, ILCC continues to commercialize to meet increasing demand for \nits services.  The number of commercial tests completed increased by 34% in 2010 and 22% in \n2011. In addition, in 2010, ILCC\u2019s income increased by 130% and gross profits by about 170%. \nTo  meet  increasing  demand,  ILCC  produced  business  plans  for  2011  and  2012,  and  financial \nprojections. \n \nD. \n \n28. \nTo support reform initiatives, the government has requested a loan in various currencies \nequivalent  to  SDR16,568,000 ($25 million  equivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to \nfinance subprogram 3 of the Promoting Economic Diversification Program cluster. The loan will \nhave a 24-year term including an 8-year grace period, and interest of 1% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe  draft  loan  agreement.  The  government  will  meet  the  remaining  resource  requirement.  The \nproceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nrelevant policy.17 ADB will retain the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the \naccuracy of the withdrawal application certification. \n \nin  2012  central \nthe  development \n29. \ngovernment\u2019s  budget  of $1 billion  and  factors  required  to support  implementation  of  the  policy \nmatrix  (Appendix  4).  ADB  estimates  that  the  long-run  benefits  of  the  reform  program  are \napproximately  2.6%  of  GDP  or  over  $290  million  (in  2010  prices).18 These  economic  benefits \ninclude increased output and investment from a reduction in business costs of compliance with \nlicensing,  lower  trade  facilitation  costs,  increased  foreign  direct  investment  due  to  a  better \ninvestment  climate,  increased  productivity  due  to  lower  incidence  of  food  and  water-related \ndiseases  and  premature  mortality  in  the  human  population,  and  higher  tax  revenue  due  to  a \nbroader  tax  base.  The  reforms  will  also  have  important  distributive  effects  that  will  increase \nemployment  and  wages.  Distribution  of  labor  will  be  more  widespread  as  more  labor  will  be \nemployed in new industry. Female entrepreneurship will also thrive.  Policy adjustment costs to \nthe government and private sector are conservatively estimated as a discounted present value \nlump sum of $30 million (or $18 million without the present value lump sum). These adjustment \ncosts  include  administrative,  enforcement,  and  fiscal  costs  to  the  government  in  implementing \n                                                \n15 ISO 22000 is an international standard that defines the requirements of a food safety management system. \n16  The  ILCC  team  trained  at  Dynamics  Bangkok  in  Thailand,  at  the  Institute  of  Technology  in  Sri  Lanka,  and  at \n\nThe  program  size  reflects \n\nfinancing  needs \n\nIntertech Lab in Viet Nam. \n\n17 ADB. 1998.

The  policy \nadjustment  costs  include  the  increased  business  costs  of  compliance  with  the  SPS  reforms \nrelated to mandatory SPS-sensitive standards (conservatively estimated at $5 million). \n \nE. \n \n30.  MOC,  the  executing  agency  for  the  subprogram,  will  be  responsible  for  overall \nimplementation  of  subprogram  3, \nincluding  carrying  out  all  policy  actions,  program \nadministration,  and  maintenance  of  program  records.  The  subprogram  3  will  be  implemented \nfrom October 2011 to September 2012. The implementation arrangements under subprograms \n1 and 2  will  continue under  subprogram  3.  MOC  will  use  a  steering  committee  chaired  by  the \nminister  of  commerce  and  comprising  senior  officials  from  MEF  and  MIME.  The  steering \ncommittee  is  responsible  for  coordinating  implementation  and  sustaining  the  program  cluster \npolicy  actions  with  MOC  and  relevant  line  ministries  and  agencies  involved  in  supporting  the \nprogram  (MEF,  MIME,  the  Ministry  of  Environment,  MOH,  MOT,  and  ECOSOCC). 19  The \ncommittee  will  meet  quarterly  to  monitor  progress  and  oversee  program  implementation.  ADB \nmay be invited to participate in the meetings as an observer. English translations of the minutes \nof  these  meetings  will  be  forwarded  to  ADB  within  2  weeks  of  each  meeting.  MOC  will  be \nresponsible  for  day-to-day  program  implementation  activities,  and  report  on  implementation \nprogress. MEF will be responsible for subprogram 3 disbursements. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nGovernance \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  country\u2019s  financial  management  systems  were  assessed  to  identify  fiduciary  risks \n31. \nand  determine  fiduciary  arrangements  for  subprogram  3.  The  assessment  was  based  on  the \nsector  work  of  ADB\u2019s  report  on  Cambodia\u2019s  country  governance  risk  assessment  and  risk \nmanagement plan.20 The first national governance risk assessment and risk management plan \nfor  Cambodia  was  prepared  using  ADB\u2019s  Second  Governance  and  Anticorruption  Action  Plan \nand its implementation guidelines.21 The assessment is risk-based and looks at risk in relation to \nfiduciary matters and broader governance risks to achieving satisfactory development outcomes. \nThe  approach  is  based  on  three  core  governance  areas:  public  financial  management, \nprocurement,  and  corruption.  The  report  assesses  public  financial  management  to  have \ngradually  progressed,  given  the  strong  government  Public  Financial  Management  Reform \nProgram.  The  results  of  the  2010  public  expenditure  financial  accountability  (PEFA)  indicate \nmixed but improving performance since the 2002 PEFA. The 2010 PEFA finds Cambodia to be \nat par with other low-income countries at similar stages of development. Financial accountability \nimproved markedly, i.e., significant progress with budget formulation, internal controls, treasury \noperations and cash management, accounting system, and internal and external auditing. The \nprocurement  assessment,  which  used  several  recent  procurement  diagnostic  studies  of  the \nWorld Bank, ADB, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, indicates \nlimited recent tangible progress, but significant reform work is well under way and could result in \n\n                                                \n19 ECOSOCC is one of the councils in the OCM.

The  anticorruption  assessment  indicates  important  recent  legislative  and \ninstitutional  developments  with  prospects  for  improvement  have  not  yet  achieved  significant \nresults.  Important  new  legislative  developments  include  penalty  provisions  in  the  new  Law  on \nthe  Public  Finance  System  (2008),  strengthening  of  the  penal  code  in  relation  to  corruption \noffenses  (2009),  and  passing  of  the  new  Anti-Corruption  Law  (2010).  Institutional  work  now \nfocuses  on  strengthening  the  capacity  of  the  Anti-Corruption  Unit  to  fulfill  its  mandate  as \nprovided  for  under  the  new  law.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended to  date)  was \nexplained to and discussed with the government. \n \nB. \n \n32. \nSubprogram  3  will  contribute  to  sustainable  poverty  reduction  through  three  channels. \nThe  first  channel  is  through  higher,  broad-based,  and  sustainable  economic  growth. 22  By \nreducing  the  business  compliance  costs  with  the  business  licensing  system,  lowering  trade \nfacilitation costs, and improving taxation and investor guarantees in line with international norms, \nprivate and foreign investment will increase across a broad range of sectors thereby supporting \nhigher  economic  growth.  The  improvement  in  SPS  management  systems  will  aid  government \nefforts to develop backward linkages with the agriculture sector. The second channel is through \nthe  labor  market  with  increased  real  wages  and  hiring  activity  across  most  sectors  from \nincreased investment. The lower risk of food and waterborne diseases in the human population \nwill  increase  productivity  and  improve  household  incomes.  The  third  channel  is  through  lower \nprices of goods and services. By improving transparency in trade policy,  increasing integration \nwithin the region and the world through trade policy and regulatory reforms, and implementing \ncompetition policy, domestic prices will fall because of greater competition in the economy. \n \nSubprogram  3  is  classified  under  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  categorization \n33. \nreflects  a  gradual  buildup  of  ADB  dialogue  with  government  counterparts  on  gender  issues \nthroughout the Promoting Economic Diversification Program. Subprogram 1 was classified with \nno gender benefits and subprogram 2 was classified with some gender benefits. Subprogram 3 \nbenefits  women  entrepreneurs  by  improving  regulatory  aspects  and  increasing  access  for \ngreater  involvement  in  the  economy.  From  the  regulatory  aspect,  subprogram  3  addresses \nbarriers to integrating gender concerns within the regulation drafting processes by ensuring that \nthe RIA guidelines and checklists are developed to provide actions and indicators for adequate \nconsultation  of  all  key  stakeholder  groups  of  both  genders,  with  monitoring  of  women\u2019s \nparticipation  in  consultations.  Subprogram  3  provides  access  for  women  entrepreneurs  in  the \nfood  processing  sector by  giving  them  access  to funds from the  SPS  Matching Grants  Project \nthat  is  financed  under  subprogram  2  to  avail  of  relevant  SPS  technologies  and  improve  the \nquality of their products. To date, 7 of the 10 entrepreneurs supported by the project are female. \nGender  concerns  were  addressed  in  the  food  safety  management  system.  Currently,  30%  of \nISO-certified government auditors are women. Female business owners comprise close to 50% \nof  the  private  sector  consultative  group  of  the  food  processing  industry,  which  provides \nfeedback to the government on SPS issues, i.e., food safety and tax. ILCC and ISC continue to \ntrain  their  female  staff  in  food  safety  management.  To  date,  three  of  the  eight  ILCC  staff  sent \nabroad for training on food safety are female and one of the four ISC auditors accredited as ISO \n22000 lead auditors is female. \n \nC. \n \n34. \nThe  program  will  have  (i)  no  adverse  environmental  impacts,  (ii)  no  involuntary \nresettlement impacts, and (iii) no impact on indigenous peoples.

The RIA reforms have strong \npolitical commitment at the Office of the Council of Ministers and support from key \nregulatory agencies (MIME, MOC, MOE, and MOT). Similarly, the SPS reforms have \nstrong political commitment supported through the private sector development forum. \nBoth reforms are supported with capacity development projects linked to performance \nmilestones and triggers. \n\nMIME =  Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy; MOC =  Ministry of Commerce; MOE =  Ministry of Environment;  MOT = \nMinistry of Tourism; RIA = regulatory impact assessment; SPS = sanitary and phytosanitary standards. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n36. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the program will conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement.  In  addition  to  the  standard \nassurances,  the  government  will  ensure  that  program  steering  committee  constituted  under \nsubprogram 1 will meet semiannually and, if needed, on ad hoc basis to (i) monitor and evaluate \nprogress of the program cluster, in particular the PPPF; and (ii) provide guidance and direction \nto MOC, the implementing agencies, and the relevant line ministries for PPPF implementation. \nThe program steering committee may invite ADB to participate in its meetings. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  policy-based  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n37. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR16,568,000  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for \nsubprogram  3  of  the  Promoting  Economic  Diversification  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources,  with  an  interest  charge  at the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during the grace  period  and \n1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such \nother  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft \nloan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n5 September 2012 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \nExpanded and \ndiversified private \nsector \n\nOutcome \nImproved business \nand regulatory \nenvironment where \nthe private sector \noperates efficiently \nand effectively \n\nOutputs \n1.
