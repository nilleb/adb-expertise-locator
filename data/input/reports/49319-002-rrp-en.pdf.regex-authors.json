THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan, \nand (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Republic of Vanuatu for the additional financing1 of the \nCyclone Pam Road Reconstruction Project.2 \n \n2.  The additional financing will continue to support the efforts of the Government of Vanuatu \nto reconstruct and improve climate and disaster resilience of the transport infrastructure on the \nEfate ring road in Efate Island, Shefa Province, which was damaged by the Tropical Cyclone Pam \n(TCP) floods and storm surges during 12\u201314 March 2015. On 5 August 2015, the government \nrequested all development partners to contribute to and support its program\u2014emphasizing \ncapacity development for stronger Ni-Vanuatu (nationals of Vanuatu) disaster resilience, including \nmaximizing the use of local resources where possible. Twenty damaged sites were expected to \nbe rehabilitated and reconstructed using financing under the original project. On 29 December \n2016, the government requested to (i) scale up the project to include four additional damaged \nsites, and (ii) change the project scope to account for the extent of damage and unforeseen \nground conditions at two sites included in the original project. The updated project supports post-\ncyclone recovery and reconstruction efforts in the transport sector, specifically for rehabilitating \nroads and bridges and addressing landslides on the Efate ring road. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale  \n \n3.  TCP struck Vanuatu on 12\u201314 March 2015 as an extremely destructive Category 5 \ncyclone, with a wind speed estimated at 250 kilometers per hour and wind gusts peaking at \n320 kilometers per hour.3 The center of the cyclone passed east of Efate Island, which is home \nto the capital Port Vila, and continued southward passing just west of Erromango and Tanna \nislands in Tafea Province. Heavy rainfall and destructive storm surges caused severe flooding \nand widespread damage, particularly in Tafea and Shefa provinces. Eleven fatalities were \nconfirmed;  an  estimated  65,000  people  were  displaced;  and  about  17,000  buildings  were \ndamaged or destroyed, including houses, schools, clinics, and other medical facilities. \n \n4.  The project supports government efforts to reconstruct and improve climate and disaster \nresilience of the transport infrastructure on the Efate ring road, which suffered flood and storm \ndamage from TCP. The project includes the rehabilitation and reconstruction of 20 sites along the \nEfate ring road. All civil works were expected to be designed and implemented using the \u201cbuild \nback better\u201d (BBB) concept to strengthen resilience against future disasters and climate change \nrisks. Works will also incorporate gender-proactive and universal access features in designs, \nincluding the construction of walkways and provision of access to laundry facilities in the streams \nalongside the road.4 \n  \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2015. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \nProposed Loans, Grants, and Administration of Grant to the Republic of Vanuatu for the Cyclone Pam Road \nReconstruction Project. Manila. \n3  Government of Vanuatu. 2015. Vanuatu Post-Disaster Needs Assessment: Tropical Cyclone Pam, March 2015. \nPort Vila. \n4  Build back better (BBB) concept (i) promotes a decentralized and participatory approach to reconstruction, (ii) uses \nlocal skills, institutions and resources, (iii) adopts climate and disaster risk reduction measures into reconstruction \nprocesses to lessen vulnerability to future risks, (iv) promotes the recovery of local livelihoods, and (vi) enables a \nmore cost-effective and sustainable recovery. \n ", "2 \n5.  Delivery of expected output. The project is on track to meet its output and outcome, and \nrehabilitation and reconstruction of all damaged sites included in the original project are expected \nto be completed by June 2018. This 6-month delay from the original project implementation period \nof January 2016\u2013December 2017 was caused by a delay in (i) the effectiveness of the loan and \ngrant agreements until 3 March 2016, from its signing on 1 March 2016, because Parliament was \ndissolved; and (ii) the mobilization of design and supervision consultants (DSCs) because the \ngovernment signed the DSC contract late, on 27 June 2016. \n \n6.  Satisfactory implementation progress. The project is progressing well and is estimated \nto be 29% complete against 38% planned. Funds disbursed as of 15 May  2017 reached \n$1,596,165 (9% of the total available funds), exceeding projected targets. The government \ncompleted the DSC selection on 27 June 2016 and mobilized consultants on 6 July 2016. The \nDSCs include international and national consultants, 30% of whom are women, and have been \nintegrated  within  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  established  under  the  Public  Works \nDepartment of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Public Utilities (MIPU). The PMU, led by the DSC \nteam leader, manages project activities and coordinates with other development partners to avoid \nduplication of activities. The DSCs assist the MIPU in project design and implementation; and \nhave  completed  a  feasibility  study  that  includes  an  engineering  option  analysis;  financial, \neconomic, social, gender, environment, land acquisition, and indigenous people assessments; \nclimate change adaptation and disaster risk management analyses; and detailed engineering \ndesigns. \n \n7.  The DSCs also assist the MIPU in procuring a civil works contract for all 20 sites. MIPU \npublished an invitation for bids in national newspapers and on the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nwebsite on 22 January 2017, with bid submissions closing on 16 March 2017, and held a pre-bid \nmeeting on 8 February 2017. The MIPU received six bids, which they are evaluating. The civil \nworks contract is scheduled to be awarded in early July 2017. \n \n8.  On 6 February 2017, ADB recommended a contract variation for the DSCs to undertake \na feasibility study on and detailed designs of the expanded scope under this additional financing \nas an advance readiness action to expedite implementation of the damaged infrastructure. The \nfeasibility study includes all due diligence of the expanded scope; and the detailed designs will \ncover engineering designs, geotechnical investigations, topography, and bathymetry surveys. \nThe feasibility study and detailed designs was completed in June 2017. \n \n9.  Satisfactory compliance with environmental safeguards. The project is classified \ncategory B for the environment. Following the environmental assessment and review framework \n(EARF) prepared for the project, the DSC prepared two environmental assessments on behalf of \nMIPU: an assessment covering eastern Efate (12 sites) and an assessment covering western \nEfate (8 sites). Following review and clearance by ADB, MIPU included these assessments in the \napplication for an environmental permit and a foreshore development consent. ADB has disclosed \nthe assessments on ADB\u2019s project website. The Department of Environmental Protection and \nConservation  has  issued  environmental  permits  for  all  the  sites.  MIPU  is  implementing \nenvironmental safeguards in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and \nnational laws and regulations. \n \n10.  Satisfactory compliance with social safeguards. The project was originally classified \ncategory B for involuntary resettlement, but was reclassified to category C. Its classification as \ncategory  C  for  indigenous  peoples  remains  the  same.  The  project  has  not  triggered  the \ninvoluntary resettlement safeguard as all works will be within the existing road corridor, and \naccess to additional land has been negotiated with the landowners. Following the resettlement \n ", "3 \nframework, MIPU prepared a due diligence report confirming land arrangements based on \ndetailed designs. The finalized due diligence report (including all memorandums of understanding \nand third-party validation) has been submitted by the PMU, cleared by MIPU, and disclosed by \nADB on ADB project website. MIPU is implementing social safeguards in compliance with the \nSafeguard Policy Statement and national laws and regulations. \n \n11.  Successful management of risks. MIPU is managing the risks identified under the \noriginal project, and these risks do not threaten the successful implementation of the project. The \nenvisaged project risks and the actions taken to mitigate those risks are described in detail in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.5 \n \n12.  On-track project performance rating. As of 31 March 2017, the project is rated on track, \nwith 88.35% of contracts awarded and over 90% of funds disbursed against baseline projections. \n \n13.  Consequent  to  paras.  5\u201312,  the  original  project  is  performing  well.6 The  proposed \nadditional financing is required to scale up the original project to include four additional sites on \nthe Efate ring road damaged by TCP, and change the scope to cover additional work at two sites. \nThe updated project complies with the subproject selection and eligibility criteria for additional \nfinancing: (i) that it remains technically feasible, economically viable, and financially sound (paras. \n23\u201325); (ii) that it is accorded a high priority by the government; (iii) that it is consistent with the \nproject\u2019s development objectives; and (iv) that it is consistent with the current country partnership \nstrategy.7 \n  \n14.  Additional financing is the most suitable financing modality because (i) the additional sites \nare on the same road as the original project; (ii) as in the original project, the DSCs will undertake \nthe feasibility study and detailed engineering designs (through a contract variation [para. 8]); \n(iii) the procurement of civil works will be conducted following ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2015, as amended from time to time); and (iv) the DSCs will carry out construction supervision \nthrough single source selection. Works under the additional financing will follow the continuation \nof work carried out by the DSCs. The continuity for downstream work that the DSCs will perform \nat the same time along with the works under the original project will facilitate continuity in the \ntechnical approach, experience acquired, and continued professional liability of the DSCs.  \n \n15.  The additional financing meets the eligibility criteria and requirements of emergency \nassistance loans: (i) that the government has made an official request for additional financing on \n29 December 2016; and (ii) that the impact on economic, social, and governance needs and \npriorities has been identified in the damage and needs assessment conducted in May 2015 and \nin the feasibility study of the original project conducted in December 2016. \n  \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n16.  The impact will be accelerated economic and social recovery in Vanuatu\u2019s TCP-affected \nprovinces. The outcome will be socioeconomic activities restored to at least pre-TCP levels. The \nimpact and outcome statements and project outcome indicators did not change because of the \nadditional financing. \n \n                                                 \n5  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  ADB. 2010.

Outputs \n \n17.  There will be only one output: transport infrastructure in damaged locations on the Efate \nring road reconstructed and climate- and disaster-proofed. The project output indicators have \nbeen expanded to include the following expected outputs from the scale-up and change of scope \nunder the additional financing: \n(i)  Work conducted on additional locations on the Efate ring road damaged by TCP: \n(a)  6.2 kilometers of the Tassikiri road section upgraded, including drainage \nimprovement; \n(b)  management of Prima floodplain developed to manage floodwaters in the \nPrima (La Colle) River catchment near Prima Bridge; \n(c)  Tanoliu and Ulei bridges reconstructed; and \n(d)  drainage at Saama improved. \n \n(ii)  Scope of work for two of the damaged sites in the original project changed because \nof the extent of the damage and unforeseen ground conditions: \n(a)  Epule Bridge. The bridge was to be repaired in the original project, but it \nnow requires reconstruction with an improved road alignment. \n(b)  Marona Bridge. Boreholes under geotechnical investigations terminated \nat a depth of 20 meters. However, data interpretation and analysis showed \nthat the soils underneath were undergoing liquefaction. The boreholes \nneed to be driven down to at least 30 meters to confirm the founding \nmaterial for the bridge piles. \n  \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n18.  The updated project is estimated to cost $27.9 million (Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nCurrent  Additional \nItem  Amounta  Financingb  Total \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  The additional financing will use the implementation arrangements established for the \noriginal project. MIPU proposes to use the DSCs under the original project (which is financed by \nthe Asian Development Fund and ADB-administered cofinancing) to perform services under the \nadditional financing project (which is not cofinanced). As the blanket waiver of ADB\u2019s member \ncountry procurement eligibility restrictions that applied to the original project will not apply to the \nadditional financing, approval by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors is required for a waiver of Article 14(ix) \nof the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank. The Ministry of Finance and \nEconomic  Management  (MFEM)  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  the  MIPU  will  be  the \nimplementing agency. MIPU has established a PMU comprising the DSC team (international and \nnational consultants) and Public Works Department engineers within the MIPU for project design \nand implementation supervision services; and has established an infrastructure working group, to \nprovide  oversight  on  project  implementation  under  the  guidance  of  a  program  recovery \ncommittee. The DSCs are undertaking the required due diligence and engineering designs of the \nworks under additional financing, and will also carry out construction supervision along with the \nworks under the original project, selected through single source selection.  \n \n22.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual.9 \n                                                 \n9  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements\nImplementation period  January 2016\u2013December 2018 \nEstimated completion date  Physical completion date: 31 December 2018 \nLoan and grant closing date: 30 June 2019 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Program recovery committee \nDirector General of Ministry of Finance and Economic Management \nDirector General of Ministry of Infrastructure and Public Utilities \nDirector General of Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Finance and Economic Management \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  Ministry of Infrastructure and Public Utilities \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Infrastructure working group, project management unit, MIPU in Port Vila, \nVanuatu; 3 MIPU staff \nProcurement  International competitive  1 contract  $12.1 million \nbidding: original project \nInternational competitive  1 contract  $7.4 million \nbidding: additional financing \nNational competitive bidding  None  Not applicable \nShopping  None  Not applicable \nConsulting servicesa  Quality- and cost-cased  175.75 person-months  $3,599,178 \nselection (90:10): Original  (design and  (latest revised) \nproject  supervision) \nSingle source selection:  25.00 person-months  $475,000 \nAdditional financing  (supervision only) \nRetroactive financing and/or  Retroactive financing for the reimbursement of eligible expenditures incurred \nadvance contracting  under the project before the effective date of the loan and grant agreements, up to \na maximum amount equivalent to 30% of each loan and grant amount subject to \nexpenditures incurred after the emergency occurred but not earlier than 12 \nmonths before the date of signing of the loan and grant agreements \n \nAdvance contracting for consulting services recruited by ADB and contract to be \nsigned by the government \n \nAdvance contracting for civil works procured by the government \nDisbursement  The loan and grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \na  Universal procurement of services applies.

The additional financing will support activities that respond to critical post-cyclone recovery \nand reconstruction priorities and the government\u2019s transport and tourism priorities (footnote 3). \nThe civil works will be selected using selection criteria, option analysis, cost estimates, and \nfeasibility studies. The detailed engineering designs include measures to support the socially \nvulnerable, including women, children, and the disabled; and adopt a sustainable maintenance \nstrategy while considering future traffic growth as well as climate and disaster risks. The detailed \nengineering designs and technical specifications for construction will be determined and derived \nusing BBB principles. \n \n ", "7 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n24.  The Efate ring road provides transportation services to about 29,150 people in rural areas \nand 55,525 people in urban areas. It also provides increased access to and improves the quality \nof the transportation network, thereby reducing vehicle operating costs and travel time and \nimproving the reliability of access to social services. The improved road will help reduce poverty \nand increase incomes in rural areas by stimulating economic activity in tourism, local business \ndevelopment, and agricultural economic activities. ADB will implement the overall project as a \nsector project under emergency procedures.10 The economic analysis of the damaged sites of the \noriginal project and the additional financing has been completed following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nthe Economic Analysis of Projects.11 The economic due diligence included demand, cost\u2013benefit, \nsensitivity, sustainability, distribution, and risk analyses. The economic internal rate of return of \nthe damaged sites is 13.20% in the original project and 20.16% in the additional financing. The \ndamaged infrastructure will not be relocated as it is within the existing right-of-way, but it will be \nreconstructed to higher standards under BBB principles. The civil works will be selected and \nprioritized following the selection criteria, including financial and economic considerations that \nrequire a minimum economic internal rate of return of 9%. \n \n25.  Outputs under the additional financing are public service goods with no cost recovery, and \nrequire no financial viability assessment and financial internal rate of return analysis. Roads and \nbridges to be constructed following BBB principles will be maintained using the MIPU\u2019s recurrent \nbudget. The financial analysis of the project finds that the country has been at a budgetary deficit \nat the gross level for 4 reported years, from 2010 to 2013. It is uncertain how the government, in \na deficit environment, will source incremental funds for the maintenance of the new assets \nrehabilitated under the project. Given that the estimated average annual total maintenance cost \nof the new assets is $209,600 per year, which is within the MIPU\u2019s annual maintenance and \nreplacement capital expenditure budget of Vt500 million, the government is expected to use this \nfinancing for the maintenance of the new assets. As the outputs will have BBB features to enhance \nresilience, less strain will be placed on the operation and maintenance budget in the first 3 years. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n26.

The MFEM and the MIPU have implemented ADB-financed \nprojects, through various PMUs, including the ongoing original project.12 The PMUs carry out the \naccounting and bookkeeping for these projects while the Vanuatu PMU and the Department of \nFinance and Treasury of the MFEM monitor them centrally. Both the MFEM and the MIPU have \nbeen involved in the financial management of projects, accounting, financial reporting, and audit; \nand have gradually built their capacity. ADB has previously carried out a financial management \nassessment of the executing and implementing agencies. The overall fiduciary risk was rated \nmoderate; it remains manageable and will be mitigated by the qualified accountant assigned to \nthe PMU. The financial analysis of the executing and implementing agencies undertaken during \nthe approval of the ongoing original project remains valid for the additional financing.

The procurement capacity assessment of the MIPU that \nwas conducted for the overall project (footnote 12) identified a lack of procurement capacity within \nthe MIPU. The DSCs have a procurement specialist available to undertake any procurement \nrequirements,  including  providing  capacity  development  during  project  implementation  to \nstrengthen the MIPU\u2019s procurement capacity. \n \n27.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government during the inception mission for the original project and the \nfact-finding  mission  for  the  additional  financing.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 9). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n28.  Poverty and social dimensions. The destruction of critical infrastructure has affected \nmany people, especially vulnerable groups. Such disaster events also create new vulnerabilities \nas they affect employment and livelihood-generating abilities, personal safety, public health and \nsanitation, household efficiency, and food production. While TCP\u2019s destruction of physical assets \noccurred in March 2015, production losses and associated higher costs of production will linger \nfor some time. The disaster\u2019s negative impact on the country\u2019s overall socioeconomic conditions \nwill be felt for many years to come. The project\u2019s expected poverty and social benefits and impacts \non local communities will be analyzed through a review of previous social and poverty analyses \nand consultations with stakeholders of ADB-financed projects. PMU has prepared a summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy. Repairs to roads and bridges are being prioritized to \nminimize secondary impacts on the economy; and to restore connectivity to essential services \nsuch as hospitals, schools, markets, and main commercial centers in Port Vila. The project will \ncontribute to the reconstruction and repair of affected critical transport infrastructure, and rebuild \ntransport networks to higher standards of disaster and climate resilience. \n \n29.  Gender. As in the original project, the additional financing is classified some gender \nelements. While a gender action plan is not required, the project will include and incorporate \nspecific gender features for the additional sites to ensure women\u2019s involvement. Specific targets \ninclude  30%  women  participation  in  community  meetings  and  training  sessions,  such  as \neducation  awareness  on  HIV  transmission  and  prevention  (in  coordination  with  the  HIV \ncoordinator from the Ministry of Health) and on gender-sensitive transport and road safety issues. \nAt least 20% of the grievance redress and community liaison committee members will be women. \nEmployment of women will also be encouraged during implementation. \n \n30.  Consultation and communication. In line with ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy, the \nDSC will make all relevant project information, including safeguards implementation, available in \na timely manner and in a form and language that is understandable to the affected people and \nother stakeholders. The DSC has prepared a consultation and communication plan for the original \nproject, which will be expanded as required to cover the additional sites, communities, and \nstakeholders. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n31.  Environment. The additional financing is classified category B for the environment. It will \nprovide funds to rehabilitate a further six sites and will follow the EARF requirements prepared for \nthe  original  project,  which  follows  the  Environmental  Protection  and  Conservation  Act  (as \namended), 2010, with any additional elements required to comply with the Safeguard Policy \n ", "9 \nStatement. The screening undertaken during fact-finding concludes that, as in the original project, \nmost of the impacts (i) will be site-specific; (ii) are not particularly significant as the road segments \nand bridges to be repaired will be reconstructed within their existing location, i.e., within the \nexisting road corridor; and (iii) can be readily mitigated through the implementation of the \nenvironmental management plan (EMP). As established under the original project, during road \nreconstruction,  environmental  safeguards  will  follow  the  system  being  implemented  by  the \ngovernment for other ADB- or externally funded projects, where (i) minor repair works are \nimplemented following environmental management and safety guidelines or a simple EMP; and \n(ii) major works associated with the rehabilitation or reconstruction of roads and bridges will be \nsubject to an environmental assessment and require an EMP, which will be updated during \ndetailed  engineering  design,  incorporated  in  bid  and  contract  documents,  implemented  by \ncontractors, and monitored by the implementing agency. Monitoring will follow the monitoring plan \nin the EARF. ADB and the government will post the monitoring reports on their websites. \n \n32.  Involuntary resettlement. The additional financing is classified category C for involuntary \nresettlement. The screening undertaken during fact-finding concludes that, as in the original \nproject, the project will be confined to the existing ring road corridor and additional access to land \nwill be obtained through negotiated settlement or land-use agreements following the approved \nresettlement framework. Due diligence for additional sites will follow the processes outlined in the \nresettlement framework; and will be reviewed, cleared, and publicly disclosed by MIPU. \n \n33.  Indigenous peoples. The additional financing is classified category C for indigenous \npeoples. The project is not expected to affect any distinct and vulnerable group of indigenous \npeoples. Melanesians are the native people of Vanuatu and comprise the clear majority of the \npopulation as well as the project beneficiaries. MIPU will implement all project components in a \nculturally appropriate and participatory manner. \n \n34.  Capacity building. The safeguards capacity of the MIPU and the Vanuatu PMU is being \nstrengthened through the mentoring and training provided by the DSCs and the parallel support \nprovided by ADB. ADB is also providing technical assistance to the Department of Environmental \nProtection and Conservation for strengthening the country safeguards system.13 \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n \n35.  The overall risk is moderate, and the integrated benefits and impacts outweigh the costs. \nMajor risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan (footnote 5). \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures\nLack of procurement  A procurement specialist in the PMU is carrying out all project procurement activities and is \ncapacity in the MIPU  building capacity in the MIPU\u2019s engineering staff. \nWeak financial  ADB has previously conducted a financial management assessment and has prepared a \nmanagement  financial management action plan, which is being implemented. MIPU maintains separate \ncapacity  accounts for the project, and undertakes monthly reconciliation and verification of the \nproject account with the Department of Finance and Treasury. \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2016.
