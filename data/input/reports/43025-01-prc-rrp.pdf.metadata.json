It  will \nsupport the restructuring and expansion of the Qinzhou district heating network; construction of \nurban roads and bridges, and related services such as better flood control; and stronger urban \nmanagement capacity.2  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nGansu  province  has  the  PRC's  second-lowest  gross  domestic  product  per  capita\u2014\n3. \nTianshui  municipality\u2019s  3.6  million  inhabitants  include  640,000  urban  dwellers  in  Qinzhou  and \nMaiji  districts  with  an  estimated  urban  poverty  rate  of  13.5%  (2009).3 Development  barriers \ninclude  poor  infrastructure  and  Gansu's  remote  inland  location.  Transport  links  are  being \nimproved  through  expressway  and  rail  construction,  and  in  July  2009  the  State  Council \napproved the establishment of the Guanzhong-Tianshui Economic Zone (GTEZ). By 2020, the \nGTEZ is intended to become the northwest PRC's economic backbone. Specific objectives are \nthe  promotion  of  economic  reform,  creation  of  an  open  economic  zone,  and  transport \nimprovements  for  all,  thereby  attracting  investment  and  corporations.  Tianshui\u2019s  urban \npopulation will increase as rural migrants seize economic opportunities in the GTEZ. The influx \nof industries and migrants will pressure Tianshui\u2019s infrastructure. \n \nAlthough  positioned  as  an  economically  developed,  environment-friendly,  and  livable \n4. \ncity, Tianshui faces urban development challenges. These include poor district heating and air \nquality, seasonal flooding, and inadequate urban transportation. The rationale for the project is \naddressing these urban development challenges and so enabling Tianshui to meet urbanization \npressures and maximize GTEZ-related benefits. \n \n5. \nDistrict heating. The many small-scale boilers of Tianshui\u2019s Qinzhou district are energy-\ninefficient.  During  winter,  pollutants  from  these  coal-fired  boilers  and  single-family  heating \nstoves  lessen  air  quality.  Poor  service  quality  and  limited  heating  coverage  especially  affect \nwomen  and  the  urban  poor\u2014for  instance,  women  are  more  likely  to  have  higher  exposure  to \npollutants  from  heating  stoves.  Inefficiencies  also  undermine  the  financial  sustainability  of  the \nTianshui  Heating  Company  (THC),  Qinzhou  district\u2019s  main  heating  provider.  The  China \nHuaneng Group intends to pipe recycled wastewater to a combined heat and power plant (CHP) \nto be constructed outside Tianshui.4 After cooling the CHP\u2019s boilers, the recycled hot water will \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The  project  was  prepared  through  ADB.  2009.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the \n\nGansu Tianshui Urban Infrastructure Development Project. Manila (TA 7344-PRC). \n\n3  Bulletin on 2009 Tianshui National Economic and Social Development Statistics provided by the Tianshui Municipal \nStatistics Bureau. By comparison, 4.2% of the PRC's rural population was living below the national poverty line in \n2008 (ADB. 2010. Basic Statistics 2010. Manila). \n\n4   China Huaneng Group will finance and construct the CHP and transmission pipelines, which have been deemed \nassociated  facilities  for  the  purposes  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  Tianshui  Municipal \nGovernment  is  coordinating  with  the  China  Huaneng  Group  on  construction  timing  and  assurances  have  been \nagreed regarding these arrangements. \n\n\fbe returned to Qinzhou district for winter heating. With the support of the proposed project, the \nTianshui  Municipal  Government  (TMG)  will  commission  new  distribution  capacity,  close  199 \ncoal-fired  boilers,  and  restructure  the  heating  sector.  This  will  improve  energy  efficiency, \noperational  effectiveness,  and  quality  of  district  heating  services.  The  proposed  reforms  will \nsubstantially  increase  district  heating  coverage,  reduce  annual  coal  use  by  252,000  tons,  and \nlower annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 428,000 tons. \n \n6. \nFlood  control.  Beyond  air  pollution  challenges,  the  Xi  and  Wei  rivers  converge  in \nTianshui and flood seasonally. The project will promote climate change adaptation through flood \ncontrol  measures\u2014the  annual  probability  of  seasonal  flooding  along  the  Chengji  road  flood \nembankment is expected to fall from 10% to 1%.  \n \nUrban  transport.  Further,  Tianshui's  urban  population  grows  by  over  4%  annually. \n7. \nInadequate  facilities  for  public  transport  and  nonmotorized  transport  (NMT),  and  poor  traffic \nmanagement and traffic safety worsen slow urban road development. The project will construct \nroad  and  bridge  infrastructure,  and  related  services,  to  improve  transportation  for  all.  The \nproposed  holistic  road  design  and  road  safety  audit,  urban  transport  planning  system,  and \nmanagement  and  maintenance  will  improve  safety,  traffic  and  parking  control,  and  driving \nbehavior.  These  measures  will  boost  transport  efficiencies  and  safety,  improve  Tianshui\u2019s \nlivability  and  ability  to  benefit  from  the  GTEZ,  while  coping  with  more  industry  and  a  larger \npopulation. \n \n8. \nStrategic  fit  and  sector  experience. The  project  will  support the  PRC\u2019s Twelfth  Five-\nYear Plan, 2011\u20132015, which targets energy conservation, carbon dioxide emission reductions, \nand regional development, particularly in the western region. The project components comprise \npart of the 2020 Tianshui City Master Plan, which the Gansu Provincial Government approved \nin  July  2009,  and  TMG  investment  programs.  The  project  also  aligns  with  the  PRC  country \npartnership  strategy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB). 5  It  conforms  to  ADB\u2019s  Water \nPolicy,6 which  encourages  water  conservation,  including  wastewater  reuse.  It  supports  ADB\u2019s \nurban  sector  strategy  and  the  PRC's  urbanization  strategy,  which  promote  rural\u2013urban \nintegration  and  infrastructure  investments  in  dynamic  settlements.  It  also  supports  ADB\u2019s \nClimate Change Program7 through reduced GHG emissions from coal-fired heating boilers and \nlower vehicle emissions per trip. ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative8 will inform the design of \nurban  road  components  and  related  institutional  and  capacity  development  assistance,  for \ninstance  through  support  to  improve  facilities  for  NMT.  ADB-financed  urban  development \nprojects in the PRC generally perform well. This will be  ADB's third urban development project \nin  Gansu  province,  and  the  first  foreign-financed  urban  development  project  in  Tianshui.  The \nproject  design  reflects  lessons from  previous  ADB-financed  urban  development  projects  in  the \nPRC, including the need for early support on ADB policies and procedures\u2014interventions have \nbeen  particularly  effective  when  they  were  part  of  well-conceived  and  broader  urban \ndevelopment  master  plans  and  sector  master  plans,  and  were  accompanied  by  capacity \nbuilding to strengthen management and implementation capacity. \n \n\n                                                \n5   ADB. 2008. Country Partnership Strategy: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2008\u20132010. Manila. ADB\u2019s existing strategy \nidentifies  urban  infrastructure  development  as  a  priority  investment  sector.  Sustainable  and  low  environmental \nimpact  urban  development  is  expected  to  continue  to  be  a  focal  area  in  the  new  country  partnership  strategy \n(2011\u20132015) that is under preparation. \n\n6   ADB. 2001.

The  project  has  the  following  demonstration  features:  (i)  Multiple \n9. \nwastewater  reuse\u2014in  an  innovative  application  of  circular  economy  (reduce,  reuse,  recycle) \nprinciples, Tianshui\u2019s wastewater will be recycled and piped to a CHP, where it will be used for \ncooling purposes. The resultant hot water will be piped back to Qinzhou district, where it will be \nused during the winter season for district heating. (ii) Increased affordability of heating\u2014reusing \nwastewater for district heating will reduce the need for municipal subsidies, enable tariff levels to \nbe held constant in the medium term, and improve affordability for the poor. (iii) Holistic urban \nroad design and road safety audit\u2014a holistic approach to urban road design will improve access \nto NMT facilities. An audit of selected project roads and bridges  will ensure infrastructures  are \ndesigned  and  constructed  to  best-practice  road  safety  requirements.  (iv)  People-centric  urban \ntransport planning\u2014an urban road network planning system based on a geographic information \nsystem will improve TMG\u2019s ability to plan and manage the urban road network  to meet rapidly \nevolving  urban  development  and  traffic  demands.  Planning  and  management  systems  will  be \nestablished  for  NMT  and  parking,  including  prioritizing  integrated  facilities  for  pedestrians  and \nbicycles  and  as  feeders  to  public  transport,  and  regularizing  street-parking  policies  and \nenforcement.  (v)  Urban \ninfrastructure  management  and  maintenance  system\u2014this  will \nsignificantly  enhance  road  maintenance  planning,  prioritization,  funding,  and  monitoring. \n(vi) Grievance-redress  mechanism\u2014mandated  by  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009), \nthe  environment-related project grievance-redress mechanism  was designed through  intensive \nconsultation  with  the  authorities  and  the  public.  The  resultant  structures  and  procedures  have \nbeen embraced and are already used as a model for other ADB-financed projects in the PRC. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe project\u2019s impact will be better living conditions in Tianshui municipality. The intended \n10. \nproject  outcome  is  improved  heating,  transport,  and  flood  control  services  in  Tianshui \nmunicipality. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe project has four outputs:  \n\n11. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nQinzhou district heating network\u2014upgrading Qinzhou district's central heating \nnetwork  by  decommissioning  199  outdated  coal-fired  boilers,  building  a  33.7-\nkilometer (km) primary heat transmission network, constructing 78 heat-exchange \nstations,  and  increasing  district  heating  coverage  by  11  million  square  meters \n(m2); \nChengji road and flood control facilities\u2014constructing the 12 km Chengji road \nand 10.6 km flood control embankment along the Xi river\u2019s north bank, including \ntwo large bridges, with related facilities; \nTianshui  urban  transport  improvements\u2014improving  urban  roads  and  related \nfacilities  by  constructing  four  new  roads  for  a  total  of  4.9  km,  rehabilitating  one \nroad  (2.0  km),  constructing  three  bridges,  and  developing  related  services  such \nas  drainage  pipelines  and  sewers,  energy-saving  lighting,  public  green  areas, \nand road-safety features;9 and \nCapacity  development  and  institutional  strengthening\u2014providing  support  in \ntwo  main  areas  (a)  to  the  Tianshui  project  management  office  (TPMO)  and \nimplementing agencies to ensure efficient and effective project implementation in \ncompliance  with  ADB  requirements;  and  (b)  an  urban  transport  capacity \n\n                                                \n9   The installation of other infrastructure, such as water supply pipes, will be coordinated with agencies concerned. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n \n\n \nD. \n \n12. \n \n\n \n\ndevelopment program, including holistic urban road design and road safety audit, \npeople-centric  urban \ntransport  planning,  road  network  management  and \nmaintenance,  and related  training.

Mitigation  measures  will  be  designed  into  cut  and  fill  slopes, \nbuilding  foundations  and  structures,  road  pavements,  and  other  infrastructure.  Holistic  road \ndesign  and  safety  design  considerations  will  be  incorporated  into  road  components,  including \nenhanced  traffic  markings  and  signage,  pedestrian  lanes,  bus  stops,  protection  barriers,  and \nstronger safety education and traffic safety management. The flood control component will also \nsupport  climate  change  adaptation\u2014the  Chengji  road  and  flood  control  embankment  was \nrealigned  to  minimize  potential  landslide  risk.  A  detailed  description  of  components  is  in  the \nPAM. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n18. \nThe  economic  analysis  evaluated  technical  options  and  confirmed  that  the  project \ncomponents  are  the  least-cost  options  in  support  of  Tianshui\u2019s  long-term  development  plans. \nThe  economic  internal  rates  of  return  were  computed  at  15.2%  for  the  district  heating \ncomponent, 16.2% for the Chengji road and flood control component, and 18.2% for the urban \ntransport improvement component, all of which exceed the economic opportunity cost of capital \nof  12%.  The  results  are  robust  relative  to  the  normal  range  of  sensitivity  analyses.  Economic \ncosts  include  (i)  capital  costs  such  as  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  environmental \nmitigation  and  monitoring  costs;  (ii)  project  management  and  institutional  strengthening; \n(iii) physical  contingencies;  and  (iv)  operation  and  maintenance  costs.  Economic  benefits \nidentified  for  the  district  heating  component  include  (i)  savings  from  greater  energy  efficiency \nthrough  reduced  coal  consumption,  (ii)  environmental  improvement  resulting  from  lower \nenvironmental costs due to reduced pollutant emissions, and (iii) incremental economic benefits \ncomputed  as  the  difference  between  the  centralized  district  heating  system  proposed  for  the \nproject  and  the  existing  small-community  heating  boilers.  Economic  benefits  identified  for  the \nChengji road and flood control component and urban transport improvement component include \n(i) flood  risk  reductions,  (ii)  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs,  (iii)  time  savings,  (iv)  accident \ncost  reductions,  and  (v)  emission  reductions.  Not  readily  quantifiable  benefits  such  as  better \nhealth and increased employment were not included.12 \n\n                                                \n11  The  project  beneficiaries  include  640,000  urban  residents  of  whom  about  87,000  or  13.5%  are  poor.  District \nheating  will  benefit 345,000  people, and  urban  roads  and  flood control  will benefit  671,200  people.  There  will  be \n345,300 common beneficiaries. \n\n12 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f \n19. \nA  financial  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  of  the  revenue-generating  district  heating  component \nconfirmed financial  viability  by  concluding  that the component\u2019s financial internal  rate of return \n(9.1%) exceeded the weighted average cost of capital (1.85%). Heating tariffs currently account \nfor  about  2.2%\u20133.8%  of  an  average  household\u2019s  income  and  for  about  1.7%\u20133.9%  of  a  poor \nhousehold\u2019s income (post-subsidy),13 which is considered acceptable in view of better services \nand  related  health  benefits. 14  Moreover,  affordability  is  expected  to  improve  as  household \nincomes  increase  while  medium-term  heating  tariff  levels  are  held  constant.  A  sensitivity  and \nrisk analysis revealed that the component\u2019s financial internal rate of return is most sensitive to \nchanges  in  revenues  (mainly  tariffs)  and  operating  costs  (predominantly  hot  water  offtake \ncharges, which will comprise about 76% of operating costs). Hence, maintaining tariff levels and \ncontrolling offtake costs will be crucial in ensuring the component\u2019s financial viability. A financial \nanalysis  of  THC  evaluated  existing  tariff  and  cost-recovery  arrangements  and  concluded  that \nfull-cost recovery is unrealistic in the short term, without ongoing TMG subsidies. However, the \nproject will help transform THC\u2019s cost structure, enabling the company to achieve financial self-\nsustainability  in  the  medium  term.  The  Tianshui  Urban  Construction  &  Investment  Group  will \ncontribute counterpart funding, service loans, and shoulder operation and maintenance costs for \nthe  nonrevenue-generating  components.  A  fiscal  analysis  revealed  that,  although  TMG\u2019s  debt \nlevel has increased in the past 5 years in line with economic development, it remains relatively \nlow at less than 20% of total annual fiscal expenditures. The analysis also indicated that TMG\u2019s \ncontributions  to  the  project  will  not  exceed  4.0%  of  annual  expenditures,  with  total  estimated \ncontribution  of  1.6%  of  total  fiscal  expenditures  over  the  project  construction  period  (2011\u2013\n2015).  Therefore, \nfinancially \nsustainable and affordable. A financial management assessment concluded that, while TPMO, \nTianshui Urban Construction & Investment Group, and THC have strong financial management \ncapacity  and  large  project  management  experience,  they  are  relatively  inexperienced  in \nmanaging  ADB  projects.  Hence,  the  capacity  development  component  will  provide  ongoing \nsupport and training on ADB policies and procedures during project implementation. \n \nC. \n\nthe  nonrevenue-generating  components  are  considered \n\nGovernance \n\n20. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the TMG, TPMO, implementing agencies, and their project implementing units. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM, including providing \nsupport and training on ADB policies and procedures, engaging a tendering agent to strengthen \nprocurement, and involving the Tianshui Discipline Investigation Bureau in procurement. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n21. \nPoverty  and  social  benefits.  A  poverty  and  social  assessment  that  included  a \nhousehold survey,  community  and focus group discussions,  and key  informant  interviews  was \nconducted during project preparation. Gansu is one of the PRC\u2019s poorest and least-developed \nwestern  provinces  and  has  been  prioritized  in  national  development  plans.  The  project  will \ndirectly  benefit  over  640,000  urban  residents,  of  whom  approximately  13.5%  are  poor,  and \nabout  30,000  rural  residents  in  three  towns  surrounding  the  city\u2019s  urban  areas  by  improving \nliving  conditions,  public  health  standards,  and  Tianshui\u2019s  urban  environment.  The  project  will \ncreate 1,466 full-time jobs during the construction stage and 658 follow-on, multiplier-effect jobs. \n                                                \n13 Minimum  living  guarantee  system  recipients  (low-income  households)  are  eligible  for  a  CNY250  annual  heating \nsubsidy,  which  is  paid  by  the  Tianshui  municipal  and  Qinzhou  district  governments.  Presubsidy  heating  tariffs \naccount for about 3.2%\u20135.4% of a poor household\u2019s income. \n\n14 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n \n\n \n\nEmployment  targets  for  vulnerable  groups  and  women  are  included  in  the  design  and \nmonitoring  framework  and  loan  assurances.  Air  quality  and  traffic  improvements  through \nprovision of district heating services, development of the urban road network and improvements \nin NMT, and road safety and transport planning will enhance public health and safety. Improving \nthe  urban  road  and  bridge  network  will  boost  public  access  and  mobility  and  reduce  time \nburdens. A social development action plan and a gender action plan (GAP) have been prepared \nand will be implemented by TPMO and implementing agencies during project construction. The \nheating  component  will  improve  air  quality  and  district  heating  access,  but  the  closure  of  199 \nsmall  heating  boilers  will  also  result  in  323  formal  workers  losing  their  positions  and  439 \nseasonal positions being lost. A labor reemployment plan for these workers has been prepared \nthrough extensive consultation. It is supported by a loan assurance and will be implemented by \nTPMO and the implementing agencies.15 \n \n22. \nGender  benefits.  The  project  has  been  designed  for  classification  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming,  and  a  GAP  has  been  prepared  and  agreed.  Analysis  of  the  survey  and  focus \ngroup  discussion  data  reveal  that  women  are  disproportionately  affected  by  air  pollution  from \ninefficient  boilers  and  use  of  home-heating  stoves,  and  the  time  burden  of  caring  for  family \nmembers  suffering  from  respiratory  illnesses.  Women  are  also  largely  responsible  for  paying \nutility bills and managing the impact of increased costs on household budgets. Improvements to \nthe  urban  transport  network  and  attention  to  the  needs  of  women  in  the  planning  of  public \ntransport, pedestrian, NMT access, and road safety programs will also provide positive benefits \nby  reducing  time  burdens  and  increasing  access,  mobility,  and  safety.  The  GAP  includes \nspecific targets for women in employment, participation, and capacity-building opportunities, and \nis supported by a loan assurance and consultant support for implementation and monitoring. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n23. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  as  environment  category  A.  The  project \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  has  been  circulated  to  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  and \nwas  posted  on  the  ADB  website  on  20  December  2010.  It  concludes  that  the  project  has \nsubstantial  environmental  and  socioeconomic  benefits,  and  that  its  potential  environmental \nimpacts  can  be  mitigated  through  the  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan \n(EMP)  for  the  project.  The  completed  domestic  EIAs  (in  Chinese),  based  on  extensive  public \nconsultations, comply with ADB\u2019s policies and requirements, including ADB's Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009). The methods and standards applied in the preparation of domestic EIAs for \nthe project components are in accordance with the guidelines of the Ministry of Environmental \nProtection,  and  also  meet  national  and  provincial  laws  and  regulations.  Although  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  are  anticipated  during  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  project\u2014\npotential soil erosion, geological hazards, health and safety concerns caused by asbestos if no \nproper protection measures are taken, and increased traffic noise\u2014mitigation measures and the \nproject  EMP  are  expected  to  lessen  these  potential  impacts.  During  construction,  special \nattention will be paid to soil erosion protection, protection of surface water quality, occupational \nand  community  health  and  safety,  and  adequate  disposal  of  de-construction  waste.  During \noperation,  special  attention  will  be  paid  to  traffic  noise,  geological  hazards  such  as  mud-  and \nlandslides,  and  risks  of  spills  during  transportation  of  hazardous  and  toxic  goods  on  project \nroads and bridges. The project\u2019s district heating component will significantly contribute to energy \nsaving and GHG emission reductions, as well as improving residents\u2019 living conditions and the \nlocal environment; the urban transport component will help the  city establish an efficient, safe, \nand  sustainable  urban  transport  system  that  includes  facilities  for  public  transport,  pedestrian \n\n                                                \n15 The resettlement plan for the Qinzhou district heating network component includes the labor reemployment plan. \n\n\fcrossings, traffic management, and landscaping, which will benefit the local economy and local \nresidents, and will contribute to vehicle emission reduction; and the flood control component will \npromote the river embankment to the 100-year flood protection standard so that the entire urban \narea will be adequately protected from flooding. The Tianshui Environmental Protection Bureau \nwill  support  the  executing  agency  and  the  implementing  agencies  in  implementing  the  project \nEMP. Capacity building in environmental management will be provided for the executing agency \nand  the  implementing  agencies.  The  executing  agency  disclosed  relevant  environment \ninformation  to  the  affected  people  through  consultations  during  April\u2013October  2010,  and  the \nresults and findings were used to modify the domestic EIAs and the project design. \n \n24. \nResettlement. The project is classified as resettlement category A, since construction of \nthe  project\u2019s  subcomponents  will  necessitate  significant  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  In \ntotal,  the  project  will  affect  17  village  committees  or  community  committees,  2  towns,  2  street \noffices,  and  2  districts  of  Tianshui  City.16 A  total  of  1,041.32  mu17 of  land  will  be  permanently \nacquired  and  170  mu  of  land  will  be  temporarily  occupied  during  project  implementation.  The \nmain  land  loss  relates  to  construction  of  the  Chengji  road  and  flood  control  facilities.  Land \nacquisition will affect 1,225 households and 5,593 persons. A total of 66,249 m2 of houses and \nbuildings will be demolished, adversely impacting 416 households, 1,567 persons, and 70 small \nenterprises  or  institutions.  These  affected  persons  will  benefit  from  the  project  through,  for \ninstance,  improved  air  quality  and  transport  access.  The  TPMO  and  the  two  implementing \nagencies  will  assume  the  overall  responsibility  of  planning,  implementation,  financing,  and \nreporting  on  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities.  Two  resettlement  plans  have  been \nprepared  for  the  project,  have  been  endorsed  by  the  executing  agency  and  implementing \nagencies,  and  have  been  disclosed  to  affected  people  in  local  languages.  The  resettlement \nplans will be updated based on the final design and detailed measurement survey, disclosed to \naffected  persons  in  local  language  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval  before \nawarding  civil  works  contracts.  A  grievance  procedure  has  been  established  for  the  affected \npersons.  The  TPMO  will  submit  an  internal  monitoring  report  semiannually  to  ADB  on  the \nprogress  of  resettlement  implementation.  The  TPMO  will  also  employ  an  external  monitoring \ninstitute  or  firm  that  will  submit  semiannual  monitoring  reports  to  ADB  during  resettlement \nimplementation, and annually for 2 years after resettlement completion. \n \nIndigenous peoples. The project is classified as indigenous peoples category C, as the \n25. \nproject areas have low numbers of ethnic minority residents (1.58% of the population) who are \nintegrated economically and socially into the broader society. No adverse impacts from actions \nsuch as resettlement or land acquisition, particularly on ethnic minorities, were identified. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n26.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.18 The project has no unusual technical risks. \nThe project\u2019s integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh costs and risks. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n16 ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) trigger for involuntary resettlement changed the terminology of \"affected \npersons\" to \"displaced persons\", which is defined as persons who are physically and/or economically displaced as \na result of involuntary acquisition of land or involuntary restrictions on land use or on access to legally designated \nparks  and  protected  areas.  In  the  PRC,  although  the  resettlement  plans  maintain  the  original  terminology  of \n\"affected persons\u201d, the definition is equivalent to ADB's definition of \"displaced persons\u201d. \n\n17 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 m2).  \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nHot water is not available to \nthe newly developed district \nheating network because \nCHP construction is either not \napproved or is delayed. \n\nLack of project coordination \nand synchronization between \nagencies \nDelays in land acquisition \napprovals and implementation \n\nLack of sustainable O&M of \ninfrastructure components \n\nMitigating Measures \n\n(i) ADB will closely monitor CHP preparations through regular \ncommunications and review missions. \n(ii) Funds for the district heating component will not be disbursed until \nthe CHP and transmission pipelines have been approved. \n(iii) ADB will require assurance that CHP is commissioned at least \n3 months prior to the heating network. \n(i) Coordination support from the project implementation consultants. \n(ii) Close project monitoring, frequent site inspections, and regular \ncoordination meetings. \n(i) Expeditious implementation of detailed measurement surveys. \n(ii) Early availability of compensation funding for affected persons. \n(iii) Strict operational compliance with resettlement plans. \n(i) Long-term capacity building at the heating company and \nimplementation of road maintenance improvements. \n(ii) Assurances regarding budget provisions for O&M. \nEarly mobilization of tendering agent and implementation consultants to \nprovide technical support, combined with ongoing training. \n\nDifficulties in complying with \nADB procedures \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CHP = combined heat and power plant, O&M = operation and maintenance,  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITION \n\n27. \nThe  government  and  TMG  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the  PAM  and loan documents. The government  has  agreed with  ADB  on certain  covenants \nfor the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \n \n28. \nDisbursement of loan proceeds for output 1 will be conditional on (i) approval of the CHP \npreapproval application, (ii) provision to ADB of the approved feasibility study reports and EIAs \nfor the CHP and transmission pipelines, and (iii) TMG engaging a licensed institute to conduct \nan asbestos risk assessment for all small boilers affected by the project. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n29. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$100,000,000  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Gansu  Tianshui  Urban  Infrastructure \nDevelopment  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof  25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n7 June 2011 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \nBetter living \nconditions in \nTianshui \nmunicipality \n\nOutcome \nImproved \nheating, \ntransport, and \nflood control \nservices in \nTianshui \nmunicipality \n\nOutputs \n1.
