It complements previous Asian Development Bank (ADB) development initiatives in \nthe health sector in Mongolia. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nThe  project  builds  on  previous  health  sector  development  initiatives  to  continue \n3. \nreforming the Mongolian health sector, including health care financing, in line with the National \nDevelopment Strategy and the government\u2019s Health Sector Master Plan (2006\u20132015). The ADB \nIndependent  Evaluation  Department\u2019s  sector  recommendations1  emphasize  the  need  for \nstructural  changes  in  health  care  delivery  by  rationalizing  excess  hospital  capacity  at  the \nsecondary  and  tertiary  level,  particularly  in  Ulaanbaatar.  The  project  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan (2009\u20132012)2 and country partnership strategy (2010\u20132015, in \npreparation). The project is in line with Strategy 20203 and the Operational Plan for Health,4 in \naddressing  sector  governance  issues  and  promoting  more  efficient  allocation  of  health \nresources.  \n \n4. \nADB  is  the  largest  external  financier  to  the  health  sector,  and  plays  a  pivotal  role  in \nassisting the government to formulate and implement health sector reforms. Support from other \npartners  tends  to  focus  on  assisting  the  government  to  address  particular  diseases  or  to \ndevelop certain programs. ADB works in close consultation with these partners and, to improve \naid  effectiveness,  efforts  are  made  to  support  the  implementation  of  the  Health  Sector  Master \nPlan.  Efforts  are  underway  under  the  leadership  of  the  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH)  and  in \ncoordination  with  other  development  partners  in  the  sector  to  evolve  gradually  toward  more \nsector-based assistance. The World Health Organization is providing parallel cofinancing for the \nproject. \n \n5. \nThe  hospital  sector  absorbs  the  bulk  of  the  MOH  budget  and  is  characterized  by \nexcessive  capacity,  inefficiencies,  fragmentation,  and  lack  of  quality  services.  Mongolia  has \nmoved  from  a  health  service  based  on  the  Semashko5  model  of  polyclinics  and  mono-profile \nspecialist  hospitals6  to  a  focus  on  primary  health  care  provided  by  family  doctors  working  in \nfamily group practices. Public secondary and tertiary care in Ulaanbaatar is provided by over 50 \nhospitals. Six mono-profile hospitals managed by the MOH provide tertiary and secondary care \nin cancer, traumatology and orthopedics, psychiatry, dermatology, pediatrics, and maternal and \nchild care. The MOH also manages three multifunctional hospitals that provide a wide range of \nsecondary  and  some  tertiary  services.  District  hospitals,  under  the  Ulaanbaatar  City  Mayor\u2019s \nOffice, provide a limited range of services, mainly internal medicine and neurology services. The \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Mongolia Country Assistance Program Evaluation: From Transition to Takeoff. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2009.

Strategy  2020:  The  Long-Term  Strategic  Framework  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  2008\u20132020. \n\nManila. \n\n4  ADB. 2008. An Operational Plan for Improving Health Access and Outcomes under Strategy 2020. Manila. \n5  The  Semashko  model  was  a  Soviet-style  centralized  and  hierarchical  health  system  with  strong  emphasis  on \n\nexpensive curative services and hospital-based physicians in extensive and numerous facilities. \n\n6  Mono-profile hospitals provide specialized care (e.g., maternal care, pediatrics, traumatology); this can be justified, \n\nbut in Mongolia it leads to fragmentation of care, making it difficult for patients to be served efficiently. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ndeficient quality of services at the primary level and the weakness of the district hospital system \nresult  in  patients  seeking  care  at  the  tertiary  level  where  lower-level  services  are  provided  at \nhigher costs.   \n \n6. \nThere  is  a  rapidly  growing  and  poorly  regulated  private  health  sector  consisting  of \nhospitals, clinics, laboratories, and pharmacies, primarily concentrated in Ulaanbaatar. Hospital \nbuildings  and  equipment  in  the  public  and  private  sectors  are  generally  in  poor  condition. \nPatients stay too long in hospitals and there are many inappropriate admissions. The training of \nspecialist medical staff is not up to international good practice standards and the management \nof the hospital sector is weak. Increasing investments in the hospital sector are expected as the \neconomic  outlook  for  Mongolia  is  promising.  The  challenge  is  to  ensure  that  investments  are \nused efficiently to improve accessibility and service quality.  \n \nThe cost of reforming the hospital sector in Ulaanbaatar is estimated at $450 million.7 A \n7. \ncentral question is how to use the limited budget available to the project strategically to ensure \nan  efficient  use  of  future  investments.  A  vision,  a  hospital  policy,  and  a  clear  hospital  reform \nplan  for  Ulaanbaatar  (including  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  reforms;  capacity  building \nneeds; and potential financing sources) are lacking. Decision makers have little understanding \nof  how  to  improve  hospital  sector  management,  rationalize  hospital  services,  and  how  to  turn \ndistrict hospitals into multiprofile hospitals.8   \n \n8. \nMongolia suffers from illegal importation of drugs and the circulation of substandard and \ncounterfeit  medicines.  Drug  regulatory  functions  are  fragmented  and  local  drug  manufacturers \ndo not comply with good manufacturing practices. Public information, drug promotion, and post-\nmarketing  surveillance  are  significantly  underdeveloped.  The  social  and  economic  costs  of \nunsafe drugs are high and there is little awareness among decision makers. Drug safety needs \ngovernment  intervention  as  market  forces  alone  will  not  solve  the  problem.  Mongolia  requires \ninvestments and technical support as domestic skills in the area of drug safety are scarce. \n \n9. \nThe need to reform the hospital sector has been identified for more than 10 years (with \nlittle achievement), although it is clearly reflected in the government\u2019s Health Sector Master Plan \n(2006\u20132015).  In  1997,  under  the  Health  Sector  Development  Program,9  ADB  provided  initial \nsupport  for  critical  changes  in  the  Mongolian  health  care  system.  A  key  achievement  of  this \nprogram includes developing the family group practice system10 as a means of transforming the \nhealth  system  towards  primary  health  care.  However,  the  government's  low  commitment  and \ndetermination  to  rationalize  hospitals  and  staffing  resulted  in  continued  limited  budget \nallocations  for  primary  health  care  and  limited  system  efficiency.11  From  2004  to  2009,  ADB \nsupport through the Second Health Sector Development Project12 focused on improving access \nto quality health services in rural areas and extending reforms initiated under the program, but \nprogress in the areas of hospital rationalization and career development was mixed under the \nproject.13  In  the  hospital  sector,  the  ongoing  Third  Health  Sector  Development  Project14 \n\n                                                 \n7  Communication from consultant team of ADB. 2009.

Manila. \n\n\fsupports  the  autonomization  of  public  hospitals  and  improved  regulation  of  private  hospitals. \nThe  strategy  of  the  Fourth  Health  Sector  Development  Project  will  differ  from  previous \napproaches  in  tackling  the  problem  of  hospital  sector  reform  at  a  more  macro  level  by  (i) \nassisting  the  government  in  preparing  its  first  hospital  development  policy,  (ii)  preparing  a \nstrategic hospital reform plan for Ulaanbaatar, and (iii) developing a model hospital to advocate \nfor change. \n \n10. \nThe  prospects  for  meaningful  health  sector  reform  are  greater  now  than  at  any  time  in \nthe  past  because  (i)  public\u2013private  partnerships  to  tap  capital  and  management  for  the  health \nsystem  are  now  possible,15  (ii)  public  demand  for  reform  is mounting,  and  (iii)  political  leaders \nare  starting  to  recognize  the  urgency  of  improving  the  hospital  system.  The  project  will  assist \nMongolia  in  preparing  future  reforms  and  ensuring  decent  socioeconomic  returns  on  future \ninvestments. The project will improve governance in the sector by improving public investment \nplanning,  providing  decent  and  efficient  hospital  services,  protecting  the  population  against \ncounterfeit and substandard drugs, and facilitating the public's access to information on hospital \nperformance and drug safety. At the same time, hospital reforms give the government a unique \nopportunity to establish public\u2013private collaboration for the benefit of the population. The project \nwill  deliver  tangible  benefits  to  women  by  ensuring  their  active  participation  in  institutional \nprocesses to reform the hospital and drug safety subsectors. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n11. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  to  improve  the  health  status  of  the  Mongolian \npopulation,  including  the  poor.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  health  sector  efficiency, \ngovernance, and drug safety.16 \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe project will have three components with the following outputs: \n\n12. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nComponent  1:  Strengthened  hospital  services  in  Ulaanbaatar.  As  part  of \nreforming the hospital sector, the project will assist the government in preparing a \nhospital  development  policy  and  strategic  plan  for  Ulaanbaatar  (including  legal, \nregulatory,  and  institutional  reforms;  capacity  building  needs;  and  potential \nfinancing  resources)  and  will  develop  a  hospital  capital  planning  system.  The \nSonginohairkhan  district  hospital  of  Ulaanbaatar  will  be \ninto  a \nmultifunctional  general  hospital  that  will  provide  quality  services  to  the  district \npopulation  and  serve  as  a  demonstration  hospital  for  other  districts  in  the  city. \nHospital  governance  will  be  improved  through  reforms  to  the  hospital  licensing \nsystem  and  by  ensuring  the  public  is  provided  with  information  on  hospital \nperformances. \nComponent 2:  Strengthened  human  resource  development.  The  project  will \nstrengthen  the  postgraduate  specialist  structure  and  residency  training  to \naddress the fragmentation and poor quality of postgraduate programs. A hospital \nmanagement  module  will  be  developed  and  included  among  the  programs \noffered by a local training institution. \n\nturned \n\n                                                 \n15 The  Parliament  approved  the  public-private  partnership  policy  and  the  law  on  concessions  in  January  2010.  The \nState Property Agency in charge of the implementation of the policy selected priority activities in the health sector \n(outsourcing of hospital services and private management contracts of family group practices) to demonstrate the \nfeasibility of a public-private partnership approach in the sector. \n\n16  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n(iii) \n\nComponent  3:  Strengthened  drug  safety  regime.  This  component  will \nincrease  access  to  safer  drugs  nationwide  in  a  country  that  imports  most  of  its \npharmaceuticals and has a poor pharmaceutical safety track record. The project \nwill  assist  the  government  in  establishing  a  drug  regulatory  authority  and \nstrengthening regulatory functions to improve coordination and quality. The drug \ncontrol  laboratory17  will  be  upgraded  to  international  standards  (including  the \nprovision of equipment, processes, capacity building, and information technology \nservices).  The  project  will  upgrade  the  standards  of  good  manufacturing \nprocesses  and  support  local  drug  manufacturers  to  meet  the  standards.  Drug \nsafety governance will be strengthened through regular annual overviews of drug \nsafety  indicators  and  achievements  under  the  MOH  and  by  improving  public \ninformation on drug safety. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n \nD. \n \n13. \nincluding  physical  and  price \ncontingencies, and total taxes and duties of $0.4 million.

The amount of taxes and duties to \nbe  financed  does  not  represent  an  excessive  share  of  the  project  investment  plan.  The  financing  of  taxes  and \nduties is material and relevant to the success of the project. The taxes and duties to be financed apply only  with \nrespect to ADB-financed expenditures. \n\n  Equipment and materials to be financed out of the proceeds of the grant include transportation and insurance. \n  A country's eligibility for Asian Development Fund grants under the revised grants framework is determined by its \nrisk of debt distress. The latest debt sustainability analysis determined that Mongolia had a moderate risk of debt \ndistress and was therefore eligible to receive 50% of its overall Asian Development Fund allocation as grants.  \n\n \n\n\f15. \nThe total project cost of $18.15 million will be financed by an Asian Development Fund \ngrant  of  $14  million.

The \nanalysis  covers  the  macroeconomic  context  to  review  the  potential  for  the  government  to \ncontinue to finance the project activities in the longer term following project completion. For the \nproject,  the  analysis  covers  the  quantifiable  economic  costs  and  benefits  for  the  improved \nhospital  component  and  provides  qualitative  analysis  of  the  improved  drug  safety  component. \n\n\freduction \n\nto  patients \n\nfor  out-of-pocket  costs,  and \n\nThe economic impact of unsafe medicine is difficult to quantify because there are a number of \nunknown  variables  involved.  Using  conservative  estimates  of  project  implementation,  the \nbaseline  results  show  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  11.75%,  reflecting \nsubstantial  unquantifiable  economic  benefits  for  the  drug  safety  component  and  the  relatively \nsmall population catchment for the benefits attached to the hospital improvement component.21 \nThe EIRR was tested through sensitivity analysis using a 20% decrease in economic benefits as \nthe worst-case scenario for each of the economic benefits relating to hospital efficiency savings, \nsavings \nin  projected  productivity \nimprovements.  Under  these  conservative  assumptions,  the  EIRRs  are  9.73%  for  reduced \nhospital  efficiency  savings,  10.97%  for  reductions  in  patient  savings,  and  10.93%  where \nunderachieved productivity gains are projected. The project is considered economically viable.  \n \n19. \nThe project has no revenue-earning components, hence financial cost benefits were not \nanalyzed as part of the financial analysis. The MOH, the Ulaanbaatar City Health Department, \nand  the  General  Agency  for  Specialized  Inspection  (GASI)  will  contribute  counterpart  funding \nand shoulder the project\u2019s operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. A fiscal analysis indicated \nthat  the  MOH\u2019s  annual  average  contribution  to  the  project  is  0.5%  of  the  health  sector  annual \nbudget. The annual O&M cost, to be borne by GASI, will not exceed 1.4% of its current revenue \nand  additional  O&M  costs  required  by  the  Ulaanbaatar  City  Health  Department  for  the \ndemonstration  hospital  will  not  be  more  than  0.7%  of  its  current  expenditure.  The  counterpart \nfunding and O&M costs are considered both financially sustainable and affordable. A financial \nmanagement  assessment  concluded  that  the  MOH  is  experienced  in  managing  ADB  projects \nand is prepared for project implementation. The financial management analysis identified issues \nthat will be addressed through the maintenance of project accounts by a project implementation \nunit (PIU) dedicated to the project and through external audits for the project duration.   \n  \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\nThe MOH is a long-term partner of ADB, actively involved in implementing health sector \n20. \ndevelopment  projects  since  1991.  A  PIU  was  established  as  part  of  the  ongoing  Third  Health \nSector  Development  Project  and  this  arrangement  will  be  expanded  to  incorporate  the \nimplementation of the Fourth Health Sector Development Project. \n \n21. \nA  procurement  capability  assessment  conducted  for  the  executing  agency  and  PIU \nconfirmed  their  general  ability  to  conduct  procurement  in  compliance  with  ADB  policy  and \nprocedural requirements and the relevant national laws and regulations on public procurement. \nThe  implementing  agencies  have  no  recent  procurement  experience  using  ADB  policies  and \nprocedural requirements. Therefore, all procurement under the project will be carried out by the \nexecuting agency and coordinated by the PIU. \n \nthe \n22. \nUlaanbaatar City Mayor\u2019s Office, and GASI. The assessment for the MOH and its PIU updated \nthe  assessment  carried  out  as  part  of  the  project  planning  for  the  Third  Health  Sector \nDevelopment Project. All three agencies have adequate accounting professionals equipped with \ncomputerized  financial  accounting  and  reporting  systems  and  procedures  on  the  flow  of \naccounting, financial, and project physical progress related to their current project activities. All \nthe agencies have clearly defined responsibilities with accountability allocated to different units \nat different levels of authority within their institutions.  \n \n\nFinancial  management  assessments  have  been  conducted \n\nthe  MOH, \n\nfor \n\n                                                 \n21 ADB.  2003.  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.  Operations  Manual.  OM  G1/OP.  Manila  (B.[vi][b])  states  that  a  low \n\nEIRR is acceptable when there are substantial unquantifiable benefits. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n23. \nAnnual  audits  for  the  project  will  be  arranged  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  The  financial \nmanagement assessment concluded that, in general, the current financial management system \nin  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  can  meet  the  requirements  of  the  government  in \nterms  of  staffing,  accounting,  and  internal  control.  The  PIU  will  recruit  additional  technical \nsupport for hospital planning and drug safety to strengthen its capacity to implement the project \nin compliance with the policy, operation, and procedural requirements of ADB.  \n \n24. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  of  Mongolia  and  the  MOH.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nthe \nThe  project  will  directly  benefit  over  250,000  mostly  poor  residents  of \n25. \nSonginohairkhan district of Ulaanbaatar by improving district hospital services. The project will \nalso  benefit  the  entire  population  of  Mongolia  by  improving  access  to  safer  drugs,  and,  in  the \nlong run, will improve allocative efficiency in the health sector by optimizing the use of hospital \nservices and improving the return on future investment in the hospital sector. Improving both the \ncountry\u2019s  health  services  and  the  health  status  of  the  population  will  lead  to  a  reduction  in \nhousehold  expenditures  and  time  spent  seeking  care.  Mongolia\u2019s  extensive  social  safety  net \nsystem  accounted  for  approximately  12%  of  gross  domestic  product  per  year  until  2008  (it  is \ncurrently  being  reformed),  of  which  40%  was  devoted  to  social  assistance  to  the  poor  and \ndisadvantaged. Poverty and health are strongly related, and better health services are not only \na  social  goal  but  also  a  prerequisite  to  economic  development.  Improved  health  care  will \ntherefore  expand  the  economic  opportunities  of  the  whole  population,  including  the  poor. \nReliable  health  services  will  reduce  lifecycle  risks  to  the  individual,  including  illness,  injury, \ndisability,  and  early  death,  thereby  also  reducing  impoverishment.  The  poor  will  benefit \nparticularly from the project\u2019s drug safety activities as they are currently more likely to purchase \nand consume substandard pharmaceuticals.  \n \n26. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  \u201ceffective  gender  mainstreaming.\u201d  In  Mongolia,  the  health \nstatus of the population is highly differentiated by gender. The male mortality rate in Mongolia is \nhigh,  and  the  male  life  expectancy  is  low  compared  with  females,  due  primarily  to  unhealthy \nlifestyle habits such as smoking and heavy drinking. Women comprise the majority of users and \nproviders of the health care system in Mongolia, and one out of five households in urban areas \nin Mongolia is headed by a woman.22 Women provide the majority of care for ill family members. \nThe  vast  majority  of  the  country\u2019s  total  medical  staff  is  composed  of  women.  A  gender  action \nplan has been developed for the project to ensure that gender is mainstreamed. Women at all \nlevels will participate in institutional processes to reform the hospital and drug safety subsectors. \nThe  MOH  has  ensured  that  the  gender  action  plan  agreed  upon  under  the  project  will  be \nimplemented in a timely manner. \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\nThe environmental categorization of the project is B. An environmental assessment has \n27. \nbeen carried out in accordance with the Mongolia regulatory framework and ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009).  A  consolidated  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  report  was \nprepared,  which  assesses  and  addresses  the  environmental  implications  of  the  rehabilitation \nand  expansion  of  the  Songinohairkhan  District  Hospital  and  the  New  Central  Laboratory.  The \nteam and project counterparts agreed to specify the whole laboratory building as an associated \n\n                                                 \n22 National Statistics Office. 2008. 2007/2008 Household Socio-Economic Survey. Ulaanbaatar. \n\n\ffacility.23  This  allowed  conducting  necessary  due  diligence  for  the  building,  resulting  in  the \nconduct  of  the  necessary  domestic  environmental  assessment,  ensuring  compliance  with  the \nMongolian  law.  The  consolidated  IEE  summarizes  the  findings  of  the  New  Central  Laboratory \nEnvironmental  Impact  Assessment  (EIA)  and  the  Songinohairkhan  District  Hospital  Initial \nEnvironmental  Examination  (IEE),  and  a  due  diligence  review  of  project  associated  facilities. \nPotential adverse impacts during the construction and operation phase include limited standard \nconstruction impacts; and occupational and community health and safety issues, especially the \nunsafe  collection,  storage,  treatment,  and  disposal  of  medical  and  chemical  hazardous  waste. \nThe  possible  adverse  environmental  impacts  will  be  prevented  or  minimized  to  acceptable \nlevels, through the implementation of the environmental management plan (EMP) that includes \nadequate  mitigation  and  monitoring  arrangements.  The  environmental  assessment  process \nachieved significant value added by (i) catalyzing, through policy dialog with MNET and GASI, \nthe  development  of  an  EIA  for  the  project\u2019s  associated  new  central  laboratory  building;  (ii) \ndeveloping  comprehensive  management  systems  for  the  collection,  storage,  and  treatment  of \nmedical  and  hazardous  chemical  waste;  and  (iii)  developing  a  substantial  consolidated  IEE \nreport  which  defines  environmental  mitigation  measures,  monitoring  requirements,  institutional \nresponsibilities, and training and capacity building requirements. \n \n28. \nNo  involuntary  resettlement  effects  are  foreseen  and  the  project  is  classified  as  a \ncategory  C  project.  The  upgrading  of  the  facilities  of  the  multifunctional  hospital  will  be  on \nexisting  government  land  and  will  not  affect  local  residents  or  residential  buildings.  A \nresettlement  plan  and  framework  are  therefore  not  required.  Should  there  be  any  change  in \nscope or other changes with unanticipated resettlement impacts during project implementation, \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  project  will  not  have  any  negative  impact  on  indigenous \npeoples  and  is  therefore  classified  as  a  category  C  project.  No  further  actions  are  therefore \nrequired. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n29. \nThe overall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs and risks involved. \nMajor risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.24 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nResistance  to  change  from  key  staff  groups \n(e.g.,  hospital  specialists),  agencies  (e.g.,  the \nState  Specialized  Inspection  Agency),  sectors \n(e.g., private hospitals), and the community \n\nLack of government and community support for \nhospital reform \n\nstrategy  with \n\nMitigating Measures \nKey  staff,  agencies,  and  sectors  will  obtain \nconsensus  for  the  project\u2019s  implementation. \nKey mitigation measures will consist of a strong \ncommunication \ninformation \ncampaigns,  awareness  raising,  and  training \nactivities,  providing \nto  counter \nresistance  (e.g.,  capacity  building,  promotion), \nand \nneeds \nassessment and planning. \nThe  project  will  mitigate  this  risk  through \ncontinuing policy dialogue with the government \nand  donor  community  in  the  context  of  the \nHealth  Sector  Strategic  Master  Plan.
