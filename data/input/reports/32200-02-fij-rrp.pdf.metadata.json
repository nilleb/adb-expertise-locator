Environmental  monitoring  and  management  plans, \nincorporated  into  civil  works  contracts,  are  being  implemented \neffectively  and  are  monitored  by  an  environment  officer  of  the \nWater and Sewerage Department (WSD). \n \nThe Project comprises two components: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nComponent  A:  provision  of  water  and  sewerage \nfacilities. \nComponent B: institutional reforms and development to \nassist the transition of the water and sewerage division \nof the Ministry of Public Utilities, Works and Transport \ninto an independent utility.  \n\n \nThe Project is well advanced, but is subject to cost overruns. The \nsupplementary loan will finance seven project components, which \nhave not been procured yet. \n \nThe Suva\u2013Nausori regional water supply system supplies water to \nabout 332,000 people (or 98% of the population) living within the \nSuva\u2013Nausori  area.  When  the  Project  was  appraised  in  2003, \nconsumers  throughout  the  service  area\u2014particularly  those  living \nat  the  edges  of  the  water  supply  network\u2014were  subject  to \nfrequent supply disruptions, primarily because of dilapidated water \ntreatment  and  distribution  assets.  Unaccounted-for  water  was \nestimated  at  55%.  The  water  transmission  and  distribution \nsystems \nimprove  distribution  and \nminimize losses. \n \nMany of the Suva\u2013Nausori regional sewerage system assets were \nalso  dilapidated.  In  central  Suva,  anecdotal  evidence  suggested \ninflow  and  infiltration  could  be  as  high  as  90%  in  wet  weather. \nLeaks  from  the  sewers  and  frequent  overflows  from  poorly \nmaintained  sewage  pump  stations  have  contributed  to  the \ndegradation of the aquatic ecosystems of the urban streams and \ncoastal foreshore, and pose a risk to human health. \n \nThe  institutional  arrangements  for  the  delivery  of  water  and \nsewerage  services  to  urban  centers  are  not  conducive  to  a  high \n\nrequired  optimization \n\nto \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \n\nthe  Government  asked  ADB \n\nlevel of service to consumers, and are not financially sustainable. \nThe Government\u2019s Strategic Plan, 2003\u20132005 and the Ministry of \nPublic Utilities, Works and Transport (MPUWT) corporate plan for \n2002  provided  a  framework  for  corporatization  of  water  and \nsewerage services. The framework proposed the reorganization of \nthe  water  and  sewerage  section  of  MPUWT  into  an  autonomous \nwater and sewerage corporation.  \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  a  loan  of  $47 \nmillion from its ordinary capital resources on 8 December 2003 for \nthe  Suva\u2013Nausori  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  Project.  In \nJanuary  2009, \nto  provide \nsupplementary financing to cover anticipated cost overruns for the \nProject  caused  by  factors  beyond  the  control  of  the  interim \nGovernment,  including  rising  global  commodity  prices  and  the \ndepreciation  of  the  US  dollar  against  regional  currencies.  As \ncontracts  are  usually  denominated  in  US  dollars,  its  depreciation \nresulted  in  construction  costs  that  were  substantially  higher  than \nestimated when the Project was appraised. \n \nThe  original  project  rationale  remains  valid  as  the  provision  of \nreliable and sustainable water supply and sewerage services, and \nimprovement \nin  public  and  environmental  health,  are  high \npriorities of the Government and major concerns of the people of \nthe  Fiji  Islands.  The  Project  supports  the  development  policy \nobjectives  articulated \nthe  Government\u2019s  draft  Strategic \nDevelopment  Plan,  2007\u20132011.  The  Project  also  supports  ADB\u2019s \nWater Policy by (i) improving and expanding the delivery of water \nand  sewerage  services,  and  (ii)  increasing  water  and  sewerage \nservice efficiency and sustainability through institutional reforms. \n \nThe economic analysis of the Project has been redone and shows \nthat it remains economically viable despite the cost overruns. \n \nThe Project is contributing to better living standards in the Suva\u2013\nNausori  Region,  particularly  for  the  urban  poor.  Outcomes  from \nthe Project include (i) increased delivery of safe water supply and \nsewerage services in the Suva\u2013Nausori area through physical and \ninstitutional  improvements,  and  (ii)  enhanced  sustainability  of \nwater  supply  and  sewerage  services  throughout  the  Fiji  Islands \nthrough institutional reforms. \n \nThe  revised  project  cost  estimate  is  $100.12  million,  including \ntaxes  and  duties  of  $13.25  million.  The  project  cost  overrun  is \nestimated to be $27.74 million, including taxes and duties of $4.65 \nmillion. \n \n\nin \n\n\fSupplementary \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\niii\n\nA loan of $23.0 million from the ordinary capital resources of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The \nloan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, \nan  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%,  and  such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \nThe loan will be provided to the Republic of the Fiji Islands. \n\n \n30 June 2012 \n\nthrough  a \n\n \nThe  Ministry  of  Public  Utilities,  a  division  of  MPUWT,  will  remain \nthe executing and implementing agency for the Project.  \n \nAll procurement to be financed by the ADB loan will be carried out \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  Civil  works  procurement  will  follow \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures  and  ADB's  standard \nbidding documents. \n \nFour separate consulting services contracts will be financed under \nthe supplementary loan to assist the Government to: (i) implement \nthe water loss reduction program; (ii) implement the leak detection \ntraining  program;  (iii)  implement  the  environmental  monitoring \nprogram;  and  (iv)  technical  support  to  the  project  management \nin \nunit.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited \naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  using  quality-  and  cost-\nbased selection procedures with a quality and cost ratio of 80:20. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  water  supply  component  will  help  reduce  health \nrisks, such as infantile diarrhea, caused by the lack of water and \ncontamination  of  water  arising  from  low  pressure  in  the  piped \nsystem.  It  will  also  provide  water  for  cooking,  washing,  and \nbathing,  and  reduce  the  need  to  boil  water.  Improvements  in \nsewage  disposal  will  help  prevent  contamination  of  waterways, \nbenefiting  the  poorest  people  who  live  in  swampy,  low-lying, \nthese \npoorly  draining  areas  near \ncommunities  use  urban  streams  and  the  coastal  foreshore  for \nfishing and supplementing their food sources. The environmental \nbenefits  of  the  Project\u2019s  sewerage  component  will  improve  the \nquality of life of the poorest people. Because of the global financial \ncrisis  and  recent  political  events  in  the  Fiji  Islands,  more \nhouseholds in the Suva\u2013Nausori area are facing hardship. \n \nThe  economic  analyses  on  the  project  components  were  redone \nto  include  the  cost  overruns.

Approval  of  the  loan  was  delayed  following  the  coup  of  May \n2000. The Project is the first phase of a longer-term water supply and sewerage improvement \nstrategy. The Loan Agreement was signed on 5 August 2004 and the loan became effective on \n8 December 2004. \n \n3. \nIn  January  2009,  the  Government  asked  ADB  to  provide  supplementary  financing  to \ncover anticipated cost overruns caused by factors beyond the control of the interim Government, \nincluding  rising  global  commodity  prices  and  the  depreciation  of  the  US  dollar  against  regional \ncurrencies.  As  contracts  are  usually  denominated  in  US  dollars,  its  depreciation  resulted  in \nconstruction costs that were substantially higher than estimated when the Project was appraised. \nIf  the  Project  is  not  completed,  it  will  not  deliver  the  intended  benefits  to  the  poor\u2014improved \naccess to water and sanitation services. This would have consequences for (i) the Fiji Islands, in \nterms  of  worsening  poverty;  and  (ii)  ADB,  in  terms  of  reputation  risk  associated  with  failing  to \nreach desired development outputs and outcomes. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE APPROVED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Rationale \n\nThe Suva\u2013Nausori regional water supply system supplies water to about 332,000 people \n4. \n(or 98% of the population) living within the Suva\u2013Nausori area. When the Project was appraised \nin  2003,  consumers  throughout  the  service  area\u2014particularly  those  living  at  the  edges  of  the \nwater supply network\u2014were subject to frequent water supply disruptions, primarily because of \npump  equipment  failure  and  burst  water  supply  mains.  The  water  supply  network  was  and \nremains  subject  to  substantial  losses.  Unaccounted-for  water  is  estimated  at  55%.  The  area's \ntwo water treatment plants at Tamavua and Waila required rehabilitation to improve the quality \nand  quantity  of  treated  water.  The  water  transmission  and  distribution  systems  required \noptimization  to  distribute  the  produced  water  better  to  service  areas  in  relation  to  relative \ndemand for water. \n \n5. \nThe  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  system  faces  similar  issues.  In  central  Suva, \nanecdotal evidence suggested inflow and infiltration accounted for up to 90% of the sewer flows \nduring wet weather. High tide also resulted in higher flows and salinity levels within the sewer \nsystem,  which  reduced  the  efficiency  of  the  area's  sewage  treatment  plants  and  substantially \n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2003.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  and \nTechnical Assistance Grant to the Republic of the Fiji Islands for the Suva\u2013Nausori Water Supply and Sewerage \nProject. Manila (Loan 2055-FIJ). \n\n2   ADB.  1998.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  the  Fiji  Islands  for  the  Suva\u2013Nausori  Water  Supply  and \n\nSewerage Project. Manila (TA 3055-FIJ, approved 18 August, for $800,000). \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nincreased  the  costs  of  conveying  sewage  to  the  plants.  Pipes  subject  to  inflow  and  infiltration \nare  also  subject  to  exfiltration  (leakage  of  sewage  into  the  environment).  Exfiltration  and \nfrequent  overflows  resulted  from  poorly  maintained  sewage  pump  stations,  and  blocked  and \ndilapidated sewer mains. This has contributed to the degradation of the aquatic ecosystems of \nthe  urban  streams  and  coastal  foreshore,  and  poses  a  risk  to  human  health.  Rehabilitation  of \nsewerage  assets  will  enable  the  current  system  to  deliver  environmental  and  public  health \nbenefits.  It  will  also  facilitate  the  connection  of  a  larger  percentage  of  the  population  to  the \nsystem, further improving the  environment and utilizing the available treatment capacity of the \nKinoya  sewage  treatment  plant,  the  area's  main  sewage  treatment  plant.  The  Kinoya  plant, \nwhich includes a trickling filter process for secondary treatment and a sequencing batch reactor, \ngenerally  operates  effectively  and  achieves \ninternational  wastewater  discharge  quality \nstandards.  However,  its  capacity  is  limited  by  the  inlet  works,  and  odor  control  is  a  problem. \nSludge  treatment  and  disposal  facilities  are  inadequate.  Better  instrumentation  of  the  sewage \ntreatment  plant  will  enable  treatment  efficiency  improvements  and  efficient  balancing  between \nthe trickling filter and sequencing batch reactor plant. \n \nWhen the Project was appraised, the institutional arrangements for the delivery of water \n6. \nand  sewerage  services  to  urban  centers  were  not  conducive  to  a  high  level  of  service  to \nconsumers, and were not financially sustainable. The Water and Sewerage Department (WSD), \na division of the Ministry of Public Utilities, Works and Transport (MPUWT), was responsible for \nthe  planning,  design,  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  urban  water  supplies  and \nsewerage  systems.  MPUWT  senior  staff  were  responsible  not  only  for  water  supply  and \nsewerage,  but  also  roads,  buildings,  and  mechanical  and  electrical  works.  Management \ninformation systems focused more on capital works than on operations or finances. \n \n7. \nThe  Government\u2019s  Strategic  Plan,  2003\u20132005  and  the  MPUWT  (then  known  as  the \nMinistry of Works and Energy) corporate plan for 2002 provided a framework for corporatization \nof water and sewerage services.3 The framework proposed the reorganization of the water and \nsewerage  section  of  MPUWT  into  an  autonomous  water  and  sewerage  corporation.  The \nGovernment  and  MPUWT  staff  recognized  the  need  to  plan  carefully  for  the  transition  to \nmaintain  the  high  level  of  accessibility  to  services,  avoid  harmful  impacts  on  the  poor,  retrain \nand  redeploy  staff  rather  than  terminate  them,  and  avoid  substantial  tariff  increases  until \nservices can be improved. \n \nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  higher  living  standards  in  the  Suva\u2013Nausori  area, \n8. \nparticularly  for  the  urban  poor.  The  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  (i)  increase  the  delivery  of \nsafe  water  supply  and  sewerage  services  to  the  Suva\u2013Nausori  area  through  physical  and \ninstitutional  improvements,  and  (ii)  enhance  the  sustainability  of  water  supply  and  sewerage \nservices throughout the Fiji Islands through appropriate institutional reforms. \n \n9. \nThe  Project\u2019s  outputs  include  (i)  increased  supply,  delivery,  and  reliability  of  potable \nwater  in  the  Suva\u2013Nausori  area;  (ii)  reduced  unaccounted-for  water;  (iii)  a  rehabilitated \nwastewater  collection  and  treatment  system;  (iv)  recovery  of  aquatic  ecosystems  that  have \ndegraded  because  of  inadequate  sewerage  services;  (v)  strengthened  institutions  and \nlegislative  frameworks  for  wastewater  management  and  environmental  management;  and  (vi) \nestablishment of an entity dedicated to the provision of water and sewerage services in metered \nwater  supply  areas,  operated  in  manner  similar  to  those  of  a  commercial  water  supply  and \n\n                                                 \n3   Government of Fiji Islands. 2002.

The  loan  has  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  an  interest  rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.75% on the undisbursed loan amount; and a front-end fee of 0.5%. \n \n16.  When the loan was approved, the Fiji Islands was classified as a group C country and \nwas eligible to receive ADB financing for up to 65% financing of the project cost. An amended \ncost-sharing ceiling and financing parameters for the country were approved on 20 July 2009, \nwhich  raised  ADB's  cost-sharing  ceiling  to  99%  for  costs  in  relation  to  loans,  grants,  and  TA. \nThe Government is providing counterpart funding of $25.4 million for the Project. ADB funding \nincludes  $45.9  million  for  foreign  exchange  costs  and  the  equivalent  of  $1.1  million  for  local \ncurrency costs.

A chronology of project events is in Appendix 2. \n \n18. \nComponent A: Water Supply and Sewerage. Outputs delivered under this component \ninclude (i) construction of 60.5 km of new water supply mains, including 11.0 km of raw water \nmains  from  water  sources;  (ii)  replacement  of  56  km  of  undersized  or  dilapidated  mains;  (iii) \nconstruction of 12 new service and system balance reservoirs with a combined capacity of 18.6 \nmillion liters; and (iv) construction and commissioning of four new water supply pump stations. \nThese  outputs  have  improved  the  delivery  of  water  supply  services  through  better  reliability, \nparticularly to areas within the Suva\u2013Nausori water supply network, which had been subject to \nchronic water supply disruptions. 5  \n \n19. \nOngoing component A works include three contracts and force account works, which will \ndeliver 6 km of trunk sewers, rehabilitate five major sewage pump stations, and upgrade about \n60 minor sewage pump stations. Bids for civil works contracts to rehabilitate and augment the \nWaila  and  Tamavua  water  treatment  plants,  and  rehabilitate  and  augment  the  Kinoya  sewage \ntreatment  plant,  are  being  evaluated.  The  contracts  are  expected  to  be  awarded  by  October \n2009. Bidding for the rehabilitation of sewers in the Suva central business district and Nausori \ntown, and rehabilitation of the Great Eastern Sewer, closed on 15 September 2009. A contract \nis expected to be awarded by 27 November 2009. Bidding for the five remaining water supply \nand sewerage contracts is scheduled to be completed by February 2010. \n\n                                                 \n5   A notable example of improved water supply service delivery, which may be directly attributed to the Project, is \nthe provision of uninterrupted water supplies to more than 20,000 residents of Tacirua, Nagatugatu, Sekoca, and \nCunningham. These residents had been subject to daily water supply disruptions before the Project. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n20. \nComponent B: Institutional Reform and Development. The institutional reform of the \nFiji Islands' water and sewerage sector is ongoing. A consultancy to assist the Government in \ndesigning and implementing the institutional reform action plan to corporatize the Government's \nwater and sewerage services was completed in December 2006. Outputs from the consultancy \nincluded (i) development of an organizational structure and human resources development plan, \n(ii) design and development of a management information system, (iii) an update of a customer \ndatabase  and  water  meter  verification,  (iv)  development  of  a  customer  relations  management \nplan,  (v)  design  and  development  of  a  financial  management  system,  (vi)  preparation  of  an \ninfrastructure asset management plan, (vii) preparation of legislation to enable corporatization of \nthe  WSD,  and  (viii)  preparation  of  a  corporate  plan  for  a  corporatized  water  and  sewerage \nentity. \n \n21. \nA  number  of  milestones  in  the  reform  of  WSD  have  been  reached,  including  (i)  the \ndeclaration of WSD as a reform enterprise in accordance with the Public Enterprises Act, 1996 \nin June 2006; (ii) appointment of a charter change committee in September 2006; (iii) Cabinet \napproval  of  the  reorganization  charter  of  WSD  in  October  2006;  (iv)  promulgation  of  the  Fiji \nWater Authority Act in August 2007; (v) formation of the Water Authority Fiji (WAF) in 2008; (vi) \nappointment of the WAF board of directors in February 2009; and (vii) appointment of the WAF \nchief executive officer in May 2009. The Government complied with the time-bound institutional \nreform  and  development  covenants  which  were  included  in  the  approved  Loan  Agreement. 6 \nHowever,  compliance  was  delayed  by  up  to  12  months.  In  June  2009,  WAF  and  the \nGovernment agreed to amend the proposed staffing structure and arrangements for transfer of \nstaff  units,  staff  assets,  and  records  from  WSD  to  WAF.  Transfer  of  personnel  from  WSD  to \nWAF  commenced  on  1  September  2009  prior  to  the  finalization  of  the  WAF  staffing  structure \nand the arrangements for transfer of WSD staff units, staff assets, and records to WAF which \nare  expected  to  be  completed  by  31  December  2009.  Rapid  completion  of  these  activities  is \ncrucial  as  WAF  is  scheduled  to  commence  operations  as  a  fully  autonomous  water  and \nsewerage corporation on 1 January 2010. \n \n22.  WAF is preparing an updated staffing plan, and a corporate plan and strategy. It is also \nreviewing  tariffs  for  water  and  sewerage.  All  of  these  are  scheduled  to  be  completed  by  31 \nDecember 2009. The changes to the tariff structure will be effective from 1 January 2010. The \nGovernment  will  support  WAF  financially  through  its  annual  budgetary  process  for  3  years \nbeginning  in  FY2010.  The  Government  has  complied  with  the  institutional  reform  and \ndevelopment  covenants  of  the  loan.  However,  compliance  with  some  time-bound  covenants \nwas delayed by up to 12 months as result as delays in the loan becoming effective (about 12 \nmonths)  and  delays  in  recruiting  consultants  to  assist  the  Government  in  designing  and \nimplementing the reforms. \n \nProject  Management.  MPU  is  the  executing  agency,  and  WSD  is  the  implementing \n23. \nagency  for  the  Project.  Two  project  management  units  (PMUs)  were  established  within  WSD, \none  for  component  A  and  the  other  for  component  B.  The  PMU  for  component  B  has  been \n\n                                                 \n6   Time-bound  institutional  reform  and  development  covenants  in  the  approved  Loan  Agreement  included:  (i) \nappointment  of  WSD's  advisory  Board  by  30  June  2004;  (ii)  Development  of  a  staffing  plan  for  WSD  including \nposition  descriptions  for  all  senior  staff  by  1  July  2004;  (iii)  All  senior  staff  within  WSD  to  be  employed  under \nperformance-based  contracts  issued  by  the  Public  Service  Commission  by  1  July  2004;  (iv)  Staff  units,  staff \nassets, and records currently within PWD relating to WSD to be transferred to WSD by 30 September 2004; (v) a \nmemorandum  outlining  the  progress  of  institutional  reforms  and  the  next  steps  required  for  corporatization  of \nWSD  to  be  submitted  to  the  Cabinet  by  30  June  2004;  and  (vi)  Cabinet  consideration  of  a  memorandum \npresenting  for  approval  the  draft  Charter  Organization  Plan,  outline  chart  of  accounts,  proposed  management \ninformation system, and proposed financing and regulatory arrangements for the corporatized entity. \n\n\fdisbanded  as  many  of  the  institutional  reform  components  are  complete.  The  PMU  for \ncomponent  A,  which  reports  to  the  permanent  secretary  for  public  utilities,  is  responsible  for \nimplementation, programming, selection and engagement of consultants, procurement of goods \nand services, management of construction, maintenance of project records, progress reporting, \nfinancial  management,  identification  of  problems  and  issues  that  arise  during  implementation, \nstaff training, and preparation of recommendations for adjustments in the Project.  \n \n24. \nThe  PMU  for  component  A  is  headed  by  a  project  manager  appointed  by  the \nGovernment.  The  PMU  also  includes  a  leak  detection  engineer,  a  project  accountant,  and  a \ntechnical officer seconded to the PMU from WSD. WSD provides the services of a senior valuer, \na  land  acquisition  officer,  and  a  community  relations  officer,  as  required.  The  structure  of  the \nPMU, as approved by the Public Service Commission, includes a senior water engineer and a \nsenior  sewer  engineer.  However,  the  Government  has  been  unable  to  recruit  individuals  for \nthese  posts  because  of  the  chronic  shortage  of  engineers  in  the  Fiji  Islands.  As  a  result,  the \nPMU  has  limited  technical  capacity.  Design  and  supervision  consultants  report  to  the  project \nmanager. \n \n25. \nA  project  steering  committee  was  constituted  from  among  the  members  of  the  capital \nworks  committee,  which  was  established  during  the  preparation  of  the  master  plan  for  the \ndevelopment  of  water  and  sewerage  services  in  the  Suva\u2013Nausori  area.  The  committee  has \nbeen disbanded, and the WAF board now provides guidance and direction for the Project. \n \n26. \nImplementation  Period.  Project  implementation  is  delayed  by  about  24  months.  At \nappraisal, the Project was envisaged to be implemented over 5 years, starting in April 2004. The \nProject began in December 2004 with the appointment of the PMUs for components A and B. \nThe  Loan  Agreement  specified  a  project  completion  date  of  31  December  2008.  The  loan \nclosing date was later extended to 31 December 2010. The implementation delay was caused \nby (i) a 12-month delay in recruiting the component B PMU, a condition for loan effectiveness; \nand (ii) limited management capacity within the component A PMU from November 2005 until \nMarch  2007  following  the  appointment  of  a  new  project  manager  with  limited  project \nmanagement experience.7 \n \nProcurement.  Procurement  of  some  project  components  is  complete.  Bidding  for  the \n27. \ncontracts \ninternational  competitive  bidding  methods  using  standard  ADB  bid \ndocuments.  As  of  11  September  2009,  ADB  had  approved  $28.42  million  in  financing  for \nawarded contracts. \n \n28. \nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting. The PMU is responsible for preparing quarterly \nprogress reports on project implementation, and for maintaining separate accounts and records \nof expenditures for the Project. Externally audited project accounts and financial statements are \nsubmitted  to  ADB  annually.  The  MPUWT  has  been  unable  to  provide  ADB  with  the  quarterly \nprogress reports since the third quarter of 2005, but it has provided ADB with updated project \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  data  quarterly.  The  submission  of  the  FY2006  audited  project \naccounts to ADB was delayed by 14 months, resulting in the suspension of the loan for about 6 \nweeks  in  early  2008.  The  submission  of  the  FY2006  audited  project  accounts  was  delayed \nbecause the MPUWT and the Ministry of Finance needed to reconcile differences in recorded \nproject expenditures. The Ministry of Finance adopted a new cost coding system in 2005, which \nwas  not  fully  adopted  by  the  MPUWT  until  2006.  This  resulted  in  mismatched  expenditures \n\nfollowed \n\n                                                 \n7   A  new  project  manager  was  appointed  in  November  2005  following  the  resignation  of  the  original  project \nmanager.  The  second  project  manager  was  replaced  by  the  current  project  manager  in  March  2007.  Project \nimplementation progress improved significantly following the replacement of the second project manager. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n9  \n\n \n\nrecorded by the two ministries, and required about 12 months to resolve. The FY2007 audited \nproject accounts were submitted to ADB before the due date, and the submission of the FY2008 \naudited project accounts is anticipated by the due date (30 September 2009). All of the audited \nproject accounts submitted to date have been cleared. \n \n29. \nRelated  Technical  Assistance.  A  TA  grant  for  the  Capacity  Building  in  Water  and \nSewerage  Services  project  was  approved  with  the  original  loan. 8  The  MPUWT  was  the \nexecuting agency and implementing agency for the TA. The TA provided 37.4 person-months of \ninternational consultant inputs and 40.5 person-months of national consultant inputs. Completed \nin  2006,  the  TA  supported  the  development  of  a  trade  waste  program,  health  and  safety \nprocedures,  environmental  legislation  and  regulations,  a  community  education  and  awareness \nprogram, and a tariff study. WSD has implemented the trade waste program and the health and \nsafety  procedures.  The  environmental  legislation  and  regulations  were  promulgated  in  2006. \nCommunity  awareness  and  education  programs  by  WSD  are  being  implemented  by  its \ncommunity liaison officer. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Cost Overrun \n\nA. \n \nThe estimated cost to implement the Project has risen significantly primarily because the \n30. \ncost of materials and fuel has increased and the US dollar has weakened against the currencies \nof  bidders  for  major  contracts.  Investment  costs  for  the  Project  are  now  estimated  at  $114.2 \nmillion,  compared  with  $72.4  million  at  appraisal.  Wage  increases  and  an  underestimation  of \nproject costs at appraisal also contributed to the cost overruns.  \n \n31. \nAn  analysis  was  undertaken  to  estimate  the  impact  of  rising  material  prices,  a  weaker \nUS dollar, and wage increases on the prices for the contracts that have already been bid.9 The \ncumulative value of the bids is $52.3 million, compared with the appraisal cost estimate of $30.4 \nmillion for those contracts, a cost overrun of $21.9 million (71.7%). Material cost increases were \nestimated to account for $12.6 million (57.8%) of the cost overrun, depreciation of the US dollar \nagainst  the  currencies  of  the  bidders  accounted  for  $4.7  million  (21.6%),  wage  increases \naccounted for $1.3 million (5.8%), and underestimation of construction costs at project appraisal \naccounted  for  $3.2 million  (14.8%).  The  summary  results  of  the  cost  overrun  analysis  are  in \nAppendix 3. \n \nThe  design  of  the  major  components  that  have  not  been  bid  are  complete.  The  cost \n32. \nestimates  for  these  components  take  into  account  the  current  construction  market  conditions \nwithin  the  Fiji  Islands,  as  well  as  in  Australia  and  New  Zealand  where  most  of  the  specialist \nequipment,  materials,  and  personnel  will  be  sourced.  With  advance  procurement  action  to \nsupport  timely  implementation  of  the  remaining  components,  prices  are  expected  to  remain  at \nestimated costs. \n \nB. \n \n33. \nBecause  of  the  estimated  cost  overruns,  the  approved  financing  for  the  Project  is \ninsufficient to achieve the original objectives and outputs. In light of the potential cost overruns, \nthe  Government  reassessed  the  project  priorities  and  decided,  where  possible  without \n\nImpact on the Project \n\n                                                 \n8 \n\nADB.  2003.

Project  components  that \nwere  shelved  included  the  Rewa  run-of-the-river  component,  the  extension  of  the  sewerage \nnetwork to service the proposed Housing Authority development at Navitoka, the development \nof  an  asset  register  and  geographic  information  system,  and  the  purchase  of  computers  and \nequipment  for  the  National  Water  Quality  Laboratory  and  the  National  Pump  Workshop.  The \nbasis  for  shelving  these  components  is  in  Appendix  4.  With  the  reduced  scope,  the  cost  to \nimplement the Project is estimated at $100.1 million, a cost overrun of $27.7 million. \n \n34. \nhave not yet been procured: \n\nThe  following  components  are  considered  essential  to  attaining  the  project  goals  and \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(vi) \n\ntraining, \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\nleak  detection \n\nincluding  provision  of  specialized \n\nrehabilitation  and  augmentation  of  the  Waila  and  Tamavua  water  treatment \nplants; \nconstruction  of  backwash  treatment  and  sludge  disposal  facilities  at  the  Waila \nand Tamavua water treatment plants; \nwater loss reduction program; \nrehabilitation and augmentation of the Kinoya sewage treatment plant; \nleak  detection \nequipment; \nrehabilitation of sewers in Suva central business district, Nausori Town, and the \nGreat Eastern Sewer; \nbacklog sewerage program; \nenvironmental monitoring program; and \nPMU technical support consultants. \n\n(vii) \n(viii) \n(ix) \n \nThe  rehabilitation  and  augmentation  of  the  Waila  and  Tamavua  water  treatment  plants \n35. \nand the rehabilitation and augmentation of the Kinoya sewage treatment plant are expected to \nbe awarded during the fourth quarter of 2009. ADB will finance eligible expenditures from these \ncontracts  from  the  remaining  uncommitted  funds  under  the  original  loan  (about  $13.8  million). \nThe  cost  of  the  remaining  seven  essential  project  components  that  have  not  been  procured \n(para.  34)  is  estimated  at  $30.50  million.  To  help  meet  the  cost  overrun,  the  Government  has \nrequested  a  supplementary  loan  from  ADB  for  $23.00  million.  The  Government  will  contribute \n$4.74  million  in  additional  counterpart  funding  and  $2.76  million  from  counterpart  funding \nsavings  identified  in  the  original  loan  (primarily  from  design  and  supervision  consultant  cost \nsavings). \n \nC. \n \n36. \nCost  Estimates.  A  number  of  lessons  are  evident  from  ADB  support  for  infrastructure \ndevelopment projects in the Fiji Islands and elsewhere in the Pacific. The Fiji Islands relies on \ninternational  markets,  particularly  New  Zealand  and  Australia,  for  civil  works  contracts.  The \npreparation of accurate cost estimates is difficult as external factors that are hard to gauge often \ndirectly  affect  costs  in  the  Fiji  Islands.  Physical  contingencies  must  be  sufficient  to  allow  for \ntechnical  uncertainties.  In  addition,  the  selection  of  procurement  methods  must  take  into \naccount the capacity of implementing agencies to manage and coordinate contracts, and their \nability to attract sufficient qualified bidders. \n \n37. \nImplementation  Delays.  Cost  overruns  have  historically  been  related  to  delays  in \nimplementation,  mainly  caused  by  technical  and  procurement  issues.  The  risk  of  delays  in \nproject  implementation  and  associated  cost  overruns  need  to  be  identified  during  project \npreparation. The preparation of bid documents during project preparation will reduce the risk of \nimplementation delays.  \n \n\nLessons \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nRationale \n\nD. \n \n38. \nThe  original  project  rationale  remains  valid  as  the  provision  of  reliable  and  sustainable \nwater supply and sewerage services, and improvement in public and environmental health, are \nhigh  priorities  of  the  Government  and  major  concerns  of  the  people  of  the  Fiji  Islands.  The \nProject supports the objectives articulated in the Government\u2019s draft Strategic Development Plan, \n2007\u20132011  for  the  development  of  efficient  and  cost-effective  infrastructure,  which  will  facilitate \neconomic  and  social  development  and  spur  private  sector  investment,  accompanied  by \ninstitutional  improvements  to  increase  the  efficiency  and  raise  the  standards  of  facilities  and \nservices. The goals of the plan for water and sanitation services are the provision of reliable and \nadequate  supplies  of  safe  water  in  both  urban  and  rural  centers  and  to  sanitary  and \nenvironmentally  safe  sewerage  waste  systems  and  treatment  facilities.  Strategies  to  achieve \nthese  goals  include  (i)  upgrading  of  major  urban  and  regional  water  schemes;  (ii)  expansion  of \nsewer  reticulation  mains  and  treatment  plant  facilities,  and  promotion  of  environmental \npreservation;  (iii)  private  sector  participation  in  the  development  and  operation  of  water  and \nsewerage services; (iv) aggressive leak detection programs; and (v) preparation and promulgation \nof legislation to enable reform of the water sector. \n \nThe  Project  also  supports  ADB\u2019s  Water  Policy 10 by  (i)  improving  and  expanding  the \n39. \ndelivery  of  water  and  sewerage  services,  and  (ii)  increasing  water  and  sewerage  service \nefficiency and sustainability through the transfer of water and sewerage services from WSD to \nWAF,  the  introduction  of  appropriate  tariffs  that  will  enable  the  recovery  of  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) costs, the provision of enhanced maintenance programs to be developed \nand  implemented,  thereby  improving  the  sustainability  of  water  supply  and  sewerage  assets, \nand increased public awareness. \n \n40. \nThe  economic  analysis  of  the  Project  has  been  redone  and  shows  that  the  Project \nremains  economically  viable  despite  the  cost  overruns  and  reduced  scope.  The  rehabilitation \nand  augmentation  of  water  supply  and  sewerage  services  in  the  Suva\u2013Nausori  area  are \nessential  to  improve  the  reliability,  security,  and  quality  of  the  services  delivered  to  the  area's \npopulation.  To  address  the  erosion  of  the  skills  base  for  provision  of  public  water  supply  and \nsewerage services in the Fiji Islands, the Government and WAF are recruiting key technical and \nmanagerial personnel locally and abroad. \n \n41. \n\nThe Project is eligible for supplementary financing under ADB\u2019s policy criteria as \n(i) \n\nthe  Project  is  identified  as  a  high-priority  activity  under  the  Government\u2019s  draft \nStrategic Development Plan, 2007\u20132011; \nsupplementary financing will help achieve the project objectives and benefits; \nsupplementary financing was not previously provided;  \nthe  Project  is  in  an  advanced  state  of  implementation  and  can  be  completed \nquickly; and \nthe  amount  of  supplementary  financing  will  not  exceed  the  original  financing \napproved by ADB. \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nADB\u2019s Reengagement Strategy \n\n \nE. \n \n42. \nFollowing  the  political  crisis  in  2006,  ADB  is  implementing  a  two-stage  reengagement \nstrategy  in  the  Fiji  Islands. 11  In  the  first  stage,  ADB  has  continued  to  support  ongoing \noperations, as it has ascertained that the interim Government (i) effectively controls the country, \n\n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n\n\f(ii) generally recognizes the country\u2019s international obligations, (iii) is willing and able to assume \nall  of  its  predecessor\u2019s  obligations  to  ADB,  (iv)  can  ensure  the  continued  implementation  of \nongoing projects and programs, and (v) has authorized a representative to make withdrawals.  \n \nADB  has  not  yet  proposed  a  resumption  of  formal  discussions  on  a  new  country \n43. \npartnership  strategy,  or  a  new  loan  or  TA.  A  proposal  to  resume  full  operations  in  the  Fiji \nIslands\u2014the  second  stage  of  the  reengagement  strategy\u2014will  be  made  once  the  evidence \ndemonstrates that the conditions are appropriate. The Pacific Department will regularly assess \nthe  conditions  for  new  engagement.  Poverty  reduction  is  a  key  consideration  in  defining  new \nlending  and  nonlending  priorities.  The  Suva\u2013Nausori  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  Project  is \nincluded  in  ADB\u2019s  approved  and  ongoing  program,  and  it  needs  supplementary  financing  to \nreach completion. \n \nF. \n \n44. \nThe revised investment cost to implement the Project with a reduced scope is estimated \nat  $100.12 million,  including  taxes  and  duties  of  $13.22  million. 12 Financing  charges  during \nimplementation  are  estimated  at  $5.12  million.

The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%,  and  such  other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The Government has provided ADB \nwith (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the \nbasis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n\nTable 4: Revised Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\n Financing Source \nAsian Development Bank  \nGovernment of the Fiji Islands \nTotal  \na  The Asian Development Bank approved a country cost-sharing ceiling of up to 99% on 20 July 2009. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nPercentagea \n82.91 \n17.09 \n100.00 \n\nAmount  \n23.00 \n4.74 \n27.74 \n\nRemedial Steps \n\n \nH. \n \n46. \nBidding documents have been prepared for all major civil works components proposed \nfor financing under the supplementary loan. Bids for the rehabilitation of the Waila and Tamavua \nwater  treatment  plants  and  the  rehabilitation  of  the  Kinoya  sewage  treatment  plant  are  being \nevaluated. Contracts are expected to be awarded by 31 August 2009. Retroactive financing of \nthe PMU technical support consultants; the backlog sewerage program; and the rehabilitation of \nsewers in Suva central business district, Nausori Town, and the Great Eastern Sewer (contract \nWSC  41/04)  will  enable  bidding  and  the  award  of  contracts  before  the  approval  of  the \nsupplementary loan. This will expedite project implementation. \n \nI. \n \n47. \nThe  existing  implementation  arrangements  for  the  Project  in  terms  of  accounting, \nauditing,  reporting,  and  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  are  considered  adequate  and \nwill not be changed. Project review missions will continue to be undertaken every 6 months. The \nMPUWT will provide ADB with a completion report within 3 months of the physical completion of \nthe Project. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\na. \n\nProject Management  \n\n48.  MPU will remain the project executing and implementing agency. The recently appointed \nWAF  board  will  provide  guidance  and  direction  on  project  activities,  as  the  responsibility  for \ndelivery of urban water supply and sewerage services will be transferred from the WSD to WAF \non  1  January  2010.13 The  PMU  will  remain  within  the  MPU  and  will  report  to  the  permanent \nsecretary  for  public  utilities.  The  PMU  will  continue  to  coordinate  project  activities;  monitor \noverall project progress; and manage project accounts, procurement, and reporting. To address \n                                                 \n13 Under the Public Enterprises Act 1996, the minister for public enterprise, after consulting with the relevant minister \n(in  the  case  of  WAF,  the  minister  for  public  utilities,  works  and  transport)  and  with  the  approval  of  the  Prime \nMinister, appoints members of reform enterprise boards. The minister for public enterprises is also responsible for \nthe designation of the chairperson of the board from among members of the board.  \n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fproject implementation capacity issues within the PMU, the Government is currently recruiting a \nsenior water supply engineer and a senior sewerage engineer. \n \n\nb. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n49.  \nThe Project completion date will be extended from 31 December 2010 to 30 June 2012 \nto  allow  for  the  completion  of  all  project  components  and  to  enable  the  Project  to  achieve  its \nobjectives. The revised implementation schedule is in Appendix 6. \n \n\nc. \n\nProcurement \n\n50.  \nAll procurement to be financed by ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Civil  works  will  be  procured \nfollowing international competitive bidding procedures and ADB's standard bid documents. Bid \ndocuments for all civil works contracts will be reviewed and endorsed by ADB prior to bidding. \nBid  evaluation  reports  will  be  reviewed  within  ADB  by  the  Pacific  Department  and  the  Central \nOperations Services Office and / or the Procurement Committee prior to award of the Contract. \nThe revised procurement plan is in Appendix 7. \n \n\nd. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n51. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  MPU.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n52. \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  ADB  requirements,  to  deter  corruption  and  increase \ntransparency,  the  Project  will  (i)  build  the  EA\u2019s  capacity  to  comply  with  ADB  and  Government \nprocedures,  to  be  outlined  in  an  updated  project  administration  manual;  and  (ii)  establish  a \nproject  website  to  disclose  information  concerning  the  Project,  including  general  project \ninformation, procurement, project progress, and contact details in the English, Fijian, and Hindi \nlanguages. The website will also provide a link to a mechanism for reporting grievances relating \nto  the  Project  and  project  activities.  With  regard  to  procurement,  the  website  shall  include \ninformation  on  the  list  of  participating  bidders,  name  of  the  winning  bidder,  basic  details  on \nbidding  procedures  adopted,  amount  of  contract  awarded,  and  the  list  of  goods  and  works \nprocured. \n \n\ne. \n\nAdvance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing \n\nTo  facilitate  timely  project  implementation,  ADB  approved  advance  procurement  action \n53. \nand  retroactive  financing  of  three  contracts:  (i)  the  PMU  technical  support  consultants;  (ii)  the \nbacklog  sewerage  program;  and  (iii)  the  rehabilitation  of  sewers  in  Suva  central  business \ndistrict, Nausori Town, and the Great Eastern Sewer. Procurement for these three contracts will \nbe in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Up to 20% of loan proceeds are eligible \nfor retroactive financing. Retroactive financing is applicable to eligible expenditures, which must \nbe  incurred  before  loan  effectiveness,  but  not  earlier  than  12  months  before  signing  of  the \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nfinancing  agreement.  The  Government  was  advised  that  approval  of  advance  procurement \naction and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to financing the Project. \n \n\nf. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n54.  \nFour  consulting  services  contracts  will  be  financed  under  the  supplementary  loan  to \nassist the Government to (i) implement the water loss reduction program, (ii) implement the leak \ndetection  training  program,  (iii)  implement  the  environmental  monitoring  program,  and  (iv) \nprovide  technical  support  to  the  PMU.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  through  a  firm  in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) using quality- and cost-based selection procedures with a quality and cost ratio of 80:20 \nand  the  technical  proposal  types  specified  in  the  revised  procurement  plan  and  contract \npackages (Appendix 7). \n \n\ng. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nThe  supplementary  loan  funds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \ntime).  Direct  payment  or \n\n55.  \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended \nreimbursement procedures will apply for all contracts financed by the supplementary loan. \n \n\nfrom \n\ntime \n\nto \n\nh. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n56. \nThe PMU will maintain separate records and accounts for project components financed \nthrough  the  approved  loan  and  supplementary  financing.  Independent  auditors  acceptable  to \nADB will annually conduct separate audits of the project accounts and financial statements for \ncomponents  financed  under  the  approved  loan  and  the  supplementary  financing.  The \nGovernment  will  provide  ADB  with  copies  of  the  audited  project  accounts  and  financial \nstatements for both the approved loan and supplementary financing no later than 6 months after \nthe end of the fiscal year to which they relate. The Government will provide ADB with quarterly \nprogress  reports  on  project  implementation.  Within  3  months  of  physical  completion  of  the \nProject, the Ministry of Finance will provide ADB with a project completion report. The PMU will \ncompile progress reports. \n \n\ni. \n\nProject Performance Management System \n\nThe  existing  project  performance  management  system  will  be  retained,  and  quarterly \n\n57. \nmonitoring of indicators that are currently being monitored under the Project will continue. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\n58. \nThe  economic  analyses  were  redone  for  the  Project.  In  the  absence  of  investments  in \nthe Project, the status quo was assumed to continue. Quantified benefits for the Project's water \nsupply components included (i) non-incremental benefits comprising (a) cost savings in meeting \nthe  demand  of  new  customers  at  present  satisfied  demand  levels,  and  (b)  integration  of  the \nsmall  water  supply  system  servicing  Colo-I-Suva  into  the  Suva\u2013Nausori  regional  water  supply \nscheme;  and  (ii)  incremental  benefits  comprising  (a)  meeting  suppressed  domestic  and \ncommercial  demands,  and  (ii)  non-revenue  water  consumed  under  the  Project.  As  a  result  of \nlow water supply pressure to some consumers and frequent water supply disruptions, supplies \nare assumed to have constrained demand. \n \n\n\fQuantified  benefits  of  the  Project's sewerage  components  include  the avoided  costs  of \n59. \n(i) replacing and desludging septic tanks for the 9,300 urban allotments that will be connected to \nthe sewerage system under the Project, and enforcement of laws compelling property owners to \nconnect to sewerage systems where available; and (ii) replacing the Kinoya sewage treatment \nplant and existing sewers, which would be required in the absence of the Project's rehabilitation \nand augmentation works for the plant and rehabilitation of key sewers. \n \n60. \nThe  economic  analyses  were  conducted  for  a  period  of  40  years,  including  an \ninvestment  period  of  9  years.  Taxes  and  duties  were  excluded  from  all  costs.  Economic \ninvestment costs included the updated cost estimates of the project components. The economic \nanalyses yielded economic internal rates of return of 14.5% for the water supply component and \n12.7%  for  the  sewerage  component.  The  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the \nwater  supply  and  sewerage  components  combined  was  13.8%.  The  rates  of  return  were  less \nthan the assumed economic opportunity cost of capital of 12% with respect to changes in some \nkey  assumptions  and  risks.  Risk  of  further  delays  and  cost  increases  is  considered  small  as \nimplementation  is  advanced.  Sustainability  throughout  the  life  of  the  Project  is  supported \nthrough the tariff mechanisms. Details of the economic analyses are in Appendix 8. \n \nB. \n\nFinancial Aspects \n\nAn  assessment  of  the  cost-recovery  and  user  charges  was  undertaken  to  ensure  that \n\n61. \nthe Project's water supply and sewerage components are sustainable.  \n \n62.  Water Supply. Cost recovery from beneficiaries will be achieved through a revised tariff \nstructure. The tariff will be set based on metered water consumption. A block tariff structure will \nbe applied for domestic consumers for each 3-month billing cycle. A lifeline block will be applied \nfor the first 50,000 liters consumed, followed by an intermediate block applied for consumption \nbetween 50,000 and 100,000 liters, and a high block for consumption exceeding 100,000 liters \nper billing cycle. A single volumetric tariff will apply to commercial and government consumers.  \n \n63. \nSewerage. Cost recovery from beneficiaries will be achieved through the application of a \nsewerage  tariff  for  those  connected  to  the  sewerage  system.  The  tariff  will  be  set  based  on \nmetered water consumption and applied by WAF as a separate line item on customers\u2019 water \nbills. \n \n64. \nAt a minimum, the water and sewerage tariffs will be set to cover the costs of O&M and \nmanagement during the first year of the revised tariff structure. It will be increased annually over \n2  years  to  achieve  full  recovery  of  O&M  costs,  depreciation,  and  debt  servicing.  The \nGovernment  will  fund  any  gap  between  actual  tariffs  and  those  required  to  achieve  full  cost \nrecovery. 14  Details  of  the  analysis  of  cost-recovery  mechanisms  and  user  charges  are  in \nAppendix 8. \n \nC. \n\nSocial and Resettlement Impacts \n\nA  social  analysis  undertaken  during  project  preparation  concluded  that  the  Project  will \n65.  \nhave  a  positive  social  impact.  The  Project\u2019s  water  supply  component  will  help  reduce  health \nrisks, such as infantile diarrhea, that are caused by the lack of water and contamination of water \narising  from  low  pressure  in  the  piped  system.  It  will  also  provide  water  for  cooking,  washing, \nand  bathing,  and  reduce  the  need  to  boil  water.  Improvements  in  sewage  disposal  to  prevent \n\n                                                 \n14   The  Government  has  agreed  to  cover  the  shortfall  between  revenue  and  costs  for  the  first  3  years  of  WAF \n\noperation, starting on 1 January 2010. \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\ncontamination of waterways will benefit the poorest people who live in swampy, low-lying, poorly \ndraining areas near the coast, such as in Vatuwaqa and along the Samabula River. Residents \nof these communities use the waterways for fishing and supplementing their food sources. The \nenvironmental benefits of the Project\u2019s sewerage  component will improve the quality of life for \nthe poorest people. Because of the current global financial crisis and the recent political events, \nmore  households  within  the  Suva\u2013Nausori  area  are  facing  hardship.  The  summary  poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 9. \n \nLack of water places an extra burden on women and children by making the collection \n66.  \nand storage of water more difficult. Intermittent cuts in the water supply inconvenience women \nthe most. In both indigenous Fijian and Indo-Fijian cultures, women have prime responsibility for \nwater and sanitation at home. They are the primary caregivers of children, and they have control \nover food preparation, bathing, toileting, and hygiene of children. Thus, the Project will have a \nsignificant  effect  on  women  in  terms  of  improving  environmental  conditions,  the  water  supply, \nand  family  health  conditions.  The  community  education  and  awareness  program  also  targets \nwomen. \n \n67.  \nInterventions to address ADB's Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) are not required as \nthe mainstream society in the Fiji Islands is made up of the indigenous population. There are no \nsocial or cultural identities that are \"distinct from that of the dominant or mainstream society.\" \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n68. \nAn  initial  environmental  examination  for  the  Project  has  confirmed  the  classification  as \ncategory  B.  The  Project\u2019s  overall  environmental  effects  are  positive.  It  will  benefit  the \nenvironment  through  (i)  a  substantial  reduction  of  sewage  entering  the  groundwater,  streams, \nand  the  sea  because  of  inadequate  treatment  in  septic  tanks;  (ii)  a  substantial  reduction  of \nsewage pump station failures and consequent overflows, which often seriously affect low-lying \ncommunities  near  coastal  waters;  (iii)  the  provision  of  sludge  treatment  facilities  at  the  two \nproject water treatment plants; and (iv) better performance and effluent quality from the Kinoya \nsewage treatment plant. The rehabilitation and augmentation of that plant will enable access to \ncarbon  credits  through  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism.  These  improvements  will  help  to \nreduce  the  pollution  of  streams,  drains,  and  coastal  waters  in  the  project  area.  Environmental \nmonitoring  and  management  plans,  incorporated  into  civil  works  contracts,  are  being \nimplemented effectively and are monitored by the WSD's environment officer. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n69. \nInstitutional Reforms. WAF is scheduled to start operations on 1 January 2010. Some \ncrucial actions are required to ensure that the transition from WSD to WAF is effective. Although \nthe  transfer  of  personnel  from  WSD  to  WAF  commenced  on  1  September  2009,  the  WAF \nstaffing structure and arrangements for transfer of staff units, staff assets, and records currently \nwithin WSD and MPUWT to WAF have not been finalized. Time-bound assurances have been \nincorporated into the Supplementary Loan Agreement to ensure that these tasks are completed \nbefore WAF starts operation as a fully functioning autonomous water and sewerage corporation. \n \n70. \nFurther Project Delays and Cost Increases. The risk of further project delays and cost \noverruns  is  considered  small  as  the  majority  of  the  works  have  been  awarded,  and  bid \ndocuments for works that have not yet been bid have been completed. To mitigate the risk of \nfurther cost overruns, physical contingencies of 15% have been provided in the revised project \ncost estimate. \n \n\n\fA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn addition to the Loan covenants and assurances under Loan 2055-FIJ: Suva\u2013Nausori \n71. \nWater Supply and Sewerage Project, the Government has given the following assurances which \nare incorporated in the legal documents: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nWater  Authority  Fiji.

The  components  that  were \nshelved  included  the  Rewa  run-of-the-river  scheme,  extension  of  the  sewerage  network  to \nservice  the  proposed  Housing  Authority  development  at  Navitoka,  development  of  an  asset \nregister  and  geographic  information  system  (GIS)  system,  and  purchase  of  computers  and \nequipment for the National Water Quality Laboratory and the National Pump Workshop. By not \nincluding these components in the Project, the estimated cost overrun has been reduced from \n$41.8 million to $27.7 million. \n \nRewa  Run-of-the-River  Scheme.  While  the  raw  water  sources  for  the  Suva\u2013Nausori \n2. \nregional water supply need to be augmented, as proposed through the Project's Rewa run-of-\nthe-river  scheme,  the  Government  considered  it  prudent  to  delay  development  of  new  water \nsources  until  additional  water  treatment  capacity  within  the  area  is  developed.  The  treatment \ncapacity  of  the  area\u2019s  two  water  treatment  plants  at  Waila  and  Tamavua  (even  after  the \nrehabilitation and augmentation works at both plants are completed under the Project) is lower \nthan  the  demand  for  treated  water.  Both  plants  operate  at  more  than  120%  of  their  rated \ntreatment  capacities,  which  compromises  the  quality  of  water  produced,  particularly  during \nperiods of high flow in the Waimanu River and Savura Creek. The development of a new water \nsource  preferably  should  be  in  conjunction  with  the  development  of  a  new  water  treatment \nfacility to service Nausori, the Rewa Delta area, and some areas north of Baulevu. The cost to \ndevelop a new water source and water treatment facility is estimated at $35 million, well beyond \nthe project budget. This component could be included in a possible future phase of the Project. \n \n3. \nNavitoka Sewerage Scheme. Planning for the proposed Housing Authority subdivision \nat Navitoka is ongoing. Construction of the subdivision, which is unlikely to start until 2011, will \ninvolve  substantial  earthworks.  If  the  proposed  sewer  extension  to  Navitoka  is  constructed \nbefore  the  subdivision,  there  is  a  significant  risk  that  the  sewers  will  have  to  be  lowered  or \nrelocated when the earthworks begin. To mitigate this risk, the Government decided to shelve \nthe construction of the Navitoka sewerage scheme until the earthworks for the subdivision are \ncomplete. The extension of the sewerage network to Navitoka could also be financed through a \npossible future phase of the Project. \n \n4. \nAsset  Register,  GIS  System,  Computers,  and  Other  Equipment.  The  Government \nhas funded, through its own resources, the development of the asset register and a GIS system. \nIt  will  also  fund  the  purchase  of  computers  and  equipment  for  the  National  Water  Quality \nLaboratory and the National Pump Workshop. Consequently, this component no longer needs \nto be financed through the project loan. \n \n \n\n \n\n\fCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n \nTable A5.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \n\nF$ Million \n\n$ Million \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency\n\nTotal \nCost \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency\n\nTotal \nCost \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n \n\nItem \n \n \nInvestment Costsa \nA. \n1  Water Supply Rehabilitation and Expansion  \n \n2  Sewerage Rehabilitation and Expansion \n \n3  Management \u2013 Works \n \n4  Management \u2013 Institutional Development \n \n5  Land \n \n6  Taxes and Duties \n \n  Subtotal (A) \n\nSubtotal (B) \n\n1  Physicalb \n2  Pricec \n \n\n \nB.

The  benefits  of  water \nsupply  and  sewerage  systems  are  widely  accepted  and  documented.  Foremost  among  these \nare  health  benefits  (e.g.,  reduction  in  disease  and  work  time  lost  due  to  illness)  and \nenvironmental  benefits  (e.g.,  higher  standard  of  living  and  cleaner  environment).  These \nsignificant  benefits  are  not  easily  quantified.  A  lower  incidence  of  disease  and  better \nenvironmental  conditions  may  result  from  many  factors,  including  the  proposed  investments. \nEconomic  analyses  have  been  developed  for  the  Project's  water  supply  and  sewerage \ncomponents individually. \n \n3.   \n\nThe following general assumptions have been adopted for the reappraisal: \n(i) \n\nPrices  have  been  updated  to  reflect  current  (August  2009)  cost  estimates  and \ncosts. \nThe least-cost analyses carried out for the Project in the 1999 master plan used \n1999 constant prices; hence, it is unnecessary to update them since the options \nhave not changed and price adjustments will affect all equally.  \nEach project component is assumed to have a useful economic life of 40 years \nafter  construction  for  civil  works,  and  15  years  for  electrical  and  mechanical \ncomponents.  For  the  ADB-funded  project,  replacements  have  been  included  at \n2.5% of previous investment once every 5 years. \nThe  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  used  in  the  economic  analysis  is \nassumed to be the standard 12% per year. \nThe average household size is 5.5 persons. Based on 2009 water consumption \ndata, they approximately consumed 180 liters per capita per day (lpcd). Supplies \nare  assumed  to  have  constrained  demand,  which  is  estimated  to  be  200  lpcd \nwith present incomes and present tariffs. \n\n(vi)  Wastewater generation is estimated at 80% of water consumption. \n(vii)  Capital  costs \n\ninclude  physical  contingencies \n\n(15%)  but  exclude  price \n\ncontingencies and interest during construction. \n\n(viii)  All  economic  costs,  in  particular  of  imported  tradeable  inputs,  are  net  of  duties \n\nand taxes.  \nThe economic opportunity cost of raw water provided to the Project is assumed \nto be zero. There are no competing uses of the raw water such as irrigation in the \nSuva\u2013Nausori area. \nThe average official exchange rate of F$2.01 per $1.00 (as of August 2009) has \nbeen  employed  in  converting  foreign  exchange  costs  to  their  local  currency \nequivalent. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\nEconomic Analysis  \n\n1. \n\nWater Supply \n\n \nB. \n \n\n \n\n4.    Capital  and  operating  costs  were  forecast  for  the  duration  of  the  Project.  After  these \nperiods,  operating  costs  are  held  constant  with  an  allowance  made  for  replacement  and \nrehabilitation at 2.5% of project capital costs every 5 years. No residual values are assumed at \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n35 \n\nthe  end  of  40  years.  Operating  costs  include  direct  operation  and  maintenance,  salaries  and \nwages, and overhead.  \n \n5.   \nThe physical project will provide water for sale, mainly through decreased physical and \nfinancial losses. The assumptions made for total losses are as follows: 2009, 53%; 2010, 40%; \n2011, 35%; 2012, 30%; 2013, 30%; 2014, 25%, and 2015 onwards, 20%.  \n \n6.    Non-incremental benefits include the following: (i) cost savings in meeting the demand of \nnew customers at present satisfied demand levels; and (ii) integration of the small water supply \nsystem  servicing  Colo-I-Suva  into  the  Suva\u2013Nausori  regional  water  supply  system.  The  cost \nsavings in meeting the demand from new domestic customers was based on the difference in \nthe  annual  cost  of  households  obtaining  water  from  sources  other  than  the  regional  water \nsupply  system\u2014including  rain  water  capture,  collection  of  water  from  shallow  wells,  and \npurchase  of  water  during  dry  periods  (about  2  months  per  year  and  costing  F$8.00  per  cubic \nmeter  [m3])\u2014and  the  annual  cost  of  water  for  a  typical  household  with  5.5  occupants,  each \nconsuming 180 liters per day calculated at current domestic tariff. The cost savings in meeting \nthe  demand  from  new  commercial  customers  is  based  on  the  difference  in  the  cost  of \npurchasing  water  from  water  tanker  operators  at  F$8.00  per  m3  and  the  cost  from  the \ncommercial tariff of F$0.53 per m3. Cost savings from decommissioning the small water supply \nsystem  that  services  Colo-I-Suva  following  the  expansion  of  the  Suva\u2013Nausori  regional  water \nsupply  system  to  Colo-I-Suva  in  2009  is  estimated  at  F$15,000  per  year  through  reduced \noperator inputs and electricity and fuel costs. \n \n7.   \nIncremental  benefits  include  the  following:  (i)  meeting  suppressed  domestic  and \ncommercial  demands,  and  (ii)  non-revenue  water  consumed  under  the  Project.  As  a  result  of \nlow water pressure to some consumers and frequent water disruptions, supplies are assumed to \nhave constrained demand. The average domestic per capita consumption of water is 180 lpcd. \nThe  demand  is  estimated  to  be  200  lpcd  (based  on  volumetric  measurements  to  domestic \nconnections  during  periods  of  normal  water  pressure)  with  present  incomes  and  tariffs.  The \nannual cost saving that is estimated to result by satisfying suppressed domestic demand from \nthe  regional  water  supply  system,  assuming  a  suppressed  demand  of  20  lpcd,  a  typical \nhousehold  of  5.5  occupants,  and  a  willingness  to  pay  of  F$0.156  per  m3,  is  F$6.26  per \nhousehold. The suppressed commercial demand is estimated to average 200 liters per day per \ncommercial connection. Commercial suppressed demand is currently met through the purchase \nof  water  from  water  tanker  operators  at  an  average  cost  of  F$8.00  per  m3.  The  annual  cost \nsaving  that  will  result  by  satisfying  commercial  suppressed  demand  from  the  regional  water \nsupply system at the current commercial tariff rate of F$0.53 per m3, is F$545 per commercial \nconnection. Valuation of these benefits is summarized in Table A8.1. \n \n8.    Willingness-to-pay  data  used  in  the  economic  analysis  was  obtained  from  a  2004 \ncustomer  survey  and  statistical  analysis  of  customer  willingness  to  pay  for  water.  The  survey, \nwhich interviewed 250 randomly selected water supply customers, sought information on each \nrespondent\u2019s socioeconomic background, occupation, education level, and other parameters. It \nincluded  statistically  quantifiable  and  testable  questions  indicating  the  respondents\u2019  degree  of \nwillingness  to  pay  for  water,  under  hypothetical  increases  in  the  quality  and  reliability  of  the \nwater supply service. Although the majority of respondents were low income, the study found a \nslightly positive but significant willingness to pay more for water than the respondents currently \npay\u201425%  more  than  a  bill  based  on  the  minimum  block  rate  of  $0.125  per  1,000  liters.  The \nwillingness  to  pay  survey  and  analysis  also  found  that  expressed  willingness  to  pay  is  highly \nconstrained  by  a  lack  of  credibility  of  the  hypothetical  improvements  in  supply  that  the \nrespondents  generally  shared,  no  doubt  borne  of  long  experience  with  frequent  and  lengthy \nsupply interruptions and the widely perceived ineffectiveness of the Water Supply Department to \naddress such problems. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n36  \n \n \n\nA.

Operating  costs  are  held  constant  with  an  allowance  for  replacement  and \nrehabilitation at 2.5% of project capital costs every 5 years. Salaries, wages, and overhead have \nbeen added to direct operation and maintenance. No residual values are assumed at the end of \n40 years.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n37 \n\n11.   Quantified benefits of Project's sewerage components include the following: (i) avoided \ncost of replacing and deluding septic tanks for the 9,300 urban allotments that will be connected \nto the sewerage system as a result of the Project and enforcement of existing laws compelling \nproperty  owners  to  connect  to  sewerage  systems  where  available;  and  (ii)  avoided  costs  of \nreplacing  the  Kinoya  sewage  treatment  plant  and  existing  sewers,  which  would  be  required  in \nthe  absence  of  the  Project's  rehabilitation  and  augmentation  works  for  the  Kinoya  sewage \ntreatment plant and rehabilitation of key sewers. \n \n12.  \nIn the absence of the sewerage components of the Project, about 6,300 households and \nbusiness  in  the  Suva\u2013Nausori  area  will  continue  with  individual  on-site  treatment  systems, \nwhich are primarily small septic tanks. For the economic analysis, a design life of 15 years has \nbeen  assumed,  during  which  all  households  would  rely  on  septic  tanks  for  sewage  treatment \nand disposal, and the design life of the septic tanks is 15 years. The average cost of a septic \ntank  built  to  building  code  requirements  is  F$4,000  (or  F$267  per  year).  Because  of  the \nrelatively high household occupancy rate in the Suva\u2013Nausori area (5.5 persons), septic tanks \nrequire pumping out on average once every 3 years. The average septic tank pumping out cost \nis F$500 (or F$167 per year). \n \n13.  \nExisting sewers in the low-lying sections of the Suva\u2013Nausori area, including the Suva \ncentral business district (CBD) and Nausori town, are dilapidated and prone to leaks. Many of \nthe sewers are more than 60 years old, constructed from concrete, and located below the mean \nsea  level.  Seawater  that  leaks  into  the  sewers  is  pumped  to  the  Kinoya  and  Nausori  sewage \ntreatment  plants,  adding  to  the  costs  of  operating  the  sewerage  system.  A  survey  in  1999  to \nestimate the volume of sea water entering the Suva City sewers concluded that more than 50% \nof the inflow to the Kinoya sewage treatment plant was seawater. The high seawater content in \nsewage  inflow  to  the  Kinoya  plant  has  resulted  in  accelerated  dilapidation  of  the  mechanical \nsystems. \n \n14.  \nThe sewage pump stations that pump sewage from collector and trunk sewers within the \narea  are  also  highly  dilapidated  and  frequently  are  out  of  service.  This  results  in  a  buildup  of \npotentially lethal hydrogen sulfide gas, which is (i) an occupational health and safety issue for \nsewer  system  operators,  and  (ii)  extremely  corrosive  to  concrete  and  metallic  structures.  The \ncombination of high seawater content and hydrogen sulfide gas within the sewers, if unchecked, \nwill ultimately result in the failure of sewerage system, which could require the replacement of \nsewers  and  the  entire  Kinoya  sewage  treatment  plant.  The  replacement  cost  of  the  sewers  at \ncurrent prices is estimated at F$45 million within the Suva CBD and F$9 million in Nausori town. \nThe  cost  to  replace  the  Kinoya  plant  is  estimated  at  F$30  million.  The  Project's  sewerage \ncomponents, particularly the inflow and infiltration (leak) reduction component, the rehabilitation \nof  the  Kinoya  plant,  and  the  rehabilitation  of  major  and  minor  sewage  pump  stations,  will \nsignificantly  delay  the  need  for  the  replacement  of  sewers  and  the  Kinoya  sewage  treatment \nplant. For the purposes of this economic analysis, the replacement of the Kinoya plant has been \nassumed  to  be  required  in  2015.  The  replacement  of  sewers  in  the  Suva  CBD  has  been \nassumed to be required in 2015 and for Nausori town in 2020. \n \n15.  \nThe  estimated  EIRR  for  the  sewerage  component  of  the  Project  is  12.7%.  Sensitivity \ntests for the project sewerage component yield EIRRs of less than 12% under adverse changes \nin some of the assumptions (Table A8.3). \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n38  \n \n\nTable A8.3: Economic Sensitivity Analysis for Sewerage Components \n(%) \nChange \n\nEIRR \n\nItem \n\nSV \n\nBase Case \n\nCapital Costs Increase \n\nOperating Costs Increase \n\n \n\n20 \n\n20 \n\n12.7 \n\n11.9 \n\n12.3 \n\n \n\n18.2 \n\n37.3 \n\nTotal Benefits Decrease \n  3.8 \n( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, SV = switching value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n  9.0 \n\n(20) \n\n \n\nc. \n\nWater Supply and Sewerage Combined \n\n \n16.  \nThe net economic flows for the water supply and sewerage components were combined \nto provide an estimated EIRR of 13.8% for the overall Project.

Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nPoor  persons  in  the  Suva\u2013Nausori  area  suffer  from  poor  quality  of  water  supplies,  lack  of  sanitation,  and  pollution  of  the \nstreams and underground water. Infantile diarrhea is common, and many households are forced to boil their drinking water to \npurify it, which is costly. \n \nThe Project will help provide potable water without frequent service interruptions, which are common for the majority of poor \nhouseholds in the project area. It will also make sewage collection available, although with a lower coverage than water, to a \nsubstantial number of poor households. Further, the Project will help improve the quality of water in the streams and coastal \nareas along which many poor people live. It will substantially benefit the poor by improving the quality of their water supply, \nimproving  their  sanitation,  reducing  pollution  and  eliminating  the  need  to  boil  drinking  water  for  those  with  pipes  or  water \nconnections. Since the cost of water and sewerage will decrease for the poor, the net benefit flows will be substantial. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                 Targeting Classification: General intervention (GI) \n1. Key Issues  \nSome  of  the  poorest  households  in  the  Suva\u2013Nausori  area  have  limited  access  to  safe  water  and  adequate  sanitation. \nConsequently, they are at greater risk than the general community for waterborne diseases. The poorest households cannot \nafford access to the  water supply  or to better sanitation facilities, resulting in more  health risks, environmental degradation, \nand  loss  of  amenities.  The  Project  directly  benefits  the  poorest  households  in  the  Suva\u2013Nausori  area  by  increasing  the \ncoverage  and  the  level  of  service  of  the  water  supply  and  sewerage  systems.  Poor  households  will  also  benefit  from \nenvironmental improvements resulting from better wastewater management services. \n \n2. Design Features  \nThe  Project\u2019s  water  supply  component  will  help  reduce  health  risks,  such  as  infantile  diarrhea,  that  are  caused  by  the  lack  of \nwater and contamination of water arising from low pressure in the piped system. It will also provide water for cooking, washing, \nand bathing, and reduce the need to boil  water. Improvements to sewage disposal to prevent contamination of  waterways  will \nbenefit the poorest residents who live in swampy, low-lying, poorly draining areas near the coast, such as in Vatuwaqa and along \nthe Samabula River. Residents of these communities use these waterways for fishing and supplementing their food sources. The \nenvironmental benefits of the Project\u2019s sewerage component will improve the quality of life for the poorest people. Because of the \nglobal financial crisis and recent political events, more households in the Suva\u2013Nausori area are facing hardship. \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe 2002 urban Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) found that about 45% of housing in the project area was \nof  lower  standard  than  that  in  settlements,  Housing  Authority  units,  squatter  areas,  or  urban  villages.  The  2002  HIES  also \nfound that 26.5% of the urban population lived in settlements, with an additional 10.3% living in squatter areas. Those living in \nHousing Authority or Public Rental Board flats accounted for 5.3% of the urban population, and urban villages accounted for \n4.5%.  The  2002  HIES  also  noted  that  the  highest  unemployment  rate  (23.1%)  was  found  in  the  urban  villages,  closely \nfollowed by squatter areas (19.8%), Housing Authority or Public Rental Board flats (17.6%), and settlements (15.8%). It was \nfurther  noted  that  77.2%  of  the  unemployed  had  achieved  a  secondary  level  education,  and  15%  had  post-secondary \neducation.  The  Central  and  Eastern  Division  urban  areas\u2014primarily  the  Suva\u2013Nausori  corridor\u2014accounted  for  55%  of \nunemployment. Of these unemployed, just more than half were living in low-quality housing, squatter settlements, or villages, \nwhere the findings of the participatory assessment of hardship conducted under the ADB technical assistance for preparation \nof  national  poverty  reduction  strategies  in  Pacific  developing  member  countries  in  February\u2013March  2003  suggested  that \naccess to safe water and sanitation is the poorest. \n \nAlthough the 2002 urban HIES reported that 96% (up from 93% in 1996) of households in the project area had access to a \nsafe  water  supply,  this  figure  is  misleading.  While  many  households  have  access  to  a  piped  supply,  this  is  frequently \ninterrupted and poor quality. Of the remainder, 2.2% used a communal standpipe, while 1.5% obtained water from rainwater \ntanks,  wells,  rivers,  or  some  other  method.  Communal  standpipes  were  located  only  in  informal  settlements  and  villages. \nSignificantly, only one household indicated it was obtaining water from a river or creek, and this was not its sole source.  \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n40  \n \nThe 2002 HIES reported that in the Suva\u2013Nausori urban area the proportion of households with a flush system was 83% with \na  further  8%  having  water-seal  latrines.  About  30%  of  households  are  connected  to  the  Suva\u2013Nausori  regional  sewerage \nscheme. The HIES reported that 80% of households used pit latrines or did not have any access to sanitation facilities. Pump \nstation and sewer overflows, pit latrine and septic tank seepage, and industrial discharges all end up in waterways. This is a \nthreat to public health since these waterways are used for fishing and collecting shellfish, and are close to where many people \nlive. The most vulnerable people are squatters along rivers or creeks, such as in Kinoya and Vatuwaqa. \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nConsultations have been ongoing with stakeholders throughout the project implementation period. \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n Information sharing    \n\n Consultation   \n\n Collaborative decision making   \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nThe  Project  includes  a  community  education  and  public  awareness  program,  which  was  implemented  under  the  attached \ntechnical assistance. The program was undertaken during 2006 and included  \n\n Yes  \n\n No  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\npreparation and pre-testing of information resources, \nconsultative group meetings, \npublic relations activities, and \ndevelopment of the communication program. \n\n \n\nC.  Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues. Lack of water places an extra burden on women and children by making the collection and storage of water \nmore  difficult.  Intermittent  cuts  in  water  supply  inconvenience  women  the  most.  In  both  indigenous  Fijian  and  Indo-Fijian \ncultures,  women  have  prime  responsibility  for  water  and  sanitation  at  home.  They  are  the  principal  carers  for  children,  and \nthey  have  control  over  food  preparation,  bathing,  toileting,  and  hygiene  of  these  children.  Thus,  the  Project  will  have  a \nsignificant  effect  on  women  in  terms  of  improving  environmental  conditions,  the  water  supply,  and  family  health  conditions. \nThe community education and awareness program also targets women. \n \n2.
