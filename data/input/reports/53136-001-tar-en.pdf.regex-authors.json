Justification \n \n1.  The transaction technical assistance facility (TRTA facility) will provide environment and \nsocial risk management, capacity building, and support to future and ongoing projects within the \nSouth Asia region. The TRTA facility will build on and expand the scope of TA 8569-REG, an \nearlier technical assistance (TA) that enhanced safeguards policy application in selected South \nAsia region developing member countries (DMC).1 Notwithstanding the achievements of TA \n8569-REG, the expansion of Asian Development Bank (ADB) operations in the region indicates \nthat it is  imperative to maintain TA support. This is particularly relevant for infrastructure projects \nthat typically involve significant environment and social risks such as urban transport and services, \nand  renewable  energy.  This  proposed  TRTA  facility  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  key \ngovernment units, civil society, academe, consultants, and contractors to design, implement, and \nmonitor robust measures that address project risks to people and the environment.  \n \n2.  Alignment with Strategy 2030.2 To operationalize the priority of Strategy 2030 on \nstrengthening governance and institutional capacity, the TRTA facility will uphold environment \nand social standards through more effective safeguards implementation and management.  While \nthe focus on ADB-supported operations, the intervention is relevant and applicable to all projects \nregardless of financing.  \n \n3.  The policy frameworks that govern safeguards, including the ADB Safeguard Policy \nStatement (SPS),3 seek to avoid, minimize, or mitigate adverse environment and social impacts \nof investment projects. In particular, the safeguard policies of DMCs and multilateral finance \ninstitutions  promote  the  mitigation  of  vulnerability,  a  major  risk  to  social  and  environment \nsustainability of projects, as well as protecting the rights of persons likely to be affected by the \nprojects. Implementation of safeguard measures has thus necessarily become embedded in the \nprocess of project preparation and implementation as it enhances project sustainability.  \n \n4.  The  TRTA  facility  seeks  to maintain  ADB\u2019s  role  as  a  trusted  development  partner, \ndelivering quality operations while adding practical value to projects that fit local conditions, \nidentifying  lessons  learned,  and  replicating  good  practices  in  environment  and  social  risk \nmanagement. It will support environment and social safeguards due diligence, consultation, \nsupervision, monitoring, and grievance redress in ADB-funded projects in all the South Asian \ncountries and sectors within these countries. This will be essential for the smooth preparation and \nimplementation of the ADB\u2019s 2020-2022 programs in South Asia DMCs. The programs include \nsome 140 proposed projects involving a total of $22 billion in ADB funding.4 Of these projects, \nabout 24% may have significant adverse environment and/or involuntary resettlement impacts, \naround  66%  may  have  less  significant  adverse  impacts,  and  only  approximately  10%  are \nexpected to have no impacts. Projects with significant adverse and less adverse impacts require \nthorough  impact  assessment,  timely  preparation  of  the  safeguard  plans  and  strong \nimplementation support. \n \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2013.

Since the proposed TRTA facility will cover all the South Asian countries, and ultimately \nsectors within these countries, it will not be appropriate or suitable to incorporate the proposed \nTRTA facility into a single loan-financed operations. This TRTA facility is not listed in the current \nCountry Operations Business Plans (COBPs) of South Asia DMCs but will support projects listed \nin the respective COBPs (Appendix 1).5 Further, it will complement other TA projects in supporting \nimproved project implementation and will not duplicate ongoing assistance which addresses \nportfolio management in general. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n6.  Output 1: Environment and social risk management capacity improved. The TRTA \nfacility will support environment and social safeguards capacity building of government agencies \nin the region. It will continue to improve safeguard results by providing hands-on support to \nexecuting and implementing agencies (EAs/IAs) upon request or assessment by ADB project \nteams.  This  will  include  providing  assistance  to  civil  society,  academe,  contractors,  and \nconsultants on the timely submission and improved quality of impact assessments and mitigation \nplans. The support would cover as necessary the entire project cycle, from the preparation of \ndetailed project reports, due diligence reports, impact assessment and mitigation plans, internal \nand external monitoring reports, and assessments of safeguard results at project completion. The \nTRTA facility will support workshops and related training programs on environment and social \nsafeguards.6 The training programs would be identified based on the assessment of capacity of \nproject implementation agencies. In addition, consultants will be engaged to review and provide \nanalysis of issues and proposed measures for safeguards strengthening. \n \n7.  At least ten training programs will be conducted for staff of EAs/IAs, civil society, academe, \ncontractors, and consultants on environment and social impact assessment, management plan, \nand monitoring reports in line with national, agency, and sectoral policies and ADB SPS.7 \nIndividual consultants will be engaged to conduct at least four studies on international safeguard \nbest practices and standards. Individual consultants will undertake activities in close interaction \nwith EAs/IAs, ADB, and other stakeholders.  \n \n8.  Output 2: Project management and supervision capacity of executing agencies \nstrengthened using advanced technology applications. Cost reduction is a measure for more \neffective and efficient safeguards implementation. One of the ways is using advanced technology \nto improve efficiency in data collection. Advanced technology includes remote sensing, satellite \nimaging,  use  of  drones,  global  positioning  and  other  hand-held  devices,  and  web-based \napplications. The TRTA facility will maintain and enhance South Asia Department\u2019s (SARD) \nenvironment and social safeguard tracking systems and develop new platforms for impact \nassessment, monitoring, and grievance redress. Based on consultations between ADB and \nrelevant agencies in each country, the TRTA facility will identify one or two projects in selected \nDMCs to be the focus of advanced technology application. Individual consultants on advanced \ntechnology will be engaged to assist in the use of new technology. The application of advanced \n \n5   ADB. 2019.

The feasibility of the use of advanced technology \napplication will be assessed by ADB safeguards staff in consultation with TRTA facility consultants \nand EAs/IAs.  \n \n9.  At least two workshops and related training programs will identify and focus on critical \nneeds and problems that can be addressed by advanced technology. Good practices and lessons \nwill be documented, shared, and replicated. Visits to institutions in regional countries where \nadvanced technology is effectively implemented, and partnerships can be developed will also be \nconsidered. \n \n10.  Output 3: Guidance material and knowledge products enhanced. The TRTA facility \nteam will select suitable projects programmed for ADB processing during the period 2020-2022 \nand use them to apply the knowledge acquired in related capacity building initiatives with a view \nof highlighting best practices in safeguards implementation.  \n \n11.  Individual consultants will be engaged to conduct at least four studies on international \nsafeguard  best  practices  and  standards,  and  prepare  guidance  notes  and  manuals  on \nenvironment and social safeguards.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TRTA facility is estimated to cost $3.0 million which will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The TRTA facility activities for an ensuing project will start only after ADB approves the \nproject concept paper on the ensuing project. \n \n14.  ADB will administer the TRTA facility. The TRTA facility will commence in November 2019 \nand will be completed by November 2022. SARD\u2019s Portfolio, Results and Quality Control Unit is \nthe  focal  point  within  ADB  and  will  be  responsible  for  the  coordination,  supervision,  and \nimplementation of all TRTA facility activities. The unit will be responsible for the selection, \nengagement  and  evaluation  of  consultants  and  will  manage  and  oversee  TRTA  facility \nimplementation, working closely with the sector divisions, and resident missions within SARD, \nand EAs/IAs in South Asia DMCs.  \n \n15.
