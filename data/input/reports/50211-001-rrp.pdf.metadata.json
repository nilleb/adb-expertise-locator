The  government  has  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  cofinance  the \nproposed  project  on  a  parallel  basis  with  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA). \nADB  will  support  upgrading  and  climate-proofing  56  km  of  the  road  connecting  the  towns  of \nManatuto and Baucau, and JICA will support the section between Dili and Manatuto (49 km). \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nThe  government\u2019s  Strategic  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132030  aims  to  promote  economic \n3. \ngrowth,  fast-track  economic  development,  and  modernize  and  diversify  the  economy  by \nproviding  the  country  with  high-quality  infrastructure.2 Current  government  operational  plans \nconcentrate on upgrading roads to achieve quick returns and transformational changes needed \nfor economic progress, inclusive development, and social stability. \n \n4. \nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2016\u20132020 for Timor-Leste  maintains  ADB\u2019s  focus \non  the  development  and  management  of  infrastructure,  and  on  complementary  activities  that \nsupport the private sector as a driver of change.3 The country partnership strategy aims to help \nthe  country  make  services  more  available  outside  of  the  capital  city  of  Dili  by  improving \ntransport  connectivity,  which  will  (i)  reduce  poverty  by  giving  the  poor  access  to  markets  and \nbasic  public  services,  and  (ii)  help  spread  economic  activity  and  the  benefits  of  the  country\u2019s \npetroleum wealth more broadly to areas beyond the capital. The Dili to Baucau road is expected \nto stimulate a range of economic activity, particularly tourism, which Timor-Leste is specifically \ntargeting to create employment opportunities. \n \nThe  road  network  in  Timor-Leste  deteriorated  during  a  25-year  conflict  from  1975  until \n5. \n1999  that  preceded  independence  in  2002  due  to  a  lack  of  investment  in  maintenance  and \nrehabilitation. Progressive deterioration continued during 2002\u20132011, and poor road conditions \nhave  constrained  the  country\u2019s  efforts  to  develop.  In  2010,  ADB,  JICA,  and  the  World  Bank \nsigned  a  joint  aide  memoire  pledging  to  coordinate  their  support  for  a  5-year,  1,000  km  core \nroad program.4 At the time, ADB was working with JICA toward cofinancing of the Dili to Baucau \nroad as part of this core road program. Subsequently, JICA decided it would support the Dili to \nBaucau  road  on  its  own,  while  ADB  developed  its  support for  other  priority  roads.  Since then, \nADB,  JICA,  and  the World  Bank  have  continued  to  collaborate  closely  with  each  other,  and  a \nvigorous  program  of  road  upgrading  is  now  under  implementation  and  managed  by  a  joint \nproject management unit (PMU). \n \n\n                                                 \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of Timor-Leste. 2011.

The shortfall comprises 100% of the civil \nworks  cost  of  the  Manatuto  to  Baucau  section  of  the  project  (approximately  $59  million).  The \ngovernment,  which  had  originally  intended  to  self-finance  the  shortfall,  became  aware  of  the \nadvantages of availing itself of concessional financing rather than depleting its sovereign wealth \nfund.5 The government now aims for at least 75% of a project designated for loan financing to \nthe \nloan-financed.  This  policy  was  reinforced  by  recommendations  resulting  from \nbe \nInternational  Monetary  Fund\u2019s  yearly  bilateral  discussion  with  Timor-Leste.6 The  government \nalso  appreciates  that  oversight  of  development  partners  provides  a  better  framework  for \ndisciplined project administration and implementation. The government has therefore requested \nADB to help meet the financing shortfall. \n \n7. \nThe project comprises two civil works packages, both of which have been procured and \nawarded in accordance with JICA procurement policies. ADB has been requested to finance the \npackage for the Manatuto to Baucau section of the project. ADB has conducted a detailed post-\nreview  of  the  procurement  process  carried  out  by  the  government  for  that  package,  including \nprequalification  and  bidding  documents,  bidding  procedures,  and  contract  documentation \nprocurement process and bid evaluation. ADB has concluded that the package was procured in \na  manner  consistent  with  the  principles  of  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended \nfrom time to time). A summary of the assessment is in paras. 19\u201320 and 25. ADB\u2019s financing of \nthe  Manatuto  to  Baucau  section  will  enable  the  entire  road  between  Dili  and  Baucau  to  be \naccomplished to the appropriate standards, and help achieve the full benefits of the project. \n \n8. \n ADB  has  financed  the  Road  Network  Development  Sector  Project,  the  Road  Network \nUpgrading  Project,  and  the  Road  Network  Upgrading  Sector  Project  (RNUSP). 7 The  Road \nNetwork Upgrading Project and the RNUSP were scaled up with additional financing from ADB. \nIn total, development partners will have supported the upgrading of about 560 km (39%) of the \nmost  important  sections  of  the  national  road  network  by  the  end  of  2019.  The  Government  of \nAustralia  and  the  European  Union  have  focused  on  road  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  of \nsecondary  rural  roads  through  the  development  of  small-scale  contractors  and  community \ninvolvement. The European Union is financing a project for rehabilitating 43 km of rural roads in \neconomically  important  coffee-growing  areas,  which  will  be  administered  by  ADB.  ADB\u2019s \nprojects are on track to upgrade 287 km of national roads by 2019, of which 100 km have been \ncompleted.  Projects  completed  to  date  are  of  high  standards  and  are  delivering  the  expected \nbenefits. \n \n9. \nThe  Ministry  of  Public  Works,  Transport  and  Communications  (MPWTC)  lacks  the \ninstitutional capacity needed to properly implement capital works or maintain road assets. ADB-\nfinanced  technical  assistance  is  supporting  the  implementation  of  a  capacity  development \n                                                 \n5   Timor-Leste has a sovereign wealth fund (the Petroleum Fund) of approximately $16 billion, which is derived from \n\nits oil and gas revenues. \n\n6   International  Monetary  Fund.  2016.

Manila. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\nframework and a strategic development plan for the MPWTC. A PMU embedded in the MPWTC \nis  responsible  for  managing  ADB,  JICA,  and  World  Bank  programs.  It  has  considerable \nexperience  in  dealing  with  the  requirements  of  development  partners  and  other  government \nagencies.  The  PMU  has  successfully  coordinated  the  various  programs  of  development \npartners  and  has  ensured  that  technical  standards  and  safeguards  have  been  consistently \napplied across these programs. \n \n10. \nThe  MPWTC  plans  to  introduce  performance-based  maintenance  contracts  for  all \nupgraded  roads.  However,  civil  works  contracts  for  all  development  partner-financed  roads \nrequire  contractors  to  carry  out  routine  maintenance  for  2  years  after  the  defects  notification \nperiod.8 Two  performance-based  maintenance  contracts  have  been  piloted  under  ADB\u2019s  Road \nNetwork Development Sector Project (footnote 7). An international road maintenance specialist \nfinanced by ADB has provided support to the MPWTC\u2019s newly created maintenance division in \npreparing  its  detailed  road  maintenance  plan  for  2016.  Technical  assistance  from  JICA  is \nsupporting a 3-year capacity development program for road maintenance. It commenced in May \n2016 and is actively supporting implementation of the 2016 annual road maintenance plan and \nthe development of future programs. \n \n11. \nThe  proposed  project  comprises  upgrading  the  most  heavily  trafficked  road  outside  of \nDili,  which  links  the  capital  to  Bacau  as  well  as  the  entire  eastern  half  of  the  island.  Traffic \nvolumes  vary  between  2,000  and  1,200  vehicles  per  day  along  its  length,  comprising  a  high \nproportion  of  light  goods  vehicles  and  buses.  The  existing  road  is  4.5  meters  (m)  wide  and  in \npoor condition. Upgrading will comprise climate-proofing measures and widening to 6.0 m, with \n1.0  m  shoulders.  Climate  change  and  climate  resilience  measures  include  drainage  designed \nfor increased rainfall intensity, provision of a resilient pavement surfaced with 50-millimeter-thick \nasphalt,  raising  of  the  road  in  flood-prone  areas,  and  general  application  of  best  engineering \npractices.  The  European  Space  Agency  provided  technical  assistance  that  allowed  for  more \naccurate determination of historical rainfall intensity in the catchments of water courses affecting \nthe  project.  This  information  resulted  in  the  conservative  design  (oversizing)  of  drainage \nstructures to cater for the increased rainfall intensity that has been forecasted for the future. \n \n12. \nADB is supporting a national road safety action plan under the RNUSP (footnote 7). The \ngovernment established a Road Safety Directorate in the Ministry of the Interior in early 2016, \nwhich  will  be  responsible  for  prioritizing  and  implementing  activities  under  the  national  road \nsafety  action  plan.  All  donor-financed  projects  (including  past  projects)  include  raising  road \nsafety awareness in roadside communities and schools. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n\nThe impact of the project will be increased and more efficient movement of people and \n\n13. \ngoods. The outcome will be a more reliable and safer road network. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n14. \nThe outputs of the project will be the (i) upgrading and climate-proofing of 105 km of the \nnational  road  between  Dili  and  Bacau,  (ii)  expansion  of  performance-based  maintenance,  and \n(iii) generation of awareness of road safety and transport-related social issues. \n\n                                                 \n8   A defects notification period is where the contractor is responsible for correcting defects and making repairs on an \nupgraded road within 1 year after completion of construction. The contractor is responsible for maintenance of the \naccepted works for 2 years after this 1-year period ends. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nD. \n \n15. \n \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $126.58 million (Table 1). \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA.  \n \n \n \n \nB.  \nC.  \n \na  Includes taxes and duties of $10 million to be financed from government resources, and Asian Development Bank \n\nBase Costb \n1.  \n2.  \n3.  \n \nContingenciesd \nFinancing Charges During Implementatione \n \n\nCivil worksc \nResettlement \nConsulting services \nSubtotal (A) \n\n  \n107.60 \n1.50 \n6.50 \n115.60 \n6.12 \n4.86 \n126.58 \n\nTotal (A+B+C) \n\n \n\nAmounta \n\n(ADB) and Japan International Cooperation Agency loan resources. \n\nb  In mid-2016 prices. \nc  The civil works cost is the accepted contract amount, which includes 2% for contingencies.  \nd  Price contingencies computed at 4% on foreign exchange costs and 4% on local currency costs.

The  loan  will  finance  civil  works,  consulting \nservices,  taxes  and  duties,  and  financing  charges  during  implementation  on  the  Asian \nDevelopment Fund loan. \n \n \n17. \nThe  government  will  contribute  $27.19  million  to  the  cost  of  the  overall  project.  The \ngovernment contribution will finance civil works, land acquisition, taxes and duties, audit costs, \nand  resettlement  costs. 9 The  government  has  assured  ADB  that  it  will  meet  any  financing \nshortfall to help support the full implementation of project outputs. In 2012, JICA provided loan \ncofinancing in the amount of JPY5,278 million on a parallel basis. This amount will finance civil \nworks for the Dili to Manatuto section and consulting services.

Financing of taxes and duties is material and relevant to \nthe success of the project. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n18. \nA  PMU  established  in  the  MPWTC  is  responsible  for  the  management  of  all  loan-  and \ngrant-financed  projects  for  upgrading  of  national  roads,  including  those  of  ADB.  The  PMU  is \nheaded  by  a  project manager  and  has  a full-time  professional  staff,  including  a  chief technical \nadvisor,  a  road  construction  advisor,  a  road  maintenance  engineer,  and  a \nfinancial \nadministrator.  As  the  PMU's  portfolio  responsibilities  grow,  it  has  also  strengthened  steadily.  \nInternational and national specialists provide a full-time safeguards unit within the PMU. \n \n19. \nThe government carried out the procurement of both civil works packages for the project \nthrough  international  competitive  bidding  in  accordance  with  JICA  procurement  policies.  The \nmultilateral  development  banks\u2019  harmonized  standard  bidding  documents  with  JICA\u2019s \nrequirements were used. The civil works contract for the road section from Manatuto to Baucau \n(to  be  financed  by  the  ADB  loan)  was  awarded  on  22  December  2015  and  signed  by  the \ngovernment  and  contractor  on  31  March  2016.  To  accommodate  the  government\u2019s  request  to \nfinance  this  contract,  ADB  (with  assistance  from  an  external  consultant)  conducted  a  detailed \npost-review  of  the  procurement  process  and  bid  evaluation  for  this  civil  works  package  to \nensure  that  procurement  was  undertaken  in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  principles  of  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines.10 The  review  confirmed  that  this  is  the  case.  Financing  the  contract \n(instead of rebidding under ADB requirements) helps achieve economy and efficiency in project \nimplementation  given  the  use  of  standard  bidding  documents  and  substantial  similarity  of \nprocurement  and  evaluation  processes.  Eligible  bidders  were  provided  with  the  same \ninformation  and  equal  opportunity  to  compete  in  the  bidding,  and  there  was  sufficient \ncompetition.  There  was  adequate  transparency  in  the  single-stage  procurement  process,  i.e., \ntwo-envelope procedure preceded by a prequalification exercise with detailed evaluation reports \nprepared  by  the  government  that  were  subject  to  JICA\u2019s  prior  review  and  clearance  for  the \nprequalification, technical evaluation, and price evaluation stages. While the contractor is a joint \nventure comprising two firms from ADB members, the contract does not place any restriction on \nthe  origin  of  goods  to  be  supplied  under  the  contract.  Neither  the  joint  venture  nor  the  firms \nconstituting the joint venture are subject to ADB sanctions. The government and JICA confirmed \nthat no representations or complaints were received in connection with the procurement. Since \nthe procurement of the contract has already been completed and can no longer be carried out \nunder  ADB\u2019s  Procurement Guidelines,  and  because  the  contract  does  not restrict the  origin of \ngoods  to  be  supplied  under  the  contract  to  ADB  members,  the  Board\u2019s  approval  is  sought  to \nwaive  the  applicability  of  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  and  ADB\u2019s  member  country \nprocurement eligibility restrictions11 for the financing of this contract package. \n \n20. \nThe  government  has  also  requested  retroactive  financing  for  the  Manatuto  to  Baucau \ncontract  up  to  20%  of  the  ADB  loan  amount  for  a  period  not  exceeding  12  months  from  the \nsigning  of  the  loan  agreement.  One  of  the  requirements  for  retroactive  financing  is  for \nprocurement to follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The Board\u2019s approval is sought to waive \nthis  requirement  on  the  grounds  that  procurement  has  already  been  completed  under  JICA \nauspices, and that ADB is satisfied with the manner in which the procurement was undertaken. \nTo  ensure  that  other  ADB  requirements  are  adhered  to,  environmental  and  social  safeguard \nprovisions  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  as  well  as  other  pertinent  policy \nprovisions (such as those related to labor standards and anticorruption) will be incorporated in \n                                                 \n10  Executive  Summary  of  Procurement  Review  on  ICB/21/MPWTC-2015\u2013Upgrading  of  Manatuto\u2013Baucau  Road \n\n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n11 To  permit  procurement  (i)  in  countries  that  are  not  (a)  developing  member  countries  of  ADB  or  (b)  developed \nmember  countries  of  ADB  that  have  contributed  to  the  Asian  Development  Fund;  and  (ii)  of  goods,  works,  and \nservices produced in such countries. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nthis civil works contract through a contract amendment to be signed by the government and the \ncontractor  prior  to  loan  disbursement.

ADB will finance the civil works contract package for \nthe Manatuto to Baucau road; JICA will finance the civil works package for the Dili to Manatuto \nroad on a parallel basis. Design and procurement of construction supervision services (covering \nboth packages in a single contract) have also been completed under the auspices of JICA and \nare 100% financed by the JICA loan. Construction commenced in August 2016. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical  \n\n23. \nThe project is relatively straightforward and adopts the same technical specifications and \nprocedures  applied  in  other  national  road  upgrading  projects  financed  by  ADB  and  the  World \nBank. The pavements of the roads to be upgraded will be reconstructed and will allow for faster \ntravel and substantially reduced vehicle operating costs. Climate resilience is emphasized in all \ndesigns regardless of the source of financing. Vulnerability to damage from extreme rainfall, sea \nlevel  rise,  and  other  potential  effects  of  climate  change  will  be  reduced  through  engineering \ncountermeasures,  including  providing  suitably  sized  drainage  structures,  raising  road  levels  in \nflood-prone  areas,  and  using  bioengineering  to  promote  slope  stability.  A  2-year  post- \nconstruction performance-based maintenance component is included in both the ADB and JICA \ncivil works packages. \n\n                                                 \n12  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n24. \nEconomic and financial analysis has been undertaken for the project in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.13 The project has an economic internal \nrate  of  return  of  14.8%  and  a  net  present  value  of  $16.5  million.  Fuel  prices  as  of  June  2016 \nhave been used in the analysis. If fuel prices return to June 2015 levels, the economic internal \nrate  of  return  would  increase  to  approximately  16.6%.  As  civil  works  contracts  have  already \nbeen  awarded,  construction  costs  are  known  with  a  high  degree  of  certainty.  The  engineering \nassessment found that the cost of maintaining an upgraded road in Timor-Leste is significantly \nless  than  the  maintenance  cost  of  unimproved  roads.  The  cost  of  maintaining  the  road  in  the \nwith-project case is $0.25 million per year, while the cost of maintaining the road in the without-\nproject case is estimated to be $0.75 million. From 2013 to 2016, the government has allocated \n$43.5 million for the rehabilitation of roads, in addition to approximately $15 million per annum \nfor reconstruction of national roads. The Petroleum Fund currently stands at approximately $16 \nbillion  and  is  prudently  managed,  so  Timor-Leste  is  well  placed  to  allocate  funds  for \nmaintenance of assets. 14 \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n25. \nThe  National  Procurement  Commission  was  established  in  2011.  Since  2012,  it  has \nsatisfactorily  administered  a  number  of  bidding  processes  for  ADB-financed  projects  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  However,  the  transparency  and  efficiency  of \nprocurement  still  needs  improvement,  and  a  balance  between  risk  and  accountability  for \nprojects that do not have development partner oversight has not yet been achieved. \n \n26. \nThe  public  financial  management  system  is  heavily  centralized  with  numerous  controls \nthat  have  slowed  payment  processes  and  weakened  budget  implementation.  The  Ministry  of \nFinance  has  promoted  decentralization  of  noncore  financial  management  functions  to  line \nministries, as capacity within these agencies has increased. However, the system for payments \ncontinues to involve a number of agencies in reviewing the payment certificates provided by the \nPMU and MPWTC. \n \nThe  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n27. \nGuidelines on the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects, and Financial Due Diligence: \nA  Methodology  Note.15 The  financial  management  assessment  considered  the  capacity  of  the \nCouncil  for  Administration  of  the  Infrastructure  Fund  (CAFI)  through  the  Major  Projects \nSecretariat, and of the MPWTC through the PMU, including funds flow arrangements, staffing, \naccounting  and  financial  reporting  systems,  financial  information  systems,  and  internal  and \nexternal auditing arrangements. Based on the assessment, the key financial management risks \nidentified are the absence of internal audit function, inadequate reporting by the PMU, and the \nlack of credibility of the budget process. The overall pre-mitigation financial management risk of \nthe CAFI and MPWTC, as it relates to the project outputs, is moderate. The CAFI (through the \nMajor  Projects  Secretariat)  and  the  MPWTC  (through the  PMU)  have  agreed  to  implement  an \naction plan as a key measure to address the deficiencies. \n \n\n                                                 \n13  ADB. 1997.

Guidelines on the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila; ADB. 2009. Financial Due \n\nDiligence: A Methodology Note. Manila.     \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nThe  executing  agency,  the  CAFI,  was  established  in  2011  to  oversee  the  use  of  the \n28. \nInfrastructure  Fund.  The  Civil  Service  Act  provides  standards,  principles,  definitions,  and \nguidelines  for  civil  service  administration;  a  code  of  ethics  for  civil  servants;  and  an \nadministrative  disciplinary  mechanism.  A  law  creating  the  new  Anti-Corruption  Commission \nbecame effective in 2009, and the first anticorruption commissioner was appointed in 2010. \n \n29. \nTo  mitigate  risks,  the  MPWTC  has  implemented  a  number  of  ADB-supported \ninfrastructure projects through its PMU. The PMU will oversee the implementation of the project. \nThe  PMU  has  a  financial  administrator  who  has  considerable  experience  with  ADB-financed \nprojects.  Based  on  previous  project  implementation  experience,  the  PMU  has  demonstrable \ncapacity to manage the project. \n \n30. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  the \ngovernment  and  CAFI.  Specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the project administration manual (footnote 12). \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\n31. \nThe  primary  beneficiaries  of  the  project  are  (i)  road  users,  including  vehicle  drivers, \npassengers,  and  nonmotorized  transport  users;  (ii)  households  in  communities  that  sell  cash \ncrops and other agricultural produce; (iii) providers of passenger and goods transport services, \nand commercial truck drivers; and (iv) small businesses and traders, including vendors at local \nmarkets,  trade  store  owners,  coffee  and  other  produce  buyers,  and  small-  and  medium-sized \nenterprises.  These  groups  will  particularly  benefit  from  more  reliable  and  less  costly \ntransportation, resulting in lower cost of production and improved and more diversified economic \nactivities.  Key  social  service  providers, such  as those  in  the  education  and  health  sectors,  will \nalso benefit from increased accessibility and utilization of social services due to road upgrading. \nWomen  have  been  generally  excluded  from  infrastructure-related  jobs  and  decision-making \nrelated  to  infrastructure  development.  To  address  this  within  the  project,  it  will  incorporate \nwomen\u2019s  views  during  implementation,  and  women  will  be  encouraged  to  participate  in  an \nHIV/AIDS prevention program, and road safety and other awareness activities. Flexibility in the \nexisting project design will be explored to incorporate gender elements where feasible.     \n    \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n32. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  categorized  as  B  for  environment.  Following  the  process \nand  procedures  already  established  by  the  PMU,  JICA-financed  consultants  completed  an \nenvironmental assessment, including an environmental management plan (EMP), for the Dili to \nBaucau  section  of  the  national  road.  ADB  reviewed  the  environmental  assessment  (including \nthe  EMP)  to  confirm  that  it  complies  with  Timor-Leste\u2019s  country  safeguard  system  for \nenvironment  and  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  assessment \nconfirms that the environmental effects of the project will be similar in scale and impact to those \nof completed and ongoing road projects. The potential impacts will be site-specific and readily \nmitigated through measures identified in the EMP. Few, if any, of the impacts will be irreversible. \nCapacity  building  of  the  PMU\u2019s  environmental  safeguards  staff  will  be  ongoing  through \nextension  of  the  contracts  of  the  international  specialists  providing  mentoring  and  on-the-job \ntraining.    Additional  resources  will  be  provided  through  specialists  assigned  to  the  design  and \nsupervision consultants\u2019 teams to help support the PMU effectively implement this project. For \nenvironment safeguards, next steps will include (i) providing induction training to the successful \ncontractor  for  preparation,  and  subsequent  implementation,  of  the  site-specific  EMP;  and  (ii) \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nmonitoring  the  contractor\u2019s  compliance  with  the  site-specific  EMP  approved  by  the  PMU,  and \npreparing and submitting semiannual safeguards monitoring reports by the PMU.     \n \n33. \nSocial  safeguards. The project is categorized as B for involuntary resettlement and C \nfor indigenous peoples in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. Road upgrading \nand  rehabilitation  will  be  conducted  within  the  existing  road  corridor,  with  widening  requiring \nsmall  strips  of  land  beyond  the  government-reserved  area.  As  much  as  possible,  construction \nlimits  are  set  within  the  existing  alignment  to  minimize  land  acquisition  impacts.  The  ADB-\nfunded Manatuto to Baucau section is considered the most sensitive, with 137 affected persons \nexperiencing  major  impacts  from  losing  residential  houses  and/or  permanent  commercial \nkiosks, which constitute more than 10% of each affected person\u2019s income-earning assets. The \nJICA-financed  Dili  to  Manatuto  section  will  have  133  affected  persons  experiencing  the  same \nimpacts. Two separate resettlement plans (one for the Dili to Manatuto section and one for the \nManatuto  to  Baucau  section)  have  been  prepared  jointly  by  JICA-financed  project  design \nconsultants  and  the  PMU  and  started  implementation  in  July  2016.  A  social  compliance  audit \nhas  been  undertaken  to  assess  the  project\u2019s  compliance  with  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \nand  to  recommend  corrective  actions to  bring  it  into  compliance  prior to  ADB financing  of  civil \nworks.  ADB  and  JICA  will  administer  their  respective  road  sections  with  joint  supervision  and \nmonitoring of safeguards activities through the PMU, which will work closely with the safeguards \nteam  under  the  construction  supervision  consultant.  Key  stakeholders  and  affected  persons \nhave been consulted during the resettlement plan preparation and disclosure, and will be further \nconsulted  during  implementation.  The  social  compliance  audit  report  will  be  disclosed  on  the \nADB website and to affected persons and other relevant stakeholders. Capacity building of the \nPMU\u2019s  national  social  safeguard  staff  will  be  provided  by  maintaining  and  extending  the \ncontracts of international specialists in the PMU. \n \n34. \nThe project is not expected to impact any distinct and vulnerable groups as defined by \nthe Safeguard Policy Statement and therefore does not require an indigenous peoples plan. The \nproject  will  support  and  promote  the  participation  of  local  communities,  and  it  will  work  to \nprovide them with culturally appropriate benefits. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n35.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 16  The  risks  can  be  managed  and  are \nmitigated  by  the  design  of  the  project.  The  intended  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to \noutweigh the costs. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nLand acquisition delays the start of civil \nworks \nDifficult environment (high rainfall and \nunstable terrain)  \nMPWTC in-house capacity for \ntechnical guidance and supervision is \nweak \nInadequate reporting on project costs, \nlack of internal audit function that \nundermines internal controls,  and the \nlack of credibility of the budget process \n\nMitigating Measures \nResettlement  plans  will  be  finalized  and  compensation  will be  paid  before \ncivil works begin.
