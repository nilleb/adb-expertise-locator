The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical \nassistance  (TA)  for  Gender  Capacity  Enhancement  in  Poultry,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.  \n \nThe project will support Suguna\u2019s expansion across 13 identified states in India with the \n2. \nconstruction  of  modern  feed  mills,  hatcheries,  environment-controlled  sheds,  and  meat \nprocessing lines; and the expansion of the company\u2019s contract farming program from 40,000 to \n55,000 smallholder poultry farmers. The TA will focus on building the farm management skills and \nfinancial  literacy  of  4,500  women  contract  farmers.1 The  project  will  improve  livelihoods  and \ngender inclusion in rural areas, reduce malnutrition through the production of affordable proteins, \nand mitigate the impact of livestock farming on the environment and on climate change. \n   \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n1. \n\nProject Identification \n\n \n3. \nImportance of poultry in India. Livestock contributes about 5% to India\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct  and  nearly  12%  to  rural  household  income.  As  income  per  capita  grows,  the  Indian \npopulation is shifting towards better nutrition in the form of high-protein diets, including meat. Of \nthe  meat  categories,  broiler  (chicken)  meat  is  the  fastest-growing  segment  in  India  because, \nunlike beef and pork, it is free of major religious associations. Globally, India is the fourth-largest \nbroiler producer, with an estimated output of about 5.1 million metric tons (t) in fiscal year (FY) \n2019, after the United States, Brazil, and the People\u2019s Republic of China. In addition, poultry is \nan  important  employer,  with  the  industry  (broiler  and  layer)  employing  nearly  30  million \nsmallholder farmers.2 \n\nMalnutrition. India is home to the largest number of malnourished children in the world \n4. \nand about 40% of Indian children are undernourished. Poultry meat consumption in South Asia is \nonly about 20% of the intake prescribed by the healthy reference diet recommended by the EAT-\nLancet commission on food, planet and health.3 The development of poultry production can help \naddress these issues as poultry is one of the cheapest sources of animal protein and contains \nessential vitamins and minerals.4 \n  \n5. \nBiosecurity  risks.  Poultry  farms  in  India  have  traditionally  been  exposed  to  diseases, \nwhich  have  caused  moderate  losses.  The  first  major  avian  flu  incident  in  India,  reported  in \n\n \n\n \n\n1  The  13  states  include  Andhra  Pradesh,  Assam,  Bihar,  Chhattisgarh,  Gujarat,  Karnataka,  Maharashtra,  Punjab, \nOdisha, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. The number of women farmers trained could be \nincreased to 10,000, if additional TA funding is secured. \n\n2  Government of India, Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers' Welfare. 2017. National Action Plan for Egg & Poultry-2022 \n\nfor Doubling Farmers\u2019 Income by 2022. \nhttp://www.dahd.nic.in/sites/default/filess/Seeking%20Comments%20on%20National%20Action%20Plan-\n%20Poultry-%202022%20by%2012-12-2017.pdf   \n\n3  W. Willet et al. 2019. Food in the Anthropocene: the EAT-Lancet Commission on healthy diets for sustainable food \n\nsystems. Oslo. \n\n4  D. Farrell. 2013. The role of poultry in human nutrition. Poultry Development Review.   \n\nhttp://www.fao.org/3/i3531e/i3531e02.pdf  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fFY2006,  led  to  the  culling  of  about  1  million  birds.5 Since  then,  India  has  experienced  about \n28 episodes of disease in some states, reported mostly by poultry farms to central government \nagencies. In all reported outbreaks, as per government policies, all birds in broiler farms within \nthe prescribed radius were promptly culled to prevent the disease from spreading. \n \n6. \nClimate change impact. The livestock industry contributes to 14.5% of all human-induced \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; however, about 81% of that is attributable to ruminants, 10% \nto pigs and only 9% to poultry.6 Poultry farming is more efficient than cattle farming in producing \nanimal proteins because its feed conversion ratio is lower.7 Poultry also emits less GHGs than \ncattle because the digestion process does not emit methane. Finally, poultry farms consume less \nwater per unit of protein, leaving more water for irrigating crops. \n \nGovernment  policy  alignment.  To  address  the  dual  challenge  of  rural  poverty  and \n7. \nmalnutrition, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Government of India launched an ambitious program \nto double farmers\u2019 incomes by 2022 (footnote 3). The program envisages various steps to support \nagricultural  development,  including  subsidizing  interest  rates  for  poultry  farmers,  providing \nspecialized  education  and  skill  development  and  raising  awareness  of  the  nutritional  value  of \npoultry. The program aims to support farmers' livelihood diversification and income improvement \nand at the same time tackle the malnutrition challenge. \n \nProject  selection.  Suguna  is  one  of  the  largest  agribusiness  companies  in  India.  The \n8. \nproject team considered Suguna a suitable candidate for Asian Development Bank (ADB) support \nbecause (i) its vertically integrated business across the poultry value chain allows it to be resilient \nto commodity price shocks; (ii) its strong track record of working with smallholder poultry farmers \nhas  resulted  in  improved  rural  livelihoods;  and  (iii)  it  is  willing  to  partner  with  ADB  so  it  can \nenhance its environmental and social standards and strengthen gender participation across its \noperations and its contract farms. \n  \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n \n9. \nThe project will support Suguna\u2019s strategy of strengthening upstream integration to make \nthe  business  more  resilient  to  commodity  price  shocks  while  scaling  up  the  contract  farming \nmodel. The project entails capital expenditure (capex) of $50.5 million during FY2020\u2013FY2022 to \nconstruct  20  feed  mills,  four  environment-controlled  sheds  for  breeders,  eight  hatcheries,  and \nvarious  meat  processing  lines.8 The  TA  will  complement  the  capex  plan  by  strengthening  the \ncapacity of women for engagement as contract poultry farmers. \n \n10. \nImproved  rural  livelihoods.  Suguna  pioneered  contract  poultry  farming  in  India.  It \ncurrently works with 40,000 contract farmers across 19 states, particularly targeting smallholders \n(1 hectare or less).9 With Suguna\u2019s engagement, farmers are able to significantly increase their \npoultry  income  contributing  to  the  the  Government\u2019s  National  Action  Plan  of  doubling  farmers \n\n \n\n5  Code Partners Pte.

The subprojects to be funded are yet to be specified. \n9  Suguna is active in Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya \nPradesh, Maharashtra, Mysore, Punjab, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, \nand West Bengal.  \n\n2 \n \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nincome.10 Farmers are supplied with all inputs, including day-old chicks, feeds, and medicine, and \nare responsible for rearing the chickens. These chickens are then lifted by Suguna and either sold \nlive  via  wet  market  or  processed  into  chicken  meat.  Farmers  are  paid  a  fixed  fee  plus  a \nperformance bonus per chicken for their services. This enables farmers to have much-needed \nincome  certainty  as  the  market  price  risk  is  borne  by  the  company.  Suguna  also  helps \nstrengthening the climate resilience of farmer livelihoods as poultry is more resilient to climate \nshocks than cropping. Suguna plans to work with 55,000 contract farmers by FY2025. \n \nIncreased  gender  participation.  Suguna  prefers  to  contract  with  poultry  farms  where \n11. \nboth husband and wife are engaged in the farm work, since it has observed positive outcomes\u2014\ngreater  productivity  and lower  chicken  mortality\u2014whenever  women are involved.  In the Indian \nrural  context  where  safe  and  socially  acceptable  employment  options  for  women  are  limited, \npoultry farming provides an important avenue to participate in a livelihood activity.11 With ADB\u2019s \nTA  support,  Suguna  plans  to  train  women  on  best  practices  in  poultry  farming  and  build  their \nfinancial literacy. In addition, it aims to encourage women's employment in project operations. \n \nClimate change mitigation and adaptation. Suguna\u2019s planned capex was designed to \n12. \noptimize a decentralized operations model whereby regional production infrastructure (feed mills, \nhatcheries,  and  environment-controlled  sheds)  is  set  up  near  raw  material  (corn  and  soya) \nproduction  hubs  and  contract  farmer  clusters.  The  plan  is  part  of  the  company\u2019s  strategy  to \ndiversify  biosecurity  risk  and  also  drive  down  the  large  transportation  costs  associated  with \ncentralized production. The company expects to lower the overall transportation distance by 14 \nmillion kilometers annually, saving about 3.27 million liters (or 2,740 tons) of fuel.12 As a result, \nthe project team estimated that at least 8,728 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions will be \navoided annually.13 Besides, the company and contract farmers are moderately exposed to the \nconsequences of climate change, as the farms are designed to mitigate the impact of changes in \ntemperature  and  rainfall.  Although  the  adaptation  benefits  were  not  quantified,  the  project  will \ncontribute to enhancing the climate change resilience of both the company and contract farmers.14 \n \n13. \nImproved nutrition security and food safety. India\u2019s per capita consumption of broiler \nmeat is increasing but is still just 2.5 kilograms per annum, much lower than the world average \n(14.3 kilograms). 15 The  project  will  allow  the  company  to  increase  annual  production  of  live \n\n \n\n10 Each farmer participating in the Suguna contract farming scheme manages on average 5,500 birds and earns an \nincome of about $3.2/day from poultry alone. Poultry income typically constitutes 60%\u201370% of the income for these \nfarming households. Contract farmers are the backbone of Suguna\u2019s production operation. \n\n11 Suguna  signs  the  vast  majority  (93%)  of  its  supplier  contracts  with  men  because  of  the  strong  cultural  norms \n\nassociated with the \u201cmale head of household.\u201d \n\n12 The decentralized production setup (project scenario) helps reduce the transportation distance associated with the \ncentralized production model (baseline scenario). In the baseline scenario, the project team assumed that a loading \ntruck would travel a greater distance from the central site to the regions where raw materials and clusters of farmers \nare located; in the project scenario, such facilities are in the same regions. \n\n13 Climate financing can be claimed for ADB investments that directly help mitigate GHG emissions. Of the total capex \nof $50.5 million, only investments related to feed mills ($28.4 million) are considered as climate finance since fuel \nsavings were the key driver for the decision to decentralize feed production. As ADB\u2019s funding share is about 49.5% \nof the total capex, about $14.06 million (49.5% of $28.4 million) is deemed climate finance. The total carbon avoided \nwas computed as the total volume of fuel saved multiplied by the net calorific value and emission factor of fuel. ADB \nguidelines suggest using a net calorific value of 0.043 terajoules per ton and a carbon emission factor of 74.1 tons \nof carbon dioxide per terajoule for diesel fuel (ADB. 2017. Guidelines for Estimating Greenhouse Gas Emissions of \nAsian Development Bank Projects: Additional Guidance for Clean Energy Projects. Manila.) \n\n14 Environment-controlled  sheds  protect  the  chickens  from  variations  in  temperatures  and  humidity.  Further,  the \ncompany\u2019s decentralized operations mitigate the risk of supply chain disruptions caused by extreme weather events \nthat affect long-distance transportation. \n\n15 Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development.  OECD  Data.  https://data.oecd.org/agroutput/meat-\n\nconsumption.htm (accessed 2 January 2020).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fchickens and poultry meat products from 1.0 million t to 1.8 million t over FY2020\u2013FY2025, giving \nabout 100 million consumers increased access to affordable animal protein. Further, Suguna\u2019s \nuse antibiotics for poultry under strict veterinarian prescription mitigates the risk of antimicrobial \nresistance and contributes to food safety.16        \n \n\n3. \n\nBorrower \n\n \n14. \nSuguna is India\u2019s largest broiler enterprise, with an annual production volume of 1 million \nt, turnover of about $1.3 billion (FY2019), and a broiler market share of 15%. Headquartered in \nCoimbatore (Tamil Nadu), the company is present in 19 states (footnote 11), employs about 8,000 \npeople (mostly in rural areas), and empowers more than 40,000 contract broiler farmers and more \nthan 200,000 corn and soybean farmers across rural India. Suguna is vertically integrated across \nparent breeding, hatchery operations, feed mills, broiler farming, and meat processing.  \n \n15. \nBrothers  Bangarusamy  Soundararajan  (current  chairman)  and  Ganapathypalayam  \nBangarusamy Sundararajan (current managing director) established Suguna in 1984.17 They are \nfirst-generation entrepreneurs and have a strong background in agriculture. Suguna is 99.65% \nowned  by  Suguna  Holdings  Private  Limited  (Suguna  Holdings),  which  has  subsidiaries  in \nBangladesh, Kenya, India, and Sri Lanka. Suguna carries the group\u2019s India business and is the \nflagship  company,  contributing  more  than  95%  (FY2019)  to  the  group\u2019s  revenue.  Suguna  is \nultimately owned by the founders\u2019 family through a trust, which owns 100% of Suguna Holdings. \nWhile no formal shareholder agreement exists, the four children of the founders were appointed \nas the beneficiaries of the trust through a written family governance deed.  \n \nSuguna  is  a  professionally  run  organization  governed  by  its  board  of  directors,  which \n16. \nconsists of seven members and meets every quarter. To date, the board consists of four family \nmembers  (the  promoters  and  two  of  their  children  who  are  involved  in  the  business),  two \nindependent directors, and one employee director.  \n \nADB  conducted  integrity  due  diligence.18 Suguna\u2019s  founders,  shareholders,  managers, \n17. \nand significant contracting entities do not appear to constitute a significant or potentially significant \nintegrity risk, since no unresolved or substantiated adverse media or other relevant information is \nrelated to them. Tax integrity due diligence was not required.19  \n \nB. \n \nImpact. The project is aligned with the Government of India\u2019s National Action Plan for Egg \n18. \nand  Poultry  up  to  2022,  in  particular  the  goals  of  doubling  farmers\u2019  income  and  preventing \nmalnutrition among children.20  \n \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs  \n\n \n\n16 Suguna has 16 senior veterinarians who work under the National Head of Health. Each veterinarian is placed in a \nregional head office and is responsible for covering branches in the region. In addition, Suguna maintains 16 regional \ndiagnostic labs and an advanced testing lab in Coimbatore to ensure proper diagnosis. Antibiotic use is only allowed \nwhen diagnostic labs have confirmed a bacterial infection and under strict prescription of the veterinarians.  \n17 Bangarusamy is the father of the two promoter brothers.

The outputs of the project are: (i) feed production capacity increased, (ii) poultry \nfarming capacity increased, (iii) poultry meat production capacity increased, (iv) the company has \nbecome more gender-equitable, and (v) women farmers trained in poultry farming techniques and \nfinancial literacy. \n \nC. \n \n21. \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  project  is  aligned  with \nStrategy 2030, which calls for ADB \u201cto scale up its financing for agribusiness\u201d and \u201cto promote \ngender equality in at least 75% of the number of  ADB\u2019s committed operations by 2030\u201d.21 The \nproject  is  also  consistent  with  the  country  partnership  strategy,  2018\u20132022  for  India,  which \nsupports  (i)  increasing  agricultural  productivity  and  rural  incomes,  (ii) reducing  the  rural\u2013urban \nincome gap, (iii) doubling farm incomes within 5 years, and (iv) promoting gender equity.22 \n \n22. \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent with Strategy 2030 Operational Plan for Priority 5 (Promoting Rural Development and \nFood Security, 2019\u20132024) , which calls for (i) direct support to private agribusiness clients linking \nsmallholder farmers to markets; (ii) nonsovereign financing for sponsors across the food value \nchain  focusing  on  quality  standards  and  traceability;  (iii)  the  production  of  sufficient,  safe, \nnutritious,  and  affordable  food  for  urban  and  rural  consumers;  and  (iv)  the  reduction  in \nagriculture\u2019s contribution to GHG emissions through improved farming and livestock practices.23\n \nThe  project  is  also  aligned  with  Strategy  2030  Operational  Plan  for  Priority  2  (Accelerating \nProgress  in  Gender  Equality,  2019\u20132024),  which  seeks  to  expand  \u201coperations  in  support  of \nagribusiness  value  chains  whereby  women\u2019s  jobs  and  entrepreneurship  opportunities  will  be \nenhanced in higher value-generating activities.\u201d24 The project will also complement two upcoming \nsovereign agribusiness value chain projects in India.25   \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements.26 \n\nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\n \n\n21 ADB.  2018.

The \nFood Safety and Standards Authority of India governs animal processing.  \nSuguna has a project team of 25 members, led by the company\u2019s project head, who reports to \nthe managing director and has more than 20 years of project management experience. \n\nThe project will be implemented from FY2020 to FY2022.   \n\nConstruction  arrangements  include  civil,  mechanical,  electrical,  and  utility  works.  Suguna\u2019s \nprocurement policies and practices are compliant with ADB\u2019s procurement policies for private \nsector  companies.  For  every  project  site,  a  four-member  team  oversees  the  work \narrangements,  before  taking    an  operational  role  after  project  commissioning.  Each  project \nteam  conducts  a  weekly  review  to  ensure  continuous  progress  monitoring.  These  reviews \ninvolve on-site employees, project managers, the project head, and the managing director on \na monthly basis.  \n\nSuguna  has  developed  its  own  poultry  breed  housed  in  environment-controlled  sheds.  It \nproduces day-old chicks in its hatcheries and provides them to contract farmers for rearing. \nThe farmers are given poultry feed, vaccination, and monitoring support. Chickens are then \nlifted by Suguna and either sold live in the local wet markets or processed and then sold to (i) \nbusinesses and/or (ii) retail consumers through supermarkets and retail stores.  \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\nSuguna will report annually on  financial and operational KPIs for the group and the project, \nand on safeguard and development indicators (i.e., output and outcome targets). \n\nPerformance \nmonitoring \nADB = Asian Development Bank, FY = fiscal year, KPI = key performance indicator.   \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Suguna Foods Private Limited. \n \nF. \n \n[Redacted] \n \nG. \n \nThe  project  is  ADB\u2019s  first  assistance  to  an  inclusive  poultry  business  in  India.27 In  the \n24. \nIndian context, poultry farming has unique impacts on rural livelihoods and nutrition. In addition, \nSuguna is committed to strengthening gender mainstreaming in this important livelihood activity, \nand ADB will be providing TA to support this initiative (para. 35). \n \n\nUnique Features \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \n25. \nADB  will  provide  to  Suguna  a  long-term  senior  secured  corporate  loan  of  up  to \n$25,000,000 equivalent in Indian rupees. The loan has a tenor of 7 years with a grace period of \n2 years. The main terms and conditions of ADB\u2019s proposed loan have been agreed with Suguna. \n \nB. \n \n26. \n\nADB assistance will add value on three fronts. \n(i)  Gender  action  plan.  ADB  will  help  Suguna  implement  a  gender  action  plan  to \nincrease women\u2019s inclusion in employment opportunities, and increase the number \nof women contract farmers, through training supported by ADB\u2019s TA (para. 35).  \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n27 The  project is classified  as  an  \u201cinclusive  business\u201d project because more  than  half  of  its  beneficiaries  (Suguna\u2019s \nemployees and contract farmers) belong to the \u201cbase of the pyramid\u201d (bottom half of the income pyramid) in India. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\n(ii)  Safeguard  best  practices.  ADB  will  help  Suguna  implement  an  enhanced \nenvironmental and social management system (ESMS) following ADB\u2019s policies and \nbest  industry  practice  on  biosecurity,  animal  waste  management,  and  other \nsafeguards areas, and will monitor progress during project implementation.  \n(iii)  Diversified  funding  base.  Suguna  has  financed  its  growth  primarily  through \ninternally  generated  cash  flow  and  loans  from  local  commercial  banks.  ADB\u2019s \nfinancing will give Suguna\u2019s business a stamp of approval to further attract long-term \ncapital and partnerships from international sources. \n \nRisks \n\nTechnical Assistance  \n\nC. \n \n[Redacted] \n \nD. \n \nThe  proposed  TA  of  $190,00028 which  will  be  financed  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \n27. \nSpecial  Fund  (TASF-Others),  will  focus  on  training  rural  women  in:  (i)  poultry  farming's  best \npractices and (ii) functional financial literacy. The TA\u2019s output will be training of 4,500 rural women \nby  FY2022.  Suguna  will  assist  in  farmer  identification  and  selection  and  provide  in-kind \ncontribution in the form of training venue, transportation, and accommodation. The TA will help fill \nthe gender capacity gap in poultry farming in rural India. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n28. \nADB categorized the investment in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009)  as  follows:  environment  (category  B),  involuntary  resettlement  (category  C)  and \nindigenous peoples (category C).29  \n \n29. \nADB undertook due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social impacts \nof  the  project.  Approvals  of  site  establishments  and  operations,  as  well  as  standard  operating \nprocedures are contingent on measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for adverse \nimpacts, as outlined in the due diligence report and its corrective action plan. The environmental \nand social measures and Suguna\u2019s commitment to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental \nimpacts are deemed adequate. \n\n \n\n30. \nEnvironmental  and  social  audit  findings  and  recommendations.  An  external  third \nparty conducted a corporate audit in accordance with the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009) in relation to general corporate finance. Audits will be carried out prior to ADB\u2019s \ndisbursement for each subproject. The corporate audit found no reportable environmental, health, \nand  safety  incidents  but  observed  gaps  in  compliance  with  statutory  requirements  on \nenvironmental  monitoring,  specific  permits  at  operation  stage,  and  waste  management.  The \nproject is not expected to result in physical or economic displacement of people. The land for the \naudited  facilities  is  leased,  obtained  through  inheritance  or  purchased  from  private  owners  via \nwilling  buyer,  willing  seller  agreements.  Suguna  assessed  the  suitability  of  land  for  purchase, \nopting for industrial or agricultural land, and ensured lack of encumbrances through internal legal \nexamination of records and titles. Land acquisition required for subprojects will be via negotiated \n\n28 The TA could be scaled up to $385,000 to train 10,000 women farmers, depending on availability of funding. \n29 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fsettlement  under  willing  buyer,  willing  seller  arrangements.  No  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples \nare envisaged. Suguna\u2019s facilities are in agricultural or industrial zones and not in tribal areas.  \n \n31.  While Suguna does not have a formal ESMS, it has standardized operation procedures \ncovering  environmental, health,  and  safety  aspects  primarily  in relation to  waste  and  chemical \nmanagement,  and  occupational  health  and  safety;  but  none  for  social  matters.  Suguna  has \nagreed to (i)  develop  and implement  an  ESMS  in line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard Policy  Statement \nrequirements;  (ii)  build  capacity  to  implement  the  ESMS  and  recruit  a  senior  environment  and \nsocial manager; (iii) develop a formal process to screen, categorize, plan and review future ADB-\nfunded subprojects in line with the Safeguard Policy Statement; (iv) develop formal procedures \nand templates to identify environmental and social risks and impacts; (v) enhance monitoring and \nreporting requirements and implement compliance assurance measures; (vi) develop stakeholder \nengagement and information disclosure procedures as per the Safeguard Policy Statement; (vii) \ndevelop  a  grievance  redress  mechanism;  and  (viii)  provide  environmental,  social,  health,  and \nsafety training to staff and relevant third parties to ensure the implementation of the ESMS. These \nand other audit recommendations have been agreed in a corrective action plan for the project.  \n \n32. \nEffective gender mainstreaming. Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development \n(1998), Suguna incorporated measures to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. \nKey features of the gender action plan are steps to increase the number of supply contracts with \nwomen poultry farmers; have women employed at management level in project operations for the \nfirst time; increase the share of females employed in project operations; develop and implement \nguidelines aimed at increasing the share of women hired, retained, and promoted; train at least \n4,500  women  in  poultry  farming's  best  practices  and  in  financial  literacy;  and  provide  sex-\nsegregated toilets and change facilities at all project sites. Suguna will submit periodic reports on \nits implementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \n33. \nSuguna will (i) apply ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list, (ii) ensure that investments \nusing ADB funds comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and abide by national laws and \nregulations, and (iii) establish and maintain an ESMS satisfactory to ADB before disbursement. \nThe ESMS will set out requirements, as applicable, for compliance with national labor laws and \nmeasures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor standards, pursuant to ADB\u2019s \nSocial Protection Strategy (2001).30 The ESMS will also contain requirements, as applicable, for \ninformation disclosure and consultation with affected people following ADB requirements. Suguna \nwill report regularly to ADB on (i) its compliance with such laws and (ii) the measures taken.31 \n \nB. \n \n34. \nSuguna was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n \n[Redacted] \n \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n30 ADB. 2003.
