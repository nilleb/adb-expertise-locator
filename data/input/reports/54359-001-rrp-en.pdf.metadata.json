In the PRC, natural gas plays an important role as a cleaner and \n3. \nlower carbon emitting alternative to coal, which remains a dominant component  of the primary \nenergy  and  electricity  generation  mix.  Fuel  switching  is  a  policy  priority  of  the  government  to \naddress  chronic  air  pollution.  Natural  gas  is  consumed  by  residential  consumers  primarily  for \nheating and cooking, and by commercial and industrial consumers in power and heat generation \nand  in  industrial  processes.  When  it  is  made  available  to  end  users,  natural  gas  can  directly \nreplace coal consumption and/or displace predominantly coal-generated grid electricity. \n \nUnder a One Asian Development Bank (ADB) approach, the Private Sector Operations \n4. \nDepartment  (PSOD)  identified  HTL  as  a  private  sector  company  supplying  natural  gas  in  the \nurban  areas  of  Henan  Province  during  the  processing  of  the  Air  Quality  Improvement  in  the \nGreater BTH Region\u2014Henan Cleaner Fuel Switch Investment Program led by EARD. HTL jointly \noperates  Yu-Tian  New  Energy  Company  Limited,  the  company  that  will  be  an  implementation \nagent for the fuel switching program, and which will provide last-mile natural gas connections to \nend-users in the BTH region. PSOD followed up with HTL to support with a private sector solution \ncontributing to  sustainable  air quality  improvement.  Faced  with  prolonging  energy  bill  payment \ndelays from its customers, HTL requested that ADB provide a facility to help meet working capital \nneeds, thereby ensuring its financial sustainability and capacity to sustain uninterrupted natural \ngas supplies in Henan Province. \n \nTo enhance the resilience of cities, the Government of the PRC issued directives urging \n5. \nproviders of essential utility services to ensure the uninterrupted supply of  electricity, gas, and \nheating,  while  concurrently  extending  consumers\u2019  payment \n[CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION DELETED] The purpose of the government directives is to support consumers of \nessential utility services, who experienced a severe economic shock due to pandemic lockdowns, \nin  recovering  economically.  While  the  directives  are  effective,  HTL  still  needs  to  pay  for  the \nprocurement of natural gas supplies at the city gate. It is expected that these directives will remain \nin effect through at least the end of 2021, with increasing numbers of end users being sold energy \nsupplies  on  extended  payment terms,  leading  to increased  working capital  needs  for  essential \nutilities. \n \n\nterms. \n\n1   ADB.  2021.  Proposed  Results  Based  Loan,  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China:  Air  Quality  Improvement  in  the  Greater \n\nBeijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei Region\u2014Henan Cleaner Fuel Switch Investment Program. Manila (52007-001-PRC). \n\n \n\n\fAs an essential utility, HTL has been directed to sustain service provision, notwithstanding \n6. \nthe extension of payment terms for its customers. HTL, as a last-mile city gas distributor, has to \npay  for  procured  gas  at  the  city  gate  as  it  is  supplied,  and  earns  only  a  regulated  margin  on \nvolumes from end users inside cities, which have been delayed in receipt as they are subject to \nthe  extended  billing  cycle.  As  a  result,  HTL  faces  an  estimated  net  working  capital  increase \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]. \n \n7. \nProject design. The loan will support HTL\u2019s natural gas distribution operations for about \n510,000  residential  and  business  customers  in  Henan  Province.  This  will  help  HTL  and  five \noperating subsidiaries2 ensure timely, uninterrupted procurement of upstream energy supplies for \ndistribution to end users through existing distribution networks within each subsidiary\u2019s operating \nfootprint, even as outstanding bills from those end users grow. \n \n8. \nSustained and reliable delivery of natural gas through this project  will help households, \ncommercial, and industrial end users reduce fuel expenditure, save time because of more efficient \ncooking and heating, improve respiratory health. A disruption in local natural gas supplies will lead \nto  an  increasing  likelihood  of  end  users  having to  rely  on  alternative  energy  sources  including \npredominantly coal-generated grid electricity and would also discourage adoption of natural gas \nas  a  cleaner  fuel  alternative  which  would  negatively  impact  air  pollution  and  the  adoption  of \nclimate change mitigating infrastructure investments in the region. \n \n9. \nGender  context.  While  the  PRC\u2019s  growth  and  development  have  led  to  notable \nsocioeconomic progress, gender inequality has been increasing. Social transformation in the PRC \nhas resulted in a gender gap in the labor market and intensified conflict between work and family \nas traditional views of gender roles persist. Women spend an average of almost 4 hours per day \non  unpaid  care  work,  2.5  times  more  time  than  men.  The  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19) \npandemic has aggravated these inequalities faced by women who are juggling work with added \ndomestic  duties,  which  multiplies  if  a  family  member  becomes  sick.3 Access  to  clean  energy \nsources is likely to have a positive impact on the health and well-being of women.4 Use of modern \nfuels such as gas for cooking can reduce women\u2019s work and time burden and reduce indoor and \noutdoor pollution. The time saved can be used by women to improve their and their families\u2019 lives \nthrough education, income generation, or leisure.5 \n \n10. \nSponsor and guarantor. Headquartered in Henan Province, PRC, China Tian Lun Gas \nHoldings  Limited  (CTL),  the  project  sponsor  and  guarantor,  is  a  private  sector  company \nincorporated in the Cayman Islands and is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange6. It began \noperations  in  2004,  following  the  government's  2002  policy  decision  to  open  natural  gas \ndistribution to private sector participation. It was one of the earliest non-state-owned enterprises \nin the urban gas sector in the PRC. CTL\u2019s primary activities are constructing and operating city \ngas  pipelines  and  supplying  natural  gas  to  residential,  commercial,  and  industrial  end  users \n\n \n\n2   The five operating subsidiaries are Xuchang Tianlun Gas Co., Ltd., Zhengzhou Shangjie District Tianlun Gas Co., \nLtd., Henan Tianlun Gas Pipe Network Co., Ltd., Xiping Kaida Gas Co., Ltd. and Shenqiu County Huixin Natural Gas \nCo., Ltd. \n\n3  United Nations Development Program. 2020.

Other  business  lines  include  engineering  and \nconstruction of gas distribution infrastructure and long-haul gas transmission pipelines. Recently, \nCTL has focused on fuel switching, substituting coal and coal gas for natural gas. CTL is one of \nthe largest gas distribution companies in Henan Province and has a substantial presence in 13 \nprovinces  across  the  PRC.  CTL  manages  itself  and  HTL  in  accordance  with  the  mandatory \nrequirements of corporate governance norms specified by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Its \ngovernance structure broadly comprises the board of directors and the committees of the board \nat the group level, and the senior management at the operational level. The board of directors \ncomprises  four  executive  directors  and  four  independent  directors.  CTL  also  has  a  highly \nexperienced  management  team  with  technical  and  financial  capabilities.  Responsibilities  and \nauthorities are clearly divided between management and the board of directors. \n \nBorrower. The borrower is HTL, a wholly owned subsidiary of CTL incorporated in 2004 \n11. \nin the PRC, contributing 97% of CTL\u2019s total revenues. As of fiscal year (FY) 2019, HTL had 23 \nurban gas projects and one long-haul transmission pipeline in Henan Province, four urban gas \nprojects in Shandong Province, and two urban gas projects in both Gansu Province and Sichuan \nProvince. The company is the largest provider of piped gas in Henan Province and is connected \nto  3.2  million  residential  consumers  and  more  than  23,000  industrial  and  commercial  users. \nRevenues are primarily derived from city gas sales, installation fees, and long-haul pipeline gas \nsales. As  of  FY2019, HTL reported total  assets of  CNY11.31  billion, and revenues of  CNY6.37 \nbillion. \n \nIntegrity  due  diligence.  ADB  conducted  integrity  due  diligence. 7  HTL,  CTL,  its \n12. \nshareholders,  ultimate  beneficial  owners,  and  board  of  directors  do  not  appear  to  constitute  a \nsignificant or potentially significant integrity risk, as no unresolved adverse media or other relevant \nintegrity-related information is associated with them.

ADB conducted tax integrity due diligence.8 ADB obtained \n13. \nreasonable assurance that the transaction is not being used for tax secrecy, tax evasion, or tax \nfraud. \n \nPandemic  impacts.  The  government\u2019s  essential  utility  directive  has  led  to  a  sharp \n14. \nincrease in reported receivables for HTL: 44 days as of FY2019 to 75 days as of H12020. This \nadditional latitude in payment terms is being provided by HTL following the government\u2019s essential \nutilities  directive  to  support  the  post-pandemic  recovery.  In  financial  terms,  HTL\u2019s  accounts \nreceivables were reported at CNY776 million at the end of 2019, having increased to CNY1,219 \nmillion as of H12020 [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED].

The project will support the continuity of economic and social activities using \n\n16. \nnatural gas in Henan Province.  \n \n17. \nOutputs. The project will have the following outputs: (i) natural gas supplied to residents \nand businesses in cities in Henan Province on credit sustained, (ii) supply of natural gas on credit \nand  favorable  terms  for  households  with  a  single  mother  in  Henan  Province  sustained,  (iii) \nsupplies  of  basic  child  and  maternal  necessities  to  households  with  a  single  mother  in  Henan \nProvince supported, and (iv) knowledge sharing related to the clean energy transition in the PRC \nincreased. \n \nC. \n \nConsistency  with  ADB\u2019s  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  project  is  aligned  with \n18. \nADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  operational  priority  2  (accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality)  and \noperational  priority  4  (making  cities  more  livable).9 HTL\u2019s  Single  Mother  Care  Action  program, \nwhich will be implemented until the end of 2023 in line with the agreed ADB gender action plan \n(GAP), directly addresses the economic and social welfare of households with a single mother \nsupplied by HTL\u2019s distribution network. Ensuring the supply of natural gas will mitigate urban air \npollution  and  enhance  the  resilience  of  cities  as  they  continue  to  recover  from  the  economic \nimpacts  of  the  pandemic.  The  provision  of  gas  to  meet  basic  energy  demand  contributes  to \nbuilding livable cities by providing uninterrupted access to energy in urban areas and surrounding \ncommunities. No climate mitigation or adaptation financing has been estimated for this project. \n \n19. \nPRC country partnership strategy. The project addresses the first strategic priority of \nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC,  2021\u20132025, 10  which  calls  for  supporting \nenvironmentally  sustainable  development  and  health  security  through  private  sector  solutions, \nincluding last-mile connectivity and cleaner fuels (para. 36[iii] of the country partnership strategy). \n \nConsistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project embodies \n20. \nADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Private Sector Operations, 2019\u20132024,11 and ADB's Energy Policy,12 \nwhich emphasizes energy security and universal access to energy. The policies encourage ADB \nto  help  developing  member  countries  provide  reliable,  adequate,  and  affordable  energy  for \ninclusive growth in a socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable way. \n \n21. \nLessons  from  previous  operations.  Key  lessons  from  past  interventions  include \n(i) working  with  the  last-mile  service  deliverer  as  a  change  agent  for  access  to  vulnerable \nhouseholds, 13  (ii)  identifying  best-in-class  technical  operators  (from  the  public  and  private \nsectors)  capable  of  integrating  complex  gas  distribution  logistics,  (iii)  developing  a  good \nunderstanding of national and regional regulations to promote access to energy for different end \nusers\u2019 needs, and (iv) supporting transparency of the full gas distribution value chain, including \n\n \n\n9  ADB.  2018.

ADB\u2019s \nloan will have a 2-year tenor, 2-year weighted average life, and bullet repayment. The covenant \npackage  will  be  aligned  with  market  standards  to  the  borrower,  will  be  unsecured,  and  will  be \nguaranteed by the listed parent company, CTL. \n \nB. \n \nFinancial additionality. ADB\u2019s assistance is designed to fill a gap in the local financial \n27. \nmarket. HTL relies heavily on up to 1-year working capital facilities that are subject to monthly \nliquidity  quota  allocations,  which  can  make  urgently  needed  funds  suddenly  unavailable  for \ndrawdown.  Any  longer-term  financing  HTL  can  procure  is  typically  associated  with  fixed  asset \ninvestment  or  acquisition  and  must  be  secured  and  specifically  tied  to  that  use  of  proceeds \naccordingly. ADB\u2019s 2-year unsecured bullet facility will greatly enhance HTL\u2019s financial flexibility \nas (i) it is a firmly committed loan that will not become unavailable because of tight local lending \nmarket liquidity; (ii) it has a longer tenor than typical working capital facilities in the PRC market, \nwith  back-ended  bullet  maturity  that  can  accommodate  the  timing  uncertainty  associated  with \nprolonged end user payment delays; and (iii) it does not require additional security which is limited \nand HTL needs to make available for longer term capex financing. \n \nNonfinancial  additionality.  ADB\u2019s  engagement  with  this  project  will  promote  gender \n28. \ninclusiveness  in  HTL\u2019s  operations  through  the  agreed  GAP.  Building  upon  EARD\u2019s  previous \nsupport  for  corporate  governance  and  environmental  and  social  management  system  (ESMS) \nenhancement,  ADB  provides  a  corporate-wide  ESMS  audit  and  supports  HTL  in  the \nimplementation of robust environmental, social, and health management practices. Finally, with \nADB  Energy  Sector Group  technical  expertise  and  a  knowledge-sharing  workshop, the  project \nwill support HTL in developing a corporate strategy aligned with the PRC clean energy transition. \nAny  relevant  learnings  from  the  workshop  will  be  disseminated  to  other  developing  member \ncountries and stakeholders as appropriate. \n \nC. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n\nRisks \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n35. \nADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009)  as  follows:  environment  (category  C),  involuntary  resettlement  (category  C), \nand indigenous peoples (category C).16 \n36. \nADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social \nimpacts of the project and measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts  in  the  safeguard  reports  and  plans.  The  environmental  and  social  measures  and  the \ninstitutional capacity and commitment of HTL to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental \n\n16 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nimpacts are deemed adequate. The loan will be for working capital purposes only and will not be \nused to fund any new or ongoing projects that involve permanent or temporary land acquisition; \nany retrofits, rehabilitation, or expansion projects; or any activities that may directly or indirectly \naffect indigenous peoples or vulnerable ethnic minorities or scheduled tribes. The project activities \nare likely to have no adverse additional environmental impacts. \n \n37. \nThe  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC)  invested  in  CTL  for  a  project  in  2015  and \nprescribed an environmental and social action plan.17 As CTL had an ESMS in place at the time, \nthe action plan focused on the establishment of a corporate-level environment, health, and safety \n(EHS)  department  and  the  development  of  new  quantitative  risk  assessment  and  risk  audit \npolicies and procedures. IFC reported in its public disclosure that the company had completed all \ntasks  by  January  2016.  The  implementing  agency  for  the  ADB  2019  sovereign  program  loan \ninvolving CTL (Henan Yu-Tian New Energy Co. Ltd.) is a joint venture company established by \nHTL and a state-owned enterprise under the Henan Provincial Finance Bureau. HTL owns 40% \nof the joint venture company, which utilizes HTL personnel and infrastructure. The loan supports \nthe transition from coal to cleaner fuel for residential, commercial, and industrial users in select \nless-developed  counties  of  Henan  Province  by  expanding  the  gas  pipeline  network  and \ndeveloping a new alternative clean fuel biogas plant. Following ADB\u2019s extensive environmental \nand social due diligence, the project was placed in category B for environment and involuntary \nresettlement  and  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  Through  meetings  with  IFC  and  ADB \nsovereign counterparts, review of reporting to IFC and ADB, and assessment of the ESMS and \nother operational procedures, ADB\u2019s due diligence found that HTL is operating in conformance \nwith agreed and applicable requirements. \n \nHTL  operates  in  accordance  with  the  ESMS  followed  by  all  CTL  subsidiaries,  which \n38. \nincludes EHS and stakeholder engagement policies and procedures for managing aspects of its \noperations  that  meet  regulatory  requirements  and  IFC\u2019s  Performance  Standards.  CTL  has  a \ncorporate-level  EHS  department  responsible  for  safety  management,  environmental  and \noccupational health management, stakeholder engagement, production operation management, \nand  loss  management  for  existing  operations  and  potential  large  projects.  Through  the  EHS \ndepartment,  HTL  proactively  identifies  potential  health  and  safety  risks  in  the  workplace  to \ncontinuously improve occupational health management and to ensure that employees understand \nthe relevant risks and response measures. CTL publishes an annual environmental, social, and \ngovernance report in which it publicly discloses its EHS performance in the preceding year. The \n2019  annual  report  includes  coverage  of  personnel  safety  training  for  construction  and \nimprovements in safety management levels generally. HTL is also undergoing recertification for \nISO  9001 (Quality Management  System)  and  OHSAS  18001  (Occupational  Health  and  Safety \nManagement System). \n \n39. \nEffective  gender  mainstreaming.  Single  mothers  represent  70%  of  single-parent \nhouseholds in the PRC. A 2020 study found that most single mothers had incomes that were not \nsufficient  to  meet  daily  expenses;  they  lacked  social  safety  nets,  had  low  wages,  limited \nemployment opportunities, and significant time-poverty, which increased the probability of them \nfalling into extreme poverty. The COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated these inequalities (footnote \n4). Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (2003), HTL has incorporated measures \nto promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment in its business activities. Key features \nof the GAP are (i) at least 8,700 households with a single mother will be continuously supplied \nwith natural gas until the end of 2022 on favorable payment terms, including a 10% discount and \nan  additional  2-month  delay  in  payment  due  date;  and  (ii)  supplies  of  child  and  early \n\n17 IFC. 2015.

Households  with  children  below  the  age  of  3  will  benefit  from  these \nmeasures. HTL will submit periodic reports on implementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \nHTL will (i) apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list, (ii) ensure that investments \n40. \nusing  ADB  funds  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  and  (iii)  abide  by \napplicable  national  laws  and  regulations.  HTL  human  resource  management  policies  and \nprocedures  ensure  it  operates  in  accordance  with  national  labor  laws  and  internationally \nrecognized  core  labor  standards,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy  (2001).  HTL\u2019s \nstakeholder  management  system  contains  requirements  for  information  disclosure  and \nconsultation  with  affected  people  following  national  requirements  that  conform  with  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements for the loan. HTL will report regularly to ADB on (i) its compliance with such laws \nand (ii) the measures taken.18 \n \nB. \n \nHTL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \n41. \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nD. \n \nConsistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),19 \n43. \nADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon  establishing  that  the  Government  of  the \nPRC  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed  assistance  to  HTL.
