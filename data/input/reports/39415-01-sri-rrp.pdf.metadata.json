The share of thermal energy in the generation mix \nhas increased from 6% in 1995 to 61% in 2010 as demand growth has been generally  met by \noil-fired thermal generation. This type of power generation makes electricity expensive because \nof  high  fuel  prices,  and  poses  a  serious  threat  to  the  country\u2019s  energy  security  and  the \nenvironment. The transmission system is too weak to meet the growing demand in the regions. \nSubstantial  investments  are  required  to  strengthen  the  transmission  network  and  improve  its \nreliability.  About  15%  of  households\u2014primarily  those  in  rural  areas\u2014do  not  have  access  to \nelectricity  despite  the  government\u2019s  intensive  investment  program  to  expand  the  rural \ndistribution network. The electrification ratio of 67.3% in Eastern Province4 is the lowest among \nall of Sri Lanka\u2019s provinces and is well below the average national electrification ratio of 85.4% \nin 2009.5 Uva Province is another lagging region with an electrification ratio of 70% as of 2009. \nThere  is  an  urgent  need  to  develop  clean  energy  and  indigenous  renewable  energy  sources, \nreduce losses, and improve energy efficiency. \n \n4. \nThe  project  will  support  Sri  Lanka's  national  and  sector  priorities  as  stated  in  the \ncountry's  10-year  development  framework  prepared  in  2006,  which  focuses  on  infrastructure \ndevelopment to accelerate economic growth and narrow regional disparities. The project is also \nin  line  with  the  National  Energy  Policy  and  Strategies  (NEPS),  a  10-year  plan  for  the  energy \nsector, covering a period up to 2016. The NEPS envisions sustainable development of energy \nresources,  conversion  facilities,  and  delivery  systems  to  enable  access  to  and  use  of  energy \nservices by the entire population, as well as the safe, reliable delivery of such energy services at \na competitive price. The NEPS provides a comprehensive sector road map and includes a long-\nterm  investment  program  with  specific  policy  and  reform  measures.  It  aims  to  (i)  supply \nelectricity to 86% of households by 2010 and 98% by 2016, and (ii) ensure electricity tariffs are \n\n                                                \n1   Established by the Government of Japan. \n2  ADB.  2009.

Manila  (project  preparatory  TA  7363-SRI,  for  $800,000,  approved  on  13  October  and \nfinanced on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund). \n3   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n4  The  electrification  ratio  in  Ampara  district  of  Eastern  Province,  where  most  of  project's  rural  electrification \n\ninterventions are expected to be undertaken, is 64%. \n\n5   Ceylon Electricity Board. 2010. Statistical Digest. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ncompetitive  with  those  in  other  countries  and  sufficient  for  utilities  to  be  viable.  The \ngovernment\u2019s main goals are to improve the quantity, quality, and cost of service delivery, and \nto increase electricity connections in rural areas. \n \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country  partnership \n5. \nstrategy  for  Sri  Lanka, 6 which  focuses  on  (i)  funding  transmission  projects  to  remove  grid \nconstraints  on  absorbing  additional  capacity  from  renewable  energy  sources,  (ii)  improving \nenergy  efficiency  and  reliability  by  strengthening  the  transmission  network,  (iii)  expanding \naccess to electricity by improving connectivity for the poor, and (iv) mitigating climate change by \nfinancing  clean  energy  projects  and  supporting  energy  efficiency  initiatives.  The  project  will \nsupport  the  sustainable  development  of  the  power  sector  in  line  with  national  and  sector \npriorities, \nthe  country  partnership  strategy,  and  complement  activities  of  other  major \ndevelopment partners.7 The project will expand ADB interventions in the power sector initiated \nunder  the  Clean  Energy  and  Access  Improvement  Project,8 which  was  designed  to  support \nsector reforms following approval of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act in March 2009.9 The project will \naddress  the  post-conflict  electricity  needs  of  the  population  and  improve  infrastructure  in \nEastern  Province  that  was  severely  damaged  by  the  conflict,  and  directly  contribute  to  the \ndevelopment  of  this  poor  province. 10  The  project  will  strengthen  the  220-kilovolt  (kV) \ntransmission  line  that  is  vital  to  the  overall  reliability  of  the  transmission  system  and  the \nevacuation  of  power  from  renewable  hydropower  sources\u2014primarily  located  in  Central \nProvince\u2014to  the  conflict-affected  northern  part  of  the  country  through  North  Central  Province. \nTo ensure regional balance, the project is also designed to benefit other poor provinces. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n6. \nThe  project  will  contribute  to  a  reliable,  adequate,  and  affordable  power  supply  for \nsustainable economic growth and poverty reduction in Sri Lanka. The outcome of the project will \nbe improved coverage, efficiency, and reliability in the delivery of electricity.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe outputs of the proposed project will include the following:11  \n\n7. \n \n\n(i) \n\nTransmission system strengthening: \n(a)  New  Galle  power  transmission  development.

Separate \nPIUs  will  be  established  in  CEB  for  transmission  strengthening,  rural  electrification  and \ndistribution system improvement, and detailed engineering for the Moragolla hydropower plant. \nFull-time project managers with qualified staff will be appointed to supervise subprojects under \n\n                                                \n20   Financing charges relating to onlending to the Ceylon Electricity Board will be financed by the government. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\neach  component.  The  PIUs  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project  implementation,  including \nprocurement, accounting, quality assurance, social and environmental issues, and coordination \nwith  government  agencies.  The  PIUs  will  also  coordinate  closely  with  the  procurement \ncommittee,  which  will  be  appointed  by  the  cabinet  or  MOPE  depending  on  the  size  of  the \ncontracts. SEA's PIU will be supported by project implementation consultants. \n \n16. \nThe  government  has  asked  ADB  to  approve  advance  contracting  and  retroactive \nfinancing for procurement of goods and civil works, including preparation of bidding documents, \nand  inviting  and  receiving  bids  for  project  contracts.  The  government  has  been  advised  that \nADB's approval of advance contracting does not commit ADB to finance any part of this project. \n \n17. \nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual.21 Project implementation will be completed by 30 April 2014, \nand loan closing will be 30 October 2014. \n\n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n\nAspects \n\nImplementation period \nEstimated project completion date \nProject management \n(i)   Oversight body \n\n3 years \n30 April 2014 \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)   Key implementing agencies \n(iv)  Project implementation units \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nRetroactive  financing  and/or  advance \ncontracting \n\nDisbursement  \n\nSteering committee consisting the secretary, Ministry of Power and Energy \n(chair),  and  representatives  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Planning, \nMinistry  of  Power  and  Energy,  Public  Utilities  Commission,  Ceylon \nElectricity Board, and Sustainable Energy Authority (members) \nMinistry of Power and Energy \nCeylon Electricity Board and Sustainable Energy Authority \nPlaced in Ceylon Electricity Board and Sustainable Energy Authority \nInternational \ncompetitive bidding \nNational competitive \nbidding \nQuality- and cost-\nbased selection \nFixed-budget selection \n\n323 person-months \n\n  5 contractsa \n\n  $0.06 million \n\n$90.62 million \n\n  $4.01 million \n\n  $6.00 million \n\n12 contracts \n\nIndividual \n\n  $0.07 million \n\n12 person-months \n(national) \n14 person-months \n(national) \n\nAdvance  contracting,  including  preparation  of  bidding  documents,  inviting \nand  receiving  bids  for  contracts,  and  retroactive  financing  covering \nreimbursement of  eligible  expenditure incurred  under  the  project  no  earlier \nthan 12 months before the date of signing of the loan agreement, subject to \na maximum amount equivalent to 20% of the aggregate amount of the loans \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank's  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom  time  to  time)  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  between  the \ngovernment and Asian Development Bank. \n\na Includes four contracts for concrete poles that are normally manufactured and supplied locally. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n18. \nThe  project  will  be  supported  by  TA  for  Implementation  of  Energy  Efficiency  Policy \nInitiatives.  SEA  will  be  the  implementing  agency.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $2.24  million, \n\n                                                \n21 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fincluding $1.85 million in grant financing from the Asian Clean Energy Fund22 under the Clean \nEnergy  Financing  Partnership  Facility  administered  by  ADB,  and  $0.39  million  from  the \ngovernment. Details are in the TA description (footnote 17). \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \nEconomic  and  financial  analyses  were  undertaken  for  the  project. 23  The  economic \n19. \ninternal  rate  of  return  was  calculated  by  comparing  \u2015with-project\u2016  and  \u2015without-project\u2016 \nscenarios.  Detailed  cost\u2013benefit  calculations  were  used  to  assess  and  confirm  economic \nviability  and  sustainability.  The  economic  analysis  confirms  that  the  proposed  investment  is \nleast  cost  and  economically  viable.  The  analysis  yields  an  overall  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn  of  23.0%.  A  sensitivity  and  risk  analysis  demonstrates  that  the  expected  economic \nperformance is robust.  \n \nThe  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  was  calculated  to  determine  the  financial \n20. \nviability of the project. Financial viability was examined by comparing the incremental costs and \nbenefits  on  a  \u2015with  investment\u2016  and  \u2015without  investment\u2016  basis.  The  weighted  average  cost  of \ncapital (WACC) to CEB was calculated for each subproject and for the overall project. Financial \nviability  was  assessed  by  comparing  the  WACC  to  the  FIRR  for  each  subproject  and  for  the \naggregated  project.  The  sensitivity  of  the  FIRR  to  adverse  movements  in  the  underlying \nassumptions  was  also  assessed.  The  overall  FIRR  to  CEB  is  10.8%.  These  returns  compare \nfavorably with the estimated WACC. The overall project is deemed financially viable. \n \nB. \n \n21.  With  its  substantial  experience  in  implementing  externally  funded  projects  including \nthose financed by ADB, the World Bank, Japan International Cooperation Agency, and bilateral \ndevelopment  partners,  CEB  has  the  necessary  capacity  to  handle  the  project.  CEB  is  the \nimplementing  agency  for  ADB's  Clean  Energy  and  Access  Improvement  Project  (footnote  8), \nand  is  implementing  a  power  sector  component  of  the  ADB\u2019s  Conflict-Affected  Region \nEmergency  Project  (footnote  10).  A  financial  management  assessment  was  undertaken  to \ndetermine  whether  CEB  could  fulfill  ADB\u2019s  fiduciary  requirements  for  the  project.  Details  are \navailable  in  the  project  administration  manual  (footnote  21)  and  in  the  assessment  of  CEB\u2019s \npast financial performance and projections.24 \n \n22. \nIn recent  years,  SEA  has  received  considerable capacity  development  assistance from \nits development partners, including ADB25 and the Japan International Cooperation Agency, and \nwill  be  undertaking  technical  due  diligence  of  applications  for  the  estate  micro-hydro \nrehabilitation  and  repowering  sub-component,  and  limited  procurement  activities  for  energy \nefficiency lighting equipment.  \n \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n22  Established by the Government of Japan. \n23  Economic Analysis and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24  CEB\u2019s Past Financial Performance and Projections (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25  ADB. 2007.

Manila (TA 7011-SRI, approved on 12 December, for $600,000 with financing from \nthe Multi-Donor Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility administered by ADB. \nContributors to the fund are the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, and Sweden). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nProcurement will be subject to ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from \n23. \ntime  to  time).  Recruitment  of  consultants  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the \nUse  of  Consultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Use  of  open  competitive  bidding, \ntransparency in the selection of projects, and ADB oversight will ensure integrity in procurement \nand implementation activities. CEB and SEA will maintain a project website that will be updated \nregularly  and  will  include  (i)  bidding  procedures,  bidders,  and  contract  awards;  (ii)  use  of  the \nfunds disbursed under the project; and (iii) physical progress. ADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas amended to  date)  was  explained  to and  discussed  with  the government,  MOPE,  CEB,  and \nSEA.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the \nproject administration manual (footnote 21). \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nC. \n \n24. \nThe project will contribute to sustainable economic development, poverty reduction, and \nsocial  well-being 26 through  increased  access  to  electricity,  reduction  of  system  losses,  and \nimprovement in the quality of power. Greater access to a stable supply of electricity will promote \nbusiness expansion and increase jobs, which will help reduce poverty. The project is expected \nto generate jobs for skilled and unskilled laborers during construction. Access to electricity will \nalso  improve  the  living  standards  of  rural  households.  These  will  include  health  and  hygiene \nimprovements through the replacement of kerosene and wood use, increases in the educational \nlevel of children as they can devote more time to studying, and wider access to information.  \n \nThe project is classified under effective gender mainstreaming.27 It includes activities to \n25. \nimprove the livelihoods of local communities, especially for women. Where households headed \nby  women  are  affected,  the  project  will  implement  special  livelihood  restoration  provisions  to \nensure that their vulnerability is adequately addressed.28 Affordability is not likely to be an issue \nas  the  government  generally  subsidizes  electricity,  especially  for  poor  and  disadvantaged \ncustomers. Poor households will be provided with a credit line (footnote 12).  \n \nD. \n \n \n \n26. \nNone of the  project  components  will  have a  significant  social  impact.  The transmission \nand  distribution  lines  primarily  cross  public  and  unused  lands.  Where  crop  fields  might  be \naffected,  households  will  be  fairly  compensated  for  the  loss.  Construction  will  be  carried  out \nduring the off-season for crops. New grid substations will be built on public land, and the project \nmay mount the distribution transformers on poles to minimize their footprint.  \n \n27. \nThe project is classified category B for involuntary resettlement issues. CEB prepared a \nresettlement  plan  for  the  transmission  strengthening  and  rural  electrification  and  distribution \nimprovement  components  (footnote  28).  The  project  is  classified  category  C  for  indigenous \npeoples issues since no indigenous peoples will be directly affected by the project. \n \n\nSocial Safeguards \n\nSafeguards \n\n1. \n\n \n\n                                                \n26   Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27   Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The Improving Gender-inclusive \nAccess  to  Clean  and  Renewable  Energy  in  Bhutan,  Nepal,  and  Sri  Lanka  is  being  processed  separately  for \napproval. \n\n28  Provisions are in the Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f2. \n\nEnvironmental Safeguards \n\n \n \nCEB  and  SEA  have  prepared  initial  environmental  examinations29 for their  components \n28. \nand held public consultation meetings. During construction and operation, steps will be taken to \nminimize  environmental  impacts,  particularly  those  associated  with  the  construction  of \ntransmission lines. CEB has observed the route-selection criteria in the national regulations and \nhas  adopted  best  environmental  practices.  Adequate  provisions  have  been  made  for  the \nenvironmental mitigation measures, monitoring requirements, and their associated costs in the \nenvironmental  management  plans  (EMPs)  prepared  for  each  subproject.  CEB  has  sufficient \ncapacity  to  implement  the  safeguard  measures  based  on  the  EMPs.  Mitigation  measures \nrelated to construction and specified in the EMPs will be incorporated into civil works contracts. \nThe contractors will have primary responsibility for implementing the mitigation measures during \nconstruction,  but  CEB  will  be  responsible  for  overall  implementation  of  its  site-specific  EMPs. \nSEA will be responsible for overall implementation of its site-specific EMPs for the estate micro-\nhydro  rehabilitation  and  repowering  pilot  sub-component.  SEA  will  be  supported  by  safeguard \nconsultants. CEB and SEA will adhere to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), and local \nand government environmental regulations. The project is classified environmental category B. \n \n\n3. \n\nClimate Change Impact \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n \nThe  project  is  expected  to  have  a  considerable  climate  change  impact.  Its  renewable \n29. \nenergy  intervention  will  bring  an  additional  1.3  MW  of  power  generation  to  the  grid,  which  is \nequivalent  to  avoiding  about  4,140  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  emissions  per  year. 30 The \nenergy efficiency policy initiatives supported by the project and the associated TA are expected \nto  produce  about  480  gigawatt-hours  of  energy  savings,  resulting  in  353,787  tons  of  CO2 \nemissions equivalent avoided per year by 2015. A reduction of 147,745 tons of CO2 emissions \nper  year  may  be  achieved  through  additional  household  connections  and  technical  loss \nreduction from the improved energy efficiency of the transmission and distribution lines by 2015. \n \nE. \n \n30. \nThe  potential  governance  risk  stems  from  CEB  having  insufficient  cash  to  fund  its \noperations  because  of  (i)  an  increase  in  fuel  oil  costs  and  reliance  on  expensive  thermal \nelectricity generation, (ii) delays in commissioning less costly generating capacity, and (iii) tariffs \nset  below  the  cost  of  supply.  The  potential risks  to  project  implementation  include unexpected \nincreases  in  the  prices  of  commodities  and  raw  materials,  and  delays  in  implementation  that \nraise  project  costs.  These  risks  appear  to  be  moderate  and  may  be  mitigated  through  (i) \nprogress  on  power  sector  reforms,  and  government  efforts  to  increase  supply  capacity  and \nreduce  the  cost  of  generation;  and  (ii)  close  supervision  by  the  steering  committee  and  ADB, \ntimely  project  implementation,  and  advance  contracting.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures \nare described in the risk assessment and risk management plan.31 \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nThe  government  and  MOPE  have  assured  ADB  that  project  implementation  shall \n31. \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \n\n                                                \n29   Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30  In  addition,  a  reduction  of  97,200  tons  of  CO2  emissions  per  year  may  be  achieved  from  commissioning  the \nMoragolla hydropower plant (about 30 MW) upon completion of a detailed engineering design and its construction. \n\n31 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nin  the  project  administration  manual  and  draft  loan  documents.
