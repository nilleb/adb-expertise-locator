The  Government  of  Pakistan  will \nprovide  an  assurance  that  any  subproject  will  be  prepared  in \naccordance with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Environment \nPolicy.  \n   \nProject Description  The  TA  loan  provides  a  key  intervention  of  the  long-term \npartnership between ADB and Pakistan for the development of \nKarachi.  It  responds  to  the  need  for  a  long-term  and  holistic \napproach to the development of Karachi whose large-scale needs \nfor infrastructure and reforms cannot be met by the traditional \napproach of a one-off project. The TA loan supports a series of \ncomplementary interventions whose cumulative effect will produce \nthe synergy to speed up the development process of the mega \ncity  on  a  sustainable  basis.  These  interventions  involve \ncomprehensive capacity building of city district government, town \nmunicipal administrations (TMAs), and other city agencies in city \nplanning,  management,  and  adoption  and  implementation  of \ncommercial principles in providing infrastructure and services. The \nTA loan interventions also include support for preparing bankable \nprojects for the mega city infrastructure and services development \nin  an  efficient  and  integrated  manner.  Moreover,  the  TA  loan \ninvolves interventions for sustainable financing of the mega city \ninfrastructure through introducing an innovative financing vehicle.  \n   \nRationale  The  economy  and  population  of  Karachi  have  expanded \nsignificantly, but few investments have been made in the city\u2019s \nurban  infrastructure  for  over  two  decades.  Infrastructure  and \nservices  that  are  inadequate  and  unreliable  are  adding  to \nbusiness  and  household  costs,  harming  Karachi\u2019s  urban  and \nnatural  environments,  and  decreasing  the  city\u2019s  global \ncompetitiveness  compared  with  alternative  Asian  mega  cities. \nThe  Government\u2019s  recent  devolution  policy  provides  major \nbenefits  to  be  realized,  but  it  has  left  many  issues  to  be \naddressed in such areas as (i) fiscal imbalance and unclear and \nincomplete  allocation  of  responsibilities  between  levels  of \n ", "ii   \ngovernment, and (ii) inadequacy of the city\u2019s and towns\u2019 financial \nand technical capacities to fully meet their new responsibilities \nwithin the devolved framework. There is a need for substantial \nand long-term capacity building at the city and town levels if \ndevolution  is  to  yield  the  intended  benefits  for  more  effective \nurban service delivery. There is also increasing recognition that \nthe  growing  gap  between  urban  infrastructure  demand  and \ncurrent  supply  cannot  be  met  through  traditional  government \nsources,  including  local  government  revenues,  subsidies,  and \ntransfers  from  the  higher  levels  of  government.  Alternative \nsources of financing and new ways of providing infrastructure and \nservices are required.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The expected impact of the TA loan is an enhanced and sustained \ncontribution of Karachi to national development and a sustainable \nimprovement in the quality of life for the city residents, including \nthe poor. The expected outcomes are (i) improved city planning, \nmanagement, and financing; (ii) improved and expanded urban \ninfrastructure  and  services;  and  (iii)  sustainable  and  efficient \nfinancing of urban infrastructure. To these ends, the TA loan will \nprovide resources for (i) building the capacities of the City District \nGovernment  of  Karachi  (CDGK),  TMAs,  and  utilities  in  city \nplanning,  management,  and  financing,  as  well  as  in  applying \ncommercial  principles  in  the  provision  of  infrastructure  and \nservices;  (ii)  assisting  to  prepare  bankable  projects  that  may \nsubsequently  be  funded  by  ADB  in  its  lending  assistance  to \nKarachi  over  the  next  4  years;  and  (iii)  establishing  and \noperationalizing  an  innovative  financing  vehicle  for  mega  city \ninfrastructure investments which will act as (a) an efficient conduit \nfor channeling ADB and other funds to the city, (b) a catalyst for \nreforming the city agencies, and (c) an agent to mobilize funds \nfrom nongovernment sources for large-scale capital investment \nneeds.  It  is  expected  that  the  TA  loan  will  also  enhance  the \nGovernment\u2019s  ownership  of  the  investment  projects,  capacity \nbuilding, and institutional reforms.  \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $13.330  million \nequivalent, comprising a foreign exchange component of $6.460 \nmillion (48% of the total cost) and a local currency component of \n$6.870 million equivalent (52% of the total cost).  \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total  % \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nAsian Development Bank  6.46  3.54  10.00   75 \nGovernment   0.0  3.33   3.33   25 \n  Total  6.46  6.87  13.33   100 \n \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $10.0 million equivalent in special drawing rights (SDR) \nand various currencies from ADB's Special Funds resources will \nbe provided. The loan will have a 32-year term including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, and with an interest rate of 1.0% per annum ", "  iii\nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 July 2010 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 January  2010 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Finance Department of the Government of Sindh (GOS) will \nbe the Executing Agency. \n   \nImplementation  A project support unit (PSU) will be established in the Finance \nArrangements  Department  of  Sindh.  It  will  be  headed  by  a  full-time  Project \nDirector and staffed with suitably qualified personnel. The PSU \nwill  oversee  the  overall  project  and  be  responsible  for \nimplementing part C (specialized financing vehicle). \n \nA project steering committee (PSC), chaired by the Government \nof Sindh\u2019s Minister, Finance, will be formed. It will include the \nMinister  of  Planning  and  Development,  the  Minister  of  Local \nGovernment,  Nazim  (city  mayor),  CDGK,  Additional  Chief \nSecretary  (Development),  Planning  and  Development,  Sindh, \nSecretary Finance, Secretary Local Government, Sindh, District \nCoordination Officer of CDGK, and the Project Director, PSU and \ntwo representatives from NGOs/academia. Project Director PSU \nwill act also as the secretary of the PSC. The PSC will provide \npolicy  support,  oversee  project  progress,  facilitate  cooperation \namong agencies concerned, and ensure the timely undertaking of \nreform  actions  to  establish  and  operationalize  the  specialized \nfinancing vehicle and to implement organizational development, \nrevenue  mobilization  and  financial  management,  and  other \nreforms  at  CDGK  and  the  TMAs.  The  committee  will  meet \nquarterly or upon request by any of its members.  \n \nCDGK  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  for  part  A  (Capacity \nBuilding  Facility)  and  part  B  (Project  Preparation  Facility).  A \nproject working group (PWG), chaired by the district coordination \nofficer,  will  be  formed  to  provide  oversight  for  all  operational \nmatters and coordinate with part C. The PWG will meet bimonthly \nand have specific responsibility for approving the prioritization of \nsubprojects,  final  terms  of  reference  (TORs),  and  consultant \nselection  for  subprojects  under  parts  A  and  B  prior  to  their \nsubmission to the PSU for onward transmittal to ADB. \n  \nA  local  support  unit  (LSU)  will  be  established  in  CDGK  (the \nDepartment  of  Finance  and  Planning)  to  plan,  implement \norganizational development, and coordinate those activities and \nindividual  programs  of  parts  A  and  B  which  will  mainly  be \nimplemented by the individual subproject units in respective sector \ndepartments of CDGK.  \n   \nProcurement  All  goods  and  services  under  the  Project  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n   \n ", "iv   \nConsulting Services  International  and/or  domestic  consulting  firms  will  be  recruited \nusing ADB\u2019s quality and cost-based selection and quality-based \nselection procedures as appropriate for each subproject. Certain \nsubprojects  will  utilize  quality-based  selection,  as  these  require \nexpertise  of  limited  availability.  Consulting  firms  and  individual \nconsultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to \nADB for engaging domestic consultants. \n \nSpecialists in urban planning, water supply, sewerage, solid waste \nmanagement, urban transport and roads, low income community \nupgrading,  private  sector  participation  in  urban  infrastructure \nprovision, economics,  finance, social development,  resettlement, \nand  the  environment  will  help  CDGK  carry  out  comprehensive \nfeasibility  analyses  and,  where  necessary,  engineering  designs, \npreparation  of  bid  documents,  and  procurement  of  goods  and \nservices  in  a  manner  satisfactory  to  ADB.  Specialists  in  urban \ngovernance,  urban/municipal  finance,  institutional  development, \nand corporate governance will also be recruited to help design and \nimplement programs under the capacity building facility. \n \nTentative estimates of the consulting services requirements for the \nwhole  TA  loan  are  about  145  and  430  person-months  of \ninternational and domestic consultants, respectively. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The mega city\u2019s population will realize sustainable benefits from \nBeneficiaries  improved  governance  and  CDGK\u2019s  enhanced  capacities  for \neffective  city  planning,  management,  and  provision  of \ninfrastructure  and  services.  This  will  be  achieved  through  (i) \norganizational  development  of  CDGK  within  the  devolved \nstructure; (ii) managerial and technical capacity improvements; (iii) \nimproved financial planning, budgeting, and reporting, as well as \nenhanced  local  revenues;  (iv)  customer  orientation  and \ncommercialization reforms within CDGK, utilities, and TMAs; and \n(v) enhanced public, private, and community partnership in urban \nservice provision.  \n \nThe TA loan through the project preparation facility will support \nKarachi\u2019s economic development and poverty reduction by means \nof  efficient  and  timely  provision  of  funds  and  assistance  for \npreparing  bankable  subprojects.  The  subprojects  will  address \nhigh-priority  infrastructure  needs  and  the  needs  of  poor \nsettlements that make up a substantial portion of the city. The \nimmediate beneficiary will be the CDGK, whose gains will include \nimproved  governance  and  transparency  in  consultant  selection \nand procurement and enhanced project preparation capacities.  \n \nThe TA loan will ensure sustainable development of the mega city \nby helping to establish and operationalize a viable, specialized \nmega city financing vehicle which will (i) act as an efficient conduit \nto channel funds to mega city infrastructure development, (ii) be \nan  important  catalyst  and  promoter  in  accelerating \ncommercialization of urban infrastructure and services, and (iii) in ", "  v\nthe  medium-to-long  term,  mobilize  funds  from  alternative \nnongovernment  sources.  The  ultimate  beneficiaries  will  be  the \nresidents  and  businesses  of  not  only  the  Karachi  city  but  the \ncountry as a whole, since Karachi\u2019s contribution to the economy \ngoes beyond the city and province. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Major potential risks include those related to (i) possible delays in \nproject implementation due to inadequate capacities of CDGK, \n(ii) possible delays in government reform actions to implement the \nproposed improvements under the capacity building component,  \nand  (iii)  a  possible  lack  of  cooperation  from  civil  society  and \nnongovernment organizations.  \n \nTo  mitigate  the  possible  delays  in  project  implementation,  the \nProject provides support for TA loan management whereby a core \nteam of experts/advisors is to be engaged at the Project\u2019s outset \nto assist the PSU, PWG, and LSU in reviewing and revising the \nscope of components, prioritizing subprojects, finalizing the TORs, \nrecruiting consultants and evaluating the consultant outputs.   \n \nThe  risk  of  delay  in  government  actions  to  implement  the \nproposed  reforms  for  organizational  development,  tariffs,  local \nrevenues, financial management, corporatization, and customer \norientation  will  be  mitigated  by  close  ADB  supervision  of \nimplementation.  ADB  will  be  actively  engaged  throughout  the \nprogress of the capacity building subprograms, and especially in \nthose  having  policy  and  sector  reform  implications.  Each \nsubprogram will identify the time-bound actions to be taken by the \nGovernment at the early stages of its implementation and which \nwill form the content of the policy dialogue with CDGK, GOS and \nADB. In addition, the PSC will use its considerable political and \nadministrative clout to facilitate timely implementation of reform \nactions.  \n \nFinally, the additional risk that may emerge due to possible lack of \ncooperation from civil society will be addressed through involving \nthe  representatives  of  the  nongovernment  organizations  in  the \nPSC, and ensuring the participation of the civil society, business \ncommunity, and the urban poor in developing and implementing \nthe subprojects.  \n   \n \n ",

THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) loan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Mega City Development \nProject. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES   \n \nA.  Introduction  \n \n2.  In its midterm development framework, the Government of Pakistan (Government) made \na commitment to enhance the competitiveness of and quality of life in its large cities. The \nGovernment constituted a high-level committee led by the Planning Commission for coordinated \ndevelopment of its mega cities, starting with Karachi as a central plank in its long-term economic \ndevelopment strategy. In this context, the Government requested Asian Development Bank's \n(ADB) assistance to address the mega city challenges facing Pakistan. Given the immense size \nof Karachi, the magnitude of its investment requirements, and the scale of interventions for urban \npolicy reforms, both ADB and the Government recognized that the needs of Karachi cannot be \naddressed  by  a  one-off  approach,  but,  rather  require  a  series  of  appropriately  sequenced \ninterventions. Accordingly, ADB\u2019s country strategy and program update (CSPU) for 2005\u20132006 \nincluded a TA loan1 in 2005, as the first intervention of the long-term mega city assistance \nprogram to enable the Government to undertake preparation of priority projects, critically needed \nurban institutional and financial reforms, and comprehensive capacity building.  \n \nB.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n3.  Economy. Karachi, the capital of Sindh province, is the commercial hub and gateway of \nPakistan. It accounts for 95% of Pakistan\u2019s foreign trade and contributes 30% of Pakistan\u2019s \nindustrial production. Nearly 90% of the country\u2019s head offices of banks, financial institutions and \nmultinational companies are located in Karachi. The country\u2019s largest stock exchange is Karachi-\nbased. The city contributes 20% of the national gross domestic product, accounts for 40% of \nnational employment in large-scale manufacturing, and contributes 25% of national and 40% of \nprovincial revenues.  \n \n4.  Demography. According to the 1998 census, Karachi had a population of 9.2 million in \n1998, which compares with 5.2 million in 1981. Based upon the intercensal (1981\u20131998) annual \ngrowth rate of 4.5%, the current population of Karachi is estimated at 12.5 million and the \npopulation is projected to reach 20.7 million in 2015. The city is made up of 18 contiguous towns.  \n \n5.  Mega City Development Trends. The geographical location and economic potential of \nKarachi have drawn both labor and capital for many decades, but the city has never been in a \nposition to maximize this potential to benefit the city. Little investment into the city\u2019s infrastructure \nhas been made over the past two decades. Neither new investments nor new additions to the \nlabor force have been optimally located in the city, resulting in haphazard development, a polluted \nurban environment, and, for many households, a poor quality of life.  \n \n6.  Poverty. Based on the 2001 poverty line2 and the fiscal year 2001\u20132002 income levels3 \nfor Karachi, 50% of the city\u2019s total population is poor. The pattern of household income shows \n                                                 \n1  TA PAK-4578 (ADB. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Mega City Development \nProject. Manila. ) supported preparation of the TA loan. It was approved in April 2005 in the amount of $150,000.  \n2\n The poverty line adopted by the Government is based on a caloric norm of 2,350 calories per adult per day and \nminimum  nonfood  requirements.  This  poverty  line  approximates  PRs748.6  per  month  per  adult  in  FY  2001 \n(Government of Pakistan. 2003. Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. Islamabad.)  \n3\n The income level calculations are based on (i) figures for monthly income range and percentage of households in the \nHousehold Income and Expenditure Survey, 2001\u20132002 and (ii) Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (see footnote 2).  \n ", "2   \nthat around 9.5% of the households are living in extreme and chronic poverty while another 14% \nare transitory poor. The incidence of poverty varies in the 18 towns and the cantonment areas in \nthe city. The highest incidence is in katchi abadis, which are informally developed and poor \nsettlements. It is estimated that 89% of the population of katchi abadis lives below the poverty \nline.  \n \n7.  Urban Environment. Karachi both faces and causes significant environmental issues and \npressures. Outside the mega city, the major environmental resources adversely affected by \nactivities in the city are the coastline and the near-shore marine habitat. More than 900,000 cubic \nmeters (some 200 million gallons) per day of untreated domestic and industrial wastewater and \nover 1,000 tons per day of uncollected solid waste finds its way directly or indirectly to the sea, \nproviding  a  constant  source  of  marine  pollution.  Karachi\u2019s  industries  generate  a  cocktail  of \nchemicals and toxic substances, and a significant amount of industrial effluent is discharged into \ncreeks, rivers, or the sea. New development takes place within environmentally sensitive areas \nand reserves for critical infrastructure, causing major environmental problems. Vehicle-generated \nair pollution is severe, with high concentrations of suspended particulate matter in the air causing \nrespiratory problems among a large number of mega city residents.  \n \nC.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Inadequate Mega City Management: Need for Capacity Building  \n \n8.  Mega City Governance in Transition. The weak city governance and management \nsystems lead to poor performance in planning and provision of infrastructure and services in the \nmega city. The devolution reforms of 2001 have ushered in a need for major restructuring of the \nlocal  government  through  transfer  of  political  and  administrative  power  to  the  elected  local \nauthorities.  The  City  District  Government  of  Karachi  (CDGK)  became  the  central  player  in \nmanaging the city\u2019s affairs while the town municipal administrations (TMAs) of 18 towns were \ntasked with core municipal functions, including town planning and provision of infrastructure and \nservices for water, sanitation, roads, streetlights, etc. Although the devolution has provided a \ngood  opportunity  for  effective  service  provision,  it  has  led  to  continuing  overlaps  and \nfragmentation. Various agencies at provincial level remain responsible for service provision that is \nnow the responsibility of CDGK and TMAs. The post-devolution institutional structure of CDGK is \nprimarily an outcome of joining past provincial offices and their employees into CDGK, rather than \nany major reorganization needed to undertake the management of a mega city along modern \nlines (see the organization of CDGK in Appendix 2).  \n \n9.  In the devolution process, the capacity of some technically well-endowed agencies, such \nas  the  Karachi  Development  Authority,  was  lost  without  providing  an  alternative  devolved \nstructure for them. The restructuring of such major service providers as Karachi Water and \nSewerage Board (KWSB) and coordination with the TMAs remain to be addressed. Personnel \nadministration within the devolved setup continues to be an issue. While the provincial staff were \nphysically transferred to CDGK, they remain administratively under the Government of Sindh \n(GOS),  limiting  the  power  of  CDGK  on  personnel  matters  and  undermining  employee  and \nmanagement accountability. The organization is overstaffed, with a concentration of low-grade \nemployees. A large majority of the staff does not have the qualifications and skills required to \ndischarge the new responsibilities and facilitate evolution of an accountable work ethic in CDGK.  \n \n10.  There is a need to introduce appropriate institutional structures, business practices, and \nimproved capacities if the devolution is to yield the intended benefits with regard to improved \ngovernance and effective service delivery. This would require (i) evolution of new regulatory \nrelationships between GOS, CDGK, and the TMAs, with GOS and CDGK assuming greater roles \nfor regulation and oversight; (ii) clarity of functional responsibilities between GOS and CDGK, as \nwell as within CDGK; (iii) organizational development of CDGK and the TMAs; (iv) introducing \ncustomer  orientation  and  commercialization  in  CDGK  and  utilites;  and  (v)  human  resource ", "  3\nmanagement that combines rationalization strategies, training, and personnel management for a \nproductive workforce in CDGK and TMAs. These improvements form the priority subprograms of \ncapacity building assistance in the Project.  \n  \n11.  Lack of Planned Approach to Development. Inadequate planning systems resulted in \nhaphazard growth of the mega city. The current planning system has not articulated into plans the \nstrategic directions and visions for the city\u2019s economic development. The planning system is \nneither linked to prioritized action plans nor to financial strategies needed to realize them. The \nrecent  master  plan,  prepared  for  the  period  up  to  2000,  was  not  adopted  due  to  lack  of \ninstitutional clarity for approving and implementing plans. Master planning has been constrained \nby (i) a lack of strategic guidance, (ii) institutional uncertainty, (iii) land management issues of the \nmega  city,  and  (iv)  ineffective  building  control  and  enforcement.  The  situation  has  been \naggravated by the fact that nearly 90% of city land is under the ownership of various public \ninstitutions, each of which has authority over land use and planning with regard to its own land.  \n \n12.  Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) has recently supported a study4 for the \n\u201crevitalization of Karachi.\u201d A vision for Karachi was established as a \u201ccosmopolitan gateway city\u201d \nof international business and tourism. This vision would be achieved through (i) social upgrading, \ninvolving tourism and business infrastructure and amenities, welfare services, skills upgrading, \nand  citizen  mobilization;  and  (ii)  urban  and  industrial  development  through  infrastructure \ndevelopment,  possible  renovation  of  Karachi\u2019s  circular  railway,  and  improving  the  urban \nenvironment. There remains a need, however, to translate this vision into concrete plans and \nprograms. CDGK recently embarked on preparing an updated mega city master plan. Building on \nthe work done by JBIC, the proposed TA loan will support CDGK in its endeavor for mega city \nplanning.  The  planning  assistance  is  also  aimed  to  be  instrumental  in  developing  and \ninstitutionalizing a planning system that (i) integrates economic, social, environmental and spatial \nplanning; (ii) is linked to financing strategies for implementing the plans; (iii) is based on clear \ninstitutional roles to approve and implement the plans; and (iv) is supplemented by effective \ndevelopment and building control systems.  \n \n13.  Limited Revenue Base. The available funds of CDGK and the TMAs are not sufficient to \noffer the level of infrastructure services needed to support a reasonable quality of life in Karachi. \nUnder the devolution, expenditure obligations of CDGK and the TMAs have been substantially \nextended. It is commonly perceived, however, that devolution assigned weak fiscal revenue \nbases. There remain deficiencies in the transfer system among levels of government, such as a \nlack of incentives for increasing local revenue performance at the city level. The existing local \nrevenue base\u2014which primarily consists of local taxation in the forms of property taxes, land \nrevenue, and entertainment tax, as well as service charges especially for water, sewerage, and \nsolid waste collection\u2014is further reduced by  weak capacities to levy and collect taxes and \ncharges and inadequate tariff structures and rates. It is estimated that CDGK\u2019s own-source \nrevenues constitute only 49% of total revenues while those of the TMAs range from 36% to 56%.  \n   \n14.  There is a need to expand the resources available to CDGK and the TMAs by improving \nthe fiscal transfer system and local own-source revenues. The current efforts of GOS to develop \na sound fiscal transfer system need to be supported in coordination with other relevant initiatives \n(e.g., ADB\u2019s decentralization support program). With regard to own-source revenues, there is \nconsiderable scope to improve the yield of property tax by (i) computerization of records; (ii) \nshifting the base from annual rental value to transaction value; and (iii) removing tax exemptions \nby inclusion of military, federal and provincial properties, as well as household and commercial \nproperties that are currently excluded from the tax net. It is estimated that by including exempted \nand  unrecorded  properties,  revenues  could  be  expanded  by  at  least  50%.  User  charges\u2014\nespecially for water, sewerage, and solid waste\u2014present another area for greater scope in \nincreasing local revenues. Current tariffs are low and remain unchanged since 1998, even as \n                                                 \n4 JBIC. 2004. Karachi Vitalization Scenario.  Pakistan. \n ", "4   \nutility expenses have increased by 40% over the same period. The majority of users are not \nmetered.  User  fees  are  charged  on  the  basis  of  plot  or  flat  sizes  and  are  not  based  on \nconsumption. Currently, KWSB cannot meet its operating costs without subsidy. There is an \nurgent need to devise and implement tariff structures and rates that provide adequate revenues \nto cover cash operating costs, proper operations and maintenance, debt service, depreciation \nand a share of future capital expenditure.      \n \n15.  CDGK\u2019s  current  financial  management  systems  are  complex  and  fragmented.  An \nintegrated  accounting  and  reporting  system  is  needed.  The  two  fund  streams  (local  and \nprovincial) that continue, despite the legal amendments, need to be merged. A strong system of \nfinancial accounting and reporting should be evolved by strengthening CDGK\u2019s Department of \nFinance  and  Planning  and  making  it  mandatory  to  furnish  regular  accounting  and  financial \ninformation. Accounts offices need also to be set up in towns to integrate TMA accounting within \nthe entire system. All these efforts need to be supported by management information systems. \nDeveloping  and  implementing  a  revenue  enhancement  plan  (including  tariff  studies)  and \nimproved financial management forms a major component of the capacity building assistance \nunder the TA loan.  \n \n16.  Inadequate financial management and revenues also limit the Karachi city government in \neffectively utilizing options for such financing alternatives as to outsource urban infrastructure \ndevelopment  and  management  to  the  private  sector.  Private  sector  participation  is  further \nhindered by (i) lack of clear policies and laws at the national, provincial, and local government \nlevels to promote public-private partnerships (PPPs); and (ii) lack of institutional capacity in \nCDGK  to  develop,  analyze,  and  prepare  bankable  projects  as  well  as  to  structure,  tender, \nevaluate, contract out, negotiate, and regulate PPP transactions. The Private Participation in \nInfrastructure Development Project (PPID) currently being processed by ADB intends to address \nthe above issues by creating an enabling policy and regulatory framework at the national level \nthat will facilitate and complement the local reforms under the Project. \n \n17.  Untapped Sources of the Citizen Community Boards. Under the devolution, citizen \ncommunity boards (CCBs) were organized to enhance community participation, cost sharing, \noperation and maintenance of development projects, and accountability. Devolution stipulated \nthat 25% of the annual development funds of every town are to be spent through CCBs. While \nCCBs have been active elsewhere in the country, they have remained inactive in Karachi. As a \nresult, millions of rupees earmarked for CCBs have accumulated and provide readily available \nfunds for development. Mobilizing CCBs in Karachi would achieve public-community partnership \nfor  development  projects  and  a  greater  accountability  over  the  use  of  development  funds. \nActivation of CCBs will therefore be an important element of capacity building activities.  \n \n2.  Inadequate Infrastructure and Services and Need for Upgrading/Expansion  \n \n18.  A major outcome of the weak governance and management of the mega city has been the \ninadequate urban infrastructure and services, including water supply, sewerage, drainage, solid \nwaste management, urban transport and roads, and basic services for the city\u2019s poor.  \n \n19.  Water. While an estimated 82% of households have a water supply connection, water is \navailable in the network only for a few hours every second day. With the exception of one or two \ntowns, many households rely on tankers to supply potable water. System losses (technical and \nadministrative)  are  high  and  occur  through  leakages,  illegal  connections,  and  the  lack  of \nmetering. Water quality is poor, and over 75% of water samples taken from the system are below \nWorld Health Organization standards. This is due to (i) the lack of adequate treatment and poor \nfunctioning of treatment plants, and (ii) intermittent flow and variable pressures in the system. \nProblems are aggravated by a lack of long-term system planning for water supply and sewerage \nand insufficient cost-recovery measures that result in poor operation and maintenance.  \n ", "  5\n20.  Sewerage and Drainage. Although an estimated 89% of households have a flush toilet, \nconnected to either a sewer or septic tank, the sewerage network suffers from poor connectivity \nand a large number of undersized and broken sections. The sewerage treatment plants function \nat below their capacity due to inadequate maintenance and frequent blockages caused by solid \nwaste  entering  the  plants.  Much  of  the  untreated  industrial  and  domestic  wastewater  is \ndischarged into the stormwater drainage system and rivers and thence to Karachi Harbor and the \nArabian Sea. A large part of the stormwater drainage functions as part of the wastewater disposal \nsystem. Most of the drainage lines are heavily encroached and used for disposing of solid waste. \nThere is need (i) in the short term for programs to establish drainage rights of way and systems of \nroutine maintenance, (ii) in the medium term for a drainage master plan, and (iii) for progressively \nachieving separation between wastewater and stormwater systems.      \n \n21.  Solid Waste Management. An estimated 7,250 tons of solid waste is generated daily in \nthe city. Only about 60% of this is collected, and no more than 25% of that amount makes it to \none of the two designated city \u201clandfill\u201d sites\u2014actually open dumping sites. The remainder is \neither recovered for recycling or is disposed of by burning or by illegal dumping into open spaces. \nThe piles of uncollected waste are a nuisance and attract vermin that can carry disease. Informal \nsolid  waste  recycling  is  significant.  The  poor  performance  in  solid  waste  management  is \nexacerbated by (i) lack of a practical waste management plan involving all stakeholders (e.g., the \nformal and informal private sectors), (ii) lack of mechanisms and sound feasibility studies required \nfor outsourcing to the private sector, and (iii) inadequate capacities for tracking and monitoring of \nthe solid waste systems. \n \n22.  Urban Transport. The city population relies almost entirely on the road network for urban \ntransportation. There is currently no mass transit system per se, although many commute using \nthe network of bus routes. Rapid growth rate of private vehicles (9% per annum) leads to \novercrowding, air pollution, and accidents. While there has been a significant program of road \nbuilding, no major investment in public transport systems has taken place. Attempts to revive the \nKarachi circular railway and a light rail mass transit system have failed to attract public or private \ninvestment. The quality of major thoroughfares is generally good, but the distributor network \nvaries dramatically. The current focus on primary networks in the absence of a distributor network \nis resulting in reduced benefits from investments in primary networks. The sector operations have \nbeen adversely affected by (i) lack of clarity on institutional roles and overlapping responsibilities \nbetween several departments of CDGK5 and (ii) lack of a transport master plan to guide future \ndevelopment of roads and public transport and a strategy for financing the city\u2019s transport system. \nA detailed infrastructure assessment is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n23.  One common issue across all infrastructure subsectors is the poor standard of project \nidentification and preparation, which subsequently leads to poor performance in infrastructure and \nservices.  This  issue  further  reinforces  (i)  disjointed  and  inefficient  infrastructure  and  service \nprovision,  (ii)  failure  of  projects  to  achieve  their  anticipated  benefits,  (iii)  poor  project \nsustainability, and (iv) inability to access commercial financing for public infrastructure provision. \nThe proposed TA loan will assist CDGK in selecting and developing bankable projects to address \nthe mega city\u2019s high-priority infrastructure and service needs. \n \n24.  Katchi Abadis. Katchi abadis, in which 40% of the city population lives, are created by \ninformal settlers. They are located on public or privately-owned land without legal property rights. \nThese  settlements  have  grossly  limited  access  to  public  water  supply,  sewage,  and  other \nservices. They invest a significant part of their incomes to purchase potable water and construct \nin-house septic tanks to dispose of wastewater. About 70% of households are connected to the \npublic sector\u2019s piped water supply system. The remaining population depends on unprotected \n                                                 \n5 Recently the two units were consolidated under the same director general, but the full integration will likely take time. \n ", "6   \nsources and, on average, spends 5\u20138% of its monthly income to purchase water, which is an \nadditional factor contributing to poverty.  \n \n25.  The estimated number of these settlements is over 1,000, of which 539 have already been \nlisted for regularization and upgrading in line with the Government\u2019s policy. Expansion of these \nsettlements continues at a rate of some 10% per year, and this requires urgent attention. A two-\npronged approach is required that involves (i) upgrading, where possible, of existing squatter \nsettlements with minimum displacement and (ii) developing a shared strategy for those katchi \nabadis that cannot benefit from on-site upgrading. Coalitions of nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs), community groups, and CCBs must be formed if this approach is to be successful.       \n \n  3.  Need for an Innovative Financing Mechanism   \n \n26.  The mega city infrastructure backlogs are too huge6 to be financed through the traditional \npublic sector sources, even if their potential were fully exploited. The funding gap in meeting the \ncity\u2019s infrastructure requirements will need to be met through alternative financing in the form of \nlong-tenor debt. However, currently neither CDGK nor the TMAs have the capacity to access \ncommercial financing and to raise private finance through the capital markets for long-term funds \neven  if  they  were  empowered  to  do  so.  More  viable  institutions,  performing  financial \nintermediation functions that would specialize on Karachi\u2019s urban infrastructure sector and that \ncan pool risks and manage investor concerns, would be needed to enable CDGK and the TMAs \nto access nongovernment sources of financing.  \n \n27.  Moreover, it is commonly perceived that the Government has not been efficient in the role \nof funds provider to the sector, as its allocation of funds has not been driven by commercial \nrationale. In this environment, the federal, provincial, and city governments all strongly support \nintroducing a specialized financing vehicle (SFV) for the mega city that would (i) act in the short \nterm as an efficient conduit to channel funds from ADB and other development partners to \nKarachi infrastructure projects; (ii) provide technical assistance in preparing infrastructure projects \nto bankable standards, and monitor funded projects to ensure loan repayment; and (iii) in the \nmedium-to-long term catalyze funds from nongovernment sources for sustainable financing of city \ninfrastructure and services. The SFV is envisaged to provide commercial and concessional funds \n(depending on the ultimate design and mandate of the vehicle) both directly to infrastructure \nprojects and indirectly to other fund providers (such as in the form of guarantees to private sector \nplayers investing in infrastructure and services).  \n \n28.  A comparison of two scenarios\u2014with and without a financing vehicle\u2014for the mega city \nshows that introducing a mega city financing vehicle will facilitate allocation of financial capital \ninvestments to worthy projects and borrowers. The vehicle will provide an incentive mechanism \nfor enhancing the tariff structures, financial discipline, and creditworthiness by enforcing improved \nbudgeting, auditing, and disclosure standards at CDGK, TMAs and the utilities. It will provide a \nmechanism through which CDGK, the TMAs and utilities can gain credit experience and history \nso that they can gradually gain access to commercially based credits. Through tying funds \nallocation to commercial principles, the SFV will act as an important catalyst and promoter of \naccelerated capacity building, sound project preparation, financial reforms, commercialization of \ninfrastructure  providers,  and,  over  time,  private  financing  for  providing  and  managing \ninfrastructure  and  services  in  Karachi  and  possibly  in  Sindh.  Introduction  of  a  specialized \nfinancing vehicle for the mega city will therefore constitute a major component of the TA loan.  \n \n                                                 \n6 The estimated overall cost of priority subprojects in Appendix 5 (excluding mass transit) is about $350 million. The \noverall cost of short-term projects in CDGK\u2019s midterm development plan is estimated at above $1.165 billion. Based \non a methodology that relates growth in per capita income to the need for expanded urban infrastructure, it is \nestimated that $0.5 billion to $1.0 billion per year is required to maintain an adequate stock of infrastructure in \nKarachi. The actual requirement may be higher due to the poor state of existing infrastructure stock. ", "  7\n29.  Due to strong demand from the three levels of government for an SFV for the mega city, \nthe feasibility and design of the SFV will be undertaken by parallel TA7 to be provided by ADB \nahead of commencing the TA loan implementation. Upon completion of the feasibility study and \ndesign of the SFV, the TA loan, then, will assist in establishing and operationalizing the vehicle.  \n \n30.  Establishing a mega city financing vehicle, however, will not automatically and by itself \nresult in making extensive sources of alternative funds available for Karachi\u2019s infrastructure. It \nmust be accompanied by other reforms, including (i) a supportive framework for appropriate tariff \nschedules;  (ii)  a  better  fiscal  balance  between  different  levels  of  government;  (iii)  resource \nmobilization  at  the  local  level;  (iv)  CDGK  operating  on  a  more  efficient  basis;  (v) \ncommercialization of water, sanitation, and other service providers; (vi) management systems, \nincluding accounting practices, that allow disclosure of amounts due to and from others, (vii) \nchanges in attitudes of residents about paying tariffs; and (viii) well designed, bankable projects \nwith tariff structures to recover costs of capital, operation and maintenance, and with enhanced \nproject management capacities to create assets quickly so that incomes from investments begin \nto accrue without delay. All these reforms are important elements of the comprehensive capacity \nbuilding program under the TA loan. The reforms for establishing the SFV for the mega city and \nthe reforms for capacity building at city level will be complementary to ADB\u2019s ongoing PPID \ninitiative at the national level.  \n \n31.  While Pakistan\u2019s financial sector has been significantly reformed over the past decade, \nwith ADB and other external assistance, there has been virtually no commercial lending and \nprivate financing of urban infrastructure projects in Karachi and other cities. Thus, the SFV would \nnot compete with existing financial institutions in the country. Rather, the SFV, working closely \nwith ADB, governments, and existing financial intermediaries, would help to develop a market for \ncommercial lending and private financing of urban infrastructure that could subsequently be \naccessed by the existing financial intermediaries.  \n \n  4.  External Assistance and Lessons Learned from ADB assistance  \n \n32.  Since 1976, ADB has provided eight loans to the urban sector, totaling about $450 million, \nand a further $6.75 million for TA in the water supply, sanitation, and urban development sectors. \nTwo loans8 were provided to Karachi in the urban sector 20 and 15 years ago, respectively. The \ncity has also been the beneficiary of two ADB programs: the Decentralization Support Program \nand the Sindh Devolved Social Services. Moreover, ADB is currently funding TA in Sindh on \nenvironmental management that should also benefit Karachi.  \n \n33.  The World Bank provided assistance to Karachi in the past in the water supply and power \nsectors. Its current assistance is through GOS, with which it has a line of structural adjustment \ncredit. Another initiative under the World Bank\u2019s umbrella is support of the Water and Sanitation \nProgram to KWSB on institutional strengthening. In recent years, the principal bilateral source of \ninvestment in the urban sector in Karachi has been the Government of Japan, particularly in the \nwater supply, sewerage, and transport sectors. KWSB is completing a water treatment project \nsupported by JBIC, which also assisted in preparing the \u201cRevitalization Scenario\u201d for Karachi. The \nJapan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has begun preparing a master plan for Karachi\u2019s \nwater supply and sewerage, and it has plans to support preparation of a transport master plan for \nthe city. The list of external assistance is attached as Appendix 3. \n \n                                                 \n7 ADB. 2005.

Lessons learned from the two ADB loan projects to Karachi (footnote 8), which were \nevaluated as \u201cunsuccessful\u201d and \u201cpartially successful,\u201d include the need for (i) greater attention to \nsustainability,  (ii)  enhanced  project  design  based  on  sound  assessments,  (iii)  careful \nconsideration for institutional shortcomings of executing and implementing agencies, and (iv) \ngreater efforts to address the financial insolvency problems of the Karachi local government \nbodies. A specific lesson derived from the previous Karachi Urban Development Project is that \nurban upgrading is complex and must be able to deal with the broad range of problems faced by \nkatchi abadis dwellers, including that of regularization and security of tenure. All these lessons \nsuggest that urban development assistance demands a holistic approach. To be of lasting value, \nmajor capital investments need to be supported by capacity building, policy, legal, regulatory, and \ninstitutional reforms, as well as new and innovative financing vehicles that facilitate provision of \nhigh-quality infrastructure services on a sustainable basis. The proposed project incorporates \nthese lessons into its design.  \n  5.  Summary of the Rationale \n \n35.  The economy and population of Karachi have expanded significantly, but provision of \ninfrastructure and services has not kept pace with this rapid growth in the absence of funds and \nadequate mega city governance and management systems. Infrastructure and services that are \ninsufficient and unreliable are adding to business and household costs, hurting Karachi\u2019s urban \nand  natural  environments,  and  decreasing  the  city\u2019s  global  competitiveness  compared  with \nalternative Asian mega cities.  \n \n36.  Devolution has provided opportunities for effective service delivery but left many issues to \nbe addressed in areas such as (i) fiscal imbalance, limited revenues, and unclear and incomplete \nallocation of responsibilities between levels of government; and (ii) the inadequacy of the city\u2019s \nand towns\u2019 financial and technical capacities to fully meet their new responsibilities within the \ndevolved framework. There is need for substantial and long-term capacity building at the city level \nif the devolution is to yield the intended benefits for improved governance and more effective \nurban service delivery. There is also increasing recognition that the growing gap between urban \ninfrastructure demand and current supply cannot be met through traditional government sources, \nincluding  local  government  revenues,  subsidies,  and  transfers  from  the  higher  levels  of \ngovernment.  Alternative  sources  of  financing  and  new  ways  of  providing  infrastructure  and \nservices are required. Provision of urban infrastructure services need to be placed on a fully \ncommercial and self-sustaining basis. Meanwhile, necessary regulatory and institutional reforms \nshould be effected.   \n \n37.    Previous external assistance in Karachi has been piecemeal and has not been based \nupon an integrated approach to improve urban infrastructure and services on a sustainable basis. \nThe proposed TA loan is intended to address the mega city development needs with a long-term \nand holistic approach through (i) building capacities at the local level for effective city planning \nand  management,  (ii)  adopting  and  implementing  commercial  principles  in  the  provision  of \ninfrastructure and services, (iii) supporting the preparation of bankable projects for mega city \ndevelopment that may subsequently be funded by ADB in its loans to Karachi initially over the \nnext 4 years, and (iv) promoting reforms for sustainable financing. The TA loan represents the \nfirst intervention of a long-term assistance from ADB, and it will establish the required foundation \nfor effectively utilizing and sustaining future ADB investments in the mega city.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n38.  The immense size of Karachi, the magnitude of its investment requirements, and the scale \nof the needs for urban policy and institutional reforms suggest that a traditional approach of one-\noff projects will not work. There is need for a series of appropriately sequenced and integrated ", "  9\ninterventions whose cumulative effect will act as a catalyst to speed up the development process \nin Karachi.  \n \n39.  The expected impact of the TA loan is an enhanced and sustained contribution of Karachi \nto national development and an improved quality of life for its residents, including the poor. The \nanticipated outcomes are (i) improved city planning, management, and financing; (ii) improved \nand expanded urban infrastructure and services; and (iii) sustainable and efficient financing of \nmega city urban infrastructure and services. To these ends, the TA loan will provide resources for \n(i) building the capacities of CDGK, the TMAs and utilities in city planning, management, and \nfinancing, as well as in adopting and implementing commercial principles in the provision of \ninfrastructure and services; (ii) assistance in preparing bankable projects for expanding and \nimproving mega city infrastructure and services that may subsequently be funded by ADB or \nother development partners in their lending assistance to Karachi; and (iii) establishment and \noperationalization of an SFV for the mega city infrastructure and services. It is expected that the \nTA loan will also enhance the governments\u2019 sense of ownership of the investment projects, \ncapacity building, and institutional reforms.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n40.   The TA loan comprises four parts: part A: Capacity Building Facility for CDGK, TMAs and \nutilities in planning, managing, and financing urban infrastructure and services; part B: Project \nPreparation Facility; part C: Establishment and Development of SFV; and part D: Support for TA \nLoan Management.    \n \n1.  Part A: Capacity Building Facility  \n   \n41.   The objective of part A is to make a pool of resources available to CDGK and other city \nagencies to undertake a comprehensive capacity building program. Areas for capacity building \nhave already been identified and may be further reviewed and updated during the TA loan \nimplementation. A priority activity under part A will be organizational development of CDGK and \ncompletion of its transition under the devolution. This will include (i) review and evolution of new \nregulatory relationships between GOS, CDGK and the TMAs; (ii) clarifying and developing the \nfunctional  responsibilities  within  CDGK  and  the  TMAs;  and  (iii)  reorganization  of  CDGK  to \nappropriately  reflect  the  new  mandates.  Other  major  components  of  the  capacity  building \nassistance are (i) financial management and revenue improvements, (ii) enhancing accounting \nand  establishing  management  information  systems  within  CDGK  and  TMAs,  (iii)  customer \norientation  within  CDGK  and  TMAs,  (iv)  reforms  for  commercialization  of  KWSB,  and  (v) \nrevitalization of CCBs to promote community and public partnership in the delivery of urban \nservices. These activities will be supported by human resource management and rationalization \nstrategies and training programs. Capacity building assistance will also include support for mega \ncity planning through assistance in (i) building capacities for and institutionalization of strategic \nplanning; (ii) master planning and preparation of a sector investment program; and (iii) developing \nand implementing reforms to address the weaknesses of current planning practices in terms of \ninstitutional  roles  and  capacities,  land  management,  development  control  and  building \nregulations. The detailed scope of the subprograms under the capacity building facility is provided \nin Appendix 4. \n \n42.  To ensure institutional reform, time-bound reform action plans, to be agreed by GOS and \nCDGK, will be developed at the early stages of the capacity building subprograms. Adherence to \nthese action plans will be sought to ensure that the capacity building assistance will bring a \nchange in the mega city\u2019s governance and management. Investment subprojects will also identify \nthe required subsector reforms to provide the content of policy dialogue to be pursued during \nprocessing of the follow-on loans.  \n \n \n ", "10   \n2.  Part B: Project Preparation Facility \n    \n43.  Part B will provide resources for preparing feasibility studies for bankable projects. It will \naddress the poor standard of project planning, identification, and preparation, as well as the need \nfor integrated development of investments. The resources for selecting and developing bankable \nprojects will be used flexibly in response to evolving priorities. The feasibility studies will establish \nthe technical, financial, institutional, economic, social and environmental feasibility of projects \nproposed for funding. The facility will also provide advisory services in developing public-private \nmodalities for financing, constructing, operating and maintaining infrastructure facilities, as well as \nfor preparing and vetting documents related to projects with private-public participation. Particular \nattention will be given to transferring knowledge and skills in project preparation to CDGK and the \nutilities. The studies will be carried out in accordance with ADB guidelines and methodologies to \nassess the financial feasibility, economic benefits, costs, distributional effects, social and poverty-\nreduction impacts and benefits. They will examine resettlement costs, environmental impacts, \nand effects on gender equity and indigenous peoples. Based on the mega city infrastructure \nassessments, a number of projects that were identified as high priority are proposed for feasibility \nassessments under the TA loan. During the TA loan implementation, these may be further \nreviewed and replaced with new projects identified on the basis of agreed criteria, which, in turn, \nwill become the project prescreening tool to be employed by the specialized financing vehicle. \nWhere needed, resources under the project preparation facility may also be used to prepare \ndetailed design work to accelerate project implementation. Profiles of the priority subprojects are \nprovided in Appendix 5.  \n \n44.  Water, Sewerage, and Drainage. The subprojects proposed for feasibility study in these \nsubsectors aim to address the key issues responsible for the poor quality of infrastructure and \nservices. Although a master plan for water and sewerage is currently being prepared by JICA, \nthere is no drainage master plan. The subprojects are directed to enhancing the utility of existing \nsystems and networks through (i) water loss reduction, (ii) sewerage and drainage rationalization \nand system strengthening, (iii) increasing sewage treatment capacities to address the major \nenvironmental and health issues caused by water pollution, (iv) preparation of a drainage master \nplan, and (v) developing effective operation and maintenance strategies. These subprojects are \nsupported by advisory studies on tariff reforms and organizational development and by capacity \nbuilding assistance to reinforce the sustainability of rehabilitated infrastructure and services.  \n \n45.  Solid Waste Management. In this subsector, the proposed priority assistance aims to \nsupport Government initiatives in privatizing primary waste collection and disposal, along with \nrationalization  and  development  of  the  solid  waste  management  system.  This  involves \n(i) improved  systems  for  contracting  out  management  and  monitoring  of  the  private  sector \ncollection system; (ii) design of optimal arrangements for continued involvement of the informal \nsector in recycling, reuse and recovery of waste; (iii) identification of garbage transfer sites, and \narrangements  for  contracting  out  management  and  monitoring  of  the  bulk  system,  where \npossible, through public-private partnerships; and (iv) determination of optimal landfill sites and \nproposals  for  design,  construction,  and  operation  of  the  sites,  where  feasible,  through \npublic-private partnership. \n \n46.  Roads and Transport. In this subsector, strategic emphasis is placed on mass transit \nsystems. Proposed assistance includes advisory services to the Mass Transit Cell for (i) a critical \nreview of the 1991 mass transit network proposal and development of a strategy and action plan \nto fund the priority elements of this network, (ii) dissemination of information on the plans and \nobtaining of government and public support for the proposals, (iii) completion of work to ensure \nthat the plans meet government and ADB\u2019s safeguards requirements, and (iv) development of a \nstrategy for implementing the mass transit network under a private-public partnership modality. \nWhile the services do not include a transport master plan, close coordination will be maintained \nwith JICA, which intends to prepare the transport master plan. Interventions in the urban transport \nsector will also incorporate components for air pollution control and air quality management, ", "  11\nconsidering that urban transport is the biggest source of air pollution in Karachi. While the \nstrategic emphasize is on mass transit, it is recognized that this development will take time. \nTherefore, well justified investments for new roads may also be included among the selected \npriority subprojects.                    \n \n47.  Katchi Abadis. To develop the metropolis as a city without squatters, the slow pace of \nupgrading katchi abadis needs to be accelerated while complementary long-term efforts are \nrequired to address the issue of their proliferation. The project interventions include a program \ncombining (i) in situ upgrading of katchi abadis and (ii) a shared strategy for those katchi abadis \nwhose in situ upgrading presents difficulties, through innovative and pro-poor redevelopment \nschemes and mechanisms to facilitate the access of the poor to land and services. It is also \nrecognized  that  initiatives  for  katchi  abadis  improvements  must  be  placed  within  a  broader \ncontext of (i) national urbanization strategies to establish a balanced urban structure in the \nprovince  and  the  country,  (ii)  policies  related  to  migration,  and  (iii)  economic  strategies  to \ngenerate higher levels of production and income in other cities and regions outside Karachi. \nThese are the mandates of the mega city coordination committee that is chaired by the Planning \nCommission  at  the  national  level. The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social strategy  is  in \nAppendix 6.  \n \n3.  Part C: Specialized Financing Vehicle  \n \n48.  Part C will support the establishment and operationalization of an innovative financing \nvehicle to address the needs for long-term and sustainable financing of mega city infrastructure \nand services. The SFV will be a dedicated urban infrastructure financing entity that provides \n(depending on its design and development stage) concessional and commercial funds to CDGK, \nits utilities, TMAs, and possibly the private sector investing in urban infrastructure and services in \nKarachi (and perhaps in Sindh). It is envisaged that the role, products and services, operating \nprinciples, and financial strategy of the SFV will evolve. The specialized financing vehicle will act \nin the short term as an efficient conduit for channeling funds to mega city infrastructure and \nservices.  It  will  have  transparent  criteria  applicable  to  loans  and  concessional  funds. \nCriteria-based allocation of funds that is coupled with advisory services for preparing bankable \nprojects will encourage financial discipline and commercial principles in CDGK and its utilities. \nCDGK and the utilities that draw on the resources of the SFV will be expected to service their \nloans  out  of  the  financial  revenues/cash  flows  and  economic  benefits  generated  by  those \ninvestments funded by such loans. When designed and resourced in an appropriate manner, the \nSFV will be an important catalyst in gradually establishing a local debt culture and a reliable credit \ntrack for future borrowings. Consequently, it will help CDGK and its utilities in their transition \ntoward commercial financing of infrastructure and services. In the long term, with enhanced local \ncapacities and a maturing financial market, the SFV will act as an agent to mobilize funds for \nmega city infrastructure from nongovernment sources, including international financial institutions, \ndomestic and international commercial lenders, and capital markets.  \n \n49.  Given the Government\u2019s strong commitment to accelerating the reforms for establishing \nthe SFV, the feasibility and design of the SFV will be undertaken by a parallel TA (footnote 7) \nfinanced on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The TA, which will commence ahead \nof the TA loan implementation, will assess design features, legal structures, strategic road map, \nproduct types and terms for the SFV, and it will include due financial analysis to ensure the SFV\u2019s \nviability and sustainability.  \n \n50.  More specifically, the TA study will undertake (i) full analysis of economic and financial \nmarket conditions and trends, as well as coordination with PPID; (ii) analysis of the potential \nmarket for the SFV, quality of borrowers and projects; (iii) evaluation of design features and \nselection of an overall design that best meets Karachi\u2019s needs; and (iv) selection of an existing \nfinancial intermediary, government and/or private sector partners to work with the TA in preparing \nthe SFV\u2019s detailed design. Further tasks will include completing the market demand analysis and \n ", "12   \nmarketing plan; estimating the financial resources required to make the SFV operational and \nviable; detailed financial analysis, including risks and uncertainties; preparation of the business \ncase, business plan, and strategic road map for the SFV; and preparation of the operations \nmanual to guide the SFV\u2019s operations. Ownership and management structures of the SFV will be \ncarefully  designed  to  ensure  a  professional  and  autonomous  management  and  a  powerful \nrepresentation of stakeholders at board level. The intent is to maximize the SFV\u2019s potential to \nserve as a force for reforms in Karachi. Due attention will be paid to analyzing the SFV\u2019s role \nwithin the current governance framework to ensure that the SFV will enhance the devolved \nstructure. Appendix 7 provides the detailed scope of the feasibility and design of the SFV to be \nprepared under the TA. Also provided is a summary of institutional roles with respect to the mega \ncity urban infrastructure sector and the SFV\u2019s potential role within that framework.  \n \n51.   Upon completing the feasibility study and design, the TA loan under part C will assist in \nestablishing and operationalizing the SFV (see the sequencing of SFV activities in Appendix 7). \nEarly operation of the SFV would help in marketing its financial products and technical services, \ncompleting high-priority projects to bankable standards, and beginning staff recruitment, training \nand capacity building in order to expand skills, expertise, and domestic and international contacts \nin commercial infrastructure financing. Part C will provide start-up funding (seed money) for the \nSFV for the first 3 years until project flows and other financial products and services begin to \ngenerate significant revenues. Funding would decline through time as the SFV begins to generate \nrevenues. Funding for year 1 would support a unit of 15 people, including salaries, benefits, and \nother administration costs as well as significant funding for capacity building and training. The \nsubsidies in years 2 and 3 would cover the costs of about 10 and five staff, respectively, and the \nadditional training in those years. The seed money could be repaid once the SFV becomes \nprofitable.  \n \n  4.  Part D: Support for TA Loan Management   \n \n52.  Part D will include consultancy support to the project support unit (PSU) to be established \nin the Sindh Department of Finance (DOF) and the project working group (PWG) and local \nsupport unit (LSU) in CDGK. A core team of experts comprising three international advisors in (i) \nurban  governance  and  capacity  building,  (ii)  finance,  and  (iii)  infrastructure  planning  and \nengineering will be hired. These advisors will be supported by long-term local consultants. The \ncore team will assist the PSU, PWG, and LSU in managing and implementing the overall project. \nThe PSU in the DOF will be supported in overseeing the TA loan and implementing part C. The \nPWG and LSU in CDGK will be assisted in (i) ensuring coordination between various activities \nand studies of parts A and B; (ii) further refining the scope of the parts A and B and finalizing the \nscope of activities and terms of reference (TOR); (iii) determining the prioritization of project \nfeasibility and other studies to be carried out; and (iv) finalizing detailed TORs for the subprojects \nand studies, preparing requests for proposals, and evaluating technical proposals for engaging \nconsultants. At the outset, priority activities of the team will be to review the scope of the TA loan \n(especially parts A and B), review the scope of each study and subproject, and make justified and \nnecessary adjustments and revisions in the overall scope of parts A and B and individual studies \nand subprojects. Facilitating, coordinating, and monitoring the development and implementation \nof reform action plans under the capacity building programs will form a critical task of the team. \nThe team will also be responsible for assisting the PSU and LSU in evaluating the outputs of \nconsultants for various subprojects. The detailed scope of part D is given in Appendix 8.  \n \nC.  Cost Estimates \n \n53.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $13.33 million equivalent, comprising foreign \nexchange costs of $6.460 million and local currency costs of $6.870 million equivalent (Table 1). \nTaxes and duties are included in these costs and relate to the equipment purchases under each \nsubproject. While not a concern under this project, future recurrent costs related to operations ", "  13\nand maintenance will be an issue for follow-on loans, and these will be incorporated into the \nTORs for each subproject. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 9. \n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nComponent  Foreign  Local  Total  Share \nExchange  Currency  Cost  (%) \nI. Base Costs         \nA.

Financing Plan \n \n54.  The Government has requested ADB to provide a loan in the amount of $10.0 million \nequivalent from its Special Funds resources, representing 75% of the total project cost. The loan \nwill have a term of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and \nconditions as will be set forth in the draft loan agreement. The ADB loan will cover 100% of the \nforeign exchange cost and 51% of the local currency cost, excluding taxes. The financing plan is \nsummarized in Table 2.  \n \n55.  The borrower will be the Government of Pakistan, which will re-lend to the GOS on the \nsame financial terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. Counterpart funds of $3.33 million \n(25%) will be financed by the GOS and will cover local currency costs. Counterpart funds are \nexpected  to  cover  items  such  as  (i)  remuneration  of  counterpart  staff,  (ii)  local  travel,  (iii) \nequipment and materials, (iv) surveys and data gathering, (v) taxes and duties, and (vi) other \nmiscellaneous  costs.  As  most  of  these  funds  will  be  provided  in  kind,  the  availability  of \ncounterpart financing should not be an issue. Availability of sufficient counterpart funds and \nresources to cover these costs was confirmed.  \n \nTable 2:  Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total  Share \nExchange  Currency  Cost  (%) \nAsian Development Bank  6.46  3.54  10.00  75 \nGovernment of Sindh  0.00  3.33   3.33  25 \n     Total  6.46  6.87  13.33   100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  TA Loan Management  \n \n56.  The Executing Agency (EA) for the Project will be the DOF of the GOS. With the capacity, \nmandate, and a cadre of professional staff able to provide strategic and policy guidance, the DOF \nwill be a powerful champion for the Project and especially able to guide development of the SFV. \n ", "14   \nThe EA will be responsible for overseeing the overall project as well as implementing part C. In \naddition, the EA will engage the consultants for part D in consultation with CDGK. A dedicated \nPSU will be established in the DOF and staffed with suitably qualified personnel. The Project \nDirector  of  the  PSU  will  be    a  senior  ranking  officer  grade  BS.  19/20  from  DOF,  Sindh. \nConsultants who will assist in designing the SFV will be based in the DOF.  \n \n57.  A project steering committee (PSC), chaired by the Government of Sindh\u2019s Minister of \nFinance, will be formed. It will include the Minister, Planning and Development, Sindh; Minister, \nLocal Government, Sindh; Nazim (Karachi city mayor), Additional Chief Secretary (Development); \nPlanning  and  Development,  Sindh;  Secretary  Finance,  Sindh;  Secretary  Local  Government, \nSindh; District Coordination Officer of CDGK, Project Director, PSU, and two representatives from \nNGO/academia. The project director, PSU will also act as the secretary of the PSC. The PSC will \nprovide policy support, oversee project progress, facilitate coordination and cooperation among \nagencies concerned, and, more importantly, ensure the timely undertaking of reform actions to \nestablish  and  operationalize  the  SFV  and  to  implement  revenue  mobilization  and  financial \nmanagement reforms at the CDGK and TMA levels. The committee will meet quarterly, or upon \nrequest by any of its members. The Government may also form a committee to oversee the \nimplementation of part C. The committee shall be chaired by Adviser to Prime Minister, on \nFinance/Minister of Finance. \n     \n58.  CDGK will be the implementing agency for parts A and B (Capacity Building and Project \nPreparation facilities). A project working group (PWG), chaired by the district coordination officer \nand comprising executive district officers and managing directors of CDGK departments and \nutilities, will be formed to provide oversight for operational matters related to parts A and B and \ncoordinating with part C. The PWG will meet bimonthly and be responsible for approving the \nprioritization of subprojects, final TORs, and consultant selection under parts A and B prior to \ntheir submission to the PSU for onward transmittal to ADB. The PWG will be responsible also for \nthe  review,  approval,  and  timely  implementation  of  reform  action  plans  prepared  under  the \nsubprograms of the capacity building facility. Coordination with the TMAs will be maintained \nthrough an ad hoc district-town coordination committee chaired by the district coordination officer \nand  consisting  of  chief  officers  of  TMAs.  The  committee  will  meet  quarterly  to  ensure  that \nfeedback is obtained from the TMAs regarding subproject prioritization and selection.  \n59.  The LSU will be established in the Department of Finance and Planning  of CDGK. It will \nbe led by a director who will be a senior officer of Sindh not less than grade BS.19 with suitable \nqualifications and experience. LSU will plan, coordinate, and monitor the activities and individual \nprograms of part A (Capacity Building Facility) and part B (Project Preparation Facility) that will \nmainly  be  implemented  by  the  individual  subproject  units  in  the  respective  CDGK  sector \ndepartments.  The  LSU,  in  consultation  with  relevant  sector  departments  and  utilities,  will \nundertake  for  submission  to  PWG  the  preparation  of  proposals  for  prioritizing  subprojects, \nfinalization of TORs, and engagement of consultants. It will also be responsible for conducting \norganization-wide capacity building programs (such as the organizational development program). \nUpon prioritization of a subproject for feasibility and/or other study, subproject units (SUs) will be \nformed  in  the  respective  sector  departments  and  utilities.  Appendix  10  provides  a  project \norganization chart. \n \n60.  An  objective  of  utilizing  the  TA  loan  modality  is  to  ensure  increased  government \nownership  of  CDGK  capacity  building  reforms,  reforms  for  innovative  financing,  and  project \npreparatory program and activities. It is expected that through implementing the subprojects \nunder the TA loan, CDGK will increase its capacity to address substantial project preparation and \nsector development issues.  \n \n61.  The specific criteria utilized in selecting subprojects require that a subproject must \n(i)  have been identified and prepared\u2014at least to project concept stage\u2014by a city \ndistrict department and/or affiliated utility/company;  ", "  15\n(ii)  be based on a current or recent sector strategy, sector master plan or roadmap \nand the CDGK\u2019s medium-term development plan; \n(iii)  be in line with ADB\u2019s objectives as stated in the current country strategy and \nprogram (CSP) or CSPU; \n(iv)  be organizationally and technically feasible; \n(v)  be financially and economically viable and sustainable; \n(vi)  be  environmentally  responsible;  e.g.,  all  impacts  should  be  mitigated  and,  if \nnecessary, an environmental assessment should be prepared in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002); \n(vii)  be socially responsible; e.g., a resettlement plan in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy \non Involuntary Resettlement (1995) will be prepared under each subproject, and, if \nnecessary,  an  assessment  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nIndigenous People (1998); and  \n(viii)  be implementable during the project period. \n \n62.  All follow-on projects that arise from successfully completed subproject feasibility studies \nand that are selected for further financing by ADB must have their feasibility studies reviewed by \nthe LSU/PWG/PSU and ADB. The standard subproject proposal form to be used by the LSU \nwhen presenting the respective subproject proposal to the PSU is in Appendix 11. \n \n2.  Implementation Schedule and Period \n \n63.  The overall implementation schedule for the TA loan is 4 years, and it is expected to be \nimplemented from January 2006 to January 2010. The implementation schedule is shown in \nAppendix 12. It is expected that most capacity building subprojects will start at the initial stages of \nthe implementation, with the mega city planning and organizational development subprojects to \nbe implemented at the earliest. With the assistance of TA loan management consultants, the \nschedule of subprojects will be further reviewed and finalized at the outset of the implementation \nto ensure that (i) capacity building is provided only when duties and responsibilities are clear \n(following organizational development activities), (ii) subprojects which need to be justified in \nterms of the master plan are only taken forward once this work is completed, and (iii) logical \nsequencing and linkage between the feasibility studies and relevant capacity building activities \nare established in order to ensure integrated and coherent development.  \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n64.  All goods and services under the TA loan will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. The EA and IA will determine the required goods and services and \nsubmit their requests for ADB approval. As most procurement is expected to be for routine office \nand administrative equipment with an estimated value of less than $100,000, and because this is \nmost efficiently acquired off the shelf, direct procurement procedures are recommended. Supply \ncontracts  for  equipment  valued  at  more  than  $500,000  will  follow  international  competitive \nbidding, while contracts of $500,000 or less will follow international shopping procedures.      \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n65.  The LSU, in close consultation with subproject units and under the authority (for approval) \nof the PWG, will be responsible for processing consultant recruitment to undertake feasibility \nstudies, capacity building, or other technical assistance work under parts A and B. The PSU will \nbe responsible for consultant recruitment activities related to part C. Consultants can be either \ninternational or domestic firms, individuals, or training institutions, and these will provide the \nrequired services in accordance with the TOR for each subproject. Such subprojects include \n(i) advisory services and technical assistance to CDGK and other city agencies on specific sector \nissues; (ii) capacity building programs; (iii) city planning studies; (iv) preparation of subproject \nfeasibility  studies;  (v)  preparation  of  subproject  detailed  designs,  bidding  documents,  and \n ", "16   \nevaluation (for a few priority projects only, as normally detailed design costs would be included \nunder the main loan); (vi) development of a public-private modality for the financing, construction, \noperating and maintaining of infrastructure facilities; (vii) preparation and vetting of documents \nrelating to such projects involving private-public participation; (viii) preparation of environmental, \npoverty, and social assessments, resettlement plans, and indigenous people\u2019s development plans \n(as required), and (ix) such other consulting services in relation to Project as agreed between \nADB and Government.  \n \n66.  The consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. ADB will review and approve the processing of consultant recruitment. Supervision \nof consultants\u2019 work and monitoring of subprojects will be carried out by the LSU in cooperation \nwith SUs in the respective sector departments and utility agencies. Logistical support will be \nprovided to the consultants, and outputs will be reviewed by the LSU in close coordination with \nSUs. Each consultant contract is viewed as an independent event, and it is subject to evaluation \nby the LSU, review and approval by the PWG/PSU, and agreement by ADB. In cases where it \nemerges that the SU and/or PWG/PSU find consultants\u2019 performance to be unsatisfactory, the \nPWG/PSU reserves the right, subject to ADB's agreement, to terminate the contract and recruit \nnew consultants for further subproject work. Tentative estimates for the entire TA loan are for \napproximately 145 and 430 person-months of international and domestic consulting services, \nrespectively,  with  regard  to  the  combined  capacity  building,  planning  and  feasibility,  and \nengineering studies. These estimates are flexible and may be reviewed during implementation. \n \n67.  Consultant  firms  will  be  engaged  using  ADB\u2019s  quality  and  cost-based  selection \nprocedures or quality-based selection procedures, depending upon which is most suitable for the \nparticular subproject. In some cases where it can be reasonably justified, direct selection may be \nnecessary. Quality-based selection may be required in cases where the technical expertise is the \noverriding  requirement.  A  set  of  outline  TORs  for  all  major  capacity  building  and  priority \nengineering subprojects are in Supplementary Appendix B. These TORs will be further reviewed, \nand additional refinements are expected prior to issuing requests for proposal documents, which \nwill include the detailed TORs. \n \n68.  To expedite implementation, the GOS and CDGK have requested advance action in \nengaging consultants for part D: Support for TA Loan Management and some subprojects of high \npriority.  Engagement  is  expected  to  advance  up  to  the  stage  of  evaluating  the  technical \nproposals. The Government has been informed that approval of advance action does not commit \nADB to finance the Project. \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n69.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) was explained to and discussed with the Government, \nGOS  and  CDGK.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and \nthe bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection \nwith the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the \nrecords and accounts of the GOS, CDGK and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements  \n \n70.  Immediately upon loan effectiveness, the GOS will open and maintain a project imprest \naccount for PSU at National Bank of Pakistan to ensure the timely release of loan proceeds and ", "  17\nexpedite  project  implementation.  The  imprest  account  shall  be  established,  managed, \nreplenished, and liquidated in accordance with the ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook, January \n2001, as amended from time to time, and detailed arrangements agreed upon by the Borrower \nand  ADB.  The  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  into  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  the \nequivalent  of  six  months  of  estimated  expenditures.  The  statement  of  expenditures  (SOE) \nprocedure may be used for reimbursement of eligible expenditures for the Project and to liquidate \nadvances  provided  into  the  imprest  account.  Any  individual  payment  to  be  reimbursed  or \nliquidated under the SOE procedure will not exceed $50,000. The loan proceeds may also be \ndisbursed directly to the consultants under the direct payment procedure.  \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation Report \n \n71.  Each subproject unit will monitor and evaluate project performance in accordance with the \nTORs and the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1, and it will report progress through \nLSU to PWG. Primary monitoring targets will be agreed between the PSU and PWG for each \nsubproject in consultation with ADB, and these targets will be used by the subproject units and \nreported to the PWG, PSU, and ADB in accordance with the established reporting schedule. \n \n8.  Reports \n \n72.  The PSU will monitor project and subproject executions to provide a basis for reporting to \nGOS and ADB. Monthly progress reports on project implementation will be submitted by LSU \nthrough PWG to the PSU. The reports will contain sufficient information to enable the PSU and \nPWG to monitor progress, identify issues, and ensure compliance with the objectives of the \nsubprojects. Monthly progress reports will be consolidated by PSU into quarterly progress reports \nfor submission to ADB. These quarterly reports will indicate, among other things, (i) progress \nmade against established targets, (ii) problems and issues encountered and remedial actions \ntaken or proposed to resolve the issues, and (iii) proposed project activities to be undertaken as \nwell as progress expected during the subsequent implementation period. Each report will also \ncontain an executive summary with format and content allowing ADB staff to readily capture key \ninformation for use in project performance reports. TA loan management consultants at the outset \nwill prepare a format that reflects the unique features of the TA loan implementation and relevant \nsets of data and information. Consultants are also expected to provide, as necessary, more \ndetailed reports for the PWG, PSU, and ADB review missions. In addition, the draft final report of \neach subproject will be submitted by PSU to ADB for review.  \n \n73.  The LSU, together with each SU, will prepare a subproject completion report for each \nsubproject within 3 months of submitting the draft final report for the relevant subproject and will \nforward it through the PWG/PSU for ADB\u2019s review. This report should contain detailed information \nconcerning  the  implementation  and  outcome  of  the  relevant  subproject  and  evaluate  how \neffectively the subproject has addressed the requirements of the respective TOR. The TA loan \nproject  completion  report  will  be  provided  by  the  PSU  within  3  months  of  the  completed \ndisbursement. \n \n9.  Evaluation of Consultants Reports \n \n74.  The PSU and ADB will review and provide comments to the consultants on the interim \nand draft final reports of feasibility and other advisory studies. With respect to capacity building \nsubprojects as well as the SFV, ADB will be actively engaged throughout the progress of the \nprojects. ADB will be especially active in regard to those that have policy and sector reform \nimplications.  \n ", "18   \n10.  Project Review and Accounts and Audits \n \n75.  ADB  will  conduct  regular  project  reviews  of  the  TA  loan,  facilities  utilization,  and \nsubprojects to respond to significant fund underutilization and the need for fund reallocation, if \nany. A midterm project review will be undertaken halfway through the TA loan implementation to \nassess the overall implementation progress and achievements made to date. \n \n76.  The LSU and PSU will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify \nfinancing resources received and expenditures made on the TA loan, including expenditures for \nequipment and services financed out of the loan proceeds and local funds. These TA loan \naccounts and related financial statements, as well as the statement of expenditure procedure, will \nbe audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards by auditors acceptable to ADB. \nThe Government will submit annual audited reports and related financial statements to ADB \nwithin 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \n77.  The population of the mega city, including both households and businesses, will have \nsustainable benefits from improved governance and CDGK\u2019s enhanced capacities for mega city \nplanning,  management,  and  provision  of  infrastructure  and  services.  This  will  be  achieved \nthrough (i) organizational development of CDGK by clarifying roles and responsibilities within the \ndevolved structure; (ii) managerial and technical capacity improvements; (iii) improved financial \nplanning, budgeting, monitoring and reporting, as well as enhanced local revenues; (iv) improved \ncustomer  orientation  and  corporate  reforms  within  CDGK,  utilities,  and  TMAs;  and  (v) \nparticipatory urban service delivery and improved public, private, and community partnership in \nurban service provision through activation of the CCBs.  \n \n78.  The  TA  loan  through  the  project  preparation  facility  will  support  Karachi\u2019s  economic \ndevelopment and poverty reduction by efficient and timely provision of funds and assistance for \npreparing  bankable  investment  projects.  The  subprojects  will  address  the  high-priority \ninfrastructure  investment  needs  as  well  as  the  needs  of  poor  settlements  that  make  up  a \nsubstantial  portion  of  the  city.  The  immediate  beneficiary  will  be  the  CDGK,  as  its  project \npreparation  capacity  will  improve  to  international  standards.  CDGK\u2019s  gains  will  also  include \nimproved governance and transparency in consultant selection and procurement, as consultant \nengagement and procurement will follow ADB guidelines that ensure transparent and competitive \nprocesses. \n \n79.  The TA loan will ensure sustainable development of the mega city by helping to establish \nand operationalize a viable specialized mega city financing vehicle, which will (i) act as an \nefficient conduit for channeling funds to mega city infrastructure development, (ii) be an important \ncatalyst and promoter in accelerating commercialization of urban infrastructure service providers, \nand (iii) in the medium-to-long term, mobilize funds from alternative nongovernment sources. The \nultimate beneficiaries will be the residents and businesses of not only Karachi but the country as \na whole, as Karachi\u2019s contribution to the economy goes beyond the city and province. \n \n80.  Major potential risks include those related to (i) possible delays in project implementation \ndue to inadequate capacities of CDGK, (ii) possible delays in government reform actions to \nimplement the proposed improvements under the capacity building component, and (iii) possible \nlack of cooperation from civil society and nongovernment organizations.  \n \n81.  To mitigate possible delays in project implementation, the Project provides support for TA \nloan management whereby a core team of experts/advisors are to be engaged at the outset of \nthe Project to assist PSU, PWG, and LSU in reviewing and revising the scope of components, \nprioritizing  the  subprojects,  finalizing  the  TORs,  recruiting  consultants  and  evaluating  the \nconsultant outputs.   ", "  19\n \n82.  The  risk  of  delay  in  government  actions  to  implement  the  proposed  reforms  for \norganizational development, revenue enhancement and financial management, corporatization, \nand customer orientation will be mitigated by ADB\u2019s close supervision of implementation. ADB will \nbe  actively  engaged  throughout  the  progress  of  the    capacity  building  subprograms,  and \nespecially regarding those that have policy and sector reform implications. Each subprogram will \nidentify time-bound actions to be taken by GOS and CDGK in the early stages and these will form \nthe content of the policy dialogue between ADB, CDGK and GOS. Moreover, the PSC will \nexercise its considerable clout to ensure timely undertaking of the reform actions.  \n \n83.  Finally, there is an additional risk of poor cooperation from civil society (i.e., NGOs and \ncommunity-based organizations) in implementing the TA loan. ADB will engage actively with the \nprovincial and city governments to effectively address this potential issue through policy dialogue \nand involving nongovernment stakeholders\u2014such as the business community, NGOs, and other \norganizations\u2014in implementing the TA loan.  \n    \n84.  Environmental and Social Safeguard Issues: The TA loan is not expected to have any \nadverse environmental or social impacts in relation to its capacity building and project preparation \nactivities. The TA loan will ensure development of environmentally and socially viable lending and \nnon-lending projects. Projects categorized as follow-on loans will be prepared in compliance with \nADB\u2019s social safeguards policies (on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples).  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES  \n \nA.  Specific Assurances  \n \n85.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \nassurances, which will be incorporated into the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  TA  loan  and  all  its  subprojects  will  be \nprepared in accordance with (i) the Government\u2019s applicable environmental laws \nand regulations, and (b) ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that for subprojects and follow-on loans entailing land \nacquisition  and  resettlement,  resettlement  plans  in  accordance  with  (a)  the \nGovernment\u2019s  applicable  laws  and  policies,  and  (b)  ADB\u2019s  involuntary \nResettlement  Policy  (1995)  are  prepared.9  Adequate  measures  to  avoid  or \nminimize land acquisition and resettlement will be incorporated into subproject \ndesigns. The Government will ensure that necessary mitigation measures will be \nprepared in accordance with (a) the Government\u2019s applicable laws and regulations \nrelated  to  indigenous  peoples,  and  (b)  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples \n(1998),10 and are incorporated into subproject designs. \n(iii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  subproject  feasibility  studies  will  incorporate \ngender strategy to promote full participation of women in subproject preparation \nand implementation and promote equality of treatment between women and men.  \n(iv)  The Government will provide adequate resources and facilities to implement the \nTA  loan  and  all  its  subprojects  effectively  through  the  Executing  Agency  and \nImplementing Agency. \n(v)  Each SU will appoint a competent subproject coordinator, acceptable to ADB, for \nthe  duration  of  the  subproject,  who  will  have  capacities  to  oversee  social, \nresettlement, environmental, and sector aspects of the relevant subproject. \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that all draft final reports of feasibility and advisory \nstudies under the TA loan will be submitted to ADB for review. \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 1995. Involuntary Resettlement. Manila. \n10 ADB. 1998. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples. Manila. \n ", "20   \n(vii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  detailed  TOR  will  be  incorporated  in  each \nconsultant\u2019s engagement and such TOR will have been first approved by ADB.  \n(viii)  Regarding the SFV, the Government will ensure that once it is established and \noperational, the SFV will be an independent, highly competent, and professionally \nrun financial institution that will be operated on commercial principles consistent \nwith  national  and  international  best  practice,  and  the  experience  and  lessons \nprovided by Pakistan\u2019s financial sector reform of the past decade. \n(ix)  The Government will ensure that immediately following incorporation of the SFV, \nthe SFV board of directors (or equivalent body) will approve a business plan, \nstandard operating procedures, conflict of interest, rules and code of conduct for \nstaff and directors acceptable to ADB. \n(ix)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  (a)  time-bound  reform  action  plans  will  be \ndeveloped under the subprograms of capacity building assistance, by January \n2007, and (b) GOS and CDGK will take timely actions to implement the agreed \nreform action plans. \n \nB.

The Government will meet the following conditions before the loan becomes effective.  \n \n(i)  The PSC, under the chair of Minister of Finance, Sindh will be formed. \n(ii)  The PSU in the Executing Agency, the Finance Department of Sindh, will be \nestablished by the GOS, and its Director and key staff will be appointed. \n(iii)  The PWG will be formed under the chair of the District Coordination Officer in \nCDGK.  \n(iv)  The  LSU  will  be  established  by  the  Implementing  Agency,  CDGK,  in  the \nDepartment  of  Finance  and  Planning,  and  its  Director  and  key  staff  will  be \nappointed.  \n \nC.  Condition for Loan Disbursement \n \n87.  The Government will meet the following condition before any disbursement is made: \nProject funds under Part C (except for those funds for training) will only be disbursed once the \nGovernment and ADB reach agreement on the establishment of the SFV upon completion of the \nSFV design under the TA (footnote 7). \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n88.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special \nDrawing  Rights  (SDR7,010,000)  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Mega  City \nDevelopment Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of \n1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the Board.  \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda   \nPresident     \n \n \n10 January 2006 ", "Appendix 1  21   \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved quality of life  City environment and  Federal, provincial and city  \u2022 The Government is \nfor urban residents,  public health improved  government statistics  committed to sustainable \nincluding the poor, and  (percentage increase in  mega city development in \nReports  of  bilateral  and \nenhanced  city population with access  Karachi \nmultilateral  organizations \ncompetitiveness and  to urban services)  \nand NGOs     Risk \nsustained contribution of \nPoverty incidence reduced  \u2022 Delay in project \nKarachi to national \n(percentage increase in  implementation \ndevelopment  \npopulation of katchi abadis   \nwith access to urban \nservices) \nCity productivity increased \n(percentage increase in \nthe contribution of city to \nthe national gross \ndomestic product) \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nEnhanced capacities of  By 2009: Subprograms of  Monitoring against  \u2022 GOS, CDGK, and TMAs \nCDGK and TMAs in city  capacity building facility for  benchmarks on  remain committed to \nplanning, service  mega city planning,  performance of city district  reforms for improved \ndelivery, and financial  organizational  government and other city  governance, efficiency, \nmanagement, along  development, revenue  agencies  and appropriate pricing of \nwith sustainable and  enhancement and financial  services, as well as to \nProject progress reports \nefficient financing of the  management, customer  developing technical, \nmega city infrastructure  orientation,  ADB review missions  managerial, and financial \nand services  commercialization, human  capacities \nProject completion report \ndevelopment  resource development, \nRisk \n  and reactivation of CCBs   \n\u2022 Delay in project \n  to be implemented \nimplementation and the \n \nreform agenda \n \n  By 2006: The  ADB review missions  Assumption \nestablishment of the  \u2022 Continued commitment of \nProject progress reports \nspecialized mega city  federal, provincial, and \nfinancing vehicle (SFV) is  Project completion report  city governments to an \nto be underway  SFV  \n \nRisk \n\u2022 Delay in reforms to \nestablish SFV \n \nIncreased investments  By 2009: Infrastructure  Monitoring against  Assumption \nfor improving and  subprojects prepared  baseline data on  \u2022 Investment projects \nexpanding mega city  under the TA loan are  infrastructure and services  developed under the TA \ninfrastructure and  selected for funding by  under the subprojects and  loan were financed by \nservices  ADB and other donors.  follow-on loans  ADB \n \nEnhanced project  ADB review missions  Risk  \n \npreparation capacity in  \u2022 Delays in preparation of \n  Project progress and \nCDGK  projects \n  completion reports \n   \n   \n \n ", "22    Appendix 1 \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   and Risks  \nOutputs      Assumptions \nPart A     \u2022 High-quality institutional \n1.

The objective of part C is to provide a pool of resources to CDGK to assist in preparing \nfeasibility  study  and  design  of  bankable  projects  for  mega  city  infrastructure  and  services \ninvestments. The project preparation facility is intended to be used as a flexible tool. A number of \npriority projects have already been identified, but their prioritization is expected to be firmed up \nduring  implementation  of  the  TA  loan.  Identification  of  these  subprojects  is  based  on  (i) \nassessment of existing conditions and key constraints to the city\u2019s future growth; (ii) evaluation of \ncity's infrastructure needs1; (iii) assessment of the city\u2019s key constraints and opportunities\u2014at the \npolicy,  strategic  and  operational  levels\u2014identified  in  the  evidence-based  situational  analysis \ncarried out under the small-scale TA; (iv) the proposals contained in the  Karachi revitalization \nscenario supported by  Japan Bank for International Cooperation; and (v) the programs and \nprojects proposed by CDGK and other key stakeholders in the city through (a) the Tameer-e-\nKarachi program and (b) the city\u2019s midterm investment plans as well as national and provincial \ndevelopment frameworks for the mega city. Based on the above exercise and discussions with \nstakeholders while conducting the small-scale TA, the objectives for mega city infrastructure and \nservices development are established as follow:  \n \n(i)  Upgrading and extension of city infrastructure and services to support economic \ndevelopment.  \n(ii)  Improving urban environmental conditions through improved waste management, \nbetter traffic management, the introduction of mass transit systems, and retention \nand enhancement of green open spaces and the coastline. \n(iii)  Increased  sustainability  of  infrastructure  and  services  through  improved  cost \nrecovery for services, leading to better-funded and improved management, operation \nand maintenance of services. \n(iv)  Releasing so-called \u201cdead capital\u201d held by the urban poor, and attracting it towards \nproductive use through the regularization of katchi abadis and improving the access \nof the poor\u2014and particularly those living in katchi abadis\u2014to basic urban services.  \n(v)  Enhancing the resources available to support large-scale infrastructure development \nthrough  attracting  private  sector  resources  in  a  variety  of  public-private  sector \npartnership arrangements as well as promoting commercial financing. \n \n2.  In line with the above objectives and in the absence of some sector master plans, most of \nthe priority projects identified are directed to enhance the utility of existing infrastructure networks. \nThe following provides background to the proposed priority investment projects.  \n \n3.  Water Supply and Sewerage. The KSWB has already received Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  assistance  for  sewerage  and  wastewater  management  improvements,  as  well  as \nassistance from World Bank and Japan Bank for International Cooperation for water supply \nimprovements.  In  addition,  the  Government  is  currently  funding  the  K-III  water  supply \nimprovement project, which will deliver an additional 450,000 cubic meters (some 100 million \ngallons) per day to the water supply network. However, critical system needs remain, the most \nimportant of which are (i) a new master plan for water supply and sewerage to supersede the \nexisting plan that only covered the period up to 2003, (ii) system strengthening to reduce water \nlosses  (50%),  (iii)  augmentation  of  water  treatment  capacity  to  accommodate  the  additional \n450,000 cubic meters per day being delivered to the system under K-III, (iv) rehabilitation of the \nsewerage  system  and  enhancing  utilization  of  existing  wastewater  treatment  plants,  and  (v) \nprovision of additional treatment plant capacity to accommodate at least part of the wastewater \nflow currently being discharged untreated to the marine environment. \n                                                 \n1\n Based on a methodology that related growth in per capita income to the need for enhanced and extended urban \ninfrastructure and service provision, it is estimated that an investment of between $5.0 billion and $1.0 billion (Rs25 \nbillion to 50 billion) per year is required to maintain an adequate stock of infrastructure in Karachi. The current \nrequirement may be higher than the estimate because of the poor state of Karachi's existing infrastructure stock. \n ", "38  Appendix 5 \n4.  Drainage.  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  has  agreed  to  assist  KWSB  in \npreparing a water supply and sewerage master plan for the period to 2025, and this work will be \ncomplemented by the tariff study and the commercialization reforms proposed under the Project. \nKWSB commissioned a study on water loss reduction in 1995, but funding was not forthcoming at \nthat  time.  It  is  proposed  that  the  Project  conduct  a  review  of  these  proposals,  update \nrecommendations, and propose a phased plan for water loss reduction and system strengthening. \nKWSB has recently assumed responsibility for drainage in the city, since most of the wastewater \ngenerated is discharged to the stormwater system. The project will support a feasibility study to \ndetermine the optimal mechanisms for directing wastewater flows currently discharged to the \nstormwater system to the underutilized sewage treatment plants. The project will also update the \nexisting concepts, preliminary designs, and feasibility study for the Korangi sewer rehabilitation \nand sewage treatment plant project, which was previously prepared as a prospective project for \nADB funding.  \n \n5.  Solid Waste Management. While the TMAs have responsibility for collecting solid waste \nfrom  households  and  its  delivery  to  points  of  disposal,  only  about  25%  of  the  solid  waste \ngenerated is disposed of to one of the approved disposal sites. The Government has decided on \na system of garbage transfer stations and the Project will support feasibility studies for the \nlocation and design of such facilities based on the pilot project funded under the Government \nprogram. This study will also investigate the preferred location and feasibility of a landfill facility for \nthe city, and it will develop mechanisms for funding through private-public partnership \u2013 preferably \nadopting a design-build-operate modality.   \n \n6.  Roads and Transport System. Lastly, the roads and transport system in Karachi are \ncoming under increasing stress, as private vehicle use is growing dramatically while there are few \nsigns that significant private investment will be attracted to support mass transport systems in the \nimmediate term. The project will initially support feasibility study for the proposed Malir River bund \nexpressway, which will ease congestion on the Shara-Faisal and provide an important new link \nbetween the city center and the superhighway. The project will also support advisory assistance \nto the mass transit cell of CDGK to help in determining the optimal approach for developing an \nintegrated mass transit system and attracting private capital to join in partnership with government \nin developing mass transit systems for the city. Considering that urban transport is one of the \nlargest sources of air pollution in Karachi, interventions in the urban transport sector will also \nincorporate components for air pollution control and air quality management. \n \nTable A5.1: C0 \u2013 Study on Water Supply and Sewerage System \n \nTitle  Study on Master Plan for Water Supply and Sewerage System in Karachi \nRationale and  Following a request from the Government of Pakistan, the Government of Japan, through Japan \nScope  International Cooperation Agency, has agreed to undertake a study on the water supply and \nsewerage system in Karachi. The study aims to (i) formulate a master plan for improving water \nsupply and the sewerage system for Karachi to the target year of 2025, (ii) conduct a feasibility \nstudy for the priority projects selected in the master plan, and (iii) pursue technology transfer to \nthe Pakistani counterpart personnel in the course of the study. The study area will be limited to \nthe Karachi City District comprising 18 towns plus areas for raw water sources and their \nconveyance routes to the city. \nTiming  Consulting requirements have yet to be determined by Japan International Cooperation Agency. \nExpected start date of consulting services is in October 2005 and with a duration of 24 months. \nOutputs  A master plan for improving water supply and sewerage system for the Karachi City to the target \nyear of 2025, a feasibility study for the priority projects selected in the master plan, and training \nand technology transfer to the Pakistani counterpart personnel. \nFund Modality  Bilateral grant \nExecuting Agency  Japan International Cooperation Agency \nCost ($)  (Estimated at $10 million) \nNote: Excluded from detailed cost estimates in Appendix 9, as this is an ongoing project funded by Japan International \nCooperation Agency. \nSources: Loan Fact Finding Mission (2005) and ADB. 2005.

Since this study, there have \nbeen changes in the water supply situation and network, and investments are now being \nimplemented that will increase the water supplied to the network by 450,000 cubic meters per \nday. This will have further implications on the nature, extent and magnitude of losses. The City \nnow wishes to update the study to reduce UFW and improve overall water supplies, and to \nreview, update and finalize the system strengthening package in light of events since the 1999 \nstudy and the impact of the current K-III project under implementation.  \nScope  Verify and update the basic information used in the previous study and the water loss reduction \nstrategy, water loss reduction program, system strengthening works, costs, and the technical, \nsocial and environmental feasibility of the Project. Poverty, gender equity, indigenous peoples, \nand other social and environmental concerns will be considered. \nConsulting  An engineering consulting firm experienced in urban water supply engineering and loss \nRequirements and  reduction is required to assist KWSB with updating the previous study. The proposed \nExpected Timing  consultancy should be completed within 3 calendar months and begin in 2006.

The \nProject did not come to fruition, however, due to (i) objections to the concept by nongovernment \norganizations (caused by poor public consultation) and (ii) KWSB\u2019s poor financial performance  \nand reluctance by the Government of Sindh  to take on the loan. In the meantime, the volume of \nwastewater flow in the past 8 years has increased in line with the escalating population and \nindustrial and commercial activity in Korangi. Fortunately, some elements of the proposed \nproject\u2014notably the long-term planning for the sewerage network\u2014have now been taken on by \nother donors (Japan International Cooperation Agency). Nevertheless, ongoing work in the \nsector remains inadequate to address the growing problems facing KWSB. Thus, there remains \nan urgent need to revive the proposed project in order to (i) provide additional sewage treatment \ncapacity to prevent continued discharge of raw sewage to the aquatic and marine environment \nin the Malir River and Girzi Creek, (ii) rehabilitate and extend the sewerage network in the \nLandhi and Korangi areas to collect wastewater, (iii) construct an interceptor sewer to convey \nwastewater from the Landhi/Korangi network to the sewerage treatment plant, and (iv) \ninvestigate the opportunities for private sector involvement in wastewater recycling and reuse \nfor agricultural or industrial purposes. \nScope  Review the feasibility study and design of the wastewater collection and sewage treatment \nproject for Korangi and Landhi (Korangi Wastewater Management Project \u2013 PAK 1539 ). This \nproject was the highest priority investment based on the 1990\u20132000 sewerage master plan. The \nstudy would review the prioritization assumptions made in this master plan, and the proposals \nsubsequently made under the Korangi project, with a view to verifying the assumptions made \nand conclusions reached. The study would provide a revalidated feasibility study for the Project, \nin the light of changes made since 1997, and provide updated analysis, plans, costs and project \npackaging information. \nConsulting  Beginning in 2006, 4 person-months of international and 15 person-months of domestic \nRequirements and  consulting services with expertise in wastewater engineering, private sector participation, \nExpected Timing  financial analysis/economics, environment, social development, and surveying will be required. \nOutputs  By the completion of this study, the KWSB will have: \n(i)  a revised set of preliminary engineering drawings and project costings; \n(ii)  a fully revised feasibility study for the proposed project, setting out costs, benefits, likely \nimpact, and a clear implementation action plan; \n(iii)  updated environmental and social impact assessments; and \n(iv)  a clear assessment of the opportunities\u2014and recommendations\u2014 for private sector \ninvolvement in the recycling of wastewater for industrial or agricultural use. \nFund Modality  Asian Development Bank technical assistance loan \nExecuting Agency  City District Government of Karachi, Karachi Water and Sewerage Board  \nCost ($)  210,000 \nSources: Loan Fact Finding Mission (2005) and ADB. 2005.

The \nprogram  would  provide  an  urban  public  transport  system  that  is  fast,  frequent,  reliable, \ncomfortable, safe, and affordable to the general public. It should afford its operators the \nopportunity to make money and a reasonable return on their investment while reducing the \nenvironmental problems currently caused by the aging bus fleet. \n \nScope  The following activities will be conducted under this project:  (i) a critical review of the 1991 \nmass transit network proposal and development of a strategy and action plan to fund and \nimplement the priority elements of this network, (ii) dissemination of information on the plans \nand obtaining of government and public support for the proposals, (iii) completion of work to \nensure  that  the  plans  meet  Government  and  Asia  Development  Bank\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental safeguard requirements, and (iv) development of a strategy for implementing the \nmass transit network under a private-public partnership modality. The consultants will be \nresponsible for delivering a strategy and action plan for the proposed network. The strategy will \nincorporate requirements for capacity development in planning and regulation. It will also \npropose measures for air pollution control and air quality management as part of mass transit \nstrategy. The consultants will work under the overall guidance of the Karachi Mass Transit Cell \nof the City District Government of Karachi and in close collaboration with the Government of \nSindh on regulatory matters. They also will collaborate with Mass Transit Cell consultants and \nJapan International Cooperation Agency, who will be undertaking a transportation study for the \ngreater Karachi area.  \n \nConsulting  The project will be undertaken over a period of 10 months, commencing sometime in the 3rd \nRequirements and  quarter of 2007. Consultant inputs include 18 person-months of foreign consultants and 42 \nExpected Timing  person-months of local consultants (or their equivalent). \n \nOutputs  The following reports will be provided under the Project: \n(i)  a strategy for mass transit development,  \n(ii)  an updated feasibility study for the entire system, \n(iii)  a report on priority corridors that is updated to provide a 20-year design horizon, \n(iv)  a report on stakeholder and public consultation (1st of 2), \n(v)  a detailed feasibility report on two priority corridors, \n(vi)  a report on stakeholder and public consultation (2nd of 2), \n(vii)  a Karachi Mass Transit implementation plan, \n(viii)  reports on social and environmental safeguards, \n(ix)  a resettlement action plan (as necessary), \n(x)  two sets of information memoranda for investors, and \n(xi)  the final report. \n \n ", "Appendix 5  43 \nFund Modality  Asian Development Bank technical assistance loan \nExecuting Agency  City District Government of Karachi, Mass Transit Cell  \nCost ($)  0.730 million    \nSources: Loan Fact Finding Mission (2005) and ADB. 2005.

Only 539 were listed in 1986 for \nregularization and upgrading. Over the last 20 years, just 284 out of 539 listed katchi abadis \nwere notified (2.5% per year) for regularization, and around 45% of dwelling units in the notified \nkatchi abadis were granted lease rights. The current backlog is around 750 settlements \ncomprising over half a million dwelling units. The size and number of katchi abadis is estimated \nto be growing at 10% per year. To develop the metropolis as a city without slums, a program \nthat would facilitate and accelerate the notification, regularization and upgrading of katchi \nabadis needs to be implemented. It is also necessary to develop strategies and innovative \nredevelopment schemes for those katchi abadis which cannot benefit from in situ upgrading.    \nScope  The project will assist in mobilizing the City District Government of Karachi (CDGK), the \nprovincial directorate of katchi abadis, the town municipal administrations, the katchi abadis \ncitizen  community  boards  (CCBs),  and  nongovernment  organizations  in  accelerating  the \nregularization and upgradation process while creating public support for the Government\u2019s drive \nto develop Karachi as a \u201cCity Without Slums.\u201d The emphasis will be on implementing projects \nthat involve low capital and operating costs but potentially high benefits, as measured by \neconomic, social, and environmental indicators as well as community engagement. The in situ \nupgrading activity will revolve around five themes: awareness, capacity building, facilitation, \nmobilization, and coordination. The scope will also include developing strategies for innovative \nredevelopment schemes and increasing access by the poor to land, services, and finance. \nConsulting  It is proposed that a foreign consultant/advisor with extensive experience in community-based \nRequirements and  projects to improve urban environmental services, quality of life, and the livelihoods of the poor \nExpected Timing  and other vulnerable groups will provide advice and oversight on the Project over a period of \n2 months. The initial reconnaissance survey of katchi abadis will require 12 months of local \nconsulting together  with support costs. The identification, preparation, establishment, and \nmonitoring of pilot projects is estimated to require 20 months of consulting. The project is \nexpected to commence in 2007 and extend to 2008 on an intermittent basis. \nOutputs  A reconnaissance survey of all existing katchi abadis; a capacity building program for relevant \nCDGK departments that will be involved in upgrading katchi abadis; developed universal, \nsimplified, and decentralized pro-poor procedures for grant of lease; a campaign to establish \nCCBs; and a strategy (probably including innovative schemes) with potential to be replicated for \nthose katchi abadis that cannot benefit from in situ upgrading. \nFund Modality  Asian Development Bank technical assistance loan \nExecuting Agency  City District Government of Karachi  \nCost ($)  765,000 \nSources: Loan Fact Finding Mission (2005) and ADB. 2005.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?        No  priority in country poverty partnership    No \nagreement?   \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan: \n \nThe Government of Pakistan developed a comprehensive poverty reduction strategy for accelerating growth and \nreducing poverty. The strategy is based on six principles: (i) broad-based participation of stakeholders, (ii) focusing \non monitorable outcomes that benefit the poor, (iii) recognition of poverty\u2019s multi-dimensional nature, (iv) flexible \nimplementation in fiscal and institutional terms, (v) private-public partnership, and (vi) emphasis on the millennium \ndevelopment goals. The strategy rests on four pillars: (i) achieving high and broad-based economic growth while \nmaintaining macroeconomic stability; (ii) improving governance, consolidating devolution, and ensuring social and \neconomic justice; (iii) investing in human capital; and (iv) bringing the poor, vulnerable and backward regions into \nthe mainstream of development, and to make marked progress in reducing existing inequalities. The poverty \nreduction partnership agreement signed by the Government of Pakistan and Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nreflects the above goals and principles and commits to reducing poverty by broadening community participation \nand opportunities for the poor during the next 5 years. The technical assistance (TA) loan project contributes to \nand reinforces the above priorities by its project preparation facility, which makes funds available for preparing \nprojects for mega city infrastructure and services resulting in an improved quality of life and public health for all city \nresidents, including the poor. Priority subprojects, identified for feasibility studies, include upgrading of the informal \nsettlements known as katchi abadis that will have a direct impact on reducing poverty. The TA loan also supports \nADB\u2019s and the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy through its capacity building facility that includes in its \nscope a number of programs highly relevant to the above principles. Among these are (i) an organizational \ndevelopment program that intends to enhance the effectiveness of the devolution in the City District Government of \nKarachi (CDGK), and (ii) reactivation of citizen community boards (CCBs) that aims to promote community-public \npartnership  in  infrastructure  development  and  broad-based  participation  of  the  stakeholders  in  mega  city \nmanagement. Finally, the TA loan contributes to sustainable economic growth by establishing and implementing a \nspecialized financing vehicle that will promote sustainable financing of mega city development. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nApproximately 50% of the total 12.5 million population of Karachi metropolis live below the poverty line. Another \n8.5% are living above the poverty line but are vulnerable to shocks. The incidence of poverty varies between 40% \nand 57% in 18 towns and cantonment areas within the metropolis. Evidence confirms the large disparity in the \nincidence of poverty in developed city areas, at 40%, compared to the 89% occurring in the katchi abadis. Further \nanalysis, however, shows that the proportion of the population living below the poverty line in all cantonments is \n40%, followed by 44% in planned and business oriented areas. It is slightly higher (at 46%) in middle class \nresidential towns. The highest incidence of poverty is reported in those towns dominated by the working class and \nkatchi abadis (such as 57% in Orangi Town, 53% in Gadap and Landhi Towns, and 52% in Malir Town).   \n \nOver 1,000 katchi abadis account for more than 40% of Karachi total population. A poverty assessment conducted \nunder the small-scale technical assistance to prepare the TA loan indicates that overall 89% of the population in \nthese settlements is living below poverty line. Based on the per capita income levels and the quintile divisions set \nby the Government, 54% of these people are at chronic poverty levels, around 35% are transitory poor, and 11% \nare in the category of transitory vulnerable. That leaves none in the category of nonpoor. The majority of katchi \nabadis are excluded from social services and the safety net and have to spent significant amounts of their incomes \nto purchase water that contributes to further impoverishment. It is therefore safe to assume that the entire \npopulation living in katchi abadis is living below the poverty line. The assessment reveals that urban poverty is \ncharacterized by (i) lack of permanent occupation; (ii) insufficient and irregular income; (iii) limited access to \neducation and health care; (iv) deficiency of such basic infrastructure and services as roads, sanitation, and solid \nwaste collection and disposal systems; (v) inadequate nonfarm employment opportunities; and (vi) lack of secure \nownership tenure of productive assets. Conditions are unhygienic; water- and feces-borne diseases are highly \nprevalent. This undermines health and income-earning opportunities. In most cases, physical and social exclusion \nact together, resulting in a perpetual cycle of poverty. The poverty assessment indicates that the poor in these \nkatchi abadis unanimously prioritize the lack of basic infrastructure and services and low incomes as the most \nsevere problems that need to be addressed.    \n ", "Appendix 6  45\nThe TA loan is expected to contribute significantly to poverty reduction by prioritizing subprojects addressing the \nphysical  and  social  barriers  adversely  affecting  the  urban  poor  in  Karachi.  The  specific  features  of  these \nsubprojects include (i) regularization of katchi abadis to provide security of tenure of the land and houses where \nthe poor live; (ii) upgrading of settlements by providing infrastructure, including proper water and sanitation \nfacilities;  and  (iii)  promoting  participatory  development  and  public  and  community  partnership  in  upgrading \nsettlements by activating citizen community boards (CCBs).  \n \nThe poverty impact analysis shows that the regularization/security of tenure will directly impact the poor residents \nby relieving them from the stress of living under illegal land occupation and possible eviction. It will increase not \nonly the value of assets but also the confidence level that one is truly a resident of the mega city. Improvements in \ninfrastructure and amenities will directly improve the living environment and health conditions of an estimated 40% \nof the city population. \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                 No \n \nA stakeholder analysis was conducted during the small-scale technical assistance to identify stakeholders as well \nas their roles, interests, preferences, and aspirations. The primary stakeholders are the residents, business \ncommunity, and the poor of the mega city. These primary stakeholders will benefit either directly or indirectly from \nTA  loan  interventions,  especially  through  (i)  the  investment  projects  whose  feasibility  and  design  will  be \nundertaken under the project preparation facility, and (ii) improved service delivery capacities of the CDGK and \nother city agencies resulting from the TA loan\u2019s capacity building facility.  \n \nSecondary stakeholders include the elected and appointed officials of the provincial (Sindh) and city district \n(Karachi) governments, as well as town municipal administrations, and utility agencies that will be both key players \nin the TA loan implementation as well as the primary recipients of some subprojects under the capacity building \nfacility. All these stakeholders were consulted while preparing the TA loan, and they demonstrated much interest in \nand support for the Project. The inputs solicited from these stakeholders were incorporated into the TA loan \ndesign. Another group of secondary stakeholders are the representatives of the federal government who indicated \ntheir strong support and provided feedback with regard to the TA loan design.  \n \nStakeholders consulted during implementation of the small-scale TA and processing of the TA loan also include \nrepresentatives of the finance and banking sector, who unanimously supported and provided their input into the TA \nloan intervention for establishment of a specialized financing vehicle for the Karachi mega city. Private sector \nrepresentatives who are likely to be engaged in some urban infrastructure and service provision activities during \nthe follow-on loans phase also expressed their willingness to be involved in the Project. \n \nThe  TA  loan  design  involved  the  participation  of  primary  and  secondary  stakeholders.  Participation  of  the \nstakeholders in the implementation will be ensured through incorporating participation strategy into the design of \neach subproject. The participation strategies will (i) ensure that the improvements are responsive to the demands \nof city residents, including households, businesses and the poor; and (ii) develop in the mega city a sense of \nownership  of  the  TA  loan  interventions,  thereby  strengthening  sustainability.  Secondary  stakeholders  will \nparticipate through the project implementation structures (i.e., the executing agency, project steering committee, \nlocal support unit, and project working group) that will involve key agencies at the provincial level as well as \nCDGK\u2019s departments and utilities. \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nGiven the dominant role of women in household management, women are expected to be the primary recipients of \nbenefits from the ensuing follow-on loans for mega city infrastructure and service improvements, especially \nimprovements in the water supply, sanitation, and solid waste management. They will be a major target group for \nthe katchi abadis regularization and upgrading, as well as for vitalization of the citizen community boards. Gender \nanalysis and strategy will be parts of the feasibility studies of subprojects. Strategies developed under the \nsubprojects will incorporate measures to promote full participation of women in project activities\u2014including in \nproject planning and implementation.  \nHas an output been prepared?

The following terms of reference are to be the basis for a parallel technical assistance (TA) \nseparate from this project and are provided for information only. \n \nA.  Background  \n \n2.  A small-scale TA,1 which made a preliminary assessment for a specialized financing vehicle \n(SFV), analyzed the positive and negative factors that influence the establishment and operation of \nthe  SFV  in  the  context  of  Pakistan  and  Karachi,  and  it  presented  a  number  of  options  for \nconsideration by the Government of Pakistan, Government of Sindh, City District Government of \nKarachi (CDGK), and Asian Development Bank (ADB). The options included (i) a totally new and \nspecialized for-profit financing vehicle that would be (largely) independent from government; (ii) \nlocating  an  urban  infrastructure  financing  unit  within  an  existing  government-owned  financial \ninstitution (bank or development finance institution) or privately owned financial institution (FI); (iii) \nlocating a specialized for-profit financing vehicle within a nonbank development corporation, such \nas  the  District  Financing  Vehicle  hosted  by  the  Shanghai  Chengtou  Corporation;  and  (iv) \nestablishing a totally new, government-owned, nonprofit SFV similar to US bond banks, Canadian \nmunicipal financing corporations, the Tamil Nadu Urban Development Fund, and other municipal \ndevelopment funds established in many industrialized and developing countries. Each option would \nhave its strengths and weaknesses. At the same time, when appropriately designed, resourced, \nand managed, each option would provide broadly similar financial services.  \n \n3.  These findings created a strong interest among senior government officials and existing \nfinancial intermediaries in the concept of a nongovernment urban infrastructure financing vehicle \nthat could develop the market for commercial lending and private financing of urban infrastructure \nin Karachi and Sindh. This interest was confirmed during the TA loan Fact-Finding Mission in late \nAugust and early September 2005 in meetings held first in Islamabad with senior officials from all \nthree levels of government and then in separate meetings in Karachi with senior officials of the \nCDGK and the Sindh Provincial Government. Agreeing in principle with the SFV concept, as an \ninnovative financing model needed to replace unsuccessful traditional financing models for urban \ninfrastructure financing, these meetings urged a fast-track process for a feasibility and design study \nfor the SFV. Placing such a study under a separate TA grant to be started as quickly as possible \nwould be supported and appreciated by all three levels of government, and would provide a strong \nsignal  of  ADB\u2019s  strong  commitment  to  urban  infrastructure  development  in  the  mega  city  of \nKarachi. \n \n4.  There was also some consensus on many of the overall (or conceptual) design features of \nthe  SFV.  The  SFV  would  be  an  independent,  highly  competent,  professionally  run,  financial \ninstitution that operates on commercial principles and consistent with national and international \nbest practice. Also envisaged was a limited company structure under the oversight of the Province \nof Sindh (most likely its Finance Department) and with a long-term business strategy. \n \n5.  The mandate and scope for the SFV were considered to include (i) possible coverage of all \ncities in Sindh, (ii) a large number of infrastructure sectors, and (iii) channeling funds to borrowers \nnot only through ADB on-lending but also in the future from other international finance institutions \n(IFIs), bilateral donors, government programs, domestic and international commercial lenders, and \nthe  capital  markets.  Senior  officials  stressed  the  need  for  the  SFV  to  be  very  active  in \n(i) establishing, developing and expanding the market for commercial lending and private financing \nof urban infrastructure, (ii) providing technical and capacity building advice and assistance through \nworking with potential borrowers to prepare bankable projects and to place their operations on a \n                                                 \n1\n  ADB. 2005.

The SFV is therefore envisaged as introducing and \npromoting a fully commercial, customer-oriented approach to the financing, management, and \noperation of urban infrastructure facilities in Karachi and Sindh.  \n \n6.  There was full agreement that the effectiveness and success of the SFV would depend on \n(i) bankable projects from worthy borrowers that have the legal mandate and financial resources to \nborrow and to repay their loans, and (ii) the quality of the SFV\u2019s president, and other management \nstaff. The latter necessitates that there will be a high-quality staffing plan that is not constrained by \nnormal Government staffing, recruitment and remuneration rules. Recruitment from the private \nsector was considered essential.  \n \n7.  Of the options presented under the small-scale TA, many senior officials viewed option 4 as \na good starting point. This option suggests an SFV ownership and equity structure involving all \nthree levels of government, as well as perhaps ADB and other IFIs, nongovernment financial \nintermediaries, and private sources. All equity contributors would be represented on the board of \ndirectors, and other members with strong professional expertise and FI experience could also be \nconsidered. Some officials stressed in particular the need at the very outset for participation from \nthe private sector and existing financial institutions in the forms of board membership, a small \nequity  contribution,  and  technical  assistance  with  preparing  projects,  structuring  deals  and \nmonitoring funded projects.  \n \n8.  Many officials also suggested a phased approach, with the Karachi SFV moving from an \noption 4 model towards an option 1 model (i.e., a for-profit intermediary that is largely independent \nfrom government). It was generally felt that this transition should be much more rapid than has \nbeen  the  case  for  India\u2019s  Tamil  Nadu  Urban  Development  Fund.  Replication  of  the  SFV  or \nextension  of  its  mandate  to  other  Pakistan  provinces  and  the  country  as  a  whole  was  also \nconsidered feasible, depending upon its performance in Karachi and Sindh. In the final analysis \nhowever, it was recognized that major decisions on the features and design of the SFV should be \nmade as part of a feasibility and design study. \n \n9.  In the following terms of reference, the first five tasks will complete the analysis begun \nunder the small-scale TA, while the remaining tasks will complete the full financial feasibility and \nmarket acceptance analysis as well as the design of the SFV.  \n \nB.  Terms of Reference Tasks in Two Phases \n \n1.  Phase One: Identification and Preparation of Preliminary Design \n \n10.  Phase One will be dedicated to completion of feasibility and identification and preparation of \npreliminary design of the SFV. More specifically, Phase One will undertake the following tasks:  \n \n(i)  Complete and update the analysis of the economic, financial market, and related \nconditions and trends important to the feasibility of the SFV that has begun in the \nsmall-scale TA report.

These should \nthen be ready-to-implement projects in case the SFV is approved and commences \nlending operations. \n \n(ix)  In selecting the detailed design team from the partner, ensure  significant local \nexpertise in financial intermediaries, infrastructure and project financing and related \nareas so that the detailed SFV design benefits as much as possible from these \nexpertise. \n  \n2.  Phase  Two:  Completion  of  Detailed  Design  and  Documentation  Needed  to \nEstablish SFV  \n \n11.  Phase Two will focus on completing the detailed design and documentation needed to \nestablish the SFV. \n \n(i)  Based on the suggested preliminary design, complete the analysis of the urban \ninfrastructure  market\u2019s  demand  for  commercial  loans,  technical  assistance, \nmonitoring, financial intermediation, financing coordination, syndication and other \nservices that would be provided by the SFV. Demand analysis should include a \nyearly breakdown of the loans and other transactions expected to be made over a \n10-year period (divided by infrastructure sector, major borrowers and other criteria). \n \n(ii)  Develop a marketing plan to target the market demand, to make potential borrowers \nand project entities aware of the technical and financial services available from the \nSFV, and to build awareness of the need for commercial operating principles in \nurban infrastructure utilities in order to ensure sustainable access to financing. \n  \n(iii)  Project the initial capital injection needed to establish the SFV\u2019s start-up capital \nstructure (the amount and source likely will depend upon the preliminary design that \nis selected)4 as well as the financial resources to be made available to the SFV \nthrough time (perhaps over the first 10 years) from governments (e.g., seed money \nto support start-up), ADB (through loan money, perhaps equity from its Private \nSector Operations Department, and perhaps its partial guarantee facility), other \ninternational  financial  institutions,  and  from  domestic  and  international  capital \nmarkets (including both loans and equity, if appropriate). \n \n(iv)  Identify, analyze and place monetary values on the remuneration costs (wages plus \nbenefits) of the professional, technical, support, and other staff requirements for the \nSFV and the other administration costs that will be incurred. Evaluate to the extent \npossible what will be the availability of the needed personnel when the SFV is \nestablished. \n \n(v)  Estimate the interest rates, on-lending fees, technical assistance5 and other fees \nthat  need  to  be  charged  to  make  the  SFV  self-sustaining  and  (if  appropriate) \n                                                 \n4 It is assumed at this time that the initial equity could be domestic. Consultations during the Fact-Finding Mission \nindicated that equity contributions could be made by the three levels of government, from one or more existing FIs and \nfrom other nongovernment, private sector sources. However, depending on the final design, ADB\u2019s Private Sector \nOperations Department or the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank could provide a portion of the \nstart-up equity, particularly if the SFV\u2019s mandate places major emphasis on attracting private investment and public-\nprivate investment. \n5 Technical assistance fees for project preparation could be earned through, for example, including these costs in the \nbudgets for high-priority projects and recovering these costs from ADB loan proceeds. \n ", "Appendix 7   51 \nprofitable to its shareholders. Ensure that the market and potential borrowers can \naccommodate (i.e., are prepared to pay) those fees and interest rates, making \nadjustments in payrolls and other costs, as may be necessary, to achieve such fees \nand rates. Prepare a spreadsheet-based financial model for the SFV incorporating \nthe aforementioned projected revenues and costs. Prepare sensitivity scenarios for \nthe financial model based on realistic scenarios. \n \n(vi)  Identify  the  key  risks  and  uncertainties  (including  foreign  exchange,  credit \n[nonperforming loans] and political, event risks) that could threaten the sustainability \nand profitability of the SFV, and develop strategies for addressing them. Assess the \npotential for a phased strategy for implementing the SFV business plan (described \nbelow), whereby less complex and risky services and products might be launched \nearlier and more complicated and risky services, products, and functions could be \nprovided over time as the SFV built a credible track record, demonstrated growing \ncompetence, as well as greater visibility and acceptance in the market. \n   \n(vii)  Prepare and finalize the business case (rationale, concept, approach, major benefits \nand beneficiaries), business plan, and long-term strategy for the SFV. The business \ncase should outline the vision, mission, purpose, and overall rationale for the SFV, \nas well as its ownership, legal and taxation status, and its managerial structure. This \ntask should undertake a review of the SFV\u2019s proposed role and responsibilities from \nthe perspective of city government functions (a) to ensure a clear segregation of \nduties, (b) to reduce the likelihood of overlap, and (c) to ensure that accountability of \nlocal government officials to deliver services is not obviated. The business plan \nshould include a full set of financial projections (income statement, cash flow, and \nbalance sheet).     \n \n(viii)  The business plan and long-term strategy should also include suggested phasing of \nSFV  functions.  For  example:  (a)  establishing  SFV  capabilities,  experience  and \nmarket  credibility  through  on-lending  of  ADB  and  other  IFI  funds  to  urban \ninfrastructure projects, leading to (b)  provision of other financial products and other \nforms  of  debt  and  (eventually)  equity  financing,  (c)  tapping  the  national  and \ninternational  capital  markets,  (d)  conducting  innovative  transactions  such  as \npublic-private  partnerships,  100%  private  sector  infrastructure  projects,  funding \nstate-owned  enterprises  operating  on  commercial  principles  or  moving  toward \nlistings on the capital markets, and acquisition financing. \n \n(ix)  Prepare the human resource development and capacity building strategy for the \nSFV,  including  the  professional,  technical,  and  support  skills  needed.  It  should \ninclude also recruitment policies and strategies, in-house and institutional training, \nand  other  human  resource  measures.  This  should  cover  the  capacity  building \nneeded to make the SFV a success, and wage and other compensation packages \nneeded to recruit and retain highly qualified and motivated personnel at all levels of \nthe organization. Capacity building in human resource development will need to \ninclude building understanding of (a) the requirements and procedures of ADB and \nother IFIs (financial, social, poverty, environmental, etc.); (b) the special financing \nrequirements of urban infrastructure projects; (c) the factors required to assist in \npreparing infrastructure projects to bankable standards; (d) marketing skills to make \nSFV products and services attractive to local governments, utilities, and potential \nborrowers on commercial lending terms; and (e) post-transaction monitoring and \nevaluation requirements.  \n \n(x)  Prepare a detailed operations manual for SFV management and staff\u2014as well as \nfor its shareholders, directors and others\u2014designed to guide the practices and \n ", "52  Appendix 7 \nprocedures of the SFV during its initial period of one to two years. The manual \nshould outline  \n(a)  the vision, mission, and purpose of the SFV;  \n(b)  what the SFV does: the financial products and services it provides, its \ninitial  and  near-future  sources  of  funds,  investment  financing \noperations, its services (in arranging financing, providing technical \nassistance, and training) to clients, eligible recipients and sectors, \neligible uses of funds, and so on;  \n(c)  how the SFV operates (including marketing, project identification and \nprescreening,  project  appraisal,  credit  assessment  methods, \npost-transaction monitoring and evaluation, other lending policies and \nprocedures, public awareness, and project procurement. if relevant);  \n(d)  how the SFV prices its financial products and services;  \n(e)  how it is managed and decisions are made; and  \n(f)  how  the  SFV  addresses  the  social,  poverty,  environmental, \neconomic, and other objectives that are important to ADB and other \nIFIs and bilateral donors, as well as being increasingly important to \ndomestic  and  international  investors  that  could  provide  debt  and \nequity financing to the SFV in the future. \n \n(xi)  Prepare  with  counterpart  staff  from  both  parties  the  draft  memorandum  of \nunderstanding between the SFV and the government agency identified for oversight \nof  the  proposed  SFV.  This  should  include  (a)  the  roles,  responsibilities  and \nobligations of each party; and (b) the SFV\u2019s objectives and functions (the operations \nmanual could be an annex to the memorandum of understanding) and the criteria \nand  indicators  to  be  used  to  measure  objectives  achievement  (including  e.g., \nfeedback from clients, investors and the general public).  \n \n(xii)   Establish with counterpart staff from both parties the monitoring and evaluation \nframework for measuring the SFV\u2019s progress towards achieving its objectives, and \nthe reporting systems and relationships between the two parties. Describe as well \nthe  roles,  responsibilities,  functions,  and  reporting  requirements  of  existing \nregulators  in  the  areas  of  (e.g.,  banking,  securities,  company,  competition  and \nconsumer  protection  law  (their  relevance  and  weights  would  depend  on  the \npreferred  design)  and  ensure  that  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  framework \nestablished  for  SFV  will  be  consistent  with  and  supportive  of  the  statutory \nrequirements under existing regulatory regimes.     \n \nC.
