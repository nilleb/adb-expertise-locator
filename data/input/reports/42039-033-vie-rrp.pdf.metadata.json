It  will  (i)  expand  the \nelectricity  transmission  infrastructure  by  constructing  and  upgrading  500  kilovolt  (kV)  and  220 \nkV transmission lines and associated substations, (ii) improve the operational effectiveness and \nefficiency of the National Power Transmission Corporation, and (iii) support the implementation \nof the investment program.2  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n1. \n\nSocioeconomic Context \n\n3. \nViet  Nam\u2019s rapid development  has  been  accompanied  by  steadily  growing  demand for \nelectricity  for  both  industrial  development  and  private  consumption.  Consumption  grew  by  an \naverage  of  14%  annually  during  2004\u20132010,  substantially  surpassing  the  average  economic \ngrowth rate of 7% per year  in the same period. Demand for electricity is expected to continue \ngrowing  by  an  average  of  14%  per  year  during  2011\u20132015  and  11%  during  2016\u20132020.  It  is \nprojected  that  electricity  consumption  will  increase  from  85,932  gigawatt-hours  in  2010  to \n251,763 gigawatt-hours in 2020.  \n \n4. \nIndustry  consumes  52%  of  electricity,  residential  consumers  39%,  service  businesses \n8%,  and  agriculture  1%.  While  industry  is  the  largest  electricity  consumer,  it  is  also  the  most \nimportant sector economically, projected by 2015 to account for 41% of gross domestic product, \n29%  of  the  workforce,  and  87%  of  export  revenues.  Ensuring  reliable  electricity  supply  is \ntherefore  an  important  prerequisite  to  sustaining  economic  growth  at  the  target  of  7.5%\u20138.0% \nper year.  \n \nViet  Nam  has  made  remarkable  progress  in  expanding  access  to  electricity,  as  the \n5. \npercentage  of  households without  electricity  fell  from  22%  in  1999  to  only  3%  in 2010.  Those \ncommunities that are not yet connected to the grid are mainly in the less-developed and rather \nsparsely populated mountainous areas of the northwest.  Per capita income reached $1,168 in \n2010, and the poverty rate fell to 14.2%. The high concentration of industrial parks and general \neconomic development induce many people to migrate to the centers of dynamic development \nand  employment  opportunities  in  the  southeast,  Central  Highlands,  and  Red  River  Delta. \nWithout  additional  generation  capacity  and  transmission  network  expansion,  the  main  load \ncenters  in  these  regions  are  expected  to  suffer  a  worsening  electricity  supply  deficit  and  the \nshare  of  urban  and  rural  populations  without  electricity  is  expected  to  increase,  in  particular \namong populations with lower income and electricity consumption.   \n \n\n2. \n\nInstitutional Arrangements \n\n6. \nInstitutional arrangements. The Ministry of Industry and Trade guides and supervises \nthe development of the power sector. Its responsibilities include formulating legal and regulatory \n\n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2010. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing the \nPower Transmission Investment Program. Manila.  \n\n\f2 \n\nreforms  and  mechanisms  for  establishing  a  competitive  and  financially  sustainable  power \nmarket. It needs to coordinate closely with the Ministry of Planning and Investment, Ministry of \nFinance,  and  State  Bank  of  Vietnam  to  develop  policies  and  financial  mechanisms  to  attract \nforeign  investment  and  official  development  assistance,  as  well  as  increase  the  self-financing \ncapacity  of  power  sector  entities,  to  meet  the  funding  requirements  of  the  rapidly  expanding \npower sector.  \n \n7. \nVietnam  Electricity  (EVN),  the  country\u2019s  national  power  utility,  is  mainly  responsible  for \nundertaking  investments  in,  and  managing  the  operation  of,  assigned  electricity-generating \nprojects.  The  National  Power  Transmission  Corporation  (NPT)  was  established  in  2008  as  a \ncompany wholly owned by EVN. NPT is responsible for investment in and the management and \noperation  of  500  kilovolt  (kV)  and  220 kV  transmission  lines  and  associated  substations.  NPT \nconsists  of  three  power  project  management  boards  (PPMBs)  that  implement  investment \nprojects  undertaken  by  NPT. The  Northern,  Central,  Southern,  Hanoi  and Ho Chi  Minh  power \ncorporations,  established  in  2010  and currently  wholly  owned by  EVN,  are  responsible for  the \ndistribution  network.  Several  state-owned  enterprises  are  involved  in  independent  power \ngeneration  projects,  notably  the  oil  and  gas  company  PetroVietNam  and  the  mining  company \nVinacomin. \n \n8. \nSince  enacting  the  Electricity  Law  in  2005,  Viet  Nam  has  demonstrated  strong \ncommitment  to  creating  a  competitive  power  market  and  broadening  ownership  in  the  sector. \nEVN was transformed into a vertically integrated holding company, and power-generation plants \nare  gradually  being  transferred  to  independent  power  producers.  During  2011\u20132020,  46%  of \nnew power-generating capacity is planned as coming from foreign and domestic private sector \nentities. The state-owned power sector entities scheduled to be privatized are three of the five \ndistribution  companies.  However,  the  government  specified  that  the  national  transmission \nnetwork and large electricity-generation projects that are of high socioeconomic importance for \nnational defense and security will not be privatized.  \n \n\n3. \n\nSubsector Problems and Constraints \n\n9. \nTechnical sustainability. A total of 22,294 megawatts (MW) of generation capacity will \nbe  added  during  2011\u20132015,  and  a  further  35,087  MW  during  2016\u20132020,  to  meet  projected \npeak demand of 45,199 MW in 2020 and maintain a reserve margin of 41%, which still depends \nheavily  on  the  availability  of  hydroelectricity.3  Electricity  imports  from  regional  power  trade  will \nbe 3% of the targeted generation capacity of 77,200 MW in 2020.  \n \n10. \nThe  rapid  expansion  of  new  power  generation  and  electricity  imports  from  neighboring \ncountries  requires  that  500  kV  and  220  kV  transmission  lines  and  associated  substations  be \nstrengthened and developed commensurately to better balance regional power load systems by \n(i)  removing  transmission  bottlenecks,  (ii)  facilitating  power  transfers,  and  (iii)  reducing \ntransmission  system  losses  and  voltage  fluctuations.  During  2011\u20132020,  the  transmission \nnetwork is planned to expand by 8,372 kilometers (km) of 500 kV transmission lines, 15,942 km \nof  220  kV  transmission  lines,  43,850  megavolt-amperes  (MVA)  of  500  kV/220  kV  substation \ntransformer capacity, and 74,926 MVA of 220 kV/110 kV substation transformer capacity. The \ngovernment has set targets to reduce system losses from 10% in 2010 to 8% in 2020.  \n \n11. \nFinancial capacity. A key challenge for power sector entities is to mobilize financing to \nmeet  investment  requirements.  While  independent  power  producers  are  increasingly  essential \nto attracting more investments in power generation, NPT remains solely responsible for meeting \n                                                \n3  In  2010,  44.6%  of  total  installed  capacity  was  hydropower,  17.6%  coal-fired  thermal,  31.8%  oil-  and  gas-fired \nthermal, and 6.0%  from  small-scale  hydropower  and  imports.  Targets  have been  set  to  improve  energy  efficiency \nespecially in industry. The elasticity ratio of electricity demand is projected to decline from 2.0 in 2011 to 1.0 in 2020. \n\n\f3 \n\ninvestment requirements by using its own resources and mobilizing financing from development \npartners. Without strong cash flow, NPT will find it increasingly difficult to finance its investment \nrequirements.  Further,  the  availability  of  concessionary  official  development  assistance  and \ndomestic  funds  from  the  government  is  limited.  Local  finance  is  available  for  priority \ninfrastructure projects but with loans of only short tenure. NPT therefore resorts to borrowing on \ncommercial  terms  from  export  credit  agencies  and  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  ordinary \ncapital resources. \n \n12. \nElectricity  tariff  and  transmission  charge  adjustments.  Although  affordability  and \npublic  welfare  must  be  considered  at  Viet  Nam\u2019s  stage  of  development,  the  government \nrecognizes  that  increases  in  tariffs  are  inevitable  to  cover  greater  costs  associated  with \nexpansion in power generation and transmission. The average electricity retail tariff was raised \nby  8.9%  in  2009,  6.8%  in  2010,  and  15.3%  in  2011  and  is  currently  set  at  D1,242/kWh. \nTransmission charges were increased by 14.3% in March 2011 to D77.5/kWh. \n \n13. \nHuman resource development. Human resource capacity in the key operational areas \nof corporate strategic business planning, management, accounting, financial management, and \nplanning need to be strengthened, and appropriate tools, processes, and procedures need to be \nfurther  updated,  developed,  and  implemented  to  allow  NPT  to  efficiently  and  effectively  keep \npace with expansion requirements.  \n \n\n4. \n\nRoad Map, Strategy, and Sector Reform Framework \n\nthe \n\nlarge \n\ninfrastructure \n\nimportance  of \n\n14. \nExpanding power generation, transmission, and distribution capacity in an economically \nand  environmentally  sustainable  manner  to  meet  rapidly  growing  electricity  demand  is  a  key \npriority of the Government of Viet Nam. It is one important prerequisite to sustaining economic \ngrowth,  expanding  employment  and  income-generating  opportunities,  and  thus  continuing  to \nreduce  poverty.  The  government\u2019s  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132015 \nacknowledges \nfor  socioeconomic \ndevelopment.  Recognizing  the  need  to  overcome  current  constraints  in  the  power  sector,  the \ngovernment approved on 27 July 2011 the National Power Development Master Plan (PDMP) \nVII.  With  PDMP  VII,  the  government  approved  multiple  power  generation  and  transmission \nprojects  to  be  implemented  during  2011\u20132020  and  laid  out  a  detailed  road  map  and  reform \nframework for (i) strengthening financial capacity, (ii) improving the operational performance of \npower sector entities, (iii) enhancing human resource capacity and development, (iv) improving \nthe  technological  optimization  and  modernization  of  power  sector  infrastructure,  and  (v) \nenhancing  energy  efficiency  in  generation  and  consumption  to  sustainably  develop  and \nmodernize Viet Nam\u2019s power sector.4  \n \n15. \nNPT\u2019s  investment  plan  for  2011\u20132020,  estimated at  $7,780  million,  comprises  physical \nand nonphysical investments to address infrastructure requirements and operational constraints \n(Table 1). \n\ninvestments \n\nTable 1: National Power Transmission Investment Plan Estimates \n($ million) \n\nItem \nExpansion of transmission network  \nOperational effectiveness and efficiency \nProject management  \n\nTotal \n\n2011\u20132015 \n3,580.0 \n30.0 \n140.0 \n3,750.0 \n\n2016\u20132020 \n3,860.0 \n20.0 \n150.0 \n4,030.0 \n\nTotal \n7,440.0 \n50.0 \n290.0 \n7,780.0 \n\nShare of Total \n(%) \n95.6 \n0.7 \n3.7 \n100.0 \n\nSource: National Power Transmission Corporation estimates. \n \n                                                \n4 The Framework Financing Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) includes the MFF \n\nconstituents detailing the road map, the strategy, sector reform, and ADB\u2019s strategic context.  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n5. \n\nADB Sector Experience \n\n16. \nADB  has  continuously  supported  the  power  sector  through  investments,  technical \nassistance,  and  policy  dialogue  for  planning  reform  and  designing  the  power  market.5  ADB\u2019s \ncountry  assistance  program  evaluation  for  Viet  Nam,  1999\u20132008  assessed  the  energy  sector \nassistance strategy and program highly relevant, successful, effective, likely to be sustainable, \nand substantial in impact and contribution to development results and value addition.6  \n \n17. \nThe  country  assistance  program  evaluation  identified  efficiency  issues  related  to \nimplementation  delays,  in  particular  (i)  lengthy  government  administrative  and  approval \nprocedures  involving  several  ministries;  (ii)  many  layers  of  approval  for  procurement, \nconstruction,  land  acquisition,  and  safeguards;  (iii)  delays  in  finalizing  detailed  technical \ndesigns;  (iv)  small  procurement  packages  in  the  interest  of  attracting  local  bidders;  and  (v) \nlimited  trained  human  resources  to  implement  safeguard  measures  in  an  effective  and  timely \nway.  The  risk  of  implementation  delays  under  the  investment  program  will  be  mitigated  by  (i) \nensuring  a  high  degree  of  readiness  for  subproject  implementation  with  detailed  technical \ndesigns,  government  approvals,  and  advanced  procurement  in  place  before  a  tranche  is \napproved,  (ii)  implementing  procurement  plans  with  an  appropriate  number  of  procurement \ncontracts per subprojects, and (ii) building the capacity of NPT staff to prepare and implement \nsafeguard compliance documents and measures. \n \n\n6. \n\nRationale for the Multitranche Financing Facility Modality \n\n18. \nCompared  with  other  modalities,  an  MFF  provides  long-term,  consistent,  predictable, \nand  coordinated  support  with  a  critical  amount  of  financing  for  physical  and  nonphysical \ninvestments in line with the objectives and time frame of PDMP VII. The objectives of PDMP VII \nare  fully  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  and  energy  assessment  strategy \nand road map for 2011\u20132015.7 The sequencing and size of financing tranches provides to NPT \nthe flexibility to sequence transmission network investments in response to (i) the development \nof new power generation capacity, (ii) changes in load forecast and the commissioning of new \npower  plants,  and (iii)  the finalization of technical  designs.8 With  the  existence of  a  road  map, \nsector  strategy,  and  reform  framework  strongly  owned  by  the  government  and  power  sector \nentities, the key requirements for using the MFF modality are met.  \n\n \n7. \n\nDevelopment Partner Coordination \n\n19. \nDevelopment  partner  coordination  has  in  the  past  provided  the  government  with \nopportunities to synergize interventions and capitalize on best practices. ADB, the World Bank, \nand bilateral partners have provided a significant portion of the funds for developing Viet Nam\u2019s \npower  sector,  including  the  country\u2019s  transmission  network.  However,  physical  investment \nrequirements, \nfrom  any \ndevelopment  partner  and  import\u2013export  banks  that  are  interested  in providing financing  to the \ntransmission subsector.9 Through its long expertise, distinctive capabilities, and services, ADB \nwill continue to add value to the transmission subsector,  improving both physical infrastructure \nand sector performance.  \n\ntransmission,  exceed \n\nfinancing  available \n\nin  particular \n\nthe \n\nin \n\n                                                \n5 ADB. 2004.

The  outcome  of  the  investment  program  is  the  enhanced  capacity  of  the \ntransmission network to balance power loads. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nComponent 1: Expanded Transmission Network  \n\n21. \nThe first component of the investment program will support the expansion and upgrading \nof 500 kV and 220 kV transmission lines and associated substations throughout Viet Nam. It will \ncontribute to expanding Viet Nam\u2019s power transmission network by adding 647.6 km to 500 kV \ntransmission  lines,  101.3  km  to  220  kV  transmission  lines,  3,500  MVA  to  500  kV/220  kV \nsubstation  transformer  capacity,  and  1,250  MVA  to  220  kV/110  kV  substation  transformer \ncapacity.10 The main benefits include (i) reductions in transmission losses with the strengthening \nof the transmission network, and (ii) increased power availability by facilitating power transfers, \nin  particular  from  new  and  existing  hydropower  plants.  The  transmission  network  expansion \ntherefore  will  contribute  to  (i)  increasing  per  capita  electricity  consumption  from  985  kWh  in \n2010 to 3,800 kWh in 2025, (ii) supporting the government\u2019s efforts to mitigate climate change, \nand (iii) facilitating the development of a competitive power market. All subprojects considered \nfor financing under the investment program are included in PDMP VII. \n \n22. \nTranche 1 will finance four subprojects: (i) the 500 kV and 220 kV Bac Ninh 2\u2013Pho Noi \ntransmission line in northern Viet Nam,11 (ii) the associated 500 kV/220 kV Pho Noi substation, \n(iii) the 220 kV Song May\u2013Uyen Hung transmission line, and (iv) the 220 kV/110 kV Phu My 2 \nsubstation (the latter two located in southern Viet Nam).  \n \n\n2. \n\nComponent 2: Improved Operational Effectiveness and Efficiency \n\n23. \nThe second component will build on ongoing capacity support provided by ADB through \ncapacity  building  technical  assistance.12  To  provide  NPT  with  the  tools  to  effectively  and \nefficiently  manage  the  growth  of  its  operations,  NPT  management  and  staff  will  undertake \ntraining  seminars  on  (i)  strategic  corporate  planning,  business  planning,  and management;  (ii) \naccounting, financial management, planning, and control; (iii) human resource management and \ndevelopment;  and  (iv)  optimizing  the  engineering  design  of  the  transmission  network.  Under \ntranche 1, the services of a consulting firm will be engaged to provide training to at least 20 staff \non  (i)  strategic  corporate  planning,  business  planning,  and  management;  and  (ii)  accounting, \nfinancial management, planning, and control. \n \n\n3. \n\nComponent 3: Project Implementation Support \n\nThe  third  component  will  support  project  implementation  with  focus  on  detailed \n24. \nengineering,  construction  supervision,  procurement,  safeguards  compliance,  and \nthe \npreparation  of  subsequent  tranches  of  the  investment  program.

The  Institute  of  Energy,  under  the  Ministry  of  Industry  and \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nTrade, carries out studies on least-cost generation and transmission expansion for the country \nusing  the  integrated  resource  planning  approach.  Exhaustive  engineering  design  and  power \nsystem  calculations  ensure  robust  and  optimal  transmission  network  development  based  on \ninternationally  proven  extra-high-voltage  alternating-current  transmission  technology.  The \nMinistry of Industry and Trade approves feasibility studies and detailed technical designs for all \ntransmission projects. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nSubprojects  appraised  for  tranche  1  are  economically  and  financially  viable.  The \n32. \neconomic  rate  of  return  is  28%.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  four  subprojects \nranges  from  11.7%  to  17.6%.  The  economic  and  financial  internal  rates  of  return  exceed  the \nweighted average cost of capital of 3.9%, and the economic and financial net present values are \npositive. Sensitivity analysis indicates that subprojects\u2019 economic and financial internal rates of \nreturn  are  viable  under  stressed  conditions.  The  subprojects  generate  a  net  financial  and \neconomic surplus.17  \n \n33. \nADB  reviewed  NPT\u2019s  financial  performance  and  projections,  including  its  capacity  to \nfinance its investment needs and the adequacy of its capital structure to meet its debt service \nrequirements.18  The  government  will  ensure,  through  the  facility  undertakings,  that  a \ntransmission charge is set and implemented and/or additional financial restructuring measures \nare undertaken so that NPT can progressively achieve the financial performance objectives of a \n(i) debt-service-coverage ratio of 1.5, (ii) self-financing ratio of 25%, and (iii) debt-to-equity ratio \nof  75:25  by  2015  and  maintain  them  thereafter.  In  addition,  ADB  provides  NPT  with  financing \nsupport,  using  the  MFF  and  technical  assistance,  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  NPT  staff  in \naccounting, corporate financial management, planning, and control.  \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nimplementing  agencies  have  adequate \n\n34.  While  NPT  is  a  fairly  new  entity,  most  of  its  staff  was  formerly  part  of  EVN,  and  the \nPPMBs existed prior to the establishment of NPT as unincorporated business units of EVN. As \nthe staff of NPT and its three PPMBs has implemented several transmission projects funded by \nADB  and  other  development  partners  and  financing  institutions,  it  possesses  extensive \nexperience  and  skills  in  implementing  projects.  A  project  financial  management,  procurement, \nand implementation capacity assessment of NPT and the PPMBs concluded that the executing \nand \nfinancial  accounting,  audit  and  reporting, \nprocurement,  and  implementation  arrangements  in  place  for  implementing  the  investment \nprogram.  \n \n35. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and NPT. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the facility administration manual.19 \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n36. \nThe  poverty  and  social  analysis  assessed  impacts  at  the  sector  level,  since  identifying \nspecific  consumers  is  challenging  in  the  context  of  transmission  network  expansion.20  In  rural \nareas,  reliable  and  improved  electricity  supply  will,  in  addition  to  improving  the  quality  of  life \n\n                                                \n17 Economic Analysis and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Financial Performance and Projections of National Power Transmission Corporation (accessible as supplementary \n\ndocument in Appendix 2). \n\n19 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f9 \n\ngenerally,  improve  the  productivity,  efficiency,  and  quality  of  agricultural  production  for  both \ndomestic consumption and export, thus increasing income. Benefits to the poor will come from \nincreased  demand  for  labor  resulting  from  improved  electricity  supply  to  industrial  and \ncommercial employers in urban and peri-urban areas. Industry is projected to account for 29% \nof  the  workforce  by  2015,  and  services  for  31%,  increasing  incomes  and  remittances  from \nmigrant  labor  and  mitigating  the  income  vulnerability  of  urban  and  rural  households.  While \nelectricity tariffs need to be increased to ensure the ability of power sector entities to finance the \nlarge  investment  required,  the  government  is  committed  to  continuing  efforts  to  develop  and \neffectively  implement  appropriate  tariff  structures  and  social  safety  measures  to  ensure  equal \nsocioeconomic development over the term of the MFF. Women that occupy roles in accounting, \nfinancing,  human  resources,  and  safeguards  in  NPT  will  benefit  from  the  training  programs \nprovided under the investment program. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n37. \nThe  government  and  NPT  endorsed  the  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework  and  the  resettlement  and  ethnic  minority  development  framework  prepared  for  the \ninvestment  program  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  Viet \nNam\u2019s regulations and guidelines.21 The impact on indigenous people from subprojects financed \nunder the investment program will be assessed in accordance with the resettlement and ethnic \nminority development framework. Both frameworks will guide NPT and the PPMBs in preparing \nand implementing safeguard measures, as subprojects will need to be classified as safeguard \ncategory B or A. The resettlement and ethnic minority development framework includes specific \nactions  to  ensure  gender-equitable  participation  in  the  preparation  and  implementation  of \nresettlement  plans.  The  two  frameworks  are  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website.  The  safeguard \ncategory for tranche 1 is B for environment, A for involuntary resettlement, and C for indigenous \npeople. \n \n38. \nEnvironment.  Subprojects  of  tranche  1  are  category  B  under  ADB\u2019s  environment \nguidelines.  No  component  of  any  of  the  four  subprojects  is  located  in  an  environmentally \nsensitive or protected area, and potential impacts during construction will be mitigated by using \ngood  international  construction  practices.  An  initial  environmental  examination  report  with  an \nenvironmental  management  plan  and  implementation  budget  was  prepared  for  each  of  the \nsubprojects  of  tranche  1  and  is  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website.22  Environmental  and  social  units \nwill  be  formed  within  each  PPMB  to  supervise  implementation  and  assure  occupational  and \ncommunity health and safety until operation.  \n \n39. \nResettlement and indigenous people. Two subprojects of tranche 1 are category A\u2014\nthe  500  kV/220  kV  Pho  Noi  substation  and  the  220  kV  Song  May\u2013Uyen  Hung  transmission \nline\u2014and  the  other  two  subprojects  are  category  B.  There is  no  need  to relocate  houses,  but \n1,880  households  will  be  affected  by  land  acquisition,  including  293  households  likely  to  be \nsignificantly  affected.  Provincial  governments  confirmed  that  ethnic  minorities  do  not  reside  in \nthe  subproject  areas  financed  under  tranche  1.  Resettlement  plans  have  been  prepared  for \neach  of  the  four  subprojects  and  are  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website.23  Implementation  will  be \nindependently monitored.  \n \nFollowing  an  initial  assessment,  the  safeguard  category  for  subsequent  tranches  will \n40. \nreflect  that  of  tranche  1,  with  no  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  but  potentially \n\n                                                \n21  Environmental  Assessment  and  Review  Framework  and  Resettlement  and  Ethnic  Minority  Development \n\nFramework (accessible from the linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n22 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nsignificant  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  and  some  having  limited  impact  on  indigenous \npeople.
