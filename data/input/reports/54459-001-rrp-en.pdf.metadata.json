ADB\u2019s \nfinancing will support ZFL\u2019s funding requirements for long-term funding for SMEs, which is in short \nsupply.  ADB\u2019s  support  will  enable  the  company  to  provide  longer-tenor  lease  finance  to \nunderserved segments, improve its asset\u2013liability profile, and diversify its funding sources. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nOverview of access to finance by small and medium-sized enterprises. SMEs are an \nimportant part of the PRC economy. The development of SMEs directly contributes to economic \ngrowth, given their critical role in creating jobs. Small businesses with 300 or fewer employees \naccounted for 98.64% of all firms and contributed more than 60% of total gross domestic product \n(GDP),  50%  of  tax  income,  75%  of  job  creation,  and  68%  of  exports.1   Despite  the  significant \ncontribution  of  SMEs  to  economic  growth,  limited  access  to  finance  has  always  been  a  major \nconstraint  on  SMEs.  Banks  have  shown  a  preference  for  lending  to  state-owned  enterprises \n(SOEs)  and  larger  corporates  operating  in  the  priority  sectors  identified  in  domestic  industrial \npolicy, as SMEs are considered a higher-risk segment with higher transaction costs. Since 2011, \nthe  Government  of  the  PRC  has  implemented  various  initiatives  to  improve  the  business \nenvironment  for  SMEs  and  facilitate  their  access  to  finance,  including  amending  the  Law  on \nPromoting  Small  and  Medium-sized  Enterprises  and  developing  small  banks  and  non-deposit-\ntaking financial institutions. Despite government initiatives, many SMEs are still marginalized in \naccess to financing. The financing gap for micro and SMEs in the PRC reached $1.89 trillion in \n2017, accounting for 17% of GDP.2 \n \n4. \nFinancial leasing industry. Leasing is particularly suited for SME financing, especially to \npurchase  equipment,  which  is  not  generally  accepted  as  collateral  by  commercial  banks.  The \nPRC\u2019s leasing industry grew rapidly at a compound annual growth rate of 24.85% in 2008\u20132019, \nfilling  the  gap  that  traditional  banks  do  not  bridge.  Despite  rapid  growth,  the  financial  leasing \nindustry  needs further  development.  The  lease penetration  rate  was  1.71%  in  2019,  ranking  it \n24th out of the top 50 global leasing markets.3 \n \nImpact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  on  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises.  The \n5. \noutbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020 has adversely impacted SMEs \nin the PRC. They are vulnerable to shocks because of their financial weakness, lower degree of \nbusiness  diversification,  smaller  size,  and  lower  ability  to  withstand  temporary  disruption  in \nproduction and services. SMEs are generally not as digitalized as other firms, making them less \nresilient  and  flexible  in  adapting  to  changes  in  work  processes  to  respond  to  the  business \n\n \n\n1  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 2020. Financing SMEs and Entrepreneurs 2020. Paris. \n2  SME Finance Forum. Formal MSME Finance Gap (accessed on 26 March 2021). \n3  White  Clarke  Group.  2021.  Global  Leasing  Report  2021.  London.  Lease  penetration  rate  is  measured  as  a \n\npercentage of lease finance to total GDP. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fenvironment during the pandemic. The government has introduced policy measures to support \nSMEs,  including  raising  central  bank  relending  and  rediscounting  quotas,  and  directionally \nlowering the deposit reserve ratio of the People\u2019s Bank of China to encourage banks to lend more \nto SMEs at lower interest rates. Despite this policy support, SMEs continue to face difficulty in \naccessing  finance.  As  of  June  2020,  credit  to  SMEs  accounted  for  only  28.86%  of  total  bank \nloans.4 \n \n6. \nRationale.  ADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  operations  projects  in  the  PRC\u2019s  finance  sector  have \nactively supported leasing, targeting diverse subsectors in underdeveloped segments, including \nSME financing.5 In 2018, ADB disbursed a $60 million loan (in CNY equivalent) to ZFL for SME \nfinance in the underdeveloped central and western regions of the PRC,6 and the loan proceeds \nhave been successfully deployed. The COVID-19 outbreak has exposed significant challenges \nfor  SME  development,  reducing  jobs,  especially  for  migrant  workers  from  rural  areas,  who \ntypically work in services and light manufacturing. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \n7. \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. Guangdong\u2019s Pearl River Delta area alone \nhad 44.2 million migrant workers in 2019 or 25% of all migrant workers in the PRC.7 Almost all \nmigrant  workers  are  employed  by  SMEs,  which  accounted  for  98.4%  of  total  enterprises  in \nGuangdong.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  significantly  impacted  SMEs  and  jobs  for  migrant \nworkers; 8 million migrant workers are estimated to have lost their urban jobs on a long-term basis \nand resettled in their native regions because of the COVID-19 outbreak.8 SMEs in Guangdong \nface significant challenges in accessing finance. Loans to all private enterprises in Guangdong \naccounted for 28.0% of the total outstanding banking sector loans in that province by  the third \nquarter  of  2020,  while  loans  to  SMEs  accounted  for  only  10.4%.9 Lack  of  collateral  is  a  key \nconstraint on SMEs\u2019 access to finance, and unsecured loans to SMEs accounted for only 9.1% of \ntotal  SME  loans  and  0.95%  of  total  banking  sector  loans  in  Guangdong.  The  province  has \nsubstantial regional disparity in economic development and significant income inequality. In 2019, \nthe total GDP of Guangzhou and Shenzhen cities accounted for 46.9% of total GDP of the entire \nprovince.10 Of the 21 cities in Guangdong, 14 had a per capita GDP that was below the national \naverage of CNY71,965 ($10,300). Shenzhen, the most developed city, had a GDP per capita that \nwas 10 times more than that of Meizhou ($29,627 versus $2,963). This project will help expand \nZFL\u2019s  capacity  to  finance  SMEs,  particularly those  outside  the  most  developed  cities\u2014Beijing, \nGuangzhou, Shanghai, and Shenzhen\u2014increasing jobs and reducing regional income inequality. \n \nB. \n \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n \n\n4  The State Council of People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). 2020.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \n9. \n \n10. \n \nC. \n \nOwnership. ZFL is a wholly owned subsidiary of GRCB. Excluding the big 5 state-owned banks and the \n12 national joint-stock commercial banks, GRCB is one of the larger local banks and ranked fourth among \nall rural commercial banks by total assets in 2019. By June 2020, GRCB had total assets of CNY972 billion \nand total deposits of CNY727 billion. GRCB is rated  Baa2 by Moody\u2019s and has been listed on the Hong \nKong Stock Exchange since 2017 with market capitalization of HK$6 billion as of 19 March 2021. GRCB \nhas  a  diversified  shareholder  structure.  Its  largest  beneficial  owner  is  the  Guangzhou  municipal \ngovernment, with a total shareholding of 18.22% through 13 SOEs. The remaining shareholders are mainly \nprivate sector entities and individual investors. No other shareholders directly or indirectly hold more than \na 5% stake in GRCB. ADB conducted integrity due diligence on ZFL and its shareholders, board of directors, \nand  key  managers.11 Although  ZFL\u2019s  beneficial  owners  could  not  all  be  identified,  the  potential  risk  is \nmitigated  by  the  fact  that  GRCB\u2019s  relevant  shares  are  held  by  public  and  institutional  investors,  and  no \nshareholder other than the government holds more than a 5% indirect stake in GRCB. ADB\u2019s review does \nnot give ADB cause to believe that the entity is being used for money laundering or terrorism financing. Tax \nintegrity due diligence was not required because the transaction does not involve intermediate jurisdictions \nor material related-party transactions.12 \n \n11. \n \n12. \nGovernance  structure.  ZFL  has  a  well-defined  corporate  governance  structure.  The \nboard of directors is responsible for overall strategy, major decisions, key business objectives, \nand  senior  management  appointments.  Since  ZFL  is  a  fully  owned  subsidiary  of  GRCB,  all \ndirectors are appointed by GRCB. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. The board has \nfour  committees,  for  related-party  transactions  control,  strategic  development,  risk,  and \nperformance review. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \nD. \n \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED.   \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\nADB will provide a senior secured loan to ZFL of up to $40 million (or its yuan equivalent), \n\n \nA. \n \n13. \nwith a tenor of up to 5 years.  \n \nB. \n \n14. \nUse  of  proceeds.  ZFL  will  use  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  debt  financing  to  fund  lease \ncontracts with SMEs in the PRC. The project will exclude SMEs located in the four most developed \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n11 ADB. 2003.

ADB will prepare monitoring reports regularly and at least annually. The first \n\ncities\u2014Beijing,  Guangzhou,  Shanghai  and  Shenzhen\u2014from  using  ADB  loan  proceeds.  The \nproject will use the government\u2019s definition of SMEs.13 For lease finance to SMEs, the maximum \namount funded by the proposed loan will be capped at $8 million per sub-project. The proposed \nloan is also expected to fund the pilot of a new lease finance product for micro-enterprises that \nZFL plans to launch in late 2021. \n \n15. \nReporting arrangements. ADB will monitor the project over its life. ZFL will provide ADB \nwith  financial  and  other reports  at  predetermined  regular  intervals  and  as  requested,  including \n(i) quarterly unaudited financial statements, (ii) annual audited financial statements, (iii) quarterly \ncompliance  certificates  for  financial  covenants,  (iv)  periodic  reports  on  the  underlying  leases \nfinanced by ZFL through the loan, and (v) annual reports on the selected development indicators \nand the safeguards and social dimensions policy agreed between ADB and ZFL. \n \n16. \nreport will be submitted no later than 12 months after the first loan disbursement. \n \nC. \n \n17. \nProvide  long-term  stable  finance.  CONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION  DELETED.  To \ndiversify its funding sources, ZFL issued one bond, through which it raised CNY1 billion in April \n2019. However, a bond issuance is subject to long regulatory approval, and the company will not \nbe able to tap the capital markets again without fresh approval from regulators. The long-tenor \nfunding from ADB will enable the company to provide longer-tenor leasing products for SMEs and \nimprove its asset\u2013liability profile, increasing the company\u2019s capacity to expand its operations. \n \n18. \nSupport  development  of  innovative  financing  modality  for  SMEs  and  facilitate \nknowledge  transfer.  Leasing  is  a  modality  particularly  suited  to  finance  SMEs,  especially  for \nprocurement  of  manufacturing  equipment,  which  is  not  generally  accepted  as  collateral  by \ncommercial banks. By supporting a leasing company with a strong SME focus, the proposed loan \nwill help expand SMEs\u2019 access to lease finance and, in turn, support job creation and economic \ngrowth.  The  project  will  support  ZFL  to  pilot  a  new  lease  finance  product  targeting  micro \nenterprises, and ADB will also facilitate knowledge transfer and information exchange between \nZFL and leasing companies operating in other ADB\u2019s developing member countries. \n \n19. \nSupport gender equity. ADB will work with ZFL to promote gender-inclusive measures \nin  operations.  ZFL  will  create  a  respectful  working  environment  by  introducing  anti\u2013sexual-\nharassment  measures  and  creating  opportunities  for  women  by  hiring  female  interns  and \nproviding professional development training for female staff members. \n \n20.  Mobilize  cofinancing  and  supporting  safeguards  capacity  development.  ADB \nexpects to mobilize additional cofinancing for the project and has been arranging a $40 million \nparallel loan from Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH (DEG). Cofinancing \n\n \n\n13 In  2011,  the  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Information  Technology  and  National  Bureau  of  Statistics,   National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission, and Ministry of Finance promulgated The Notice on Issuing the Provisions \non  Criteria  for  Classifying  Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprises,  which is used  by  the  China  Banking  Regulatory \nCommission  to  measure  and monitor  SME-financing  performance  of  financial  institutions.  SMEs  are defined  and \ncategorized into three types (i.e. medium, small and micro enterprises) based on revenues, staff size, and/or total \nassets, depending on the characteristics of different industries. For instance, in agriculture, enterprises with annual \nrevenues of CNY5 million\u2013CNY200 million are defined as medium-sized enterprises; CNY500,000\u2013CNY5 million, \nsmall enterprises; and less than CNY500,000, microenterprises. The definition applies to all legal forms of enterprise, \nincluding individually owned businesses. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nwill help diversify the funding base of ZFL and further improve its access to long-term finance. \nADB also plans to work with DEG to develop an environmental and social management system \n(ESMS) training package tailored for the specific needs of ZFL. \n \nD. \n \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACTS AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nOutcome. The project will have the following outcome: sustainability of ZFL\u2019s SME leasing \n\n \nA. \n \n21. \nImpacts. The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) access to lease finance for \nSMEs  through  financial  leasing  improved, 14  and  (ii)  financial  leasing  industry  developed. 15  \nDespite their importance in job creation and output generation, SMEs still face significant barriers \nto accessing credit from financial institutions. The project will promote SMEs\u2019 access to finance \nand contribute to economic growth. By providing longer-tenor finance to a small leasing company, \nthe project will support the development of the financial leasing industry in the PRC, where the \nleasing penetration rate was only 1.71% in 2019, lower than in major developed markets.

The  project  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector \nOperations Department\u2019s strategy for COVID-19 response by supporting businesses, including \nSMEs negatively affected by the pandemic. \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nADB has categorized the project in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n\n \nA. \n \n26. \n(2009).21 \n \n27. \nCategory  FI.  ADB  has  assessed  the  potential  environmental  and  social  (E&S)  risks \nassociated with ZFL\u2019s existing and likely future portfolio, and its commitment and capacity for E&S \nmanagement.  ZFL  is  an  existing  ADB  client,  and  it  has  established  and  maintained  an  ESMS \nsatisfactory to ADB that includes procedures to (i) screen transactions against ADB's prohibited \ninvestment  activities  list,  (ii)  categorize  investments  to  exclude  those  having  significant \nenvironmental  and/or  social  impacts (category  A),  and  (iii)  ensure  that  investments  using  ADB \nloan  proceeds  comply  with  applicable  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009) requirements \nand  national  laws  and  regulations.  ZFL\u2019s  Environmental  and  Social  Responsibility  Committee, \nheaded  by  senior  management,  is  responsible  for  the  establishment  of  the  ESMS  and  its \nintegration into company processes, and oversees the implementation of the ESMS risk mitigation \nmeasures  by  business  development  managers  in  the  processing  and  monitoring  of  lease \ncontracts. \n \n28. \nDuring  due  diligence,  ADB  reviewed  the  E&S  annual  monitoring  reports,  which  include \nsubprojects financed using proceeds from an earlier ADB loan. The review confirmed that ZFL \nhas  developed  an  ESMS  implementation  guide,  provided  ESMS  training  to  relevant  staff \nmembers  to  support  ESMS  implementation,  and  implemented  the  ESMS  screening  and \ncategorization procedures in the subprojects previously financed by ADB. Through its company \nwebsite, ZFL provides avenues to raise concerns and grievances related to its operations. The \ncompany monitors reputational risks throughout its portfolio by engaging an external data service \nprovider  to  regularly  check  on  legal  disputes  involving  its  clients,  including  any  labor-related \ncases.  The  lease  portfolio  of  ZFL  involving  SMEs  is  not  expected  to  have  significant  adverse \nenvironmental  or  social  impacts,  given  that  most  of  the  leases  are  for  equipment  or  facilities. \nNevertheless, the capacity of the in-house team to identify environmental, health and safety, and \nsocial risks can be further strengthened by providing additional ESMS training. ZFL has indicated \nthat  it  would  welcome  additional  support  and,  as  such,  ADB  plans  to  work  with  the  other \ndevelopment finance institution cofinancier to develop an ESMS training package tailored for the \ncompany\u2019s specific needs. \n \n29. \nZFL will continue to include the following information in the annual monitoring reports it \nsubmits to ADB: (i) the nature of subprojects and categorizations, (ii) compliance with safeguard \nand social requirements, and (iii) compliance with applicable national and international laws and \nstandards. ZFL will continue to ensure compliance with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s \nSocial Protection Strategy (2001), take measures to comply with the internationally recognized \n\n20 ADB. 2004.

To promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment in \nits business activities, following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998), ZFL commits \nto  (i)  increase  the  number  of  women  in  its  internship  program,  (ii)  provide  professional \ndevelopment  training  to  at  least  half  of  its  female  staff  members,  (iii)  include  anti\u2013sexual-\nharassment provisions in its staff conduct guidance, and (iv) train staff members on the new anti\u2013\nsexual-harassment  provisions.  ZFL  will  submit  periodic  reports  on  implementation  of  gender \nmeasures to ADB. \n \nB. \n \n31. \nZFL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating  corruption,  laundering  money,  and  financing  terrorism.  ADB  will  ensure  that  the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n \nD. \n \nConsistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),22 \n32. \nADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon  establishing  that  the  Government  of  the \nPRC  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed  assistance  to  ZFL.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable finance \ndocumentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed \nassistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n\nAssurances \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n33. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  up  to \n$40,000,000 (or its yuan equivalent) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to Zhujiang Financial \nLeasing  Company  Limited  for  the  Zhujiang  Financial  Leasing  Small  and  Medium-Sized \nEnterprises Finance Project in the People\u2019s Republic of China, with such terms and conditions as \nare substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the \nBoard. \n \n\nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n\n29 April 2021 \n \n\n22 ADB. 1966.
