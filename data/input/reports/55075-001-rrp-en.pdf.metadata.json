The \nbalance of the approved equity amount may be invested in subsequent fundraising rounds that \nEMPL is expected to undertake by March 2024. Consistent with the establishment arrangements \nof the fund, ADB will not invest its own capital alongside the fund.2 \n \n2. \nEMPL  is  an  India-based  designer,  manufacturer,  and  fleet  operator  of  electric  small \ncommercial vehicles (e-SCVs) designed for last mile cargo delivery. It has developed a vertically \nintegrated  electric  vehicle  platform  that  combines  cost-competitive  e-SCVs,  fleet  management \nsoftware, and a network of charging and service station infrastructure to offer the lowest total cost \nof ownership (TCO) and total cost of mobility to its customers. EMPL offers its three-wheeler e-\nSCVs  under  a  retail  model  or  a  mobility-as-a-service  (MaaS)  model  to  business-to-business \nclients in the e-commerce and e-grocery segments. The investment will improve the uptake of \nelectric  vehicles in India and minimize  the  use  of  diesel  vehicles  for  intra-city  cargo  deliveries. \nEMPL\u2019s vision to promote energy-efficient electric vehicles and reduce greenhouse gas emissions \naligns with ADB\u2019s operational priorities of tackling climate change, building climate and disaster \nresilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability in Asia and the Pacific.3  \n \n\n \n\nTHE INVESTMENT \n\n \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n \n3. \nIndian  automotive  segment.  India  is  the  world\u2019s  fourth  largest  automotive  market.  Its \nauto and ancillary market constitutes 9% of India\u2019s gross domestic product. Domestic automobile \nproduction  increased  by  2.36%  per  year  during  2016\u20132020,  with  26.36  million  vehicles \nmanufactured in FY2020. Domestic automobile sales increased at a 1.29% Compound Annual \nGrowth Rate between FY2016\u2013FY2020, with 21.55 million vehicles sold in FY2020. India\u2019s auto \nmarket was dominated by two-wheelers (80.8%) and passenger vehicles (12.8%) in FY2020. Its \nautomotive exports exceeded 4.77 million in FY2020, of which 73.9% were two-wheelers, 14.2% \nwere passenger cars, and more than 11.8% were three-wheelers and SCVs. India is expected to \ndisplace Japan and become the third largest auto market by 2023.4   \n \nElectric  vehicle  industry  overview.  India  imported  $112  billion  worth  of  crude  oil  in \n4. \nFY2019\u2014equivalent  to  4%  of  its  gross  domestic  product.  Some  99%  of  gasoline  and  67%  of \ndiesel demand was from the automobile segment. Fourteen of the 20 most polluted cities in the \nworld  are  in  India.5 These  factors  make  the  shift  of  Indian  transportation  to  electric  vehicles \nimminent  and  urgent.  Electric  three-wheelers  for  passenger  transport,  or  e-rickshaws,  have \npenetrated  the  Indian  market  significantly,  with  more  than  700,000  sold  every  year.  Two-  and \n\n \n\n1  Financing  partner:  Clean  Technology  Fund,  Nordic  Development  Fund,  and  the  governments  of  Finland  and  the \nRepublic of Korea. As provided in para. 52 of ADB. 2015. Enhancing Operational Efficiency of the Asian Development \nBank.

Automobile Industry in India. \n5  Avendus. 2020. Electric Vehicles - Charging towards a bright future. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fthree-wheelers are likely to lead the next wave of electric vehicle adoption in India. Commercial \nuse  of  electric  vehicles  shows  that  they  are  on  a  par  with  internal  combustion  engine  (ICE) \nvehicles in terms of TCO. Electric vehicle sales are projected to reach 3 million in India by 2025. \nThe Government of India is catalyzing electric vehicle adoption through demand incentives such \nas subsidies and procurement. The Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid and) Electric \nVehicles Scheme (FAME-I and FAME-II) is creating momentum and developing an ecosystem for \nelectric vehicles in India, and the segment is likely to see disruptive growth from 2022 onwards.6 \nThe government also aims to set up more than 2,700 charging stations across metro cities as \npart of FAME-II.7 In addition, several state governments in India have announced electric vehicle \npolicies for electric vehicle adoption and charging infrastructure creation. Public efforts to catalyze \ngrowth in the segment are increasing the interest of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to \nroll out electric vehicles.  \n \n5. \nSmall  commercial  vehicle  segment.  Commercial  vehicles  account  for  about  4%  of \nIndia\u2019s domestic production volume, with more than 1 million commercial vehicles sold (FY2019). \nLight commercial vehicles (excluding three-wheelers) used for goods transport account for almost \n56% of total commercial vehicle volumes, and more than 90% of them (i.e., more than 500,000) \nare in the SCV category (i.e., vehicles with capacity of less than 3.5 tons). SCVs are used primarily \nin last mile delivery and logistics. The adoption of Goods and Services Tax in India, a strong e-\ncommerce and e-grocery boom, and improved infrastructure have provided a strong boost to the \nSCV  segment.  Established OEMs such  as  Tata and Mahindra  have  captured  a  share  of  more \nthan 60% of the SCV market. SCVs also compete with traditional three-wheeler cargo vehicles. \nThe combined SCV and three-wheeler market presents a strong case for electric vehicle adoption \nin India. \n  \n6. \nWomen\u2019s participation in the industry. The automotive industry is a nontraditional area \nfor  women  because  of  the  stereotypical  view  of  manufacturing  as  men\u2019s  domain. 8  Women \ncomprise 30% of India\u2019s combined professional and technical workers.9 Indian firms have been \nintroducing models to attract and retain women in the tech industry.10 While the value of women\u2019s \nformal engagement in clean energy is being recognized, creating permanent and stable sources \nof income for trained women remains unaddressed.11  \n \nConfidential Information Deleted \n \n\nOwnership and Management  \n\n \n\n \n\n \nConfidential Information Deleted \n \n\nFinancial Performance  \n\n \nConfidential Information Deleted \n \n\n \n\n6   FAME-I was launched in 2015, and FAME-II was launched in 2019. \n7  Government of India. 2019.

These coinvestors \npotentially include Inventus Capital, Blume Ventures, and Jetty Ventures. \n \n\n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \nConfidential Information Deleted \n \n9. \nReporting arrangements. ADB will monitor the investment. Investment reporting will be \nsubject to  information  disclosure requirements,  in  addition  to  compliance with Indian  legal  and \nregulatory requirements. EMPL will provide ADB with financial reports at predetermined regular \nintervals and on request, including (i) a report on using the subscription proceeds, (ii) quarterly \nand annual financial statements for the past period, and (iii) annual budget and business plans \nfor the following fiscal year. \n \n10. \nUse of proceeds. EMPL will use the investment proceeds to finance its business growth \nby  expanding  both  the  team  and  geographic  footprint  while  continuing  its  research  and \ndevelopment of new electric vehicle models.  \n\n \n\n \n\nConfidential Information Deleted \n \n\n \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n \n11. \nDevelopment of India\u2019s electric vehicle industry. ICE vehicles are one of the largest \npolluters  and  consumers  of  gasoline  and  diesel. The role  of  ADB  in  reducing  transport-related \ngreenhouse  gas  emissions  and  making  cities  livable\u2014by  catalyzing  electric  vehicles\u2014is  more \ncrucial than ever. ADB funding will support the evolving electric vehicle industry, which is critical \nin  reducing  India\u2019s  carbon  footprint  and  addressing  climate  change.  Confidential  information \ndeleted. \n \n12. \nResource mobilization. ADB\u2019s shareholding is anticipated to have a significant signaling \neffect and is likely to increase the market\u2019s confidence in EMPL achieving its business goals. This \nwill help EMPL in critical areas, such as launching new products, and attracting future debt and \nequity.  \n\n13. \nProgress  to  market-leading  standards.  As  the  first  and  only  development  finance \ninstitution shareholder, ADB will help develop and support EMPL\u2019s adherence to high corporate \ngovernance  and  integrity  standards,  as  well  as  its  adoption  of  market-leading  social  and \nenvironmental standards, with potential demonstration effects in the Indian transportation sector. \nADB will also add value to EMPL by assisting it to (i) establish a more balanced board, including \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nthe  creation  a  financial  management  committee  and  an  audit  committee;  and  (ii)  incorporate \ngender-inclusive workplace policies. \n \n14. \nGender equality. This investment will help EMPL implement gender actions to promote \nwomen\u2019s economic empowerment by enhancing gender responsiveness in its workplace and its \nbusiness activities. It will also contribute to increasing women\u2019s skills and work opportunities in \nthe  clean  technology  and  automobile  segments,  thus  addressing  the  gender  gap  in  both \nindustries. Through ADB support, EMPL will increase women\u2019s participation in top management \nand technical roles, and require its employees to attend anti-sexual harassment training. \n\n \n\nRisks \n\n \n\nConfidential Information Deleted \n \n\n \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n \nThe investment is aligned with the Government of India\u2019s mission12 to achieve Sustainable \n15. \nDevelopment  Goal  13  on  climate  action. 13  The  investment\u2019s  expected  outcome  is  reduced \ngreenhouse  gas  emissions  by  commercial  vehicles  in  India. 14  The  expected  outputs  of  the \ninvestment are EMPL\u2019s increased revenue from the sale of electric vehicles, enhanced gender \nequality in decision making, enhanced gender equality in staffing, and enhanced gender equality \nin the workplace.  \n \n\n \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n \n16. \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.

ADB \nexpects  some  investments  to  result  in  full  or  partial  loss,  consistent  with  the  market  dynamics  of  early-stage \ncompanies.  ADB  is  therefore  taking  a  portfolio  approach  by  investing  in  high-risk  investments  that  can  generate \nsignificant  development  outcomes.  The  outcome  indicators  of  each  investment  are  meant  to  be  ambitious  to  be \nconsistent with the portfolio strategy and fund-level outcome targets. \n\nc  It is assumed that each Euler electric vehicle will displace 1.79 Bajaj Maximas (a leading three-wheeler vehicle for \nlast  mile  cargo  transportation),  based  on  actual  utilization  and  payload  capacity.  This  is  equivalent  to  a  baseline \nemission factor of 4.63 tCO2e per year. The entire baseline value is not mitigated because each Euler electric vehicle \nstill  consumes  3.65  MWh  of  electricity  per  year  from  the  Indian  electricity  grid,  which  still  uses  fossil  fuels.  If  the \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n9 \n\ntransmission and distribution loss is 20.66% and the emission factor is 0.673 tCO2e/MWh, then the adjusted emission \nfactor is 0.812 tCO2e/MWh for the Indian electricity grid. Applying this to the electricity consumption of a Euler electric \nvehicle, each vehicle generates 2.96 tCO2e per year. Deducting the emissions generated from grid-based charging \nfrom the reduced emissions caused by the displacement of the Bajaj Maximas, each Euler electric vehicle will mitigate \na net value of 1.66 tCO2e per year. Applying a 10-year life cycle to each Euler electric vehicle, the targeted 900,000 \nvehicles sold from 2021 to 2037 would mitigate 9.6 million tCO2e for this period. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \nConfidential Information Deleted. \n \n\nLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n \n \n", "ADB \nCOVID-19 \nEMPL \ne-SCV \nICE \nMaaS \nOEM \nSCV \nTCO \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 8 March 2021) \n", "Currency unit \n", "\u2013 \n", "Indian rupee/s (\u20b9) \n", "\u20b91.00 \n$1.00 \n", " = \n = \n", " $0.0136 \n \u20b973.30 \n", " \n", "  \n", " \n \n \n", " \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n", "Asian Development Bank \ncoronavirus disease \nEuler Motors Private Limited \nelectric small commercial vehicle \ninternal combustion engine \nmobility-as-a-service \noriginal equipment manufacturer \nsmall commercial vehicle \ntotal cost of ownership \n \n \n \nGLOSSARY \n \n", "  Business-to-business \n", "  Cost of mobility \n", "  Light commercial \n", "vehicle \n", "  Mobility-as-a-service \n", "  Small commercial \n", "vehicle \n", "  Three-wheeler \n", "  Total cost of \nownership \n", "\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n", "A  business  whose  customer  is  another  business  instead  of \nan individual consumer. \nThe total cost incurred by a company to deliver its goods to \nthe customer.
