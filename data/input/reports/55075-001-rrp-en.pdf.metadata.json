The transaction involves the administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of an \nequity investment of up to the Indian rupee equivalent of $4,000,000, with an initial investment of \nup to \u20b9110,000,000, in Euler Motors Private Limited (EMPL) in India, to be provided by the ADB \nVentures Investment Fund 11 under the ADB Ventures Financing Partnership Facility. The \nbalance of the approved equity amount may be invested in subsequent fundraising rounds that \nEMPL is expected to undertake by March 2024. Consistent with the establishment arrangements \nof the fund, ADB will not invest its own capital alongside the fund.2 \n \n2.  EMPL is an India-based designer, manufacturer, and fleet operator of electric small \ncommercial vehicles (e-SCVs) designed for last mile cargo delivery. It has developed a vertically \nintegrated electric vehicle platform that combines cost-competitive e-SCVs, fleet management \nsoftware, and a network of charging and service station infrastructure to offer the lowest total cost \nof ownership (TCO) and total cost of mobility to its customers. EMPL offers its three-wheeler e-\nSCVs under a retail model or a mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) model to business-to-business \nclients in the e-commerce and e-grocery segments. The investment will improve the uptake of \nelectric vehicles in India and minimize the use of diesel vehicles for intra-city cargo deliveries. \nEMPL\u2019s vision to promote energy-efficient electric vehicles and reduce greenhouse gas emissions \naligns with ADB\u2019s operational priorities of tackling climate change, building climate and disaster \nresilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability in Asia and the Pacific.3  \n \n  THE INVESTMENT \n \n  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Indian automotive segment. India is the world\u2019s fourth largest automotive market. Its \nauto and ancillary market constitutes 9% of India\u2019s gross domestic product. Domestic automobile \nproduction  increased  by  2.36%  per  year  during  2016\u20132020,  with  26.36  million  vehicles \nmanufactured in FY2020. Domestic automobile sales increased at a 1.29% Compound Annual \nGrowth Rate between FY2016\u2013FY2020, with 21.55 million vehicles sold in FY2020. India\u2019s auto \nmarket was dominated by two-wheelers (80.8%) and passenger vehicles (12.8%) in FY2020. Its \nautomotive exports exceeded 4.77 million in FY2020, of which 73.9% were two-wheelers, 14.2% \nwere passenger cars, and more than 11.8% were three-wheelers and SCVs. India is expected to \ndisplace Japan and become the third largest auto market by 2023.4   \n \n4.  Electric vehicle industry overview. India imported $112 billion worth of crude oil in \nFY2019\u2014equivalent to 4% of its gross domestic product. Some 99% of gasoline and 67% of \ndiesel demand was from the automobile segment. Fourteen of the 20 most polluted cities in the \nworld are in India.5 These factors make the shift of Indian transportation to electric vehicles \nimminent and urgent. Electric three-wheelers for passenger transport, or e-rickshaws, have \npenetrated the Indian market significantly, with more than 700,000 sold every year.

Electric Vehicles - Charging towards a bright future. \n ", "2 \nthree-wheelers are likely to lead the next wave of electric vehicle adoption in India. Commercial \nuse of electric vehicles shows that they are on a par with internal combustion engine (ICE) \nvehicles in terms of TCO. Electric vehicle sales are projected to reach 3 million in India by 2025. \nThe Government of India is catalyzing electric vehicle adoption through demand incentives such \nas subsidies and procurement. The Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid and) Electric \nVehicles Scheme (FAME-I and FAME-II) is creating momentum and developing an ecosystem for \nelectric vehicles in India, and the segment is likely to see disruptive growth from 2022 onwards.6 \nThe government also aims to set up more than 2,700 charging stations across metro cities as \npart of FAME-II.7 In addition, several state governments in India have announced electric vehicle \npolicies for electric vehicle adoption and charging infrastructure creation. Public efforts to catalyze \ngrowth in the segment are increasing the interest of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to \nroll out electric vehicles.  \n \n5.  Small commercial vehicle segment. Commercial vehicles account for about 4% of \nIndia\u2019s domestic production volume, with more than 1 million commercial vehicles sold (FY2019). \nLight commercial vehicles (excluding three-wheelers) used for goods transport account for almost \n56% of total commercial vehicle volumes, and more than 90% of them (i.e., more than 500,000) \nare in the SCV category (i.e., vehicles with capacity of less than 3.5 tons). SCVs are used primarily \nin last mile delivery and logistics. The adoption of Goods and Services Tax in India, a strong e-\ncommerce and e-grocery boom, and improved infrastructure have provided a strong boost to the \nSCV segment. Established OEMs such as Tata and Mahindra have captured a share of more \nthan 60% of the SCV market. SCVs also compete with traditional three-wheeler cargo vehicles. \nThe combined SCV and three-wheeler market presents a strong case for electric vehicle adoption \nin India. \n  \n6.  Women\u2019s participation in the industry. The automotive industry is a nontraditional area \nfor women because of the stereotypical view of manufacturing as men\u2019s domain.8 Women \ncomprise 30% of India\u2019s combined professional and technical workers.9 Indian firms have been \nintroducing models to attract and retain women in the tech industry.10 While the value of women\u2019s \nformal engagement in clean energy is being recognized, creating permanent and stable sources \nof income for trained women remains unaddressed.11  \n \nConfidential Information Deleted \n \n  Ownership and Management  \n \nConfidential Information Deleted \n \n  Financial Performance  \n \nConfidential Information Deleted \n \n \n6  FAME-I was launched in 2015, and FAME-II was launched in 2019. \n7  Government of India. 2019.

Development of India\u2019s electric vehicle industry. ICE vehicles are one of the largest \npolluters and consumers of gasoline and diesel. The role of ADB in reducing transport-related \ngreenhouse gas emissions and making cities livable\u2014by catalyzing electric vehicles\u2014is more \ncrucial than ever. ADB funding will support the evolving electric vehicle industry, which is critical \nin reducing India\u2019s carbon footprint and addressing climate change. Confidential information \ndeleted. \n \n12.  Resource mobilization. ADB\u2019s shareholding is anticipated to have a significant signaling \neffect and is likely to increase the market\u2019s confidence in EMPL achieving its business goals. This \nwill help EMPL in critical areas, such as launching new products, and attracting future debt and \nequity.  \n \n13.  Progress to market-leading standards. As the first and only development finance \ninstitution shareholder, ADB will help develop and support EMPL\u2019s adherence to high corporate \ngovernance  and  integrity  standards,  as  well  as  its  adoption  of  market-leading  social  and \nenvironmental standards, with potential demonstration effects in the Indian transportation sector. \nADB will also add value to EMPL by assisting it to (i) establish a more balanced board, including \n     \n ", "4 \nthe creation a financial management committee and an audit committee; and (ii) incorporate \ngender-inclusive workplace policies. \n \n14.  Gender equality. This investment will help EMPL implement gender actions to promote \nwomen\u2019s economic empowerment by enhancing gender responsiveness in its workplace and its \nbusiness activities. It will also contribute to increasing women\u2019s skills and work opportunities in \nthe  clean  technology  and  automobile  segments,  thus  addressing  the  gender  gap  in  both \nindustries. Through ADB support, EMPL will increase women\u2019s participation in top management \nand technical roles, and require its employees to attend anti-sexual harassment training. \n \n  Risks \n \nConfidential Information Deleted \n \n  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \n  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n15.

This is equivalent to a baseline \nemission factor of 4.63 tCO2e per year. The entire baseline value is not mitigated because each Euler electric vehicle \nstill consumes 3.65 MWh of electricity per year from the Indian electricity grid, which still uses fossil fuels. If the \n ", "Appendix 1  9 \ntransmission and distribution loss is 20.66% and the emission factor is 0.673 tCO2e/MWh, then the adjusted emission \nfactor is 0.812 tCO2e/MWh for the Indian electricity grid. Applying this to the electricity consumption of a Euler electric \nvehicle, each vehicle generates 2.96 tCO2e per year. Deducting the emissions generated from grid-based charging \nfrom the reduced emissions caused by the displacement of the Bajaj Maximas, each Euler electric vehicle will mitigate \na net value of 1.66 tCO2e per year. Applying a 10-year life cycle to each Euler electric vehicle, the targeted 900,000 \nvehicles sold from 2021 to 2037 would mitigate 9.6 million tCO2e for this period. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n     \n ", "Appendix 2  11 \nLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \n \nConfidential Information Deleted. \n \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "Asian Development Bank", "CreationDate": "D:20210601144957+08'00'", "Creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word for Microsoft 365", "Keywords": "india, adb ventures investment, euler motors, electric vehicles, l5 vehicles, climate change, equity financing, livable cities, 55075-001, adb projects, terms and conditions, board approval, rrp, approved projects, recommendations of the president", "ModDate": "D:20210602094011+08'00'", "Producer": "Microsoft\u00ae Word for Microsoft 365", "Subject": "The investment will improve the uptake of electric vehicles in India and minimize the use of diesel vehicles for intra-city cargo deliveries.
