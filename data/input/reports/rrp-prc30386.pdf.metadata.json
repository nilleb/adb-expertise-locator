An initial environmental examination was undertaken\nand is included under the Supplementary Appendixes.\n\nthe \n\ninterconnection  by  extending \n\nThe  northeast  power  region  of  the  PRC  comprises  the  provinces\nof  Jilin,  Heilongjiang,  and  Liaoning  and  the  Inner  Mongolia\nAutonomous  Region.  Mine-mouth  coal-fired  power  generating\nplants  are  located  in  the  sparsely  populated,  northern  Inner\nMongolia Autonomous Region, while the energy-consuming areas\nare  mainly  in  the  industrial  south  of  Liaoning  Province.  Hence,\nconsiderable  benefit  can  be  realized  by  interconnecting  the  north\nand  the  south.  The  first  part  of  such  interconnection  from\nHeilongjiang  Province  to  Shenyang  in  Liaoning  Province  was\ncompleted  in  June  2001  under  a  1997  ADB  loan.1  The  proposed\nthe\nProject  will  complete \ntransmission  line  further  south.  The  Project  will  increase  the\ncapacity  and  efficiency  of  electricity  transmission  from  Shenyang\nto  Dalian  in  Liaoning  Province,  thereby  increasing  the  availability\nand reliability of electricity supply in the province. It will also result\nin  an  integrated  regional  grid  that  will  facilitate  the  establishment\nof  a  regional  competitive  power  market  as  envisaged  by  the\nGovernment.  The  rural  poor  will  particularly  benefit  through  the\nrehabilitation  of  rural  electrification  networks  in  three  poverty\ncounties  and  one  poverty  city,  which  will  decrease  the  costs  of\nelectricity  supply  to  these  areas  by  15\u201320  percent  through\nefficiency  gains  and  will  enable  a  decrease  in  tariffs  for  rural\nareas.  As  agreed  upon  under  the  Project\u2019s  tariff  reform  action\nplan,  the  tariffs  for  all  rural  areas  in  Liaoning  Province  will  be\nreduced and brought in line with urban tariffs by December 2004.\n\nThe  principal  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  increase  the  capacity\nand efficiency of electricity transmission from the northeastern part\nof  the  PRC  to  the  southern  part  of  Liaoning  Province,  thereby\nincreasing  the  availability  of  electricity  and  the  reliability  of  the\nelectricity  transmission  and  distribution  systems  in  Liaoning\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n1  Loan 1582-PRC: Northeast Power Transmission Project, for $150 million, approved on 25 November 1997.\n\n                  \n\n\fii\n\nProvince  and  avoiding  harmful  emissions  associated  with  new\npower  generation  in  the  densely  populated  southern  part  of\nLiaoning Province. Other objectives are to complete the upgrading\nand  expansion  of  rural  electrification  in  the  relatively  poor  rural\nareas of Liaoning Province, and to develop an integrated regional\ngrid  that  will  enable  restructuring  of  the  power  sector  in  Liaoning\nProvince. The Project will include (i) construction and upgrading of\nrural  electrification\ntransmission \nupgrading  and  expansion  in  three  poverty  counties  and  one\npoverty city (including the provision of energy-efficient lighting for\nthe  poor),  (iii)  upgrading  of  urban  electricity  distribution  in\nShenyang and Dalian, (iv) consulting services, (v) training, and (vi)\nclosure of coal-fired power generation units in Liaoning Province.\n\nlines  and  substations, \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $475  million  equivalent,\ncomprising  a  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $100  million  (21  percent)\nand a local currency cost of $375 million equivalent (79 percent).\n\nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  a  $100  million\nloan  to  finance  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  of  the  Project.\nThe  remaining  local  currency  cost  of  $375  million  equivalent  will\nbe  financed  by  the  Executing  Agency\u2019s  (EA)  internal  sources  of\n$135  million  and  a  domestic  loan  of  $240  million  equivalent  from\nthe China Construction Bank.\n\nADB\u2019s  $100 million  loan  from  ordinary  capital  resources  will\n have a repayment period of 24 years, including a grace period of\n4 years,  with  interest  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nLondon  Interbank  Overnight  Rate  (LIBOR)  based  lending  rate\nsystem  for  US  dollar  loans,  a  front-end  fee  of  1  percent,  and  a\ncommitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum in accordance with\nthe  current  ADB  policy.

Advance  procurement  action  has\nbeen approved by ADB.\n\nInternational  consulting  services  for  30  person-months  will  be\nprovided to assist the EA with project implementation including its\nreview of the draft tender documents and its evaluation of the bids\nreceived.  International  and  domestic  consulting  services  of  about\n31 person-months will be provided for undertaking a power market\ndevelopment  study.  All  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants\nand  other  arrangements  for  the  selection  and  engagement  of\ndomestic consultants. Advance recruitment action and retroactive\nfinancing of the consulting services have been approved by ADB.\n\nThe  Project will  improve  the efficiency and reliability of electricity\ntransmission  and  distribution  in  Liaoning  Province.  It  will  also\nprovide  environmental  and  health  benefits \nthrough  avoided\nemissions from (i) obviating additional coal-fired power generation\nthat  would  otherwise  be  required  in  the  vicinity  of  Dalian  in  the\nsouthern part of Liaoning Province; (ii) decreased use of firewood,\nstraw, and coal by poor households as a result of more affordable\nelectricity supply; and (iii) closure of inefficient and polluting coal-\nfired power generation units.  Over its lifetime the Project will help\nreduce and avoid emissions in the project area of about 324,600\ntons  of  sulfur  dioxide,  164,600  tons  of  nitrogen  oxides,  215,100\ntons of particulates, and 44.53 million tons of carbon dioxide. The\nrural poor will particularly benefit through the rehabilitation of rural\nelectrification networks in three poverty counties and one poverty\ncity,  which  will  decrease  the  cost  of  electricity  supply  to  these\nareas  by  15\u201320  percent  through  efficiency  gains,  which  will  be\nshared with the rural residents including the rural poor in the form\nof lower tariffs. The economic and financial internal rates of return\nfor  the  Project  are  satisfactory  at  18.5  percent  and  9.2  percent,\nrespectively.  The  Project\u2019s  poverty  impact  ratio  is  estimated  at\n17.3 percent. The envisaged decrease in rural tariffs to bring them\nin line with urban tariffs will result in (i) increased consumption of\nelectricity in rural areas and (ii) household savings. In the medium\nterm  this  could  lead  to  an  increase  of  19.2  percent  in  per  capita\nincome for the rural poor in Liaoning Province between 2003 and\n2007.  Further,  provision  of  energy-efficient  light  bulbs  to  about\n100,000 poor households will reduce their electricity consumption\nfor lighting by about 30 percent.\n\n\fi\nv\n\f1.\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  a  proposed\nloan  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Shen-Da  Power  Transmission  and  Grid\nRehabilitation Project.\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe PRC is the second largest electricity producer in the world after the United States.\n2.\nCoal accounts for about three quarters of the PRC\u2019s thermal power generation. The continued\ndominance  of  coal  in  power  generation  has  contributed  to  unacceptably  high  levels  of  air\npollution, resulting in health problems and increasing mortality rates, degenerating ecosystems,\ndecreasing crop yields, and increasing emissions of greenhouse gases and occurrences of acid\nrain.  To  optimize  the  availability  and  use  of  generation  capacity  and  increase  the  efficiency  of\nelectricity  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution,  the  Government  is  upgrading  and\nextending  power \ninterregional\ninterconnections,  and  strengthening  urban  and  rural  distribution  systems.  This  will  help  to\nreduce  the  use  of  coal  for  power  generation  and  develop  the  electricity  transmission  and\ndistribution infrastructure that is required for establishing competitive power generation markets.\n\ntransmission  systems,  particularly \n\ninterprovincial  and \n\nDuring  the  1999  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  requested  Asian\n3.\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) assistance for providing a high-voltage transmission system between\nthe  cities  of  Shenyang  and  Dalian  in  Liaoning  Province  and  for  the  rehabilitation  of  electricity\ndistribution  systems  in  the  two  cities  and  the  surrounding  rural  areas.  In  response  to  this\nrequest, in December 1999 ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance to examine\nthe  feasibility  of  the  Project.1  Following  completion  of  the  project  preparation  studies  in  March\n2001, the Fact-Finding Mission visited the PRC in April 2001, followed by the Appraisal Mission\nin June 2001, to discuss the Project with the Government and the Executing Agency (EA). The\nlinkages  of  the  policies,  institutional  framework,  physical  investments,  and  objectives  of  the\nProject are described in the project framework (Appendix 1). The Project\u2019s primary objective is\neconomic growth.\n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA. \n\nSector Description\n\n1.   \n\nEnergy Sector\n\n4.\nAnnual  per  capita  energy  consumption  in  the  PRC  is  relatively  low  at  0.66  tons  of  oil\nequivalent (toe) in 2000, about 40 percent of the world average. The energy intensity rate is still\nquite  high,  about  0.78  toe  per  $1,000  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  or  roughly  twice  the\naverage for both ADB developing and developed member countries. Energy intensity declined\nduring the 1990s, when GDP grew by 9.7 percent per year and energy consumption grew at 2.3\npercent per year. As a result, the energy intensity index2 dropped from 61.4 in 1990 to 30.3 in\n2000, reflecting changes in economic structure and sources of industrial value added, as well as\nenergy  efficiency  improvements.  The  relatively  high  energy  and  intensity  index  is  mainly\nattributable to (i) the  legacy  of  the  inappropriate pricing regime with inadequate market-based\n\n                  \n\nDecember 1999.\n\n1 TA  3346-PRC:  Shen-Da Power Transmission and Grid Rehabilitation Project,  for  $700,000,  approved  on  17\n\n2  Expressed as unit of energy consumed per unit of GDP in 1978 constant prices, with the index set at 100 for 1978.\n\n\f2\n\nsignals  for  energy  conservation,  (ii) an  energy-intensive  industry  sector  that  accounts  for  a\nrelatively high share of GDP, (iii) a poor fuel consumption mix, (iv) the use of obsolete industrial\ntechnologies, and (v) poor energy management.\n\n2.\n\nPower Sector\n\na.\n\nGeneral\n\nBy the end of 2000, the installed capacity was 316 gigawatts (GW) and annual electricity\n5.\ngeneration was 1,350  terawatt-hours (TWh). Thermal power contributes about three quarters of\nthe  installed  generating  capacity,  hydropower  about  one  quarter,  and  nuclear  power  about  1\npercent.  Every  year  since  1988,  11\u201317  GW  of  generating  capacity  has  been  added.3  During\n1985\u20131995, the annual average growth in electricity consumption was 9.1 percent. The growth\nslowed  to  7.1  percent  in  1996  and  fell  to  4.4  in  1997  and  2.8  percent  in  1998.  However,\nelectricity consumption grew by 5.9 percent in 1999 and by 9.7 percent in 2000. The temporary\ndeclines in electricity demand growth between 1997 and 1999 partly reflected the impact of the\nAsian  economic  crisis  and  a  structural  shift  in  the  economy  that  moderated  the  growth  of\nelectricity consumption.\n\n6.\nThe 2000 per capita annual electricity consumption of 1,064 kilowatt-hours (kWh) places\nthe PRC at the average level of per capita electricity consumption in ADB\u2019s developing member\ncountries.4  Industries  consume  the  most  electricity.  Heavy  industry  consumed  58  percent,\nfollowed  by  light  industry  (14 percent),  residential  consumers  (12   percent),  public  and\ncommercial  consumers  (8   percent),  agriculture  (6  percent),  and \ntransportation  and\ntelecommunications (2 percent). Since 1985, the relative shares of industry and agriculture have\ndeclined,  while  those  of  residential,  public,  and  commercial  consumers  have  increased.  About\n98 percent  of  the  nation\u2019s  villages  and  97  percent  of  the  rural  population  have  access  to\nelectricity, although the service is usually very inefficient and of uneven quality.\n\nb.   \n\nPricing\n\n7.\nElectricity tariffs are set separately in each province. Tariff proposals are prepared jointly\nby the provincial power companies and the provincial governments (mainly the provincial price\nadministration  bureaus)  and  submitted  to  the  Government  for  approval  by  the  State\nDevelopment  and  Planning  Commission.  Tariffs  generally  have  three  components:  (i) the\nstate  catalogue  price,  (ii)  guidance  price  differential,  and  (iii) surcharges.  The  state  catalogue\nprice is calculated to recover power generation costs, financed through government grants (all\nplants built before 1985) and, in some cases, loans from the Government for plants built after\n1985. Electricity is sold at a guidance price from power plants that have been financed through\njoint  investments  by  central,  provincial,  and  local  governments;  plants  of  independent  power\nproducers; and plants that are owned by local governments or industries and sell surplus power\nto the grid. This guidance price is based on full cost recovery including debt repayment and a\nreasonable  return  on  investment.  Several  surcharges  are  levied  on  the  various  consumer\ncategories,  primarily  for  different  types  of  investment  funds  for  the  power  sector,  the  most\nimportant  being  (i)  the  provincial  and  local  government  power  investment  surcharges,  which\nraise  funds  for  special  projects  (e.g.,  for  the  Three  Gorges  project);  and  (ii)  local  fees  to  raise\n\n3 This is equivalent to adding the existing installed capacity of countries such as Belgium, Finland, and Netherlands\n\n                  \n\n4 Compared with Malaysia, 1,636 kWh; Thailand, 1,023 kWh; Philippines, 419 kWh; India, 325 kWh; and Sri Lanka,\n\neach in one year.\n\n224 kWh.\n\n\f3\n\nfunds  for  distribution  system  investment.  Surcharges  usually  account  for  6\u201315  percent  of  the\naverage tariff.\n\n8.\nBefore  1985,  electricity  tariffs  in  the  PRC  remained  at  a  relatively  low  level  for  many\nyears,  averaging  about  Y0.07  per  kWh.  Beginning  in  1985,  the  tariffs  were  increased  in\nresponse  to  price  increases  in  fuel  and  other  capital  and  operating  costs.  However,  the  tariff\nadjustments had several shortcomings, as a result of which tariff systems were complicated and\nunfair  to  different  consumer  categories  and  to  similar  consumers  in  different  localities.  The\nGovernment  considers  tariff  reform  to  be  of  primary  importance  for  the  development  of  the\npower  industry.  Unification  of  tariffs  to  ensure  charging,  on  a  cost  recovery  basis,  the  same\nprice  for  the  same  quality  of  electricity  to  a  given  class  of  consumer  in  a  particular  grid  is  an\nimportant objective. Since 1999, substantial progress has been made in tariff reform with regard\nto  unification  of  end-consumer  tariff  at  the  provincial  level,  rationalization  of  consumer\ncategories to create a separate commercial tariff category, and elimination of surcharges.\n\n9.\nThe  Government  is  using  a  combination  of  administrative  controls  and  market-based\nreforms to improve energy end-use efficiency. The administrative measures include reductions\nin planned allocations of energy to major industrial users; tightening energy consumption norms;\nstricter application of such norms, with bonuses and penalties; and closing of inefficient plants.\nAt  present  the  Government  gives  priority  to  market-based  incentives,  including  price  reforms,\nand  is  aiming  to  achieve  further  gains  in  energy  end-use  efficiency  through  implementing\nstructural  adjustments  in  the  industry  sector,  promoting  the  upgrading  of  technology,  and\nstrengthening energy management.\n\nTransmission  tariffs  are  not  clearly  defined  in  the  PRC.  The  retail  tariffs  to  consumers\n10.\nare not adequate to provide a reasonable return on transmission and distribution infrastructure\nand are not guided by principles of cost recovery, transparency, and nondiscrimination. A sound\nmethodology  to  determine  transmission  tariffs  needs  to  be  developed  to  eliminate  the  current\narbitrariness  in  levying  such  tariffs.  Although  the  problems  related  to  transmission  tariffs  are\nminimal,  since  the  retail  tariffs  are  bundled,  the  transmission  pricing  method  needs  to  be\ncompatible with the power market design, which will be eventually introduced. The transmission\npricing that provides adequate financial returns and economic pricing signals is to be balanced\nwith social equity issues associated with the use of the transmission and distribution networks.\n\n3.\n\nEnvironment\n\nThe  PRC  has  severe  environmental  problems,  primarily  air  and  water  pollution\n11.\nassociated  with  rapid  economic  growth  and  the  use  of  coal.    Estimates  of  economic  losses\ncaused  by  pollution  range  from  3.5\u20138.3 percent  of  GDP.  Based  on  a  study  by  the  Policy\nResearch  Center  for  Environment  and  Economy  of  the  State  Environmental  Protection\nAdministration, pollution in the early 1990s caused annual economic losses of Y99 billion (about\n4 percent of GDP), with air pollution accounting for 59 percent; water pollution, 36 percent; and\nsolid waste, 5 percent.\n\nThe high economic losses reflect waste and inefficiency in the utilization of energy, raw\n12.\nmaterials, and other resources in the production of goods and services. This is partly a legacy of\nthe past practice of locating industrial enterprises in urban centers, and inappropriate regulatory\nmeasures  and  pricing  policies  that  did  not  provide  adequate  incentives  for  conservation  and\nenvironment-friendly behavior. Depending on the industry, 30\u201370 percent of industrial pollution\nis  linked  to  waste  and  inefficiency  resulting  from  the  use  of  obsolete  technology,  inadequate\nknowledge  of  available  cleaner  technology,  low  levels  of  environmental  awareness,  and  poor\n\n\f4\n\nenterprise  management.  Use  of  energy  and  raw  materials  will  continue  to  grow  in  the  PRC  in\ntandem with economic growth. Unless better technologies are used, switching to cleaner fuels is\nencouraged,  and  use  of  renewable  energy  is  increased  in  a  major  way,  environmental  quality\nwill continue to deteriorate and related economic losses will increase.\n\nand \n\nThe  PRC's  heavy  reliance  on  coal  as  its  primary  fuel  for  industrial  production,  power\n13.\nand\ngeneration, \nheating(cid:190)\ncontributes  significantly  to  emissions  of  sulfur  dioxide  (SO2)  and  total  suspended\nparticulates (TSP), and high levels of urban air pollution. Air quality is poor in most of the PRC\u2019s\nindustrial cities.\n\napplications(cid:190) mainly \n\ncommercial \n\nresidential \n\ncooking \n\nand \n\n14.\nEmissions of major air pollutants peaked in 1995 and have declined since then. Airborne\nconcentrations  of  TSP,  SO2,  and  nitrogen  oxides  (NOx)  often  substantially  surpass\nenvironmental standards.5 The social cost of this pollution is high. Over 400 million people live in\ncities,  and  this  number  is  expected  to  double  by  2010.  Annual  premature  (compared  with  life\nexpectancy)  deaths  related  to  excessively  high  TSP  concentrations  are  currently  estimated  at\n150,000  in  urban  areas.  Chronic  pulmonary  diseases  linked  to  TSP  exposure  are  a  leading\ncause of death among urban residents, accounting for 9.1 deaths per 10,000 people, about five\ntimes  more  than  in  the  United  States.  The  combustion  of  coal  in  small  boilers,  mainly  for\ncommercial and residential use, is responsible for a significant portion of total air pollution. To\ncombat air pollution from such sources, the Government gives priority to (i) developing district\nheating systems to replace individual coal combustion for residential heating; (ii) developing gas\nsupply  networks  to  replace  coal  combustion  with  a  cleaner  form  of  energy  for  household\ncooking  and,  in  some  instances,  heating;  (iii)  introducing  clean  coal  technologies  and  other\nenvironment-friendly technologies for power generation; and (iv) developing mine-mouth, coal-\nfired  power  plants.  The  introduction  of  advanced  clean  coal  technologies  such  as  pressurized\nfluidized  bed  combustion  and  integrated  coal  gasification  combined-cycle  technology  is  being\nconsidered.6  In  April  2000,  the  Prevention  of  Air  Pollution  Law  was  amended,  enabling  the\nGovernment  to  take  effective  measures  to  encourage  and  support  scientific  research  and\ntechnology  development  for  the  prevention  and  control  of  air  pollution.7  Implementation  of  the\nlaw began in September 2000.\n\n                  \n\n5 From 1991 to 1998 the median concentration of TSP in the 32 largest cities decreased from 334 micrograms (m g)\nper  cubic  meter  (m3)  to  309  m g/m3,  and  in  28  smaller  cities  from  260  m g/m3  to  215  m g/m3;  however,  these\nconcentrations are at best still 2.5\u20133.5 times higher than the guidelines of the World Health Organization of 60-90\nm g/m3, and in 2000, about 62 percent of 338 monitored cities had an average annual value of TSP that exceeded\nthe  applicable  national  standard.  From  1991  to  1998,  the  ambient  concentration  of  SO2  in  32  cities  (with  a\npopulation of more than 1 million) decreased from 100 m g/m3 to 62 m g/m3 while in another 28 medium and large\ncities (with a population between 280,000 and 970,000) it decreased from 50 m g/m3, to 32 m g/m3; however, in 2000,\nabout 21 percent of the monitored cities had an ambient concentration of SO2 that exceeded the applicable national\nstandard From 1991 to 1998, the median concentration of NOx in the 32 largest cities increased to 57 m g/m3, and it\nnow exceeds the Government standard for urban areas of not more than 50 m g/m3.\n\n6 Under TA 2793-PRC: A Study on Clean Coal Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle Technology, for $500,000,\n\napproved on 19 May 1997, ADB helped assess suitable technologies.\n\n7 The law provides a legal basis for adopting the total load control strategy to reduce air pollution. It specifies the key\npollutants for total load control (including SO2), and establishes principles for total load allocation among polluting\nsources  and  air  emission  permits.  However,  it  does  not  identify  a  mechanism  for  the  transfer  and  trade  of  the\npermits.  A  new  provision  addresses  clean  energy,  specifying  that  \"the  state  encourages  and  supports  the\nexploitation of clean energy such as solar, wind and hydrological power.\"\n\n\f5\n\n4.   \n\nInstitutions and Legal Framework\n\n15.\nDuring  the  past  decade,  the  Government  reorganized  the  energy  sector.  The  objective\nwas  to  improve  governance  by  separating  regulatory  and  operating  responsibilities,  and  then\ncorporatizing the operating entities and using market forces to improve efficiency and promote\nenergy conservation. First, the Ministry of Energy was disbanded and replaced with the Ministry\nof  Electric  Power  (MEP);  the  Ministry  of  Coal  Industry;  and  two  corporations  looking  after\npetroleum  and  natural  gas.  Subsequent  administrative  reforms  aimed  at  improving  the\noperational efficiency of the power industry led to MEP restructuring with the establishment of\nthe State Power Corporation (SP) in January 1997. In March 1998, MEP was abolished and SP\nwas designated as the agency responsible for power sector enterprise functions.8 The sector\u2019s\nregulatory  and  policy  functions  are  the  responsibility  of  the  State  Economic  and  Trade\nCommission, which has similar responsibility for the petroleum and coal sectors, as well as the\ncountry\u2019s energy conservation program. Until the mid-1990s, the power sector was governed by\nlaws,  administrative  rules  and  regulations,  and  policy  circulars  that  were  not  well  coordinated.\nTo address this problem, the Electric Power Law was approved in December 1995 and became\neffective in April 1996. This law was a major step in making the legal and regulatory framework\nfor the sector more transparent.9\n\nB.    Government Policies and Plans\n\n1.   \n\nPoverty Reduction Strategy\n\n16.\nThe  Government  is  making  major  efforts  to  reduce  the  imbalance  in  economic\ndevelopment between the increasingly prosperous coastal provinces and the poorer central and\nwestern  regions.  In  the  PRC,  poverty  has  largely  been  a  rural  phenomenon.  By  pursuing  a\nstrategy  to  raise  living  standards  and  incomes  in  the  poorer  rural  areas  through  Government\ninvestments  and  subsidies  in  land  development,  rural  works,  rural  energy  supply,  and  rural\nenterprises, the PRC has made commendable progress in reducing absolute rural poverty from\n260 million in 1978 to 30 million in 2001 using the PRC definition of rural poverty.10 In the power\nsector the Government is planning to establish more coal-fired power plants in the central and\nwestern  regions  to  create  economic  activity  and  jobs  and  export  the  power  to  the  coastal\nregions,  which  will  require  the  construction  of  additional  transmission  lines.  Since  1997,  there\nhas  been  growing  concern  about  urban  poverty  in  the  PRC.  This  reflects  growing  urban\nunemployment  brought  about  by  industrial  enterprise  reforms  and  government  downsizing,  in\nparticular, retrenchment of excess employees of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). By the end of\n2000 there were about 6 million unemployed workers and about 6.5 million laid-off workers who\nbecame  unemployed.  Around  600  cities  and  1,200  counties  have  established  programs  to\nensure minimum living expenses. ADB TA has been provided to the Government for developing\nan  analytical  framework  for  addressing  the  increasing  urban  poverty.11  Since  1995,  ADB  has\nbeen providing TAs for the development of the Government\u2019s Social Security Reform Program,\nwhich  aims  to  improve  the  income  security  for  pensioners  and  the  institutional  capacity  and\n\n                  \n\n8 At the same time, the Ministry of Coal Industry was also abolished and at present, the administrative supervision of\n\nthe coal sector has been delegated to the provinces.\n\n9 The  Company  Law  of  1994  covers  the  legal  status,  rights,  and  obligations  of  power  groups  and  companies,  and\n\npromotes the use of solar, wind, geothermal, and biomass energy for power generation.\n\n10 The PRC defines the poverty line as an annual income of Y625 per capita, which provides for the minimum level of\n\nsubsistence in rural areas. This is well below the international level of $1 per day.\n11 TA 3377-PRC: Urban Poverty Study, for $410,000, approved on 27 December 1999.\n\n\f6\n\nadministrative  efficiency  of  the  social  safety  net  to  protect  both  urban  and  rural  poor  who  are\nunemployed and need some minimum income support.12\n\n17. \nTo  coordinate  poverty  reduction  efforts  in  rural  areas,  poverty  reduction  offices  have\nbeen  established  at  the  provincial,  municipal,  and  county  levels.  Over  the  past  two  decades\ncentral,  provincial,  municipal,  and  county  governments  have  been  providing  subsidies,\ninvestments,  and  other  assistance  to  poverty  counties  such  as  direct  financial  support,\nmicrocredit, building materials, livestock, and seeds, which has helped raise the average annual\nper capita income in the national poverty counties from Y206 in 1985 to Y1,347 in 1999. During\n1994-2000 this was implemented under the Government\u2019s National 8-7 Poverty Reduction Plan,\nwhich aimed to enable the 80 million absolute rural poor, using the PRC definition ( footnote 10),\nto meet their basic human needs within seven years. As a result, the number of such absolute\nrural poor had decreased to about 30 million in 2001.\n\n18.\nIn  Liaoning  Province,  the  provincial,  municipal,  and  county  governments  provide  about\nY50 million a year for poverty reduction in the nine national poverty counties. In addition, poor\nhouseholds in these poverty counties and the two provincial poverty counties receive about Y8\nmillion a year in microcredit funds. Provincial, municipal, and county governments allocate these\nmicrocredit  funds  from  their  fiscal  revenues.  The  microcredit  funds  are  provided  mainly  to\nwomen\u2019s  groups,  which  use  them  for  animal  breeding  (such  as  geese),  crop  planting,\nconstruction of greenhouses, and processing of agricultural products. \n\n2.\n\nEnergy Sector Strategy\n\nOne of the Government\u2019s main objectives for energy sector development up to 2020 is to\n19.\nreduce the growth of coal consumption and the environmental pollution that such consumption\ncauses. The Government is promoting (i) the introduction of clean coal technologies throughout\nthe  entire  process  of  coal  production,  handling,  transportation,  and  consumption;  (ii) where\npossible,  substitution  of  coal  by  natural  gas,  hydropower,  and  renewable  energy;  and  (iii)\ndemand-side  management  to  decrease  the  growth  rate  in  energy  consumption.13  Under  its\nTenth  Five-Year  Plan  (TFYP),  2001-2005,  the  Government  is  planning  to  accelerate,  in\nparticular, the development and utilization of natural gas. For this purpose the  Government is\nplanning  to  undertake  (together  with  private  investors)  major  gas  infrastructure  projects,\nincluding  the  construction  of  (i)  long  distance  transmission  pipelines  to  transport  natural  gas\nfrom known gas fields in the western part of the country to the coastal provinces in the east,14\n\n                  \n\n12 TA  2383-PRC: Fiscal and Regulatory Framework for Social Security System Reform, for $540,000, approved on\n23 August 1995; TA 3148-PRC: Pension Reform, for $2.4 million, approved on 28 December 1998; TA 3279-PRC:\nDevelopment of Economic Laws,  for  $1.4  million,  approved  on  19  October  1999;  and  TA  3302-PRC:  Capacity\nBuilding for the Insurance Sector Regulatory and Supervision System,  for  $700,000,  approved  on  23  November\n1999.  ADB  is  also  supporting  social  security  reforms  under  the  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan  (TFYP)  through  TA  3607-\nPRC:  Policy Support for Social Security Reform under Tenth Five-Year Plan,  for  $150,000,  approved  on  21\nDecember 2000; and TA 3733-PRC: Policy and Institutional Support for the Social Security Reform Pilot Program,\nfor  $1.0  million,  approved  on  2  October  2001.  Further  TA  is  envisaged  in  2003  for Social Security Reform II, for\n$1.0 million.\n\n13 The  United  Nations  Development  Programme  and  the  Global  Environment  Facility  are  preparing  a  10-year  End\nUse Energy Efficiency Program with, as its main objective, the removal of existing barriers to the implementation of\nenergy  efficiency  and  energy  conservation  efforts  in  specific  end-use  sectors  of  the  PRC  (industry,  buildings,\ntransport, and possibly power).\n\n14 Including  pipelines  (i)  from  Zhongxian  in  Sichuan  Province  to  Wuhan  in  Hunan  Province  and  Shanghai,  (ii) from\nShanganning in Shaanxi Province to Xinyang in Hebei Province and Shanghai, (iii) from the Qaidam basin fields in\nQinghai Province to Lanzhou in Gansu Province, and (iv) from the Tarim basin fields in the Xinjiang Autonomous\nRegion to Lanzhou in Gansu Province and Xi\u2019an in Shaanxi Province. The pipelines are expected to be operational\nby early 2005.\n\n\f7\n\nand (ii) a terminal and related facilities at Shenzhen in Guangdong Province for the importation\nof liquefied natural gas.15 Natural gas consumption is projected to quadruple from 25 billion m3\nper annum at present to 100 billion m3 per annum by 2010. This will require investments of more\nthan $50 billion in new gas infrastructure, and will increase the natural gas share in the primary\ncommercial  energy  mix  from  2.4  percent  at  present  to  4\u20136  percent.  At  present,  natural  gas  in\nthe  PRC  is  not  being  used  for  commercial  power  generation,  and  it  is  envisaged  that  the\nincrease in gas consumption will be utilized largely for power generation. Although the share of\nnatural  gas  will  still  be  modest,  the  planned  75  billion  m3  per  annum  increase  in  natural  gas\nconsumption  will  reduce  coal  consumption  by  155  million  tons  per  annum,  SO2  emissions  by\n2.2 million tons per annum, TSP emissions by 0.7 million tons per annum, carbon dioxide (CO2)\nemissions by 52 million tons per annum, and solid waste by about 26 million tons per annum.\n\nThe  Government  will  develop  renewable  energy  to  (i) diversify  power  generation,  (ii)\n20.\naccelerate rural development, (iii) develop sustainable resources, and (iv) derive environmental\nbenefits.  However,  compared  with  the  available  potential,  the  PRC's  renewable  energy\nprogram  is  relatively  small.  At  present,  only  about  18.7  GW  of  renewable  energy  capacity\n(mostly  in  the  form  of  small  hydropower  plants)  has  been  harnessed  out  of  an  estimated\npotential  of  more  than  350 GW.  The  Government\u2019s  Program  on  New  and  Renewable  Energy\nDevelopment  (1996-2010)  aims  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  renewable  energy  technologies,\nreduce  production  costs,  and  increase  the  use  of  renewable  energy.  Among  other  things,  it\ntargets  a  cumulative  capacity  of  400  megawatts  (MW)  of  grid-connected  wind  farms  by  2000,\nand 1,500 MW by 2010. Although the target for 2000 has not been met, with only about 265 MW\nof  grid-connected  wind  farms  by  the  end  of  2000,  that  for  2010  will  most  likely  be  surpassed,\ngiven  the  measures  contemplated  by  the  Government.16  During  the  TFYP,  the  Government\nintends to gradually introduce the requirement that a certain share of the electricity supplied to\nconsumers  be  generated  from  renewable  energy  resources,  thus  maintaining  their  present\nshare  in  the  generation  mix.  Initially  this  would  be  introduced  at  the  national  level,  and\nsubsequently  passed  on  to  provincial  electricity  grid  levels.  About  18 GW  of  new  renewable\nenergy  capacity  would  need  to  be  added  until  2010  to  achieve  this  target.  Such  a  policy  will\ncreate  a  secure  long-term  market  for  renewable  energy  resources,  attractive  to  investors.17\nSupport  for  the  development  of  grid-connected  wind  farms  and  increased  use  of  wind-based\nelectricity was provided by ADB with cofinancing from the Global Environment Facility (GEF).18\nIn 2001, the World Bank and GEF are planning to provide support under their China renewable\nenergy scale-up project for the implementation of a national policy framework that would legally\nrequire  a  certain  share  of  electricity  supply  to  be  met  from  renewable  resources.19  However,\nseveral  more  years  will  likely  be  required  before  the  appropriate  regulatory  and  policy\nframework  is  established  to  meet  a  portfolio  standard  that  a  certain  share  of  the  electricity\ngenerated is produced from renewable energy.\n\n                  \n\n15 The terminal is expected to be able to receive and vaporize about 3 million tons of liquefied natural gas per annum,\n\nproviding about 4 billion m3 per annum of natural gas for consumption in Guangdong Province.\n\n16 In addition, under its Brightness Program, the Government aims to provide off-grid electricity to 23 million people by\n\n2010 by installing small wind turbines with a capacity of 300 watts or less, and photovoltaic systems.\n\n17 Required  investments  are  estimated  at  more  than  $8  billion  up  to  2005  and  at  $12  billion  for  2005\u20132010;  for\nfinancing the projected increase in wind-based power generation, more than $1.7 billion will be required until 2005,\nand $3.0 billion from 2005 until 2010 (based on a capital cost of $1,000 per kilowatt).\n\n18 Loan 1818-PRC, Wind Power Development Project, for $58 million, approved on 20 December 2000.\n19 This assistance is seen as a pilot for the World Bank-GEF Strategic Partnership for Renewables in the PRC and\nincludes a GEF grant of $140 million and World Bank financing of $100 million, which is to be matched by about\n$155 million of private and other financing.\n\n\f8\n\n3.\n\nPower Sector Strategy\n\nthrough \n\nThe  Government\u2019s  main  objective  in  the  power  sector  during  the  Ninth  Five-Year  Plan\n21.\n(NFYP),  1996\u20132000,  was  to  increase  investment  in  power  facilities  to  support  the  country\u2019s\neconomic growth and improve access to electricity. Given that the demand for additional power\nis  largely  being  met,  emphasis  has  shifted  to  (i) rationalizing  power  tariffs  to  reflect  economic\ncosts;  (ii)  improving  efficiency  and  reducing  emissions  of  existing  power  plants;20  (iii)\nrestructuring  the  sector  to  encourage  competitive  markets,  and  commercialization  and\ncorporatization  of  power  utilities;  (iv) improving  power  transmission  and  distribution,  including\nrural  electrification,21  and  (v) diversifying  financing  for  power  development,  including  private\nthe  build-own-operate  and  build-own-transfer  approaches,\nsector  participation \nshareholding,  and  other  modes.  Under  the  TFYP,  the  Government  will  give  priority  to  (i)\ninterconnecting  electricity  transmission  grids  to  establish  three  integrated  grid  corridors  in  the\nnorth, the middle, and the south of the country to transfer electricity from the west to the east;22\n(ii) establishing mine-mouth coal-fired power plants; (iii) rehabilitating urban and rural electricity\ndistribution networks; (iv) closing small thermal power plants; (v) developing hydropower in the\nwest; (vi) restructuring and deregulating23 the power sector; and (vii) effecting tariff reform. The\nGovernment has established an interministerial task force headed by SDPC to finalize the policy\nfor restructuring the power sector, which will aim at increasing efficiency in the sector through\nthe establishment of regional electricity markets. This new policy is expected to be announced\nbefore the end of 2001. ADB's operations in the PRC will support the Government\u2019s agenda for\nthe power sector in the coming years (para. 38).\n\n4. \n\nEnvironmental Strategy\n\n22.\nThe Government's environment sector objectives are to (i) bring environmental pollution\nunder control, (ii) improve the quality of the environment in major cities, (iii) reduce degradation\nof  natural  ecological  systems,  and  (iv)  integrate  environmental  planning  with  economic  and\nsocial  development  efforts.  Under  the  NFYP  the  Government's  main  environmental  objective\nwas  to  arrest  degradation  in  the  environment  by  improving  air  and  water  quality  in  52  major\ncities  where  pollution  is  most  severe.  The  basic  policies  and  guiding  principles  included\npursuing  a  strategy  of  sustainable  development  by  integrating  environmental  protection\nprograms \ninto  national  economic  and  social  planning,  and  establishing  an  effective\nenvironmental  regulatory  framework  and  management  systems  in  both  urban  and  rural  areas.\nThe  aim  was  to  contain  the  worsening  trend  of  environmental  pollution  and  ecosystem\ndegradation, and to improve the environment in some cities to demonstrate that rapid economic\ngrowth  and  a  cleaner  environment  are  compatible.  To  achieve  these  objectives,  the\nGovernment  aimed  to  increase  annual  environment-related  investments  from  0.67  percent  of\nGDP during the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-1990) to 1.3 percent during the NFYP. Although\n\n                  \n\n20 In June 1999, the Government announced the closure of thermal power generating units with a capacity of 50 MW\n\nor less. As a result, about 30,000 MW of small coal-based plants will be decommissioned.\n\n21 ADB is supporting the reform of rural tariffs under TA 3369-PRC: Rural Electricity Study, for $700,000, approved on\n\n26 December 2000. This TA is ongoing and expected to be completed by the end of 2001.\n\n22 ADB  is  supporting  the  establishment  of  such  networks  under  TA  3547-PRC:  Interregional Power Transmission\nDevelopment Strategy,  for  $800,000,  approved  on  16  November  2000.  This  TA  is  ongoing  and  expected  to  be\ncompleted by August 2002.\n\n23 ADB  is  supporting  the  restructuring  of  the  power  sector  under  TA  2917-PRC:  Power Sector Restructuring,  for\n$804,800, approved on 24 November 1997. This TA proposed to the Government a well-structured approach for\nderegulating the power sector.\n\n\f9\n\nthis target was not achieved, environment-related investments increased substantially and were\nequivalent  to  about  0.93  percent  of  GDP  during  the  NFYP.  Whereas  progress  was  made  in\nreducing  air  pollution,  less  progress  was  made  in  addressing  water  pollution,  and  land\ndegradation continued to worsen.\n\n23.\nUnder  the  TFYP,  the  Government  is  planning  to  strengthen  its  control  of  pollutant\ndischarge  through  the  issuance  of  regulations  on  total  pollutant  control  for  selected  cities  and\ndesignated  river  basins  and  regions.  Ecological  protection  will  be  given  importance  equal  to\npollution  control,  and  environmental  protection  of  agriculture  will  be  strengthened.  Sustainable\nurban development will be strengthened through the construction of centralized heating systems\nand  sewage  and  solid  waste  treatment  plants  in  large  and  medium-sized  cities.  Air  quality  in\ncities  is  to  be  improved  through  the  substitution  of  gas  for  coal  where  feasible,  modernization\nand  closing  of  polluting  industries,  and  increased  use  of  technologies  and  fuels  that  minimize\npollution  from  vehicular  emissions.  Also,  automated  air  quality  monitoring  networks  will  be\nestablished in large and medium-sized cities, and continuous monitoring of water quality along\nstretches  of  several  major  rivers  will  begin.  To  achieve  these  objectives,  the  Government  will\nstrengthen  institutional  and  regulatory  frameworks  and  increasingly  introduce  market-based\ninstruments  for  effective  environmental  management.  To  enhance  the  use  of  market-based\ninstruments  for  air  quality  management  in  Shanxi  Province  and  strengthen  the  required\ninstitutional  capabilities  of  the  concerned  provincial  agencies,  ADB  is  providing  TA,24  which  is\nbeing  implemented  and  expected  to  be  completed  by  the  middle  of  2002.  In  this  context,  the\nGovernment  is  also  planning  to  prepare  and  promulgate  a  law  on  environmental  impact\nassessment,  which  will  require  that  strategic  environment  assessments  be  made  for  all\nproposed national planning and policy development activities, and that possible environmental\nimpacts  be  fully  integrated  in  the  decision-making  process.  The  Government\u2019s  overall  goal  for\nimproving air quality is to reduce SO2 emissions in acid rain and SO2 control zones by 2005 by\n20  percent  below  their  2000  levels  and  by  10  percent  on  average  for  the  whole  of  the  PRC.\nAbout  75  percent  of  the  power  generation  capacity  in  the  PRC  uses  fossil  fuels,  and  power\ngeneration is responsible for about 40 percent of air pollution. Under its TFYP, the Government\nis  planning  to  make  annual  environment-related  investments  of  1.3  percent  of  GDP,  which\nwould total about Y360 billion.\n\nC.  External Assistance to the Sector\n\n24.\nBecause of the energy sector\u2019s importance for the national economy, it has been one of\nthe  largest  recipients  of  capital  and  advanced  technology,  financed  from  multilateral  and\nbilateral  sources.  External  sources,  including  direct  foreign  investment,  are  increasingly  being\npromoted  and  now  finance  about  20  percent  of  total  annual  investments  in  the  energy  sector,\nwhich are used mainly in the power sector.\n\nADB has provided 10 public sector loans totalling $1.2 billion for the PRC power sector.\n25.\nThese include three hydropower, four thermal power, and two power transmission projects, and\none renewable energy (grid-connected wind power) project. ADB has made strategic use of TA\nto help prepare projects, provide policy support, and build the institutional capabilities of power\nutilities that are the EAs of ADB loans. Among external agencies, ADB has taken a leading role\nin providing support for (i) corporatizing power utilities, (ii) developing the policy and regulatory\nframeworks for encouraging foreign investment in the power sector, (iii) introducing competitive\nbidding procedures for the selection of build-own-operate and build-own-transfer sponsors, (iv)\n\n24 TA 3325-PRC: Shanxi Air Quality Improvement, for $700,000, approved on 7 December 1999.\n\n                  \n\n\f10\n\nstrengthening  financial  management  of  power  plants,  and  (v)  rationalizing  the  power  tariff\nstructure.\n\n26.\nThe World Bank is the largest official source of external funding for the power sector. As\nof April 2001, it had provided $5.6 billion to finance 23 power projects, most of which are large-\nscale  thermal  power  or  hydropower  projects.  Under  its  2001  program,  the  World  Bank  is\nplanning to support two power projects: one pump storage project in Jiangsu Province and one\nsmall hydropower project in Hubei Province. Its future program is expected to focus mainly on\nrenewable  energy  projects  under  the  World  Bank-GEF  Strategic  Partnership  for  Renewables\n(footnote 19). Recently, the World Bank\u2019s TA for the power sector has been mainly supporting\nthe  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  design  and  implement  detailed  regulatory  procedures  for\nderegulation of the power sector. The United Nations Development Programme is also providing\nassistance to help the Government evaluate various options for power sector restructuring and\nfor promoting energy conservation (footnote 13).\n\n27.\nAmong the bilateral sources, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) is the\nlargest  source  of  external  assistance.  It  has  provided  concessional  loans  totaling  Y438  billion\n($3.6  billion  at  the  current  exchange  rate)  for  14  power  sector  projects  through  its  official\ndevelopment  assistance  window,  excluding  those  assisted  through  export  credits  and  untied\nyen  loans  which  were  provided  by  the  former  Export-Import  Bank  of  Japan.  JBIC  has  also\nprovided  special  credits  to  major  cities,  including  Dalian  and  Shenyang,  to  improve  their\nenvironment through the installation of emission control devices and equipment in power plants\nand  factories,  and  through  building  water  treatment  facilities.  JBIC  is  considering  shifting  its\ntraditional focus of assistance to the power sector from hydro and thermal power generation to\nenergy  conservation  and  renewable  energy,  particularly  in  the  western  region.  Germany,\nthrough  the  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (KfW),  has  provided  approximately  $400  million  in\nmixed  credits  mostly  for  power  plants  and  turbine  modernization  projects.  KfW  has  been  also\nassisting  the  Government  in  energy  efficiency,  providing  credit  lines,  and  renewable  energy\ndevelopment. Other bilateral sources, mostly providing export credits, or mixed credits include\nAustralia, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, and United States.\n\n28. While the huge investment requirements of the PRC\u2019s power sector and the large size of\nthe country provide ample opportunities for the involvement of multiple aid agencies without the\nrisk  of  overlapping  investment,  aid  coordination  among  external  agencies  remains  essential.\nADB  has  established  a  close  working  relationship  with  the  World  Bank  in  addressing  policy\nissues  and  coordinating  lending  and  TA  operations,  and  continues  to  exchange  views  with\nbilateral  sources  and  the  private  sector.  Both  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  have  emphasized  the\nimportance  of \ntariff  reforms,  efficiency\nthe  management  of  power  utilities, \nimprovement,  environmental  protection,  and  a  greater  role  for  the  private  sector.  During  the\nprocessing of the proposed Project, discussions were held with the World Bank, JBIC, and KfW\nto  ensure  that  their  respective  activities  are  complementary  and  to  maintain  consistency  in\npolicy advice.\n\nimproving \n\nD. \n\nLessons Learned\n\n29.\nADB\u2019s experience in the PRC\u2019s energy sector has shown that projects are generally well\nplanned and implemented smoothly. EAs and implementing agencies have personnel with good\ntechnical skills and have made effective use of the training financed under ADB loans to build\ntheir institutional capacity. Compliance with covenants is generally acceptable, although greater\nefforts  are  required  to  implement  the  policy-related  covenants,  particularly  those  relating  to\ndiversification  of  enterprise  ownership  at  the  micro  level  in  line  with  project  commitments  and\n\n\f11\n\npolicy  directions.  The  rigorous  government  screening  of  the  projects  has  a  positive  impact.\nEnergy conservation projects have experienced some delays, mainly because of their complex\nmulticomponent  nature  involving  several  implementing  agencies  in  different  provinces.  Delays\nhave  also  occurred  for  some  projects  in  loan  signing  and  loan  effectiveness,  as  well  as  in\nprocurement,  construction,  and  commissioning.  The  Government  is  streamlining  the  multiple\napproval process to address these problems.\n\n30.\nPower  utilities  have  been  found  to  be  weak  in  the  area  of  commercial  and  financial\nmanagement. Often, there is a need for institutional strengthening in the areas of organizational\nstructure,  delegation  of  authority,  management,  information  and  control  systems,  accounting\nand  financial  management,  and  personnel  development  and  training.  So  far,  4  of  10  public\npower  sector  projects  financed  by  ADB  in  the  PRC  have  been  completed;  these  are  the  Fuel\nConversion Project,25 Shanxi Liulin Thermal Power Project,26 Hunan Lingjintan Power Project,27\nand  Henan  Power  Project.28  The  project  completion  and  project  performance  audit  reports  for\nthese projects indicate that they were implemented smoothly, and assess them all as generally\nsuccessful. Some cost increases as well as minor delays were noted. Recommendations from\nthe experience gained highlight (i) the need to improve financial reporting; (ii) the need for more\nattention  to  environmental  matters;  (iii)  the  advisability  of  using  larger  boiler-turbine  units;  and\n(iv) the importance of capacity building, not only for project preparation, but also for training staff\nin  operational  and  managerial  aspects  of  power  utility  operations.  A  reevaluation  of  the  Fuel\nConversion  Project,  which  was  completed  in  December  1999,  revised  the  project  rating\ndownward to unsuccessful in economic terms and concludes that ADB-financed projects in the\nenergy  sector  should  not  be  narrowly  focused  on  expected  economic  gains,  which  may  not\nmaterialize, and should be rigorously screened to ensure that they are in line with ADB\u2019s energy\npolicy.29  Recently,  some  ongoing  power  projects  in  the  PRC  have  experienced  some\nimplementation delays in meeting procurement and construction deadlines. This is mainly due\nto the ongoing restructuring of the power sector and consequent change in the ownership of the\nprojects. Nevertheless, the overall implementation performance of ADB\u2019s energy portfolio in the\nPRC is satisfactory.30\n\n31.\nThe  above  lessons  have  been  taken  into  account  in  designing  the  Project.  A\ncomprehensive  feasibility  study  was  prepared  for  it,  and  consulting  services  committed  their\nrespective  loans,  which  have  been  secured  through  guarantees  from  will  be  provided  to\nassist  with  project  implementation.  Domestic  commercial  banks  have  relevant  provincial\ngovernment agencies. Local currency financing was structured to ensure an appropriate mix of\ndebt and Government equity. Provision was made for sufficient working capital, and sensitivity\nanalysis of financial and economic performance was undertaken.\n\nE. \n\nADB's Operational Strategy\n\nADB's operational strategy in the PRC is aimed at helping the country achieve economic\n32.\ngrowth  in  an  efficient,  equitable,  and  sustainable  manner.  Accordingly,  three  strategic\n\n                  \n\n25 Loan 880-PRC, for $330 million, approved on 21 December 1987.\n26 Loan 1091-PRC, for $65 million, approved on 25 July 1991.\n27 Loan 1318-PRC, for $116 million, approved on 27 September 1994.\n28 Loan 1400-PRC, for $200 million, approved on 7 November 1995.\n29 The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, however, noted that the financial and economic reevaluations could\nbe  carried  out  using  different  methodologies  and  assumptions,  which  could  yield  different  results,  and  that  the\ncircumstances that made the project financially unattractive were largely exogenous to it.\n\n30 Of  13  loans  currently  under  administration,  1  is  rated  as  highly  satisfactory,  10  as  satisfactory,  1  as  partially\n\nsatisfactory, and 1 as unsatisfactory.\n\n\f12\n\nobjectives(cid:190) efficiency  improvement,  environmental  protection,  and  promotion  of  growth  to\nreduce poverty in the less developed inland provinces(cid:190) provide the focus for ADB's operations.\nIn  the  energy  sector,  ADB's  operational  strategy  supports  the  Government's  two-pronged\nenergy  development  program  aimed  at  expanding  energy  supplies  and  promoting  energy\nconservation and end-use efficiency. ADB encourages private sector participation in the PRC\u2019s\nenergy  sector  and  is  helping  create  the  enabling  environment  for  such.31  Energy  projects  are\ndesigned  to  assist  in  improving  the  efficiency  of  the  economy  in  a  sustainable  manner  while\nprotecting the environment and managing the country's natural resources.\n\n33.\nADB\u2019s  energy  sector  operations  in  the  PRC  focus  on  (i)  supporting  improvements  in\ntransmission  and  distribution  systems  to  promote  system-wide  efficiency  and  reduce  losses,\nincluding improvement of the reliability and affordability of rural electricity supply; (ii) developing\ncleaner  energy  sources  such  as  hydropower,  clean  coal  technologies,  natural  gas,  methane\ngas,  and  renewable  energy;  (iii) renovating  and  retrofitting  existing  facilities  to  improve\nefficiency and reduce emissions; (iv) promoting the corporatization and commercialization of\npower utilities; (v) sector restructuring; and (vi) pricing and tariff reforms. This is complemented\nby  ADB's  strategy  for  the  environment  sector,  which  focuses  on  (i) strengthening  the  legal,\npolicy, and regulatory framework for sustainable environmental management; (ii) supporting\ninstitutional building programs in environmental monitoring and enforcement; (iii) supporting the\nutilization  of  economic,  supply-side,  and  other  measures  to  ensure  sustainable  utilization  of\nnatural  resources;  (iv)  promoting  the  use  of  cleaner  technologies  for  industrial  production;\n(v) promoting market-based  pricing  and  encouraging  cost  recovery;  and  (vi)  implementing  and\nmonitoring agro-industrial pollution control mechanisms.\n\nADB's poverty reduction strategy for the PRC envisages a range of measures: (i) in the\n34.\nshort  term,  providing  goods  and  services  directly  to  the  most  vulnerable  members  of  society;\n(ii) in the medium term, improving health, education, and social security systems by supporting\ninstitutional reform and capacity building; and (iii) in the long term, promoting sustainable, pro-\npoor  growth  by  improving  infrastructure  and  creating  jobs  in  areas  with  a  high  incidence  of\npoverty.  Since  the  PRC  does  not  have  access  to  Asian  Development  Fund  resources,  it  has\nbeen  reluctant  to  borrow  for  projects  that  address  short-  and  medium-term  poverty  reduction\nmeasures.  Therefore,  most  of  ADB\u2019s  poverty-related  activities  will  tackle  the  following:  (i)\nproviding  the  necessary  physical  infrastructure  in  the  poorer  interior  provinces,  particularly  in\npoverty  counties,  to  stimulate  economic  growth;  (ii) designing  infrastructure  projects  to  more\nbroadly distribute project benefits in poor areas; (iii) encouraging natural resource management\nto sustain agricultural production of poor areas, and targeting agriculture and rural development\nprojects towards the poor; (iv) supporting social security reform and the development of a social\nsafety net to offset the social costs related to SOE reform and ameliorate the increasing urban\npoverty;  (v)  ensuring  that  affordability  by  income  level  is  considered  during  policy  dialogue\nrelated  to  cost  recovery  (e.g., lifeline  tariffs);  (vi)  ensuring  that  resettlement  requirements  of\n\n                  \n\n31 ADB  provided  TA  2730-PRC: Changsha BOT Power Project,  for  $597,000,  approved  on  23 December  1996,  to\nhelp select the build-operate-transfer (BOT) operator and develop a structure for a 2 x 350 MW coal-fired power\nplant near Changsha city in Hunan Province. Under its private sector operations, ADB also provided a loan of $50\nmillion to the Guangzhou Pearl Pearl River Power Co. for a 1,200 MW coal-fired BOT power plant (Investment No.\n7087/177-PRC, approved on 22 September 1992). The power plant is commercially operational for four years and\nthe loan is being satisfactorily serviced. Under the same window ADB also provided financing of $50 million to the\nFujian  Pacific  Electric  Co.  Ltd.  (Investment  No.  1610/7144-PRC,  approved  on  26  February  1998,  consisting  of  a\nloan of $40 million and an equity investment of $10 million) for the Meizhou Wan BOT Power Project comprising a\n720 MW coal-fired power plant in Fujian Province, which won two international awards for excellence. The power\nplant  is  being  commissioned;  however,  some  tariff-related  issues  need  to  addressed  before  it  can  begin\ncommercial operations.\n\n\f13\n\nprojects  and  environmental  impacts  do  not  result  in  worsened  standards  of  living;  (vii)  paying\nspecial attention to the effects of projects on women and minority groups; and (viii) looking more\nbroadly  at  the  poverty  situation  by  working  with  the  Leading  Group  Poverty  Reduction  of  the\nState Council.\n\nIn line with Energy 2000, Review of the Energy Policy of the Asian Development Bank,\n35.\nADB's  assistance  in  the  PRC\u2019s  energy  sector  will  be  aligned  with  the  three  pillars  of  ADB's\npoverty reduction strategy, i.e., pro-poor sustainable economic growth, social development, and\ngood governance. Energy projects will be formulated and designed to support pro-poor growth,\nin  particular  in  the  poorer  interior  provinces  to  achieve  balanced  regional  development.  With\nregard  to  the  distribution  of  electricity  in  rural  areas  priority  will  be  given  to  improving  the\nefficiency and affordability of electricity supply to the rural poor to enable them to reduce the use\nof  wood,  biomass,  and  coal,  and  promoting  the  development  of  environment-friendly  power\ngeneration that will help avoid air pollution.\n\nF.   \n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n1.   \n\nTariff Reform\n\n36.\nThe Government considers tariff reforms crucial for (i) developing multichannel financing\nsources,  (ii)  promoting  investments  by  independent  power  producers,  (iii)  establishing  fair\ncompetition  among  power  utilities,  and  (iv)  providing  incentives  to  improve  efficiency  and\nencourage energy conservation. The objectives of the ongoing tariff reforms include (i) charging\nthe  same  price  for  the  same  quality  of  supply  in  each  grid  (producer  prices),  (ii)  adopting  the\nsame  end-consumer  tariff  for  the  same  categories  of  consumers  in  each  province,  and  (iii)\nestablishing a transparent tariff management system.\n\n37.\nADB  is  emphasizing  the  importance  of  tariff  reforms  to  ensure  the  economic  efficiency\nand  the  financial  sustainability  of  power  utilities,  secure  adequate  financing  for  system\nexpansion,  encourage  efficient  use  of  energy,  and  attract  private  sector  investment.  The\nGovernment accepts the principle of full cost recovery in pricing electricity. In processing power\nprojects  in  the  provinces  of  Hunan,  Henan,  Yunnan,  and  Fujian,  and  in  the  northeast  power\nregion,  ADB  has  ensured,  through  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government,  that  satisfactory  tariff\nreforms are being applied progressively in the concerned project areas. Progress in achieving a\nmore  rational  tariff  structure  at  the  provincial  level  is  expected  to  gradually  lead  to  nationwide\nimprovements.  During  project  processing,  it  was  agreed  to  advance  tariff  reforms  in  Liaoning\nProvince, and a tariff reform action plan was agreed to for this purpose. The associated reforms\nwill  focus  on  (i)  rationalizing  the  classification  of  consumer  categories;  (ii)  eliminating  all  local\nsurcharges; (iii) making adequate upward adjustments from the current tariff level to reflect the\nlong-run marginal cost (LRMC) of power supply at different voltage levels, loads, times of day,\nand  seasons;  (iv)  making  electricity  more  affordable  for  rural  consumers  by  gradually\ndecreasing rural tariffs to bring them in line with corresponding urban tariffs by December 2004,\nwhich  will  be  beneficial  for  the  rural  poor;  and  (v)  developing  transmission  tariffs.    Under  the\nProject, the Government has agreed to (i) overall tariff increases for the Liaoning Electric Power\nCompany  Ltd.  (LEPC)  to  better  reflect  its  LRMC  of  power  supply  at  different  voltage  levels,\nloads, times of day, and seasons,32 (ii) sharing the efficiency gains in the supply of electricity to\n\n32 Includes improvement of the two-part tariff system, which comprises a fixed capacity charge and a variable energy\n\n                  \n\ncharge.\n\n\f14\n\nrural  areas  with  rural  consumers  by  lowering  their  tariffs,33  (iii)  further  rationalization  of  the\nclassification  of  consumer  categories,34  and  (iv)  development  of  a  transmission  tariff\nmethodology. The tariff reform action plan is supported at the provincial level by LEPC and the\nLiaoning  Pricing  Bureau,  and  at  the  national  level  by  SDPC  and  SP.  Appendix  2  provides  a\ndetailed  description  of  the  existing  electricity  tariffs  in  Liaoning  Province  and  the  tariff  reform\naction plan.\n\n2.  Restructuring of the Power Sector\n\n38.\nThe existing legal and regulatory framework in the PRC is not adequate to support the\nestablishment  of  a  wholesale  market  for  power  generation.  This  reflects  deficiencies  in  the\nexisting  commercial  law  and  contract  law,  and  an  inadequate  competition  policy  in  the  PRC.\nFollowing  the  recommendations  developed  under  an  ADB  TA  for  power  sector  restructuring\n(footnote 23), which was considered at the highest levels of the Government, it is proposed that\na  uniform  wholesale  market  design  be  adopted  throughout  the  PRC  that  would  be  based  on\nregional  wholesale  markets  for  each  grid,  with  transmission  pricing  based  on  cost  of\ntransmission, and would have the following key features.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nSuppliers (thermal, hydro, and captive generation) and customers (large buyers\nand  retailers)  agree  on  price  and  quantities  through  bids  and  offers  in  a\nwholesale market.\n\nThe  wholesale  market  operates  across  provinces  and  is  operated  by  a  single\nregional market and system operator.\n\nFinancial  contracts  for  differences35  are  to  be  used  for  risk  management  and  to\nreplace existing power purchase agreements.\n\nEventually, real time power flows and allocation of transmission capacity will be\ndetermined based on offers and bids of generators and retailers.\n\n39.\nUntil  now,  the  PRC  has  focused  on  introducing  power  sector  reforms  in  certain\nprovinces.  Liaoning  Province  is  one  of  the  pilot  areas  where  power  sector  reforms  have  been\nintroduced  with  some  success.  The  separation  of  LEPC\u2019s  power  generation  activities  from  its\npower  transmission  activities  is  ongoing,  and  currently,  nongovernment  investors  own  a  small\nproportion  of  generation  assets  within  Liaoning  Province.  ADB,  in  its  policy  dialogue,  has\nemphasized that at this stage of power sector reforms, a national strategy should be developed\nfor power sector reform in terms of industry structure, wholesale market design, and regulation\nof  competition  and  network  pricing.  This  shift  to  a  national  approach  will  ensure  that  the\nmaximum  benefits  of  competition  in  a  deregulated  power  market  are  realized  through  an\noptimum  national  allocation  of  Government  resources.  This  would  also  facilitate  the  linkage  of\nregional power markets through common trading agreements, as each region is interconnected\nas  part  of  a  national  grid  development  plan.  The  recommended  approach  is  to  (i)  restructure\nprovincial power companies, including the incorporation of power distribution companies, (ii) set\nzonal  transmission  prices,  (iii)  establish  regional  market  operators  and  system  operators,  (iv)\n\n                  \n\n33 In  addition,  LEPC  will  study  the  feasibility  of  establishing  a  lifeline  tariff  for  rural  and  urban  consumers  who  use\n\nrelatively small quantities of electricity.\n\n34 Under  the  Northeast  Power  Transmission  Project  (footnote  41)  progress  on  tariff  reforms  (i)  and  (iii)  has  been\n\nslower than envisaged because the ongoing power sector reform requires a new approach to tariff setting.   \n\n35 Under  such  contracts  difference  payments  are  made  between  the  buyer  and  seller  of  electricity  depending  on\n\nwhether the spot price is above or below the strike price in the contract.\n\n\f15\n\nconduct simulated market trials in each region to train market participants, and (v) commence a\nwholesale  market.  The  recommended  timetable  for  restructuring  of  the  PRC\u2019s  power  sector  is\neight  years  with  the  following  three  major  stages:  (i)  single  buyer  structure  and  power\ngeneration  competition  (2002-2004);  (ii)  multiple  buyer  structure  and  wholesale  power  market\ncompetition  (2005-2006);  and  (iii)  power  retail  market  competition  and  power  retail  market\nderegulation  (2007-2009).  An  appropriate  regulatory  and  legal  framework  must  also  be\nestablished. ADB\u2019s policy dialogue in this complex area is continuing36 and the Government is\nexamining which agencies would be responsible for regulation, implementation of restructuring,\nand  operation  of  the  competitive  electricity  market  as  well  as  the  detailed  schedule  for  the\nimplementation of the reforms.\n\n40. With regard to LEPC\u2019s further restructuring in anticipation of a wholesale power market\nin Liaoning Province, a general model for LEPC as single regional market and system operator\nunder  the  \u201csingle  buyer\u201d  model  was  agreed  to  during  project  processing.  Over  the  next  few\nyears this will involve organizing the various functions of LEPC into separate units. In the longer\nterm,  however,  the  \u201csingle  buyer\u201d  model  will  be  phased  out  to  introduce  more  competitive\nmarket forces, and LEPC will become a regional market operator for the transmission grid in the\nnortheast power region.\n\n3.\n\nMaximizing the Project\u2019s Impact on the Poor\n\n41.     The tariff reform action plan (para. 37) will, among others, reduce the electricity tariffs in\nrural areas and make electricity more affordable for the rural poor in Liaoning Province. This will\nresult  in  an  average  increase  in  per  capita  income  of  the  rural  poor  of  about  19.2  percent\nbetween 2003 and 2007. The increase in electricity consumption in the rural areas of Liaoning\nProvince  is  expected  to  lead  to  an  average  increase  of  the  annual  per  capita  income  of  Y23.\nThe increase in electricity consumption could lead to a 2.3 percent annual increase in the per\ncapita  income  for  the  rural  poor  who  have  an  annual  per  capita  income  of  not  more  than\nY1,000.37  Based  on  LEPC\u2019s  projections  for  rural  electricity  consumption,  the  cost  savings  for\nhouseholds as a result of the proposed tariff reforms would be about Y16.8 billion between 2003\nand 2007. If such savings are used for investments in productive activities, this could lead to an\naverage  increase  in  annual  per  capita  income  of  Y77  in  the  rural  areas  over  a  period  of  five\nyears. This would imply an average increase in per capita income of 7.7 percent between 2003\nand 2007 for the rural poor. Together, these two impacts could lead to an increase of about 19.2\npercent in the average per capita income of the rural poor in Liaoning Province between 2003\nand 2007.\n\n42.\n  As  a  result  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue,  it  was  agreed  that  LEPC,  in  consultation  with\nSDPC,  will  commence  a  study  on  the  introduction  of  lifeline  tariffs  in  rural  and  urban  areas  in\nLiaoning Province. Such lifeline tariffs would provide a certain subsidy on the cost of electricity\nfor rural and urban consumers who use relatively small quantities of electricity as is typically the\ncase  for  poor  households.  This  will  make  electricity,  consumption  for  such  basic  needs  as\nlighting  and  cooking  more  affordable  for  the  poor.38  Lifeline  tariffs  are  not  being  used  in  the\nPRC, and their introduction in Liaoning Province will have national implications in demonstrating\nhow electricity tariffs can be designed to be pro-poor. To spread the benefits of the Project more\n\n                  \n\n36 For  example,  as  follow-up  to  a  meeting  between  senior  officials  of  the  State  Council  Office  for  Restructuring\nEconomic  Systems  and  ADB  staff  in  April  2001,  a  workshop  was  organized  in  Beijing  on  25  July  2001  to  share\nADB\u2019s experience with regard to power sector restructuring in the region.\n37 The tariff effect was calculated using the estimated price elasticity of income.\n38 The study will be completed within 12 months after loan effectiveness.\n\n\f16\n\nwidely to the poor, during project processing a component was added to the project design to\nrehabilitate  rural  electricity  grids  in    three  poverty    counties  and  one    poverty  city.  It  was  also\nagreed that the rehabilitation of the rural electricity grids under the Project will be complemented\nby  a  component  to  provide  for  free  energy-efficient  light  bulbs  (compact  fluorescents)  to  the\npoorest  100,000  households  in  three  poverty  counties  and  one  poverty  city  under  the  Project.\nCompact  fluorescent  lights  are  50  percent  more  economical  on  an  annualized  basis  than\nordinary  light  bulbs.  However,  poor  people  are  not  using  this  technology  since  they  are\nunfamiliar  with  it  and  consider  it  relatively  expensive.  Their  use  of  compact  fluorescents  will\nreduce  their  present  electricity  consumption  for  lighting  by  about  30  percent39  and  within  their\ncurrent electricity consumption levels make electricity available for other use. Upon completion\nof the installation LEPC and ADB will evaluate the results and discuss possible schemes to for\nproviding energy efficient lighting to other poor households in Liaoning Province. Further power\nsector  reforms  in  Liaoning  Province  will  involve  the  divestment  of  power  generation  capacity,\nwhich is owned directly by SP.40 Liaoning Province has a disproportionate share of nationwide\nunemployed  who  depend  largely  on  social  security  payments  by  the  Government  for  their\nlivelihood.  The Government  is planning to use part of the proceeds from the sale of its power\ngeneration capacity to finance its social security fund.\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\n43.\nThe northeast power region extends over Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces and\nthe eastern part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The long-term power development\nplan for this power system envisages the construction of large mine-mouth power plants in the\ncoal-rich Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Heilongjiang Province, and transferring power\nin bulk to the power-deficient southern parts of the region using high-voltage transmission lines.\nImplementation of this plan will result in (i) environmental benefits resulting from moving thermal\npower  generation  outside  densely  populated  urban  areas;  (ii)  job  creation  in  mining,  power\ngeneration,  and  ancillary  services;  and  (iii)  increased  economic  productivity,  since  it  is\neconomically  more  efficient  to  transmit  power  than  to  transport  coal.  Originally,  power  flowed\nfrom  the  north  to  the  south  through  a  single-circuit  500  kilovolt  (kV)  transmission  line  from\nHarbin to Liaoning Province, as well as 220 kV tie lines between Heilongjiang and Jilin, and Jilin\nand Liaoning provinces. Since the power transmission capability of these lines was limited, ADB\nprovided a loan for construction of another single-circuit, 500 kV transmission line of 724 circuit\nkilometers  (km)  from  Yongyuan  near  Harbin  in  Heilongjiang  Province  to  Shenyang  and\nLiaoyang in Liaoning Province including substation and communication systems.41 This project\nwas successfully completed according to schedule in June 2001.\n\n44.\nThe  power  demand  growth  of  Liaoning  Province  is  the  highest  in  the  northeast  region.\nThe  annual  average  power  consumption  growth  rate  for  the  province  was  4.5  percent  during\n1990\u20131999.  By  2005,  a  1,150  MW  power  deficiency  is  projected  for  the  southern  part  of\nLiaoning  Province,  and  additional  power  generation  capacity  will  need  to  be  installed  in  the\nsouthern part of Liaoning Province, if no additional power can be supplied from the north to this\npart  of  the  province.  The  Project  will  meet  this  deficit  by  providing  a  high-voltage  power\ntransmission system, enabling the transfer of power from the northern part of the region, which\nhas  a  surplus  of  power,  to  the  southern  part  of  Liaoning  Province.  The  Project  will  therefore\n\n                  \n\n39 The savings are based on the use of one compact fluorescent with a capacity of 13 watts and one ordinary light\n\nbulb of 40 watts for approximately five hours per day.\n\n40 Under the existing organization structure LEPC is also wholly owned by SP.\n41 Loan 1582-PRC: Northeast Power Transmission Project, for $150 million, approved on 25 November 1997.\n\n\f17\n\neliminate the need for installation in the near future of new coal-fired power generation capacity\nin  the  densely  populated  southern  part  of  Liaoning  Province,  thereby  avoiding  additional  coal\ntransport and the harmful emissions associated with additional coal-fired power generation. The\nProject  will  also  upgrade  the  transmission  system  around  Shenyang  by  adding  the  west-side\nloop and establishing a 500 kV ring system. This will increase by optimizing the loading of the\n220 kV system, which will decrease transmission losses and increase electricity reliability in the\nShenyang region.\n\nThe  upgrading  and  expansion  of  rural  electrification  in  three  poverty  counties  and  one\n45.\npoverty city, which will complete such upgrading and expansion in the relatively poor rural areas\nof  Liaoning  Province,  increase  the  availability  and  reliability  of  electricity  supply,  and  reduce\nsystem  losses  and  the  costs  of  supply  to  these  areas  by  15\u201320  percent.  At  present,  the  rural\npeople  in  these  poverty  areas  use  a  combination  of  straw,  firewood,  and  coal  to  meet  their\nenergy requirements. In 2000, it was found that, depending on the area, 70\u201390 percent of the\ninhabitants  reported  suffering  from  eye  and  throat  irritations.  Surveys  of  beneficiaries  also\nconfirmed  that  rural  households  in  the  concerned  areas  would  begin  substituting  electricity  for\nstraw,  firewood,  and  coal  for  electricity  if  the  cost  of  electricity  decreased  and  the  electrical\nsupply became more reliable as is envisaged under the tariff reform action plan. The Project will\nalso  increase  productivity  and  result  in  more  efficient  power  generation  in  Liaoning  Province,\nsince the reinforced transmission network will allow for a reduction of the idle generating reserve\nmargins of existing power plants in the region; improve the dispatch of electricity; and call for the\nshutting down of old, small, and less efficient coal-fired power plants in the province. It will also\nresult in an integrated regional grid that will facilitate the establishment of a regional competitive\npower market, the Government\u2019s major strategic reform agenda.\n\nB.        Objectives and Scope\n\n1. \n\nObjectives\n\n46.\nThe  principal  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  increase  the  capacity  and  efficiency  of\nelectricity transmission from the northeastern part of the PRC to the southern part of Liaoning\nProvince,  thereby  increasing  the  availability  of  electricity  and  the  reliability  of  the  electricity\ntransmission  and  distribution  systems  in  Liaoning  Province  and  avoiding  harmful  emissions\nassociated  with  new  power  generation  in  the  densely  populated  southern  part  of  Liaoning\nProvince. Other objectives are to complete the upgrading and expansion of rural electrification\nin the relatively poor rural areas of Liaoning Province, and to develop an integrated regional grid\nthat will enable restructuring of the power sector in Liaoning Province to introduce competitive\nmarkets and use market forces to increase efficiency and productivity.\n\n2. \n\nScope\n\n47.\n\nThe Project will consist of the following components:\n\n(i) \n\nelectricity transmission\n(a) \n\nconstruction  of  a  single-circuit,  500  kV  transmission  line  of  502  km  from\nShenyang to Dalian\nextension of four 500 kV substations at Shaling, Xujia, Wangshi,\nand Nanguanling and construction of a 500 kV substation at Shendong\ninstallation  of  communication  systems  and  environmental  monitoring\nequipment\n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n\f18\n\n(ii) \n\nelectricity transmission expansion and upgrading\n(a) \n\nupgrading  and  expansion  of  the  Shenyang  electricity  network,  including\nthe upgrading of 220 kV substations at Taiyuan and Suncheng\nupgrading and expansion of the Dalian electricity network\nupgrading  and  expansion  of  the  Nanguanlin-Yanshui  electricity  network,\nincluding the construction of a 220 kV substation at Yanshui\n\n(b) \n(c) \n\n(iii) \n\nrural electrification upgrading and expansion in the poverty counties of Kangping,\nXiuyan, and Xinbin and the poverty city of Zhuanghe\n(a)       construction of 66 kV transmission lines\n(b)\n\ninstallation  of  66  kV  transformers  and  rehabilitation  of  existing  66  kV\ntransformers\nupgrading of 10 kV distribution lines\nupgrading and replacement of low voltage transformers and Installation of\nnew capacitors\ntraining  of  staff  in  rural  electricity  supply  companies  in  operation  and\nmaintenance of the low voltage networks\nprovision of energy efficient lighting42\n\n(c)\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n(iv) \n\nupgrading of urban distribution in Shenyang and Dalian\n\n(v)        competitive power market development\n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nstudy on transmission and distribution tariff determination, restructuring of\nLEPC, and network management improvement\ndomestic training of LEPC staff\n\n            (vi)       consulting services for project implementation\n\n(vii) \n\ninternational training of LEPC staff in management of a power grid company in a\ncompetitive market\n\n(viii) \n\nclosure of 10 coal-fired power generation units (with a total capacity of 437 MW)\nin Liaoning Province\n\n3. \n\nProject Area\n\na. \n\nEconomy\n\n48.\nThe GDP of Liaoning Province grew at 10.2 percent annually in real terms between 1990\nand  1995,  and  at  8.6  percent  between  1996  and  2000.  The  GDP  growth  rate  in  1999  was  7.5\npercent,43 whereas for 2000 it is estimated at 8.9 percent. Since 1995, the province has invested\nmore  than  $2  billion  equivalent  to  develop  its  infrastructure.  Priority  areas  for  further\ndevelopment  are \ntelecommunications,  and  urban\ninfrastructure,  energy, \ndevelopment.  The  economic  structure  of  the  province  is  dominated  by  heavy  industry  and\nSOEs.  Heavy  industry  production  accounts  for  nearly  three  quarters  of  the  total  provincial\n\ntransportation \n\n                  \n\n42 About  100,000  of  the  poorest  households  in  the  three  poverty  counties  and  one  poverty  city  will  receive  a  free\ncompact fluorescent of 13 watts with a lifetime of a minimum of five years. The total cost of the program is about Y2\nmillion, which will be financed by LEPC, and produce annual energy savings of about Y1.2 million.\n\n43 The  industry  sector  accounted  for  nearly  half  of  this  growth  rate,  while  the  services  and  agriculture  sectors\ncontributed  39.7  percent  and  10.9  percent,  respectively.  Investments  in  fixed  assets  accounted  for  about  21\npercent of the growth rate.\n\n\f19\n\nindustrial output and 7 percent of the PRC\u2019s total heavy industry production. Its industry sector\nincludes  iron  and  steel,  coal,  petrochemicals,  metallurgy,  machinery,  electronics,  shipbuilding,\nbuilding  materials,  papermaking,  and  textiles.  Mechanical  and  electrical  products  are  the\nprovince's main export products. SOEs in Liaoning Province account for about one tenth of the\ntotal  number  of  SOEs  in  the  PRC.  Major  cities  in  Liaoning  Province  are  Shenyang  with  a\npopulation of 6.88 million, Dalian with a population of 5.54 million, and Fushun with a population\nof 2.31 million.\n\nb. \n\nEnergy Resources\n\n49.\nIn the northeast region, the main local resources of energy are coal, hydropower, and oil,\nbut production falls short of regional requirements. Coal deposits in the northeast region amount\nto  71.3  billion  tons,  or  7  percent  of  the  PRC\u2019s  total.  Coal  resources,  however,  are  unevenly\ndistributed and are mainly in Inner Mongolia (58 percent of total) and Heilongjiang (30 percent).\nLiaoning  Province  accounts  for  only  9  percent  of  the  regional  total.  There  is  15.3  GW  of\nexploitable hydropower resources in the northeast region with an average generation of 44 TWh.\nLiaoning  Province  had  a  negative  net  energy  balance,  and  total  primary  commercial  energy\nproduction  amounted  to  37.0  million  toe,  of  which  60  percent  consisted  of  coal,  36  percent  of\ncrude oil, and 4 percent of natural gas. In 1999, energy production declined by 12 percent from\nits 1998 level, mainly due to a 17 percent decline in coal production, reflecting both a decline in\nthe  industrial  demand  for  coal  and  the  closure  of  small  and  uneconomic  coal  mines.  The  oil\nproduction  of  the  northeast  region  is  largely  exported  to  other  parts  of  the  PRC.  In  1999,  the\nprimary commercial energy consumption of Liaoning Province was 58.0 million toe, its imports\nof  primary  commercial  energy  were  21.1  million  toe,  and  its  deficit  between  production  and\nconsumption of primary commercial energy was about 36 percent.\n\nc. \n\nPoverty Aspects\n\nLiaoning  Province  has  a  population  of  about  41  million,  with  about  18.7  million  people\n50.\nliving in urban areas and about 22.3 million in rural areas. Liaoning Province accounts for about\n3  percent  of  the  PRC\u2019s  entire  population  but  includes  about  10  percent  of  the  officially\nunemployed  nationwide.  The  State  Council  Task  Force  for  Development  of  a  Social  Security\nSystem  therefore  selected  Liaoning  Province  to  implement  a  social  security  reform  pilot\nprogram,  which  is  to  test  new  approaches  to  social  security  reform  and  lead  to  nationwide\nreplication  of  those  that  prove  to  be  successful.  The  pilot  program  is  being  supported  by  the\nADB TA for Policy and Institutional Support for the Social Security Program (footnote 12). The\nunemployed consist mainly of workers who were laid off due to closure and restructuring of the\nlarge SOEs, which traditionally dominated the industry sector of Liaoning Province. In Shenyang\nand  Dalian  the  unemployed  are  estimated  to  exceed  1.2  million,  of  whom  some  600,000  are\nreceiving a minimum subsistence payment of Y250 per month as determined by the provincial\ngovernment.  The  provincial  government  is  expecting  that  the  unemployment  rate  will  increase\nfurther during the TFYP, because of additional layoffs and the entrance of about 300,000 new\njob  seekers  into  the  labor  market  each  year.  During  this  period  the  provincial  government  is\nplanning  to  create  new  jobs,  for  about  three  million  people  through  (i)  export  of  labor  to  other\nparts  of  the  PRC  or  abroad;  (ii)  establishing  small  and  medium-scale  enterprises,  township\nenterprises, and private enterprises; and (iii) promoting the development of the services sector,\nincluding retailing, tourism, and domestic services. The provincial and municipal governments in\nLiaoning  Province  are  also  providing  direct  assistance  to  the  growing  number  of  urban\nunemployed  by  (i)   introducing  preferential  access  policies  in  the  form  of  fee  exemptions  or\nreductions for the urban poor in the areas of education, water, electricity, heating, and gas; (ii)\nproviding  preferential  policies  to  private  and  nonstate  enterprises  that  employ  laid-off  workers;\n\n\f20\n\n(iii) developing physical infrastructure (especially roads and water supply) to promote economic\ndevelopment  and  employ  laid-off  workers  for  construction;  (iv)  providing  microcredit,  tax\nexemptions,  and  retraining  to  laid-off  workers  who  show  self-reliance  and  establish  private\nbusinesses;  and  (v)  social  security  reform,  which  will  strengthen  the  management  and\nadministration of social security funds and their availability for eligible persons.\n\nd. \n\nLoad Forecast\n\nThe annual power demand in Liaoning Province grew by 4.5 percent per annum during\n51.\n1990\u20132000. As part of the least-cost generation planning for Liaoning Province, the Northeast\nPower  Design  Institute  undertook  a  demand  forecast  for  electricity.  According  to  this  forecast,\nconsumption  would  increase  by  3.3  percent  in  2000,  4.2  percent  annually  from  2000  to  2005,\n3.6 percent annually from 2006 to 2010, and 3.5 percent annually from 2011 to 2015. However,\nthe  growth  rate  in  electricity  consumption  in  2000  was  9.3  percent,  which  was  considerably\nhigher than the projected 3.3 percent. The main factor leading to this substantial increase was\nthe recovery in industrial production from a low level in the previous three years.\n\n52.\nDalian is one of the major load centers in Liaoning Province, accounting for 15 percent\nof the electricity demand of the province. Since Dalian will be the major beneficiary of the 500\nkV  transmission  line  and  grid  rehabilitation,  a  separate  forecast  was  carried  out  on  future\nelectricity demand for the area covered by the Dalian Power Supply Bureau. GDP growth rates\nfor Dalian, which has been very successful in attracting foreign direct investment, have been the\nhighest in Liaoning Province (e.g., 11.8 percent growth in 2000). Dalian has a number of major\nindustries, including metallurgy, petroleum, chemicals, textiles, electronics, and food processing.\nIt  is  also  the  largest  ship  manufacturing  base  in  the  PRC  and  is  an  important  seaport.  Most\npeople are employed in about 970 enterprises in urban areas and about 150,000 township and\nvillage enterprises. Together with its growth, Dalian has also maintained its position as a model\nenvironment  city  in  the  PRC.  Electricity  consumption  in  Dalian  is  projected  to  grow  at  8.5\npercent  in  2001,  7.9  percent  in  2002,  and  7.7  percent  in  2003.  In  the  long-term  forecast,  the\naverage growth rates are 7.7 percent for the period 2001\u20132005, 6.3 percent in 2006\u20132010, and\n3.1  percent  in  2011\u20132015.  A  forecast  based  on  more  conservative  assumptions  about  the\ngrowth  in  Dalian  resulted  in  average  consumption  growth  rates  of  6.8  percent  between  2001\nand  2005,  5.7  percent  between  2006  and  2010,  and  4.0  percent  between  2011  and  2015.\nTherefore, by doubling the power transmission capacity of the 500 kV interconnection with the\nnorthern region and the consequent avoidance of emissions from new coal-fired power plants,\nthe Project will help maintain Dalian\u2019s clean environment without suppressing the energy supply\nneeded for future economic growth.\n\ne. \n\nPower Development Plan\n\nThe  least-cost  generation  expansion  analysis  covering  2000\u20132015  (planning  period)  for\n53.\nthe  Liaoning  power  grid  (LPG)  was  carried  out  by  the  Economic  Research  Center  of  the  State\nPower Corporation using the GESP II model.44 The input data and assumptions were reviewed by\nthe TA consultants and found appropriate. The least-cost analyses confirmed the robustness of\nthe Project. The Project will still be required, even if the demand growth slows to the average\nconsumption  growth  rates  of  3.6  percent  between  2000  and  2005,  3.2  percent  between  2005\nand  2010,  and  2.5  percent  between  2010  and  2015  (low  growth  case  projected  by  the  TA\nconsultants). LPG is a subgrid of the grid that interconnects the northeast power region. A least-\n\n                  \n\n44 The computer model GESP II (Generator of Electric System Planning) has been used for similar analysis in more\n\nthan 10 power projects financed by the World Bank and ADB.\n\n\f21\n\ncost  plan  was  also  undertaken  for  this  grid,  which  demonstrated  that  power  exports  from  the\nnorthern part of the northeast power region to Dalian were justified.45\n\nC.   \n\nTechnical Justification\n\n1. \n\nTransmission Component\n\n54.\nThe  construction  of  an  additional  500  kV  single  circuit  transmission  line  between\nShenyang    and    Dalian46    will    increase    the    power    transmission    capacity,    thereby    (i)\nimproving the reliability of the power supply in the highly industrialized Dalian area; (ii) enabling\nincreased  supply  of  power  to  rural  consumers;  (iii)  allowing  the  deferral  until  2010  of  new\ngeneration capacity additions in the densely populated Dalian area, thereby avoiding increases\nin  urban  pollution  resulting  from  additionally  required  coal-based  power  generation;  (iv)\neliminating  a  potential  transmission  bottleneck  in  power  trading  (and  so  unduly  high  bulk\nelectricity price in Dalian area) once the northeast power region adopts a competitive electricity\ngenerating market structure; and (v) reducing transmission losses by about 23 MW to 122 MW\nduring the period 2002\u20132010.\n\n55.\nThe Project is also a logical southward extension of the ADB-financed Northeast Power\nTransmission Project, which involves the construction of a 500 kV single circuit transmission line\nbetween  Harbin  in  Heilongjiang  Province  and  Shenyang  in  Liaoning  Province.  Once  all  the\nsections are completed, this integrated 500 kV system will constitute the backbone transmission\nsystem  with  a  total  length  of  more  than  2,000  km  (from  Yamin  in  the  Inner  Mongolia\nAutonomous  Region  to  Dalian).  Since  this  backbone  will  have  the  economic  transmission\ncapacity  of  2,000  MW  and  the  short-term  transmission  capacity  of  nearly  5,000  MW,\ntransmission  bottlenecks  can  be  avoided  in  the  long  term  even  with  relatively  smaller\ninterconnections  from  new  load  centers  and  new  power  plants  to  the  backbone  transmission\nsystem.  The  availability  of  the  strong  transmission  backbone  will  help  prepare  the  northeast\npower region for developing into a competitive power market.\n\n2. \n\nDistribution Component\n\nCurrently,  12.4  percent  of  the  population  in  the  project  area  are  poor  people  with  an\n56.\naverage  annual  per  capita  income  of  Y1,000  in  rural  areas,  Y2,000  in  the  poverty  city,  and\nY3,000  in  the  urban  centers  of  the  municipalities  under  the  Project.  Poverty  counties/city  all\nreceive financial assistance from the central and provincial governments. As in other parts of the\nPRC,  the  urban  and  rural  power  distribution  networks  in  Liaoning  Province  have  several\nshortcomings:  (i)  since  originally  the  emphasis  was  on  connecting  industries,  the  network  for\nconnecting households is simple and weak, which has made rural power supply unreliable and\nof poor quality; (ii) the rural network comprises two-wire, ground return, 10 kV subtransmission\nsystems that lead to technical losses of up to 50 percent in some counties and can be unsafe\nduring electrical fault conditions; and (iii) the rural tariff is nearly twice as high as that for urban\nconsumers.  The  Government  is  taking  steps  to  address  these  problems.  County  level  power\n\n                  \n\n45 There are large power exchanges between LPG and other subgrids. Liaoning Province is a net power importer. It\nhas received hydroelectricity from Jilin Province and thermal power from Heilongjiang and the eastern part of the\nInner Mongolia Autonomous Region each year, since the early 1980s.\n\n46 At present, electricity is supplied to Dalian via a 500 kV, single circuit, transmission line and 220 kV transmission\nlines. The 500 kV line has had five outages since it was commissioned in 1998, and it was out of service for a total\nof  about  80  hours.  The  addition  of  the  proposed  transmission  line  will  improve  the  reliability  of  electricity  supply.\nFurther, it will be routed outside the eastern side of Shenyang, thus completing the 500 kV ring around the city that\nwill ensure more stable power supply to Shenyang.\n\n\f22\n\nsupply  companies  are  being  established  for  the  operation,  maintenance,  and  management  of\nlow voltage rural networks. In 1998, the Government allocated about Y180 billion (equivalent to\nabout  $22  billion)  to  these  power  supply  companies  to  rehabilitate  the  rural  power  grids.  The\nthree poverty counties and one poverty city under the Project have electricity supply constraints\nthat limit their use of electricity mainly to lighting. The rural electrification will benefit the rural poor\nby  providing  incremental  electricity  needed  for  rural  development,  and  by  reducing  line  losses\nand rural tariffs. About 30 percent of the rehabilitation work has been completed under the first\nphase  (1998\u20132000),  while  the  balance  is  to  be  carried  out  during  the  second  phase  (2001\u2013\n2004).47  Since  the  rural  electricity  tariffs  are  relatively  high  and  the  distribution  of  electricity  in\nrural areas is relatively inefficient, the rehabilitation of rural power distribution grids will produce\nconsiderable financial and environmental benefits. In the cities of Shenyang and Dalian, LEPC\nwill  further upgrade  and  expand the urban distribution systems including the construction of\nlines,  disconnecting  switches,  and\ntransformers,  surface  and  underground  distribution \ncommunication systems, which will increase the availability and reliability of electricity supply in\nboth cities.\n\n4. \n\nClosure of Old, Inefficient, and Polluting Coal-Fired Generation Units\n\n57.\nSince  1998,  LEPC  has  closed  10  coal-fired  power  generating  units  with  an  installed\ncapacity  of  50  MW  or  less,  totalling  421  MW.  Since  the  Project  will  increase  power  supply,\nLEPC  is  planning  to  close  10  additional  small,  inefficient,  polluting  power  generation  units\naround Shenyang with a total capacity of 437 MW prior to full operation of the transmission line.\nTable  1  shows  LEPC\u2019s  closure  plan.  The  costs  of  the  closure  are  estimated  at  $880,000\nequivalent. The 2,000 affected employees will continue to be employed by LEPC. After closure\nof the old power plants, they will help with the decommissioning and removal of the old power\nplants and undergo training in operation of modern power plants for redeployment.\n\nName\n\nTable 1: Planned Closure of Coal-Fired Generation Units\nNo. of Units      Capacity\n\nReduced Emissions (\u2018000 tons)\n\nLiaoning Power Plant\nFushun Power Plant\n   Total\nSource: Liaoning Electric Power Company Ltd.\n\n      7\n      3\n     10\n\n   350 MW\n     87 MW\n   437 MW\n\nD.

The\nremainder of the project cost will be financed by a contribution of $135 million equivalent from\ninternal cash generation by LEPC and a domestic loan of $240 million equivalent from the China\nConstruction Bank, which will have a repayment period of 13 years including a grace period of 3\nyears and an interest of 6.21 percent per annum.48\n\n60.\nThe ADB loan is proposed to come from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. The loan will\ncarry a front-end fee of 1 percent, an interest rate to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nLondon Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) based lending rate system for US dollar loans, and a\ncommitment  charge  of  0.75  percent  per  annum.  The  loan  will  have  a  repayment  period  of  24\nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  4  years.  The  Borrower  will  be  the  Government  of  the  PRC,\nwhich will make the loan available to LEPC through an onlending agreement on the same terms\nand  conditions.  Disbursements  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  subject  to  SDPC\u2019s  approval  of\nLEPC\u2019s  feasibility  study  for  the  Project.  LEPC  will  assume  the  foreign  exchange  and  interest\nvariation risks of the loan (Table 3).\n\n                  \n\n48 A commitment letter from the China Construction Bank for the loan has been obtained.\n\n\f24\n\nTable 3: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\n0.0\n\n135.0\n\n100.0\n0.0\n\n100.0\n\n0.0\n240.0\n\n375.0\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n135.0\n\n100.0\n240.0\n\n475.0\n\nPercent of\nTotal\n\n28.4\n\n21.1\n50.5\n\n100.0\n\nSource\nInternal Resources\n\nLEPC\n\nLoans\nADB\nChina Construction Bank\n\nTotal\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, LEPC = Liaoning Electric Power Company Ltd.\nSource: Staff estimates.\n\nF.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1. \n\nProject Management\n\nLEPC  will  be  the  EA  for  the  Project.  LEPC  has  established  a  project  implementation\n61.\noffice  (PIO),  headed  by  a  project  director,  that  is  responsible  for  overall  project  coordination,\nincluding procurement, accounting, and reporting functions, as well as for liaison with ADB. The\nPIO comprises four sections and employs 18 persons, of whom 16 are on a full-time basis. The\nPIO  will  establish  a  project  internet  site  to  provide  public  access  to  basic  information  about\nproject activities, including the status of the implementation schedule, the procurement process,\nthe  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  (LARP),  and  the  environmental  monitoring  and\nmitigation plan (EMMP).\n\n2. \n\nProcurement\n\n62.\nAll  goods  under  the  Project  to  be  wholly  or  partly  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in\naccordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. The majority of the items financed by ADB\nwill  be  procured  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding  procedures  through  10\nseparate  tenders  using  ADB\u2019s  standard  bidding  documents.  Other  items  that  are  expected  to\ncost  less  than  $500,000  will  be  procured  on  the  basis  of  international  shopping  procedures.\nLEPC will undertake all construction work under the Project and finance the same from its own\nresources.    All  locally  financed  items  will  be  procured  by  LEPC  on  the  basis  of  procedures\nacceptable to ADB. A list of all procurement packages, including those to be financed by ADB,\nand  their  mode  of  procurement  is  in  Appendix  4.  In  view  of  LEPC\u2019s  aim  to  begin  project\nimplementation by early 2002, ADB, at the request of the Government, has approved advance\nprocurement action with regard to goods financed under the Project.49\n\n                  \n\n49 Advance  procurement  action  covers  procurement  under  the  first  tender  documents  up  to  but  not  including  the\naward of contract and was published in the electronic version of ADB Business Opportunities of 24 July 2001 and\nin its printed version of September  2001 (volume 23, no. 9). The Government was informed that ADB approval of\nadvance action does not commit ADB to financing of this part (or any other part) of the Project.\n\n\f25\n\n3. \n\nConsulting Services\n\n63.\nUnder  the  Project,  project  implementation  consulting  services  will  be  required  to  assist\nLEPC with (i) a review of the draft tender documents50 and evaluation of the bids received, (ii)\ntechnical  advice  with  regard  to  the  design  of  the  project  facilities  as  required,  and  (iii)  project\nmanagement.  Also,  consulting  services  will  be  provided  for  power  market  development  in\nLiaoning  Province  to  help  prepare  transmission  tariffs  for  the  Liaoning  power  grid  and  to\nstrengthen  the  operations  of  LEPC  in  preparation  for  its  new  role  as  a  power  transmission\ncompany.  In  particular,  the  consultants  will  make  recommendations  for  improvements  in\ncapturing  business  costs  at  departmental/cost  center  levels,  financial  reporting,  budgeting,\nmanagement  administration,  staff  incentive  schemes,  and  auditing  systems  and  transparency.\nAll consultants will be financed by ADB and will be recruited by LEPC in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants.  The  consulting  services  for  project  implementation  will\ninclude  30  person-months  of  international  consulting  services,  and  those  for  power  market\ndevelopment in Liaoning Province will include 31 person-months (comprising 15 person-months\nof  international  consulting  services  and  16  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services).  In\nview  of  LEPC\u2019s  aim  to  begin  project  implementation  by  early  2002  and  the  requirement  for\ninternational consultants to assist LEPC with the evaluation of bids received in response to the\nfirst tender documents and the review of subsequent tender documents, ADB, at the request of\nthe Government, has approved advance recruitment and retroactive financing for the consulting\nservices financed under the Project.51 Domestic consulting services for detailed engineering and\npreparation  of  tender  documents  will  be  provided  by  the  Northeast  Power  Design  Institute,\nwhich  is  an  experienced  organization  that  performed  satisfactorily  under  the  Northeast  Power\nTransmission Project (footnote 41).\n\n4. \n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n64.\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  about  three  and  a  half  years.\nPreparatory  work  began  in  June  2001  with  the  drafting  of  the  first  bidding  documents  for\ninternational  competition  bidding  (under  advance  procurement  action).  It  is  expected  that  the\ntransmission lines will become operational by late 2004 and that the Project will be completed\nby the middle of 2005 with the commissioning of all facilities (Appendix 5).\n\n5. \n\nGovernance and Anticorruption\n\n65.\nDuring project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to central and local\ngovernment  officials.  Attention  was  drawn  to  the  section  on  fraud  and    corruption  that  was\nadded  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement,  particularly  the  need  for  bidders,  suppliers,  and\ncontractors  to  observe  the  highest  standards  of  ethics  in  the  procurement  and  execution  of\nADB-financed contracts, and the sanctions to be applied if fraud and corruption are discovered.\nSimilarly,  the  anticorruption  provisions  added  to  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants\nwere discussed.\n\n66.\nThe Government is increasingly concerned with governance issues and has conducted\nwell-publicized campaigns against corruption involving use of public funds. ADB\u2019s PRC Country\n\n                  \n\nof the TA consultants.\n\n50 For the preparation of the first four tender documents, which were issued in October 2001, LEPC used the services\n\n51 The advance recruitment action for the consulting services was reported in the electronic version of ADB Business\nOpportunities of 24 July 2001 and in its printed version of September 2001 (volume 23, no. 9). The Government\nwas informed that ADB approval of the advance action and retroactive financing of the consulting services does not\ncommit ADB to finance this part or any other part of the Project.\n\n\f26\n\nAssistance Program includes support to the Government in improving governance and providing\nincentives to reduce the incidence of corruption in the longer term. In 1997, ADB also provided\nTA  to  draft  procurement  regulations  and  standard  bidding  documents.52  The  six  sets  of  draft\nregulations  and  the  three  sets  of  sample  bidding  documents  produced  under  the  TA  contain\nprovisions  related  to  avoidance  of  corrupt  or  fraudulent  practices,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nanticorruption  policy.  This  assistance  culminated  in  the  promulgation  of  the  National  Law  on\nTendering  and  Bidding  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China  which  became  effective  as  of\n1 January  2000.    The  law,  which  covers  key  construction  projects  funded  by  the  Government\nand  externally  funded  projects,  stipulates  in  Article  5  that  local  bidding  activities  should  follow\nthe  principles  of  openness,  fairness,  impartiality,  and  good  faith.  Article  6  stipulates  that  \u201cno\norganizations  or  persons  shall,  by  any  means,  limit  or  exclude  legal  persons  or  other\norganizations  outside  from  other  regions  or  systems  from  participating  in  the  bidding\nprocedure. No illegal interference in any form is permitted in the bidding process.\u201d Article 32\nspecifically prohibits bribes and collusion, while Articles 49\u201364 specify appropriate sanctions for\nall  abuses  of  the  law,  including  substantial  fines  and  criminal  prosecutions.  ADB\u2019s  country\nprogram includes an ongoing TA to help draft the implementation regulations for the law53 and\nTAs  to  prepare  policies  and  a  regulatory  framework  for  the  construction  industry54  and  a\nGovernment Procurement Law.55 In September 2001, ADB\u2019s PRC Resident Mission; the Project\nCoordination and Procurement Division; and the Energy Division (East) carried out an experts\u2019\nprocurement  review  of  the  nearly  completed  Qitaihe  Thermal  Energy  and  Environmental\nImprovement  Project56  to  determine  the  adequacy  of  the  procurement  and  contracting\nprocedures  followed  by  the  EA  and  to  identify  cases  of  noncompliance  with  ADB\u2019s Guidelines\nfor Procurement and the loan documents. The main finding of the review is that ADB-financed\nprocurement  under \nthat  project  has  generally  been  carried  out  satisfactorily.  The\nrecommendations of the review for further improvement of ADB-financed procurement activities\nin the power sector in the PRC will be incorporated in the project administration memorandum\nthat will be finalized for the current Project during the Inception Mission.\n\nIn 1998, ADB provided TA57 related to the consulting industry and auditing that will also\n67.\nhelp  address  the  main  elements  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy.  Under  the  TA,  58  detailed\nguidelines  were  developed  for  the  selection  and  engagement  of  consultants,  which    take\naccount of  the  principles  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption policy,  increase transparency, and provide\nfor  equal  opportunity  competition.  Under  another  TA,  consultants  helped  strengthen  the\nGovernment's auditing system to conform with the requirements of the Audit Law and, as far as\npracticable,  international  auditing  standards.  In  particular,  that  TA  is  helping  to  (i)  formulate\ngovernment auditing standards and procedures, and (ii) design and implement an audit training\nprogram  to  promote  full  and  consistent  adherence  to  such  auditing  standards  and  procedures\nby government auditors. When completed, this work will strengthen the Government's ability to\n\n52 TA 2845-PRC: Establishment of National Procurement Regulation for the Public Sector, for $565,000, approved on\n\n                  \n\n53 TA 3457-PRC: Implementation of the Tendering and Bidding Law and Related Regulations, for $565,000, approved\n\n54 TA  3019-PRC: Policies and Regulatory Framework for the Construction Industry,  for  $570,000,  approved  on  20\n\n55 TA 3631-PRC: Preparation of a Government Procurement Law, for $578,000, approved on 20 February 2001.\n56 Loan 1328-PRC: Qitaihe Thermal Energy and Environmental Improvement Project, for $165 million, approved on\n\n57 TA  3138-PRC:  Regulatory  Framework  for  the  Engagement  of  Consultants,  for  $700,000,  approved  on\n\n58 TA  3713-PRC: Strengthening the Accountancy Profession in the PRC, for  $600,000,  approved  on  5  September\n\n20 August 1997.\n\non 14 June 2000.\n\nMay 1998.\n\n27 October 1994.\n\n22 December 1998.\n\n2001.\n\n\f27\n\ndetect  fraud  and  corruption.

LEPC  is  a  limited  liability  company  that  is  wholly  owned  by  SP.  It  is\nresponsible  for  undertaking  the  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  functions  related  to\nthe heating and electric power industry in Liaoning Province. In 2000, the total installed capacity\nin  Liaoning  Province  was  14,340  MW,  of  which  8,130  MW  was  owned  by  LEPC,  with  the\nremainder  owned  by  SPC,  independent  power  producers,  and  local  government  agencies.\nLEPC is implementing corporate restructuring by creating subsidiaries to manage specific parts\nof its operations. The company has a network of wholly owned subsidiaries.\n\nDay-to-day operations of the company are the responsibility of the General Manager. Its\n69.\nshareholding  includes  power  generating  plants,  power  distribution  companies,  construction\ncompanies, and noncore businesses that are not related to the performance of the power utility\nfunctions. When the power sector is restructured, LEPC should unbundle into successor power\ngeneration companies, one electricity transmission company, and several electricity distribution\ncompanies  for  the  urban  centers  and  counties.  LEPC  would  then  retain  the  responsibility  for\ntransmission  of  electricity  within  Liaoning  Province  and  fulfill  the  \u201csingle  buyer\u201d  function  in  the\nderegulated market. Under the current proposed framework for deregulation, LEPC will remain\nthe EA after further deregulation of the provincial power market.\n\n2. \n\nAccounting and Financial Management\n\nLEPC\u2019s  finance  department  is  responsible  for  accounting  and  financial  management.\n70.\nThe  finance  department  is  under  the  overall  supervision  of  the  chief  accountant  or  deputy\ngeneral  manager  for  finance  and  planning.  Separate  sections  are  responsible  for  tariffs,  cost\nand  management  accounting,  capital  assets,  head  office  accounting,  and  internal  finance.\nLEPC\u2019s head office supervises the financial management functions of all its subsidiaries. LEPC\nuses  accounting  systems  that  are  generally  in  accordance  with  internationally  accepted\naccounting principles. Accounts are maintained at the level of the individual business units and\nare consolidated for LEPC as a whole. The operating budget is prepared annually and reviewed\ntwice a year.\n\n71.\nThe  financial  statements  of  LEPC  and  its  subsidiaries  are  audited  by  an  independent\nexternal  auditing  firm.  The  financial  statements  are  submitted  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and\nSPC  for  approval.  LEPC  has  its  own  internal  audit  division.  Under  the  Project,  LEPC  will\nprepare annual financial statements consisting of income statements, sources and application of\nfunds, and balance sheets. It will also maintain project accounts adequate to identify goods and\nservices  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loan.  LEPC  will  have  its  financial  statements\nand  project  accounts  audited  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing  standards  by\nexternal  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  will  submit  to  ADB,  not  later  than  nine  months  after\nthe  close  of  each  fiscal  year,  certified  copies  in  English  of  financial  statements,  audited\naccounts,  and  the  auditor\u2019s  report.

Electricity sales grew at an annual rate of 5.5 percent in 1995 and 5.9 percent in\n1996. Due to the Asian financial crisis and SOE restructuring, the growth declined to 2.9 percent\nin 1997 and in 1998, electricity sales decreased by 3.7 percent. With the easing of the financial\ncrisis and the improving performance by the SOEs, sales improved in 1999 (2.3 percent) and in\n2000  (9.2  percent).  Overall,  electricity  sales  registered  a  low  increase  of  3.3  percent  per  year\nduring  1995\u20132000.  During  this  period,  there  was  an  average  tariff  increase  of  7.3  percent  per\nyear.  These increases of sales  and tariffs resulted in annual revenues  increasing by over one\nhalf  during  this  period.  Net  income  also  improved  over  three-fold  during  the  period,  with\nsignificant contributions of income from noncore activities and investments.\n\nTable 4: Summary of LEPC\u2019s Past Financial Performance\n(Y million)\n\n1995\n\n1996\n\n1997\n\n1998\n\n1999\n\n2000\n\nElectricity Sales (GWh)\nIncrease in Electricity Sales (%)\nAverage Revenue (Y/kWh)\nIncrease in Average Revenue (%)\nTotal Revenue (incl. other income)\nNet Income\nNet Fixed Assets\nCapital Expenditures\nIndicators\nReturn on Net Fixed Assets (%)\nCurrent Ratio (times)\nDebt/(Debt + Equity) (%)\nDebt Service Ratio (times)\nGWh = gigawatt-hour, kWh = kilowatt-hour.\nSource: LEPC and staff estimates.\n\n46,805\n5.5\n0.275\n2.5\n14,312\n215\n 11,702\n2,290\n\n3.2\n1.6\n33.5\n5.7\n\n49,549\n5.9\n0.313\n13.9\n16,579\n211\n\n51,000\n2.9\n0.337\n7.6\n19,165\n211\n 12,513    12,778\n2,768\n\n2,331\n\n49,109\n(3.7)\n0.347\n2.8\n19,918\n835\n\n50,236\n2.3\n0.356\n2.8\n19,001\n540\n 13,766     13,583\n427\n\n2,784\n\n54,863\n9.2\n0.392\n9.9\n22,965\n660\n    15,439\n3,143\n\n3.1\n1.7\n35.3\n4.2\n\n2.3\n1.6\n43.3\n4.5\n\n6.4\n2.2\n34.5\n1.2\n\n4.6\n2.1\n42.3\n1.5\n\n4.9\n2.3\n50.7\n2.0\n\n73. \nThe financial ratios of LEPC were generally satisfactory. The debt service coverage ratio\nranged  from  1.2  to  5.7  times,  and  was  2.0  times  in  2000.  Though  LEPC\u2019s  debts  increased\nduring  the  period,  the  debt-equity  ratio  in  2000  was  satisfactory  at  51:49.  Between  1995  and\n2000, the average return on net fixed assets (historic book value) ranged from 2.3 percent to 6.4\npercent,  with  4.9  percent  in  2000.  The  average  period  of  accounts  receivable  was  25  days  at\nthe end of 2000.\n\nb. \n\nProjected Financial Performance 2001-2010\n\nA  summary  of  the  projected  financial  performance  of  LEPC  is  shown  in  Table  5,  and\n74.\ndetailed  projections  of  LEPC\u2019s  financial  performance  are  in  Appendix  6.  Electricity  sales  are\nprojected  to  grow  on  average  by  4.1  percent  a  year  until  2005  and  by  3.6  percent  a  year\nthereafter  until  2010.  This  compares  conservatively  with  the  annual  growth  of  well  over  5\n\n\f29\n\npercent  in  the  noncrisis  years  during  1995-2000  (para.  72).  Likewise,  electricity  tariffs  are\nprojected to increase conservatively on average by 4.6 percent a year, which is much less than\nthe  7.3  percent  recorded  during  1995-2000.  With  these  and  other  assumptions,  the  financial\nratios  are  expected  to  remain  satisfactory.  The  debt  service  coverage  ratio  will  show  some\ndecline but still be above the covenanted 1.2 times.\n\nTable 5: Summary of LEPC\u2019s Projected Financial Performance\n(Y million)\n\nActual\n2000\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2005\n\n2010\n\nProjected\n2003\n\n2004\n\nElectricity Sales (GWh)\nIncrease in Electricity Sales (%)\nAverage Revenue (Y/kWh)\nIncrease in Average Revenue (%)\nTotal Revenue (incl. other income)\nNet Income\nNet Fixed Assets\nCapital Expenditures\nIndicators\nReturn on Net Fixed Assets (%)\nCurrent Ratio (times)\nDebt/(Debt + Equity) (%)\nDebt Service Ratio (times)\n\n4.5\n\n4.0\n\n4.2\n\n9.2\n\n  54,863   57,327   59,727   62,135   64,632   67,071   80,282\n3.5\n    0.392     0.408     0.422     0.446     0.467     0.495     0.614\n4.4\n9.9\n24,756 26,371 28,872 31,346 34,336 50,411\n22,965\n2,018\n660\n  15,439\n 15,448   15,581   15,672   20,372   20,650   24,195\n    3,143     2,357     2,590     4,288     3,942     2,888     4,681\n\n1,027\n\n1,214\n\n1,275\n\n613\n\n655\n\n3.5\n\n4.7\n\n5.7\n\n4.1\n\n5.9\n\n3.8\n\n4.0\n\n4.9\n2.3\n51\n2.0\n\n8.3\n2.3\n50\n1.3\n\n8.6\n2.4\n49\n1.3\n\n10.9\n2.4\n50\n1.4\n\n9.2\n2.5\n50\n1.5\n\n10.2\n2.5\n48\n1.2\n\n11.4\n2.3\n42\n1.2\n\nGWh = gigawatt-hour, kWh  = kilowatt-hour.\nSource: LEPC and staff estimates.\n\n4. \n\nRural Electricity Tariffs\n\ntariff \n\nfor  rural  consumers \n\nThe  average  end-consumer \n\n75.\nis\nY0.705/kWh,  about  75  percent  higher  than  the  average  end-consumer  tariffs  in  urban  areas.\nWith rural electrification programs to improve the efficiency of rural electricity supply by 15\u201320\npercent,  LEPC  is  in  a  position  to  share  these  efficiency  gains  with  its  rural  consumers  by\nlowering their tariffs without compromising its profitability. Time-of-day tariffs currently apply only\nto industrial and commercial users, and seasonal tariffs are not used. In 2000, LEPC introduced\na  unified  tariff  for  the  entire  province  (the  same  tariff  applies  to  the  same  consumer  category\nthroughout  the  province).  The  next  step  for  tariff  reforms  in  Liaoning  Province  is  to  implement\nthose identified and agreed upon under the tariff reform action plan (para. 37).\n\nin  Liaoning  Province \n\n5.   \n\nFinancial Viability of the Project\n\n76.\nLEPC  will  recover  its  cost  for  the  500  kV  component  of  the  Project  through  an\nincremental transmission charge to be approved by the Pricing Bureau of Liaoning Province and\nSDPC, and to be applied to all of LEPC\u2019s electricity sales. Based on the present cost estimate it\nis  envisaged  that  this  incremental  transmission  charge  will  be  Y0.0065  per  kWh.  It  will  cover\noperating  costs  including  maintenance  and  depreciation  and  will  allow  a  reasonable  return  on\nnet fixed assets (of a minimum of 9 percent), adjusted for inflation, and cash generation to cover\ndebt  service  payments  and  working  capital  requirements.  The  further  design  of  transmission\ntariffs  in  Liaoning  Province  will  be  supported  by  the  competitive  power  market  development\ncomponent under the Project.\n\n\f30\n\nH. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.   \n\n Environment\n\nAn  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  has  been  prepared  for  the  Project.  The  IEE\n77.\ndoes not anticipate significant environmental impacts, and, accordingly, the Project is classified\nas environment category \"B.\" The IEE confirms that the transmission line corridor will not cross\nknown  archeological  sites  or  pristine  natural  forest  and  has  been  routed  to  avoid  protected\nareas.  The  transmission  line  will  traverse  150  km  of  land  classified  as  woodland,  which\ncomprises  secondary  natural  forest,  plantation  forest,  windbreaks,  and  orchards.  Along  such\nsegments, felling of trees required for stringing of transmission lines and construction of towers\nwill be compensated by tree planting in accordance with provincial regulations. The IEE reports\nthat the proposed route does not hinder wildlife migratory routes. As a precautionary measure,\nhowever,  prior  to  commencement  of  the  construction  of  the  transmission  line  additional  study\nwill be undertaken to address possible impacts on migration of wild geese that may arise along\nspecific sections of the 80 km segment between Pulandian and Wafangdian counties where the\ntransmission  line  will  parallel  the  existing  500  kV  transmission  line.  Mitigation  measures  have\nbeen  identified  to  address  relatively  minor  and  unavoidable  impacts  associated  with  the\nconstruction  and  operation  phases.  Existing  standards  and  regulations  will  be  followed,\nincluding those concerning exposure to electromagnetic radiation. An EMMP has been finalized\nand reviewed by the Environment Protection Bureau of Liaoning Province and ADB, and will be\nused during project implementation.\n\n2.         Social Measures\n\n78.\nLEPC has submitted a LARP, which was found acceptable by ADB and was published\non ADB\u2019s web site. A total of 95 households (401 persons) would need to be relocated under\nthe  Project.  The  construction  of  the  transmission  line  and  the  substations  will  require  the\npermanent  acquisition  of  20.57  hectares  (ha),  of  which  9.97  ha  are  cultivated  farmland  and\n10.60  ha  are  nonfarmland,  and  the  demolition  of  89  houses.  The  construction  of  the\ntransmission line and related facilities will also require the temporary use of 595.21 ha, of which\n166.14  ha  are  farmland  and  429.07  ha  are  nonfarmland.  The  total  number  of  households\naffected  by  the  Project  is  8,478,  comprising  25,567  persons.  All  will  receive  adequate\ncompensation,  rehabilitation,  and  income  restoration  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the\nLARP,  which  was  prepared  based  on  an  intense  public  consultations  involving  surveys  and\ncommunity  meetings  with  the  participation  of  implementing  agencies,  local  governments,  and\naffected persons. An information booklet summarizing the LARP and compensation policy was\ndistributed to all affected persons, and a Chinese version of the LARP was made available to all\naffected villages. The summary LARP is in Appendix 7.\n\n\f31\n\nV.       PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses\n\n1.\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\n79.\nLEPC  will  charge  all  its  customers  an  incremental  tariff  to  enable  it  to  undertake  the\nProject. Although not all consumers will benefit directly from the new transmission line between\nShenyang  and  Dalian,  the  indirect  longer  term  benefit  as  a  result  of  the  establishment  of  a\ncompetitive  market  for  power  generation,  facilitated  through  the  Project,  will  accrue  to  all\nconsumers.  Revenue  from  an  increase  of  Y0.0065/kWh  (at  2001  prices)  in  the  average  end-\nconsumer tariff for all electricity sold by LEPC yields a financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of\n9.2  percent  in  comparison  with  LEPC\u2019s  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,  estimated  at  2.8\npercent (after tax and in real terms). Detailed calculations are shown in Appendix 8.\n\n2.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\na.\n\nLeast-Cost Analysis\n\nTwo least-cost generation expansion alternatives for the LPG were considered (covering\n80.\n2000-2015).  Alternative  I  is  the  base  case,  which  is  to  construct  the  500  kV  transmission  line\nand grid rehabilitation to transmit electricity from the northeastern part of the northeast region to\nDalian.  Under  Alternative  II,  the  500  kV  transmission  line  and  grid  rehabilitation  would  not  be\nconstructed;  instead,  a  600  MW  thermal  power  plant  in  Dalian  is  considered  to  meet  the\ndemand  for  electricity.  The  results  indicate  that  the  least-cost  generation  expansion  scenario\nincluding the Project compares favorably with the one without the Project.\n\nThe least-cost generation expansion analysis is supported by an equalizing discount rate\n81.\n(EDR)  analysis.  In  this  analysis,  costs  of  environmental  mitigation  measures  and  the\nresettlement program have been included in the Project cost estimates. In the EDR analysis, the\n500  kV  transmission  line  to  be  constructed  under  the  Project  will  replace  thermal  power\ngeneration in Dalian. The analysis compares the investment and operation cost of the 500 kV\ntransmission line and  grid rehabilitation with that of a 600 MW thermal power plant. The main\nassumptions  for  the  substitutes,  including  the  fuel  cost  and  capital  cost,  were  found  to  be\nappropriate. The coal prices are taken from the latest World Bank commodity price projections.\nCoal  consumption,  at  310  grams  of  coal  equivalent  per  kilowatt-hour  for  new  600  MW  units,\ncompares well with international values. The capital cost of a coal-fired power plant is $586 per\nkilowatt,  based  on  the  capital  costs  of  some  recent  projects  in  the  PRC.  Transmission  and\ndistribution losses were estimated at 8 percent, and annual operation and maintenance costs of\ntransmission and distribution facilities at 2 percent of the capital investment cost. The results of\nan  environmental  impact  evaluation  were  incorporated  into  the  EDR  analysis.  Without\nenvironmental impact, the EDR shows that the 500 kV transmission line and grid rehabilitation is\nsuperior  up  to  a  discount  rate  of  12.1  percent,  compared  with  the  alternative  of  locating  the\nthermal plant in Dalian. If the national environmental benefits are taken into account, the EDR\nincreases  to  19.7  percent.  If  the  reliability  and  efficiency  improvement  of  the  transmission\nsystem  are  taken  into  account,  the  levelized  unit  costs  show  that  the  unit  cost  of  producing\nelectricity in the northern part of the northeast power region and transmitting it to Dalian is only\nabout 0.3 percent lower than the cost of producing electricity in Dalian. However, if the adverse\nenvironmental impacts of producing additional power at Dalian are taken into account, the cost\nwould be 7.5 percent lower than that of the alternative.\n\n\f32\n\nb.\n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return\n\n82.\nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  calculations  cover  (i)  the  500  kV\ntransmission line and grid rehabilitation components, (ii) the rural electrification component, and\n(iii) the whole Project. No separate analysis was undertaken for the competitive power market\ndevelopment component due to the difficulties in quantifying its benefits. However, the costs of\nthis component have been included in the EIRR calculation for the whole Project.\n\n83.\nAs in the least-cost analysis, the economic analysis used the conversion factors;\ninvestment  costs  for  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution;  fuel  costs;  and  operation  and\nmaintenance costs where applicable. For EIRR calculations, the benefits of energy output were\nvalued  based  on  consumer  willingness  to  pay  and  on  end-consumer  tariffs.  Transmission  and\ndistribution losses were estimated based on the historical loss rates in the LPG. The results of the\nEIRR  analysis  for  the  500  kV  transmission  line  and  grid  rehabilitation  components  show\nefficiency  improvement  (reduced  losses)  and  increased  supply  as  the  major  benefits.  This\napproach, which does not include the benefit of improved quality of supply, yielded an EIRR of\n16.0  percent  for  the  transmission  component.  The  EIRR  analysis  for  the  rural  electrification\ncomponent  also  shows  efficiency  improvement  (reduced  losses)  and  increased  supply  as  the\nmajor  benefits.  This  calculation,  which  does  not  include  the  impact  on  rural  economic\ndevelopment  and  other  benefits,  yielded  an  EIRR  of  18.4  percent  for  the  rural  electrification\ncomponent.  The  EIRR  for  the  whole  Project    (without  national  environmental  benefits),  which\nincludes the costs for the competitive power market development component and the closure of\nsmall, inefficient power plants component, is 18.5 percent.\n\n84.\nAn economic evaluation of the environmental impacts of the Project, carried out based\non the benefits transfer method, used methodology adopted in ADB\u2019s Workbook on Economic\nEvaluation of Environmental Impacts (1996) to determine the adjusted estimate of the monetary\ndamages caused by air pollution during the study period, taking into account the location of the\npower plant, emission levels, GDP growth, and the population affected.60 If the economic cost of\nthe environmental impacts of a comparable coal-fired power plant in Dalian were added to the\nbenefits  of  the  proposed  Project,  the  EIRR  for  the  for  the  500  kV  transmission  line  and  grid\nrehabilitation  components  would  increase  to  17.9  percent,  and  for  the  whole  Project  to  24.9\npercent. The environmental impacts of the rural electrification component, which are expected\nto be positive and substantial, were not quantified due to difficulties in gathering the necessary\ndata (Appendix 9).\n\nB. \n\nEnvironment\n\n85.\nThe environmental benefits in the project area in terms of reduced emissions because of\nthe  closure  of  coal-fired  power  plants,  and  because  of  avoided  emissions  due  to  the\npostponement  of  a  new  600  MW  coal-fired  power  plant  in  the  Dalian  area  and  efficiency\nimprovements in the rural electricity distribution system, are estimated at 324,600 tons of SO2,\n164,600 tons of NOx, 215,100 tons of TSP, and 44.53 million tons of CO2. These benefits have\nbeen  included  in  the  economic  evaluation  of  the  Project  (Appendix  10).  In  addition,  the\ntransportation  and  handling  of  about  1.3  million  tons  of  coal  a  year  from  the  Inner  Mongolia\nAutonomous  Region  to  the  Dalian  area  will  be  avoided.  In  the  rural  areas  under  the  Project,\n\n                  \n\n60 The  estimates  of  average  annual  climate  change  for  carbon  emissions  were  also  carried  out  to  evaluate  the\nmonetary damages caused by greenhouse gas emissions. However, the estimated global environmental impacts\nwere not included in the economic analysis.\n\n\f33\n\nhouseholds spend an average of 2\u20132.5 hours a day for cooking and require space heating for\nabout  four  months  a  year.  According  to  recent  medical  studies  the  average  incidence  rate  of\nrespiratory  diseases  (such  as  chronic  bronchitis,  throat  infection,  and  tonsillitis)  for  such  rural\nhouseholds  is  about  78  percent,  which  is  about  50  percent  higher  than  for  areas  where\ncentralized  heating  is  provided.  The  health  benefits  associated  with  switching  from  the  use  of\nfuelwood, straw, and coal to electricity are estimated to average Y156 per capita a year.61 LEPC\nestimates  that  about  20  percent  of  the  rural  households  under  the  Project  will  completely\nsubstitute fuelwood, straw, and coal for electricity within 5 years, and about 40 percent will do so\nwithin  10  years.  The  average  health  benefits  for  the  rural  population  under  the  Project  are\nestimated to be Y31 per capita a year by 2006 and Y62 per capita a year by 2011. At present\ntotal straw and fuelwood consumption by the rural households under the Project is about 1.22\nmillion tons a year, which would decrease by about 244,000 tons a year by 2006 and 488,000\ntons a year by 2011. Also, the health benefits for women will be greater than for men. Based on\nsurveys,  it  was  found  that  women  do  about  96  percent  of  the  cooking  and  thus  inhale  more\nsmoke and emissions than do men.\n\nC. \n\nImpact on Poverty \n\n86.\nThe transmission component of the Project will indirectly benefit the entire population of\n12.2 million residing in the Project area, which includes the municipalities of Dalian, Shenyang,\nAnshan, and Fushun, through efficiency improvement of electricity transmission and distribution.\nThis  area  includes  about  788,000  rural  poor  people  with  an  annual  per  capita  income  of  less\nthan Y1,000 and about 756,000 urban poor with an annual per capita income of not more than\nY3,000 for urban centers of the municipalities of Dalian, Shenyang, Anshan, and Fushun. The\nrural  electrification  upgrading  and  transmission  component  of  the  Project  will  directly  benefit  a\ntotal population of about 2 million in the three national poverty counties (Kanping, Xiuyan, and\nXianbin, which are the poorest among the nine national poverty counties in Liaoning Province)\nand in Zhuanghe city,  which has been designated as a poverty city by Dalian municipality. Of\nthe 2 million, about 215,000 or about 10.8 percent are poor people (with an annual per capita\nincome  of  less  than  Y1,000  in  the  poverty  counties  and  Y2,000  in  the  poverty  city  under  the\nProject). This component will make  electricity supply more reliable and affordable for the poor\n(efficiency  gains  in  electricity  supply  of  15\u201320  percent  are  projected).  The  increased  use  of\nelectricity  by  the  poor  is  expected  to  decrease  the  use  of  alternative  fuels  such  as  straw,\nfirewood,  and  coal,  which  has  adverse  environmental  and  health  impacts.  The  incidence  of\npoverty in the project area as a whole stands at 12.4 percent.\n\nThe  share  of  net  economic  benefits  directly  accruing  to  the  poor  is  estimated  at  17.3\n87.\npercent. Since this ratio is higher than the ratio of poverty population over total population in the\nproject  area  (12.4  percent),  the  Project  is  considered  to  support  pro-poor  growth.  The  17.3\npercent share of net economic benefits does not include the indirect benefits of the Project that\nwould accrue to the poor, such as improved air quality and environment. The Project\u2019s rural grid\nrehabilitation  program  in  the  poverty  area  is  expected  to  generate  about  Y23.9  million  in\nemployment benefits for unskilled labor. In addition, local procurement of the materials required\nfor  the  program  is  expected  to  create  about  1,600  new  jobs,  which  will  require  about  Y17.1\nmillion in paid wages to provide the materials. Under the proposed tariff reforms, rural electricity\ntariffs  for  residential,  industrial,  commercial,  agricultural,  and  other  consumers  will  decline  by\n13.7 percent, 37.7 percent, 2.9 percent, 34.6 percent, and 33.4 percent, respectively by 2004.\nThis  will  produce two direct benefits for the rural consumers: it will (i) increase rural electricity\n\n                  \n\n61 Including avoided medical cost and absence from work. The estimate is comparable to the estimate made by Xia\n\nGang in 1997 in An Estimate of the Economic Consequences of Environmental Pollution in China.\n\n\f34\n\nconsumption, and (ii) provide cost savings as a result of lower electricity tariffs. The successful\nimplementation  of  the  rural  tariff  reduction  program  has  the  potential  to  set  a  precedent  that\ncould  be  widely  replicated  in  the  PRC.  This  would  have  far-reaching,  positive  impacts  on  the\npoor, since poverty in the PRC is largely a rural phenomenon.\n\nD. \n\nRisks\n\n88.\nA  careful  load  forecast  with  regard  to  the  projected  increase  in  power  demand  in  the\nDalian area has been carried out, where shortage in power supply is projected. With the Project,\nLEPC will have no major problems in transmitting surplus power from the north in the northeast\npower  region.  The  Project  remains  financially  and  economically  viable  if  there  is  a  more\nmoderate economic growth in the Dalian area. Thus a lower load growth is not a major project\nrisk.  As  the  Project  is  based  on  proven  design  and  the  proposed  technology  has  been\nsuccessfully  used  in  the  PRC,  no  significant  technical  risks  are  anticipated.  The  risk  of  a\nsignificant construction delay is low, given LEPC\u2019s proven experience in the implementation of\nlarge-scale transmission projects in the PRC and abroad, and the assistance to be provided by\nproject implementation consultants. Financial sustainability of the Project and LEPC is assured\nthrough the implementation of agreed upon tariffs during project implementation, and close ADB\nmonitoring of the same.\n\nTo  complement  the  deterministic  economic  analysis,  a  probabilistic  risk  analysis  was\n89.\nperformed using the Monte Carlo simulation technique62 (Appendix 11). Six parameters, namely\ncapital cost, foreign exchange rate, implementation delay, willingness to pay, incremental power\nsupply, and line loss reduction benefits, were selected as the crucial risk variables because of\ntheir  significant  impact  on  the  Project\u2019s  economic  viability.  The  probability  of  the  EIRR  falling\nbelow 12 percent is about 11 percent. The expected EIRR, based on the weighted average of\nall simulated combinations is 15.8 percent (with a standard deviation of 2.9 percent63), about 2.7\npercentage points lower than the base case value without consideration of project risks.\n\n90.\nIn addition to the risk analysis, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the impact of\nvariations  in  some  parameters  on  the  EIRR  and  FIRR.  The  results  indicate  that,  even  under\nadverse conditions, the EIRR would be 13.7 percent and the FIRR would be in the order of 6.9\npercent,  which  is  above  LEPC\u2019s  estimated  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  2.8  percent  in\nreal terms after tax. Changes in the foreign exchange rate of the Yuan within reasonable limits\nwould  not  constitute  a  risk  to  the  viability  of  the  Project.  The  tariff-setting  mechanism  allows\nLEPC to recover all costs including operating costs and debt-service requirements and to earn a\nreasonable rate of return on net fixed assets (Table 6).\n\n                  \n\n62 The  simulation  was  carried  out  using  the  Risk  Master  computer  software.  Monte  Carlo  simulation  works  by\ngenerating  a  series  of  random  numbers  following  the  distribution  of  probability  of  each  risk  variable.  For  each\nsimulation, which represents a combination of different states of risk variables, EIRRs are calculated and recorded.\nThe results of 3,000 simulations are then averaged.\n\n63 A  common  statistical  indicator  of  the  risk  of  a  project  is  the  standard  deviation,  which  measures  the  dispersion\naround the expected value.

In the past, the Government\nof the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) used subsidies extensively while aiming to achieve fair\nand cost-reflective electricity pricing. Electricity pricing affects demand in the medium and longer\nterm,  and  contributes  to  rational  electricity  use,  increased  economic  efficiency,  and  greater\nprosperity. Marginal and opportunity cost pricing provides a principle for appropriate electricity tariff\nlevels  and  structures.  Social,  economic,  and  fiscal  measures  (based  on  the  taxation  and\ndistribution policies of governments) are important in mitigating against the impact of marginal cost\npricing  on  the  most  vulnerable  segments  of  the  population.  It  is  a  priority  for  the  Government  to\ncooperate  with  electricity  providers  and  establish  a  fair  and  cost-reflective  tariff  system  for\nelectricity services and reduce or eliminate nontechnical losses.\n\nB. \n\n2. \n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nCurrent Tariff Structure and Levels\n\nThe  current  uniform  tariffs  at  the  provincial  level  of  the  Liaoning  Power  Grid  (LPG)\ncomprise\n\ncatalog tariffs1 applied to recover (a) costs of state grants for all plants built before 1985;\n(b)  loans  from  the  Government  for  many  of  the  plants  built  after  1985;  and  (c)  costs  of\npower  plants  financed  by  joint  investment  from  State,  provincial  and  local  governments,\nplants  of  independent  power  producers,  and  plants  owned  by  local  governments  or\nindustries that sell surplus power to the grid; and\n\nstate  and  local  surcharges  added  to  consumer  tariffs  across  the  province.2  These\nsurcharges  are  estimated  to  be  6.3  percent  of  electricity  bills  paid  by  end  consumers  in\n2001.\n\n3.\nThe  end-consumer  tariff  structure  of  the  Liaoning  Electric  Power  Company  Ltd  (LEPC)\ncomprises  six  consumer  categories:  residential,  nonresidential  lighting,  commercial,  non-industry\nand general industry,3 large industry, and agriculture. A one-time connection fee is applied to new\nconsumers  connected  to  the  network,  which  is  determined  on  the  basis  of  the  need  to  cover\ninvestments  at  the  subtransmission/distribution  level.  In  addition,  a  two-part  tariff,  consisting  of\ncapacity and energy charges, is applied only to large industrial consumers. The capacity charge is set\nat Y22/kilowatt (kW)/month at maximum demand (and Y15/kW/month for transformer capacity), which\nis low considering the capacity cost in the LPG. There is no capacity charge for all other consumers.\nBetween  1990  and  2000,  the  real  end-consumer  tariffs  increased  on  average  by  7.7  percent\nannually.\n\nBased on the estimated long run marginal cost (LRMC)4 of electricity supply and the load\n4.\ncharacteristics  in  Liaoning  Province,  the  economic  tariffs  by  consumer  categories  and  voltage\nlevels  were  estimated  a  comparison  was  made  between  the  current  end-consumer  tariffs  and\nLRMC tariffs. It must be noted that end-consumer tariffs include various government levies that do\nnot  accrue  to  the  utility.  Hence,  these  tariffs,  as  a  percentage  of  LRMC,  overstate  what  actually\naccrues  to  LEPC.  While  industry  and  the  category  of  other  consumers  are  paying  tariffs  higher\n\n                  \n\n1 In 2001, the Liaoning Electric Power Company Ltd. applied uniform end-user tariffs in Liaoning Province.\n2 A  comprehensive  price  difference  was  abolished  in  the  second  half  of  2000.  At  present,  the  uniform  tariffs  include\nsurcharges  covering  the  Electricity  Construction  Fund,  the  three  Gorges  Project  Construction  Fund,  and  the  City\nPublic Utility Fund.\n\n3  Includes large non-industrial consumers such as airports and ports.\n4  Marginal  cost  valuation  provides  valuable  guidance  in  establishing  the  tariff  structure  even  if  the  level  of  marginal\n\ncosts is not totally recovered in the average tariff.\n\n\f41\n\nAppendix 2, page 2\n\nthan  the  estimated  economic  costs,  residential,  commercial,  and  agricultural  users  are  paying\ntariffs below their economic costs. Residential consumers are the main recipients of subsidies. The\naverage end-consumer tariff in the LPG in 2000 (Y0.418 kilowatt-hour [kWh]) is about 95 percent\nof  the  average  LRMC  of  supply  at  Y0.44/kWh  ($0.053/kWh).5  If  levies  not  accruing  to  LEPC  are\ndeducted, it decreases to 89 percent of LRMC.\n\nWith  the  adjustment  of  industrial  structure  and  the  rapid  increase  in  people\u2019s  living\n5.\nstandards, the gap between peak and off-peak demand in Liaoning Province has been expanding.\nThe difference of supply costs between peak and off-peak demand is also increasing. At present,\ntime-of-day (TOD) tariffs are applied to some consumer categories of the LPG.6 In 2000, the ratio\nof peak to flat energy charge was 150 percent, while the ratio of valley to flat energy charge was\n50  percent.  However,  corresponding  LRMC  ratios  would  be  about  300  percent  and  70  percent,\nrespectively.  The  tariff  blocks  are  quite  large:  11  hours  for  the  peak  block,  6  hours  for  the  flat\nblock,  and  7  hours  for  the  valley  block.  The  consumers  do  not  have  much  flexibility  to  shift  their\nconsumption  away  from  the  peak  hours.  Therefore,  the  current  TOD  tariffs  do  not  provide  a\nsufficient incentive for customers to shift their electricity consumption away from peak hours.\n\n6.\nThe present tariff structure in the LPG is relatively complex and inequitable, does not fully\nreflect  the  structure  of  supply  costs,  and  does  not  provide  adequate  incentives  for  electricity\nconservation. Within the same consumer category, consumption at lower voltage level is charged\nat higher tariff, but the difference is small compared with the difference in supply costs. The current\npricing  system,  which  involves  substantial  economic  subsidies  for  residential  consumers,  is  not\nconducive to the efficient use of electricity. Among the consumer categories, the tariff for industrial\nconsumers (Y0.425 /kWh) is higher than the LRMC of supply estimated at Y0.394/kWh. The tariffs\nfor  residential  consumers  (Y0.323/kWh)  were  only  55.6  percent  of  the  LRMC  of  supply\n(Y0.581/kWh),  and  the  tariffs  for  agricultural  consumers  (Y0.308/kWh)  were  65.4  percent  of  the\nLRMC  of  supply  (Y0.471/kWh).  As  in  other  provinces  in  the  PRC,  residential  consumers  are  the\nmain  recipients  of  the  economic  subsidies.  The  pattern  of  cross-subsidies  suggests  that  the\nindustry sector largely subsidizes electricity consumption in the agriculture and residential sectors.\n\nTariff  reforms  in  the  PRC  need  to  take  into  account  ongoing  power  sector  reforms.\n7.\nHistorically,  the  electricity  supply  in  the  PRC  has  been  considered  a  natural  monopoly,  with\neconomies of scale providing the least-cost supply options, and vertically integrated utilities were\nestablished under average cost pricing regulation. However, there is a general trend now for the\npower  industry  to  be  restructured  from  a  regulated  monopoly  to  a  competitive  market-based\nstructure.  At  present,  the  Government  is  undertaking  a  wide-ranging  institutional  restructuring\nprogram in the power sector. As LEPC\u2019s power generation functions are progressively unbundled\nas  independent  power  producers,  the  tariff  level  and  structure  need  to  be  adjusted  to  meet  the\npurchase, transmission, and distribution costs of electricity, and to provide a reasonable return on\ninvestment in transmission and distribution facilities. The development of appropriate transmission\nand  distributional  tariffs  will  be  supported  under  the  competitive  power  market  development\ncomponent of the Project.\n\n                  \n\n5(cid:1) The  concept  of  marginal  cost  pricing  is  useful  in  attempting  to  optimize  the  allocation  of  resources.  However,  the\nhigher  tariffs  that  may  result  from  the  application  of  this  principle  could  be  detrimental  to  a  country's  industrial\ncompetitiveness  or  might  deprive  lower  income  consumers  of  an  essential  service.  In  any  case,  marginal  cost\nvaluation provides valuable guidance in establishing the tariff structure even if the level of marginal costs is not totally\nrecovered in the average tariff.\n\n6  The division of the TOD system is as follows: (i) peak period: 9:00-11:00, 14:00-21:00, (11 hours); (ii) flat period: 7:00-\n8:00,  12:00-13:00,  22:00-23:00  (6  hours;  (iii)  valley  period:  24:00-6:00  (7  hours).  The  present  peak  consumption  is\naffected by a 50 percent surcharge above the base catalog tariffs. Consumption during the valley period receives a 50\npercent discount.\n\n\f42\n\nAppendix 2, page 3\n\nC. \n\nProgress of Tariff Reforms in Liaoning Province\n\nLEPC has undertaken tariff reforms7 in the following areas: (i) unifying consumer tariffs for\n8.\neach  consumer  category  under  each  of  the  provincial  level  power  systems;  (ii)  rationalizing  the\nclassification  of  consumer  categories  and  making  adequate  increases  in  the  tariff  differential  for\npower  supplies  at  adjacent  voltage  levels  to  reflect  supply  costs;  and  (iii)  improving  the  two-part\ntariff system, consisting of capacity and energy charges, by increasing the capacity charge.\n\n9.\nUniform  consumer  tariffs  for  each  consumer  category  at  the  provincial  level  became\neffective  in  July  2000.  Substantial  progress  was  made  in  improving  tariff  level  and  structure  in\nLiaoning  Province.  Most  of  the  local  surcharges  were  eliminated  by  the  end  of  1998,  and  the\nclassification of consumer categories was rationalized to include a commercial category in 2000.8\nThere were also improvements in the two-part tariff system by increasing the capacity charge for\nlarge industrial consumers from Y18/kW/Month in 1997 to Y22/kW/month in 2000, which represents\nan increase of 22 percent. There was also some increase in the tariff differential for power supplies\nat adjacent voltage levels to reflect supply cost. The average end-consumer tariff in the LPG was\nincreased from Y0.396/kWh in 1997 to Y0.418/kWh in 2000. In 1997, TOD tariffs applied only to\nlarge  industrial  consumers,  and  the  share  of  energy  sales  applied  to  TOD  tariff  was  only  30\npercent  of  LEPC\u2019s  total  energy  sales.  In  2000,  large  industrial,  non-industrial,  and  commercial\nusers could avail of TOD tariffs, and the share of TOD energy sales increased to 65.6 percent of\ntotal LEPC energy sales.\n\nD. \n\nFurther Tariff Reforms in Liaoning Province\n\n10.\nFollowing  a  tariff  study  carried  out  by  domestic  consultants  and  in  consultation  with  the\nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  LEPC  has  prepared  a  Tariff  Reform  Action  Plan.  The  plan\nincludes  a  detailed  implementation  schedule  and  an  assessment  of  the  impact  of  the  proposed\ntariff  adjustments  on  residential  consumers.  The  proposed  new  tariff  system  is  based  on  LRMC\nprinciples  and  is  compatible  with  ongoing  power  market  reforms.  The  relevant  provincial  and\nCentral government authorities support the implementation of the plan.\n\n11.\nCurrently, the average tariffs, including government levies not accruing to LEPC,  are about\n95  percent  of  the  LRMC  of  supply,  which  is  considered  a  reasonable  level.  The  proposed  tariff\nreforms  envisaged  under  the  plan  will  focus  on  making  further  adjustments  to  the  pricing  of\nelectricity based on the economic cost of supply and will improve the tariff structure to better reflect\neconomic costs. The following milestones have been agreed upon:\n\n1.\n\nBy December 2002\n\nThe main task for 2002 is to rationalize the shares of generation tariffs and network tariffs\n\n12.\nwithin the overall tariffs. For this purpose, the following tariff reforms are required:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii) \n\nadjusting generation and network tariffs to reflect economic cost of supply,\n\nmerging the electric power construction fund (surcharges) as part of network tariffs,\nand\neliminating the consumer one-time connection fee.9\n\n                  \n\n7  Under  Loan  1582-PRC:  Northeast China Power Transmission,  for  $150  million,  approved  on  25  November  1997,\n\nLEPC was required to undertake tariff reforms.\n\n8  In 1997, there was no consumer category for commercial consumers. The large commercial consumers are classified\n\nas industrial consumers, while the other commercial consumers are treated as nonresidential lighting.\n\n9 The  one-time  connection  fee  needs  to  be  abolished  by  the  end  of  2001  according  to  the  State  Development  and\n\nPlanning Commission.\n\n\fBy December 2003\n\n13.\n\nDuring 2003, LEPC will reform its tariff structure. The proposed tariff reforms include:\n\n43\n\nAppendix 2, page 4\n\nestablishing the pricing mechanism of network price and enabling the network price\nto reach to the price level based on the LRMC of supply; the determination of the\npricing  mechanism  will  be  supported  by  the  component  of  competitive  power\nmarket development under the Project;\n\nrationalizing  consumer  categories \nto  eliminate  or  merge  some  consumer\ncategories; after this rationalization, the consumer categories in Liaoning Province\nwill  include  only  the  following  five  categories:  residential,  industrial,  agricultural,\ncommercial, and other consumers;\n\napplying a two-part tariff to more consumer categories (connected to 1-10 kilovolts\n[kV]  and  higher);  the  consumer  categories  to  whom  two-part  tariffs  will  be  applied\nwill include industrial, agricultural, commercial, and other consumers (connected to\n1-10 kV and higher); and\n\napplying  TOD  tariffs  to  more  consumers  and  adjusting  TOD  tariffs  toward  the\neconomic  cost  of  supply;  to  accurately  reflect  the  differences  in  supply  costs  in\ndifferent time blocks, LEPC will further increase the consumer base to which it will\napply TOD tariffs.\n\n2.\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n14. \n\nDuring 2004, LEPC will increase the capacity charges to reflect economic costs.\n\n3.\n\nBy December 2004\n\n4.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2010\n\n15.\nDuring this period, the tariffs for all consumer categories will be gradually adjusted toward\nthe economic cost of supply. By December 2010, the tariff structure and levels should be improved\nbased on the 2004 tariff structure and comparable with the LRMC of supply.\n\nE. \n\nTariff Reforms in Rural Areas in Liaoning Province\n\nTo  reduce  the  use  of  coal  and  biomass  for  energy  generation  and  to  promote  economic\n16.\ndevelopment in rural areas, the Government is aiming to provide a basic supply of grid-connected\nelectricity  to  all  rural  consumers  at  an  affordable  tariff.  For  this  purpose,  a  rural  electrification\ncampaign was begun in 1998 whereby the fixed costs of rural electrification are largely borne by\nthe  Government  through  dedicated  funding  and  the  connection  costs  are  partially  or  totally\nabsorbed by the service provider. In addition to the rural electrification program, the Government\nalso instructed the provincial electricity companies to reduce rural tariffs and bring them in line with\nthe  tariff  levels  for  urban  consumers.  There  would  be  an  implicit  subsidy  when  rural  consumers\nhave  the  same  electricity  tariff  as  urban  consumers,  because  the  cost  of  supplying  electricity  to\nrural  areas  is  higher  than  to  urban  areas.  However,  the  Government  considers  that  such\ntemporary subsidies are justified, as its objective is to ensure that the rural population, in particular\nthe poor, have access to affordable electricity.\n\nAction Plan for Rural Tariff Reforms\n\n1.\n\n(i)\n\nBy  December  2002,  electricity  supply  companies  at  the  county  level  will  complete\nthe  installation  of  meters  for  all  households  and  implement  uniform  tariffs  for  all\nconsumers in each county.\n\n\f44\n\nAppendix 2, page 5\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\nBy  December  2003,  the  same  tariff  will  be  applied  to  rural  consumers  under  the\nsame category. The tariffs for different categories will be reduced to incorporate the\nefficiency gains as a result of improved rural electrification.\n\nBy December 2004, all rural consumers in Liaoning Province will be subject to the\nsame  tariffs  in  line  with  the  corresponding  tariffs  by  category  and  by  voltage  level\napplied  to  urban  consumers  in  the  province.  This  will  effectively  meet  the\nGovernment\u2019s objective to bring the rural tariffs more in line with urban tariffs.\n\nConsistent  with  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Subsidies,  between  2005  and  2010,  all  rural\ntariffs  will  be  gradually  adjusted  toward  the  LRMC  tariffs  in  rural  areas.  The\nGovernment will abolish all subsidies on electricity supply to rural areas by 2010.\n\n2.\n\nStudy on Lifeline Tariff\n\n17.\nA  lifeline  tariff  study  will  be  conducted  by  LEPC  with  a  view  to  introduce  lifeline  tariffs  in\nLiaoning Province. The determination of the desirable level of a lifeline tariff will take into account\nthe  electricity  consumption  patterns  and  the  percentage  of  disposable  income  that  rural\nhouseholds use for purchase of electricity, in terms of purchasing power parity. Lack of electricity\nsupply  to  meet  basic  needs  could  create  negative  impacts  on  health,  education,  and  economic\ndevelopment. It is envisaged that temporary \"lifeline tariffs\u201d that are justified, explicit, targeted and\ntransparent will be established for rural and urban residential consumers as a result of the study.\n\nFinancial  Impact  of  Tariff  Reforms  for  LEPC  and  Affordability  of  Tariff  Reforms  for\n\nF.\nConsumers\n\n18.\nThe impact of the proposed tariff reforms on LEPC\u2019s financial performance was assessed\nas  well  as  the  affordability  of  tariff  reforms  for  the  concerned  households.  Since  the  tariffs  for\nindustrial  and  commercial  consumers  will  decrease  under  the  proposed  tariff  reforms,  the\naffordability assessment has been limited to rural and urban residential consumers.\n\n1.\n\nFinancial Impact of the Proposed Tariff Reforms on LEPC\n\n19.\nThe financial impact of tariff adjustments on LEPC\u2019s financial performance was assessed\nby  examining  LEPC\u2019s  financial  performance  with  and  without  the  proposed  tariff  reforms.  The\nresults  indicate  that,  even  with  the  proposed  decrease  in  rural  tariffs  from  Y0.673/kWh  to\nY0.592/kWh  in  2005,  LEPC\u2019s  financial  performance  will  improve.  This  is  mainly  the  result  of\nefficiency  gains  in  the  transmission  and  distribution  of  electricity  brought  about  by  the  improved\nrural electrification system and the new tariff structure under the tariff reform action plan.\n\n2. \n\nAffordability of Tariff Reforms for Residential Consumers\n\n20.\nThe  affordability  of  reforms  was  assessed  for  residential  consumers  in  rural  and  urban\nareas. Traditionally, electricity subsidies between customer categories, i.e., cross-subsidies, have\nbeen used in the PRC, without taking into consideration the consumers\u2019 ability to pay or their level\nof  consumption.  By  2005,  urban  residential  consumers  are  expected  to  spend  about  1  percent\nmore  of  their  disposable  income  on  electricity  (from  2.75  percent  to  3.80  percent)  whereas  rural\nresidential  consumers  are  expected  to  spend  about  0.5  percent  less  (from  2.46  percent  to  2.01\npercent). These percentages are considered to be at an affordable level and comparable with such\npercentages in other developing countries.\n\n\f45\n\nAppendix 2, page 6\n\nG. \n\nPoverty Impact of Proposed Tariff Reforms\n\nThe proposed tariff reforms involve well-targeted and temporary subsidies to reflect social\n21.\nconcerns.  The  proposed  lower  rural  tariffs  could  benefit  those  who  really  need  them  and  will\nenhance the accessibility, availability, and acceptability of electricity services in the rural areas of\nLiaoning Province. The subsidies involved are visible in terms of their size, transparent in terms of\ntheir  sources  and  beneficiaries,  and  subject  to  reduction  within  a  prescribed  time  period.  The\nproposed tariff reforms envisage the elimination of all subsidies for rural electricity supply by 2010.\n\nThe proposed tariff reforms will be beneficial for the poor in the rural areas of province.10\n22.\nUnder  the  proposed  tariff  reforms,  rural  electricity  tariffs  for  residential,  industrial,  commercial,\nagricultural,  and  other  consumers  will  decline  by  13.7  percent,  37.7  percent,  2.9  percent,  34.6\npercent, and 33.4 percent, respectively, by 2004.  This will produce two direct benefits for the rural\nconsumers: it will (i) increase rural electricity consumption, and (ii) provide cost savings as a result\nof lower electricity tariffs. The increase in electricity consumption in the rural areas of province is\nexpected to lead to an average increase of the annual per capita income of Y23. Using an average\nannual  per  capita  income  of  Y1,000  for  the  poor  in  the  rural  areas.11  the  increase  in  electricity\nconsumption could lead to a 2.3 percent annual increase in the per capita income for the rural poor\nin Liaoning Province.12 Based on LEPC\u2019s projections for rural electricity consumption in the coming\nyears, the cost savings for households as a result of the proposed tariff reforms would be about\nY16.8  billion  between  2003  and  2007.  If  it  is  further  assumed  that  such  savings  will  be  used  for\ninvestments in productive activities, this could lead to an increase in the average annual per capita\nincome  of  Y77  in  the  rural  areas  of  the  province  over  a  period  of  five  years.  In  comparison  with\ntheir  average  annual  per  capita  income  of  Y1,000,  this  would  imply  an  average  increase  in  per\ncapita income of 7.7 percent between 2003 and 2007. Together the two direct effects could thus\nlead  to  an  increase  of  about  19.2  percent  in  the  average  per  capita  income  of  the  rural  poor  in\nLiaoning Province between 2003 and 2007.\n\nH. \n\nTables\n\n23. \n\nSupplementary Appendix C includes the following tables:\n\n(i) \nTable 1 \u2013 Current Tariff Level and Structure in Liaoning Province\n(ii) \nTable 2 \u2013 Historical Tariff Adjustments in Liaoning Province\n(iii) \nTable 3 \u2013 LRMC-based Tariffs for Electricity Consumers in Liaoning Province\n(iv) \nTable 4 \u2013 Comparison of Actual Tariffs in 2000 with LRCM-based Tariffs\n(v) \nTable 5 \u2013 Proposed Tariffs to be Implemented by LEPC by December 2000\n(vi) \nTable 6 \u2013 Proposed Tariffs to be Implemented by LEPC by December 2003\nTable 7 \u2013 Proposed Tariffs to be Implemented by LEPC by December 2004\n(vii) \n(viii)  Table 8 \u2013 Proposed Tariffs to be Implemented by LEPC by December 2010\n(ix) \n(x) \n\nTable 9 \u2013 Rural Tariffs Reform in Liaoning Province\nTable 10 \u2013 Affordability Assessment with Tariff Reforms (Residential)\n\n                  \n\n10 The  poverty  impact  analysis  assesses  quantitatively  the  role  of  electricity  in  the  rural  economic  growth  in  Liaoning\nProvince  using  the  extended  Cobb-Douglas  production  function.  The  econometric  analysis  provides  quantitative\nevidence on the contribution of proposed tariff reforms to economic growth and income improvement of the rural poor\nin the Province.\n\n11 An annual per capita income of not more than Y1,000 was used for the poverty assessment of the Project.\n12 The tariff effect was estimated using the estimated price elasticity of income.\n\n\f46\n\nAppendix 3\n\nPROJECT COST ESTIMATES\n($ million)\n\nItem\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal Currency\n\nTotal\nCosts\n\nA.

Electricity sales are projected to\nincrease  by  4.5  percent  in  2001,  4.0  percent  thereafter  annually  up  to  2004,  and  3.5  \u2013  3.8\npercent annually up to 2010. Although the projected electricity sales growth of 20-22 percent for\nthe periods 2001-2005 and 2005-2010 is slightly higher than the sales growth for 1995-2000 (17\npercent),  it  is  considered  reasonable,  taking  into  account  the  gross  domestic  product  growth\nprojections for the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and the lower rates during 1997-1999 due\nto the Asian financial crisis and overall state-owned enterprise reform.\n\n3.\n\nPrices, Inflation, and Exchange Rate\n\n4.\nForeign costs are estimated to increase at about 2.4 percent a year over the projection\nperiod. The annual escalation rates of local currency costs are assumed at 2.5 percent for 2002,\nand 4 percent thereafter. The projections use an exchange rate of Y8.30 to $1.00.\n\nC.\n\nIncome Statements\n\n1.\n\nRevenue\n\n5.\nRevenue is calculated from the electricity sales and the average tariff (unit revenue) per\nkilowatt  hours  (kWh)  of  electricity  sold.  Annual  tariff  increases  are  based  on  the  average\nbetween  an  annual  tariff  increase  of  0.38  percent  (in  real  terms),  which  will  provide  LEPC  a\nreturn on net fixed assets of 5 percent, and of 1.3 percent (in real terms) as projected by LEPC.\nA one-time adjustment of Y0.0065/kWh (real 2001 prices) is assumed for the 2005 incremental\ntariff  as  the  cost  recovery  mechanism  for  the  Project.  This  adjustment  reflects  an  extra  1.45\npercent  price  increase  for  all  LEPC  customers  to  provide  approximately  Y450  million  as  the\nrevenue of LEPC for each subsequent year.\n\n2.\n\nCost of Coal\n\n6.\nLEPC\u2019s average consumption of standard coal (7,000 kilocalories per kilogram) is about\n430 grams/kWh; this will decline by about 2 grams/kWh annually due to the installation of new\nthermal  power  plants.  The  cost  of  standard  coal  in  Liaoning  Province  was  Y305/ton  in  2000.\nThis  price  is  expected  to  increase  by  4  percent  between  2001  and  2004  and  by  6  percent\nthereafter. The coal price appears higher than the current international price of coal ($30/ton or\n\n\f51\n\nAppendix 6, page 2\n\nY260/ton),  where  the  PRC  is  a  significant  player  in  the  market.  It  is  considered  a  reasonable\nestimate of the maximum future coal price considering the fact that, with upgrading of existing\npower  stations  and  sale  of  power  stations,  LEPC\u2019s  dependency  on  coal  will  be  significantly\ndiminished over the next-five year period (from 1,020,000 tons in 2000 to 102,000 tons in 2005).\n\n3.\n\nPurchase of Power\n\n7.\nLEPC  purchases  power  from  other  power  producers  to  meet  increasing  customer\ndemands  above  its  own  installed  capacity.  Power  purchased  from  small  independent  power\nplants in the next five years will have a purchase price between Y0.15/kWh and Y0.26/kWh in\nconstant 2000 prices. These prices may be considered on the lower end of the spectrum in light\nof the current new entry price for new generation. However, this assumption, does not pose a\nrisk for LEPC, as under the proposed deregulation in the PRC, LEPC is most likely to become\nthe regulated transmission company with a guaranteed reasonable return by the regulator, while\nthe generation and distribution functions will transferred to other entities.\n\n4.\n\nOther Operating Expenses\n\nOther  operating  costs \n\n8.\ninclude  personnel,  distribution,  administration,  and  other\nexpenses.    These  are  projected  to  increase  in  accordance  with  the  increase  in  electricity\ngeneration and distribution operations. The wage escalation rate is assumed to be 4 percent for\nevery year.  In 2000, the total sales were 54,863 gigawatt hour (GWh); since LEPC employed\n63,000 people, this was 0.87 GWh sold per employee. This figure is significantly low relative to\nsimilar  vertically  integrated  electricity  utilities  in  other  countries.  A  figure  of  1.2  GWh  per\nemployee  or  higher  is  not  uncommon  even  in  some  Asian  countries.  So  in  the  event  of\nderegulation in the PRC\u2019s electricity industry, the operational expenses are likely to be less than\nthe forecast levels used in this document.\n\n5.\n\nDepreciation\n\n9.\nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis that uses the estimated remaining life\nof  the  fixed  assets.  A  straight-line  depreciation  of  4.36  percent  is  assumed  over  22  years  of\nproject life.\n\nInvestments  of  LEPC  are  estimated  to  earn  interest  at  the  short-term  interest  rate  of

PLAN\n\nA. \n\nIntroduction\n\nThe implementation of land acquisition and resettlement activities for the Project\n1.\nwill be governed by the Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plan (LARP). The LARP was\nprepared by the Liaoning Electric Power Company Ltd (LEPC) in full compliance with the\nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)'s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  as  detailed  in  the\nADB Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice.\n\nB. \n\nResettlement Policy of the LARP\n\nThe resettlement policy in the LARP reflects both the Borrower\u2019s regulations and\n2.\nADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy.  The  main  principles  of  the  policy  are  that  (i)\nnegative impacts will be minimized as much as possible, (ii) resettlement/compensation\nwill be carried out so as to improve or at least restore the preproject living standards of\nthe  affected  people  (AP),  (iii)  the  AP  will  be  thoroughly  informed  and  consulted  on\ncompensation  options  and  the  design  of  resettlement  plans,  (iv)  compensation  of\naffected  assets  will  be  provided  at  replacement  cost,  and  (v)  compensation  for  lost\nassets and subsidies will be provided in full prior to ground leveling and demolition.\n\n3. \nThe  resettlement  policy  in  the  LARP  stipulates  eligibility  and  entitlement\nprovisions  for  the  Project\u2019s  AP.  These  entail  provisions  for  land,  house,  and  crops\nlosses, and for resettlement subsidies, as follows:\n\nPermanent land losses  will  be  compensated  as  follows: (a) AP  affected\nby  agricultural  and  residential  land  losses  will  be  compensated  through\n\u201cland  x  land\u201d  arrangements  by  means  of  land  reallocation  within  village\ndomains;  (b)  cash  compensation  for  lost  land  will  be  paid  at  rates\nstipulated  by  the  1998  Land  Law  to  the  villages,  which,  in  turn,  will  use\nthe  funds  received  for  infrastructure  and  services  directly  benefiting  the\naffected communities; and (c) the rate selected for land compensation is\nequivalent to 10 times the average annual output value (AAOV) over the\nthree years prior to land acquisition.\n\n(ii) \n\nTemporary land losses  will  be  compensated  directly  to  the  AP  at  a  rate\ncorresponding to two times the AAOV.\n\n(iii)  House  losses  will  be  directly  compensated  to  the  AP  in  cash  at\n\nreplacement cost free of demolition expenses and salvaged materials.\n\n(i) \n\n(iv)\n\ninclude \n\nCrops  losses  will  be  directly  compensated  to  the  AP  in  cash  at  the  rate\nequivalent  to  the  AAOV  for  each  harvest  lost.  The  AP  will  also  receive\n(a)  a  land  relocation  subsidy\nvarious  subsidies.  These \ncorresponding  to  15  times  the  AAOV,  to  be  paid  directly  to  the  AP\naffected by permanent land losses; (b) a resettlement subsidy equivalent\nto  Y1,050,  to  be  paid  directly  to  each  resettled  household  for  transport\ncosts,  work  loss,  transfer  costs,  medical  expenses,  and  temporary\nhousing;  and  (c)  a business losses allowance  equivalent  to  a  monthly\nquota of Y2,000, to be paid to each AP losing business income for each\nmonth of interruption of business activities.\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 7, page 2\n\nC.\n\nResettlement and Land Acquisition Impacts\n\n4. \nProject construction will require the permanent acquisition of 9.97 hectares (ha)\nof farmland and 10.60 ha of nonfarmland and will temporarily occupy 595.21 ha  (166.14\nha of farmland and 429.07 ha of nonfarmland). Project implementation will also require\nthe  demolition  of  89  houses    (in  all  5,560  square  meters  [m2])  and  a  small  apartment\nbuilding (1,000 m2). Other losses are 61 animal pens; 23 wells; 2,980 m2 of barns; 4,750\nm2 of fences; and 95 toilets.\n\n5. \nAP who need to be relocated comprise 401 persons (95 households.)  A total of\n3,020 AP (1,004 households) will be affected by permanent land acquisition caused by\nthe construction of tower foundations, while 179 AP (53 households) will be affected by\npermanent  land  acquisition  connected  to  substation  construction  or  expansion.  Some\n21,967 AP (7,326 households) will be affected by temporary land acquisition.\n\nD.\n\nRehabilitation/Income Restoration Measures\n\n6. \nLand  compensation  provided  to  the  villages  will  be  used  to  finance  various\nrehabilitation  and  income  restoration  programs.  These  include  the  implementation  of\nlocal\nagricultural  extension  programs, \nenterprises, and training activities.\n\nthe  expansion  or  establishment  of  new \n\n7.\nIn addition, special provisions will be delivered to vulnerable households and to\nseverely affected AP. Vulnerable households (households with per capita income below\n$1/day, households headed by widows or divorced women, or households composed by\nelderly  AP)  will  be  entitled  to  a  subsidy  of  Y6,000  under  a  special  Social  Assistance\nFund directly financed by LEPC. Severely affected households (AP losing more than 10\npercent  of  their  land,  or  AP  who  need  to  be  relocated)  will  each  receive  two  training\nsubsidies of Y200 for one male and one female household member. These subsidies will\ncover  travel,  food,  and  lodging  expenses  for  the  beneficiaries  and  will  enable  them  to\ntravel to training centers at the township and county level, return home, and pay for their\nliving expenses for the duration of the training programs (two weeks). Training subsidies\nfor severely affected AP and fees (Y100 per student) will also be financed by LEPC.\n\nE.\n\nInstitutional Responsibilities\n\n8.\nLEPC  as  the  Executing  Agency  has  overall  planning,  implementation  and\nfinancial responsibilities. Municipal power supply companies (MPSC) will be responsible\nfor the implementation of the LARP at the local level including establishing agreements\nwith  township  governments,  delivery  of  compensation  funds,  and  internal  monitoring.\nTownship,  county,  and  village  governments  each  will  be  responsible  to  a  different\ndegree  for  land  redistribution  tasks,  asset  valuation,  consultation,  and  delivery  of\nentitlements to the AP.\n\nF.\n\nDisclosure and Public Consultation\n\n9. \nPreparation  of  the  LARP  was  based  on  an  intense  public  consultation  process\ncarried  out  through  surveys  and  community  meetings  and  involving  implementing\nagencies,  local  governments,  and  AP.  An  information  booklet  summarizing  the  LARP\n\n\f57\n\nAppendix 7, page 3\n\nand compensation policy was distributed to all AP, and a Chinese version of the LARP\nhas been made available to the affected villages.\n\nG.\n\nGrievance Procedures\n\n10. \nGrievance procedures are described in the LARP. Grievances will be first lodged\nwith the village committee. If within two weeks no settlement is reached, the complainant\nmay have one month to lodge the grievances to either LEPC, the relevant MPSC, or the\ncounty  land  administration  office.  If  within  two  more  weeks  a  case  is  still  unresolved  it\ncan  be  further  moved  up  to  the  township  land  administration  office.  Final  appeal  is\navailable in the civil courts as established by the Regulations for Administrative Redress.\n\nH.\n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\n11.\nIn collaboration with resettlement staff at the township and county level LEPC will\nmonitor  the  implementation  of  the  LARP  every  six  weeks.  External  monitoring  will  be\nassigned to an independent agency. LEPC will report quarterly to ADB on the progress\nof  land  acquisition,  resettlement,  and  compensation/rehabilitation  tasks.  External\nmonitoring  reports  will  be  sent  to  ADB  every  six  months.  The  performance  of  the\nrehabilitation program will be periodically evaluated by an external monitoring agency for\nfour years after the beginning of the Project.\n\nI.\n\nFinances\n\nThe  cost  of  resettlement  and  land  acquisition  for  the  Project  is  estimated  at\n12.\nY34.54  million  ($4.16  million).  This  comprises  compensation  for  assets,  including  land\nand  resettlement;  income  restoration  assistance;  management  costs;  monitoring;  and\ntaxes. Annual adjustments to the cost estimates will be made based on the inflation rate\nfor the previous year.\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 8, page 1\n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT\n\n1.\nDetailed financial analysis was conducted on the Project. The assumptions used\nin the financial evaluation are described below. All the costs are expressed in constant\n2001 prices.\n\nA. \n\nBenefits\n\nThe electricity sales projections are based on the load growth forecast prepared\n2\nby the Liaoning Electric Power Company (LEPC) with the assistance of its consultants,\nthe SP Power Economic Research Center, and the consultants for the preparation of the\nproject feasibility study. Electricity sales are projected to increase by 4.5 percent in 2001,\n4.0 percent thereafter annually up to 2004, and 3.5 \u2013 3.8 percent annually up to 2010.\nAlthough the forecast electricity sales growth of 20-22 percent for the period 2001-2010\nis  slightly  higher  than  the  sales  growth  for  1995-2000  (17  percent),  it  is  considered\nreasonable taking account of the Asian economic crisis and the gross domestic product\ngrowth predictions for the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).\n\nB.\n\nCosts\n\n \n\n1.\n\nCapital Costs\n\n3.\nThe capital costs include physical contingencies but exclude price contingencies\nand interest charges during construction. The construction is assumed to be carried over\nthree years as 20 percent, 50 percent, and 30 percent, respectively.  The salvage value\nat the end of 22 years is assumed to be 4 percent of capital costs.\n\n2. \n\nOperation and Maintenance Costs\n\n4.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe operation and maintenance (O&M) expenses are calculated in various parts.\n\nEquipment  Maintenance.  As  per  regulatory  guidelines  in  the  PRC,  O&M\nexpenses  are  calculated  as  1.5  percent  per  annum  of  the  original  value  of\nimported  equipment  and  as  2.5  percent  of  the  original  value  of  domestic\nequipment.  In  this  analysis  a  figure  of  2  percent  is  used  as  an  estimate  for  the\nO&M cost of the Project.\n\nMaterial and Spare Parts. These are various consumables and spare parts that\nare  required  to  maintain  equipment.  Based  on  past  statistics  an  estimate  of\nY0.001  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh)1  is  used  to  forecast  this  component,  which  is\nstandard in PRC projects.\n\nSalaries. Salaries of production, transmission, distribution, and management staff\nare  calculated  on  the  basis  of  Y0.01/kWh1,  which  is  increased  by  another  14\npercent as a provision for performance-related payments.\n\n(iv) \n\nOther.  Other \namortization and are calculated as Y0.014/kWh.1\n\ninclude \n\nfees \n\nresearch  and  development, \n\ninsurance,  and\n\n1 This is to be applied to the incremental power transmitted under the Project.\n\n                  \n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 8, page 2\n\nAs  a  result  the  overall  O&M  cost  for  the  Project  is  calculated  as  Y129.1  million\n5.\n(2001  value),  which  is  equivalent  to  3.6  percent  of  the  project  cost  including  physical\ncontingencies.\n\n3. \n\nFinancial Factors\n\na. \n\nWorking Capital Factor\n\nA  working  capital  factor  of  5  percent  of  historical  capital  cost  is  assumed  for  all\n\nb. \n\nDepreciation\n\nA  straight-line  depreciation  of  4.36  percent  is  assumed  over  the  22  years  of\n\n6.\nyears.\n\n7.\nproject life.\n\n4.   \n\nIncome Tax and Value-Added Tax\n\n8. \n The Project\u2019s taxable income is subject to 33 percent income tax and 17 percent\nValue-Added  tax  (VAT)  on  operating  revenue.  A  7  percent  urban  construction  tax,  a  3\npercent  educational  surcharge  on  VAT  sales,  and  a  1.7  percent  sales  tax  have  been\napplied to the operating revenue. The domestic annual inflation rate has been projected\nat  2  percent  for  2001-2005  and  4  percent  for  each  year  thereafter.  An  international\ninflation rate of 2.4 percent a year has been applied.\n\n5.\n\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital\n\n9. \nThe  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  is  calculated  using  the  capital\nasset  pricing  model  (CAPM)  method.  Detail  calculations  are  shown  below.  The  cost  of\nequity  is  calculated  as  11.9  percent  using  a  nominal  risk  free  rate  of  5.5  percent,  an\nequity  premium  of  6.5  percent,  and  a  debt  equity  ratio  of  60  percent.  Taking  the  tax\ndeductibility of interest payments into account, the post-tax nominal WACC is calculated\nas 6.53 percent. Since the risk premium of 1.6 percent (the difference between local and\nforeign  inflation  rates  of  4  percent  and  2.4  percent,  respectively)  was  added  to  the\nforeign  exchange  interest  rate,  the  real  WACC  is  calculated  using  the  average  local\ninflation  rate  of  3.6  percent.  This  results  in  a  2.82  percent  post-tax  real  WACC  for  the\nProject (Table 1).\n\nC. \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return\n\nTable  2  shows  the  tariff  calculation,  which  has  been  used  for  the  calculation  of\n10.\nLEPC\u2019s future revenues. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the Project is in\nTable 3 while the sensitivity analysis of the FIRR is in Table 4.\n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 8, page 3\n\n                                              Table 1: Calculation of WACC\n\nTax Rate\nExchange Rate (Yuan/US dollar)\n\n33.0%\n        8.30\n\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)\n5.5%\nRisk-Free Rate (in nominal terms)\n1.83%\nRisk-Free Rate (in real terms)\n6.50%\nEquity Premium\n        0.95\nEquity Beta\nGearing (Debt/Assets)\n60%\n3.60%\nForecast Inflation\n\nAfter-Tax Cost of Equity (in real\nterms)\nAfter-Tax Cost of Equity (in\nnominal terms)\n\n8.01%\n\n11.90%\n\nSource of Funds\n\nAmount\n\nUS$\n\nShare\n\nInterest Premium Post Tax WACC Cost of Debt\n\nADB\nDomestic Commercial Bank\nEquity\nEquity - Rural Electrification\n\nTotal\n\n      830.0     100.00\n   1,992.0     240.00\n      279.5       33.67\n      841.0     101.33\n            -\n\n0.0%\n   3,942.5     475.00 100.0%\n\n21.1% 5.79%\n50.5% 6.21%\n7.1% 11.90%\n21.3% 11.90%\n\n1.60%\n\n4.95% 1.04%\n4.16% 2.10%\n11.90% 0.84%\n11.90% 2.54%\n0.00% 0.00%\n\n1.04%\n2.10%\n\n6.53%\n\n3.14%\n\nLocal Inflation Rate\nPost-Tax WACC (in\nnominal terms)\nPost-Tax WACC (in\nreal terms)\n\n3.60%\n6.53%\n\n2.82%\n\n \n\nTable 2: Tariff Calculation for LEPC\n\nItem\nScenario: Low\nScenario: High\nScenario: Moderate\n\n2001\n    0.4037\n    0.4118\n    0.4078\n\n2002\n    0.4047\n    0.4291\n    0.4169\n\n2003\n    0.4062\n    0.4470\n    0.4266\n\n2004\n    0.4091\n    0.4500\n    0.4296\n\n2005\n     0.4101\n     0.4518\n     0.4309\n\n2010\n    0.4176\n    0.4612\n    0.4394\n\nTariff Used\nShen-Da\nTotal (in real terms)\n\n0.408\n0\n0.40775\n\n0.417\n0\n0.4169\n\n0.427\n0\n0.4266\n\n0.430\n0\n0.4295\n\n0.431\n0.0065\n0.43743\n\n0.439\n0.0065\n0.44591\n\nCum.CPI\n\n1.00000\n\n1.01250\n\n1.04550\n\n1.08732\n\n1.13081\n\n1.37581\n\nActual Tariffs\n(in nominal terms)\nCum.

The analysis used constant 2000 prices and a discount rate of\n12  percent.  Tradable  commodities  were  valued  at  border  prices  at  the  prevailing  exchange  rate\n(Y8.30/$1.00). Nontradable commodities were valued at shadow prices, using a mix of standard\nand specific conversion factors.2 The methodology and presentation of shadow prices are detailed\nin the report prepared by SPERC: Report on Shen-da Transmission Project.\n\nThe  least-cost  analyses  confirmed  the  robustness  of  the  proposed  Project.  The  Project\n2.   \nwill still be required, even if the demand growths slow to the average consumption growth rates\nof  3.6  percent  between  2000  and  2005,  3.2  percent  between  2005  and  2010,  and  2.5  percent\nbetween  2010  and  2015  (low  growth  case  projected  by  the  consultants).  Two  least-cost\ngeneration  expansion  alternatives  for  LPG  were  considered.  Alternative  I  is  the  basic  case,\nwhich  is  to  construct  the  500  kilovolt  (kV)  transmission  line  and  grid  rehabilitation  to  transmit\nelectricity  from  the  northeastern  part  of  the  northeast  region  to  the  load  center  of  Dalian.  In\nAlternative  II,  the  500  kV  transmission  line  and  grid  rehabilitation  will  not  be  constructed;\ninstead, a 600 megawatt (MW) thermal power plant in the load center is considered to meet the\nload requirement. The present values of cost flows (discounted to 2000 prices) for Alternative I\nand  II  are  Y159.75  billion  and  Y159.82  billion,  respectively.  The  results  indicate  that  the  least-\ncost  generation  expansion  scenario  including  the  Project  compares  favorably  with  the  one\nwithout  the  Project.  LPG  is  a  subgrid  of  the  Northeast  China  Power  System,  which  covers\nLiaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang and the eastern part of Inner Mongolia. A least-cost plan was also\nundertaken for the Northeast China Power System, which demonstrated that the Project is part\nof  the  least-cost  plan  for  the  Northeast  Power  System,  and  the  power  exports  from  the\nnortheastern part of the Northeast China Power System to Dalian were justified.3\n\n3.   \nThe  result  of  the  least-cost  analysis  is  supported  by  an  equalizing  discount  rate  (EDR)\nanalysis,  in  which  the  Shen-da  transmission  line  replaces  thermal  power  generation  in  Dalian.\nThe analysis compares the investment and operation cost of the 500 kV transmission line and\ngrid rehabilitation with that of a 600 MW thermal power plant in Dalian. The main assumptions\nfor the candidates, including the fuel cost and capital cost, were the same as those used in the\nleast-cost analysis. Coal consumption, at 310 grams of coal equivalent per kilowatt-hour for new\n600  MW  units,  compares  well  with  international  values.  The  capital  cost  of  a  coal-fired  power\nplant is assumed to be $586 per kilowatt, based on the real capital costs of some recent projects\nin the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Transmission and distribution losses are assumed at 8\npercent of supply power from the northeastern part of the northeast region to Dalian, and annual\noperation and maintenance (O&M) cost of transmission and distribution facilities is 2.0 percent\nof capital investment cost. The economic life of the various project components was assumed to\nbe 25 years. The results of an environmental impact evaluation (Appendix 10) were incorporated\n\n                  \n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nThe computer model GESP II (Generator of Electric System Planning) has been used for similar analysis in more\nthan 10 power projects financed by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.\nA standard conversion factor of 0.93 was used. Border prices were used for all imported items. Local costs were\nshadow priced using group and specific conversion factors: 1.0 for equipment, 1.51 for steel, 0.69 for cement, 0.63\nfor timber, 2.0 for skilled labor, and 0.67 for unskilled labor. Taxes and duties were excluded.\nThere  are  large  power  exchanges  between  the  LPG  grid  and  other  subgrids.  Liaoning  Province  is  a  net  power\nimporter. Historically, it has received hydroelectricity from Jilin Province and thermal power from Heilongjiang and\nthe eastern part of Inner Mongolia every year.\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 9, page 2\n\ninto  the  EDR  analysis.  The  costs  of  environmental  mitigation  measures  and  the  resettlement\nprogram have been included in the project costs. Without environmental impact, the EDR shows\nthat the 500 kV transmission line and griid rehabilitation is superior up to a discount rate of 12.1\npercent, compared with the alternative of locating the thermal plant in Dalian. If low unit values\nfor  national  environmental  impact  are  used,  the  EDR  will  be  19.7  percent.  The  levelized  unit\ncosts  show  that  the  unit  cost  of  producing  electricity  in  the  northeastern  part  of  the  northeast\nregion and sending it to Dalian (0.308 Y/kWh) is only about 0.3 percent lower than the cost of\nproducing electricity in Dalian (0.309 Y/kWh). However, if environmental impacts are taken into\naccount, the cost is 7.5 percent lower than that of the alternative (0.333 Y/kWh).\n\nB.\n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return\n\n4.   \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  calculations  include  (i)  the  500  kV\ntransmission line and grid rehabilitation components, (ii) the rural electrification component, and\n(iii)  the  whole  Project.  No  separate  analysis  was  undertaken  for  the  competitive  power  market\ndevelopment component and the closure of small, inefficient power plants component due to the\ndifficulties in quantifying benefits. However, the costs of these components were included in the\nEIRR calculation of the whole Project.\n\n5. \nAs  in  the  least-cost  analysis,  the  economic  analysis  used  the  conversion  factors;,\ninvestment  costs  for  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution;  fuel  costs;  and  O&M  costs,\nwhere  applicable.  For  EIRR  calculations,  the  benefits  of  energy  output  were  valued  based  on\nconsumer's  willingness  to  pay  and  end-consumer  tariffs.  Transmission  and  distribution  losses\nwere  estimated  based  on  the  statistics  of  historical  loss  rates  in  the  Liaoning  Electric  Power\nCompany  Ltd.  (LEPC).  The  results  of  the  EIRR  analysis  for  the  500  kV  transmission  line  and\nurban  grid  rehabilitation  components  show  efficiency  improvement  (reduced  losses)  and\nincreased supply as the major benefits. This conservative approach, which does not include the\nbenefit of improved quality of supply, yields an EIRR of 16.0 percent for the component (Table\n1).  Similarly,  the  results  of  the  EIRR  analysis  for  the  rural  electrification  component  show\nefficiency  improvement  (reduced  losses)  and  increased  supply  as  the  major  benefits.  This\ncalculation,  which  does  not  include  the  impact  on  the  rural  economic  development  and  other\nbenefit,  yields  an  EIRR  of  18.4  percent  for  the  component  (Table  2).  Finally,  the  EIRR  for  the\nwhole  Project,  which  includes  the  costs  for  the  competitive  power  market  development\ncomponent and the closure of small, inefficient power generation units, is 18.5 percent (Table 3).\n\nC. \n\nEnvironmental Benefits\n\nAn  economic  evaluation  of  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  Project,  carried  out  based\n6. \non  the  benefits  transfer  method,    used  (i)  methodology  adopted  in  the  Asian  Development\nBank\u2019s  Workbook  on  Economic  Evaluation  of  Environmental  Impacts  (1996)  to  determine\nadjusted  estimate  of  the  monetary  damages  caused  by  air  pollution  during  the  study  period,\ntaking  into  account  the  location  of  the  power  plant,  the  emission  level,  and  the  population\naffected; and (ii) estimates of average annual climate change for carbon emissions to evaluate\nthe  monetary  damages  caused  by  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  If  the  economic  cost  of  the\nenvironmental  impacts  of  a  comparable  coal-fired  power  plant  in  Dalian  were  added  to  the\nbenefits  of  the  proposed  Project,  the  EIRR  for  the  for  the  500  kV  transmission  line  and  grid\nrehabilitation  components  would  increase  to  17.9  percent  and  for  the  whole  Project,  to  24.9\npercent.\n\n                  \n\n4\n\nIn this analysis, costs of environmental mitigation measures and the resettlement program have been included in the\nProject estimates.\n\n\fD. \n\nSensitivity Analysis\n\n64\n\nAppendix 9, page 3\n\n7.\nSensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  base  EIRR  of  18.5  percent  for  the  whole  Project\nwould  decrease  to  (i)  16.8  percent  if  the  Project  experiences  a  cost  overrun  of  10  percent;  (ii)\n16.8  percent  if  the  project  benefits  are  reduced  by  10  percent;  (iii)  16.9  percent  if  the  Project\nwere to experience a commissioning delay of one year; and (iv) 13.7 percent if (i), (ii), and (iii)\nhappen.  In  addition,  if  willingness  to  pay  would  be  10  percent  below  expectation,  the  EIRR\nwould decrease to 17.7 percent. An assumed 20 percent lower loss reduction would reduce the\nEIRR  to  17.5  percent  and  an  assumed  20  percent  depreciation  of  the  local  currency  would\nreduce the EIRR to 17.8 percent.\n\nTables\n\nE. \n\n8.\n\nSupplementary Appendix H includes the following tables:\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Equalizing Discount Rate Analysis\nTable 2 \u2013 Willingness to Pay Calculation for Liaoning Province\nTable 3 \u2013 Willingness to Pay Calculation for Rural Areas in Liaoning Province\n\n\fCosts\n\nCapital Cost\nFixed O&M Cost\n\nTotal Cost\n\nBenefits\na.

For  the  Shen-Da  500  kV  transmission  component,  two  cases\n(with/without  the  Shen-Da  500  kV  transmission  line)  were  studied  to  identify  the  incremental\npower  flow  of  the  proposed  transmission  line.  Based  on  the  incremental  power  flow,  the\ndifferences  in  environmental  impacts  of  generation  in  Dalian  and  the  coal  mining  area  in  the\nnortheastern  part  of  the  northeast  region  were  taken  as  the  environmental  benefits  of  this\ncomponent.  For  the  component  involving  closure  of  small  power  plants,  the  alternative\ngeneration  option  was  assumed  to  be  300  megawatt  (MW)  coal-fired  thermal.    The\nenvironmental  benefit  from  the  closure  of  small  power  plants  was  the  reduced  emission  in\nLiaoning Province. The environmental impact analysis is carried out in four steps:\n\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\nStep 1: major stressors or polluters were identified;\nStep 2: impact screening was carried out for each stressor;\nStep 3: if the impacts were major, effort was made to place monetary valuation;\nand\nStep  4:  the  benefits  (costs)  flows  were  quantified  for  integration  with  the\neconomic analysis of the Project.\n\nB.\n\n Identification and Screening of Environmental Stressors\n\n2.\nAir  pollution  emissions  come  mainly  from  coal-fired  power  plants.  In  Step  2,  these\nenvironmental stressors were screened for their potential impacts on four major aspects: human\nhealth,  human  welfare,  environmental  resources,  and  global  systems.  Of  the  various  impacts,\nthe following major ones proved to be significant:\n\nHuman  Health  Impacts:  Increased  Morbidity  and  Mortality  from  Conventional  Air\n3.\nEmissions.  Health  studies  currently  focus  on  airborne  particles  that  are  small  enough  to  be\ninhaled  deeply  into  the  lungs  (called  PM10).  PM10  aerosols  resulting  from  the  combustion  of\nfossil fuels include sulfate and nitrate aerosols, acid aerosols, and other chemical constituents.\nTheir impacts include both premature mortality and chronic acute respiratory disease.\n\nHuman Welfare Impacts: Reduced Visibility and Materials Damage from Air Emissions\n\n4.\nof PM10, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and Nitrogen Oxides (NOx).\n\nVisibility Impacts:  Particulate  matter  (less  than  2.5  micrometers  in  diameter)  that  is\nemitted directly from industries or is formed in the presence of SO2 and NOx gas emissions can\nreduce visual range.\n\nBuilding  and  Materials  Impacts:  Particulate  matter  and  acid  deposition  from  SO2\nemissions  can  damage  materials.    Materials  damage  can  include  surface  soiling,  surface\nerosion,  blistering,  paint  discoloration,  corrosion  and  tarnishing  of  metals  and  electronic\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\ncomponents,  fading,  reduction  of  fabric  tensile  strength,  and  spalling  of  buildings  and\nmonuments.\n\n6.\nGlobal  Systems  Impact:  It  is  well  recognized  that  environmental  impacts  are  not\nconfined  to  the  immediate  location  or  within  country  limits  but  involve  impacts  on  the  global\nlevel. The economic value of carbon dioxide was assessed using the estimates of the Workbook\non Economic Evaluation of Environmental Impacts.\n\nC.\n\n Economic Assessment of Environmental Impacts\n\nOnce  the  major  environmental  impacts  and  their  influence  on  human  health,  human\n7.\nwelfare,  and  socioeconomic  activities  are  properly  identified,  the  next  step  is  to  value  such\nimpacts economically. In Step 3, the environmental impact of the major environmental stressors\nis  evaluated  in  three  ranges  in  terms  of  distances  to  the  plant  sites:  local  (within  30  kilometers\n[km]), regional (beyond 30 km and within 100 km), and distant (beyond 100 km and within 500 km).\n\n8.\nVarious methods are available for impact valuations, some of which require substantial\namounts  of  primary  data,  time,  and  field  investigations.  Thus  the  benefit  transfer  method  was\nused  for  this  assessment,  which  allows  using  results  from  similar  valuations  conducted  in  the\ndifferent parts of the world with proper adjustments to any particular project. While adjusting the\ndata from the results of original research in the United States to the People\u2019s Republic of China\n(PRC),  three  major  adjustments  were  carried  out  for:  (i)  GDP  differentials  between  the  United\nStates and the PRC, (ii) updating price level to 2000 constant prices, and (iii) medical cost level\ndifferentials between the United States and the PRC. For inflation adjustments, a GDP deflator\nwas  used.  Consistent  with  the  economic  life  of  the  proposed  project,  the  period  of\nenvironmental impact is assumed to be 25 years (from 2004 to 2028).\n\n9.\nIn  Step  4,  for  the  economic  valuation  of  environmental  impacts,  an  average  value  was\nused.  Based  on  the  incremental  power  flow,  the  differences  of  environment  impacts  of\ngeneration in Dalian and the coal mining area were taken as the environmental benefits of the\nShen-Da 500 kV transmission component. The generation of this power flow was assumed to\ncome  from  600  MW  coal-fired  thermal  power  plants  in  Dalian  and  the  coal  mining  area,\nrespectively. For the closure of small power plants component, the alternative generation option\nof small power plants was assumed to be 300 MW coal-fired thermal in Liaoning Province.  The\nenvironmental benefit derived by the closure of small power plants was the emission reduction\nin Liaoning Province.\n\nD.

Five  broad\ncategories of risk have been considered:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nDemand  Risk.  Demand  risk  is  related  to  lower  electricity  demand  growth  than  forecast\nand/or  breach  of  contract  by  the  purchaser.  Low  demand  growth  could  jeopardize  the\nfinancial and economic viability of the Project. Lower than the expected demand growth\nin  1999  and  2000  brought  substantial  losses  to  many  larger  power  projects  in  the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).\n\nPrice Risk. Price risk is related to changes in the willingness and ability of consumers to\npay for electricity. Recent experience in the PRC shows that the power producer could be\nconfronted with unexpected price changes in both inputs and outputs.\n\nProject  Cost  Risk.  Higher  than  estimated  project  cost  usually  results  from  (a)  higher\nequipment prices,1 or (b) exchange rate fluctuations. The major equipment and facilities\nof  generation  will  be  purchased  through  international  competitive  bidding.  Prices  could\ntherefore  be  affected  by  market  fluctuations.  Depreciation  of  the  local  currency  would\nresult in a major cost increase of the Project. Though it has been stable for a long period\nof time, there could be some risk of currency depreciation because of the PRC entrance\ninto the World Trade Organization.\n\nImplementation  Risk.  Implementation  delays  during  construction  are  a  common\nphenomenon for many infrastructure projects in the PRC.2 They are caused by a number\nof  factors,  in  particular  loan  start-up  delay  (delay  in  loan  effectiveness),  delay  of\nconstruction  due  to  interfacing  problems  among  different  suppliers,  unforeseen  site\nconditions, and inadequate construction management.\n\n(v) \n\nOperational  Performance  Risk.  Poor  operational  performance  could  be  caused  by  low\nquality  of  generating  equipment  and  facilities,  inadequate  maintenance,  and/or  poor\nmanagement.\n\n2.\nThe  risk  analysis  was  carried  out  for  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  to\nensure  the  economic  viability  of  the  Project.  Based  on  the  foregoing  considerations  and\nsensitivity  analyses,  six  variables  for  EIRR  analysis  have  been  selected  as  the  crucial  risk\nvariables  because  of  their  significant  impact  on  the  Project  is  economic  viability.  The  risk\nanalysis  was  carried  out  using  the  Monte  Carlo  simulation  technique.3  The  inputs  for  the  risk\nanalysis  are  taken  from  the  base  case  benefit  analysis/cost.  The  correlation  between  risk\n                                                       \n1  There  have  been  substantial  loan  savings  in  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  assisted  projects.  As  of  end\nSeptember 2000, of the 45 ongoing projects, 17 had loan savings totaling about $800 million. Of this, about $330\nmillion  had  been  canceled  in  consultation  with  ADB,  $300  million  is  under  discussion  for  cancellation  and  $170\nmillion is estimated as potential savings. The total loan saving on these 17 projects account for about 30 percent of\nthe loan amounts originally approved for these projects, and about 13 percent of the total loan amounts for all the\nongoing  projects.  This  was  mainly  due  to  substantial  decline  in  equipment  prices  in  the  PRC  due  to  market\nconditions. The decline in equipment prices has been taken into consideration in the cost estimates.\n\n2  Delays  in  loan  effectiveness  often  lead  to  increases  in  the  payment  of  commitment  charges,  extensions  of  loan\nclosing  dates  and  delayed  attainment  of  project  benefits.  The  average  number  of  months  elapsed  from  loan\napproval to loan effectiveness for PRC projects increased from 7.3 months in 1996 to 9.2 months at the end of 1999\nand  further  to  9.8  months  as  of  30  September  2000  (the  ADB  wide  average  is  7.2  months).  Similarly,  the  time\nelapsed from loan signing to effectiveness increased from 3.2 months in 1997 to 4.0 months as of September 2000\n(the ADB-wide average is 3.8 months).\n\n3  The  simulation  was  carried  out  using  the  Risk  Master  computer  software.  Monte  Carlo  simulation  works  by\ngenerating  a  series  of  random  numbers  following  the  distribution  of  probability  of  each  risk  variable.  For  each\nsimulation, which represents a combination of different state of risk variables, EIRRs are calculated and recorded.\nThe results of 3,000 simulations are averaged.\n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 11, page 2\n\nvariables is explicitly considered before the simulation to avoid generation of unrealistic project\nscenarios. The probability distributions attached to the selected variables take into account past\nAsian  Development  Bank  experience  in  power  projects  in  general  and  the  project/country\ncircumstances in particular. The six selected variables were capital cost, foreign exchange rate,\nimplementation  delay,  willingness-to-pay,  incremental  power  supply  and  line  loss  reduction\nbenefits, the assumed value ranges and the assumed probability distributions. The results were\nbased on 3,000 simulations.\n\n3.\nThe  expected  EIRR,  based  on  the  weighted  average  of  all  simulated  combinations,  is\n15.8 percent (with a standard deviation of 2.9 percent4), about 2.7 percent lower than the base\ncase  value  without  consideration  of  project  risks.  The  probability  for  the  EIRR  to  be  below  12\npercent is about 11 percent (cumulative distribution of EIRR).\n\nA  careful  load  forecast  for  the  demand  growth  in  Dalian  was  carried  out.  The  demand  for\n4.\npower is forecast to be lacking in Dalian, and the Liaoning Electric Power Company Ltd (LEPC) will\nhave  no major  problems  in  transmitting  the  surplus  power  in  the  northeastern  part  of  the  northeast\nregion,  even  in  the  case  of  moderate  economic  growth  in  Dalian.  All  proposed  technologies  are\ncurrently  in  successful  use  in  the  PRC.  Cost  overrun  risks  will  be  addressed  by  appropriate\nprocurement  actions;  contract  packages  for  major  components  will  be  defined  before  loan\nnegotiations.  The  risk  of  delay  in  project  construction  due  to  project  management  shortcomings  is\nminimal because of the experience gained during the implementation of the Northeast China Power\nTransmission  Project,5  the  timely  staffing  and  training  of  personnel  of  LEPC,  and  the  assistance\nprovided by experienced international engineering consultants.\n \nThe  Government  and  ADB  are  currently  going  through  necessary  steps  for  better\n5.\ncoordination  in  the  approval  processes  to  solve  the  problem  of  loan  start  up  delay.6  In  view  of\nadvanced  preparatory  work,  risks  associated  with  project  construction,  cost  overruns,  and\nimplementation delays are within reasonable limits and manageable with the agreed supervision and\ninvolvement of competent consultants. Particular attention will be given to the safety aspects of the\nProject, and to the capabilities and performance of major contractors. All the above analyses clearly\nshow  that  the  Project  is  robust  under  future  uncertainties  and  that  the  risks  associated  with  it  are\nacceptable.\n\n                                                       \n4    A  common  statistical  indicator  of  the  risk  of  a  project  is  the  standard  deviation,  which  measures  the  dispersion\naround the expected value. The greater this variability, the less confident one can be of the outcomes associated\nwith the project. The standard deviation of 2.9 indicates that in general, this Project is a low-risk one.\n\n5 Loan 1582-PRC: Northeast China Power Transmission, for $150 million, approved on 25 November 1997. The 500\n\nkilovolts (kV) transmission line is now operational.\n\n6 The Government and ADB will jointly organize a workshop this year with the participation of the Ministry of Finance,\nState Development and Planning Commission, line ministries, executing agencies to discuss government and ADB\napproval  process.  Based  on  the  agreed  upon  views  in  this  workshop,  Ministry  of  Finance  and  ADB  will  submit  a\njoint report recommending necessary steps for better coordination in the approval processes.\n\n\fTable 1  Results of Risk Analysis\nI.
