The Project will consist of consulting services for (i) \nthe preparation of feasibility and other studies required to prepare \nnew water source projects, and (ii) capacity building for MWSS in \nthe field of financial management.  \n\nSix  years  after  two  private  concessionaires,  Manila  Water \nCompany Inc. (MWCI) and Maynilad Water Services Inc. (MWSI) \ntook over operations from MWSS, water supply continues to be a \nmajor  concern  in  the  Metro  Manila  area.  Nonrevenue  water \nremains  high,  and  some  areas  experience  water  shortages,  low \nwater pressure, and interrupted supply. By the end of 2002, MWCI \nand  MWSI  provided  about  82%  of  the  population  in  the  MWSS \nservice  area  with  water.  However,  existing  water  sources  can \nlet  alone  connect  additional \nbarely  meet  current  demand, \ncustomers,  requiring  the  development  of  new  water  sources. \nWater  provided  from  the  additional  sources  will  not  only  ensure \nimproved and sustainable service delivery for existing customers, \nbut also enable extension of service coverage, particularly for the \nurban  poor.  MWSS  has  identified  three  potential  water  source \nprojects  requiring  comprehensive  consulting  services  including \npreparation of feasibility studies and provision of high-level advice \non legal and financial issues. The TA loan will provide MWSS with \na  facility  to  complete  project  preparation  in  time,  ensuring \nappropriate  quality.  The  envisaged  projects  will  also  generate \npotential  business  opportunities  for  the  private  sector  in  water \nsource development. \n\nThe objective of the Project is to provide consulting services to (i) \nprepare  and  design  projects  for  the  development  of  new  water \nsources  for  Metro  Manila  suitable  for  financing  from  ADB,  the \nprivate sector, or other sources, and (ii) improve MWSS\u2019 capacity \nfor  financial  management,  accounting,  and  fiscal  control.  The \nresulting  water  source  projects  will  improve  the  living  conditions \nand  health  of  the  population  in  Metro  Manila  through  providing \nsafe  water,  and  will  facilitate  the  expansion  of  the  service  area, \nparticularly to the urban poor. Projects will also generate business \nopportunities for the private sector in water source development. \nThe  Project  consists  of  consulting  services \nfor  Part  A\u2014\nDevelopment  of  New  Water  Source  Projects,  and  for  Part  B\u2014\n\n\f \n\niii \n\nDevelopment  of  New  Water  Source  Projects,  and  for  Part  B\u2014\nCapacity  Building.  Part  A  will  include  (i)  feasibility  study  for  the \nWawa  River  Project;  (ii)  feasibility  study,  detailed  design,  and \ntender  documents  for  the  Angat  Water  Utilization  and  Aqueduct \nImprovement  Project;  and  (iii)  studies,  including  a  resettlement \nplan,  a  review  of  existing  design  and  tender  documents,  and \nfinancing  arrangements,  for  the  Laiban  Dam  Project.  All  three \nprojects  will  address  environmental,  poverty,  social  analysis,  and \nsocial safeguards concerns as required by ADB guidelines. Part B \nwill  include  capacity  building  to  strengthen  financial  management \nof  MWSS,  and  will  comprise  training  and  preparation  of  manuals \nand  guidelines  for  (i)  management  accounting;  (ii)  corporate \nfinancial \nplanning,  budgeting,  and  budgetary  control; \naccounting;  (iv)  internal  control  and  audit  systems;  and  (v)  data \nprocessing. \n\n(iii) \n\nTotal  Project  cost  is  estimated  at  $4.97  million  equivalent,  of \nwhich $1.30 million is the foreign exchange cost (26%), and $3.67 \nmillion equivalent (74%) is the local currency cost. \n\nIt is proposed that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide a \nloan of  $3.26 million or 66% of the project cost, to cover the entire \nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $1.96  million  equivalent  of  the  local \ncurrency  costs.  MWSS  will  finance  the  remaining  local  cost  of \n$1.71  million  equivalent.  The  Republic  of  the  Philippines  will \nguarantee the performance of MWSS' obligations under the Loan \nAgreement. \n\nCost Estimates \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $3.26 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will \nInterbank  Offered  Rate \nbe  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have  a 10-year term \nincluding a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  front-end \nfee  of  0.5%,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in \nthe Loan Agreement. \n\nPeriod of Utilization  \n\nUntil 30 June 2007 \n\n31 December 2006 \n\nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nExecuting Agency \n\nMWSS \n\nAn  inter-agency steering committee (IASC) composed  of MWSS \nand  the  concessionaires  was  formed  in  March  2001  to  prioritize \nand  supervise  development  of  new  water  source  projects.  The \nIASC will be responsible for guidance, monitoring, and supervising \nimplementation  of  the  Project.  MWSS  will  be  the  Executing \nAgency  and  will  implement  the  Project  over  3  years  through  the \nexisting project management office.  \n\n\fConsulting Services \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\niv \n\n \n\nConsultants  financed  under  the  Project  will  be  engaged  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants, \nincluding the use of the quality- and cost-based selection method \nfor consulting firms and arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  Approximately  438.5 \nperson-months of consulting services will be required, comprising \napproximately  36.5  person-months  of  international  and  402 \nperson-months of domestic consultants. \n\nThe TA loan will enable preparation of new water source projects \nfor Metro Manila resulting in improved living conditions and health \nof the population through provision of safe water and expansion of \nthe  service  area,  particularly  benefiting  the  urban  poor.  The \nProject will also generate business opportunities for private sector \nparticipation  in  water  source  development  through a transparent \nand  competitive  process,  thus  producing  greater  efficiencies  and \nbetter services to the consumer.  \n\n\f120 Eo\n\n128 Eo\n\no\n121 40'E\n\nUMIRAY\n\n16 No\n\nL U Z O N\n\n16 No\n\nProject Area\n\nMANILA\n\nP H I L I P P I N E S\nMWSS NEW WATER SOURCE\nDEVELOPMENT PROJECT\n\nv\n\nPolillo\nStrait\n\nr\n\ne\n\nv\ni\n\nR\ny\na\nr\n\nmi\nU\n\nIdlang\n\nC\n\nr\n\ne\n\nek\n\nM\n\na\n\nra\n\nn\n\na\n\ng\n\nu\nl\n\nC\n\nr\n\ne\n\ne\n\nk\n\nr\n\ne\n\nv\n\nR i\n\nI\n\nn\na\nmi\n\nn\n\na\n\nC\n\nr\n\ne\n\ne\n\nk\n\nn\n\na\n\no\n\nn\n\ng\n\nO y\n\nliway River\n\ni\nu\nB\n\nV I S A Y A S\n\n8 No\n\nM I N D A N A O\n\n8 No\n\no\n120 E\n\no\n\n128 E\n\nBaliwag\n\nBustos\n\no\n121 00'E\n\nSan Rafael\n\nAngat\n\no\n15 50'N\n\nB U L A C A N\n\nMt.

Following the request, the Loan Processing Mission \nwas fielded from 15 October to 16 November 2001. The Mission met with officials of MWSS and \nits two concessionaires, Manila Water Company, Inc. (MWCI) and Maynilad Water Services, Inc. \n(MWSI),  and  the  representatives  of  the  National  Economic  and  Development  Authority, \nDepartment  of  Finance,  and  Commission  on  Audit.  After  extended  discussions,  an  agreement \nwith MWSS and the Government was reached in December 2002 on the scope, costs, financing, \nand implementation arrangements for the Project. The project framework is attached in Appendix \n1. \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nWater Supply Coverage and Service Levels \n\n \n3. \nAs  of  the  end  of  2000,  as  reported  in  the  Medium-Term  Philippine  Development  Plan \n(MTPDP) 2001\u20132004,1 access to public water supply systems had increased from about 60% in \n1985  to  about  80%  of  the  total  population  in  the  Philippines.  According  to  MWSS,  its \nconcessionaires  MWCI  and  MWSI  served  about  76%  of  the  population  living  within  the  MWSS \nservice area at that time. This contrasted with urban areas outside of Metro Manila, where 88% \nof the population had access to safe drinking water through systems provided by the Local Water \nUtilities  Administration  (LWUA),  local  government  units  (LGUs),  and  the  private  sector.  By  the \nend  of  2002,  the  share  of  population  served  in  Metro  Manila  by  the  concessionaires  had \nincreased to 82%.  \n\n4. \nSignificant  improvement  in  terms  of  coverage  cannot  be  expected  in  the  coming  years, \nand it is unlikely that the MTPDP 2004 target of providing 90.5% of the population with access to \nsafe  drinking  water  will  be  met.  In  the  MWSS  service  area  the  concessionaires  lack  sufficient \nwater  supply  to  expand  their  systems.  For  urban  areas  outside  MWSS'  reach  the  situation  is \neven  more  difficult.  Only  150  of  560  water  districts  have  been  able  to  avail  of  financing  from \nLWUA,  and  there  is  little  likelihood  of  this  increasing  unless  the  performance  of  LWUA  is \nimproved.  \n\n5. \nEven  though  levels  of  service  generally  have  been  improved  in  terms  of  expanded \ncoverage,  system  reliability  and  capacity  are  frequently  inadequate,  and  illegal  tapping  is \ncommon.  Inadequate  supply  is  usually  manifested  by  low  pressure  in  the  distribution  system \nduring peak hours of use. Consequently, suppressed demand for water that makes it difficult to \nassess the real demand and to prepare adequate forecasts of demand and of willingness to pay. \n\n                                                 \n1 \n\nNational Economic Development Authority. 2001 Draft Medium Term Philippine Development Plan. \n\n\f 2\n\n \n\nIn  2002,  nonrevenue  water2  (NRW)  in  Metro  Manila  was  about  60%  on  average,  with \n6. \n69%  within  the  service  area  of  MWSI  and  53%  in  the  service  area  of  MWCI. 3    While  water \nsupplied in Metro Manila and in most water districts is generally disinfected with chlorine, water is \noften supplied without treatment and is of dubious quality in a number of areas. An analysis of \nthe sector is presented in Appendix 2. \n\n2. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n7. \nThe  key  lessons  learned  based  on  experience  with  project  implementation  relate  to \nsystemic  weaknesses  in  the  sector  in  three  areas.  The  first  is  the  inability  of  institutions  to \ndevelop  new  projects  and  to  maintain  existing  water  supply  networks  and  thus  to  respond  to \nrapidly  increasing  demand.  Related  issues  are  the  lack  of  readiness  for  project  implementation \nand  the  lack  of  transparency  and  accountability  of  the  agencies  involved.  There  is  a  need  to \nsupport the development of new projects and to address the issue of NRW, as provided under \nthe  Project.  New  high  priority  projects  must  be  prepared  based  on  concerted,  well-resourced \nefforts, linked to adequate funding of the resulting investment. \n\n3. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n8. \nMultilateral  and  bilateral  agencies  have  given  considerable  support  for  the  urban  sector \nand for the WSS sector in the Philippines. Since 1974, ADB has played a major role by providing \n19  loans  to  the  WSS  sector  amounting  to  approximately  $728  million,  and  27  technical \nassistance grants totaling $12.41 million. Projects for MWSS financed by ADB include 8 loans for \nwater  supply  and  1  for  sewerage.  In  addition  to  ADB,  the  major  providers  of  official  external \nassistance are the Japan Bank for International Cooperation and the World Bank. Others include \nthe  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development,  Canadian  International  Development \nAgency,  European  Union,  France,  Germany \nf\u00fcr  Technische \nZusammenarbeit and Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau), Japan International Cooperation Agency, \nNew  Zealand,  United  Kingdom  Department  for  International  Development,  United  Nations,  and \nthe  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development.  A  summary  of  external  assistance  to \nthe sector is presented in Appendix 3.  \n\n(Deutsche  Gesellschaft \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nThe  development  of  water  supply  systems  is  financed  by  a  combination  of  government \n9. \nsubsidies,  internal  cash  generation  of  supply  systems,  foreign  grant  and  loan  assistance,  and \nlocal government contributions. In the past, the main source of funding for water supply was the \ncentral  Government  assisted  by  bilateral  and  multilateral  agencies.  With  the  Government\u2019s \nprivatization  thrust,  private  capital  is  also  seen  to  help  finance  projects in the sector, as in the \ncase of the MWSS service area. \n\n10. \nOutside the MWSS service area, in systems managed by the water districts, internal cash \ngeneration has not been a reliable source for financing water system improvements. Tariffs are \noften  set  below  levels  required  for  full  cost  recovery.  Funds  for  capital  investment  are  usually \nprovided through the following sources: (i) LWUA; (ii) LGUs; and (iii) loans from the Development \nBank of the Philippines, and Land Bank of the Philippines. There are also cases where funds are \nprovided directly through congressional allocations. Tariffs of water supply systems operated by \nLGUs often do not cover operation and maintenance costs, and LGUs have to provide subsidies \nto  keep  systems  operating.  LGUs  fully  subsidize  loan  repayment  in  many  cases,  and  water \ndistricts often face political resistance when they try to raise water tariffs. \n                                                 \n2 \n\nNRW  is  composed  of  (i)  physical  losses  caused  by  leakages;  and  (ii)  commercial  losses  resulting  from  illegal \n \nconnections, meter under registration, and billing inefficiencies.\n \nSource: MWSS.\n\n3 \n\n\f  3\n\nSix  years  after  the  concessionaires  took  over  operations  from  MWSS,  water  supply \n11. \ncontinues  to  be  a  major  concern  in  the  Metro  Manila  area.  By  the  end  of  2002,  the \nconcessionaires provided about 82% of the total population within the MWSS service area with \nwater.  NRW  remained  very  high  at  about  60%  on  average,  and  some  areas  still  experience \nwater shortages, low water pressure, and interrupted supply. At present, MWSS provides about \n4,000 million liters per day (MLD) of water from the Angat Reservoir to the concessionaires for \ndistribution  to  the  population  and  to  industry.4  However,  these  water  sources  can  barely  meet \ncurrent demand, let alone connect to additional customers.5 Therefore, the development of new \nwater  sources  is  urgently  required.  Water  provided  from  these  additional  sources  will  ensure \nimproved and sustainable service delivery for existing customers and enable extension of service \ncoverage, particularly to the urban poor.  \n\n12. \nAccess to clean drinking water is essential for reducing urban poverty and to improve the \neconomic status of the urban poor, who often have to rely on water supplied by vendors at high \ncost,  and  suffer  from  ill  health  resulting  from  inadequate  access  to  clean  water.  Clean  drinking \nwater provides important social development and economic returns through reducing the burden \nof poverty, particularly on women, and through reducing water-borne diseases. The Project aims \nat  increasing  access  to  adequate  water  supply  for  the  poor,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \noperational  strategy  in  the  Philippines,  which  emphasizes  poverty  reduction  and  social \ndevelopment through promoting equitable growth, improving basic social services, and improving \nmanagement and protection of the environment.  \n\nTo meet future demand the Project will finance preparation of new water source projects.6 \n13. \nThe assistance will incorporate key lessons learned from previous projects and will provide well-\nresourced, focused assistance for the preparation of high priority projects based on a least-cost \napproach.  The  Project  will  help  to  facilitate  potential  financing  of  subsequent  investments  by \nADB,  the  private  sector,  and  other  sources,  and  will  contribute  to  improving  financial  and \nadministrative systems of MWSS. \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\n14. \nThe  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  provide  consulting  services  to  (i)  prepare  and  design \nprojects  for  the  development  of  new  water  sources  for  Metro  Manila  suitable  for  financing  from \nADB,  the  private  sector,  or  other  sources,  and  (ii)  improve  MWSS\u2019  capacity  for  financial \nmanagement, accounting, and fiscal control. The resulting water source projects will improve the \nliving conditions and health of the population in Metro Manila through providing safe water and \nwill facilitate the expansion of the service area, particularly to the urban poor. Projects will also \ngenerate business opportunities for the private sector in water source development.  \n\nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nThe  Project  consists  of  consulting  services  for  Part  A\u2014Development  of  New  Water \n\n15. \nSource Projects, and for Part B\u2014Capacity Building.  \n\n                                                 \n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\nMWSS' responsibilities include facilitating the provision of bulk water to the concessionaires; a detailed description \nof MWSS is included in Appendix 4. \nAccording to MWSS, without the development of new water sources the projected supply of water would fall short of \n \ndemand by about 200 MLD in 2006.\nAdditional assistance to investigate long-term water supply is being provided by the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency  to  the  National  Water  Resources  Board  through  The  Study  on  Water  Resources  Development  for  Metro \n \nManila.\n\n\f 4\n\n \n\n1. \n\nPart A\u2014Development of New Water Source Projects  \n\n16. \nPart A will include three components: (i) a feasibility study for the Wawa River Project; (ii) \na  feasibility  study,  detailed  design,  and  tender  documents  for  the  Angat  Water  Utilization  and \nAqueduct Improvement Project (AWUAIP); and (iii) studies, including a resettlement plan, review \nof  existing  design  and  tender  documents,  preliminary  design  for  a  transmission  pipeline,  and \nfinancing  arrangements,  for  the  Laiban  Dam  Project.  Detailed  terms  of  reference  (TOR)  for  a \nfeasibility  study  for  the  Wawa  River  component  are  attached  in  Appendix  5.  Descriptions  of \ncomponents  (ii)  and  (iii)  are  included  in  Appendix  6.  Detailed  TOR  for  the  water  source \ndevelopment  components  (ii)  and  (iii)  will  be  prepared  by  the  Executing  Agency  during  project \nimplementation, to be approved by the ADB.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nPart A.1\u2014Wawa River Project: The Wawa Dam, located on the river of the same \nname, which forms part of the Marikina River, was constructed in 1906 and was in \nuse  as  a  water  source  for  some  decades.  But  water  source  facilities  at  the dam \nwere abandoned a long time ago. To restart operations, the dam and associated \ninfrastructure need major refurbishing. The envisaged investment project resulting \nfrom  the  TA  Loan  will  comprise  the  renovation  of  the  dam  including  the  water \nintake, removal of silt from the reservoir, and construction of a new transmission \npipeline  and  of  a  water  treatment  plant  to  deliver  50  MLD  of  water.  The  water \ntreatment  plant  will  be  located  close  to  the  dam  on  a  site  already  owned  by \nMWSS,  which  also  has  the  right  of  way  for  the  new  pipeline.  The  plant\u2019s \nmechanical  and  electrical  equipment  has  already  been  provided  under  a  French \nsoft  loan  (French  Protocol)  about  6  years  ago  and  was  intended  to  treat  water \nfrom  Laguna  Lake.  However,  because  of  technical  and  environmental concerns \nthe project at Laguna Lake has been deferred, and the equipment has been kept \nstored  in  a  warehouse  since  then.  Water  supplied  from  the  Wawa  Dam  will  be \nprovided to settlements in Rodriguez and San Mateo, which are currently serviced \nby MWCI through deep wells and surface water from Balara. The growing demand \nin  these  areas,  particularly  for  the  urban  poor,  cannot  be  met  through  these \nsources  alone,  and  the  deep  wells  are  costly  to  operate.  Investment  costs  are \nestimated at about $13.5 million. In order to develop the project, a feasibility study \nfinanced under the TA Loan will be prepared. Project development will include the \npreparation of preliminary land acquisition and resettlement plans (PLARPs) and \nplans for the relocation of a small community of informal settlers along the route of \nthe  pipeline  and  near  the  proposed  site  for  the  water  treatment  plant,  as  well  as \nthe  preparation  of  the  necessary  environmental  impact  assessments  and \ncompliance reports. Total costs for the study are estimated at $309,000, of which \nADB will finance $213,000.  \n\nPart  A.2\u2014Angat  Water  Utilization  and  Aqueduct  Improvement  Project:   The \nAngat Reservoir, complemented by water diverted from the Umiray river basin, is \nthe main water source for Metro Manila and provides about 4,000 MLD water or \n97%  of  total  water  production.  The  reservoir  is  used  for  water  supply,  irrigation, \nand  hydropower  generation.  Current  water  right  allocation  from  the  Angat \nreservoir  provides  for  water  supply  of  1,900  MLD,  complemented  by  1,300  MLD \nset aside for irrigation. In addition, another 780 MLD is diverted from the Umiray \nRiver  into  the  Angat  Reservoir  for  water  supply  purposes.  MWSS  plans  to \nincrease  its  share  of  water  from  the  Angat  Reservoir  through  a  reallocation  of \nwater  rights  by  converting  an  existing  temporary  allocation  from  the  irrigation \nwater to a permanent allocation, and by obtaining additional water from irrigation \nfor water supply. A definitive ruling from the National Water Resources Board on \n\n\f  5\n\nthis issue will be sought by MWSS. Water from the Angat Reservoir is transported \nthrough  a  system  of  tunnels  and  aqueducts  to  the  water  treatment  plants. \nHowever, recent surveys have revealed that aqueduct no. 5 (AQ5), which carries \nabout  2,000  MLD,  is  in  urgent  need  of  repair.  Leakage  of  this  aqueduct  is \nestimated at about 100  \u2013 150 MLD. In case it would break, about half of the total \nwater  supply  for  Metro  Manila  would  be  at  risk.  MWSS  and  the  concessionaires \nhave taken action to carry out emergency repairs, but there is an urgent need  to \nbuild  a  new  aqueduct  (AQ6),  to  be  constructed  in  two  phases.  Phase  1  (5.5  km \nlength)  will  serve  as  a  by-pass  while  repairing  the  corresponding  section  of  the \nexisting AQ5, and will be financed by the Government of the Philippines. Phase 2 \nentails  the  construction  of  the  remaining  section  (11.5  km  length)  of  AQ6. \nPreparation  of  a  feasibility  study,  detailed  design,  and  tender  documents  for \nPhase  2  will  be  financed  under  the  Project.  Costs  of  the  resulting  investment \nproject  are  currently  estimated  at  about  $90  million.  This  would  include \nconstruction  of  AQ6  and  pumping  stations;  repair  of  the  existing  AQ5;  and,  if \nadditional water can be allocated, construction of additional transmission pipelines \nand an extension of water treatment plants. Project development for AWUAIP will \ninclude  preparation  of  (i)  a  feasibility  study,  inclusive  of  PLARP,  preliminary \ndesign,  and,  if  required,  a  resettlement  plan;  and  (ii)  detailed  design  and  tender \ndocuments. The cost of these activities is estimated at $2,100,000, of which ADB \nwill  finance  $1,428,000  under  the  Project.  An  indicative  list  of  tasks  and  budget \nitems  is  set  out  in  Appendix  6.  The  Executing  Agency  will  prepare  detailed  TOR \nand budgets during project implementation for approval by ADB.  \n\nPart A.3\u2013Laiban Dam Project: Preparation of the Laiban Dam Project started in \n1979.  It  is  a  project  to  deliver  1,900  MLD  of  high  quality  water  to  Metro  Manila. \nEven  though  the  construction  of  diversion  tunnels  had  already  been  completed, \nfurther  construction  was  suspended  in  1989  for  a  number  of  reasons,  including \nchanged priorities and emerging resettlement issues. Today, about 3,000 families \nhave settled on the dam site. Due to the growing need to secure long-term water \nsupply for Metro Manila, MWSS is considering reviving the project at an estimated \ncost  of  about  $1.0  billion.  Project  preparation  financed  from  the  TA  loan  will \ninclude  the  preparation  of  a  PLARP  for  the  relocation  and  rehabilitation  of  about \n3,000  families,  financing  arrangements,  review  of  existing  design  and  tender \ndocuments,  preliminary  design  of  a  transmission  pipeline,  and  environmental \nimpact assessment. Total costs for the TA are estimated at $2,049,000, of which \nADB  will  finance  $1,326,000.  Detailed  TOR  and  budgets  will  be  prepared  by  the \nExecuting Agency during project implementation for approval by ADB. \n\n(iii) \n\n2. \n\nPart B\u2014Capacity Building  \n\nFor  the  FY1999  and  FY2000,  COA  rendered  an  adverse  opinion  on  the  fairness  and \n17. \npresentation  of  the  financial  statements  of  MWSS.  While  MWSS,  in  discussion  with  ADB,  has \nalready prepared and implemented an action plan to address COA\u2019s recommendations, Project \ncomponent  Part  B\u2014Capacity  Building  will  contribute  to  strengthening  MWSS\u2019  financial \nmanagement  and  internal  control  mechanisms.  Part  B  comprises  training  and  preparation  of \nmanuals as well as guidelines for (i) management accounting; (ii) corporate planning, budgeting, \nand  budgetary  control;  (iii)  financial  accounting;  (iv)  internal  control  and  audit  systems;  and  (v) \ndata  processing.  Total  costs  for  this  aspect  of  the TA are estimated at $215,000, which will be \nfinanced by MWSS if grant financing from a bilateral agency cannot be secured. Detailed TOR \nand budget are enclosed in Appendix 7. \n\n\f 6\n\nC. \n\nCost Estimates  \n\n \n\n18. \nThe total project cost is estimated at $4.97 million equivalent, of which $1.30 million is the \nforeign  exchange  cost  (26%)  and  $3.67  million  equivalent  (74%)  is  local  currency  cost.  Cost \nestimates are presented in Appendix 8 and summarized in Table 1. \n\nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates \n($\u2019000) \n\nNew Water Source Projects \n\n \nComponent \nPart A:  Development of  \n \nA.1: Wawa River Project \nA.2: Angat Water Utilization and Aqueduct  \nImprovement Project \n \nA.3: Laiban Dam Project \nPart B: Capacity Building \nPart C: Interest and Fees \n \n \n\nTotal  \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\n \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n \n\nPercent \n \n\n \n\n97 \n308 \n\n600 \n0 \n293 \n1,298 \n26% \n\n212 \n1,792 \n\n1,449 \n215 \n0 \n3,668 \n74% \n\n \n\n309 \n2,100 \n\n2,049 \n215 \n293 \n4,966 \n\n100% \n\n \n\n6 \n42 \n\n42 \n4 \n6 \n100 \n \n\n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\nD. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n19.  MWSS has requested a loan  of  $3.26  million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to \nhelp finance the Project. The loan will have a 10-year term including a grace period of 3 years, \nan interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility, a front-end fee of 0.5% (the fee will be capitalized in the loan), and such \nother  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement.  The  Republic  of  the \nPhilippines will provide a guarantee for the loan. No commitment fee will be charged for  the TA \nloan. \n\n20. \nOf the total project cost of $4.97 million, ADB will finance $3.26 million or 66%, including \nthe  complete  foreign  exchange  costs  of  $1.30  million  and  $1.96  million  equivalent  of  the  local \ncurrency cost.7 The remaining 34% of total project cost will be financed by MWSS in cash and \nkind  including  the  cost  of  office  accommodation,  counterpart  staff,  incremental  administration, \ntaxes, and duties. The Financing Plan is presented in Appendix 8 and summarized in Table 2. \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($\u2019000) \n\n \nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \nMWSS  \n \n \n \n\nTotal  \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\n1,300 \n- \n1,300 \n26% \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n1,960 \n1,710 \n3,670 \n74% \n\nTotal \nCost \n3,260 \n1,710 \n4,970 \n100% \n\nPercent \n \n66% \n34% \n100% \n \n\n                                                 \n7 \n\nThe share of 66% ADB financing is within the limit of 70% ADB financing for TA projects in the Philippines. \n\n\f  7\n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n21.  The  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project  will  be  MWSS  through  its  existing  project \nmanagement  office  (PMO),  which  was  established  to  implement  projects  financed  by  ADB  and \nother  donors.8  MWSS  is  a  Government-  owned  and  -controlled  corporation,  created  under \nRepublic Act No. 6234 on 19 June 1971. The enactment of Republic Act No. 8041, the National \nWater Crisis Act of 1995, resulted in a reorganization of MWSS. After Executive Order No. 311 \nwas issued on 20 March 1996,  encouraging private sector participation (PSP) in the operations \nof  MWSS,  it  entered  into  concession  agreements  with  MWCI  and  MWSI  on  21  February  1997. \nThe  former  manages  the  East  Zone  and  the  latter  the  West  Zone  of  Metro  Manila.  The \nconcession  contracts  commenced  on  1  August  1997.  A  financial  and  institutional  analysis  of \nMWSS including financial projections is presented in Appendix 4. \n\n22. \nAn inter-agency steering committee (IASC) composed of MWSS and the concessionaires \nwas formed in March 2001 to prioritize and supervise development of new water source projects. \nThe  IASC  will  be  responsible  for  guiding,  monitoring,  and  supervising  implementation  of  the \nProject. The Project will be implemented by MWSS through the existing PMO, which is headed \nby  a  PMO  manager  and  comprises  staff \nfor  engineering,  project  management,  and \nadministration.  Staff  seconded  from  the  concessionaires  will  complement  the  PMO  based  on \nexisting  working  arrangements  for  the  implementation  of  ongoing  MWSS-financed  projects. \nHowever, involvement of concessionaire staff in the implementation of any part of the Project will \nbe  subject  to  the  condition  that  the  seconding  concessionaire  and  its  affiliates  and  subsidiaries \nagree to refrain from bidding for the resulting water source project. \n\n23. \nThe  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  overall  implementation  of  the  Project  based  on  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and in accordance with other relevant ADB requirements, \npolicies,  and  guidelines.  Consultant  selection  will  follow  quality-  and-cost-based  selection \n(QCBS) procedures. Activities of the PMO will include (i) preparation of TOR and budget for each \nassignment, (ii) shortlisting of consultants, (iii) preparation of tender documentation, (iv) invitation \nto submit proposals, (v) evaluation of proposals, (vi) contracting of consultants, (vii) monitoring of \nconsultants\u2019 performance and output, (viii) preparation of withdrawal applications, (ix) payment of \nconsultants, and (x) reporting. MWSS will provide logistical support for the consultants, including \nadequately \nto \ncommunication facilities. \n\nfurnished  office  space,  data  and  project  documentation,  and  access \n\n2. \n\nSubproject Formulation and Approval \n\n24. \nThe detailed TOR for the feasibility study for Part A.1\u2014Wawa River Project and for Part \nB\u2014Capacity  Building  are  attached  in  Appendix  5  and  7,  respectively.  The  PMO  will  prepare \ndetailed  TOR  and  budget  for  each  of  the  other  components  in  accordance  with  ADB \nrequirements,  guidelines,  and  policies  and  will  submit  them  to  ADB  for  comment and approval \nprior  to  recruitment  of  consultants.  Individual  consultants  and  firms  of  consultants,  as  required, \nwill carry out studies and consulting services financed under the Project.  \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n25. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  3-year  period.  Implementation  is  planned  to \ncommence  in  2004  with  recruitment  of  consultants  for  preparing  the  feasibility  study  for  the \nWawa  River  Project,  and  for  the  Capacity  Building  component.  Further  activities  will  include \n\n                                                 \n8 \n\nSee Appendix 3. \n\n\f 8\n\n \n\nstudies for the development of the AWUAIP, and for the Laiban Dam Project. An implementation \nschedule is attached in Appendix 9. \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nConsultants  financed  under  the  Project  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n26. \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  including  the  use  of  the  QCBS  method  for  consulting \nfirms,  and,  for  domestic  consultants,  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB.  Approximately  438.5 \nperson-months  of  consulting  services  will  be  required,  comprising  approximately  36.5  person-\nmonths  of  international  and  402  person-months of domestic consultants. Consulting firms that \nare  affiliated  with,  or  a  subsidiary  of,  MWSS  or  the  concessionaires  will  not  be  eligible  to  be \nengaged under the Project.  \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Recruitment Action \n\n27. \nAt  the  request  of  MWSS,  ADB  has  approved  advance  action  for  recruitment  of \nconsultants  to  address  the  urgency  of  developing  the  new  water  source  projects.  Advance \naction, which may take place prior to loan effectiveness, includes recruitment of international and \ndomestic  consultants,  up  to  but  not  including  contract  signing.  All  advance  recruitment  of \nconsultants  will  be  carried  out  in  conformity  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants. \nMWSS  was  advised  that  approval  of  advance  action  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the \nProject. \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n28. \nThe  minimum  withdrawal  amount  will  be  $100,000  equivalent  in  accordance  with  ADB \nprocedures.  Any  disbursement  below  that  amount  will  be  made  through  the  imprest  account  or \nreimbursement procedures. An imprest account will be established at a bank to be agreed upon \nby  MWSS  and  ADB  to  facilitate  the  timely  release  of  loan  funds.  The  initial  amount  to  be \ndeposited  in  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  $320,000  equivalent.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of \nexpenditure  (SOE)  procedure  will  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  and  to  liquidate \nadvances provided to the imprest account. The individual payments that may be reimbursed or \nliquidated  under  the  SOE  procedure  will  not  exceed  $40,000  equivalent  per  payment.  The \nimprest  account  and  SOE  procedure  will  be  established  and  maintained  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, dated January 2001, and detailed arrangements between \nMWSS and ADB. \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n29.  MWSS  will  assign  a  project  manager  within  the  existing  PMO  to  be  responsible  for  the \nimplementation  of  the  Project,  including  project  supervision,  monitoring,  accounting,  and \nreporting.  MWSS  through  the  PMO  will  (i)  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  Project,  and  (ii) \nhave such accounts and related financial statements audited annually by auditors acceptable to \nADB  and  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Loan  Agreement  and  Guarantee  Agreement \nand as specified in the  Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment \nProjects Financed by the Asian Development Bank. The imprest account and SOE records will \nalso be audited as part of the annual audit. MWSS will submit to ADB certified copies (in English) \nof such audited accounts and financial statements, and the related reports of the auditors, within \n9  months  after  the  close  of  each  financial  year.  The  Project  will  be  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \nguidelines  on  the  prevention  of  fraud  and  corruption.  ADB\u2019s  audit  requirements  have  been \ndiscussed with MWSS and its auditor, and a full understanding of the loan covenant on audited \nstatements has been reached.  \n\n30. \nThe  PMO,  on  behalf  of  MWSS,  will  submit  to  the  ADB  a  quarterly  progress  report  on \ncommitments  and  disbursements,  local  and  foreign  costs,  implementation  status  of  approved \n\n\f  9\n\nsubprojects, problems encountered during the quarter under review, action taken or proposed to \nbe taken to remedy the problems, and the expected progress during the following quarter. \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\nProgress  under  the  Project  will  be  subject  to  a  formal  review  every  6  months  following \n31. \neffectivity to enable MWSS and the Government to make adjustments in the project design and \nthe  implementation  arrangements  if  needed.  The  review  will  cover  in  particular  the  status  of \nsubproject  preparation  and  implementation,  the  performance  of  consultants,  and  the  possible \nreallocation of loan proceeds. \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProject Benefits and Impacts \n\n1. \n\nPoverty and Social Analysis \n\n32.  Water  provided  from  the  additional  water  sources  developed  under  the  Project  will  not \nonly  ensure  improved  and  sustainable  service  delivery  for  existing  customers,  but  also  enable \nextension  of  service  coverage,  particularly  for  the  urban  poor.  Both  concessionaires  have \nsuccessfully taken action to provide urban poor with equitable access to safe and reliable water \nsupply. By the end of 2002, MWSI had installed 63,730 connections for households of the urban \npoor under its Bayan Tubig (\u201cwater for the people\u201d) program.9 MWCI, in a similar approach, has \ndeveloped the Tubig Para sa Barangay (\u201cwater for the community\u201d) program under which several \npoor  families  can  share  the  cost  and  use  of  a  single  water  meter.  By  the  end  of  2002,  about \n63,910  households  have  been  connected  under  this  program  (footnote  9).  The  new  water \nsources  will  not  only  improve  the  service  quality  of  existing  customers,  but  also  facilitate  the \nconnection  of  new  customers,  including  poor  households.  Poverty  and  social  analysis  will  be \nconducted as part of the feasibility studies financed under the Project in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nHandbook on Poverty and Social Analysis. The results of the analysis will be documented in the \nappropriate sections of the initial poverty and social analysis (IPSA) and, in greater detail, in the \npoverty and social analysis report (PSAR) for each of the water source projects developed under \nthe  Project.  The  poverty  impact  ratio  will  be  computed  in  the  economic  analysis  carried  out  for \neach of the water source projects.  \n\n33. \nPoverty  and  social  analysis  concerns  to  be  discussed  in  the  IPSA  and  the  PSARs  will \ninclude (i) an assessment of the poverty and social development impact of the Project on poor \nand  vulnerable  groups,  including  impacts  on  health,  livelihood,  and  wealth;  (ii)  identification  of \ngender concerns; (iii) preparation of design measures that will enhance the Project's contribution \nto poverty reduction and social development; and (iv) identification of participatory approaches to \nbe  applied  in  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  the  new  water  source  projects.  A  poverty \nand social analysis summary is attached in Appendix 10. \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n34. \nA  financial  analysis  was  carried  out  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial \nGovernance and Management of Investment Projects  Financed by the Asian Development Bank, \nincluding (i) evaluation of the financial performance of MWSS for the past 3 years (1999-2001) \nand  (ii)  preparation  of  financial  projections  for  the  duration  of  the  Project.  The  financial \nprojections  are  presented  in  Appendix  4  and  indicate  that  MWSS  will  operate  in  a  sustainable \nmanner and that the costs of the Project are affordable to the organization.  \n\n                                                 \n9 \n\n \nFigures provided by MWSS.\n\n\f 10\n\n \n\n35.  MWSS\u2019  single  major  source  of  revenue  comes  from  concession  fees  paid  by  the \nconcessionaires  consisting  of  (i)  MWSS  current  operating  budget,  (ii)  debt  service  of  existing \nloans, and (iii) counterpart funds for ongoing investment projects. Based on the projections, it is \nexpected that MWSS will have to pay P31.2 million for annual debt service for the TA  loan from \n2007 to 2013, which will be covered through the concession fees, subject to tariff adjustments. \nThe TA loan will therefore have limited impact on the financial performance of MWSS. Based on \nan  average  billed  water  volume  in  2002  of  about  1,500  MLD, the required tariff adjustment in \n2007  will  probably  be  in  the  range  of  about  P0.06  per  cubic  meter.10  However,  billed  water \ndemand  is  expected  to  increase  until  2007,  thus  reducing  the  required  tariff  adjustment.  A \ndetailed  financial  and  economic  analysis will be carried out as part of the feasibility studies for \nthe new water source projects resulting from the TA loan. \n\n3. \n\nNonrevenue Water \n\n36. \nADB  has  been  providing  loan  financing  for  water  supply  infrastructure  in  the  MWSS \nservice  area  for  about  30  years.  While  these  projects  supported  major  investment  for  NRW \nreduction  including  (i)  water  meter  installation,  (ii)  replacement  of  valves  and  pipes,  (iii)  leak \ndetection  and  repair,  (iv)  reducing  illegal  connections,  and  (v)  conducting  training  programs, \ntargets  for  NRW  reduction  have  generally  not  been  met.  Following  commencement  of  the \nconcessions  in  August  1997,  NRW  reduction  is  now  the  responsibility  of  the  concessionaires, \nwho  are  implementing  the  ongoing  MWSS  projects  as  well  as  their  own  NRW  reduction \nprograms.  \n\n37. \nDespite  considerable  efforts  and  the  involvement  of  experienced  operators  the  level  of \nNRW is still high at about 60% in 2002. It appears that targets set in previous projects for NRW \nreduction  have  been  too  ambitious  and  could  not  be  met  due  to  the  complexity  of  the  issues \ninvolved.  For  example,  improving  service  quality,  including  24-hour water supply in most of the \nservice area and higher network pressure, has to some extent contributed to the continued high \nlevel of NRW through increasing water losses from the deteriorating network. NRW reduction will \nbe a long-term effort requiring further massive investment in network rehabilitation, which can be \nfinanced only through appropriate water tariffs. In addition to reducing losses caused by leakage, \ncontinuous  efforts  will  be  required  to  reduce  commercial  losses  as  well,  including  illegal \nconnections  (footnote  2).  While  the  main  responsibility  for  NRW  reduction  rests  with  the \nconcessionaires,  feasibility  studies  financed  under  the  Project  will  address  NRW  by  reviewing \nprograms  for  its  reduction  and  assessing  impacts  on  the  forecast  of  water  demand  and \nproduction.  \n\n4. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation \n\n38. \nAll three water source projects will have the potential for PSP, which will be  investigated \nduring project preparation. TOR for the studies financed under the TA loan will explicitly require \nthe  consultants  to  assess  the  viability  of  PSP  in  all  three  projects.  MWSS  intend  to  involve  the \nconcessionaires  in  project  management  and  implementation  based  on  existing  arrangements. \nHowever,  detailed  implementation  and  procurement  arrangements,  based  on  transparent  and \ncompetitive  procedures  as  required  for  projects  supported  by  ADB,  will  be  developed  during \npreparation of the feasibility studies.  \n\n                                                 \n10 \n\nThis compares with current average water tariffs per cubic meter of P15.76 for the MWSI service area, and P10.06 \n \nfor the MWCI service area; source: MWSS.\n\n\f  11\n\n5. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures \n\nincluding \n\nissues  of \n\nEnvironmental  and  social \n\n39. \ninvoluntary \nimpact  assessments, \nresettlement  and  gender  development,  will  be  integral  components  for  the  preparation  of \nfeasibility  studies  and  other  consulting  services  financed  under  the  Project.  Environmental \nassessment  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  revised  Operations  Manual  Section  20: \nEnvironmental Considerations in ADB Operations. Social Safeguards (Involuntary Resettlement \nand Indigenous Peoples) concerns, as outlined in Appendix 11, will be addressed in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  on  Poverty  and  Social  Analysis  and  ADB  policies  on  Involuntary \nResettlement,  as  detailed  in  the  Handbook  on  Resettlement:  A  Guide  to  Good  Practice, and \nIndigenous Peoples. The impact of the proposed projects on indigenous people occupying land \nin the upper catchment areas of both the Angat and Laiban projects will be investigated in detail \nduring the project studies, and appropriate mitigation measures will be designed if required. \n\nB. \n\nProject Risks \n\n40. \nRisks Associated with Concession.  The efficient implementation of the Project will rely \non the continued commitment of MWSS and the concessionaires. The concessionaires will (i) be \ntreating  and  distributing  the  additional  bulk  water  provided  from  the  new  water  sources,  (ii) \nsupport the PMO through seconding of staff, and (iii) be responsible for loan repayment through \nadjusted  water  tariffs.  One  of  the  concessionaires,  MWSI,  which  is  responsible  for  providing \nwater supply and sanitation services in the West Zone, has given notice that it will terminate its \nconcession  agreement.  While  this  case  is  under  arbitration,  it  will  most  likely  result  in  reduced \nparticipation of MWSI in project implementation. The potential adverse impact on the Project will \nbe  limited,  since  (i)  both  MWSS  and  MWCI  are  sufficiently  experienced,  and  each  is  staffed  to \nsuccessfully  implement  the  Project  without  support  from  the  other  concessionaire;  and  (ii)  the \nadditional water sources resulting from the TA loan are urgently needed, thus providing a strong \nincentive  for  all  parties  involved  to  implement  the  Project  expeditiously.  In  case  MWSI  will \nactually  terminate  its  concession,  either  MWSS  or  a  newly  contracted  concessionaire  will  take \nover responsibility from MWSI, including loan repayment. \n\n41. \nRisks  Associated  with  Consultant  Selection.  Quality  and  timely  delivery  of  studies \nprepared  under  the  Project  will  particularly  depend  on  the  competence  and  commitment  of  the \nconsultants recruited by MWSS. This risk will be mitigated by (i) detailed TOR for the studies that \nfully address the issues set out in the Report and Recommendation of the President and that will \nbe  subject  to  approval  by  ADB,  (ii)  consultant  recruitment  following  ADB  procedures  and \nguidelines, and (iii) consultant selection following QCBS procedures.  \n\nRisks Associated with Timely Implementation. The Project will include preparation of \n42. \nthree  potential  water  source  projects.  While  the  Wawa  River  Project  and  capacity  building \nactivities  will  come  first,  implementation  of  the  other  two  projects  will  follow  shortly.  This  will \nimpose  a  heavy  workload  on  the  PMO,  particularly  at  the  beginning  of  project  implementation, \nwhen consultants need to be recruited and adjustments to project design may be needed during \nthe inception phases. This risk of implementation delays is manageable because the PMO (i) is \nexperienced in recruitment of consultants and in working according to ADB requirements, and (ii) \nwill be supported by staff seconded by the concessionaires as required. \n\n43. \nRisks  Associated  with  Availability  of  Bilateral  Support  for  Capacity  Building. \nCapacity  building  to  improve  financial  management  of  MWSS  is  an  important  component  for \nsuccessful implementation of the Project and the resulting water source projects. To address this \nissue,  capacity  building  has  been  included  in  the  project  design  under  Part  B.  While  several \npotential  bilateral  funding  agencies  have  been  approached,  grant  financing  for  this  component \nhas  not  been  secured  yet.  MWSS  has  agreed  that  the  capacity  building  component  will  be \n\n\f 12\n\n \n\nfinanced from its own funds in case a bilateral grant donor cannot be identified. Commencement \nof the capacity building component will be a condition for disbursement of funds for components \nunder Part A of the Project. \n\n44. \nRisks  Associated  with  Resettlement  Issues.  The  Laiban  Dam  component  is \nparticularly  affected  by  resettlement  issues.  International  nongovernment  organizations  have \nalready expressed their  concerns.  The  risk  for  the  Project  consists  of  delayed  implementation \nthrough protracted consultations on resettlement. This risk will be mitigated by (i) detailed TOR \nfor the studies that fully address the resettlement issues and that will be subject to approval by \nADB,  and  (ii)  active  consultations  by  the  MWSS  and  ADB  with  organizations  representing \nsettlers at the dam site.  \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, MWSS has given the following assurances, which \n\n45. \nare incorporated in the legal documents: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nAll  projects  will  be  designed  in  strict  conformity  with  the  applicable  national \nenvironmental  impact  standards  and  in  line  with  the  Environment  Policy  of  the \nAsian  Development  Bank.  Initial  environmental  examinations  will  be  undertaken \nfor  each  subproject,  and  an  assessment  will  be  made  as  to  whether  the \nsubproject  is  environmentally  sensitive.  Depending  on  the  outcome  of  the \nassessment, and the requirements of ADB\u2019s Environment Policy and of applicable \nnational  standards,  an  environmental  impact  assessment  will  be  prepared  for \neach of the resulting water source projects. \n\nThe  studies  and  engineering  designs  prepared  for  the  subprojects  and  other \nconsulting  services  provided  will  comply  with  all  relevant  ADB  requirements, \npolicies,  and  guidelines  including,  without  limitation,  ADB\u2019s  Policy on Involuntary \nfor \nResettlement,  Handbook  on  Resettlement,  Water  Policy,  Guidelines \nIncorporation  of  Social  Dimensions  in  Bank  Operations, and  Guidelines  for  the \nFinancial  Governance  and Management of Investment Projects Financed by the \nAsian Development Bank. \n\n(iii)  MWSS will ensure that all necessary counterpart funds for project implementation \n\nare provided fully and in a timely manner.  \n\nIn  the  event  MWSS  arranges  for  the  PMO  staff  to  be  complemented  by  staff \nseconded  by  the  concessionaires,  or  their  affiliates  or  subsidiaries,  the relevant \nconcessionaire,  together  with  its  affiliates  and  subsidiaries,  will  be  disqualified \nfrom  bidding  for  resulting  water  source  projects  for  which  they  have  seconded \nstaff.  \n\nConditions for Disbursement \n\nB. \n\n46. \n\nThe following conditions for disbursement have been agreed: \n\nThe  disbursement  of  TA  loan  proceeds  for  Part  A\u2014Development of New Water \nSource  Projects  will  be  subject  to  the  commencement  of  Part  B\u2014Capacity \nBuilding. \n\nNo  withdrawals  will  be  made  from  the  Loan  Account  for  Part  B\u2014Capacity \nBuilding. \n\n\fVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n47. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB \nand recommend that the Board approve the loan of $3,260,000 to the Metropolitan Waterworks \nand Sewerage System, to be guaranteed by the Republic of the Philippines, for the MWSS New \nWater  Source  Development  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  with  interest  to  be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a term of 10 years, including \na  grace  period  of  3  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Guarantee  Agreements  presented  to  the \nBoard.  \n\n  13\n\nTADAO CHINO \nPresident \n\n15 September 2003 \n\n\f14 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n\nDesign \nSummary \n1.

According  to  Metropolitan \nWaterworks  and  Sewerage  System,  its  concessionaires  Manila  Water  Company,  Inc.  and \nMaynilad  Water  Services,  Inc.,  served  about  76%  of  the  population  living  within  the  MWSS \nservice area at that time. This contrasted with urban areas outside of Metro Manila, where 88% \nof  the  population  had  access  to  safe  drinking  water  through  systems  provided  by  the  Local \nWater Utilities Administration, local government units (LGUs), and the private sector. By the end \nof  2002  the  concessionaires  provided  water  to  about  82%  of  the  total  population  within  their \nservice areas in Metro Manila. Since commencement of the concessions in 1997, service quality \nhas improved, and the number of households connected has increased significantly. \n\n2. \nEfforts at integrated planning and development of water supply programs to improve the \nsituation at the provincial level have, in many cases, not shown significant progress. Sector data \nthat  could  be  used  for  planning  and  monitoring  have  become  very  scarce.  The  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS)  sector  plan  study  conducted  in \n1999 and 20002 noted that more than 20 government agencies are involved in different aspects \nof  the  sector,  resulting  in  a  fragmented  approach  to  management,  an  ambiguous  definition  of \nresponsibilities,  functional  duplication,  absence  of  a  reliable  comprehensive  database,  and \nfractured water resources management planning. The two national institutions with a significant \nand  specific  policy  mandate  in  the  WSS  sector  are  the  Department  of  the  Interior  and  Local \nGovernment (DILG) and the National Economic and Development Authority. \n\n3. \nIn  the  past,  the  main  source  of  funding  for  water  supply  was  the  central  Government, \nwith  assistance  from  bilateral  and  multilateral  loans  and  grants.  With  the  Government\u2019s \nprivatization thrust, private capital is also seen to gradually help finance projects in the sector. \nKey  problems  in  financing  water  supply  include  (i)  inability  of  the  majority  of  water  supply \nagencies  to  generate  sufficient  funds  from  operations  to  finance  system  development  and \nimprovement,  (ii)  inadequate  provision  for  operation  and  maintenance  to  sustain  the  current \nlevels  and  quality  of  service,  and  (iii)  inadequate  assessment  of  ability  and  willingness  of \nconsumers to pay for WSS services. \n\nWhile  the  National  Water  Resources  Board  (NWRB)3  is  mandated  to  coordinate  and \n4. \nintegrate  the  plans  and  programs  of  all  water  resources  agencies,  such  plans  seldom  receive \nNWRB approval. Until recently, master and river basin plans have been nonexistent and NWRB \nlacks  the  resources  needed  to  assess  and  approve  investment  plans.  This  lack  of  effective \ncoordinated planning and implementation of a river basin or watershed approach does not allow \nadequate  priority  setting  and  makes  it  difficult  for  both  public  and  private  sectors  to  prepare, \noffer, and assess investment proposals.  \n\n5. \nThe  lack  of  effective  law  enforcement  is  also  a  concern,  as  watersheds  continue  to \nremain unprotected. This constitutes a major concern because (i) human settlements are fast \nencroaching  into  watershed  areas;  (ii)  the  common  practice  of  employing  kaingin  (slash-and-\n                                                 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n\n \nNational Economic Development Authority. 2001. Draft Medium Term Philippine Development Plan. Manila.\n \nADB. 1997. Technical Assistance to Philippines for Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Plan Study. Manila.\nNWRB  was  established  on  28  March  1974  by  Presidential  Decree  No.  424.  Executive  Order  123  issued  12 \nSeptem ber 2002 resulted in the reorganization of NWRB and its subordination to the Office of the President. It is \nplanned to transfer the NWRB to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources in the future. The main \nresponsibilities of NWRB include regulating the use of water sources through the issuance of water rights, drafting \nof framework plans and policies, and overall coordination and integration of the water resources plan. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n 17\n\nburn)  cultivation  sometimes  results  in  uncontrollable  forest  fires;  and  (iii)  logging  and \ndeforestation activities, despite legislative prohibitions, are degrading catchment areas. \n\nB. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans \n\nThe overriding principle pertinent to the provision of WSS services is the empowerment \n6. \nof local government units (LGUs). The enactment of the Local Government Code (LGC) of 1991 \nprovides them with a central role in the provision of WSS services. To implement this, national \nagencies have adopted the following policies and strategies: (i) provide a favorable environment \nfor LGU activity in the WSS sector and assistance from DILG, together with encouraging private \nsector participation in the provision of WSS services; (ii) privatize water supply facilities in urban \nareas whenever appropriate; (iii) develop and provide incentives for contiguous water districts to \namalgamate  into  single  business  entities  to  attract  private  sector  investments  in  water  supply \ndevelopment;  and  (iv)  adopt  a  holistic  approach  to  water  resources  development  through  the \ninclusion of supply, distribution, treatment, and sanitation.  \n\n7. \nIn  implementing  and  applying  these  strategies,  agencies  and  organizations  within  the \nsector  should  apply  the  following  crosscutting  principles:  (i)  water  sector  development is to be \nparticipatory and consultative at each level, leading to commitment by stakeholders and action \nthat  is  socially  acceptable;  (ii)  water  use  should  be  sustainable  with  appropriate  incentives, \nregulatory controls, and public education promoting economic efficiency, conservation of water \nresources,  and  protection  of  the  environment;  and  (iii)  successful  water  sector  development \nrequires  a  commitment  to  sustained  capacity-building,  monitoring,  education,  research,  and \nlearning at all levels, to respond effectively to the changing needs at the national, basin, project, \nservice entity, and community levels.  \n\nC. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector \n\n8. \nThere has been considerable support by multilateral and bilateral agencies for the urban \nsector and for the  WSS sector in the Philippines. Since 1974  ADB has played a major role by \nproviding 19 loans to the WSS sector amounting to approximately $728 million, and 27 technical \nassistance  grants  totaling  $12.41  million.  In  addition  to  ADB,  the  major  providers  of  official \nexternal  assistance  are  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  and  the  World  Bank. \nOthers  include  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development,  Canadian  International \nf\u00fcr \nDevelopment  Agency,  European  Union,  France,  Germany  (Deutsche  Gesellschaft \nTechnische  Zusammenarbeit  and  Kreditanstalt \nInternational \nCooperation Agency, New Zealand, United Kingdom Department for International Development, \nUnited Nations, and the United States Agency for International Development. \n\nf\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau),  Japan \n\nD. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n\n9. \nADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  in  the  Philippines  emphasizes  poverty  reduction  and  social \ndevelopment  through  promoting  equitable  growth,  improving  basic  social  services,  and \nimproving  management  and  protection  of  the  environment.  The  WSS  sector  is  in  a  state  of \ntransition because of sector reforms introduced as a result of devolution and decentralization of \nsector  responsibilities.  ADB  has  encouraged  a  shift  from  a  traditional  top-down  centralized \nplanning  approach  to  the  concept  of  bottom-up  planning  and  extensive  local  consultation, \nincluding  training  and  capacity  building  of  sector  agencies  in  project  management  and \ncommunity  development.  ADB  is  emphasizing  community  participation  and  decentralization  of \nthe implementation process. \n\n\f \n\n18 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nFunding \nAgency \n\nADB \n\nRecipient \nAgency \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE SECTOR (SELECTED PROJECTS) \n\nMWSS \n\nMWSS \n\nMWSS \n\nMWSS \n\nMWSS \n\nMWSS \n\nMWSS \n\nMWSS \n\nLWUA \n\nDPWH \n\nLWUA \n\nMWSS \n\nDBP \n\nDBP \n\nMWSS \n\nLWUA \nLWUA \n\nLWUA \n\nLWUA \n\nDILG \n\nMWSS \n\nProject Description \n\n\u2022  Manila Water Supply, for $51.3 million, approved on 28 August 1974 \n\u2022  Second Manila Water Supply, for $49.0 million, approved on 7 September 1978 \n\u2022  Manila Water Supply Rehabilitation, for $39.3 million, approved on 27 October \n\n\u2022  Second Manila Water Supply Rehabilitation, for $26.4 million, approved on 24 \n\n\u2022  Manila Sewerage, for $42.8 million, approved on 24 June 1980 \n\u2022  Angat Water Supply Optimization, for $130.0 million, approved on 14 November \n\n\u2022  Umiray-Angat Transbasin Project, for $92.0 million, approved on 21 September \n\n\u2022  Manila South Water Distribution Project, for $31.4 million, approved on 19 \n\n\u2022  Municipal Water Supply, for $43.2 million, approved on 25 November 1993 \n\n\u2022  Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project, for $37.0 million, approved \n\n\u2022  Small Towns Water Supply Sector Project, for $50.0 million, approved on 30 \n\n1983 \n\nJanuary 1989 \n\n1989 \n\n1995 \n\nDecember 1991 \n\non 4 June 1996 \n\nSeptember 1996 \n\nSeptember 1997 \n\n\u2022  Manila Second Sewerage Project, for $57.0 million, approved on 21 May 1996 \n\n\u2022  LGU Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project, for $23.3 million, \n\n\u2022  LGU Urban Water and Sanitation Project \u2014 A (02) \u2014 APL, for $30 million, \n\napproved on 15 December 1998 \n\napproved on 18 October 2001 \n\nWorld Bank \n\nLBP \n\n\u2022  Water Districts Development Project, for $56.8 million, approved on 9 \n\nJBIC \n\n\u2022  Angat Water Supply Optimization Project, 1990-2000 \n\n\u2022  Provincial Cities Water Supply Project II, 1992-1997 \n\u2022  Provincial Cities Water Supply Project III, 1995-2003 \n\n\u2022  Provincial Cities Water Supply Project IV, 1996-2003 \n\n\u2022  Provincial Cities Water Supply Project V, 1997-2004 \n\n\u2022  Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project, 2000-2004 \n\n\u2022  Rizal Water Supply Project, 1993-1998 \n\nFrench \nProtocol \nAusAID \n\nKfW \n\nDANIDA \n\nLWUA \n\n\u2022  Baguio Water Supply Upgrading and Rehabilitation Project, 1996-2004 \n\n\u2022  Northern Mindanao Water and Sanitation Project \n\nNorthern \nMindanao LGU \nLWUA \n\n\u2022  Provincial Towns Water Supply Program \n\nLWUA \n\n\u2022  Negros Urban Water Supply Project, 1997-2001 \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  AusAID  =  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development,  DANIDA  =  Danish \nInternational Development Assistance,  DBP  =  Development  Bank  of  the  Philippines,  DILG  =  Department  of  Interior \nand  Local  Government,  DPWH  =  Department  of  Public  Works  and  Highways,  JBIC  =  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation,  KfW  =  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (Germany),  LBP  =  Land  Bank  of  the  Philippines,  LGU  =  local \ngovernment  unit,  LWUA  =  Local  Water  Utilities  Administration,  MWSS  =  Metropolitan  Waterworks  and  Sewerage \nSystem. \nSource: World Bank Sector Assistance Strategy Note updated by NEDA September 1998; ADB; World Bank. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\n19\n\nFINANCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS OF MWSS \n\nA. \n\nBackground \n\n1. \nThe  Metropolitan  Waterworks  and  Sewerage  System  (MWSS)  is  a  Government-owned \nand -controlled corporation created under Republic Act No. 6234 on 19 June 1971. Republic Act \nNo. 8041, the National Water Crisis Act of 1995,1 reorganized MWSS. After Executive Order No. \n311  was  issued  on  20  March  1996,  encouraging  private  sector  participation  in  the  operations \nand  facilities  of  MWSS,  it  entered  into  concession  agreements  with  two  concessionaires,  the \nManila Water Company, Inc. (MWCI) and Maynilad Water Services, Inc. (MWSI) on 21 February \n1997.  The former manages the East Zone and the latter the West Zone of the MWSS service \narea.  The  concessions  commenced  on  1  August  1997,  and  MWSS  was  divided  into  two \nindependent entities, namely MWSS-Residual Services and the MWSS-Regulatory Office. \n\n2. \nBased  on  the  revised  organizational  structure  and  staffing  plan  approved  by  the \nDepartment of Budget and Management (DBM), MWSS Residual Services activities include (i) \nadministration  and  management  of  retained  assets,  (ii)  administration  of  existing  loans,  (iii) \nfacilitating  the  provision  of  bulk  water,  and  (iv)  facilitating  development  of  new  water  sources. \nThe  MWSS-Regulatory  Office,  on  the  other  hand,  is  the  regulatory  body  to  monitor  the \nprovisions and performance targets specified in the concession agreements and to ensure that \nappropriate measures are being taken in case of noncompliance. An Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)-financed  technical  assistance  (TA)  grant  for  capacity  building  and  strengthening  of  the \nregulatory body is under implementation.2 \n\nB. \n\nInstitutional Analysis \n\n1. \n\nOrganization \n\n3. \nThe corporate powers and functions of MWSS are vested in and exercised by a board of \ntrustees  of  nine  members.  Management  of  the  company  is  vested  in  the administrator, who is \nseconded  by  the  deputy  administrator.  There  are  three  major  departments:  (i)  Administration \nand  Finance;  (ii)  Engineering  and  Project  Management;  and  (iii)  Asset  Management,  and \nGeneral Services. The existing organizational structure is presented in Figure A4. \n\nMWSS  has  104  employees,  complemented  by  68  contractual  staff.  A  summary  of \n\n4. \nmanpower is presented in Table A4.1.  \n\nTable A4.1:  MWSS Personnel \n\nDepartment \nBoard Secretariat \nAdministrator\u2019s Office \nDeputy Administrator\u2019s Office \nLegal Division \nAdministration and Finance \nEngineering and PMO  \nAsset Management and General Services \n\nEmployees \n14 \n5 \n4 \n6 \n28 \n20 \n27 \n\n104 \n\nTotal \nSource: MWSS. \n\n                                                 \n1 \n2 \n\n \nImplemented under Executive Order No. 286 dated December 6, 1995.\nADB. 2001.

While most of the \nexisting positions are filled, there appears to be a need for MWSS to increase manpower and/or \nefficiency to fulfill its mandate.   \n\n2. \n\nAdministration and Finance Department \n\nOf  the  28  regular  personnel  under  the  Administration  and  Finance  Department,  7  are \n6. \ncertified  public  accountants,  12  are  accounting  majors,  while  the  others  are  commerce  or \nbusiness administration graduates. While the qualifications of the staff appear to be adequate, \nthe  program  of  work,  information  technology,  and  efficiency  require  improvement to cope with \nresponsibilities requiring a great deal of work.  \n\n7. \nSince 1997 training for financial personnel has been conducted on three topics: (i) fiscal \nand  property  management;  (ii)  cash  flow  statement;  and  (iii)  financial  information  system  for \nexternally  assisted  projects.  Most  of  the  personnel  in  the  Finance  Department  have  attended \nthese training programs, which are shown in Table A4.2 \n\nTable A4.2: Training Conducted, 1998-1999 \n\nTitle of Training \nFiscal and Property Management \nCash Flow Statement \nFinancial Information System  \n\nfor Foreign Assisted Projects \n\nSource: MWSS. \n\nDate  \nOctober 1998 \nMay 1999 \nOctober 1999 \n\nDuration \n40 hours \n16 hours \n24 hours \n\nAttendees \n21 \n24 \n36 \n\n8. \nImproving  information  technology  and  upgrading  of  the  computer  system  could \nsignificantly  increase  staff  efficiency.  An  inventory  of  computer  units  available  to  the \nAdministration  and  Finance  Department  shows  an  almost  one-to-one  ratio  between  regular \npersonnel and computers. However, a number of computers are outdated, which is aggravated \nby  incompatibility  of  operating  systems  and  lack  of  an  adequate  network,  resulting  in  low \nefficiency  and  lack  of  information  sharing.  Standard  spreadsheet  software  is  being  used,  but \nfiles are currently not linked, requiring duplication of work in encoding data and manual report \ngeneration. \n\n3. \n\nCapacity Building  \n\n9. \nFor FY1999 and FY2000 the Commission on Audit (COA) rendered an adverse opinion \non  the  fairness  and  presentation  of  the  financial  statements  of  MWSS,  citing  a  number  of \nfindings and recommendations that needed to be implemented by MWSS. The adverse opinion \non  the  audited  accounts  has  been  aggravated  by  the  fact  that  many  of  the  recommendations \npreviously made by COA have not been fully implemented by MWSS. This issue, together with \nfindings of the Mission, has revealed weaknesses in MWSS financial management, accounting, \nand control that need to be addressed through capacity building.  \n\nTraining  programs  for  capacity  building  will  include  (i)  management  accounting;  (ii) \n10. \ncorporate  planning,  budgeting,  and  budgetary  control;  (iii)  financial  accounting;  (iv)  internal \ncontrol  and  audit  systems;  and  (v)  data  processing.  Training  will  be  complemented  by  the \npreparation  of  guidelines  and  manuals  for  specific  financial  activities  including  (i)  budgeting \nprocedure;  (ii)  accounting  system;  (iii)  cash  management;  (iv)  auditing;  (v)  report  generation; \nand  (vi)  internal  control.  The  need  for  improved  information  technology  will  be  addressed \nthrough procurement and installation of computer hardware and software including an adequate \n\n\f22 \n\n \n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nC. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n1. \n\nIntroduction \n\nnetwork for the Administration and Finance Department. Outline terms of reference and budget \nfor capacity building are presented in Appendix 7. \n\n11. \nFinancial analysis was carried out following the  Guidelines for the Financial Governance \nand Management of Investment Projects Financed by the Asian Development Bank, including (i) \nevaluation  of  the  financial  performance  of  MWSS  for  the  past  3  years,  1999  \u2013  2001;  and  (ii) \npreparation of financial projections for the duration of the Project. \n\n2. \n\nCurrent Performance \n\n12.  MWSS\u2019 single major source of revenue comes from concession fees paid by MWSI and \nMWCI.  Smaller  portions  are  derived  from  rentals  of  leased  properties,  interest  income,  and \nother operating and service income.  The  concession fees are determined by the provisions of \nthe concession agreements and have to provide for three major expenditures: (i) MWSS current \noperating  budget  (COB);  (ii)  debt  service  of  existing  loans;  and  (iii)  counterpart  funds  for \nongoing investment projects.   \n\n13. \nThe standard accounting system and procedure being followed by MWSS is embodied \nin  the  Government  Accounting  and  Auditing  Manual  (GAAM).  It  provides  guidelines  for \nmaintaining  financial  records  of  property,  keeping  books  of  account,  and  compiling  final \naccounts and financial statements. Accounting standards, particularly those related to financial \nreporting,  are  defined  by  COA.  Aside  from  the  GAAM,  no  other  guidelines  or  manuals  are \navailable to the financial staff to provide guidance on day-to-day operations.  \n\n14. \nDue to the absence of a corporate planning group, no multiyear budgeting is being done. \nPlanning is limited to short-term budgeting and control procedures, which are based on annual \nplans.  The  annual  budget  is  prepared  each  year  but  the  mandate  of  MWSS  with  a  privatized \noperation  exempts  it  from  the  General  Appropriation  Act.  Thus,  it  does  not  undergo  the  usual \nbudget  cycle  that  regular  government  agencies  are  subjected  to,  and  it  does  not  have  any \nspecific compliance date as far as DBM is concerned. \n\nThe COA Annual Audit Report discusses its findings relative to the legality and regularity \n15. \nof  transactions  and,  to  a  limited  extent,  the  evaluation  of  the  adequacy  and  effectiveness  of \nsystems and procedures of certain aspects of the operations of MWSS, the main objectives of \nwhich were to ascertain the fairness and reliability of its financial position and the results of its \noperations. For FY1999 and FY2000, the Auditor rendered an adverse opinion on the fairness \nof  presentation  of  the  financial  statements  of  MWSS,  citing  a  number  of  findings  and \nrecommendations  that  would  need  the  implementation  of  MWSS.  MWSS,  in  consultation  with \nCOA and ADB, has developed and implemented a time-bound action plan to address the issues \nraised.  In  March  2002,  COA  confirmed  that,  per  their  evaluation  of  the  actions  taken,  MWSS \nhad  substantially  complied  with  audit  recommendations.  Of  the  six  findings  that  caused  the \nadverse opinion on the financial statements for FY2000, three had been fully implemented, two \nsubstantially  complied  with,  and  one  partly  implemented.  For  FY2001,  COA  rendered  an \nunqualified opinion on the accounts of two MWSS projects financed by ADB. A qualified opinion \nwas  rendered  on  a  third  ADB-financed  project,  but  was  not  considered  to  be  a  material \nqualification, since it would not have adverse impact on the quality of the project.  \n\n16.  Because of the devaluation of the Philippine peso, the cost of debt service has increased \nconsiderably, and MWSI, which had taken on 90% of the existing debt at the time of concession \ncommencement,  requested  adjustment  of  water  tariffs  in  September  2000.  An  agreement  for \ntariff adjustment was reached one year later, becoming effective for MWSI on 20 October 2001 \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\n23\n\nand for MWCI on 12 November 2001. MWSI has been in arrears in payment of concession fees \nsince  March  2001.  Following  tariff  adjustment,  MWSI  committed  to  pay  COB  for  2002  fully  in \nJanuary  2002,  and  all  outstanding  fees  for  debt  service  and  progress  billing  including  interest \nand incidental expenses incurred in  June 2002. However, payment of outstanding concession \nfees  has  not  been  settled  yet.  In  the  meantime,  MWSS  has  applied  for  short-term loans from \nlocal  and  foreign  banks  to  bridge  the  financial  gap  caused  by  the  delayed  payment  of \nconcession  fees.  By  the  end  of  2002,  MWSI  had  given  notice  that  it  would  terminate  its \nconcession  agreement,  and  arbitration \ntermination \narrangements. \n\nto  decide  about \n\nis  ongoing \n\nthe \n\n17.  Prior to the issuance of Republic Act 8424, the Tax Reform Act of 1997, MWSS had been \nenjoying  tax  exempt  status  from  the  Bureau  of  Internal  Revenue  (BIR).  However,  the  issue  of \nwhether MWSS was still covered by the exemption from corporate tax came up in 1997 when \nBIR issued a new list of exempt agencies that did not include MWSS. A number of studies and \nconsultations with BIR were done to settle the issue. Finally, in May 2001, a legal opinion was \nissued by BIR confirming the tax exempt status of MWSS. \n\n18.  MWSS  is  in  the  process  of  restating  and  clearing  its  financial  statements  according  to \nCOA\u2019s recommendations. In the absence of restated accounts, the analysis of MWSS\u2019 existing \nfinancial statements for 1999- 2001, on which the auditor expressed an adverse opinion, as well \nas  projections  based  on  these  statements,  could  be  misleading.  The  income  statements  for \n1999- 2001,  for  instance,  would  indicate  that  the  company  has  not  been  profitable  in  its \noperation, which is caused mainly by the nonclassification of concession fees for debt service \nand progress billing as revenue for the 3 year period.

Financial  projections  have  been  prepared  and  are  presented  in  Tables  A4.7  to  A4.10. \nHowever, it is evident that the financial viability of MWSS and the Project is largely dependent \non the two concessionaires. When MWSI failed to pay the concession fee for several months, \nMWSS had to use its unappropriated reserve funds to meet obligations and finally had to resort \nto  domestic  and  international  short-term  borrowing  to  meet  its  financial  obligations.  The \nresolution  of  several  issues,  including  tariff  adjustment  for  currency  devaluation,  will  hopefully \ncontribute  to  improved  financial  performance  and  reporting.  The  tax  exemption  of  MWSS  on \npayment  of  corporate  tax  likewise  settles  the  issue  of  proper  accounting  of  all  relevant \nrevenues, thus providing management with accurate financial information in the future.  \n\n20. \nThe  effect  of  the  proposed  TA  loan  is  indicated  in  the  projections.  It  is  expected  that \nMWSS  will  have  to  pay  about  P31.2  million  for  annual  debt  service  from  2007  to  2013. \nHowever,  debt  service  will  have  to  be  covered  through  the  concession  fees  subject  to  tariff \nadjustments,  thus  having  limited  impact  on  the  financial  performance  of  MWSS.  Based  on  an \naverage billed water volume for 2002 of 1,500 million liters per day the required tariff adjustment \nin  2007  would  probably  be  in  the  range  of  about  P0.06  per  cubic  meter.  This  compares  with \ncurrent domestic water tariffs of P15.76 per cubic meter for the MWSI service area and P10.06 \nper cubic meter for the MWCI service area.3 However, billed water demand will have increased \nconsiderably until loan repayment starts, thus reducing the required tariff adjustment. A detailed \nfinancial analysis will be carried out for the new water source investment projects resulting from \nthe TA loan, for which debt service will also have to be covered through the concession fees. \n\n                                                 \n \n3\n  Source: MWSS.\n\n\fItem\n\nOperating and Service Income\nRevenue from Concession\n   - Current Operating Budget (COB)\n

However, growing water demand in the \narea is difficult to meet from existing sources, and deep wells render inadequate yield and are \ncostly to operate. The Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS), in cooperation \nwith  MWCI,  is  considering  providing  water  to  the  area  from  the  existing  Wawa  Dam  (the \nProject).  \n\nThe  Project  will  comprise  the  renovation  of  the  dam  including  water  intake,  removal  of \n2. \nsilt  from  the  reservoir,  and  construction  of  a  new  transmission  pipeline  and  water  treatment \nplant.  The  water  treatment  plant  will  be  located  close  to  the  dam  on  a  site  already  owned  by \nMWSS,  which  also  has  the  right  of  way  for  the  new  pipeline.

It \nis also anticipated that the new water sources will contribute to maintaining low water costs and \nimproving livelihood, hygiene, and sanitation standards of serviced households. These benefits \nare expected to result in a reduction of household expenses and greater income opportunities \nfor  poor  water  users.  The  projects  will  particularly  benefit  women,  who  among  all  household \nmembers are usually the ones who are most involved in water use.  \n\n2. \nThe Project will document poverty and social development concerns in accordance with \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  Handbook  on  Poverty  and  Social  Analysis  by  preparing  the \nappropriate  sections  of  the  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment  and  a  poverty  and  social \nanalysis  report  detailing  poverty  and  social  impacts  for  each  of  the  water  sources  to  be \ndeveloped. \n\nThe poverty and social analysis will focus on the following: (i) determine the magnitude \n3. \nand likely impact of the Project on the poor, (ii) identify design measures that will enhance the \nProject\u2019s  contribution  to  poverty  reduction  and  social  development,  (iii)  identify  constraints  for \nvulnerable groups to benefit from the Project and identify design measures to overcome these \nconstraints,  (iv)  conduct  gender  analysis  to  identify  potentials  and  constraints  for  women  to \nparticipate  in  and  benefit  from  the  Project,  and  (v)  identify  how  water  users  can  be  mobilized \nthrough participatory mechanisms in the preparation of the new water sources. \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n  47\n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARDS ISSUES \n\n(Involuntary Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples) \n\n1. \nThe  Metropolitan  Waterworks  and  Sewerage  System  New  Water  Source  Development \ntechnical assistance loan (the Project) constitutes an effort to facilitate the planning of new water \nsource projects for Metro Manila including (i) the Wawa River Project, entailing the rehabilitation of \nthe Wawa Dam and Reservoir and the construction of a pipeline and water treatment plant; (ii) the \nAngat Water Utilization and Aqueduct Improvement Project, entailing the repair and construction \nof aqueducts and associated facilities; and (iii) the Laiban Dam Project entailing the construction \nof  a  major  dam  and  associated  infrastructure.  In  case  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will \nconsider participating in financing of these projects the planning work carried out under the Project \nwill provide an extensive base for their final preparation.  \n \n2. \nIn designing the Project attention was given to land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) \nand indigenous peoples (IP) issues. Initial social assessments (ISAs) of LAR and IP impacts will \nbe prepared. When warranted by the ISAs, (i) preliminary LAR plans (PLARPs) fitting the ADB \nPolicy on Involuntary Resettlement as outlined in ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to \nGood  Practice1, and  (ii)  preliminary  IP  development  plans  (PIPDPs)  fitting  the  ADB  Policy  on \nIndigenous Peoples will be prepared.  \n\nPLARPs planning will follow several principles, including the following: (i) impacts will be \n3. \nminimized as much as possible based on a thorough analysis of design alternatives; (ii) LAR will \nbe planned so as to improve or at least restore the living standards of the affected people (AP); \n(iii)  APs  eligible  for  compensation  and  rehabilitation  will  include  informal  settlers  and  IPs;  (iv) \nimpact  surveys  will  be  based  on  recent  cadastral  maps;  (v)  APs  will  be  fully  consulted  on \ncompensation and rehabilitation options; (vi) affected assets will be valued at replacement and \nmarket  rates  based  on  ad  hoc  surveys;  (vii)  detailed  resettlement  areas  and  agricultural \nreplacement  areas  plans  will  be \nthe  PLARPs;  and  (viii)  compensation, \nagricultural/residential replacement plots, and relocation subsidies will be scheduled so as to be \ndelivered in full prior to impoundment, ground leveling, or demolition. \n\nincluded \n\nin \n\n4. \nPIPDP initiatives will be commensurate to IPs' degree of vulnerability, impact type, and \nagreements  between  the  Executing  Agency  and  IPs.  If  affected  IPs  are  fully  integrated  in \nmainstream  society  and  culture  and  impacts  have  no  specific  sociocultural  dimensions, the \nPIPDPs  will  be  included  as  a  chapter  in  the  PLARP.  The  same  applies  if  affected  IPs  keep  a \ndegree  of  sociocultural  and  institutional  distinction  and  impacts  carry  some  sociocultural \ndimension but do not have broad community effects. However, if affected IPs maintain a degree \nof sociocultural and institutional distinction and impacts not only carry a sociocultural dimension \nbut  have  wide  community  or  livelihood  effects,  the  PIPDPs  will  be  prepared  as  stand-alone \ndocuments inclusive of a participatory community development action plan (CDAP), and specific \nimplementation schedules and budgets. \n\n5. \nPLARP and PIDP planning will be based on a participatory process involving civil society \nand APs. Particular attention will be given in ensuring that the design of eventual residential and \nagricultural  replacement  land  schemes,  or  of  PIPDPs\u2019  CDAPs,  is  carried  out  with  the \nparticipation  and  endorsement  of  the  beneficiary  communities  and  their  nongovernment \norganization representatives. \n\n                                                 \n1 \n\nCases affecting 200 or more APs, or 100 or more APs belonging to IP or vulnerable groups require a full LARP; \ncases affecting less than 200 APs or 100 IP or vulnerable groups APs require only a short LARP (for details and \ndefinitions see the \u201cADB Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice\".)  \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nIn case ADB will consider in the future participating in financing of a project developed \n6. \nunder the TA Loan, PLARPs and PIPDPs will be thoroughly reviewed during project appraisal \nincluding  consultations  with  the  APs,  update  of  impact  surveys  based  on  detailed  design, \nrevised plans for resettlement areas, and new schedules and budgets, as may be required.  \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 1 September 2003) \n", "Currency Unit \nP1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "peso (P) \n$0.0182 \nP55.04 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nAP \nAUSAID \nAWUAIP \nBIR \nCDAP \nCOA \nCOB \nDBM \nDILG \nECC \nGAAM \nIASC \nIP \nIPSA \nISA \nLAR \nLGU \nLIBOR \nLWUA \nMLD \nMTPDP \nMWCI \nMWSI \nMWSS \nNRW \nNWRB \nPIPDP \nPLARP \nPMO \nPSAR \nPSP \nQCBS \nSOE \nTA \nTOR \nWSS \n", "inter-agency steering committee \nindigenous peoples \ninitial poverty and social assessment \nInitial social assessment \nland acquisition and resettlement \nlocal government unit \nLondon Interbank Offered Rate \nLocal Water Utilities Administration \n", "Asian Development Bank \naffected people \nAustralian Agency for International Development \nAngat Water Utilization and Aqueduct Improvement Project \nBureau of Internal Revenue \ncommunity development action plan \nCommission on Audit \ncurrent operating budget \nDepartment of Budget and Management \nDepartment of the Interior and Local Government \nenvironmental compliance certificate \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Government Accounting and Auditing Manual \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  million liters per day \n\u2013  Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan \n\u2013  Manila Water Company, Inc. \n\u2013  Maynilad Water Services, Inc. \n\u2013  Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "nonrevenue water \nNational Water Resources Board \nPreliminary Indigenous Peoples Development Plan \npreliminary land acquisition and resettlement plan \nproject management office \npoverty and social analysis report \nprivate sector participation \nquality- and-cost-based selection \nstatement of expenditure \ntechnical assistance \nterms of reference \nwater supply and sanitation \n", "NOTES \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "(i) \n", "The  fiscal  year  (FY)  of  the  Government  and  its  agencies  ends  on  31  December.
