About 9,200 people live \n3. \non 31 hectares, which makes it one of the most densely populated areas in the Pacific. Ebeye is \nalso very vulnerable to many waterborne diseases and other transmissible diseases, including \nCOVID-19.  The  high  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases  results  from  (i)  limited  access  to  safe \nwater; (ii) inadequate hygiene, particularly among children; and (iii) a rundown sanitation system.2 \n \n4. \nCurrent project. On 28 September 2015, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved \na  grant  of  $5.00  million  from  its  Special  Funds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund),  and  the \nadministration of a grant of $4.00 million from the Government of Australia, for the current project. \nThe  executing  agency  is  the  Office  of  the  Chief  Secretary,  and  the  implementing  agency  is \nKwajalein  Atoll  Joint  Utilities  Resources,  Inc.  (KAJUR).  The  estimated  cost  of  the  project  is \n$19.02 million, to which the government is contributing $10.02 million.  The current project was \ndeclared effective on 3 December 2015, and the closing date is 30 June 2022. As of 18 July 2020, \ncumulative contract awards stood at $9.00 million (100%),  and the disbursements of ADB and \nAustralian grant proceeds at $8.54 million (94.9%). The physical progress is 85%. The current \nproject performance rating is on track.3 \n \n5. \nThe current project has made solid progress. Output 1: effective and efficient sewerage \nservices was largely achieved. The new saltwater desalination plant was completed and started \noperating in September 2017 with full capacity of 1,600 cubic meters per day (m3/day), in line with \nthe  design\u2013build\u2013manage  (DBM)  contract.  The  old  desalination  plant  was  decommissioned \nbecause of the outdated technology, lack of spare parts, higher energy consumption, and unsafe \noperation.  The  freshwater  supply  network  was  expanded  by  4.6  kilometers  (km),  and  all \n1,465 households in Ebeye now have access to adequate and continuous supply of fresh water \nusing prepayment water meters.4 The average daily production is about 520 m3/day, but up to \n50% is lost to leakage in the distribution network (mainly from household water tanks). A separate \nsaltwater supply network was upgraded to enable toilet flushing in all households. This included \n\n \n\n1  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2015.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors: \nProposed Grant and Administration of Grant to the Republic of the Marshall Islands for the Ebeye Water Supply and \nSanitation Project. Manila. \n\n2  A 2017 survey of every household on Ebeye recorded 1,465 households and a resident population of 9,242.  \n3  More details are in Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nFurther  information  is  in  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Water  and  Other  Urban  Infrastructure  and  Services \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n4  Prepayment water meters were installed for 827 households, the rest will be installed by 31 October 2020. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fexpanding the pipe system by 5.5 km and improving four pump stations (output 2). KAJUR also \nbuilt two new saltwater wells with a total capacity of 5,700 m3/day to provide 4,000 m3/day of salt \nwater for its desalination plant and 1,200 m3/day for the household toilets. However, a large part \nof the saltwater supply is wasted because many toilet tanks lack float valves. The continuous flow \nof salt water through toilets is estimated to increase the sewage discharged. This issue is dealt \nwith under output 5. \n \n6. \nOutput 2: effective and efficient sewerage services has been delivered. Improvements to \nEbeye\u2019s sewerage system include (i) a new centralized sewage treatment facility with capacity of \n1,400 m3/day;5 (ii) a new marine outfall, with a length of 350 meters; (iii) construction of a new \nsewage pumping station and rehabilitation of four existing ones; (iv) construction of 4.1 km of new \nsewers; and (v) installation of an additional 275 sewer connections to households. More than 90% \nof sewage discharged through the system is collected and treated.  \n \n7. \nOutput  3:  enhanced  hygiene  awareness  and  improved  hygiene  behaviors  has  been \nachieved.  Hygiene  awareness  campaigns  were  conducted  for  Ebeye's  households,  including \n4,999  women  and  4,365  schoolchildren,  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  waterborne  disease.  The \naverage monthly cases of diarrhea reported by Ebeye Hospital has declined by 20% since 2018. \nOutput  3  also  provided  new  sanitation  facilities,  including  gender-segregated  toilets,  to  two \nschools and upgraded existing ones in four other schools. Instilling good hygiene behaviors will \nreduce  the  incidence  of  many  other  waterborne  diseases  that  can  afflict  people,  particularly \nchildren. Further hygiene education will be delivered through ADB regional technical assistance \n(TA) for Strengthening Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Practices and Hygiene Behavioral Change \nin the Pacific, which will enhance the project\u2019s impact.6 \n \n8. \nFor  output  4:  secure  electricity  supply  for  water  and  sewerage  operations,  a  current \ncontract  to  upgrade  Ebeye\u2019s  electricity  distribution  system  will  improve  the  reliability  of  power \nsupply to households, the desalination plant, and KAJUR\u2019s other water and sanitation facilities. \nThe original contract completion date  was August 2020, but travel bans and disruptions of the \nsupply chains because of the COVID-19 pandemic caused delays. The contract is now expected \nto be completed in May 2021. \n \nOutput 5: financial and technical sustainability of Kwajalein Atoll Joint Utility Resource Inc. \n9. \nis  not  fully  achieved,  and  KAJUR  continues  to  rely  on  government  subsidies.  As regards  the \nrevenue from its electricity distribution service, KAJUR has improved the collection ratio to more \nthan 95% due to the use of prepayment meters. However, KAJUR continues to deliver water and \nsewerage  services  at  no  cost.  In  accordance  with  the  State-Owned  Enterprises  Act  (2015), \nKAJUR has now developed a volumetric tariff system, scheduled to start on 1 October 2020, to \nhelp it recover the O&M costs of all its water and sanitation services. The government will meet \nany shortfalls through annual community service obligation subsidies.7 Prepayment water meters \nwere installed under the current project. While KAJUR conducted a campaign to ensure Ebeye \nresidents'  willingness  to  pay  universal  water  tariffs,  the  tariff  collection  may  take  longer  than \nanticipated because COVID-19 has reduced household incomes. KAJUR has begun a household \nfixture  program  aimed  at  encouraging  water  conservation  and  reducing  energy  consumption, \nwhich involves installing missing toilet valves and water-efficient fixtures. \n\n \n\n5  Wastewater reuse is not proposed, given the relatively small size of the sewerage system and sewage loads, and \n\nthe costs of treating wastewater to make it reusable as a non-potable water source. \n\n6  ADB.  2020.  Technical  Assistance  for  Strengthening  Water,  Sanitation,  and  Hygiene  Practices  and  Hygiene \n\nBehavioral Change in the Pacific. Manila (TA 6551-REG). \n\n7  KAJUR is eligible for annual payments for the delivery of services to meet community service obligations under the \n\nState-Owned Enterprises Act (2015). \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f \n10. \nFurther assistance required. The current DBM contract for the desalination plant expired \nin  September  2020,  and  the  plan  was  that  KAJUR  operators  trained  under  the  DBM  contract \nwould then take over the plant's O&M. The DBM contract is based on performance, which among \nother things obliges the contractor to provide the plant consumables (excluding electricity) and to \ntrain and manage the KAJUR plant operators that were seconded to the contractor. Theoretically, \nthese KAJUR employees would now have the capacity to run the plant under normal operating \nconditions. However, recent events such as rolling electricity outages caused by power station \nbreakdowns  showed  that  the  plant  operators require  additional  training  to  manage  emergency \nand  other  unusual  situations.8  KAJUR's  capacity  to  handle  emergency  situations  at  the \ndesalination  plant  is  essential  for  the  sustainability  of  both  the  plant  and  Ebeye\u2019s  freshwater \nsupply. More investment is required to extend the current DBM contract so that the knowledge \nand skill transfer can be deepened and KAJUR staff will be fully able to operate the desalination \nplant once the contract ends, thus ensuring sustainable water supply. Minor physical investment \nis  needed  to  provide  the  plant  with  corrosion  protection,  a  standby  generator,  and  additional \nelectrical switchgear, to ensure safe and reliable electricity supply to the desalination plant and to \nKAJUR's other water and sanitation assets. \n \n11.  With  the  new  desalination  plant  and  the  upgraded  water  supply  system  in  place,  it  is \nnecessary to better manage nonrevenue water and improve operational efficiency. KAJUR needs \nto build the technical capacity for asset management to optimize the operation of the freshwater \nand saltwater supply systems, which will also help  it achieve financial sustainability. Financing \nsupport is also required to extend the household fixture program. As part of its response to the \nCOVID-19  pandemic,  the  government  requested  ADB  support  to  help  it  improve  the  onsite \nsanitation  systems  in  the  small  islet  communities  north  of  Ebeye.  The  proposed  additional \nfinancing  would  help  review  and  recommend  options  to  achieve  this,  while  the  regional  TA \n(footnote  7)  would  deliver  an  additional  hygiene  awareness  and  handwashing  campaign  to \nprevent transmissible diseases such as COVID-19. \n \n12. \nAdditional financing. The additional financing sought by the government will strengthen \nthe sustainability of the current project and increase the project benefits. The overall project is \ntechnically feasible, economically viable, and financially sound, and remains a high priority of the \ngovernment.  It  is  aligned  with  the  Marshall  Islands\u2019  water  and  sanitation  policy  objectives,  as \narticulated in its draft National Strategic Plan 2020\u20132030.9 The overall project will contribute to \nSustainable Development Goal 6\u2014ensure access to water and sanitation for all\u2014and aligns with \nthe operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: (i) reducing remaining poverty and inequalities; \n(ii)  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality;  (iii)  tackling  climate  change,  building  climate  and \ndisaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; (iv) making cities more livable; \nand (v) strengthening governance and institutional capacity.  \n \nEligibility criteria. ADB\u2019s due diligence confirmed that the project meets the additional \n13. \nfinancing  eligibility  criteria  and  standards.  The  overall  project  (i)  remains  technically  feasible, \neconomically viable, and financially sound; (ii) is accorded high priority by the government; and \n(iii) is consistent with the current project\u2019s development objectives. So far, the project has been \neffective, but further work is required to ensure its sustainability. The government is complying \nwith  the  grant  covenants  and  assurances,  and  the  project\u2019s  environmental  and  involuntary \nresettlement safeguard requirements are being met. The additional financing modality is suitable \nbecause of (i) the close links to the current project\u2019s scope, which means that it can be efficiently \n\n8  A disaster and emergency response plan was prepared for the desalination plant. \n9  Government of the Marshall Islands. 2020.

Majuro. \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fimplemented  under  the  same  implementation  arrangements;  (ii)  the  natural  continuity  of  the \ncurrent  project;  and  (iii)  the  opportunity  to  sustain  the  benefits  of  the  current  project.  Project \npreparatory  activities  include  (i)  environmental  and  social  assessments  carried  out  under  the \ncurrent project; (ii) review and possible extension of the ongoing DBM contract; and (iii) terms of \nreference of the capacity-building consultants. \n \n14. \nCOVID-19.  The  project  remains  highly  relevant  in  the  COVID-19  pandemic  context. \nSustainable water supply and sanitation, and good hygienic conditions are essential in stopping \nthe  spread  of the virus and  helping  restore  an environment  of  economic  safety.  Strengthening \nhealthy hygienic behaviors will reduce the incidence of many other waterborne diseases that can \nafflict people, particularly children. \n \nB. \n \n15. \nThe overall project is aligned with the following impact: incidence of waterborne disease \non Ebeye reduced, which includes achieving the Marshall Islands\u2019 national development policy \nobjectives of (i) improved sanitation for better health and well-being; and (ii) constant access to \ndrinking  water  that meets  World  Health Organization  standards,  as  articulated  in  the  country\u2019s \nNational  Strategic  Plan,  2020\u20132030  (footnote  9).  The  overall  project  will  have  the  following \noutcome: access to safe water and sanitation improved.10 The overall project outputs will be more \nrobust since the additional financing supports the following: \n \n16. \nKAJUR\u2019s water supply operations will be strengthened by \n\nOutput  1:  Secure  and  safe  supplies  of  fresh  water  ensured.

The project design reflects lessons from the current \nproject and from previous ADB and development partner operations in water supply and sanitation \nin Pacific developing member countries. Key lessons include that (i) building adequate financial \nand  technical  capacity  is  essential  for  the  sustainable  delivery  of  water  supply  and  sewerage \nservices, and (ii) urban service demand and willingness to pay must be ensured. \n \nD. \n \n21. \nThe overall project is estimated to cost $22.40 million (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates \nby  expenditure  category  and  by  financier  are  included  in  the  project  administration  manual \n(PAM).11 \n \n22. \nThe government requested a grant not exceeding $3.00 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the project. The summary financing plan is \nin  Table  2.  ADB  will  finance  the  expenditures  relating  to  the  extension  of  the  operations \ncomponent of the DBM contract, minor works and equipment to upgrade the desalination plant \nbuilding and power supply, procurement of a new freshwater booster pump, strengthening of the \noperational capacity of water supply, and expansion of the household fixture program. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n11 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \nItem \nA.

The  procurement  of  goods  and  works will  follow  shopping  procedures,  except for the \nextension of the DBM contract for the  desalination plant (output 1) and for the procurement of \nadditional switchgear (output 4), which will follow direct procurement methods. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nA. \n \n25.  Water supply and sewerage infrastructure financed under the current project are delivering \nthe  services  as  envisaged  at  the  project  appraisal.  But  further  investments  are  required  to \nstrengthen KAJUR\u2019s capacity to operate the desalination plant in emergency situations and run \nthe water distribution systems effectively, and to improve the security of electricity supply (through \nminor investments) to KAJUR's water and sanitation assets. \n \n\n12 ADB.  2013.

The overall project\u2019s economic internal rate of return is estimated at 13.4%. Sensitivity \nanalysis  was  carried  out  with  respect  to  the  key  parameters  of  incremental  costs  such  as \ninvestment, O&M, and incremental benefits, including the following scenarios: (i) a 20% increase \nin investment costs, (ii) a 20% increase in O&M costs, (iii) a 20% decrease in the incremental \nsupply benefits, and (iv) a 2-year delay. Under the most adverse scenario of a 20% decrease in \nbenefits and a 20% increase in total costs, the economic internal rate of return falls to 6.9% but \nis still higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital estimated at of 6.0% for countries in \nfragile and conflict-affected situations, such as the Marshall Islands.13 \n \nThe project\u2019s financial internal rate of return is estimated at 1.3%. This result is deemed \n27. \nacceptable because revenues are expected to be sufficient to cover routine O&M costs (though \nnot all major maintenance or replacement costs, or depreciation). ADB will provide continuous \nsupport under the project to enhance KAJUR\u2019s financial capacity.14 \n \nC. \n \n28. \nThe additional financing will strengthen KAJUR\u2019s financial management and its capacity \nto effectively operate and maintain its water supply and sewerage assets. KAJUR has developed \na framework to enable the recovery of water and sewerage O&M costs, applicable from 1 October \n2020. A household survey conducted in June 2020 indicates that 78% of households are willing \nto pay for KAJUR water services, with 62% of households willing to pay more than $8 per month. \n \nD. \n \n29. \nThe financial management risk of KAJUR is rated high. Since 2008, KAJUR has recorded \noperating losses of $2.0 million or more, mostly because of inadequate tariffs and high fuel costs \nfor its electricity production. In 2018\u20132019, KAJUR recorded a spike in operating losses of about \n$3.5 million. Limited financial reporting, poor record management, and recent changes in senior \nmanagement  also  contributed  to  the  poor  financial  performance.  The  project  incorporates \nmitigating measures. KAJUR will be responsible for maintaining project accounts and preparing \ngrant withdrawal applications. A financial management advisor will be recruited under the project \nto assist KAJUR and to continue building its capacity. Procurement risks are considered low. \n \nIntegrity due diligence was conducted and revealed no significant integrity risks.15 ADB\u2019s \n30. \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ngovernment  and  the  Office  of  the  Chief  Secretary.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 11). \n \nE. \n \n31. \nEbeye  residents  suffer  a  very  high  incidence  of  gastroenteritis  and  other  waterborne \ndiseases. The project impact will be fewer waterborne diseases. A 20% reduction in the incidence \nof such diseases since 2017 can be attributed to better access to safe water and sanitation, and \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nGovernance \n\n13 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n15 ADB. 2003.

The additional financing will strengthen the \nsustainability of KAJUR's water and sanitation services and ensure that all households on Ebeye \nhave access to safe water and improved sanitation. The project is classified as effective gender \nmainstreaming. It includes gender design features to ensure women\u2019s participation in the project \nand  their  access  to  project  benefits  including:  (i)  ensuring  120  households  headed  by  women \nhave  access  to  safe  water  and  improved  sanitation,  and  (ii)  establishing  links  with  vocational \ntraining centers to recruit qualified women for employment opportunities in KAJUR. \n\nF.\n\nSafeguards\n\n32.\nThe safeguard categorizations for the additional financing are environment (B), involuntary\nresettlement (C), and indigenous peoples (C). KAJUR has built up its capacity to effectively meet\nthe project safeguard requirements.
