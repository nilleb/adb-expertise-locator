THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Republic of the Marshall Islands for the additional financing of the Ebeye Water Supply and \nSanitation Project. \n \n2.  The current project will improve access to safe water and sanitation, and reduce the \nincidence of waterborne disease in Ebeye.1 The additional financing will support the operation \nand maintenance (O&M) of the current project to ensure the water supply sustainability and \nexpand the sanitation service which will help to contain the transmission of coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19). \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Ebeye is the second-largest urban center of the Marshall Islands. About 9,200 people live \non 31 hectares, which makes it one of the most densely populated areas in the Pacific. Ebeye is \nalso very vulnerable to many waterborne diseases and other transmissible diseases, including \nCOVID-19. The high incidence of waterborne diseases results from (i) limited access to safe \nwater; (ii) inadequate hygiene, particularly among children; and (iii) a rundown sanitation system.2 \n \n4.  Current project. On 28 September 2015, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved \na grant of $5.00 million from its Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund), and the \nadministration of a grant of $4.00 million from the Government of Australia, for the current project. \nThe executing agency is the Office of the Chief Secretary, and the implementing agency is \nKwajalein Atoll Joint Utilities Resources, Inc. (KAJUR). The estimated cost of the project is \n$19.02 million, to which the government is contributing $10.02 million. The current project was \ndeclared effective on 3 December 2015, and the closing date is 30 June 2022. As of 18 July 2020, \ncumulative contract awards stood at $9.00 million (100%), and the disbursements of ADB and \nAustralian grant proceeds at $8.54 million (94.9%). The physical progress is 85%. The current \nproject performance rating is on track.3 \n \n5.  The current project has made solid progress. Output 1: effective and efficient sewerage \nservices was largely achieved. The new saltwater desalination plant was completed and started \noperating in September 2017 with full capacity of 1,600 cubic meters per day (m3/day), in line with \nthe design\u2013build\u2013manage (DBM) contract. The old desalination plant was decommissioned \nbecause of the outdated technology, lack of spare parts, higher energy consumption, and unsafe \noperation.  The  freshwater  supply  network  was  expanded  by  4.6  kilometers  (km),  and  all \n1,465 households in Ebeye now have access to adequate and continuous supply of fresh water \nusing prepayment water meters.4 The average daily production is about 520 m3/day, but up to \n50% is lost to leakage in the distribution network (mainly from household water tanks). A separate \nsaltwater supply network was upgraded to enable toilet flushing in all households. This included \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2015. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \nProposed Grant and Administration of Grant to the Republic of the Marshall Islands for the Ebeye Water Supply and \nSanitation Project. Manila. \n2  A 2017 survey of every household on Ebeye recorded 1,465 households and a resident population of 9,242.  \n3  More details are in Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nFurther information is in Sector Assessment (Summary): Water and Other Urban Infrastructure and Services \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n4  Prepayment water meters were installed for 827 households, the rest will be installed by 31 October 2020. \n ", "2 \nexpanding the pipe system by 5.5 km and improving four pump stations (output 2). KAJUR also \nbuilt two new saltwater wells with a total capacity of 5,700 m3/day to provide 4,000 m3/day of salt \nwater for its desalination plant and 1,200 m3/day for the household toilets. However, a large part \nof the saltwater supply is wasted because many toilet tanks lack float valves. The continuous flow \nof salt water through toilets is estimated to increase the sewage discharged. This issue is dealt \nwith under output 5. \n \n6.  Output 2: effective and efficient sewerage services has been delivered. Improvements to \nEbeye\u2019s sewerage system include (i) a new centralized sewage treatment facility with capacity of \n1,400 m3/day;5 (ii) a new marine outfall, with a length of 350 meters; (iii) construction of a new \nsewage pumping station and rehabilitation of four existing ones; (iv) construction of 4.1 km of new \nsewers; and (v) installation of an additional 275 sewer connections to households. More than 90% \nof sewage discharged through the system is collected and treated.  \n \n7.  Output 3: enhanced hygiene awareness and improved hygiene behaviors has been \nachieved. Hygiene awareness campaigns were conducted for Ebeye's households, including \n4,999 women and 4,365 schoolchildren, to reduce the incidence of waterborne disease. The \naverage monthly cases of diarrhea reported by Ebeye Hospital has declined by 20% since 2018. \nOutput 3 also provided new sanitation facilities, including gender-segregated toilets, to two \nschools and upgraded existing ones in four other schools. Instilling good hygiene behaviors will \nreduce the incidence of many other waterborne diseases that can afflict people, particularly \nchildren. Further hygiene education will be delivered through ADB regional technical assistance \n(TA) for Strengthening Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Practices and Hygiene Behavioral Change \nin the Pacific, which will enhance the project\u2019s impact.6 \n \n8.  For output 4: secure electricity supply for water and sewerage operations, a current \ncontract to upgrade Ebeye\u2019s electricity distribution system will improve the reliability of power \nsupply to households, the desalination plant, and KAJUR\u2019s other water and sanitation facilities. \nThe original contract completion date was August 2020, but travel bans and disruptions of the \nsupply chains because of the COVID-19 pandemic caused delays. The contract is now expected \nto be completed in May 2021. \n \n9.  Output 5: financial and technical sustainability of Kwajalein Atoll Joint Utility Resource Inc. \nis not fully achieved, and KAJUR continues to rely on government subsidies. As regards the \nrevenue from its electricity distribution service, KAJUR has improved the collection ratio to more \nthan 95% due to the use of prepayment meters. However, KAJUR continues to deliver water and \nsewerage services at no cost. In accordance with the State-Owned Enterprises Act (2015), \nKAJUR has now developed a volumetric tariff system, scheduled to start on 1 October 2020, to \nhelp it recover the O&M costs of all its water and sanitation services. The government will meet \nany shortfalls through annual community service obligation subsidies.7 Prepayment water meters \nwere installed under the current project. While KAJUR conducted a campaign to ensure Ebeye \nresidents' willingness to pay universal water tariffs, the tariff collection may take longer than \nanticipated because COVID-19 has reduced household incomes. KAJUR has begun a household \nfixture program aimed at encouraging water conservation and reducing energy consumption, \nwhich involves installing missing toilet valves and water-efficient fixtures. \n \n5  Wastewater reuse is not proposed, given the relatively small size of the sewerage system and sewage loads, and \nthe costs of treating wastewater to make it reusable as a non-potable water source. \n6  ADB. 2020. Technical Assistance for Strengthening Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Practices and Hygiene \nBehavioral Change in the Pacific. Manila (TA 6551-REG). \n7  KAJUR is eligible for annual payments for the delivery of services to meet community service obligations under the \nState-Owned Enterprises Act (2015). \n ", "3 \n \n10.  Further assistance required. The current DBM contract for the desalination plant expired \nin September 2020, and the plan was that KAJUR operators trained under the DBM contract \nwould then take over the plant's O&M. The DBM contract is based on performance, which among \nother things obliges the contractor to provide the plant consumables (excluding electricity) and to \ntrain and manage the KAJUR plant operators that were seconded to the contractor. Theoretically, \nthese KAJUR employees would now have the capacity to run the plant under normal operating \nconditions. However, recent events such as rolling electricity outages caused by power station \nbreakdowns showed that the plant operators require additional training to manage emergency \nand  other  unusual  situations.8  KAJUR's  capacity  to  handle  emergency  situations  at  the \ndesalination plant is essential for the sustainability of both the plant and Ebeye\u2019s freshwater \nsupply. More investment is required to extend the current DBM contract so that the knowledge \nand skill transfer can be deepened and KAJUR staff will be fully able to operate the desalination \nplant once the contract ends, thus ensuring sustainable water supply. Minor physical investment \nis needed to provide the plant with corrosion protection, a standby generator, and additional \nelectrical switchgear, to ensure safe and reliable electricity supply to the desalination plant and to \nKAJUR's other water and sanitation assets. \n \n11.  With the new desalination plant and the upgraded water supply system in place, it is \nnecessary to better manage nonrevenue water and improve operational efficiency. KAJUR needs \nto build the technical capacity for asset management to optimize the operation of the freshwater \nand saltwater supply systems, which will also help it achieve financial sustainability. Financing \nsupport is also required to extend the household fixture program. As part of its response to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, the government requested ADB support to help it improve the onsite \nsanitation systems in the small islet communities north of Ebeye.  The proposed additional \nfinancing would help review and recommend options to achieve this, while the regional TA \n(footnote 7) would deliver an additional hygiene awareness and handwashing campaign to \nprevent transmissible diseases such as COVID-19. \n \n12.  Additional financing. The additional financing sought by the government will strengthen \nthe sustainability of the current project and increase the project benefits. The overall project is \ntechnically feasible, economically viable, and financially sound, and remains a high priority of the \ngovernment. It is aligned with the Marshall Islands\u2019 water and sanitation policy objectives, as \narticulated in its draft National Strategic Plan 2020\u20132030.9 The overall project will contribute to \nSustainable Development Goal 6\u2014ensure access to water and sanitation for all\u2014and aligns with \nthe operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: (i) reducing remaining poverty and inequalities; \n(ii) accelerating progress in gender equality; (iii) tackling climate change, building climate and \ndisaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; (iv) making cities more livable; \nand (v) strengthening governance and institutional capacity.  \n \n13.  Eligibility criteria. ADB\u2019s due diligence confirmed that the project meets the additional \nfinancing eligibility criteria and standards. The overall project (i) remains technically feasible, \neconomically viable, and financially sound; (ii) is accorded high priority by the government; and \n(iii) is consistent with the current project\u2019s development objectives. So far, the project has been \neffective, but further work is required to ensure its sustainability. The government is complying \nwith the grant covenants and assurances, and the project\u2019s environmental and involuntary \nresettlement safeguard requirements are being met. The additional financing modality is suitable \nbecause of (i) the close links to the current project\u2019s scope, which means that it can be efficiently \n \n8  A disaster and emergency response plan was prepared for the desalination plant. \n9  Government of the Marshall Islands. 2020. National Strategic Plan, 2020\u20132030. Majuro. \n ", "4 \nimplemented under the same implementation arrangements; (ii) the natural continuity of the \ncurrent project; and (iii) the opportunity to sustain the benefits of the current project. Project \npreparatory activities include (i) environmental and social assessments carried out under the \ncurrent project; (ii) review and possible extension of the ongoing DBM contract; and (iii) terms of \nreference of the capacity-building consultants. \n \n14.  COVID-19. The project remains highly relevant in the COVID-19 pandemic context. \nSustainable water supply and sanitation, and good hygienic conditions are essential in stopping \nthe spread of the virus and helping restore an environment of economic safety. Strengthening \nhealthy hygienic behaviors will reduce the incidence of many other waterborne diseases that can \nafflict people, particularly children. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n15.  The overall project is aligned with the following impact: incidence of waterborne disease \non Ebeye reduced, which includes achieving the Marshall Islands\u2019 national development policy \nobjectives of (i) improved sanitation for better health and well-being; and (ii) constant access to \ndrinking water that meets World Health Organization standards, as articulated in the country\u2019s \nNational Strategic Plan, 2020\u20132030 (footnote 9). The overall project will have the following \noutcome: access to safe water and sanitation improved.10 The overall project outputs will be more \nrobust since the additional financing supports the following: \n \n16.  Output 1: Secure and safe supplies of fresh water ensured. The sustainability of \nKAJUR\u2019s water supply operations will be strengthened by \n(i)  extending the DBM contract for the desalination plant by 2 years with provisions \nfor remote monitoring and O&M support, to strengthen the O&M capacity of \nKAJUR plant personnel; and \n(ii)  upgrading the desalination plant with corrosion protection treatment of pipes and \nequipment, minor structural improvements, and the provision of a standby 440 \nkilovolt-ampere generator for the desalination plant. \n \n17.  Output 2: Effective and efficient sewerage services provided. The additional scope of \noutput 2 will include a gender-responsive survey and review of onsite sanitation systems in the \nislet communities of Ebwaj, Loi, and Guegeegue (about 50 households or 320 people) linked by \nthe Ebeye\u2013Guegeegue causeway. The survey and review will include a gender analysis and \nrecommend  approaches  to  improve  sanitation,  which  plays  an  important  role  in  stopping \ntransmissible diseases such as COVID-19. \n \n18.  Output 4: Secure electricity supply for water supply and sewerage operations \nensured. Output 4 will be expanded to install additional high-voltage electrical switchgear for \nKAJUR\u2019s solar energy plant and the recently installed diesel generators at the power station. \n \n19.  Output 5: Financial and technical sustainability of KAJUR improved. Additional \nactivities to be delivered under output 5: \n(i)  Further strengthening of KAJUR\u2019s financial management capacity by extending the \nservices of KAJUR\u2019s financial management advisor through intermittent inputs \n(8 months) over 2 years. The advisor will help KAJUR implement the water and \nsewerage tariff framework during the initial implementation stage. After 2 years, \nthe tariff collection will cover the O&M costs of KAJUR. \n \n10 The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "5 \n(ii)  Strengthening of KAJUR\u2019s capacity to manage its water supply assets, which will \noptimize freshwater and saltwater network operations and reduce nonrevenue \nwater. A water distribution specialist will be recruited to provide intermittent on-the-\njob training (6 months over 2 years). \n(iii)  Recruitment of a technical advisor to assist KAJUR\u2019s planning of capital works and \nto further strengthen its project management capacity (4 months of intermittent \ninputs over 2 years). \n(iv)  Extension of the current project\u2019s household fixture program by 12 months, and \nstronger management of water demand through proper maintenance of plumbing \nfixtures  and  prepayment  meters.  This  will  also  ensure  that  Ebeye's  poor \nhouseholds, including 120 households headed by women, can access safe water \nand improved sanitation. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n20.  ADB\u2019s engagement in the Marshall Islands\u2019 water supply and sanitation operations adds \nvalue in several areas, including (i) building on the benefits already delivered by the current \nproject, (ii) bringing in extensive Pacific developing member country experience in water and \nsanitation infrastructure investments and associated TA, (iii) providing best practices for water \nutilities through institutional strengthening and capacity building, (iv) expanding services in low-\nincome and informal areas, and (v) helping the government and KAJUR manage the project's \nenvironmental and social safeguard issues. The project design reflects lessons from the current \nproject and from previous ADB and development partner operations in water supply and sanitation \nin Pacific developing member countries. Key lessons include that (i) building adequate financial \nand technical capacity is essential for the sustainable delivery of water supply and sewerage \nservices, and (ii) urban service demand and willingness to pay must be ensured. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n21.  The overall project is estimated to cost $22.40 million (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates \nby expenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual \n(PAM).11 \n \n22.  The government requested a grant not exceeding $3.00 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the project. The summary financing plan is \nin  Table  2.  ADB  will  finance  the  expenditures  relating  to  the  extension  of  the  operations \ncomponent of the DBM contract, minor works and equipment to upgrade the desalination plant \nbuilding and power supply, procurement of a new freshwater booster pump, strengthening of the \noperational capacity of water supply, and expansion of the household fixture program. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n11 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n  Current  Additional   \nItem  Amounta   Financingb   Total  \nA.

The implementation arrangements are summarized \nin Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM (footnote 11). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  1 November 2020\u201331 December 2023 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2023 \n ", "7 \nAspects  Arrangements \nEstimated grant closing date  30 June 2024 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Project steering committee: \n(i)  chief  secretary  (chair),  (ii)  deputy  chief  secretary,  (iii)  a  senator \nrepresenting Kwajalein, (iv) mayor of Kwajalein, (v) 2 representatives \nfrom Kwajalein Atoll Local Government; (vi) assistant secretary of health, \n(vii) assistant secretary of finance, (viii) assistant secretary of education, \n(ix) 1 representative from the Environment Protection Agency, (x) KAJUR \ngeneral  manager,  and  (xi)  2  representatives  from  Ebeye-based \nnongovernment or civil society organizations \n(ii)  Executing agency  Office of the Chief Secretary \n(iii) Implementing agency  KAJUR \n(iv) Implementation unit  Project management unit, 5 KAJUR staff: \n(i) project manager, (ii) accountant/finance officer, (iii) water supply and \nsewerage manager, (iv) electricity supply manager, and (v) community \nliaison officer \nProcurement  Direct contracting  2 contracts  $2.0 million \nRequest for quotations  2 contracts  $0.3 million \nConsulting services  Single-source selection  22 person-months  $0.3 million \nIndividual consultant  22 person-months  $0.4 million \nselection \nAdvance contracting  Extension of desalination design\u2013build\u2013manage contract (Osmoflo Water \nManagement Pty Limited); procurement of additional electrical switchgear \n(CCB Envico Pty Limited) \nDisbursement  The grant proceeds will be disbursed following ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed \narrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, KAJUR = Kwajalein Atoll Joint Utilities Resources, Inc. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n24.  Since the current project includes cofinancing from the Government of Australia, universal \nprocurement is applied. Universal procurement is also proposed under the additional financing \nbecause that financing will be used to expand the current outputs.12 All procurement of goods and \nworks will be undertaken in accordance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time \nto time). The procurement of goods and works will follow shopping procedures, except for the \nextension of the DBM contract for the desalination plant (output 1) and for the procurement of \nadditional switchgear (output 4), which will follow direct procurement methods. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n25.  Water supply and sewerage infrastructure financed under the current project are delivering \nthe services as envisaged at the project appraisal. But further investments are required to \nstrengthen KAJUR\u2019s capacity to operate the desalination plant in emergency situations and run \nthe water distribution systems effectively, and to improve the security of electricity supply (through \nminor investments) to KAJUR's water and sanitation assets. \n \n \n12 ADB. 2013. Blanket Waiver of Member Country Procurement Eligibility Restrictions in Cases of Cofinancing for \nOperations Financed from Asian Development Fund Resources. Manila. \n ", "8 \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n26.  The economic and financial viability of the project was reassessed with the additional \nfinancing. The overall project\u2019s economic internal rate of return is estimated at 13.4%. Sensitivity \nanalysis was carried out with respect to the key parameters of incremental costs such as \ninvestment, O&M, and incremental benefits, including the following scenarios: (i) a 20% increase \nin investment costs, (ii) a 20% increase in O&M costs, (iii) a 20% decrease in the incremental \nsupply benefits, and (iv) a 2-year delay. Under the most adverse scenario of a 20% decrease in \nbenefits and a 20% increase in total costs, the economic internal rate of return falls to 6.9% but \nis still higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital estimated at of 6.0% for countries in \nfragile and conflict-affected situations, such as the Marshall Islands.13 \n \n27.  The project\u2019s financial internal rate of return is estimated at 1.3%. This result is deemed \nacceptable because revenues are expected to be sufficient to cover routine O&M costs (though \nnot all major maintenance or replacement costs, or depreciation). ADB will provide continuous \nsupport under the project to enhance KAJUR\u2019s financial capacity.14 \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n28.  The additional financing will strengthen KAJUR\u2019s financial management and its capacity \nto effectively operate and maintain its water supply and sewerage assets. KAJUR has developed \na framework to enable the recovery of water and sewerage O&M costs, applicable from 1 October \n2020. A household survey conducted in June 2020 indicates that 78% of households are willing \nto pay for KAJUR water services, with 62% of households willing to pay more than $8 per month. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n29.  The financial management risk of KAJUR is rated high. Since 2008, KAJUR has recorded \noperating losses of $2.0 million or more, mostly because of inadequate tariffs and high fuel costs \nfor its electricity production. In 2018\u20132019, KAJUR recorded a spike in operating losses of about \n$3.5 million. Limited financial reporting, poor record management, and recent changes in senior \nmanagement  also  contributed  to  the  poor  financial  performance.  The  project  incorporates \nmitigating measures. KAJUR will be responsible for maintaining project accounts and preparing \ngrant withdrawal applications. A financial management advisor will be recruited under the project \nto assist KAJUR and to continue building its capacity. Procurement risks are considered low. \n \n30.  Integrity due diligence was conducted and revealed no significant integrity risks.15 ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment  and  the  Office  of  the  Chief  Secretary.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 11). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n31.  Ebeye residents suffer a very high incidence of gastroenteritis and other waterborne \ndiseases. The project impact will be fewer waterborne diseases. A 20% reduction in the incidence \nof such diseases since 2017 can be attributed to better access to safe water and sanitation, and \n \n13 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n15 ADB. 2003.

The additional financing will strengthen the \nsustainability of KAJUR's water and sanitation services and ensure that all households on Ebeye \nhave access to safe water and improved sanitation. The project is classified as effective gender \nmainstreaming. It includes gender design features to ensure women\u2019s participation in the project \nand their access to project benefits including: (i) ensuring 120 households headed by women \nhave access to safe water and improved sanitation, and (ii) establishing links with vocational \ntraining centers to recruit qualified women for employment opportunities in KAJUR. \nF. Safeguards\n32. The safeguard categorizations for the additional financing are environment (B), involuntary\nresettlement (C), and indigenous peoples (C). KAJUR has built up its capacity to effectively meet\nthe project safeguard requirements. The additional financing components are assessed as having\nminimal and only site-specific impacts, and the updated initial environmental examination and the\naccompanying environmental management plan are deemed sufficient to meet the environmental\nsafeguard requirements of ADB and the Marshall Islands. Also, the additional activities will neither\nrequire  additional  land  acquisition  nor  generate  any  involuntary  resettlement  impacts.\nMost activities under the additional financing  serve to strengthen KAJUR's operational and\nfinancial capacity and performance. A grievance redress mechanism was established to uphold\nthe social and environmental safeguard performance by addressing concerns and complaints\npromptly and transparently, with no cost or discrimination impacts on the reporting persons.\nG.
