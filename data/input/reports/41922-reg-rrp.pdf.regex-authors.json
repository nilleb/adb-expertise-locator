I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed equity \ninvestments in five clean energy\u2013focused private equity funds: Asia Clean Energy Fund (up to \n$20 million), China Clean Energy Capital (up to $20 million), China Environment Fund III (up to \n$20 million), GEF South Asia Clean Energy Fund (up to $20 million), and MAP Clean Energy \nFund (up to $20 million). \nII.  RATIONALE: BACKGROUND, CHALLENGES, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Challenges and Opportunities1 \n2.  Rapid Increase in Global Energy Demand. Global energy demand is higher today than \never before and is increasing every year. The base case developed by the International Energy \nAgency projects primary energy demand worldwide in 2030 to be more than 53% higher than \ncurrent demand. More than two thirds of this increase is attributed to developing countries, with \ntheir rapid economic growth and population increase.  \n3.  Developing Asia a Large Part of Energy Demand. Large parts of Asia, in particular, \nare in a sustained period of fast economic growth, driving ever-increasing demand for energy \n(integral to economic growth). New energy infrastructure is being installed at unprecedented \nrates across the region, and energy use is expected to grow faster in Asia than in the rest of the \nworld for the next 2 decades. Indeed, \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d forecasts anticipate energy use in \nAsia  to  increase  89%  between  2006  and  2030,  at  which  point  Asia  (in  particular,  rapidly \ndeveloping economies like the People\u2019s Republic of China [PRC] and India) will be consuming \n30% of the world\u2019s energy. While energy demand will fall from 59% in 2000 to 47% by 2030 \namong Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, it will rise \nfrom 20% to 27% in developing Asia. \n4.  Higher  Greenhouse  Gas  Emissions.  Asian  countries,  as  mentioned  above,  are \ninstalling new energy supply infrastructure at an unprecedented rate. The International Energy \nAgency estimates that energy supply infrastructure in developing Asia will require a staggering \n$6.3 trillion in investments between now and 2030, $3.7 trillion of that amount for the PRC alone. \nThe energy investments are strongly carbon-intensive, with major energy-consuming countries \nshowing a keen preference for coal-fired power generation. More than half of the anticipated \ninvestment of $6.3 trillion is projected to be in electricity generation, primarily from coal-fired \nplants.2 This trend toward coal-fired power generation is contributing significantly to the increase \nin greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Asia. The region\u2019s share of GHG emissions worldwide \nincreased from less than 9% in 1973 to 24% in 2003, and is projected to increase to 29% by \n2030. Developing countries will overtake the OECD countries in GHG emissions by 2010, and \nthe PRC (which surpassed the US as the world\u2019s largest producer of GHG in 2007) will be \nresponsible for 39% of the worldwide increase between 2004 and 2030, according to the \nInternational Energy Agency. \n                                                 \n1 The Challenges and Opportunities section, including much of the wording, draws on a recent report\u2014Carmody, \nJosh, and Duncan Ritchie. 2007. Investing in Clean Energy and Low Carbon Alternatives in Asia. Manila: ADB. The \ndeal team thanks the authors for this excellent report.  \n2 The PRC alone is reportedly adding coal-fired generation capacity at the rate of close to 2,000 megawatts per week. ", "2   \n5.  Global  Climate  Change.  Scientific  evidence  points  to  increasing  risks  of  serious, \nirreversible impact from climate change associated with the anticipated trajectories of GHG \nemissions. The Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \nwarns  with  more  than  90%  certainty  that  human  activity  contributes  to  climate  change: \n\u201cWarming  of  the  climate  system  is  unequivocal,  as  is  now  evident  from  observations  of \nincreases in global air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising \nglobal mean sea level.\u201d3   \n6.  Urgent Action Needed to Mitigate GHG Emissions in Asia. The situation calls for \nimmediate action to mitigate global GHG emissions, including early and decisive action to adopt \nsustainable energy development worldwide. Because of developing Asia\u2019s quickly enlarging role \nin  energy  consumption  and  carbon  dioxide  emissions,  without  increased  and  urgent  GHG \nmitigation  in  Asia,  global  GHG  emissions  cannot  be  reduced  to  a  level  that  will  prevent \ndangerous climate change. Indeed, if the trillions of dollars invested in new energy supply \ninfrastructure in Asia over the next 20 years still go into carbon-intensive supply infrastructure, \nattempts to reduce GHG emissions in more energy-efficient parts of the world, such as Europe, \nare unlikely to make a meaningful dent in total GHG emissions.  Asia must therefore diversify its \nenergy and fuel supply. A substantial proportion of the investment capital flowing into Asian \nenergy supply infrastructure over the next two to three decades must be dedicated to clean \nenergy and low-carbon investment alternatives. \n7.  Recognition  of  Need  for  Urgent  Action  among  ADB\u2019s  Developing  Member \nCountries. Countries across Asia recognize the need for action, and have begun to set targets \nfor reducing their dependence on carbon-intensive forms of energy. The PRC looks forward to \nproducing 10% of its energy from renewable sources by 2010,4 and 16% of primary energy and \n20% of power generation capacity from renewable energy sources by 2020. Energy ministers of \nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have agreed on a 10% target for power \ngeneration from renewable resources by 2010. Renewable energy is foreseen to supply 10% of \nIndia\u2019s energy needs by 2012,5 and 8% of Thailand\u2019s commercial primary energy by 2011.6 \nGovernments are taking action to achieve these targets. In the Philippines, the Government is \noffering geothermal blocks to developers, letting 14 mini-hydro sites, and offering several gas \nand light natural gas blocks for exploration and development. In Viet Nam, independent power \nproducer contracts are being offered for wind sites throughout the country, while in Indonesia, \ninvestment in biofuels and geothermal is increasing in response to government policies that \npromote their development and use. Countries across the region are also working to make their \ninvestment climates friendlier to investors in clean energy projects. Private companies in the \nforefront of the industry, such as Suzlon Energy in India and Suntech Power in the PRC, have \ncapitalized on the new opportunities.  \n8.  Need for Increased Capital Flows into Asian Clean Energy Investments. The urgent \nneed to arrest and, if possible, reverse the upward spiral in GHG emissions in the energy sector \n                                                 \n3  Specific effects in Asia include (i) more frequent and intense typhoons affecting the Pacific as well as East and \nSouth Asia; (ii) more uncertain water supply in key basins such as the Aral Sea, the Indus River, and the Ganges \nRiver because of the retreat of glaciers in the Himalayas plus the greater variability of rainfall; and (iii) more \ndroughts in many parts of the region. \n4  Asia Pacific Development. 2006.

In 2006, global investment in clean \nenergy  reached  $100 billion  (45%  higher  than  in  2005),  with  just  over  $70  billion  in  new \ninvestments, and $30 billion in merger and acquisition and buyout transactions. In addition, the \nglobal carbon market grew to about $30 billion (a 177% increase over 2005). This market is \nanticipated to grow rapidly in coming years: the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) \nforesees a $1.9 trillion global market for clean energy financing and a $2 trillion global market \nfor GHG emission trading by 2020. A mandated clean energy target of 20% for Asian nations by \n2020 would lead to almost $1 trillion in clean energy investment in Asia by 2030, of which \nalmost $50 billion would be required yearly until 2020.7 The business opportunities are thus \nclear. Up to this point, however, most of the capital invested in the clean energy sector has gone \nto OECD markets; Asia has received only a small fraction of the total.  \nB.  Call for Proposals8\n9.  Given the aforementioned imbalance between Asia and the OECD countries in capital \ninvested in clean energy projects, ADB is taking up the challenge of encouraging the growth of \nrisk capital in the Asian clean energy sector by investing equity in several private equity funds, \nwhich will, in turn, invest equity in clean energy projects and companies. Over the last decade, \nprivate equity funds have proliferated across Asia, particularly in bigger markets like the PRC \nand India. In the last year or two, clean energy funds have emerged as a distinct niche in the \nprivate equity industry; indeed, in 2006, ADB received more than 10 clean energy fund concepts \nand proposals from either project developers or fund managers. Most of those potential fund \nmanagers, however, lacked the combination of strong private equity performance and specific \nclean energy expertise needed to receive investment from ADB. For this reason, ADB sought to \nfind truly high-caliber clean energy private equity fund managers in ADB\u2019s developing member \ncountries (DMCs) by issuing a call for proposals (CFP).  \n10.  CFP Concept. The CFP, which was issued to the market in July 2007, stated that ADB \nanticipated financing up to five funds selected through the CFP, and laid out a timetable for the \nselection and approval of these funds. The CFP indicated that ADB would provide a total of up \nto $100 million for investment in the funds, representing less than 25% of the total capital of a \ngiven fund.9 In issuing the CFP, ADB hoped to make both the private equity sector and the \nclean energy sector aware of its commitment to increasing equity funding to clean energy \ninvestments, and to motivate these two sectors to merge their expertise in order to evolve \nbetter-quality fund managers, and catalyze increased equity investment in clean energy projects \nin ADB\u2019s DMCs.  \n11.  Sector and Geographic Focus. The CFP identified a broad range of sectors within \n                                                 \n7  Such targets are not significantly beyond the present agenda in Asia since, as mentioned above in the main text, \nthe PRC has set a target of producing 16% of primary energy and 20% of power generation capacity from \nrenewable sources by 2020, and ASEAN energy ministers have agreed on a 10% target for power generation from \nrenewable sources by 2010. \n8  With financing from the Government of Canada, ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) carried out \na small-scale technical assistance to design a CFP in 2007. See ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance for Establishing \nRenewable Energy, Energy Efficiency, and Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Investment Funds (TA 6384). In the second \nquarter of 2007, PSOD finalized a CFP with general guidelines for investment fund proposals and fund manager \nselection, plus a timeline, aimed at creating more private equity funds for renewable energy, energy efficiency, and \nGHG emission abatement projects. As the CFP process is a new, innovative procedure in ADB, PSOD consulted \nwith relevant departments, particularly the Office of the General Counsel and the Strategy and Policy Department, \nbefore issuing the call. Details on the CFP are available at http://adb.org/Clean-Energy-CFP/proposals.asp. \n9  The balance of each fund\u2019s capital is to be raised from other sponsors and private sector investors. \n ", "4   \nclean energy, including (i) renewable energy,10 (ii) energy efficiency,11 (iii) GHG abatement \nprojects,12  and  (iv)  other  clean  technology.13  The  CFP  had  a  liberal  geographic  focus, \nconsidering funds with both regional and country-specific mandates within ADB\u2019s DMCs. The \npotential clean energy investments range from those in the very early stages of development \n(i.e.,  start-up  or  clean  technology\u2013based  investments)  to  those  in  the  late  stages  (i.e., \ncompanies in the project development phase or before the initial public offering [IPO]). Private \nequity funds can invest at any stage of the clean energy project life cycle. An investment at a \nvery early (concept) stage provides great opportunity for a fund to benefit from the project\u2019s \npotential upside; at the same time, however, the fund takes on virtually all of the risk inherent in \nfunding venture or concept projects. Investing at a later stage, such as during construction, may \nsomewhat reduce the returns of the project but also mitigates at least some of the risks involved \nin getting the project off the ground. At the other end of the spectrum, a fund can invest in an \nexisting late-stage or pre-IPO company, with a significantly lower risk; the fund, however, thus \nforfeits some of the returns that accrue to investors that are willing to absorb the risk of investing \nearlier in the project cycle. The CFP did not categorically specify the stage of the portfolio \ncompany in which the funds would invest, and indeed sought the diversification of risk that funds \nwith different investment strategies would bring to the portfolio. Above all, ADB was looking for: \n(i) fund managers that combined strong private equity performance with clean energy sector \nexpertise; (ii) solid and creative proposals clearly describing the fund manager\u2019s target market, \ninvestment thesis, and investment methods; and (iii) fund concepts that were likely to achieve \nADB\u2019s objective of expanding clean energy investment. \n12.  Fund  and  Fund  Manager  Selection  Criteria.14  In  assessing  the  proposals,  ADB \nconsidered a range of standard criteria for evaluating private equity funds, as well as criteria \nspecific  to  the  clean  energy  sector,  including:  (i)  the  credibility  and  thoughtfulness  of  the \nproposal and the fund manager\u2019s investment strategy; (ii) the fund manager\u2019s target market(s), \ninvestment thesis, and marketing and project sourcing strategy; (iii) the track record of the \nprospective fund manager in making, reaping value from, and exiting from equity investments \n(in emerging markets, Asia, clean energy, etc.); (iv) the experience, depth, credibility, and team \ncohesiveness of the fund manager, as well as its competitive positioning relative to other funds; \n(v) the fund manager\u2019s experience as a fiduciary vis-\u00e0-vis fund reporting and administration; and \n(vi)  the  degree  to  which  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  proposed  fund  matched  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements.  \n13.  CFP  Selection  Process  and  Timetable.  The  CFP  was  issued  to  the  market  on \n13 July 2007,  and  proposals  were  received  until  13  September  2007.  The  proposals  were \nevaluated with the help of an external consultant, and short-listed funds were invited to Manila \nfor initial interviews, which took place in October 2007. These half-day interviews were attended \nby representatives of ADB\u2019s Capital Markets and Financial Sectors Division (PSCM) of the \nPrivate  Sector  Operations  Department  (PSOD);  the  Energy,  Transport  and  Water  Division \n(RSID) of the Regional and Sustainable Development Department; the Office of the General \nCounsel; the Office of Cofinancing Operations; the Economics and Research Department; and \n                                                 \n10 I.e., wind, solar thermal, solar photovoltaic, geothermal, biomass (wood, agricultural waste, municipal waste), \nbiofuels (ethanol and biodiesel), biogas, tidal, and small hydro. \n11 Power plant optimization, power transmission and distribution system upgrades, cogeneration systems, waste heat \nrecovery power generation, and a range of efficient end-use technologies (e.g., motors, lighting, boilers, controls, \nindustrial process equipment, pumping systems, compressors, heating and air conditioning, and other equipment).  \n12 Such as landfill gas, coal mine methane, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, and nitrogen dioxide recovery projects. \n13 Integrated gasification combined cycle and supercritical boiler systems.  \n14 More information in detail is on ADB\u2019s CFP web page: http://adb.org/Clean-Energy-CFP/ ", "    5\nregional  departments.15  After  these  interviews,  RSID  and  the  Economics  and  Research \nDepartment gave their evaluation and feedback on each fund from a technical perspective; with \nthese assessments, as well as those of the project team and the consultant, the team selected a \nnumber of funds for full due diligence. Due diligence on the funds took place in November and \nDecember 2007. Five funds presented truly compelling stories and met ADB\u2019s assessment \ncriteria, and are proposed in this report for investment.      \nC.  Development Impact and ADB Value Addition \n1.  Development Impact \n14.  ADB\u2019s investments in the funds will have the following development impact: \n(i)  The investments will facilitate significant development in different subsectors of \nclean energy (such as small hydro,16 solar, wind, biofuels, biomass, geothermal, \nclean technology, and energy savings and efficiency), and thus reduce GHG \nemission and mitigate climate change.  \n(ii)  The investments support the promotion of environmentally friendly, sustainable \neconomic growth in ADB\u2019s DMCs.  \n(iii)  The  CFP  affirmed  the  credibility  and  potential  of  private equity  in  the  clean \nenergy sector. ADB\u2019s investment in the selected clean energy funds will help to \ndevelop the asset class and, by demonstrating the potential of private equity in \nclean  energy,  will  attract  more  firms  into  the  sustainable  energy  market, \ndeepening the penetration and viability of this specialized asset class.  \n(iv)  The investments will help to develop a class of fund managers and financial \nprofessionals in the sustainable energy sectors in the region. ADB\u2019s support of \nlocal players helps the private equity industry to grow and carry on in the target \nsector in the region.  \n(v)  The money invested by the funds is to be used not only for the growth and \nexpansion of portfolio companies but also for greenfield projects, thus developing \nindividual companies in the private sector, creating jobs, increasing local tax \nrevenue, and contributing to sustainable employment in the region. \n(vi)  The funds will provide management advice to companies in financial planning, \nproject  development,  business  expansion  strategies,  human  resource \ndevelopment, technology, environmental and social issues, and international best \npractices  in  corporate  governance,  thus  raising  the  quality  of  individual \ncompanies.           \n2.  Value Added by ADB \n15.  Catalytic Effect. First of all, of the five funds proposed for investment in this report, four \nare (to some degree) first-time fund managers in the clean energy sector in ADB\u2019s DMCs. \nADB\u2019s investment will be extremely helpful to the funds in further fundraising. Indeed, ADB\u2019s \ndemonstrated interest has already catalyzed interest from other investors. Second, with ADB\u2019s \ninvestment, the funds will be eligible for financing from the Asia Pacific Carbon Fund, CEFPF, \n                                                 \n15 All of these ADB departments, as well as the Risk Management Unit, were invited to the initial interviews. Those of \ntheir staff who were interested and were available attended.  \n16 \u201cSmall hydro\u201d projects are projects that meet the small hydro eligibility criteria of ADB\u2019s CEFPF. \n ", "6   \nand the Seed Capital Assistance Facility (SCAF), which will assist the funds in developing their \nunderlying assets. Without ADB\u2019s investment, the funds will not have such access.  \n16.  Demonstration  Effect.  Besides  helping  to  launch  the  funds,  ADB  anticipates  that \nsuccess on the part of these funds will help to demonstrate the credibility of private equity in the \nemerging clean energy sector in its DMCs, and mobilize capital to support other private equity \nfunds in the target sector. The CFP effort can be replicated and expanded elsewhere in the \nregion  in  succeeding  years;  indeed,  ADB  has  had  conversations  with  other  multilateral \ninstitutions that plan to run their own CFPs in clean energy investment. Additionally, ADB has \nreceived  proposals  from  other  clean  energy  funds  and  clean  energy  financing  companies \ninterested in leveraging ADB\u2019s resources beyond the CFP.  \n17.  Management Support and Professionalization. ADB (both PSCM and RSID staff) will \nadd value to the funds by assisting them in gaining access to the Asia Pacific Carbon Fund, \nCEFPF, and SCAF. ADB will also take a seat on the funds\u2019 advisory boards, and will thus have \na say in fund corporate governance. In the case of somewhat more experienced fund managers, \nADB\u2019s value addition will take the form of helping the fund expand its investment platform and \nfurther professionalize (e.g., meet more rigorous standards of administration, reporting, and \ninvestor relations).   \n18.  Environmental and Social Awareness. Fund managers and other investors appreciate \nADB\u2019s strong attention to environmental and social safeguards and to corporate governance. \nADB\u2019s involvement in environmental, social, and governance issues reduces the risk to the \nfunds\u2019 reputation and creates confidence in locally managed funds.  \n3.  Development Outcome \n19.  ADB will measure the expected development outcome of the proposed investments in \naccordance with the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1).  \nIII.  THE FUNDS  \nA.  Asia Clean Energy Fund (ACE) / Korea Technology Investment Corporation (KTIC) \nand KPMG Samjong Investment Advisory (KPMG/SIA) \n20.       The ACE concept was developed by Kee-Doo Hong, vice chairman until recently of \nKPMG Korea, whose professional career and pursuits in the clean energy sector motivated him \nto create a partnership between the fund\u2019s two sponsors, KTIC and KPMG/SIA. KTIC is a \nwell-known Korean technology venture capital firm, and has over two decades of experience \ninvesting in technology-based projects and companies in the Republic of Korea. It has invested \n$1 billion in more than 520 portfolio companies, has $486 million under management, and has \nrun 19 venture capital funds and nine corporate restructuring funds. KPMG Korea is part of the \nglobal KPMG Group, and SIA provides investment and financial advisory services to numerous \nKorean corporate clients and institutional investors for domestic as well as global projects. SIA \nspecializes  in  advising  on  cross-border  transactions  and  corporate  finance  overseas,  and \nmaintains deal sourcing offices in Central Asia, the PRC, India, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Laos, and \nthe rest of Southeast Asia. With a target size of $200 million, ACE will invest in clean technology, \nrenewable energy, and energy efficiency investments throughout Asia.  ", "    7\nB.  China Clean Energy Capital (CCEC) / CCEC Partners \n21.  Although it is a first-time fund, CCEC has spent substantial time positioning itself to \nsucceed in the PRC market. It is one of only two local clean energy\u2013focused fund managers in \nthe  domestic  market.  The  CCEC  team  primarily  comprises  multilingual,  multicultural  PRC \nnationals; the team members have decades of local and international senior management \nexperience in energy project development, engineering, finance, banking, and operations, with \nsuch organizations as Veolia Environmental Services, Veolia Energy, China National Offshore \nOil Corporation, the Development Research Center of the State Council of the PRC, CIBC \nWorld Markets, and Viventures. With a target size of $100 million\u2013$150 million, CCEC will invest \nin renewable energy projects/technologies, energy savings/energy efficiency, and other clean \nenergy technologies in the PRC. \nC.  China Environment Fund III (CEF III) / Tsing Capital \n21.  Having raised its first clean energy fund 7 years ago, Tsing Capital was the industry \npioneer in the PRC, and is now a dominant clean energy investor in the country. Tsing Capital \nmanages two previously small clean energy funds, which have collectively invested in nine \ncompanies,  across  industries  such  as  wastewater  treatment,  energy  efficiency,  solar \nphotovoltaic cells and wafers, and solid waste recycling. Over its 7-year history, Tsing Capital, \nas a leader in clean energy investment in the PRC, has built up an impressive reputation in the \nindustry and an extensive network of contacts in business, central and provincial government, \nthe Ministry of Science, and Tsinghua University. CEF III is run by an experienced team with a \nbackground in technology investment and operations in the PRC and abroad. With a target size \nof $200 million\u2013$250 million, CEF III will invest in a portfolio of companies working to improve \nthe global environment by reducing, reusing, and recycling natural resources in the PRC.  \nD.  GEF South Asia Clean Energy Fund (GEF-SA) / Global Environment Fund (GEF) \n22.  GEF-SA is sponsored by GEF Management Corporation (GEF), a globally recognized \nclean energy investor, and YES Bank, a well-respected and fast-growing local Indian bank.

INVESTMENT BENEFITS, IMPACT, AND RISKS \nA.  Social and Environmental Safeguard Policies \n24.  ADB\u2019s investments in the funds are classified as category FI (financial intermediary) \nunder ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). The fund manager of each fund will be required to \nadopt an environmental management system. ADB\u2019s investments in the funds are classified as \ncategory B/C under ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and Policy on Indigenous \nPeoples (1998). None of the funds\u2019 investments are foreseen to lead to involuntary settlement. \nBut the funds will adopt a resettlement framework that defines the policies, procedures, roles, \nand responsibilities of the funds for screening and managing any involuntary resettlement by \nportfolio companies. Likewise, no investments by the funds are expected to affect indigenous \npeoples. The funds will not invest in activities falling within ADB\u2019s list of exclusions. \nB.  Anticorruption Policy, and Policy of Combating Money Laundering and Financing \nof Terrorism \n25.  The fund managers were advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) and the Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism Policy (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire the fund managers to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and \ncontrols that conform to international best practice standards to prevent corruption or money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. The investment documentation between ADB and the funds will \nallow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings.  \nC.  Exposure Limits and Waiver  \nV.  ASSURANCES \n26.  Following the approval of the proposed investments by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors, ADB \nwill enter into suitable investment documentation, and ensure that such documentation and \nother  principal  agreements  relating  to  each  fund  (including  the  management  agreement \nbetween the fund and the fund manager) will be on terms and conditions acceptable to ADB and \nare consistent with all relevant ADB policies. \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n27.  I am satisfied that the proposed equity investments in the funds would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the equity investments of up to $20,000,000 in each of the following funds (with a total \naggregate investment of up to $100,000,000): (i) Asia Clean Energy Fund, (ii) China Clean ", "    9\nEnergy Capital, (iii) China Environment Fund III, (iv) GEF South Asia Clean Energy Fund, and \n(v)  MAP  Clean  Energy  Fund,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  and  on  terms  and \nconditions as are
