The program \ncontinues efforts of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support the Government of Solomon \nIslands  in  implementing  an  ongoing  reform  program  in  coordination  with  other  development \npartners.  The  proposed  program  will  support  continued  policy  attention  to  reform,  which  has \nbecome  increasingly  essential  following  recent  natural  disasters,  the  closure  of  a  large  gold \nmine (an important source of government revenue), and the decline of logging output over the \nmedium term. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nSolomon Islands is one of the largest countries in Melanesia, with a land area of about \n28,000 square kilometers, comprising six large islands, dozens of smaller islands, and hundreds \nof  islets  and atolls.  About  85%  of the  population of  600,000 is  rural,  living  in widely  dispersed \nvillages  comprising  a  few  hundred  persons  each.  The  economy  is  based  on  primary \ncommodities from agriculture, forestry, and fishing; alternative income-generating opportunities \nare  scarce,  especially  in  rural  areas.  The  nation  has  been  steadily  recovering from  the  1999\u2013\n2003  civil  conflict.  While  the  security  situation  is  now  stable,  recent  events\u2014such  as  the  May \n2014  riots  and  looting  in  the  capital,  Honiara,  and  other  parts  of  Guadalcanal\u2014have \ndemonstrated the stability\u2019s fragile nature. \n \n4. \nCreating  an  environment  in  Solomon  Islands  that  fosters  sustainable  economic  growth \nremains  a  challenge.  The  country  continues  to  exhibit  characteristics  of  a  fragile  state.  State \nstructures  lack  the  capacity  to  provide  many  of  the  basic  functions  for  poverty  reduction,  the \nlegitimacy of the government has at times been weak, and public service delivery and economic \nmanagement  needs  strengthening.  Remoteness  is  a  particular  challenge.  Most  people  live far \nfrom  major  markets,  internal  dispersion  is  high,  transport  infrastructure  is  weak  (although \nsteadily  improving),  transport  costs  are  high,  and  transport  services  irregular.  Creating  an \nenabling  environment  for  private  sector-led  growth,  as  well  as  enabling  alternative  drivers  of \neconomic growth, are critical for expanding the current narrow economic base. ADB assistance \nin transport  infrastructure and related  capacity  building  is  essential  in  revitalizing  the  economy \nand  providing  access  to  basic  services.  Support  for  selected  projects  in  the  energy  sector, \ncomplementing  the  efforts  of  other  development  partners,  is  also  essential  to  sustainable \neconomic growth. \n \n5. \nSolomon  Islands  was  adversely  affected  by  major  natural  disasters  in  2014  and  2015. \nThe  April  2014  floods  caused  per  capita  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  to  fall  by  2.4%.  Gold \nproduction  ceased,  and  damage  to  businesses,  houses,  and  public  infrastructure  was \nwidespread.  Private  enterprises  and  public  services  were  heavily  affected.  Damage  was \ncentered  in  and  around  Honiara,  where  dozens  of  people  were  killed,  more  than  10,000  were \ndisplaced,  and  52,000  were  otherwise  affected.  The  government  estimated  flooding  damage \nand losses  at  $108  million,  or  9%  of GDP. In March  2015,  Cyclone Pam  hit  Solomon Islands, \nheavily damaging the easternmost province, Temotu. \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nGold  output  fell  by  more  than  70%  in  2014  because  flooding  halted  production  at  the \n6. \ncountry\u2019s only mine, where operations are likely to remain suspended for some time.  Flooding \nalso damaged transport links and disrupted log exports. Logging output has essentially been flat \nsince  2012,  with  production  sustained  by  secondary  harvests  in  previously  logged  areas. \nLogging output is expected to begin to decline over the next few years as forest area dwindles. \n \n7. \nIn November 2015, the government made a small downward revision in its forecast GDP \ngrowth rate for fiscal year 2015 from 3.50% to 3.25% (ADB\u2019s projected growth rate for 2015 is \n3.22%). The revised growth rate is due to weaker than expected output in the formal fishing and \nagriculture sectors, and slightly weaker than expected activity in the retail and wholesale trade \nsector.  Weak  global  economic  activity  has  contributed  to  lower  commodity  prices,  resulting  in \nlower copra and cocoa production. \n \n8. \nMacroeconomic  policy  is  expected  to  remain  expansionary  through  to  2017.  After \ncoming  to  power  late  in  2014,  the  government  used  its  first  budget  to  signal  a  shift  toward \nexpansionary  fiscal  policy  after  years  of  budget  surpluses.  Despite  its  late  approval,  the  2015 \nbudget  resulted  in  a  deficit  estimated  to  equal  2.2%  of  GDP,  financed  by  drawing  down  on \ngovernment cash reserves. In 2016, the government is targeting a fiscal deficit equal to 5.8% of \nGDP. Similar to 2015, weak execution means the actual deficit is likely to be smaller, estimated \nby ADB at 3.6% of GDP. Selected economic indicators are in Table 1. \n \n\nTable 1: Economic Indicators, 2014\u20132017 \n\n2014 \n\n2.0 \n5.2 \n2.0 \n10.4 \n1,038.6 \n\n2016 (p) \n3.0 \n4.4 \n(3.6) \n8.4 \n1,066.4 \n\n2017 (p) \n2.8 \n5.7 \n(3.9) \n9.4 \n1,141.0 \n\n2015 (e) \n3.2 \n          (0.3) \n(2.2) \n9.8 \n1,016.2 \n\nItem \nGDP growth (%, constant prices) \nInflation (annual % change) \nOverall budget surplus (deficit) (% of GDP) \nExternal debt (% of GDP) \nNominal GDP ($ million, current prices) \n\u2026 = data not available, ( ) = negative, (e) = estimate, GDP = gross domestic product, (p) = projection. \nSources:  Asian  Development  Outlook  database,  Central  Bank  of  Solomon  Islands;  International  Monetary  Fund \nArticle IV Consultation Staff Reports (various years), and Solomon Islands National Statistics Office. \n \n9. \nIn March 2009, the government established a core economic working group (CEWG) to \nprovide a forum to discuss economic and financial reform priorities, monitor their implementation, \ncoordinate government and development partner support around these priorities, and undertake \nprogram  monitoring  to  evaluate  reform  and  assess  impact.2 Since  the  establishment  of  the \nCEWG,  development  partners  have  provided  technical  and  financial  support  that  has \nin  strengthening  budget \ncontributed  effectively \npreparation and planning systems, improving the quality of financial management systems, and \nimproving the environment for private sector investment. \n \nThe  program  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan  and  country \n10. \npartnership strategy (CPS) for Solomon Islands.3 The Solomon Islands CPS focuses assistance \non creating a more diversified and productive economy. In line with this strategy, ADB supports \nthe  government\u2019s  national  development  strategy  (NDS)  for  2011\u20132020  through  assistance  in \nfour  sectors:  energy,  information  and  communication  technology,  public  sector  management, \n\nto  steady  reform  progress,  particularly \n\n                                                \n2  The CEWG comprises  officials from  the Central Bank of Solomon Islands, the Ministry of Development Planning \nand  Aid  Coordination,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Treasury,  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister,  and  development \npartner representatives from ADB, Australia, the European Union, New Zealand, the Regional Assistance Mission \nto Solomon Islands, and the World Bank. \n\n3  ADB.  2015.

The CPS \ncalls for ADB support via the CEWG mechanism, in coordination with development partners, for \ngovernment-led public sector management reforms through policy-based program grants every \nother year. This program follows earlier ADB programs approved in 2010, 2011, and 2013.5 \n \n11. \nADB\u2019s  2013  program  focused  on  (i)  better  public  finance  management,  (ii) greater \neconomic  efficiency  for  a  business  enabling  environment,  and  (iii)  broader  access  to  social \nservices.  The  program  was  rated  successful  overall.6 Together  with  contributions  from  other \ndevelopment  partners,  the  program  grant  of  $5  million  helped  close  the  $9 million  recurrent \nfinancing  gap  in  the  2013  budget.  The  final  budget  outcome  reported  a  fiscal  surplus  of \nSI$181.6 million ($22.99 million), against a revised deficit of SI$259.2 million ($32.81 million).7 \n \n12. \nGeneral  elections  were held in Solomon Islands  on  19  November  2014.  Subsequently, \nthe  Democratic  Coalition  for  Change  government  was  formed.  Progress  on  moving  forward  a \nprogram of economic and financial reform initially slowed because of the elections and change \nof government. This program is being used as a basis to reengage with the new government as \nits  policy  agenda  continues  to  evolve.  The  first  CEWG  meeting,  following  the  formation  of  the \nnew  government,  was  held  on  17  March  2015.  In  September  2015,  technical  working  group \nmeetings resumed, and a CEWG meeting was held on 30 September 2015. \n \n13. \nIncluding  the  proposed  budget  support  from  ADB,  the  government  is  anticipating \nSI$709.1 million in budget support in 2016, primarily comprising sector budget support from the \ngovernments of Australia and New Zealand. The European Union is the other main provider of \nsector  budget  support.  For  2014\u20132020,  under  the  11th  European  Development  Fund,  it  will \nfocus  on  the  water  and  sanitation  sector  and  on  rural  development.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  most \nrecent budget support program was processed in 2014 and is equivalent to $5 million.8 \n \nADB proposes a stand-alone, policy-based operation that will require all policy actions to \n14. \nbe  accomplished  in  advance  of  grant  effectiveness.  Post  program  policy  actions  are  identified \nfor  ongoing  monitoring  subsequent \nto  grant  effectiveness.  The  program  supports \nimplementation of policies agreed with the government. Policy dialogue with the government on \nthe  program  includes  (i)  discussions  on  the  design  and  implementation  of  the  program  policy \nmatrix,  (ii) CEWG  meetings,  and  (iii)  joint  review  missions  (JRMs)  with  government  and \ndevelopment  partner  representatives  assessing  program  performance  and  identifying  lessons \nimplementation. 9  Earlier  budget  support  programs  by  ADB\u2014and  other \nfrom  program \ndevelopment partners\u2014focused primarily on monetary and fiscal stability and strengthening the \ninstitutional framework for public expenditure and financial management. This program builds on \nthose earlier reforms, but broadens the policy actions to address the key challenges of ensuring \n\n                                                \n4  Government  of  Solomon  Islands,  Ministry  of  Development  Planning  and  Aid  Coordination.  2011.

This  program  complements  operations  under  implementation,  or  being \nprocessed, in education, energy, and transport. \n \nB. \n\nImpacts and Outcome \n\nThe impacts will be (i) to provide an enabling environment to stimulate economic growth, \n16. \nespecially  in  rural  areas,  and  (ii)  to  pursue  public  sector  reforms  and  commit  resources  to \nenable  private  sector-led  growth.11 The  outcome  will  be  a  strengthened  economic  and  fiscal \nposition to deliver improved opportunities and living standards. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n17. \nThe outcome will be achieved through three outputs: (i) improving public service delivery \nand economic management, (ii) creating an enabling environment for private sector-led growth, \nand (iii) enabling the drivers of economic growth (paras. 19\u201331). The policy matrix, with policy \nactions all completed, is in Appendix 4.12 \n \nThe  policy  reform  actions  in  outputs  1  and  2  build  on  progress  achieved  since  CEWG \n18. \nestablishment in 2009. Reform actions in output 3 follow from the recommendations of the 2014 \nJRM  and  reflect  the  CEWG\u2019s  refocus  on  the  drivers  of  economic  growth.  More  broadly,  these \nthree  outputs  support  the  wider  objectives  articulated  in  the  government\u2019s  policy  documents \n(footnote 11) and the NDS (footnote 4). \n \n\n1. \n\nOutput 1: Improving Public Service Delivery and Economic Management \n\nPublic sector expenditure amounts to about half the formal economic activity in Solomon \n19. \nIslands.  Improving  public  spending  quality  has  been  a  primary  focus  of  the  CEWG  since  its \ninception,  and  a  feature  of  prior  budget  support  programs.  Improving  public  service \neffectiveness  and  efficiency  will  likely  have  a  positive  impact  on  Solomon Islanders\u2019  economic \ninclusion  and  well-being.  In  response  to  downward  pressure  on  revenue  mobilization  from \ndecreasing mining and logging activity and to spending needs for post-disaster reconstruction, \nthe  program  will  support  new  customs  and  excise  legislation,  and  improvements  in  public \n\n                                                \n10 ADB,  Australian  Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  Trade,  New  Zealand  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  Trade, \nPacific  Financial  Technical  Assistance  Centre,  and  the  World  Bank.

Along  with  a \nrevised NDS that prioritizes public spending for 2016\u20132036, this is expected to make the fiscal \nframework more sustainable. \n \nStrengthening customs administration and revenue collection. Customs and excise \n20. \ncomprise about one-third of total government revenue. A comprehensive review of the customs \nregulatory  regime  undertaken  in  2012  concluded  that  the  Customs  and  Excise  Act,  1960  was \nunsuited  to  modern  international  trade.  The  review  identified  a  number  of  improvements, \nincluding  duty  and  excise  assessment  and  collection,  advanced  reporting  of  arrivals,  customs \npowers,  and  customs  decisions.  A  draft  Customs  and  Excise  Bill  to  address  these  and  other \nissues  is  in  its  final  version.  Under  the  program,  Cabinet  approved  the  draft  legislation  for \nsending to the Attorney General\u2019s Chambers for review, with the legislation now moving through \nthe review and approval stages, prior to consideration by Parliament. \n \n21. \nSupporting improvements in public financial management. An assessment of public \nexpenditure  and financial  accountability  (PEFA)  in Solomon  Islands in  2012  showed  that  most \nareas  of  PFM  had  improved  since  the  first  assessment  in  2008. 13  The  Public  Financial \nManagement  Act,  2013  and  the  PEFA  assessments  have  provided  the  government  with  a \nplatform and the authority to introduce incremental reforms to build a credible and robust PFM \nsystem.  Under  the  program,  Cabinet  approved  the  PFM  road  map,  with  implementation  of \nselected actions now underway. The priorities in the roadmap focus on (i) implementation of the \nPublic  Financial  Management  Act;  (ii)  development  of  PFM  systems;  (iii)  compliance  with \ncontrols on budget, expenditure, and debt; and (iv) strengthening revenue collection.14 \n \nStrengthening  national  development  planning.  The  new  government  has  begun  a \n22. \nrevision  of  the  existing  NDS  to  cover  2016\u20132036  to  provide  a  longer-term  framework  that  will \nallow  greater  stability  and  continuity  in  planning.  The  proposed  NDS  establishes  a  vision  and \nbroad  strategic  framework  centered  around  five  long-term  objectives,  with  specific  targets  for \nyears 10, 15, and 20. The revision will also enable the government to incorporate a linkage to \nthe  Sustainable  Development  Goals,  and  strengthen  performance  targets  and  monitoring \nindicators.  Under  the  program,  Cabinet  approved  the  new  framework  for  the  NDS,  and  is \nworking toward final approval of the new NDS later in 2016. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutput 2: Creating an Enabling Environment for Private Sector-Led Growth \n\n23. \nThe government has introduced a number of important structural reforms to improve the \nenabling  environment  for  private  sector-led  growth.  These  include  reforms  that  have  made  it \neasier  to  start  a  business,  improve  the  performance  of  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs),  and \nincrease the  access  to  and  affordability  of  telecommunications services.  However,  much  more \nneeds  to  be  done  to  improve  the  quality  of  the  country\u2019s  investment  climate.  Regulatory \ninefficiencies  can  be  a  major  constraint  to  economic  growth  and  development.  Reforms  that \nincrease  the  security  of  land  tenure,  improve  access  to  finance,  and  strengthen  the  business \nenvironment  could  significantly  enhance  inclusive  economic  growth.  The  program  addresses \nthis  by  (i) improving  the  governance  of  alienated  land  through  a  new  land  board;  (ii)  initiating \n\n                                                \n13 ECORYS  Nederland  BV.  2008.

Technical Assistance to Solomon Islands for \nStrengthening  the  Implementation  of  the  National  Development  Strategy.  Manila,  will  focus  on  strengthening  the \npreparation of the development budget and supporting multiyear budget projections, including the preparation of a \nmedium-term fiscal framework. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\freforms  to  strengthen the  competition  policy,  credit  unions,  and the  capital  structure  of  SOEs; \nand (iii) introducing legislation to facilitate new business registration. \n \n24. \nImproving  the  governance  of  alienated  land.  The  main  objective  of  the  Lands  and \nTitles (Amendment) Act, 2014 was to increase transparency and openness in the land allocation \nprocess  and  to  provide  and  improve  an  administrative  system  to  strengthen  customer  service \nand set the platforms for a justifiable and equitable land allocation system. To achieve this, the \nact established a land board composed of 13 members who will take on the powers (previously \nundertaken  by  the  Commissioner  of  Lands)  to  deal  with  interests  in  land  and  deliberate  on \napplications  for  land  allocation  and  related  issues.  This  allows  staff  in  the  Ministry  of  Lands, \nHousing and Survey to focus on administrative matters. The transfer of responsibilities to a land \nboard is also expected to provide greater certainty to the private sector. Under the program, the \nland board was established, and transparency of land transactions is being improved. \n  \n25. \nStrengthening  of  credit  unions  policy.  Credit  unions  play  an  important  role  in  the \nfinancial services sector in Solomon Islands.15 The legislation\u2014the Credit Unions Act, 1986\u2014its \nregulations, and the standard credit union bylaws are outdated and no longer encompass best \npractice  for  the  regulation  and  supervision  of  credit  unions.  Certain  legislative  provisions  limit \nthe growth of credit unions and do not provide sufficiently for the protection of member deposits. \nA  credit  unions  policy  taskforce  was  established  to  finalize  a  credit  unions  policy  seeking  to \naddress  these  issues.  The  program  supported  the  approval  by  Cabinet  of  this  policy,  and  will \nnow support the drafting of a new Credit Union Bill and regulations, which will provide the legal \nunderpinning for the central bank to register, license, regulate, and supervise credit unions. An \nupdated regulatory framework would help put the industry on a sound footing from where it can \ngrow sustainably. A growing credit union industry would contribute to the government\u2019s agenda \nof increasing access to financial services and promoting financial sector development. \n \n26. \nDeveloping  competition  policy.  The  country  lacks  a  formal  competition  policy  or \ngenerally applicable competition law. Competition policy has an important role to play in private \nsector  growth  in  Solomon  Islands.  Legislation  in  place  enables  the  government  to  set  price \ncontrols,  protect  industries,  and  restrict  foreign  investment  into  the  country\u2014all  of  which  are \ninconsistent with competition and might impose significant costs. Careful scrutiny is required to \ndetermine whether such measures are economically and socially justified and provide effective \nsolutions to the problems they are intended to address.  Under the program, Cabinet approved \nthe  initial  competition  policy  work,  and  the  program  will  now  support  the  government  to  move \nahead with a competition policy that will examine (i) pro-competitive regulation of public utilities, \n(ii) possible  new  laws  against  anticompetitive  conduct  in  business,  (iii)  possible  updates  to \nexisting consumer protection laws, (iv) effective enforcement of consumer protection laws, and \n(v) the promotion of competitive neutrality and a \u201clevel playing field\u201d for public and private sector \nenterprises in Solomon Islands. \n \n27. \nImproving  the  capital  structure  of  state-owned  enterprises.  The  Solomon  Islands \nSOE portfolio has undergone a dramatic turnaround since 2008 and is now the most profitable \nportfolio in the Pacific in the benchmarking sample in ADB\u2019s assessment. The average return on \nequity  of  the  portfolio  increased  from  \u201312%  in  2002\u20132008  to  6%  for  2009\u20132012  and  15%  in \n2012.16 Cabinet endorsement was given to the development of an SOE capital structure policy \n                                                \n15 Credit  unions  are  financial  cooperative  organizations,  owned  and  controlled  by  their  members.  Their  central \npurpose  is  to  provide  savings,  credit,  and  other  financial  services  to  their  members.  As  of  December  2013,  the \n10 credit unions in Solomon Islands had a total membership of about 5,700 and total assets of SI$50.6 million. \n16 ADB.  2014.

The policy, now \nunder preparation, will include (i) a clear mechanism for the provision of additional equity by the \ngovernment and, conversely, the return of equity to the government by SOEs; (ii) the minimum \nrequired return on the shareholder equity or assets and dividend distribution arrangements; (iii) \nguidance  on  the  level  and  mix  of  capital  used  to  fund  the  projected  capital  expenditure \nrequirements of SOEs; and (iv) flexibility for SOEs to be able to find appropriated value-adding \ninvestment  opportunities  and  flexibility  for  SOE  capital  requirements  to  be  considered  in  the \ncontext of broader government budgetary and policy requirements. \n \n28. \nIslands  has \nundertaken extensive business law reform activity, including the passing of the Companies Act, \n2010,  and  the  launch  of  an  online  company  registry,  Company  Haus.  Building  on  earlier \nprograms, this program continued to support business law reform activity in relation to business \nnames, including enacting legislation and now preparation of associated regulations. Company \nHaus  will  also  upgrade  its  paper-based  business  names  registry  to  an  electronic  registry.  The \nability  to  register  a  business  name  provides  opportunities  for  sole  traders,  partnerships,  and \ncompanies to operate a business under a name other than their actual name. This has a range \nof benefits, including an encouraging environment for businesses to enter the formal economy, \nimproved fraud detection, protection of a business\u2019s goodwill, and greater tax compliance. \n \n\nImproving  business  formalization.  The  Government  of  Solomon \n\n3. \n\nOutput 3: Enabling the Drivers of Economic Growth \n\n29. \nAlthough Solomon Islands\u2019 geographical isolation limits medium-term growth prospects, \nopportunities  exist  for  increasing  the  revenue  base.  As  logging  activity  starts  to  taper  when \nstocks  are  exhausted,  the  development  and  management  of  alternative  natural  resources  has \nbecome  a  strategic  government  priority.  Mining,  fisheries,  and  tourism  offer  potential \nopportunities,  but  significant  institutional  reforms  and  technical  assistance  are  needed  to \nstrengthen the sectors\u2019 regulation and management.17 The program contributes to these critical \nreforms  by  strengthening  fisheries\u2019  governance  and  management  through  new  legislation  and \nby developing a new tourism strategy to attract overseas visits, including from cruise ships. This \nwill help to harness the growth potential in these sectors.  \n \n30. \nStrengthening  fisheries  management.  Solomon  Islands  has  a  significant  tuna \nresource,  which  could  deliver  significantly  greater  economic  benefits  to  the  country  if  it  were \nmore  effectively  utilized.  Under  the  program,  new  fisheries  legislation  was  enacted,  with \nimplementation  of  the  legislation  now  being  supported,  including  the  development  of \naccompanying regulations. The new act makes a provision for the conservation, management, \ndevelopment,  and  sustainable  use  of  fisheries  and  marine  resources  in  Solomon  Islands,  as \nwell  as  strengthening  the  monitoring  and  control  of  fishing  vessels.  The  act  provides  for  the \nestablishment of a Fisheries Licensing Committee, Fisheries Appeals Committee, and Fisheries \nAdvisory  Council;  as  well  as  the  establishment  of  fisheries  management  plans  at  national, \nprovincial,  and  community  levels.  The  act  will  mean  that  Solomon  Islands  fisheries  resources \nwill be used more sustainably, balancing economic growth with sound ecological principles. \n \n31. \nDeveloping  tourism  potential.  Solomon  Islands\u2019  tourism  is  widely  viewed  as  having \nsignificant  potential,  but  remains  largely  untapped.  In  2014,  about  6,000  tourists  visited  the \ncountry,  compared  with  110,000 in  Vanuatu that  year.  Few  visitors  venture outside  of  Honiara \n\n                                                \n17 ADB. 2016.

The  Solomon  Islands  National  Tourism  Development  Strategy,  2015\u20132019, \nnow approved under program, is designed to identify and address sector-related impediments to \nfacilitate faster  economic growth and increased benefits from tourism,  including  in rural  areas. \nThe focus of the strategy is on small-scale tourism, based on niche markets. Cruise ships also \nprovide a key development opportunity for the sector; the Solomon Islands receives a small but \ngrowing  number  of  visitors  from  this  market  and  the  strategy  highlights  key  constraints  and \nrecommended actions to increase the level of tourists. With support from development partners, \nimplementation on the strategy is now underway. \n \nD. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\n32. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  grant  not  exceeding  $5  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds  resources  to  help  finance  the  program. 18  The  proposed  grant  size  is  within  the \nestablished country allocation and was determined after considering (i) the relative importance \nof  economic  and  financial  reform  to  promote  sustained  economic  growth,  (ii)  the  country\u2019s \ndevelopment financing needs, (iii) the availability of financing from other development partners, \n(iv) the significance and complexity of the program\u2019s policy actions, and (v) the conformity of the \nprogram  with  ADB\u2019s  CPS  for  Solomon  Islands.  Program  grant  proceeds  will  help  finance  the \nprojected fiscal deficit for 2016 of SI$568.5 million ($71.97 million), and support key investment \nprojects identified in the 2016 budget, as outlined in the development policy letter (Appendix 3). \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n33. \nThe  program  period  is  from  1  March  2015  to  31  March  2017.  Program  funding  will  be \nprovided  as  a  single-tranche  grant  of  $5  million  and  will  be  withdrawn  when  the  government \nmeets  the  conditions  for  effectiveness,  including  completing  the  agreed  prior  policy  actions  as \nset  forth  in  the  policy  matrix.  Grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  using  ADB\u2019s  simplified \ndisbursement  procedures  and  related  requirements  for  program  loans.19 The  government  and \nADB  will  continuously  review  program  implementation  using  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework and the policy matrix. Proceeds will be used to finance items produced and procured \nin ADB member countries, excluding items in the list of ineligible items and imports financed by \nother bilateral and multilateral sources.20 \n \n34. \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Treasury  (MOFT)  will  be  the  executing  and  implementing \nagency  and  will  be  responsible  for  overall  implementation,  including  implementing  all  policy \nactions,  administering  the  program,  disbursing  funds,  and  maintaining  all  program  records. \nMOFT will monitor and report to ADB on the implementation of policy actions and their impact \non budget outcomes in line with the design and monitoring framework. Monitoring outcomes and \nimpacts will maximize the use of the government\u2019s own processes and the CEWG mechanism. \n \nIn cooperation with the government and CEWG development partners, ADB will continue \n35. \nto  carry  out  periodic  JRMs.  The  reviews  will  evaluate  the  implementation  of  the  policy  reform \nand  assess  impact,  describe  lessons  identified  during  the  program  period,  and  outline  policy \nactions and  any  assistance  needed to accomplish the agreed  reform  targets. The government \nwill continue to keep ADB informed of the outcome of policy discussions with other multilateral \n\n                                                \n18 A country\u2019s eligibility for Asian Development  Fund grants under the revised grant framework is determined by its \nrisk of debt distress. The latest debt sustainability analysis determined that Solomon Islands had a moderate risk of \ndebt distress and was therefore eligible to receive 50% of its Asian Development Fund allocation as grants. \n19 ADB. 1998.

Having stabilized \nits  immediate  macroeconomic  and  fiscal  position,  and  made  progress  on  improving  PFM \nsystems, the government\u2019s priorities have shifted to a medium-term program to consolidate and \nadvance  its  economic  and  financial  reform  program,  while  putting  in  place  the  necessary \nsupporting reforms to improve development outcomes and strengthen economic growth. \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\nThe  government  and  its  development  partners  continue  to  support  various  aspects  of \n37. \nPFM, procurement, anticorruption, and other governance reforms. A PEFA assessment was first \nundertaken  in  2008,  with  a  follow-up  assessment  in  2012  (footnote  13).  While  some \ncomponents of the PFM system involve risks, the PFM road map draws all relevant actions to \nstrengthen the PFM system into a single document over a 3-year period.21 Procurement reviews \nwere undertaken in 2012 and 2014.22 More generally, ADB participates along with government \nand  CEWG  partners  in  the  annual  review  of  the  government\u2019s  progress  in  implementing  its \nreform agenda, with the most recent review endorsed by the CEWG in March 2015.23 \n \n38. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MOFT. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the legal documents.24 \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n39.  While  Solomon  Islands  does  not  have  a  national  poverty  reduction  strategy,  poverty \nalleviation is  one  of eight  objectives of the  current  NDS. The  Democratic  Coalition for  Change \ngovernment policy statement also focuses on the prevention and alleviation of poverty. \n \n40. \nThe program is classified as some gender elements. ADB supported the completion of a \ncountry gender assessment in 2015.25 This assessment examines the progress toward gender \nequality  across  social,  economic,  and  political  spheres  in  Solomon  Islands,  such  as  health, \neducation,  work,  political  participation,  and  gender-based  violence.  The  Ministry  of  Women, \nYouth,  Children  and  Family  Affairs  will  be  taking  the  assessment  report  to  the  cabinet  for \nendorsement  and  subsequent  launch. The  report\u2019s  recommendations  will  then be taken to the \ngender  focal  points  in  each  ministry  to  see  how  they  can  be  integrated  into  sector  plans  and \nprograms  where appropriate. This  work  will  feed into  the government\u2019s  national  planning  work \nand is included under action 1.3 of the policy matrix. \n                                                \n21 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 World  Bank.  2012.
