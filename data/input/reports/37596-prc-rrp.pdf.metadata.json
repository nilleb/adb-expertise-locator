An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was \nundertaken.  The  summary  EIA  was  circulated  to  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  Board  of  Directors  on  6  January \n2006 and uploaded on the ADB web site on 10 January 2006. \n \nThe Guangxi Nanning Urban Environmental Upgrading Project (the \nProject) is a key urban environmental improvement initiative of the \nNanning municipal government (NMG) which aims to enhance the \nurban  environment  and  public  health  in  Nanning  City.  The \nincidence of waterborne and vector-borne diseases is expected to \nbe  reduced  by  10%  from  the  2004  level.  The  Project  comprises \nfour  subprojects:  (i) Xinxujiang  River  environmental  upgrading, \nwhich will reduce flood risk, improve wastewater management, and \nexpand the green environment in the area along Xinxujiang River; \n(ii) Kelijiang River environmental upgrading, which will reduce flood \nrisk,  improve  wastewater  management,  and  expand  the  green \nenvironment in the area along Kelijiang River within Xiangsihu New \nDistrict;  (iii)  solid  waste  management,  which  will  strengthen  the \ndomestic  solid  waste  management  capacity  and \nimprove \ncleanliness  of  the  streets;  and  (iv)  Qingxiushan  Park  ecological \nupgrading,  which  will  improve  the  environmental  conditions  and \nfacilities  of  the  park,  a  major  tourism  and  recreational  amenity  in \nNanning  City,  and  thereby  contribute  to  improvement  of  the  city\u2019s \nair  quality,  promote  tourism,  and  increase  people\u2019s  awareness  of \nenvironmental  protection.  The  Project  will  provide  institutional \ncapacity  building  and  training  on  project  management,  operation \nand  maintenance  (O&M)  of  project  facilities,  and  sustainable \nfinancial management of the implementing agencies (IAs).  \n \nNanning is the capital of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region \n(GZAR).  Nanning\u2019s  economic  growth  has  lagged  behind  other \ncoastal regions in the PRC but it has experienced rapid economic \ngrowth during the last two decades. The annual growth rate of 12% \nfor 2003\u20132004 was higher than the national average of 9.8%. The \nurban  population  has  increased  from  1.0  million  in  1995  to \n1.5 million in 2004, and is expected to grow further to 2.1 million in \n2010 and 3.0 million in 2020. \n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nis  currently  addressing \n\nthree  major  development \nNanning \nopportunities: (i) its role as a gateway to the landlocked provinces \nof  the  southwestern  region  of  the  PRC,  (ii)  its  designation  as  a \ntarget  city  under  the  Government\u2019s  Western  Region  Development \nStrategy,  and  (iii)  its  role  as  a  gateway  to  the  Association  of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN). \n \nTo  accelerate  social  and  economic  development,  improve  the \nquality  of  life  for  urban  residents,  and  upgrade  the  urban \nenvironment,  the  provision  of  basic  infrastructure  and  services \nneeds to be expanded and upgraded in Nanning City. The Project \nwill  reduce  water  and  soil  pollution  through  flood  control  and \nwastewater  and  solid  waste  management  (brown  issues),  and \nimprove  the  quality  of  life  of  urban  residents  by  increasing  green \nspace (green issues). \n \nThe impact of the Project is to enhance the urban environment and \npublic  health  in  Nanning  City  through  (i)  improved  flood  control, \n(ii) improved  wastewater  and  solid  waste  management,  and \n(iii) expanded  green  environment.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  will \nbe  improved  urban  environmental  management  in  Nanning  by \n2010 through (i) reducing the flood risk to no more than 5% annual \nprobability in Xinxujiang and Kelijiang rivers within Xiangsihu New \nDistrict; (ii) upgrading the water quality from worse than class V to \nclass  IV  in  Xinxujiang  River  and  class  III  in  Kelijiang  River; \n(iii) improving  efficiency  in  solid  waste  management;  (iv)  reducing \nsolid  wastes  and  general  dirt  in  city  streets;  (v) expanding  green \nspace  by  0.5  square  meters  (m2)  per  capita  per  year;  and \n(vi) increasing public awareness of environmental protection. \n \nThe investment cost of the Project is estimated at the equivalent of \n$262.6 million, including taxes and duties of $8.2 million. \n \n($ million equivalent) \nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nNanning Municipal Government \nLocal Bank Loans \nTotal \nNote: Columns may not add up because of rounding. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  the  equivalent  of  $100.0  million, \ncovering  about  38.1%  of  the  total  project  cost,  including  financial \ncharges  during  construction  on  the  loan.  The  Government  will \nprovide about 61.9% of the total project cost. Counterpart funding \nwill be financed by the NMG\u2019s wastewater tariff, solid waste tariff, \ncity  construction  and  maintenance  tax,  and  special  fiscal  funds. \nCommercial  financing  from  domestic  banks  will  provide  additional \nfunding. \n \n\nTotal Cost \n100.0 \n151.6 \n  11.1 \n262.6 \n\n% \n38.1 \n57.7 \n4.2 \n100.0 \n\n\f \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $100.0 million from the ordinary capital resources of ADB \nwill  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in \nfacility,  a \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \ncommitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and  such  other  terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n \nThe  PRC  will  make  proceeds  of  the  loan  available  to  the \ngovernment of the GZAR. The government of the GZAR will make \nproceeds  of  the  loan  available  to  NMG,  which  will  onlend  to  the \nrespective  IAs.  All  subloans  and  onlending  will  be  on  the  same \nterms  and  conditions  as  the  ADB  loan.  The  IAs  will  assume  the \nforeign exchange and interest rate variation risks for ADB\u2019s loan. \n \nUntil 30 June 2011 \n \n31 December 2010 \n\nlending \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nNanning Municipal Government \n \nNMG has established a project steering committee (PSC) headed \nby  the  vice  mayor.  The  PSC  will  be  responsible  for  project \ncoordination  and  policy  guidance  during  implementation.  The \nproject  management  office  (PMO)  for  the  project  preparatory \ntechnical  assistance  established  within  the  Nanning  Financial \nBureau  will  continue  as  the  PMO  for  the  Project.  The  PMO  will \nserve  as  the  secretariat  of  the  PSC  and  will  be  responsible  for \ncoordinating implementation of project activities. \n \nADB-financed  equipment,  materials  and  goods,  and  services  will \nbe  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines. \nProcurement  will  be  coursed  through  international  competitive \nbidding,  national  competitive  bidding,  or  shopping  procedures  as \ndetermined  by  the  particular  circumstances  of  each  contract \npackage.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines, \nforeign  contractors  may  participate \nfor  national \ncompetitive bidding contracts. \n \nThe loan will finance about 32 person-months of international and \n94  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  to  support  the \nPMO  and  IAs  in  project  implementation  and  management,  and \ninstitutional capacity building. The consultants will cover (i) project \nmanagement  and  implementation  support;  (ii)  efficient  operating \nprocedures; \nfinancial \nmanagement; (v) social,  resettlement,  and environmental impacts \nmonitoring;  (vi)  business  planning and  management  information \nsystem  development;  (vii)  human  resources  development;  and \n(viii) corporate governance. The consultants will assist the  PMO in \n\npreventive  maintenance; \n\nin  bidding \n\n(iv) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\nv\n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\nquestions  related  to  ADB  procedures  and  reporting,  procurement, \nquality  control,  start-up \ntesting,  commissioning,  O&M,  and \nimplementation of the project performance monitoring system. The \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants  by  Asian  Development  Bank  and  its \nBorrowers.  \n \nThe  Project  will  significantly  improve  water  quality  in  Xinxujiang \nRiver  and  Kelijiang  River,  enhance  the  safety  of  drinking  water \nsources in downstream Yongjiang River, and protect the quality of \ngroundwater,  especially  in  shallow  aquifers.  The  Project  will \nconvert  current  environmental  hot  spots  affected  by  uncontrolled \nwastewater  and  solid  waste  discharges  in  the  Xinxujiang  and \nKelijiang  rivers  into  model  green  areas,  improving  the  city\u2019s \nenvironmental  conditions  and  aesthetics.  The  Project  will  also \nenhance the quality of the urban environment by increasing carbon \nthrough  ecological \ndioxide  absorption  and  oxygen  release, \nupgrading  of  Qingxiushan  Park.  The  Project  will  improve  the \nenvironmental  potential  of  Qingxiushan  Park  by  (i)  increasing  the \ntotal  biomass  and  forest  coverage  rate,  (ii)  protecting  and \ndiversifying forest species and promoting research to ensure forest \nsustainability,  (iii)  enhancing  soil  conservation,  and  (iv)  promoting \npublic awareness programs for park visitors. \n \nThe Project will benefit about 3.03 million residents, of which about \n217,000  (7.2%)  are  poor.  The  improved  urban  environment  will \nprovide  an  enabling  environment  for  poverty  reduction  through \n(i) reduction  of  the  incidence  of  infectious  and  waterborne  and \nvector-borne diseases, (ii) improvement of investment conditions to \nattract more outside investment for local development, (iii) creation \nof  new  job  opportunities,  and  (iv)  development  of  the  tourism \nindustry.  As  a  result,  the  population  exposed  to  waterborne  and \nvector-borne diseases will be reduced, and the associated medical \ncosts  and  number  of  workdays  and  school  days  lost  due  to \nsickness will be cut. Savings in medical costs will be greater for the \npoor,  families  with  children,  and  the  elderly,  as  they  are  most \nvulnerable to such diseases. \n \nPotential  risks  include  (i)  inadequate  wastewater  treatment  and \nsolid  waste  disposal  capacities  at  the  required  time  because  of \ndelays in the second phase of the Jiangnan wastewater treatment \nplant  upgrading  and  the  Chengnan  landfill  site  improvement  by \nNMG,  and  the  Nanning  city  sewerage  upgrading  by  the  World \nBank;  (ii)  possible  delays  in  increasing  the  solid  waste  tariff  and \ntariff  collection  rate;  (iii)  lack  of  customers\u2019  willingness  to  pay \nincreased  tariffs;  (iv)  lack  of  proper  O&M  of  the  project  facilities; \n(v) lack  of \ntheir  responsibilities; \n(vi) discontinuation  of  enforcement  of  environmental  standards; \n(vii)  change  in  existing  pollution  control  measures;  (viii) lack  of \nsupport  from  all  levels  of  government  agencies  concerned;  (ix) \ndelays  in  land  acquisition  and resettlement;  and (x)  unforeseen \n\nIAs\u2019  capacity \n\nto  carry  out \n\n\f \n\nvii\n\ndifficult  construction  conditions.  Risk  (i)  is  being  mitigated  by \nsynchronizing  the  project  design  and  implementation  schedules. \nRisks  (ii)  and  (iii)  are  being  mitigated  by  ensuring  financial  and \nmanagerial  autonomy  for  the  solid  waste  management  company, \nand conducting public consultations to obtain public support for the \ntariff increase. Risks (iv) and (v) will be mitigated through provision \nof  institutional  capacity  building  for  the  IAs.

\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Guangxi  Nanning  Urban  Environmental \nUpgrading Project (the Project). \n \n2. \nThe  Government  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  help  improve  the \nurban  environment  in  Nanning  City,  the  capital  of  the  Guangxi  Zhuang  Autonomous  Region \n(GZAR)  by  reducing  flood  risks,  improving  wastewater  and  solid  waste  management,  and \nexpanding  the  green  environment.  The  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  water  policy1 and  will \nhelp \nthe  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  of  environmental \nsustainability  and  increased  access  to  safe  drinking  water  and  basic  sanitation.  This  report  is \nbased on the findings of the Loan Appraisal Mission and discussions with the central and local \ngovernments,  relevant  agencies,  and  community  organizations.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nthe  PRC  achieve \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  urban  population  in  the  PRC  grew  from  about  190  million  in  1980  to  almost \n3. \n524 million,  about  40%  of  the  total  population,  in  2004.  This  urbanization  trend  is  expected  to \ncontinue and about 700 million people, equivalent to 50% of the population, will live in cities by \n2030.2 Rapid economic growth over the last two decades has created tremendous pressure on \nnatural  resources  including  land,  water,  and  forests.  Increasing  demand  for  basic  urban \ninfrastructure  has  exceeded  the  financial  and  physical  capacity  of  most  cities  to  provide \nadequate sanitation services. In 2004, about 32.6 billion cubic meters (m3) of wastewater was \ngenerated and discharged in the PRC, of which only about 45.7% was treated. Much of the solid \nwaste  is  disposed  in  natural  depressions  or  open  dumps  without  adequate  environmental \nsafeguards. This has accelerated the pollution of rivers, lakes, and underground aquifers; and \nhas degraded the urban environment. \n  \nThe  Government  has  prioritized  environmental  protection  and  pollution  control  in  its \n4. \ndevelopment  strategy. 3  It  has  enacted  several  environmental  laws,  including  those  on  the \nprevention  or  control  of  pollution  of  air  and  water.  These  laws  and  ancillary  regulations \nemphasize  initial  prevention  and  then  the  polluter  pays  principle  during  environmental \nmanagement.  Two  key  legal  requirements  are  well  established:  (i)  prior  evaluation  of  the \nenvironmental  impact  of  projects;  and  (ii)  the  principle  that  the  design,  construction,  and \noperation  of  a  project  should  be  carried  out  simultaneously  with  the  design,  construction,  and \noperation of the associated environmental protection measures. The Government has issued a \nseries  of  laws  on  the  use  of  natural  resources  and  has  instituted  a  system  of  monitoring, \nrecording, and reporting the discharge of pollutants. The laws stipulate administrative, civil, and \ncriminal responsibilities for environmental violations. \n \nNanning  has  been  the  capital  of  the  GZAR,  located  in  the  southwestern  region  of  the \n5. \nPRC, since 1958. The economic development of Nanning started from a relatively low level with \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2001.

However,  during  the  last \ntwo decades, Nanning has experienced rapid economic growth. Its GDP reached CNY59 billion \nin 2004 compared with only CNY3 billion in 1985. The annual growth rate of 12% for 2003\u20132004 \nwas  higher  than  the  national  average  of  9.8%.  The  urban  population  has  increased  from \n1.0 million in 1995 to 1.5 million in 2004, and is expected to grow further to 2.1 million in 2010 \nand 3.0 million in 2020. Nanning is currently addressing three major development opportunities: \n(i)  its  role  as  a  gateway  to  the  landlocked  provinces  of  the  southwestern  region  of  the  PRC, \n(ii) its  designation  as  a  target  city  under  the  Government\u2019s  Western  Region  Development \nStrategy, and (iii) its role as a gateway to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \ncountries.4 \n \nThe  provision  of  basic  infrastructure  and  services  has  not  kept  pace  with  increased \n6. \ndemand. This has led to deterioration in the quality of life for urban residents, degradation of the \nurban environment, and inefficient economic development. The Nanning municipal government \n(NMG)  aims  to  relieve  pressure  on  the  city\u2019s  existing  central  commercial  areas  by  further \ndevelopment,  aimed  at  high-tech  research  and  manufacturing  outputs  together  with  the \nassociated residential accommodation. The areas identified to benefit from this urban expansion \nare those (i) presently at risk of seasonal flooding, (ii) in need of basic infrastructure services to \nremove  existing  point  sources  of  pollution  and  provide  for  future  wastewater  discharges,  and \n(iii) requiring  an  increase  in  solid  waste  collection  points  for  transfer  of  waste  to  disposal.  The \ndevelopment of Xiangsihu New District falls into three areas of activity: (i) public infrastructure, \n(ii)  institutional  buildings,  and  (iii)  commercial  and  domestic  accommodation.  The  Project  will \nsupport  the  first  area.  The  second  area  will  be  developed  by  NMG.  The  third  area  will  be \npredominantly  developed  through  private  sector  initiatives  that  NMG  will  actively  pursue  and \nencourage. \n \nB. \n \n7. \nThe  major  urban  environmental  issues  in  Nanning  are  (i)  inadequate  flood  protection \nmeasures for the newly urbanized areas, (ii)  lack of wastewater and  solid waste management \nfacilities  and  inefficiency  in  its  management,  and  (iii)  degradation  of  the  green  environment \nthroughout the city and in Qingxiushan Park. The Government needs assistance to achieve the \nMDGs  for  environmental  sustainability  (Goal  7)  and  to  halve  the  proportion  of  people  without \nsustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015 (Target 10). \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nNanning City Master Plan \n\n \n8. \nThe  Nanning  Urban  Master  Plan  for  2004\u20132020  indicates  that  the  city\u2019s  urban \ndevelopment will follow the \u201cone axis and two strips\u201d model \u2014 one axis along Yongjiang River \nincluding  Xiangsihu  New  District;5 one  strip  of  north  and  west  ecological  protection;  and  one \nstrip of south ecological protection \u2014 that will form the multi-center urban space system of \u201cone \ncenter, two subcenters, and multi-cores\u201d. The urban area of Nanning City will expand both west \nand east. \n \n9. \nTo  the  east,  newly  urbanized  areas  are  either  under  construction  or  already  well \ndeveloped. In the short term, the eastern development outwards to the ring expressway will be \n\n                                                 \n4   Nanning  City  has  been  nominated  as  the  permanent  host  city  of  the  annual  China-ASEAN  Exposition.  It  has \n\nrecently become a member of the Greater Mekong Subregion. \n\n5   Xiangsihu  New  District  is  a  new  development  zone  identified  by  the  NMG,  which  covers  more  than  one \n\nadministrative district rather than an administrative district. \n\n\fdelayed because of the shortage of capital for infrastructure upgrading. Further development to \nthe east will put huge fiscal pressure on NMG. However, to the west, Xiangsihu New District is \nan ideal new area for future urban development of Nanning City because of (i) high-value land \nreserve;  (ii)  convenient  transportation  to  the  city  center;  and  (iii)  highly  developed  education, \nscience,  and  technology  establishments.  In  addition,  to  meet  the  time  schedule  of  integrated \nand  balanced  development  of  Nanning  City,  urban  development  priority  is  to  accelerate  the \nconstruction of Xiangsihu New District. \n \nThe  total  area  of  120  square  kilometers  (km2)  of  the  whole  Xiangsihu  New  District  is \n10. \nequivalent to the current size of Nanning City. From an economic development perspective, this \nnew  district  has  a  concentration  of  a  number  of  economic  entities  including  a  high-tech \ndevelopment zone, and most of the higher education colleges and universities in the city. From \nthe social development  perspective, the new district will soften the competition  for  land use in \nthe  existing  central  areas  of  the  city.  The  planned  development  of  Xiangsihu  New  District  will \nturn this district into a subcenter of the city with science and technology companies, education \ninstitutions, and residential accommodation. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Rationale \n\n \n11. \nXinxujiang and Kelijiang rivers are located in the western part of the city, and flow into \nYongjiang  River.  Both  rivers  are  characterized  by  shallow  channels  and  wide  terracing.  Flood \ncontrol measures undertaken by NMG in respect of Yongjiang River have prevented surcharge \nflooding  into  the  Xinxujiang  and  Kelijiang  catchments  to  a  certain  extent,  but  existing  flood \nprotection  facilities  are  not  sufficient  to  protect  Xiangsihu  New  District  from  5%  annual \nprobability of flooding. \n \n12. \nXinxujiang and Kelijiang river basins overlap with part of Xiangsihu New District, which is \ncurrently  a  peri-urban  area,  and  infrastructure  development  is  lagging  behind.  Wastewater  is \ndischarged into the nearest watercourses in the Xinxujiang and Kelijiang catchments through a \ncombined sewerage system and is not treated. This creates gross pollution in Xinxujiang River \nand Kelijiang River. The current pollution level is worse than class V of the national water quality \nstandard.6 NMG has a target to increase the collection and treatment of domestic wastewater in \nthe city to 70% by 2010 and 90% by 2020,7 and thus achieve class III or IV water quality in city\u2019s \nrivers, including Xinxujiang River and Kelijiang River. Water quality improvement in Xinxujiang \nand Kelijiang rivers will contribute to protection of water quality around raw water intakes located \ndownstream  along  Yongjiang  River.  While  wastewater  treatment  plants  and  trunk  mains  are \nbeing developed, sewer networks need to be expanded in Xiangsihu New District. \n \n13. \nCurrently,  domestic  solid  waste  is  collected  from  households  manually  using  bicycles \nwith carts, offloaded to containers at the transfer stations, and transported by road to the landfill \nsite. The efficiency of the solid waste management system would be significantly increased by \nupgrading  the  transfer  stations  to  include  effective  compaction,  increasing  the  number  of \ntransfer  stations,  and  introducing  an  operational  management  control  system  to  improve  the \nefficiency of waste transfer. Street sweeping is undertaken manually. The increase in the urban \n\n                                                 \n6   The PRC environmental quality standards have five classes for surface water quality based on their use. Class I is \nthe best in quality  and class V is the  worst. Class I is for water resources and nationally  protected  water bodies. \nClass II is for high-value fish protection areas, class A protection areas, and spawning habitats for fish. Class III is \nfor potable water resources, class B protection areas, general fish protection areas, and swimming areas. Class IV \nis for general industrial water sources and noncontact recreational areas. Class V is suitable only for industrial use. \n\n7   In accordance with the national directives. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nroad area and the introduction of higher-speed dual carriageways have created a safety hazard, \nand advanced mechanized techniques are needed. \n \n14. \nQingxiushan Park is located in the immediate southeast of Nanning. The total area of the \npark  is  21.7  km2,  of  which  the  forest  cover  is  currently  2.9  km2.  Qingxiushan  Park  is  a  major \ntourism and recreational amenity in Nanning, attracting 70% of its visitors from outside the city. \nVisitors enjoy walking and hiking in the forest and pray at the temple inside the park. The forest \nin Qingxiushan Park contributes to air quality improvement by increasing the carbon holding and \nreleasing  more  oxygen.  Nanning  City  has  been  declared  the  \u201cgarden  city\u201d  by  the  state \ngovernment.8 NMG  endeavors  to  increase  the  current  8.1  square  meters  (m2)  of  green  space \nper capita by 0.5 m2 each year. Qingxiushan Park has been and will continue to be the major \ncontributor to achieve this target. The problems facing Qingxiushan Park have natural causes: \n(i) frequent  and  periodic  fires  damage  trees  and  wildlife  habitat,  (ii)  monsoon  rains  result  in \nerosion  and  loss  of  soils,  and  (iii)  wastewater  generated  in  the  park  and  discharged  through \nseptic  tanks  to  open  water  ditches  within  the  park  contaminates  groundwater.  Visitors  pay  an \nentrance  fee,  and  trees  and  flowers  produced  in  the  park  are  sold  mainly  for  greening  of \nNanning  City.  These  revenues  are  used  for  management  of  the  park  and  will  fund  part  of  the \nProject.  The  Nanning  Qingxiu  Mountain  Scenic  and  Resort  Development  Company  has  legal \npower to enforce adequate protection of the park within its charter. \n \n\n3. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n \n15. \nPolicy dialogue on key reforms is a significant aspect of ADB\u2019s operations in the PRC in \nwater  supply,  sanitation,  and  waste  management.  Significant  progress  has  been  made  in \n(i) introducing tariff and enterprise reforms, (ii) strengthening the local and regulatory framework, \nand  (iii)  promoting  private  sector  participation.  ADB  has  supported  the  tariff  reform  process \nthrough  two  technical  assistance  (TA)  projects9 which  have  contributed  significantly  to  water \ntariff  reforms  and  resources  conservation.  These  were  followed  by  ADB\u2019s  urban  wastewater \ntariff study TA,10 under which the national guidelines for wastewater tariffs were developed. The \nguidelines  include  tariff  calculation  methodologies  that  will  allow  full  cost  recovery,  taking  into \nconsideration  affordability  and  social  constraints.  The  TA  also  recommended  options  for \nencouraging multichannel investment, including private sector participation in urban wastewater \nmanagement.  In  addition,  ADB  supported  the  Government  through  a  TA  that  strengthened \npolicy reform on the use of market-based instruments to enhance private sector partnership in \npublic utilities, mainly for water supply, and wastewater and solid waste management.11 \n \nThe  Project  will  build  on  and  continue  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  on \n16. \n(i) sustainable flood control and river basin management, (ii) reduction of flood risk maintaining \nwater  quality,  (iii)  wastewater  management  and  reduction  of  open  watercourse  pollution, \n(iv) comprehensive solid waste management, (v) cost recovery and tariff reform, and (vi) poverty \nreduction. \n \n17. \nStrengthening of the legal framework for sound environmental management has been a \nkey  element  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  and  operational  activities.  To  help  build  the  necessary \n\n                                                 \n8   The  criteria  for  the  \u201cgarden  city\u201d  include  green  space  of  (i)  more  than  6.5  square  meters  (m2)  per  capita,  and \n\n(ii) more than 30% of the total city area. \n\n9   ADB. 1997.

Manila. \n\n\fcapacity,  ADB  provided  training  for  staff  of  the  Environmental  Protection  Commission  of  the \nNational People\u2019s Congress, and developed a legal information system to support drafting the \nenvironmental  laws.  In  the  area  of  legislation,  assistance  was  provided  to  help  amend  the \n(i) water  pollution  prevention  and  control  law  which  was  passed  in  1996,  (ii) antidesertification \nlaw passed in 2001, and (iii) a clean production law which is under consideration by the National \nPeople\u2019s  Congress.12 In  addition,  ADB  helped  upgrade  the  knowledge  and  skills  of  provincial \nlegislative  drafters  in  reviewing,  amending,  and  formulating  local  legislation  on  protection  and \nconservation  of  the  environment  and  natural  resources.  ADB  helped  improve  the  institutional \ncapacity  of  the  State  Environmental  Protection  Administration  and  its  provincial  bureaus  to \nstrengthen environmental standards and to enforce environmental laws and policies. \n \n18. \nFlood  events  in  rapidly  growing  cities  damage  high-value  urban  property;  disrupt  key \nindustrial,  commercial,  and  government  centers;  and  have  high  recovery  costs.  The  current \nflood  control  system  in  the  PRC  emphasizes  the  use  of  structural  measures  to  reduce  flood \nhazards,  which  are  essential  to  improve  security  for  those  living  and  working  in  flood-prone \nareas.  Nonstructural  approaches  are  also  increasingly  used  to  mitigate  flood  risks\u2014including \ndata  acquisition,  flood  forecasting,  flood  warning,  and  response  procedures\u2014to  reduce \nexposure  and  vulnerability  to  floods.  The  development  of  flood  protection  measures  for  flood \naffected  cities  is  a  local  government  responsibility.  Plans  have  been  prepared  for  a  range  of \nstructural  and  nonstructural  works  within  the  city\u2019s  jurisdiction.  However,  plans  need  to  be \nassessed  within  the  overall  framework  of  the  river  basin  development  and  in  line  with  the \nnational  policy  on  integrated  flood  management.  Specifically,  monitoring  in  the  project  area \nshould be integrated in the real-time modeling of river flows and flood routing for the Pearl River \nsystem  which  covers  the  project  area  (Assurance  ii  a);  and  the  rehabilitation  of  the  reservoir, \nlocated  at  the  upper  stream  of  the  project  area,  should  be  completed  by  the  time  of  the \ncompletion of the physical works under the Project (Assurance ii b).  \n \n19. \nCurrently, urban district governments are responsible for collection and transfer of solid \nwaste  to  the  landfill  site  while  the  Nanning  Sanitation  and  Administration  Department  is \nresponsible  for  operation  and  management  of  the  landfill  site.  Lack  of  coordination  between \ndistrict governments causes inefficiency in transferring solid waste from the transfer stations to \nthe landfill site. Establishment of a transfer system covering six urban districts will be considered \nfor  future  improvement.  NMG  will  introduce  an  operational  management  control  system  under \nthe Project to improve the efficiency of waste transfer to maximize the efficiency of solid waste \nmanagement [paragraph 28 (vi)]. \n \n\n4. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n \n20. \nADB has financed 57 TA grants and provided 16 loans totaling about $1,977 million to \naddress  issues  relating  to  the  urban  development  and  environment  sector  in  the  PRC \n(Appendix 2). ADB\u2019s assistance in these sectors has resulted in more rational pricing of water, \nmajor increases in water tariffs, introduction of wastewater tariffs, implementation of commercial \nprinciples, and introduction of private sector participation. These improvements are fundamental \nfor  making  the  wastewater  management  and  water  supply  sector  financially  and  operationally \nsustainable. \n \n21. \nLessons  learned  from  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  the  urban  development  and  environment \nsector  were  considered  in  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government,  engineering  design  of  the \n\n                                                 \n12  ADB.  1994.

Manila.  \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fproject facilities, and institutional capacity building programs. One of the lessons learned is the \nneed  for  strategic  master  plans.  Since  the  Project  covers  various  subsector  components, \nextensive policy dialogue was held with the Government on the related master plans, including \nthe  (i)  overall  city  master  plan,  (ii)  river  basin  management  and  flood  control  master  plan, \n(iii) wastewater  management  plan,  and  (iv)  solid  waste  management  master  plan.  It  was \nconfirmed  that  each  project  component  is  in  line  with  the  respective  master  plan.  A  second \nmajor issue is the importance of cost recovery and tariff reform. These were discussed as part \nof  the  policy  dialogue  and  it  was  agreed  that  the  wastewater  and  solid  waste  tariff  would  be \nreviewed during project implementation to improve cost recovery. A third lesson learned is that \nincreased  public  awareness  is  one  of  the  most  effective  measures  to  improve  the  urban \nenvironment. In view of this, provision of public awareness training on environmental protection \nhas  been  included  under  the  Project.  A  lesson  related  to  resettlement  is  the  need  for  the \nestablishment  of  an  effective  internal  and  external  monitoring  mechanism  of  resettlement \nimplementation. Arrangements for monitoring and evaluation have been fully incorporated in the \nresettlement plans. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  is  to  enhance  the  urban  environment  and  public  health  in \n22. \nNanning  City  through  (i)  improved  flood  control,  (ii)  improved  solid  waste  and  wastewater \nmanagement,  and  (iii)  expanded  green  environment.  The  incidence  of  waterborne  and  vector-\nborne  diseases  is  expected  to  be  reduced  by  10%  from  the  2004  level.  The  outcome  of  the \nProject will be improved urban environmental management in Nanning by 2010 by (i) reducing \nthe  flood  risk  to  no  more  than  5%  annual  probability  in  Xinxujiang  and  Kelijiang  rivers  within \nXiangsihu  New  District;  (ii)  upgrading  the  water  quality  from  worse  than  class  V  to  class  IV  in \nXinxujiang  River  and  class  III  in  Kelijiang  River;  (iii)  improving  efficiency  in  solid  waste \nmanagement;  (iv)  reducing  solid  wastes  and  general  dirt  in  city  streets;  (v)  expanding  green \nspace by 0.5 m2 per capita per annum; and (vi) increasing public awareness of environmental \nprotection. \n \nB. \n \n23. \nThe  Project  comprises  four  subprojects:  (i)  Xinxujiang  River  environmental  upgrading, \n(ii) Kelijiang River environmental upgrading, (iii) solid waste management, and (iv) Qingxiushan \nPark ecological upgrading.

This  subproject  will  (i)  construct  and  rehabilitate  12.53  km  of  embankment; \n(ii) create  a  permanent  lake  (Xinxujiang  Lake)  by  dredging  and  embankment  with  a  normal \nretaining  capacity  of  2.92  million  m3  and  additional  wet  season  flood  storage  capacity  of \n5.65 million m3; (iii) construct 3.00 km of interceptor sewers along the banks of Xinxujiang Lake \nto transfer about 14,000 m3 per day of wastewater to the Jiangnan wastewater drainage system; \nand  (iv)  provide  a  pumping  station  and  delivery  main  for  the  transfer  of  water  from  Yongjiang \nRiver  to  flush  through  Xinxujiang  Lake  during  the  dry  season  for  maintaining  water  flow  and \nwater quality. \n \n25. \nThe  Kelijiang  River  environmental  upgrading  subproject  will  reduce  flood  risk,  improve \nwastewater management, and expand the green environment in the area along Kelijiang River \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fof 1.64 km2. This subproject will (i) construct and rehabilitate 14.9 km of embankment; (ii) create \na  permanent  lake  (Xiangsihu  Lake)  by  dredging  and  embankment  with  a  normal  retaining \ncapacity of 4.38 million m3 and additional wet season flood storage capacity of 5.42 million m3; \n(iii)  install  47.75  km  of  sewerage  pipelines,  2  pumping  stations,  and  a  buried  pipe  crossing \nunder Yongjiang River to transfer about 60,000 m3 per day of wastewater from Xiangsihu New \nDistrict to the Jiangnan wastewater drainage system; (iv) provide a pumping station and delivery \nmain for the transfer of water from Yongjiang River to flush through Xiangsihu Lake during the \ndry  season  for  maintaining  water  flow  and  water  quality;  and  (v)  construct  a  storm  water \ndrainage pipe network to serve the proposed 23.17 km2 Xiangsihu New District. \n \n26. \nThe  solid  waste  management  subproject  will  strengthen  the  domestic  solid  waste \nmanagement capacity of NMG and improve the  cleanliness of the streets. This subproject will \n(i) construct  or  upgrade  22  small  transfer  stations  throughout  the  urban  districts,  (ii)  provide \nloading  and  compacting  equipment  at  all  the  transfer  stations,  (iii)  determine  an  operational \nmanagement  control  system  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  waste  transfer,  and  (iv)  provide  30 \nstreet  sweeping  vehicles  and  20  street  washing  tankers.  The  compacted  waste  will  be \ntransported to a new engineering landfill site at Chengnan. \n \n27. \nThe  Qingxiushan  Park  ecological  upgrading  subproject  will  improve  the  environmental \nconditions and facilities of the park, a major tourism and recreational amenity in Nanning City, \nand  thereby  contribute  to  improvement  of  the  city\u2019s  air  quality,  promote  tourism,  and  increase \npeople\u2019s  awareness  of  the  environment.  This  subproject  will  include  (i)  71  hectares  (ha)  of \nreforestation; (ii)198 ha of improved arboreal mix; (iii) a seedling base comprising greenhouses, \nplant  shelters,  and  spray  irrigation  system;  (iv)  forest  protection  facilities  comprising  two  fire \nappliances and  facilities  for  prevention  and  cure  of  plant  diseases  and  control  of  insect  pests; \n(v) auxiliary  support  facilities  comprising  2.5  km  of  access  road  to  the  seedling  base,  electric \npower  supply,  telecommunication,  and  a  science  and  technology  service  center;  (vi)  gravity \nsewers and 11 pumping stations for the southern area of Qingxiushan Park; (vii) two separate \ntrunk  sewer  routes  to  transfer  wastewater  flows  to  the  Langdong  wastewater  treatment  plant \nfrom  Qingxiushan  Park;  and  (viii)  provision  of  public  awareness  training  on  environmental \nprotection to the visitors. \n \nThe  institutional  capacity  building  will  support  increased  efficiency  and  management \n28. \ncapacity  of  the  implementing  agencies  (IAs).  Capacity  building  will  be  achieved  through \ndomestic  and  overseas  training  and  the  provision  of  consulting  services.  Institutional  capacity \nbuilding  will  assist  the  IAs  to  (i)  become  autonomous  and  financially  sustainable  operating \ncompanies  that  can  effectively  and  efficiently  meet  the  service  obligations  set  out  for  them; \n(ii) comply with all relevant national policies for the cost recovery, tariff, and enterprise reform of \nthe wastewater and solid waste management sector; (iii) develop soundly based operation and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  plans  for  future  service  provision  and  commercial  growth;  (iv)  develop  a \npublic  awareness  training  program  on  environmental  protection;  (v)  establish  technical  and \nadministrative policies and procedures on the hydraulic and water quality balance in Xinxujiang \nand  Xiangsihu  lakes;  and  (vi)   improve  the  efficiency  in  solid  waste  transportation  at  the  new \nand upgraded transfer stations. \n \nC. \n \n29. \nThe  Project  will  adopt  a  comprehensive,  coordinated  approach  involving  several \ninterrelated components to addressing the complex and interrelated problems of improving the \nurban  environment.  The  Project  will  prevent  water  and  soil  pollution  through  flood  control  and \nwastewater  and  solid  waste  management  (brown  issues),  and  improve  the  quality  of  life  of \n\nSpecial Features \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\furban  residents  by  increasing  green  space  (green  issues).  Areas  around  Xinxujiang  Lake  and \nXiangsihu  Lake,  which  will  be  created  to  increase  the  flood  retaining  capacity  of  Xinxujiang \nRiver and Kelijiang River, will be developed concurrently as parks and serve as public amenity \nareas. These areas are currently environmental hot spots affected by uncontrolled wastewater \nand  solid  waste  discharge.  Provision  of  urban  infrastructure  in  the  proposed  newly  urbanized \narea  will  enable  NMG  to  relieve  the  pressure  of  rapid  urbanization  in  the  existing  city  center. \nThe urban environmental scope of this Project is broader than that of past ADB-financed urban \nenvironmental improvement projects which have focused mainly on wastewater management. \n \nD. \n \n30. \nThe total project cost is estimated at the equivalent of $262.64 million, including foreign \nexchange  costs  of  $113.47  million  (43.2%)  and  local  currency  costs  of  the  equivalent  of \n$149.17 million (56.8%).

The  project  steering  committee \n(PSC),  headed  by  the  vice  mayor  and  comprising  representatives  of  the  Nanning  Financial \nBureau,  Nanning  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  Nanning  Planning  Administration \nBureau,  Nanning  Construction  Commission,  Nanning  Land  and  Resources  Bureau,  Nanning \nEnvironment  Protection  Bureau,  Nanning  Water  Resource  Bureau,  Nanning  Municipal \nAdministration  Bureau,  Nanning  Audit  Bureau,  Qingxiushan  Mountain  Administration \nCommission,  and  Xiangsihu  New  District  Administration  Commission,  will  be  responsible  for \nproject coordination and providing policy guidance during implementation. \n \nThe  Nanning  Investment  and  Development  Company  will  be  the  IA  for  the  Xinxujiang \n35. \nRiver  environmental  upgrading  subproject;  the  Nanning  Xiangsihu  Investment,  Construction, \nand Development Company Limited for the Kelijiang River environmental upgrading subproject; \nthe  Nanning  Shixi  Solid  Waste  Treatment  Company  Limited  for  the  solid  waste  management \nsubproject;  and  the  Nanning  Qingxiu  Mountain  Scenic  and  Tourist  Resort  Development \nCompany Limited for the Qingxiushan Park ecological upgrading subproject. These companies \nare 100% state-owned.  \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nThe  project  management  office  (PMO)  has  been  established  within  the  Nanning \n36. \nFinancial Bureau. The PMO will serve as the secretariat of the PSC and will be responsible for \ncoordinating  the  implementation  of  project  activities.  The  PMO  will  (i)  ensure  adequate \ninterdepartmental cooperation and interagency coordination, (ii) monitor the progress of project \nimplementation,  and  (iii)  coordinate  communication  with  ADB  and  agencies  concerned.  A \nproject implementation unit will be established in each subproject IA and will be responsible to \nthe respective IA for coordinating detailed implementation activities. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n37. \nThe Project will be implemented over a period of 5 years from 2006 until the end of 2010 \n(Appendix 6).  The  implementation  period  is  estimated  based  on  the  project  scope  and \nconstruction  technology  requirements.  This  schedule  is  considered  realistic  and  achievable \nbecause  the  project  implementation  structure  is  already  in  place  and  preparatory  works  are \nunder  way.  ADB\u2019s  successful  experience  with  similar  projects  in  the  PRC\u2014and  the  EA\u2019s  and \nIAs\u2019  in-depth  knowledge  and  experience  in  urban  environmental  improvement  projects  using \ninternational financing from the World Bank and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation\u2014\nalso indicate that the schedule is realistic and achievable. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n38. \nEquipment, materials and goods, and services financed under the loan will be procured \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and follow ADB procedures for international \ncompetitive  bidding  (ICB)  for  packages  each  with  a  value  greater  than  $1  million.  Packages \nvalued at $1 million or less will be procured following national competitive bidding or shopping \nprocedures as determined by the particular circumstances of the contract package. Civil works \ncontracts costing more than $10 million will be procured using ICB. Civil works contracts valued \nat  the  equivalent  of  $10  million  or  less  can  be  procured  using  national  competitive  bidding \nprocedures  in  accordance  with  the  PRC  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law  and  the  respective \nprocurement regulations acceptable to ADB.13 The selection and engagement of contractors will \nbe  subject  to  ADB  approval.14 Procurement  packages  are  provided  in  the  procurement  plan \n(Appendix 7). Major equipment will be purchased through ICB procedures and financed by the \nADB loan. The internationally tendered equipment packages will include the necessary technical \nsupport for ensuring proper installation, testing, commissioning, and training of operational staff \nas part of the related contracts. In accordance with ADB requirements, foreign contractors may \nparticipate in bid for national competitive bidding contracts. \n \n39. \nADB  approved  NMG\u2019s  request  for  advance  procurement  action  to  expedite  project \nimplementation. Advance action will include (i) prequalification of contractors, tendering, and bid \nevaluation  for  civil  works  packages;  and  (ii)  preparation  of  tender  documents  to  procure \nmaterials and equipment. The issuance of invitations to bid or to prequalify under the advance \nprocurement  action  will  be  subject  to  ADB  approval.  All  advance  procurement  actions  will  be \nundertaken in conformity with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The Government, NMG, and IAs \nwere advised that approval of advance procurement action does not commit ADB to finance the \nProject.  \n \n                                                 \n13  ADB.  1997.

The  consultants  will  undertake  (i)  project \nmanagement  and  implementation  support;  (ii)  efficient  operating  procedures;  (iii)  preventive \nmaintenance;  (iv)  financial  management;  (v)  social,  resettlement,  and  environmental  impacts \nmonitoring;  (vi)  business  planning  and  management \ninformation  system  development; \n(vii) human resources development; and (viii) corporate governance. The consultants will assist \nthe  PMO  in  questions  related  to  ADB  procedures  and  reporting,  procurement,  quality  control, \nstart-up  testing,  commissioning,  O&M,  and  implementation  of  the  project  performance \nmonitoring  system  (PPMS).  The  PMO  will  initiate  advance  action  for  the  recruitment  of \nconsultants, including the short-listing of qualified consultants. The international consulting firm \nwill  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  by  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  and  Its  Borrowers  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  international  consulting  firm  will  be  selected  in \naccordance  with  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  using  full  technical  proposal \nprocedures. Appendix 8 provides the outline terms of reference for consulting services. \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \n41. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998) was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  NMG  and  the \nIAs. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding \ndocuments  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the \nProject shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of NMG, IAs, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants and other service providers as \nthey  relate  to  the  Project.  For  the  Project,  NMG  will  undertake  the  following  anticorruption \nactions: (i) involve full-time officials from the municipal discipline investigation bureaus in bidding \nand  construction,  (ii)  introduce  a  dual-signing  system  in  which  the  civil  works  contract  winner \nalso  signs  an  anticorruption  contract  with  the  employer,  and  (iii)  periodically  inspect  the \ncontractor\u2019s activities related to fund withdrawals and settlements. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n42. \nThe  ADB  loan  funds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  procedures  set  out  in \nADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  To  expedite  project  implementation  through  timely \nrelease  of  loan  proceeds,  NMG  will  establish  an  imprest  account  promptly  after  loan \neffectiveness  at  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB.  Disbursements  from  the  imprest \naccount will be supported by an appropriate withdrawal application and related documentation. \nSuch documentation will demonstrate, among other things, that the goods and/or services were \nproduced in and procured from ADB\u2019s members, and are eligible for ADB financing. The initial \namount  to  be  deposited  in  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  the  estimated  expenditures  for \nthe  next  6  months,  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  The  ADB  statement  of \nexpenditures  procedure  may  be  used  for  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures.  Individual \npayments to be reimbursed or liquidated under the procedure will not exceed $200,000.15 It will \n\n                                                 \n15  Limits for the imprest account and statement of expenditures are in accordance with a recent review of ADB\u2019s PRC \n\nportfolio, and to facilitate improved efficiency in loan disbursement. \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nbe  a  condition  for  disbursement  of  the  loan  proceeds  for  any  subproject  that  the  Government \nsubmit to ADB the certification that (i) the onlending agreement for subproject has been entered \ninto between NMG and the IA concerned, and (ii) such onlending agreement contains the same \nfinancial terms and conditions as required in the loan agreement. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n43. \nThe  PMO  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports  indicating  (i)  progress  made, \n(ii) problems  encountered  during  the  period  under  review,  (iii)  steps  taken  or  proposed  to \nremedy the problems, (iv) the proposed program of activities, and (v) progress expected for the \nfollowing  6  months.  Within  3  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  the  PMO,  with \nsupport  from  the  IAs,  will  submit  to  ADB  a  completion  report  providing  (i)  details  about \nimplementation, (ii) actual costs incurred in relation to cost estimates, (iii) benefits, (iv) progress \nin the institutional area, and (v) other information that ADB may request. \n \n44. \nThe PMO will maintain records adequate to identify goods and services financed out of \nthe  loan  proceeds,  following  accounting  principles  and  practices  prescribed  by  the  PRC \naccounting  law.  The  law  requires  enterprises  to  prepare  financial  statements  and  follow \ninternationally accepted accounting standards. The IAs will maintain separate project accounts \nand records. The financial statements of the project accounts and the annual corporate financial \nstatements  for  the  IAs  will  be  subject  to  external  audit  by  (i)  the  Nanning  Municipal  Audit \nBureau,  (ii)  higher  level  government  auditors,  and  (iii)  certified  public  accountants.  The  audits \nwill be carried out in accordance with regulations for auditing approved by the State Council and \nthe  PRC\u2019s  independent  auditing  standards  issued  by  the  Chinese  Institute  of  Certified  Public \nAccountants,  and  ADB  requirements.  A  separate  auditor\u2019s  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest \naccount and statement of expenditure will be incorporated in the audit reports. The IAs\u2019 annual \naudited financial statements and audited project accounts will be submitted to ADB no later than \n6 months after the end of the fiscal year for the entire implementation period.16 The annual audit \nreports will include an auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the loan proceeds and compliance with the \nfinancial  covenants,  included  in  the  loan  and  project  agreements,  including  the  use  of  the \nimprest accounts and statement of expenditures procedures. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n45. \nThe PPMS indicators that have been agreed during project preparation include (i) public \nsatisfaction  with  the  urban  environment,  (ii)  relevant  economic  and  health  data  to  monitor \nproject impacts, (iii) incidence of seasonal flooding in the lower Xinxujiang and Kelijiang rivers \nwithin Xiangsihu New District, (iv) water quality in Xinxujiang and Kelijiang rivers, (v) solid waste \ntransportation efficiency, (vi) cleanliness of the city streets, (vii) expansion of green space, and \n(viii) increase in public awareness of environmental protection. The relevance and practicability \nof data collection for indicators was confirmed with the PMO.  \n \n46. \nAt the beginning of the Project, the PMO and IAs, with assistance from the consultants, \nwill develop PPMS procedures to generate data systematically on the inputs and outputs of the \nsubprojects,  as  well  as  the  agreed  socioeconomic,  environmental,  and  health  indicators  to  be \nused  to  measure  project  impacts.  The  PMO  will  (i)  refine  the  PPMS  framework,  (ii)  confirm \nachievable  targets,  (iii)  firm  up  monitoring  and  recording  arrangements,  and  (iv)  establish \nsystems and procedures no later than 6 months after loan effectiveness. \n\n                                                 \n16  IAs currently have three tiers of audit: (i) internal audit, (ii) municipal government level audit, and (iii) provincial and \n\nstate government level audit. \n\n\fUnder the PPMS framework, baseline and progress data will be reported at the requisite \n47. \ntime intervals by the IAs, including semiannual reporting of the environmental management plan \n(EMP).  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  analyzing  and  consolidating  the  data  through  its \nmanagement  information  system.  The  PPMS  will  be  designed  to  permit  adequate  flexibility  to \nadopt  remedial  action  for  project  design,  schedule,  activities,  and  development  impacts.  The \nPMO,  with  the  assistance  of  the  consultants,  will  monitor  and  assess  activities,  and  report  to \nADB quarterly on the physical implementation and financial aspects of the Project to ensure that \nimpacts are monitored and reported in line with ADB requirements. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n48. \nBesides  regular  ADB  review  missions,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  undertake  a \ncomprehensive  midterm  review  2  years  after  project  implementation  begins.  The  review  will \ninclude  a  detailed  evaluation  of  (i)  scope,  (ii)  implementation  arrangements,  (iii)  resettlement, \n(iv) achievement of scheduled targets, (v) progress of the agenda for policy reform and capacity \nbuilding  measures,  and  (vi)  reallocation  of  loan  proceeds  and  change  to  the  disbursement \npercentages. Feedback from the PPMS activities will be analyzed. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nEnvironmental Impacts and Benefits \n\n \nA. \n \n49. \nThe  Project  will  significantly  (i)  improve  water  quality  in  Xinxujiang  River  and  Kelijiang \nRiver;  (ii) enhance  the  safety  of  drinking  water  sources  in  downstream  Yongjiang  River;  and \n(iii) protect  the  quality  of  the  groundwater,  especially  in  shallow  aquifers.  The  improvement  of \nwater  quality  in  Xinxujiang  and  Kelijiang  rivers  is  subject  to  the  establishment  of  integrated \npolicies  and  procedures  for  water  quality  monitoring  and  management  in  these  rivers.  The \nProject will convert the current environmental hot spots affected by uncontrolled wastewater and \nsolid waste discharges in Kelijiang and Xinxujiang rivers into model green areas, improving the \ncity\u2019s environmental conditions and aesthetics.  \n \n50. \nThe  Project  will  enhance  the  quality  of  the  urban  environment  by  increasing  carbon \ndioxide absorption and oxygen release, through ecological upgrading of Qingxiushan Park. The \nProject will improve the environmental potential of Qingxiushan Park by (i) increasing the total \nbiomass and forest coverage rate, (ii) protecting and diversifying forest species and promoting \nresearch  to  ensure  forest  sustainability,  (iii)  enhancing  soil  conservation,  and  (iv)  promoting \npublic awareness programs for park visitors.  \n \n51. \nThe Project will construct wastewater collection systems that will significantly contribute \nto  the  city\u2019s  environmental  management,  subject  to  the  scheduled  completion  of  the  Jiangnan \nwastewater treatment plant and the connecting trunk sewers. The other necessary requirements \nare constructing branch sewer and sewer connections on time and developing appropriate O&M \nof  the  wastewater  collection  networks  by  relevant  NMG  agencies.  No  adverse  environmental \nimpacts  from  operations  of  the  Jiangnan  wastewater  treatment  plant  are  expected,  subject  to \nadequate provisions for its O&M, including appropriate sludge treatment and disposal.  \n \n52. \nThe Project will enhance the city\u2019s solid waste management capacity and efficiency. The \nintroduction of a modern mechanized municipal solid waste transfer system\u2014including new and \nupgraded  transfer  stations,  optimized  waste  hauling  operations,  and  the  improved  street \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nsweeping  capacity\u2014will  minimize  airborne  dust  and  nuisance  odors,  improve  community \nhygiene and sanitation by controlling insects and pests, and enhance the city\u2019s cleanliness. \n \n53. \nThe  Project  will  have  some  adverse  impacts  in  the  construction  phase,  including \nairborne  dust,  odor,  noise,  traffic  congestion,  waste  discharge  from  construction  camps,  \ndredged  materials,  removal  of  trees,  soil  erosion,  land  occupation,  damage  to  roads,  and \ninfectious  diseases.  Adverse  impacts  will  be  avoided  or  reduced  to  acceptable  levels  by \n(i) careful  selection  of  project  component  sites  and  spoil  disposal  sites  to  avoid  sensitive \nlocations;  (ii)  control  of  noise,  dust,  and  release  of  wastewater  during  construction;  (iii)  soil \nerosion  control  during  earthwork;  (iv)  odor  and  noise  control  during  operation;  and \n(v) landscaping  after  project  completion.  The  summary  environmental  impact  assessment \n(SEIA)  summarizes  environmental  impacts,  mitigation  measures,  and  monitoring  plans.  The \nEMP,  prepared  as  part  of  the  SEIA,  will  guide  environmental  mitigation  and  monitoring  under \nthe Project. The highlights of the SEIA are in Appendix 9. \n \nB. \n \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\n1. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement  \n\n \n54. \nThe  Xinxujiang  River  and  Kelijiang  River  environmental  upgrading  subprojects  will \ninvolve a relatively large amount of land acquisition and resettlement, and two full resettlement \nplans  (RPs)  have  been  prepared.  The  Qingxiushan  Park  ecological  upgrading  subproject  will \ninvolve  relatively  small  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  a  short  RP  has  been  prepared. \nFor  the  solid  waste  management  subproject,  22  small  plots  of  vacant  state-owned  land  which \nare not occupied by informal dwellers will be occupied permanently; since no land acquisition or \ndemolition  of  structures is  required, no  RP  was necessary. The  Project  will  affect  6  townships \nand  streets,  13  villages,  and  2  farms.  In  total,  1,918  households  with  6,585  persons  will  be \naffected directly by land acquisition and/or house demolition, among which 482 households and \n1,854  people  belong  to  the  floating  (rural  migrant)  population.  There  will  be  permanent \nacquisition of 184 ha of collective-owned land, 50 ha of state-owned land, 128 ha of land in river \ncourses, and temporary occupation of 5 ha of collective-owned land. There will be demolition of \n(i) 35,332 m2 of residential houses, (ii) 12,624 m2 of temporary buildings, and (iii) 14,850 m2 of \ninstitutional buildings. All those affected persons will be compensated and resettled in a timely \nand adequate manner in accordance with the RPs so that they will be at least as well off as they \nwould have been without the Project.  \n \nThe  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  compensation  policy  for  the  Project  is  based  on \n55. \nthe NMG\u2019s document17 and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. The draft RPs provide a \nsocioeconomic  profile  of  those  affected  persons  and  the  scope  of  the  impacts;  and  address \nissues  related  to  entitlements  for  compensation,  legal  framework,  public  consultations, \ngrievance  procedures,  rehabilitation  measures,  budget,  implementation  arrangements,  and \nmonitoring plan. The PMO and IAs implemented ADB\u2019s full disclosure policy for the resettlement \nactivities. The summary RP is in Appendix 10, including resettlement supervision milestones. \n \n\n                                                 \n17 NMG. 2004. Method of Collective Land Acquisition and Compensation for Housing Demolition on Collective Land. \n\nNanning. \n\n \n\n\fPoverty Reduction, Health, and Social Benefits \n\n2. \n \nAmong  the  beneficiaries,  the  poor18 in  the  project  impact  area  (PIA)  comprise  about \n56. \n217,000  (7.2%)  of  the  total  population.  An  improved  urban  environment  will  help  to  enable \npoverty reduction through (i) reduction of the incidence of infectious and waterborne and vector-\nborne diseases, (ii) improvement of investment conditions to attract more outside investment for \nlocal  development,  (iii)  creation  of  new  job  opportunities,  and  (iv)  development  of  tourism \nindustry.  As  a  result,  the  population  exposed  to  waterborne  and  vector-borne  diseases  will  be \nreduced, and the associated medical costs and number of workdays and school days lost due to \nsickness will be cut. Savings in medical costs will be greater for the poor, families with children, \nand  the  elderly,  as  they  are  most  vulnerable  to  such  diseases.  A  summary  poverty  reduction \nand social strategy is in Appendix 11. \n \n57. \nThe  PIA  has  a  population  of  3.03  million,  of  which  about  1  million  is  from  35  ethnic \nminority  groups.  The  main  ethnic  minority  groups  are  Zhuang  (95%)  and  Yao  (3.8%).  About \n1,805  persons  of  ethnic  minority  groups  will  be  affected  by  land  acquisition  and  resettlement. \nOther ethnic minorities, including Miao, Dong, and Hui, will not be affected by land acquisition \nand  resettlement.  The  social  assessment  report  showed  that  ethnic  minorities  are  highly \nassimilated  in  the  main  Han  group  in  terms  of  socioeconomic  characteristics,  religion,  social \nstatus,  education,  employment,  and  other  service  opportunities.  There  is  no  separate  or \notherwise specific zone within the PIA that is exclusively or predominantly inhabited by any of \nthe  ethnic  minorities,  and  all  ethnic  minorities  are  mixed  and  live  in  the  same  communities.19 \nImpact  and  special  measures  for  ethnic  minorities  are  included  in  the  RPs,  and  enhancement \nmeasures are in the social development action plan (SDAP). \n \nC. \n\nFinancial Aspects \n\nfor \n\nthe \n\ntwo \n\nrevenue-earning  subprojects \n\n58. \nThe discounted cash flow analysis based on incremental costs and benefits under with-\n(solid  waste \nand  without-project  scenarios \nmanagement  and  Qingxiushan  Park  ecological  upgrading  subprojects)  was  undertaken  in  real \nterms using constant 2005 prices. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) was computed on \nan  after-tax  basis.  The  FIRR  for  the  solid  waste  management  subproject  is  9.36%,  and  the \nQingxiushan Park ecological upgrading subproject FIRR is 7.87%. These exceed the weighted \naverage cost of capital (WACC) of 4% in real terms.  \n \n59. \nSensitivity  tests  were  carried  out  for  the  two  revenue-earning  subprojects.  The  solid \nwaste management subproject is relatively insensitive to adverse changes in financial revenues \n(decreases). Above a 19.1% decrease in the proposed revenues, the FIRR would be less than \nthe WACC of 4%. In the case that all three factors (revenues, investment costs, and O&M costs) \nchange adversely on the same scale at the same time, the FIRR and net present value would \nbe  relatively  sensitive.  Above  a  10.6%  change  in  these  combined  factors,  the  FIRR  would  be \nlower  than  the  WACC  of  4%.  For  the  Qingxiushan  Park  ecological  upgrading  subproject, \nrevenue  changes  for  sale  of  tree  seedlings  and  flowers,  visitors,  and  other  revenues  are \nrelatively  insensitive.  With  adverse  changes  less  than  17.5%  in  each  revenue  category,  the \n\n                                                 \n18 Includes both rural and urban poor. Rural poor refers to those with annual per capita income of less than CNY650. \nUrban poor refers to people who are under the minimum living standard scheme (MLSS). People under the MLSS \nwill  receive  social  assistance  from  the  civil  administrative  department.  MLSS  varies  in  different  counties  in  the \nGZAR.  The  MLSS  in  Nanning  City  was  CNY190  per  capita  per  month  in  2003  and  was  raised  to  CNY210  per \ncapita per month in 2005. \n\n19  The Zhuang and Han have coexisted peacefully for more than 1,000 years and there has been a high degree of \n\nintermarriages. \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\fFIRR is still satisfactory. In the case that all factors change adversely, the FIRR and net present \nvalue would be sensitive. Above an 11% change, the FIRR would be lower than WACC of 4%. \nSensitivity analysis indicates that the FIRRs for these two subprojects are robust under adverse \nconditions.  \n \n60. \nFinancial statement projections in nominal terms for the IAs for the two revenue-earning \nsubprojects  were  prepared  and  showed  satisfactory  results.  The  minimum  debt  service \ncoverage  ratios  and  acceptable  rates  of  return  on  equity  will  generally  be  achieved  by  the \nProject. The IAs have agreed to meet the minimum levels of financial performance, and these \nwill be included as loan covenants covering capital structure (debt to equity), debt service cover, \nand liquidity. Financial projections have estimated the tariffs required for an appropriate level of \nfinancial  performance.  The  ensuing  projected  tariff  rises  were  discussed  with  NMG  and  found \ngenerally  acceptable.  Periodic  tariff  reviews  will  be  required  to  overcome  the  risk  of  poor \nfinancial  performance  or  unexpected  changes  in  the  tariff  income.  The  overall  fiscal  impact \nresulting from the Project is expected to be positive, as various levels of government, including \ndistrict  governments  and  NMG,  are  investors  in  the  Project.  However,  the  shareholders,  and \nsubsequently  the  guarantor  of  the  ADB  loan,  will  take  some  financial  risk  during  construction \nand  in  the  first  few  years  of  operation.  Based  on  the  financial  analysis,  these  risks  are \nconsidered manageable. The O&M costs were estimated for each subproject. For the other two \nnon-revenue-earning subprojects (Xinxujiang River and Kelijiang River environmental upgrading \nsubprojects), NMG will ensure that adequate budgetary funds are transferred to cover the costs \nneeded for normal O&M. The financial analysis is in Appendix 12. \n \nD. \n\nFinancial Management Assessment \n\n61. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  on  all  the  IAs,  covering  the \nimplementation arrangements, sustainability, fiduciary risks, and mitigation strategy. The Project \nwill assist each IA to establish a sound and solid financial management system at the beginning \nof  project  implementation.  The  financial  management  system  will  be  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Governance and Financial Management of an ADB Investment Project. Each IA \nwill  keep  accounts  in  accordance  with  commercial  accounting  principles  and  subject  to \nindependent external audit by suitably qualified commercial or government auditors. Accounting \nwill  be  performed  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  PRC  accounting  standards,  which  largely \nfollow  international  norms.  All  IAs  will  meet  ADB  requirements  for  auditing  arrangements  and \nsubmit audited financial statements and project accounts to ADB annually. \n \nTo  ensure  accurate  and  timely  interpretation  of  the  IAs\u2019  financial  position  and \n62. \nperformance,  and  to  ensure  that  project  expenditures  are  used  for  the  purposes  stated  in  the \nloan  and  project  agreement  with  due  attention  to  considerations  of  economy  and  efficiency, \nfinancial  management  of  the  Project  should  be  consistent  with  PRC  national  accounting \nstandards.  The  Nanning  Financial  Bureau  will  provide  the  IAs  with  extensive  training  on \naccounting and financial management to strengthen accounting and financial management skills \nand procedures of the financial departments of the IAs. The 2006 training plan will cover training \non  accounting,  procedures  and  filing,  preparation  of  financial  statements,  government \nprocurement laws, and tax laws. \n \n63. \nOn  16  March  2001,  NMG  approved  the  procurement  administrative  regulation  and \nprocedures  for  projects  financed  by  international  financial  institutions.  The  regulation  is  based \non  the  government  notice  issued  by  the  Financial  Bureau  of  GZAR  on  detailed  disbursement \nprocedures  for  the  World  Bank-financed  Guangxi  Urban  Environment  Improvement  Project.  If \n\n16 \n\n \n\n\fnecessary,  NMG  will  issue  additional  regulations  to  further  strengthen  overall  management  of \nthe Project. \n \nE. \n\nEconomic Aspects \n\n64. \nThe  four  subprojects  will  generate  economic  benefits  for  the  urban  population  of \nNanning City. The Xinxujiang River and Kelijiang River environmental upgrading subprojects are \nexpected  to  generate  the  following  benefits:  (i)  cleaner  environment;  (ii)  reduction  and/or \navoidance  of  loss  of  life,  damage  to  properties,  and  disruption  in  economic  activities  due  to \nfloods; (iii) avoidance of loss in income and medical expenses because of diseases caused by \nwastewater  and  solid  waste  contamination  of  the  rivers;  (iv)  reduction  of  biological  oxygen \ndemand  (BOD)  and  chemical  oxygen  demand  (COD)  in  Yongjiang  River,  which  is  a  major \nsource of water supply for Nanning City; and (v) increase in land values. \n \n65. \nThe solid waste management subproject is expected to generate the following benefits: \n(i)  clean  environment,  (ii)  reduction  and/or  avoidance  of  floods  (as  a  result  of  reduced  solid \nwaste  in  rivers/canals/drainage  system),  and  (iii)  avoidance  of  loss  in  income  and  medical \nexpenses because of diseases produced by solid waste contamination. The Qingxiushan Park \necological upgrading subproject is aimed at countering the environmental imbalance caused by \nthe rapid urbanization of Nanning City and to reduce pollution in the park from the wastewater \ngenerated  by  park  visitors.  Benefits  from  this  subproject  include  (i)  reduced  soil  erosion,  (ii) \nincreased water retention, (iii) reduced carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide from the atmosphere, \n(iv) increased tourism, (v) income from the sale of tree seedlings and flowers, (vi) protection of \nunderground  water  (sewerage  component),  (vii)  increased  forest  stock,  (viii) reduced  worm \ndamage  in  trees  (because  of  proposed  improved  arboreal  mix),  and  (ix) reduced  damage  to \ntrees and flowers (because of proposed monitoring station and fire protection component). \n \n66. \nQuantitative  analysis  of  the  benefits  identified  showed  that  the  four  subprojects  will \ngenerate  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  of  24.0%  for  the  Xinxujiang  River \nenvironmental  upgrading,  22.1%  for  the  Kelijiang  River  environmental  upgrading,  11.1%  for \nsolid  waste  management,  and  12.6%  for  the  Qingxiushan  Park  ecological  upgrading \nsubprojects.20 The  Project  is  considered  economically  feasible  if  the  EIRR  is  equal  to  or  is \nhigher  than the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  (12%). In  economic  terms,  except  for  the \nsolid  waste  management  subproject,  all \nthe  subprojects  are  viable.  However,  when \nreduction/avoidance of flood damage21 (as a result of reduced solid waste in rivers, canals, and \ndrainage system) that can be attributed to the solid waste management subproject is quantified \nand  included  as  one  of  the  economic  benefits,  it  is  likely  that  the  EIRR  will  exceed  12%. \nDetailed economic analysis is in Appendix 13. \n \nF. \n\nProject Risks and Mitigation Measures \n\n67. \nThe  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual  technical  risks.  Conventional  engineering \ndesigns with proven records of reliable performance are  adopted for flood control, solid waste \nmanagement, and reforestation. The ICB equipment procurement will include technical support \nfor  installation,  testing,  and  commissioning  as  recommended  by  the  manufacturer.  During \nproject  implementation,  the  consultants  will  support  the  PMO  and  IAs  to  ensure  delivered \nequipment and works comply with the design requirements and quality standards. Based on the \n                                                 \n20  EIRR for the Xinxujiang and Kelijiang river subprojects will be revised downwards after incorporating the increases \n\nin resettlement costs. \n\n21  The  IA  estimated  that,  for  the  Xinxujiang  river  basin,  flood  damage  that  could  be  avoided  by  the  Project  is \n\nestimated at about CNY11.03 million per year. \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\fperformance  of  ADB\u2019s  PRC  portfolio,  cost  overruns  and  major  implementation  delays  are  not \nexpected. \n \n68. \nPotential  risks  include  (i)  inadequate  wastewater  treatment  and  solid  waste  disposal \ncapacities at the required time due to delays in the second phase of the Jiangnan wastewater \ntreatment  plant  upgrading  and  the  Chengnan  landfill  site  improvement  by  NMG,  and  the \nNanning city sewerage upgrading by the World Bank; (ii) possible delays in increasing the solid \nwaste  tariff  and  tariff  collection  rate;  (iii)  lack  of  customers\u2019  willingness  to  pay  the  increased \ntariffs;  (iv) lack  of  proper  O&M  of  project  facilities;  (v)  lack  of  IAs\u2019  capacity  to  carry  out  their \nresponsibilities; (vi) discontinuation of  enforcement of environmental standards; (vii)  change in \nexisting pollution control measures; (viii) lack of support from all levels of government agencies \nconcerned;  (ix)  delays  in  land  acquisition  and  resettlement;  and  (x) unforeseen  difficult \nconstruction  conditions.  Risk  (i)  is  being  mitigated  by  synchronizing  the  project  design  and \nimplementation schedules. Risks (ii) and (iii) are being mitigated by ensuring the financial and \nmanagerial  autonomy  for  the  solid  waste  management  company,  and  conducting  public \nconsultations to obtain public support for the tariff increase. Risks (iv) and (v) will be mitigated \nthrough  provision  of  institutional  capacity  building  for  the  IAs.  Risks  (vi),  (vii),  and  (viii)  will  be \nmitigated  through  regular  project  reviews.  Risks  (ix)  and  (x)  will  be  mitigated  through  support \nfrom the project management consultants and regular project monitoring. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government,  GZAR,  and  NMG  have  given \n\n \n69. \nthe following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nNMG  will  ensure  that  (a)  the  local  monitoring  at  Tianbao  reservoir,  Xinxujiang \nRiver,  and  Kelijiang  River  is  established  compatible  with  the  GZAR\u2019s  regional \nflood monitoring and control system, which is expected to be upgraded by 2010, \nfor the future integration;

Environmental needs include (i) reduction of seasonal flood risk in the lower part \nof Xinxujiang and Kelijiang rivers, (ii) improvement of wastewater and solid waste management, \nand (iii) expansion of the green environment throughout the city. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nWithout  the  Project,  the  (i)  flood  control  capacity  would  continue  to  be  weakened; \n(ii) surface  water  quality  would  continue  to  deteriorate  because  of  increased  volumes  of \nuntreated  wastewater  discharged  to  the  receiving  waters;  (iii)  municipal  solid  waste  collection, \ntransfer,  and  transportation  systems  would  remain  inefficient,  manually  based,  and  relatively \nexpensive;  and  (iv)  existing  woodland  would  deteriorate  because  of  lack  of  diversity  and  its \nvulnerability  to  diseases  and  forest  fires,  and  the  dominant  masson  pine  would  continue  to \ninhibit  the  growth  of  other  species.  Technical  alternatives  were  evaluated  for  (i) wastewater \ncollection  and  treatment  options;  (ii)  sewerage  pumping  schemes  and  sites;  (iii) river  flushing \nschemes; (iv) dredging, transportation, and disposal of river sediment; (v) number and locations \nof  solid  waste  transfer  stations;  and  (vi)  tree  planting  scales  at  Qingxiushan  Park,  taking  into \naccount technical and environmental requirements. \n \nC. \n \n3. \nThe Project will bring significant health benefits to about 650,000 directly affected people \nliving  in  the  project  area,  and  significantly  contribute  to  environmental  upgrading  of  Nanning \nCity. The Project will assist in achieving environmental management and pollution control goals \nand  targets,  including  pollutant  loads  reduction  and  surface  water  quality  classification  set  by \nthe plans and strategies set by the Nanning municipal government (NMG), GZAR, and central \nGovernment. The Project will assist NMG in its ongoing effort to promote the city as a green and \nenvironmental model city. \n \n4. \nThe Project will bring significant positive impacts to the safety and health of Nanning City \nresidents  and  assets  by  reducing  flooding  and  associated  pollution  and  health  hazards  in  the \nnorthwest  area  of  Nanning,  enabling  further  urban  expansion  in  the  area.  The  Project  will \nsignificantly (i) improve water quality in Xinxujiang and Kelijiang rivers; (ii) enhance the safety of \ndrinking water sources in downstream Yongjiang River; (iii) protect the quality of groundwater, \nespecially in shallow aquifers; and (iv) help the return of aquatic life in the project rivers. Water \nquality has been severely contaminated in both lower reaches of Kelijiang and Xinxujiang rivers, \nprimarily  from  direct  discharges  of  domestic  wastewater  and  surface  runoff  of  agricultural \nactivities  along  the  rivers.  The  main  pollutants  are  total  coliform,  chemical  oxygen  demand \n(COD),  nitrogen,  and  phosphorus.  Environmental  monitoring  conducted  during  the  project \nenvironmental impact assessment for Kelijiang River shows that the coliform bacteria group was \n78.0 times the applicable standard; ammonia nitrogen, 9.6 times; total phosphor, 1.9 times; and \nCOD, 1.8 times. Similarly, data for Xinxujiang River show that the coliform bacteria group was \n48.0 times  higher  than  the  standard;  ammonia  nitrogen,  5.5  times;  total  phosphor,  0.45  times; \nand  COD,  1.5  times.  It  is  expected  that  the  Project  will  reduce  the  total  chemical  oxygen \ndemand by potassium dichromate method (CODcr) load by about 2,200 ton per year (t/yr), total \nbiological oxygen demand (BOD5) load by 557 t/yr, and total ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) load by \n393  t/yr  in  Xinxujiang  and  Kelijiang  rivers.  The  pollution  discharge  reduction  to  the  Nanning \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n41 \n\nsection of Yongjiang River is anticipated to be 16,250 t/yr for COD and 1,270 t/yr for ammonia \nnitrogen  (NH3-N)  by  2010.  The  Project  will  also  assist  the  development  of  the  citywide \nautomatic  water  quality  monitoring  system  to  establish  modern  integrated  water  quality \nmanagement.  The  Project  will  convert  the  current  environmental  hot  spots  affected  by \nuncontrolled wastewater and solid waste discharges in Kelijiang and Xinxujiang rivers and their \nvicinity into model green areas, improving the city\u2019s environmental conditions and aesthetics.  \n \n5. \nThe Project will enhance the city\u2019s solid waste management efficiency. The introduction \nof  a  modern  mechanized  municipal  solid  waste  transfer  system\u2014including  new  and  upgraded \ntransfer stations, optimized waste hauling operations, and improved street sweeping capacity\u2014\nwill minimize airborne dust and nuisance odors, improve community hygiene and sanitation by \ncontrolling insects and pests, and enhance the city\u2019s cleanliness and aesthetics. \n \n6. \nThe  Project  will  enhance  the  quality  of  the  urban  environment  by  increasing  carbon \ndioxide absorption and oxygen release through upgrading of Qingxiushan Park. The Project will \nimprove the environmental potential of Qingxiushan Park by (i) increasing the total biomass and \nforest  coverage  rate,  (ii)  protecting  and  diversifying  forest  species  and  promoting  research  to \nensure forest sustainability, (iii) enhancing soil conservation, and (iv) promoting the use of the \npark for city residents. The annual forest water conservation capacity is estimated to increase \nby  about  71,522  t.  A  total  of  4,531  t  of  soil  will  be  conserved  from  erosion.  The  forest  carbon \nholding  capacity  will  increase  by  about  173.7  t/yr,  equivalent  to  636.9  t/yr  of  carbon  dioxide \nremoved from air. The amount of oxygen generated by the increased green area will be 541.4 \nt/yr and reduce 210 t/yr of airborne dust. \n \nD. \n \n7. \nAdverse impacts generated by the Project during construction will include airborne dust, \nodor,  noise,  traffic  congestion,  waste  discharge  from  construction  camps,  dredged  materials, \nremoval  of  trees,  soil  erosion,  land  occupation,  damage  to  roads,  and  infectious  diseases. \nAdverse impacts will be avoided or reduced to acceptable levels by taking appropriate mitigation \nand  compensation  measures.  Such  measures  will  cover  (i)  a  careful  selection  of  project \ncomponent sites and spoil disposal sites to avoid sensitive locations; (ii) control of noise, dust, \nand  release  of  wastewater  during  construction;  (iii)  soil  erosion  control  during  earthwork; \n(iv) odor and noise control during operation; and (v) landscaping after project completion. With \nthe appropriate and full implementation of the mitigation measures, the adverse impacts of the \nProject are expected to be minimized and reduced to acceptable levels.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\nPotential Negative Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n \n\nBackground \n\nA. \n \nThe  Guangxi  Nanning  Urban  Environmental  Upgrading  Project  consists  of  four \n1. \nsubprojects:  (i)  Xinxujiang  River  environmental  upgrading  (Xinxujiang  River  subproject), \n(ii) Kelijiang  River  environmental  upgrading  (Kelijiang  River  subproject),  (iii)  solid  waste \nmanagement  (solid  waste  subproject),  and  (iv)  Qingxiushan  Park  ecological  upgrading \n(Qingxiushan Park subproject).  \n\n2. \nThe  Kelijiang  and  Xinxujiang  subprojects  will  involve  a  relatively  large  amount  of  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement.  Two  full  resettlement  plans  (RPs)  have  already  been  prepared \nbased on Asian Development Bank (ADB) requirements. Qingxiushan Park will involve relatively \nsmall land acquisition and resettlement, so a short RP has been prepared. For the solid waste \nsubproject, 2.7 hectares (ha) of vacant state-owned land will be transferred to the Implementing \nAgency  (IA);  since  no  persons  are  affected,  no  RP  is  necessary.  All  persons  affected  by  the \nProject  will  be  eligible  for  compensation  and  assistance.  The  cutoff  date  for  eligibility  for \ncompensation and assistance will be the date when the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region \nDevelopment  and  Reform  Commission  approves  the  project  feasibility  study,  which  will  be \nannounced  to  all  affected  persons  immediately  afterward.  When  the  detailed  engineering  of \neach subproject has been finalized, if necessary, the RPs will be updated on the basis of any \ndesign changes. \n\nResettlement Impacts \n\nB. \n \n3. \nTo  avoid  or  minimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  there  was  close  consultation \nwith  local  officials  and  village  committees  and/or  street  committees  during  the  preliminary  and \nfinal  feasibility  study  stages.  The  proposed  Project  will  affect  6  townships/streets,  13  villages \nand  2 farms  in  Yongxin  District,  High  Technology  New  District,  Chengbei  District,  and  Qingxiu \nDistrict  of  Nanning  City.  The  affected  villages  can  be  classified  as  \u201cvillage  in  city\u201d;  many  have \nlimited  farmland  due  to  urbanization,  and  households  derive  most  of  their  income  from \nnonagricultural activities, and supplement their incomes by renting farmland or housing.  \n\n4. \nIn total, 1,918 households with 6,585 persons will be directly affected by land acquisition \nand/or house demolition, among which 482 households and 1,854 people belong to the floating \n(rural migrant) population. Details by project component are shown in Table A10. \n\nTable A10:  Summary of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n\nPermanent Land Acquisition \n\nBuilding Demolition \n\nTempo-\nrary  \nLand \nOccu-\npation \n\nLand in \nRiver  \nCourses\n(ha) \n\nProject \nComponent \n\nState-\nOwned  \n\nCollective-\nOwned  \n\nLiving \nhouses \n\nInstitution  Simple \nhouses \n\n (ha) \n\n(ha) \n\n (ha) \n\n(m2) \n\n(m2) \n\n(m2) \n\n(H.H.) \n\n(H.H.) \n\nKelijiang \n\nXinxujiang \n\nQingxiushan \n\nSolid Waste  \n\n25.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n21.92 \n\n2.70 \n\n33.80 \n\n91.87 \n\n58.00 \n\n0.00 \n\nTotal \nha = hectare, m2 = square meter, H.H. = households \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n183.67 \n\n49.62 \n\n128 \n\n8,277 \n\n14,850 \n\n82 \n\n46 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n2.47 \n\n2.60 \n\n0.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n26,455 \n\n600 \n\n0 \n\n11,118 \n\n1,506 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n578 \n\n1,286 \n\n54 \n\n0 \n\n204 \n\n278 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n5.07\n\n35,332\n\n14,850\n\n12,624 \n\n1,918 \n\n482\n\nDirectly \nAffected \nHouse- \nHolds \n\nDirectly \nAffected \nFloating \nHouse-\nholds \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n43 \n\nIn  total,  about  361.4  ha  of  land  will  be  permanently  acquired  by  the  Project,  of  which \n5. \n51%  is  classified  collective  land.  In  addition,  5.07  ha  of  farmland  will  be  occupied  temporarily \nduring the construction phase. Structures to be demolished include 35,332 square meters (m2) \nof  rural  houses,  4  institutions  with  14,850  m2  of  institutional  buildings, and  12,624  m2  of  basic \nhouses  which  are  mainly  rented  or  owned  by  the  floating  population  for  living  and  breeding \nanimals.  \n \nC. \n\nPolicy and Legal Framework \n\n6. \nFor people unavoidably affected, the resettlement objective is to achieve equal or better \nincome and living standards in line with laws and regulations of the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC)  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement.  Compensation  for  permanent  land  loss \nand house demolition is based on the (i) Land Administration Law of the PRC, 2004; (ii) State \nCouncil Decision to Deepen Reform and Strictly Enforce Land Administration (Document No. 28 \ndated  November  2004);  (iii)  Method  of  Collective  Land  Acquisition  and  Compensation  for \nHousing  Demolition  on  Collective  Land  (Nanning  Municipal  Government  [NMG]  Document \nNo. 106,  effective  22  November  2004);  and  (iv)  Management  Method  of  Urban  Housing \nDemolition of Nanning City, (NMG Document No. 17, effective 1 July 2003). \n\n7. \nBased  on  consultations  with  local  governments  and  affected  persons,  and  general \npractice in the project counties and/or cities, a set of resettlement principles was adopted by the \nproject  IAs:  (i)  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement  should  be  avoided  or  minimized \nwhere feasible by developing and comparing a series of design alternatives; (ii) compensation \nand  entitlements  provided  are  based  on  market  value  or  replacement  value  and  must  be \nadequate to allow affected persons to at least maintain their pre-project standard of living, with \nthe prospect of improvement; (iii) land temporarily occupied and the disruption period are to be \nkept  to  a  minimum;  (iv)  all  affected  persons,  registered  and  non-registered,  are  entitled  to \ncompensation  and  assistance;  (v)  where  remaining  farmland  per  capita  is  not  sufficient  to \nmaintain food supply, other income-generating activities will be provided; (vi) special measures \nwill be provided to vulnerable groups and floating populations, such as assignment of economic \nhousing, transfer assistance, training, and employment placement; (vii) all affected persons will \nbe  adequately  informed  about  eligibility,  compensation  rates  and  standards,  livelihood  and \nincome-restoration plans, and project timing; and (viii) implementation will be closely monitored \nto identify and resolve problems in a timely manner.  \n \n8. \nFor  land acquisition,  the  land  compensation  will  be  paid  to  the  affected  village  and  the \nresettlement subsidy will be paid to the affected households. The land compensation standards \nare quite high, reflecting the proximity to the urban center. For institutions, compensation will be \npaid  to  owners  who  are  responsible  for  rehabilitating  the  affected  persons.  Compensation \npayments will be made in cash according to the appraised value of the land and fixed property \nassets. Compensation for standing crops, tress, other attachments, and temporary impacts will \nbe  paid  directly  to  affected  persons.  Income  losses  resulting  from  reduced  production  and/or \nsales and wages caused by the Project will be assessed and compensated in cash. \n\nThe new Kelijiang Road started construction adjacent to the Kelijiang River subproject in \n9. \nJuly  2005  and  will  be  completed  by  the  end  of  2006.  Since  this  construction  involves \nembankment next to the river, there is some overlap between the land and housing impacted by \nboth  projects.  The  roads  required  acquisition  of  about  16.2  ha  of  land  and  to  date  86  houses \nhave  been  demolished.  This  project  is  under  the  same  IA,  and  the  land  acquisition  and \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nResettlement and Rehabilitation \n\nresettlement  have  followed  the  NMG\u2019s  document. 1 Further  due  diligence  was  conducted  to \nensure  that  affected  persons  are  satisfied  with  the  resettlement;  this  diligence  report  was \nincluded as an annex to the RP for Kelijiang River subproject. \n \nD. \n  \n10. \nTo  minimize  the  resettlement  impacts  to  affected  persons  and  restore  their  living \nstandards, the detailed programs of restoration and relocation have been arranged in the RPs. \nPeople  can  choose  the  available  programs  according  to  their  requirements.  According  to  the \neconomic  characteristics  of  affected  villages,  different  schemes  for  income  restoration  will  be \ncarried  out.  The  compensation  is  to  be  used  for  village  income-generating  activities,  such  as \nexpansion  of  small  businesses,  and  building  commercial  and  residential  houses  for  renting; \naffected  persons  will  share  the  benefit  from  these  investments.  Additional  strategies  and \nmeasures \nland  base  allocation, \n(ii) provision  of  employment  for  project  construction,  and  (iii)  provision  of  skills  training  and \nassistance for employment information and placement. Although the project impacts on incomes \nare  not  serious,  these  measures  will  ensure  that  all  affected  persons  can  maintain  or  acquire \nmore stable incomes to restore and enhance their living standards.  \n\nfor  seriously  affected  villages \n\ninclude  (i)  commercial \n\n11. \nRegarding house demolition, registered structures will be compensated at market prices \nand non-registered structures will be compensated  at replacement cost. Affected villagers can \nchoose  to  purchase  commercial  houses,    exchange  properties,  or  rebuild  houses  with  free \nhouse sites. To improve residents\u2019 living standards, Nanning City is constructing budget housing \nwithin  Xiangsihu  New  District  which  cost  only  CNY1,033/m2.  According  to  the  project  policy \nframework,  the  compensation  for  housing  will  range  from  CNY1,090/m2  to  CNY1,800/m2,  so \naffected persons will have enough money to purchase new or secondhand houses. \n\n12. \nIn addition, special attention will be paid to resettlement and rehabilitation of the floating \npopulation  and  vulnerable  groups.  Since  the  floating  population  only  has  1-year  land  lease \ncontracts  and  their  temporary  structures  are  simple  or  leased,  the  proposed  compensation \nentitlements are fair (normally no compensation is required by law). However, the amount they \nobtain will be quite small so they will receive the following special measures: (i) transition and \nmoving  allowances,  (ii)  assistance  to  apply  for  budget  housing,  (iii) arrangement  of  low-rent \nhousing,  (iv)  provision  of  free  skills  training  and  employment  information  and  guidance,  and \n(v) arrangement of rental spaces for commercial activities.  \n\nResettlement Cost and Fund Management  \n\nE. \n \n13. \nThe  cost  estimate  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  CNY727.8  million  in  2005 \nprices, including contingencies and land taxes; this is equivalent to $89.7 million (41.7% of total \nproject cost). The land acquisition and resettlement cost are included as part of the total project \ncost  and  will  be  funded  by  the  NMG.  According  to  the  compensation  policies  and  standards \ndefined in the RPs, the payment and usage of compensation funds will be carried out under the \nsupervision  of \ninternal  monitoring  agencies  with  regular  audit  reviews.  Detailed \nmeasurement surveys will be conducted in each village and enterprise; and the compensation \ncontracts  will  be  negotiated  and  signed  with  village  committees,  households,  and  enterprises. \nFinal costs will be adjusted on this basis. \n\nthe \n\n                                                 \n1   NMG. 2004.

On various occasions during meetings, interviews, focus group discussions, public \nconsultation  workshops,  and  community  consultation  meetings,  local  representatives  have \nparticipated  in  the  planning,  and  concerns  have  been  integrated  into  the  RPs.  In  September \n2005, the draft RPs were publicized in Nanning Newspaper and placed in the Nanning library. In \nNovember  2005,  the  draft  final  RPs  were  disclosed  to  the  13  villages  and  2  farms,  and \nresettlement information booklets provided to affected households on 10 December 2005. The \ndraft RPs will be posted on the ADB web site prior to loan appraisal and the approved RPs will \nbe posted by the date of approval by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors. The respective project IAs will \nestablish  project  resettlement  units  for  (i)  supervising  implementation,  (ii)  continuing  public \nconsultation, (iii) monitoring progress, and (iv) responding to grievances. The grievance redress \nprocedures are well established and explanations are explained in the RPs. \n\n(PMO)  will  assume  overall \n\nThe  project  management  office \n\nImplementation Arrangement and Schedule \n\nG. \n \n15. \nfor \nimplementing  resettlement.  A  resettlement  office  within  the  PMO  will  coordinate  the  planning, \nimplementation,  financing,  and  reporting  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  subproject \nresettlement  offices,  which  are  set  up  under  the  IAs,  will  take  primary  responsibility  for  the \nresettlement consultation, implementation, and timely delivery of entitlements. The resettlement \nimplementation  schedule  was  prepared  based  on  the  overall  project  preparation  and \nconstruction timetable. No land acquisition or demolition shall start until RPs are updated based \non  designs  and  approved  by  ADB.  It  is  anticipated  that  land  acquisition  will  start  in  July  2006 \nand  be  completed  by  the  end  of  2007.  Housing  relocation  will  start  from  early  2006,  re-\ndesignation of collective land to commercial land use and subsequent development will be done \nby the end of 2006, and full restoration of livelihoods and living conditions will be achieved by \nthe end of 2007.  \n\nresponsibility \n\nH. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n16. \nInternal  and  external  monitoring  of  resettlement  implementation  will  be  conducted. \nInternal  supervision  and  monitoring  will  be  done  by  each  IA  to  ensure  compliance  with  the \nprovisions  of  the  RP.  The  PMO  and  IAs  will  engage  an  independent  agency  for  semiannual \nmonitoring  and  annual  evaluation  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  until  2  years  after  the \ncompletion  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  External  monitoring  reports  will  be  forwarded \ndirectly to both the PMO and ADB. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \n\nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n  Yes \n    No \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n Yes \n  No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \nThe  project  impact  area  (PIA)  covers  Xiangsihu  district,  Qingxiu  district, Xinning  district,  Xincheng  district,  Chengbei \ndistrict, Yongxin district, Yongning district, and Wuming county of Nanning City. The total project beneficiaries are 3.03 \nmillion,  which  is  equivalent  to  47%  of  the  total  population  of  Nanning  City.  The  Project  will  enhance  the  urban \nenvironment and public health in Nanning City through (i) improved flood control, (ii) improved wastewater and solid \nwaste  management,  and  (iii)  expanded  green  environment.  Improved  urban  environment  will  provide  an  enabling \nenvironment for poverty reduction through (i) improved health status and well-being of urban residents by reducing the \nincidence  of  infectious  and  waterborne  diseases;  (ii)  improved  investment  conditions  which  will  help  attract  more \noutside investment for local development, create new job opportunities, accelerate the construction of city ecological \nsystem;  and  (iii)  improved  Yongjiang  River  water  environment  and  developed  tourism  industry  in  Nanning  City.  The \nProject will also provide more job and investment opportunities to increase people\u2019s income. During construction, the \nProject will create about 11,400 person-years of work; 40% will be unskilled work. Some 60% of the unskilled work will \nbe targeted at the poor, totaling 3,990 person-years at total wages of CNY17.56 million or CNY4,400 per person-year. \nPriority  will  be  given  to  women,  people  affected  by  resettlement,  ethnic  minorities,  and  other  vulnerable  groups.  In \naddition,  during  construction,  480  person-years  of  local  jobs  will  be  created  in  the  provision  of  construction  material \nwith total wages of CNY3.8 million or annual average wages of CNY7,920 per capita. After project construction, about \n420 additional jobs will be created with total wages of CNY4.54 million annually or CNY108.96 million during the 24-\nyear operation period. \nA  health  impact  analysis  was  conducted  to  estimate  the  health  benefits  associated  with  improved  flood  control, \nwastewater  and  solid  waste  management,  and  expanded  green  environment.  In  estimating  the  potential  health \nbenefits  (savings)  attributable  to  the  Project,  an  assumption  of  40%  reduction  in  waterborne  and  vector-borne \ndiseases  was  used.a  Under  the  \u201cwithout-project\u201d  scenario,  it  is  projected  that  the  incidence  of  water-related  health \ncosts  will  (i)  increase  in  real  terms  with  increasing  urbanization,  (ii)  increase  untreated  wastewater  and  solid  waste \nvolumes,  and  (iii)  increase  pollution  of  receiving  water  bodies  and  general  deterioration  in  the  urban  environment \nbecause  of  lack  of  effective  wastewater  and  solid  waste  management  services.  So,  it  has  been  conservatively \nassumed that health costs will increase by about 5% annually from 2006 to 2032. Health benefits have been estimated \nfor  the  \u201dwith-project\u201d  scenario,  starting  to  accrue  from  2010  (the  Project\u2019s  first  full  operations  year).  As  a  result  of \nimproved  environmental  pollution  control,  the  population  exposed  to  pollution-related  diseases  will  be  reduced,  with \nthe associated reduction in medical costs and drop in number of workdays and school days lost due to sickness. The \nestimated potential annual health benefits attributable to the Project will be CNY2.0 million in 2010 and CNY4.8 million \nin  2032.  The  net  present  value  of  health  benefits  that  is  attributable  to  the  Project  during  the  period  2010\u20132032  is \nestimated at CNY14.6 million. The benefit of savings in direct medical costs to children, elderly, women, and poor will \nbe  greater  as  they  are  most  vulnerable  to  the  diseases.  Women  have  more  contact  with  water  from  household \nresponsibilities (especially cooking and washing), so they will benefit disproportionately from the improvement in water \nquality, sanitation, and urban environment as a result of the Project. The poor live under unsanitary conditions, so they \nwill gain more than the average population in terms of better environmental and living conditions. \nFor  the  full  health  benefits  to  be  realized,  the  following  will  be  required:  (i)  parallel  improvements  in  public  health \neducation, (ii) higher standards of personal hygiene, (iii) prevention and control, and (iv) improved housing and living \nconditions.  These  will  be  particularly  important  for  the  poor,  who  are  likely  to  suffer  most  from  the  incidence  of \npollution-related  diseases.  The  arrangements  for  monitoring  health  benefits  will  be  incorporated  in  the  project \nperformance management system (PPMS) to be established for comprehensive project impact monitoring. A detailed \nhealth impact analysis is in Supplementary Appendix G. The qualitative benefits of the Project will be (i) reduced risk \nof  exposure  to  waterborne  diseases  associated  with  treatment  of  a  greater  proportion  of  wastewater  and  reduced \nsewer  overflows,  and  less  water  bodies  receiving  wastewater  pollutants;  (ii)  reduced  risks  of  exposure  to  filth-  and \nvector-borne diseases and offensive odor because of collection and treatment of a greater proportion of solid waste, \nreduction  of  pollution  and  offensive  odor  of  the  transit  stations,  reduction  of  garbage  spillover  in  the  streets,  and \nreduction  of  groundwater  contamination;  and  (iii)  increased  forestry  coverage  at  Qingxiushan  Park,  which  will \ncontribute to reduce soil erosion, increase the carbon holding capacity, and release more oxygen.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n47 \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nIn the PRC, income is used as the main indicator to measure poverty. In 2003, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region \n(GZAR) had its absolute poverty line set at CNY650 net income per capita per year. The standard of low-income rural \nresidents is CNY651\u2013950 per capita per year. By these definitions, a total of 0.96 million are among the absolute poor \nand  4.93  million  are  low-income  rural  residents.  In  2003,  there  were  317  poverty  villages  in  Nanning  with  a  total  of \n474,000 rural poor, accounting for 9.9% of Nanning\u2019s total population or 8.05% of rural poor in the GZAR. Among the \nrural poor in Nanning City, 75,800 live in absolute poverty and 398,200 are low-income rural residents. \nCompared with the GZAR and Nanning City, the rural poor in the PIA is minor but the urban poor is higher. The main \ncause is that the PIA is located in the urban and suburban areas of Nanning and the people who live there have more \naccess to income-earning opportunities. The incidence of rural poverty measured as per capita income below CNY950 \nin  the  PIA  is  about  0.14  million  (8.1%  of  the  rural  population  or  4.6%  of  the  total  PIA  population).  Absolute  poverty \n(less than CNY650) is 0.02 million (1.2%).  \nUnlike the rural poverty definition, there is no uniform standard for the urban poverty line. In general, people under the \nminimum living standard scheme (MLSS) are defined as urban poor. The urban poor mostly consist of people with no \nincome,  no  capacity  to  work,  no  legal  support,  or  no  ability  to  work.  People  under  the  minimum  MLSS  will  receive \nsocial assistance from the civil administrative department. The MLSS varies in different counties in the GZAR. In 2003, \nthe MLSS was CNY190 per capita per month in Nanning. The number of people under the MLSS is 85,924, which is \n6.1%  of  the  urban  population.  The  urban  poor  in  the  PIA  is  about  73,000  (5.6%)  of  the  total  PIA  population.  The \nproportion of urban poverty in part of the PIA, particularly for the Kelijiang River environmental upgrading subproject, is \nhigher than the Nanning City and GZAR average because a large number of the floating population lives on riparian \nland. \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nStakeholder analysis and the role of each stakeholder are identified. The main stakeholders of the Project are urban \nresidents;  farmers;  floating  population;  waste  collectors;  street  sweepers;  implementing  agencies  (IAs)  such  as  the \nNanning  Investment  and  Development  Company,  Nanning  Xiangsihu  Investment,  Construction  and  Development \nCompany, Nanning Shixi Solid Waste Treatment Company, and Nanning Qingxiu Mountain Scenic and Tourist Resort \nDevelopment  Company;  executing  agency,  i.e.,  the  Nanning  Municipal  Government  (NMG);  and  secondary \nstakeholders such as the All-China Women\u2019s Federation, Civil Affairs Bureau, etc. During the project design, a variety \nof  participatory  approaches\u2014such  as  participatory  rural  appraisal,  workshops,  focus  group  discussions,  meetings, \ninterviews,  and  surveys\u2014were  employed  to  gain  a  better  understanding  of  the  demand,  needs,  and  interests  of  the \nstakeholder, particularly groups that are normally excluded from the decision making process. \nIs there a participation strategy? \nLocal  district  and  county  governments  and  communities  will  assist  each  IA  in  (i)  acquiring  land;  (ii)  implementing \nresettlement  plans  (RPs),  the  social  development  action  plan  (SDAP),  and  environmental  management  plan  (EMP); \nand (iii) organizing local labor construction to ensure the participation and benefit of the Project to the poor, women, \nfloating population, and other vulnerable people. Local people, particularly affected people and ethnic minority groups, \nwill  continue  to  be  involved  in  the  consultation  and  participation  process,  especially  in  the  implementation  of  RPs, \nSDAP,  and  EMP.

Women in the PIA perceived \nthat  the  Project  will  (i)  improve  the  environment,  (ii)  bring  new  development  opportunities,  (iii)  create  employment \nopportunities, and (iv) reduce the incidence of waterborne and vector-borne diseases. Discussion with representatives \nof the All-China Women\u2019s Federation indicated that women will need some assistance to fully benefit from the Project. \nThe  poverty  and  social  assessment  indicated  that  (i)  in  rural  areas,  women  primarily  engage  in  agriculture;  while  in \nurban  areas,  they  engage  in  service  industries  and  small  business;  and  (ii)  male  members  of  poor  households  and \nfloating  population  tend  to  travel  further  for  migrant  labor  opportunities  than  nonpoor  males,  leaving  behind  a  high \npercentage of households headed by women. To maximize the Project\u2019s impact on women, they will be given priority \nfor  project-generated  employment  during  construction  and  operation  of  the  project  facilities.  The  rise  in  female \nparticipation  in  the  labor  market  will  increase  women\u2019s  net  income\u2014improving  overall  family  welfare  and  increasing \nthe status of women.

Detailed discounted cash flow analysis and financial \nstatements are in Supplementary Appendix I.  \n \nB. \n\nSolid Waste Management Subproject and Qingxiushan Park Ecological Upgrading \nSubproject \n\n \nFor  the  solid  waste  management  subproject  and  the  Qingxiushan  Park  ecological \n2. \nupgrading subproject, the financial benefit-cost analysis\u2014financial discounted cash flow (DCF) \nanalysis\u2014was  conducted  in  real  terms  to  determine  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital \n(WACC),  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR),  financial  net  present  value  (FNPV),  and \naverage incremental financial cost (AIFC) (if applicable), to assess the financial viability of each \nsubproject and  the  incremental  tariff  required.  Financial statement  projections  were developed \nin nominal price terms for the implementing agencies (IAs) for these two subprojects (Nanning \nShixi Solid Waste Treatment Company and the Nanning Qingxiu Mountain Scenic and Tourist \nResort Development Company) to (i) project the financial performance of the IAs, (ii) assess the \nprofitability and debt service ability, and (iii) test the tariff required for the IAs to raise funds for \nproject  construction  and  achieve  full  cost  recovery  during  the  operation  period.  Purchasing \npower parity is the base assumption. \n\n1. \n\nSolid Waste Management Subproject \n\n \n\n3. \nThe  Nanning  Environment  and  Sanitation  Division  is  responsible  for  collecting  solid \nwaste revenue, which is subsequently transferred to a special bank account established by the \nNanning Financial Bureau. Sixty-eight percent of the solid waste revenue will be allocated to the \nNanning  Environmental  and  Sanitation  Division  to  finance  capital  investment,  and  cover \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  and  other  expenses.  The  proposed  budget  should  be \nsubmitted  to  the  Nanning  Finance  Bureau  for  approval  before  using  the  solid  waste  revenue. \nThe Shixi Solid Waste Treatment Company, incorporated on 8 July 2004, will be responsible for \nfinancing, constructing, and operating the solid waste management subproject.  \n \nThe Nanning municipal government (NMG) introduced a new tariff system on urban solid \n4. \nwaste  in  July  2003.  The  solid  waste  tariff  will  be  levied  on  the  urban  solid  waste  discharged, \ncovering various categories including construction waste but excluding hazardous and industrial \nwaste. The NMG plans to progressively increase the solid waste tariff in the coming years. From \n10  July  2003  to  9  July  2005,  each  urban  household  was  charged  CNY7.0  per  month  on  solid \nwaste,  CNY7.5  per  month  per  household  from  10  July  2005  to  9  July  2007,  and  CNY8.0  per \nmonth  per  household  from  10  July  2007  onward.  Floating  population,  institutions,  public  and \nprivate  establishments,  and  commercial  and  manufacturers  have  also  been  levied  charges  on \nsolid waste.  \n \n5. \nWhile the new tariff system is an important step, it is crucial to strengthen tariff collection \nin accordance with government regulations to ensure the commercial viability of the solid waste \nutilities. Current solid waste tariff revenue collection rates and amounts by consumer categories \nwere determined to establish a reasonable basis for solid waste revenue projection and further \nanalysis.  In  2004,  the  solid  waste  revenue  collected  from  urban  households  was  CNY15.25 \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nmillion,  with  an  estimated  collection  rate  of  about  45%;  revenue  collected  from  the  floating \npopulation  was  CNY0.12  million,  with  an  estimated  collection  rate  of  only  about  1.1%;  and \nrevenue collected from all other consumer categories was CNY8.36 million. \n\nThe solid waste revenue collection rate from urban households is assumed to improve \n6. \nfrom 45% in 2004 to 55% in 2005, 60% in 2008, and 65% in 2011 and onward; the collection \nrate from the floating population is assumed to improve from the current significantly low level of \n1.1%  in  2004  to  5.0%  in  2005,  8.0%  in  2008,  and  10.0%  in  2011  and  onward;  solid  waste \nrevenues  from  all  other  user  categories  are  assumed  to  increase  5.0%  annually  from  2005, \n6.5% from 2008, and 8.0% from 2011. Of the 68% of solid waste revenues being transferred to \nthe Nanning Environment and Sanitation Division, 55% is assumed to be transferred to the IA \n(only 50% in 2008 as only 20% production capacity will be used at the end of 2008). The annual \ntransferred amount will remain constant at CNY17 million in real terms in 2012 and onward, with \nthe actual transferred percentage decreased from 55% to 51% in 2012, and further decreased \nto  only  21%  in  2032.  The  above  assumptions  on  project  revenues  are  based  on  overall \ncomputation to achieve full cost recovery in the DCF analyses for the subproject and financial \nstatement  projections  for  the  IA,  and  to  limit  the  transferred  percentage  of  the  solid  waste \nrevenues  to  the  IA  in  order  for  the  balance  of  the  solid  waste  revenues  being  used  for  other \nsolid waste treatment facilities in the city. \n\nThe  DCF  analysis  covers  the  period  from  2006  to  2032,  while  income  statement, \n7. \nbalance sheet, and cash flow statement projections cover 2006 to 2017. It is assumed that all \ncomponents  of  the  subproject  are  to  be  commissioned  at  the  end  of  2008  with  only  20% \nproduction capacity, 60% in 2009, 80% in 2010, and full operational capacity in 2011. \n\n8. \nThe WACC of 4% is computed on an after-tax basis in real terms. The subproject\u2019s FIRR, \ncomputed on an after-tax basis, is 9.36%; this compares favorably with the WACC. Sensitivity \nanalysis indicates that the FIRR is robust under adverse conditions. Both the DCF analysis and \nfinancial statement projections have shown satisfactory results based on the step-by-step tariff \nincreasing plan. Implementation of the solid waste tariff increasing plan and strengthening of the \ncollection system to improve the collection rates are important to achieve full cost recovery and \nmaintain satisfactory financial performance and long-term sustainability. \n\n2. \n\nQingxiushan Park Ecological Upgrading Subproject \n\n \n\n9. \nThe  Nanning  Qingxiu  Mountain  Scenic  and  Tourist  Resort Development  Company  is  a \nstate-owned company established on 10 July 2000 with registered capital of CNY79.68 million \nunder  the  administration  of  Qingxiu  Mountain  Administration  Committee.  It  was  reincorporated \nin  2000  in  accordance  with  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  company  law  as  a  solely \nstate-owned  limited  company.  The  company  is  the  IA  for  the  Qingxiushan  Park  ecological \nupgrading subproject. \n\n10. \nThe DCF analysis covers the period from 2006 to 2032. The WACC of 4% is computed \non an after-tax basis in real terms. The FIRR for the subproject, computed on an after-tax basis, \nis 9.14%; this compares favorably with the WACC. The subproject is considered both financially \nviable  and  sustainable.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  FIRR  is  robust  under  adverse \nconditions.  \n\nThe  financial  statement  projections\u2014including  income  statement,  balance  sheet,  and \n11. \ncash flow statement projections\u2014for the IA for the \u201cwithout-project\u201d scenario were prepared with \nhistorical financial statements from 2002 to 2004 as the starting basis, and then combined with \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n51 \n\nthe  financial  statement  projections  for  the  \u201cproject  only\u201d  scenario  to  arrive  at  the  financial \nstatement projections for the \u201cwith-project\u201d scenario covering the period from 2002 to 2018. \n\n12. \nBoth DCF analysis and financial statement projections have shown satisfactory results to \nachieve  full  cost  recovery  and  maintain  satisfactory  financial  performance  and  long-term \nsustainability.  \n\n \n\nXinxujiang and Kelijiang Rivers Environmental Upgrading Subprojects \n\nC.   \n \n13. \nThe Xinxujiang River and Kelijiang River environmental upgrading subprojects are non-\nrevenue  earning  subprojects,  so  only  economic  analysis  and  justification  are  required  and  the \nFIRR is not relevant. O&M costs for each subproject were estimated and addressed for NMG to \nensure that adequate government  budgetary funds will be transferred to cover the O&M costs \nrequired for normal day-to-day operation. O&M costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) \nfor  each  year  in  real  terms  will  be  about  CNY10.85  million  for  the  Xinxujiang  River \nenvironmental upgrading subproject and CNY14.89 million for the Kelijiang River environmental \nupgrading subproject. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\nEconomic Evaluation of Technical Alternatives \n\n \nA. \n \nXinxujiang and Kelijiang Rivers Environmental Upgrading Subproject. The Kelijiang \n1. \nand Xinxujiang rivers upgrading subprojects did not have technical alternatives for the least cost \nanalysis. This was because the water volumes in the lakes were fixed for water quality and flood \ncapacity  criteria,  and  the  area  available  to  accommodate  the  lakes  was  confined  by  existing \nfeatures:  roads,  dykes,  outlet  drainage  levels,  etc.  The  boundaries  of  the  flood  storage  lakes \nwere  adjusted  to  accommodate  as  much  surplus  excavated  material  as  possible,  thus \nminimizing off-site haulage and disposal costs. A pragmatic solution was therefore adopted. \n \nSolid Waste Management Subproject. The type of transfer station to be constructed for \n2. \nthe  solid  waste  management  subproject  was  assessed.  The  three  alternative  schemes \nexamined  are  (i)  two-bay  system,  (ii)  three-bay  system,  and  (iii)  two-bay  system  with  load \nmaximization  system.  The  average  incremental  economic  cost  (AIEC)  of  the  three  different \nalternatives was compared. The discount factor used is the economic opportunity cost of capital \nassumed  at  12%.  Based  on  the  AIEC,  the  least  cost  option  is  the  use  of  a  two-bay  transfer \nstation equipped with a load maximization system (alternative scheme iii); AIEC=35.9 CNY per \nton). The least cost analysis does not take into account the availability of land required for the \nthree-bay system (alternative scheme ii). \n \n3. \nQingxiushan  Park  Ecological  Upgrading  Subproject.  Three  alternative  schemes \nwere  compared  for  the  collection  and  disposal  of  the  sewage  generated  in  Qingxiushan  Park. \nThe three alternative schemes are as follows: (i) sewage will be treated in the 12 independent \nwastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the different locations in the park, (ii) sewage will be \npumped to Langdong WWTP, and (iii) an independent WWTP will be used for lower areas in the \npark and sewage will be pumped to Langdong WWTP in higher areas. Based on the AIEC, the \nleast  cost  option  is  the  pumping  of  the  sewage  to  the  Langdong  WWTP  for  treatment  and \ndisposal (alternative scheme ii); AIEC=1.86 CNY per cubic meter (m3).  \n\nB. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n \n\n \n\nXinxujiang  and  Kelijiang  Rivers  Environmental  Upgrading  Subproject.  Economic \n4. \nbenefits  identified  include  clean  environment  (aesthetic).  The  socioeconomic  survey  revealed \nthat,  in  the  Xinxujiang  area,  50%  of  people  perceive  that  pollution  is  the  most  serious \nenvironmental problem. The subproject is expected to (i) deter people from dumping waste into \nthe river and other open land areas near the river since green areas will be built on both sides of \nthe  river  (the  perception  persists  that  undeveloped  land  and  water  bodies  can  be  used  as  a \ndumping  area  for  waste);  and  (ii)  reduce  or  avoid  loss  of  life,  damage  to  properties,  and \ndisruption to economic activities due to floods. Beneficiaries will include (i) people downstream \nof the two rivers, since the subprojects will increase the water retention capacity to 2.91 million \nm3 for Xinxujiang River and 4.38 million m3 for Kelijiang River; (ii) avoidance of income loss and \nmedical expenses from diseases caused by wastewater and solid waste contamination (in the \nriver);  (iii) reduction  of  the  following  river  pollutants:  (a)  557  tons  per  year  (t/yr)  of  biological \noxygen demand (BOD5), (b) 2,200 t/yr of chemical oxygen demand (CODcr), (c) 392 t/yr of NH3-\nN,  and  (d)  35  t/yr  of  phosphor  in  Yongjiang  River  (Xinxujiang  and  Kelijiang  rivers  drain  into \nYongjiang River) which is a major source of water supply of Nanning City; and (iv) increase in \nland values1 (if environmental benefits are not considered). \n                                                 \n1   The two subprojects  will provide a minimum flood protection of 20-year return period  and a maximum of 50-year \nreturn  period  in  the  areas  adjacent  to  the  two  rivers.  Properties  adjacent  to  the  two  rivers  are  at  risk  to  flood \ndamage beyond the flood protection level. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n53 \n\nSolid  Waste  Management  Subproject.  Benefits  include  (i)  clean  environment \n5. \n(aesthetic),  (ii)  reduction  and/or  avoidance  of  flood  (as  a  result  of  reduced  solid  waste  in \nrivers/canals/drainage  system),  and  (iii)  avoidance  of  income  loss  and  medical  expenses  from \ndiseases  caused  by  solid  waste  contamination.  There  are  33  small  transfer  stations  with  a \ncapacity  of  50  tons  in  the  service  area.  At  full  capacity  and  100%  efficiency,  they  can \naccommodate  about  1,650  tons  per  day.  However,  limiting  factors  in  the  volume  of  waste \ncollected  is  the  number  of  street  sweepers/collectors  (906  tricycles  at  present)  which  bring \ngarbage  from  the  pick-up  points  to  the  different  transfer stations,  and the  low  efficiency  of  the \ncollection process. In the Kelijiang and Xinxujiang river basins, solid waste from nearby villages \n(mostly  floating  population)  ends  up  in  the  river.  This  was  supported  by  the  results  of  the \nsocioeconomic survey: about 2% of respondents dump their solid waste in the river while 79% \nput it in a public garbage tank and/or residential garbage tank; 19% feed it to poultry or livestock \n(food  waste)  or  dispose  of  it  by  other  means.  An  indicative  estimate  of  the  health  benefits \nassociated with the subproject is in Supplementary Appendix G. It is estimated that medical and \nincome loss avoided because of the Project will be CNY2.0 million in 2010 and CNY4.8 million \nin 2032. It is assumed that about 60% of this amount is attributed to the solid waste subproject. \n \n6. \nQingxiushan  Park  Ecological  Upgrading  Subproject.  The  main  objectives  of  this \nsubproject are to counter the environmental imbalance caused by rapid urbanization of Nanning \ncity,  and  reduce  pollution  in  the  park  resulting  from  wastewater  generated  by  park  visitors. \nBenefits identified are as follows: (i) reduced soil erosion (6,328 t/yr), (ii) reduced dust in the air \n(234 t/yr), (iii) increased rainwater retention (99,813 t/yr), (iv) reduced carbon dioxide (814 t/yr) \nand sulfur dioxide (41 t/yr) from the atmosphere, (v) increased tourism, (vi) income from sale of \ntree  seedlings  and  flowers,  (vii) protection  of  underground  water  (sewerage  component), \n(viii) increased  forest  stock,  (ix) reduced  worm  damage  in  trees  (because  of  the  proposed \nincrease arboreal mix and pest control), (x) reduced firefighting cost (because of proposed fire \nbarriers),  and  (xi)  reduced  damage  to  trees  and  flowers  (because  of  the  proposed  monitoring \nstation). \n \nC. \n \n7. \nThe economic costs include capital investment costs, operation and maintenance (O&M) \ncosts, opportunity cost of land, resettlement  costs, environmental costs, and replacement cost \nof capital investment. Residual values were treated as negative costs at the end of the project \nlife. Shadow pricing was used to convert financial prices into economic prices.  \n \n8. \nis shown in Table A13.1. \n \n\nCapital Costs.

About 233.3 ha will be affected permanently while 5.1 ha will \nbe  affected  only  during  project  construction.  Net  output  foregone  during  construction  is  about \nCNY0.2  million  per  year  while  net  output  foregone  after  project  completion  is  about \nCNY7.9 million per year. \n \n10. \nOperation, Maintenance, and Environmental Cost. O&M cost for the Xinxujiang River \nenvironmental  upgrading  subproject  is  about  CNY10.5  million  per  year;  for  the  Kelijiang  River \nenvironmental upgrading subproject, CNY14.4 million per year; for the solid waste management \nsubproject,  from  CNY1.6  million  to  CNY9.0  million  per  year;  and  for  the  Qingxiushan  Park \necological  upgrading  subproject,  CNY6.2  million \nto  CNY37.4  million  per  year.  The \nenvironmental mitigation measure cost ranges from CNY0.015 million to CNY10.13 million per \nyear during construction and CNY0.13 million to CNY0.57 million per year during operation. \n \nD. \n \n11. \nThe  Project  is  considered  economically  feasible  if  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return \n(EIRR) is equal to or higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital (12%). In economic \nquantitative  terms,  except  for  the  solid  waste  management  subproject,  the  Project  is  viable. \nHowever, when reduction and/or avoidance of flood damage2 (as a result of reduced solid waste \nin  rivers,  canals,  or  drainage  system)  that  can  be  attributed  to  the  solid  waste  management \nsubproject can be quantified and included as one of the economic benefits, it is likely that the \nEIRR  will  exceed  12%.  For  the  sensitivity  analysis,  the  parameters  tested  are  an  increase  in \ncapital costs and decrease in benefits. \n \n\nSummary of Benefits and Costs, and Sensitivity Analysis \n\nTable A13.2: EIRR and Sensitivity Test \n \n\nSubproject  \n\nEIRR (%) \n\nIncrease \nin \nCapital \nCosts \n(EIRR %) \n\nDecrease \nin \nBenefits \n(EIRR %) \n\nSwitching \nValues(% )  \nEIRR = 12% \n\n \n\nXinxujiang River Environmental Upgrading \nKelijiang River Environmental Upgrading \nSolid Waste Management \nQingxiushan Park Ecological Upgrading \n\n \n\n24.0 \n22.1 \n11.1 \n12.6 \n\n \n\n22.1 \n20.0 \n10.8 \n11.0 \n\n \n\n14.9 \n13.1 \n8.2 \n10.4 \n\nCapital \nCost \n+268 \n+207 \n    -7 \n   +6 \n\nBenefit \n\n-67 \n-62 \n+4 \n-3 \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n12. \nIncreasing the civil works cost component by 30% will result in an EIRR of 22.1% for the \nXinxujiang River environmental upgrading subproject and EIRR of 20.0% for the Kelijiang River \nenvironmental upgrading subproject. If the increase in the land value of the properties adjacent \nto  the  rivers  will  only  be  realized  for  the  first  3  years  after  project  completion,  the  EIRR  will \ndecrease  to  14.9%  and  13.1%,  respectively.  The  EIRR  of  the  solid  waste  management \nsubproject will fall further to 10.8% and 8.2% when the capital cost is increased by 10% and the \nbenefits  are  reduced  by  10%,  respectively.  The  Qingxiushan  Park  ecological  upgrading \nsubproject\u2019s EIRR will reduce to 11.0% and 10.4% when the capital cost is increased by 20% \nand the benefits are reduced by 10%, respectively. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n2   The  Implementing  Agency  estimated  that,  for  the  Xinxujiang  river  basin,  flood  damage  that  could  be  avoided \n\nbecause of the Project is about CNY11.03 million on an annual basis. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n55 \n\nAffordability of Basic Services \n\nFor  the  switching  values,  the  capital  cost  for  the  Xinxujiang  River  environmental \n13. \nupgrading subproject needs to be increased by 268% or the benefits reduced by 67% to reduce \nthe  EIRR  to  12%;  for  the  Kelijiang  River  environmental  upgrading  subproject,  the  capital  cost \nneeds to be increased by 207% or the benefits reduced by 62% to reduce the EIRR to 12%. To \nmake the EIRR of the solid waste management subproject reach 12%, the capital cost needs to \nbe  reduced  by  7%  or  the  benefits  increased  by  4%.  For  the  Qingxiushan  Park  ecological \nupgrading subproject, the capital cost needs to be increased by 6% or the benefits reduced by \n3% to make the EIRR equal to 12%. \n \nE. \n \n14. \nXinxujiang  and  Kelijiang  Rivers  Environmental  Upgrading  Subprojects.  The \nNanning  municipal  government  (NMG)  currently  collects  fees  for  flood  control  and  protection \nfrom  public  and  private  entities.  However,  the  rates  being  implemented  are  low  and  were  not \nintended  to  cover  the  full  O&M  cost  of  existing  flood  control  facilities.  The  fee  is  not  per \nhousehold but is charged per employed member  of the family. The rates are CNY60 per year \nper  employee  if  the  monthly  income  is  over  CNY400,  CNY40  per  year  per  employee  if  the \nmonthly income is between CNY251 and CNY400, and zero if the monthly income is CNY250 or \nless. Farmers are not charged but should provide 15\u201320 days voluntary labor inputs per farmer \nper year. No new tariffs were proposed on completion of the subprojects. \n \n15. \nSolid Waste Management Subproject. For the solid waste management subproject, no \nnew  tariff  rate  increases  are  proposed  except  those  already  approved  by  NMG  for \nimplementation  in  2007  (CNY8  per  household  per  month).  In  addition,  NMG  has  some  safety \nnets to support poor families and other economically vulnerable groups in the city, which include \ndiscount on or nonpayment of the monthly fee. \n \n16. \nQingxiushan  Park  Ecological  Upgrading  Subproject.  The  proposed  entrance  fees \n(2005  constant  price)  to  the  park  after  project  completion  are  CNY20  (2010),  CNY30  (2015), \nand  CNY45  (2020).  Affordability  of  the  entrance  fee  to  the  low-income  group  is  not  really  an \nissue since going to the park is not a basic need of the population. In any case, there are other \nfree  public  parks  in  the  city,  e.g.,  Nanhu  lake  park  (171  ha)  offers  a  wide  variety  of \nentertainment  and  amenities  aside  from  green  areas  and  trees  around  the  lake.  Qingxiushan \nPark management provides free and/or discounted entrance fee to elderly visitors (70 years old \nand  above).  Based  on  water  company  data,  per  capita  water  consumption  in  Nanning  City  is \n144.5 m3 per year. The number of persons per household is 3.75, based on the socioeconomic \nsurvey.  The  residential wastewater  tariff  was  CNY0.5  per  m3  of  water  used  in  2005,  while  the \nsolid  waste  fee  per  household  was  CNY7.5  per  month.  Monthly  household  income  was \nestimated  at  CNY1,500  in  2005.  After  project  completion,  the  estimated  ratio  of  monthly \nexpense  to  household  monthly  income  for  basic  services  (solid  waste,  wastewater,  and  flood \ncontrol) is 2.68% (5.39% if water supply expense is included). \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 May 2006) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "yuan (CNY) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "CNY1.00\n$1.00\n", "$0.12 \nCNY8.00 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \nAsian Development Bank \naverage incremental economic cost \nbiological oxygen demand \nchemical oxygen demand \ndiscounted cash flow \nenvironmental impact assessment \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management plan \nenvironmental protection bureau \nfinancial internal rate of return \nGuangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region \nimplementing agency \ninternational competitive bidding \nLondon interbank offered rate \nMillennium Development Goal \nmanagement information system \nminimum living standard scheme \nNanning municipal government \noperation and maintenance \nproject impact area \nproject management office \nproject performance monitoring system \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \nproject steering committee \nresettlement plan \nsocial development action plan \nsummary environmental impact assessment \ntechnical assistance \nweighted average cost of capital \nwastewater treatment plant \n", "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES \nsquare kilometer \nsquare meter \ncubic meter \nton per year \n", "NOTES \n", "ADB \nAIEC \nBOD \nCOD \nDCF \nEIA \nEIRR \nEMP \nEPB \nFIRR \nGZAR \nIA \nICB \nLIBOR \nMDG \nMIS \nMLSS \nNMG \nO&M \nPIA \nPMO \nPPMS \nPRC \nPSC \nRP \nSDAP \nSEIA \nTA \nWACC \nWWTP \n", "km2 \nm2 \nm3 \nt/yr \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December.  \nIn this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \n", "Vice President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "C.
