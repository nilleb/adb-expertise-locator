Subprogram  1  is \nproposed to be supported by a loan for $200,000,000. \n   \nClassification  Targeting Classification: General intervention \nSector: Finance. \nSubsector: Finance sector development \nThemes: Sustainable economic growth, governance  \nSubtheme: Financial and economic governance \n   \nEnvironment  Category C \nAssessment \n   \nThe Program   \nRationale  The goal of the Financial Market Regulation and Intermediation \nProgram (FMRIP) is to increase the contribution of the financial \nsector to economic growth and development of the Philippines by \npromoting  a  more  efficient  financial  sector  that  can  finance \nprofitable private investment projects at lower cost and risk than at \npresent.  The  FMRIP  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  financial \nsector reform agenda and development of capital markets and \nother nonbank financial services. The reform agenda is structured \naround  policy  outcomes  mostly  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s \nMedium-Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP) 2004\u20132010. \n \nThe MTPDP is centered on targets for increased and sustainable \ngrowth and job creation during 2004\u20132010. It envisages real gross \ndomestic product growth rates of 5.3%\u20136.3% in 2005 and 7%\u20138% \nby 2010, driven by exports and investments. To realize these \ntargets, the Philippines requires a wide range of financial services \nand  instruments,  in  addition  to  what  can  be  provided  by  the \nbanking  subsector.  Broadening  and  deepening  the  financial \nsystem  by  diversifying  financial  channels,  enhancing \ntransparency, and improving market efficiency will contribute to \neconomic growth and development, and reduce financial sector \nvulnerabilities  and  systemic  risks.  Enhanced  stability  in  the \nfinancial  system,  strengthened  governance  in  the  nonbank \nfinancial  subsector,  and  improved  efficiency  in  the  securities \nmarket will all contribute to a more conducive environment for \ncontinued financial market development.  \n \nThe policy measures include a set of financial sector reforms to \npromote  diversification  of  financial  channels,  and  enhance \ntransparency and efficiency in intermediation. The FMRIP aims to \n(i) enhance financial system stability through improved debt and \nrisk  management  measures  of  the  Government,  improved \n ", "ii   \nresolution of banks resulting in enhanced financial intermediation, \nand  more  robust  nonbank  financial  institutions;  (ii)  strengthen \nnonbank financial sector governance; and (iii) improve securities \nmarket efficiency to contribute to improved investment confidence \nand climate. \n \nThe FMRIP will be supported by a cluster of two subprogram \nloans,  with  subprogram  2  expected  to  be  ready  for  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Board consideration approximately 18 \nmonths  after  the  effectiveness  of  subprogram  1.  The  policy \nreforms under subprogram 2 are indicative and the scope and \nschedule of subprogram 2 will be modified as necessary based on \na review of the accomplishments under subprogram 1. This will \nprovide flexibility in program design, as adjustments can be made \non the basis of the results of subprogram 1 and changes in the \nexternal environment.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The FMRIP aims to promote a more diversified set of financial \nmarkets  that  are  more  efficient  and  resilient.  This  is  to  be \nachieved, by the end of the second subprogram through more \nliquid  markets,  in  particular  through  unlocking  the  potential  of \nsecurities markets by measures that (i) promote liquidity, financial \ndeepening,  and  strengthened  intermediaries;  (ii)  enhance \ninformation  reporting  and  disclosure  standards  through \nconvergence  to  international  standards;  (iii)  develop  a  broader \ninvestor  base;  (iv)  reduce  systemic  risk  and  lower  transaction \ncosts through improved settlement and payment systems; and (v) \nstrengthen policy and regulatory capabilities to address the legal, \nregulatory,  supervision,  financial  governance,  and  enforcement \nchallenges of a more open and integrated (both regionally and \nglobally) economy and financial sector. These objectives will be \nachieved through a mix of reforms at various levels, including \npolicy, governance, institutions, and operations. The FMRIP is a \nmedium-term program cluster that comprises two subprograms, to \nbe provided over the medium term. Subprogram 1 supports the \nGovernment\u2019s  financial sector  reform  agenda,  with  a  focus  on \ndevelopment  of  capital  markets  and  other  nonbank  services. \nSubprogram 1 will aim to (i) reduce financial sector vulnerabilities \nand increase the depth and diversity of financial intermediation \nthrough  improved  resolution  of  banks  and  stronger  nonbank \nfinancial  institutions;  (ii)  strengthen  investor  confidence  with \nimproved  regulation,  governance,  and  transparency;  and  (iii) \nimprove operational efficiency of the securities market. From a \nmarket  perspective,  subprogram  1  will  cover  debt  and  equity \nmarkets, deposit insurance, and the insurance subsector.  \n   \nThe Program Loan  A loan of $200,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will \nFinancing Plan  be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility for subprogram 1. The loan will have a 15-\nyear term including a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \n ", "  iii  \nfacility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and  such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \nPeriod and Tranching  The  program  cluster  period  will  be  from  January  2005  to \n  December 2009, with a single tranche loan of $200 million to be \ndisbursed under subprogram 1 (2006\u20132008). Subprogram 2 will \nbe submitted for Board consideration approximately 18 months \nafter  the  effectiveness  of  the  first  subprogram,  subject  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s  readiness  on  the  reform  agenda.  The  loan  will \nretroactively  finance  expenditures  incurred  by  the  Government \n180 days prior to loan effectiveness. \n   \nCounterpart Funds  The Government will use the local currency counterpart funds \n  generated by the loan proceeds to meet program expenditures \nand  associated  costs  of  reform,  and  to  help  maintain  current \nsocial expenditure. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Department of Finance (DOF) \n   \nImplementation  The  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  will  be  the \nArrangements  Implementing  Agency.  DOF  will  be  responsible  for  overall \nsubprogram 1 implementation, including complying with all policy \nactions, program administration, disbursements, and maintenance \nof all program records. SEC will set up a program coordination \ncommittee  headed  by  the  SEC  chairperson,  and  comprising \nrepresentatives  from  the  Bangko  Sentral  ng  Pilipinas,  DOF, \nInsurance  Commission,  Philippine  Dealing  and  Exchange \nCorporation,  Philippine  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  (PDIC), \nand  Philippine  Stock  Exchange.  The  committee  will  be \nresponsible  for  implementing  and  sustaining  the  program \ncomponents,  in  particular  implementation  of  the  action  plan \nadopted for the Capital Market Development Plan. The committee \nwill  meet  every  quarter  to  coordinate  and  ensure  effective \nimplementation of the proposed reforms. ADB may be invited to \nparticipate  in  the  meetings  as  an  observer.  SEC  will  be \nresponsible for day-to-day program implementation activities, and \nreporting  of  implementation  progress,  in  coordination  with  the \nInsurance Commission and PDIC. \n   \nProcurement  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign \nexchange  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items \nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries  (other  than \nitems specified in the list of ineligible items and imports financed \nby other bilateral and multilateral sources). The Government will \ncertify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal \nrequest.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing \nprocedures will be required. ADB reserves the right to audit the \nuse  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  verify  the  accuracy  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s certification.  \n   \n \n ", "iv   \nProgram Benefits and  Economic growth and job creation are the cornerstones of the \nBeneficiaries   MTPDP.  The  FMRIP  supports  the  Government\u2019s  development \nagenda and the development of a more efficient financial sector \nthat encourages more personal savings and the direction of those \nsavings into appropriate, private sector investments. The FMRIP \nwill  lead  to  enhanced  stability  in  the  financial  system, \nstrengthened  governance  in  the  nonbank  financial  sector,  and \nimproved efficiency in the securities market that will all contribute \nto a more conducive environment for continued financial market \ndevelopment. The policies supported by the FMRIP are expected \nto contribute to enhanced investor confidence, and stimulate both \ndomestic and foreign investments.  \n \nThe  FMRIP  will  boost  competition  in  the  financial  sector  and \nfacilitate the growth of financial intermediaries, while improving the \nefficiency of capital markets and the allocation of resources in the \neconomy. Financial intermediaries will be enabled to develop a \nwider range of attractive financial products for consumers, which \nwill improve the efficiency of intermediation by channeling greater \nsavings into the financial system. Together with broader economic \nreforms in the Philippines, the reform of the financial sector will \nthus  contribute  to  productivity  growth,  employment  generation, \nand fiscal and financial sector stability.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  While mitigation measures have been put in place for some of the \nkey risks anticipated for FMRIP implementation, Subprogram 1 \nstill faces some risks. First, political instability could negatively \nimpact  the  pace  of  reform  and  the  macroeconomy.  However, \nwhile significant political disturbances during 2005 had an impact \non  spreads  on  international  bonds,  domestically  the  reforms \nmoved ahead albeit with a delay.  \n \nSecond, exogenous shocks to the economy will adversely affect \ngrowth  prospects  and  threaten  macroeconomic  stability.  That \ncould in turn lead to lower confidence among consumers and \nbusiness, and reduce demand for finance and increase the focus \non  safe  assets,  i.e.,  a  preference  by  consumers  for  savings \ndeposits and investments in government debt rather than lending \nby banks. Global growth prospects remain positive. A slowdown in \nUnited  States  growth  appears  to  be  offset  by  the  recovery  in \nJapan  and  stronger  growth  in  Europe.  Strong  growth  in  Asia \nbodes well for export demand with intraregional trade rising. The \nFMRIP, in conjunction with additional reform programs financed \nby ADB, and the Development Policy Support Program proposed \nto  be  jointly  financed  with  the  World  Bank,  contributes  to \nsustaining  the  economy  on  an  enhanced  growth  path  while \nmitigating the risks of macroeconomic instability. The FMRIP also \nhelps to cushion the economy from its remaining exposure to \nadverse  shocks  through  its  provision  of  significant  financial \nresources on favorable terms. \n \n ", "  v  \nThe third risk would be delays in pursuing financial sector reforms \nin line with the Capital Market Development Plan and MTPDP. \nWhile temporary setbacks may be experienced during the course \nof the FMRIP, the momentum in financial sector reforms should \nnot be lost as the alternative of not pursuing reforms would have a \nnegative  effect  on  the  investment  climate,  and  consumer  and \ninvestor confidence. However, this risk is considered small as the \nregulatory agencies are strongly committed to reform. \n \nA  fourth  risk  is  that  some  reforms  will  be  undertaken  without \nsufficient  consideration  of  appropriate  sequencing  resulting  in \nrisks being transferred to institutions and markets before they are \nable  to  acquire  adequate  capacity  for  risk  management.  The \nFMRIP  mitigates  this  risk  by  providing  program  support  and \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  policy \nmakers and regulators to address these concerns. These risks are \nfurther  mitigated  by  a  consultative  approach  grounded  in \nstakeholder discussions with the private sector, government, and \nkey  international  partners  such  as  the  International  Monetary \nFund, United States Agency for International Development, World \nBank, and others.  \n \nFinally,  serious  concerns  relate  to  inadequate  standards  of \ngovernance  and  incidence  of  corruption.  The  Government's \nMTPDP views graft and corruption as threats to sustained growth \nand development of the country. As such the consensus is strong \nthat good governance and measures to address corruption are \nneeded for a successful partnership to reduce poverty. In view of \nthis, support projects are to be designed to enhance governance \nand  reduce  opportunities  for  corruption.  The  thrust  will  be  to \ninstitute and implement regulatory and legal reforms by promoting \nthe independence of the regulator, and separate operator and \nregulator  functions.  Moreover,  institutional  reforms  will  aim  to \nensure transparency and accountability; and to mitigate, if not \neradicate,  administrative  impropriety  of  respective  government \nagencies. This will be reinforced by strengthening consolidated \nsupervision mechanisms via closer cooperation and coordination \namong financial services regulatory agencies. For instance, the \nFinancial  Sector  Forum  established  in  July  2004  provides  a \nplatform for exchanging information and ideas, and coordinating \nregulatory and supervisory activities of the four member agencies. \nBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has been able to keep pace with \ninnovations  in  regulation  and  has  been  diligent  in  its \nimplementation of international best practices in regulation. SEC \nis  a  much  stronger  organization,  having  undertaken  various \nreforms since 1998 under the Securities Regulation Code. SEC is \nprimarily  responsible  for  implementing  the  Capital  Market \nDevelopment Plan. Successful implementation of the CMDP with \nthe support of the FMRIP should strengthen the capacity and \nauthority of SEC in regulating and ensuring good governance in \nthe securities market. The amendment of the insurance code and \n ", "vi   \nreorganization  of  the  Insurance  Commission  will  lead  to  an \nimproved  legal  and  regulatory  framework  and  enhanced \ngovernance and supervision for the insurance industry.  \n \nTechnical Assistance  TA  will  be  provided  and  implemented  simultaneously  with  the \nFMRIP. The TA is estimated to cost $1.15 million equivalent. ADB \nwill finance $800,000 to be funded on a grant basis from the \nJapan Special Fund.  \n \nThe TA will support the Insurance Commission, PDIC, and SEC in \nimplementing key policy reforms. For the Insurance Commission, \nTA activities include (i) develop practices and methodologies to \nimplement risk-based supervision and related capacity building; \n(ii)  support reorganization  of  the  commission  by  preparing  the \nhuman resource component including staffing, skills base, and job \ndescriptions;  (iii)  develop  a  strategy  to  fully  implement \nInternational Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS 28) core \nprinciples;  (iv)  develop  analytical  processes  and  manuals  to \nsupport upgrading of information and communication technology, \nincluding  introduction  of  electronic  filing  and  analysis;  and  (v) \ndevelop a road map for development of the insurance subsector.  \n \nThe  TA  will  assist  PDIC  in  (i)  identifying  necessary  legal \namendments  to  revise  its  resolution  methods  and  introduce \nadditional instruments for more effective resolution of failed banks; \n(ii) formulating guidelines for provision of financial assistance to \nailing banks; (iii) developing a framework for efficient disposal of \nassets including asset valuation, management, and disposal; and \n(iv) preparing a contingency plan to deal with failure of a large \nbank or a number of banks in succession. The TA to SEC will \ninclude (i) developing and helping implement an action plan for \nmoving toward a dematerialized environment, including drafting of \nrules for scripless securities; (ii) building the capacity of staff to \nmore effectively monitor compliance with international accounting \nstandard 39 (mark-to-market valuation); (iii) standardizing books \nand  records  requirements  of  investment  houses  and  other \nnonbank financial institutions to help SEC in turn standardize their \naudit procedures; and (iv) enhancing the supervisory framework to \nensure prompt public disclosure of material information by public \ncompanies  and  their  officers,  directors,  and  principal \nshareholders, with respect to beneficial ownership.  \n \n \n ", "  vii  \n \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogram cluster for the Financial Market Regulation and Intermediation Program (FMRIP), and \n(ii) a proposed loan to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 1 of the FMRIP. The \nreport also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Strengthening Regulation and \nGovernance  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority \ndelegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  will  approve  the  TA.  The  program  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n2.  The  macroeconomic  management  priority  is  to  maintain  momentum  on  fiscal \nconsolidation. This will allow the budget to contribute more to growth and poverty reduction. \nProgress on reducing the deficit has emerged as the proxy for markets to gauge Government \ncommitment, capacity, and credibility to deliver on its broader agenda. ADB\u2019s country strategy \nand program (CSP) 2005\u20132007 for the Philippines1 proposes significant policy-based support; \nhowever, that assistance is conditional on the budget deficit reduction program being on track, \nand sector-specific reform agendas being in place.  \n \n3.  Erosion of the tax/gross domestic product (GDP) ratio from 17% in 1997 to 12.5% in \n2003, when the decline was arrested, was the primary cause of the rapid increase in the \nnational Government budget deficit/GDP ratio from 0.1% in 1997 to its peak of 5.3% in 2002. \nIncreasing losses of nonfinancial government-owned and -controlled corporations (GOCCs) \nduring 1999\u20132004, especially in the power sector, increased the consolidated public sector \ndeficit/GDP  ratio.2 Government  access  to  official  development  assistance  for  investment \nprojects was constrained due to lack of budget cover and counterpart funding. Hence, relatively \nexpensive financing was sourced from international capital markets, feeding back into high debt \nservice commitments\u2014a vicious circle that needs breaking if public fiscal space is to be created \nto allow spending for economic growth and poverty reduction.  \n \n4.  While the Government\u2019s fiscal consolidation program includes a wide range of initiatives, \nin view of the serious impact of undercollection of revenues on economic growth and public \nservice delivery, the centerpiece comprises broadening the tax base, adjusting tax rates, and \nstrengthening tax administration. With a view to front-loading initiatives to increase tax collection, \nimportant steps include (i) implementing adjusted excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco from \nJanuary  2005;  (ii)  introducing  changes  to  the  value-added  tax  to  increase  coverage  from \nNovember 2005 and increasing the rate from 10% to 12% from February 2006.  \n \n5.  In 2005, revenue initiatives were complemented by a reduction in the aggregate deficit of \nGOCCs, reversing a negative trend for the first time since 1999. Tax revenue increased by 18% \nin 2005 compared with average annual growth of about 7.5% during 2000\u20132004. In addition, the \ncorporate tax rate was increased from 32% to 35% over 3 years beginning in 2005. For the first \ntime since 1997, in 2005 the tax/GDP ratio improved, increasing to 13.1% in 2005 from 12.4% in \n2004, while the national Government\u2019s budget deficit/GDP ratio declined from 3.9% to 2.7%, the \nthird  successive  annual  improvement.  The  national  Government  debt  stock/GDP  ratio \ndecreased to 72% in 2005 from 79% in 2004. The outcomes both encouraged and benefited \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program (2005\u20132007): Philippines. Manila. \n2  The  consolidated  public  sector  deficit  comprises  the  financial  outcome  for  the  national  Government,  local \ngovernments, government financial institutions, the central bank, and the public social security system. \n ", "2 \nfrom more favorable market sentiment: foreign direct investment almost tripled in 2005 (albeit \nfrom a low base); two of the three major credit-rating agencies upgraded their outlooks from \nnegative to stable; sovereign borrowing costs fell,3 and the peso appreciated against the dollar \nin the early part of the year. In turn, these translated to significant debt service savings\u2014an \nimportant part of the emergence during 2005 of a virtuous circle, in which staying the course of \nreforms  generated  improved  market  sentiment,  which  in  turn  generated  more  favorable \nconditions for achieving macroeconomic targets.  \n6.  During the Philippine Development Forum in March 2006, the development partners \ncharacterized  progress  on  aggregate  fiscal  consolidation  as  impressive  and  assessed  the \nprogram  to  be  broadly  on  track. 4 The  emerging  trend  is  better  than  projected  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s  Medium-Term  Philippine  Development  Plan  2004\u20132010  (MTPDP),5 and  the \ntarget for achieving a balanced budget was advanced from 2010 to 2008. While ambitious, the \ndevelopment  partners  consider  this  achievable.  For  2006,  the  enhanced  value-added  tax \nrevenues are expected to yield the equivalent of 1.2% of GDP, while the overall tax effort is \nexpected to improve by 1.4 percentage points, from 13.1% in 2005 to 14.5% in 2006. The \nnational Government and consolidated public sector budget deficits are expected to decline to \n2.1% and 2.2% of GDP; 1.8 and 2.7 percentage points lower than in 2004.  \n7.  The CSP sets fiscal triggers for policy-based lending (Table 1). During 2005\u20132007, the \nprimary trigger is a reduction of the projected Government deficit/GDP ratio of 0.7 percentage \n \npoints (footnote 1, Appendix 8) relative to the 2004 baseline. Further, the CSP requires \u201cactions \nto achieve the expected reduction in the deficit/GDP ratio will precede ADB lending operations, \nrather than actual results of the actions.\u201d (para. 62). Importantly, the CSP notes that, during \nfiscal consolidation, ADB will provide program support to help implement the budgetary, power, \nand related reforms as long as the transition remains on track (footnote 1, para. 49). Thus, a \nvirtuous circle of reform progress and new support is set up: progress elicits new lending and \nnew lending strengthens reforms. \n \nTable 1: Budget Deficit Trigger for Policy-Based Lending  \nin the Country Strategy and Program \n \n  2004 (baseline)  2005 (actual)  2006 (projected) a  2007 (projected)a \nItem  P bn  %GDP  P bn  %GDP  P bn  %GDP  P bn  %GDP \nNational Government  187  3.9  146  2.7  125  2.1  63  0.9 \nDeficit  \n  % point reduction    Baseline    1.2    1.8    3.0 \n                 \nCPSD  235  4.9  145  2.7  116  1.9  41  0.6 \n   % point reduction    Baseline    2.2    3.0    4.3 \n                 \nMemo Item                 \n   Tax/GDP    12.4    13.1    14.5    15.0 \na Projections based on Department of Finance\u2019s emerging trends. \nSource: Department of Finance.

ADB\u2019s CSP (footnote 1) as well as the Government\u2019s MTPDP, prioritize the need to \naddress fundamental weaknesses in the investment climate by promoting development of a \nmore efficient financial sector that can finance profitable private investment projects at lower \ncost and risk than at present. Increased financial intermediation between savers and investors \nsupported by strengthened regulation and supervision are needed to increase the sector\u2019s \ncontribution  to  economic  growth.  Policy  measures  to  promote  diversification  of  financial \nchannels, enhance financial governance and market efficiency, and reduce systemic risks will \ncontribute to increased investment confidence and a stronger investment climate.  \n  \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n9.  Shallow and Narrow. At an M2 to GDP ratio of 62% at the end of 2004,6 financial sector \ndevelopment in the Philippines is the third lowest in Asia after the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic and Cambodia, and far behind regional competitors such as Malaysia and Thailand, \nwhich have financial depth ratios of more than 100%. Government issuances dominate the debt \nmarket, while the domestic equities market remains small compared with other Asian countries. \nThe resulting inadequate intermediation between savers and investors has slowed Philippine \neconomic growth and development. However, an effective and efficient financial sector can only \nbe  created  over  the  longer  term  through  difficult  governance  reforms  in  regulation  and \nsupervision combined with structural diversification of financial channels to promote competition, \nimproved private sector governance, and enhanced resilience. A sector analysis is provided in \nAppendix 2. \n \n10.  High Concentration of Banking Institutions. The financial sector is dominated by \nbanks, accounting for more than 80% of sector assets. According to the compilation of the \ncentral bank, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), at the end of 2005 banking assets totaled \nP4,456.50  billion.  This  high  concentration  in  banking  institutions  is  understated  as  most \nnonbank  financial  intermediation  is  done  by  subsidiaries  of  large  commercial  banks.  The \nPhilippines weathered the Asian crisis comparatively well. The nonperforming asset (NPA) ratio \nhas been gradually falling from 18.06% at the end of June 2002 to 9% by the end of March 2006. \nCorrespondingly, the nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio decreased from about 16.7% in 2002 to \nabout 7.36% at end of March 2006. These numbers are encouraging but are also somewhat \noverstated as impaired assets or assets on which banks have foreclosed are not included in the \nNPA ratio. The Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) Act provided fiscal incentives for resolution of \nNPAs;  about  a  fifth  of  the  NPAs  were  disposed  of  under  the  SPV  framework.  Given  the \nreduction of NPAs since 2002, in April 2006 the Republic Act 9343 extended the deadline for \nestablishing  an  SPV  from  19  September  2004  to  18 months  from  effectiveness  of  the \namendatory law. The act also allows the extension of the SPV transaction deadline for another \n2 years to continue strengthening banks\u2019 balance sheets.  \n \n11.  Financing of Government Deficits. The substantial number of NPAs has inhibited new \nlending, resulting in liquidity of the banking system. The loan to deposit ratio of banks stood at \n72.5% at the end of 2005, substantially lower than the average of about 90%, which is regarded \nas normal or healthy. The liquidity has been primarily invested in readily available Government \nsecurities given the large budget deficits. The large deficits and their financing by banks crowd \nout the financing needs of the private sector. In addition, bank exposure to the Government is a \n                                                 \n6  The M2 to GDP ratio (that is demand, savings, and time deposits or M2, divided by the output of goods and \nservices, namely GDP) is a common measure of financial depth. \n ", "4 \nnew vulnerability that hopefully will be manageable as fiscal consolidation begins to show \nresults and private sector demand for credit gradually recovers.7 \n \n12.  Inadequate  Funding  Resources  for  Deposit  Insurance.  The  Philippine  Deposit \nInsurance Corporation (PDIC) extends financial assistance to troubled and closed banks when \ndeemed necessary to maintain financial stability or provide adequate banking services in a \ncommunity. The assistance is justified if new investors and/or funds are available to recapitalize \nthe bank and represent a least-cost solution. However, if no rehabilitation is found viable, the \nMonetary Board places a troubled bank under PDIC receivership. By December 2005, PDIC \nhad 440 banks under receivership and liquidation. The PDIC\u2019s Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) \namounted to P47.2 billion at the end of 2005 compared to an estimated needed level of P90 \nbillion in relation to the assessed risks in the system.  \n \n13.  Underdeveloped  Nonbank  Financial  Subsector.  The  nonbank  financial  subsector \nremains small. Nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) include financing companies (with and \nwithout  quasi-banking  functions),  mutual  funds  (also  known  as  investment  companies), \ninsurance companies, pension funds, securities brokers and dealers, pawnshops, and pre-need \nplan companies. About half of nonbank financial assets are with pension funds and one quarter \nwith the insurance industry. \n \n14.  The insurance subsector has 32 life insurance companies and 104 nonlife insurance \ncompanies. One reason for the large number of companies is the capital requirement of P50 \nmillion, about $1 million, which is very low by regional standards. The capital requirement in \nIndonesia is about $11 million equivalent, $7 million equivalent in Thailand and $5 million \nequivalent in Viet Nam. In addition, the subsector is highly concentrated with the three largest \nlife insurance companies accounting for about 60% of assets and premium income. Insurance \ncompanies are major investors in local government securities and equities. Despite the large \nnumber of insurance companies, the insurance premium income to GDP only ranged from \n1.27% to 1.30% during the 3 years, 2002\u20132004. \n \n15.  Among the collective investment vehicles, mutual funds and pre-need plan companies \nare  constrained  by  the  absence  of  a  supportive  policy  and  regulatory  framework  that  will \nadequately protect investors and provide a more conducive environment for both industries to \ngrow. Under the Securities Regulation Code (SRC), pre-need plans are regulated as a security \nthrough a rules-based (as opposed to a legislative-based) framework. Thus more sustainable \nreforms  for  both  the  pre-need  and  mutual  fund  subsector  depend  on  putting  in  place  a \ncomprehensive legal and modern regulatory framework. Although relevant bills were submitted \nby the executive branch to Congress, neither adoption of a new pre-need code nor amendment \nof the Investment Company Act seems to be a priority. \n16.  Weak  Governance  and  Regulatory  Regime.  The  fixed-income  securities  market \nshould be an active competitor to the banks in the provision of external debt for corporations. \nHowever the fixed-income market is still dominated by Government issuance, accounting for \nover  98%  of  total  outstanding  domestic  debt  securities.  Short-term  debt  securities,  mostly \ntreasury bills, account for almost 30% of the market; and corporate issuers less than 2%. The \ncommercial paper market provides an alternative source of short-term debt (up to 3 years) but it \nis also small. Philippine companies meet the majority of their financing requirements from \n                                                 \n7  Banks\u2019 principal liabilities\u2014short-term deposits in both local and foreign currencies\u2014are not best hedged through \nmedium-term government debt on the asset side. The issuance of dollar-denominated Republic of Philippines \nbonds has compounded the banks\u2019 vulnerability as they are large holders of these bonds (imperfectly matched on \nthe liability side by their foreign currency deposit units). \n ", "    5 \ninternally generated funds. As analyzed in the Private Sector Assessment of the Philippines8 \nreasons for the underdevelopment of the financial sector include the concentrated nature of \nbanking and the propensity of banks to channel funding to their preferred and often related \ncustomers, weak bank and corporate governance, ineffective insolvency regime, and weak \nimplementation of the regulatory regime. \n \n17.  Shallow Equity Market. The equity market remains small with 237 listed firms at the \nPhilippine  Stock  Exchange  (PSE)  and  a  market  capitalization  of  P5,908  billion  as  of  31 \nDecember 2005 (equivalent to 41% of GDP). This is slightly higher than Indonesia but lower \nthan Thailand (68% of GDP) and Malaysia (150% of GDP). In terms of performance, market \ncapitalization increased by 24% in 2005 and the index rose by 26.4%. However, turnover \nvelocity  (annual  turnover  divided  by  market  capitalization)  remains  low  at  14.3%  in  2004 \ncompared with 33.8% in Malaysia, 44.9 % in Indonesia, and 110.8% in Thailand.  \n \n18.  Coordination in Supervision. BSP, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and \nInsurance  Commission  are  the  supervisory  bodies  for  banks,  nonbanks,  and  insurance \ncompanies. In addition PDIC has examination powers for banks that it may exercise only with \nprior approval of BSP\u2019s Monetary Board. The Cooperative Development Authority regulates \nfinancial  cooperatives  and  the  Department  of  Trade  and  Industry  regulates  small  lending \ninvestors.  The  nonbank  financial  subsector  comprises  PSE and  a  variety  of  financial \n \nintermediaries including investment houses, finance companies, broker-dealers firms, mutual \nfunds,  investment  management  companies,  insurance  companies,  and  pre-need  plan \ncompanies. BSP also regulates and supervises NBFIs that are subsidiaries of commercial \nbanks and those with a quasi-banking license, trust operations, and pawnshops. SEC also \nserves  as  a  registrar  of  companies,  both  publicly  and  privately  held.  In  July  2004,  BSP, \nInsurance Commission, PDIC, and SEC, formed the Financial Sector Forum. The forum serves \nas a venue for adopting a more consolidated approach to efforts to enhance the financial \nsystem reform agenda, particularly in addressing harmonization and coordination of supervisory \nand regulatory methods and policies, reporting and information exchange and dissemination, \nand consumer protection and education. However, regulatory overlaps continue. \n \n19.  The  Medium-Term  Philippine  Development  Plan.  The  MTPDP  (footnote  5) \nemphasizes economic growth and job creation as key to poverty reduction, and builds on the \nGovernment\u2019s  10-point  agenda.  Real  GDP  growth  rate  targets  are  5.3%\u20136.3%  in  2005, \nincreasing to 7%\u20138% by 2010. Increasing exports and higher investments are expected to drive \ngrowth. While the MTPDP encompasses policies and actions in several sectors it notes the \nimportance of developing the financial system to mobilize domestic savings to support growth. \nFurther reforms, in particular in the nonbank financial subsector, are needed to achieve effective \nintermediation. The MTPDP points out the need to undertake reforms for financial deepening \nand outlines key reforms to be undertaken during 2004\u20132010. Anchored on the MTPDP is the \nGovernment\u2019s Capital Market Development Plan (CMDP)\u2014a blueprint developed for growth and \nexpanded contributions to the Philippine economy, 2005\u20132010.9 The CMDP articulates a series \nof 11 strategic objectives intended to stimulate the growth, efficiency, and competitiveness of \nthe capital market over the next 5 years. Preparation of the CMDP involved soliciting input from \na wide range of stakeholders via public forums including workshops, the SEC website, and the \nnews  media.  SEC  also  sought input  from  the  Capital Market  Development  Council  of  the \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2005. The Philippines: Private Sector Assessment. Manila \n9  Philippines,  Government  of.  2006.  Capital  Market  Development  Plan:  Blueprint  for  Growth  and  Expanded \nContributions to the Philippine Economy. Manila. \n ", "6 \nPhilippines, an important policy body comprised of relevant policy makers from the public sector. \nOn 20 October 2006, the Department of Finance (DOF) approved the CMDP. \n \nB.   Issues and Opportunities \n \n  1.  Enhance Financial System Stability  \n \n    a.  Improve Debt and Risk Management  \n \n20.  The Philippines has grappled with high budget deficits since the Asian crisis. Revenues \nto GDP are low averaging about 14.5% since 2001, with tax revenues equivalent to about \n12.5% of GDP. The reasons for the low ratio of tax revenues are inefficient tax collection and \nperceived tax evasion. Persistent budget deficits have led to high borrowing requirements, and \nsubsequent buildup of debts, domestic and foreign. The weak fiscal environment, inflationary \npressures, and policy uncertainty contributed to high borrowing costs. In 2004 the Government \nadopted  measures  to  increase  revenues  and  prepared  stringent  budgets  aimed  at  fiscal \nconsolidation.  \n \n21.  Debt  management  is  a  joint  responsibility  of  BSP,  Department  of  Budget  and \nManagement, DOF, and National Economic Development Authority. The Bureau of Treasury \n(BTr) under DOF has a central role as it issues debt securities, manages borrowed funds, and is \nresponsible for cash management for the Government. Programming, structuring, and timing of \ngovernment  borrowings  is  undertaken  jointly  with  BSP  and  Department  of  Budget  and \nManagement. Domestic debt consists of short-term treasury bills and bonds. Treasury bills are \nfor 91 days, 182 days, or 364 days. The bonds have a tenor of 2, 5, 7, 10, or 20 years. Treasury \nbills are auctioned every Monday and treasury bonds every second and fourth Tuesday. Thirty-\nthree  primary  dealers  are  licensed  to  take  part  in  the  auctions.  The  auction  process  is \nautomated  and  settlement  is  T+2.  BTr  operates  the  Registry  of  Scripless  Securities,  the \ndepository for government debt securities. Trading in the secondary market takes place over-\nthe-counter (OTC) by licensed dealers. BTr is also responsible for issuing international bonds. \nThe  annual  borrowing  target  is  communicated  to  the  markets;  while  the  timing,  size  for \nindividual issues, and currency composition are determined separately. Total public sector debt \nto GDP was 105% in September 2005; 72% was national Government debt. Of the Government \ndebt, 55% was domestic and 45% foreign, with the ratio gradually changing in favor of domestic \ndebt. Short-term debt made up 16% of total domestic and foreign debt, but 30% of domestic \ndebt. Public sector debt has increased through a buildup of contingent liabilities, especially \nthrough Government guarantees on debt to GOCC debt, in particular in the power sector.  \n \n22.  BTr is not in charge of the Government\u2019s contingent liabilities such as debts incurred by \nGOCCs,  guarantees  issued  to  private  sector  partnerships  such  as  build-operate-transfer \nprojects,  and  guarantees  for  loans  to  GOCCs.  These  corporations  are  managed  by  the \nCorporate Affairs Group in DOF, while the Bureau of Local Government Finance is responsible \nfor  monitoring  local  government  unit  borrowing.  Thus  several  agencies  are  involved  in \nmonitoring  various  aspects  of  public  sector  borrowing.  While  the  Development  Budget \nCoordinating Council10 is involved in government borrowing as part of the fiscal program, the \nmanagement of debt and contingent liabilities is not effective. The high debt and contingent \nliabilities call for enhanced efforts for coordination, monitoring, and management. Sound debt \nand risk management will increase investor confidence and bring about a more conducive \nenvironment for investment. \n                                                 \n10 The council consists of BSP, Department of Budget and Management, DOF, National Economic Development \nAuthority, and Office of the President. \n ", "    7 \nb.  Improve  Resolution  of  Banks  and  Strengthen  Financial \nIntermediation \n \n23.  NPA Resolution. High numbers of NPAs affect the lending behavior of banks and in \nturn can have adverse impacts on the systemic stability of the industry. Banks are deterred from \nlending  by  the  need  to  provide  capital  for  NPAs,  and  instead  seek  safer  profit-making \nopportunities by purchasing government debt. As a result, intermediation suffers. Managing the \nnonperforming assets that the state decides to take off the books of problem banks is central to \nbank restructuring efforts. To the extent that bank problems can be traced to relatively well-\ndefined chunks of NPAs, banks can be strengthened if these assets are taken off their books. \nWhile  various  institutional  arrangements  can  be  used  for  asset  management,  asset \nmanagement  companies  or  reconstruction  companies,  or  distinct  loan  workout  units  have \nplayed an important role in resolving systemic banking difficulties and could be considered as \npart of best practice. Asset management companies have typically been Government-initiated \nand owned. Much will depend on the extent of Government intervention in restructuring in terms \nof creating enabling provisions to facilitate the process. Countries such as Indonesia, Republic \nof Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand set up centralized asset management companies.  \n \n24.  Philippines banks were largely spared from the 1997 banking crisis due to the high \nprudential limits put in place by BSP prior to the breakout of the crisis. Only when NPAs started \nto rise to uncomfortable levels in 2000 did the Government decide to introduce a law enabling \nspeedy disposition of distressed assets. In view of its high fiscal deficits, the Government \ndecided to pass on the task of relieving banks of their distressed assets to the private sector \nthrough the passage of the Republic Act 9182, better known as the SPV Act (para. 10). The law \nprovides  guidelines  for  the  establishment  of  asset  management  companies  and  provides \nincentives on a number of taxes, such as the documentary stamp tax and capital gains.  \n \n25.  As the banking industry prepares for the adoption of pillar 3 of the Basel II risk-based \ncapital framework (para. 27), BSP is encouraging banks to prioritize NPA cleanup to avoid steep \ncapital charges. With or without the SPV extension, bank asset cleanup remains crucial in \nrestoring the supply of credit to the economy. \n \n26.  Financial Safety Net. Against the backdrop of the changing financial landscape and \nfinancial innovation driven by liberalization and improving technologies, a financial safety net is \nneeded to maintain the stability of the financial system and avert any financial crisis. Well-\nfunctioning deposit insurance reduces the possibility of a banking crisis. Bank runs are costly \nbecause they interfere with the financial intermediation performed by banks. Financial intermediation \nin a continuously changing financial environment can be complex and difficult. PDIC is central to \nsystemic stability in the Philippines through its role in the resolution of failed banks. PDIC, \ngoverned by a charter (amended in 2004) provides legal indemnification for PDIC officers, and \nraised  deposit  insurance  coverage  from  P100,000  to  P250,000  without  a  corresponding \nincrease in the assessment rates that form the basis for the DIF. A key consideration in designing \na pricing scheme for a deposit insurance system involves the choice of an assessment base. With \ncurrently more than 440 banks in receivership and the risk of many more needing assistance, \nthe DIF is less than the estimated adequate funds needed in relation to risks in the banking \nsystem. Equally important is developing the capacity or techniques to resolve failed institutions. \nPDIC\u2019s resolution methods are comparatively limited. The agency can purchase assets from a \nproblem bank, provide low-interest loans, or assume liabilities. PDIC cannot, however, purchase \nvoting or common stock. Furthermore, limited staff resources and existing rules contribute to \ncumbersome and ineffective processes for asset valuation, management, and disposal. \n \n ", "8 \n    c.  Strengthen Nonbank Financial Institutions \n \n27.  Risk-based capital adequacy (RBCA) is the international norm for banks in accordance \nwith the Basel Core Principles for Banking Supervision. The new framework, commonly referred \nto as Basel II, is due to come into effect in 2007. The use of RBCA is being extended to NBFIs \nin  contrast  to  using  only  a  minimum  or  net  capital  requirement.  SEC  followed  the  RBCA \napproach in 2004 by issuing a RBCA rule for broker dealers for implementation starting in 2005. \nBroker  dealers  were  the  starting  point  for  SEC  to  introduce  RBCA  for  NBFIs.  Insurance \ncompanies are only subject to minimum capital requirements, which are very low by regional \ncomparison. These requirements are deemed inadequate in relation to the scope of business \nand risks inherent in insurance. \n \n  2.  Strengthen Nonbank Financial Subsector Governance \n \n28.  SEC is tasked with regulating as well as developing capital markets. Previously, policy \nreforms  in  the  nonbank  financial  subsector  were  influenced  by  events  in  the  market  and \nresponses to events rather than by a long-term vision for the subsector and its role in the \neconomy. Such a vision and plan would aim to ensure a sound legal and regulatory framework \nto enhance governance and form the general framework and key parameters necessary for \nsubsector development. One milestone in financial sector development was reached in 2000 \nwhen the SRC was enacted, providing an updated legal framework for the securities market. \nThe SRC needs to be supplemented by a range of reforms to enable the capital markets to take \na larger role in financial intermediation. \n \n29.  Market Development. Most importantly, in view of the challenges, the sector needs a \nvision of financial market development and strong leadership to guide policy actions to achieve \nthat vision. While many Southeast Asian economies (e.g., Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and \nViet Nam) have master plans or blueprints for financial sector or capital market development, \nthe Philippines has lagged. Thus, while the SRC of 2000 provided a sound basis for regulation \nof capital markets, it did not explicitly clarify SEC\u2019s role in promoting market development or \naddress the corresponding implications for SEC\u2019s organizational and regulatory posture. This is \na crucial gap in the current context.  \n \n30.  In addressing challenges and formulating the agenda to be supported by the FMRIP, the \nGovernment formally adopted objectives for capital markets through the CMDP.11 The CMDP \nprovides a medium-term context (2005\u20132010) to set goals and milestones against the backdrop \nof financial innovation and regional and global financial sector integration, while providing the \nmeans to assess progress toward their attainment. \n \n31.  Transparency  and  Disclosure.  Accounting  and  auditing  standards  that  provide \naccurate information of companies\u2019 financial soundness are critical elements for governance \nand transparency. Globally, international accounting standards (IAS) and international financial \nreporting standards (IFRS) developed by the International Accounting Standards Board are \nbeing adopted. The Philippines accounting standards have been modeled on the United States \ngenerally  accepted  accounting  principles.  However,  in  2005  the  Philippine  Accounting \n                                                 \n11  The CMDP was developed under ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of \nDirectors on a Proposed Loan to the Republic of the Philippines for the Second Nonbank Financial Governance \nProgram. Manila. The CMDP originally covered the nonbank financial sector but based on the need for key \nlegislation to address key impediments to the development of investment companies, pre-need companies, and \ninsurance companies, which is outside the control of the executive branch, the decision was made to focus only on \nthe capital market. \n ", "    9 \nStandards Council resolved to adopt IAS and IFRS to bring Philippine standards in line with \ninternational best practice. For the financial sector, IAS 39, with provisions for mark-to-market of \nassets, is of particular importance in providing accurate valuation of investment portfolios. The \nPhilippines is also moving to full adoption of international auditing standards developed by the \nInternational Federation of Accountants. \n \n32.  Insurance.  The  insurance  subsector  is  governed  by  the  outdated  Insurance  Code \n(1974), which needs to be modernized to enable the Insurance Commission to fully carry out its \nmandate by giving it sufficient power to enforce the law and regulations. The commission is \ncurrently hampered, as compared to other regulators, as that it is not independent, is bound by \nthe salary standardization law, and has an unwieldy organizational structure. Implementing \nregulations build on the code, but have in some instances been upgraded to meet current \nrequirements. A self-assessment of compliance with the 28 core principles of the International \nAssociation of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) reveals that the Insurance Commission is not in full \ncompliance.  \n \n33.  The  Insurance  Commission  currently  has  a  functional  organizational  structure  with \nseparate divisions for licensing, financial analysis, etc. However the absence of a computer \nnetwork to facilitate the flow of information between departments has resulted in a lack of \noverview and thorough analysis of individual companies. The organization\u2019s current setup and \ninadequate business processes continue to hamper effective supervision of the industry. \n \n34.  Anti-Money Laundering. In 2001, the Government enacted the Anti-Money Laundering \nLaw and established the Anti-Money Laundering Council in BSP. The council has grown from a \nstaff of 8 to 56 in 5 years. Work on anti-money laundering continues to be strengthened and \nimplemented with ongoing ADB and other development partner support.12 As a result of the \nGovernment\u2019s excellent progress in implementing anti-money laundering reforms, the Financial \nAction Task Force (FATF) removed the Philippines from the list of noncooperative countries and \nterritories in February 2005. In June 2005, the Philippines was accepted as a member of the \nEgmont  Group  (an  international  group  of  financial  intelligence  units  focused  on  facilitating \ninformation sharing and promoting best practices). Following the enactment of the law, BSP and \nSEC strengthened related regulations and established procedures for cooperating and reporting \nto the Anti-Money Laundering Council. The Insurance Commission followed suit in November \n2005 and issued new regulations for anti-money laundering in line with the IAIS core principles \nfor regulation of insurance companies; monitoring of compliance is now needed. The Anti-\nMoney Laundering Council needs to provide ongoing training for staff of insurance companies \nwho are not conversant with the anti-money laundering law and regulations, and compliance \nwith them. \n \n35.  Market Supervision. SEC as the regulator of securities trading markets has, pursuant \nto the SRC, registered PSE as a self-regulatory organization (SRO). Pursuant to its status as an \nSRO, PSE is the primary regulator of the secondary securities market and thus is required to \neffectively undertake market surveillance of trading activities as well as inspection of member \nbrokerage firms to ensure compliance. The new fixed-income exchange, Philippine Dealing and \nExchange Corporation (PDEx), recently registered as an SRO with SEC, and will initially focus \non oversight of interdealer trading in fixed-income securities. \n \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2002.

The development and sustainability of financial markets depends on compliance with the \nlegal and regulatory framework to ensure that markets are operated fairly. Building credibility \nwith  investors  through  policy  consistency,  effective  regulation  and  supervision,  improved \nenforcement  and  surveillance,  and  continuous  dialogue  among  various  stakeholders  is  of \nparamount importance to creating a better investment climate. \n \n3.  Promote Securities Market Efficiency  \n \n37.  Liquidity in government debt markets is low. Most investors appear to buy and hold \ngovernment securities to maturity. The reasons for this are intertwined. A large number of debt \nissues make for a thin market. Further, most government debt is issued at shorter maturities \nand therefore few issues of long maturities are available for trading. The low turnover results in \nan inadequate yield curve, and hence no effective benchmarks. Borrowing and lending of debt \nsecurities and short selling would increase liquidity, but are only partially allowed.  \n \n38.  Notwithstanding the sluggish economic performance, the depth of financial markets and \nequity market capitalization in the Philippines exceeds those in many economies outside the \nregion with a similar or higher per capita income. However, the size of the markets and liquidity \nin secondary markets remains low in comparison with most other Southeast Asian economies. \nMalaysia and Thailand, in particular, have achieved strong performance in terms of overall \nfinancial deepening as well as in growth of bond and equity markets in recent years. Against this \nbackground, the Philippines faces twin challenges: first, that of catching up with its neighbors; \nand second, ensuring that it is able to participate in ongoing developments leading to a greater \nintegration  of  regional  markets  and  economies.  In  terms  of  the  latter,  facilitating  greater \nopenness to cross-border investment in equity and bond markets will require closer attention to \nadoption  of  harmonized  or  convergent  approaches  to  financial  reporting  standards  and \nsupervision and regulation of financial markets. This will be facilitated, and domestic financial \nmarkets will be strengthened, by strong and resolute policy action on the domestic front to bring \nstandards of financial governance and regulation, supervision, and enforcement capabilities to \ninternational standards. \n \n39.  Secondary trading in government bonds has been exclusively OTC, and bilateral or \nprivately negotiated with deals executed by telephone. An investor can thus receive different \nprices from different dealers as the system has no efficient price discovery. Complete data of \nsecondary  trades  does  not  exist.  This  lack  of  transparency  means  that  trading  volumes, \nturnover, or depth cannot be measured.  \n \n40.  Corporate debt is dominated by commercial paper. Commercial papers range from less \nthan a year to 3 years and are often held by the underwriter or a small group of investors.13 The \nsecondary market in commercial paper is opaque as all trading takes place OTC and no data is \ncollected  on  pricing.  Indeed  the  clearing  and  settlement  risks  to  secondary  trading  are \nincreasing causes of concern and provide the basis for measures to separate custodian and \nbrokerage functions as well as for other measures directed at improving the payments system. \n \n41.  Liquidity in the equity market is low for several reasons. One is the limited free float of \nlisted equities.14 The relevant rules for borrowing and lending in securities are expected to be \napproved soon. Another liquidity supporting measure is short selling of securities, which is \n                                                 \n13  Commercial paper receives favorable tax treatment in contrast to corporate bonds. Thus, the term is often used to \nrefer to medium-term debt in the Philippines in contrast to the use of this term in other capital markets.  \n14  Although the PSE listing rules require listed companies to maintain a free float of 10% of outstanding capital stock, \nthese rules have been suspended. \n ", "    11 \npartially allowed under SEC rules but the current rule is insufficient for short selling to work as a \nliquidity-enhancing measure.  \n \n42.  Scripless securities have become the norm in developed markets with electronic trading, \nclearance, and settlement. PSE through its central depository uses the computerized book-entry \nsystem to transfer ownership of securities from one account to another, thus eliminating the \nneed for physical exchange of scrip between buyer and seller. However, a significant holding of \nsecurities is still in the physical form. Under the current system, the investor has the option to \nhold on to the certificate (uplift) or deposit (lodge) this certificate with the depository. Physical \ntransfer of bond certificates is not permissible. Migration to a scripless environment for the \nequities market is desirable to achieve lower transaction costs for intermediaries and clients, \nreduce settlement risks associated with failures for the timely delivery of securities, and facilitate \neventual reduction of the settlement cycle. The 2002 E-commerce Law provides the basis for \nlegal recognition of electronic ownership. However, the current legal and regulatory framework, \nmarket infrastructure, and market players do not support full dematerialization. \n \n  4.  Lessons \n \n43.  ADB has supported reforms in the financial sector for more than 10 years, with three \nprogram  loans  between  1995  and  2004.  These  include  (i)  Capital  Market  Development \nProgram,15 (ii) Nonbank Financial Governance Program,16 and (iii) Second Nonbank Financial \nGovernance  Program  (SNFGP).17 Through  this  continuous  support  ADB  has  maintained \nongoing policy dialogue with the Government, regulatory agencies, industry associations, and \nmarket players. The United States Agency for International Development is the only other \ndevelopment partner providing consistent long-term support through extensive TA in the sector. \nADB  and  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  consult  closely  to  ensure \ncomplementarity. The development coordination matrix is in Appendix 3. \n \n44.  The First Program: Laying the Legal Foundation. The Capital Market Development \nProgram loan was to (i) consolidate the two stock exchanges, (ii) encourage transparency and \naccountability through increased public disclosure of financial information, and (iii) build capacity \nand market confidence. The second tranche of the loan was linked to the enactment of a new \nsecurities law and policy actions dependent on the new law. Substantial delays in the legal \nprocess resulted in cancellation of the second tranche in December 1999.  \n \n45.  The  Second  Program:  Strengthening  the  Regulatory  Framework.  The  Capital \nMarket Development Program loan laid the foundation for further reforms. The SRC, enacted in \n2000, and its implementing rules and regulations, provided the legal and regulatory framework \nto pursue governance reforms in the sector. These reforms were supported by the Nonbank \nFinancial  Governance  Program  (designed  as  a  single  tranche  loan),  which  included  (i) \nrestructuring SEC and strengthening its monitoring and enforcement capacity; (ii) modernizing \nPSE\u2019s governance and regulatory structure; (iii) strengthening market oversight, compliance, \nand enforcement; and (iv) facilitating diversification and innovation in corporate financing.  \n \n                                                 \n15 ADB. 1995.

Manila. \n ", "12 \n46.  The  Third  Program:  Deepening  the  Nonbank  Financial  Market.  The  SNFGP, \napproved in September 2003, was to promote development of the nonbank financial subsector \nby (i) strengthening the regulatory and policy framework for developing viable institutions and \nproperly  functioning  financial  markets;  (ii) continuing  to  strengthen  SEC\u2019s  enforcement \ncapacities, and supervisory skills and practices; (iii) improving transparency to protect investors \nfrom fraud, insolvency, or misconduct; and (iv) facilitating mobilization of domestic saving to \nincrease supplies of funds while ensuring investor protection. A key element in these reforms \nwas the establishment of the anti-money laundering regime. The SNFGP was designed as a \ntwo-tranche loan. Government compliance with the second tranche reforms were accelerated \nand completed ahead of schedule; the second tranche was released early in November 2004. \n \n47.  Key Lessons. The key lessons from these programs and reinforced in the program \ncompletion report for the SNGFP18 is the need to avoid making a program dependent on \nenactment  of  laws.  To  the  extent  that  legal  amendments  are  necessary,  programs  can \neffectively  support  drafting  and  advocacy,  and  enhance  the  regulatory  framework  that \ncomplements legislative changes. Moreover, simply changing a law or regulation will not modify \nbehavior in the absence of strong enforcement. Program design should necessarily focus on \nreforms  where  commitment  is  strong  and  adequate  resources  available  for  successful \nimplementation. While funding for Government agencies remains limited, key reform initiatives \nrequire  adequate  resources  to  strengthen  regulatory  capacity,  especially  in  the  area  of \nmonitoring and enforcement. Likewise, until enforcement officials are sufficiently protected from \nfrivolous and intimidating lawsuits, expecting strong enforcement actions may be unrealistic. A \nsecond  lesson  is  the  importance  of  stakeholder  involvement,  which  has  been  critical  to \nachieving the policy reforms supported by the Nonbank Financial Governance Program and \nSNFGP. The market participants through their respective associations should be consulted and \nbrought into the reform process to ensure effective implementation.  \n \n48.  These lessons are underscored by the program performance audit report for the Capital \nMarket  Development  Program,  which  stresses  the  importance  of  (i)  a  medium-term  policy \nframework supported by a program cluster and tranching structure that ensures adequate time \nand flexibility in formulation and implementation of a reform agenda; (ii) need for participatory \ndialogue and prior passage of laws; (iii) emergence of stakeholder voice and a reform champion; \nand (iv) design of TA to ensure adequate funds are made available for a sufficiently long \nduration,  with  a  view  not  only  to  develop  policy  recommendations,  but  also  to  support \nimplementation. The FMRIP has incorporated these lessons as well as those emerging from the \nReview of ADB\u2019s Approach to Conditionality.19 Thus, the FMRIP has been framed within the \ncontext  of  a  medium-term  program  cluster  that  reflects  (i)  ADB\u2019s  confidence  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s commitment to a medium-term agenda in which it has ownership, (ii) a focus less \non traditional conditionality and more on a broad assessment of progress and implementation \ncapacity  of  the  authorities,  and  (iii)  program  design  aligned  to  assist  the  authorities  in \nimplementing and operationalizing their strategy. \n \n49.  The  impact  of  ADB  assistance  is  assessed  in  the  country  assistance  program \nevaluation,20 which highlights that in the aggregate ADB\u2019s significant volume of support to \nPhilippines during 1986\u20132002 did not translate to a commensurate level of intended outcomes. \nIn keeping with the evaluation recommendations, CSP lending for 2005\u20132007 is more prioritized \n                                                 \n18  ADB 2006.

Accordingly, conditions were formulated \nwith increased focus on outcomes to allow for greater flexibility in actions to achieve compliance. \n \n50.  The challenge now is to take up, extend, and deepen reforms initiated under the SNFGP. \nThis is predicated on the need for a policy and institutional response to the significant market \ndevelopments since SNFGP completion. These include the need to underpin growth prospects \nthrough improved financial intermediation; respond to the regulatory and supervision challenges \nposed by the demutualization of PSE and establishment of a new exchange for fixed-income \ninstruments; address capital adequacy, market fragmentation, and regulatory capacity in the \ninsurance subsector; facilitate enhanced risk transfer mechanisms through the promotion of new \nfinancial instruments such as securitized assets; and promote a greater capacity to hedge and \nmanage risks in the context of regionally and globally integrated financial markets. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n51.  The FMRIP aims to promote a more diversified set of financial markets that are also \nmore efficient and resilient. This is to be achieved through more liquid markets, in particular \nthrough unlocking the potential of securities markets by way of measures that (i) promote \nliquidity,  financial  deepening,  and  strengthened  intermediaries;  (ii)  enhance  information \nreporting and disclosure standards through convergence to international standards; (iii) develop \na  broader  investor  base;  (iv)  reduce  systemic  risk  and  lower  transactions  costs  through \nimproved settlement and payment systems; and (v) strengthen policy and regulatory capabilities \nto address the legal, regulatory, supervision, financial governance, and enforcement challenges \nof a more open and integrated (both regionally and globally) economy and financial sector.  \n \n52.  These objectives will be achieved through a mix of reforms at various levels, including \npolicy, governance, institutions, and operations. From a market perspective, subprogram 1 will \ncover debt and equity markets, deposit insurance, and the insurance subsector. The policy \nreform agenda, to be financed through a program loan, is also supported by an attached TA to \nsupport implementation of policy reform actions. The development policy letter and policy matrix \nfor the reform agenda is provided in Appendix 4. \n \n53.  The FMRIP is being provided in the context of a difficult macroeconomic environment in \nwhich investors and businesses have identified key requirements to renewed investments and \ngrowth  as  the  following:  macroeconomic  and  policy  stability;  provision  of  infrastructure; \nimproved investment climate and governance; and enhanced financial markets intermediation. \nADB\u2019s support package to the Government in 2006 responds to these critical needs through two \nsector programs: for power sector reform and the present program for financial market reforms, \nwhich are being processed in parallel. In addition, ADB, jointly with the World Bank, is proposing \nto process the Development Policy Support Program, which will provide an anchor for sector \nreforms targeted by the Government while addressing key issues in relation to long-term fiscal \nconsolidation, the investment climate, governance, and protection of social sectors.  \n  \n54.  Subprogram  I  is  designed  to  be  a  single  tranche  operation,  with  a  well-defined \nframework to align with the Government\u2019s CMDP that is anchored in the MTPDP (Figure 1). \nFormulation of subprogram was closely coordinated with various stakeholders, including the \nprivate sector and other development partners. Consideration of subprogram 2 will depend on \nthe triggers set by the CSP for 2008 (Table 1) as well as progress in (i) implementation of the \nCMDP action plan, (ii) reforms in the insurance subsector, and (iii) resolution of banks. This \n ", "14 \nmomentum is needed to develop the financial sector in order to benefit from integration in \nregional and global capital markets over the medium and long term. \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n \n55.  The goal of subprogram 1 is to increase the contribution of the financial sector to \neconomic growth, poverty reduction, and development of the Philippines by promoting a more \nefficient financial sector that can finance profitable private investment projects at lower cost and \nrisk than at present. Subprogram 1 will aim to (i) reduce financial sector vulnerabilities, and \nincrease the depth and diversity of financial intermediation through improved resolution of banks \nand stronger NBFIs; (ii) strengthen investor confidence with improved regulation, governance, \nand transparency; and (iii) improve operational efficiency of the securities market. Subprogram \n1 supports the Government\u2019s financial sector reform agenda, with a focus on development of \ncapital markets and other nonbank services. \n \n56.  The policy measures include a set of financial sector reforms to promote diversification \nof financial channels, and enhance transparency and market efficiencies in intermediation. \nDiversification  when  combined  with  governance  reform  may  contribute  to  spillovers  and \nexternalities that can increase the sector\u2019s contribution to economic growth and development. \nThe reform agenda is structured around the following policy outcomes, which form the basis of \nthree components for subprogram 1: \n \n(i)  Enhance financial system stability. \n(ii)  Strengthen nonbank financial subsector governance. \n(iii)  Improve overall efficiency of the securities markets. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "    15 \n \nFigure 1: Medium-Term Development Plan and \nFinancial Market Regulation and Intermediation Program \n \nMedium-Term Development Plan \n(2004\u20132010) \n \n(one of five priorities) \nEconomic Growth and Job Creation \n \n(one of nine focal areas)  \nFinancial Sector \n \nCapital Market Development Plan Blue Print for  \nGrowth and Expanded Contributions to the Philippine Economy, 2005\u20132010 \n \nPrimary goals of reforms  \n(cid:190)  Mobilize savings to achieve a savings to GDP rate of 25%\u201330%.  \n(cid:190)  Support an increase in investment ratio to 28% of GDP.  \n(cid:190)  Increase amount of resources channeled to support the development of agribusiness, including lending to micro, \nsmall, and medium-sized enterprises. \n \nEleven Strategic Objectives \n \nObjectives \n1\u20134:  \n(cid:190)  Government\u2019s acceptance and role in overseeing Capital Market Development Plan implementation through \n2010 \n(cid:190)  Government\u2019s commitment to macroeconomic goals and tax reforms designed to increase personal savings and \nlong-term investment via the capital market \n5\u20136:  \n(cid:190)  Accelerate growth and efficiency in allocating savings to issuers seeking long-term capital through key capital \nmarket institutions and various business strategies and reforms \n7\u201310 \n(cid:190)  Focus on series of legal and regulatory issues that ensure effective oversight and enforcement surveillance \n(cid:190)  Align the framework for financial regulation with current standards or best practices \n11 \n(cid:190)  Address issues of investor education and corporate governance  \n \n \n \n \nNPLs\n+ \nCMDP  +  Insurance Resolution of Banks \n \n  PDIC\n \nSupported by ADB through \n \n \nFMRIP Program I 2006  FMRIP Program II 2008 \nTriggers: CSP Fiscal Targets  Triggers: CSP Fiscal Targets 2008 \nApproved of Capital Market Development Plan (CMDP)  Progress and Implementation of CMDP \nAdoption of Action Plan for Implementation of CMDP  Progress in Insurance and PDIC Components \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CMDP = Capital Market Development Plan, CSP = country strategy and program, \nFMRIP  =  Financial  Market  Regulation  and  Intermediation  Program,  GDP  =  gross  domestic  product,  NPL  = \nnonperforming loan, PDIC = Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation \nSources: Philippines, Government of. 2004.

Reforms will reduce financial sector vulnerabilities and reduce systemic risks that are \ncentral to promoting financial sector development. Subprogram 1 supports the Government\u2019s \nefforts in improving its debt and risk management strategy in the face of large debt obligations \nand contingent liabilities to achieve macroeconomic and financial system stabilization. \n \n58.  Debt Issuance. BTr is central to the Government\u2019s efforts to manage Government debt. \nBTr has enhanced transparency and predictability by announcing issuance schedules well in \nadvance and communicating international borrowing requirements to the markets. The policy is \nto reduce foreign currency borrowing, while diversifying and borrowing in a range of currencies. \nThe Philippines has benefited from the general trend among global investors to allocate more \nfunds to emerging market bonds and the compression in spreads for emerging market debt. \nFrom June 2005 to May 2006, the spread of Philippine bonds declined from 478 to 140 basis \npoints.  BTr  has  successfully  reduced  the  share  of  variable  debt  rate  to  below  10%  of \ninternational bonds and kept the interest rate of fixed-rate debt at around 6%. A concerted effort \nis  being  pursued  to  consolidate  domestic  debt.  In  February  2006,  BTr  undertook  a  debt \nexchange with the objective of reducing the series of outstanding bonds to create fewer, more \nliquid  instruments,  and  establish  benchmarks.  Various  series  of  outstanding  Government \nsecurities were swapped for new bonds with 3-, 5-, 7- and 10- year maturities. A total amount of \nP111 billion was exchanged.  \n \n59.  Debt and Risk Management. An ongoing ADB TA21 aims at improving the national debt \nand risk management function and establishing a process of more effective monitoring and \ncoordination of debt and risk management functions. The TA is expected to be completed by \nJune 2007. In addition, a new TA was approved in July 200622 to support the Government\u2019s \nfiscal consolidation measures through reforms in financial performance and monitoring of the \nGOCCs. The TA is expected to be implemented from December 2006 to July 2008. While the \ndevelopment of an enhanced debt and risk management strategy forms part of the indicative \npolicy actions under subprogram 2, the components relating to GOCC reforms is likely to be \ncovered under the proposed Development Policy Support Program (para. 53).  \n \n60.  The  Government\u2019s  other  fiscal  consolidation  initiatives  including  measures  for \nbroadening the tax base, adjusting tax rates, and strengthening tax administration are outside \nthe scope of Subprogram 1 as these comprise the fiscal triggers for policy-based lending as \nidentified in the CSP (para. 7).  \n \nb.  Improve  Resolution  of  Banks  and  Strengthen  Financial \nIntermediation \n61.  NPA Resolution. BSP has been diligent in implementing international best practices in \nregulation of the banking industry (total assets account for almost 80% of the total resources of \nthe banking system) and in its resolve to ensure the systemic stability of the industry. This has \nbeen underpinned by continuing financial reforms and the ability of BSP to proactively respond \n                                                 \n21 ADB. 2005.

The improvement in overall asset quality has been \nsupported by progress in the disposition of the banking system\u2019s NPAs through the SPV Act. \n \n62.  The SPV Act sought to encourage financial institutions to dispose of NPAs, comprising \nmainly infected loans (60%) resulting from the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The law provided for \ntax incentives and other privileges for the disposition of NPAs that are recognized as SPV-\nrelated transactions. The industry experienced a gradual reduction in NPLs. To maintain this \nmomentum, BSP advocated the extension of the SPV Act to enable further asset cleanup. The \naim is to dispose off at least another P100 billion from the banking system\u2019s inventory of \nremaining NPAs and thereby bring the banking industry\u2019s NPA/NPL ratios closer to the precrisis \nlevel.  In  April  2006,  the  Republic  Act  9343  was  signed  extending  the  deadline  for  the \nestablishment of an SPV from 19 September 2004 to 18 months from effectiveness of the \namended law. In addition, the amended law resets the deadline for availing of tax benefits from \nApril 2005 to 2 years from the effectiveness of the new law. Subprogram 1 supports the \nGovernment\u2019s legislative effort to facilitate reduction of the number of NPLs and thereby ensure \nsystemic banking stability.  \n \n63.  Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation. If necessary, PDIC will report to Congress \non recommended adjustments to its charter in relation to the adequacy of the DIF following the \nincrease in deposit insurance coverage without a corresponding increase in the assessment \nrate. The indicative analysis points to a shortfall of around P50 billion in the DIF in relation to \nestimated risks for a time period. PDIC has likewise formulated an investment and trading policy \nto help buildup the DIF and is currently strengthening its risk management system. The Program \nwill support PDIC in identifying legal amendments to revise resolution methods and consider \nadditional options and instruments to address bank failures, and address concerns in asset \nvaluation, management and disposal, and strengthen the framework to select strategic investors \nas an integral part of bank failure resolution. In addition, the FMRIP will support PDIC in \ndeveloping  and  adopting  new  procedures  for  provision  of  financial  assistance  to  banks  to \nensure judicious exercise of authority and in designing a suitable package at least cost. A \nframework will be developed for efficient disposal of assets of closed banks and those acquired \nfrom  banks  with  financial  assistance.  Finally,  PDIC  will  develop  a  contingency  plan  in \ncoordination with BSP for managing the failure of large banks and successive failures of smaller \nbanks. \n \n  c.  Strengthen Nonbank Financial Institutions \n \n64.  Risk-Based  Capital  Adequacy.  The  increasing  sophistication  of  financial  markets \ncarries high inherent risks that must be adequately addressed through strong regulatory and \nsupervisory regimes, as well as adequate risk management systems and tools. This component \naims to reduce financial risks in the sector by strengthening the capital base of NBFIs. The \ninsurance industry has very low capital requirements and is unevenly capitalized with respect to \nrisk. Many small companies have inadequate capital in relation to underwritten insurance risks. \nTo strengthen capitalization in the industry, minimum capitalization requirements for new life \nand nonlife insurance companies is set at P1 billion, and at P2 billion for new reinsurance \ncompanies,  effective  1  July  2006.  Existing  life  and  nonlife  companies  will  be  required  to \nincrease net worth to reach P100 million by 31 December 2006.  \n \n65.  In  addition  to  the  minimum  capitalization  requirement,  subprogram  1  supports  the \nintroduction of RBCA to ensure that capital is adequate in relation to risks. The formula, to be \neffective from 1 August 2007, will be different for life and nonlife insurance companies, reflecting \n ", "18 \nthe different nature of life and nonlife insurance. RBCA will be calculated based on the annual \nfinancial statements. Insurance companies will be given 2 years to comply. \n \n66.  The  minimum  capitalization  for  insurance  brokers  will  also  be  raised.  For  existing \ninsurance and reinsurance brokers, minimum capital will be increased to P2 million by 31 \nDecember 2006, and then increased by P2 million each year to reach P10 million by 31 \nDecember  2010.  For  new  entrants  offering  either  insurance  or  reinsurance,  the  paid-up \ncapitalization is set at P20 million effective 1 July 2006. For new entrants intending to broker \nboth insurance and reinsurance the minimum paid-up capitalization is P50 million effective 1 \nJuly 2006.  \n \n67.  With respect to compliance with the RBCA rules for the securities market, every broker \ndealer covered by the RBCA rules is required to prepare its RBCA report at the end of the \nmonth and file it with SEC on or before the 15th of the following month. SEC is in the process of \nenhancing  its  supervisory  framework  to  ensure  compliance  with  this  requirement.  Policy \nmeasures under component 1 are summarized in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Policy Measures to Enhance Financial System Stability  \n \nSubprogram 1  Indicative for Subprogram 2 \n1.

Component 2: Strengthen Nonbank Financial Subsector Governance  \n \n68.  Capital Market Development Plan. SEC will oversee reforms to enhance governance \nstandards to increase investor confidence through improved transparency and supervision. To \nguide capital market development and firmly anchor the agenda with stakeholders, the CMDP \n(para. 19), sets forth 11 objectives for capital market development and defined initiatives for \n ", "    19 \nGovernment agencies, key market institutions, and other key stakeholders. Other Association of \nSoutheast  Asian  Nations  countries  such  as  Malaysia,  Indonesia,  and  Thailand  have  all \npublished capital market development plans. The CMDP will be published and disseminated as \nthe guiding policy document for capital market reforms. \n \n69.  The CMDP\u2019s 11 strategic objectives are grouped in four sections. The first sets forth the \nGovernment\u2019s support for the plan, its role in overseeing implementation, and its commitment to \npursue a sound macroeconomic policy environment conducive to growth. The section also \ndiscusses the need to rationalize financial sector taxes to create equal opportunities for similar \nproducts and remove distortions to encourage savings and investments. The second section \nfocuses on key capital market institutions, and strategies and reforms envisaged to accelerate \nefficiency and market growth. The third section deals with a series of legal and regulatory \nmeasures  that  regulators  need  to  adopt  to  ensure  effective  oversight  and  enforcement, \nstrengthen investor protection, and align the regulatory framework with current global standards \nand  practices.  The  fourth  section  highlights  investor  education  and  corporate  governance. \nReform initiatives under the CMDP, along with an indicative timetable that was confirmed with \nresponsible implementing agencies, are set forth in a related action plan. DOF approved the \nCMDP and SEC formally adopted the CMDP and published it on its website in October 2006. \nSEC will have primary responsibility for monitoring progress in implementing the CMDP and \nrelated action plan. SEC recently established an internal monitoring unit to monitor progress in \nimplementation and provide regular reports (at least every 4 months) highlighting achievements \nand related implementation issues. \n \n70.  Transparency and Disclosure. The Accounting Standards Council firmly aligned the \nPhilippine accounting standards with the IAS and the Philippine financial reporting standards \nwith the IFRS starting in 2005. IAS 39 is particularly important as it provides for mark-to-market \naccounting of assets and more accurate valuation of assets and capital adjustments. Alignment \nwith  the  IFRS  means  financial  reporting  will  be  comparable  to  international  standards. \nSubprogram  1  supports  the  SEC  and  Insurance  Commission  move  to  requiring  financial \ninstitutions under their respective jurisdictions to comply with the new Philippine accounting \nstandards starting in 2005 and Philippine financial reporting standards in 2006. SEC and the \nInsurance Commission have identified the importance of well-qualified external auditors for \nfinancial institutions, and started to accredit external auditors and publish lists of accredited \nauditors. \n \n71.  Legal and Regulatory Framework. To improve the legal and regulatory framework for \nthe insurance industry, the Insurance Code needs to be amended. Critical elements of the \nproposed amendments to the law include (i) providing rules for appointing the commissioner \nand deputy commissioners on a fixed-term basis and removing them, (ii) developing exemptions \nfrom the salary standardization law to put the Insurance Commission on par with BSP and SEC, \n(iii)  providing  the  Insurance  Commission  with  appropriate  powers  to  impose  sanctions  on \ninsurance  companies  that  fail  to  comply  with  regulations,  and  (iv)  preparing  the  expected \ntransfer of pre-need companies to the jurisdiction of the Insurance Commission. The draft code \nneeds to be supplemented by implementing rules and regulations. Subprogram 1 supports the \ndrafting and submission to DOF of an amended code. \n \n72.  In parallel, the Insurance Commission intends to bring regulations fully in line with the \nIAIS 28 core principles. The draft amendments to the insurance code incorporate principles \nrelating to the legal framework. Of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, only Malaysia \nand Singapore have implemented the 28 principles, whereas Indonesia is in the process of \ndoing so. The FMRIP will support a strategy for full implementation of the 28 principles.  \n ", "20 \n \n73.  Insurance Commission. To achieve effective supervision, the Insurance Commission \nproposes to reorganize from a functional setup with no information flow between units to a \nstructure with teams responsible for a group of insurance companies from licensing to financial \nanalysis to ensure consistent and thorough analysis of the companies, and consequent solid \ninformation underpinning supervision. The proposal has been endorsed by DOF and is currently \nwith the Department of Budget Management.  \n \n74.  Protection  of  Regulators.  Legal  protection  in  the  course  of  duty  is  critical  for \nsupervisors to allow them to carry out their mandates effectively. Subprogram 1 will support \npreparation of amendments to the Securities Regulation Code (SRC) and Insurance Code to \nenhance legal protection for SEC and Insurance Commission staff acting in good faith, and \nprovide SEC and the Insurance Commission with stronger enforcement powers. \n \n75.  As the supervisor of exchanges, SEC needs to have effective oversight over the trading \nmarkets in fixed-income securities in line with the SRC. While PSE began implementing a new \nframework for self-regulation in 2004, a review is warranted to ensure that PSE is in full \ncompliance. Subprogram 1 supports the finalization of PDEx\u2019s SRO status and review of PSE\u2019s \nSRO status. Policy measures under component 2 are summarized in Table 3. \n \nTable 3: Policy Measures to Strengthen Nonbank Financial Subsector Governance \n \nSubprogram 1  Indicative for Subprogram 2 \n1.

Component 3: Improve Efficiency of the Securities Market  \n \n76.  Investors, in particular, institutional investors, need a wide range of instruments with \nsufficient depth and secondary market activity to effectively manage their investment portfolios. \nImproved  market  efficiency  and  liquidity  in  the  securities  market  is  predicated  on  better \ninformation  disclosure  to  aid  price  discovery,  on  improved  clearance  and  settlement \nmechanisms to enhance efficiency and reduce transactions costs, and by the emergence of a \nbroader  investor  base  looking  for  attractive  investment  vehicles.  In  view  of  the  significant \npotential for improving the scope of disclosure of material information, the enhanced accounting \nand financial reporting standards supported by subprogram 1 set the stage for deepening \nsecurities markets.  \n \n77.  Secondary Markets. The organization of the secondary market in debt securities as an \nOTC  market has resulted in poor price discovery, an inadequate yield curve, and lack of \n ", "22 \neffective  benchmarks.  The  establishment  of  PDEx  promotes  effective  price  discovery  and \ntransparency, which provides for a more efficient market and an active yield curve. PDEx has \nlaunched an interdealer negotiated dealing board. In a bid to bring more trades onto the board, \nPDEx  introduced  an  interdealer  order-driven  system  for  firm  bids  and  offer  quotes  on  an \nanonymous basis. The next steps include expansion of trading to qualified investors and the \nretail trading markets, and preparation for listing and trading of private fixed-income securities, \nsubject to SEC approval of listing and trading rules. PDEx has also signed a memorandum of \nagreement with BTr to provide PDEx with access to the Registry of Scripless Securities to allow \nfor straight-through processing of secondary trades of government debt securities. To support \ntransparency, BSP has passed regulations requiring the establishment of independent third-\nparty custodians, thus introducing the needed separation between custodian and brokerage \nfunctions. \n \n78.  In  parallel  with  the  development  of  PDEx,  SEC  recently  approved  a  new  rule  that \nrequires all OTC trades to be reported to a centralized trade reporting facility to enhance price \ntransparency. Subprogram 1 supports SEC\u2019s efforts to improve liquidity by authorizing securities \nborrowing and lending by NBFIs under SEC\u2019s jurisdiction.  \n \n79.  New Financial Instruments. The Securitization Act of 2004 was adopted to provide a \nlegal framework for securitized issues and to enable the development of the secondary market \nfor asset-backed securities. The implementing rules and regulations of the act were adopted on \n25 March 2005. Securitization of assets in particular will contribute to developing instruments \nthat will be attractive to a broader class of investors for whom these instruments provide \ndiversification into a different form of investments with better risk and return characteristics. \nSimilarly, for originators, securitization offers a cheaper form of financing. While securitization \nprovides  avenues  for  more  efficient  transfer  of  risks  to  capital  markets  and  NBFIs,  a \ncorresponding  need  for  caution  arises  for  pursuing  development  of  complex  securitized \ntransactions that involve foreign exchange and interest rate risks. The emergence of derivative \nproducts and different market players, and improved risk management tools will help reduce the \nrisks of securitized deals.  \n \n80.  Transactions Costs. Over the medium term, improvements are needed to the securities \nmarket infrastructure of electronic trading platforms, clearing, settlement, and payment systems. \nThe Philippines scores well regionally for its clearance and settlement system, but falls short of \nits neighbors in postsettlement risks. The principal drawback relates to the efficiency of the \ndepositary and transfer infrastructure of the securities, and to payments finality of the cash \nsegment of the system. Payment is still based on netting of the cash segment and this is hence \nnot a true real-time gross payment system (it is a model 2 delivery versus payment system). By \ncontrast, BSP\u2019s large-value settlement and payment system is a genuine real-time gross system. \nLinking the securities and cash legs of the financial markets settlement and payment system to \nBSP\u2019s  large-value  system  would  improve  the  efficiency  of  financial  markets  and  reduce \nsystemic risks. It would also allow for better integration to external payment systems and hence \nfacilitate regional integration. The Government is assessing the potential for reforms in this area \nthrough TA provided by the International Monetary Fund. Policy measures under component 3 \nare summarized in Table 4. \n \nTable 4: Policy Measures to Improve Efficiency of the Securities Market  \n \nSubprogram 1  Indicative for Subprogram 2 \n1.

Important Features \n \n81.  The FMRIP has a number of distinct and innovative features. First, strong Government \nownership and commitment for the development of the nonbank financial sector through the \nadoption of the CMDP  that represent a combination of economic, business as well as legal and \nregulatory factors that aims to materially influence the development of the Philippines capital \nmarket as an engine of economic growth for the country. \n \n82.  Second,  FMRIP  emphasizes  qualitative  changes  in  processes  to  ensure  effective \nimplementation rather than a mere focus on conditionalities that do not yield clear results on the \nground. Accordingly, conditions were formulated with increased focus on outcome to allow for \ngreater flexibility in actions to achieve compliance. \n \n83.  Third, FMRIP recognizes the importance of providing predictable program support over \n  \nthe  medium  term  against  satisfactory  assessment  of  broad  progress  made. FMRIP  is \n ", "24 \npredicated  on  the  need  for  a  policy  and  institutional  response  to  significant  market \ndevelopments since the completion of the SNFGP. \n \n84.  Fourth, FMRIP has helped establish a program coordination committee that will be \nresponsible for implementing the action plan adopted for the CDMP.   \n \n85.  FMRIP includes an indicative policy reform agenda for Subprogram 2 that builds upon \nSubprogram 1 reforms thus providing for flexibility in developing the second program. This is \nfurther facilitated by the availability of TA funds to develop policy recommendations, as well as \nsupport implementation. \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n \n86.  The Government has requested a loan of $200,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance subprogram 1 of the FMRIP. The loan will have a 15-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, and a commitment charge of \n0.75% per annum. ADB\u2019s Board has waived the front-end fee of 1.00% for loans approved \nbefore 30 June 2007. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to \nborrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, \nand (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in \nreliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The Government envisages a loan of \n$200,000,000 will be needed to finance subprogram 2. The loan for subprogram 1, expected to \nbe utilized over 18 months from December 2006 to June 2008, will be released in one tranche \nupon meeting the conditions of the policy matrix and upon loan effectiveness. Prior to the \nprocessing of subprogram 2, the Government will have to demonstrate satisfactory progress \nwith program implementation under subprogram 1. \n \n87.  The size of the proposed loan is based on (i) the importance of the sector to reinvigorate \ngrowth, and (ii) the weight of the proposed reforms over the medium term. The political costs \ninvolved in implementing the reforms are considerable. The economic benefits greatly outweigh \nthe costs yet only the costs immediately manifest, while the benefits take time to fully emerge. \nCurrently vested interests benefit from weak enforcement of securities and insurance subsector \nregulation; regulatory arbitrage; risky but profitable insurance business; and the absence of \nadequate risk-management, supervision, and transparency in the areas of securities trading. \nThe cost of not (or delay in) implementing the reforms normally associated with such delays, \nwould be substantially higher for the economy than adjustment costs. Market forces need an \neffective and transparent regulatory framework. In the absence of timely reforms, the financial \nsector will continue to be ineffective in intermediating resources for productive investment, \nfinancial institutions will remain vulnerable to systemic risks, and investors will be vulnerable to \nfraud and misconduct. \n \n88.  In  addition,  the  direct  adjustment  costs  comprise  the  following  components:  (i)  the \nestimated shortfall in the DIF (with currently more than 440 banks under receivership and the \nrisk of many more needing assistance, the DIF is far short of the estimated amount of about $1 \nbillion needed in relation to the risks in the banking system); (ii) the foregone revenues resulting \nfrom the resolution of NPAs under the SPV Act; and (iii) improvements needed to the securities \nmarket infrastructure and institutional capacity as detailed in para. 89. The fiscal benefits under \nthe SPV Act include exemption from payment of documentary stamp tax, capital gains tax, \ncreditable withholding tax, and value-added tax or gross receipts tax. Transactions qualified \nunder the SPV Act are entitled to various fee reductions such as mortgage and land registration, \n ", "    25 \nfiling fees, and transfer fees. In addition, banks are allowed to deduct a portion of these losses \nfrom the SPV transactions from their taxable gross income for up to 10 years. With an estimated \nP100 billion of NPAs to be disposed of under the provisions of the SPV Act, the loss in revenues \ndue to the various incentives provided is estimated at $100 million.  \n \n89.  Improvements are needed to the securities market infrastructure of electronic trading \nplatforms, clearing, settlement, and payment systems (para. 80). The CMDP also recommends \ncomprehensive tax reform to rationalize incentives to the financial sector. Other costs include: \n \n(i)  developing human resources to establish effective supervision and enforcement, \nwhich  requires  SEC,  Insurance  Commission,  and  PDIC  to  enhance  their \nregulatory requirements, broaden the scope of supervision, upgrade inspection \nmanuals,  and  finance  staff  training;  and  to  invest  very  heavily  in  skill \nenhancement at all levels ($10 million over the FMRIP period); \n(ii)  increasing  minimum  capital  requirements  in  the  insurance  industry,  which \nrequires the Insurance Commission to bear the financial costs of enforcing these \nrequirements, including resolution of noncompliant companies; \n(iii)  drafting of amendments to the SRC and Insurance Code;  \n(iv)  reorganizing  the  Insurance  Commission,  including  training  staff,  adjusting \nsalaries to be at par with SEC, upgrading information technology systems, etc. \n($10 million over the program period); and \n(v)  for the private sector, incurring substantial adjustment costs for complying with \nstricter regulatory requirements, particularly for minimum capital requirements, \nfinance disclosures, and governance for NBFIs and public issuers of securities. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Program Management \n \n90.  DOF will be the Executing Agency. SEC will be the Implementing Agency. DOF will be \nresponsible for the overall implementation of subprogram 1 including complying with all policy \nactions, program administration, disbursements, and maintenance of all program records. SEC \nwill set up a program coordination committee headed by the SEC chairperson, and comprising \nrepresentatives  from  the  BSP,  DOF,  Insurance  Commission,  PDEx,  PDIC,  and  PSE.  The \ncommittee will be responsible for implementing and sustaining the program components, in \nparticular implementing the action plan adopted for the CMDP. The committee will meet every \nquarter to coordinate and ensure effective implementation of the proposed reforms. ADB may \nbe invited to participate in the meetings as an observer. SEC will be responsible for day-to-day \nprogram implementation activities, and report implementation progress, in coordination with the \nInsurance Commission and PDIC. \n \n2.  Implementation Period  \n \n91.  Subprogram 1 will be implemented from December 2006 to June 2008. The Government \ncompleted all actions in the policy matrix by 31 October 2006.  \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement  \n \n92.  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange cost (excluding local \nduties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding \nineligible items (Appendix 5), and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In \naccordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and \nRelated  Requirements  for  Program  Loans,  the  reimbursement  procedure  will  be  used  to \n ", "26 \ndisburse  the  loan  proceeds  based  on  certification  by  the  Borrower.  No  supporting  import \ndocumentation will be required if during each year loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed \nthe value of the Philippines\u2019 total imports minus imports from nonmember countries, ineligible \nimports, and imports financed under other official development assistance is equal to or greater \nthan the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during such year. The Government will \ncertify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import \ndocumentation under existing procedures will be required. ADB reserves the right to audit the \nuse of the loan proceeds and verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. The FMRIP \nwill provide for retroactive financing for expenditures incurred by the Government 180 days prior \nto loan effectiveness. The Borrower has been informed that the approval in-principle of the \nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance this Program. \n \n4.  Anticorruption \n \n93.  The Government was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy and Policy relating to the \nCombating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism.  Consistent  with  its \ncommitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and  transparency,  ADB  will  require  the \nGovernment to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities.  The documentation between ADB and the Government will further \nallow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings.  In particular, \nall contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Program shall include provisions specifying \nthe right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Program. \n \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n94.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of \nthe  Government\u2019s  certification  for  the  withdrawal  applications.  Prior  to  withdrawal,  the \nGovernment will open an account with BSP to receive the loan proceeds. The account will be \nmanaged, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB. DOF and SEC \nwill be required to submit quarterly progress reports as well as an annual report on the progress \nof subprogram 1 implementation, in particular progress implementing the action plan adopted \nfor the CMDP. \n \n6.  Counterpart Funds \n \n95.  Counterpart funds generated by the FMRIP will be used by the Government under \narrangements satisfactory to ADB, to support the sector reform and meet the adjustment costs \nassociated  with  the  FMRIP,  as  agreed  upon  by  the  Government.  The  counterpart  funds \ngenerated from the loan proceeds will be transferred from the Treasury to DOF and SEC to \nmeet the costs and counterpart funding requirements for implementing the sector reform. \n \n7.  Monitoring and Review \n \n96.  ADB will, in cooperation with DOF and SEC, carry out periodic reviews of progress with \nFMRIP implementation, and assess the impact of the FMRIP on the sector. The Government \nwill keep ADB informed of the outcome of policy discussions with other multilateral and bilateral \nagencies  that  have  implications  for  FMRIP  implementation,  and  will  provide  ADB  with  the \nopportunity to comment on any resulting policy proposals. ADB, in collaboration with DOF and \nSEC,  will  undertake  a  review  of  program  performance  about  twelve  months  after  loan \n ", "    27 \neffectiveness to review the outcome of subprogram 1 and begin preparation of subprogram 2. In \naddition to the quarterly reports, DOF and SEC will submit within 30 days of the subprogram 1 \nreview by ADB, a report that will evaluate implementation of the policy reform measures under \nsubprogram 1, and assess the impact on the sector, describe lessons identified during the \nprogram period, and outline reforms and assistance needed for the development of the sector, \nto enable processing of subprogram 2. \n \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n97.  The objective of the TA for Strengthening Regulation and Governance is to support the \nInsurance Commission, PDIC, and SEC in preparing and implementing key policy reforms. TA \nassistance  for  the  Insurance  Commission  will  include  (i)  development  of  practices  and \nmethodologies to implement risk-based supervision and related capacity building; (ii) support for \nreorganization by preparing the human resource component including staffing, skills base, and \njob descriptions; (iii) development of a strategy to fully implement IAIS 28 core principles; \n(iv) development of analytical processes and manuals to support upgrading of information and \ncommunication  technology,  including  introduction  of  electronic  filing  and  analysis;  and  (v) \ndevelopment of a road map for insurance subsector development.  \n \n98.  The TA will assist PDIC in (i) identifying legal amendments to revise its resolution \nmethods and introducing additional instruments for more effective resolution of failed banks; (ii) \nformulating guidelines for provision of financial assistance to ailing banks; (iii) developing a \nframework for efficient disposal of assets including asset valuation, management, and disposal; \nand (iv) preparing a contingency plan for dealing with the failure of a large bank and/or a \nnumber of banks in succession.  \n \n99.  The assistance to SEC will include (i) building the capacity of SEC staff for regulating the \nsecondary trading of fixed-income securities; (ii) developing an action plan for moving to a \ndematerialized environment including preparation of rules for scripless securities; (iii) building \nthe capacity of staff to more effectively monitor compliance with IAS 39; (iv) assisting SEC in \nstandardizing books and records requirements of investment houses and other NBFIs to help \nSEC in turn standardize audit procedures; and (v) enhancing the supervisory framework to \nensure prompt public disclosure of material information by public companies and their officers, \ndirectors, and principal shareholders, with respect to beneficial ownership. \n \n100.  Additional  assistance  is  being  provided  under  ongoing  TA:  Support  for  Nonbank \nFinancial Governance II23 and Strengthening Governance of Securities Trading Markets24 for \nSEC to (i) evaluate compliance with the risk-based capital for brokerage firms, (ii) evaluate the \neffectiveness of PSE\u2019s new SRO structure in addressing conflict of interest concerns and its \ncapacity to effectively perform its surveillance and audit functions, and (iii) develop a public \nawareness  campaign  on  the  role  of  the  new  fixed-income  exchange  in  promoting  greater \ntransparency in the pricing of fixed-income securities to deepen and improve liquidity in the \nsecondary market. All these measures are expected to support SEC and other key stakeholders \nin fulfilling the policy actions under subprograms 1 and 2. \n \n101.  The TA is estimated to cost a total $1,150,000 equivalent, of which ADB will provide \n$800,000.  The  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund.

The TA details are in Appendix 7. \n \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n \n102.  Economic growth and job creation are the cornerstones of the MTPDP. The program \nsupports  the  Government\u2019s  development  agenda  and  the  development  of  a  more  efficient \nfinancial sector that encourages increased personal savings and the direction of those savings \ninto appropriate, private sector investments. The FMRIP will lead to enhanced stability in the \nfinancial system, strengthened governance in the nonbank financial subsector, and improved \nefficiency in the securities market that will all contribute to a more conducive environment for \ncontinued financial market development. The policies supported by the FMRIP are expected to \ncontribute to enhanced investor confidence, and stimulate domestic and foreign investments. \n \n103.  The FMRIP will boost competition in the financial sector and facilitate growth of financial \nintermediaries, while improving the efficiency of capital markets and improving the allocation of \nresources in the economy. Financial intermediaries will be enabled to develop a wider range of \nattractive financial products for consumers, which will improve the efficiency of intermediation by \nchanneling greater savings into the financial system. A stronger, more resilient and diversified \nfinancial sector will support higher investments and productivity growth through private sector \ndevelopment. Together with broader economic reforms in the Philippines, the reform of the \nfinancial sector will contribute to higher growth. This will indirectly contribute to poverty reduction \nthrough expected job creation, and also from the fiscal space created by enhanced revenues \nthat will allow increased social spending and public investments.  \n \nB.  Social and Environmental Safeguards \n \n104.  The FMRIP will not entail any involuntary resettlement or have a negative impact on \nindigenous people or the environment. The FMRIP is classified as category C for involuntary \nresettlement, impact on indigenous people, and environmental impact. The FMRIP is a general \nintervention aimed at supporting sustainable economic growth and in that respect is expected to \nhave an indirect positive effect on poverty reduction. Appendix 8 contains the summary poverty \nand social impact analysis and Appendix 9 the environmental impact analysis. \n \nC.  Risks  \n \n105.  Implementation of the FMRIP faces a number of key risks, for which mitigating measures \nhave been put in place, as appropriate. However subprogram 1 will face some risks. First, \npolitical instability could negatively impact the pace of reform and the macroeconomy. However, \nwhile  the  significant  political  disturbances  during  2005  had  an  impact  on  spreads  on \ninternational bonds, domestically the reforms moved ahead, albeit with a delay.  \n \n106.  Second, exogenous shocks to the economy will adversely affect growth prospects and \nthreaten macroeconomic stability. That could in turn lead to lower confidence among consumers \nand  business,  reduce  demand  for  finance,  and  increase  the  focus  on  safe  assets,  i.e.,  a \npreference for savings deposits for consumers and investments in government debt rather than \nlending for banks. Global growth prospects remain positive. A slowdown in United States growth \nappears to be offset by the recovery in Japan and stronger growth in Europe. Strong growth in \nAsia bodes well for export demand with intraregional trade rising. The FMRIP, in conjunction \nwith additional reform programs financed by ADB and the Development Policy Support Program, \n ", "    29 \nproposed with joint financing with the World Bank, contributes to sustaining the economy on an \nenhanced growth path while mitigating the risks of macroeconomic instability. The FMRIP also \nhelps to cushion the economy from its remaining exposure to adverse shocks through its \nprovision of significant financial resources on favorable terms. \n \n107.  The third risk would be delays in pursuing financial sector reforms in line with the CMDP \nand the MTPDP. The momentum in financial sector reforms should not be lost while temporary \nsetbacks may be experienced over the course of the FMRIP as the alternative of not pursuing \nreforms would have a negative effect on the investment climate, and consumer and investor \nconfidence. However, this risk is considered small as the regulatory agencies are strongly \ncommitted to reform. \n \n108.  A fourth risk is that some reforms will be undertaken without sufficient consideration of \nappropriate sequencing with the result that risks are transferred to institutions and markets \nbefore they are able to acquire adequate capacity for risk management. The FMRIP mitigates \nthis risk by providing program support and TA that strengthen the capacity of policy makers and \nregulators  to  address  these  concerns.  These  risks  are  further  mitigated  by  a  consultative \napproach that is grounded in stakeholder discussions with the private sector, government, and \nkey international partners such as the International Monetary Fund, United States Agency for \nInternational Development, World Bank, and others.  \n \n109.  Finally, serious concerns relate to inadequate standards of governance and incidence of \ncorruption in the Philippines. The Government's MTPDP views graft and corruption as threats to \nthe sustained growth and development of the country. As such the consensus is strong that \ngood governance and measures to address corruption are needed for a successful partnership \nto reduce poverty in the Philippines. In view of this, support projects are to be designed to \nenhance governance and reduce opportunities for corruption. The thrust will be to institute and \nimplement regulatory and legal reforms by promoting the independence of the regulator, and \nseparate operator and regulator functions. Moreover, institutional reforms will aim to ensure \ntransparency and accountability; and to mitigate, if not eradicate, administrative impropriety of \nrespective  government  agencies.  This  will  be  reinforced  by  strengthening  consolidated \nsupervision  mechanisms  via  closer  cooperation  and  coordination  among  financial  services \nregulatory agencies. For instance, the Financial Sector Forum (para. 18) provides a platform for \nexchanging information and ideas, and coordinating regulatory and supervisory activities of the \nfour member agencies. BSP has been able to keep pace with innovations in regulation and has \nbeen diligent in its implementation of international best practices in regulation. SEC is a much \nstronger organization, having undertaken various reforms since 1998 under the SRC. SEC is \nprimarily responsible for implementing the CMDP. Successful implementation of the CMDP with \nthe support of the FMRIP should strengthen the capacity and authority of SEC in regulating and \nensuring good governance in the securities market. The amendment of the Insurance Code and \nthe reorganization of the Insurance Commission will lead to an improved legal and regulatory \nframework for the insurance industry and enhance governance and supervision in the insurance \nsubsector.  \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n110.  In addition to the continued compliance and implementation of the actions specified in \nthe FMRIP policy matrix and standard assurances, the Government has given the following \nspecific assurances, which will be incorporated in the loan agreement: \n \n ", "30 \n \n(i)  Policy matrix.

(b) The Government will keep ADB informed of policy discussions \nwith  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies  that  have  implications  for \nimplementation of subprogram 1 and will provide ADB with an opportunity to \ncomment on any resulting policy proposals. The Government will take ADB\u2019s \nviews into consideration before finalizing and implementing any such proposals. \n(iv)  Counterpart funds. The Government will ensure that the counterpart funds will \nbe used to support financial sector reforms and to meet the financing costs \nassociated with the FMRIP.  \n(v)   Subprogram 1 review and evaluation. The following are required: \n \n(a)  Information. DOF and SEC will provide ADB with all relevant data and \ninformation in such detail as ADB may reasonably request to facilitate \nreview by ADB of the progress in the implementation of subprogram 1. \n(b)  Reports. DOF and SEC will prepare quarterly progress reports as well as \nan annual report on subprogram 1 implementation for submission to ADB.  \n(c)  Subprogram 1 review. DOF will ensure that a review is undertaken for \nsubprogram  1  to  design  the  proposed  subprogram  2  of  the  program \ncluster  based  on  implementation  studies  undertaken  and  experience \ngained under subprogram 1 and to reflect changes that may occur in the \nexternal  environment  during  the  subprogram  1  period.  Subprogram  1 \nreview  will  be  undertaken  twelve  months  after  the  effective  date  of \nsubprogram  1  to  identify  lessons  and  to  formulate  the  outline  for \nsubprogram 2 under the program cluster. \n(d)  Subprogram  1  review  report. A subprogram 1 review report will be \nsubmitted to ADB that (i) assesses compliance with the policy actions \nunder  subprogram  1,  (ii)  assesses  progress  with  implementation  of \ncomplementary  activities  under  the  overall  reform  program,  and  (iii) \ndefines requirements for adjustments to activities to be undertaken under \nthe proposed subprogram 2 under the program cluster. \n \n \n \n \n ", "    31 \nB.  Condition for Program Loan Effectiveness \n \n111.  The Government will have established the program coordinating committee, which will \nbe chaired by the chairperson of SEC and consists of representatives from the BSP, DOF, \nInsurance Commission, PDEx, PDIC, and PSE. \n \nIX.

Philippine Financial Structure and Regional Comparison.1 The deepening of the \nfinancial sector in the Philippines is marginal compared with other countries in the region. The \nmarket capitalization of Asian equity, on average, has trebled since 1997 and the capitalization \nas a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) in Southeast Asian economies such as Hong \nKong, China; Singapore; or Malaysia compares favorably to countries such as the United States, \nUnited Kingdom, or Germany. However, the same does not apply to the Philippines, People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, and Indonesia (Table A2.1). The financial system in terms of composition \nand growth has not progressed in comparison to the regional average. In 2005 in the Philippines, \nbanking assets as a percentage of GDP were 63.2, equity market capitalization 40.4, and bonds \noutstanding 36.7, much lower when compared with Malaysia; Republic of Korea; Hong Kong, \nChina; and Singapore. Again, corporate bonds comprised a very small percentage of the overall \nbonds outstanding in these economies, including the Philippines. \n \nTable A2.1: Structure of the Financial System in Southeast Asia \n(% of gross domestic product) \n  Banks Assets  Equity Market  Bonds Outstanding \nCapitalization \nEconomy  1997  2004  2005  1997  2004  2005  1997  2004  2005 \nPRC  124.6  176.4  163.1  11.2  23.1  17.8  12.9  24.9  24.4 \nHong Kong,  205.1  337.5  444.6  234.5  519.5  593.6  26.0  46.3  46.6 \nChina                   \nIndonesia  31.1  14.6  49.8  12.2  28.8  28.9  1.9  22.6  19.6 \nRepublic  of  37.9  130.1  93.5  8.1  57.1  91.2  25.2  83.3  76.2 \nKorea                   \nMalaysia  100.9  169.0  159.4  93.2  153.3  138.0  57.0  90.0  88.0 \nPhilippines  56.1  66.5  63.2  37.7  33.0  40.4  22.4  28.4  36.7 \nSingapore  122.0  176.8  185.4  110.8  202.3  220.4  24.7  73.1  68.2 \nThailand  79.7  129.2  103.6  15.1  71.4  70.1  7.1  41.1  40.8 \n   \nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \nSources: International Monetary Fund International Financial Statistics, Bank for International Settlements, Asian \nDevelopment Bank, Asian Bonds Online, and Ghosh, Swati R. 2006.

The Philippines ranks lowest in the region (other than the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic and Cambodia) in terms of investment as a share of GDP (%). Philippines investment \nto GDP ratio of 17% as of 2004 is lower compared with other economies in the region. \n  \n3.  Composition of the Financial System and Bank Dominance. The various institutions \nthat constitute the Philippine financial system can be broadly classified as banks and nonbank \nfinancial institutions (NBFIs). The banking subsector can be further divided into universal banks \n(expanded commercial banks), commercial banks, rural banks, and thrift banks, which include \nsavings and mortgage banks, stock savings and loans associations, and private development \nbanks. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) is the central bank. NBFIs include insurance \ncompanies, financing companies, investment houses, securities brokers and dealers, lending \ninvestors, fund managers, pension funds, and non-stock-savings and loan associations. Taken \nas a whole, the relative importance of the financial system barely changed over the past two \ndecades. In 1980, the ratio of the financial system\u2019s total assets to gross national product was \n101.6% and is hardy different in 2005. Historically, nonbanks accounted for 18% of the financial \n                                                 \n1  Ghosh, Swati R. 2006. East Asian Finance: The Road to Robust Markets. Washington, DC: World Bank. \n ", "  Appendix 2  37 \nsystem\u2019s assets in 1997; at the end of 2005 this had changed little. This indicates that banking \ncontinues to dominate the financial system (Table A2.2). \n \nTable A2.2: Total Resources of the Financial System\u2014Philippines  \n(P billion, 2003\u20132006) \n    Total  Commercial  Thrift  Rural     % of Banks\nYear  Total  Banks  Banks  Banks  Banks   Nonbanksa  of Total \n                  \n2003  4,672.1  3,810.8  3,425.6  292.8  92.4  861.3  81.5 \n2004  5,142.5  4,183.0  3,760.6  317.9  104.5  959.5  81.3 \n2005  5,478.7  4,456.5  3,986.0  350.2  120.3  1,022.2  81.3 \na  Includes investment houses, finance companies, investment companies, securities dealers/brokers, pawnshops, \nlending investors, Non-Stock Savings & Loan Assn., Mutual Building and Loan Assn., Venture Capital Corp. and \nothers; and private and Government insurance companies including Social Security System and Government \nService Insurance System.

The banking system comprises a small number of large \nbanks and a large number of thrift and rural banks. Recently the Philippines consolidated the \nbanking system, reducing the number of commercial banks from 51 in 1997 to 24 in 2005. The \nmajority of the banking system is privately owned with foreign ownership limited to about 9% in \nthe top 10 banks. The percentage of nonperforming loans has been gradually declining from \nabout 16.7% in 2002 to about 7.36% at end of May 2006. The creation of the special purpose \nvehicle framework resulted in the resolution of nonperforming loans and as a result in April 2006 \nthe  special  purpose  vehicle  law  was  extended  for  2  more  years  to  support  continued \nstrengthening of the banks\u2019 balance sheets. \n \n5.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the Regulator. The rehabilitation and creation of a strong \nand independent central monetary authority (BSP) charged with supervising financial institutions \nis the most important landmark in the Philippine financial sector during the last decade. The type \nof supervision has moved from transaction-based to process, based on a risk management \nsystems approach. BSP is considered to be independent from the central Government and its \nincome-generating activities reinforce this perception. Since BSP is able to earn its own income, \nit is not very dependent on the Government for its funding, unlike the Securities and Exchange \nCommission (SEC). Furthermore, the compensation or pay scales of BSP employees are much \nmore relative to regular government employees, thereby allowing them to hire highly qualified \nstaff  for  its  operations.  BSP  is  also  able  to  allocate  more  resources  for  training,  thereby \nenhancing its regulatory capabilities. BSP has kept pace with innovations in regulation and been \ndiligent in its implementation of international best practices in regulation. \n \n6.  Overreliance  on  the  banking  industry  clearly  demonstrates  the  need  for  alternative \nchannels of financial intermediation through the capital market to deepen the financial sector \nand diversify risks in the system. \n \n7.  Capital Markets Regulator, Securities and Exchange Commission. SEC, established \nin 1936, regulates the capital market, licenses and supervises self-regulatory organizations, and \nis  responsible  for  company  registration  and  the  conduct  of  market  participants.  SEC  is \nresponsible to the secretary of finance and funded under the Department of Finance budget. Its \nrole in company registration brings in significant revenue, of which SEC is allowed to retain a \nsmall proportion. SEC draws its authority from the Securities Registration Code (SRC) (July \n2000). The code focuses on four core functions: (i) capital market development and regulation, \n ", "38  Appendix 2 \n(ii) company registration and monitoring, (iii) enforcement, and (iv) support services. SEC is led \nby a chairperson and four other commissioners and has 350 staff. SEC is a much stronger \norganization than it was in 1998 due to the reforms carried out under the SRC. Though SEC is \nnow more committed to regulating the capital markets, lack of funds and authority restricts its \nscope in providing leadership to the market. The imbalance between BSP and SEC in the \nregulatory structure reflects the relative underfunding of SEC when compared with BSP.  \n \n8.  The Second Nonbank Financial Governance Program supported the development of \ntraining  programs,  development  and  utilization  of  information  technology,  and  review  and \nrevision of inspection procedures to enhance the SEC\u2019s supervisory and surveillance capability. \nSEC issued regulations for the adoption of international accounting standards by all companies \nregistered  with  SEC  and  also  began  accrediting  auditors  and  imposing  new  reporting \nrequirements on auditors. SEC issued and, since December 2005, has been implementing risk-\nbased  capital  adequacy  standards  for  brokerage  firms.  SEC  is  primarily  responsible  for \nimplementing the Capital Market Development Plan; successful implementation with the support \nof  the  Financial  Market  Intermediation  and  Regulation  Program  (FMRIP)  should  facilitate \ndevelopment of the nonbank financial sector and enhance SEC\u2019s capacity and authority in \nregulating and developing the securities market. \n \nA.  Market Infrastructure  \n \n1.  Philippine Stock Exchange  \n \n9.  The Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) is the country\u2019s only licensed exchange (licensed \nby SEC). PSE is a much improved organization from what it was in 1998. It demonstrates \ngreater commitment to its regulatory responsibilities although the transfer of ownership from the \nmembership as prescribed in the SRC is still pending. PSE became a demutualized public \ncompany in 2001, separating ownership and trading rights. Previous broker members retained \ntheir trading rights even if they sold their shares. The SRC mandates the demutualization and \nlimits brokers\u2019 shareholdings to 20%. That has yet to be reached. Thus the brokers still exercise \nmuch influence in PSE decision making. PSE operates a conventional public electronic order \nbook. The country has one national depository for equities, the Philippines Central Depository; \none clearing agent system run by PSE, the Securities Clearing Corporation of the Philippines; \nand two settlement banks that share the cash transmission associated with trading. PSE has \ntwo trading floors for historical reasons although trading is conducted electronically, with direct \ninput of orders from the floor permitted. Trading hours are 09.30 to 12:00 with a 10-minute \nextension. Trading is almost exclusively in equities.  \n \n10.  Three boards list 237 companies. The first board is for companies with a minimum \ncapital of P400 million, have been in operation for 3 full fiscal years immediately prior to listing, \nwith a cumulative pretax profit of at least P50 million and a minimum pretax profit of P10 million \nfor each of the 3 years. A minimum of 1,000 stockholders is required. The second board \ncomprises companies with minimum authorized capital of P100 million. No track record is \nrequired,  but  applicants  must  demonstrate  superior  growth  and  have  a  minimum  of  500 \nstockholders. The third board, the Small and Medium Enterprises Board is for companies with \ncapitalization  of  between  P20  million  and  P100  million,  a  1-year  track  record,  and  50 \nstockholders at the time of listing. A minimum public float rule of 10%\u201330% was suspended until \nthe end of 2005. A board for trading of retail bonds was closed after 3 years due to thin trading.  \n \n11.  PSE trading was lackluster in the years following the Asian crisis but picked up in 2004 \nand 2005. The index grew by 26.4% in 2004 and 39.1% in 2005. Market capitalization remains \nlow by international and regional comparison at 41% of GDP equivalent. PSE has 123 member-\n ", "  Appendix 2  39 \nbrokers; 9 are foreign. The foreign brokers account for 50% of trading volumes. As of the end of \n2004, about 42% of the stock market was not accessible to foreign investors. In addition, 40% of \nthe shares are closely held leaving a very small float freely available to would-be investors and \nthereby affecting the liquidity and efficiency of the stock market. Low liquidity and efficiency in \nthe  securities  markets  is  again  demonstrated  by  the  low  institutional  investor  base  in  the \nPhilippines, People\u2019s Republic of China, and Indonesia, among the lowest in the region. Among \nthe  developing  markets  in  the  region,  PSE  shows  the  least  success  in  growing  its  listed \ncompanies\u2014its  stock  of  tradable  assets.  PSE  has  initiated  moves  to  strengthen  investor \nprotection and confidence through considerable strides to improve its governance structure. It \nhas had less success in broadening PSE ownership. The absence of public information on \nordinary shares makes comment on the relative importance of different classes of investors \ndifficult (Table A2.3). \n \n12.  Few Philippine companies and no locally owned finance company have any significant \noperations outside the country. The strategic thrust of most companies is to gain a dominant \nshare in their local market. A limited number of foreign entities have established joint ventures; \nmore have invested in portfolio investments. \n \nTable A2.3: Market Highlights, 2000\u20132005 \n \nItem  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005 \nMarket Capitalization (P billion)a  2,577.7  2,141.4  2,083.2  2,946.7  4,741.3  5,908 \nTrading Value (P billion)  357.7  159.6  159.7  145.3  206.5  383.5 \nTrading Volume (billion shares)  659.4  164.4  99.8  86.0  286.3  317.6 \nIndices (year-end closing)             \n       Composite  1,494.5  1,168.1  1018.4  1,442.4  2,066  2,096 \nCapital Raised (P billion)  37.2  7.3  40.1  1.7  2.5  51.7 \n        Initial Public Offering   0.6  0.2  3.6  0.2  1.1  29.8 \n        Additional Listings  36.6  7.1  36.5  1.5  1.4  21.9 \nEquities             \n       Listed Companies  230  231  234  236  235  237 \n           Domestic  228  229  232  234  232  235 \n           Foreign  2  2  2  2  2  2 \n       Listed Issues  309  311  310  311  311  310 \n          Domestic  307  308  308  309  309  308 \n          Foreign  2  2  2  2  2  2 \nDebt             \n       Government Securities  0  1  1       \nExchange Rate (P /$)             \n       Average  44.2  51.0  51.6  54.2  56.4  55.1 \n       End-of-Period  50.0  51.4  53.1  55.6  56.2  53.6 \na Includes foreign companies listed on the Philippine Stock Exchange. \nSource: Philippine Stock Exchange. \n \n13.  The  assets  of  institutional  investors  such  as  pension,  insurance,  and  mutual  funds \ncollectively are the lowest for Philippines, at about $12 billion (14% of the country\u2019s GDP), \ncompared with other economies in the region (Table A2.4). Improving the investor base is \ncritical for developing the securities markets, more so, for financing large infrastructure projects.  \n \n14.  Liquidity measured in terms of turnover ratio is the lowest in the Philippines at 14.3 \ncompared with other regional economies. The ratio of value traded to GDP at 4.2 is again an \nindication of low liquidity in the Philippines equity market.

The Bankers Association of the Philippines launched an initiative to set up a fixed-\nincome exchange for trading of debt securities to provide an efficient market place for price \ndiscovery and electronic trading. The Philippine Dealing System owns three corporations: (i) \nPhilippine Dealing and Exchange Corporation (PDEx), a trading system for debt securities: (ii) \nPhilippine Securities Settlement Corporation for clearing and settlement of trades completed at \nPDEx; and (iii) Philippine Depository and Trust Corporation, the repository for securities on \nbehalf of public investors. PDEx will (i) facilitate migration from over-the-counter trading to \nelectronic  trading  to  achieve  transparency  and  efficient  price  discovery,  (ii)  ensure  proper \ndelivery of securities to the buyer or the buyer\u2019s custodian, and (iii) help institutionalize the \nsystem with third party custodians. PDEx began operations in March 2005; total trading in 2005 \nwas P437.85 billion, with a daily average turnover of P2.19 billion.  \n \nB.  Financial Intermediaries \n \n1.  Investment Houses \n \n16.  The 33 investment houses (investment banks in the Philippines including 6 with quasi-\nbanking licenses) are governed by the Investment Houses Law (from 1973 and revised rules \nfrom 2002). They underwrite securities, provide fee-based services, and act as intermediaries in \nthe short end of the money market. Investment houses with a quasi-banking license can also \nprovide medium- and long-term loans to corporations. BSP no longer issues license for quasi-\nbanking and, to consolidate the industry, SEC has suspended licenses for investment houses \nwithout quasi-banking licenses. Many investment houses are owned by universal banks. The \ninvestment houses without quasi-banking licenses must have a minimum paid-in capital of P300 \nmillion. They cannot undertake underwriting commitments for amounts exceeding 20 times their \nnet worth, or charge underwriting fees exceeding 5% of the funds they generate for an issue.   \n \n2.  Investment Companies  \n \n17.  Investment  companies  or  mutual  funds  were  introduced  in  1957;  the  Investment \nCompany Act to govern them followed in 1960. Early development of mutual funds was patchy \nwith few investment opportunities. The initial lack of regulation also contributed to scandals and \ndisappointed investors. No new funds were registered with SEC between 1972 and 1990; \n ", "42  Appendix 2 \ninstead investors chose to invest in pre-need products and common trust funds operated by \nbanks. The number of mutual funds has increased by more than 50% since 2003; the net asset \nvalue of mutual funds has almost doubled along with mutual fund sales and number of mutual \nfund accounts. However, the size of this subsector is still small compared with the size of \ncommon trust funds (a comparable bank product in the Philippines) or with other regional \nmutual fund markets.2 A closed-end fund offers a fixed number of shares whereas open-end \nfunds continually offer new shares to the investing public. The minimum required capital is P50 \nmillion.  Three  companies  dominate.  The  total  assets  of  the  industry  at  the  end  of  2004 \namounted to P29.4 billion. Investment companies are not very active on the stock exchange, \naccounting for less than 2% of money invested in PSE.  \n \n18.  The  investing  public  lacks  information  about  mutual  funds,  what  they  are,  and  the \nbenefits and risks of investing in funds. SEC has noted this general need for investor education.  \n \n19.  SEC has been drafting revisions to the Investment Company Act since the mid-1990s It \nadvocates revisions that will (i) call for better disclosure rules, (ii) require registration with SEC \nfor  all  collective  investment  schemes,  (iii)  make  licensing  of  investment  advisers  by  SEC \nmandatory, (iv) clarify separation of funds between the corporation and invested funds, (v) \nrequire independent directors on the board, and (vi) allow foreigners to become board members. \nSEC  plans  to  introduce  risk-based  capital  provisions  in  implementing  regulation.  These \namendments would meet the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) \nprinciples 16\u201320 for collective investment schemes.    \n \n3.  Pre-Need Companies  \n \n20.  Pre-need policies are essentially savings schemes to provide for major life-time events, \ne.g.,  weddings  and  education.  They  are  split  for  regulatory  purposes  into  three  groups: \neducation,  life,  and  pension.  Pre-need  companies  have  tended  to  offer  unachievable \nguaranteed returns and been forced to unilaterally alter the terms of payments. Essentially they \nbecame actuarially insolvent and were forced to reduce their commitments. The pre-need firms\u2019 \ntrust fund investments reached P66.37 billion as of 30 June 2004 (the latest available data). \nDespite the industry\u2019s rapid growth and recent financial difficulty, no law specifically governs \npre-need  companies.  Recently,  the  basic  sales  practices  and  governance  of  the  pre-need \nindustry have been questioned.  \n \n21.  Currently, SEC licenses and regulates pre-need companies, but SEC\u2019s performance in \nregulating the funds and enforcing these regulations has been lacking. SEC is responsible for \ndefining the investor protection scheme as well as interpreting this scheme. Under the SRC, \nSEC officials and staff, when challenged for taking specific actions in their official capacity, are \nrequired  to  demonstrate  that  they  acted  with  \u201cextraordinary  diligence\u201d  to  avoid  liability  for \nenforcing  substantive  requirements  that  they  might  have  been  responsible  for  developing. \nResponsible staff and officials are therefore reluctant to take enforcement actions that may \ninvite a legal challenge. Instead, SEC appears to use its power to deny renewal of annual \nregistration to dealers selling pre-need plans of pre-need companies experiencing financial \ndifficulties (such as trust fund deficiencies and related impairment of capital). As a result, the \nnumber of pre-need plan companies with licenses to sell pre-need plans has declined from 43 in \n2003 to 29 in 2006. A comprehensive overhaul of the regulatory framework is needed to \n                                                 \n2  Thirty-two mutual funds, compared with an estimated 60 common trust funds, operate in the Philippines; 154 \ninvestment funds operate in the People\u2019s Republic of China, 247 in Indonesia, 281 in Malaysia, and 523 in \nThailand. \n ", "  Appendix 2  43 \naddress current liquidity problems experienced by several large pre-need plan companies. A bill \nto establish a pre-need code has been before Congress for the last 5 years. It also proposes the \ntransfer of regulatory authority from SEC to the Insurance Commission.  \n \n22.  More sustainable reforms for both the pre-need and mutual fund sectors are dependent \non the enactment of a comprehensive regulatory framework, including legislation. Although \nrelevant bills were submitted by the executive branch to Congress, technical working groups \nhave been organized to discuss the bills, and public hearings on the bills have taken place, it \nappears  that  neither  adoption  of a  new  pre-need  code  nor  amendment  of  the  Investment \nCompany Act is a Congressional priority. \n \n  4.  Financing Companies \n \n23.  Financing  companies  are  governed  by  the  Financing  Company  Act  of  1978.  They \nengage in leasing and consumer finance, but derive about 25% of their income from securities \ntrading. Total assets of the 319 financing companies registered with the SEC amounted to \nP55.6 billion at the end of 2004.  \n \nC.  Insurance  \n \n24.  The  Insurance  Commission,  the  Regulator.  The  Insurance  Commission,  a \ngovernment agency under the Department of Finance, supervises and regulates the operations \nof life and nonlife companies, mutual benefit associations, and trusts for charitable uses. It \nissues licenses to insurance agents, general agents, resident agents, underwriters, brokers, \nadjusters,  and  actuaries;  and  has  the  authority  to  suspend  or  revoke  such  licenses.  The \ncommission currently has 216 staff. The regulatory and supervisory capacity of the Insurance \nCommission needs to be strengthened, and the Insurance Code amended to improve the legal \nand  regulatory  framework  for  the  insurance industry.  To  achieve  effective  supervision,  the \nInsurance Commission needs to be reorganized.  \n \n25.  Insurance Companies. The country has 32 life insurance companies and 104 nonlife \ninsurance companies. The low capital requirement of P50 million may explain the large number \nof companies as the penetration rate is low with an estimated less than 17% of the population \nhaving insurance policies. Despite the large number of companies, the life insurance premium \ncollected  was  only  1.27%\u20131.30%  of  GDP  during  2002\u20132004.  Insurance  penetration  as  a \npercentage of GDP in the Philippines is among the lowest in the region (Table A2.6). Similarly, \nthe density ratio, measured as the premium per capita is equally low with good potential for \ngrowth that would depend on the quality of products and services offered and distribution \nchannels. The sector was liberalized in 1994 allowing foreign firms to own 100% equity stakes \nin insurers and to enter the market by either a local joint venture or setting up a local subsidiary \nor branch. Three foreign companies are active: Philippine American Life and General Insurance \n(local subsidiary of American International Group), SunLife (Canada), and Manulife (Canada). \nPhilippine American Life dominates the market with 28% share followed by SunLife with 17%. \nThe five largest life insurance companies have a market share in terms of assets of about 83%. \nThe three foreign companies accounted for 50% of total premium income in 2004. The life \ninsurance companies are major investors in equities, government securities, corporate debt, \nand real estate. The nonlife insurance companies are mostly small family-owned companies; \ngrowth in premiums has been low. The country has two domestic reinsurance companies.  \n ", "44  Appendix 2 \nTable A2.6: Indicators of Development of the Insurance Sector \n \n \n  1997  2000  2004 \nEconomy  Penetration  Density Penetration Density  Penetration  Density\nPeople\u2019s Rep. of China           \nLife  0.8  6.1  1.1 9.5  2.2  27.3 \nNonlife  0.6  4.7  0.7 5.7  1.1  12.9 \nTotal  1.4 10.8 1.8 15.2 3.3  40.2\nHong Kong, China           \nLife  2.4  646.3  3.7 892.9  7.9  1,884.3 \nNonlife  1.1  299.2  1.1 269.1  1.4     332.9 \n   Total  3.5 945.5 4.8 1,162.0 9.3  2,217.2\nIndonesia           \nLife  0.6  6.2  0.5 4.0  0.6  7.5 \nNonlife  0.7  6.9  0.6 4.6  0.7   8.1 \nTotal  1.3 13.1 1.2 8.6 1.3  15.6\nRepublic of Korea,            \nLife           \nNonlife  11.6  929.3  9.9 935.6  6.8  1,006.8 \nTotal  3.8  303.0  3.2 298.5  2.8     412.5 \n15.4 1,232.3 13.1 1,234.1 9.6  1,419.3\nMalaysia           \nLife  2.2  99.0  2.1 86.4  3.5  167.3 \nNonlife  2.2  99.8  1.6 64.6  1.9    89.3 \nTotal  4.4 198.8 3.7 151.0 5.4  256.6\nPhilippines   \nLife  0.7 8.0 0.8 7.5 0.9   9.4\nNonlife  0.8 9.1 0.6 6.0 0.6   6.1\nTotal  1.5 17.1 1.4 13.5 1.5  15.5\nSingapore           \nLife  3.8  989.0  3.2 732.1  6.0  1,483.9 \nNonlife  1.3  338.3  1.0 234.2  1.5     365.5 \n   Total  5.1 1,327.3 4.2 966.3 7.5  1,849.4\nThailand           \nLife  1.2  26.2  1.5 29.8  1.9  50.8 \nNonlife  1.2  26.3  1.0 19.4  1.6  41.4 \nTotal  2.4 52.5 2.5 49.3 3.5  92.2\nSource: Ghosh, Swati R. 2006.

The  Philippine  Deposit  Insurance \nCorporation (PDIC) was established in 1963 by Republic Act 3591, amended in 2004. The new \nlaw has enhanced the authority of PDIC in its role of deposit insurer and strengthens the \nmechanisms  to  maintain  systemic  stability  in  the  financial  system.  PDIC  has  three  core \nfunctions: (i) insurer of bank deposits, (ii) receiver/liquidator of closed banks, and (iii) coregulator \nof banks in collaboration with BSP. Current deposit insurance coverage is P250,000. The \nproportion of deposit covered by the insurance is about 25% of total deposits in terms of value \nbut 95% of total accounts (Table A2.7). This probably is a consequence of the low savings rate \nin the country. PDIC oversees the Deposit Insurance Fund, which consists of the Permanent \nInsurance Fund, assessment collections, reserves for insurance and financial assistance losses, \n ", "  Appendix 2  45 \nand retained earnings. The Deposit Insurance Fund stands at P47.2 billion compared with an \nestimated required P90 billion given the risks in the system.  \n \n27.  The Monetary Board can close a bank and place it in receivership in cases of (i) inability \nto  meet  depositor  demands,  (ii)  insolvency,  (iii)  violation  of  cease-and-desist  order,  or \n(iv) continued operations that are likely to lead to losses for depositors and creditors. PDIC then \nbecomes the receiver and must within 60 days recommend to the Monetary Board whether to \nrehabilitate or liquidate a failed bank. Rehabilitation is done if new investors are available and if \nit represents a least-cost solution compared with closure and liquidation. Financial assistance \ntakes the form of asset purchases, direct loans, or assumption of liabilities. Such assistance \nmust meet a least-cost test. \n \nTable A2.7: Insured Deposits and Payment Ratios, 1999\u20132005 \n \nYear  Closed Banks   Insured Deposits  Insured Paid  Deposit Ratio  \n(number)  (P million)  (P million) \n1999  33  3,485.52  3,314.39  95.09 \n2000  24  3,360.50  3,119.78  92.84 \n2001  18     750.14     664.92  88.64 \n2002  13     744.96     682.18  91.57 \n2003  10     383.03     353.78  92.36 \n2004  4     206.97     188.67  91.16 \n2005  7     532.22     463.16  87.02 \nTotal  109  9,463.64  8,786.88  92.85 \nSource: Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Llanto, Gilberto. 2005.

The closed banks had cumulative deposit liabilities of P5,657 \nmillion that was met by PDIC.3 One of the impediments that inhibit PDIC from more effectively \nmonitoring banks and receive timely information is the country\u2019s law of secrecy of deposits The \nincrease in maximum insurance cover has not been matched with a corresponding increase in \nthe assessment rate. This may impact PDIC\u2019s capability to meet insurance claims in the future. \nPDIC needs to revise its resolution methods and identify additional instruments and options to \naddress bank failures, asset disposal techniques, and strengthen the framework for selecting \nstrategic investors. This will be supported through the FMRIP. \n \n29.  Unlike the banking industry, the securities and insurance industries have not seen major \nrevisions in their regulatory structure for some time despite many changes in the competitive \nenvironment and products being offered. Enactment of the SRC, somewhat earlier in 2000, \nmandated  a  comprehensive  revision  of  the  Philippine  securities  laws  to  ensure  a  modern \nframework for the securities industry. However, important legislation such as that proposed to \nreintroduce a pre-need plan code, corporate recovery act, and the revised Investment Company \nAct, which are still pending before Congress, needs to be taken up in earnest to reduce \nunevenness  in  the  regulatory  framework  between  the  bank  and  nonbank  subsectors.  The \nCapital Market Development Plan implemented with FMRIP support will aim to address most of \nthese issues. \n                                                 \n3  Leung, E.

Given the critical role of the \nfinancial sector in the growth process, the development agenda of the Government of the \nPhilippines prioritizes the need to strengthen the investment climate by promoting development \nof a more efficient financial sector that can finance profitable private investment projects at \nlower cost and risk than at present.  \n \nTo support the implementation of these policy goals, the Government is focusing on \nstrengthening  macroeconomic  management.  While  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal  consolidation \nprogram includes a wide range of initiatives, the centerpiece comprises broadening the tax base, \nadjusting  tax  rates,  and  strengthening  tax  administration.  Progress  on  aggregate  fiscal \nconsolidation was characterized as \u201cimpressive\u201d by development partners during the Philippine \nDevelopment Forum (PDF) in March 2006, which also assessed the program to be broadly on \ntrack. The Government is committed to reduce the National Government deficit/GDP to 0.9% by \n2007. The emerging trend is better than projected in the Government\u2019s Medium Term Philippine \nDevelopment Plan 2004-2010 (MTPDP), and the target for achieving a balanced budget has \nbeen advanced from 2010 to 2008. The International Monetary Fund in its mid Post-Program \nMonitoring on the Philippines, recognized significant gains from the package of reforms pursued \nby the Government over the last two years.  \n \nThe MTPDP emphasizes economic growth and job creation as key to poverty reduction, \nand builds on the Government\u2019s ten point agenda. Real GDP growth rate targets are 5.3-6.3% \nin  2005  and  expected  to  increase  to  7-8%  by  2010.  Sound  debt  and  risk  management \ncomplemented by increasing exports and higher investments are expected to drive growth. \nWhile the MTPDP encompasses policies and actions in several sectors it notes the importance \nof developing the financial system to mobilize domestic savings to support growth. Further \nreforms,  in  particular  in  the  non-bank  financial  sector,  are  needed  to  achieve  effective \nintermediation. Policy measures need to be undertaken to promote diversification of financial \nchannels, enhance financial governance and market efficiency and reduce systemic risks that \nwill contribute to increased investment confidence and a stronger investment climate. The \nMTPDP points out the need to undertake reforms for financial deepening and outlines the key \nreforms to be undertaken from 2004-2010. Anchored on the MTPDP is the Government\u2019s \nCapital  Market  Development  Plan  -  a  blueprint  developed  for  growth  and  expanded \ncontributions to the Philippine Economy, 2005-2010 (CMDP). The Government appreciates the \nsupport provided by ADB in developing the CMDP under the Second Nonbank Finance and \nGovernance Program 2003. \n \nThe CMDP is a medium term strategy for development of the non-bank financial sector \nand articulates a series of eleven strategic objectives that are intended to stimulate the growth, \n ", "  Appendix 4  49 \n \nefficiency and competitiveness of the Philippine capital market over the next five years. The \nCMDP has been endorsed by the Government and the Securities Exchange Commission has \nthe primary responsibility in implementing the CMDP. We expect that the structure that emerges \nfrom the CMDP will not only be a model for others, but one that generates a positive momentum \nextending  well  beyond  2010.  The  strategic  objectives  identified  in  the  CMDP  represent  a \ncombination of economic, business, and legal/regulatory factors that will materially influence the \nPhilippine  capital  market\u2019s  vitality  as  an  engine  of  economic  growth  for  the  country.  The \nGovernment  acknowledges  that  the  successful  implementation  of  the  CMDP\u2019s  objectives \nrequires a strong working relationship between the responsible parties in the public and private \nsectors. An Action Plan along with indicative timetable has been prepared and the SEC has \nestablished an internal monitoring unit to track and publicly disclose progress on a regular basis \nwhile the DOF will oversee the interests of the national Government in the project.  \n \nThe Government is committed to strengthen the nonbank financial institutions as it is a \nkey element of our effort to provide viable financing for infrastructure development. While the \nCMDP primarily focuses on SEC regulated institutions, the current and potential future role of \nthe contractual savings vehicles (pension funds, insurance companies) in terms of mobilizing \npersonal savings and channeling a portion of these funds towards capital formation to grow \nprivate  sector  enterprises  is  recognized.  The  increasing  sophistication  of  financial  markets \ncarries high inherent risks that must be adequately addressed through strong regulatory and \nsupervisory regimes as well as adequate risk management systems and tools. Steps have been \ninitiated to strengthen the legal and regulatory framework for the insurance industry. Further \nefforts are required to strengthen the capital base of the insurance industry and to inculcate the \nhabit of savings among the local population.  \n \nThe  Government  looks  forward  to  ADB  support  in  its  medium  term  policy  and \ndevelopment agenda as articulated in the CMDP. The ADB has supported the Government\u2019s \nefforts to develop the financial sector since 1995. Financial sector reforms build on a strong \nlegal and regulatory framework to support agencies in their work to supervise the market as well \nas to provide a predictable environment for financial institutions and enterprises to operate in. \nMajor achievements include, among others, the enactment of the Securities Regulation Code in \n2000 (supported under the ADB Capital Market Development Program), the Special Purpose \nVehicle Act of 2002, and the revised charter of the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation in \n2004. Furthermore, the stock exchange has been demutualized and a fixed-income exchange \nhas been established.  \n \nHowever, strengthening of the financial sector is a continuous process and further work \nis needed in the non-bank financial sector to strengthen the regulatory framework and the \ncapacity of the regulators-the SEC and the Insurance Commission (IC). In addition, further \nreforms are needed to deepen the financial sector, facilitate savings mobilization and financial \nintermediation through reforms of the debt and equity markets. The Government has thus \ndeveloped the Financial Market Intermediation and Regulation Program (FMRIP) which will help \nthe Philippines to implement the medium term reform agenda 2005-2010. This Program will be \nimplemented  with  the  assistance  of  ADB  through  a  cluster  program  comprising  of  two \nsubprograms over the medium-term. This momentum is needed to develop the financial sector \nin order to benefit from integration in the regional and global capital markets over the medium \nand long-term. The reform agenda under Subprogram 2 in the cluster will build on continued \nreforms to enhance financial system stability and further financial sector reforms in line with the \nCMDP and development in other nonbank sectors. \n \n ", "50  Appendix 4 \n  To implement the reform program, the FMRIP has been structured around the following \ncomponents: \n  (i)  Enhance  financial  stability.  This  will  include  measures  to  reduce  financial \nsector vulnerabilities and reduce systemic risks that are central to promoting financial sector \ndevelopment. This will be achieved though creation of a stable financial environment conducive \nto economic growth through improved debt and risk management. Steps have been initiated to \nbring down the share of variable interest rates bonds, altering the currency composition of \ninternational debt, and consolidating the number of outstanding issues. The aim will be to \ndevelop an enhanced debt management strategy consistent with international best practice. To \nstrengthen financial intermediation and reduce the ratio of non-performing assets in the banking \nindustry, the Special Purpose Act has been extended facilitating the disposition of the banking \nsystem\u2019s non-performing assets and paving the way for a continued strengthening of the banks\u2019 \nbalance sheets. To improve its capacity to contribute in the stability of the banking system, the \nPhilippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC) has developed an enhanced framework and \nguidelines  for  provision  of  financial  assistance  to  distressed  banks.  A  study  has  been \nundertaken to determine the adequacy of the Deposit Insurance Fund in relation to the risks in \nthe banking system. A trading and investment policy has been formulated also in PDIC with the \naim of optimizing returns on the DIF.  PDIC will also identify necessary legal amendments to \nstrengthen its methods and options for bank failure resolution, formulate specific guidelines in \nthe judicious provision of financial assistance to banks, develop techniques for asset valuation, \nmanagement  and  disposal,  and  prepare  a  contingency  plan  for  a  big  bank  failure  and/or \nsuccessive failures.  In addition, to strengthen the nonbank financial institutions and reduce \nfinancial  risks  in  the  sector  the  capital  base  of  non-bank  financial  institutions  are  being \nstrengthened. Measures are also being taken for the introduction of risk based capital to ensure \nthat capital is adequate in relation to risks. \n \n  (ii)  Strengthen Nonbank Financial Sector Governance. To guide capital market \ndevelopment and firmly anchor the agenda with stakeholders, the CMDP has been developed in \na consultative manner, in tandem with the MTPDP. The CMDP sets forth 11 objectives for \ncapital  market  development  and  defined  initiatives  for  Government  agencies,  key  market \ninstitutions, and other key stakeholders. The CMDP has been approved and SEC has been \ntasked with the responsibility of implementing the Blueprint in coordination with other relevant \nagencies. SEC and IC have initiated steps to strengthen accounting and financial reporting in \nline  with  international  accounting  standards.  In  this  context  insurance  companies  are  now \nrequired to abide by Philippine Accounting Standards and Philippine Reporting Standards. SEC \nand IC have now started publishing a list of accredited external auditors on their respective \nwebsites while SEC will participate in the International Organization of Securities Commissions \nProject on International Financial Reporting Standards to promote greater convergence in the \ninterpretation  of  such  standards.  To  improve  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  the \ninsurance industry, the Insurance Code is being amended and will be submitted to Congress for \napproval. To achieve effective supervision the Insurance Commission is being reorganized and \na road map will be developed for the insurance industry. To implement best practice standards \nof  insurance  regulation  the  International  Association  of  Insurance  Supervisors  28  Core \nprinciples will be adopted over an agreed time frame. Amendments to the SRC Code will be \nsubmitted to the Congress to enhance the legal protection to SEC staff. The Philippine Dealing \nand Exchange Corporation has been established to provide a centralized platform for fixed-\nincome securities operations and its role as a self regulatory organization will be strengthened. \nAmendments to the Corporation Code will also be submitted to enhance minority shareholders \nrights and promote best principles on corporate governance. \n \n ", "  Appendix 4  51 \n \n  (iii)  Improve Securities Market Efficiency. These measures include developing an \nefficient and liquid secondary market for government debt securities through PDEx to promote \neffective price discovery and transparency that would provide for a more efficient market and an \nactive yield curve. This will also include expansion of trading to qualified investors and the retail \ntrading markets, and preparation for listing and trading of private fixed income securities. Steps \nare being taken to improve the securities market infrastructure of electronic trading platforms, \nclearing, settlement and payment systems for secondary trading in fixed-income securities. To \npromote liquidity in securities market rules for securities borrowing and lending have been \nintroduced in the Philippine Stock Exchange and this will also be extended to PDEx very shortly.  \n \nThis will be followed by rules for short selling in securities. SEC will conduct a study and prepare \nan  action  plan  to  improve  supply  and  quality  of  public  offerings  of  corporate  debt.  The \nSecuritization Act of 2004 was adopted to provide a legal framework for securitized issues and \nto  enable  the  development  of  the  secondary  market  for  asset-backed  securities.  The \nimplementing rules and regulations of the Act were adopted on 25 March 2005. The Corporation \nCode and the SRC Code will be amended and submitted to Congress to mandate the issuance \nof securities in dematerialized form that will improve the clearance and settlement of securities. \n \nIn addition to the above measures, steps are being taken to improve the standards of \ngovernance in Philippines. The thrust will be to institute and implement regulatory and legal \nreforms by promoting the independence of the regulator, and separate operator and regulator \nfunctions. Moreover, institutional reforms will aim to ensure transparency and accountability and \nto mitigate, if not eradicate, administrative impropriety of respective government agencies. This \nwill be further reinforced by strengthening consolidated supervision mechanisms via closer \ncooperation and coordination among financial services regulatory agencies. For instance, the \nFinancial Sector Forum established in July 2004 provides a platform for exchanging information \nand ideas, and coordinating regulatory and supervisory activities of the four member agencies \nnamely, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, SEC, IC and the PDIC.  \n.  \n  The carrying cost of reforms already initiated and planned for the next four to five years \nwill be considerable both in terms of indirect costs as well the foregone revenues and direct \nadjustment costs. At the same time, technical assistance will be required for building capacity in \nSEC, IC and the PDIC to prepare and implement the key reforms under the Program. To \nfinance  these  activities,  the  Government  of  Philippines  request  a  Financial  Market \nIntermediation and Regulation Loan of $200 million to finance the first cluster of the Program \nand the associated technical assistance grant for capacity building as mentioned above.  \n \n  Let me, Mr. President, thank you once more for your support and express the hope that \nthe Financial Market Intermediation and Regulation Program will be considered favorably by \nADB Board at an early date. \n \n  With best regards.  \n \n              Sincerely yours, \n \n \n              Margarito B.Teves \n                 Secretary \n             \n ", " \nTable A4: Policy Matrix  5\n2\n   \nProgram Goal/Impact: Increased contribution of the financial sector to economic growth and development.  \nA\nPolicy  Outcomes:  Policy measures include a set of financial sector reforms to promote diversification of financial channels, enhance  pp\ne\ntransparency, and improve market efficiencies in intermediation.

The  indicative  reform  agenda  under  subprogram  2  builds  on  continued  reforms  to \nenhance financial system stability and financial sector reforms in line with the CMDP and other \nnonbank  subsectors.  Efforts  will  be  concentrated  on  implementing  reform  measures  being \ndeveloped to strengthen debt management under DOF through an enhanced debt management \nstrategy  including  adoption  and  implementation  of  more  effective  mechanisms  for \ncomprehensive debt and risk management consistent with international best practices. Fiscal \nconsolidation measures to be initiated through reforms in financial performance and monitoring \nof  the  GOCCs  are  likely  to  be  covered  under  the  proposed  Development  Policy  Support \nProgram. Emphasis under subprogram 2 will also be on strengthening the insurance industry \nthrough risk-based supervision of insurance companies. Following full implementation of the \nRBCA rule for brokers, SEC is expected to proceed with RBCA rules for other NBFIs under its \njurisdiction. To ensure the systemic stability of the banking industry, PDIC operations will be \nstrengthened by enhancing its resolution methods and mechanisms to address bank failures, \nasset disposal techniques, and the framework for selecting strategic investors. Subprogram 2 \nwill also aim to enhance PDIC\u2019s risk management strategy. \n \n2.  The CMDP is the basis for the nonbank financial sector reforms targeted for completion \nby  2010.  Under  subprogram  2,  progress  with  legal  changes  is  expected  by  submitting \namendments to the SRC and the Corporation Code to Congress. Progress in the legislative \nprocess is anticipated for the amended Insurance Code submitted under the first program, \nRevised  Investment  Company  Act,  Corporate  Recovery  Act,  and  Pre-Need  Code  that  are \npending in Congress. Should any of the draft laws already submitted to Congress be enacted, \nsubprogram 2 will support the preparation of implementing rules and regulations. In addition, it \nwill support the Insurance Commission in managing the transfer of supervisory responsibilities \nfor pre-need schemes from SEC to the commission. The draft amendments to the Corporation \nCode, among others, will prepare for a fully scripless environment for securities, targeted as a \ngoal  under  the  CMDP.  In  the  interim  SEC  and  PSE  will  issue  rules  to  promote  partial \ndematerialization for scripless trading. Additional measures are required by the exchanges, \nclearing and settlement corporations, and depositary corporations to develop the infrastructure \nto support scripless securities.  \n \n3.  The Philippine Payment and Settlement System is a real-time gross settlement system \nthat needs to incorporate a delivery versus payment system for transactions in the secondary \ntrading of government securities executed by institutional investors, nonquasi banks, and public \ninvestors. The extension of this delivery versus payment system to cover private fixed-income \nsecurities and to allow participation of NBFIs will help promote a more liquid secondary market.  \n \n4.  The  rules  and  regulations  introduced  under  subprogram  1  will  be  enforced  and \nmonitored by review missions. SEC is also expected to take the lead in enhancing corporate \ngovernance  by  submitting  to  Congress  the  revised  amendments  to  the  Corporation  Code \ndeveloped under subprogram 1. In addition, SEC is expected to develop and implement a \nsupervisory framework to ensure prompt public disclosure of beneficial ownership of public \ncompanies by officers, directors, and principal shareholders, and changes therein. \n \n5.  The  Insurance  Commission  will  move  forward  with  its  reforms  to  strengthen  the \ncommission through its reorganization, increasing information technology utilization for filing, \nanalysis, and off-site supervision. In addition, a road map for development of the insurance \nindustry will be developed and implemented to provide a vision and guidance for the insurance \nsubsector\u2019s development alongside the CMDP.  \n ", "  Appendix 6  63 \n \n6.  The policy reforms under subprogram 2 are indicative and the scope and schedule of \nsubprogram 2 will be modified as necessary based on a review of the accomplishments under \nsubprogram 1. This will provide flexibility in program design, as adjustments can be made on \nthe basis of the results of subprogram 1 and changes in the external environment. The provision \nof subprogram 2 will be subject to the approval of ADB\u2019s Board of Directors. \n \n ", "64  Appendix 7   \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR \nSTRENGTHENING REGULATION AND GOVERNANCE \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  To  support  implementation  of  the  Financial  Market  Regulation  and  Intermediation \nProgram (FMRIP), the Government of the Philippines asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto provide technical assistance (TA). A TA grant of $800,000 is included in the 2006 assistance \nprogram under ADB\u2019s country strategy and program 2005\u20132007 for the Philippines.1 \n \nB.  Background and Issues \n2.  The  FMRIP  is  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  financial  sector  reform  agenda  and \ndevelopment of capital markets and other nonbank financial services. The immediate objectives \nare  to  (i)  strengthen  macroeconomic  stability;  (ii)  strengthen  governance,  regulation,  and \nintermediation; (ii) enhance transparency and market efficiency; and (iv) improve operational \nefficiency  and  reduce  financial  sector  vulnerabilities.  Growth  of  the  nonbanking  financial \nsubsector, which represents about 20% of total financial sector assets, has been stifled for a \nnumber of reasons, including inadequate prudential regulations and insufficient capacity for \nmonitoring and enforcing rules. The equity and debt markets lack breadth and depth because of \npolicy and regulatory distortions, lack of liquidity, and weak market infrastructure.  \n3.  Development of the nonbanking financial subsector is critical to enhancing domestic \nresource mobilization and fostering competition in the financial sector. A number of countries \nhave  achieved  savings  growth  outside  the  banking  system  by  developing  the  nonbanking \nfinancial subsector. The Government of the Philippines has taken concrete steps to strengthen \nand expand the roles of the Insurance Commission, Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation \n(PDIC), and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as part of its overall efforts to \nintroduce reforms in the financial sector. The issues and challenges facing the sector are \ndiverse  and  well-understood,  and  although  progress  to  more  efficient  markets  and  higher \ngovernance standards has been made in recent years, financial sector development in the \nPhilippines still lags in comparison to the region. Given the expected growth and increasing \ncomplexity of the finance industry, regulators must possess the capability to address difficult \nissues and assume a wider range of responsibilities The FMRIP recognizes that the regulatory \nframework  and  institutional  structure  require  flexibility  to  adapt  to  rapidly  changing \ncircumstances  and  emerging  challenges.  Given  the  fast-changing  nature  and  increasing \ncomplexity of modern financial markets, industry regulators and other market intermediaries \nneed to be supported to upgrade their skill base.  \n4.  Insurance Commission. The Insurance Commission is a government agency under the \nDepartment of Finance (DOF), which supervises and regulates the operation of insurance \ncompanies, mutual benefit associations, and charitable trusts. Its mandate is to (i) promote \ngrowth and financial stability of insurance companies, (ii) professionalize insurance services and \ndevelop insurance consciousness among the general population, (iii) establish a sound national \ninsurance  market,  and  (iv)  safeguard  the  rights  and  interest  of  insurers.  The  Insurance \nCommission has the authority to issue and revoke licenses to insurance agents, general agents, \nresident agents, underwriters, brokers, adjusters, and actuaries; adjudicates insurance claims \nand complaints; and conducts examinations for insurance agents. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program (2005\u20132007): Philippines. Manila. \n ", "  Appendix 7  65 \n5.  During formulation of the FMRIP, governance standards in the Philippine insurance \nindustry were identified as needing strengthening. The Insurance Commission plays a critical \nrole in maintaining confidence and stability in the industry, and in its future development; it is \nalso in the midst of a major reorganization and plans to develop a road map for the development \nof the insurance subsector. Progress will depend to a large extent on the commission\u2019s capacity \nto effectively fulfill its mandate. \n \n6.  Philippines Deposit Insurance Corporation. PDIC, established in 1963 by Republic \nAct  3591  (amended  in  2004),  has  three  core  functions:  (i)  insure  bank  deposits,  (ii) \nreceive/liquidate closed banks, and (iii) coregulate banks in collaboration with BSP. Current \ndeposit insurance coverage is P250,000. PDIC oversees the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), \nwhich  comprises  the  Permanent  Insurance  Fund,  assessment  collections,  reserves  for \ninsurance and financial assistance losses, and retained earnings. The DIF stands at P47.2 \nbillion compared with an estimated need for P90 billion to have adequate funding in relation to \nthe risks in the system.  \n \n7.  PDIC had a major reorganization in 2003, and the following year Congress ratified a bill \namending PDIC\u2019s charter, which, among other things, raised the maximum value of insured \ndeposits to P250, 000 from P100, 000. With more than 440 banks under receivership, the newly \nstreamlined organization must adopt more efficient resolution methods for failed banks and \ndevelop an effective framework for asset disposal.  \n \n8.  Securities  Exchange  Corporation. Established in 1936, SEC derives its mandate, \npowers and broad authority to regulate and supervise corporations, investment firms, and the \nsecurities industry from the SRC, Presidential Decree 902-A, Corporation Code, Investment \nHouses  Law,  Investment  Company  Act,  Financing  Company  Act,  and  other  statutes.  SEC \nregulates the capital market, and licenses and supervises self-regulatory organizationsincluding \n \nthe  Philippine  Stock  Exchange,  Philippine  Central  Depository  Inc.,  and  Securities  Clearing \nCorporation of the Philippines. SEC also oversees company registration and the conduct of \nmarket participants. SEC has a broad and strategic mandate to regulate the securities market. It \nis, however, subject to oversight from DOF. Its rules and decisions can be subject to challenges \nin the courts. It lacks financial autonomy, which impacts its flexibility to meet this mandate. SEC \nfinancing remains a major obstacle to effective market regulation and enforcement, and has \nlimited SEC\u2019s ability to modernize its internal systems and controls, and to function as an \neffective regulator of the securities market. \n \n9.  SEC  has,  in  consultation  with  various  stakeholders,  developed  the  Capital  Market \nDevelopment Plan with strategic objectives focusing on major policy, institutional, legal, and \nregulatory issues during 2005\u20132010. \n \n10.  With all three agencies making efforts to raise standards to international levels, each will \nrequire considerable financial and technical resources to implement their respective programs \nunder the reform agenda.  \nC.  The Technical Assistance \n11.  The TA will assist the Government and implementing agencies in implementing the \nreform agenda leading to increased contribution of the financial sector to economic growth and \ndevelopment. The objective of the TA is to support the Insurance Commission, PDIC, and SEC \nin  preparing  and  implementing  key  policy  reforms  under  the  FMRIP.  Its  scope  therefore \n ", "66  Appendix 7 \nparallels the FMRIP, covering principally the nonbanking and capital markets subsectors. \nWhile the FMRIP is extensive, requiring a multitude of policy reforms, the scope of the TA is \nselective and focuses on policy conditions of the FMRIP that have been assessed to require \ntechnical inputs and capacity-building activities for successful implementation.  \n \n12.  The individual components comprise the following: \n \n(i)  Insurance Commission. Help the Insurance Commission (a) develop practices \nand methodologies to implement risk-based supervision and related capacity \nbuilding; (b) support reorganization by preparing the human resource component \nincluding staffing levels, skills base, and job descriptions; (c) develop a strategy \nto fully implement International Association of Insurance Supervisors 28 core \nprinciples; (d) develop analytical processes and manuals to support upgrading of \ninformation and communication technology, including introduction of electronic \nfiling  and  analysis;  and  (e)  develop  a  road  map  for  insurance  subsector \ndevelopment.  \n \n(ii)  PDIC.  Assist  PDIC  in  (a)  revising  its  resolution  methods  and  introducing \nadditional  instruments  for  more  effective  resolution  of  failed  banks,  (b) \nformulating guidelines for provision of financial assistance to ailing banks, (c) \ndeveloping a framework for efficient disposal of assets including asset valuation, \nmanagement, and disposal, and (d) preparing a contingency plan \u2013 for dealing \nwith the failure of a large bank and/or banks in succession.  \n \n(iii)  SEC. Help SEC to (a) build the capacity of SEC staff for regulating the secondary \ntrading of fixed-income securities; (b) develop an action plan for moving to a \ndematerialized environment, including drafting rules for scripless securities; (c) \nbuild capacity of staff to more effectively monitor compliance with international \naccounting  standard  39,  (d)  standardize  books  and  records  requirements  of \ninvestment houses and other nonbank financial institutions and related audit \nprocedures; and (e) enhance the supervisory framework to ensure prompt public \ndisclosure  of  material  information  by  public  companies  and  their  officers, \ndirectors, and principal shareholders, with respect to beneficial ownership.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost a total $1,150,000 equivalent, of which ADB will provide \n$800,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. The Government will provide the remaining $350,000 equivalent by \nproviding counterpart staff and other support facilities (Table A6). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  DOF will be the Executing Agency; the Insurance Commission, PDIC, and SEC will be \nthe  implementing  agencies.  The  Insurance  Commission,  PDIC,  and  SEC  will  provide  the \nnecessary office space, counterpart staff, and other services to the consultants; and closely \ncoordinate with other stakeholders involved in TA implementation. The TA will be implemented \nimmediately on approval, and be completed over 8 months before September 2007.  \n \n15.  The TA will require about 21 person-months of international consultant inputs, and 24.5 \nperson-months of national consultant inputs. The TA will have separate contracts for each \n ", "  Appendix 7  67 \ncomponent. Consulting services will be provided by a team of individual international and \nnational consultants in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging national consultants.  \n \n16.   The consultants will prepare a detailed work plan before the start of services, which will \ninclude  a  timetable  for  deliverables  defined  under  each  TA  component.  The  consultants \nengaged are required to submit interim reports within the deadline specified in the work plan \nagreed upon with ADB. DOF, Insurance Commission, PDIC, SEC, and ADB will review the \ninterim reports and provide feedback. Draft final reports will be submitted within the deadline \nspecified in the work plans after incorporating the feedback. Tripartite meetings will be held \nbefore finalization of the draft final reports. The final report, incorporating comments of DOF, \nInsurance Commission, PDIC, SEC, and ADB during and after the tripartite meetings, should be \nsubmitted upon completion of service. \n \nTable A6: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($'000) \n \nItem  Total Cost \nA.

Introduction \n \n1.  The proposed Financial Market Regulation and Intermediation Program (FMRIP) aims to \nincrease the contribution of the financial sector to economic growth and development of the \nPhilippines by promoting a more efficient financial sector that can finance profitable private \ninvestment projects at lower cost and risk. The FMRIP is a program cluster that comprises two \nsubprograms to support the Government\u2019s financial sector reforms over the medium term, while \nallowing  for  some  flexibility  in  the  composition  of  the  reforms  for  subprogram  2.  This \nenvironmental assessment report examines the environmental impacts of the policy component of \nthe FMRIP. \n \nB.  Description of the Policy Interventions \n \n2.  The policy measures include a set of financial sector reforms to promote diversification \nof financial channels, and enhance transparency and market efficiencies in intermediation. The \nreform agenda is structured around policy outcomes mostly in line with the Government\u2019s \nMedium-Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP), under the following headings (Table A8):  \n \n(i)  enhance financial system stability, \n(ii)  strengthen nonbank financial sector governance, and \n(iii)  improve securities market efficiency. \n \nTable A8: Environmental Assessment of the Policy Interventions \n \nPolicy Area  Economic and Social  Environmental  Mitigation \nOutcome  Impact  Measures \n1.
