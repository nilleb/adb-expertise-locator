The Project will \nimprove  LSE  quality,  efficiency,  access  and  equity,  and \nmanagement capacity. It will support conditions for improving the \nquality and efficiency of  LSE by completing the curriculum and \ntextbook  renovation  and  related  in-service  teacher  training \nnationwide, and by developing the student assessment system, \nwhich  will  meet  the  requirements  of  the  new  curriculum  and \ntextbooks, will promote equitable access to LSE in disadvantaged \nareas, especially for poor and ethnic minority students, and will \nstrengthen  the  LSE management  capacity  under  the  system  of \ndecentralization from central to local administration. The project \ndesign is based on the secondary education sector master plan \nsupported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and under the \noverall framework of the National Education for All Action Plan, \n2003\u20132015, approved by the Prime Minister in July 2003. \n   \nRationale  Primary  education  became  near-universal  in  2000  with  a  net \nenrollment rate (NER) of over 90%\u2014a remarkable achievement \namong developing countries with similar levels of per capita income. \nExpansion  of  secondary-level  school  coverage  has  also  been \nremarkable. During 1993\u20132002, lower secondary school enrollment \ngrew by almost 100% from 3.2 million to 6.5 million, with the NER  \n  increasing from 30.1% in 1993 to 72.1% in 2002. Viet Nam is \nmaking  good  progress  in  meeting  the  Millennium  Development \nGoals  of  universal  primary  education  and  gender  equity.  The \nGovernment\u2019s sector policy targets by 2010 are to (i) consolidate \nuniversal primary education, (ii) universalize LSE, and (iii) gradually \nexpand  upper  secondary  education.  The  Government  targets  a \nnationwide LSE NER of 80% by 2005 and 90% by 2010. \n   \nDespite impressive gains in access, disparities exist by geographic  \n  location and economic and social background, and much remains to \nbe accomplished to achieve the sector policy targets. Unreached  \n                                                 \n1  Following the Board approval of the R-Paper, Review of ADB\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy, staff instructions to \nreplace the PI/CPI classification with a new tracking system are under preparation in line with paragraph 83 of the \nR-Paper. ", "iii  \n  and poor groups must be reached, and education quality improved \nunder decentralized education management. Viet Nam remains a \nlow-income country with a per capita gross domestic product (GDP) \nestimated  at  $426  in  2002.  Although poverty incidence declined \nfrom 37.6% in 1998 to about 29% in 2002, the poor people living \nbelow the poverty line are typically farmers with little education, and \nupland ethnic minorities. Ethnic minority children are particularly \ndisadvantaged. The lower secondary NER of the Kinh majority was \nalmost 80%, but the NER of ethnic minorities was 48%. The gap \nbetween the poor and the nonpoor is also significant; the NER was \nonly 53.8% for lower secondary students from the poorest income \nquintile, and 85.8% for the richest. While enrollments of males \n(53%)  and  females  (47%)  were  almost  on  par  in 2002, ethnic \nminority female students accounted for only 21.6% of the total lower \nsecondary enrollments.    \n   \nImproving the quality of education is a high policy priority of the \nMinistry of Education and Training (MOET) in view of the need to \ndevelop a creative, flexible, self-motivated, and skilled labor force \nfor a knowledge- and market-based economy.  A new curriculum \nand  compatible  textbooks  and  instructional  materials  were \ndeveloped for all four grades of LSE and have been tested since \nschool year 2000/01 starting from grade 6 (2 years for each grade) \nand introduced nationwide since school year 2002/03 starting from \ngrade 6. The new curriculum intends to encourage active, student-\ncentered teaching and learning methods. The Project seeks to help \nthe Government further develop and improve LSE in accordance \nwith government policies, plans, and targets.   \n   \nObjectives  The  Project  will  help  reduce  poverty  in  Viet  Nam  through  the \ndevelopment and improvement of LSE. Over the medium term, the \nProject  will  improve  quality,  efficiency,  access  and  equity,  and \nmanagement capacity in LSE, in particular, by improving quality \nsupport systems nationwide and by achieving the Government\u2019s \ngoal of universalizing LSE nationwide by 2010. The specific project \nobjectives are to (i) improve LSE quality and efficiency; (ii) promote \nequitable access to LSE for students in disadvantaged areas; and \n(iii) strengthen management capacity in LSE under the system of \ndecentralization  from  MOET  to  local  administration  including \nprovincial departments of education and training (DOETs), bureaus \nof education and training (BOETs), and schools. \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $80.0  million  equivalent \nincluding taxes and duties, physical and price contingencies, and \ninterest charge on the loan. The foreign exchange cost is estimated \nat $21.6 million, or 27.0%, and the local currency cost is estimated \nat $58.4 million equivalent, or 73.0% of the total cost.   \n   \n \n ", "iv \n \nFinancing Plan                                                                                             ($ million) \n   \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total  % \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nADB  21.6  33.4  55.0  69 \nGovernment  0.0  25.0  25.0  31 \nTotal  21.6  58.4  80.0  100 \n \n  ADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n   \nLoan Amount and  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of Special Drawing Rights \nTerms  (SDR) 37,346,000 ($55.0 million equivalent) from its Special Funds \nresources, with a maturity term of 32 years, including a grace period \nof 8 years and an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2011 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2010 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  MOET  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  coordinating  and \nArrangements  implementing all activities of the Project.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Second Lower Secondary Education Development \nProject.   \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  Primary education became near-universal in 2000 with a net enrollment rate (NER) of \nover 90%\u2014a remarkable achievement among developing countries with similar levels of per \ncapita  income.  Expansion  of  secondary-level  school  coverage  has  also  been  remarkable. \nDuring 1993\u20132002, lower secondary school enrollment grew by almost 100% from 3.2 million to \n6.5 million, with the NER increasing from 30.1% in 1993 to 72.1% in 2002.1 Viet Nam is making \ngood progress in meeting the Millennium Development Goals of universal primary education \nand gender equality. The Government\u2019s sector policy targets by 2010 are to (i) consolidate \nuniversal  primary  education,  (ii)  universalize  lower  secondary  education  (LSE),  and  (iii) \ngradually expand upper secondary education. For LSE, the Government targets a nationwide \nNER of 80% by 2005 and 90% by 2010.2 \n \n3.  Despite impressive gains in access, disparities due to geographic location and economic \nand social background exist, and much remains to be accomplished to achieve the sector policy \ntargets. Unreached and poor groups must be reached, and education quality needs to be \nimproved under decentralized education management. Viet Nam remains a low-income country \nwith per capita gross domestic product (GDP) estimated at $426 in 2002. Although poverty \nincidence has declined from 37% in 1998 to about 29% in 2002,3 the poor people living below \nthe poverty line are typically farmers with little education, and upland ethnic minorities.  Ethnic \nminority children are particularly disadvantaged. The lower secondary NER of the Kinh majority \nwas almost 80%, but the NER of ethnic minorities averaged 48%. The gap between the poor \nand the nonpoor is also significant; the NER was only 53.8% for lower secondary students from \nthe poorest income quintile, and 85.8% for the richest (footnote 1). While enrollments of males \n(53%)  and  females  (47%)  were  almost  on  par  in  2002,  ethnic  minority  female  students \naccounted for only 21.6% of the total lower secondary enrollments.  \n \n4.  Improving the quality of education is a high policy priority of the Ministry of Education \nand Training (MOET) in view of the need to develop a creative, flexible, self-motivated, and \nskilled labor force for a knowledge- and market-based economy in the future. New curricula and \ncompatible textbooks and instructional materials were developed for all four grades of lower \nsecondary education and have been piloted since school year 2000/01 starting from grade 6 (2 \nyears for each grade) and introduced nationwide since school year 2002/03 starting from grade \n6. The new curriculum intends to encourage active, student-centered teaching and learning \nmethods. The Project seeks to help the Government further develop and improve LSE in \naccordance with government policies, plans, and targets. The project framework is in Appendix \n1.   \n                                                 \n1  Joint Donor Report to the Vietnam Consultative Group Meeting. 2003.

Country Strategy and Program Update (2004\u20132006): Viet Nam. Manila. ", "2  \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n5.  While LSE in Viet Nam has made remarkable progress in recent years, the following \nconstraints need to be addressed: (i) quality and efficiency, (ii) access and equity, and (iii) \nmanagement capacity. The sector and subsector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n6.  The quality of LSE needs to be improved in terms of student learning achievements.  A \nsystem of periodic, sample-based learning assessments is required to evaluate the curriculum \nand  teacher  effectiveness  and  hence,  quality  improvements  in  education.  However,  such \nassessments focus largely on lower order cognitive skills (knowledge of facts) and students tend \nto focus their learning on developing retentive memories. Learning assessments need to be \naligned with the goals of the new curriculum. There are about 260,000 LSE teachers in school \nyear 2002/03, of whom an estimated 237,000 (or 91% of the total LSE teachers) were qualified. \nHowever, to help improve quality, most in-service teachers, even those with formal qualifications, \nneed to update their teaching skills and be familiar with curricular changes and new teaching \nmethods.  Active,  student-centered  teaching  and  learning  methods  have  been  piloted  and \nintroduced nationwide. However, teaching styles are still largely teacher-centered and not \nenough attention is paid to individual student differences in interest and capacity. A challenge \nwill be to fully make classroom teaching and learning active and student centered. In-class \ninstructional time is low by international standards. Many schools operate on a double shift \nsystem; some share school buildings with the local primary schools and offer only an average \nteacher contact of less than 4 hours a day. To meet international standards, teacher contact \nshould be 6 hours per day for a 5-day, 40-week school year. The supply of textbooks and \ninstructional materials also varies by household income level, school location, and subject area. \nSchools need more and better teaching aids, equipment and function rooms, especially libraries, \nscience laboratories, and computer rooms.  \n \n7.  Internal efficiency remains low, with higher dropout and class repetition rates than the \nnational average rate in some regions of the country such as the central highlands, Mekong \nRiver delta, and northwest. Overage students are numerous as a result of delayed entry and \nrepetition. The average time for completing LSE is about 5.4 years, compared with 4 years if \nstudents do not have to repeat grades or drop out. There is little data on external efficiency \nbased on the students\u2019 completion of LSE, and it is a weakness that must be addressed to \nadequately assess LSE responsiveness to human resources demands.   \n \n8.  Limited  access,  especially  by  the  poor  and  ethnic  minorities,  remains  a  problem.  \nDisparities among provinces and among districts in a province are also significant. NERs of \nprovinces in poor regions such as the northern uplands, central coast, central highlands, and \nMekong River delta were below the national average rate of about 72% in 2002. Achieving \nuniversal LSE requires a targeted approach by focusing on specific provinces, districts, and \nethnic minority groups. The main reason for the differences in lower secondary enrollment \nacross income categories (para. 3) has to do with the opportunity cost of sending children to \nschool.  Poor  students  need  to  boost  family  income  or  assist  in  the  household.  Parents, \nespecially among the poor and ethnic minorities, do not sufficiently value education to send their \nchildren to lower secondary school or keep them there. Moreover, there are other specific and \ninterrelated constraints on access and equity to LSE: (i) the number of lower secondary schools \nis insufficient; (ii) schools are too far away for reasonable daily access by school-age children; \n(iii) boarding school facilities at the nearest available lower secondary school are lacking; and iv) \nstudents do not finish primary school or finish it too late to reasonably attend lower secondary \nschool. 4 \n \n                                                 \n4 ADB and MOET.2004. Second Lower Secondary Education Development Project. Manila (TA Final Report). ", "  3\n9.  In view of significant differences in management capacity among provinces and among \ndistricts in a province, the management capacity for LSE\u2014especially in the areas of education \nplanning and budgeting, and application of information and communication technology (ICT)\u2013\nneeds to be strengthened at the provincial, district, commune, and school levels. In addition, \nmore equitable cost-sharing measures should be introduced without increasing the household \nfinancial burden of the poor. In 2002, the financial burden measured as a percentage of total \nhousehold expenditure is roughly the same for all population groups with a range of 2.7% to \n2.9% of the total household expenditure, except for the richest quintile paying slightly more with \n3.1%  (footnote  1).  Through  a  program  of  school-based  management  training,  parent  and \ncommunity involvement in school management should also be encouraged and institutionalized \nto assure effective participation in school-related issues. \n \n10.  The  Government  accords  high  priority  to  the  development  of  secondary  education \nbecause it is expected to provide the level of human resources required to meet the country\u2019s \ncritical  social  and  economic  development  goals  and  contribute  to  poverty  reduction.  In \naccordance with the Government\u2019s priority on secondary education,  the assistance of Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in the education sector in Viet Nam has focused on secondary \neducation,  starting  with  the  Lower  Secondary  Education  Development  Project  (LSEDP) \napproved  in  1997,  together  with  the  Teacher  Training  Project  approved  in  1999  for  lower \nsecondary  preservice  teacher  training  system  developments,5 and  the  Upper  Secondary \nEducation Development Project approved in 2002.6 ADB is also supporting the renovation of the \nvocational and technical education system.7 In particular, the LSEDP has made remarkable \nprogress in all three project components of quality, access, and institutional development. Key \nlessons from the LSEDP are as follows: (i) the piloting of new curriculum and textbooks needs \nto comply with Government regulations and requires a lot of dissemination efforts; (ii) lower \nsecondary school-age population in disadvantaged areas is still underserved; (iii) LSE quality \nsupport systems such as student assessments, teachers in some subject areas, teaching \ncontents and methods have not fully met the requirements in the new curriculum; (iv) foreign \nlanguage and information and communication technology (ICT) teachers especially need further \nin-service training; and (v) management capacity in LSE has to be further strengthened at all \nlevels to meet the new planning and management methods requirements. These lessons and \ninitiatives from the LSEDP will be continuously addressed and appropriately incorporated in the \nproject design. Similar lessons on preservice lower secondary teacher training are drawn from the \nTeacher Training Project. \n \n11.  In  line  with  policies  and  targets  set  out  in  the  Government\u2019s  long-term  education \ndevelopment strategy covering the 10 years from 2001 to 2010 (footnote 2), ADB assisted the \nGovernment in formulating a Secondary Education Sector Master Plan (SESMP), which serves \nas an analytical  tool  and  guide  for  future  decision  making on policy frameworks, feasible \nstrategies,  and  investment  priorities.8 The  European  Union  is  supporting  improvements  in \nMOET capacity for sector analysis, quality improvement, finance, and management, including \nan information system. The World Bank; bilateral agencies from Australia, Canada, Japan, \nNorway,  and  United  Kingdom;  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund;  and  nongovernment \norganizations have focused on primary education and primary education teacher training.

", "4  \nWorld Bank and bilateral agencies from Belgium, Japan, and Netherlands are also supporting \nhigher education. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has supported a primary \neducation  development  plan. 9  The  United  Nations  Education,  Scientific  and  Cultural \nOrganization (UNESCO) and the World Bank helped the Government prepare the National \nEducation for All (EFA) Action Plan, 2003\u20132015, which was approved by the Prime Minister in \n2003.10 Canada, UNESCO, and the World Bank are assisting  in its implementation through \ncapacity building in provincial education planning. The national EFA planning process has \nintegrated  findings  and  recommendations  of  the  JICA-supported  primary  education \ndevelopment plan and of the ADB-supported SESMP. External assistance  to the education \nsector is described in Appendix 3. \n \n12.  Given the strategic role of LSE and based on the expected outcomes to be achieved by \nthe LSEDP, MOET has identified three primary areas for further development: (i) improving the \nquality and  efficiency  of  education;  (ii) increasing  equitable  access  to  education  with  full \nparticipation  of  poor  and  ethnic  minority  students;  and  (iii)  making  education  management \ncapable and efficient under the system of decentralization. Quality improvement is the highest \npolicy priority.  In this connection, MOET plans to develop fundamental school quality levels \n(FSQL) for LSE as a minimum national standard for school facilities and personnel for quality \ncontrol, which is expected to be regularized by a Ministerial decree. ADB\u2019s strategy will support \nthe Government\u2019s vision to modernize the economy and reduce poverty by encouraging pro-\npoor, sustainable growth and structural changes. ADB\u2019s country strategy and program will focus \neducation sector operations on helping the Government achieve quality universal LSE by 2010 \nand gradually expand upper secondary education.11 This strategy is consistent with ADB\u2019s past \noperations and with the emphasis of other aid agencies on consolidating universal access to \nquality primary education, and developing higher education.  \n \nIII.        THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objectives \n \n13.  The  Project  design  is  based  on  the  SESMP,  in  accordance  with  the  goal  of  the \nVietnamese Education Development Strategy, 2001\u20132010, and under the overall framework of \nthe National EFA Action Plan, 2003\u20132015. The Project will help reduce poverty in Viet Nam \nthrough development and improvement of LSE. In particular, the Project will improve quality, \nefficiency, access and equity, and management capacity in LSE by improving quality support \nsystems nationwide and universalizing LSE by 2010. The specific project objectives are to (i) \nimprove LSE quality and efficiency by completing the curriculum and textbook renovation and \nrelated in-service teacher training; (ii) promote equitable access to lower secondary students in \ndisadvantaged areas; and (iii) strengthen  LSE management capacity under the system of \ndecentralization from MOET to local administration: provincial departments of education and \ntraining (DOETs), bureaus of education and training (BOETs), and schools.12  \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n14.  The Project will have  three components: (i) improving LSE quality and efficiency; (ii) \npromoting  LSE  access  and  equity  in  disadvantaged  areas;  and  (iii)  strengthening  LSE \nmanagement capacity under the system of decentralization.

", "  5\nunder components 1 and 3, the 28 priority provinces proposed by MOET will be the focus of \ncomponent 2.13  These provinces are Vinh Phuc in the Red River delta; Bac Can, Cao Bang, Ha \nGiang, Lao Cai, Lang Son, Phu Tho, Tuyen Quang, and Yen Bai in the northeast; Dien Bien, \nHoa Binh, Lai Chau, and Son La in the northwest; Ha Tinh and Nghe An in the north central \ncoast; Binh Dinh, Phu Yen, and Quang Nam in the south central coast; Dak Lak, Dak Nong, Gia \nLai, Kon Tum, and Lam Dong in the central highlands; Binh Phuoc, Binh Thuan, Ninh Thuan, \nand Tay Ninh in the South; and Tra Vinh in the Mekong River Delta.14 Profiles and education \ndata of the 28 selected provinces are in Supplementary Appendix A. The Project components \nare briefly summarized: \n \n1.  Improving  the  Quality  and  Efficiency  of  Lower  Secondary  Education \n(Component 1) \n15.  The Project will help MOET complete the introduction of the new LSE curriculum and \ntextbooks and related in-service teacher training up to grade 9  begun under the ongoing \nLSEDP. This component aims to improve the quality and efficiency of LSE in support of \nuniversalization of quality LSE by 2010. This objective will be carried out in five subcomponents: \n(i) improving the quality of the assessment of student learning outcomes, (ii) improving teaching \nwith equipment and facilities, (iii) enhancing foreign language teaching and the use of ICT in \nschools, (iv) supporting for vocational orientation and continuing education, and (v) improving \nteaching contents and methods by continuing the development of instructional materials begun \nunder the LSEDP and the delivery of in-service teacher training. \n \n              a.  Improving the Quality of Assessment of Student Learning Outcomes \n \n16.  The Project will continue and extend the program of strengthening the assessment of \nstudent learning outcomes begun under the LSEDP. The objectives of the subcomponent are to \n(i) develop the learning assessment standards for each subject and grade of LSE, (ii) try out \nregulations  of  examination  and  education  quality  assessment,  (iii)  further  develop  sample \nassessment materials, and (iv) develop item banks for all four grades of LSE. In-service training \nwill be provided for all involved in student assessment\u2014teachers, principals, and DOET and \nBOET staff. In addition, selected senior officials from DOETs will receive higher-level training to \nbecome specialists in assessment. Exemplary assessment materials will be developed for all \ngrades and subjects, and all teachers will receive up to 4 hours of training in their use. Modules \non using student learning outcome information to  formulate, adjust, and evaluate education \nplans will be developed, and all school principals will receive 20 hours in-service training on \ntheir use.  Assessment centers of DOETs and BOETs will be suitably equipped. A system of \nannual reporting that analyzes examinations and student responses will be developed. An item \nbank library of assessment items for each subject and grade will be developed and made \navailable  in  paper  or  computerized  form.  Student  achievement  at  the  national  level  will \nmonitored  through  a  sample-based  student  learning  outcome  monitoring  system,  so  that \neducation policy makers and planners can monitor the status of student achievements in \nvarious subjects nationwide. The Project will collaborate with other aid-supported activities in \n                                                 \n13  Effective 1 January 2004, the 61 provinces were increased to 64, by dividing each of three provinces into two \nprovinces. Two of these three provinces are included in component 2: Dak Lak divided into Dak Lak and Dak \nNong; and Lai Chau divided into Dien Bien and Lai Chau.  \n14  The 28 provinces were selected and prioritized on the basis of indicators related to socioeconomic development, \neducation  development,  social  equity,  and  coverage  by  other  projects including the  ADB-financed  Lower \nSecondary Education Development Project and Emergency Assistance for Rehabilitation of Flood Damage Project. \nIt should be noted, however, that the final Government decision on the selected provinces under component 2 is \nsubject to the Government\u2019s further appraisal and approving process.  ", "6  \nmeasuring quality including the development of the item banks and the analysis and reporting \nsystems relating to learning achievements.15  \n \nb.   Improving Teaching with Equipment and Facilities \n \n17.  The  objectives  of  this  subcomponent  are  to  (i)  upgrade  facilities  of  and  provide \nequipment to provincial key schools and district ethnic minority boarding schools; and (ii) \nestablish model function rooms to demonstrate how to optimize the use of teaching aids with \nstudent-centered, active teaching methods. The Project will upgrade the facilities of and provide \nequipment to 384 function rooms at 64 provincial key schools. A key school is a designated \nschool in each of 64 provinces to serve as a model lower secondary school for its excellence in \nteaching and learning facilities and conditions. Details of key schools are in Supplementary \nAppendix B. The Project will also upgrade facilities of and provide equipment to 54 function \nrooms at nine district ethnic minority boarding schools. Model function rooms will be established \nin 64 key schools to which other schools may send their teachers to learn how to make optimum \nuse of teaching aids. Each key school and ethnic minority boarding school will have six function \nrooms comprising three science rooms (physics, chemistry, biology), one foreign language \nlaboratory, one computer room, and one library.   \n \nc.  Enhancing Foreign Language Teaching and the Use of Information \nand Communication Technology in Schools \n \n18.  In 2003, MOET announced a fresh emphasis on foreign language teaching and learning \nas a strategy to facilitate the acquisition  of foreign knowledge and skills, and accelerate the \nprocess of modernization, industrialization, and global integration of Viet Nam. The Project will \nhelp MOET ensure the quality and effectiveness of foreign language teaching with the new \ncurriculum and textbooks by renovating foreign language teaching methods and practices \nincluding  in-service  foreign  language  teacher  training;  and  providing  equipment  to  lower \nsecondary  schools  specializing  in  foreign  language  teaching,  and  reference  materials, \nespecially video tapes and foreign language teaching software, to foreign language teachers.  \n \n19.  The LSEDP completed the development of the ICT curriculum, which was approved by \nMOET in 2001 as an optional subject in grades 8 and 9, and provided computers for more than \n1,200 lower secondary schools to help introduce ICT in schools. The Project will integrate the \nuse  of  ICT  into  classroom  teaching  practices  by  developing  suitable  materials  on  ICT \napplications and teaching, providing in-service training to about 24,000 teachers, and equipping \nICT centers at MOET and each of the 64 DOETs, so that all lower secondary teachers will have \nICT knowledge and skills by 2010.   \n \nd.   Support for Vocational Orientation and Continuing Education \n \n20.  The Government\u2019s sector goal of universalizing LSE  covers youths aged 15\u201318 who \nhave not begun or who have not completed a full 4-year cycle of LSE. Youths who wish to \ncomplete LSE but who do not or cannot return to lower secondary schools are  directed to \ncenters of vocational orientation, continuing education, or supplementary classes. To achieve \nuniversalization of LSE and inform students of vocational and education choices, the Project will \n(i) develop materials on employment and education pathways to be used in all lower secondary \nschools, and  (ii) train mentors overseas to provide in-service training to teachers who will \nprovide vocational information and orientation to students. It will also develop suitable learning \nmaterials for returning students in the modified curriculum using active teaching and learning \n                                                 \n15 The details of the proposed aid-supported activities are being discussed with MOET representatives at the \nEducation Sector Group Meetings,  and concrete collaborative arrangements will be firmed up during  project \nimplementation.   ", "  7\nmethods. Equipment will be provided to continuing education centers (CECs) and vocational \nguidance centers (VGCs). \n \ne.   Improving Teaching Contents and Methods  \n \n21.  The  purpose  of  this  subcomponent  is  to  continue  and  reinforce  improvements  in \nteaching contents and methods, by reviewing and completing the nationwide introduction of the \nnew curriculum and textbooks (for grade 9) and related in-service teacher training (for grade 9), \nwhich began under the LSEDP. Teaching contents need to be more student-centered by \naccommodating  individual  student  differences.  Teaching  methods  need  to  emphasize  the \ndevelopment of higher order thinking and life skills. The project interventions are designed to \nrespond to these challenges by developing instructional materials and delivering in-service \nteacher training and staff development. The developed instructional materials are for use by \nteachers,  trainers,  mentors,  and  school  principals.  The  provision  of  teaching  methods \nhandbooks, teachers guidebooks, and self-study manuals will involve one guidebook and one \nself-study book for each of 15 subjects for about 260,000 teachers, 70,000 manuals for mentors, \n4,500 manuals for trainers on distance learning for teachers, and 28,500 manuals (three \nmanuals for each) for 9,500 school principals, focusing on clinical supervision of teachers. In-\nservice training and staff development will focus on the content and use of the instructional \nmaterials. It will include sending a number of trainers from MOET and DOETs on short-term \ncourses overseas; upgrading the qualifications of about 3,200 mentors; continuing training of \n10,000 unqualified teachers; school-based training for over 1,800 teachers of music, arts, \nphysical education, and foreign languages; and continuing training for teacher support staff, \nnamely, one librarian and one laboratory assistant per lower secondary school per province.   \n   \n  2.  Promoting  Access  and  Equity  in  Lower  Secondary  Education  in \nDisadvantaged Areas (Component 2) \n \n22.  The objective of component 2 is to help students in disadvantaged areas, especially the \npoor  and  ethnic  minorities,  to  gain  equitable  access  to  LSE.  Component  2  has  two \nsubcomponents:  (i)  constructing  and  upgrading  school  facilities,  and  (ii)  supporting \ndisadvantaged students. Expanding and upgrading school facilities will take place in the 28 \ntargeted provinces, which will be divided into three priority groups according to their levels of \ndisadvantage. The 28 priority provinces proposed by MOET are grouped into three categories. \nThe first priority group will be the 11 disadvantaged provinces with highest inequality in access: \nBinh Phuoc, Cao Bang, Dak Lak, Dak Nong, Dien Bien, Gia Lai, Ha Giang, Lai Chau, Lao Cai, \nNinh Thuan, and Tra Vinh.  The second priority group will be the next nine disadvantaged \nprovinces with inequality in access: Bac Can, Hoa Binh, Kon Tum, Lam Dong, Lang Son, Phu \nYen, Son La, Tuyen Quang,  and  Yen Bai. The third priority group will be the next eight \ndisadvantaged provinces with inequality in access: Binh Dinh, Binh Thuan, Ha Tinh, Nghe An, \nPhu Tho, Quang Nam, Tay Ninh, and Vinh Phuc. An analysis of the education Gini coefficient in \nViet Nam to determine the extent of inequity in access in these provinces is in Supplementary \nAppendix C.  \n \na.  Constructing and Upgrading School Facilities \n \n23.  The Project will build on the outcomes of the ongoing LSEDP for constructing and \nreplacing  classrooms.  This  subcomponent  will  include  providing  civil  works,  equipment, \nfurniture, sanitary facilities, and water supply for toilets and drinking. Provision of improved and \nseparate  sanitary  facilities  for  girls,  with  proper  toilets,  sanitation  and  water  supply,  will \ncontribute to prevent female students drop outs. Civil works will comprise construction and \nreplacement of 3,186 rooms\u2014247 schools with 1,482 classrooms equivalent, 247 libraries, 247 \nICT/computer rooms, 247 laboratories, 960 boarding rooms, and 3 multifunction rooms. All the ", "8  \nnewly built schools will be equipped with accommodation and board for teachers and students. \nDOETs in the selected provinces will be responsible for finalizing the list of districts, communes, \nand schools to invest in under the Project, taking into account these criteria: absence of a lower \nsecondary school, proportion of ethnic minorities in the province or district, poverty incidence, \ngeneral conditions within mountainous areas, and the presence of schools with the poorest \nphysical facilities. Civil works will be implemented in two stages. Stage I will start in 2006 with \nbuilding 143 schools (63 schools from the first-priority group, 40 from the second-priority group, \nand 40 from the third-priority group). Stage 2 will start in 2007, with building the remaining 104 \nschools (63 from the first-priority group and 40 from the second-priority group).    \n \nb.  Support for Disadvantaged Students \n \n24.  The objective of this subcomponent is to attract and retain students from disadvantaged \nand ethnic minority communities. Four interventions  are designed  to attain that objective: (i) \ndevelopment  of  relevant  teaching  materials;  (ii)  provision  of  in-service training for teacher \nmentors; (iii) conduct of special studies on matters relating to ethnic minority students; and (iv) \ndirect support for poor, ethnic minority, and female students. Teaching materials that relate to \nthe perception and learning conditions of ethnic minority students will be developed. The Project \nwill provide in-service training for teacher mentors of the targeted provinces in line with the \ndevelopment of the foregoing teaching materials. Studies will be supported on matters relating \nto  ethnic  minority  students,  particularly  psychology,  access  to  education,  and  traditional \neducation. The subcomponent will directly support ethnic minorities,  the poor, and female \nstudents by providing grade 9 textbooks and reference books, traditional and modern musical \ninstruments to ethnic minority students in boarding schools, gender education materials for \nfemale  students,  and  favorable  living  conditions  in  boarding  and  semiboarding  schools, \nincluding the supply of electric pumps, and construction of wells for clean water.  \n \n3.  Strengthening Management Capacity of Lower Secondary Education under \nthe System of Decentralization (Component 3) \n \n25.  The objective of this component is to strengthen management capacity for LSE under \ndecentralization, particularly at BOET and school levels. Three subcomponents will help meet \nthat objective: (i) developing FSQLs for LSE; (ii) building capacity for management of LSE; and \n(iii) supporting project management and implementation. \n \na.  Development  of  Fundamental  School  Quality  Levels  for  Lower \nSecondary Education \n26.  Management at all levels will be guided by MOET regulations on minimum standards, \nknown as the FSQLs, to ensure quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of teaching and learning in \nschools. At the lower secondary level, FSQL objectives are to (i) establish minimum standards \nof lower secondary schools in terms of school personnel and school facilities  necessary for \nquality,  effective,  and  efficient  teaching  and  learning;  (ii)  attract  and  retain  students  by \nestablishing standards that make schools more attractive centers of learning; (iii) provide the \nbase for local education authorities and people\u2019s committees to develop investment plans, \nespecially in disadvantaged areas; and (iv) progressively narrow the gap in education quality \namong provinces, districts, and schools.  Through a committee of experts from MOET and \nrelevant ministries and agencies, the Project will help the Government develop FSQLs for LSE. \nThe expert committee will identify and elaborate FSQLs that are realistic and achievable for all \nlower secondary schools by 2010. The Project will be in collaboration with the World Bank and \nother bilateral aid agencies, which are developing FSQLs for primary education under the ", "  9\nPrimary Education for Disadvantaged Children Project.16 FSQLs for LSE are in Supplementary \nAppendix D.  \n \nb.  Capacity Building for Management of Lower Secondary Education \n \n27.  The Project will coordinate its interventions with those of other projects that offer support \nin capacity building for management including LSE.17 The Project will strengthen management \ncapacity at the district and school levels through programs on (i) ICT training and equipment; (ii) \ninformation, education, and communication (IEC); and (iii) school mapping. ICT support will \ninclude training and provision of equipment in managing student records, libraries, examinations, \nand results. The Project will support IEC programs to inform, attract, and retain students in LSE. \nConsulting services and training in school mapping will be provided to related agencies under \nMOET, BOETs and schools to ensure the most efficient location of lower secondary schools on \na  sustainable  basis  and  to  develop  a  database  of  the  equipment  and  facilities  of  lower \nsecondary schools.   \n \nc.  Project Management and Implementation Support \n \n28.  This  subcomponent  aims  to  strengthen  management,  monitoring,  and  evaluation \ncapacity in project implementation from the central to provincial, district, and commune levels. \nInterventions will be in three areas: (i) organizing training courses on project management and \nimplementation  for  project  staff  at  central,  provincial,  district,  and  commune  levels;  (ii) \ndeveloping a project management and implementation network from the center to these levels; \nand (iii) conducting surveys to evaluate the Project impact on LSE. In-service training courses \non project management and implementation will involve approximately 50 staff member from \ncentral and provincial levels. In-service training courses for up to about 300 of staff from districts \nand  communes  will  be  conducted  on  matters  related  to  civil  works  and  procurement  of \nequipment.  A  project  management  and  implementation  network  will  be  established,  using \nproject evaluation indicators to monitor the Project through a system of model data collection \nforms. The Project will provide network equipment for DOETs and BOETs to develop an \ninformation network on project management. Three surveys will evaluate the Project impact on \nLSE and identify challenges to be solved during implementation. The surveys will be carried out \nduring the first year of project implementation, the midterm, and the last year of implementation. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n29.  Piloting of Key Schools. The key schools will be the model or demonstration schools, \nillustrating specific new ideas and  teaching practices, the use of ICT, best boarding school \npractices, in-service teacher training, and student learning assessment. Key schools will also \nexperiment with paperless or electronic libraries, virtual (computer-driven) science laboratories, \ncomputer networking, and other up-to-date developments in teaching and learning. These ICT-\nrelated education instruments will be pilot-tested, and the performance of key schools will be \nassessed to study and document the effectiveness of such instruments. \n \n30.  Returning Students. To attain universalization of LSE by 2010, the Project will assist \nMOET in providing for the schooling of youths of 15\u201318 years who have dropped out of LSE or \nmay not have entered a lower secondary school before. The Project will develop materials on \nemployment and education pathways for use in all lower secondary schools, and train mentors \n                                                 \n16  World Bank. 2002.

", "10  \nto give in-service training to teachers who will provide vocational information and orientation to \nstudents.  \n \n31.  Vocational Orientation and Tracer Studies. Consulting services will help develop \nvocational orientation manuals, which will enable teachers of grades 8 and 9 to better advise \nstudents on employment choices and on subject selection in the transition from lower to upper \nsecondary education. To generate information on the external efficiency of LSE, training on the \npurpose, conduct, and outcomes of tracer studies will also be provided at the DOET level.  \nDOET in turn will offer training at the BOET and school levels. \n \n32.  Development  of Fundamental  School  Quality  Levels. FSQLs, which have been \ndeveloped by MOET at primary education level, will be further elaborated to establish minimum \nstandards at the lower secondary level. The  FSQLs will be physically expressed in the 247 \nschools to be constructed or replaced under the Project, and in the pilot key schools that the \nProject will support. By developing FSQLs, the Project will also assist in identifying minimum \nstandards for boarding schools for ethnic minority children. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n33.  The total project cost is estimated at $80.0 million equivalent including taxes and duties, \nphysical and price contingencies, and interest charge on the loan (Table 1). The foreign \nexchange cost is estimated at $21.6 million, or 27.0%, and the local currency cost is estimated \nat $58.4 million equivalent or 73.0% of the total cost.

Financing Plan \n34.  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $55.0 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources to finance 68.8% of the total project cost (Table 2). ADB will fund 100.0% of \nthe foreign exchange cost or 27.0% of the estimated total project cost, and $33.4 million \nequivalent of the local currency cost or about 57.2% of the total local currency cost.  The ADB ", "  11\nloan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The remaining $25 \nmillion equivalent as counterpart financing, or 31.2% of the total project cost, will be provided by \nthe Government. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n                                                                     Foreign          Local            Total \nSource                          Exchange     Currency         Cost              % \nAsian Development Bank                               21.6                33.4             55.0              69      \nGovernment                                                      0.0                25.0             25.0              31      \n    Total         21.6              58.4           80.0            100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n \n35.  Financing for  the local currency cost of about $33.4 million equivalent is considered \njustified  under  ADB's  local  currency  financing  policy. 18 From  an  economic  perspective, \nassistance is required to meet the local currency cost of development projects because a low \nlevel of per capita income hinders national savings and puts public finance under pressure. The \nGovernment is enhancing revenue collection and improving the efficiency of public expenditure \nand incentives for private sector participation in revenue-generating public sector projects. \nAlthough these efforts are expected to increase national savings, a significant resource gap will \ncontinue for some time because the country needs large capital investments. Thus, ADB \nassistance for project-related local currency expenditures is economically justified. From a \ntechnical perspective, the high level of financing for local currency cost is justified because (i) \nmany  small  civil  works  are  scattered  over  numerous  rural  sites,  which  will  utilize  locally \nproduced construction materials; (ii) instructional materials are locally produced; (iii) classroom \nequipment and  furniture are locally procured; and (iv) the Project is funding the in-country \ntraining programs and recruitment of domestic consultants. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n36.  MOET, as the Executing Agency, will have overall responsibility for coordinating and \nimplementing all  project activities. The structure of project management and implementation \ncomprises (i) at the central level, the central project steering committee (CPSC) and the central \nproject coordination unit (CPCU); (ii) at the provincial level,  the provincial project steering \ncommittee (PPSC) and provincial project implementation unit (PPIU) within DOET, together with \na coordination group from the teacher training college for in-service training; and (iii) at the \ndistrict and school levels, project implementation coordinators within BOET and principals in \nproject schools. The Project management and implementation structure is in Appendix 5.  \n \n37.  The CPSC will be an interministerial steering committee chaired by the vice minister of \nMOET. The CPSC will provide overall guidance to the Project, monitor activities and outputs, \nand coordinate activities. The CPSC will consist of representatives from MOET, Ministry of \nFinance, Ministry of Planning and Investment, State Bank of Viet Nam, Government Office, and \nState Treasury. MOET will be represented by its relevant department.    \n \n                                                 \n18  ADB. 1995. A Review of Lending Foreign Exchange for Local Currency Expenditure on Projects. Manila.  ", "12  \n38.  The CPCU will oversee day-to-day project implementation, and will be staffed with a \nmanager, a deputy manager, and project staff appointed by MOET from relevant departments \nand agencies of MOET, and other support and administrative staff. The CPCU will be supported \nby international and domestic consultants. The manager of the CPCU will be a standing \nmember  of  the  CPSC.  The  CPCU  will  be  responsible  for  overall  planning,  management, \nadministration, and coordination of the Project. Specifically, it will undertake (i) planning for \nproject implementation and overall coordination of activities, including monitoring and evaluation \nof progress; (ii) administration, including personnel management, accounting and monitoring \nand reporting needs, for both the Government and ADB; (iii) procurement of goods at the central \nlevel; (iv) hiring of consulting services; and (v) handling of all procurement except for civil works.   \n \n39.  The PPSC will be established in each of the 28 priority provinces under Component 2. \nThe committee chairperson will be the Deputy Chairman of the Provincial People\u2019s Committee; \nthe deputy chairperson will be the Director or Deputy Director of DOET; the PPIU manager will \nbe a standing member. Other members will be drawn from the provincial departments of \nfinance, planning and investment, civil works, with some specialists from DOET. The PPSC will \nassist the PPIU in  land planning and acquisition, school construction, supplying counterpart \nfunding for civil works, and maintaining classrooms and equipment. \n \n40.  The PPIU will be established in each of the 64 DOETs. The Deputy Director of DOET \nwill be the unit manager; members will be specialists from relevant sections of DOET (finance, \nplanning, personnel, secondary education), and the Director of the Teacher Training College will \nalso be the deputy manager in charge of provincial in-service teacher training. PPIUs will be \nresponsible  for  (i)  organizing  and  supervising  the  construction  programs  prepared  by  the \ndistricts; (ii) local competitive bidding (LCB) for civil works; (iii) project implementation support, \nincluding  in-service  training;  (iv)  cooperation  with  CPCU  and  BOETs  in  implementing  the \nProject; and (v) receiving monthly reports from BOETs and submitting its own monthly reports \non project implementation to the CPCU. The PPIU will be provided with suitable facilities and \nequipment.  \n \n41.  A group of project implementation coordinators will be established under the direction of \nBOET. BOETs will be responsible for receiving and distributing in-service training materials to \nlower secondary schools, and CECs and VGCs, and will coordinate the organization of in-\nservice training with the PPIU. Principals will be responsible for implementing, monitoring, and \nevaluating all project activities in their schools, as well as maintaining facilities and classrooms \nprovided under the Project. Commune people\u2019s committees will assist the school principals in \nimplementing and monitoring the Project in each school. \n \n2.  Implementation Schedule \n \n42.  The Project will be implemented in two stages over 6 years, from January 2005 to end-\n2010. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 6. \n \n3.  Procurement  \n \n43.  All  ADB-financed  goods  and  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. As civil works will be small in amount and scattered across the \ncountry, they will be awarded on the basis of LCB following Government procedures acceptable \nto ADB.  The CPCU will be responsible for procurement including international competitive \nbidding (ICB) for goods, LCB (except for civil works), and international shopping. Using LCB \nprocedures or direct purchase, the PPIUs will procure the civil works, instructional materials, \nand small quantities of goods such as office consumables. State-owned enterprises that may ", "  13\nparticipate in bidding under the Project must be financially autonomous and operate under \ncommercial laws. The indicative procurement package is in Appendix 7.  \n \na.  Equipment and Materials \n \n44.  Supply contracts for goods estimated at $500,000 equivalent or more will be awarded on \nthe basis of ICB. Supply contracts for goods such as vehicles and computers (other than \ninstructional materials) costing less than $500,000 equivalent but more than $100,000 will follow \ninternational shopping procedures. Supply contracts for instructional materials costing less than \n$500,000 equivalent but more than $100,000 will follow LCB procedures. Minor items including \ninstructional  materials  costing  less  than  $100,000  equivalent  may  be  procured  by  direct \npurchase. Supply contracts for teachers manuals and handbooks may be awarded to the \nappropriate education publishing houses on the basis of LCB if the amount is less than \n$500,000 equivalent but more than $100,000, or by direct purchase if the amount is less than \n$100,000.  \n \nb.  Civil Works \n \n45.  Civil works will consist of construction and replacement of school classrooms and \nfacilities. The estimated unit cost is $10,000 per classroom or facility, including design and \nconstruction supervision. Technical design study and supervision of construction quality below \n$100,000 will be procured by direct purchase. The civil works are spread over lower secondary \nschools in 28 disadvantaged provinces. They will be financed by ADB and the Government, and \nwill be awarded on the basis of LCB, following government procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n \nc.  Advance Action \n \n46.  MOET will carry out advance action for procuring equipment and civil works. MOET will \nprepare  the  procurement  plan  for  equipment  and  furniture  for  CPCU  and  PPIUs  so  that \nprocurement can take place immediately upon loan effectiveness. The Government and MOET \nhave been advised that ADB's approval of advance action will not commit ADB to subsequently \napprove the Project or to finance the procurement cost. \n \n47.  There  is  one  package  of  the  consulting  services  to  be  selected  using  advance \nrecruitment action, comprising 40 person-months of international consultants and 450 person-\nmonths of domestic consultants at the estimated amount of $1.13 million (0.72 million of \ninternational consulting services and 0.41 million of domestic consulting services. General \nexpertise required areas: education quality improvements, ICT application to schools, education \nmanagement,  planning,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation,  school  mapping,  construction \nengineering and supervision, and gender and ethnic minority education. Advance action would \nbe up to evaluation of technical proposals.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n48.  Consulting services have been kept to a minimum. The Project will use consultants to \nimprove the quality support systems nationally, promote access and equity in disadvantaged \nprovinces and districts, and strengthen management of LSE. A maximum of 40 person-months \nof  international  and  450  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  will be needed. \nInternational consultants will introduce active learning-teaching methods, student assessment \nmethods, and ICT in schools (component 1); and management and planning, monitoring and \nevaluation, and school mapping (component 3). Domestic consultants will be needed in active \nlearning-teaching methods, student assessment methods, education equipment, and the use of \nICT (component 1); construction engineering and supervision (including resettlement aspects), ", "14  \nand gender and ethnic minority education (component 2); and management and planning, \nmonitoring and evaluation, school mapping, and finance and procurement (component 3). All \nADB-financed  consultants  will  be  selected  through  a  firm,  using  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  MOET,  through  the \nCPCU, will be responsible for hiring consultants. Consulting service requirements and the \noutline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 8. \n \n5.  Staff Development (Training) \n \n49.  Extensive in-country training, and combined  in-country and overseas training will be \nprovided to upgrade the skills and knowledge of qualified individuals who will be involved in \nimplementing the Project. In consultation with ADB, the CPCU will finalize criteria for selecting \nfrom among teachers, school principals, and education officers the candidates for training \nduring the first 6 months of loan effectiveness. International short-term training will focus on \nspecialized subjects related to quality improvement programs to be implemented under the \nProject.  The  Government  will  follow  the  criteria  agreed  upon  with  ADB  on  the  award  of \ninternational fellowships. The CPCU will be provided with a list of (i) the nominated candidates, \n(ii) their qualifications, (iii) nominated institutions and agencies, and (iv) detailed cost of the \nproposed courses. In-country training will be held at MOET-DOET facilities or other relevant \ntraining institutions selected from among reputable training institutions on a contractual basis. \nThe indicative staff development (training) program is in Appendix 9. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n50.  To expedite project implementation through the timely release of ADB\u2019s funds for eligible \nexpenditures, a dollar imprest account will be established by the Government at a commercial \nbank designated by the State Bank of Viet Nam and acceptable to ADB. The imprest account \nwill be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook dated 1 January 2001. The initial imprest account will have a ceiling, \nthe equivalent of $5,500,000 or estimated expenditure for the first six months of the Project. In \nview of the large number of small contracts involved, the statement of expenditures procedures \nwill be used for expenditures of $100,000 equivalent or less.  \n \n7.  Accounting and Auditing \n \n51.  MOET will maintain separate records and accounts for the Project to identify goods and \nservices financed from the loan proceeds. Project accounts, including financial statements, \nstatement  of  expenditures,  and  imprest  account  records,  will  be  audited  annually  by \nindependent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Loan \nAgreement. The auditors\u2019 report and copies of the certified accounts and related financial \nstatements, including the auditors\u2019 opinion on the use of loan proceeds, on compliance with loan \ncovenants, and on the use of the imprest account under ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures \nprocedure, will be submitted to ADB in English not later than 9 months after the close of each \nfiscal year. The independent external auditing services will be financed from the loan proceeds.  \n \n8.  Reporting \n \n52.  The CPCU will prepare quarterly reports on project implementation and submit them to \nADB within 30 days after each quarter. The provincial reports will be submitted to the CPCU and \ncompiled into a quarterly report to be submitted to MOET and ADB. The reports will be in a \nformat acceptable to ADB and will indicate, among other matters, progress made against \nestablished targets, problems encountered during the last quarter, steps taken and proposed to ", "  15\nbe taken to resolve problems, compliance with loan covenants, and proposed program of \nactivities for the succeeding quarter. Within 3 months after physical completion of the project, \nthe  CPCU  will  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  providing  details  of  project \nimplementation, accomplishments, benefits, and impact. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n53.  To monitor achievements, MOET\u2019s existing project performance management system \nwill be improved and institutionalized within MOET to monitor and evaluate implementation and \ndevelopment impact at various stages of the project cycles. Project performance monitoring will \nfocus  on  implementation  plans,  targets,  and  their  fulfillment.  Performance  evaluations  will \nexamine the impact of interventions (such as improved participation and completion rates due to \ncivil works or provision of equipment and learning materials, transition to upper secondary \neducation), problems and constraints faced, the reasons for them and their solutions. Provinces \nwill be responsible for submitting semiannual monitoring reports to the CPCU, and evaluation \nvisits and studies. Each province will conduct at least one evaluative study per year and submit \na report to the CPCU. At district and school levels, BOETs, in coordination with schools, will \nsubmit the necessary information to be established as project monitoring indicators to the PPIUs \nas required for semiannual monitoring reports and annual evaluative studies. Other evaluative \nstudies should be conducted as required if problems arise in implementation. International and \ndomestic specialists in monitoring, evaluation, and quality control will train provincial staff in \nmonitoring and evaluation techniques for use in the Project. Project performance and monitoring \nindicators are in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n \n10.  Project Review \n \n54.  ADB and the Government will jointly undertake semiannual reviews of the Project. The \nreviews will assess progress in each component, identify difficulties or constraints and help \ndetermine ways to overcome them. A report will be prepared and submitted to ADB and the \nGovernment. The CPCU and PPIU coordinators will be a primary source of information for these \nreviews. The Government and ADB will conduct midterm review in the last quarter of year 3. \nThe midterm review will inform planning for the second half of the Project. It will (i) review the \nscope, design, and project implementation arrangements; (ii) identify any necessary changes; \n(iii) assess performance against targets and benchmarks; (iv) review compliance with loan \ncovenants; and (v) recommend any changes in project design or implementation arrangements. \nThe findings will be discussed at the midterm seminar to be attended by MOET leadership and \nsenior staff, representatives of government ministries and agencies concerned, the consultants, \nand ADB.   \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.    Project Benefits \n1.    Educational and Technical Benefits \n \n55.   The educational and technical benefits are project outputs that directly or indirectly \nimpact on LSE in particular and the education system in general. The Project will help upgrade \nthe LSE subsector, and achieve the Government\u2019s goal of universalizing quality LSE by 2010. In \nparticular, the Project is expected to contribute to important long-term benefits, including (i) the \nadoption of student-centered  teaching contents and teaching methods that emphasize  the \ndevelopment of higher order thinking and life skills; (ii) periodic assessments of student learning \noutcomes that provide important feedback to teachers, textbook writers, curriculum developers, \nand school administrators at all levels; (iii) increases in the number of classrooms and facilities ", "16  \nat the lower secondary level; and (iv) improvements in decentralized education management \nthat places more decision-making responsibility on provincial and district administrators.   \n \n2.   Efficiency Benefits \n \n56.  The  Project  will  directly  improve  the  efficiency  of  LSE  in  a  number  of  concrete, \nmeasurable ways. It will increase enrollment rates at the lower secondary level by constructing \nand replacing classrooms, and at the same time providing direct support to attract and retain in \nLSE  students  from  disadvantaged  and  ethnic  minority  groups.  Low  internal  and  external \nefficiencies will be overcome through project interventions. Dropout and grade repetition rates \nwill  be  reduced  by  the  improved  instructional  environment  through  better  teacher-student \ninteraction, and high-quality textbooks and instructional materials, which in turn will increase \ninternal efficiency. The Project will increase the external efficiency of LSE. External efficiency in \neducation is usually measured by the labor market performance of school graduates. At the \nlower levels, however, the most sensible measure of external efficiency is success in moving to \nthe next higher school level. Quality improvements envisaged under the Project will result in \nhigher  overall  test  scores  and  subsequently  higher  transition  rates  to  upper  secondary \neducation.  \n \n3.  Direct Beneficiaries \n \n57.  In component 1, in-service training will cover improvement in (i) teaching methods\u2014 \napproximately 7,600 teachers, 250 principals, and 500 support staff, and 300 officers of BOETs \nand 600 officers of DOET, with upgrading courses for approximately 15,000 teachers; (ii) the \nquality of assessment of student learning\u20144,800 teachers, 2,400 principals, 1,200 supervisors, \n1,600 officers of BOETs, and 3,200 officers of DOETs; (iii) the use of ICT in schools\u201430,000 \nteachers; and (iv) vocational orientation and continuing education\u20144,500 school staff and 750 \nprincipals. In component 2, physical capacity will be expanded to accommodate about 91,000 \nadditional disadvantaged students. Support for disadvantaged and ethnic minority students will \nbe extended to about 175,000 disadvantaged students and 100,000 returning students.  About \n10,000 teachers will be upgraded to work with disadvantaged students. In component 3, direct \nbeneficiaries in FSQL will be 6,110 personnel\u20143,050 principals, 1,220 supervisors, 1,220 \nBOETs staff, 610 DOETs staff, and 10 other education officials. In-service training on planning \nand management will benefit an estimated 5,500 staff. In education and school management, \nabout 15,100 staff will be trained. Project implementation training will benefit 390 principals, \n1,040 DOETs staff and 50 other education officials. \n \nB.   Financial Sustainability Analysis \n \n58.  The financial sustainability of the Project is gauged by (i) the availability of adequate \nfunds to finance project expenditures, and (ii) the financial incentive necessary to ensure \nparticipation  in  the  Project.  The  favorable  economic  outlook  for  Viet  Nam  and  increased \nspending in education (particularly LSE) indicate that the government budget will continue to be \nthe principal source of funds for expanding LSE.19 Viet Nam\u2019s current policy of implicit subsidy \nto lower secondary schooling is rooted in the notion that education at this level is a public good \nwith high social benefits. From the medium-term budget framework, both government and party \ngoals for education call for increases in the amount of fiscal spending allocated to the sector. \nRecent and projected expenditure figures for education and training between 1995 and 2010 \nindicate that the Government has protected and increased expenditures on education. While still \n                                                 \n19  From 1992 to 1998, the government expenditure as percent of GDP grew from 1.8% to 3.5%. The Secondary \nEducation Sector Master Plan indicates that government spending on education will increase from 18% (2003) to \n20% (2010) of the total government expenditure.  ", "  17\nalarmingly high in some areas, poverty incidence at the household level is declining. Evidence \nfrom the 2002 Vietnamese household and living standard survey confirms that households are \nwilling and able to pay fees and other costs of lower secondary schooling (footnote 1). Both \nfiscal  and  private  capacity  to  pay  the  costs  of  expansion  is  expected  to  ensure  project \nsustainability. Fiscal impact analyses were conducted to determine the effect of project costs on \ngovernment budgets.  Based on the projections, the Project has minimal impact on government \nresources, both during the project period and thereafter. The financial sustainability analysis is \nin Appendix 10. \n \nC.  Economic and Poverty (Impact) Analysis \n \n59.  The economic outlook for Viet Nam continues to be favorable, as economic expansion is \ndriven by buoyant domestic demand, reflecting strong confidence and positive expectations \namong local businesses and households. To remain regionally competitive, the country needs \nto build a flexibly educated, mobile, and dynamic labor force. The Project is expected to make a \ndirect and positive contribution to economic development through improvements to the human \ncapital base of Viet Nam and to yield direct social benefits to students and their families. Since \nthere are no direct financial incentives for participants in this Project, a standard cost-benefit \nanalysis cannot be done. For the students benefited by the Project, a full financial internal rate \nof return analysis cannot be undertaken since the paucity of data on real earnings makes it \ndifficult to monetize the returns. Nevertheless, school enrollments have continued to increase, \ngiving evidence of sufficient financial incentives for households to decide in favor of enrolling \ntheir children in school. A reverse cost-benefit analysis was used to calculate the potential \nreturns on the Project. Benefits are expected from two main sources: (i) reduced costs in \nproviding lower secondary schooling, and (ii) improved productivity of the labor force. Total \nproject benefits are estimated at about $44 million per year. At a hurdle rate of 12% (real rate of \nreturn), the Project can be considered a sound investment.  Economic and poverty impact \nanalysis is in Appendix 11. \n \nD.   Environmental and Social Measures \n \n1.  Environment and Resettlement \n \n60.  A review of the Project\u2019s environmental impacts showed no significant adverse effects. \nIndividual, school-level, environmental considerations will be incorporated into all project-related \nschool construction during the implementation phase. The designs of the new schools will \nrequire minimum maintenance although maintenance programs will be specifically addressed. \nConstruction will not adversely affect the environment. Water supply for toilets and drinking will \nbe taken care of to promote good health and minimize environmental impact.  \n \n61.  Classrooms will be replaced in existing sites. New schools will be constructed on vacant \nand idle public land or commune reserve land, and mostly adjacent to existing schools. In the \nevent that no vacant public land is available and community or household land might be needed, \na detailed community decision-making process for site selection must be strictly followed to \nsafeguard the communities\u2019 interests. First, the commune will identify possible land through a \nprocess of household level consultation, including a process of grievance redress. Second, the \ndistrict people\u2019s committee will confirm that (i) the land selected has no housing or enterprises, \nno encroachers or squatters; (ii) the contribution of land by any one household is not more than \n5% of the household\u2019s total landholding; (iii) the contributors are not poor; (iv) the commune will \nguarantee to replace any lost assets at replacement cost and replace any lost income or \nlivelihoods,  and  compensation  will  be  paid  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on ", "18  \ninvoluntary resettlement;20 and (v) the people affected will agree to the arrangement verbally or \nin writing. Before the award of civil works contracts, the PPIUs will check that the procedures \nare followed and will submit a written report to ADB together with contract documentation for \nADB\u2019s endorsement. ADB review missions will make spot checks to ensure that the community \nsite selection process has been followed. The resettlement framework is in Appendix 12. \n \n             2.         Social Analysis \n \n62.  A detailed social analysis during project preparation indicated that the Project has no \nadverse social impact. The Project is classified as a poverty intervention and is expected to \nraise incomes, especially of families in the 28 selected provinces, by improving children\u2019s\u2019 \naccess to LSE. The Project will improve social conditions in the community where the project \nschools are located. Under component 2, the Project will support construction and replacement \nof  school  facilities,  including  classrooms,  toilets,  laboratories,  and  libraries  in  the  28 \ndisadvantaged provinces. This support will give LSE access to the poor, ethnic minorities, and \ngirls. Increased access to LSE is expected to have a positive impact on agricultural productivity \nand rural household income, and also to increase nonagricultural income in rural areas. In \nparticular, educating girls will not only increase their income-earning capacity, but also improve \ntheir reproductive health, reduce infant and child mortality, and benefit both current and future \ngenerations of Vietnamese households. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is \nin Appendix 13, and the ethnic minorities and gender action plan prepared in accordance with \nADB\u2019s policies on gender and development and indigenous peoples is in Appendix 14.   \n \nE.   Project Risks \n63.  The risks derive from the magnitude of the Project, involving as many as 28 provinces \nfor civil works and all provinces for quality enhancement activities. Risks are also associated \nwith the involvement of a range of implementing units from the central ministry level to provincial \nand even district levels. Mitigating factors include MOET\u2019s substantial experience in managing \nthree World Bank and four ADB-financed projects. Most CPCU members and staff will be \nreassigned from the ongoing LSEDP and many of the same people who participated in these \nprojects will have key roles in the present Project. The responsibilities of the CPCU and PPIU of \nthis project are similar to the ones under the LSEDP. Implementation will be facilitated because \nexperienced people in provincial DOETs are available to participate in the Project. Project \nimplementation manuals for all levels of responsibilities will be prepared. All project risks are \nmanageable. \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n64.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The Government will provide counterpart funds for project implementation on \ntime.  The  Government  will  make  timely  submissions  of  annual  budgetary \nappropriation requests and ensure prompt disbursement of appropriate funds \nduring each year of project implementation. \n \n(ii)  Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, the Government, through MOET, will \nconduct baseline studies and surveys to establish appropriate indicators for \nmonitoring  and  evaluating  project  implementation.  Further,  the  Government, \n                                                 \n20  ADB. 1998. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. In Handbook on Resettlement. Manila (Appendix 1).  ", "  19\nthrough MOET, will undertake periodic surveys, in the third and fifth years of \nproject implementation, to monitor relevant indicators and to revise or improve \nimplementation schemes, where necessary. \n \n(iii)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the Government, through MOET, will \nestablish a PPIU in each of the 64 provinces.  \n \n(iv)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the Government, through MOET, will \nsubmit to ADB a list of the names and location of the designated key lower \nsecondary schools in 64 provinces, including the three designated key schools \nlocated in the new provinces, and nine district ethnic minority boarding schools. \n \n(v)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the Government, through MOET, will have \nestablished and submitted to ADB for approval, criteria for selecting candidates \nfor in-country and overseas training or study tours. \n \n(vi)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the Government, through MOET, will have \nidentified the first year of school construction and replacement program as set \nout under Component 2 of the Project. \n \n(vii)  The Government, through MOET, will prepare and  submit  to  ADB  a  school \nmapping  plan,  containing  information  on  the  location  of  new  schools  to  be \nconstructed. School mapping must show that new schools will be constructed in \nareas  requiring  access  for  primary  school  graduates  from  the poor, ethnic \nminority, and disadvantaged people. School mapping must be completed at least \n6 months before construction begins.  \n \n(viii)  The Government, through MOET, will ensure that construction of new schools \nwill be carried out on vacant public land or commune reserve land. If no vacant \npublic land is available and community or household land might be needed, the \nGovernment will ensure that (a) subproject resettlement plans (RPs) will be \nprepared in accordance with the resettlement framework agreed upon between \nADB and MOET, (b) RPs will be prepared in consultation with affected people \nand disclosed to them before forwarding to ADB for approval, (c) ADB review and \napproval of subproject RPs will be a condition for award of civil works contracts, \nand (d) subprojects that entail only category B or C resettlement impacts will be \nselected. Further, in the event that community or household land will be used, the \nGovernment will ensure that compensation will be paid in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995). \n \n(ix)  The Government, through MOET, will ensure that priority will be given to gender \nand ethnic minority development through the implementation of the gender and \nethnic minorities action plan, prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policies on \nGender and Development and Indigenous Peoples. The Government, through \nMOET, will further ensure that (a) in selecting the participants for all training \nactivities, priority will be given to women to achieve their maximum participation \nin each training activity; and (b) to increase the quality of and access to LSE, \nethnic minorities will have equal opportunities to participate in training activities. \nThe impact on ethnic minorities will be observed during project monitoring and \nevaluation. \n \n(x)  Although no significant environmental impacts have been identified, site selection, \ndesign, construction, replacement work, and operation of school facilities will be ", "20  \nimplemented  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  government  regulations  and \nstandards as well as ADB\u2019s environmental policy (2002). \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness  \n65.  Before loan effectiveness, the following will have been completed:  \n \n(i)  The CPSC will have been established and its members will have been appointed.  \n \n(ii)  The CPCU will have been established and the required project manager, deputy \nproject manager, and project officers in charge of finance, procurement, civil \nworks, and monitoring and evaluation will have been appointed. \n \n(iii)  DOETs  of  the  proposed  28  disadvantaged  provinces  designated  under \nComponent 2 of the Project will submit a written commitment of their participation \nin the Project, and their commitment to provide counterpart funds to maintain the \nProject facilities.  \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n66.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 37,346,000 to the Socialist Republic of Viet \nNam for the Second Lower Secondary Education Development Project from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period \nand 1.5% per annum thereafter;

Following the reunification of Viet Nam in 1975, the different systems of education were \nstandardized by 1989 into a 16-year system with a 5-4-3-4 structure consisting of preschool with \noptional attendance; primary education with a nominal duration of 5 years, and an official entry \nage of 6 years; lower secondary education, with a duration of 4 years, followed by either upper \nsecondary education lasting for 3 years, or vocational and technical education with programs \nfrom 2 to 4 years; and higher education in either university (4\u20136 years) or college (mainly \nteacher training institutions with 2\u20133 year courses).  \n \n2.  Education is administered through a devolved system of management and funding. \nWhile the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) has major responsibility for key areas of \neducation,  other  ministries  and  local  levels  of  governments  play  significant  roles  in  the \nadministration of primary and secondary, certain vocationally oriented secondary, and higher \neducation institutions. The principal responsibilities of MOET are to (i) set policies and priorities \nwithin a broad planning framework, (ii) review plans of provincial departments of education and \ntraining (DOETs) and bureaus of education and training (BOETs), (iii) determine overall financial \ncosts, and (iv) monitor and supervise the overall education management process. At the DOET \nlevel,  principal  responsibilities  are  to  (i)  develop  provincial-level  medium-term  plans,  (ii) \nadminister upper secondary schools, and (iii) monitor and supervise the work of BOETs. At the \nBOET level, principal responsibilities are to (i) develop medium-term plans based on data \ncollected at commune and school levels, and (ii) administer primary and lower secondary \neducation. \n  \n3.  The education system has expanded rapidly over the last decade. During 1993\u20132002, \nthe net enrollment ratio (NER) for primary education increased from 86.7% in 1993 to 90.1% in \n2002; for lower secondary education, the increase was from 30.1% to 72.1% in 2002; while for \nupper secondary education, the NER rose from 7.2% to 41.8%.1 The increase in enrollment has \nbeen assisted by a marked growth in public investment in education. During 1992\u20132000, public \nspending on education as measured in constant prices increased fourfold, and education  \nalmost doubled its share of gross domestic product from 1.8% in 1992 to 3.4%. This spending \nhas been augmented by programs of official development assistance, from which education \nreceived 6.3% in 2001.2 \n \n4.  Achievements  in  lower  secondary  education  over  the  period  1991/92\u20132002/03 are \nsummarized  in  Table  A2.  Besides  the  increases  in  enrollment  rates,  other  significant \ndevelopments are as follows: (i) internal efficiency of the system improved with completion rates \nin lower secondary education increasing from 39.8% in 1991 to 69.5% in 1999, repetition rates \ndecreasing from 8.5% in 1991 to 1.1% in 2002, and dropout rates decreasing from 21.2% in \n1991 to 5.8% in 2002; (ii) the transition rate from primary education to lower secondary \neducation rose from 78% in 1991 to 95.5% in 2002; (iii) student-teacher ratios declined; (iv) the \nproportion of qualified teachers increased from 72.1% in 1991 to 90.8% in 2002; and (v) the \npercentage of female students rose to slightly more than that of male students. However, the \ntable also indicates that some principal challenges still confront lower secondary education. \nGreater efforts must be made to bring the repetition and dropout rates down from the present \n1.1%  and  5.8%,  respectively,  to  raise  the  completion  rate  to  100%,  and  further  upgrade \nteachers\u2019 qualifications since one out of 10 teachers is still unqualified.  \n                                                 \n1  Joint Donor Report to the Vietnam Consultative Group Meeting. 2003.

Specifically, more attention must be given to the poor, for whom NERs are significantly \nlower than those for the better-off households. Data from the 2002 Viet Nam Household Living \nStandards  Survey  provides  evidence  of  these  challenges,  showing  marked  differences  in \nenrollment  in  lower  secondary  education  due  to  income,  ethnic  origin, and urban or rural \ndimension. Differences in the NER by household income level are marked: in 2002, 53.8% of \nthe poorest quintile and 85.8% of the richest quintile were enrolled in lower secondary education. \nWhile Kinh and Chinese had a NER of 75.9%, the NER of ethnic minorities was 48.0%. For the \nurban population, the lower secondary NER was 80.8%, compared with the 69.9% for the rural \npopulation (footnote 2). \n \n6.  MOET has placed a high priority on improving the quality of education, as evidenced by \nits investments in the Lower Secondary Education Development Project3 with emphasis on \ncurriculum and textbook development, and related teacher in-service training, and in the Lower \nSecondary Education Teacher Training Project.4 The greatest challenges in improving quality lie \nin (i) in-service training of unqualified teachers and removing from teaching unqualified teachers \nwho are not suitable for upgrading; (ii) ensuring all students are provided with the full curriculum \nby providing an adequate supply of subject teachers for all schools, especially for music, \nphysical education, foreign languages, and arts and crafts; (iii) ensuring that all students have \nthe full number of class contact hours per week or year; and (iv) improving the teaching and \nlearning facilities in schools: libraries, laboratories, and computer rooms.  \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1997.

Two aspects of financial sustainability are relevant to the Project: (i) availability of \nadequate funds to finance project expenditures, especially funds drawn from the government \nbudget; and (ii) the financial incentive necessary to ensure participation in the Project.  \n \nA.  Availability of Adequate Funds \n \n2.  The economic outlook for Viet Nam continues to be favorable, even as the external \ncontext remains somewhat uncertain. Real gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to grow \nby around 7% in 2004 and 7.5% in 2005 (Asian Development Outlook 2004). The sustained \neconomic expansion is driven by buoyant domestic demand, reflecting strong confidence and \npositive  expectations  among  local  businesses  and  households.  Overall,  the Government\u2019s \neconomic reforms underpin the positive developments. Consumer price inflation has moved to \nabout 3%, with non-food inflation having the greatest impact. Viet Nam is increasingly an open \neconomy with the price of its internationally tradable goods mainly determined in world markets. \nWith a stable nominal exchange rate, Viet Nam is currently one of the cheapest countries in the \nworld in dollar terms. These different perspectives have positive implications for government \nrevenues over the life of the proposed Project.  \n \nB.  Government Funding for Education \n \n3.  Government spending on education at all levels, both in absolute terms and as a \npercentage of overall government allocation, has significantly increased since the 1990s. This \nincrease has had a direct impact on access and participation levels. Table A10.1 shows trends \nin Government and non-government expenditures for the education sector as a whole between \n1992 and 1998. The trends indicate that household and government expenditures are roughly \nequal. This confirms that households are willing and able to pay fees and other costs of \nschooling.   \n \nTable A10.1: Trends in Government and Nongovernment Expenditure \n    on Education between 1992 and 1998 \n \nItem  1992  1993  1994  1995  1996  1997  1998 \nGovernment               \nPer capita expenditure ($\u2018000) in  39.2  58.1  71.3  82.8  80.4  100.0   115.0 \nconstant 1994 prices \nPercent of GDP    1.8    2.6     2.9     3.0     2.7       3.2       3.5 \nHousehold               \nPer capita expenditure ($\u2018000) in      32.7            108.4 \nconstant 1994 prices \nPercent of GDP     1.7              3.4 \nGDP = gross domestic product \nSources: Second Lower Secondary Education Development Project (SLSEDP) calculations. \n \n4.  Despite the increasing percentage of individual households, income spent on education,  \nlower secondary education (LSE) in Viet Nam is now financed for the most part by a direct \ngovernment budget. Under the Project, it is proposed that communities and parents finance \nabout 12% of the total project cost, mainly in cash contribution toward the purchase of textbooks \nand in kind contribution toward operation and maintenance of project facilities. This extent is \ncomparable with that in the Lower Secondary Education Development Project (LSEDP), where \ncommunities provided $9.5 million, or 13% of the project cost.   \n \n5.  Table  A10.2  presents  calculations  of  (average)  unit  fiscal  costs  per  student  for  \nacademic year 2000/01 for both lower and upper secondary education. The trends indicate the \ngrowing fiscal effort at the LSE level. Contrary to typical patterns, the unit (fiscal only) cost at the \nupper secondary level in Viet Nam is below the unit cost of lower secondary students. This ", "  Appendix 10  41 \nreversal is evidence of the priority accorded by the government to LSE, through reallocation of \nthe subsidy from upper secondary education to LSE. \n \nTable A10.2: Average Fiscal Costs per Student-Year, 1993\u20132000 \n \nItem  1993  1994  1998  2000 \nLower Secondary         \n     D(\u2018000)  169   235   337   448 \n     $  15.9  21.5  27.4  30.7 \nUpper Secondary         \n     D(\u2018000)  429   483   448   442 \n     $  40.5   44.1  36.4  30.4 \nSource: World Bank. 1997.

The government budget will be the principal source of funds to meet investment and \noperating expenditures. Policy supports this funding shift, coupled with the imposition of cost \nrecovery at higher levels of education. Shares to education in all government spending have \nsteadily risen in the past decade. Shortfalls in the government\u2019s ability to finance school \nexpansion and quality improvement in Viet Nam are met through efficiency improvements and \nfrom borrowing. As Viet Nam has a long history of borrowing for education, this action is not \nexpected to have an adverse effect on the poor through the added tax burden. Government \nrevenue for loan repayment is raised primarily through economic growth that now enjoys an \nenviable record. In fact, cost recovery through tuition and related user fees have slowly been \neliminated  as  they  have  been  shown  to  have  a  negative  impact  on  enrollment  growth, \nparticularly among the poor. The Government has decided to set school fees and other charges \nso that the full costs of supply of LSE are not completely met by students or their families. \nDespite this policy, recent evidence from the Vietnamese Household and Living Standards \nSurvey shows that poor households pay a larger share of income for education than do the rich, \nand considerable attention must be given to the matter of price inelasticity of demand for LSE. \nThis current policy of implicit subsidy to LSE is rooted in the notion that education at this level is \na public good with high social benefits.    \n \nC.  Fiscal Adequacy \n \n7.  A financial plan in the form of a cost table showing fiscal impact has been prepared. It \ngives details of expenditure categories and funding sources necessary to ensure the availability \nof adequate monies to finance expenditures. The plan applies to the entire implementation \nperiod to ensure that funds cover both capital and recurrent expenditures over the entire \noperating  period  of  the  loan  are  available.  Education  projects  are  considered  indirectly \nproductive and do not generate sufficient funds to cover operating expenditures. The full fiscal \nimpact of the Project for each year of its life is summarized in Table A10.3. The financial \nrequirement is a government (fiscal) requirement, and the usual steps have been taken to \nensure  that  the  government  is  fully  committed  to  provide  adequate  funds  for  operational \npurposes. \n  \n8.  Table A10.3 shows the project recurrent costs as a percentage of total estimated public \nfunds for the education sector and LSE subsector over the period 2005\u20132015. The allocation is \nbased on the assumptions that the GDP will continue to grow with the relatively high real growth \nof 7.5%, the share of public expenditure in the GDP will remain at 22%, and the share to \neducation will increase significantly to 20% (from 15.6% in 2002). While financial resources in ", "42  Appendix 10 \ngeneral and for education for all (EFA) will steadily increase 1, it is projected that funding gaps \nare likely to occur every year until 2015. EFA funding, projected to comprise 64%, 15%, and \n10%, will come from public sources, aid funding, and community contributions, respectively; the \nbalance is the funding gap. The Project is estimated to cost about 0.16% (2005), increasing to \n1.32% (2007), and 0.5% (2010) of the funds available for the education sector. The project \ninvestment is estimated to be about 0.13% of the available public funds for the education sector \nin 2005, increasing to 1.14% in 2007, and decreasing to 0.48% in the last project year. Likewise, \nthe project recurrent costs are minimal as they represent only about 0.016% to 0.05% of the \nprojected LSE subsector fund requirements in 2005\u20132010. \n \nTable A10.3: Macroeconomic Framework for Education Financing \n($ million, in constant 2001/02 prices) \n \n                     \nItem  1999  2000  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  2015 \nGDP ($ million)  26,662  29,443  49,189  43,319  46,693  50,329  54,249  58,747  63,029  91,706 \nEduc.

First, the main \nsources of finance (excluding official development assistance) are government (fiscal) and \nprivate  (household).  Government  commitment  to  the  education  sector  is  firm  and  has \ncontinuously grown in the last decade, thus lending considerable empirical weight to projected \nfiscal requirements. From the medium-term budget framework, both the Government and party \ngoals for education call for increases in the amount of fiscal spending allocated to the education \nsector.  The  strategy  of  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  Training  explicitly  requires  the \nimplementation and continuation of programs designed to achieve universal access to primary \neducation  as  a  necessary  condition  for  the  concomitant  objective  of  achieving  universal \ncoverage at the lower secondary level by the year 2010. Evidence of government commitment \nat the primary level can be found in the adoption of education for all goals in government \nplanning.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  record  economic  growth  and  expanding  markets  augur  well  for  the \ngovernment ability to meet its budgetary commitments.    \n                                                 \n1   Education for All (EFA) 2004\u20132015, Ministry of Education and Training. Viet Nam is one of the 18 countries eligible \nfor financial support from the Education for All (Fast Track Initiative), which stems from the Dakar Conference on \nEFA. ", "  Appendix 10  43 \n \n10.  Poverty incidence at the household level, while still alarmingly high in some areas, is \nrapidly declining. Although the poor have not enjoyed the same access as the rich, evidence \nfrom the 2002 household survey confirms that households are willing and able to pay fees2 and \nother costs of lower schooling. Economic growth has cut unemployment and raised household \nliving standards, hence ensuring both fiscal  and private capacity to pay the costs of LSE \nexpansion. A legitimate government concern is that the resources be used efficiently so as to \nachieve the highest quality of education at all levels and that a higher share of total spending be \ndirected  at  the  underserved  minority  and  poor  populations.  The  government\u2019s  education \nstrategy, supported directly by the Project, includes measures to address these issues. Figure \nA10 shows recent and projected expenditure figures for education and training between 1995 \nand  2010,  corresponding  to  the  short  and  medium  term.  As  indicated  in  the  figure,  the \nGovernment has increased expenditures on education. \n     \n \nFigure A10: Education and Training Budget \n \n40\nes 35 34\nric 31 32\nP\n000  30 26 27\nnt 2 25 22 24\na\nst 20 19\nn 17 17\no 16\nC\nn  15 13 13 14\nn) I\no 10 8\nrilli 7\nD (t 5\n0\n1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010\nBudget Year\nSource: Government Statistics Office. \n                                                 \n2  Based on Vietnamese Living Standards Measurement Survey 2002, household expenditures in education are \nabout 2.9% of total expenditures. (Appendix 11 \u2013 Economic and Poverty (Impact) Analysis, Table A11.2) ", "44   Appendix 11 \nECONOMIC AND POVERTY IMPACT ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Macroeconomic Context \n \n1.  Estimates  from  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  the  World  Bank,  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank place economic growth in 2002\u20132004 at around 7% per annum in Viet Nam. \nGrowth continues to be robust and forecasts a similar optimistic prognosis largely based on the \nGovernment policy of continuing toward market reforms. Export earnings are strong, service \nsector growth is higher than projected, industry and agriculture are performing at or above \ntargets, and domestic consumption and investment are at their highest historical levels. Major \nstructural and macroeconomic reforms undertaken include trade liberalization; private sector \ndevelopment; public expenditure management; fiscal prudence; banking and enterprise reform; \nand public administration, legal and governance system modernization. The impact of the \naccelerated reform momentum is exhibited in the boost to the private sector, declining poverty \nlevels, declining debt, subdued inflation, and modest fiscal deficits. The reform program is \nfocused on accelerating Viet Nam\u2019s transition to a market economy, as well as disciplined \nmacroeconomic management. Top priorities continue to be placed on boosting investment and \nimproving competitiveness, further opening the economy to the private sector, closer integration \ninto the global markets, and state enterprise reforms. \n \n2.  Expansion  of  education  in  Viet  Nam  has  been  very  impressive.  Enrollment  has \nincreased steadily nationwide and has been characterized by equal access for boys and girls. \nHowever, the challenge of getting the last group of children into school is quite significant, given \nthat these children come from poor and remote areas. Improving the quality of teaching and \nlearning for these pupils is necessary to build a strong foundation for universal lower secondary \neducation (LSE), targeted for 2010. Clearly, wage employment is the future and is a direct \ncorrelate  of  high  investments  in  formal  education.  The  Project  is  focused  on  improving \neducation attainment across the 64 provinces of the country. It will invest in new assets to raise \nthe quality of schooling and to distribute it more evenly throughout the national population. \nEfficiency in LSE will be improved by strengthening management at the district and school \nlevels.   \n \nB.        Economic Analysis \n \n1.  Economic Rationale  \n \n3.  Public and private investments in all levels of education in Viet Nam have been high, as \nevidenced by the expansion of school places and increased participation. Between 1993 and \n2002, enrollment increased by 3.9% at the primary level, by 140% in LSE, and by 480% in \nupper  secondary.  Despite  these  achievements,  internal  efficiency  remains  low,  with  high \ndropout and class repetition rates in some regions of the country.1 Poor quality is shown in \ninsufficient school hours, underqualified teachers, insufficient instructional materials, and limited \nphysical  and  support  infrastructure.  Access,  especially  by  the  poor  and  ethnic  minorities, \nremains a problem. Decentralization revealed significant differences in management capacity \namong  provinces,  districts  and  schools.  Capacity  is  weak  in  core  competencies  such  as \nplanning,  budget  allocation,  and  delivery  of  in-service  training  and  other  teacher  support \nservices. To turn Viet Nam\u2019s decade-long history of economic growth into genuine poverty \nreduction, the assets of the country\u2019s poor must be augmented and human capital more equally \ndistributed. This objective can be achieved either by investing in new assets, specifically, LSE, \nor by redistributing existing assets. By 2010, the Government aims to achieve universal LSE at \nhigher  levels  of  quality.  The  Project  will  support  quality improvements through continuing \n                                                 \n1  In 2000, retention (71%) and completion rates (70.2%) were still low. This is inefficient and has prolonged the \naverage time that the system takes to produce one graduate to more than 6 years, for a 5-year cycle of primary \nschooling. ", "  Appendix 11  45 \ncurriculum  reforms,  retraining  teachers  in  modern  instructional  methods,  and  systematic \nmeasurement of learning outcomes. Resources will be directed to the poorest districts of 28 \ncarefully  selected  provinces,  with  poor  and  ethnic  minority  children  specifically  targeted. \nInstitutional capacity for providing LSE will be strengthened at provincial, district, and commune \nlevels. Expanding the coverage and quality of education and reducing the costs for the poor are \nnecessary to prevent inequalities from widening excessively.   \n \n2.  Demand Analysis \n \n4.  Viet Nam experienced rapid expansion of lower and upper secondary education over the \nlast decade. In 1992\u20132000, the gross enrollment ratio for LSE increased from 44% to over 80% \n(Table A11.1). Expanded enrollment was accompanied by marked improvements in internal \nefficiency, as completion rates rose from 39.8% to 69.5% (secondary education sector master \nplan  [SESMP], 2001). In view of Government plans to expand primary, lower, and upper \nsecondary enrollment by 2010, significant public (and private) resources will be required at all \nlevels. \n \nTable A11.1: Lower Secondary Education Enrollment and Gross Enrollment Rate \n \n       \nYear  LSE Student  Annual   Gross Enrollment Rate  \nEnrollment  Growth Rate (%) \n       \n1992/93  2,708,067  \u2014  \u2014 \n1993/94  3,178,348  17.4  44 \n1994/95  3,679,104  15.8  51 \n1995/96  4,312,674  10.7  58 \n1996/97  4,945,452  14.7  66 \n1997/98  5,254,419  6.2  70 \n1998/99  5,577,307  6.1  75 \n1999/2000  5,768,843  3.4  78 \n2000/01  5,918,153  2.6  80 \n2001/02  6,254,254  5.7  83 \n2002/03  6,497,548  4.0  94 \nAverage Growth Rate  8.9 % \nLSE = lower secondary education, \u2014 = not available. \nSource: secondary education sector master plan, 2001. \n \n5.  Demand  for  schooling  is  difficult  to  establish  using  traditional  methods.  Cultural, \nhistorical, and enrollment expansion data all combine to suggest that the social demand for \nschooling in Viet Nam is comparatively high. This is manifested in the quest for improved \nlearning achievement through supplemental classes, often taught by regular schoolteachers \nfrom  their  homes,  the  schools  themselves,  or  at  commercial  spaces.  The  recent  2002 \nhousehold living standards survey confirms that households at all income quintiles pay for extra \nclasses where available. These extra classes in turn are thought to lead to higher entrance \nexam scores and hence improved probability of continuation up the school ladder. Table A11.2 \ndemonstrates  the  extent  to  which  the  direct  costs  of  education  remain  significant  among \nhousehold expenditures. The extra classes component is an important part of total spending.  \nThe burden carried by individual households for the schooling of their children, as measured by \nthe percentage of total household spending devoted to education, is more or less equally \nshared by all income groups except for those in the richest quintile, who pay slightly more.  But \nequally significant is the fact that the poor spend a lot less for extra classes than do the rich. If \nthese classes play a significant role in determining achievement outcomes, then children of poor \nfamilies receive a lot less of the most fundamental component of school quality than do the \nchildren of economically advantaged families. \n ", "46   Appendix 11 \nTable A11.2: Household Expenditures in Lower Secondary Education in 2002 \n \n     \nLower  D\u2019000 per year  Percent of \nSecondary  Household \nFee  Contribution  Uniform  Textbooks  School  Extra  Others  Total \nEducation  Expenditure \n    Tools  Class \nPoorest  30.7  51.3  28.3  49.0  40.4  15.5  9.1  225.7  2.9 \nNear Poor  45.9  56.4  39.1  56.3  49.3  28.9  16.0  293.2  2.9 \nMiddle  55.0  60.5  44.5  62.7  54.7  45.6  18.0  343.1  2.7 \nNear Rich  70.0  68.8  60.7  70.1  63.3  89.9  31.0  457.5  2.7 \nRichest  180.1  103.3  100.8  90.6  79.3  425.7  89.4  1,076.0  3.1 \nViet Nam  72.2  66.7  53.1  65.0  56.8  107.5  30.3  454.8  2.9 \nSource: Based on 2002 Viet Nam Living Standards Measurement Survey from Government Statistics Office. \n \n6.  An additional and widely accepted method for estimating unmet demand in economic \nanalysis is through the use of the national leaving examination. In this case, examination \nperformance itself is not the useful indicator, but rather the number of students who take the \nexamination. This number is a proxy for demand at the next higher level, as it can reasonably \nbe  assumed  that  taking  the  exam  is  an  indication  of  students\u2019  aspiration  for  subsequent \neducation experience. The number of takers of leaving exams is then compared with the initial \nintake of LSE. Examination of the relevant data from  the Ministry of Education and Training \nappears to confirm that, using this method, there is substantial unmet demand for LSE in every \nprovince of the country. This finding is not surprising especially in light of the rapid expansion of \ncoverage at this level of schooling over the past decade.   \n   \n3.  Cost-Benefit Analysis \n \n7.     In  Viet  Nam,  there  is  still  a  sizable  government  sector  where  price  distortions  are \ncommonplace. Labor market distortions found in public sector employment lead to artificially low \nrate-of-return estimates, which create disincentives for investing in education. Since urban \nwages are still an unreliable proxy for labor productivity, rate-of-return calculations based on \nsuch data should not be used in Viet Nam as an infallible guide to investment priorities in \neducation. Differences across regions and provinces in wage levels and wage growth also \ncomplicate the calculation and analyses of cost-benefit ratios. Decisions concerning LSE in Viet \nNam should look beyond the absence of fully reliable rate-of-return data and consider that equal \naccess  to  education  is  among  the  basic  human  rights  to  which  everyone  is  entitled.    In \ncalculating the benefits from education projects, a reverse procedure is often employed in the \nabsence of valid and reliable information on earnings differentials due to schooling. This type of \nanalysis is often described as \u201creverse cost-benefit analysis\u201d and consists of estimating the cost \nsavings and productivity gains required for an education investment to have an acceptable rate \nof return.   \n \n8.  This Project has few, if any, quantifiable objectives for which future monetary benefits \ncan  be  estimated.2  The  Project  employs  interrelated  components  and  sub-components  to \nimprove the quality of LSE and extend it to underserved populations. The approach used in the \neconomic analysis follows that used in the secondary education sector master plan3 and the \nUpper Secondary Education Development Project.4 This is a lower-bound estimate based on \n                                                 \n2  It should be noted that for basic education, including lower secondary education, cost-benefits are quantified (i.e., \ncalculation of the rate of return) mainly because the provision of basic education is considered as a public good. \nAlternatively, the \u201creverse cost-benefit analysis\u201d has been conducted to confirm the project benefits,  using the \nmethodology established in ADB. 2002.

Benefits will be \nderived from two main sources: (i) reduced costs in providing LSE, and (ii) improved productivity \nof the labor force. Total project benefits are estimated at about $44 million per year (Table \nA11.3). With a minimum benchmark of 12% (real rate of return), the Project can be considered a \nsound investment. Reduced operating costs are assumed to result from improved management \nand financial allocation mechanisms and greater internal operating efficiency in lower secondary \nschools, leading to more lower secondary school graduates with higher earnings as they \nbecome better qualified. These benefits notably do not include externalities such as improved \nhealth, better nutritional practice, and lower fertility rates, among others.   \n \nTable A11.3: Calculation of Reverse Cost-Benefit Analysis \n \n  Expected Annual Benefits   Expected Annual Benefits  \nYear  from Reduced Costs  from Productivity Differentials \n        \nD billion  $ million  D billion  $ million \n1  15  0.97  555  35.7 \n2  18  1.17  574  37.2 \n3  20  1.29  599  38.8 \n4  23  1.49  642  41.5 \n5  27  1.75  671  43.4 \n6  31  2.01  666  43.1 \n7  36  2.33  644  41.7 \n8  41  2.65  644  41.7 \n9  47  3.04  644  41.7 \n10  54  3.50  644  41.7 \n11  62  4.01  644  41.7 \n12  72  4.66  644  41.7 \n13  83  5.37  644  41.7 \n14  95  6.15  644  41.7 \n15  108  6.99  644  41.7 \n15 Year Total  732  47.38  9,498  614.8 \n15 Year Ave  48.8  3.16  633  40.9 \nSources : Base data on number of graduates from MOET: Differential earnings from VNLSMS. 2002. \n \n9.  Productivity differentials are computed based on the number of projected graduates by \nsecondary education sector master plan multiplied by the differential earnings from the mean \nand  median  average  income (Table A11.4). From the Vietnamese Living Standard Survey \n1997\u20131998, the median average for the seven regions with educational attainment of less than \nprimary diploma and lower secondary diploma was 70% of the population. The difference \nbetween the median and mean income is the productivity differential of the upper secondary \neducation graduates under the Project, assuming 76% completion rate. It is assumed that about \n40% of the graduates will benefit from the productivity differential. \n \nTable A11.4: Base Data \n \n   Annual Income Per Capita   \nIncome Level  D\u2019000  $   \nMean Income   3,389  226   \nMedian Income   2,395  160   \nProductivity Differential  995  66   \nSources: Viet Nam Government, 1998.

Productivity  differentials  were  computed  based  on  the  number  of  projected  LSE \ngraduates from the SESMP multiplied by the differential earnings from the mean and median \naverage income from the Vietnamese living standard survey, 1997\u20131998. The survey shows the ", "48   Appendix 11   \ndifference between the median and mean incomes for the national population, which figure was \ntaken as the productivity differential of LSE graduates under the Project. Completion rates are \nthose from the SESMP and it is assumed that about 40% (largely urban wage earners) will \nbenefit from the productivity differential. Reduced costs are the yearly savings expected as a \nresult  of  strengthening  management  of  LSE.  The  Project  is  expected  to  improve  cost-\neffectiveness (where the production of an LSE graduate is the measure of effect) by improving \nthe utilization of schools, reducing the distance between new schools, improving quality of \ninstruction, and thereby reducing dropout and repetition rates. Expected cost savings are \nassumed to be about 1% of annual recurrent costs of LSE. \n \n4.  Cost-Effectiveness and Efficiency Analysis \n \n11.  A key element of system efficiency is spending per student or unit cost. Research done \nby the SESMP determined that the fiscal (government spending) cost per LSE student in \n2000/01 was D264,000. Unit costs rise inversely with enrollment ratios. The reason is that both \ncapital and recurrent expenditures are higher in remote and difficult districts and communes. In \nsome  instances,  teachers  are  given  incentives  if  they  serve  in  rural  and  remote  areas. \nConstruction costs are higher in such areas than in urban centers. Public expenditure at the \nLSE level is less than the actual unit cost, implying the existence of costs borne by individual \nhouseholds. The Project supports the adoption of government policy abolishing fees at the LSE. \nThe Government has tried to hold constant or reduce the practice of cost recovery at the \nprimary and lower secondary levels for the poor and very few poor and minority families. It is \nalso helping the disadvantaged students by subsidizing out-of-pocket costs that constrain the \nattainment of universal coverage.      \n \n5.  Beneficiaries \n \n12.  Direct project beneficiaries are included about 367,000 students: approximately 267,000 \ndisadvantaged students and 100,000 returning students in LSE. Teachers and administrators \ninclude  approximately  57,000  teachers,  3,400  principals,  5,000  other  school  staff,  1,200 \nsupervisors, 1,900 staff of bureaus of education and training (BOETs), 3,800 staff of provincial \ndepartments of education and training (DOETs), and 50 other education officials. In component \n1, in-service training will cover improvement in (i) teaching methods: approximately 7,400 \nteachers, 250 principals, and 500 support staff, and 300 officers of BOETs and 600 officers of \nDOET, with upgrading courses for approximately 15,000 teachers; (ii) the quality of assessment \nof  student  learning:  4,800  teachers,  2,400  principals,  1,200  supervisors,  1,600  officers  of \nBOETs and 3,200 officers of DOETs; (iii) the use of information and communication technology \nin schools: 30,000 teachers; (iv) vocational orientation and continuing education: 4,500 school \nstaff and 750 principals. Overall, 4 million students and 72,500 teachers and other officials are \nexpected to benefit from project interventions under this component. In component 2, physical \ncapacity will be expanded to accommodate approximately 90,720 additional disadvantaged \nstudents.  Support  for  disadvantaged  and  ethnic  minority  students  will  be  extended  to \napproximately 175,000 disadvantaged students and 100,000 returning students. Approximately \n10,000 teachers will be upgraded to work with disadvantaged students. In component 3, direct \nbeneficiaries in fundamental school quality level include 6,110 persons: 3,050 principals, 1,220 \nsupervisors, 1,220 staff of BOETs, 610 staff of DOETs, and 10 other education officials. In-\nservice training on planning and management will benefit an estimated 5,536 staff (1,100 staff of \nBOETs, 4,400 staff of DOETs, and 36 other education officials).  In education and school \nmanagement, about 15,100 staff will be trained.  Project implementation training will benefit 390 \nprincipals, 1,041 staff of DOETs, and 50 other education officials. \n \nC.  Poverty Impact and Equity Analysis  \n \n13.  Equal access to education services is among the basic human rights to which the \nGovernment of Viet Nam is fully committed. Equitable distribution of human capital is important ", "  A ppendix 11      49 \nfor broad-based growth and poverty reduction. Moreover, equitable distribution of opportunities \nis preferable to the redistribution of existing assets, which is politically difficult. Recent research \non the effect of initial asset distribution on growth and poverty reduction has found a significant \ncorrelation  between  initial  education  inequality  and  reduced  income  growth.  Education \nresearchers have found ways to construct education Gini coefficients, which are similar to the \nGini coefficients widely used to measure distribution of income and land.5 Gini coefficients have \noften been calculated in the past using poverty data. In the Project, baseline data on education \ninequality in Viet Nam was used in determining priority groupings. Table A11.5 summarizes the \neducation Gini coefficients for three groups based on 1999 census data.6 Data are grouped by \ninclusion priority and by province within priority groups. The table reveals that priority group 1 \nhas higher average inequality than do the provinces in  priority group 2, and priority group 2 \nprovinces exhibit on average higher inequality than those in priority group 3. It is also clear that \neven priority group 3 does not match Viet Nam\u2019s overall Gini coefficient of 0.2375. The selection \nof provinces hence meets the criterion of exhibiting the most inequality in education.  \n \nTable A11.5: Education Gini Coefficients for Targeted Priority Provincial Groups  \nin Viet Nam  \n \n     \nPriority Group 1  Priority Group 2        Priority Group 3 \n   \nHa Giang                         0  . 3   6  8  6            L  a  n  g    S  o  n                             0  . 3  0   4  1            P  h  u    T  h  o                                   0  . 2  8  6  1               \n           \nLai Chau/Dien Bien         0  .  3  4  9  6          Kon Tum                       0  .3259  Tay Ninh                  0.2858 \n           \nLao Cai                            0  . 3   2  9  8           S   o  n    L  a                                                      0   .  3     2    9    0                       N     g    h    e       A     n                                                                                          0      .   2      9      9      0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n           \nCao Bang                        0  .  3  4  0  2            B  a  c    C   a  n                                                 0    .  3    1    0    3                       B    i  n    h       T    h    u     a    n                                                                            0       .    3      0      8      7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n           \nBinh Phuoc                      0  . 3  0  8  7            P   h  u    Y  e  n                                                 0     .  2    9    5    6                       B    i  n    h       D      i  n    h                                                                                    0      .   3      0       9       3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n           \nTra Vinh                           0  . 2  9  6  0            L  a  m     D   o  n  g                                           0    .  3    0     8    5                      Q      u    a    n    g       N      a    m                                                                           0      .   2       8      7      3                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n           \nGia Lai                             0  . 3  1  9  6            T  u  y  e  n    Q   u  a  n  g                                  0    .  3    0    5    1                       V    i  n    h       P      h    u    c                                                                            0    .  2    8    4    9                                                                                                                                        \n           \nDak Lak/Dak Nong          0  . 3  1  6  4            Y   e  n    B  a  i                                                   0    .  3    0    4    8                       H      a       T    i  n    h                                                                    0    .  2     9    8    1                                                       \n           \nNinh Thuan                      0  . 3  1  5  9            H   o  a    B  i n  h                                          0  . 2  9  8  8                                         \n           \nGroup 1 mean  0.3272  Group 2 mean  0.3091  Group 3 mean  0.2949 \nSource: Holsinger, Donald B.

", " 50 Appendix 12 \nRESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n \nA.  Project Background \n1.  The expansion and upgrading of school facilities (component 2) will consist of replacing \nclassrooms or constructing new ones in the 28 targeted provinces.1 Civil works, together with \nequipment, furniture, and sanitary facilities, will comprise construction and replacement of 3,186 \nrooms:  247  schools  with  1,482  classrooms  equivalent,  247  libraries,  247  Information  and \nCommunication Technology/computer rooms,  247 laboratories, 960 boarding rooms, and 3 \nmulti-functioned rooms. All the newly built schools will provide accommodation and board to \nteachers and students.  \n \n2.  The 28 provinces are divided into three priority groups in accordance with level of \ndisadvantage.  The  first  priority  group  comprises  11  disadvantaged  provinces  with  highest \ninequality in access:  Binh Phuoc, Cao Bang, Dak Lak, Dak Nong, Dien Bien, Gia Lai, Ha Giang, \nLai Chau, Lao Cai, Ninh Thuan and Tra Vinh. The second priority group comprises nine \ndisadvantaged provinces with inequality in access: Bac Can, Hoa Binh; Kon Tum, Lam Dong, \nLang Son, Phu Yen, Son La, Tuyen Quang, and Yen Bai. The third priority group comprise eight \ndisadvantaged provinces with inequality in access: Binh Dinh, Binh Thuan, Ha Tinh, Nghe An, \nPhu Tho, Quang Nam, Tay Ninh, and Vinh Phuc.  \n \n3.  All proposed subprojects will fall under either Category B (not significant impacts)2 or \nCategory C (no resettlement impacts). As part of the project selection criteria, an area proposed \nfor school extension or construction of new schools that may entail significant impacts or land \nacquisition from ethnic minorities will not be included.   \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Entitlements \n4.  The resettlement framework aims to ensure that screening, planning, and management \nprocedures  for  involuntary  resettlement  on  all  subprojects  will  comply  with  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and other ADB social safeguard \npolicies.  The  resettlement  policy  framework  for  the  Project  is  based  on  the  laws  of  the \nGovernment of Viet Nam, ADB\u2019s  Policy on Involuntary Resettlement  (1995), Handbook on \nResettlement: A Guide to Good Practice, and Operational Manual F2.   \n \n5.  This Project will be bound by the principles and conditions stated in the resettlement \nframework that will be approved by ADB and the Government. If there is any conflict between \nADB and Government policy, ADB policy will prevail. The principles and objectives are to \nensure that all affected people (AP) will be compensated for their losses at replacement cost \nand will be assisted to improve, or at least maintain, their pre-Project living standards and \nincome-earning capacity. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                 \n1  The 28 provinces are selected and prioritized on the basis of indicators related to socioeconomic development, \neducation development, social equity, and coverage by other projects. It should be noted that the final Government \ndecision on the selected provinces is subject to the Government\u2019s further appraisal and approving process.  \n2  Not significant impacts \u2013 means less than 200 people are displaced from houses or less than 200 people lose less \nthan 10% of their productive, income-generating assets. A short resettlement plan will be required for each \nCategory B subproject. ", "  Appendix 12  51 \n1.  Principles of Resettlement \n6.  The following basic principles have been adopted for the Project: \n \n(i)  Avoid or minimize land acquisition and involuntary resettlement by identifying \npossible  alternative  project  designs  and  appropriate  social,  economic, \noperational and engineering solutions. \n(ii)  The cutoff date for compensation eligibility will be the date when the census and \ninventory of losses survey per subproject is completed.  \n(iii)  Joint  detailed  measurement  survey,  baseline  socioeconomic  survey,  and  a \nreplacement cost study survey will be carried out for all subprojects after detailed \ndesign is completed. The results of the replacement cost survey will be applied \nby the provincial people\u2019s committee (PPC) for various types of losses.  The \nestablished unit rates will be updated regularly to ensure that the current market \nrates at the time of compensation are reflected. \n(iv)  All APs will be compensated for loss of land and other assets at replacement \ncost. Compensating at replacement cost means valuing the assets to replace the \nloss at market value, or its nearest equivalent, plus any transaction costs such as \nadministrative charges, taxation, registration, and titling costs.   \n(v)  All AP will be equally eligible for compensation, irrespective of tenure status, \nsocial or economic standing, and any such factors that may discriminate against \nachieving the objectives outlined above. \n(vi)  Preparation of the subproject resettlement plans (RPs), as part of subproject \npreparation,  and  their  implementation  are  to  be  carried  out  with  the  full \nparticipation of the AP.   \n(vii)  Adequate budgetary support will be fully committed and be made available to \ncover the costs of land acquisition, resettlement, and rehabilitation within the \nagreed-upon implementation period.  \n(viii)  The Executing Agency will ensure that institutional arrangements are in place for \neffective and timely planning and implementation of the RPs. \n(ix)  There will be effective mechanisms for hearing and resolving grievances during \nimplementation of the subproject RPs.  \n(x)  ADB will not approve any civil works contract for any subproject to be financed \nfrom the loan proceeds unless the Government has satisfactorily completed the \napproved RP for that subproject.  \n(xi)  Subproject RPs will be translated into the local language and translations placed \nin project and commune offices for the reference of AP as well as any interested \ngroups.   \n(xii)  Appropriate reporting, monitoring, and evaluation mechanisms will be identified \nand set in place as part of the resettlement management system.  \n \n2.  Eligibility Criteria \n7.  Affected persons are defined as those who, at the cutoff date, would have their (i) \nstandard  of  living  adversely  affected;  (ii)  right,  title,  or  interest  in  any   land (residential, \nagricultural, forest, and grazing land) or any other fixed or movable asset acquired or possessed \nadversely affected, in full or in part, permanently or temporarily; or (iii) business, occupation, \nwork, place of residence, or habitat adversely affected, with or without displacement. Persons \nwho encroach into the area after the cutoff date are not entitled to compensation or any other \nform of resettlement assistance. However, persons who have land and other assets lost legally \ndue to land acquisition caused by the Project, but are identified after the cutoff date because of \n   ", " 52 Appendix 12 \nthe  change  in  or  delayed  availability  of  detailed  technical  designs,  will  be  eligible  to  full \nentitlements provided by the subproject RP, equal to those of the entitled AP listed in the \ncensus survey. \n \n8.  Persons affected by the Project will be entitled to various types of compensation as \nshown in the project entitlement matrix (Table A12). \n \nTable A12: Project Entitlement Matrix  \n \nDefinition of \nType of Loss  Compensation Policy  Implementation Issues \nEntitled Person \nPermanent  Legal users (Those with  Cash compensation for acquired land  If land is owned by \nLoss of Land  land-use right  at full replacement cost  management organizations \n  certificates (LURCs)     (i.e., commune people\u2019s \n      committee), the CPC will be \nLegalizable land users.  entitled to \n(Those who are waiting  (i) full amount if communal \nfor the LURC to be  public land is not assigned \napproved by the district  to anyone; \nauthority and who have  (ii) 70% of the total amount \ndocuments to prove as  if land is already temporarily \nsuch.)  leased to the affected \npeople (AP). The remaining \n30% of the total amount will \nbe paid directly to the AP.  \nLoss of Crops  All crops and tree  Cash compensation for loss of crops   \nand Trees  owners regardless of  at replacement cost.  If sown or \nland-use right   standing crops are damaged or \nuprooted, the owner of the affected \ncrops will be compensated in cash \nfor loss of unharvested crops, at the \nmature crop value at replacement \ncost or current market rates.   \n \nCash compensation for loss of fruit \ntrees at replacement cost will be \nbased on the present income and \nfruit-bearing capacity. \nAP = affected people; CPC = commune people\u2019s committee; LURC = land-use right certificates. \n \nC.  Resettlement Design Criteria and Procedures \n1.  Land Selection  \n9.  As  a  priority,  classrooms  will  be  replaced  at  existing  sites.  New  schools  will  be \nconstructed on vacant and idle public or communal reserve land. For public land or communal \nland  identified,  the  PPC  will  confirm  that  the  said  land  is  free  from  any  encumbrances, \nhabitation, dispute, or controversy. The PPC certification will be verified by a third party such as \nthe Vietnam Women\u2019s Union. In the event that no vacant public land is available and that private \nland is identified, a detailed community decision-making process will be followed, using these \ncriteria: (i) land acquisition and resettlement must fall under Category B - not having significant \nimpacts, (ii) the land is not the subject of any legal disputes or controversies, (iii) the land does \nnot belong to any ethnic minorities, and (iv) there are no existing structures on the land.  A short \nRP will be prepared for each subproject. \n \n10.  In the case of voluntary contribution of land or other assets by AP, the following \nrequirements will be strictly followed to make the voluntary contribution acceptable: (i) the \nProject will certify that the AP are properly consulted and made fully aware of their rights to ", "  Appendix 12  53 \ncompensation and assistance, (ii) the AP will directly benefit from the Project, (iii) the AP will not \nbe severely affected or will not lose more than 10% of their individual total productive, income- \ngenerating assets, (iv) there are no existing structures on the land, (v) the AP do not belong to \nany vulnerable groups (e.g., the poor, ethnic minorities, households headed by women, the \ndisabled), (vi) the AP issued a written certification that they were properly consulted on their \nrights to compensation and that they opted to voluntarily donate their land, and (vii) the \nvoluntary land donation issued by an AP will be verified by a third party (such as Vietnam \nWomen\u2019s  Union).  The  process  will  be  properly  documented  by  the  Provincial  Project \nImplementation Unit and will be attached to the subproject RP.   \n \n2.  Subproject RP Preparation and Implementation  \n11.  In preparing and implementing the subproject RPs for Category B subprojects, the PPC    \nwill follow these procedures: \n \n(i)  Consult with various stakeholders to obtain their views on how to avoid or \nminimize adverse impacts and identify the needs and preferences of AP. \n(ii)  Undertake  joint  census  (100%),  asset  inventory,  and  detailed  measurement \nsurvey. \n(iii)  Undertake joint socioeconomic survey of a sample population. \n(iv)  Carry out joint replacement cost study for various types of assets (land, crops, \nand trees) and establish project compensation unit rates.   \n(v)  Analyze data to identify different categories of AP based on the degree and scale \nof impacts. \n(vi)  Compare the various types of losses with the agreed-upon entitlements as set \nout in the entitlement matrix.  If there are new categories of AP and types of \nlosses are identified, the entitlements will be included in accordance with ADB\u2019s \ninvoluntary resettlement policy.  The project entitlements cannot be downgraded. \n(vii)  Formulate  a  time-bound  action  plan  or  schedule  for  subproject  RP \nimplementation, procedures for grievance redress, monitoring and evaluation \nprocedures, and a budget. \n(viii)  Prepare a subproject RP. Translate it into the local languages and present the \ndraft during consultation and public meetings for comments.  The final subproject \nRP will incorporate the comments and suggestions of the affected communities. \n(ix)  Submit the subproject RP to ADB for review and approval.   \n(x)  Implement  subproject  RP.  Submit  progress  reports  to  ADB  as  part  of  the \nmonitoring activities.   \n(xi)  Submit subproject RP completion report for ADB review and request ADB to \naward civil works contract. \n(xii)  If all land acquisition and resettlement activities are properly implemented in \naccordance  with  the  approved  subproject  RP  and  ADB\u2019s  social  safeguard \npolicies, ADB will issue approval to award civil works. \n \nD.  Consultation and Disclosure of Resettlement Planning Documents \n12.  Information dissemination to, consultation with, and participation of APs and involved \nagencies maintains transparency of the Project, reduces potential conflicts, minimizes the risk of \nProject  delays,  and  enables  the  Project  to  design  the  resettlement  and  the  rehabilitation \nprogram as a comprehensive development program to suit the needs and priorities of the APs.   \nThe main objectives of the public information campaign, stakeholders\u2019 participation and APs\u2019 \nconsultation programs are to a) provide APs with full information on the proposed project, its \ncomponents and activities; b) obtain information on needs and priorities of APs and affected \n   ", " 54 Appendix 12 \ncommunities,  their  reactions  towards  project  proposed  policies  and  activities;  c)  achieve \ncooperation and participation of APs in proposed activities related to RP preparation and \nimplementation; d) ensure that APs are able to participate in and make fully informed choices on \nissues that directly affect their incomes and living standards; and e) ensure transparency in all \nactivities related to land acquisition, relocation and rehabilitation. This Resettlement Framework \nwill  be  uploaded  on  the  ADB  resettlement  website  immediately  upon  Board  approval.  All \nsubproject RPs will be translated in Vietnamese language and will be disclosed to APs prior to \nsubmission to ADB for review and approval.   \n \nE.  Grievance Redress Procedure \n13.  To  ensure  that  all  AP  complaints,  grievances  on  any  aspect  of  land  acquisition, \ncompensation, relocation, payment  are addressed and resolved in a timely and satisfactory \nmanner, and that all avenues for airing grievances are available to AP, a well-defined grievance \nredress mechanism will be established. The AP will be made fully aware of their rights verbally \nand in writing during consultation, survey, and time of compensation. Detailed procedures for \nboth redressing grievances and the appeal process will be publicized among AP through an \neffective public information campaign.   Attempts will be made to settle emerging issues at the \nward level through community consultation and involvement of a resettlement specialist or \nnongovernment organizations as required. The respective resettlement committees will properly \ndocument all complaints and resolutions. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  MOET is the Executing Agency and will have overall responsibility for coordinating and \nimplementing all subproject activities including land acquisition and resettlement.   A central \nproject coordination unit (CPCU) will be established and will be staffed with a manager, a \ndeputy manager, and project staff from relevant departments and agencies of MOET, other \nsupport and administrative staff, and international and domestic consultants.  The CPCU will be \nspecifically responsible for the following resettlement activities: (i) submit RPs prepared by the \nProvincial Project Implementation Unit to ADB for review and approval; (ii) consolidate RP \nprogress reports; and (iii) recruit and supervise consultants, including the domestic resettlement \nspecialist for RP planning and implementation.  \n \n15.  The PPC will be responsible for preparing and implementing all subproject RPs and \nresettlement-related issues.  Resettlement committees at the provincial, district, and commune \nlevels will be set up to assist the PPC in RP planning and implementation, as required.    \n \n16.  The provincial project implementation unit (PPIU) will be responsible for day-to-day \nproject  implementation.  It  will  comprise  technical,  institutional,  social  and  resettlement, \nadministrative management, and accounting divisions. The PPIU, together with the PPC, will be \nresponsible  for  the  following  key  resettlement  activities:  (i)  integrate  civil  works  with  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  activities;  (ii)  carry  out  information  campaigns,  consultation, \ndisclosure of subproject RPs; (iii) develop a centralized compensation mechanism through \nwhich  resettlement  disbursements  and  compensation  payments  for  AP  will  be  made;  (iv) \ncoordinate with other departments for effective implementation of the RP approved under the \nsubproject;  (v)  ensure  timely  flow  of  the  resettlement  budget  for  effective  delivery  of \ncompensation payments; (vi) ensure that a grievance redress mechanism is in place; and (vii) \nprepare and submit regular progress reports on civil works and status of RP activities. \n \n17.  The project supervision consultants will have one domestic construction supervision and \nresettlement specialist, who, in cooperation with one domestic gender education specialist and ", "  Appendix 12  55 \none domestic ethnic minority education specialist, will assist and supervise with all social and \nresettlement-related activities. Some key responsibilities are to: (i) work closely with local \nauthorities and resettlement committees at all levels on resettlement-related activities and train \nlocal resettlement staff, as required; (ii) establish and implement liaison mechanisms to ensure \nproper technical and logistical support from the Project to the PPIUs, local administrative \nauthorities, resettlement committees, and concerned government departments; (iii) assist in  \nconducting  information  campaigns  and  community  participation;  (iv)  assist  in  conducting \ncensus, inventory of losses survey, DMS, and replacement cost study activities; (v) check the \nprepared affected peoples database for accuracy, and provide suggestions for improvement if \nnecessary; (vi) assist in preparing subproject RPs and progress reports; (vii) assist and revise, if \nnecessary, procedures for coordinating resettlement and compensation activities, including \nimplementation  arrangements;  and  (viii)  ensure  that  grievance  redress  mechanisms  are \nappropriate, and advise on speedy resolutions. \n \nG.  Implementation Schedule \n18.  The Project is expected to begin in 2005. Civil works will be implemented in two stages. \nStage 1 will start in 2006 by building 143 schools (63 schools from the first priority group, 40 \nfrom the second priority group, and 40 from the third priority group). Stage 2 will begin in 2007 \nby building the remaining 103 schools (63 schools from the first priority group and 40 from the \nsecond priority group). The schedule for RP implementation will be properly coordinated with \nthe civil works schedule. ADB will not approve any civil works contract for any subproject to be \nfinanced from the loan proceeds unless the Government has satisfactorily completed all RP \nactivities. \n \nH.  Budget \n19.  The budget for the subproject RPs to cover the cost of land acquisition and resettlement \nwill be prepared within the agreed-upon implementation period. The RP budget will include the \nbreakdown for each type of loss per AP, with a corresponding compensation amount equivalent \nto replacement cost. Costs for implementing, monitoring, and contingencies will also be included \nin the overall RP budget. \n \nI.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n20.  The general objective of monitoring is to ensure timely and accurate compensation and \nimplementation  of  the  resettlement  program.  RP  implementation  will  be  monitored  and \nevaluated by the CPCU, and preferably by an external monitoring and evaluation agency, to \ngive the management feedback on implementation and identify problems and successes as \nearly as possible to facilitate timely adjustment of implementation arrangements.  \n  \n21.  The  PPC  and  PPIU,  with  the  assistance  of  the  project  supervision  consultants,  if \nrequired,  will  submit  to  the  CPCU  regular  quarterly  progress  reports  which  will  then  be \nsubmitted  to  ADB.  The  progress  reports  will  include  the  following  topics:  (i)  information \ncampaign, consultations carried out during RP implementation; (ii) the number of AP per \ncomponent by category of impact, and the status of compensation payment and relocation and \nincome restoration for each category; (iii) the amount of funds allocated for operations or for \ncompensation and the amount disbursed for each; (iv) the eventual outcome of complaints and \ngrievances and any outstanding issues requiring management or ADB\u2019s assistance; and (v) \nimplementation issues and an agreed-upon time-bound action plan. \n \n   ", "56   Appendix 13   \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in  Viet Nam: The lower secondary education (LSE) \nsubsector plays a crucial role in poverty reduction, especially for those who come from ethnic minority and poor groups. \nStatistics show that in the poor and remote areas, ethnic minority and female students are underrepresented in LSE. The \nProject will create favorable conditions for these students to participate in LSE and to receive vocational orientation guidance \nand training in local traditional handicrafts to maintain and develop ethnic culture. To achieve universal basic education is the \ntarget to reduce poverty in the country.Over the last decade, LSE has seen a remarkable growth in enrollment number and in \nproportion of the school age population.  In 2001\u20132002, the national gross enrollment rate (GER) was 84.81%, and net \nenrollment rate (NER) was 74.38%.  There remain significant differences in enrollment rate, however, among regions and \nprovinces.  For example, the NER in Red River Delta is 89.65% and GER is 94.07%; in the northwest region the two rates are \n48.90% and 68.45%, respectively. The enrollment rate of ethnic students is low and uneven among ethnic regions. Some \nethnic minorities have an enrollment rate similar to that of the Kinh group, while the enrollment rate for other ethnic minorities \nremains low, especially among Hmong (4.5%), Dao (11.8%) and Bana (8.9%). There is also a significant difference in \nenrollment rate between the rich and the poor. Of the 20% poorest households and 20% richest households, only 33.6% of \nthe poorest households can access LSE compared with 91% of the richest households.The Project will address issues \nconcerning access to and equity in LSE in selected provinces in northern uplands, coastal center, central highlands, north, \neast, south, and Mekong River Delta, which are suffering from slow economic and education development. \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Poverty Classification: Poverty Intervention1 \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  The poverty partnership agreement with the Asian Development Bank was \nsigned on 25 February 2002.The most recent estimate of the population of Viet Nam is 80.78 million. Due to a sharp reduction \nin the birth rate, the proportion of children under 15 kept declining, from 39% in 1989 to 35.5% in 1999. While the percentage \nof females in the population is 50.84%, the nationwide ratio of females in the LSE (in 10\u201314 age group) is 48.26%.There is a \nsignificant difference in the average living standard between rural and urban areas. The lowest annual per capita income in \nurban areas in 1999 was D2,400,000 ($160), while in rural areas it was D996,000  ($66); the highest annual per capita income \nin urban areas was D23,529,600 ($1,569), and the figure for rural areas was D6,276,000  ($418). The poor in Viet Nam often \nshare common features: they live in rural areas, have relatively low levels of educational attainment, large number of children, \nand lack access to social and physical infrastructure.  Poverty has a great effect on participation in LSE of children of school \nage. Early child labor prevents children, especially girls from going to school. More seriously, early marriage is common in \nsome remote ethnic minority areas. Official statistics show that, during 1993\u20131998, less than 50% of children from low-income \nfamilies continued to pursue LSE. Cultural factors and male preference also affect the education of children, especially girls. \nIn recent years the Government launched a National Target Poverty Reduction Program, which focused on: developing \nphysical facilities for poor communes; providing assistance for special disadvantaged ethnic minorities, resettlement, \nmigration to new economic zones; training in basic economic knowledge for the poor; credit, health care, and education \nservices for the poor; and development of production and local industries. Under socioeconomic development programs for \nspecial disadvantaged communes in mountains and remote areas, the Government will provide financial assistance to 2,162 \ncommunes. Specific policies in health and education toward poor and ethnic minority populations were under implementation. \nAbout 1.3 million students are entitled to tuition fee reduction or exemption, and 1.4 million students can borrow textbooks and \nreceive free textbooks with a total budget of D80 million from local budget and education sector funds. However, the \nresources reserved for poverty reduction programs are still limited and do not meet the demand. The Project will enhance \naccess and quality of LSE for the poor, ethnic minorities, and female students through the following activities: (i) construction \nof schools with priority for poor and disadvantaged areas; provision of equipment and teaching aids, textbook lending, \nboarding -houses for students who live far from school and for poor students; (ii) design of special summer and school year \nflexible programs to help students to master the curriculum; and (iii) organize vocational orientation and training courses on \ntraditional handicrafts of ethnic minorities, creating opportunities for them to integrate into society. The Project will focus its \ninvestment on 28 provinces facing great difficulties, with the following criteria: (i) a low NER, (ii) a large number of very poor \npeople or low human development intervention rating, (iii) high number of ethnic minority students, and (iv) low transition rate \nfrom primary to LSE. \nC.

Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: Female students, particularly from the ethnic minority families, are deprived of \naccess to the LSE. Lack of understanding and incentives to poor families to send girls to lower secondary schools, a limited \nnumber of qualified female teachers who can be the role model of educated women, and irrelevance of old-fashioned \n                                                 \n1  Following the Board approval of the R-Paper, Review of ADB\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy, staff instructions to replace the \nPI/CPI classification with a new tracking system are under preparation in line with paragraph 83 of the R-Paper. \n ", "  Appendix 13   57 \ncurriculum in  market economy work to keep the female enrollment rate in LSE considerably lower than that of male students. \nTo achieve the Government\u2019s commitment to universal LSE by 2015, more strategic policy actions for gender development in \nthe LSE sector is needed. The Project has the gender education action plan, which will be implemented in all components. \nMain activities from the gender development perspectives are (i) development of a new curriculum and extra instructional \nmaterial with special attention to female students; (ii) improvement of in-service teacher training using a gender-oriented \napproach including courses on gender education and cultural activities and mentoring system for female teachers; (iii) \nprovision of sanitary facilities such as toilets, sanitation, and water supply, which will help prevent female students from \ndropping out; and (iv) establishment of a capacity-building mechanism for female administrators and teachers. The gender \neducation action plans will be facilitated by various stakeholders including the Committee for the Advancement of Women and \nthe Women\u2019s Union in Viet Nam. To assist the smooth implementation of gender development activities, the Project will \nprovide a gender education specialist for 9 person-months. These activities will be implemented in the project period from \n2005 to 2010, in close linkage with other relevant activities to maximize their synergy. To ensure that gender development \nactivities under the Project improve access and quality of LSE for female students, the Project plans to establish a solid \nmonitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework. M&E specialist-Team Leader with participation of the beneficiary communities \nand local people to  maintain transparency and accountability. The reporting system will also be established. Quarterly, \nmidterm, and final reports will be required to present the achievement of the activities against the original goal and objectives. \nPeriodical data on gender and ethnic minorities will be updated in these reports as well.    \nHas an output been prepared?

Introduction \n \n1.  The  enrollment  rate  of  ethnic  minority  students,  especially  female  students,  in \nmountainous and ethnic minority areas is lower than the national rate. It also varies among \nethnic groups.  Dropout and repetition rates among ethnic minority students are high. It is a \ngreat challenge to achieve universal lower secondary education in Viet Nam by 2015 if the \nsituation is not improved. \n \n2.  The ethnic minority population often reside in remote and disadvantaged areas, which \nare characterized by poor physical infrastructure, lack of basic services, and poorly developed \neconomy. Every ethnic group preserves its own traditions, culture, and language. To encourage \nethnic minorities, especially female students to attend lower secondary education, special \nattention and actions, as indicated in Table A14 are needed during project implementation.  \n \nTable A14: Ethnic Minorities and Gender Action Plan \n \nComponent/Activities  Approaches/Monitoring Indicators \nComponent 1:  Improving Quality and Efficiency of Lower Secondary Education \nNew curriculum implementation  \u2022  Construct more classrooms, subject classrooms, and libraries to \nfacilitate the implementation of a new curriculum in ethnic \nminority areas. Provide teaching equipment for lower secondary \nschools, including nine ethnic minority boarding schools. \n\u2022  Develop extra teaching materials that are more appropriate for \nethnic students and female students, and which teachers can \nuse during the school year and on summer holidays.   \nImproving teaching contents and methods   \u2022  Deploy  new  teaching  methods  aligned  with  the  new  lower \nsecondary education curriculum, through in-service activities and \ndevelop materials appropriate for ethnic minorities and female \nstudents. \nIn-service teacher training   \u2022  Improve teachers' subject matter and pedagogical knowledge in \n  various ways. This component is to continue and reinforce the \n  improvement in teaching contents and methods, by reviewing \n  and completing the nationwide introduction of the new curriculum \n  and textbook for grade 9 and related in-service teacher training. \n  Instruction materials for each of 15 subjects will be given for \n  about  260,000  teachers,  70,000  mentors,  trainers,  school \n  principals, and 4,500 trainers on distance learning. In-service \n  teacher training includes sending 100 trainers form the Ministry \n  of  Education  and  Training  and  provincial  department  of \n  Education  and  Training  on  short-term  overseas  courses, \n  upgrading qualification of 3,700 mentors, continuing training of \n  10,000 unqualified teachers (70% are females). School-based \n  training for 1,800 teachers of music, art, physical education, and \n  foreign languages will be implemented during the project period. \n  The proportion of female participants in each training is at least \n  40%. \n  \u2022  Organize in-service training courses on needed topics such as \n  gender  education,  psychology  of  ethnic  minority  students, \n  indigenous languages, cultural activities, for teachers in ethnic \n  minority  areas.  Participants  in  courses  will  be  100% ethnic \nminority teachers. \n\u2022  Deliver in-service training for school mentors who, in turn, will \nprovide in-service training on specific topics for other teachers in \nthe areas, with special attention to ethnic minorities and female \nteachers.

District \nboarding  schools  will  be  provided  with  musical  instruments \nincluding both traditional and modern types. \n\u2022 Develop  teachers\u2019  reference  materials  on  organizing  cultural \nactivities, students' cultural life at school, and vocational training in \ntraditional handicrafts for ethnic minority and female students.  \nThese  materials  will  help  lower  secondary  schools  in  ethnic \nminority  areas  to  organize  activities  appropriate  to  ethnic \nminorities and female students, and will increase the number of \nsuch students and improve teaching quality. \nResearch support  \u2022 Support  research  that  assess  education  needs  and  career \n  pathways of ethnic minority and female students. \nComponent 3: Strengthening Management Capacity under Decentralization \nIn-service training for school  \u2022  Provide in-service training courses for school administrators to \nadministrators  improve their capacity for school management in relation to the \n  needs of ethnic minorities and females. \n   \nIncreased community awareness of the  \u2022  Involve the communities in encouraging children to attend and \nbenefits of education  remain at school. \n   \nMore female and ethnic minority  \u2022  Give priority to female management officers and members of \nadministrators  ethnic minorities to participate in project management and training \n  activities. \nReporting and evaluation   \n\u2022  Monitor gender indicators and regularly report on them. \n \nB.   Implementation Arrangements \n  \n1.  Organization  \n \n3.  The ethnic minority and gender education action plan will be implemented in all project \ncomponents.  The  project  director  and  consultant  team  leader  are  fully  responsible  for \nimplementing, the gender and ethnic minority action plan, and monitoring and reporting on its ", "60  Appendix 14 \nprogress. They will closely coordinate with provincial department of Education and Training, \nbureau of education and trainings, and schools with the support of domestic consultants on \ngender  and  education  and  the  ethnic  minorities  education  specialist.  During  project \nimplementation, the subject specialists will coordinate with the gender and ethnic minority \nspecialists to ensure the responsiveness of gender and ethnic minority issues in all activities \nunder each project component. They also will work closely with the focal point agency for \ngender and ethnic minorities within Ministry of Education and Training (MOET), which are the \nCommittee for the Advancement of Women (CFAW) and Sub CFAW and the Ethnic Minority \nEducation Center of MOET. For daily supervision and administration, a gender focal point at the \nCentral Project Coordination Unit (CPCU) will be appointed. \n \n2.  Institutional Capacity \n \n4.  The Ethnic Minority Education Center of MOET is a research agency that helps MOET  \ndeploy  appropriate  teaching  contents,  methods,  and  policy  studies.  It  has  considerable \nexperience  in  developing  training  curricula  and  organizing  courses  for  ethnic  minority \nparticipants. The Center is participating in preparing and implementing Asian Development \nBank Lower Secondary Education Development Project. \n  \n5.  The CFAW is the focal point for gender and development issues in the education sector . \nIt is chaired by a vice minister and put under the National Committee for the Advancement of \nViet Nam. Under CFAW, Sub CFAW was established in each DOET.  \n \n6.  The Women\u2019s Union in Vietnam is a mass organization that represents the interests of \nwomen, especially women in rural areas and at grassroots level. The Union is very active at \nlocal levels, and will be an important stakeholder for any community participation activity during \nproject implementation, especially in stakeholder consultation and monitoring and evaluation \n(M&E). The Project will implement ethnic minority and gender education activities in cooperation \nwith these agencies. \n \n3.  Budget and Financing Plan \n \n7.  The financial plan of the ethnic minority and gender activities is included in the proposed \nProject's financial plan to ensure the feasibility of implementing the action plan. The Project will \nalso have specialist assistance through a gender and ethnic minority specialist (9 person-\nmonths) and an ethnic minority and education specialist (15 person-months) who will help \nimplement the action plan. \n \n4.  Implementation Schedule \n \n8.  The ethnic minority and gender action plan will be implemented in accordance with the \nschedule of the proposed Project from 2005 to 2010, and the specific implementation schedule \nof each of the three project components. \n \n5.
