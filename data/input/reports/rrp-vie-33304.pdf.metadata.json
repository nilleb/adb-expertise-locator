The  Project  will \nimprove  LSE  quality,  efficiency,  access  and  equity,  and \nmanagement  capacity.  It  will  support  conditions  for  improving  the \nquality  and  efficiency  of  LSE  by  completing  the  curriculum  and \ntextbook \ntraining \nrelated \nnationwide,  and  by  developing  the  student  assessment  system , \nwhich  will  meet  the  requirements  of  the  new  curriculum  and \ntextbooks,  will  promote  equitable  access  to  LSE  in disadvantaged \nareas,  especially  for  poor  and  ethnic  minority  students,  and  will \nstrengthen  the  LSE  management  capacity  under  the  system  of \ndecentralization  from  central  to  local  administration.  The  project \ndesign  is  based  on  the  secondary  education  sector  master  plan \nsupported  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  and  under  the \noverall  framework  of  the  National  Education  for  All  Action  Plan, \n2003\u20132015, approved by the Prime Minister in July 2003. \n \nPrimary  education  became  near-universal  in  2000  with  a  net \nenrollment  rate  (NER)  of  over  90%\u2014a  remarkable  achievement \namong developing countries with similar levels of per capita income. \nExpansion  of  secondary-level  school  coverage  has  also  been \nremarkable. During 1993\u20132002, lower secondary school enrollment \ngrew by almost 100% from 3.2 million to 6.5 million, with the NER  \nincreasing  from  30.1%  in  1993  to  72.1%  in  2002.  Viet  Nam  is \nmaking  good  progress  in  meeting  the  Millennium  Development \nGoals  of  universal  primary  education  and  gender  equity.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  sector  policy  targets  by  2010  are  to  (i)  consolidate \nuniversal primary education, (ii) universalize LSE, and (iii) gradually \nexpand  upper  secondary  education.  The  Government  targets  a \nnationwide LSE NER of 80% by 2005 and 90% by 2010. \n \nDespite impressive gains in access, disparities exist by geographic  \nlocation and economic and social background, and much remains to \nbe accomplished to achieve the sector policy targets. Unreached  \n\n                                                 \n1   Following  the  Board  approval  of  the  R-Paper,  Review  of  ADB\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy, staff instructions to \nreplace the PI/CPI classification with a new tracking system are under preparation in line with paragraph 83 of the \nR-Paper. \n\n\f iii \n\nand poor groups must be reached, and education quality improved \nunder  decentralized  education  management.  Viet  Nam  remains  a \nlow-income country with a per capita gross domestic product (GDP) \nestimated  at  $426  in  2002.  Although  poverty  incidence  declined \nfrom  37.6%  in  1998  to  about  29%  in  2002,  the  poor  people living \nbelow the poverty line are typically farmers with little education, and \nupland  ethnic  minorities.  Ethnic  minority  children  are  particularly \ndisadvantaged. The lower secondary NER of the Kinh majority was \nalmost  80%,  but  the  NER  of  ethnic  minorities  was  48%.  The  gap \nbetween the poor and the nonpoor is also significant; the NER was \nonly  53.8%  for  lower  secondary  students  from  the  poorest  income \nquintile,  and  85.8%  for  the  richest.  While  enrollments  of  males \n(53%)  and  females  (47%)  were  almost  on  par  in  2002,  ethnic \nminority female students accounted for only 21.6% of the total lower \nsecondary enrollments.    \n\ntextbooks  and \n\n \nImproving  the  quality  of  education  is  a  high  policy  priority  of  the \nMinistry  of  Education  and  Training  (MOET)  in  view  of  the  need  to \ndevelop  a  creative,  flexible,  self-motivated,  and  skilled  labor  force \nfor  a  knowledge-  and  market-based economy.  A  new curriculum \nand  compatible \ninstructional  materials  were \ndeveloped  for  all  four  grades  of  LSE  and  have  been  tested  since \nschool year 2000/01 starting from grade 6 (2 years for each grade) \nand introduced nationwide since school year 2002/03 starting from \ngrade 6. The new curriculum intends to encourage active, student-\ncentered teaching and learning methods. The Project seeks to help \nthe  Government  further  develop  and  improve  LSE  in  accordance \nwith government policies, plans, and targets.   \n \nThe  Project  will  help  reduce  poverty  in  Viet  Nam  through  the \ndevelopment and improvement of LSE. Over the medium term, the \nProject  will  improve  quality,  efficiency,  access  and  equity,  and \nmanagement  capacity  in  LSE,  in  particular,  by  improving  quality \nsupport  systems  nationwide  and  by  achieving  the  Government\u2019s \ngoal of universalizing LSE nationwide by 2010. The specific project \nobjectives are to (i) improve LSE quality and efficiency; (ii) promote \nequitable access to  LSE for  students in disadvantaged areas; and \n(iii)  strengthen  management  capacity  in  LSE  under  the  system  of \ndecentralization \nincluding \nto \nprovincial departments of education and training (DOETs), bureaus \nof education and training (BOETs), and schools. \n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $80.0  million  equivalent \nincluding  taxes  and  duties,  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and \ninterest charge on the loan. The foreign exchange cost is estimated \nat $21.6 million, or 27.0%,  and the local currency cost is estimated \nat $58.4 million equivalent, or 73.0% of the total cost.   \n \n\nlocal  administration \n\nfrom  MOET \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \nObjectives \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n\fFinancing Plan \n \n\niv \n \n\n \n\n \nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n                                                                                           ($ million) \n \n\n% \n\nSource \n\n69 \n31 \n100 \n\n33.4 \n25.0 \n58.4 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \nCost \n55.0 \n25.0 \n80.0 \n\nADB \nGovernment \nTotal \n\nForeign \nExchange \n21.6 \n0.0 \n21.6 \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  Special  Drawing  Rights \n(SDR) 37,346,000 ($55.0 million equivalent) from its Special Funds \nresources, with a maturity term of 32 years, including a grace period \nof  8  years  and  an  interest  charge  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \nUntil 30 June 2011 \n \n31 December 2010 \n\n \nMOET  will  have  overall  responsibility \nfor  coordinating  and \nimplementing  all  activities  of  the  Project.

Civil works, as \nthey will be small in amount and scattered across the country,  will \nbe  awarded  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB) \nfollowing Government procedures acceptable to ADB. CPCU will be \nresponsible  for  procurements  by  international  competitive  biddings \n(ICB)  for  goods,  LCB  (except  for  civil  works)  and  international \nshopping. The PPIUs will procure civil works, instructional materials, \nand small quantities of goods such as office consumables by LCB \nprocedures  or  direct  purchase.  State-owned  enterprises  that  may \nparticipate  in  any  bidding  under  the  Project  must  be  financially \nautonomous and operate under commercial laws.  \n\n\f \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConsulting Services \n\n \n\n \n\n v\n\n \nSupply  contracts  for  goods  estimated  at  $500,000  equivalent  or \nmore  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  ICB.  Supply  contracts  for \ngoods  such  as  vehicles  and  computers  (other  than  instructional \nmaterials) of less than $500,000 but more than $100,000 will follow \ninternational shopping procedures.

The estimated unit cost is $10,000 \nper  classroom  and  facility,  including  design  and  construction \nsupervision. Technical design study and supervision of construction \nquality  costing  less  than  $100,000  will  be  procured  by  direct \npurchase. The civil works are spread over lower secondary schools \nin  28  disadvantaged  provinces.  The  civil  works  component  will  be \nfinanced by ADB and the government, and will be awarded on the \nbasis of LCB, following government procedures acceptable to ADB. \nThe PPIU will ensure correct implementation of the civil works.  \n \nThe  Project  will  use  consultants  to  improve  the  quality  support \nsystems  nationally,  promote  access  and  equity  in  disadvantaged \nprovinces  and  districts,  and  strengthen  management  of  LSE. \nConsulting services of 490 person-months (40 international and 450 \ndomestic) will  be  needed.  International  consultants  will  be  needed \nfor  introducing  new  active-learning  teaching  method,  student \nassessment  methods,  and \ninformation  and  communication \ntechnology  (ICT)  in  schools  (component  1);  and  management  and \nplanning,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  school  mapping, and finance \nand  procurement  (component  3).  Domestic  consultants  will  be \nneeded  in  active  learning-teaching  methods,  student  assessment \nmethods, education equipment, and the use of ICT (component 1); \nconstruction engineering and supervision (including resettlement \n \naspects), and gender and ethnic minority education (component 2); \nand  management  and  planning,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  school \nmapping,  and  finance  and  procurement  (component  3).  All  ADB-\nfinanced  consultants  will  be  selected  through  a  firm,  using  quality- \nand cost-based selection and in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to \nADB for engaging domestic consultants.

Support  will  be  extended  to  approximately \n175,000  disadvantaged  students  and  100,000  returning  students. \nApproximately  10,000  teachers  will  be  upgraded  to  work  with \ndisadvantaged students. \n \nUnder  component  3,  activities  to  develop  fundamental  school \nquality  levels  will  benefit  6,110  personnel:  3,050  principals,  1,220 \nsupervisors, 1,220 members of BOETs, 610 members of DOETs, \nand 10 other education officials. In-service training on planning and \nmanagement will benefit an estimated 5,500 staff  members. About \n15,100  officials  will  be \nin  education  and  school \ntrained \nmanagement.  Project  implementation  training  will  benefit  390 \nprincipals, 1,040 staff members of DOETs, and 50 other education \nofficials. \n \n\n\f vii \n\nThe  risks  are  derived  from  the  magnitude  of  the  Project,  which \ninvolves  as  many  as  28  provinces  for  civil  works  and  all  provinces \nfor  quality  enhancement  activities.  Risks  are  also associated with \nthe  involvement  of  a  range  of  implementing  units  from  the  central \nministry level to provincial and even district levels. Mitigating factors \ninclude  MOET\u2019s  substantial  experience  in  managing  three  World \nBank  and  four  ADB-financed  projects.

Expansion  of  secondary-level  school  coverage  has  also  been  remarkable. \nDuring 1993\u20132002, lower secondary school enrollment grew by almost 100% from 3.2 million to \n6.5 million, with the NER increasing from 30.1% in 1993 to 72.1% in 2002.1 Viet Nam is making \ngood  progress  in  meeting  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  of  universal  primary  education \nand  gender  equality.  The  Government\u2019s  sector  policy  targets  by  2010  are  to  (i)  consolidate \nuniversal  primary  education,  (ii)  universalize  lower  secondary  education  (LSE),  and  (iii) \ngradually expand upper secondary education.  For LSE,  the  Government  targets  a  nationwide \nNER of 80% by 2005 and 90% by 2010.2 \n \nDespite impressive gains in access, disparities due to geographic location and economic \n3. \nand social background exist, and much remains to be accomplished to achieve the sector policy \ntargets.  Unreached  and  poor  groups  must  be  reached,  and  education  quality  needs  to  be \nimproved under decentralized education management. Viet Nam remains a low-income country \nwith  per  capita  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  estimated  at  $426  in  2002.  Although  poverty \nincidence has declined from 37% in 1998 to about 29% in 2002,3 the poor people living below \nthe poverty line are typically farmers with little education, and  upland ethnic minorities.  Ethnic \nminority children are particularly disadvantaged. The lower secondary NER of the Kinh majority \nwas  almost  80%,  but  the  NER  of  ethnic  minorities  averaged  48%.  The  gap  between  the  poor \nand the nonpoor is also significant; the NER was only 53.8% for lower secondary students from \nthe poorest income quintile, and 85.8% for the richest (footnote 1). While enrollments of males \n(53%)  and  females  (47%)  were  almost  on  par  in  2002,  ethnic  minority  female  students \naccounted for only 21.6% of the total lower secondary enrollments.  \n \n4. \nImproving  the  quality  of  education  is  a  high  policy  priority  of  the  Ministry  of  Education \nand  Training  (MOET)  in  view  of  the  need  to  develop  a  creative,  flexible,  self-motivated, and \nskilled labor force for a knowledge- and market-based economy in the future. New curricula and \ncompatible  textbooks  and  instructional  materials  were  developed  for  all  four  grades  of  lower \nsecondary education and have been piloted since school year 2000/01 starting from grade 6 (2 \nyears for each grade) and introduced nationwide since school year 2002/03 starting from grade \n6.  The  new  curriculum  intends  to  encourage  active,  student-centered  teaching  and  learning \nmethods.  The  Project  seeks  to  help  the  Government  further  develop  and  improve  LSE  in \naccordance with government policies, plans, and targets.

The sector and subsector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n6. \nThe quality of LSE needs to be improved in terms of student learning achievements.  A \nsystem of periodic, sample-based learning assessments is required to evaluate the curriculum \nand  teacher  effectiveness  and  hence,  quality  improvements  in  education.  However,  such \nassessments focus largely on lower order cognitive skills (knowledge of facts) and students tend \nto  focus  their  learning  on  developing  retentive  memories.  Learning  assessments  need  to  be \naligned with the goals of the new curriculum. There are about 260,000 LSE teachers in school \nyear 2002/03, of whom an estimated 237,000 (or 91% of the total LSE teachers) were qualified. \nHowever, to help improve quality, most in-service teachers, even those with formal qualifications, \nneed  to  update  their  teaching  skills  and  be  familiar  with  curricular  changes  and  new  teaching \nmethods.  Active,  student-centered  teaching  and  learning  methods  have  been  piloted  and \nintroduced  nationwide.  However,  teaching  styles  are  still  largely  teacher-centered  and  not \nenough  attention  is  paid  to  individual  student  differences  in  interest  and  capacity. A challenge \nwill  be  to  fully  make  classroom  teaching  and  learning  active  and  student  centered.  In-class \ninstructional  time  is  low  by  international  standards.  Many  schools  operate  on  a  double  shift \nsystem; some share school buildings with the local primary schools and offer only an average \nteacher contact  of  less  than  4  hours  a  day.  To  meet  international  standards,  teacher  contact \nshould  be  6  hours  per  day  for  a  5-day,  40-week  school  year.  The  supply  of  textbooks  and \ninstructional materials also varies by household income level, school location, and subject area. \nSchools need more and better teaching aids, equipment and function rooms, especially libraries, \nscience laboratories, and computer rooms.  \n \n7. \nInternal  efficiency  remains  low,  with  higher  dropout  and  class  repetition  rates  than  the \nnational  average  rate  in  some  regions  of  the  country  such  as  the  central  highlands,  Mekong \nRiver delta, and northwest.  Overage  students  are numerous  as  a  result  of  delayed  entry  and \nrepetition.  The  average  time  for  completing  LSE  is  about  5.4  years,  compared  with  4  years  if \nstudents  do  not  have  to  repeat  grades  or  drop  out.  There  is  little  data  on  external  efficiency \nbased  on  the  students\u2019  completion  of  LSE,  and  it  is  a  weakness  that must  be addressed to \nadequately assess LSE responsiveness to human resources demands.   \n \n8. \nLimited  access,  especially  by  the  poor  and  ethnic  minorities,  remains  a  problem.  \nDisparities  among  provinces  and  among  districts  in  a  province  are  also  significant.  NERs  of \nprovinces  in  poor  regions  such  as  the  northern  uplands,  central  coast,  central  highlands,  and \nMekong  River  delta  were  below  the  national  average  rate  of  about  72%  in  2002.  Achieving \nuniversal  LSE  requires  a  targeted  approach  by  focusing  on  specific  provinces,  districts, and \nethnic  minority  groups.  The  main  reason  for  the  differences  in  lower  secondary  enrollment \nacross  income  categories  (para.  3)  has  to  do  with  the  opportunity  cost  of  sending  children  to \nschool.  Poor  students  need  to  boost  family  income  or  assist  in  the  household.  Parents, \nespecially among the poor and ethnic minorities, do not sufficiently value education to send their \nchildren to lower secondary school or keep them there. Moreover, there are other specific and \ninterrelated constraints on access and equity to LSE: (i) the number of lower secondary schools \nis insufficient; (ii) schools are too far away for reasonable daily access by school-age children; \n(iii) boarding school facilities at the nearest available lower secondary school are lacking; and iv) \nstudents do not finish primary school or finish it too late to reasonably attend lower secondary \nschool. 4 \n \n                                                 \n4 ADB and MOET.2004. Second Lower Secondary Education Development Project. Manila (TA Final Report). \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n9. \nIn view of significant differences in management capacity among provinces and among \ndistricts in a province, the management capacity for LSE\u2014especially in the areas of  education \nplanning  and  budgeting,  and  application  of  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)\u2013\nneeds  to  be  strengthened  at  the  provincial,  district,  commune,  and  school  levels.  In  addition, \nmore  equitable  cost-sharing measures should be introduced without increasing the household \nfinancial  burden  of  the  poor.  In  2002,  the  financial  burden  measured  as  a  percentage of total \nhousehold  expenditure  is  roughly  the  same  for  all  population  groups  with  a  range  of 2.7% to \n2.9% of the total household expenditure, except for the richest quintile paying slightly more with \n3.1%  (footnote  1).  Through  a  program  of  school-based  management  training,  parent  and \ncommunity involvement in school management should also be encouraged and institutionalized \nto assure effective participation in school-related issues. \n \n10. \nThe  Government  accords  high  priority  to  the  development  of  secondary  education \nbecause it is expected to provide the level of human resources required to meet the country\u2019s \ncritical  social  and  economic  development  goals  and  contribute  to  poverty  reduction.  In \naccordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  priority  on  secondary  education,  the  assistance  of  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  in  the  education  sector  in  Viet  Nam  has  focused  on  secondary \neducation,  starting  with  the  Lower  Secondary  Education  Development  Project  (LSEDP) \napproved  in  1997,  together  with  the  Teacher  Training  Project  approved  in  1999  for  lower \nsecondary  preservice  teacher  training  system  developments, 5  and  the  Upper  Secondary \nEducation Development Project approved in 2002.6 ADB is also supporting the renovation of the \nvocational  and  technical  education  system.7  In  particular,  the  LSEDP  has  made  remarkable \nprogress in all three project components of quality, access, and institutional development. Key \nlessons from the LSEDP are as follows: (i) the piloting of new curriculum and textbooks needs \nto  comply  with  Government  regulations  and  requires  a  lot  of  dissemination  efforts;  (ii)  lower \nsecondary  school-age  population  in  disadvantaged  areas  is  still  underserved;  (iii)  LSE  quality \nsupport  systems  such  as  student  assessments,  teachers  in  some  subject  areas,  teaching \ncontents  and  methods  have  not  fully  met  the  requirements  in  the  new  curriculum;  (iv)  foreign \nlanguage and information and communication technology (ICT) teachers especially need further \nin-service  training;  and  (v)  management  capacity  in  LSE  has  to  be  further  strengthened  at  all \nlevels  to  meet  the  new  planning  and  management  methods  requirements.  These  lessons  and \ninitiatives from the LSEDP will be continuously addressed and appropriately  incorporated in the \nproject design. Similar lessons  on preservice lower secondary teacher training are drawn from the \nTeacher Training Project. \n \n11. \nIn  line  with  policies  and  targets  set  out  in  the  Government\u2019s  long-term  education \ndevelopment strategy covering the 10 years from 2001 to 2010 (footnote 2), ADB assisted the \nGovernment in formulating a Secondary Education Sector Master Plan (SESMP), which serves \nas  an  analytical  tool  and  guide  for  future  decision  making  on  policy  frameworks,  feasible \nstrategies,  and  investment  priorities.8  The  European  Union  is  supporting  improvements  in \nMOET capacity  for  sector  analysis,  quality  improvement,  finance,  and  management,  including \nan  information  system.  The  World  Bank;  bilateral  agencies  from  Australia,  Canada,  Japan, \nNorway,  and  United  Kingdom;  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund;  and  nongovernment \norganizations  have  focused  on  primary  education  and  primary  education  teacher  training.

The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has supported a primary \neducation  development  plan.\n The  United  Nations  Education,  Scientific  and  Cultural \nOrganization  (UNESCO)  and  the  World  Bank  helped  the  Government  prepare  the  National \nEducation for All (EFA) Action Plan, 2003\u20132015, which was approved by the Prime Minister in \n2003.10  Canada,  UNESCO,  and  the  World  Bank  are  assisting  in  its  implementation  through \ncapacity  building  in  provincial  education  planning.  The  national  EFA  planning  process  has \nintegrated \nthe  JICA-supported  primary  education \ndevelopment  plan  and  of  the  ADB-supported  SESMP.  External  assistance  to  the  education \nsector is described in Appendix 3. \n \n12. \nGiven the strategic role of LSE and based on the expected outcomes to be achieved by \nthe LSEDP, MOET has identified three primary areas for further development: (i) improving the \nquality  and  efficiency  of  education;  (ii) increasing  equitable  access  to  education  with  full \nparticipation  of  poor  and  ethnic  minority  students;  and  (iii)  making  education  management \ncapable and efficient under the system of decentralization. Quality improvement is the highest \npolicy priority.  In  this  connection,  MOET  plans  to  develop  fundamental  school  quality  levels \n(FSQL)  for  LSE  as  a  minimum  national  standard  for  school  facilities  and  personnel  for  quality \ncontrol, which is expected to be regularized by a Ministerial decree. ADB\u2019s strategy will support \nthe  Government\u2019s  vision  to  modernize  the  economy  and  reduce  poverty  by  encouraging  pro-\npoor, sustainable growth and structural changes. ADB\u2019s country strategy and program will focus \neducation sector operations on helping the Government achieve  quality universal LSE by 2010 \nand gradually expand upper secondary education.11 This strategy is consistent with ADB\u2019s past \noperations  and  with  the  emphasis  of  other  aid  agencies  on  consolidating  universal  access  to \nquality primary education, and developing higher education.  \n \n\nIII.        THE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nObjectives \n\n \nA. \n \n13. \nThe  Project  design  is  based  on  the  SESMP,  in  accordance  with  the  goal  of  the \nVietnamese Education Development Strategy, 2001\u20132010, and under the overall framework of \nthe  National  EFA  Action  Plan,  2003\u20132015.  The  Project  will  help  reduce  poverty  in  Viet  Nam \nthrough  development  and  improvement  of  LSE.  In  particular,  the  Project  will  improve  quality, \nefficiency,  access  and  equity,  and  management  capacity  in  LSE  by  improving  quality  support \nsystems  nationwide  and  universalizing  LSE  by  2010.  The  specific  project  objectives  are  to  (i) \nimprove  LSE  quality  and  efficiency  by  completing  the  curriculum  and  textbook  renovation  and \nrelated in-service teacher training; (ii) promote equitable access to lower secondary students in \ndisadvantaged  areas;  and  (iii)  strengthen  LSE  management  capacity  under  the  system  of \ndecentralization  from  MOET  to  local  administration:  provincial  departments  of  education  and \ntraining (DOETs), bureaus of education and training (BOETs), and schools.12  \n \nB. \n \n14. \nThe  Project  will  have  three  components:  (i)  improving  LSE  quality  and  efficiency;  (ii) \npromoting  LSE  access  and  equity  in  disadvantaged  areas;  and  (iii)  strengthening  LSE \nmanagement capacity under the system of decentralization. While all provinces will be involved \n                                                 \n9   MOET. 2004. National Primary Education Development Program . Hanoi. \n10  Government of Viet Nam. 2003.

The Project components \nare briefly summarized: \n \n\n1. \n\nImproving  the  Quality  and  Efficiency  of  Lower  Secondary  Education \n(Component 1) \n\n            a. \n\nImproving the Quality of Assessment of Student Learning Outcomes \n\nThe  Project  will  help  MOET  complete  the  introduction  of  the  new  LSE  curriculum and \n15. \ntextbooks  and  related  in-service  teacher  training  up  to  grade  9  begun  under  the  ongoing \nLSEDP.  This  component  aims  to  improve  the  quality  and  efficiency  of  LSE  in  support  of \nuniversalization of quality LSE by 2010. This objective will be carried out in five subcomponents: \n(i) improving the quality of the assessment of student learning outcomes, (ii) improving teaching \nwith  equipment  and  facilities,  (iii)  enhancing  foreign  language  teaching  and  the  use  of  ICT  in \nschools, (iv) supporting  for  vocational  orientation  and  continuing  education,  and  (v)  improving \nteaching contents and methods by continuing the development of instructional materials begun \nunder the LSEDP and the delivery of in-service teacher training. \n \n \n \n16. \nThe  Project  will  continue  and  extend  the  program  of  strengthening  the  assessment  of \nstudent learning outcomes begun under the LSEDP. The objectives of the subcomponent are to \n(i)  develop  the  learning  assessment  standards  for  each  subject  and  grade  of  LSE,  (ii)  try  out \nregulations  of  examination  and  education  quality  assessment,  (iii)  further  develop  sample \nassessment materials, and (iv) develop item banks for all four grades of LSE. In-service training \nwill  be  provided  for  all  involved  in  student  assessment\u2014teachers, principals,  and  DOET and \nBOET staff. In addition, selected senior officials from DOETs will receive higher-level training to \nbecome  specialists  in  assessment.  Exemplary  assessment  materials  will  be  developed  for  all \ngrades and subjects, and all teachers will receive up to 4 hours of training in their use. Modules \non  using  student  learning  outcome  information  to  formulate,  adjust,  and  evaluate  education \nplans  will  be  developed,  and  all  school  principals  will  receive  20  hours  in-service training on \ntheir  use.    Assessment  centers  of  DOETs  and  BOETs  will  be  suitably  equipped.  A  system  of \nannual reporting that analyzes examinations and student responses will be developed. An item \nbank  library  of  assessment  items  for  each  subject  and  grade  will  be  developed  and  made \navailable  in  paper  or  computerized  form.  Student  achievement  at  the  national  level  will \nmonitored  through  a  sample-based  student  learning  outcome  monitoring  system,  so  that \neducation  policy  makers  and  planners  can  monitor  the  status  of  student  achievements  in \nvarious  subjects  nationwide.  The  Project  will  collaborate  with  other  aid-supported  activities  in \n\n                                                 \n13  Effective  1  January  2004,  the  61  provinces  were  increased  to  64,  by  dividing  each  of  three  provinces  into  two \nprovinces.  Two  of  these  three  provinces  are  included  in  component  2:  Dak  Lak  divided  into  Dak  Lak  and  Dak \nNong; and Lai Chau divided into Dien Bien and Lai Chau.  \n\n14  The 28 provinces were selected and prioritized on the basis of indicators related to socioeconomic development, \neducation  development,  social  equity,  and  coverage  by  other  projects  including  the  ADB-financed  Lower \nSecondary Education Development Project and Emergency Assistance for Rehabilitation of Flood Damage Project. \nIt should be noted, however, that the final Government decision on the selected provinces under component 2 is \nsubject to the Government\u2019s further appraisal and approving process.  \n\n\f6\n\n \n\nmeasuring quality including the development of the item banks and the analysis and reporting \nsystems relating to learning achievements.15  \n \n\nb. \n\n Improving Teaching with Equipment and Facilities \n\n \nThe  objectives  of  this  subcomponent  are  to  (i)  upgrade  facilities  of  and  provide \n17. \nequipment  to  provincial  key  schools  and  district  ethnic  minority  boarding  schools;  and  (ii) \nestablish  model  function  rooms  to  demonstrate  how  to  optimize  the  use  of  teaching  aids  with \nstudent-centered, active teaching methods. The Project will upgrade the facilities of and provide \nequipment  to  384  function  rooms  at  64  provincial  key  schools.  A  key  school  is  a  designated \nschool in each of 64 provinces to serve as a model lower secondary school for its excellence in \nteaching  and  learning  facilities  and  conditions.  Details  of  key  schools  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix B.  The  Project  will  also  upgrade  facilities  of  and  provide  equipment  to  54  function \nrooms at nine district ethnic minority boarding schools. Model function rooms will be established \nin 64 key schools to which other schools may send their teachers to learn how to make optimum \nuse of teaching aids. Each key school and ethnic minority boarding school will have six function \nrooms  comprising  three  science  rooms  (physics,  chemistry,  biology),  one  foreign  language \nlaboratory, one computer room, and one library.   \n \n\nc. \n\nEnhancing Foreign Language Teaching and the Use of Information \nand Communication Technology in Schools \n\n \nIn 2003, MOET announced a fresh emphasis on foreign language teaching and learning \n18. \nas  a  strategy  to  facilitate  the  acquisition  of  foreign  knowledge  and  skills,  and  accelerate  the \nprocess of modernization, industrialization, and global integration of Viet Nam. The Project will \nhelp  MOET  ensure  the  quality  and  effectiveness  of  foreign  language  teaching  with  the  new \ncurriculum  and  textbooks  by  renovating  foreign  language  teaching  methods  and  practices \nincluding  in-service  foreign  language  teacher  training;  and  providing  equipment  to  lower \nsecondary  schools  specializing  in  foreign  language  teaching,  and  reference  materials, \nespecially video tapes and foreign language teaching software, to foreign language teachers.  \n \n19. \nThe LSEDP completed the development of the ICT curriculum, which was approved by \nMOET in 2001 as an optional subject in grades 8 and 9, and provided computers for more than \n1,200 lower secondary schools to help introduce ICT in schools. The Project will integrate the \nuse  of  ICT  into  classroom  teaching  practices  by  developing  suitable  materials  on  ICT \napplications and teaching, providing in-service training to about 24,000 teachers, and equipping \nICT centers at MOET and each of the 64 DOETs, so that all lower secondary teachers will have \nICT knowledge and skills by 2010.   \n \n\nd. \n\n Support for Vocational Orientation and Continuing Education \n\n \n20. \nThe  Government\u2019s  sector  goal  of  universalizing  LSE  covers  youths  aged  15\u201318  who \nhave  not  begun  or  who  have  not  completed  a  full  4-year  cycle  of  LSE.  Youths  who  wish  to \ncomplete  LSE  but  who  do  not  or  cannot  return  to  lower  secondary  schools  are  directed to \ncenters  of  vocational  orientation,  continuing  education,  or  supplementary  classes.  To  achieve \nuniversalization of LSE and inform students of vocational and education choices, the Project will \n(i) develop materials on employment and education pathways to be used in all lower secondary \nschools,  and  (ii)  train  mentors  overseas  to  provide  in-service  training  to  teachers  who  will \nprovide vocational information and orientation to students. It will also develop suitable learning \nmaterials  for  returning  students  in  the  modified  curriculum  using  active  teaching  and  learning \n                                                 \n15  The  details  of  the  proposed  aid-supported  activities  are  being  discussed  with  MOET  representatives  at  the \nEducation  Sector  Group  Meetings,  and  concrete  collaborative  arrangements  will  be  firmed  up  during  project \nimplementation.   \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nmethods.  Equipment  will  be  provided  to  continuing  education  centers  (CECs)  and  vocational \nguidance centers (VGCs). \n \n\ne. \n\n Improving Teaching Contents and Methods  \n\n \nThe  purpose  of  this  subcomponent  is  to  continue  and  reinforce  improvements  in \n21. \nteaching contents and methods, by reviewing and completing the nationwide introduction of the \nnew curriculum and textbooks (for grade 9) and related in-service teacher training (for grade 9), \nwhich  began  under  the  LSEDP.  Teaching  contents  need  to  be  more  student-centered  by \naccommodating  individual  student  differences.  Teaching  methods  need  to  emphasize  the \ndevelopment  of  higher  order  thinking  and  life  skills.  The  project  interventions  are  designed  to \nrespond  to  these  challenges  by  developing  instructional  materials  and  delivering  in-service \nteacher  training  and  staff  development.  The  developed  instructional  materials  are  for  use  by \nteachers,  trainers,  mentors,  and  school  principals.  The  provision  of  teaching  methods \nhandbooks,  teachers  guidebooks,  and  self-study  manuals  will  involve  one  guidebook  and  one \nself-study book for each of 15 subjects for about 260,000 teachers, 70,000 manuals for mentors, \n4,500  manuals  for  trainers  on  distance  learning  for  teachers,  and  28,500  manuals  (three \nmanuals  for  each)  for  9,500  school  principals,  focusing  on  clinical  supervision  of  teachers.  In-\nservice  training  and  staff  development  will  focus  on  the  content  and  use  of  the  instructional \nmaterials.  It  will  include  sending  a  number  of  trainers  from  MOET  and  DOETs  on  short-term \ncourses  overseas;  upgrading  the  qualifications  of  about  3,200  mentors;  continuing  training  of \n10,000  unqualified  teachers;  school-based  training  for  over  1,800  teachers  of  music,  arts, \nphysical  education,  and  foreign  languages;  and  continuing  training  for  teacher  support  staff, \nnamely, one librarian and one laboratory assistant per lower secondary school per province.   \n \n \n\nin  Lower  Secondary  Education \n\n \n2. \n\nin \n\nPromoting  Access  and  Equity \nDisadvantaged Areas (Component 2) \n\n \n22. \nThe objective of component 2 is to help students in disadvantaged areas, especially the \npoor  and  ethnic  minorities,  to  gain  equitable  access  to  LSE.  Component  2  has  two \nsubcomponents:  (i)  constructing  and  upgrading  school \nfacilities,  and  (ii)  supporting \ndisadvantaged  students.  Expanding  and  upgrading  school  facilities  will  take  place  in  the  28 \ntargeted  provinces,  which  will  be  divided  into  three  priority  groups  according  to  their  levels  of \ndisadvantage. The 28 priority provinces proposed by  MOET are grouped into three categories. \nThe first priority group will be the 11 disadvantaged provinces with highest inequality in access: \nBinh Phuoc, Cao Bang, Dak Lak, Dak Nong, Dien Bien, Gia Lai, Ha Giang, Lai Chau, Lao Cai, \nNinh  Thuan,  and  Tra  Vinh.  The  second  priority  group  will  be  the  next  nine  disadvantaged \nprovinces with inequality in access: Bac Can, Hoa Binh, Kon Tum, Lam Dong, Lang Son, Phu \nYen,  Son  La,  Tuyen  Quang,  and  Yen  Bai.  The  third  priority  group  will  be  the  next  eight \ndisadvantaged provinces with inequality in access: Binh Dinh, Binh Thuan, Ha Tinh, Nghe An, \nPhu Tho, Quang Nam, Tay Ninh, and Vinh Phuc. An analysis of the education Gini coefficient in \nViet Nam to determine the extent of inequity in access in these provinces is in Supplementary \nAppendix C.  \n\n \na. \n\nConstructing and Upgrading School Facilities \n\n \nThe  Project  will  build  on  the  outcomes  of  the  ongoing  LSEDP  for  constructing  and \n23. \nreplacing  classrooms.  This  subcomponent  will  include  providing  civil  works,  equipment, \nfurniture, sanitary facilities, and water supply for toilets and drinking.  Provision of improved and \nseparate  sanitary  facilities  for  girls,  with  proper  toilets,  sanitation  and  water  supply,  will \ncontribute  to  prevent  female  students  drop  outs.  Civil  works  will  comprise  construction  and \nreplacement of 3,186 rooms\u2014247 schools with 1,482 classrooms equivalent, 247 libraries, 247 \nICT/computer rooms, 247 laboratories, 960 boarding rooms, and 3 multifunction rooms. All the \n\n\f8\n\n \n\nnewly built schools will be equipped with accommodation and board for teachers and students. \nDOETs in the selected provinces will be responsible for finalizing the list of districts, communes, \nand schools to invest in under the Project, taking into account these criteria: absence of a lower \nsecondary  school,  proportion  of  ethnic  minorities  in  the  province  or  district,  poverty  incidence, \ngeneral  conditions  within  mountainous  areas,  and  the  presence  of  schools  with  the  poorest \nphysical facilities. Civil works will be implemented in two stages. Stage I will start in 2006 with \nbuilding 143 schools (63 schools from the first-priority group, 40 from the second-priority group, \nand 40 from the third-priority group). Stage 2 will start in 2007, with building the remaining 104 \nschools (63 from the first-priority group and 40 from the second-priority group).    \n \n\nb. \n\nSupport for Disadvantaged Students \n\n \n24. \nThe objective of this subcomponent is to attract and retain students from disadvantaged \nand  ethnic  minority  communities.  Four  interventions  are designed  to  attain  that  objective:  (i) \ndevelopment  of  relevant  teaching  materials;  (ii)  provision  of  in-service  training  for  teacher \nmentors; (iii) conduct of special studies on matters relating to ethnic minority students; and (iv) \ndirect  support  for  poor,  ethnic  minority,  and  female  students.  Teaching materials that relate to \nthe perception and learning conditions of ethnic minority students will be developed. The Project \nwill  provide  in-service  training  for  teacher  mentors  of  the  targeted  provinces  in  line  with  the \ndevelopment of the foregoing teaching materials. Studies will be supported on matters relating \nto  ethnic  minority  students,  particularly  psychology,  access  to  education,  and  traditional \neducation.  The  subcomponent  will  directly  support  ethnic  minorities,  the  poor,  and  female \nstudents  by  providing  grade  9  textbooks  and  reference  books,  traditional  and  modern  musical \ninstruments  to  ethnic  minority  students  in  boarding  schools,  gender  education  materials  for \nfemale  students,  and  favorable  living  conditions  in  boarding  and  semiboarding  schools, \nincluding the supply of electric pumps, and construction of wells for clean water.  \n \n\n3. \n\nStrengthening Management Capacity of Lower Secondary Education under \nthe System of Decentralization (Component 3) \n\n \n25. \nThe  objective  of  this  component  is  to  strengthen  management  capacity  for  LSE  under \ndecentralization,  particularly  at  BOET  and  school  levels.  Three  subcomponents  will  help  meet \nthat objective: (i) developing FSQLs for LSE; (ii) building capacity for management of LSE; and \n(iii) supporting project management and implementation. \n \n\nDevelopment  of  Fundamental  School  Quality  Levels  for  Lower \n\na. \nSecondary Education \n\n26.  Management  at  all  levels  will  be  guided  by  MOET  regulations  on  minimum  standards, \nknown as the FSQLs, to ensure quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of teaching and learning in \nschools. At the lower secondary level, FSQL objectives are to (i) establish minimum standards \nof  lower  secondary  schools  in  terms  of  school  personnel  and  school  facilities  necessary for \nquality,  effective,  and  efficient  teaching  and  learning;  (ii)  attract  and  retain  students  by \nestablishing  standards  that  make  schools  more  attractive  centers  of  learning;  (iii)  provide  the \nbase  for  local  education  authorities  and  people\u2019s  committees  to  develop  investment  plans, \nespecially  in  disadvantaged  areas;  and  (iv)  progressively  narrow  the  gap  in  education  quality \namong  provinces,  districts,  and  schools.  Through  a  committee  of  experts  from  MOET  and \nrelevant ministries and agencies, the Project will help the Government develop FSQLs for LSE. \nThe expert committee will identify and elaborate FSQLs that are realistic and achievable for all \nlower secondary schools by 2010.  The Project will be in collaboration with the World Bank and \nother  bilateral  aid  agencies,  which  are  developing  FSQLs  for  primary  education  under  the \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nPrimary Education for Disadvantaged Children Project.16 FSQLs for LSE are in Supplementary \nAppendix D.  \n \n\nb. \n\nCapacity Building for Management of Lower Secondary Education \n\n \nThe Project will coordinate its interventions with those of other projects that offer support \n27. \nin capacity building for management including LSE.17 The Project will strengthen management \ncapacity at the district and school levels through programs on (i) ICT training and equipment; (ii) \ninformation,  education,  and  communication  (IEC);  and  (iii)  school  mapping.  ICT  support  will \ninclude training and provision of equipment in managing student records, libraries, examinations, \nand results. The Project will support IEC programs to inform, attract, and retain students in LSE. \nConsulting services and training in school mapping will be provided to related agencies under \nMOET, BOETs and schools to ensure the most efficient location of lower secondary schools on \na  sustainable  basis  and  to  develop  a  database  of  the  equipment  and  facilities  of  lower \nsecondary schools.   \n \n\nc. \n\nProject Management and Implementation Support \n\n \nThis  subcomponent  aims  to  strengthen  management,  monitoring,  and  evaluation \n28. \ncapacity in project implementation from the central to provincial, district, and commune levels. \nInterventions will be in three areas: (i) organizing training courses on project management and \nimplementation  for  project  staff  at  central,  provincial,  district,  and  commune  levels;  (ii) \ndeveloping a project management and implementation network from the center to these levels; \nand (iii) conducting surveys to evaluate the Project impact on LSE. In-service training courses \non  project  management  and  implementation  will  involve  approximately  50  staff  member  from \ncentral and provincial levels. In-service training courses for up to about 300 of staff from districts \nand  communes  will  be  conducted  on  matters  related  to  civil  works  and  procurement  of \nequipment.  A  project  management  and  implementation  network  will  be  established,  using \nproject  evaluation  indicators  to  monitor  the  Project  through  a  system  of  model  data  collection \nforms.  The  Project  will  provide  network  equipment  for  DOETs  and  BOETs  to  develop  an \ninformation network on project management. Three surveys will evaluate the Project impact on \nLSE and identify challenges to be solved during implementation. The surveys will be carried out \nduring the first year of project implementation, the midterm, and the last year of implementation. \n \nC. \n \n29. \nPiloting of Key Schools. The key schools will be the model or demonstration schools, \nillustrating  specific  new  ideas  and  teaching  practices,  the  use  of  ICT,  best  boarding  school \npractices,  in-service  teacher  training,  and  student  learning  assessment.  Key  schools  will  also \nexperiment with paperless or electronic libraries, virtual (computer-driven) science laboratories, \ncomputer networking, and other up-to-date developments in teaching and learning. These ICT-\nrelated  education  instruments  will  be  pilot-tested, and  the  performance of key schools will be \nassessed to study and document the effectiveness of such instruments. \n \n30. \nReturning  Students.  To  attain  universalization  of  LSE  by  2010,  the  Project  will  assist \nMOET in providing for the schooling of youths of 15\u201318 years who have dropped out of LSE or \nmay not have entered a  lower secondary school before. The Project will develop materials on \nemployment and education pathways for use in all lower secondary schools, and train mentors \n\nSpecial Features \n\n                                                 \n16  World Bank. 2002.

Washington, DC. \n17  At  the  provincial  level,  capacity  building  support  is  provided by Canada, United Nation Education, Science and \nCulture  Organization,  and  World  Bank,  under  the  Implementation  of  the  National  Education  For  All Action Plan \nthrough Capacity Building in Provincial Education Planning during 2004\u20132005.   \n\n\f10\n\n \n\nto give in-service training to teachers who will provide vocational information and orientation to \nstudents.  \n \n31. \nVocational  Orientation  and  Tracer  Studies.  Consulting  services  will  help  develop \nvocational  orientation  manuals, which will  enable  teachers  of  grades  8  and  9  to  better  advise \nstudents on employment choices and on subject selection in the transition from lower to upper \nsecondary education. To generate information on  the external efficiency of LSE, training on the \npurpose,  conduct,  and  outcomes  of  tracer  studies  will  also  be  provided  at  the  DOET  level.   \nDOET in turn will offer training at the BOET and school levels. \n \n32. \nDevelopment  of  Fundamental  School  Quality  Levels.  FSQLs,  which  have  been \ndeveloped by MO ET at primary education level, will be further elaborated to establish minimum \nstandards  at  the  lower  secondary  level.  The  FSQLs  will  be  physically  expressed  in  the  247 \nschools  to  be  constructed  or  replaced  under  the  Project,  and  in  the  pilot  key  schools  that the \nProject will support.  By  developing  FSQLs,  the  Project  will  also  assist  in  identifying  minimum \nstandards for boarding schools for ethnic minority children. \n \nD. \n \n33. \nThe total project cost is estimated at $80.0 million equivalent including taxes and duties, \nphysical  and  price  contingencies,  and  interest  charge  on  the  loan  (Table  1).  The  foreign \nexchange cost is estimated at $21.6 million, or 27.0%, and the local currency cost is estimated \nat $58.4 million equivalent or 73.0% of the total cost.

ADB will fund 100.0% of \nthe  foreign  exchange  cost  or  27.0%  of  the  estimated  total  project  cost,  and  $33.4  million \nequivalent of the local currency cost or about 57.2% of the total local  currency cost.  The ADB \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nloan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of \n1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  The  remaining  $25 \nmillion equivalent as counterpart financing, or 31.2% of the total project cost, will be provided by \nthe Government. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 21.6 \n\n            58.4 \n\n         80.0            100 \n\n                    Exchange     Currency         Cost              % \n\n                                                                     Foreign          Local            Total \nSource \nAsian Development Bank                               21.6                33.4             55.0              69      \nGovernment                                                      0.0                25.0             25.0              31      \n \n \nTotal \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n \n35. \nFinancing for  the  local  currency  cost  of  about  $33.4  million  equivalent  is  considered \njustified  under  ADB's  local  currency  financing  policy. 18  From  an  economic  perspective, \nassistance  is  required  to  meet  the  local  currency  cost  of  development  projects  because  a  low \nlevel of per capita income hinders national savings and puts public finance under pressure. The \nGovernment is enhancing revenue collection and improving the efficiency of public expenditure \nand  incentives  for  private  sector  participation  in  revenue-generating  public  sector  projects. \nAlthough these efforts are expected to increase national savings, a significant resource gap will \ncontinue  for  some  time  because  the  country  needs  large  capital  investments.  Thus,  ADB \nassistance  for  project-related  local  currency  expenditures  is  economically  justified.  From  a \ntechnical  perspective,  the  high  level  of  financing for local currency cost is justified because (i) \nmany  small  civil  works  are  scattered  over  numerous  rural  sites,  which  will  utilize  locally \nproduced construction materials; (ii) instructional materials are locally produced; (iii) classroom \nequipment  and  furniture  are  locally  procured;  and  (iv)  the  Project  is  funding  the  in-country \ntraining programs and recruitment of domestic consultants. \n \nF. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n36.  MOET,  as  the  Executing  Agency,  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  coordinating  and \nimplementing all  project  activities.  The  structure  of  project  management  and  implementation \ncomprises (i) at the central level, the central project steering committee (CPSC) and  the central \nproject  coordination  unit  (CPCU);  (ii)  at  the  provincial  level,  the  provincial  project  steering \ncommittee (PPSC) and provincial project implementation unit (PPIU) within DOET, together with \na  coordination  group  from  the  teacher  training  college  for  in-service  training;  and  (iii)  at  the \ndistrict  and  school  levels,  project  implementation  coordinators  within  BOET  and  principals  in \nproject schools. The Project management and implementation structure is in Appendix 5.  \n \n37. \nThe CPSC will be an interministerial steering committee chaired by the vice minister of \nMOET.  The  CPSC  will  provide  overall  guidance  to  the  Project,  monitor  activities  and  outputs, \nand  coordinate  activities.  The  CPSC  will  consist  of  representatives  from  MOET,  Ministry  of \nFinance, Ministry of Planning and Investment, State Bank of Viet Nam, Government Office, and \nState Treasury. MOET will be represented by its relevant department.    \n \n\n                                                 \n18  ADB. 1995. A Review of Lending Foreign Exchange for Local Currency Expenditure on Projects. Manila.  \n\n\f12\n\n \n\n38. \nThe  CPCU  will  oversee  day-to-day  project  implementation,  and  will  be  staffed  with  a \nmanager, a deputy manager, and project staff appointed by MOET from relevant departments \nand agencies of MOET, and other support and administrative staff. The CPCU will be supported \nby  international  and  domestic  consultants.  The  manager  of  the  CPCU  will  be  a  standing \nmember  of  the  CPSC.  The  CPCU  will  be  responsible  for  overall  planning,  management, \nadministration,  and  coordination  of  the  Project.  Specifically,  it  will  undertake  (i)  planning  for \nproject implementation and overall coordination of activities, including monitoring and evaluation \nof  progress;  (ii)  administration,  including  personnel  management,  accounting  and  monitoring \nand reporting needs, for both the Government and ADB; (iii) procurement of goods at the central \nlevel; (iv) hiring of consulting services; and (v) handling of all procurement except for civil works.   \n \n39. \nThe PPSC will be established in each of the 28 priority provinces under Component 2. \nThe committee chairperson will be the Deputy Chairman of the Provincial People\u2019s Committee; \nthe deputy chairperson will be the Director or Deputy Director of DOET; the PPIU manager will \nbe  a  standing  member.  Other  members  will  be  drawn  from  the  provincial  departments  of \nfinance, planning and investment, civil works, with some specialists from DOET.  The PPSC will \nassist  the  PPIU  in  land  planning  and  acquisition,  school  construction,  supplying  counterpart \nfunding for civil works, and maintaining classrooms and equipment. \n \n40. \nThe  PPIU  will  be  established  in  each  of  the  64  DOETs.  The  Deputy  Director  of  DOET \nwill be the unit manager; members will be specialists from relevant sections of DOET (finance, \nplanning, personnel, secondary education), and the Director of the Teacher Training College will \nalso  be  the  deputy  manager  in  charge  of  provincial  in-service  teacher  training.  PPIUs will be \nresponsible  for  (i)  organizing  and  supervising  the  construction  programs  prepared  by  the \ndistricts; (ii) local competitive bidding (LCB) for civil works; (iii) project implementation support, \nincluding  in-service  training;  (iv)  cooperation  with  CPCU  and  BOETs  in  implementing  the \nProject; and (v) receiving monthly reports from BOETs and submitting its own monthly reports \non project implementation to  the  CPCU.  The  PPIU  will  be  provided  with  suitable  facilities  and \nequipment.  \n \n41. \nA group of project implementation coordinators will be established under the direction of \nBOET.  BOETs  will  be  responsible  for  receiving  and  distributing  in-service training materials to \nlower  secondary  schools,  and  CECs  and  VGCs,  and  will  coordinate  the  organization  of  in-\nservice training with the PPIU. Principals will be responsible for implementing, monitoring, and \nevaluating all project activities in their schools, as well as maintaining facilities and classrooms \nprovided  under  the  Project.  Commune  people\u2019s  committees will assist  the school principals in \nimplementing and monitoring the Project in each school. \n\n \n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n \n42. \n2010. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 6. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement  \n\nThe Project will be implemented in two stages over 6 years, from January 2005 to end-\n\n \n43. \nAll  ADB-financed  goods  and  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  As  civil  works  will  be  small  in  amount  and  scattered  across  the \ncountry, they will be awarded on the basis of LCB following Government procedures acceptable \nto  ADB.  The  CPCU  will  be  responsible  for  procurement  including  international  competitive \nbidding  (ICB)  for  goods,  LCB  (except  for  civil  works),  and  international  shopping.  Using  LCB \nprocedures  or  direct  purchase,  the  PPIUs  will  procure  the  civil  works,  instructional  materials, \nand  small  quantities  of  goods  such  as  office  consumables.  State-owned enterprises that may \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nparticipate  in  bidding  under  the  Project  must  be  financially  autonomous  and  operate  under \ncommercial laws. The indicative procurement package is in Appendix 7.  \n \n\na. \n\nEquipment and Materials \n\n \nSupply contracts for goods estimated at $500,000 equivalent or more will be awarded on \n44. \nthe  basis  of  ICB.  Supply  contracts  for  goods  such  as  vehicles  and  computers  (other  than \ninstructional materials) costing less than $500,000 equivalent but more than $100,000 will follow \ninternational shopping procedures. Supply contracts for instructional materials costing less than \n$500,000 equivalent but more than $100,000 will follow LCB procedures. Minor items including \ninstructional  materials  costing  less  than  $100,000  equivalent  may  be  procured  by  direct \npurchase.  Supply  contracts  for  teachers  manuals  and  handbooks  may  be  awarded  to  the \nappropriate  education  publishing  houses  on  the  basis  of  LCB  if  the  amount  is  less  than \n$500,000 equivalent but more than $100,000, or by direct purchase if the amount is less than \n$100,000.  \n\n \nb. \n\nCivil Works \n\n \nCivil  works  will  consist  of  construction  and  replacement  of  school  classrooms  and \n45. \nfacilities.  The  estimated  unit  cost  is  $10,000  per  classroom  or  facility,  including  design  and \nconstruction supervision. Technical design study and supervision of construction quality below \n$100,000 will be procured by direct purchase. The civil works are spread over lower secondary \nschools in 28 disadvantaged provinces. They will be financed by ADB and the Government, and \nwill be awarded on the basis of LCB, following government procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n \n\nc. \n\nAdvance Action \n\n \n46.  MOET will carry out advance action for procuring equipment and civil works. MOET will \nprepare  the  procurement  plan  for  equipment  and  furniture  for  CPCU  and  PPIUs  so  that \nprocurement can take place immediately upon loan effectiveness. The Government and MOET \nhave been advised that ADB's approval of advance action will not commit ADB to subsequently \napprove the Project or to finance the procurement cost. \n \n47. \nThere  is  one  package  of  the  consulting  services  to  be  selected  using  advance \nrecruitment  action,  comprising  40  person-months  of  international  consultants  and  450  person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consultants  at  the  estimated  amount  of  $1.13  million  (0.72  million  of \ninternational  consulting  services  and  0.41  million  of  domestic  consulting  services.  General \nexpertise required areas: education quality improvements, ICT application to schools, education \nmanagement,  planning,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation,  school  mapping,  construction \nengineering and supervision, and gender and ethnic minority education. Advance action would \nbe up to evaluation of technical proposals.  \n\n \n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n48. \nConsulting  services  have  been  kept  to  a  minimum.  The  Project  will  use  consultants  to \nimprove  the  quality  support  systems  nationally,  promote  access  and  equity  in  disadvantaged \nprovinces and districts, and strengthen management of LSE. A maximum of 40 person-months \nof  international  and  450  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  will  be  needed. \nInternational  consultants  will  introduce  active  learning-teaching  methods, student assessment \nmethods,  and  ICT  in  schools  (component  1);  and  management  and  planning,  monitoring  and \nevaluation, and school mapping (component 3). Domestic consultants will be needed in active \nlearning-teaching methods, student assessment methods, education equipment, and the use of \nICT (component 1); construction engineering and supervision (including resettlement aspects), \n\n\f14\n\n \n\nand  gender  and  ethnic  minority  education  (component  2);  and  management  and  planning, \nmonitoring  and  evaluation,  school  mapping,  and  finance  and  procurement  (component  3).  All \nADB-financed  consultants  will  be  selected  through  a  firm,  using  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  MOET,  through  the \nCPCU,  will  be  responsible  for  hiring  consultants.  Consulting  service  requirements  and  the \noutline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 8. \n \n\n5. \n\nStaff Development (Training) \n\n \n49. \nExtensive  in-country  training,  and  combined  in-country  and  overseas  training  will  be \nprovided  to  upgrade  the  skills  and  knowledge  of  qualified  individuals  who  will  be  involved  in \nimplementing the Project. In consultation with ADB,  the CPCU will finalize criteria for selecting \nfrom  among  teachers,  school  principals,  and  education  officers  the  candidates  for  training \nduring  the  first  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness.  International  short-term  training  will  focus  on \nspecialized  subjects  related  to  quality  improvement  programs  to  be  implemented  under  the \nProject.  The  Government  will  follow  the  criteria  agreed  upon  with  ADB  on  the  award  of \ninternational fellowships. The CPCU will be provided with a list of (i) the nominated candidates, \n(ii)  their  qualifications,  (iii)  nominated  institutions  and  agencies,  and  (iv)  detailed  cost  of  the \nproposed  courses.  In-country  training  will  be  held  at  MOET-DOET  facilities  or  other  relevant \ntraining  institutions  selected  from  among  reputable  training  institutions  on  a  contractual basis. \nThe indicative staff development (training) program is in Appendix 9. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n50. \nTo expedite project implementation through the timely release of ADB\u2019s funds for eligible \nexpenditures, a dollar imprest account will be established by the Government at a commercial \nbank designated by the State Bank of Viet Nam and acceptable to ADB. The imprest account \nwill  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook dated 1 January 2001. The initial imprest account will have a ceiling, \nthe equivalent of $5,500,000 or estimated expenditure for the first six months of the Project. In \nview of the large number of small contracts involved, the statement of expenditures procedures \nwill be used for expenditures of $100,000 equivalent or less.  \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting and Auditing \n\n \n51.  MOET will maintain separate  records and accounts for the Project to identify goods and \nservices  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds.  Project  accounts,  including  financial  statements, \nstatement  of  expenditures,  and  imprest  account  records,  will  be  audited  annually  by \nindependent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Loan \nAgreement.  The  auditors\u2019  report  and  copies  of  the  certified  accounts  and  related  financial \nstatements, including the auditors\u2019 opinion on the use of loan proceeds, on compliance with loan \ncovenants,  and  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  under  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures \nprocedure, will be submitted to ADB in English not later than 9 months after the close of each \nfiscal year. The independent external auditing services will be financed from the loan proceeds.  \n \n\n8. \n\nReporting \n\n \n52. \nThe CPCU will prepare quarterly reports on project implementation and submit them to \nADB within 30 days after each quarter. The provincial reports will be submitted to the CPCU and \ncompiled  into  a  quarterly  report  to  be  submitted  to  MOET  and  ADB.  The  reports  will  be  in  a \nformat  acceptable  to  ADB  and  will  indicate,  among  other  matters,  progress  made  against \nestablished targets, problems encountered during the last quarter, steps taken and proposed to \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nbe  taken  to  resolve  problems,  compliance  with  loan  covenants,  and  proposed  program  of \nactivities  for  the  succeeding  quarter.  Within  3  months  after  physical  completion  of  the  project, \nthe  CPCU  will  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  providing  details  of  project \nimplementation, accomplishments, benefits, and impact. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n53. \nTo  monitor  achievements,  MOET\u2019s  existing  project  performance  management  system \nwill be improved and institutionalized within MOET to monitor and evaluate implementation and \ndevelopment impact at various stages of the project cycles. Project performance monitoring will \nfocus  on  implementation  plans,  targets,  and  their  fulfillment.  Performance  evaluations  will \nexamine the impact of interventions (such as improved participation and completion rates due to \ncivil  works  or  provision  of  equipment  and  learning  materials,  transition  to  upper  secondary \neducation), problems and constraints faced, the reasons for them and their solutions. Provinces \nwill  be  responsible  for  submitting  semiannual  monitoring  reports  to  the  CPCU, and evaluation \nvisits and studies. Each province will conduct at least one evaluative study per year  and submit \na  report  to  the  CPCU.  At  district  and  school  levels,  BOETs,  in  coordination  with  schools,  will \nsubmit the necessary information to be established as project monitoring indicators to the PPIUs \nas required for semiannual monitoring reports and annual evaluative studies. Other evaluative \nstudies should be conducted as required if problems arise in implementation. International and \ndomestic  specialists  in  monitoring,  evaluation,  and  quality  control  will  train  provincial  staff  in \nmonitoring and evaluation techniques for use in the Project. Project performance and monitoring \nindicators are in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n\n \n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n \nADB and the Government will jointly undertake semiannual reviews of the Project. The \n54. \nreviews  will  assess  progress  in  each  component,  identify  difficulties  or  constraints  and  help \ndetermine  ways  to  overcome  them.  A  report  will  be  prepared  and  submitted  to  ADB  and  the \nGovernment. The CPCU and PPIU coordinators will be a primary source of information for these \nreviews.  The  Government  and  ADB  will  conduct  midterm  review  in  the  last  quarter  of  year  3. \nThe midterm review will inform planning for the second half of the Project. It will (i) review the \nscope,  design,  and  project  implementation  arrangements;  (ii)  identify  any  necessary  changes; \n(iii)  assess  performance  against  targets  and  benchmarks;  (iv)  review  compliance  with  loan \ncovenants; and (v) recommend any changes in project design or implementation arrangements. \nThe findings will be discussed at the midterm seminar to be attended by MOET leadership and \nsenior staff, representatives of government ministries and agencies concerned, the consultants, \nand ADB.   \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \nA.   \n\nProject Benefits \n\n1.   \n\nEducational and Technical Benefits \n\n \n The  educational  and  technical  benefits  are  project  outputs  that  directly  or  indirectly \n55. \nimpact on LSE in particular and the education system in general. The Project will help upgrade \nthe LSE subsector, and achieve the Government\u2019s goal of universalizing quality LSE by 2010. In \nparticular, the Project is expected to contribute to important long-term benefits, including (i) the \nadoption  of  student-centered  teaching  contents  and  teaching  methods  that  emphasize  the \ndevelopment of higher order thinking and life skills; (ii) periodic assessments of student learning \noutcomes that provide important feedback to teachers, textbook writers, curriculum developers, \nand school administrators at all levels; (iii) increases in the number of classrooms and facilities \n\n\f16\n\n \n\nat  the  lower  secondary  level;  and  (iv)  improvements  in  decentralized  education  management \nthat places more decision-making responsibility on provincial and district administrators.   \n\n \n2.  \n\nEfficiency Benefits \n\n \nThe  Project  will  directly  improve  the  efficiency  of  LSE  in  a  number  of  concrete, \n56. \nmeasurable ways. It will increase enrollment rates at the lower secondary level by constructing \nand replacing classrooms, and at the same time providing direct support to attract and retain  in \nLSE  students  from  disadvantaged  and  ethnic  minority  groups.  Low  internal  and  external \nefficiencies  will  be  overcome  through  project  interventions.  Dropout  and  grade  repetition  rates \nwill  be  reduced  by  the  improved  instructional  environment  through  better  teacher-student \ninteraction,  and  high-quality  textbooks  and  instructional  materials,  which  in  turn  will  increase \ninternal efficiency. The Project will increase  the external efficiency of LSE. External efficiency in \neducation is  usually  measured  by  the  labor  market  performance  of  school  graduates.  At  the \nlower levels, however, the most sensible measure of external efficiency is success in moving to \nthe  next  higher  school  level.  Quality  improvements  envisaged  under  the  Project  will  result  in \nhigher  overall  test  scores  and  subsequently  higher  transition  rates  to  upper  secondary \neducation.  \n \n\n3. \n\nDirect Beneficiaries \n\n \n57. \nIn  component  1,  in-service  training  will  cover  improvement  in  (i)  teaching  methods\u2014 \napproximately 7,600 teachers, 250 principals, and 500 support staff, and 300 officers of BOETs \nand  600  officers  of  DOET,  with  upgrading  courses  for  approximately  15,000  teachers;  (ii)  the \nquality of assessment of student learning\u20144,800 teachers, 2,400 principals,  1,200 supervisors, \n1,600 officers of BOETs, and 3,200 officers of DOETs; (iii) the use of ICT in schools\u201430,000 \nteachers; and (iv) vocational orientation and continuing education\u20144,500 school staff and 750 \nprincipals.  In  component  2,  physical capacity will  be  expanded  to  accommodate  about  91,000 \nadditional disadvantaged students. Support for disadvantaged and ethnic minority students will \nbe extended to about 175,000 disadvantaged students and 100,000 returning students.  About \n10,000 teachers will be upgraded to work with disadvantaged students. In component 3, direct \nbeneficiaries  in  FSQL  will  be  6,110  personnel\u20143,050  principals,  1,220  supervisors,  1,220 \nBOETs staff, 610 DOETs  staff, and 10 other education officials. In-service training on planning \nand  management  will  benefit  an  estimated  5,500  staff.  In  education  and  school  management, \nabout  15,100  staff  will  be  trained.  Project  implementation  training  will  benefit  390  principals, \n1,040 DOETs staff and 50 other education officials. \n \nB.  \n \n58. \nThe  financial  sustainability  of  the  Project  is  gauged  by  (i)  the  availability  of  adequate \nfunds  to  finance  project  expenditures,  and  (ii)  the  financial  incentive  necessary  to  ensure \nparticipation  in  the  Project.  The  favorable  economic  outlook  for  Viet  Nam  and  increased \nspending in education (particularly LSE) indicate that the government budget will continue to be \nthe principal source of funds for expanding LSE.19 Viet Nam\u2019s current policy of implicit subsidy \nto lower secondary schooling is rooted in the notion that education at this level is a public good \nwith high social benefits. From the medium-term budget framework, both government and party \ngoals  for  education  call  for  increases  in  the  amount  of  fiscal  spending  allocated  to  the sector. \nRecent  and  projected  expenditure  figures  for  education  and  training  between  1995  and  2010 \nindicate that the Government has protected and increased expenditures on education. While still \n\nFinancial Sustainability Analysis \n\n                                                 \n19  From  1992  to  1998,  the  government  expenditure  as  percent  of  GDP  grew  from  1.8%  to  3.5%.  The  Secondary \nEducation Sector Master Plan indicates that government spending on education will increase from 18% (2003) to \n20% (2010) of the total government expenditure.  \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nEconomic and Poverty (Impact) Analysis \n\nalarmingly high in some areas, poverty incidence at the household level is declining. Evidence \nfrom the 2002 Vietnamese household and living standard survey confirms that households are \nwilling  and  able  to  pay  fees  and  other  costs  of  lower  secondary  schooling  (footnote  1). Both \nfiscal  and  private  capacity  to  pay  the  costs  of  expansion  is  expected  to  ensure  project \nsustainability. Fiscal impact analyses were conducted to determine the effect of project costs on \ngovernment budgets.  Based on the projections, the Project has minimal impact on government \nresources, both during the project period and thereafter. The financial sustainability analysis is \nin Appendix 10. \n \nC. \n \n59. \nThe economic outlook for Viet Nam continues to be favorable, as economic expansion is \ndriven  by  buoyant  domestic  demand,  reflecting  strong  confidence  and  positive  expectations \namong local businesses and households. To remain regionally competitive, the country needs \nto build a flexibly educated, mobile, and dynamic labor force. The Project is expected to make a \ndirect and positive contribution to economic development through improvements to the human \ncapital base of Viet  Nam and to yield direct social benefits to students and their families. Since \nthere  are  no  direct  financial  incentives  for  participants  in  this  Project,  a  standard  cost-benefit \nanalysis cannot be done. For the students benefited by the Project, a full financial internal rate \nof  return  analysis  cannot  be  undertaken  since  the  paucity  of  data  on  real  earnings makes it \ndifficult  to  monetize  the returns.  Nevertheless,  school  enrollments  have  continued  to  increase, \ngiving  evidence  of  sufficient  financial  incentives  for  households  to  decide  in  favor  of  enrolling \ntheir  children  in  school.  A  reverse  cost-benefit  analysis  was  used  to  calculate  the  potential \nreturns  on  the  Project.  Benefits  are  expected  from  two  main  sources:  (i)  reduced  costs  in \nproviding  lower  secondary  schooling,  and  (ii)  improved  productivity  of  the  labor  force.  Total \nproject benefits are estimated at about $44 million per year. At a hurdle rate of 12% (real rate of \nreturn),  the  Project  can  be  considered  a  sound  investment.    Economic  and  poverty  impact \nanalysis is in Appendix 11. \n \nD.  \n \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment and Resettlement \n\n \n60. \nA review of the Project\u2019s environmental impacts showed no significant adverse effects. \nIndividual, school-level, environmental considerations will be incorporated into all project-related \nschool  construction  during  the  implementation  phase.  The  designs  of  the  new  schools  will \nrequire minimum maintenance although maintenance programs will be specifically addressed. \nConstruction will not adversely affect the environment. Water supply for toilets and drinking will \nbe taken care of to promote good health and minimize environmental impact.  \n \n61. \nClassrooms will be replaced in existing sites. New schools will be constructed on vacant \nand idle public land or commune reserve land, and mostly adjacent to existing schools. In the \nevent that no vacant public land is available and community or household land might be needed, \na  detailed  community  decision-making  process  for  site  selection  must  be  strictly  followed  to \nsafeguard  the  communities\u2019  interests.  First,  the  commune  will  identify  possible  land  through  a \nprocess of household level consultation, including a process of grievance redress. Second, the \ndistrict people\u2019s committee will confirm that (i) the land selected has no housing or enterprises, \nno encroachers or squatters; (ii) the contribution of land by any one household is not more than \n5% of the household\u2019s total landholding; (iii) the contributors are not poor; (iv) the commune will \nguarantee  to  replace  any  lost  assets  at  replacement  cost  and  replace  any  lost  income  or \nlivelihoods,  and  compensation  will  be  paid  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \n\n\f18\n\n \n\ninvoluntary resettlement;20 and (v) the people affected will  agree to the arrangement verbally or \nin  writing.  Before  the  award  of  civil  works  contracts , the PPIUs will check that  the  procedures \nare followed and  will submit  a  written  report  to  ADB  together  with  contract  documentation  for \nADB\u2019s endorsement. ADB review missions will make spot checks to ensure that the community \nsite selection process has been followed. The resettlement framework is in Appendix 12. \n \n             2.         Social Analysis \n \n62. \nA  detailed  social  analysis  during  project  preparation indicated that  the  Project  has  no \nadverse  social  impact.  The  Project  is  classified  as  a  poverty  intervention  and  is  expected  to \nraise  incomes,  especially  of  families  in  the  28  selected  provinces,  by  improving  children\u2019s\u2019 \naccess  to  LSE.  The  Project  will  improve  social  conditions  in  the  community  where  the  project \nschools are located. Under component 2, the Project will support construction and replacement \nof  school  facilities,  including  classrooms,  toilets,  laboratories,  and  libraries  in  the  28 \ndisadvantaged provinces. This support will give LSE access to the poor, ethnic minorities, and \ngirls. Increased access to LSE is expected to have a positive impact on agricultural productivity \nand  rural  household  income,  and  also  to  increase  nonagricultural  income  in  rural  areas.  In \nparticular, educating girls will not only increase their income-earning capacity, but also improve \ntheir reproductive health, reduce infant and child mortality, and benefit both current and future \ngenerations of Vietnamese households.  The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is \nin Appendix 13, and  the ethnic minorities and gender action plan prepared in accordance with \nADB\u2019s policies on gender and development and indigenous peoples is in Appendix 14.   \n \nE.  \n\nProject Risks \n\nThe risks derive from the magnitude of the Project, involving as many as 28 provinces \n63. \nfor  civil  works  and  all  provinces  for  quality  enhancement  activities.  Risks  are also  associated \nwith the involvement of a range of implementing units from the central ministry level to provincial \nand even district levels. Mitigating factors include MOET\u2019s substantial experience in managing \nthree  World  Bank  and  four  ADB-financed  projects.  Most  CPCU  members  and  staff  will  be \nreassigned  from  the  ongoing  LSEDP  and  many  of  the  same  people  who  participated  in  these \nprojects will have key roles in the present Project. The responsibilities of the CPCU and PPIU of \nthis project are similar to the ones under the LSEDP. Implementation will be facilitated because \nexperienced  people  in  provincial  DOETs  are  available  to  participate  in  the  Project.  Project \nimplementation  manuals  for  all  levels  of  responsibilities  will  be  prepared.  All  project  risks  are \nmanageable. \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nA. \n \n64. \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n(i) \n\nThe  Government  will  provide  counterpart  funds  for  project  implementation  on \ntime.  The  Government  will  make  timely  submissions  of  annual  budgetary \nappropriation  requests  and  ensure  prompt  disbursement  of  appropriate  funds \nduring each year of project implementation. \n\n \n(ii)  Within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government,  through  MOET,  will \nconduct  baseline  studies  and  surveys  to  establish  appropriate  indicators  for \nmonitoring  and  evaluating  project  implementation.  Further,  the  Government, \n\n                                                 \n20  ADB. 1998. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. In Handbook on Resettlement. Manila (Appendix 1).  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n19\n\nthrough  MOET,  will  undertake  periodic  surveys,  in  the  third  and  fifth  years of \nproject  implementation,  to  monitor  relevant  indicators  and  to  revise  or  improve \nimplementation schemes, where necessary. \n\n(iii)  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government,  through  MOET,  will \n\nestablish a PPIU in each of the 64 provinces.  \n\n(iv)  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government,  through  MOET,  will \nsubmit  to  ADB  a  list  of  the  names  and  location  of  the  designated  key  lower \nsecondary  schools  in  64  provinces,  including  the  three  designated  key  schools \nlocated in the new provinces, and nine district ethnic minority boarding schools. \n\n(v)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the Government, through MOET, will have \nestablished  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval,  criteria  for  selecting  candidates \nfor in-country and overseas training or study tours. \n\n(vi)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the Government, through MOET, will have \nidentified  the  first  year  of  school  construction  and  replacement  program  as  set \nout under Component 2 of the Project. \n\n(vii) \n\nThe  Government,  through  MOET,  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  a  school \nmapping  plan,  containing  information  on  the  location  of  new  schools  to  be \nconstructed. School mapping must show that new schools will be constructed in \nareas  requiring  access  for  primary  school  graduates  from  the  poor,  ethnic \nminority, and disadvantaged people. School mapping must be completed at least \n6 months before construction begins.  \n\n(viii)  The  Government,  through  MOET,  will  ensure  that  construction  of  new  schools \nwill be carried out on vacant public land or commune reserve land. If  no vacant \npublic land is available and community or household land might be needed, the \nGovernment  will  ensure  that  (a)  subproject  resettlement  plans  (RPs)  will  be \nprepared  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement  framework  agreed  upon  between \nADB  and  MOET,  (b)  RPs  will  be  prepared  in  consultation  with  affected  people \nand disclosed to them before forwarding to ADB for approval, (c) ADB review and \napproval of subproject RPs will be a condition for award of civil works contracts, \nand (d) subprojects that entail only category B or C resettlement impacts will be \nselected. Further, in the event that community or household land will be used, the \nGovernment will ensure that compensation will be paid in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995). \n\n(ix) \n\n \n(x) \n\nThe Government, through MOET, will ensure  that priority will be given to gender \nand  ethnic  minority  development  through  the  implementation  of  the  gender  and \nethnic  minorities  action  plan,  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policies  on \nGender  and  Development  and  Indigenous  Peoples.

The principal responsibilities of MOET are to (i) set policies and priorities \nwithin a broad planning framework, (ii) review plans of provincial departments of education and \ntraining (DOETs) and bureaus of education and training (BOETs), (iii) determine overall financial \ncosts, and (iv) monitor and supervise the overall education management process. At the DOET \nlevel,  principal  responsibilities  are  to  (i)  develop  provincial-level  medium-term  plans,  (ii) \nadminister upper secondary schools, and (iii) monitor and supervise the work of BOETs. At the \nBOET  level,  principal  responsibilities  are  to  (i)  develop  medium-term  plans  based  on  data \ncollected  at  commune  and  school  levels,  and  (ii)  administer  primary  and  lower  secondary \neducation. \n  \nThe  education  system  has  expanded  rapidly  over  the  last  decade.  During  1993\u20132002, \n3. \nthe net enrollment ratio (NER) for primary education increased from 86.7% in 1993 to 90.1% in \n2002; for lower secondary education, the increase was from 30.1% to 72.1% in 2002; while for \nupper secondary education, the NER rose from 7.2% to 41.8%.1 The increase in enrollment has \nbeen assisted by a marked growth in public investment in education. During 1992\u20132000, public \nspending  on  education  as  measured  in  constant  prices  increased  fourfold,  and  education  \nalmost doubled its share of gross domestic product from 1.8% in 1992 to 3.4%. This spending \nhas  been  augmented  by  programs  of  official  development  assistance,  from  which  education \nreceived 6.3% in 2001.2 \n \n4. \nAchievements  in  lower  secondary  education  over  the  period  1991/92\u20132002/03  are \nsummarized  in  Table  A2.  Besides  the  increases  in  enrollment  rates,  other  significant \ndevelopments are as follows: (i) internal efficiency of the system improved with completion rates \nin lower secondary education increasing from 39.8% in 1991 to 69.5% in 1999, repetition rates \ndecreasing  from  8.5%  in  1991  to  1.1%  in  2002,  and  dropout rates decreasing from 21.2% in \n1991  to  5.8%  in  2002;  (ii)  the  transition  rate  from  primary  education  to  lower  secondary \neducation rose from 78% in 1991 to 95.5% in 2002; (iii) student-teacher ratios declined; (iv) the \nproportion  of  qualified  teachers  increased  from  72.1%  in  1991  to  90.8%  in  2002;  and  (v)  the \npercentage  of  female  students  rose  to  slightly  more  than  that  of  male  students.  However,  the \ntable  also  indicates  that  some  principal  challenges  still  confront  lower  secondary  education. \nGreater efforts must be made to bring the repetition and dropout rates down from the present \n1.1%  and  5.8%,  respectively,  to  raise  the  completion  rate  to  100%,  and  further  upgrade \nteachers\u2019 qualifications since one out of 10 teachers is still unqualified.  \n\n                                                 \n1   Joint  Donor  Report  to  the  Vietnam  Consultative  Group  Meeting.  2003.

Data from the 2002 Viet Nam Household Living \nStandards  Survey  provides  evidence  of  these  challenges,  showing  marked  differences  in \nenrollment  in  lower  secondary  education  due  to  income,  ethnic  origin,  and  urban  or  rural \ndimension.  Differences  in  the  NER  by  household  income  level  are  marked:  in  2002,  53.8%  of \nthe poorest quintile and 85.8% of the richest quintile were enrolled in lower secondary education. \nWhile Kinh and Chinese had a NER of 75.9%, the NER of ethnic minorities was 48.0%. For the \nurban population, the lower secondary NER was 80.8%, compared with the 69.9% for the rural \npopulation (footnote 2). \n \n6. \nMOET has placed a high priority on improving the quality of education, as evidenced by \nits  investments  in  the  Lower  Secondary  Education  Development  Project 3 with emphasis on \ncurriculum and textbook development, and related teacher in-service training, and in the Lower \nSecondary Education Teacher Training Project.4 The greatest challenges in improving quality lie \nin (i) in-service training of unqualified teachers and removing from teaching unqualified teachers \nwho are not suitable for upgrading; (ii) ensuring all students are provided with the full curriculum \nby  providing  an  adequate  supply  of  subject  teachers  for  all  schools,  especially  for  music, \nphysical education, foreign languages, and arts and crafts; (iii) ensuring that all students have \nthe  full  number  of  class  contact  hours  per  week  or  year;  and  (iv)  improving  the  teaching  and \nlearning facilities in schools: libraries, laboratories, and computer rooms.  \n \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB. 1997.

Real gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to grow \nby  around  7%  in  2004  and  7.5%  in  2005  (Asian  Development  Outlook  2004). The sustained \neconomic  expansion  is  driven  by  buoyant  domestic  demand,  reflecting  strong  confidence  and \npositive  expectations  among  local  businesses  and  households.  Overall,  the  Government\u2019s \neconomic reforms underpin the positive developments. Consumer price inflation has moved to \nabout 3%, with non-food inflation having the greatest impact. Viet Nam is increasingly an open \neconomy with the price of its internationally tradable goods mainly determined in world markets. \nWith a stable nominal exchange rate, Viet Nam is currently one of the cheapest countries in the \nworld  in  dollar  terms.  These  different  perspectives  have  positive  implications  for  government \nrevenues over the life of the proposed Project.  \n \nB. \n \nGovernment  spending  on  education  at  all  levels,  both  in  absolute  terms  and  as  a \n3. \npercentage  of  overall  government  allocation,  has  significantly  increased  since  the  1990s.  This \nincrease has had a direct impact on access and participation levels. Table A10.1 shows trends \nin Government and non-government expenditures for the education sector as a whole between \n1992  and  1998.  The  trends  indicate  that  household  and  government  expenditures  are  roughly \nequal.  This  confirms  that  households  are  willing  and  able  to  pay  fees  and  other  costs  of \nschooling.   \n \n\nGovernment Funding for Education \n\nTable A10.1: Trends in Government and Nongovernment Expenditure \n\n    on Education between 1992 and 1998 \n\n \n\nItem \nGovernment \n\nPer capita expenditure ($\u2018000) in \nconstant 1994 prices  \nPercent of GDP \n\nHousehold \n\nPer capita expenditure ($\u2018000) in \nconstant 1994 prices  \nPercent of GDP \n\n1992 \n \n39.2 \n\n  1.8 \n \n \n\n1993 \n \n58.1 \n\n1994 \n \n71.3 \n\n  2.6 \n \n  32.7 \n\n   2.9 \n \n \n\n1995 \n \n82.8 \n\n   3.0 \n \n \n\n1996 \n \n80.4 \n\n   2.7 \n \n \n\n1997 \n \n\n100.0 \n\n     3.2 \n \n \n\n1998 \n \n 115.0 \n\n     3.5 \n \n  108.4 \n\n \n\n 1.7 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    3.4 \n\nGDP = gross domestic product \nSources: Second Lower Secondary Education Development Project (SLSEDP) calculations. \n\n \nDespite the increasing percentage of individual households, income spent on education,  \n4. \nlower  secondary  education  (LSE)  in  Viet  Nam  is  now  financed  for  the  most  part  by  a  direct \ngovernment  budget.  Under  the  Project,  it  is  proposed  that  communities  and  parents  finance \nabout 12% of the total project cost, mainly in cash contribution toward the purchase of textbooks \nand  in  kind  contribution  toward  operation  and  maintenance  of  project  facilities.  This  extent  is \ncomparable with that in the Lower Secondary Education Development Project (LSEDP), where \ncommunities provided $9.5 million, or 13% of the project cost.   \n \nTable  A10.2  presents  calculations  of  (average)  unit  fiscal  costs  per  student  for  \n5. \nacademic year 2000/01 for both lower and upper secondary education.

Contrary to typical patterns, the unit (fiscal only) cost at the \nupper  secondary  level  in  Viet  Nam  is  below  the  unit  cost  of  lower  secondary  students.  This \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n41 \n\nreversal is evidence of the priority accorded by the government to LSE, through reallocation of \nthe subsidy from upper secondary education to LSE. \n \n\nTable A10.2: Average Fiscal Costs per Student-Year, 1993\u20132000 \n\nItem \nLower Secondary \n     D(\u2018000) \n     $ \nUpper Secondary \n     D(\u2018000) \n     $ \n\n1993 \n \n169 \n15.9 \n \n429 \n40.5 \n\n1994 \n \n 235 \n21.5 \n \n 483 \n 44.1 \n\n1998 \n \n 337 \n27.4 \n \n 448 \n36.4 \n\n2000 \n \n 448 \n30.7 \n \n 442 \n30.4 \n\nSource:  World  Bank.  1997.

Policy  supports  this  funding  shift,  coupled  with  the imposition of cost \nrecovery  at  higher  levels  of  education.  Shares  to  education  in  all  government  spending  have \nsteadily  risen  in  the  past  decade.  Shortfalls  in  the  government\u2019s  ability  to  finance  school \nexpansion and quality improvement in Viet Nam are met through efficiency improvements and \nfrom  borrowing.  As  Viet  Nam  has  a  long  history  of  borrowing  for  education,  this  action  is  not \nexpected  to  have  an  adverse  effect  on  the  poor  through  the  added  tax  burden.  Government \nrevenue  for  loan  repayment  is  raised  primarily  through  economic  growth  that  now  enjoys  an \nenviable  record.  In  fact,  cost  recovery  through  tuition  and  related  user  fees  have  slowly  been \neliminated  as  they  have  been  shown  to  have  a  negative  impact  on  enrollment  growth, \nparticularly among the poor. The Government has decided to set school fees and other charges \nso  that  the  full  costs  of  supply  of  LSE  are  not  completely  met  by  students  or  their  families. \nDespite  this  policy,  recent  evidence  from  the  Vietnamese  Household  and  Living  Standards \nSurvey shows that poor households pay a larger share of income for education than do the rich, \nand considerable attention must be given to the matter of price inelasticity of demand for LSE. \nThis current policy of implicit subsidy to LSE is rooted in the notion that education at this level is \na public good with high social benefits.    \n \nC. \n \n7. \nA financial plan in the form of a cost table showing fiscal impact has been prepared. It \ngives details of expenditure categories and funding sources necessary to ensure the availability \nof  adequate  monies  to  finance  expenditures.  The  plan  applies  to  the  entire  implementation \nperiod  to  ensure  that  funds  cover  both  capital  and  recurrent  expenditures  over  the  entire \noperating  period  of  the  loan  are  available.  Education  projects  are  considered  indirectly \nproductive and do not generate sufficient funds to cover operating expenditures. The full fiscal \nimpact  of  the  Project  for  each  year  of  its  life  is  summarized  in  Table  A10.3.  The  financial \nrequirement  is  a  government  (fiscal)  requirement,  and  the  usual  steps  have  been  taken  to \nensure  that  the  government  is  fully  committed  to  provide  adequate  funds  for  operational \npurposes. \n  \nTable A10.3 shows the project recurrent costs as a percentage of total estimated public \n8. \nfunds for the education sector and LSE subsector over the period 2005\u20132015. The allocation is \nbased on the assumptions that the GDP will continue to grow with the relatively high real growth \nof  7.5%,  the  share  of  public  expenditure  in  the  GDP  will  remain  at  22%,  and  the  share  to \neducation will increase significantly to 20% (from 15.6% in 2002). While financial resources in \n\nFiscal Adequacy \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\ngeneral and for education for all (EFA) will steadily increase  1, it is projected that funding gaps \nare  likely  to  occur  every  year  until  2015.  EFA  funding,  projected  to  comprise  64%,  15%,  and \n10%, will come from public sources, aid funding, and community contributions, respectively; the \nbalance is the funding gap. The Project is estimated to cost about 0.16% (2005), increasing to \n1.32%  (2007),  and  0.5%  (2010)  of  the  funds  available  for  the  education  sector.  The  project \ninvestment is estimated to be about 0.13% of the available public funds for the education sector \nin 2005, increasing to 1.14% in 2007, and decreasing to 0.48% in the last project year. Likewise, \nthe  project  recurrent  costs  are  minimal  as  they  represent  only  about  0.016%  to  0.05%  of  the \nprojected LSE subsector fund requirements in 2005\u20132010. \n\n \nTable A10.3: Macroeconomic Framework for Education Financing \n($ million, in constant 2001/02 prices) \n\n \n \nItem \nGDP ($ million) \nEduc.

First,  the  main \n9. \nsources  of  finance  (excluding  official  development  assistance)  are  government  (fiscal)  and \nprivate  (household).  Government  commitment  to  the  education  sector  is  firm  and  has \ncontinuously grown in the last decade, thus lending considerable empirical weight to projected \nfiscal requirements. From the medium-term budget framework, both the Government and party \ngoals for education call for increases in the amount of fiscal spending allocated to the education \nsector.  The  strategy  of  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  Training  explicitly  requires  the \nimplementation and continuation of programs designed to achieve universal access to primary \neducation  as  a  necessary  condition  for  the  concomitant  objective  of  achieving  universal \ncoverage at the lower secondary level by the year 2010. Evidence of government commitment \nat  the  primary  level  can  be  found  in  the  adoption  of  education  for  all  goals  in  government \nplanning.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  record  economic  growth  and  expanding  markets  augur  well  for  the \ngovernment ability to meet its budgetary commitments.    \n\n                                                 \n1   Education for All (EFA) 2004\u20132015, Ministry of Education and Training.

Although  the  poor  have  not  enjoyed  the  same  access as the rich, evidence \nfrom the 2002 household survey confirms that households are willing and able to pay fees2 and \nother costs of lower schooling. Economic growth has cut unemployment and raised household \nliving  standards,  hence  ensuring  both  fiscal  and  private  capacity  to  pay  the  costs  of  LSE \nexpansion.  A  legitimate  government  concern  is  that  the  resources  be  used  efficiently  so  as  to \nachieve the highest quality of education at all levels and that a higher share of total spending be \ndirected  at  the  underserved  minority  and  poor  populations.  The  government\u2019s  education \nstrategy, supported directly by the Project, includes measures to address these issues. Figure \nA10  shows  recent  and  projected  expenditure  figures  for  education  and  training  between  1995 \nand  2010,  corresponding  to  the  short  and  medium  term.  As  indicated  in  the  figure,  the \nGovernment has increased expenditures on education. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure A10: Education and Training Budget \n\n34\n\n31\n\n32\n\n26\n\n27\n\n24\n\n22\n\n16\n\n17\n\n17\n\n19\n\n13\n\n13\n\n14\n\n7\n\n8\n\n1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010\n\nBudget Year\n\nSource: Government Statistics Office. \n\n                                                 \n2   Based  on  Vietnamese  Living  Standards  Measurement  Survey  2002,  household  expenditures  in  education  are \n\nabout 2.9% of total expenditures. (Appendix 11 \u2013 Economic and Poverty (Impact) Analysis, Table A11.2) \n\n\f \n\n44\n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \nA. \n\n \n\nMacroeconomic Context \n\nECONOMIC AND POVERTY IMPACT ANALYSIS \n\n1. \nEstimates  from  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  the  World  Bank,  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank place economic growth in 2002\u20132004 at around 7% per annum in Viet Nam. \nGrowth continues to be robust and forecasts a similar optimistic prognosis largely based on the \nGovernment  policy  of  continuing  toward  market  reforms.  Export  earnings  are  strong,  service \nsector  growth  is  higher  than  projected,  industry  and  agriculture  are  performing  at  or  above \ntargets,  and  domestic  consumption  and  investment  are  at  their  highest  historical  levels.  Major \nstructural  and  macroeconomic  reforms  undertaken  include  trade  liberalization;  private  sector \ndevelopment; public expenditure management; fiscal prudence; banking and enterprise reform; \nand  public  administration,  legal  and  governance  system  modernization.  The  impact  of  the \naccelerated reform momentum is exhibited in the boost to the private sector, declining poverty \nlevels,  declining  debt,  subdued  inflation,  and  modest  fiscal  deficits.  The  reform  program  is \nfocused  on  accelerating  Viet  Nam\u2019s  transition  to  a  market  economy,  as  well  as  disciplined \nmacroeconomic management. Top priorities continue to be placed on boosting investment and \nimproving competitiveness, further opening the economy to the private sector, closer integration \ninto the global markets, and state enterprise reforms. \n \n2. \nExpansion  of  education  in  Viet  Nam  has  been  very  impressive.  Enrollment  has \nincreased steadily nationwide and has been characterized by equal access for boys and girls. \nHowever, the challenge of getting the last group of children into school is quite significant, given \nthat  these  children  come  from  poor  and  remote  areas.  Improving  the  quality  of  teaching  and \nlearning for these pupils is necessary to build a strong foundation for universal lower secondary \neducation  (LSE),  targeted  for  2010.  Clearly,  wage  employment  is  the  future  and  is  a  direct \ncorrelate  of  high  investments  in  formal  education.  The  Project  is  focused  on  improving \neducation attainment across the 64 provinces of the country. It will invest in new assets to raise \nthe  quality  of  schooling  and  to  distribute  it  more  evenly  throughout  the  national  population. \nEfficiency  in  LSE  will  be  improved  by  strengthening  management  at  the  district  and  school \nlevels.   \n \nB.        Economic Analysis \n\n \n1.  Economic Rationale  \n\n \n3. \nPublic and private investments in all levels of education in Viet Nam have been high, as \nevidenced  by  the  expansion  of  school  places  and  increased  participation.  Between 1993 and \n2002,  enrollment  increased  by  3.9%  at  the  primary  level,  by  140%  in  LSE,  and  by  480%  in \nupper  secondary.  Despite  these  achievements,  internal  efficiency  remains  low,  with  high \ndropout  and  class  repetition  rates  in  some  regions  of  the  country.1  Poor  quality  is  shown  in \ninsufficient school hours, underqualified teachers, insufficient instructional materials, and limited \nphysical  and  support  infrastructure.  Access,  especially  by  the  poor  and  ethnic  minorities, \nremains a problem.  Decentralization  revealed  significant  differences  in  management  capacity \namong  provinces,  districts  and  schools.  Capacity  is  weak  in  core  competencies  such  as \nplanning,  budget  allocation,  and  delivery  of  in-service  training  and  other  teacher  support \nservices.  To  turn  Viet  Nam\u2019s  decade-long  history  of  economic  growth  into  genuine  poverty \nreduction, the assets of the country\u2019s poor must be augmented and human capital more equally \ndistributed. This objective can be achieved either by investing in new assets, specifically, LSE, \nor by redistributing existing assets. By 2010, the Government aims to achieve universal LSE at \nhigher  levels  of  quality.  The  Project  will  support  quality  improvements  through  continuing \n\n                                                 \n1   In  2000,  retention  (71%)  and  completion  rates  (70.2%) were still  low.  This  is  inefficient  and  has  prolonged  the \naverage time that the system takes to produce one graduate to more than 6 years, for a 5-year cycle of primary \nschooling. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n 45\n\ncurriculum  reforms,  retraining  teachers  in  modern  instructional  methods,  and  systematic \nmeasurement  of  learning  outcomes.  Resources  will  be  directed  to  the  poorest  districts  of  28 \ncarefully  selected  provinces,  with  poor  and  ethnic  minority  children  specifically  targeted. \nInstitutional capacity for providing LSE will be strengthened at provincial, district, and commune \nlevels. Expanding the coverage and quality of education and reducing the costs for the poor are \nnecessary to prevent inequalities from widening excessively.   \n\n2.  Demand Analysis \n\n \n4. \nViet Nam experienced rapid expansion of lower and upper secondary education over the \nlast decade. In 1992\u20132000, the gross enrollment ratio for LSE increased from 44% to over 80% \n(Table  A11.1).  Expanded  enrollment  was  accompanied  by  marked  improvements  in  internal \nefficiency, as completion rates rose from 39.8% to 69.5% (secondary education sector master \nplan  [SESMP],  2001).  In  view  of  Government  plans  to  expand  primary,  lower,  and  upper \nsecondary  enrollment  by  2010,  significant  public  (and  private)  resources  will  be  required at all \nlevels. \n \n\nTable A11.1: Lower Secondary Education Enrollment and Gross Enrollment Rate  \n\n \nGross Enrollment Rate  \n\n \n\n \nYear \n\n \n1992/93 \n1993/94 \n1994/95 \n1995/96 \n1996/97 \n1997/98 \n1998/99 \n1999/2000 \n2000/01 \n2001/02 \n2002/03 \n\n \nLSE Student \nEnrollment \n \n2,708,067 \n3,178,348 \n3,679,104 \n4,312,674 \n4,945,452 \n5,254,419 \n5,577,307 \n5,768,843 \n5,918,153 \n6,254,254 \n6,497,548 \n\n \nAnnual  \nGrowth Rate (%) \n \n\u2014 \n17.4 \n15.8 \n10.7 \n14.7 \n6.2 \n6.1 \n3.4 \n2.6 \n5.7 \n4.0 \n\nAverage Growth Rate \nLSE = lower s econdary education, \u2014 = not available. \nSource: secondary education sector master plan, 2001. \n \n5. \nDemand  for  schooling  is  difficult  to  establish  using  traditional  methods.  Cultural, \nhistorical,  and  enrollment  expansion  data  all  combine  to  suggest  that  the  social demand for \nschooling  in  Viet  Nam  is  comparatively  high.  This  is  manifested  in  the  quest  for  improved \nlearning  achievement  through  supplemental  classes,  often  taught  by  regular  schoolteachers \nfrom  their  homes,  the  schools  themselves,  or  at  commercial  spaces.  The  recent  2002 \nhousehold living standards survey confirms that households at all income quintiles pay for extra \nclasses  where  available.  These  extra  classes  in  turn  are  thought  to  lead  to  higher  entrance \nexam scores and hence improved probability  of continuation up the school ladder. Table A11.2 \ndemonstrates  the  extent  to  which  the  direct  costs  of  education  remain  significant  among \nhousehold expenditures. The extra classes component is an important part of total spending.  \nThe burden carried by individual households for the schooling of their children, as measured by \nthe  percentage  of  total  household  spending  devoted  to  education,  is  more  or  less  equally \nshared by all income groups except for those in the richest quintile, who pay slightly more.  But \nequally significant is the fact that the poor spend a lot less for extra classes than do the rich. If \nthese classes play a significant role in determining achievement outcomes, then children of poor \nfamilies  receive  a  lot  less  of  the  most  fundamental  component  of  school  quality  than  do  the \nchildren of economically advantaged families. \n \n\n \n\u2014 \n44 \n51 \n58 \n66 \n70 \n75 \n78 \n80 \n83 \n94 \n8.9  % \n\n\f \n\n46\n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n \nLower \nSecondary \nEducation \n\nTable A11.2: Household Expenditures in Lower Secondary Education in 2002 \n\n \nD\u2019000 per year \n\n \nPercent of \nHousehold \nExpenditure \n\nFee  Contribution \n\nPoorest \n49.0 \n2.9 \nNear Poor \n56.3 \n2.9 \nMiddle \n62.7 \n2.7 \nNear Rich \n70.1 \n2.7 \nRichest \n90.6 \n3.1 \n65.0 \nViet Nam \n2.9 \nSource: Based on 2002 Viet Nam Living Standards Measurement Survey from Government Statistics Office. \n\n225.7 \n293.2 \n343.1 \n457.5 \n1,076.0 \n454.8 \n\n30.7 \n45.9 \n55.0 \n70.0 \n180.1 \n72.2 \n\n9.1 \n16.0 \n18.0 \n31.0 \n89.4 \n30.3 \n\nTextbooks  School \nTools  \n40.4 \n49.3 \n54.7 \n63.3 \n79.3 \n56.8 \n\nExtra \nClass \n15.5 \n28.9 \n45.6 \n89.9 \n425.7 \n107.5 \n\nUniform \n \n28.3 \n39.1 \n44.5 \n60.7 \n100.8 \n53.1 \n\n \n51.3 \n56.4 \n60.5 \n68.8 \n103.3 \n66.7 \n\nOthers \n\nTotal \n\n \n6. \nAn  additional  and  widely  accepted  method  for  estimating  unmet  demand  in  economic \nanalysis  is  through  the  use  of  the  national  leaving  examination.  In  this  case,  examination \nperformance  itself  is  not  the  useful  indicator,  but  rather  the  number  of  students  who  take  the \nexamination. This number is a proxy for demand at the next higher level, as it can reasonably \nbe  assumed  that  taking  the  exam  is  an  indication  of  students\u2019  aspiration  for  subsequent \neducation experience. The number of takers of leaving exams is then compared with the initial \nintake  of  LSE.  Examination  of  the  relevant  data  from  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  Training \nappears to confirm that, using this method, there is substantial unmet demand for LSE in every \nprovince of the country. This finding is not surprising especially in light of the rapid expansion of \ncoverage at this level of schooling over the past decade.   \n \n\n \n3.  Cost-Benefit Analysis \n\n \nIn  Viet  Nam,  there  is  still  a  sizable  government  sector  where  price  distortions  are \n7.    \ncommonplace. Labor market distortions found in public sector employment lead to artificially low \nrate-of-return  estimates,  which  create  disincentives  for  investing  in  education.  Since  urban \nwages  are  still  an  unreliable  proxy  for  labor  productivity,  rate-of-return  calculations based on \nsuch  data  should  not  be  used  in  Viet  Nam  as  an  infallible  guide  to  investment  priorities  in \neducation.  Differences  across  regions  and  provinces  in  wage  levels  and  wage  growth  also \ncomplicate the calculation and analyses of cost-benefit ratios. Decisions concerning LSE in Viet \nNam should look beyond the absence of fully reliable rate-of-return data and consider that equal \naccess  to  education  is  among  the  basic  human  rights  to  which  everyone  is  entitled.    In \ncalculating  the  benefits  from  education  projects,  a  reverse  procedure  is  often  employed  in  the \nabsence of valid and reliable information on earnings differentials due to schooling. This type of \nanalysis is often described as \u201creverse cost-benefit analysis\u201d and consists of estimating the cost \nsavings and productivity gains required for an education investment to have an acceptable rate \nof return.   \n \n8. \nThis  Project  has  few,  if  any,  quantifiable  objectives  for  which  future  monetary  benefits \ncan  be  estimated.2  The  Project  employs  interrelated  components  and  sub-components  to \nimprove the quality of LSE and extend it to underserved populations. The approach used in the \neconomic  analysis  follows  that  used  in  the  secondary  education  sector  master  plan3 and the \nUpper  Secondary  Education  Development  Project.4  This  is  a  lower-bound  estimate  based  on \n\n                                                 \n2  It should be noted that for basic education, including lower secondary education, cost-benefits are quantified (i.e., \ncalculation of the rate of return) mainly because the provision of basic education is considered as a public good. \nAlternatively,  the  \u201creverse  cost-benefit  analysis\u201d  has  been  conducted  to  confirm  the  project  benefits,  using the \nmethodology established in ADB. 2002.

Benefits will be \nderived from two main sources: (i) reduced costs  in providing LSE, and (ii) improved productivity \nof  the  labor  force.  Total  project  benefits  are  estimated  at  about  $44  million  per  year  (Table \nA11.3). With a minimum benchmark of 12% (real rate of return), the Project can be considered a \nsound investment. Reduced operating costs are assumed to result from improved management \nand financial allocation mechanisms and greater internal operating efficiency in lower secondary \nschools,  leading  to  more  lower  secondary  school  graduates  with  higher  earnings  as  they \nbecome  better  qualified.  These  benefits  notably  do  not  include  externalities  such  as  improved \nhealth, better nutritional practice, and lower fertility rates, among others.   \n \n\nTable A11.3: Calculation of Reverse Cost -Benefit Analysis \n \n\n \n\nYear \n\nExpected Annual Benefits  \nfrom Reduced Costs \n\nExpected Annual Benefits  \nfrom Productivity Differentials \n\n \n\n  \n\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n15 Year Total \n15 Year Ave \nSources : Base data on number of graduates from MOET: Differential earnings from VNLSMS. 2002. \n\n$ million \n0.97 \n1.17 \n1.29 \n1.49 \n1.75 \n2.01 \n2.33 \n2.65 \n3.04 \n3.50 \n4.01 \n4.66 \n5.37 \n6.15 \n6.99 \n47.38 \n3.16 \n\n$ million \n35.7 \n37.2 \n38.8 \n41.5 \n43.4 \n43.1 \n41.7 \n41.7 \n41.7 \n41.7 \n41.7 \n41.7 \n41.7 \n41.7 \n41.7 \n614.8 \n40.9 \n\n \nD billion \n555 \n574 \n599 \n642 \n671 \n666 \n644 \n644 \n644 \n644 \n644 \n644 \n644 \n644 \n644 \n9,498 \n633 \n\n \nD billion \n15 \n18 \n20 \n23 \n27 \n31 \n36 \n41 \n47 \n54 \n62 \n72 \n83 \n95 \n108 \n732 \n48.8 \n\n \n9. \nProductivity differentials are computed based on the number of projected graduates by \nsecondary  education  sector  master  plan  multiplied  by  the  differential  earnings  from  the  mean \nand  median  average  income  (Table  A11.4).  From  the  Vietnamese  Living  Standard  Survey \n1997\u20131998, the median average for the seven regions with educational attainment of less than \nprimary  diploma  and  lower  secondary  diploma  was  70%  of  the  population.  The  difference \nbetween  the  median  and  mean  income  is  the  productivity  differential  of  the  upper  secondary \neducation graduates under the Project, assuming 76% completion rate. It is assumed that about \n40% of the graduates will benefit from the productivity differential. \n\n \n\nIncome Level \n\nMean Income  \n\nMedian Income  \n\n \nTable A11.4: Base Data \n\n  \n\nAnnual Income Per Capita \n\nD\u2019000 \n\n3,389 \n\n2,395 \n\n$ \n\n226 \n\n160 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nProductivity Differential \nSources:  Viet  Nam  Government,  1998.

The survey shows the \n\n\f \n\n48\n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\ndifference between the median and mean incomes for the national population, which figure was \ntaken as the productivity differential of LSE graduates under the Project. Completion rates are \nthose  from  the  SESMP  and  it  is  assumed  that  about  40%  (largely  urban  wage  earners)  will \nbenefit  from  the  productivity  differential.  Reduced  costs  are  the  yearly  savings  expected  as  a \nresult  of  strengthening  management  of  LSE.  The  Project  is  expected  to  improve  cost-\neffectiveness (where the production of an LSE graduate is the measure of effect) by improving \nthe  utilization  of  schools,  reducing  the  distance  between  new  schools,  improving  quality  of \ninstruction,  and  thereby  reducing  dropout  and  repetition  rates.  Expected  cost  savings  are \nassumed to be about 1% of annual recurrent costs of LSE. \n \n\n4.  Cost-Effectiveness and Efficiency Analysis \n\n \n11. \nA key element of system efficiency is spending per student or unit cost. Research done \nby  the  SESMP  determined  that  the  fiscal  (government  spending)  cost  per  LSE  student  in \n2000/01 was D264,000. Unit costs rise inversely with enrollment ratios. The reason is that both \ncapital and recurrent expenditures are higher in remote and difficult districts and communes. In \nsome  instances,  teachers  are  given  incentives  if  they  serve  in  rural  and  remote  areas. \nConstruction  costs  are  higher  in  such  areas  than  in  urban  centers.  Public  expenditure  at  the \nLSE  level  is  less  than  the  actual  unit  cost,  implying  the  existence  of  costs  borne  by  individual \nhouseholds. The Project supports the adoption of government policy abolishing fees at the LSE. \nThe  Government  has  tried  to  hold  constant  or  reduce  the  practice  of  cost  recovery  at  the \nprimary  and  lower  secondary  levels  for  the  poor  and  very  few  poor  and  minority  families.  It  is \nalso  helping  the  disadvantaged  students  by  subsidizing  out-of-pocket costs that constrain the \nattainment of universal coverage.      \n \n\n5.  Beneficiaries \n\n \n12. \nDirect project beneficiaries are included about 367,000 students: approximately 267,000 \ndisadvantaged  students  and  100,000  returning  students  in  LSE.  Teachers  and  administrators \ninclude  approximately  57,000  teachers,  3,400  principals,  5,000  other  school  staff,  1,200 \nsupervisors, 1,900 staff of  bureaus of education and training (BOETs), 3,800 staff of  provincial \ndepartments of education and training (DOETs), and 50 other education officials. In component \n1,  in-service  training  will  cover  improvement  in  (i)  teaching  methods:  approximately  7,400 \nteachers, 250 principals, and 500 support staff, and 300 officers of BOETs and 600 officers of \nDOET, with upgrading courses for approximately 15,000 teachers; (ii) the quality of assessment \nof  student  learning:  4,800  teachers,  2,400  principals,  1,200  supervisors,  1,600  officers  of \nBOETs and 3,200 officers of DOETs; (iii) the use of information and communication technology \nin  schools:  30,000  teachers;  (iv)  vocational  orientation  and  continuing  education:  4,500  school \nstaff and 750 principals. Overall, 4 million students and 72,500 teachers and other officials are \nexpected to benefit from project interventions under this component. In component 2, physical \ncapacity  will  be  expanded  to  accommodate  approximately  90,720  additional  disadvantaged \nstudents.  Support  for  disadvantaged  and  ethnic  minority  students  will  be  extended  to \napproximately 175,000 disadvantaged students and 100,000 returning students. Approximately \n10,000 teachers will be upgraded to work with disadvantaged students. In component 3, direct \nbeneficiaries in fundamental school quality level include 6,110 persons: 3,050 principals, 1,220 \nsupervisors,  1,220  staff  of  BOETs,  610  staff  of  DOETs,  and  10  other  education  officials.  In-\nservice training on planning and management will benefit an estimated 5,536 staff (1,100 staff of \nBOETs,  4,400  staff  of  DOETs,  and  36  other  education  officials).    In  education  and  school \nmanagement, about 15,100 staff will be trained.  Project implementation training will benefit 390 \nprincipals, 1,041 staff of DOETs, and 50 other education officials. \n \nC. \n \n13. \nEqual  access  to  education  services  is  among  the  basic  human  rights  to  which  the \nGovernment of Viet Nam is fully committed. Equitable distribution of human capital is important \n\nPoverty Impact and Equity Analysis  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11   \n \n\n49 \n\n \n\nfor broad-based growth and poverty reduction.  Moreover, equitable distribution of opportunities \nis preferable to the redistribution of existing assets, which is politically difficult. Recent research \non the effect of initial asset distribution on growth and poverty reduction has found a significant \ncorrelation  between  initial  education  inequality  and  reduced  income  growth.  Education \nresearchers  have  found  ways  to  construct  education  Gini  coefficients,  which  are  similar  to  the \nGini coefficients widely used to measure distribution of income and land.5 Gini coefficients have \noften been calculated in the past using poverty data. In the Project, baseline data on education \ninequality in Viet Nam was used in determining priority groupings. Table A11.5 summarizes the \neducation Gini coefficients for three groups based on 1999 census data.6 Data are grouped by \ninclusion  priority  and  by  province  within  priority  groups.  The  table  reveals  that  priority  group 1 \nhas  higher  average  inequality  than  do  the  provinces  in  priority  group 2, and  priority  group 2 \nprovinces exhibit on average higher inequality than those in  priority group 3. It is also clear that \neven priority group 3 does not match Viet Nam\u2019s overall Gini coefficient of 0.2375.

All  the  newly  built  schools  will  provide  accommodation  and  board  to \nteachers and students.  \n \n2. \nThe  28  provinces  are  divided  into  three  priority  groups  in  accordance  with  level  of \ndisadvantage.  The  first  priority  group  comprises  11  disadvantaged  provinces  with  highest \ninequality in access:  Binh Phuoc, Cao Bang, Dak Lak, Dak Nong, Dien Bien, Gia Lai, Ha Giang, \nLai  Chau,  Lao  Cai,  Ninh  Thuan  and  Tra  Vinh.  The  second  priority  group  comprises  nine \ndisadvantaged  provinces  with  inequality  in  access:  Bac  Can,  Hoa  Binh;  Kon  Tum,  Lam  Dong, \nLang Son, Phu Yen, Son La, Tuyen Quang, and Yen Bai. The third priority group comprise eight \ndisadvantaged provinces with inequality in access: Binh Dinh, Binh Thuan, Ha Tinh, Nghe An, \nPhu Tho, Quang Nam, Tay Ninh, and Vinh Phuc.  \n \nAll  proposed  subprojects  will  fall  under  either  Category  B  (not  significant  impacts)2 or \n3. \nCategory C (no resettlement impacts). As part of the project selection criteria, an area proposed \nfor school extension or construction of new schools that may entail significant impacts or land \nacquisition from ethnic minorities will not be included.   \n \nB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Entitlements \n\n4. \nThe resettlement framework aims to ensure that screening, planning,  and management \nprocedures  for  involuntary  resettlement  on  all  subprojects  will  comply  with  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and other ADB social safeguard \npolicies.  The  resettlement  policy  framework  for  the  Project  is  based  on  the  laws  of  the \nGovernment  of  Viet  Nam,  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995),  Handbook  on \nResettlement: A Guide to Good Practice, and Operational Manual F2.   \n \n5. \nThis  Project  will  be  bound  by  the  principles  and  conditions  stated  in  the  resettlement \nframework that will be approved by ADB and the Government. If there is any conflict between \nADB  and  Government  policy,  ADB  policy  will  prevail.  The  principles  and  objectives  are  to \nensure  that  all  affected  people  (AP)  will  be  compensated  for  their losses at replacement cost \nand  will  be  assisted  to  improve,  or  at  least  maintain,  their  pre-Project  living  standards  and \nincome-earning capacity. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                 \n1   The  28  provinces  are  selected  and  prioritized  on  the  basis  of  indicators  related  to  socioeconomic  development, \neducation development, social equity, and coverage by other projects. It should be noted that the final Government \ndecision on the selected provinces is subject to the Government\u2019s further appraisal and approving process.  \n\n2   Not significant impacts \u2013 means less than 200 people are displaced from houses or less than 200 people lose less \nthan  10%  of  their  productive,  income-generating  assets.  A  short  resettlement  plan  will  be  required  for  each \nCategory B subproject. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n1. \n\nPrinciples of Resettlement \n\n6. \n\nThe following basic principles have been adopted for the Project: \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n51\n\nAvoid  or  minimize  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement  by  identifying \npossible  alternative  project  designs  and  appropriate  social,  economic, \noperational and engineering solutions. \nThe cutoff date for compensation eligibility will be the date when the census and \ninventory of losses survey per subproject is completed.  \nJoint  detailed  measurement  survey,  baseline  socioeconomic  survey,  and  a \nreplacement cost study survey will be carried out for all subprojects after detailed \ndesign is completed. The results of the replacement cost survey will be applied \nby  the  provincial  people\u2019s  committee  (PPC)  for  various  types  of  losses.    The \nestablished unit rates will be updated regularly to ensure that the current market \nrates at the time of compensation are reflected. \nAll  APs  will  be  compensated  for  loss  of  land  and  other  assets  at  replacement \ncost. Compensating at replacement cost means valuing the assets to replace the \nloss at market value, or its nearest equivalent, plus any transaction costs such as \nadministrative charges, taxation, registration, and titling costs.   \nAll  AP  will  be  equally  eligible  for  compensation,  irrespective  of  tenure  status, \nsocial or economic standing, and any such factors that may discriminate against \nachieving the objectives outlined above. \nPreparation  of  the  subproject  resettlement  plans  (RPs),  as  part  of  subproject \npreparation,  and  their  implementation  are  to  be  carried  out  with  the  full \nparticipation of the AP.   \n\n(vii)  Adequate  budgetary  support  will  be  fully  committed  and  be  made  available  to \ncover  the  costs  of  land  acquisition,  resettlement,  and  rehabilitation  within  the \nagreed-upon implementation period.  \n\n(viii)  The Executing Agency will ensure that institutional arrangements are in place for \n\neffective and timely planning and implementation of the RPs. \nThere will be effective mechanisms for hearing and resolving grievances during \nimplementation of the subproject RPs.  \nADB  will  not  approve  any  civil  works  contract  for  any  subproject  to  be  financed \nfrom the loan proceeds unless the Government has satisfactorily completed the \napproved RP for that subproject.  \nSubproject RPs will be translated into the local language and translations placed \nin project and commune offices for the reference of AP as well as any interested \ngroups.   \n\n(xii)  Appropriate  reporting,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  mechanisms  will  be  identified \n\nand set in place as part of the resettlement management system.  \n\nEligibility Criteria \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n \n2. \n\n7. \nAffected  persons  are  defined  as  those  who,  at  the  cutoff  date,  would  have  their  (i) \nstandard  of  living  adversely  affected;  (ii)  right,  title,  or  interest  in  any    land  (residential, \nagricultural, forest, and grazing land) or any other fixed or movable asset acquired or possessed \nadversely  affected,  in  full  or  in  part,  permanently  or  temporarily;  or  (iii)  business, occupation, \nwork,  place  of  residence,  or  habitat  adversely  affected,  with  or  without  displacement.  Persons \nwho encroach into the area after the cutoff date are not entitled to compensation or any other \nform of resettlement assistance. However, persons who have land and other assets lost legally \ndue to land acquisition caused by the Project, but are identified after the cutoff date because of \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n52\n\nAppendix 12 \n\nthe  change  in  or  delayed  availability  of  detailed  technical  designs,  will  be  eligible  to  full \nentitlements  provided  by  the  subproject  RP,  equal  to  those  of  the  entitled  AP  listed  in  the \ncensus survey. \n \n8. \nshown in the project entitlement matrix (Table A12). \n \n\nPersons  affected  by  the  Project  will  be  entitled  to  various  types  of  compensation  as \n\nTable A12: Project Entitlement Matrix  \n \n\nCompensation Policy \n\nImplementation Issues \n\nCash compensation for acquired land \nat full replacement cost \n \n \n\nType of Loss \n\nPermanent \nLoss of Land \n \n \n\nDefinition of \nEntitled Person \nLegal users (Those with \nland-use right \ncertificates (LURCs)  \n \nLegalizable land users. \n(Those who are waiting \nfor the LURC to be \napproved by the district \nauthority and who have \ndocuments to prove as \nsuch.) \n\nLoss of Crops \nand Trees \n\nAll crops and tree \nowners regardless of \nland-use right  \n\nIf land is owned by \nmanagement organizations \n(i.e., commune people\u2019s \ncommittee), the CPC will be \nentitled to \n(i)  full amount if communal \npublic land is not assigned \nto anyone; \n(ii) 70% of the total amount \nif land is already temporarily \nleased to the affected \npeople (AP).

New  schools  will  be \nconstructed on vacant and idle public or communal reserve land. For public land or communal \nland  identified,  the  PPC  will  confirm  that  the  said  land  is  free  from  any  encumbrances, \nhabitation, dispute, or controversy. The PPC certification will be verified by a third party such as \nthe Vietnam Women\u2019s Union. In the event that no vacant public land is available and that private \nland  is  identified,  a  detailed  community  decision-making  process  will  be  followed,  using  these \ncriteria: (i) land acquisition and resettlement must fall under Category B  - not having significant \nimpacts, (ii) the land is not the subject of any legal disputes or controversies, (iii) the land does \nnot belong to any ethnic minorities, and (iv) there are no existing structures on the land.  A short \nRP will be prepared for each subproject. \n \n10. \nIn  the  case  of  voluntary  contribution  of  land  or  other  assets  by  AP,  the  following \nrequirements  will  be  strictly  followed  to  make  the  voluntary  contribution  acceptable:  (i)  the \nProject  will  certify  that  the  AP  are  properly  consulted  and  made  fully  aware  of  their  rights  to \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n53\n\ncompensation and assistance, (ii) the AP will directly benefit from the Project, (iii) the AP will not \nbe severely affected or will not lose more than 10% of their individual total productive, income- \ngenerating assets, (iv) there are no existing structures on the land, (v) the AP do not belong to \nany  vulnerable  groups  (e.g.,  the  poor,  ethnic  minorities,  households  headed  by  women,  the \ndisabled),  (vi)  the  AP  issued  a  written  certification  that  they  were  properly  consulted  on  their \nrights  to  compensation  and  that  they  opted  to  voluntarily  donate  their  land,  and  (vii)  the \nvoluntary  land  donation  issued  by  an  AP  will  be  verified  by  a  third  party  (such  as  Vietnam \nWomen\u2019s  Union).  The  process  will  be  properly  documented  by \nthe  Provincial  Project \nImplementation Unit and will be attached to the subproject RP.   \n \n\n2. \n\nSubproject RP Preparation and Implementation  \n\nIn preparing and implementing the subproject RPs for Category B subprojects, the PPC    \n\n11. \nwill follow these procedures: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nConsult  with  various  stakeholders  to  obtain  their  views  on  how  to  avoid  or \nminimize adverse impacts and identify the needs and preferences of AP. \nUndertake  joint  census  (100%),  asset  inventory,  and  detailed  measurement \nsurvey. \nUndertake joint socioeconomic survey of a sample population. \nCarry  out joint replacement cost study for various types of assets (land, crops, \nand trees) and establish project compensation unit rates.   \nAnalyze data to identify different categories of AP based on the degree and scale \nof impacts. \nCompare  the  various  types  of  losses  with  the  agreed-upon entitlements as set \nout  in  the  entitlement  matrix.    If  there  are  new  categories  of  AP  and  types  of \nlosses are identified, the entitlements will be included in accordance with ADB\u2019s \ninvoluntary resettlement policy.  The project entitlements cannot be downgraded. \nfor  subproject  RP \nFormulate  a \nimplementation,  procedures  for  grievance  redress,  monitoring  and  evaluation \nprocedures, and a budget. \n\ntime-bound  action  plan  or  schedule \n\n(ix) \n(x) \n\n(viii)  Prepare  a  subproject  RP.  Translate  it  into  the  local  languages  and  present  the \ndraft during consultation and public meetings for comments.  The final subproject \nRP will incorporate the comments and suggestions of the affected communities. \nSubmit the subproject RP to ADB for review and approval.   \nImplement  subproject  RP.  Submit  progress  reports  to  ADB  as  part  of  the \nmonitoring activities.   \nSubmit  subproject  RP  completion  report  for  ADB  review  and  request  ADB  to \naward civil works contract. \nIf  all  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  are  properly  implemented  in \naccordance  with  the  approved  subproject  RP  and  ADB\u2019s  social  safeguard \npolicies, ADB will issue approval to award civil works. \n\n(xii) \n\n(xi) \n\nConsultation and Disclosure of Resettlement Planning Documents \n\nInformation  dissemination  to,  consultation  with,  and  participation  of  APs  and  involved \n12. \nagencies maintains transparency of the Project, reduces potential conflicts, minimizes the risk of \nProject  delays,  and  enables  the  Project  to  design  the  resettlement  and  the  rehabilitation \nprogram as a comprehensive development program to suit the needs and priorities of the APs.   \nThe  main  objectives  of  the  public  information  campaign,  stakeholders\u2019  participation  and  APs\u2019 \nconsultation  programs  are  to  a)  provide  APs  with  full  information  on  the  proposed  project,  its \ncomponents  and  activities;  b)  obtain  information  on  needs  and  priorities  of  APs  and  affected \n\n \nD. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n54\n\nAppendix 12 \n\ncommunities,  their  reactions  towards  project  proposed  policies  and  activities;  c)  achieve \ncooperation  and  participation  of  APs  in  proposed  activities  related  to  RP  preparation  and \nimplementation; d) ensure that APs are able to participate in and make fully informed choices on \nissues that directly affect their incomes and living standards; and e) ensure transparency in all \nactivities related to land acquisition, relocation and rehabilitation. This Resettlement Framework \nwill  be  uploaded  on  the  ADB  resettlement  website  immediately  upon  Board  approval.  All \nsubproject RPs will be translated in Vietnamese language and will be disclosed to APs prior to \nsubmission to ADB for review and approval.   \n \nE. \n\nGrievance Redress Procedure \n\n13. \nTo  ensure  that  all  AP  complaints,  grievances  on  any  aspect  of  land  acquisition, \ncompensation,  relocation,  payment    are  addressed  and  resolved  in  a  timely  and  satisfactory \nmanner, and that all avenues for airing grievances are available to AP, a well-defined grievance \nredress mechanism will be established. The AP will be made fully aware of their rights verbally \nand  in  writing  during  consultation,  survey,  and  time  of  compensation.  Detailed  procedures  for \nboth  redressing  grievances  and  the  appeal  process  will  be  publicized  among  AP  through  an \neffective public information campaign.   Attempts will be made to settle emerging issues at the \nward  level  through  community  consultation  and  involvement  of  a  resettlement  specialist  or \nnongovernment organizations as required. The respective resettlement committees will properly \ndocument all complaints and resolutions. \n\n \n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n14.  MOET is the Executing Agency and will have overall responsibility for coordinating and \nimplementing  all  subproject  activities  including  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.      A central \nproject  coordination  unit  (CPCU)  will  be  established  and  will  be  staffed  with  a  manager,  a \ndeputy  manager,  and  project  staff  from  relevant  departments  and  agencies  of  MOET,  other \nsupport and administrative staff, and international and domestic consultants.  The CPCU will be \nspecifically responsible for the  following resettlement activities: (i) submit RPs prepared by the \nProvincial  Project  Implementation  Unit  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval;  (ii)  consolidate  RP \nprogress reports; and (iii) recruit and supervise consultants, including the domestic resettlement \nspecialist for RP planning and implementation.  \n \n15. \nThe  PPC  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  and  implementing  all  subproject  RPs  and \nresettlement-related issues.  Resettlement committees at the provincial, district, and commune \nlevels will be set up to assist the PPC in RP planning and implementation, as required.    \n\n \n16. \nThe  provincial  project  implementation  unit  (PPIU)  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day \nproject  implementation.  It  will  comprise  technical,  institutional,  social  and  resettlement, \nadministrative management, and accounting divisions. The PPIU, together with the PPC, will be \nresponsible  for  the  following  key  resettlement  activities:  (i)  integrate  civil  works  with  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  activities;  (ii)  carry  out  information  campaigns,  consultation, \ndisclosure  of  subproject  RPs;  (iii)  develop  a  centralized  compensation  mechanism  through \nwhich  resettlement  disbursements  and  compensation  payments  for  AP  will  be  made;  (iv) \ncoordinate  with  other  departments  for  effective  implementation  of  the  RP  approved  under  the \nsubproject;  (v)  ensure  timely  flow  of  the  resettlement  budget  for  effective  delivery  of \ncompensation payments; (vi) ensure that a grievance redress mechanism is in place; and (vii) \nprepare and submit regular progress reports on civil works and status of RP activities. \n\n \n17. \nThe project supervision consultants will have one domestic construction supervision and \nresettlement specialist, who, in cooperation with  one domestic gender education specialist and \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n55\n\none domestic  ethnic minority education specialist, will  assist and supervise with all social and \nresettlement-related  activities.  Some  key  responsibilities  are  to:  (i)  work  closely  with  local \nauthorities and resettlement committees at all levels on resettlement-related activities and train \nlocal resettlement staff, as required; (ii) establish and implement liaison mechanisms to ensure \nproper  technical  and  logistical  support  from  the  Project  to  the  PPIUs,  local  administrative \nauthorities,  resettlement  committees,  and  concerned  government  departments;  (iii)  assist in  \nconducting  information  campaigns  and  community  participation;  (iv)  assist  in  conducting \ncensus, inventory of losses survey, DMS, and replacement cost study activities; (v) check the \nprepared  affected  peoples  database  for  accuracy,  and  provide  suggestions for improvement if \nnecessary; (vi) assist in preparing subproject RPs and progress reports; (vii) assist and revise, if \nnecessary,  procedures  for  coordinating  resettlement  and  compensation  activities,  including \nimplementation  arrangements;  and  (viii)  ensure  that  grievance  redress  mechanisms  are \nappropriate, and advise on speedy resolutions. \n \nG. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\nThe Project is expected to begin in 2005. Civil works will be implemented in two stages. \n18. \nStage  1  will  start  in  2006  by  building  143  schools  (63  schools  from  the  first  priority  group,  40 \nfrom the second priority group, and 40 from the third priority group). Stage 2 will begin in 2007 \nby building the remaining 103 schools (63 schools from the first priority group and 40 from the \nsecond  priority  group).  The  schedule  for  RP  implementation  will  be  properly  coordinated  with \nthe civil works schedule.  ADB will not approve any civil works contract for any subproject to be \nfinanced  from  the  loan  proceeds  unless  the  Government  has  satisfactorily  completed all RP \nactivities. \n \nH. \n\nBudget \n\n19. \nThe budget for the subproject RPs to cover the cost of land acquisition and resettlement \nwill be prepared within the agreed-upon implementation period. The RP budget will include the \nbreakdown for each type of loss per AP, with a corresponding compensation amount equivalent \nto replacement cost. Costs for implementing, monitoring, and contingencies will also be included \nin the overall RP budget. \n \nI. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n20. \nThe general objective of monitoring is to ensure timely and accurate compensation and \nimplementation  of  the  resettlement  program.  RP  implementation  will  be  monitored  and \nevaluated  by  the  CPCU,  and  preferably  by  an  external  monitoring  and  evaluation  agency,  to \ngive  the  management  feedback  on  implementation  and  identify  problems  and  successes  as \nearly as possible to facilitate timely adjustment of implementation arrangements.  \n  \nThe  PPC  and  PPIU,  with  the  assistance  of  the  project  supervision  consultants,  if \n21. \nrequired,  will  submit  to  the  CPCU  regular  quarterly  progress  reports  which  will  then  be \nsubmitted  to  ADB.  The  progress  reports  will  include  the  following  topics:  (i)  information \ncampaign,  consultations  carried  out  during  RP  implementation;  (ii)  the  number  of  AP  per \ncomponent by category of impact, and the status of compensation payment and relocation and \nincome  restoration  for  each  category;  (iii)  the  amount  of  funds  allocated  for  operations  or  for \ncompensation and the amount disbursed for each; (iv) the eventual outcome of complaints and \ngrievances  and  any  outstanding  issues  requiring  management  or  ADB\u2019s  assistance;  and  (v) \nimplementation issues and an agreed-upon time-bound action plan. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n56 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \n\n Yes \n \n  No \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nA. \nIs the sector identified as a national priority \nin country poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n    No \n\nPoverty Classification: Poverty Intervention 1 \n\nContribution  of  the  sector  or  subsector  to  reduce  poverty  in  Viet  Nam: The lower secondary education (LSE) \nsubsector  plays  a  crucial  role  in  poverty  reduction,  especially  for  those  who  come  from  ethnic  minority  and  poor  groups. \nStatistics  show  that  in  the  poor  and  remote  areas,  ethnic  minority  and  female  students  are  underrepresented  in  LSE.  The \nProject will create favorable conditions for these students to participate in LSE and to receive vocational orientation guidance \nand training in local traditional handicrafts to maintain and develop ethnic culture. To achieve universal basic education is the \ntarget to reduce poverty in the country.Over the last decade, LSE has seen a remarkable growth in enrollment number and in \nproportion  of  the  school  age  population.    In  2001\u20132002,  the  national  gross  enrollment  rate  (GER)  was  84.81%,  and  net \nenrollment  rate  (NER)  was  74.38%.    There  remain  significant  differences  in  enrollment  rate,  however,  among  regions  and \nprovinces.  For example, the NER in Red River Delta is 89.65% and GER is 94.07%; in the northwest region the two rates are \n48.90% and 68.45%, respectively. The enrollment rate of ethnic students is low and uneven am ong ethnic regions. Some \nethnic minorities have an enrollment rate similar to that of the Kinh group, while the enrollment rate for other ethnic minorities \nremains  low,  especially  among  Hmong  (4.5%),  Dao  (11.8%)  and  Bana  (8.9%).  There  is  also  a  significant  difference  in \nenrollment rate between the rich and the poor. Of the 20% poorest households and 20% richest households, only 33.6% of \nthe  poorest  households  can  access  LSE  compared  with  91%  of  the  richest  households.The  Project  will  address  issues \nconcerning access to and equity in LSE in selected provinces in northern uplands, coastal center, central highlands, north, \neast, south, and Mekong River Delta, which are suffering from slow economic and education development. \nB.  Poverty Analysis   \nWhat  type  of  poverty  analysis  is  needed?  The  poverty  partnership  agreement  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  was \nsigned on 25 February 2002.The most recent estimate of the population of Viet Nam is 80.78 million. Due to a sharp reduction \nin the birth rate, the proportion of children under 15 kept declining, from 39% in 1989 to 35.5% in 1999. While the percentage \nof females in the population is 50.84%, the nationwide ratio of females in the LSE (in 10\u201314 age group) is 48.26%.There is a \nsignificant difference in the average living standard between rural and urban areas. The lowest annual per capita income in \nurban areas in 1999 was D2,400,000 ($160), while in rural areas it was D996,000  ($66); the highest annual per capita income \nin urban areas was D23,529,600 ($1,569), and the figure for rural areas was D6,276,000  ($418). The poor in Viet Nam often \nshare common features: they live in rural areas, have relatively low levels of educational attainment, large number of children, \nand lack access to social and physical infrastructure.  Poverty has a great effect on participation in LSE of children of school \nage. Early child labor prevents children, especially girls from going to school. More seriously, early marriage is common in \nsome remote ethnic minority areas. Official statistics show that, during 1993\u20131998, less than 50% of children from low-income \nfamilies continued to pursue LSE. Cultural factors and male preference also affect the education of children, especially girls. \nIn  recent  years  the  Government  launched  a  National  Target  Poverty  Reduction  Program,  which  focused  on:  developing \nphysical  facilities  for  poor  communes;  providing  assistance  for  special  disadvantaged  ethnic  minorities,  resettlement, \nmigration  to  new  economic  zones;  training  in  basic  economic  knowledge  for  the  poor;  credit,  health  care,  and  education \nservices for the poor; and development of production and local industries. Under socioeconomic development programs for \nspecial disadvantaged communes in mountains and remote areas, the Government will provide financial assistance to 2,162 \ncommunes. Specific policies in health and education toward poor and ethnic minority populations were under implementation. \nAbout 1.3 million students are entitled to tuition fee reduction or exemption, and 1.4 million students can borrow textbooks and \nreceive  free  textbooks  with  a  total  budget  of  D80  million  from  local  budget  and  education  sector  funds.  However,  the \nresources reserved for poverty reduction programs are still limited and do not meet the demand.  The Project will enhance \naccess and quality of LSE for the poor, ethnic minorities, and female students through the following activities: (i) construction \nof  schools  with  priority  for  poor  and  disadvantaged  areas;  provision  of  equipment  and  teaching  aids,  textbook lending, \nboarding -houses for students who live far from school and for poor students; (ii) design of special summer and school year \nflexible programs to help students to master the curriculum; and (iii) organize vocational orientation and training courses on \ntraditional handicrafts of ethnic minorities, creating opportunities for them to integrate into society. The Project will focus its \ninvestment on 28 provinces facing great difficulties, with the following criteria: (i) a low NER, (ii) a large number of very poor \npeople or low human development intervention rating, (iii) high number of ethnic minority students, and (iv) low transition rate \nfrom primary to LSE. \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nIs there a participation strategy? \n\n  Yes \n   Yes               \n\n   No  \n   No \n\nD. Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: Female students, particularly from the ethnic minority families , are deprived of \naccess to the LSE. Lack of understanding and incentives to poor families  to send girls to lower secondary schools, a limited \nnumber of qualified female teachers who can be the role model of educated women, and irrelevance of old-fashioned \n\n                                                 \n\n1   Following the Board approval of the R-Paper, Review of ADB\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy, staff instructions to replace the \n\nPI/CPI classification with a new tracking system are under preparation in line with paragraph 83 of the R-Paper. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n 57 \n\ncurriculum  in  market economy work to keep the female enrollment rate in LSE considerably lower than that of male students. \nTo achieve the Government\u2019s commitment to universal LSE by 2015, more strategic policy actions for gender development in \nthe LSE sector is needed. The Project has the gender education action plan, which will be implemented in all components. \nMain  activities  from  the  gender  development  perspectives  are  (i)  development  of  a  new  curriculum  and  extra  instructional \nmaterial  with  special  attention  to  female  students;  (ii)  improvement  of  in-service  teacher  training  using  a  gender-oriented \napproach  including  courses  on  gender  education  and  cultural  activities  and  mentoring  system  for  female  teachers;  (iii) \nprovision  of  sanitary  facilities  such  as  toilets,  sanitation,  and  water  supply,  which  will  help  prevent  female  students  from \ndropping out; and (iv) establishment of  a capacity-building mechanism for female administrators and teachers. The gender \neducation action plans will be facilitated by various stakeholders including the Committee for the Advancement of Women and \nthe  Women\u2019s  Union  in  Viet  Nam.  To  assist  the  smooth  implementation  of  gender  development  activities,  the  Project  will \nprovide a  gender  education specialist  for  9  person-months.  These  activities  will  be  implemented  in  the  project period from \n2005 to 2010, in close linkage with other relevant activities to maximize their synergy. To ensure that gender development \nactivities  under  the  Project  improve  access  and  quality  of  LSE  for  female  students,  the  Project  plans  to  establish  a  solid \nmonitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework. M&E specialist-Team Leader with participation of the beneficiary communities \nand  local  people  to  maintain  transparency  and  accountability.  The  reporting  system  will  also  be  established. Quarterly, \nmidterm, and final reports will be required to present the achievement of the activities against the original goal and objectives. \nPeriodical data on gender and ethnic minorities will be updated in these reports as well.    \nHas an output been prepared? \n                                                      The ethnic minorities and gender action plan has been prepared (see Appendix 14). \n\n    Yes\n\n   No  \n\nE.

The  resettlement  framework has \nbeen prepared (see Appendix 12). \n \n \nThe  poor  families  in  rural  areas  have  to  contribute  a \ncertain  percentage  of  their  income  for  the  education  of \ntheir  children.    The  Project  will  improve  affordability  by \nsupporting  school  construction,  boarding \nfacilities, \nteaching equipment for boarding schools. \n \n \n\n \nThe  Project  will  operate  in  28  provinces  with  a  high \nnumber  of  ethnic  minorities  and  rural  population.  Nine \nboarding  schools  will  be  established  in  priority  areas. \nThus, the ethnic minority population will benefit more from \nthe  Project.  It  will  deliver  in-service  training  on  the \npsychology,  customs  and  living  styles  and  indigenous \nlanguages  of  the  ethnic  minorities  to  enable  teachers  to \ndeliver best support for ethnic minority students. Materials \non  career  orientation  for  ethnic  minority  and  female \nstudents will be developed.   Gender and ethnic minority- \nresponsive  training  curriculum  will  be  developed.

It  also  varies  among \nethnic  groups.    Dropout  and  repetition  rates  among  ethnic  minority  students  are  high.  It  is  a \ngreat  challenge  to  achieve  universal  lower  secondary  education  in  Viet  Nam  by  2015  if  the \nsituation is not improved. \n\n \n2. \nThe  ethnic  minority  population  often  reside  in  remote  and  disadvantaged areas, which \nare characterized by poor physical infrastructure, lack of basic services, and poorly developed \neconomy. Every ethnic group preserves its own traditions, culture, and language. To encourage \nethnic  minorities,  especially  female  students  to  attend  lower  secondary  education,  special \nattention and actions, as indicated in Table A14 are needed during project implementation.  \n \n\nTable A14: Ethnic Minorities and Gender Action Plan \n\n \n\nComponent/Activities \n\nApproaches/Monitoring Indicators \n\nComponent 1:  Improving Quality and Efficiency of Lower Secondary Education \n\nNew curriculum implementation \n\nImproving teaching contents and methods   \u2022  Deploy  new  teaching  methods  aligned  with  the  new \n\n\u2022  Construct more classrooms, subject classrooms, and libraries to \nfacilitate the implementation of a new curriculum in ethnic \nminority areas. Provide teaching equipment for lower secondary \nschools, including nine ethnic minority boarding schools. \n\n\u2022  Develop  extra  teaching  materials  that  are  more  appropriate  for \nethnic  students  and  female  students,  and  which  teachers  can \nuse during the school year and on summer holidays.   \n\n\u2022 \n\nlower \nsecondary education curriculum, through in-service activities and \ndevelop  materials  appropriate  for  ethnic  minorities  and  female \nstudents. \n\nImprove teachers' subject matter and pedagogical knowledge in \nvarious  ways.  This  component  is  to  continue  and  reinforce  the \nimprovement  in  teaching  contents  and  methods,  by  reviewing \nand completing the nationwide introduction of the new curriculum \nand textbook for grade 9 and related in-service teacher training. \nInstruction  materials  for  each  of  15  subjects  will  be  given  for \nabout  260,000  teachers,  70,000  mentors,  trainers,  school \nprincipals,  and  4,500  trainers  on  distance  learning.
