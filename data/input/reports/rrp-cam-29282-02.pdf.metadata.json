The  Project will upgrade \nthe  water  supply  systems  in  six  provincial  towns,  develop  a \nwastewater  collection  and  treatment  system  in  Sihanoukville, \nimprove community sanitation conditions in selected communities, \nand help mobilize resources at the local government level.  \n \nWater  supply  systems  and  environmental  sanitation  in  provincial \ntowns deteriorated severely during the 1970s and 1980s because \nof  war,  ineffectual  management,  and  lack  of  maintenance.  The \nrapid  population  increase  in  urban  centers  has  aggravated  the \nsituation. Inadequate potable water supply and sanitation systems \nhave  resulted  in  deteriorating  environment  and  public  health \nconditions in the urban centers. Almost 20% of children die before \nreaching  the  age  of  five,  and  waterborne  diseases   account  for \nabout 30% of hospitalizations. \n \nCambodia\u2019s  provincial  towns  serve  as  economic  centers  for  the \nrural areas and link the country's rural and urban economies. The \ntowns  are  the  immediate  markets,  transportation  depots,  and \nprocessing  centers  for  agricultural  products  in  the  provinces. \nImproving  urban  services,  including  water  supply  and  sanitation, \nin the provincial towns will contribute to poverty reduction in both \nrural  and  urban  areas.  It  will  also  complement  other  social \ndevelopment  programs  such  as  primary  health.  In  addition,  the \ndevelopment  of  provincial  towns  will  help  absorb  the  rural \nmigrants  and  reduce  pressures  on  the  urban  environment, \ninfrastructure, and employment in the capital city of Phnom Penh. \nThe Project is expected to bring about long-term positive social and \nenvironmental impacts. \n \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\nObjectives  \n\nCost Estimates \n\nFinancing Plan \n \n\n \n\nThe  Project  is  expected  to  improve  basic  urban  services,  public \nhealth,  and  the  urban  environment  in  seven  towns:  Battambang, \nKampot, Kompong Cham, Kompong Thom, Pursat, Sihanoukville, \nand  Svay  Rieng.  The  Project  was  developed  on  the  basis  of \nsocioeconomic  surveys  and  extensive  consultation  with  the \ncentral  and  provincial  governments, \nlocal  communities, \nnongovernment  organizations,  and  potential  beneficiaries.  The \nProject consists of five parts. \n \nPart  A:  Community  sanitation  and  health  awareness. \nSanitation conditions in the poor communities in the Project towns \nwill be improved through community education and participation in \nsubproject  design,  cost  sharing,  and  operation  and  maintenance. \nAbout 3,500 households in the Project towns will benefit from the \nprogram.  \n \nPart  B:  Water  supply.  Water  supply  in  Battambang,  Kampot, \nKompong Cham, Kompong Thom, Pursat, and Svay Rieng will be \nimproved. The subprojects will involve the provision, upgrading, or \nrehabilitation of the facilities for water intake and production, and \nreplacement and extension of the reticulation networks.  \n \nPart  C:  Wastewater  management.  A  sewage  collection  and \ntreatment  system  with  a  capacity  of  5,700  cubic  meters  per  day \nwill be designed and constructed in Sihanoukville. \n \nPart  D:  Local  governance  and  resource  mobilization.  The \nessential structure for urban local governance will be studied and \nrevenues at the local level improved.  \n \nPart E: Implementation assistance.  The  assistance will cover: \n(i)  consulting  services  for  community  development,  engineering \ndesign,  construction  supervision,  and  project  management \nsupport; (ii) project administration equipment and facilities; and (iii) \ntraining.  \n \nThe  cost  of  the  approved  Project  was  estimated  at  $26.3  million \nequivalent,  including  $18.3  million  in  foreign  exchange  and  $8.0 \nmillion  equivalent  in  local  currency.  The  reappraised  cost  of  the \nProject  is  estimated  at  $34.6  million  equivalent,  consisting  of \n$23.6 million in foreign exchange, and $11.0 million equivalent in \nlocal  currency.  The  cost  increase  is  $8.2  million  equivalent, \ncomprising  $5.2  million  in  foreign  exchange  and  $3  million \nequivalent in local currency. \n \n\nIt is proposed that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide a \nsupplementary loan of $6.3 million to cover 76% of the estimated \ncost increase, with the balance to be covered by the Government \nof Cambodia. The financing plan for the original loan is as follows: \n\n\fSource \n\nAsian Development Bank \nAsian Development Assistance Facility \nGovernment \nLocal Communities \n\n \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff estimates. \n \nLoan Amount and Terms \n\nTotal \n\nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n\nProcurement \n\nv \n\nForeign \nExchange \n18.17 \n0.13 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n18.30 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n1.83 \n0.10 \n5.87 \n0.20 \n8.00 \n\nTotal \nCosts \n20.00 \n0.23 \n5.87 \n0.20 \n26.30 \n\nPercent \n\n76.0 \n0.9 \n22.3 \n0.8 \n100.0 \n\n \n\nfor \n\nthe \n\n \nThe  equivalent  of  SDR14,533,000  ($20.0  million)  has  been \nprovided  in  various  currencies  from  ADB's  Special  Funds \nresources for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears;  and  with  an  interest  rate  of  1%  per  annum  during  the \ngrace period, and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The equivalent of \nSDR4,546,000  ($6.3  million)  will  be  provided  under \nthe \nproposed supplementary loan, with the same terms as those of \nthe original loan. \n \nUntil 30 June 2006 \n \n31 December 2005 \n \n \nProject management units (PMUs) established at the  Ministry of \nIndustry,  Mines  and  Energy  (MIME)  and  the  Ministry  of  Public \nthe \nWorks  and  Transport  (MPWT)  are  responsible \nimplementation of the Project. A project implementation unit has \nbeen  set  up  in  each  project  town  to  be  supervised  and \ncoordinated  by \ntwo  PMUs.  An  urban  management \ncommittee  has  been  established  in  the  towns  where  project \nactivities need coordination. \n \nMIME  for  parts  A  and  B,  and  MPWT  for  parts  C  and  D.  Both \nagencies will implement their respective components of part E. \n \nGoods and services financed by ADB under the Project will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \nCivil works and supply contracts estimated to cost more than $1 \nmillion  and  $0.5  million,  respectively,  will  be  carried  out  under \ninternational  competitive  bidding  (ICB).  Minor  civil  works \ncontracts under part A will  be procured under local competitive \nbidding.  Equipment  and  vehicles  will  be  procured  under \ninternational  shopping  procedures  for  contracts  valued  at \n$500,000 or less, and direct purchase procedures for contracts \nvalued at $100,000 or less.  Funds from the supplementary loan \nwill  be  used  to  finance  two  civil  works  contracts:  one  for  water \nsupply  in  two  towns,  and  one  for  Alternate  3  balance  of  works \nfor the Sihanoukville wastewater management system. The civil \nworks  contracts  will  be  awarded  to  the  winning  bidders, \nselected following ICB procedures under the approved Project, \nthrough direct negotiations.  \n \n\n\f \nConsulting Services \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nvi \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nfinanced  by  ADB  were  procured \n\n \nConsulting  services \nin \naccordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants, \nand  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging \ndomestic consultants. A total of 340 (128 international and 212 \ndomestic)  person-months  of  consulting  services  were \nenvisaged  under  the  original  loan  for  engineering  design, \nconstruction  supervision,  community  development, \nlocal \nresource  mobilization,  and  project  management  assistance. \nAdditional 33 (13 international and 20 domestic) person-months \nof  consulting  services  will  be  required  to  cover  the  extended \nperiod of construction supervision.  \n \nThe  Project  will  benefit  about  350,000  people,  about  30%  of \nwhom  live  below  the  poverty  line.  Corresponding  benefits \ninclude  time  and  cost  savings  from  buying,  fetching,  treating, \nand  storing  water;  improved  public  and  family  hygiene  and \nhealth;  reduced  medical  outlays;  increased  productive  days; \nand more employment opportunities. \n \n\n\f \n\nv\n\ni\ni\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nsupplementary loan to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Provincial Towns Improvement Project. \n \n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nfinancing.  The \n\nin  1997.2  Based  on \n\n2. \nIn  1995,  the  Government  of  Cambodia  requested  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for \nassistance in rehabilitating the water supply and sanitation facilities in the major urban centers \nof the country. ADB approved project preparatory technical assistance (TA)1 to the Government \nin November 1996 to help prepare a feasibility study of an urban development project suitable \nfor  ADB \nthe \nfeasibility  study  was  carried  out \nrecommendations of the feasibility study and findings of ADB loan processing missions in 1999, \nADB  approved  Loan  1725-CAM(SF):  Provincial  Towns  Improvement  Project  for  $20  million \nequivalent from ADB\u2019s Asian Development Fund on 17 December 1999. The Loan Agreement \nwas  signed  on  2  February  2000  and  the  loan  was  declared  effective  on  11  April  2000.  The \nProject envisaged an implementation period of 5.5 years, with an estimated project completion \ndate of 30 June 2005, and a loan closing date of 31 December 2005.  \n \n3. \nIn January and March 2003, the Government, realizing a significant cost overrun of the \nProject,  requested  ADB  to  provide  a  supplementary  loan  to  cover  the  additional  cost  of  the \nProject.  The  Government  informed  ADB  that,  due  to  fiscal  constraints,  it  could  not  finance  the \ncost overrun from its own resources, and that it had contacted other development agencies for \nassistance but no resources with a suitable time frame were available. The Government  further \nconfirmed that water supply, sanitation, and environmental protection were priority development \nareas of the Government and the Project continued to be accorded development priority. Based \non  the  request,  ADB  fielded  a  supplementary  Loan  Reconnaissance  Mission  in  January\u2013\nFebruary  2003,  and  a  Reappraisal  Mission  in  July  2003.  The  missions  reviewed  the \nmacroeconomic  situation  of  the  country,  implementation  status  of  the  Project,  and  technical, \nfinancial,  economic,  environmental,  social,  and \nthe  proposed \nsupplementary  loan;  and  reached  an  understanding  with  Government  agencies  concerned  on \nkey  parameters  of  the  proposed  supplementary  loan.  A  project  framework  is  presented  in \nAppendix 1. \n \n\ninstitutional  aspects  of \n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Growth, Urbanization, and Poverty \n\n4. \nIn  the  1990s,  Cambodia  was  transformed  from  an  agricultural  economy  to  one \ndominated  by  industry  and  services.  During  1990-2000,  the  share  of  agriculture  in  gross \ndomestic  product  declined  from  about  51%  to  38%,  while  the  share  of  industry and services \nincreased  from  49%  to  62%.  Along  with  the  economic  transformation,  rapid  urbanization  took \nplace. The urban population growth rate peaked to 8.4% in the early 1990s before it declined to \nabout 4% per annum. It is projected that up to 2005, the urban population will grow at an annual \nrate  of  around  3.4%,  compared  with  a  national  average  growth  rate  of  about  2.5%.  The  rapid \nincrease of the urban population and dilapidated urban infrastructure, resulting from destruction \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 1996. Technical Assistance to Cambodia for the Integrated Urban Development Project. Manila. \n2   The fragile coalition government eventually broke up in July 1997. As a result, ADB suspended its operations in the \n\ncountry till the new government was established after the general election in July 1998. \n\n\f2 \n\nand  negligence  during  the  1970s  and  1980s,  have  caused  the  urban  environment  and  public \nhealth, particularly among the urban poor, to deteriorate.  \n \n5. \nPoverty  is  pervasive  in  Cambodia.  Calculating  the  cost  of  food  and  nonfood \nrequirements  in  Cambodia  in  1997,  the  Government  estimated  the  overall  poverty  line  to  be \nKR1,407 ($0.36) per capita per day in urban areas other than Phnom Penh. About 30% of the \nurban population in the provincial towns were living below the poverty line. One characteristic of \nCambodian  urban  poverty  is  lack  of  access  to  basic  services  such  as  water  supply  and \nsanitation. \n \nB. \n\nProvincial Water Supply and Sanitation \n\nMost  urban  centers  suffer  from  poor  water  supply  and  sanitation.  Only  8.5%  of  the \n6. \nhouseholds in the provincial towns have access to private or public tap water, and 58% of the \npeople  living  in  the  provincial  towns  draw  water  from  unprotected  sources.  About  58%  of  the \nhouseholds  living  in  these  towns  do  not  have  access  to  any  sanitation  facilities.  The  cost  of \npurchasing, treating, and storing water; the medical expenses for waterborne diseases; and lost \nproductive time due to water fetching or illness are much higher to the poor as a percentage of \ntheir incomes. The socioeconomic survey conducted during the feasibility study  of the Project \nindicates that in the project towns residents without house connections pay 2.5\u20134 times higher \nfor water than those with house connections.  \n \n7. \nThe  water  supply  systems  in  most  of  the  urban  centers  were  built  in  the  1920s  and \n1930s,  and  their  production  capacity  can  no  longer  meet  the  demand  of  today's  urban \npopulation. The treatment plants have fallen into disuse, the distribution systems are in disrepair \nwith  average  leakage  rates  of  around  60%,  and  lack  of  pressure  in  the  pipelines has allowed \npolluted  groundwater  to  enter  the  water  supply  systems.  Insufficient  production  capacities, \nleaking distribution networks, and intermittent power supply limit water supply in most towns to a \nfew  hours  per  day  and  to  limited  areas  only.  Major urban centers have combined stormwater \nand sewage drainage systems, which were constructed during the same period as those of the \nwater  supply.  The  systems  have  no  treatment  facilities  and  were  basically  designed  to  drain \nonly the commercial and market areas of towns. Untreated sewage flows into nearby rivers and \nwater  bodies  and  polluted  the  environment.  The  haphazard  dumping  of  solid  waste  into  the \ndrainage systems blocked the pipes and collection manholes.  \n \nC. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans \n\n8. \nThe  Government  stated  in  its  first  5-year  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan  (SEDP), \n1996\u20132000,  that  the  primary  objectives  of  its  development  strategy  are  to  reduce  poverty  and \ndevelop the country\u2019s human resource base. The strategy emphasizes a balanced approach to \nrural development, assistance to the urban poor, and development of major urban growth poles. \nThe  SEDP  accords  high  development  priority  to  water  supply  and  sanitation  in  urban  centers. \nThe  Government\u2019s  long-term  development  objectives  in  the  provincial  towns  are  to  supply \naffordable  water  that  meets  the  drinking  water  quality  standards,3  with  adequate  supply  to  at \nleast  70%  of  the  provincial  urban  population.  The  long-term  objectives  for  sanitation  are  to \nenable  the  population  as  a  whole  to  have  access  to  environmental  sanitation  facilities,  and \nestablish treatment for wastewater in all provincial towns.  \n \n\n                                                 \n3   The World Health Organization\u2019s standards are currently used until the national standards are approved. \n\n\f3 \n\nImproving access of the poor to water supply and sanitation, and promoting sustainable \n9. \nmanagement of the environment continue to be key  development strategies of SEDP II, 2001\u2013\n2005.  The  Government  will  promote  wider  provision  of  affordable  potable  water  supply  and \nsanitation,  as  it  contributes  broadly  to  tackling  the  causes  of  poverty  and  improving  public \nhealth.  SEDP  II  also  recognizes  that  untreated  wastewater  is  a  significant  problem  leading  to \nthe pollution of rivers.  \n \n10. \nSince 1999, the Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Energy (MIME) has been working on an \nurban water supply policy. The policy calls for (i) a demand\u2013responsive approach in developing \nnew water supply systems in the urban centers, (ii) a wide range of private sector participation \nin  providing  the  services,  (iii)  full  cost  recovery  and  improvement  in  tariff  collection  efficiency, \n(iv) access  of  the  poor  to  improved  water  supply  systems,  (v)  financial  autonomy  of  public \nutilities,  and  (vi)  establishment  of  an  independent  regulator  for  the  water  supply  sector.  This \npolicy  was  later  combined  with  the  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  policy  and  became  the \nNational  Policy  on  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation,  which  was  approved  by  the  Council  of \nMinisters  in  February  2003.  MIME  has  been  working  with  ADB,  World  Bank,  World  Health \nOrganization  (WHO),  and  other  development  agencies  in  establishing  national  drinking  water \nquality  standards;  MIME  has  also  been  working,  with  assistance  from  the  World  Bank,  on \nsetting  up  the  standards  for  designing  and  constructing  piped  water  supply  systems  in  both \nurban and rural areas, and on establishing a regulatory framework for the water supply sector. \n \nD. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n11. \nADB\u2019s assistance to the urban sector in Cambodia started in 1993 when ADB approved \na  small-scale  TA  to  assess  the  needs  of  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  sectors.4  The  TA \nrecommendations  led  to  assistance  for  an  urban  water  supply  and  sanitation  project,5  and, \nsubsequently,  the  preparation  of  the  Phnom  Penh  Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Project.6 To \nimprove the institutional capacity of the Department of Potable Water Supply7 under MIME, ADB \napproved  TA8  to  provide  essential  training  on  technical,  financial,  and  management  skills  and \ndevelop a database on provincial waterworks covering physical and financial assets as well as \nhuman  resources.  In  1996,  ADB  approved  TA  for  preparing  an  integrated  urban  development \nproject that eventually led to Loan 1725-CAM(SF): Provincial Towns Improvement Project.  \n \n12. \nOther  key  development  agencies  in  the  sector  include  the  World  Bank  and  the \nGovernments of France and Japan. The World Bank approved an urban water supply project in \nFebruary 1998 to augment water production capacity in Phnom Penh, improve water supply and \nmanagement in Sihanoukville, and upgrade the accounting systems of water supply authorities \nin  both  Phnom  Penh  and  Sihanoukville.  The  World  Bank  is  currently  working  with  the \nGovernment on a water supply and sanitation program covering about 140 semiurban centers \nover  the  next  15  years.  The  Government  of  Japan  has  been  helping  the  Government \nrehabilitate  the  Phum  Prek  water  treatment  plant  and  a  part  of  the  distribution  networks  in \nPhnom  Penh,  and  prepare  a  drainage  and  flood  control  master  plan  for  Phnom  Penh.  The \nGovernment  of  France  has  provided  significant  assistance  for  water  supply,  drainage,  and \nenvironmental protection. It has supported the improvement of the billing system in the Phnom \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB. 1993.

Manila. \n\n\f4 \n\nPenh  Water  Supply  Authority,  and  the  increase  in  production  capacity  of  the  Chamcar  Morn \nwater  treatment  plant.  Under  the  ADB-financed  Phnom  Penh  Water  Supply  and  Drainage \nProject,  the  Norwegian  Agency  for  Development  Cooperation  (NORAD)  cofinanced  a \nneighborhood  improvement  program,  under  which  a  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)  is \nemployed  to  conduct  a  community  awareness  and  education  program  aimed  at  improving \nsanitation conditions in low-income communities.  \n \n13. \nOver  the  years,  ADB  has  been  coordinating  well  with  other  development  agencies  in \nboth  physical  investments  and  a  wide  range  of  policy  and  project-related  issues,  including \nautonomy of water utilities, private sector participation, water tariffs, national water supply and \nsanitation policies, and drinking water quality standards. An updated list of external assistance \nto the sector is presented in Appendix 2. \n \nE. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n14.  Major lessons learned with regard to sustainable sector development  and timely project \nimplementation  include  the  need  for  cost  recovery,  adequate  funding  for  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M), community participation and education, and institutional capacity building. \nA major cause of unsustainable projects in the sector, mostly assisted by external agencies, is \nlack  of  O&M  funds.  Actions  to  generate  adequate  financial  resources  for  project  O&M, \nespecially  for  those  components  where  a  direct  user  charge  is  difficult  to  apply,  should  be \nidentified  and  discussed  with  concerned  Government  agencies  during  policy  dialogue.  Great \nefforts  have  to  be  made  to  develop  a  feasible  cost  recovery  mechanism.  If  cost  recovery  is \nthrough indirect means such as development charges or local fees, management and auditing \nof the additional revenues and expenditure should be considered in the project design.  \n \n15. \nThe  ADB-financed  Phnom  Penh  Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Project  included  a \ncommunity awareness and education program cofinanced by NORAD to encourage community \nparticipation  in  project  planning  and  implementation,  and  to  educate  the  urban  residents  on \nenvironmental sanitation matters. Initial success has led the Government and NORAD to agree \nto  expand  the  program's  coverage  and  extend  its  duration.  The  findings  of  the  program  are \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  other  developing  member  countries,  that  community \ninvolvement in planning and implementing projects leads to a greater sense of ownership and \nenhanced sustainability of the services.  \n \n16. \nInstitutional strengthening and capacity building are essential for project implementation \nand  long-term  sustainability.  Severe  shortage  of  skilled  personnel,  a  legacy  of  recent  eventful \nhistory,  is  a  major  constraining  factor  in  project  design.  Consulting  services  under  the  Project \nwill provide necessary technical support for project management. The Project will also provide \non-the-job  training  to  the  officials  involved  in  project  implementation.  It  is  expected  that \ncapacities  of  the  institutions  involved  in  the  Project  will  be  further  strengthened  during \nimplementation.  A  major  lesson  learned  from  the  ADB  financed  projects  in  the  sector  is  that \nminimizing the number of procurement contracts will substantially simplify implementation. This \nis  especially  relevant  for  executing  agencies  (EAs)  with  limited  experience  in  managing \nexternally funded projects.  \n \nF. \n\nADB's Sector Strategy \n\nADB\u2019s  strategy  for  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  sectors  in  the  country  supports  the \n17. \nGovernment\u2019s development objective of  reducing poverty and developing the country\u2019s human \nresource base. It recognizes that scarce financial and human resources and weak institutional \n\n\f5 \n\ncapacities are the key constraints to the sector's development. The thrusts of the strategy are to \n(i)  support  the  Government\u2019s  reform  initiatives  to  create  a  conducive  legal,  policy,  and \ninstitutional framework for sustainable sectoral development; (ii) emphasize institutional capacity \nbuilding;  and  (iii)  link  assistance  with  cost  recovery  potential  and  institutional  capacities. \nOperationally,  the  strategy  requires  (i)  participation  of  beneficiaries,  particularly  women  and \nlocal communities, in project planning, design, implementation, and O&M; (ii) the development \nand  utilization  of  affordable  and  appropriate \ntechnologies;  (iii)  clearly  defined  O&M \nresponsibilities and financing sources; and (iv) well-defined cost recovery mechanisms that are \naffordable, equitable, and manageable. Crosscutting issues such as poverty reduction, women \nin development, and environmental protection remain the central concerns of the strategy.   \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE APPROVED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n18. \nIt has been recognized that substantial improvement of the living standards of the rural \npoor, who account for 84% of the total population, is closely linked with economic development \nin urban centers. The expected benefits of rural development can be realized only if farmers are \nable  to  sell  their  increased  agricultural  produce  to  the  urban  economy  in  exchange  for  new \nfarming  equipment,  fertilizer,  seeds,  technology,  and  better  consumption  goods.  Rural \ndevelopment,  therefore,  is  correlated  to  the  absorptive  capacity  of  the  urban  economy  for \nincreased  rural  produce.  The  provincial  towns  serve  as  the  economic  centers  for  the  rural \nhinterland in the provinces, and the links between the rural and urban economies in the country. \nThese  towns  are  the  immediate  markets,  transport  depots,  and  processing  centers  for \nagricultural produce from the provinces. They also provide part\u2013time employment opportunities, \nand  hence  additional  income,  for  poor  farmers  during  the  slack  seasons.  Improving  urban \nservices, including water supply and sanitation, in the provincial towns will therefore contribute \nto poverty reduction in both rural and urban areas. \n \n19. \nThe selection of the project towns took into consideration the geographic concentration \nof  ADB\u2019s  previous  assistance  and  the  economic  growth  potential,  the  status  of  cost  recovery, \nand  institutional  capabilities  of  the  provincial  towns.  Four  selected  towns?Svay  Rieng, \nKompong Cham, Kampot, and Sihanoukville?are in areas under ADB\u2019s first Rural Infrastructure \nImprovement Project.9 The three other towns?Battambang, Kompong Thom, and Pursat?are \nalong the major national highways where ADB is the major multilateral development institution \nproviding  financial  assistance.10  Battambang,  located  near  the  Cambodian-Thai  border  and \nalong national highway No. 5, is the largest provincial town and has the potential to become the \nmajor  trade  center  in  the  northern  part  of  Cambodia.  The  seaport  and  tourist  resources  in \nSihanoukville  make  it  the  fastest  growing  town  in  the  country.  Transport  services  and  tourism \nwill continue contribute significantly to its economic growth. Kompong Cham is the capital town \nof  traditionally  the  richest  province  of  the  country  and  has  the  potential  to  become  the  major \ncenter  of  agro-industries.  With  the  improvement  of  the  highways  along  the  transportation \ncorridor  connecting  Viet  Nam  and  Thailand,  economic  development  in  these  and  other  project \ntowns is expected to take off rapidly. \n \n20. \nThe current urban and environmental conditions in the provincial towns have an adverse \nimpact on people's health and life quality, and are constraining the economic growth potential of \n\n                                                 \n9   ADB. 1995.

Improving  urban  services,  including  water  supply  and  sanitation,  in  the  provincial \ntowns is also closely linked to the objectives of other social development programs in the urban \ncenters, such as primary health care. In addition, the development of provincial towns will help \nabsorb the rural migrants  and  reduce  pressures  on  the  urban  environment,  infrastructure,  and \nemployment in the capital city of Phnom Penh. \n \nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope  \n\nThe  Project  aims  to  improve  the  urban  environment,  public  health,  and  basic  urban \n21. \nservices in seven towns to support the Government\u2019s development objective of reducing urban \npoverty through sustained economic growth. The major project components are as follows.  \n \n\n1. \n\nPart A. Community Sanitation and Health Awareness Program \n\n22. \nSanitation  conditions  in  the  poor  communities  of  the  project  towns  will  be  improved \nthrough  community  participation  in  subproject  design  and  cost  sharing.  The  communities \nselected  will  contribute  in  kind  to  the  capital  cost  for  house  connections  or  on-site sanitation \nfacilities.  The  component  will  cover  the  cost  of  underground  structure  for  on-site  sanitation \nfacilities,  and  cleaning  and  repairing  community  drains.  About  3,500  poor  households  in  the \nproject towns are expected to benefit from the program. A community sanitation committee will \nbe set up in each of the selected poor communities to coordinate activities related to the project \ndesign and in-kind contribution arrangements. The project management unit (PMU) will provide \ntechnical  support  to  the  community  sanitation  committees.  This  component  will  also  provide \nfunds to prepare a program on cost recovery, sanitation, and health awareness to be broadcast \nby Government television and radio stations. \n \n\n2. \n\nPart B. Water Supply \n\nThis component will improve water supply conditions in Battambang, Kampot, Kompong \n23. \nCham,  Kompong  Thom,  Pursat,  and  Svay  Rieng.  The  subprojects  will  construct,  upgrade,  or \nrehabilitate the water production facilities (river intakes, deep wells, and treatment plants), and \nupgrade  or  extend  the  reticulation  networks.  The  reticulation  extension  will  include  direct \nconnections to individual consumers, as well as community water supply points for low-income \nhouseholds.  The  Project  will  provide  training  in  leakage  detection,  O&M,  and  preventive \nmaintenance.  Provincial  waterworks  will  acquire  laboratory  equipment  and  materials  for  water \nquality monitoring.  \n \n\n3. \n\nPart C. Wastewater Management \n\n24. \nA  sewage  collection  and  transmission  network,  and  a  treatment  plant  in  Sihanoukville \nwith a capacity of 5,700  cubic meters per day will be designed and built. The works include (i) \ninstalling  about  13  kilometers  (km)  of  interceptor  and  trunk  mains,  44  km  of  reticulation  pipes, \nand  3,300  property  connections;  and  (ii)  constructing  anaerobic  ponds,  facultative  ponds, \nmaturation ponds, and inlet and outlet sparges and outlet weirs.  \n \n\n4. \n\nPart D. Local Governance and Resource Mobilization \n\n25. \nThe  component  reviews  the  current  legal  and  administrative  structure  of  the  provincial/ \nmunicipal governments of Battambang, Kompong Cham, and Sihanoukville, and recommends a \ncomprehensive  legal  and  institutional  reform  action  plan  to  improve  local  government  financial \npositions  and  fully  decentralize  the  authority  for  urban  development  and  management.  It  also \n\n\f7 \n\nreviews  the  current  and  potential  revenue  base  of  the  municipality  of  Sihanoukville,  and \nrecommends  an  immediate  action  plan  for  the  municipality  of  Sihanoukville  to  expand  its \nrevenues within the existing legal and institutional framework to cover the anticipated O&M cost \nof  the  wastewater  management  system  to  be  constructed  under  the  Project.  The  revenues \ncollected under the immediate action plan will be put in an earmarked account and will be used \nfor  the  wastewater  management  system  in  Sihanoukville.  The  earmarked  account  will  be \nsubject to auditing under the Project.  \n \n\n5. \n\nPart E. Implementation Assistance \n\n26. \nThis component covers (i) consulting services for community development, engineering \ndesign,  construction  supervision,  and  project  management  support;  (ii)  project administration \nequipment and facilities; and (iii) training.  \n \nC. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nThe cost of the approved Project, including physical and price contingencies and interest \n27. \nduring construction, was estimated at $26.3 million equivalent. The foreign exchange cost was \n$18.3  million,  70%  of  the  total.  The  local  currency  cost,  including  duties  and  taxes,  was  $8.0 \nmillion equivalent, 30% of the total. \n \n28. \nADB provided a loan of $20.0 million equivalent from its Special Funds resources with a \nterm of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The ADB loan covers 76% of the total project \ncost  including  $18.2  million  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $1.8  million  equivalent  of  the  local \ncurrency  cost.  The  New  Zealand  Government,  through  its  Asia  Development  Assistance \nFacility, cofinanced, on a parallel basis, a part of the consulting services (project management \nsupport) for about $0.2 million. The balance of $6.1 million equivalent of the local currency cost \nis  financed  by  the  Government  and  local  communities.  The  Borrower  is  the  Kingdom  of \nCambodia. The Government transfers the project funds to MIME and Ministry of Public Works \nand Transport (MPWT) through budgetary allocation. The financing plan of the approved Project \nis shown in Table 1. \n \n\nTable 1: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nLocal \nCurrency \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nSource \n\n \nADB \nADAF \nGovernment \nLocal Communities \n\n \n18.17 \n0.13 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n18.30 \nADAF = Asia Development Assistance Facility, ADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff estimates. \n \nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n1.83 \n0.10 \n5.87 \n0.20 \n8.00 \n\nTotal \n\nTotal \nCosts \n \n20.00 \n0.23 \n5.87 \n0.20 \n26.30 \n\nPercent \n\n \n76.00 \n0.90 \n22.30 \n0.80 \n100.00 \n\n29.  MIME is the EA for parts A and B, MPWT for parts C and D. MIME and MPWT have set \nup,  respectively,  a  PMU  at  the  central  level,  and  the  provincial/municipal  governments  in  the \nproject towns have set up their respective project implementation units (PIUs). The Project was \nexpected  to  be  implemented  over  5.5  years  and  be  completed  by  mid\u20132005.  The  approved \n\n\f8 \n\nProject  has  been  progressing  well.  All  civil  works  financed  under  the  original  loan  will  be \ncompleted  before  the  original  Project  completion  date.  Major  civil  works  for  the  water  supply \ncomponent  in  six  towns  were  combined  into  two  contracts,  and  one  (four  towns)  has  been \nawarded  following  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures.  The  civil  works  for  the \nSihanoukville  wastewater  management  system  were  divided  into  two  ICB  contracts,  and  one \n(Alternate  2  partial  works)  has  been  awarded.  A  contract  for  community  sanitation  and  health \nawareness program has been awarded following local competitive bidding procedures.  \n \nThe  municipality  of  Sihanoukville  had  acquired  the  land  for  the  wastewater  treatment \n30. \nplant prior to the start of the Project. Detailed design revealed that, while no resettlement would \nbe incurred, additional rights-of-way would have to be acquired and some structures dismantled \nfor  laying  the  trunk  sewers.  Short  resettlement  plans,11  following  ADB  guidelines,  have  been \nprepared by MPWT and reviewed by ADB. Comments from ADB have been incorporated in the \nrevised plans and the final short resettlement plans were submitted to ADB on 6 July 2003. The \nMinistry of Economy and Finance (MEF) has confirmed availability of a budget for implementing \nthe  short  resettlement  plans.  The  water  supply  component  needs  two  pieces  of  land,  one  in \nPursat (10,707 m2, three owners), and one in Kompong Thom (735 m2, one owner). MIME has \nprepared  a  short  resettlement  plan,  which  had  been  reviewed  and  approved  by  ADB,  and \ncompleted  land  acquisition.  The  Project-affected  persons  and  MIME  have  negotiated  and \nagreed on the compensation based on market values. The short resettlement plan prepared by \nMIME  is  presented  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A,  and  those  prepared  by  MPWT  in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n \nE. \n\nEnvironment and Social Measures \n\n31. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B  and  initial  environmental \nexaminations  (IEEs)  were  conducted  during  the  feasibility  study  of  the  approved  Project.  The \nIEEs concluded that environmental impacts during Project construction and operation would be \nimpact  assessment  would  be  needed.  Minimization  of \nminor,  and  no  environmental \nenvironmental disturbances such as noise and dust during construction has been considered in \nthe  detailed  design,  and  appropriate  environmental  management  requirements  have  been \nincluded  in  the  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs).  All  contractors  will  be  required  to \nreinstate  affected  areas  to  their  original,  or  a  better,  condition.  Adequately  planned  preventive \nmaintenance programs will be developed for all facilities constructed under the Project, and safe \nworking  practices  at  international  standards  will  be  adopted  in  both  the  construction  and \noperational  phases.  To  ensure  that  water  to  be  supplied  under  the  Project  meets  the  national \ndrinking water quality standards in the six project towns, and the discharges at the Sihanoukville \nwastewater treatment plant satisfies the Government's environmental requirements, the Project \nprovides a budget for laboratory equipment for all the Project towns.  \n\n \nCommunity  and  beneficiary  participation  has  been  encouraged  throughout  project \n32. \npreparation.  Extensive  discussions  have  been  held  with  key  stakeholders  including  central \nGovernment  departments,  provincial  and  municipal  governments,  NGOs,  and  communities. \nSocioeconomic  and  technical  surveys,  key  informant  interviews,  and  public  meetings  were \ncarried out during the feasibility study and detailed design. The Project is designed in response \nto  the  communities\u2019  needs  and  willingness  to  pay.  It  incorporates  social  measures,  such  as \nproviding community water selling points, to ensure that the needs of the disadvantaged social \ngroups for basic urban services will be taken care of, and that there will be equitable access to \n\n                                                 \n11  One for Alternate 2 partial works covering the eastern part of the town, and one for Alternate 3 balance of works, \n\ncovering the southern part of the town. \n\n\f9 \n\nwater supply and sanitation. The Project will expand piped water supply systems into currently \nunserved areas where the low income groups live, and provide reliable water supply at a price \n2\u20133 times lower than that from water vendors. The community sanitation and health awareness \nprogram  is  intended  to  disseminate  knowledge  and  provide  financial  assistance  to  the \ncommunities for improving hygiene practice and sanitation conditions.  \n \nF. \n\nBenefits \n\nThe Project will benefit about 350,000 people, about 30% of whom live below the official \n33. \npoverty  line.  Corresponding  economic  benefits  include  the  time  and  cost  savings from buying, \nfetching,  treating,  and  storing  water;  improved  public  and  family  hygiene  and  health;  reduced \nmedical  outlays;  increased  productive  days  for  adults  and  school  attendance  for  children;  and \nmore  employment  opportunities.  The  project  feasibility  study  carried  out  social  and  gender \nimpact analyses, including impacts of the Project on vulnerable groups such as the urban poor, \nwomen,  and  children.  The  analyses  concluded  that  there  were  overall  positive  social  impacts, \nthe impacts were not gender biased, and all urban residents in the project areas would benefit \nfrom the improved urban environment and services. The positive impacts of the improved urban \nenvironment are more evident for women, children, and the urban poor. Statistics show that at \nleast 75% of women living in provincial towns are either self-employed or unpaid family workers. \nSafe and convenient water supply will significantly increase their productive time and reduce the \nburden  of  fetching  water.  Improved  water  supply  will  also  benefit children. Apart from the fact \nthat children are most susceptible to waterborne diseases, Government surveys show that 52% \nof  male  students  and  37%  of  female  students  drop  out  of  school  because  of  the  need  to  help \nwith household chores, of which fetching water is a major one. The poor have fewer choices of \nlocations,  and  therefore  are  prone  to  environmental  hazards  such  as  unsafe  water  supply, \nunsanitary sewage discharge, and solid waste accumulation.  \n \n34. \nSihanoukville  has  become  a  major  destination  for  both  domestic  and  foreign  tourists. \nThe sewage collection and treatment system in Sihanoukville will significantly reduce pollution in \nbeaches,  thus  protecting  the  coastal  environment,  and  promote  tourism  and  the  service \nindustry, hence the employment opportunities, in the city.    \n \n\nV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY LOAN \n\nA. \n\nThe Cost Overrun \n\nCompared  with  the  bidding  results,  the  cost  for  Part  B  (the  six-town  water  supply \n35. \nsystems)  and  part  C  (wastewater  management  system  in  Sihanoukville)  was  substantially \nunderestimated for the approved Project at appraisal, with the base cost for part B estimated at \n$10.8  million,  and  that  for  part  C  at  $5.6  million.  The  bidding  results  for  the  two  components \nshowed the lowest bid price, net of contingencies, of $14.4 million for part B and $9.5 million for \npart C. The key factors contributing to the increase in cost are discussed in paras. 36-40.  \n \n\n1. \n\nProvincial Towns Water Supply Systems \n\n36. \nA comparison of the winning bid and the cost estimates at appraisal shows a significant \ncost  increase  in  the  water  intake  and  treatment  facilities  in  Battambang,  Kampot,  Kompong \nThom, and Pursat. While the feasibility study and appraisal assumed that the existing facilities \ncould  be  rehabilitated  at  lower  cost,  the  design  consultants  recommended  reconstruction  of \nthese  facilities  instead.  Apart  from  technical  considerations,  such  as  water  source  quality  and \nsystem  compatibility,  the  reconstructed  facilities  would  have  a  longer  useful  life  (50  years  if \n\n\f10 \n\nreconstructed  compared  with  15  years  if  rehabilitated),  and  higher  service  level  (100% \ncompared with 60%). Therefore, the high capital cost for reconstruction would be a lower-cost \nsolution  in  the  long  run.  Rehabilitation  at  low  capital  cost  was  preferred  during  the  feasibility \nstudy  and  appraisal  because  of  other  considerations:  political  instability  in  the  Government, \neconomic  inactivity  in  the  provinces,  and  poor  institutional  and  financial  capabilities  at  the \nprovincial waterworks. However, all these aspects have changed significantly since appraisal.  \n \n37. \nAnother major cause of the cost increase is the construction of generator and laboratory \nbuildings and the provision of generators and laboratory equipment and chemicals in the project \ntowns. The feasibility study anticipated that the provincial/municipal electrical supplies would be \nsignificantly  improved  to  provide  reliable  electrical  supplies  when  the  Project  is  completed. \nHowever, the electrical supplies are still unreliable in the project towns at the design stage, and \nthe waterworks would need to install their own generators to ensure smooth operations of their \nwater supply systems. The laboratory facilities were considered necessary at the design stage \nto  meet  the  increasing  demand  of  stakeholders  for  better  water  quality  monitoring  all  over  the \ncountry.  The  laboratories  would  also  be  useful  for  the  local  authorities  to  regulate  local  small \nand medium-sized food processing enterprises.  \n \n38. \nA  change  in  the  chlorination  systems  also  contributes  to  the cost increase.  Presently, \nnone of the project towns chlorinates its water supply, either because there is no chorine dosing \nsystem  in  place,  or  because  of  the  high  cost  of  chemicals  for  the  simple  calcium  hypochlorite \ndosing systems present in some project towns. The feasibility study recommended the provision \nor  repair  of  calcium  hypochlorite  dosing  systems.  However, \nthe  design  consultants \nrecommended  gas  chlorination  systems  instead,  which  are  more  expensive  in  capital \ninvestment, but have a much lower O&M cost and will be less expensive and more effective for \nthe towns in the long run. \n \n39. \nUnit  costs  for  pipeline  construction  appear  to  have  risen  significantly  since  appraisal. \nInstallation  of  pipes  in  the  size  range  most  frequently  employed  in  the  project  (100-200 \nmillimeter  in  diameter),  the  unit  cost  has  risen  by  over  50%.  Since  the  transmission  and \ndistribution pipes typically represent a substantial percentage of the total value of a water supply \nsystem, such cost increases adversely affected the capital cost of the Project. Besides, the unit \nprices used at appraisal did not include separate categories for general items to be furnished by \nthe contractor, such as securities, insurance, office facilities, etc. Such costs, when considered \ncumulatively, substantially increased the value of the contract. \n \n\n2. \n\nSihanoukville Wastewater Management System \n\n40. \nA major cause of the cost overrun for the Sihanoukville wastewater management system \nis  the  change  in  the  diameters  of  trunk  sewers.  The  topographic  survey  conducted  during \ndetailed  design  revealed  that,  to  keep  the  effluent  outlet  at  the  treatment  plant  at  a  level  high \nenough  to  accommodate  tidal  changes  and  flooding  levels,  the  slope  of  the  trunk  sewer  lines \nwould be relatively flat (0.6 meter per 1,000 meter), which in turn requires pipelines with a much \nlarger  diameter  (900  millimeter  vs  450  millimeter,  for  instance),  to  maintain  the  designed \nsewage  flows.  Along  with  the  change  in  the  size  of  the  trunk  sewers,  the  size  of  connector \nsewers was also adjusted to minimize the long-term investment cost. In addition, to maintain the \nflow  of  sewage  by  gravity  without  pumping  in  the  system,  embankment  is  needed  for  many \nportions of the pipelines.  \n \n41. \nAnother major cause of the cost overrun is replacement of the polyethylene lining of the \nanaerobic ponds with concrete lining, and the need to dig dewater trenches at the work site and \n\n\f11 \n\nprovide  grouted  stone  and  clay  lining  for  the  facultative  and  maturation  ponds.  This  change  is \nnecessary because the geotechnical investigation carried out during detailed design revealed a \nvery  high  groundwater  table  throughout  the  project  area,  especially  at  the  treatment  plant  site \n(at  0.4-0.8  meter  in  depth),  and  aside  from  unconsolidated  sandy  soils  at  the  surface  layer \n(down to 1 meter in depth), there are loose silty sands at the treatment plant site. Other factors \ncontributing to the cost overrun include: (i) the unit cost of the comparable pipes had increased \nby more than 50%, (ii) the domestic preference  had resulted in higher cost, and (iii) the winning \nbid has an unexpected high price for general items. \n \nB. \n\nImpact on the Project \n\n42. \nThe  economic,  financial,  environmental,  social,  and  institutional  impacts  of  the  cost \noverrun  have  been  reappraised.  The  objectives,  structure,  and  overall  implementation \narrangements  of  the  approved  Project  remain  unchanged,  despite  the  cost  overrun;  however, \nwithout additional financing, the geographic coverage, hence the number of beneficiaries of the \nProject, will be affected. Without supplementary financing, the approved project will be able to \ncover  water  supply  for  only  four  provincial  towns12  instead  of  six,  and  only  half  of  the  sewage \ncollection and treatment system in Sihanoukville will be constructed and operated.  \n \n43. \nThe  economic  viability  of  each  of  the  subprojects  was  reevaluated  based  on  updated \ninformation  on  benefits  and  construction  costs.  The  reevaluation  indicates  that  despite  the \nincreases in cost, all subprojects remain economically viable. For water supply subprojects, the \ncost increase has been largely offset by the higher value of nonincremental water consumption, \nwhich was significantly undervalued at appraisal. For the wastewater management subproject in \nSihanoukville,  higher  than  expected  tourist  arrivals  in  the  last  few  years  and  recent  economic \ndevelopment  in  the  town  have  significantly  raised  the  economic  benefits  of  the  subproject. \nDetails of the economic analysis are in Appendix 3. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  cost  overrun  on  the  financial  viability  of  the  Project  and  the  financial \n44. \nsustainability of the provincial waterworks depends critically on the ability of the waterworks to \ncollect  adequate  water  tariffs  to  recover  the  increased  cost.  While  water  tariffs  have  to  be \nincreased in all the project towns except Battambang, the proposed water tariffs are affordable \nto  the  targeted  beneficiaries  including  the  low-income  groups.  The  tariffs  are  also  significantly \nlower than those projected for 2004 at appraisal. This is mainly because of lower-than-expected \ndepreciation of the domestic currency (the exchange rate of the domestic currency vis-\u00e0-vis the \ndollar remains unchanged since appraisal). Moreover, for those people who are unconnected to \nthe piped system, the proposed tariffs are much lower than those for alternative sources, such \nas water vendors. In developing the wastewater tariffs for Sihanoukville, the design consultants \nhad  extensive  consultations  with  municipal  and  district  governments,  local  businessmen,  and \nthe general public, and found that while additional investment cost would result in higher tariffs, \nthese  were  still  generally  affordable  to  the  local  enterprises  and  residents,  mainly  due  to  the \neconomic  growth  led  by  tourism  in  the  city.  The  analysis  of  the  affordability  of  the  water  and \nwastewater  tariffs  to  the  communities,  including  low-income  groups,  in  the  project  towns  is \nincluded  in  the  financial  analysis  in  Appendix  4.  Financial  projections  for  the  six  provincial \nwaterworks  are  presented  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C,  and  financial  projections  for  the \nSihanoukville wastewater management system are in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n\n                                                 \n12  Battambang, Pursat, Kompong Thom, and Kompong Cham for a total contract amount of $10,581,721.35. \n \n\n\f12 \n\nAs  the  reappraised  Project  will  retain  the  coverage  and  beneficiary  targets  of  the \n45. \napproved  Project,  the  social  impact  of  the  proposed  supplementary  loan  will  be  limited  to  the \naffordability  and  willingness  to  pay  of  the  targeted  groups.  To  mitigate  the  impact,  MIME  has \nagreed  to  introduce  a  credit  policy  in  the  project  towns  to  allow  the  low-income groups in the \nprovincial towns to pay the connection charge by installment. MPWT has also developed a tariff \nand connection charge scheme that will provide cross-subsidies from industrial and commercial \nusers  to  the  poor.  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy,  prepared  on  the  basis of \nthe social analysis carried out in the feasibility study of the approved Project and findings of the \nreappraisal missions, is attached as Appendix 5. \n \n46. \nIEEs  prepared  for  parts  A,  B,  and  C  under  the  approved  Project  were  reviewed  and \nupdated  during  reappraisal,  based  on  findings  of  the  engineering  design.  The  updated  IEEs \nreconfirmed  that  the  Project  would  have  an  overall  positive  environmental  impact,  that  minor \nadverse  environmental  impacts  during  construction  and  operation  could  be  mitigated  or \neliminated  by  following  international  best  practices,  and  that  no  environmental  impact \nassessment  was  needed.  To  ensure  that  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  mitigated  and \nenvisaged environmental benefits are properly monitored, an environmental management plan \n(EMP)  was  prepared  separately  by  MIME  and  MPWT.  The  EMPs  addressed  the  following \nenvironmental  issues:  (i)  siting  of  subproject  components  and  good  construction  practices  to \nminimize dust, noise, or silt runoff from constructions, and disruption of vehicular and pedestrian \nlocal  resident  safety,  and  adequate  construction  monitoring; \ntraffic;  (ii)  worker  and \n(iii) health/safety  hazards  in  treatment  plant  operations  and  pipeline  maintenance;  and \n(iv) adequate  operation  stage  monitoring.  The  Project provides funds for laboratory equipment \nand \nproject \nexecuting/implementing  agencies  have  appointed  an  officer  responsible  for  environmental \nmonitoring in each project town. The summary IEE (SIEE), prepared under the approved project \nand updated on the basis of the revised IEEs, is presented in Appendix 6. The revised IEEs are \npresented in Supplementary Appendix E, and EMPs in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n \nC. \n\nenvironmental  monitoring.  The \n\nRemedial Steps \n\noperational \n\ntraining \n\nstaff \n\non \n\nof \n\n47. \nBefore  reappraising  the  proposed  supplementary  loan,  alternative  remedial  measures \nwere explored. Financing from other bilateral and multilateral funding sources were sought, but \nit was found that few agencies would be able to provide additional funding within the time frame \nbecause  of  full  commitment  in  their  existing  assistance  programs.  Scaling  down  the  scope  of \nwork for the components that experienced cost overruns to maintain the cost within the budget \nwas also examined. Analyses showed, however, that while this was technically feasible, it would \nresult in a project with a substantially reduced capacity to meet the demand of the communities, \nsustain economic growth in the urban centers, and protect the urban environment. A significant \nproportion  of  the  expected  socioeconomic  and  environmental  benefits  of  the  approved  Project \nwould be lost.  \n \n48. \nFor  the  water  supply  component,  reducing  the  number  of  towns  was  considered  an \nalternative.  However,  since  the  beginning  of  the  feasibility  study,  numerous  socioeconomic \nsurveys,  technical  survey,  public  awareness  campaigns,  and  health  and  sanitation  education \nprograms  have  been  carried  out  in  the  communities  and  have  been  fully  supported  by  the \ncommunities and local governments alike. There is high expectation from all the project towns. It \nwould  be  difficult  to  delete  any  town  from  the  project.  On  the  other  hand,  scaling  down  the \nscope of works in each town would substantially affect the project's socioeconomic objectives, \nincrease the unit cost of water supply, and  impact  negatively  the  financial  sustainability  of  the \nprovincial waterworks.  \n\n\f13 \n\n \n49. \nFor the Sihanoukville wastewater management system, it is technically possible to divide \nthe  sewerage  collection  areas  as  well  as  the  treatment  plant  into  two  half  systems, with the \nProject financing the cost of one part of the divided system. However, the scaling down would \nsignificantly reduce the financial, economic, and environmental benefits. The reduced number of \nconnections would result in higher capital and O&M cost per cubic meter of wastewater treated \nand  would  lead  to  tariffs  significantly  beyond  the  willingness  to  pay  of  the  residents  and \ncommercial  and  industrial  establishments  in  the  project  areas.  This  would  lead,  in  turn,  to \nincreased  risks  of  revenue  collections  and  affect  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  proposed \nSihanoukville wastewater management unit. The financial analysis shows that, if only half of the \nsystem  will  be  constructed  and  operated,  the  average  incremental  financial  cost  of  a  cubic \nmeter of wastewater treated will be 26% higher than if the complete system is constructed and \noperated.  It  also  shows  the  full  cost  recovery  will  be  achieved  only  by  year  2015  instead  of \n2009, and with much lower internal cash generation capacity. Apart from the financial costs, the \nintended environmental benefits would also be seriously eroded.  \n \nD. \n\nRevised Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n50. \nThe  revised  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $34.56  million  equivalent,  comprising \n$23.56  million  in  foreign  exchange,  and  $11.00  million  equivalent  in  local  currency.  The  total \nincrease  is  $8.24  million  equivalent,  comprising  $5.22  million  in  foreign  exchange  and \n$3.02 million equivalent in local currency. It is proposed that ADB provide a supplementary loan \nof  SDR4,546,000  ($6.26  million)  from  its  Special  Funds  resources  to  finance  the  entire \nadditional  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $1.04  million  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The \nGovernment will finance the balance of $1.98 million. The ADB loan will carry a term of 32 years \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  an  interest  rate  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The Borrower will be the Kingdom of Cambodia. Details \nof  the  original  and  revised  cost  estimates  for  the  Project  are  presented  in  Appendix  7.  The \nfinancing plan for the cost overrun is shown in Table 2. \n\n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n\nSource \n\nForeign \nExchange \n \n \n5.22 \nAsian Development Bank \n0.00 \nGovernment \n5.22 \nTotal \n% \n63.40 \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff estimates. \n \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n \n1.04 \n1.98 \n3.02 \n36.60 \n\nTotal \nCosts \n \n6.26 \n1.98 \n8.24 \n100.00 \n\nPercent \n\n \n76.00 \n24.00 \n100.00 \n \n\n51. \nThe  implementation  arrangements  for  the  supplementary  loan  will  be  unchanged  from \nthe  approved  Project.  MIME  will  be  the  EA  for  provincial  towns  water  supply  systems  and \nMPWT  will  be  the  EA  for  the  Sihanoukville  wastewater  management  system.  The  respective \nPMU and PIU in each EA will be responsible for day-to-day project management.  \n \n52. \nThe reappraised project implementation is expected to experience some delays because \nof  the  time  lag  between  the  original  and  the  supplementary  loan.  The  completion  date  of  the \nwater  supply  component  will  be  extended  from  March  2004  to  June  2005,  and  that  of  the \nwastewater  management  system,  from  June  2005  to  December  2005.  Overall  project \nimplementation  is  expected  to  experience  about  6  months  delay.  Consequently,  the  utilization \n\n\f14 \n\nperiod of the original loan, and hence that of the proposed supplementary loan, will be extended \nfrom  31  December  2005  to  30  June  2006.  The  revised  project  implementation  schedule  is \npresented in Appendix 8. \n \nTwo major civil works contracts will be financed under the proposed supplementary loan, \n53. \none for water supply in the remaining two towns, and one for the second half of the wastewater \nmanagement  system  in  Sihanoukville.  Civil  works  for  the  water  supply  systems  in  the  six \nprovincial towns and Sihanoukville wastewater management system have been tendered under \nthe  original  loan  following  ICB  procedures  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for \nProcurement.  However,  the  winning  bidders  were  awarded  civil  works  contracts  for  only  four \ntowns for water supply and half of the wastewater management system in Sihanoukville due to \nfunding  constraints.  As  bidders  for  both  components  have  included  bids  for  the  complete \nsystems,  the  remaining  two  civil  works  contacts  will  be  awarded  directly  to  the  respective \nwinning bidder based on original bids through negotiations, to save time  and reduce cost. ICB \nprocedures will be followed in case such negotiations fail to reach an agreement within 90 days \nfrom the effective date of the Supplementary Loan Agreement. About 33 (13 international and \n20  domestic)  person-months of consulting services  will  be  required  to  supervise  the  extended \nperiod of construction. The services will be financed under the original loan through a contract \nvariation.  \n \nF. \n\nSupplementary Loan Policy Requirements \n\n54. \nSince the 1991 Peace Accord, the Cambodian economy has been rebuilt from the ruins \nof two decades of regional and domestic conflicts. While remarkable progress has been made in \nthe  past  decade,  its  weak  and  underdeveloped  economic  base  still  cannot  provide  adequate \nforeign  exchange  to  meet  the  demand  for  consumption  and  investment.  Nor  can  it  generate \nsufficient  revenues  for  the  Government  to  rebuild  the  essential  economic  infrastructure  in  the \ncountry. Consequently, the country has been experiencing continued deficit in both external and \nfiscal accounts. Its development programs are largely financed by external funding agencies.  \n \n55. \nThe  Government  has  accorded  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  environmental  protection \nhigh  development  priority,  as  reflected  in  SEDP,  1996-2000,  and  SEDP  II,  2001-2005.  The \nplans  recognize  that  developing  water  supply  and  sanitation  contributes  positively  to  poverty \nreduction, and that environmental protection is essential for long-term sustainable development. \nFor  these  reasons,  the  Government  has  reconfirmed  the  priority  of  the  Project  in  its \ndevelopment programs.  \n \nGiven  its  limited  domestic  resources,  the  Government  has  sought  additional  funding \n56. \nfrom  a  number  of  external  sources  to  finance  the  cost  overrun.  Due  to  the  urgency  of  the \nfinancing requirement, it has been difficult for the Government to receive the funding in the time \nframe  required  for  the  Project.  Although  the  Government  has  difficulty  in  providing  funding  for \nthe cost overrun up-front, the Government and the EAs have committed to implement full cost \nrecovery  for  the  investment.  MIME  has  agreed  with  ADB  to  gradually  introduce  the  required \ntariff increase in the six provincial towns to reach full cost recovery by the end of 2006. Similarly, \nMPWT  and  the  municipality  of  Sihanoukville  have  agreed  with  ADB  to  introduce  wastewater \ntariffs in the city to reach full cost recovery by the end of 2009. \n \n\nVI. \n\nBENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION \n\nA. \n\nGeneral \n\n57. \nThe  Project  will  bring  about  positive  socioeconomic  and  environmental  benefits  to  the \neconomy as well as to 350,000 urban residents in the provincial towns. Improved urban services \n\n\f15 \n\nwill  enable  the  provincial  towns  to  attract  investments,  sustain  economic  growth,  better  serve \nthe surrounding rural economy, and contribute to the reduction of rural poverty. Improved water \nsupply and sanitation will benefit the residents directly due to time and cost savings from buying, \nfetching,  treating,  and  storing  water;  improved  public  and  family  hygiene  and  health;  reduced \nmedical  outlays;  and  increased  productive  days.  The  benefit  to  women  and  children  will  be \nsignificant because a safe and convenient water supply and better sanitation will free them from \none of the heavy house chores, and allow women to engage in income-generating activities and \nchildren to attend schools.  The clean environment in Sihanoukville will sustain the tourist boom \nin the city, and create revenues and employment opportunities for the residents of the city.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\n58. \nThe  Project  remains  economically  and  financially  viable  despite  the  cost  overrun.  The \neconomic internal rates of return (EIRRs) for the water supply subprojects range from 14.8% to \n34.6%, higher than the assumed opportunity cost of capital of 12%.  Sensitivity tests assessed \nthe magnitude of the impact  of adverse changes in the key parameters underlying the EIRRs. \nThe results indicate that the EIRRs are robust and are able to withstand adverse changes in the \nparameters.  The  analysis  indicates  that  the  EIRRs  of  the  subprojects  are  most  sensitive  to \ndelays in project implementation (Table 3). \n \n\nTable 3: Results of Economic Analysis \n \n\nAppraisal (%) \n\nReappraisal (%)  \n\nCost + \n10% \n(%) \n\nSensitivity Tests \nBenefit \n\u201310% \n(%) \n\nImplementation \nDelayed by  \n1 Year \n(%) \n13.7 \n\n \n\nTown \n\nBattambang \n\nKampot \n\nKompong Cham  \n\nKompong Thom  \n\nPursat \n\nSvay Rieng \n\nSihanoukville \n\n \n \n\nEIRR (%) \nSI \nSV (%) \nEIRR (%) \nSI \nSV (%) \nEIRR (%) \nSI \nSV (%) \nEIRR (%) \nSI \nSV (%) \nEIRR (%) \nSI \nSV (%) \nEIRR (%) \nSI \nSV (%) \nEIRR (%) \nSI \nSV (%) \n\n15.6 \n\n25.0 \n\n34.6 \n\n16.6 \n\n20.2 \n\n15.9 \n\n22.2 \n\n17.1 \n\n23.9 \n\n22.7 \n\n15.5 \n\n15.4 \n\n14.7 \n\n16.4 \n\n14.8 \n4.2 \n23.7 \n21.2 \n1.8 \n56.1 \n20.0 \n 2.0 \n50.8 \n13.5 \n5.4 \n18.5 \n13.5 \n5.3 \n18.7 \n12.8 \n6.7 \n14.9 \n15.4 \n2.0 \n49.7 \n\n14.5 \n5.2 \n19.2 \n21.0 \n2.8 \n35.9 \n19.8 \n3.0 \n33.7 \n13.3 \n6.3 \n15.8 \n13.3 \n6.3 \n15.8 \n12.6 \n7.7 \n12.9 \n15.2 \n3.0 \n33.2 \n\n18.9 \n\n18.0 \n\n12.7 \n\n12.7 \n\n12.1 \n\n14.2 \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, SI = sensitivity indicator, SV = switching value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff estimates. \n \n59. \nThe  financial  analysis  shows  that  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  for  each \nwater  supply  subproject  ranges  from  3.3%  in  Kampot  to  8.6%  in  Battambang.  While  the \nconstruction is expected to be completed in 2005, a significant increase in the volume of water \nsold  can  be  achieved  starting  from  2003  as  a  result  of  the  leakage  detection  and  monitoring \nprogram. Tariffs will be set at such a level that the average monthly expenditure on water of a \nhousehold  with  a  private  connection  would  be  about  4%  of  the  average  monthly  household \n\n\f16 \n\nincome  in  all  project  towns.  All  households  using  a  public  selling  point  would  spend  less  than \n3%  of  their  average  monthly  household  income  on  water.  With  the  implementation  of  the \nplanned financial measures, all towns will be in a position to sustain the subprojects. Projected \nfinancial statements for the waterworks indicate that all water supply subprojects will achieve full \ncost recovery and all water supply subprojects will generate positive cash flows from operations \nafter project completion. \n \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n60. \nThe  Government  and  the  EAs  have  substantially  complied  with  the  covenants  of  the \napproved  Loan  1725-CAM(SF):  Provincial  Towns  Improvement  Project.  A  summary  of  the \nstatus of compliance with loan covenants is in  Appendix 9. In addition, the Government and the \nEAs  have  given  the  following  assurances,  which  have  been  incorporated  in  the  legal \ndocuments: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nIn  accordance  with  the  schedule  agreed  upon  with  ADB,  MIME  will  annually \nincrease water tariffs in the six provincial towns during 2004-2006 to achieve full \ncost recovery of O&M plus depreciation not later than 31 December 2006. \n \nMIME  will  introduce  payment  by  installment  for  connection  fees  in  the  six \nprovincial  towns  within  6  months  of  effectiveness  of  the  Supplementary  Loan \nAgreement. \n \nThe  municipality  of  Sihanoukville,  or  its  designee,  will  have  the  authority  to \nadminister  the  Sihanoukville  wastewater  management  system  and  collect  fees \nfrom,  among  other  sources,  beneficiaries  of  the  wastewater  system.  The  fees \ncollected will be deposited into an earmarked bank account to be established by \nthe municipality of Sihanoukville, or its designee, and will be used solely for the \nSihanoukville  wastewater  system.  Shortfalls,  if  any,  between  the  fees  collected \nand O&M expenses of the wastewater systems will be met from the budget of the \nmunicipality of Sihanoukville. MPWT and other Government agencies concerned \nwill review, after 2 years operation of the system, the feasibility of establishing a \nstate-owned  autonomous  enterprise  to  manage  the  wastewater  management \nsystem. \n \n\n(v) \n\n(iv)  MPWT and the municipality of Sihanoukville will approve the wastewater tariffs, \nas  agreed  upon  with  ADB,  before  31  December  2004,  and  implemented  the \ntariffs  upon  commissioning  of  the  wastewater  management  system.  The  tariffs \nwill  be  increased  over  2006-2009  to  achieve  recovery  of  O&M  cost  and  capital \ndepreciation before 31 December 2009. \n \nMPWT  and  the  municipality  of  Sihanoukville  will  implement  a  connection  fee \nschedule  to  be  agreed  upon  with  ADB,  which  will  provide  cross-subsidies from \nindustrial and commercial beneficiaries to the low-income households. \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  and  MPWT  will  implement  the \nresettlement  plan  as  approved  by  ADB  and  ensure  that  all  Project-affected \npersons will be duly compensated in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary \nresettlement. \n \n\n(vi) \n\n\f17 \n\n(vii)  MIME  and  MPWT  will  ensure  that  the  contractors  will  follow  the  respective \n\nenvironmental management plans as agreed upon with ADB.  \n \n\n(viii)  MPWT  will  ensure  that  an  officer  in  the  municipality  of  Sihanoukville,  or  its \ndesignee,  will  have  an  explicit  responsibility  for  environmental  monitoring  and \nmanagement. \n\n \n\nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n\n61. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  supplementary  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement  of  ADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies \nequivalent to Special Drawing Rights 4,546,000 to the Kingdom of Cambodia for  the Provincial \nTowns Improvement Project from ADB's Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the \nrate  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;

The  methodology  adopted  in  the \nreevaluation  was  essentially  the  same  as  that  used  at  appraisal  and  has  followed the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank's  (ADB)  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects  (1997)  and \nGuidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Water  Supply  Projects  (1998). The  subprojects  are \nevaluated over a period of 25 years with no salvage value assumed thereafter. \n \nThe  capital  costs  and  incremental  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  of  each \n2. \nsubproject  were  considered.  Economic  costs  were  derived  from  the  financial  project costs. All \ncosts are expressed in constant (2003) prices, and taxes and duties have been deducted from \nbase costs. Economic costs were valued using the domestic price numeraire, but expressed in \ndollars.  Tradable  components  have  been  adjusted  to  economic  prices  using  a  shadow \nexchange  rate  factor  (SERF)1  and  nontradable  components  are  valued  at  domestic  market \nprices.  A  shadow  wage  rate  factor  (SWRF)  for  unskilled  labor  was  used  to  reflect opportunity \ncosts in the context of wide availability of unskilled labor in Cambodia.2 \n\nB. \n\nWater Supply \n\n3. \nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  approximately  270,000  people  in  six  provincial  towns, \nnamely: Battambang, Kampot, Kompong Cham, Kompong Thom, Pursat, and Svay Rieng. The \nappraisal  report  showed  that  all  households  including  those  with  piped  connections  in  the  six \ntowns used a variety of sources of water throughout the year because of limited supply from the \nexisting  systems.  The  construction  of  the  Project  will  remove  the  water  supply  limitations  and \nenable  more  households  to  be  connected  with  reliable  and  stable  piped  water  supply. \nQuantifiable  economic  benefits  from  improved  water  supply  include  nonincremental  water \nconsumption,  valued  at  the  current  average  price  of  water  supply  from  nonpiped  sources \nranging  from  KR1,400  per  cubic  meter  (m3)  to  KR2,500  per  m3;  and  incremental  water \nconsumption, valued at the average demand price ranging from KR1,200 per m3 to KR1,850 per \nm3.  The  volume  of  nonincremental  water  consumption  and  incremental  water  consumption  for \neach  subproject  was  estimated  based  on  household  surveys  and  the  population  that  the \nsubproject is going to serve.  \n \n4. \nResource cost  savings  are  also  expected  from  the  Project.  The  socioeconomic  survey \nshowed  that  all  households  in  the  six  towns,  including  those  with  piped  connections,  were \nequipped with water storage facilities such as water tanks and jars to respond to the unstable \nand irregular water supply, and nearly a quarter of the households without piped connection had \nto spend 1\u20135 hours weekly to fetch water from sources other than a piped system. The reliable \nand stable water supply service provided by the Project will enable the households to get rid of \nthe  water  storage  facility  and  stop  spending  time  in  fetching  water.  The  cost  savings  on  the \nwater  storage  facility  and  time  savings,  estimated  from  the  household  survey,  range  from \nKR1,100 to KR5,000  and from KR2,200 to KR5,500 per person per year, respectively.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1   The SERF is estimated at 1.11. \n2   The SWRF is estimated at 0.75. \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nThe  results  of  the  economic  analysis  for  water  supply  subprojects  are  summarized  in \n5. \nTable  A3.1.  The  reevaluated  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  range  from  14.7%  to \n23.9%. Sensitivity analyses have been undertaken to test the robustness of the analysis and the \nconsequences of changes in the following variables: (i) 10% increase in the project cost, (ii) 10% \ndecrease in project benefits, and (iii) 1\u2013year delay of project benefits. The results show that the \nEIRRs are most sensitive to delays in project benefits. However, all EIRRs remain over 12% in \nthe  worst  possible  scenario  tested,  indicating  the  economic  viability  of  the  subprojects.  The \nswitching values range from 14.9% to 56.1% in the case of cost increase and 12.9% to 35.9% in \nthe case of benefit reduction.  \n \n\nTable A3.1: Economic Analysis of Water Supply Subprojects \n \n\n \n\nEIRR (%) \n\nAppraisal \n\nReappraisal \n\nCost + \n10% \n(%) \n\nSensitivity Tests \nBenefit \n\u201310% \n(%) \n\nImplementation \nDelayed by  \n1 Year(%) \n\nTown \n\nBattambang \n\nKampot \n\nKompong Cham  \n\nKompong Thom  \n\nPursat \n\nSvay Rieng \n\nEIRR (%) \nSI \nSV (%) \nEIRR (%) \nSI \nSV (%) \nEIRR (%) \nSI \nSV (%) \nEIRR (%) \nSI \nSV (%) \nEIRR (%) \nSI \nSV (%) \nEIRR (%) \nSI \nSV (%) \n\n15.6 \n\n25.0 \n\n34.6 \n\n16.6 \n\n20.2 \n\n15.9 \n\n17.1 \n\n23.9 \n\n22.7 \n\n15.5 \n\n15.4 \n\n14.7 \n\n14.8 \n4.2 \n23.7 \n21.2 \n1.8 \n56.1 \n20.0 \n 2.0 \n50.8 \n13.5 \n5.4 \n18.5 \n13.5 \n5.3 \n18.7 \n12.8 \n6.7 \n14.9 \n\n14.5 \n5.2 \n19.2 \n21.0 \n2.8 \n35.9 \n19.8 \n3.0 \n33.7 \n13.3 \n6.3 \n15.8 \n13.3 \n6.3 \n15.8 \n12.6 \n7.7 \n12.9 \n\n13.7 \n\n18.9 \n\n18.0 \n\n12.7 \n\n12.7 \n\n12.1 \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, SI = sensitivity indicator, SV = switching value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff estimates. \n\nC. \n\nSihanoukville Sewerage  \n\n6. \nSihanoukville, located on the Gulf of Thailand, is a recognized tourism center with many \nnatural  advantages, particularly  four  beautiful beaches and  one  attractive  island. The coastal \ncity  has  been  enjoying  dramatic  tourist  growth  in  the  past  5  years,  with  an  average  annual \ngrowth  rate  of  more  than  35%  (70%  for  international  tourists).  With  approximately  120,000 \ntourist  arrivals  in  2002,  including  20,000  international  tourist  arrivals,  and  about  1,300  hotel \nrooms,  Sihanoukville  has  become  a  leading  coastal  resort  that  attracts  tourists  traveling  from \nViet  Nam,  Thailand,  and  Singapore.  While  the  booming  tourism  has  brought  growth  and \nemployment to the city, it has also produced an increasing amount of wastewater that has been \ndischarged into the open sea close to the beaches, polluting the very resources that have been \nthe  tourist  attractions  of  the  city,  and  posing  health  hazards  to  the  recreational  users  of  the \nbeaches. The problem will become more acute in the near future with increasing tourist arrivals \nand the completion of an urban water supply project in 2005.  \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  a  reticulated  sewerage  system  in  the  central  area  and  major \n7. \ntourist  destinations  of  Sihanoukville  and  a  treatment  plant  that  uses  the  stabilization  ponds \nprocess.  This  treatment  process  was  considered  the  least-cost  solution,  both  at  appraisal and \nreappraisal,  compared  with  other  wastewater  treatment  technologies.  It  is  suitable  for \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n23 \n\nSihanoukville where land cost is low and skilled technicians are rare. It has the advantage of low \ncapital  and  O&M  cost,  relatively  high  biological  oxygen  demand  conversion,  and  minimum \noperational  skills  required.  The  treatment  plant  is  located  on  vacant  land  far  from  the  town \ncenter and residential areas; therefore, the environmental impact of bad odors from the ponds is \nnegligible.  Because  power  supply  is  expensive  and  unreliable  in  Cambodia,  the  sewage \ncollection, reticulation, and transmission will be gravity-fed with no pumping to minimize energy \nconsumption in operating the system. \n \nThe major economic benefits expected  from the subproject are tourism benefits arising \n8. \nfrom (i) increased number of tourists visiting  Sihanoukville, and (ii) increased daily spending by \ntourists.  The  analysis  considers  mainly the  benefits from foreign tourists,  as  net  spending  by \nlocal tourists is marginal compared with that of foreign tourists.  \n \n9. \nThe tourism benefits attributable to the subproject are the increased net expenditure of \nforeign  tourists  and  its  multiplier  effects  on  the  country\u2019s  economy,  which  are  induced  by  the \nproject and retained by the country.  The net  expenditure of tourists,  estimated  at  30% of their \ngross expenditure, is the difference between the  tourists\u2019 gross expenditure on tourism services \nand  the  costs  of  providing  such  services.  The  analysis  takes  50%  of  the  project-induced \nincremental net expenditure of tourists as the benefits arising directly from the subproject and a \nfactor of 0.9 is used to adjust this net expenditure to the benefits of the country after considering \nthe leakage and multiplier effects of tourism benefits in the Mekong region.3 \n \n10. \nThe without-project scenario assumes wastewater will continue to flow untreated to the \nsea. The tourist\u2019s interest to visit Sihanoukville will be impaired by the increasing pollution of the \nbeaches  which  are  the  main  tourist  attractions.  This  scenario  assumes  tourist  growth  will \ngradually slow down from the current 35% to 8% in 2024, and the average tourist stay will be \nreduced by half a day. The with-project scenario assumes that tourist growth will slow down but \nat a more gradual rate, the average tourist stay will remain at 3.5 days, and tourist spending will \nincrease slightly by $1.5 per day to accommodate the wastewater treatment charges to hotels \nand restaurants which will be passed on to the tourists, who will be more willing to consume due \nto  less  health  concerns.  These  assumptions  are  considered  conservative,  as  tourist  arrivals \neven  in  the  with-project  scenario  equal  only  about  80%  of  the  Government\u2019s projection  for \ntourist arrivals in Sihanoukville.4 The assumptions made for calculating the tourism benefits are \nsummarized in Table A3.2. \n \n\nTable A3.2: Assumptions in Calculating Tourism Benefits  \n\nTourists \nin 2002 \n20,000 \n\n \n\nWithout \nProject  \n\nWith \nProject \n\nAnnual Tourist Growth Rate (%) \nTourist Stay (days) \nTourist Spending ($/day) \nAnnual Tourist Growth Rate (%) \nTourist Stay  (days) \nTourist Spending ($/day) \n\n2003-\n2005 \n35 \n3.5 \n75 \nn.a. \nn.a. \nn.a. \n\n2006-\n2009 \n16 \n3.0 \n75 \n20 \n3.5 \n76.5 \n\n2010-\n2012 \n12 \n3.0 \n75 \n15 \n3.5 \n76.5 \n\n2013-\n2016 \n10 \n3.0 \n75 \n12 \n3.5 \n76.5 \n\n2017-2025 \n\n8 \n3.0 \n75 \n10 \n3.5 \n76.5 \n\nn.a. = not applicable; 2003\u20132005 are Project implementation period. \nSource:  Master  Plan  for  Tourism  Development  in  the  Coastal  Zone  (2002)  and  Asian  Development  Bank  staff \nestimates. \n \n\n                                                 \n3   The major assumptions and estimations in this economic analysis are made based mainly on the Mekong Lancang \nRiver Tourism Planning Study, which was completed in 1998 with ADB\u2019s support and other previous studies done \nby ADB and Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) in the tourism sector. \n\n4   Master Plan for Tourism Development in the Coastal Zone (2002). \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nThe subproject will also generate health benefits for local residents and domestic tourists \n11. \nvisiting  Sihanoukville  as  well  as  environmental  benefits  such  as  the  preservation  and \nconservation  of  species.  However,  these  benefits  are  not  included  in  the  analysis  due  to \ndifficulties in valuation and lack of data.   \n\nThe economic analysis for the subproject is summarized in Table A3.3.

Financial  internal  rates  of  return \n(FIRRs) were calculated and sensitivity analyses were carried out. Financial projections for the \nwaterworks  and  the  wastewater  management  system  are  included  in  the  supplementary \nappendixes. The analyses used May 2003 constant prices. \n \nB. \n\nFinancial Viability of Water Supply Subprojects \n\n2. \nAll  capital  cost  estimates  are  based  on  the  winning  bid  price.  Financial  projections  of \noperating entities are made in local prices, and an annual escalation factor of 3.5% per annum \nwas applied to the estimates. The unaccounted-for water is to be reduced from the current 55% \nof water produced to 30% by 2006. Among the project towns, the average water tariff in 2006 \nwill vary from KR1,210 to KR1,544 per cubic meter (m3) (in constant May 2003 prices). \n \n3. \nOperation and maintenance (O&M) expenditures include personnel, energy, chemicals, \nrepair  and  maintenance,  administration,  miscellaneous,  and  depreciation  expenses.  The \nnumber  of  personnel  varies  between  4  and  8  employees  per  1,000  connections,  which  is \nconsidered  reasonable.  The  average  monthly  personnel  cost  ranges  from  KR70,000  to \nKR200,000  based  on  each  project  town\u2019s  existing  level.  Energy  consumption  varies  between \nKR150 to KR335 per cubic meter (m3) of treated water, depending on the distance and type of \nwater sources. Chemical cost varies from KR20 to KR80 per m3 of treated water, depending on \nthe  type  and  quality  of  water  sources.  Repairs  and  maintenance  are  estimated  at  2%  of  the \ninvestment  costs.  Administration  costs  are  estimated  at  5%  of  operating  revenues,  while \nmiscellaneous  expenses  are  estimated  at  5%  of  the  combined  cash  operating  costs. \nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis using 4% of the historical cost of depreciable \nfixed assets used in operations. \n \nFor  financial  viability  analysis,  FIRR,  which  is  the  discount  rate  that  equalizes  the \n4. \npresent  values  of  costs  and  revenues  over  the  project  life,  was  calculated.  The  analysis \nconsidered incremental capital and operational costs, as well as incremental income. While the \nconstruction is expected to be completed in 2005, a significant increase in the volume of water \nsold  can  be  achieved  starting  from  2003  as  a  result  of  the  leakage  detection and monitoring \nprogram. Tariffs were set such that the average monthly expenditure on water of a household \nwith  a  pipe  connection  would  be  about  4%  of  the  average  monthly  household  income  in  all \nproject  towns.  All  households  using  a  public  selling  point  would  spend  less  than  3%  of  their \naverage  monthly  household  income  on  water.  The  FIRRs  are  more  sensitive  to  a  change  in \nrevenue than to changes in O&M cost. The FIRRs with the associated sensitivity tests are given \nin Table A4.1. With the implementation of the planned financial measures, all towns will be in a \nposition  to  sustain  the  subprojects.  Projected  financial  statements  for  the  waterworks  indicate \nthat all water supply subprojects will achieve full cost recovery and, after project completion, will \ngenerate positive cash flows from operations. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nTable A4.1: Financial Evaluation and Sensitivity Analyses of Water Supply Subprojects \n \nCapital Cost \n\nFIRR, SI \nand SV \n\nBase \nCase \n\n+ 10% \n\nO&M Cost \n+ 10% \n\nBenefits \n\u201310% \n\nTown \n\n \n\n \n\nAll Towns Combined  FIRR (%) \n \n \nBattambang \n \n \nKampot \n \n \nKompong Cham  \n \n \nKompong Thom  \n \n \nPursat \n \n \nSvay Rieng \n \n \n \n\nSI \nSV (%) \nFIRR (%) \nSI \nSV (%) \nFIRR (%) \nSI \nSV (%) \nFIRR (%) \nSI \nSV (%) \nFIRR (%) \nSI \nSV (%) \nFIRR (%) \nSI \nSV (%) \nFIRR (%) \nSI \nSV (%) \n \n\n \n\n6.7 \n \n \n8.6 \n \n \n3.3 \n \n \n7.8 \n \n \n7.9 \n \n \n5.8 \n \n \n6.0 \n \n \n\n \n5.8 \n0.8 \n131.4 \n7.5 \n1.8 \n54.9 \n2.5 \n(11.8) \n(8.5) \n7.0 \n1.6 \n62.4 \n7.1 \n1.7 \n60.2 \n5.0 \n4.0 \n24.9 \n5.3 \n3.5 \n28.9 \n \n\n \n6.1 \n1.1 \n88.1 \n7.7 \n2.2 \n46.2 \n2.6 \n(8.5) \n(11.7) \n7.4 \n1.2 \n82.2 \n7.3 \n1.6 \n64.1 \n5.1 \n4.2 \n23.7 \n5.6 \n2.4 \n41.6 \n \n\nBenefits \nDelayed \nby 1 Year \n\n \n\n5.4 \n \n \n6.7 \n \n \n2.3 \n \n \n6.6 \n \n \n6.5 \n \n \n4.5 \n \n \n4.9 \n \n \n\n \n5.1 \n2.9 \n(34.5) \n6.4 \n5.0 \n(20.1) \n1.8 \n(19.3) \n5.2 \n6.5 \n3.8 \n(26.2) \n6.4 \n4.2 \n(23.7) \n4.1 \n9.2 \n(10.8) \n4.7 \n6.9 \n(14.6) \n \n\n \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return, O&M = operation and maintenance, SI = sensitivity indicator, SV = switching \nvalue. \nSource: Staff consultant estimates. \n \n\n \n\nC. \n\nWater Tariff Structure and Affordability to Households \n\nThe  Government  has  agreed  that  costs  related  to  water  supplies  will  be  recovered \n5. \nthrough direct user charges, which will be set at a level affordable to the poorer sections of the \ncommunity.  The  current  and  proposed  water  tariffs  in  the  six  towns  are  shown  in  Table  A4.2. \nThe  water  tariffs  in  2006  range  from  KR1,210  to  KR1,544  per  m3  of  water  consumed,  in \nconstant 2003 prices. \n \n\nTable A4.2: Current and Proposed Water Tariffs  \n(KR/m3) \n\n \n\nTown \n\nHousehold Connection \n\n2006 Tariff \n\nCurrent \nTariff \n\nConstant \n2003 Prices \n\n \n\n \n\nCurrent \nTariff \n\nPublic Selling Point \n\n2006 Tariff \n\nCurrent \nPrices \n1,512 \n1,670 \n1,318 \n1,673 \n1,521 \n1,682 \n\n1,400 \n1,200 \n550 \n1,000 \n800 \n900 \n\n1,388 \n1,533 \n1,210 \n1,536 \n1,396 \n1,544 \n\nBattambang \nKampot \nKompong Cham  \nKompong Thom  \nPursat \nSvay Rieng \n?  = not availa ble \nSource: Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Energy and staff consultant estimates. \n \n6. \nThe socioeconomic survey results indicated that (i) most households in the target areas \nplace water supply as their top priority, with sewerage/sanitation always in the top three; and (ii) \nhouseholds are willing to pay a market rate for water.

These areas are vital to \npreserve and revitalize the town's tourism industry. Based on the present value of the winning \nbid  price  for  capital  works,  the  estimated  O&M  costs,  and  incremental  sewage  generated,  the \naverage incremental financial cost (AIFC) was calculated to determine the tariff required for full \ncost  recovery  over  the  expected  life  of  the  project  assets.  If  only  half  of  the  system  will be \nconstructed  and  operated  due  to  nonavailability  of  supplementary  financing,  the  AIFC  was \ncalculated  at  $1.06  per  m3  of  wastewater  treated.  Under  the  complete  system,  the  AIFC  was \ncalculated at $0.84 per m3 of wastewater treated. \n \n8. \nThe proposed tariff to be applied to households, however, will be less than the AIFC on \naccount  of  cross-subsidies  from  high-volume  water  consumers  (brewery,  hotels,  restaurants, \netc.). The proposed wastewater tariff for these high-volume water consumers will be less than \nthe  cost  of  on-site  treatment.  To  recover  fully  the  O&M  and  depreciation  costs  by  year  2009 \nunder  the  complete  system,  the  household  charges  in  2009  are  estimated  to  be  KR3,674  per \nmonth  (1%  of  average  monthly  income  for  low-income  households)  and  KR8,053  per month \n(1.5% of average monthly income for middle-income households), in constant May 2003 prices. \nThe  proposed  tariff  will  therefore  be  affordable  to  the  users.  The  household  survey  found  that \n78% of the households interviewed were willing to pay an average of KR145,340 for a sewerage \nconnection.  \n \nThe  projected  financial  statements  under  the  complete  system  indicate  that  the \n9. \nproposed  tariff  will  fully  cover  O&M  and  depreciation  costs  by  2009  and  will  generate  positive \ncash flows from operations to enable the operating entity to expand its collection network using \nits internally generated funds. The projected financial statements indicate that, if only half of the \nsystem will be constructed and operated, full cost recovery will be achieved only by year  2015 \nand internal cash generation capacity is much lower. \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nE. \n\nSubsidies and Cost Recovery \n\n10. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  on  full  cost  recovery  basis  without  Government \nsubsidies. Water tariffs in the six provincial towns will be gradually increased over 2004-2006. \nBy the end of 2006, the tariffs in all the six provincial towns will be sufficient to cover O&M plus \ndepreciation. Similarly, wastewater tariffs in Sihanoukville will be increased over 2006-2009. By \nthe  end  of  2009,  the  wastewater  tariffs  in  Sihanoukville  will  be  sufficient  to  cover  O&M  plus \ndepreciation for the wastewater management system.  \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n29 \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nSector identified as a National Priority in \nCountry Poverty Analysis?   \n\n \nYes \n\n \nSector  identified  as  a  National  Priority  in \nCountry Poverty Partnership Agreement?   \n\n \nYes \n\n \n\n \n\nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Cambodia:  \nSafe and convenient water supply and improved sanitation will help reduce poverty through the time and cost savings \nfrom purchasing, fetching, treating, and storing water; improved public and family hygiene and health; reduced medical \noutlays; and increased productive days for adults and school attendance for children. \n\nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis   \n\nProposed Classification \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nThere are three sources of information for the Project's social and poverty assessment: (i) official documents including: \nNational  Socioeconomic  Surveys  conducted  in  1997  and  1999,  and  Cambodia  Statistical  Yearbook  2001;  (ii) \nhousehold socioeconomic surveys in the project areas carried out during feasibility study and appraisal; and (iii) ADB's \nParticipatory Poverty Assessment: Cambodia.  \nWhile income and expenditures are also surveyed in the field, it has been found that these are unreliable. Therefore \nfield poverty assessment focuses more on the hardships associated with accessing safe water supply and sanitation, \nquality and quantity of water consumed, number of household members earning income, house ownership, willingness \nto pay for improved services, etc. \n\nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\nStakeholder Analysis                                                                                                                             Yes \nMajor stakeholders are (i) residents in the communities in the provincial towns facing shortage of safe water supply \nand inadequate sanitation facilities; (ii) small enterprises and household businesses; (iii) provincial governments; (iv) \nprovincial  waterworks;  (v)  Ministry  of  Industry,  Mines,  and  Energy;  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport;  and  the \nMinistry  of  Economy  and  Finance;  (vi)  international  and  local  nongovernment  organizations;  (vii)  external  funding \nagencies. \n \nThe project feasibility study had extensive consultations with the communities and its members (including women) with \nregard  to  their  needs  and  priorities,  willingness  to  pay  for  improved  services,  and  participation  in  sanitation \nimprovement.  For  the  Sihanoukville  wastewater  management  project,  the  design  team  consulted  not  only  the \ncommunities, but also small and large enterprises with regard to wastewater tariffs, discharge standards, and cost of \nconnections. The design team and the local government also prepared and carried out public awareness campaigns \non  the  need  for  cost  recovery.  Groups  (iii),  (iv),  and  (v)  have  also  been  fully  involved  in  the  design  of  project \nimplementation arrangements and financing arrangements. Consultations with group (vi) have helped with the design \nof  the  community  sanitation  and  health  awareness  programs,  and  their  participation  was  expected  in  the  program\u2019s \nimplementation.  During  the  design  of  the  Project,  due  consultation  was  carried  out  with  other  external  funding \nagencies in terms of policy coordination and sector cooperation. \n\nParticipation Strategy                                                                                                                             Yes \nA  participatory  process  was  followed  in  preparing  the  Project,  and  the  resultant  Project  was  designed  with  the \nparticipation of the stakeholders concerned.

Environmental  improvement  and  protection  are \nmajor project objectives. The Project is classified as environment category B, as per the Asian \nDevelopment Bank's (ADB\u2019s) Guidelines for Environmental Assessment of Project Impacts.  As \ninitial  environmental \nan \nexaminations  (IEEs)  were  carried  out  following  ADB's  guidelines.  The  IEEs  are  based  on  an \nanalysis  of  the  impacts  of  the  proposed  works,  the  socioeconomic  survey  conducted  during \nproject preparation, and a visual assessment of the project towns. The IEEs analyzed the likely \nenvironmental consequences and impacts of implementing water supply, wastewater treatment, \nand  sanitation  improvements  in  the  project  towns.  The  IEEs  are  reviewed  and  updated  during \nreappraisal of the Project, based on information collected in the course of engineering design. \nThis summary is based on the updated IEEs of the Project. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nand sewage treatment. A detailed description of the Project is given in the main text. \n \nC. \n \n \n \n3. \nThe  project  towns  are  widely  scattered.  Most  are  within  the  Mekong  River catchment \narea, while Kampot and Sihanoukville are on the coast. All towns experience a pronounced wet \nand dry season.  \n \n \n \n4. \nThere  are  no  known  endangered  varieties  of  flora,  or  species  of  fish  or  fauna  in  the \nimmediate  project  areas.  The  project  components  are  in  urban  areas  that  are  surrounded  by \nrural areas dominated by rice fields and forests. \n\nThe  Project  consists  of  a  package  of  components  that  cover  water  supply,  sanitation, \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\nDescription of the Project \n\nPhysical Resources \n\nEcology \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n \n3. \n\nHuman and Economic Development \n\n \n \nThe  project  towns  are  comparatively  underdeveloped. Town centers are characterized \n5. \nby continuous rows of one or two story buildings with some form of commercial activity taking \nplace in most properties along the main streets. Water supply systems exist in most centers, but \nthe extent of coverage is poor. Gross evidence of fecal matter and sewage is observed in storm-\nwater drains, which overflow during the wet season, spilling sewage into the streets and around \nhouses. Many roadside drains are filled with stagnant, black, putrid water, and choked with solid \nwaste. Foul odors from pit latrines and drains are common. \n \n \n \n6. \nSome  project  towns  include  sites  of  historic  and  cultural  importance  such  as  temples, \nand  residential,  commercial,  or  administrative  buildings  from  the  colonial  era.  Project \nimplementation will not negatively affect these sites.  \n \n \n \n\nItems of Archaeological Significance \n\n4. \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n5. \n\nQuality of Life \n\n \n \n7. \nThe  project  towns  are  semirural  in  character,  with  relatively  low  population  densities. \nThey  do  not  exhibit  many  of  the  social  problems  associated  with  high-density  urban  areas. \nAlthough  average  incomes  are  very  low,  they  are  increasing  and  income  disparity  within  the \ntowns is relatively low for most of the population. The Government still employs large numbers \nof people, but the private sector is offering increasing employment opportunities. Improvements \nare being made to housing conditions as some progress is made on housing ownership. Urban \nservices, however, are basic and coverage is low. Employment and basic needs are important \nto  most  people  in  the  towns,  who  are  striving  and  working  for  improved  standards  of  living. \nRecreation and leisure activities are not a major concern of the communities in general. \n \nD. \n \n\nForecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n1. \n\nWater Supply Improvements \n\n \n\na. \n\nProject Location \n\n \n8. \nWorks  involve  mostly  (i)  upgrading  the  treatment  plants,  pumping  stations,  and \nreticulation systems; and (ii) expanding reticulation systems to urban areas not currently served \nwith water. However, new treatment plants will be built in Battambang and Kampong Thom, and \nnew  water  intakes  in  Battambang  and  Pursat.  Two  pieces  of  land  are  required,  one  for \nconstructing  the  new  water  intake  in  Pursat,  and  one  for  a  new  treatment  plant  in  Kampong \nThom. A short resettlement plan has been prepared and implemented. \n \n\nb. \n\nDesign Aspects \n\n \n9. \nWater  supply  improvements  are  designed  to  ultimately  provide  a  24-hour  supply  of \ntreated water to a vastly enlarged section of the urban population in six provincial towns. At the \nsame  time,  the  works  will  substantially  reduce  the  volume  of  unaccounted-for water. Chlorine \nwill be used in the systems for disinfection.  \n \n\nc. \n\nConstruction Stage  \n\n \n10. \nNo unusual or significant environmental problems are anticipated during the construction \nof  this  component.  Work  will  be  undertaken  primarily  in  the  dry  season,  but  restored  trenches \nwill  need  to  be  monitored  in  the  wet  season.  Exc avation  for  pipelines  will  disrupt  traffic,  but \ndisruption will be confined to short periods at any given location. \n \n\nd. \n\nOperations Stage  \n\n \n11. \nRegular  training  and  maintenance  are  necessary  to  achieve  full  environmental  benefit \nfrom  the  water  supply  component.  Full  benefits  will  only  be  achieved  if  the  system  operates \nunder  pressure  for  24  hours  a  day,  and  adequate  testing  is  done  at  the  treatment  plants  and \nthroughout  the  distribution  system.  Training  of  operators  and  new  testing  equipment  will  be \nprovided in the Project.  \n \n\ne. \n\nCritical Overall Environmental Review \n\n \n12.  Works  proposed  are  essential  for  enhancing  the  quality  and  the  quantity  of  supplied \nwater  in  the  six  towns.  Adverse  environmental  impacts  can  be  eliminated  through  design \nprovisions although increased water use over the long term will mean increases in wastewater, \nwhich will need to be taken care of in the future. To ensure that adverse environmental impacts \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n33 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nare mitigated during the construction stage, and envisaged environmental benefits are properly \nmonitored, an environmental management plan (EMP) is prepared. \n \n\n2. \n\nSihanoukville Wastewater Management System \n\na. \n\nProject Location \n\n \n13.  Works involve construction of house connections, reticulation pipelines, and a treatment \nplant  to  provide  a  sewerage  scheme  to  serve  the  central  area  of  Sihanoukville.  No  land  is \nrequired for the works in the town except that for the site of the treatment plant. The chosen site \nis Government-owned land, under the control of the municipality. The Project needs to procure \nright-of-way  for  laying  sewers  under  some  private  property.  A  short  resettlement  plan  is \nprepared. \n \n\nb. \n\nDesign Aspects \n\n \n14. \nThe sewerage system is designed for a time horizon up to 2015 and can be upgraded at \nthat  time.  The  system  will  eliminate  gross  evidence  of  fecal  matter  and  sewage  in  the  open \nstorm-water  drains,  foul  odors  from  pit  latrines  and  drains,  and  pollution  of  low-lying  land  and \nbeach frontages. The treatment plant is designed to effectively treat the sewage to a standard \nlevel such that beaches are suitable for primary and secondary contact.  \n \n\nc. \n\nConstruction Stage  \n\n \n15. \nNo  unusual  or  significant  environmental  problems  are  anticipated  during  construction. \nWork  will  be  undertaken  primarily  in  the  dry  season,  but  restored  trenches  will  need  to  be \nmonitored in the wet season. Excavation for sewers will cause some traffic disruption. \n \n\nd. \n\nOperation Stage  \n\n \nGases  in  sewers  are  a  potential  problem,  but  they  will  largely  be  controlled  as  the \n16. \nmunicipality  adopts  proper  regulations  and  monitoring.  Operators  and  officials  will  be  trained \nunder  the  Project.  The  Cambreu  Brewery's  wastewater  will  be  pretreated  before  being \ndischarged into the system.  \n \n\ne. \n\nCritical Overall Environmental Review \n\n \n17. \nThe sewerage scheme will significantly reduce the environmental damage currently seen \nin  storm-water  channels,  in  streams,  and  along  the  coast.  The  proposed  plant  is  a  low-\ntechnology system with low operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, but capable of producing \nhigh-quality  effluent.  To  ensure  that  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  mitigated  during  the \nconstruction  stage,  and  envisaged  environmental  benefits  are  properly  monitored,  an  EMP  is \nprepared. \n \n\n3. \n\nCommunity Sanitation and Health Awareness Program \n\na. \n\nProject Location \n\n \n18. \nalternative sanitary delivery systems in project towns. \n \n\nb. \n\nDesign Aspects \n\nThis  community-based  program  will  develop  and  strengthen  complementary  and/or \n\n \n19. \nDesign of the sanitation improvement scheme in each community will be decided upon \nwith the direct involvement of the communities and with guidance from the project consultants. \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nCommunity ownership will be enhanced through community in-kind contributions to capital cost \nfor the selected schemes and O&M cost. Health education and community development will be \nprovided.  \n \n\nc. \n\nConstruction Stage  \n\nNo unusual or significant environmental problems are anticipated during the construction \n\n \n20. \nof this component.  \n \n\nd. \n\nOperation Stage  \n\n \n21. \nprogram, will take full responsibility for O&M.  \n \n\nThe communities, through their community sanitation committees to be formed under the \n\ne. \n\nCritical Overall Environmental Review \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n\nThe  program  will  significantly  reduce  environmental  damage  caused  by  inappropriate \n\n \n22. \ndisposal of human waste in the project towns. \n \nE. \n \n23. \nThe  project  management  units  in  the  Ministry  of  Industry,  Mines,  and  Energy  and \nMinistry of Public Works and Transport will ensure monitoring of environmental impacts during \nthe  construction  stage  of  the  Project.  The  provincial  water  works  in  the  six  towns  and  the \nwastewater  management  system  to  be  established  in  Sihanoukville  will  monitor  environmental \nimpacts  during  the  operational  stage  of  the  Project.  The  Project  will  support  upgrading  of  the \nwater  testing  laboratories  in  Battambang,  Kampot,  Kompong  Cham,  Kompong  Thom,  Pursat, \nand  Svay  Rieng,  and  incorporation  of  a  small  testing  facility  at  the  Sihanoukville  wastewater \ntreatment  plant.  The  Project  encourages  the  formation  of  community  sanitation  committees  to \nsupervise, contract, manage, and carry out the low-cost sanitation program. \n \nF. \n \n24. \nThe  Project  is  designed  to  improve  and  sustain  the  urban  environment  in  the  project \ntowns. Within the scope of the project components it will help these urban areas cope with the \ndevelopment and population pressures that will arise as urbanization increases.  \n \nG. \n \n25. \nThe  Project  will  have  no  significant  adverse  environmental  impact,  but  will  result  in \noverall  and  numerous  environmental  improvements.  An  environmental  impact  assessment  is \nnot considered necessary.  \n \n \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\nConclusion \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n35 \n\nDETAILED PROJECT COST ESTIMATES  \n(in $ million) \n \n\nTotal \nCost \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nLocal \n\nForeign \n\nForeign \n\n0.17\n0.00\n0.00\n\n0.04 \n0.23 \n0.90 \n\n0.02 \n0.00 \n0.19 \n\n0.02\n0.00\n0.19 \n\n0.02\n0.23\n0.71 \n\nOriginal Estimates \n\nExchange  Currency \n\nExchange  Currency \n\nInternational consultant \n\n0.02 \n0.23 \n   0.71 \n\n \n \n \n0.00\n0.10\n0.36\n\n \n \n \n0.00 \n0.10 \n0.36 \n\n \n \n \n0.17 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n\nRevised Cost Estimates \nLocal \n\nTotal \nCost \n \n \n \n0.17 \n0.10 \n0.36 \n\n  Battambang \n  Kampot \n  Kompong Cham \n  Kompong  Thom \n  Pursat \n  Svay Rieng \n \n\nPart A: CSHAP \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nItem \n \n \n \n \nA.
