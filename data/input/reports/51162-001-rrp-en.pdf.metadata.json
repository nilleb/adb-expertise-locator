The \nproducts  will  be  exported  to  the  Russian  Federation  and  the  United  Arab  Emirates  (UAE), \nleveraging Spayka\u2019s existing supply chain and client network. The project is fully aligned with the \nGovernment of Armenia\u2019s goals to boost agricultural productivity, exports, and employment. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n1. \n\nProject Identification \n\n \n3. \nImportance  of  agriculture in  Armenia.  Agriculture has  been  deeply  embedded  in the \nsocioeconomic development of Armenia since the country\u2019s economic transition in 1991, when it \nbecame  independent  from  the  former  Soviet  Union.  Armenian  agriculture  sector  represented \n15.9% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product3 and 23.5% of its total merchandise export value4 \nin  2016.  Armenia\u2019s  farmers  (of  whom  more  than  half  are  women)  represent  one-third  of  the \ncountry\u2019s work force.5 \n \n4. \nLow  agricultural  productivity.  The  Armenian  agriculture  sector  suffers  from  low \nproductivity  due  to  multiple  factors,  including  limited  irrigated  land,  inadequate  infrastructure, \nlimited  access  to  finance,  a  lack  of  efficient  technology,  vulnerability  to  natural  hazards,  and \nunderdeveloped market mechanisms. Further, a water shortage in some parts of Armenia\u2014made \nworse  by  climate  change\u2014threatens  the  country\u2019s  irrigation  system.  In  November  2017,  the \ngovernment set a goal to increase agricultural productivity by introducing modern technologies, \npromoting  high  value-added  agriculture,  expanding  export  volumes,  and  providing  favorable \nconditions to farmers.6 \n \n5. \nHorticulture development. Armenia has a natural competitive advantage in horticulture \ndue to  a  large  number  of sunny  days.  High-efficiency  horticulture  (based  on  climate-controlled \ngreenhouses,  drip  irrigation,  and  other  advanced  technologies)  is  identified  as  a  priority \ninvestment area to increase agricultural productivity, cope with the risks of climate change, and \nfully  leverage  Armenia\u2019s  competitive  advantage  in  both  domestic  and  export  markets.  The \n\n                                                \n1  Climate-controlled  greenhouses  ensure  stable  and  optimal  growing  conditions  for  fruits  and  vegetables.  In  an \nenclosed environment, temperature can be controlled by shading, ventilation, and heating (in the winter). Humidity \nis also controlled through ventilation and dehumidifiers. \n\n2  Drip irrigation systems can provide exact amounts of water and fertilizer for each plant at the different growth stages \n\nto optimize the plants\u2019 growth by strictly controlling the nutrient supply. \n\n3  National Statistical Service of the Republic of Armenia\u2019s ARMSTAT Database. \n4  World Trade Organization.

Armenpress. 8 \nNovember. https://armenpress.am/eng/news/911712/we-have-set-a-goal-to-increase-farming-productivity-in-\narmenia%C2%A0%E2%80%93-premier-karapetyan.html. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ncountry\u2019s total greenhouse area increased nearly 2.5 times in 5 years, from 510 ha in 2011 to \n1,220 ha in 2016.7 Vegetables account for nearly two-thirds of greenhouse production (the rest \nincludes fruits and flowers). However, modern greenhouses still represent less than 10% of the \ntotal greenhouse area. Around 75% of modern greenhouses use climate-controlled technologies, \nwhereas  most  smallholder  farmers  still  rely  on  traditional  greenhouse  technologies  with  less \nadvanced operational and disease control systems.8 \n \n6. \nThe  Government  of  Armenia\u2019s  strong  support  for  greenhouse  development.  The \ngovernment  has  prioritized  the  development  of  greenhouses,  especially  climate-controlled \ngreenhouses, as a key area of agricultural development, and is extending support to companies \nand smallholder farmers to improve land access to build greenhouses. To promote investments, \nthe  government  has,  since  2015,  exempted  from  value-added  tax  the  imports  of  greenhouse \nequipment  and  of  several  resources  used  in  greenhouse  crop  production,  such  as  seeds  and \nplanting materials. In 2016, the government decided to lower the tariff of natural gas consumption \nfor  the  agriculture  sector,  including  greenhouses.  Driven  by  government  support,  the  total \ngreenhouse area and the share of climate-controlled greenhouses within the total area are both \nlikely to continue to increase in the foreseeable future. \n \n7. \nHigh  potential  for  greenhouse  vegetable  export.  In  2011\u20132016,  Armenia\u2019s  exports \nincreased  at  an  annualized  rate  of  21.2%,  from  $1.34  billion  in  2011  to  $1.79  billion  in  2016.9 \nVegetables were the fastest-growing commodity among Armenia\u2019s top 10 export categories, up \nby 5,589% from 2009 to2016 (mainly driven by tomato exports). The Russian Federation is the \nlargest  consumer  of  Armenia\u2019s  fruits  and  vegetables.  In  2016,  91.4%  of  Armenia\u2019s  fruit  and \nvegetable export was shipped to the Russian market.10 In addition to favorable weather conditions \nand a geographic proximity to the Russian Federation, Armenia benefits from being of a member \nof  the  Eurasian  Economic  Union  since  January  2015,  meaning  that  Armenian  exports  to  the \nRussian Federation are exempted from any custom duties.  \n \nProject selection. Spayka is the leading food producer, processer, exporter, and logistics \n8. \ncompany in Armenia. The project team identified Spayka as a suitable candidate for the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  support  because  of  (i)  Spayka\u2019s  leading  position  in  Armenia\u2019s \nagricultural export market and satisfactory financial performance; (ii) Spayka\u2019s extensive logistics \nand transportation business as well as strong sales network with top Russian supermarkets since \n2011; (iii) Spayka\u2019s diversified product mix, encompassing greenhouse vegetable production, fruit \nand  vegetable  sourcing from  contract  farms,  canned  food,  and  packaging  products;  and  (iv)  a \ncommitted management with a solid track record in agricultural export and logistics, and market \nknowledge in the destination markets. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n9. \nThe  project  supports  the  expansion  of  Spayka\u2019s  greenhouse  production  and  export  of \nfresh  vegetables.  As  part  of  a  vertical  integration  strategy,  Spayka  plans  to  expand  its  high-\nefficiency  greenhouses  and  construct  an  additional  30  ha  of  climate-controlled  \u201csemi-closed\u201d \ngreenhouses 11 in  Yerevan  to  produce  tomatoes  and  bell  peppers.  These  vegetables  will  be \n\n                                                \n7  World Bank Group. 2016. Export Supply Chain of Greenhouse Crops: Armenia.

The \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3 \n\nexported  to  the  Russian  Federation  and  the  UAE  by  taking  advantage  of  Spayka\u2019s  existing \ntransportation and logistics business and established client network in these countries. \n \n10. \nSpayka  started  greenhouse  operations  in  2014  to  secure  its  supply  of  fruits  and \nvegetables and achieve its value chain integration strategy by connecting greenhouse production \nto its food production, processing, packaging, transportation, and logistics businesses. Besides \nthe 30 ha of semi-closed greenhouses to be funded by ADB, Spayka is currently operating 35 ha \nof  closed  greenhouses, 12 constructing  20  ha  of  closed  greenhouses,  and  plans  to  construct \nanother 20 ha of semi-closed greenhouses. By the end of 2018, Spayka will own and operate a \ntotal of 105 ha of greenhouses. \n \n11. \nSpayka has extensive experience in greenhouse development and management. It has \ndeveloped  and  customized  its  greenhouses  to  take  full  advantage  of  location  and  climate \nconditions. The project\u2019s projected yield is around 45 kilograms (kg) per square meter (m2) for \ntomatoes and 22 kg per m2 for bell peppers annually. Tomatoes and bell peppers were selected \nbecause of the high demand for these products in export markets and their long shelf-life. Demand \nremains constant throughout the year although vegetable supply from open-field horticulture  is \nseasonal  and  dependent  on  weather  conditions. Therefore,  expanding greenhouse will  reduce \nthe seasonality of production and secure stable production and exports throughout the year. \n \nFollowing a vertically integrated value chain approach, sales of greenhouse vegetables \n12. \nwill  be  through Spayka\u2019s  existing  logistics  and  transportation  chain,  including  Spayka\u2019s fleet  of \n215 trucks and 250 contracted trucks, three warehouses in Yerevan, and advanced refrigerated \ncold  storage  facility  at  the  Armenia\u2013Georgia  border.  Products  will  be  sold  in  high-quality \npackaging produced by Spayka Plastics. Spayka transports agricultural products from Armenia \nvia Georgia to the Russian Federation. Spayka has established strong sales channels with large \nsupermarket chains in the Russian Federation since 2011.  \n \nThe semi-closed greenhouse technology was invented in the United States in 2005 and \n13. \nhas been widely used in Europe and North America, especially for growing tomatoes. The semi-\nclosed technology creates the optimal microclimate environment inside the greenhouse due to its \nadvanced ventilation and shading system. Air exchange takes place through two air distribution \ncorridors where air is mixed with outside air and pumped back into the greenhouse. Overall, semi-\nclosed greenhouses have two to three times higher yields and are three to four times more water-\nefficient than traditional open-field horticulture because they can control temperature, humidity, \ncarbon  dioxide  and  pest  population,  and  are  equipped  with  advanced  drip  irrigation  systems. \nSemi-closed technology can decrease operational costs by (i) reducing heating costs as internal \nand external air is mixed in the corridors to reach the suitable temperature; and (ii) reducing agri-\nchemical treatment cost because there is almost no access for pests to enter the greenhouse.   \n \nClimate-controlled semi-closed greenhouses have higher climate adaptation benefits than \n14. \nthe  greenhouses  typically  used  by  Armenian  farmers,  as  these  cannot  appropriately  control \nweather conditions during the entire year and are also more exposed to damage climate change \nrisks such as flooding, extreme temperatures, and excessive snow loading. The incremental cost \n\n                                                \n\nsemi-closed greenhouse technology provides active and optimal air conditioning and cooling inside the greenhouse \nduring hot seasons, and moisture and cool climate conditions during cold seasons. \n\n12 Closed  greenhouses  represent  the  older  generation  of  climate-controlled  greenhouses,  in  which  the  only  way  to \ncontrol the temperature is to open the ventilation windows and exchange air with the outside air. Insects come into \nthe greenhouse together with the exchanging air, making it more difficult to control diseases. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nto achieve higher climate adaptation benefits is around 59% of the total ADB loan amount, which \nis equivalent to $18.8 million.13  \n \n\n3. \n\nBorrower \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nIntegrity  due diligence  was conducted.15 No significant  or  potentially  significant  integrity \n\n \n15. \nSpayka was established in 2001 in Armenia as a freight forwarding company. Its business \ngradually grew into trading and exporting fresh fruits and vegetables to the Russian Federation, \nthe  rest  of  the  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States, 14 and  Europe.  Spayka  is  the  largest \nexporter of agrarian production with more than 90% market share in tomato and pepper exports \nfrom Armenia. In addition to exporting fruits and vegetables, Spayka has been engaged in trading \ndairy products, producing canned food, packaging production and vehicle services to achieve the \nvertical integration strategy. As of 2017, the company has 886 employees, including 60% women. \n \n16. \nSpayka\u2019s senior management team consists of national and international specialists with \nsubstantial  industry  knowledge  and  experience.  They  have  broad  experience  in  finance, \nagronomy, marketing and sales, greenhouse management, and engineering. Davit Ghazaryan, \nthe chief executive officer and founder of Spayka, has over 16 years of management experience.  \n \n17. \nrisks were identified. Tax integrity due diligence was not required.16  \n \nB. \n \n18. \nImpacts.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impacts  and  consistent  with  key \nobjectives  of  the  Armenian  Development  Strategy  2025:  (i)  the  development  of  a  modern \nagriculture  sector  through  \u201cindustrialization\u201d  (including  through  the  application  of  modern \ntechnologies like greenhouses), (ii) the promotion of exports of agricultural products in support of \nan  export\noriented  economy  and  the  integration  of  the  Armenian  economy  into  regional \ncooperation  formats  and  the  international  economy  in general,  and  (iii)  increased  employment \nand  a  minimum  salary  through  the  creation  of  quality  and  well-paid  jobs  as  one  of  the  main \nconditions to eradicate poverty and redistribute income.17 \n \nOutcome. The project will have the following outcome: the promotion of high-efficiency, \n19. \nenvironmentally  sound,  and  export-oriented  horticultural  production  based  on  climate-resilient \ntechnologies  such  as  semi-closed greenhouses and drip  irrigation  systems.  Annual  production \nfrom this project is expected to reach 6.4 million kg of tomatoes and 1.1 million kg of bell peppers \nby 2022. The project will create about 275 full-time jobs, including 35 management team members \nand agronomists and 240 workers for nursing, plantation, and pickup. \n \n20. \nOutputs. (i) increased greenhouse operations, (ii) increased contribution of horticulture to \nthe local economy, and (iii) increased and improved employment and training opportunities for \nfemale employees. Indicators are included in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n                                                \n13  The  total  costs  of  semi-closed  greenhouses  and  Armenian  farmers\u2019  greenhouses  are  $1,228,000  per  ha  and \n$507,600 per ha, respectively. The incremental cost to achieve higher climate adaptation benefits is around 59%.  \n14 The Commonwealth of Independent States includes Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz \n\n\u2010\n\nRepublic, Moldova, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Ukraine. \n\n15 ADB. 2003.

The  project  promotes  the \nimprovement of agricultural productivity through investments in research and development, water \ninfrastructure,  and agribusiness,  which are  emphasized  by  ADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy \n2020. 18 ADB\u2019s  Armenia  country  partnership  strategy  is  based  on  three  development  pillars: \n(i) high and sustainable economic growth, (ii) broadened access to economic opportunities, and \n(iii)  strengthened  social  protection. 19  The  project  supports  pillars  (i)  and  (ii)  since  Spayka \ntransports goods to the Russian Federation through Georgia, owns logistics assets in Georgia, \nand  sources  products  from  Georgian  farmers.  The  project  is  also  fully  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \nOperational Plan for Regional Cooperation and Integration, which under its \u201cOperational Direction \n2:  Raising  Competitiveness  in  Connected  Markets\u201d  calls  for  \u201cimproved  growth  and  business \ncompetitiveness in regional markets through new opportunities in cross-border trade, investment, \ntechnology, finance, and labor mobility.\u201d20 \n \n22. \nConsistency  with  the  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \naligned with the four priorities of ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Agriculture and Natural Resources, \nas follows: (i) increasing the productivity and reducing pre- and post-harvest losses of food crops; \n(ii) improving market connectivity and value chain linkages; (iii) enhancing food safety, quality, \nand nutrition; and (iv) enhancing the management and climate resilience of natural resources.21 \nThe  project  will  complement  two  Armenian  sovereign  investment  projects  north-south  road \ncorridor and Armenia-Georgia border regional road (M6 Vanadzor-Bagratashen)22 which aim to \ndevelop  more  accessible,  higher  quality,  and  more  frequent  road  transport;  and  create  more \nbusiness opportunities for private sector companies in rural areas, particularly in agribusiness and \nservices.23 \n \nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nThe estimated total project cost is $36.8 million.

Agricultural activity in Armenia is exempt from profit tax. The Government \nof Armenia is promoting the development of greenhouses through an array of incentives (para. 6). \nSpayka has a management team led by Davit Ghazaryan, chief executive officer and founder of the \ncompany.a \nSpayka will report quarterly on financial and operational key performance indicators, and annually \non safeguard and development indicators (i.e., output and outcome targets).  \na  The  management  structure  is  described  in  Client  Information  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nPerformance \nmonitoring \n\nManagement \n\nAppendix 2). \n\nSources: Spayka Limited Liability Company and Asian Development Bank. \n \nF. \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\n[Redacted] \n \nG. \n\nUnique Features \n\nThe Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \n27. \nagreed with Spayka. \n \n\n \n\nThe  project  will  support  an  internationally  competitive,  climate-resilient,  and  inclusive \n26. \nbusiness  model  for  high-quality  vegetable  production  in  Asia.25 It  is  ADB\u2019s  first  nonsovereign \nproject in the agriculture sector in Armenia and the South Caucasus. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nADB will extend a loan of up to $32,000,000 to Spayka.

Spayka\u2019s greenhouse employees will earn more than the average salary in the \nagriculture sector. Spayka sources from 5,000 farmers, the majority of them in the bottom 60% of income distribution. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7 \n\nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n28. \n\nADB assistance will add value on several fronts: \n(i) \n\nLong-term  financing.  ADB  will  provide  long-term  debt  which  is  not  readily \navailable in Armenia. ADB is in a unique position to offer such financing because \nof  its  understanding  of  the  agriculture  sector  and  experience  in  greenhouse \nhorticulture financing in other countries. \nPromotion of high-efficiency technology. ADB\u2019s support will encourage the use \nof  semi-closed  greenhouse  technology  that  is  productivity-enhancing  and \nenvironmentally sound (reducing the use of land, water, energy, and other inputs). \nSafeguard best practices. ADB will help Spayka develop a robust environmental \nand social management plan following the best international safeguard practices, \nand will monitor the company\u2019s progress during project implementation.  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\nRisks \n\nC. \n \n[Redacted] \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n29. \nSafeguards. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is \nclassified  as  category  B  for  the  environment  and  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement  and \nindigenous  peoples.  An  initial  environmental  examination  report  has  been  prepared  to  meet \nADB\u2019s  requirements.  The  project  location  is  devoid  of  any  dense  vegetation,  structures,  or \nhabitation; therefore, no significant site disturbance will occur. The potential environmental and \nsocial impacts of the project have been identified during due diligence, and effective measures to \navoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts are being incorporated in the \nenvironmental  and  social  management  plan.  The  greenhouses  will  be  equipped  with  Priva \nprocess  computers  that  will  control  and  monitor  the  climate,  water  quality,  and  energy \nconsumption to create the most optimal growing conditions for the crops inside the greenhouses. \nSpayka\u2019s institutional capacity and commitment to manage the project\u2019s social and environment \nimpacts are deemed adequate. \n \n30. \nThis project will be built on a 47.76 ha plot of land donated by the Government of Yerevan \nMunicipality. In the 1990s, people were issued permits to cultivate the land, which was under the \ncontrol of Shengavit Community. These permits were canceled in 2008 when a law was passed \nchanging the status of the communities to administrative districts. In 2012, Yerevan Municipality \nacquired  the  land  to  be  managed  by  the  Armenian  Crop  Promoting  Centre  (a  public\u2013private \npartnership that became a private company in 2014) for the development of a greenhouse facility. \nThe  government  compensated  the  remaining  users  of  the  community  land;  however,  the \ngreenhouse development did not materialize as some conditions were not met. The land was left \nunused from 2012 until 2017. In early 2017, Spayka applied to the government for the allocation \nof a land plot to develop a greenhouse complex. In July 2017, Yerevan Municipality and Spayka \nsigned a donation contract and a property certificate was issued to Spayka. No one is currently \nliving on or using the land, and there are no outstanding complaints with regard to the land. \n \nYerevan  is  largely  a  mono-ethnic  municipality,  with  98.9%  of  the  population  being \n31. \nArmenians. The main ethnic minorities are Yazidis (0.3%) and Russians (0.5%). The greenhouse \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nproject is in Yerevan Municipality in Shengavit Administrative District, which is inhabited mostly \nby Armenians and a few ethnic minorities already mainstreamed into society. \n \n32. \nOther social dimensions. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. \nSpayka will implement a gender action plan that includes (i) employing 240 greenhouse workers \n(65%  women);  and  (ii)  improving  the  company\u2019s  human  resource  policy  to  include  provisions \nensuring  equal  opportunities  for  female  employees,  including  gender  equality  in  recruitment, \ntraining, parental leave and childcare provisions, equal pay for equal work, and the prohibition of \nsexual harassment in the workplace, among others.26 Spayka will comply with national labor laws \nand, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001), will take measures to comply with the \ninternationally recognized core labor standards.27 Spayka will report regularly to ADB on its and \nits contractors\u2019 compliance with such laws, and the measures taken.28 \n \nB. \n \n33. \nSpayka was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practices relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe loan documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money laundering, \nand the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n \n[Redacted] \n \nD. \n \nConsistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),29 \n34. \nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of Armenia \nhas  no  objection  to  the  proposed  assistance  to  Spayka.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  finance \ndocumentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed \nassistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nAssurances \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n35. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  up  to \n$32,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to Spayka Limited Liability Company for the \nHigh-Efficiency Horticulture and Integrated Supply Chain Project in Armenia, with such terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be \nreported to the Board. \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n\n                                                \n26 Gender Action Plan (available from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 ADB. 2003.
