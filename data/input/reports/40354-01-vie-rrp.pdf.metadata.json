The program will support the development and implementation of the new Law on \nExamination  and  Treatment  (LET)  governing  health  facilities  and  the  registration  and  practice  of \nhealth professionals, a new comprehensive plan to upgrade teaching institutions, and the adoption \nof new models for costing and managing service delivery in district hospitals.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM  \n\n \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nViet  Nam  has  made  notable  progress  in  reducing  poverty  and  improving  the  health \nstatus  of  its  citizens.  The  country  is  on  track  to  achieve  most  of  its  health-related  Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals  (MDGs)  by  2015.2 Key  challenges  still  confront  Viet  Nam  in  its  effort  to \nprovide equitable access to high-quality health services and to further improve health outcomes \nacross  the  different  regions  and  segments  of  the  population.  Much  of  the  improvement  in \nnational health indicators has been driven by gains in the heavily populated regions of Ha Noi \nand Ho Chi Minh City. Remote and rural provinces lag significantly behind; if measured alone, \nthey would not meet the MDGs. The demand for higher-quality health services has increased as \na result of growing prosperity and the emerging middle class, particularly in urban areas.  \n \n4. \nTo  continue  improvements  in  health  status  and  extend  the  benefits  more  broadly  and \nequitably,  the  government  has  set  out  an  ambitious  plan  to  address  an  array  of  continuing \nproblems in the health sector. The Master Plan: Vietnam Health Systems Development to 2010 \nand the Vision to 2020 calls for making access and use of health services more equitable and \neffective to protect and promote people\u2019s health.3 It aims to improve the quality of health care at \nall levels, with attention to the poor, women, minority groups, and those living in remote areas. \n \n5. \nRecognized  need  for  reform.  While the needs for policy development and investment \nare diverse, complex, and intricately interwoven, the government has identified areas for policy \nreform in the short to medium term to achieve the overarching sector goals of equity, efficiency, \nand  development.  They  include  strengthening  the  policies  that  underpin  service  delivery, \nespecially the management of human and financial resources and the training of health workers. \nThe  government\u2019s  legislative  and  policy  reform  agenda  provides  opportunities  to  introduce \ncritical reforms that will  lead to significant advances in the management and training of health \nworkers  and  integration  of  that  workforce  into  an  improved  setting  for  health  service  delivery. \nThe reforms include the passage of the LET, a master plan to upgrade teaching institutions, and \nthe adoption of new models for budgeting and managing service delivery in district hospitals.4  \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2007.

Ha Noi.  \n\n4  Another new law on \"public service providers\"\u2014which is currently under preparation for enactment in late 2010\u2014\n\nwill complement the LET through improved general management of health sector personnel. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nLicensing  of  health  facilities.  Viet  Nam  has  no  system  for  licensing  and  registering \n6. \nhealth facilities, from local doctors' clinics to large hospitals. The rapid growth of private facilities \nhas increased the need for such a system. A licensing system should apply to public and private \nfacilities,  and  will  be  useful  in  gradually  improving  standards  in  the  public  system  while \nprotecting  the  public  from  inferior  private  providers.  Licensing  guidelines  relate  to  the  physical \nqualities  of  the  facility,  available  medical  equipment,  and  the  qualifications  and  registration \nstatus of professionals working within the facility.  \n \nHealth  workforce  registration. Viet Nam is one of the few countries in Asia that does \n7. \nnot  have  a  functioning  system  for  regulating  and  managing  the  registration  of  its  health \nworkforce. This constraints quality and management in a number of areas, including regulation \nof  professional  qualifications  and  skill  standards,  quality  monitoring  of  individual  performance, \ntaking disciplinary action when problems arise, and enforcing ongoing skills development. Given \nViet  Nam's  commitments  under  the  Mutual  Recognition  Arrangement  on  Nursing  Services \nadopted  by  the  Association  of  South  East  Asian  Nations  in  2006,  the  government  recognizes \nthe  urgent  need  to  establish  a  registration  system  to  better  serve  consumers  and  to  meet  its \nregional obligations. \n \n8. \nHuman  resource  constraints.  Viet  Nam  has  a  large  number  of  health  workers,  but \nimprovements  in  health  services  and  outcomes  are  constrained  by  the  workers\u2019  skill  levels, \ndistribution,  management,  and  financing.  There  are  insufficient  medical  specialists,  nurses, \ncollege-trained  pharmacists,  public  health  workers,  and  specialist  managers,  particularly  for \nhospitals and in the poor and remote areas with the greatest needs. Urban areas are also facing \nthe growing loss of highly skilled health professionals to the rapidly emerging private sector. The \nvariable  and  at  times  poor  performance  of  health  workers  can  be  attributed  to  a  lack  of \nknowledge  and  skills,  limited  supplies  and  equipment,  low  motivation,  and  weak  human \nresource management.  \n \n9. \nHealth  workforce  capacity  building.  Health  personnel  are  trained  in  universities, \ncolleges,  and  secondary  medical  colleges.  There  is  an  urgent  need  for  an  increase  in  the \nnumber  of  health  graduates  to  meet  the  growing  demands  of  the  expanding  population.  It  is \nestimated that the number of health graduates (doctors, nurses, pharmacists, technicians) has \nto  double  every  6  years,  or  grow  by  18%  per  year,  to  maintain  current  ratios.    The  quality  of \nthese institutions also needs to improve as they have been affected by a weak and incomplete \npolicy framework, fragmented array of organizational structures, and limited funding.  \n \n10. \nLow  government  spending  on  health.  Government  expenditures  on  health  have  not \nkept  pace  with  economic  growth.  Low  health  spending  underlies  many  of  the  remaining  and \npersistent problems in the sector. While annual health expenditures have risen substantially\u2014\nfrom as low as $28 per capita in 2000 to $46 in 2006\u2014the government\u2019s share has increased \nonly  slightly,  from  30.1%  of  total  health  spending  in  2000  to  32.3%  in  2006.5 Private  out-of-\npocket payments account for the major share of health spending (these accounted for 62.2% of \nspending in 2006, which is one of the highest levels worldwide). Low public spending on health \n(particularly on health workers\u2019 wages and other incentives) combined with the widening wage \ndisparity  between  public  and  private  sector  workers  exacerbate  the  chronic  problems  of \nrecruiting and retaining qualified health workers.  \n \n11. \nQuality, management, and financing of health services. The systems and guidelines \nfor  internal  quality  control  in  hospitals  are  weak,  and  the  regulatory  frameworks  are  not  well \ndeveloped.  A  lack  of  policy  direction  and  financial  incentives  has  frustrated  efforts  to  address \n\n                                                 \n5   World Health Organization. 2009. World Health Statistics 2009. Geneva.  \n\n2 \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nthese  challenges,  especially  for  hospitals.  Hospital  financing  is  currently  supply-driven,  based \nprimarily on staff levels and number of beds, which encourages overuse and inefficiency. The \nuse of per-case payment methods (supported by \"care pathways\") offers a promising alternative \nto current payment methods. Care pathways are written protocols that describe integrated care \nstrategies for selected conditions and serve as a basis for budgeting the per-case payments and \nmonitoring the quality of care.  \n\nis \n\nthat  human \n\nresource  constraints  need \n\n12. \nLessons. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has financed six health projects in Viet \nNam and is one of the key development partners in the health sector. An important lesson from \nto  be  addressed  more \nthis  experience \ncomprehensively, with support integrated into existing systems rather than in the form of project-\nbased training.  While sector development programs are new to the health sector in Viet Nam, \nlessons  from  similar  loans  in  other  sectors  highlight  the  need  to  target  a  small,  timely,  and \ninfluential set of policy actions with regular and meaningful dialogue.6  \n \n13. \nSector development program approach. A road map has been prepared to support a \ncoordinated  and  comprehensive  program  of  reform  and  investment  that  addresses  human \nresource  constraints  in the  health  sector.  A  sector  development  program  approach  provides  a \nsuitable mechanism for initiating a transition in the delivery of official development assistance in \nthe sector, as well as offering the opportunity to support a combination of system-focused policy \nreforms  with  accompanying  investments  to  address  critical  needs  with  respect  to  the  quality, \nefficiency,  and  capacity  of  health  human  resources.  The  program  was  developed  through \nextensive  consultation  that  included  intensive  technical  inputs  on  the  development  of  the \nworkforce registration system and legislation on medical practice from ADB and a small group of \ndevelopment partners7 with long-term experience in the sector.  \n\n \n14. \nThe  proposed  program  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2010\u2013\n20128 and is consistent with Viet Nam\u2019s 5-year socioeconomic development plan.9 The program \ncovers both education and health sectors in line with Strategy 202010 and the operational plan \nfor  health,11 as  it  supports  health  training  institutions  and  health  workforce  development,  and \nstrengthens  the  planning  and  governance  of  health  public  expenditure.  The  proposed \ninvestment  addresses  a  binding  constraint  to  achieving  the  MDGs  across  all  segments  of  the \npopulation  and  geographic  areas.  This  is  not  currently  addressed  by  development  partners  in \nthe same comprehensive manner. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe impact of the program will be improved health status and progress toward meeting \n15. \nthe health-related MDG targets, especially in the remote and poor provinces. The outcome will \nbe better quality, efficiency, and equity in the health workforce and health service delivery.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n16. \nThe outputs will support the government's ongoing reform agenda for the health sector, \nspecifically  relating  to  health  human  resources  (HHR).  It  includes  (i)  better  planning  and \n\n                                                 \n6   Development Coordination (Appendix 2). \n7   Australian  Agency  for  International  Development,  Pathfinder  International,  World  Bank,  and  World  Health \n\nOrganization. \n\n8   ADB. 2010.

The  accompanying  project  loan \nsupports  investments  directly  linked  to  implementation  of  the  policy  actions  in  key  institutions, \nincluding the Ministry of Health (MOH) and a select number of teaching institutions.  \n \n\n1. \n\nProgram Outputs \n\nKey  policy  actions  supported  under  the  program  loan  are  described  in  paras.  18\u201324; \n\n \n17. \ndetails are in the development policy letter (Appendix 3) and policy matrix (Appendix 4). \n \n\na. \n\nBetter Planning and Management of Human Resources \n\n \n18. \nJoint  committee  on  health  human  resources. MOH approved a decision on 21 April \n2010  to  establish  a  joint  committee  on  HHR  to  address  fragmentation  of  HHR  policy  and \nprogram  implementation.  Within  2  years,  the  committee  will  submit  a  report  to  MOH  defining \nworkforce  needs  and  targets,  and  recommending  policy  measures  and  plans,  including \nrecommendations on expanding the health workforce, incentives for working conditions in rural \nand  remote  areas,  and  improving  the  gender  balance  at  senior  levels  of  MOH  and  provincial \nhealth departments. \n \n19. \nLaw on Examination and Treatment. Approved by the National Assembly in November \n2009, the LET is an omnibus law that covers a wide area of health care practice including (i) the \nrights  and  responsibilities  of  patients,  medical  practitioners,  and  health  care  facilities;  (ii)  the \nclassification,  accreditation,  and  licensing  of  health  professionals  and  health  care  facilities; \n(iii) operational procedures in health services; and (iv) the recording and remedying of medical \nmalpractice. The LET and the subsequent implementation decrees and circulars are critical to \nestablishing  the  institutions  and  systems  necessary  for  long-term,  sustained  improvements  in \nHHR. It will also set the standards and regulate the quality and safety of medical examination \nand  treatment  provided  within  health  facilities  and  by  health  professionals.  The  program \nrecognizes the adoption of the LET, provides incentives for the efficient implementation of the \npolicy actions, and contributes to the costs associated with LET implementation.  \n \n\nb. \n\nHigher Quality Human Resources Training \n\n \nHealth  human  resource  training  network  master  plan.  In  February  2010,  MOH \n20. \nsubmitted  to  the  Prime  Minister  a  master  plan  that  addresses  the  acute  staff  shortages  and \nrecognizes  the  need  to  rapidly  increase  the  number  of  graduates,  expand  coverage,  and \nimprove training quality. The plan includes proposals to upgrade medical colleges to universities \nand  some  secondary  medical  schools  to  medical  colleges  in  underserved  areas.  It  outlines  a \ncomprehensive  approach  to  increasing  investment  in  staffing,  curriculum  development,  and \nequipment in training institutions. The policy matrix recognizes the development of this plan and \nthe significant work that follows the passage of the LET.  \n \n21. \nRotation  of  medical specialists  to  lower-level  hospitals.  MOH approved (i) Circular \n09 (2008), which requires health training institutions to assign faculty and medical specialists to \nwork with provincial and district hospitals; and (ii) Circular 1816 (2009), which imposes the same \nrequirement on high-level hospitals. The rotation of specialist medical staff through lower-level \nhospitals and commune health centers will boost the availability and quality of local health care, \nespecially in remote and mountainous areas, and support skills transfer to local health care staff. \nA  comprehensive  policy  review  of  the  implementation  of  Circulars  09  and  1816  will  be \nundertaken after about 2 years to consider their impact and make recommendations for further \npolicy development or modifications to improve policy outcomes.  \n \n\n4 \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nIncreasing  access  to  training  and  education.  Decision  134  (2006)  and  Circular  13 \n22. \n(2008) of MOH outline measures to increase access to training and education for health workers \nfrom  ethnic  minority  communities.  These  include  waiver  of  tuition  fees,  lower  entrance \nrequirements,  and  bridging  and  preparatory  courses.  Within  2  years  of  program  loan \neffectiveness,  MOH  will  complete  a  policy  impact  review  on  increasing  the  enrollment  and \ncompletion rates of ethnic minority students, especially women, in health training, including the \nimplementation of Decree 134 and Circular 13.  \n \n\nc. \n\nImproved Management Systems in Health Service Delivery \n\n \n23. \nIncreased  government  spending  on  health.  In  May  2008,  the  National  Assembly \nadopted  a  resolution  to  increase  the  share  of  annual  state  budget  spending  for  health  care, \nensuring that health spending will grow faster than overall state budget spending. The resolution \nrecognizes that health spending has not kept pace with economic growth. This resolution is an \nimportant measure to ensure the budget level does not continue to decline, and to maintain real \nbudget growth.   \n \nInnovative  clinical  management  procedures  and  health  services  financing.  MOH \n24. \nissued a De An (project plan) in November 2009 to support further piloting and adoption of the \ncare pathway delivery mechanism, and authorized the health insurance fund and the provincial \nhealth  authorities  to  pilot  the  case-based  payment  system  in  hub  and  cluster  hospitals.  Policy \nactions  under  the  second  tranche  requires  20  care  pathways  to  be  developed,  benchmarked, \nand  budgeted  in  at  least  six  hospitals,  including  at  least  three  pathways  that  directly  relate  to \nmedical care for women and/or at the primary level. Guidelines for financing reforms associated \nwith care pathways are to be submitted to MOH and the Ministry of Finance. \n \n \n \n25. \nThe project loan supports a set of linked and coordinated actions that are closely aligned \nwith  the  policy  actions  and  are  designed  to  support  their  implementation  at  national  and  sub-\nnational levels. The key project outputs are described in paras. 26\u201332. \n \n\nProject Outputs \n\n2. \n\na. \n\nBetter Planning and Management of Human Resources \n\n \nStronger  human  resources  policy,  planning,  and  implementation.  This  output  will \n26. \nfocus on building the capacity and systems for planning and managing HHR at the central level. \nThe  project  will  support  the  establishment  and  operation  of  the  joint  committee  on  HHR  by \nproviding  (i)  capacity-building  inputs  to  establish  the  committee;  identifying  appropriate \nrepresentation  (including  district  and  community  representatives,  while  taking  into  account  the \nneed for a gender balance, and ethnic minority representation); (ii) terms of reference; and (iii) a \nsecretariat with appropriate equipment, facilities, and operating budget.  \n \nEstablished  systems  for  the  registration  and  licensure  of  health  professionals. \n27. \nThis output will support technical inputs to guide the legal and administrative arrangements to \nestablish and oversee the registration of health professionals, as provided in the LET. It will also \nsupport  the  establishment  and  operation  of  the  health  professional  registration  system  at  the \nprovincial  and  national  level.  Support  will  be  provided  for  the  development  of  a  standardized \ndatabase  system,  the  procurement  of  computer  equipment,  database  software,  training  of \ncentral  and  provincial  staff  in  certification  of  health  professionals,  and  development  of  an \neffective accountability mechanism to implement the system at the different regional, provincial, \nand institutional levels in the health sector.  \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nb. \n\nHigher Quality Human Resources Training \n\n \n28. \nStronger  capacity  of  teaching  institutions. The project will strengthen the universities, \ncolleges, and schools responsible for training the health workforce, including pre-service and post-\ngraduate  training  and  continuing  education.  Support  will  be  provided  for  the  procurement  and \nmaintenance of prioritized teaching equipment and training laboratories to facilitate the application \nof modern teaching and learning methods in key training institutions in each part of the country. \nExpert  inputs  will  support  the  development  of  minimum  standards  for  equipment  maintenance \nschedules. The targeted institutions will become teaching and learning resources or \u201chubs\u201d for the \nother  institutions  in  the  region.  Teachers  in  targeted  institutions  will  be  trained  to  improve  skills \nand teaching methods. Selection of trainees will include targets for women and ethnic minorities. \n \nStronger mechanisms for quality improvement and assurance. The project will help \n29. \nMOH  pilot  an  accreditation  system  for  training  institutions  based  on  the  requirements \nestablished in the LET. The supervisory system for training institutions will be strengthened at \nthe  national  and  regional  levels.  Criteria  for  accreditation  and  tools  for  internal  and  external \nevaluation will be developed, staff will be trained, and accreditation processes supported. The \nproject will also support the implementation of Circular 07 on continuing medical education.  \n \n30. \nStronger staff training and utilization in remote areas. The project will help MOH and \nselected training institutions serving remote communities increase the number of ethnic minority \nand female students from remote areas who complete health worker training and return to work \nin their local health facilities. The project will support and strengthen some pre-existing special \nentry  programs  that  are  not  being  utilized  efficiently.

This output will support the further \n31. \ndevelopment and expansion of the pilot care pathways mechanism for organizing clinical work \nlinked  to  the  provider  payment  mechanism.  Six  \u201chub\u201d  hospitals  will  be  selected  to  become \nresource  transfer  centers  for  development  and  implementation  of  20  care  pathways  for  high-\nvolume  conditions  within  the  capability  of  district  hospitals.  Project  activities  will  comprise  (i) \npiloting care pathways for organizing clinical work; (ii) introducing product-focused management \nmethods  and  structures;  (iii)  introducing  and  testing  case-based  funding  mechanisms;  and \n(iv) strengthening  the  policy  framework  and  human  resource  capacities  to  implement  case-\nbased provider payment linked to care pathways. \n \n32. \nIntroducing  and  testing  case-based  funding  mechanisms.  The  project  will  support \nthe development, training, testing, and evaluation of a case-based payment system associated \nwith  the  care  pathways  pilot.  The  health  insurance  fund  will  be  supported  to  (i)  develop  and \nimplement case-based pricing and to negotiate and monitor volume and/or price contracts with \nhospitals, and (ii) institute performance monitoring that includes cost and fraud control.  \n \nD. \n \n33. \nThe overall sector development program financing is estimated at $76.3 million (Table 1). \nThe government has requested loans from ADB's Special Funds resources as indicated below.  \n \n \n\nFinancing and Investment Plans \n\n6 \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nTable 1: Health Human Resource Sector Development Program Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank (program loan) \nAsian Development Bank (project loan) \nGovernment of Australia (project loan) \nGovernment of Viet Nam \n \n\nTotal \n\n \n\nAmount ($ million) \n30.0 \n30.0 \n11.0 \n5.3 \n76.3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nShare of Total (%) \n\n32.5 \n32.5 \n24.0 \n11.0 \n100.0 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nFinancing  plan  for  Program  loan.  ADB  will  provide  a  program  loan  in  various \n34. \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR20,086,000  from  ADB's  Special  Funds  resources.  The  loan  will \nhave  a  24-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft program loan agreement.  \n \n35. \nIn  determining  the  amount  of  the  program  loan,  the  following  factors  were  considered: \n(i) the  scope  and  strength  of  the  proposed  policy  actions;  (ii)  the  relative  importance  of  the \nhealth  sector  in  terms  of  public  spending  and  recent  budget  growth  trends;  and  (iii)  the  short- \nand  medium-term  costs  of  the  proposed  policy  actions  and  the  associated  financing  gap.  The \nloan amount covers part of the adjustment costs12 for the measures in the policy matrix. A large \nportion  of  the  program  loan  will  be  used  to  implement  the  master  plan  for  upgrading  health \nteaching  institutions.  Loan  proceeds  will  also  contribute  to  costs  incurred  in  implementing  the \ninstitutional reforms initiated by the LET, such as the establishment of a registration system for \nthe health workers and a system for licensing health facilities.  \n \n36. \nThe program loan will be released in two equal tranches. The first will be released upon \nloan effectiveness on completion of all first-tranche policy actions; the second after 24 months \nwhen the remaining policy actions are expected to have been completed.  \n \n37. \n(Table  2).

The  program  will  improve  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  the \nhealth  workforce  through  passage  of  the  LET  and  improvements  in  training  quality.  This  may \nimprove standards of health care and ultimately improve overall population health outcomes. At \nthe  sector  level,  economic  benefits  will  accrue  from  efficiency  gains  resulting  from  upgraded \ntraining  facilities;  better  training  and  financing  methods;  and  improved  clinical,  administrative, \nand  human  resources  management.  This  will  lead  to  more  cost-effective  use  of  health \nresources, making the sector more financially sustainable. Improving access to, and quality of, \nhealth care will increase economic productivity by helping to reduce morbidity in the workforce. \nBetter diagnosis and reduced treatment cost will reduce people\u2019s out-of-pocket costs, especially \namong the poor. \n \n40. \nFinancial  sustainability.  The  government  has  committed  to  increasing  the  health \nbudget faster than the average annual increase in the government budget. A modest increment \nof 0.05% (estimated to cover the project investment recurrent costs) would result in an annual \ncost  to  the  government  of  $4.2 million.  The  recurrent  costs  associated  with  the  licensing  of \nhealth facilities and the health workforce will be increasingly financed by registration fees.  \n                                                 \n13  Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nGovernance \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nB. \n \n41. \nFinancial  management.  MOH  has  extensive  experience  with  projects  and  ADB \nprocedures, and should be able to use its experience to facilitate effective and efficient financial \nmanagement  of  loan  funds  and  project  activities.  PMU  staff  with  relevant  experience  will  be \nsought, and the PMU will work closely with existing ADB-supported PMUs. Project consultants \nwill train staff in financial planning, accounting, reporting, auditing, and control. The consultants \nwill  implement  a  performance-based  planning  and  budgeting  system  based  on  established \nnational and project-specific cost norms.  \n \n42. \nAnticorruption measures. ADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam.  In  November  2009,  an \nanticorruption  dialogue  focusing  on  the  health  sector  was  held  between  the  government  and \ndevelopment  partners.  Further,  ADB  conducted  governance  risk  assessments  that  also \nhighlighted  fiduciary  risks  in  the  health  sector. 14  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual.  \n \nC. \n \n43. \nPoverty.  The  program  will  improve  health  care  services  for  the  poor  in  remote \ncommunities by strengthening the capacity of health facilities and teaching institutions to serve \ntheir  special  needs.  The  strengthened  teaching  institutions  will  ensure  that  there  are  more \ngraduates available to work in these areas, and will also improve their training. Quality control \nmechanisms for health professionals and facilities, particularly registration and licensing, should \ndisproportionately  benefit  those  with  the  poorest  quality  services  and  health  workers.  Better \naccess to quality health services and lower health care costs will benefit the poor. \n \n44. \nGender. Women and adolescent girls in poor, remote, and ethnic minority communities \nare particularly affected by the limited access to quality health services. Design measures are \nincluded  to  promote  improved  access  and  equity,  and  targets  are  set  for  training  of  female \nhealth  workers  and  provision  of  scholarships  in  all  training  programs.  While  most  health  care \nworkers  are  women,  most  of  them  are  concentrated  in  lower-level  positions.  MOH  aims  to \nincrease the proportion of women in higher-level positions and ensure all program activities are \nconsistent with the Gender Equality Law.15 A project gender strategy has been prepared. \n \nD. \n \nEthnic  minorities.  Poverty  rates  and  health  indicators  lag  substantially  among \n45. \nmarginalized ethnic groups. It is estimated that nearly half of poor women and more than 70% of \nwomen in mountainous areas gave birth at home, compared with about 5% of well-off women.16 \nPoor, rural, and ethnic minority groups, especially women, are discouraged from seeking health \ncare by the distance to the nearest health facility, the absence of staff in local health facilities, \nand  the  lack  of  qualified  staff  and  ethnic  minority  health  workers.  The  program  supports \nmeasures to address these inequities, particularly through training of health workers from ethnic \nminority communities, and incentives and support for health workers in rural and remote areas.  \n \n46. \naccordance with ADB's Safeguards policy (2009) \n \n                                                 \n14   ADB governance risk assessments conducted in 2009 for education, energy, and transport sectors. \n15   Summary Gender and Ethnic Minority Strategy (Appendix 2). \n16   Ministry of Health. 2007.

These  risks  are  mitigated  by  the  two-tranche  program  loan \ndesign, which will help maintain momentum for the policy reform agenda, enable regular policy \ndialogue, and help MOH leverage support needed to facilitate policy reforms in several areas. \nSubstantial  consultant  assistance  will  contribute  to  sustained  impetus  for  reforms.  The \nincreased  government  budget  for  the  health  sector  is  expected  to  mitigate  the  risks  related  to \ntimely  provision  of  counterpart  funds.  The  benefits  and  impacts  resulting  from  the  sector \ndevelopment  program\u2014through  support \nto  high-quality  policy  processes,  along  with \ninvestments that will support the full realization of policy impacts\u2014are assessed as outweighing \nthe identified risks.17 \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \nThe  government  and  MOH  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  sector \n48. \ndevelopment  program  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement  as  described  in  detail  in  the  project  administration  manual  and  loan documents. \nThe  government  and  MOH  have  also  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the  sector \ndevelopment program, which are set forth in the related legal agreements. \n \n\n \n49. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve  \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  and  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR20,086,000  to  the  Socialist \nRepublic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Health  Human  Resources  Sector  Development \nProgram from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate \nof 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter;
