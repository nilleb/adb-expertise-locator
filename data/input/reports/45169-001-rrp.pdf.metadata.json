The  project  will  improve  connectivity  and  reduce  transport  costs  by  completing \nimprovements to sections of an important national and regional corridor, the Bishkek\u2013Osh road, \nwhich is part of Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Corridor 3. The project \nwill also help strengthen the sustainability of the national road network by improving road safety \nand road assessment management. 3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  a  landlocked,  mountainous  country  with  formidable  geographic \nbarriers that constrain its ability to effectively participate in international trade. Its development \nefforts  are  further  hampered  by  inadequate  physical  infrastructure,  which  is  in  need  of \ninvestment and regular maintenance. Development of the transport sector is very important for \nthe Kyrgyz Republic as this will lower barriers, reduce the cost of doing business, and generate \nemployment in the region. \n \nThe  capital,  Bishkek,  is  the  country\u2019s  political  and  economic  hub  with  a  population  of \n4. \nabout 1 million. The second largest city after Bishkek is Osh (population 250,000), located in the \nFergana valley in the south, the country\u2019s major agricultural area. The gross domestic product of \nthese two cities accounts for nearly half of the country\u2019s total. The Bishkek\u2013Osh road connects \nthe  two  regional  economic  and  population  centers,  and  in  a  regional  context  forms  part  of \nCAREC  Corridor  3,  which  runs  from  west  and  south  of  the  Siberian  region  of  the  Russian \nFederation  through  Afghanistan,  Kazakhstan,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan, \nand  Uzbekistan  to  the  Middle  East  and  South  Asia.4 In  the  national  context,  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh \nroad  represents  about  one-third  of  the  core  international  road  corridor  network  in  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic,  and  links  the  country  to  Kazakhstan  in  the  north,  Tajikistan  and  Uzbekistan  in  the \nsouth,  and  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  in  the  southeast.  It  crosses  four  of  the  country\u2019s \nseven provinces and serves at least 4 million people. It is the only direct land link between the \nsouthern  and  northern  parts  of  the  country,  making  it  crucial  for  maintaining  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic\u2019s social, political, and economic integrity.  \n \n5. \nThe  complete  rehabilitation  of  the  Bishkek-Osh  road  will  contribute  to  expanding  trade \nand  increasing  competitiveness  among  the  CAREC  economies  and  the  rest  of  the  world.  The \nproject road also passes through some of the poorest oblasts (districts) in the country with the \ngreatest need for improved connectivity for the population to access goods and services and so \n\n                                                 \n1  CAREC is a proactive facilitator of project-based cooperation in transport, trade, energy, and other key sectors of \nmutual  interest.  It  is  a  partnership  of  10  countries  and  six  multilateral  institutions  working  together  to  promote \ndevelopment through regional cooperation, leading to accelerated growth and poverty reduction. \n\n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.

Two such oblasts are Osh and Jalal-Abad, both of which have urban \nand rural poverty rates of more than 40%.5 By improving the key corridor in the Kyrgyz Republic, \nthe poorest regions in the country will have improved access to regional and domestic economic \nactivities. Improving the road network, especially to connect rural populations to urban centers \nfor  access  to  services  and  trade  in  domestic  and  regional  markets,  is  critical  for  inclusive \neconomic growth and social development.  \n \n6. \nADB  has  assisted  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  in  rehabilitating  320  kilometers  (km)  of  the \n655 km Bishkek\u2013Osh road in three phases.6  All three projects were rated successful and highly \nrelevant in the performance evaluation report by ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department in \n2010.7 Other  development  partners,  such  as  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  and \nthe  Islamic  Development  Bank,  also  recognize  the  importance  of  this  road.  Overall, \ndevelopment  partners  have  assisted  the  government  in  rehabilitating  more  than  539  km  \n(about 82%) of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road.8 However, because of funding limitations, there are still \ntwo  sections  that  need  urgent  attention:  Bishkek  to  Kara-Balta  and  Madaniyat  to  Jalal-Abad. \nThese  two  sections  are  in  very  poor  condition,  with  an  international  roughness  index  above  7 \nand  truck  and  bus  average  travel  speed  of  less  than  50  kilometers  per  hour  (km/h),  and  are \nunable  to  provide  the  required  level  of  service. 9 They  pose  traffic  hazards  to  road  users  and \npedestrian traffic.10 In addition to connecting the poorest population needing access to services, \ngoods, and markets and enhancing regional connectivity, upgrading the Bishkek\u2013Osh road will \nimprove safety for all road users.11  \n \n7. \nThe  project  will  improve  national  and  regional  connectivity  by  reconstructing  and \nrehabilitating an estimated 120 km of crucial road sections between Bishkek and Osh, and will \ninclude road safety measures such as road signs, lane markings, street lighting, parking areas, \nbus  stops,  crash  barriers,  and  sidewalks.  The  project  is  fully  consistent  with  the  government\u2019s \npriority  of  upgrading  key  corridors  as  stated  in  the  National  Strategy  of  Sustainable \nDevelopment,  2013\u20132017.12 The  project  is  also  well  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  202013 and \nwith  the  country  partnership  strategy,  2013\u20132017,  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  (footnote  5).  \nThe priority theme for the country partnership strategy is the development of a successful and \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2013.

In  the \nBishkek\u2013Kara-Balta  section,  the  2013  average  annual  daily  traffic  between  Km  9  and  Km  17  near  the  Bishkek \nbypass junction is 42,000 vehicles, and between Km 17 and Km 29 near Sokuluk town is 48,600 vehicles. \n\n10 A sample pedestrian count was carried out on a typical weekday (Thursday, 20 June 2013) at Km 25.5 near the \nmarket  area  of  Sokuluk.  From  12  p.m.  to  2  p.m.,  4,064  pedestrians  were  counted  on  the  sidewalk  and  1,881 \npedestrians were counted at the crossing. From 5 p.m. to 7 p.m., 1,561 pedestrians were counted on the sidewalk \nand 1,052 pedestrians were counted at the crossing. Based on a conservative estimate, this section of the road, on \na typical weekday, would have at least an estimated 10,000 pedestrians passing by it. \n\n11 Sector Assessment (Summary): Transport, and Information and Communication Technology (accessible from the \n\nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n12 Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2013.

The outcome will be improved efficiency and safer movement of goods and people \non the Bishkek\u2013Osh road.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe outputs to be financed by ADB and the government are as follows: \n\nto  Kara-Balta \n\nfrom  Bishkek \n\nReconstructed  road \ntotaling  52.5  km  \n(Km 8.5\u2013Km 61.0). This includes 43.5 km of the road section to be upgraded to \nfour  lanes  and  9.0  km  to  six  lanes. 14  Reconstruction  of  six  bridges  and \nrehabilitation of one bridge 6\u201324 meters long are also included. \n \nStrengthened  institutional  capacity.  This  component  comprises (a)  a 100-km \nperformance-based maintenance (PBM) pilot contract, covering the section from \nKara-Balta  to  Km  161,  and  knowledge  building  and  sharing  relating  to  PBM;  \n(b)  a  road  safety  audit  and  awareness  program;  and  (c)  consulting  services  for \nengineering,  supervision,  and  project  management,  including  climate  change \nadaptation assessment and independent external resettlement monitoring.     \n\n \n10. \nIn  addition,  67  km  of  the  road  section  from  Madaniyat  to  Jalal-Abad  (Km  507.5\u2013 \nKm  574.5)  will  be  rehabilitated  to  international  and  state  highway  category  2.15 This  is  to  be \nfinanced by the Eurasian Development Bank (EDB) and the government.16 \n \nD. \n \n11. \nThe project is estimated to cost approximately $191.8 million, including taxes and duties, \nto be financed by ADB, the EDB, and the government. The project investment plan is in Table 1. \n \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\n                                                 \n14 Based on the Kyrgyz Republic road design standards, Km 8.5\u2013Km 16.0 and Km 21\u2013Km 60 will be considered as \ntraffic regulated highways according to urban road standards (design speed of 80 km/h and 4\u20136 3.5-meter traffic \nlanes),  whereas  Km  16\u2013Km  21  section  is  located  outside  settled  areas  and  should  be  categorized  as  an \ninternational and state highway of category 1-b (design speed of 120 km/h and four 3.75-meter traffic lanes).  \n\n15 As defined in the Kyrgyz Republic road design standards, the section will have a design speed of 100 km/h and two \n\n3.75-meter traffic lanes.  \n\n16 A  framework  cofinancing  agreement  was  signed  between  ADB  and  the  EDB  on  6  May  2013.  The  agreement \ndetails  the  institutional  partnership  through  a  programmatic  cofinancing  approach  by  establishing  operational \narrangements for planning and coordination. As part of the government's larger program for the Bishkek\u2013Osh road, \nit is expected that the EDB will concurrently provide a loan of $60 million equivalent to cofinance rehabilitation of  \n67 km of road from Madaniyat to Jalal-Abad (Km 507.5\u2013Km 574.5). In connection with such planned financing, on \n4  June  2013,  ADB  and  the  EDB  signed  a  memorandum  of  understanding  on  collaborative  cofinancing, \nsummarizing the design, scope, components, and financing of the respective sections to be financed by ADB and \nthe EDB.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nTable 1: Investment Plan  \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA.  \n \n \n\nBase Costa \n1.

The proposed financing plan is summarized in Table 2.18 \n\n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \n  Special Funds resources (grant) \n  Special Funds resources (loan) \nEurasian Development Bank \nGovernment of the Kyrgyz Republic \n\nTotal \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n \nE. \n\nAmount  \n($ million) \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n\n \n35.0 \n65.0 \n 60.0 \n  31.8 \n191.8 \n\n \n18 \n34 \n31 \n17 \n100 \n\n15. \nThe  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications  (MOTC)  will  be  the  executing  agency.  \nIt  has  implemented  all  development-partner-financed  road  projects  since  1995,  and  has \naccumulated  considerable  experience.  The  Investment  Projects  Implementation  Group  in  the \nMOTC will be the project implementation unit responsible for project implementation activities. 19   \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  is  requesting  ADB\u2019s  consideration  in  procuring  bitumen  from \n16. \nnon-ADB  members.  Because  of  the  location  of  the  project,  countries  that  are  non-ADB \nmembers  could  provide  better-quality  materials  at  more  competitive  prices.  Due  to  climate \nconditions  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  bitumen  required  for  construction  has  to  be  able  to  endure \nextreme weather. Bitumen from neighboring ADB members often cannot meet this requirement. \nAllowing bitumen to be procured from non-ADB members will result in time and cost savings in \nthe  civil  works. 20   Therefore,  to  enable  the  government  to  source  from  the  least-expensive \nproducers,  and  thereby  maximize  the  project\u2019s  development  impact,  economic  efficiency  and \nquality assurance, it is proposed that bitumen procured from non-member countries of ADB be \neligible for financing for use in the ADB-financed section. \n \n17. \nsummarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the project administration manual.21   \n \n \n\nThe  implementation  arrangements  for  ADB  financed  and  administered  outputs  are \n\n \n\n                                                 \n18 Detailed  cost  estimates  by  ADB  and  the  government  can  be  found  in  Section  IV  of  the  project  administration \n\nmanual. \n\n19 The  Investment  Projects  Implementation  Group  is  funded  by  multiple  development  partners  such  as  ADB,  \nthe  World  Bank,  and  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development.  For  the  implementation  of  the  \nEDB-financed section, if additional staffing is required, EDB will discuss with MOTC to make further arrangements \nwhen necessary. \n\n20 An estimated $1.8 million will be saved by procuring bitumen from non-ADB member countries.  \n21 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangementsa \nAspects  \nImplementation period \nFebruary 2014\u2013October 2019  \nEstimated completion date  30 October 2019 (loan and grant closing date: 30 April 2020) \nManagement \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)   Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n \nConsulting services \n\nAdvance contracting \n\nDisbursement \n\nMinistry of Finance, deputy minister (chair); head of Public Investment Program, \nTechnical Assistance, and Foreign Aid Department (member); head of Investment \nProjects Implementation Group (member) \nMinistry of Transport and Communications \nInvestment  Projects Implementation  Group,  Bishkek,  29 staff  (20 more  to be  recruited \nby 2015)  \nInternational \ncompetitive bidding \nQuality- and cost-\nbased selection \n\n$75.5 millionb \n$5.0 millionb \n$4.2 millionb   \n \n$0.1 millionb \nLeast-cost selection \n$0.1 millionb \nIndividual \n$1.3 millionb \nconsultants  \nEngineering and supervision consulting services.

International \nstandards  are  applied  partly  to  improve  any  shortcomings  in  the  national  standards  so  as  to \nallow  for  a  more  flexible  approach  in  defining  suitable  solutions  at  individual  locations.  \nThe construction method will utilize proven technology with standard materials compatible with \nlocal conditions. Under the ADB-financed portion of the project, 9 km of the Bishkek\u2013Kara-Balta \nroad  will  be  reconstructed,  climate  proofed,  and  upgraded  to  six  lanes,  and  the  remaining  \n43.5  km  will  be  upgraded  to  four  lanes  with  asphalt  pavement.  For  the  EDB-financed  portion,  \nthe existing two-lane Madaniyat\u2013Jalal-Abad section will be rehabilitated with asphalt pavement. \nImprovement  of  road  safety  signs,  pavement  markings,  light  and  signal  systems,  and  street \nfurniture are considered to enhance road safety. The two sections will follow existing alignments \nand  mitigate  accident  black  spots  to  comply  with  national  geometric  design  standards.  \nFeasible  adaptation  measures  will  be \nthe  engineering  design,  \nthe  management  contract,  and  road  safety  measures  to  reduce  disruption  resulting  from \nclimate-induced events. Civil works will be strengthened on existing road pavements to improve \nroad capacity and to meet current and forecast traffic demand. \n \nAnalysis was also carried out on 10 feeder roads along the two sections as part of the \n19. \nfeasibility  study  to  be  considered  for  financing.  Technical,  economic,  social,  and  safeguard \n\nincorporated \n\ninto \n\n \n\n \n\n\fanalyses  were  conducted. 22 However,  because  of  limited  funding,  the  feeder  roads  are  not \nincluded in the project financing at this stage. During implementation, if there are project savings \nor additional financing, these feeder roads will be considered and selection of the feeder roads \nwill be based on the findings of the feasibility study.23  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n20. \nThe  project  will  contribute  to  lower  transport  costs, higher travel  speeds, and  improved \nroad  safety  standards  for  international  and  national  traffic  on  CAREC  Transport  Corridor  3.  \nThe  economic  evaluation  of  the  project  was  undertaken  using  the  Highway  Development  and \nManagement  Model 24  following  ADB's  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects. 25  \nThe economic analysis compares the with- and without-project scenarios. The current pavement \ncondition was determined by engineering surveys. Values for vehicle operating costs and travel \ntime  were  estimated  by  updating  recently  completed  studies,  while  maintenance  costs  were \nbased  on  the  MOTC\u2019s  actual  expenditures  on  the  project  sections.  Construction  costs  were \ndetermined by road section based on engineering estimates and traffic forecasts. The economic \ncosts are capital costs, including physical contingencies but excluding taxes, and operation and \nmaintenance costs. The economic benefits are savings in vehicle operating costs resulting from \nthe  improved  project  road,  and  time  savings.  Historical  traffic  data  were  supplemented  by \nadditional traffic counts and origin\u2013destination surveys to derive a base 2013 traffic estimate for \nindividual  sections  of  the  project  roads  and  each  of  the  feeder  roads.  The  rate  of  growth  in \ndemand for travel was set at 3.3% based on the growth in the last 2 years. The road sections \ncomprise  only  a  small  part  of  some journeys,  but there  is  also  local traffic for  which  the  entire \njourney is within the project road sections.  \n \n21. \nThe  project  is  economically  viable  with  an  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return \n(EIRR)  of  26%  for  both  sections  combined.  The  estimated  EIRR  for  the  Bishkek\u2013Kara-Balta \nsection to be financed by ADB is 27% and the estimated EIRR for the Madaniyat and Jalal-Abad \nsection to be financed by the EDB is 24%. The high EIRR reflects the poor state of the roads \nand high traffic volumes. Sensitivity tests confirmed that the project would remain viable even if \nthe envisaged project costs increase, or benefits decrease.26 \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n22. \nThe  Investment  Projects  Implementation  Group  has  been  implementing  ADB-funded \nprojects since 1996, and has delivered more than 10 ADB road projects amounting to more than \n$300  million.  The  staff  has  adequate  knowledge,  understanding,  and  experience  with  ADB \nprocedures  to  manage  the  project.  The  implementation  group  has  satisfactory  capacity  for \nproject  financial  accounting  and  a  proven  track  record  in  ADB\u2019s  disbursement  procedures. \nUnder  the  ADB-financed  scope,  goods  and  works  will  be  procured  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  civil  works  will  be  procured \nthrough  international  competitive  bidding,  and  consulting  firms  will  be  recruited  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) using \nquality- and cost-based selection, with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10.  \n \n\n                                                 \n22 Since feeder  roads  were  considered  during the  feasibility  study  stage,  an environmental assessment  and  review \n\nframework and a land acquisition and resettlement framework were prepared.  \n\n23  Feeder Road Selection Summary (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 World Road Association. 2002.

The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare  described \nthe  \nADB-financed  scope,  bidding  documents  for  the  civil  works  contract  will  include  provisions \nspecifying  ADB\u2019s  right  to  audit  all  project  records  and  accounts,  as  well  as  those  of  all \ncontractors,  suppliers,  and  other  service  providers  involved.  Key  measures  to  ensure  proper \ngovernance  are  (i)  independent  external  auditing  of  contracts,  project  accounts,  and  financial \nfor  all  procurement  matters;  and  \nstatements; \n(iii)  verification  of  contractors\u2019  payment  claims  by  the  supervising  consultant  and  oversight  by \nthe project implementation unit.27 \n \nD. \n\ntransparent  decision  processes \n\n(footnote  21).  Under \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n(ii) \n\n24. \nThe project will contribute to poverty reduction by stimulating economic activities through \nimproved  transport  of  goods  and  people  and  access  to  services.  It  will  also  benefit  local \nresidents and enterprises by creating jobs during construction and reducing transport costs and \ntravel time. Social and poverty assessments are shown in the summary poverty reduction and \nsocial  strategy. 28  The  project  is  classified  as  general  intervention,  with  no  direct  poverty \nreduction  component.  It  will  benefit  poor  people  in  the  project  area  by  improving  transport \nconditions for better access to social services.  \n \n25. \nAlthough there will be substantial demand for employment opportunities arising from this \nproject,  there  will  be  careful  monitoring  throughout  implementation  to  ensure  that  core  labor \nstandards are respected. The civil works contract will require that contractors (i) comply with the \nKyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  applicable  labor  laws  and  related  international  treaty  obligations,  and  not \nemploy child labor; (ii) provide safe working conditions and separate sanitation facilities for male \nand  female  workers;  (iii)  provide  equal  wages  to  male  and  female  workers  for  work  of  equal \nvalue;  (iv)  provide  employment  opportunities  for  women;  (v)  carry  out  road  safety,  HIV/AIDS, \nillicit  drugs,  and  human trafficking  prevention  and  awareness  programs  in  workers\u2019  campsites; \nand (vi) construct toilets along the project road.  \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n26. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009), MOTC submitted an initial environmental examination report including an environmental \nmanagement plan for the ADB-financed Bishkek\u2013Kara-Balta road section, which ADB disclosed \non  its  website  on  14  August  2013.  29 Public  consultation  was  held  on  10\u201313  June  2013. 30 \nImpacts  from  the  project  are  expected  to  be  limited  in  magnitude,  of  a  short-term  nature,  and \nmostly  related  to  construction  work,  and  can  be  mitigated.  The  identified  impacts  include  \n(i)  noise,  dust,  vehicle  emission,  and  vibration,  which  are  especially  significant  within  the \n\n                                                 \n27 Details are in Section V of the project administration manual (footnote 23). \n28 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n30 For  the  road  section  between  Madaniyat  and  Jalal-Abad  (Km  507.5\u2013Km  574.5)  to  be  financed  by  the  EDB,  \nthe  process  for  social  and  environmental  assessment  and  planning,  safeguard  documentation,  consultation,  \nand  disclosure  requirements  was  conducted  to  satisfy  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  Initial  environmental \nexamination  report  and  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  for  the  EDB-financed  road  section  were  prepared \nand  disclosed.  The  EDB  confirms  that  the  social  and  environmental  assessment  and  planning,  safeguard \ndocumentation consultations, and disclosure during rehabilitation of the road section between Madaniyat and Jalal-\nAbad  shall  be  undertaken  to  the  EDB\u2019s  satisfaction.  During  implementation,  the  EDB  shall  be  responsible  for  \n(i)  ensuring  that  activities  carried  out  in  connection  with  its  financed  section  comply  with  applicable  safeguard \nrequirements, and (ii) resolving any complaints in relation to such section only.  \n\n \n\n\f(LARP) \n\nsettlements  along  the  project  road  and  where  sensitive  receptors  such  as  schools,  hospitals, \nand mosques are located; (ii) impacts on water courses and rivers due to bridge rehabilitation; \n(iii)  impacts  from  material  transport  from  borrow  sites;  (iv)  impacts  of  tree  cutting  along  the \nproject  road  due  to  site  clearance  activities;  (v)  impacts  from  asphalt  plant  and  aggregate \ncrushers;  and  (vi)  impacts  from  contractors\u2019  working  camps.  Impacts  have  been  divided  into \ndesign  phase,  construction  phase,  and  operation  phase.  The  cost  for  implementing  the \nenvironmental management plan will be financed by the loan and grant. Specifically, the costs \nof  mitigation  measures  will  be  included  in  the  construction  contracts,  and  the  cost  of \nenvironmental  monitoring  will  be  included  in  the  consulting  services  of  the  engineering  and \nsupervision  consultants.  Support  to  the  Investment  Projects  Implementation  Group  in  building \ncapacity in environmental management is not included in the environmental management plan \nbecause the implementation group is managing several transport projects under which capacity \nbuilding assistance has been provided. \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  MOTC  prepared  a  land  acquisition  and \n27. \nresettlement  plan \nthe  ADB-financed  Bishkek\u2013Kara-Balta  section  where \ncompensation  for  land,  structures,  and  business  interruption  are  detailed.31 Civil  works  under \nthe  project  will  entail  mostly  temporary  involuntary  resettlement.  Based  on  the  available \npreliminary  design,  the  Bishkek\u2013Kara-Balta  section  will  entail  impacts  on  (i)  two  houses  with \napproximately 10 persons that will be severely affected; (ii) 38 shops, cafes, or kiosks that will \nexperience  temporary  business  interruption  as  these  are  mostly  nontitled  and  will  be  moved \nback out of the existing right of way; (iii) two petrol stations, whose partial structures are within \nthe  existing  right  of  way;  (iv) a  government  structure  and  a  shed;  and  (v)  58  secondary \nstructures  (concrete  fences,  gates,  stone  paving,  etc.). 32  The  LARP  was  disclosed  to  the \naffected people through a series of public consultations and was posted on the ADB website on \n15 August 2013. MOTC will be responsible for meeting ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements, including \nmonitoring of LARP implementation. Safeguard staff in the Investment Projects Implementation \nGroup  has  sufficient  capacity  to  implement  and monitor  the  LARPs.  ADB  will  provide  MOTC\u2019s \nsafeguard staff with further training through technical assistance.33   \n \n28. \nIndigenous peoples (category C).  The  project  affects  neither  indigenous  peoples  nor \nvulnerable  groups.  General  positive  economic  and  social  impacts  are  expected  in  areas \ntraversed by the road sections.  \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nfor \n\nThe  project  risks  are  considered  manageable  through  the  prescribed  mitigating \n29. \nmeasures.  Major  project  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and \ndescribed in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.34  \n \n\n                                                 \n31 Resettlement  Plan:  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement  Plan  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n32 The  LARP  for  the  EDB-financed  Madaniyat\u2013Jalal-Abad  road  section  identifies  impacts  on  (i)  four  houses  with \napproximately  20  persons  that  will  be  severely  impacted;  (ii)  12  shops,  cafes,  or  kiosks  that  will  experience \ntemporary  business  interruption  as  these are mostly  nontitled  and  will  be moved  out of  the  existing  right  of  way; \nand (iii) 103 secondary structures (metal shade, gates, fences, etc.).
