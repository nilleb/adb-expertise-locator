No  negative  environmental  impact  from  the  Project  is \nforeseen. \n \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProject Description  The  Project  affirms  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  promote  the \ninclusive socioeconomic development of the most disadvantaged groups, \nparticularly  ethnic  minorities  and  girls,  in  103  of  the  poorest  districts  in \nViet Nam, through universal lower secondary education.  \n \nThe Project will improve access to more equitable learning opportunities \nfor  disadvantaged  groups  and  will  strengthen  social  and  economic \ninclusion through universal secondary education. Specifically, the Project \nwill  (i)  improve  access  to  lower  secondary  education,  (ii)  enhance  the \nquality and relevance of secondary education, (iii) pilot-test and evaluate \ninnovative  approaches  to  give  disadvantaged  groups  better  access  to \neducation,  and  (iv)  strengthen  capacity  to  plan  and  manage  targeted \nsupport for ethnic minorities and girls. \n \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  net  enrollment  rate  in  lower  secondary \neducation in the 103 target districts from 76.4% in 2005 to 85% in 2013. \nIt  will  achieve  this  improvement  by  (i)  building  schools,  classrooms, \nsemi-boarding \nremote  areas; \n(ii) providing  in-service  and  pre-service  teacher  training  to  meet  the \nneeds of ethnic minorities and girls; (iii) developing instructional materials \nincluding  bilingual  materials  in  the  Vietnamese  and  ethnic  minority \nlanguages, and materials for information and communication technology \ntraining  and  on  the  ethnic  minority  education  management  system; \n(iv) providing  targeted  scholarships;  and  (v)  pilot-testing  innovative \ninitiatives  including  school  feeding  programs  and  awareness-raising \nprograms  to  promote  secondary  education  among  the  hardest-to-reach \ngroups.  \n \nViet  Nam  has  enjoyed  remarkable  economic  growth  accompanied  by \nsignificant  reduction  in  poverty  over  the  past  decade.  But  disparities \nremain. The locus of poverty has shifted: formerly widespread throughout \nthe  population,  poverty  afflicts  particularly  vulnerable  groups  that  are \nharder  to  reach.  The  Government,  as  stated  in  its  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment  Plan  2006\u20132010, \ninclusive \ndevelopment  of  the  disadvantaged  groups  through  more  equitable \ndelivery of social services and more equitable economic growth. \n \n\n \nRationale \n\nteacher  housing \n\nfacilities,  and \n\nis  committed \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nin \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and \nOutcome \n\n \nProject  Investment \nPlan  \n \nFinancing Plan \n\nImprovements \n\nEthnic  minorities,  about  14%  of \nthe  population,  are  particularly \ndisadvantaged.  In  2004,  ethnic  minorities  composed  39%  of  all  those \nliving  in  poverty,  and  61%  of  all  ethnic  minorities  were  poor.  While  the \ncountry  has  made  solid  progress  toward  achieving  the  Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals,  ethnic  minorities  score  lower  on  most  social \nindicators. The low level of human capital among minorities due to lack \nof basic education is a critical challenge.  \n \nThe  Secondary  Education  Sector  Master  Plan  (SESMP)  2006\u20132010, \nidentifies  constraints  on  the  education  of  ethnic  minorities  and  girls  in \nViet  Nam  in  three  key  areas:  (i)  access  and  equity,  (ii)  quality  and \nrelevance,  and  (iii)  efficiency  and  sustainability. \nin \nparticipation  rates  are  hampered  by  (i)  physical  distance  to  schools, \n(ii) unaffordable direct and indirect costs of secondary education, (iii) lack \nof proficiency in the Vietnamese language, (iv) lack of public awareness \nof  the  value  of  schooling,  (v)  poor  quality  of  teaching,  (vi)  high  dropout \nand repetition rates, and (vii) limited capacity to plan targeted support for \ndisadvantaged groups. \n \nTo  tackle  these  challenges,  SESMP  2006\u20132010  proposes  a  national \naction plan for providing targeted assistance to disadvantaged groups by \n(i) building  more  boarding  schools  and  training  more  ethnic  minority \nteachers, \nincrease \nopportunities in secondary and higher education in disadvantaged areas, \n(iii)  creating  the  conditions  for  minority  students  to  learn  and  become \nfluent  in  Vietnamese  along  with  their  own  languages,  (iv)  prioritizing \ntraining  for  minority  teachers  and  teachers  with  knowledge  of  minority \nlanguages,  and  (v)  giving  specific  incentives  and  support  to  girls  in \nremote  areas.  The  Project  is  the  first  investment  that  directly  supports \nthis action plan. \n  \nThe Project is expected to promote universal secondary education and, \nhence,  greater  social  and  economic \nfor  Viet  Nam\u2019s \ndisadvantaged  groups.  Its  outcome  will  be  improved  lower  secondary \neducation participation rates, particularly for girls and ethnic minorities, in \n103 of the most disadvantaged districts in 17 provinces. \n \nThe investment cost of the project is estimated at $64 million equivalent, \nincluding taxes and duties. \n \n\nflexible  scholarship  programs \n\n(ii)  offering \n\ninclusion \n\nto \n\nFinancing Plan \n \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment of Viet Nam \nCentral Government \nProvincial Government \n\nTotal \n($ million) \n50.00 \n \n9.90 \n4.10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n% \n78.1\n\n15.5\n6.4\n\n100.0\n\n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n64.00 \n\n\f \n30 June 2014 \n\n \nPeriod of \nUtilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n \n \n \n\nthe  Executing  Agency \n\nimplementation  unit \n\n \n\nADB will provide a loan of SDR31,860,000 ($50 million equivalent) from \nits  Special  Funds  resources  to  cover  78.1%  of  the  cost.

The direct benefits to the \nsector  will  accrue  from  (i)  significantly  narrower  gaps  in  access  to \nsecondary  schooling  between  ethnic,  gender,  and  socioeconomic \ngroups;  (ii) teaching  and  learning  that  is  more  relevant  and  more \nresponsive  to  local  demands;  and  (iii)  stronger  capacity  of  local \neducation authorities to plan, manage, and deliver education services. \n \nKey  social  benefits  will  include  (i)  better  awareness  of  the  benefits  of \nlower  secondary  schooling  among  minority  commune  leaders  and \nparents; (ii) improved participation of girls in lower secondary education; \n(iii)  more  ethnic  minority  youth  able  to  find  nonfarm  employment, \nresulting in higher average household incomes; (iv) more ethnic minority \nteachers,  particularly  women,  serving  as  role  models  for  ethnic  minority \nstudents;  (v) a  stable  supply  of  qualified  teachers  to  remote  minority \nschools  to  help  preserve  minority  languages  and  culture;  and  (vi) \ncontinuing education opportunities for out-of-school youth. \n \nProject  risks  could  come  from  (i)  low  demand  for  secondary  education \namong  the  hardest-to-reach  groups,  (ii)  high  teacher  turnover,  (iii)  low \nfinancial sustainability in the medium term, and (iv) resettlement.  \n \nA  key  assumption  is  that  all  civil  works  will  be  done  on  existing  school \ngrounds  or  on  government-owned  land,  and  that  no  land  acquisition  or \nresettlement  will  be  necessary.  To  mitigate  the  risk,  a  resettlement \nframework has been developed in accordance with Government Decree \nNo.  197/2004/ND-CP  (2004)  regarding  compensation,  assistance  and \nresettlement where land is recovered by the state and ADB\u2019s Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995). \n \nOne  of  the  risks  of  an  education  project  that  strives  to  reach  the  most \nexcluded students with new school buildings and physical facilities is that \ndemand for education will remain low. To mitigate this risk, the Project is \ndesigned to balance interventions on the supply side\u2014new classrooms, \ntraining for teaching staff, etc.\u2014with activities on the demand side such \nas  scholarships,  school  feeding  programs,  and  community  awareness \nactivities.  In  remote  schools  in  the  poorest  areas,  where  teacher \nretention rates are low, the Project attempts to deal with one of the main \nreasons why teachers leave, namely, poor-quality teacher housing. \n \nA drop in the recurrent budget allocations for operation and maintenance \nand teachers\u2019 salaries is a medium-term risk, in view of the revenue-poor \ndistricts  and  disadvantaged  students  targeted  by  the  Project.  However, \nanalysis indicates the Government\u2019s sustained commitment to education \nin  budgetary  allocation.  In  2006,  20%  of  public  expenditure  went  to \neducation.  While  the  sector  will  most  likely  continue  to  be  a  priority  for \nthe  Government,  as  set  out  in  SEDP  2006\u20132010,  special  assistance \nprograms  for  targeted  districts  and  disadvantaged  students  should  hold \nfirm for the targets related to universal lower secondary education to be \nachieved and project investments to be sustainable. \n\n\f \n\ni \n\n \n\n\f1 \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Lower  Secondary  Education  for  the  Most \nDisadvantaged Regions Project.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nIndicators and Analysis of Performance \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nViet Nam has enjoyed remarkable economic growth accompanied by significant income \npoverty reduction over the past decade. Gross domestic product per capita increased from $288 \nin 1993 to $622 in 2004. The incidence of income poverty fell from 58% in 1993 to 23% in 2004 \nas  broad-based  reforms  after  doi  moi  (renewal)  led  to  vigorous  growth  with  diversified \nemployment opportunities, greater macroeconomic and political stability, and targeted programs \nto provide basic public infrastructure and services. With this overwhelmingly positive transition, \nhowever, has come socioeconomic polarization. From being widespread throughout the general \npopulation, poverty has become concentrated among specific vulnerable groups that are much \nharder to reach. The incidence of poverty is 18% nationwide and only 14% in urban areas, but it \nis a much higher 26% in rural areas. Regional disparities are striking: the incidence of poverty in \nthe Northwest region was 52% in 2004, compared with just 6% in the Southeast region. Poverty \nlevels  in  the  Northeast  (29%)  and  Central  Highlands  (33%)  regions  were  also  well  above  the \nnational average.1 \n \n3. \nEthnic  minorities\u201412  million  in  all,  or  about  14%  of  the  population  of  Viet  Nam\u2014are \nparticularly  vulnerable  to  poverty.  Ethno-linguistically,  they  represent  a  diverse  range  of \n53 minorities  that  live  mostly  in  the  remote  mountainous  areas  and  lowland  river  deltas.  The \npoorest  areas  of  Viet  Nam  tend  to  have  a  high  concentration  of  ethnic  minorities.  In  2004, \nminorities  composed  39%  of  the  population  living  in  poverty,  and  61%  of  all  ethnic  minority \npeople were poor (as opposed to only 14% of the majority Kinh and Chinese).2 The proportion \nof ethnic minorities in the poor population has nearly doubled in 11 years. If these trends persist, \nby 2010 poverty will be overwhelmingly an issue of ethnicity.3 \n \nPoverty  among  minority  groups  is  closely  associated  with  low  or  limited  access  to \n4. \neducation  and  training  opportunities.  The  main  reasons  are  lack  of  infrastructure,  physical \ndistance,  language  and  cultural  barriers,  the  small  number  and  poor  quality  of  teachers, \nunsuitability  of  the  curriculum  to  local  needs,  low  investment  in  education  because  of  the \nperceived  low  returns,  and  high  opportunity  costs.  Enrollment  and  completion  rates  for \nminorities  are  generally  below  the  average,  and  for  minority  girls  they  are  even  lower.  In  the \n2005 school year, girls made up 48% of lower secondary students nationwide. In the Northwest, \nwhere 82% of lower secondary students come from minorities, less than 44% of these students \nare girls. Dropout rates tend to be higher for minorities. In 2004\u20132005, the dropout rate for the \nMekong River Delta region was 13%, almost twice the national average of 7%. \n \n5. \nThe  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  2006\u20132010.  The  Government  prepared  the \n5-year  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  (SEDP)  2006\u20132010  to  promote  inclusive  social \ndevelopment  and  sustained  economic  growth.  SEDP  2006\u20132010  underscores \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s  commitment  to  14  major  economic,  social,  and  environmental  policy  targets, \n\n                                                 \n1   Government of Viet Nam. 2005.

Explaining Ethnic Minority Poverty in Vietnam: A Summary of Recent Trends \nand  Current  Challenges.  Hanoi.  Draft  background  paper  for  the  Committee  for  Ethnic  Minorities/Ministry  of \nPlanning and Investment Meeting on Ethnic Minority Poverty, September 2006. \n\n\f2 \n\nthe  equitable  delivery  of  social  services \n\nincluding (i) a slower population growth rate of 1.14%, (ii) reduced poverty, (iii) universal lower \nsecondary education (LSE),4 (iv) a contraction in the agricultural labor force to 50% of the total, \n(v)  job  creation  and  a  stable  unemployment  rate,  and  (vi)  less  malnutrition.  Key  features  of \nSEDP 2006\u20132010  are  an  emphasis  on \nto \ndisadvantaged groups, and a strong results orientation with performance indicators including the \nMillennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  and  the  localized  but  in  many  ways  more  ambitious \nViet Nam development goals (VDGs).  \n \n6. \nIn  the  social  sectors,  SEDP  2006\u20132010  accords  priority  to  the  further  development  of \neducation  and  training.  The  MDGs  and  VDGs  include  the  following  education  targets: \n(i) universal  primary  education  by  2015,  (ii)  universal  progression  to  grade  5  by  2015, \n(iii) universal youth (aged 15\u201324) literacy by 2015, (iv) gender parity in basic education by 2005, \n(v) gender parity in youth literacy, and (vi) preservation of the ability to read and write in ethnic \nminority  languages.  SEDP  2006\u20132010  notes  the  positive  performance  of  the  education  sector \nbut  also  significant  constraints  such  as  the  lower  enrollment  and  poor  quality  of  secondary \neducation  in  remote  areas,  an  outmoded  and  ineffective  training  system,  and  an  inadequate \nframework for regulating private educational institutions and the quality of services they provide. \nSEDP 2006\u20132010 points out as well the limited learning opportunities for ethnic minorities and \ngirls as a major shortcoming.  \n \n7. \nWhile  the  country  has  made  solid  progress  toward  achieving  the  MDGs  and  VDGs, \nethnic  minority  groups  fare  badly  on  most  social  indicators\u2014hunger  and  poverty,  literacy  and \nenrollment,  maternal  health  care,  gender  equality,  and  access  to  clean  water  and  sanitation. \nThe  low  level  of  human  capital  among  minorities  is  a  critical  challenge.  In  response,  the \nGovernment has issued a decree that specifically directs special assistance programs to the 18 \nsmallest ethnic minority groups.5 \n \nOverview of the Education Sector. In Viet Nam, education is viewed as strongly linked \n8. \nto  economic  growth,  and  a  principal \nlong-term  socioeconomic \ndevelopment. The national education policy rests on the central pillar of rapid human resource \ndevelopment to meet the labor needs of a highly competitive market economy, within a socialist \nframework  to  ensure  a  high  degree  of  equity.  With  the  achievement  of  near-universal  primary \neducation,  the  Government\u2019s  principal  sector  goal  is  now  universal  secondary  education, \ndefined  as  a  net  enrollment  rate  (NER)  of  90%  for  LSE.  The  education  sector  is  analyzed  in \ndetail in Appendix 1. \n \n9. \nGovernment  efforts  so  far  have  significantly  expanded  the  general  coverage  of  LSE\u2013 \nNER was 83% in the 2005\u20132006 school year.6 However, as with the incidence of poverty, the \nnational  average  masks  persistent  disparities  in  the  quality  and  accessibility  of  schooling, \nparticularly between genders and between ethnic communities. The 6% of the population that is \nilliterate mostly belongs to minority groups, and is made up for the most part of women and girls. \nThe 2004 Viet Nam Household Living Standards Survey revealed that less than one third (only \n29%)  of  all  ethnic  minority  adults  (18  years  and  older)  had  completed  LSE.  Many  people \nbelonging  to  minority  groups  are  not  fluent  in  the  Vietnamese  language,  and  this  factor \ncontributes to low school enrollment and high dropout rates, and a general sense of exclusion. \nIn the culturally diverse Northern Mountain region, the Hmong and Dao people rank among the \npoorest,  living  at  higher  elevations  where  access  is  difficult  and  agricultural  productivity  low. \n                                                 \n4   ADB. 2006.

The Hmong have the lowest education participation rates in the \ncountry: in 2002, the gross enrollment rate for Hmong children was less than 10%.7 Enrollment \nrates  for  the  Dao  were  only  slightly  better,  at  20%.  Strategic,  innovative,  and  targeted \nassistance  is  required  to  include  the  most  difficult-to-reach  groups  (e.g.,  ethnic  minorities  and \ngirls in the poorest regions). \n \n10. \nThe national education and training system extends from nursery school to postgraduate \ndoctoral programs, and comprises both formal and nonformal and continuing education. There \nare  four  levels  of  formal  education:  pre-primary,  primary  (grades  1\u20135),  lower  secondary \n(grades 6\u20139),  and  upper  secondary  (grades  10\u201312).  At  the  upper  secondary  level,  students \neither enroll in upper secondary education (USE) and possibly continue to higher education, or \nopt  for  professional  secondary  education  and  vocational  training.  Continuing  education \nprograms cater to students who drop out of school but wish to continue their education in a less \nformal  setting  or  hope  to  qualify  for  re-enrollment  in  formal  education.  These  nationwide \nprograms use a modified curriculum and take place at continuing education centers (CECs) in \nthe provinces and districts. \n \n11. \nThe Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) has overall responsibility for setting the \nbroad  policy  direction  for  all  levels  of  education.  Responsibility  for  managing  school  buildings, \nstaffing,  and  distribution  of  financial  resources  is  progressively  decentralized.  MOET  manages \nthe  universities  directly,  but  has  delegated  the  management  of  upper  secondary  and \nprofessional  secondary  schools  to  the  provincial  departments  of  education  and  training \n(DOETs),  and  lower  secondary  and  primary  schools  to  the  district  bureaus  of  education  and \ntraining  (BOETs).  Education  sector  spending  in  relation  to  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  has \nrisen,  from  3.5%  in  1994  to  4.6%  in  2004.  Compared  with  other  sectors,  education  receives \npriority, its share of public expenditure increasing to 20% in 2006.8 \n \n12. \nThe  Government  passed  a  new  education  law  in  June  2005  to  improve  the  quality  of \neducation and make it more generally accessible. The law outlines the goals and principles of \neducation. In addition, these supporting policy documents guide decision making for the sector: \n(i) the  Education  Strategic  Development  Plan  2001\u20132010,  (iii)  the  National  Action  Plan  for \nEducation for All (NAPEFA) 2003\u20132015, (iii) the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth \nStrategy, and (iv) the Secondary Education Sector Master Plan (SESMP) 2006\u20132010.9  \n \n13. \nThe  Secondary  Education  Sector  Master  Plan  2006\u20132010.  Despite  steadily \nincreasing  enrollment  rates,  MOET  realizes  that  achieving  universal  LSE  requires  a  more \nstrategic  policy  framework  based  on  a  detailed  subsector  review  and  better-harmonized  aid. \nMOET  therefore  developed  the  SESMP  2006\u20132010  in  2006,  with  assistance  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB); the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization \n(UNESCO);  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA);  and  the  United  Nations \nChildren\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF).  SESMP  2006\u20132010,  grounded  in  a  results-based  monitoring \nframework,  comprises  (i)  goals  and  targets  for  secondary  education,  (ii)  a  national  school \nmapping  program,  (iii)  an  action  plan  for  targeted  assistance  to  disadvantaged  groups,  (iv)  a \nprogram of fiscal review of secondary education, and (v) a donor coordination matrix.  \n \n14. \n                                                 \n7  Baulch,  Bob,  Dominique  Haughton,  Jonathan  Haughton  and  Truong  Thi  Kim  Chuyen.  2002.

The high enrollment rate of 83% in lower secondary school is a national \naverage  that  masks  disparities  in  access  and  quality  of  schooling  by  gender,  ethnic,  regional, \nand socioeconomic status. Only 34 out of 64 provinces have achieved universal LSE. In some \nprovinces,  the  disparities  are  widening.  Innovative  and  targeted  assistance  is  needed  to  bring \nthe most difficult-to-reach groups, such as ethnic minorities and girls in the poorest communes, \ninto the education system.  \n \nPhysical distance is the main obstacle to school enrollment and participation, especially \n17. \nin  remote  rural  areas.  In  the  Northern  Mountain  and  Central  Highland  regions,  it  can  take \nstudents the better part of a day to walk to school in very mountainous terrain. In the Mekong \nRiver  Delta,  students  travel  to  school  by  boat  and  on  foot  but  are  often  kept  from  attending \nschool by flooding. Remote areas have limited semi-boarding facilities, where students can stay \nduring  the  week,  but  most  are  severely  inadequate.  The  demand  for  such  facilities  in  minority \nareas  is  high,  despite  their  poor  condition,  and  far  exceeds  the  supply.  In  their  absence, \nstudents resort to staying in private homes, usually in exchange for physical labor or a nominal \nrent.  Both  lower  secondary  schools  (LSSs)  and  CECs  do  not  have  enough  classrooms  to \nabsorb the ethnic minority youth. More schools and CECs and secure semi-boarding facilities in \nrural remote areas will relieve the constraints on access. \n \n18. \nFinancial and Cultural Barriers. Households incur substantial direct and indirect costs \nfor  education,  including  school  fees  and  the  cost  of  textbooks,  materials,  uniforms,  food,  and \ntransportation,  all  of  which  combine  to  hinder  school  enrollment  among  poor  families.  A  large \npart of the opportunity cost of education, which increases at the LSE level, is the loss of child \nlabor from household production. Poor families, for this reason, are held back from investing in \nthe  education  of  their  children,  particularly  daughters,  for  whom  the  opportunity  costs  are \ngreater.  The  contribution  of  the  child  to  the  family  income  may  be  more  important  to  the \nhousehold  in  the  short  term.  Primary  pupils  from  the  poorest  quintile  of  the  population  work \ntwice  as  long  as  students  from  the  richest  quintile,  and  female  students  work  20\u201350%  longer \nhours  than  males  across  all  income  quintiles  and  ethnic  groups.  There  is  a  need  for  more \nfocused  measurements  of  the  financial  burden  of  direct  education  costs  on  poor  families  and \ninnovative awareness-raising programs to promote the longer-term benefits of investing in their \nchildren\u2019s secondary education. \n \n                                                 \n10  ADB.  2006.  Action  Plan  for  the  Targeted  Assistance  to  the  Disadvantaged  Groups.  Appendix  4  of  Secondary \n\nEducation Sector Master Plan 2006\u20132010. Manila. \n\n\f19. \nLanguage  Barriers.  Lack  of  fluency  in  the  Vietnamese  language  also  limits  the \nparticipation  rate  of  minority  students.11 A  recent  UNICEF  ethno-linguistic  study  found  a  close \nlink between language barriers and poor academic performance among minority students, and \nthe  consequent  grade  repetitions  and  dropouts.12 Many  minority  children  with  little  or  no  prior \nexposure  to  the  Vietnamese  language  have  difficulty  understanding  lessons.  In  the  northern \nuplands  in  particular,  this  situation  can  be  heightened  by  the  confusing  mix  of  minority \nlanguages spoken in the same classroom and by teachers who have not been trained to teach \nin a multilingual and multicultural environment. To address this issue, methods of teaching in a \nmulticultural environment and of teaching Vietnamese to ethnic minority students must be made \npart of pre-service teacher training. \n \n20. \nGender  Disparities. A gender imbalance in educational attainment persists. There are \nfewer  girls  than  boys  enrolled  at  all  levels  of  the  education  system  except  in  professional \nsecondary education. A small but significant gender gap in enrollment in both primary education \nand LSE has not improved significantly over the last 5 years.13 Mean years of schooling offer a \nstark  illustration  of  this  gap:  on  average,  girls  complete  only  5.6  years  of  schooling  compared \nwith  6.8  years  for  boys.  This  gap  widens  dramatically  when  ethnicity  is  factored  in:  Kinh  boys \nachieve  8.5  mean  years  of  schooling,  compared  with  just  4.5  years  for  ethnic  minority  girls. \nImproved,  girl-friendly  school  facilities  and  programs  aimed  at  making  parents  more  aware  of \nthe benefits of educating their daughters will help reduce this imbalance.  \n \nOut-of-School  Youth.  Dropout  rates  are  highest  in  the  provinces  where  relatively \n21. \nwell-paid  unskilled  work  is  readily  available.  In  some  provinces  in  the  Mekong  River  Delta\u2014\nwhere tourism and garments are growth industries\u2014families often consider sending children to \nwork rather than to school as a more profitable option. In some provinces an estimated 20% of \n11-  to  14-year-olds  do  seasonal  work  in  the  factories  in  neighboring  provinces.  Motivating \noverage youth dropouts to reenter the formal school system is hard . In such cases, CECs can \nprovide  alternative  learning  opportunities.  Continuing  education  can  be  better  tailored  to  meet \ntheir  needs  for  vocational  and  life  skills  while  earning  them  a  secondary  leaving  certificate, \nwhich may even induce them to rejoin the formal education system later on. CECs in poor areas \nare  currently  limited  in  number,  and  many  suffer  from  overcrowding.  More  CEC  facilities  are \nneeded to ease the overcrowding and improve access for out-of-school youth. \n \n\nb. \n\nQuality and Relevance \n\n \n22. \nPoor Quality of Teaching. Real improvement in student learning will occur and become \nsustainable  only  when  teachers  are  fully  trained,  prepared,  and  supported  through  the \ncomplexities  of  teaching  ethnic  minority  students.  But  ethnic  minority  schools  in  remote  areas \ntend  to  suffer  even  more  than  schools  elsewhere  in  the  country  from  poor-quality  teaching, \nlimited  learning  resources,  high  teacher  absenteeism,  and  rapid  turnover  of  staff.  While  the \nteachers  generally  have  good  knowledge  and  the  majority  are  certified,  they  have  significant \nweaknesses  in  practical  teaching  skills.  These  weaknesses  are  due  to  such  factors  as  the \nfollowing:  (i)  an  intense  focus  on  the  acquisition  of  knowledge  at  the  expense  of  teaching \nmethods  in  both  pre-service  teacher  training  (PRESETT)  and  in-service  teacher  training \n(INSETT), (ii) culturally and linguistically inappropriate education, (iii) gender and ethnicity bias \nin  instructional  materials,  and  (iv)  a  lack  of  effective  strategies  for  motivating  young  teachers \nstruggling in difficult teaching environments and providing them with long-term career paths.  \n \n23. \n\nIt  is  difficult  to  recruit  experienced  teachers  for  remote  areas,  and  current  recruitment \n\n                                                 \n11  Kosonen, Kimmo. 2004.

Hanoi. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nand  deployment  strategies  coerce  rather  than  motivate.  Teachers  in  remote  schools  are  often \nnew  graduates  from  teacher  training  colleges  (TTCs)  who  are  inexperienced,  unfamiliar  with \nethnic  minority  languages  and  culture,  and  ill-equipped  to  teach  disadvantaged  students.  New \nteachers  need  mentoring  and  guidance  by  teacher  trainers,  but  opportunities  to  develop  skills \nand  gain  support  are  meager.  Schools  in  the  poorest  areas  are  under-resourced,  lacking \nteaching and learning materials, as well as adequate teacher accommodation. Providing on-site \nhousing as part of the employment package would address a key reason for the high turnover \nrate of teachers in ethnic minority areas. \n \nLimited Learning Materials and Facilities. An effective learning environment requires \n24. \nwell-equipped  facilities\u2014such  as  libraries  and  science  laboratories\u2014and  enough  good-quality \nlearning  materials  that  match  the  needs  and  interests  of  ethnic  minority  students  and  girls. \nHowever, the recurrent budgets of most schools are far from adequate to cover supplementary \nmaterials, and, for most poor ethnic minority families, textbooks are unaffordable unless highly \nsubsidized.  Suitable  resource  facilities,  equipment,  and  supplementary  materials,  as  well  as \ntraining of teachers in their use, would significantly improve the quality of learning and student \nachievement. \n \n\nc. \n\nEfficiency and Sustainability \n\n \n25. \nLow  Retention,  High  Repetition  and  Dropout  Rates.  The  average  number  of  years \nneeded to complete LSE in 2004 was 4.8 nationwide, but 5.7 in the Mekong River Delta, 5.0 in \nthe  Central  Highlands, and  5.3  on  average  for  ethnic  minorities.  The  average  LSS  completion \nrate that same year was 76% for the country as a whole but only 58% in the Mekong River Delta \n(footnote 6). These figures highlight the lower efficiency of services in remote areas. Minorities \ncompose 14% of enrollment in LSE and 12% in USE\u2014roughly equivalent to their overall share \nof  the  population.  However,  at  both  lower  and  upper  secondary  levels  overage  enrollment  is \nlikely to be significant as minorities in remote areas often delay enrolling their children in primary \nschool because of the long distances they must travel to school.  \n \n26. \nFor minority students, repetition rates at the primary level are higher, leading to overage \nentry  into  LSE,  and  correct-age  enrollment  is  likely  to  be  lower  than  the  total  figures. \nNationwide,  the  minority  population  aged  11\u201314  is  higher  than  the  minority  LSE  enrollment, \nindicating that ethnic minority enrollment is lower than it should be. About 1 in 5 children do not \ncomplete  primary  school,  and  about  70%  of  those  dropouts  are  girls.  At  the  secondary  level, \ndropout rates are much higher in poor regions. This reflects the high contribution that education \nrequires of households. Dropout data show a gender difference that is small at the LSE level but \nbecomes much larger at the USE level. The reasons commonly given for dropping out of school \nare  physical  distance  from  school;  high  direct,  indirect,  and  opportunity  costs;  and  low  quality \nand  relevance  of  education.  To  increase  system  efficiency  and  the  student  retention  rate, \neducation  administrators  must  be  trained  to  plan  and  manage  better  the  limited  education \nresources and to emphasize assistance policies for girls and minorities. \n \n27. \nIneffective  Planning  for  Disadvantaged  Groups.  Data-gathering  systems  at  MOET \nand  DOET  record  total  population  and  enrollment,  but  do  not  disaggregate  data  by  district, \nethnicity,  or  gender.  Disaggregated  data  are  needed  for  planning  and  managing  effective \ntargeted  support  for  disadvantaged  groups.  Accurate  data  on  enrollment  patterns  from  an \neducation  management  information  system  (EMIS)  will  enable  the  cost-effective  targeting  of \neducation interventions. \n \n28. \nLimited Accountability of Local Stakeholders. In the context of the decentralization of \nresponsibilities  and  resources,  MOET  is  working  to  improve  accountability  practices  to  ensure \nthat resources are used efficiently and that schools and offices report the impact of such use. \n\n\fAccountability  frameworks  hold  schools  accountable  and  compel  the  educational  system  to \nprovide  key  data  for  making  decisions  and  improving  outcomes.  MOET\u2019s  new  school  charter \nand  inclusive  school  development  plan  (ISDP)  requirements  are  intended  to  establish \naccountability by linking the school and the community in defining the school organization and \nactivities.  ISDPs  cover  issues  of  school  performance  and  student  learning  outcomes  and  set \nstandards  for  teachers.  In  the  majority  of  the  rural  provinces,  the  school  charter  and  ISDP \nprocesses are not yet participatory and seem to be undertaken more as an administrative task \nthan  as  functional  planning.  Training  administrators  and  community  representatives  and \nincreasing  their  awareness  of  the  use  of  ISDPs  will  improve  the  efficiency,  sustainability,  and \naccountability of education services. \n \n\n2. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector \n\nin  2003,  with \n\n \n29.  Many donor agencies and NGOs have been involved in the education sector since the \n1990s.  According  to  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP), 14  the  share  of \nhuman  resource  development  projects  generally  remained  stable \ntotal \ndisbursements in the sector increasing to $278 million. In the past 5 years, official development \nassistance  (ODA)  funds  for  education  and  training  composed  5.5\u20136%  of  total  public \nexpenditures for education. While basic education gets the largest share of the ODA funds, all \nlevels  of  education,  from  nursery  to  tertiary,  have  received  substantial  assistance  from  donor \npartners.  ADB  is  the  principal  donor  in  the  education  sector,  followed  by  the  World  Bank  and \nJICA. Major external assistance to the sector is summarized in Appendix 2. Improved resource \ntargeting and demand-driven initiatives will help even out the impact of the considerable funding \nof education by the Government and its partners.  \n \n30.  Multilateral  Donor  Partners.  The  World  Bank  has  supported  primary,  tertiary,  and \nspecial education, while ADB has focused on secondary and vocational/technical education and \ntraining.  Since  2000,  World  Bank  assistance  has  dealt  primarily  with  issues  related  to \ninstitutional capacity development and decentralization of education planning and finance. The \nWorld  Bank  and  the  like-minded  donor  group 15 have  been  working  toward  a  medium-term \nexpenditure  framework  in  primary  education.  UNESCO  is  also  a  key  development  partner  in \nboth primary and secondary education. It is a focal agency for NAPEFA and for girls\u2019 education, \ncapacity  development  of  local  education  authorities,  literacy  though  adult  education,  and \nHIV/AIDS  preventive  education.  UNICEF  is  active  in  early  childhood  care  and  education, \nbilingual education for ethnic minority youth, and the introduction of \u201cchild-friendly\u201d schools. It is \nalso the lead agency for the United Nations Girls\u2019 Education Initiatives. The European Union is \nworking on the renovation of the EMIS in the primary education subsector.  \n \n31. \nBilateral  Donor  Partners.  The  Government  of  Japan  is  a  key  bilateral  donor  in  the \neducation  sector.  JICA  has  been  working  mainly  on  primary  education  through  school \nconstruction  and  equipment  provision  since  the  early  1990s,  but  recently  indicated  a  shift  in \npriority  from  primary  to  secondary  and  tertiary  education.  The  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation  supported  a  higher  education  project,  providing  fellowships  to  upgrade  the \nacademic qualifications of young researchers. France, another major bilateral donor, allocated \n8%  of  its  ODA  in  2002  to  education,  mainly  for  language  training,  research  studies, \nscholarships,  and  vocational  training.  Australia  and  Belgium  have  also  financed  scholarships \nand  have  provided  grant  assistance  to  LSE  as  cofinanciers  of  ADB  TA  projects.  The \nUnited Kingdom has similarly participated in World Bank projects as a cofinancier. \n \n\n                                                 \n14  UNDP Viet Nam. 2005.

As  the  lead  donor  in  the  education  sector,  ADB  has  a  current \nproject portfolio valued at about $150 million including four ongoing loan projects, a Japan Fund \nfor  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  grant,  and  $110  million  worth  of  projects  in  the  pipeline  (until \n2010),  the  proposed  project  among  them.  The  ADB  loan  for  teacher  training  (Loan  1718)  has \nupgraded TTC pre-service teacher training for LSE through curriculum revision, rehabilitation of \nTTC  facilities,  equipment  provision,  and  overseas  training.16 The  Upper  Secondary  Education \nDevelopment  Project  (Loan  1979)  is  aimed  at  expanding  access  to  USE  and  improving  the \nquality  of  in-service  teacher  training  for  USE  teachers. 17  The  Second  Lower  Secondary \nEducation Development Project (Loan 2115), launched in March 2005,18 is improving the quality \nof LSE by developing a new assessment framework for student learning outcomes and setting \nfundamental  levels  of  quality  for  schools.  A  loan  project  approved  in  December  2006  is \nimproving pre-service teacher training for USE and professional secondary education teachers \nby  supporting  teacher  training  universities.  A  JFPR  grant  for  the  expansion  of  learning \nopportunities  for  ethnic  minority  youth  (JFPR  9099)  is  providing  scholarships  and  academic \nsupport  to  enable  ethnic  minority  upper  secondary  students  to  attend  TTCs  and  become  LSE \nteachers in their communes.19 \n \n\n3. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n \n33. \nThe key lessons learned from ADB\u2019s experience are that successful projects require (i) a \nresults-based  approach,  (ii)  project  site  selection,  and  (iii)  a  project  design  tailored  to  the \nspecific needs of target areas. How the proposed project incorporates these issues is discussed \nin the Special Features section of this report (paras. 59\u201362). \n \n34. \nFocus  on  Results.  Many  education  projects  tend  to  set  out  vague  project  outcomes \nsuch as \u201cimproved quality of secondary education,\u201d and do not have a time-bound action plan \nwith monitoring indictors. More attention is paid to individual activities and inputs rather than to \nresults  (e.g.,  the  project  outcome  and  impact).  For  this  reason,  although  several  large-scale \ninvestment projects in secondary education have been implemented successfully in Viet Nam, \ntheir  impact  and  outcomes  have  no  synergy  and  the  country  has  not  achieved  universal  LSE. \nThe SESMP 2006\u20132010 analysis finds that the principal policy goal of a 90% NER by 2010 can \nbe  achieved \nthrough  more  effective  resource  mobilization  and  strategic  pedagogical \napproaches.  \n \n35. \nGeographic  Targeting. In previous ADB projects where targeted assistance was to be \nprovided  to  disadvantaged  areas,  the  Government  identified  disadvantaged  areas  at  the \nprovince level and with a very broad geographic spread, covering almost one third of Viet Nam\u2019s \nprovinces.  The  assistance,  as  a  result,  was  spread  too  thinly\u2014within  a  given  area  it  was  too \nsmall  in  real  terms  to  have  significant  impact.  Survey  data  show  marked  intra-provincial \ndisparities: the education conditions in some districts belonging to relatively wealthy provinces \nare often far worse than in better-off districts in poorer provinces. However, these poor districts \nin  wealthy  provinces  were  neglected  in  past  projects,  where  province-based  target  selection \nwas  the  norm.  To  provide  substantial  assistance  to  the  most  disadvantaged  groups,  project \nsites  should  be  identified  at  the  district  level  on  the  basis  of  an  integrated  assessment  of \neducation, socioeconomic, and poverty indicators. \n\n                                                 \n16  ADB.  1999.

Manila.  \n\n\f \nAssistance  Customized  to  Suit  Local  Needs.  ADB\u2019s  education  projects  have \n36. \nattempted  to  meet  all  of  the  immediate  needs  of  the  secondary  education  subsector.  Project \nactivities  have  been  piecemeal,  as  opposed  to  being  strategically  linked.  In  many  cases  loan \nproceeds were allocated to the project components according to a \u201cbalanced percentage\u201d\u2014for \nexample,  30%  of  loan  funds  for  teacher  training,  25%  for  civil  works,  and  20%  for  equipment. \nThese  were  stock  ratios,  which  were  not  based  on  the  actual  outputs  required  to  produce  the \ndesired  results.  They  were  used  partly  because  education  planners  and  teachers  in  remote \nareas generally had limited opportunities to participate in project design. To be more effective, \nthe  Project  will  be  better  tailored  to  local  conditions.  It  will  implement  a  well-considered \ncombination  of  supply-  and  demand-side  interventions  to  encourage  the  most  hard-to-reach \npopulations\u2014the Project\u2019s intended targets\u2014to participate in LSE. \n \n37.  Minimized Implementation  Delay.  A number of ADB\u2019s education projects have had a \nlate  start-up  because  of  delay  in  the  declaration  of  loan  effectiveness  or  the  signing  of  the \ntechnical  assistance  letter.  With  better-harmonized  procedures  for  project  administration,  the \nperformance  of  many  projects  has gradually  improved.  Close  consultation  and  communication \nwith  the  Office  of  the  Government,  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment,  the  Ministry  of \nFinance,  and  the  State  Bank  of  Viet  Nam  has  helped  develop  the  executing  agencies\u2019 \nownership  and  commitment  to  smooth  implementation.  However,  there  are  still delays  caused \nby such factors as the slow and complex approval of procurement plans and the limited number \nof staff in the State Treasury assigned to the education sector. To ensure timely, good-quality \nimplementation, there is need for close monitoring and intensive support from the Government \nand ADB. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  lead  to  universal  lower  secondary  education,  and  hence  to \n38. \ngreater  social  and  economic  inclusion  of  disadvantaged  groups.  Its  outcome  will  be  improved \nNER in lower secondary education, particularly for ethnic minorities and girls, in 103 of the most \ndisadvantaged  districts  from  the  Project  provinces. 20  The  first  investment  to  provide  direct \nsupport  to  the  SESMP 2006\u20132010  action  plan,  it  is  designed  to  be  synergistic  with  other \nongoing ADB education interventions in Viet Nam. The project design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 3.  \n \nB. \n \n39. \nTo improve education outcomes for ethnic minorities and girls, the Project will have four \noutputs:  (i)  improved  access  to  LSE,  (ii)  enhanced  quality  and  relevance  of  lower  secondary \neducation,  (iii)  pilot  innovations  to  improve  access  and  equity,  and  (iv)  improved  planning  and \nmanagement capacity for lower secondary education in the most disadvantaged regions. \n \n \n \n\nOutput 1: Improved Access to Lower Secondary Education \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\na. \n\nConstruction of Classrooms and Semi-Boarding Facilities \n\n \n40. \nThe  primary  result  expected  from  this  subcomponent  is  increased  capacity  to  absorb \nstudents who now cannot attend LSSs because of lack of physical access in the target districts. \nSchools,  classrooms,  and  semi-boarding  facilities  will  be  constructed  to  expand  access  for \n\n                                                 \n20  The 17 target provinces are Ca Mau, Cao Bang, Dac Lac, Dac Nong, Dien Bien, Gia Lai, Ha Giang, Kien Giang, \n\nKon Tum, Lai Chau, Lao Cai, Ninh Thuan, Son La, Tra Vinh, Yen Bai, Bac Kan, and Soc Trang.  \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\ntrends,  and \n\nethnic minority and poor students who live in remote communes. The Project will build 819 new \nLSS classrooms with furniture for (i) new schools identified through a school mapping scheme in \nthose communes with no LSSs, or new schools built to solve the problem of long distance from \nschool;  (ii) schools  with  a  currently  high  student\u2013classroom  ratio;  (iii) schools  that  need  to \nreplace  classrooms  in  poor  condition  and  temporary  classrooms;  and  (iv)  newly  established \nsemi-boarding schools for ethnic minorities.21 The number was determined through an in-depth \nsurvey  of  schools,  which  included  projections  of  classroom  demand  based  on  school-age \npopulation  density,  demographic \ninternal  migration  analysis.  Assuming  a \nconservatively  estimated  40  students  per  classroom  in  double  shifts,  the  Project  will  support \n65,500  new  places.  Considering  the  resource  gap  in  school  construction  and  general \nmaintenance  capacity  of  the  beneficiary  communities,  the  civil  works  will  meet  MOET\u2019s \nfundamental school quality level.22  \n \nThe  Project  will  also  construct  960  semi-boarding  rooms  at  schools  in  ethnic  minority \n41. \nareas,  and  provide  furniture  for  these  rooms.  At  eight  students  per  room,  the  semi-boarding \nfacilities  will  provide  spaces  for  7,680  additional  students,  50%  of  whom  will  be  girls.  Clean \nwater and sanitation facilities and cooking facilities will be included in all construction. All project \nfacilities will be \u201cgirl-friendly\u201d and will include separate sanitation facilities for girls and boys, and \nsecure  rooms  that  maintain  privacy.  Many  existing  semi-boarding  facilities  are  not  sturdy;  the \nwalls separating girls\u2019 from boys\u2019 rooms are flimsy and do not reach the ceiling. Parents worry \nabout the safety of their daughters. The semi-boarding facilities will be constructed mainly in the \nNorthern  provinces  and  the  Central  Highlands,  where  the  need  is  greatest.  The  selection  of \nsites will be based on demand criteria, including the average and farthest distances that children \nlive  from  the  schools,  difficulty  of  terrain,  and  availability  of  home-stay  alternatives.  The \neducation facilities and teacher housing development plan is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n\nb. \n\nConstruction of Continuing Education Center Classrooms \n\n \n42. \nUniversal  secondary  education  can  be  achieved  only  through  support  for  both  formal \nsecondary education and alternative learning opportunities for out-of-school youth not served by \nthe  formal  education  system  (including  school  dropouts  and  school  leavers).  The  Project  will \nprovide  the  first  large-scale  assistance  to  CECs,  creating  equitable  access  to  LSE  for \nout-of-school  youth  in  disadvantaged  districts  by  constructing,  furnishing  and  equipping  CEC \nlearning  facilities.  The  Project  will  build  and  equip  48  new  classrooms  and  sanitation  facilities \nwhere there are none or where only poor sanitation facilities exist. At 40 students per classroom, \nthe Project will provide 1,920 new CEC spaces. Emphasis will be given to districts with a high \nproportion of out-of-school youth.  \n \n \n \n\nOutput 2: Enhanced Quality and Relevant of Lower Secondary Education  \n\n2. \n\na. \n\nBetter In-Service Teacher Training \n\n \n43. \nTo  enhance  the  quality  and  relevance  of  LSE,  the  Project  will  strengthen  INSETT  and \nwill  draw  on  local  expertise  by  selecting  170  provincial  TTC  lecturers  for  intensive  training  to \nbecome  core  trainers.  The  core  trainers  will  participate  in  the  following  training  programs: \nteaching  practice  and \n(i) student-centered  and  active-learning  methodologies \nclass-based  student  assessment;  (ii)  mentor  training,  career  counseling,  and  continuing \n\nincluding \n\n                                                 \n21  According  to  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Decision  Nos.  186/2001/Q\u00a7-TTg,  168/2001/Q\u00a7-TTg  and  112/2005/  Q\u00a7-TTg,  there \nshould be at least one boarding school for ethnic minorities per district in the six most disadvantaged provinces in \nthe Northern Mountainous and Central Highland areas. \n\n22  MOET is developing three sets of standards for lower secondary schools on the basis of local financial capacity, as \nfollows: (i) international standard; (ii) national standard; and (iii) fundamental school quality level, i.e., the minimum \nstandard for facilities and teacher qualifications that all schools must meet.  \n\n\f11 \n\nprofessional  development  (CPD); 23  (iii)  effective  use  of  new  materials  for  disadvantaged \nstudents;  (iv)  use  of  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  in  the  classroom; \n(v) support  for  the  teaching  of  Vietnamese  to  ethnic  minority  students  and  in  a  multicultural \nenvironment; and (vi) gender and cultural awareness programs. The core trainers will act as the \nmain resource persons and change agents. \n \n44. \nThe  170  core  trainers  will  in  turn  train  2,900  key  teachers  (two  from  each  LSS  in  the \n103 project districts). After this intensive training, the key teachers will disseminate the training \nto  the  30,000  lower  secondary  teachers  through  cluster  school\u2013based  INSETT,  using  new \nnoncore curriculum modules and materials designed for teaching ethnic minorities and girls. Key \nteachers will also be responsible for: (i) mentoring and supporting new teachers, and (ii) working \nwith  the  school  principal  on  ISDPs.  The  Project  will  introduce  a  \u201cwhole-school  approach,\u201d \ncurrently  considered  best  practice  internationally,  in  which  the  school  or  cluster  becomes  the \ncenter for in-service activities. This approach will be embedded in school development planning \nso the school principal must support the program and have the resources to implement the plan. \n \n\nb. \n\nBetter Pre-service Teacher Training \n\n \n45. \nThe Project will build capacity among TTC lecturers to deliver new PRESETT modules \nto  teacher  trainees.  The  170  core  trainers  will  (i)  develop  seven  pro-poor,  ethnicity-  and \ngender-relevant PRESETT modules for use in the 17 TTCs in the target provinces; (ii) provide \ntraining  based  on  the  seven  modules  to  6,200  new-intake  trainee  teachers  at  their  TTCs;  and \n(iii) act as mentors and points of contact to maintain linkages between PRESETT and INSETT. \nSustainable  change  will  be  rooted  in  skills  development:  student  teachers  will  apply \nactive-learning methodologies first in a \u201csafe environment\u201d through micro and peer teaching and \nthen practice them in the real classroom environment. The introduction to inclusive education at \nTTCs  will  raise  awareness  of  equity,  gender,  and  ethnic  minority  education  issues.  These \nconcepts will require more than just one-off training and the principles will need to be endorsed \nat the school level in ISDPs. \n \n\nc. \n\nContinuing Professional Development \n\n \n46. \nCPD,  while  still  a  relatively  new  concept  in  Viet  Nam,  is  a  widely  adopted  scheme  for \nlifelong career development for the teaching profession. CPD is a response to the inadequacy of \none-off training and summer courses that are insufficient in themselves to effect the transfer of \nboth  knowledge  and  skills.  It  not  only  upgrades  qualifications  but  continually  improves  and \nstrengthens  teachers\u2019  professional  and  cognitive  skills.  Through  CPD,  the  Project  expects  to \nensure  the  sustainability  of  training  and  to  reduce  attrition  rates  among  teachers  from  remote \nschools. A CPD framework and action plan will be elaborated as part of the training of the 170 \ncore  trainers.  Later  in  the  implementation  phase,  CPD  plans  will  be  further  developed  as  a \nsub-module of the general PRESETT and INSETT activities, as described above.  \n \n\nd. \n\nSupplementary Instructional Materials \n\n \n47. \nSelected  key  teachers  will  work  with  the  170  core  trainers  to  adapt  (or  develop  where \nnecessary) (i) culturally appropriate and gender sensitive INSETT and PRESETT materials and \nhandouts,  (ii)  supplementary  lesson  materials  for  teachers,  and  (iii)  learner  support  materials. \nSupplementary  materials  will  be  based  on  the  new  textbooks,  with  specific  focus  on  relevant \nmaterials  for  minority  and  girl  students.  Materials  for  peer  teaching,  observation  and \nconstructive  feedback,  and  classroom  action  research  will  also  be  developed.  The  Project  will \n                                                 \n23  Traditionally,  CPD  was  delivered  through  in-service  courses  and  school  events,  but  new  strategies  are  being \ncreated to broaden delivery systems. In the UK, CPD includes secondments, mentoring, advanced skills courses, \nand e-networking. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nprovide  overseas  and  local  training  for  instructional  material  development  and  produce \n7,900 sets of the materials. Supplementary materials for new LSE teacher trainees will cover (i) \neffective  use  of  new  textbooks,  (ii)  improvement  of  students\u2019  study  skills,  (iii) classroom \nmanagement  in  mixed-culture  and  mixed-language  classes,  (iv)  a  pupils\u2019  book  for  teaching \nVietnamese to ethnic minority students, and (v) bilingual material for minority students who need \nadditional  support.  Similar  materials  will  be  prepared  for  INSETT  purposes  and  distributed  to \n30,000  LSS  teachers.  Students\u2019  materials  will  be  prepared  and  pilot-tested  in  schools,  and \n110,000 copies (70 sets per school) will be made available throughout the 103 target districts.  \n \n\ne. \n\nNew Housing for Teachers \n\n \n48. \nThis  subcomponent  will  support  improvements  in  the  quality  of  education  by  attracting \nmore  qualified  and  experienced  teachers  to  remote  minority  schools  through  the  provision  of \nteacher housing facilities. The survey showed that among financial and nonfinancial incentives \nfor  teachers,  the  availability  of  teacher  housing  exerts  the  strongest  positive  influence  on  the \ndecision of qualified teachers to work in remote schools. Conversely, the lack of decent teacher \nhousing  is  a  key  reason  for  the  high  attrition  rates  among  teachers  in  minority  areas.  The \nProject will construct dwellings for 867 teachers, single as well as married, to encourage teacher \nretention in the remote regions. Basic facilities will include separate sanitation facilities, cooking \nfacilities, and water storage tanks. The construction of teacher housing will be prioritized in the \nmost  remote  schools  where  semi-boarding  facilities  will  be  provided.  This  will  ensure  that \nresponsible adults are always on hand wherever there are semi-boarding students. Eligibility of \nteachers  will  follow  government  regulations,  but  priority  will  be  given  to  female  and  ethnic \nminority  teachers.  The  school  will  own  the  housing  and  will  make  it  available  to  teachers \nrent-free  for  as  long  as  they  remain  at  the  school.  The  right  of  occupation  will  revert  to  the \nschool once the teachers retire or otherwise leave the school.  \n \n\nf. \n\nNew Laboratories and Libraries \n\n \nThe Project will construct and equip 180 libraries and 112 laboratories at selected LSSs \n49. \nand CECs where such educational resource facilities are currently unavailable. These facilities \nwill  contribute  to  improving  the  quality  of  teaching  and  the  learning  outcomes  of  the  minority \nstudents. The facilities will also serve as function rooms for awareness-raising activities, teacher \ntraining  workshops,  and  community  events.  Communities  and  parent-teacher  associations  of \ntarget schools will receive maintenance manuals.  \n \n\ng. \n\nInformation and Communication Technology Applications in the \nEducation of Girls and Ethnic Minorities \n\n \n50. \nThough the main focus of ICT activities will be on the use of ICT for the development of \nmanagerial  and  planning  capacity,  the  Project  will  also  promote  the  effective  use  of  ICT  for \nteaching in disadvantaged regions. This subcomponent will support better access to educational \nresources  through  ICT  for  teachers  in  remote  areas.  Web-based  instructional  materials  will  be \ndeveloped.  The  Project  will  provide  pilot  ICT  facilities  for  networking  with  TTCs  and  selected \nethnic  minority  schools.  Through  this  e-mentoring  network,  TTCs  will  help  teachers  in  remote \nschools  to  strengthen  their  pedagogical  skills\u2014teaching,  coaching,  and  mentoring  adolescents \nand  guiding  minority  students  in  making  career  choices  and  in  dealing  with  such  issues  as \nlanguage barriers, low self-esteem, drugs and smoking, and early marriage and pregnancy.  \n \n\nh. \n\nScholarship Program for Teacher Training for Minority Students  \n\n \n51. \nThe \u201cnew transitional program\u201d is a package of assistance in support of the development \nof ethnic minority students in upper secondary school into lower secondary teachers in their own \n\n\f13 \n\ncommunities. Priority will be given to the teaching of ethnic minority languages and subjects that \nare  in  short  supply  in  remote  areas.  The  program  was  pilot-tested  under  a  JFPR  grant  (see \nfootnote 19), and the lessons learned\u2014such as that the financial support should extend over the \nentire  3  years  of  TTC  to  encourage  completion\u2014will  feed  into  the  expansion  and  scaling-up \neffort under the Project. The Project will provide 250 minority students (50% of these, girls) with \n(i)  an  academic  preparatory  course  (1  year)  and  (ii)  financial  support  of  $455  per  year  for  4 \nyears,  for  textbooks  and  food.  Scholarship  recipients  are  expected  to  become  teachers  who, \nwith  their  understanding  of  their  own  minority  languages  and  culture,  can  be  successful  role \nmodels  for  ethnic  minority  youth.  Minority  teachers  are  more  likely  to  return  to  their  own \ncommunities to work.  \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput 3: Pilot Innovations to Improve Access and Equity for Minorities and \nGirls to Lower Secondary Education \n\n \n\na. \n\nPilot Scholarship Program for Ethnic Minorities  \n\n \n52. \nThe Project will provide 4-year scholarships to 800 students from the 18 smallest ethnic \nminority  groups  to  improve  access  to  and  completion  of  LSE  for  the  neediest  students  (see \nfootnote  5).  The  scholarship  scheme  will  help  in  the  successful  transition  of  grade  5  minority \nstudents from primary to lower secondary level. In this pilot phase, target students will receive \nfinancial support of $200 per year for the duration of LSS, and dropout rates will be monitored. \nThis  subcomponent  will  serve  as  a  basis  for  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  on  the \ncountry\u2019s future scholarship policy. The impact of this financial support and its ability to attract \nminority  students  to  upper  levels  of  education  will  be  assessed.  The  Project  will  organize  a \nnational workshop to disseminate the results of the pilot program and will help the Government \nfurther develop policy options for scholarship schemes, including tuition exemption and student \nloans. The scholarship program plan is in Appendix 4. \n \n\nb. \n\nPublic Awareness Campaign to Promote Lower Secondary \nEducation \n\n \n53. \nThe  Project  will  address  demand-side  issues  in  education  in  ethnic  minority  areas  by \nraising public awareness of the importance and value of lower secondary schooling, particularly \nfor girls. These demand-side activities will be targeted at parents, commune and village leaders, \neducation planners, and students, and will use a combination of approaches including: (i) print \nmedia  such  as  posters,  discussion  cards,  and  stickers;  (ii)  mass  media  including  radio  and \ncommune broadcasting and village meetings; and (iii) promotional activities at local community \nand  school  events.  The  CECs  will  play  a  central  role  in  the  campaign  activities.  The \nawareness-raising activity plan is in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n  \n\nc. \n\nPilot Semi-Boarding School Feeding Program \n\n \nThis subcomponent will ensure that all students in semi-boarding facilities have adequate \n54. \nnutrition during the food-scarce preharvest months. Currently, children in semi-boarding facilities \nmust bring their own food from home and cook their own meals. In practice, many poor students \nsubsist  on  little  more  than  rice,  and  even  rice  becomes  scarce  particularly  in  the  preharvest \nmonths.  Seasonal  poverty  is  at  its  peak  during  this  time,  and  nearly  two  thirds  of  all  ethnic \nminorities  have  incomes  below  the  poverty  line  even  under  normal  circumstances.  The  school \nfeeding  program  for  semi-boarders  will  provide  15  kilograms  of  rice  per  student  per  month  for \n3 months  over  4  years.  It  will  reduce  the  burden  on  parents  to  provide  food  during  the  season \nwhen food is most scarce, encourage children from poor minorities to attend school and reduce \nattrition, and improve educational outcomes, as well-nourished children are better able to learn. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nd. \n\nResearch Studies on Pilot Innovations \n\n \n55.  MOET  will  commission  four  research  studies  to  evaluate  the  innovative  pilot  initiatives \nunder  Output  3  \u2014scholarships,  awareness-raising  activities  and  school  feeding.  Research \ninstitutes and universities will conduct the studies with the assistance of the international ethnic \nminority  education  adviser.  The  national  project  implementation  unit  (NPIU)  will  develop  and \nsubmit a detailed research study plan to ADB, but the overall emphasis will be on examining the \ndemand  side  of  ethnic  minority  education  (i.e.,  the  efficacy  of  interventions  that  encourage \nschool  enrollments  and  retention  of  the  hardest-to-reach  populations,  complementing  supply-\nside  interventions  such  as  building  physical  facilities).  NPIU  will  post  the  research  findings  on \nthe project website. The results will be used in refining the related subcomponents such as the \nscholarship program, INSETT, and educational planning training. \n \n\n4. \n\nOutput 4: Improved Planning and Managing Capacity for Lower Secondary \nEducation in the Most Disadvantaged Regions \n\na. \n\nCapacity Development for Education Planning and Management \n\n \n56. \nThe Project will complement MOET\u2019s ongoing capacity development initiatives in general \neducation  planning  and  management.  The  focus  will  be  on  the  planning  and  management \nneeds  of  schools  in  remote  and  disadvantaged  areas,  where  more  flexible  approaches  and \ngreater  community  involvement  are  required.  The  Project  will  introduce  performance-based \nmanagement  training  for  school  principals  and  staff  of  the  BOETs,  DOETs,  and  MOET.  The \ngoal  is  to  promote  better  planning  at  the  start  of  the  school  cycle;  greater  transparency, \nconsistency,  and  fairness  in  assessment;  and  wider  access  to  CPD.  School  principals  will \nreceive  leadership  framework  training  to  enable  them  to  develop  ISDPs  and  carry  out  their \nschool charter, neither of which is fully functional at present. The Project will train 1,450 school \nprincipals  as  well  as  150  BOET,  DOET,  and  MOET  staff  in  planning  and  managing  targeted \nassistance  for  disadvantaged  groups.  In  addition,  25  MOET  staff  will  have  the  opportunity  to \nundergo  overseas  training  within  the  region  to  learn  from  international  best  practices  in  policy \nplanning for disadvantaged groups. \n \n\nb. \n\nSchool-Based Education Management Information System for Ethnic \nMinorities \n\n \n57. \nThis  subcomponent  will  help  secondary  school  principals  and  their  staff  to  develop \nISDPs  and  apply  their  school  charter  to  school-based  monitoring  and  planning.  ADB\u2019s  Upper \nSecondary  Education  Development  Project  is  currently  pilot-testing  a  student-based  EMIS  for \nvulnerable  children.  This  subcomponent  will  carefully  review  the  results  and  scale  up  the \nstudent-based  EMIS  to  cover  the  target  schools  that  have  access  to  electricity  and  to  ICT \ntraining. The school-based EMIS will capture detailed gender- and ethnicity-disaggregated data \nto support effective planning and management for targeted assistance to disadvantaged groups. \nSchools and BOETs will receive hardware, software, and training to implement this component. \nThe training will also be made available to relevant MOET, DOET, BOET, and TTC staff.  \n \n\nc. \n\nProject Implementation and Administration Support \n\n \n58. \nThe  Project  will  provide  implementation  support  to  NPIU  and  other  implementing \npartners through consulting services, procurement of equipment and materials, and operational \ncosts  and  logistics.  A  project  implementation  network  will  be  established  among  NPIU, \nprovincial project implementation units (PPIUs), and district coordination committees comprising \nthe target districts and communes together with relevant schools and the BOETs. Provincial and \ndistrict  people\u2019s  committees  will  also  play  an  important  role  in  civil  works  processing  and \n\n\f15 \n\nSpecial Features \n\nawareness-raising  activities,  though  overall  responsibility  for  civil  works  will  lie  with  the  DOET \ndirectors.  This  subcomponent  will  support  reporting  requirements\u2014including  annual  audit \nreporting, and review and monitoring requirements\u2014and capacity development workshops and \nseminars that are not covered under other subcomponents. The tracer study on the beneficiary \nlower secondary school graduates will be undertaken.  \n \nC. \n \n59. \nResults-Oriented  Approach.  The  Project  has  a  strong  results  orientation,  with \ntime-bound monitoring indicators developed and agreed on by the Government and other donor \npartners  in  SESMP  2006\u20132010.  The  Project  has  a  clearly  stated  and  measurable  expected \nimpact  and  outcome.  All  component  activities  are  designed  to  directly  address  the  identified \nconstraints  on  universal  secondary  education  in  the  most  disadvantaged  regions,  and  will  be \ntracked with the use of the results-based monitoring framework in Appendix 5.  \n \n60. \nGeographic  Targeting.  The  Project  developed  a  rigorous  selection  procedure  for \nidentifying and targeting the most disadvantaged districts and schools. District-based selection \nis an innovative design approach for education sector projects in Viet Nam. Intensive social and \npoverty  analysis  was  undertaken  to  select  the  target  districts.  Districts  were  evaluated  and \nranked according to (i) socioeconomic indicators including average per capita income, poverty \nincidence, MDGs, minority population ratio, ratio of minorities in the 11\u201314 age range to whole \npopulation in that age range, Gini coefficient for education,24 proportion of households belonging \nto the bottom income quintile, and unemployment rate; (ii) education indicators including gross \nenrollment  rate  and  net  enrollment  rate,  disaggregated  by  gender,  ethnicity,  and  household \nincomes  where  possible,  dropout  rate,  cohort  survival  rate,  average  learning  outcomes  at \nnational  examinations,  average  commuting  distance  to  schools,  average  qualification  of \nteachers, \nfinancial \nsustainability  of  education  expenditures  of  local  authorities,  and  percentage  of  double-  and \ntriple-shift classes; and (iii) other factors such as the availability of government or donor support, \ngeographic  balance,  priority  for  natural  disaster-prone  regions,  and  priority  for  provinces  that \nhave never received support from education projects. The detailed selection methodology is in \nAppendix  6  and  a  brief  profile  of  each  of  the  103  target  districts  in  the  17 provinces  is  in \nAppendix 7. \n \n61. \nActivities Tailored to Local Needs. To identify the actual needs of each target district \nand  to  encourage  ownership  by  local  stakeholders,  a  questionnaire-based  survey  and  a \nreferendum  on  proposed  activities  were  undertaken  with  MOET,  DOET,  and  BOET\u2014a \nconsultation procedure similar to that adopted by Viet Nam\u2019s line ministries. The survey results \nconfirmed a high degree of approval (more than 90%) from the target districts for the proposed \ncore  activities.  Hence,  project  activities  are  tailored  to  the  expressed  needs  of  target  districts. \nThe  extensive  consultation  process  contributed  greatly  to  generating  commitment  and  project \nownership from local stakeholders at the central and district levels.  \n \n62. \nInnovative  Approaches.  The  Project  will  implement  several  innovative  approaches  to \nimproving  educational  access  and  equity  for  ethnic  minorities  and  girls.  Some  of  these \napproaches  are  being  pilot-tested  under  other  ADB-funded  projects;  others  will  build  on \ninternational experience. Technical innovations to focus support where it will be most effective in \nmeeting  the  real  needs  of  disadvantaged  groups  include  assistance  to  CECs,  construction  of \nteacher  housing  and  school  semi-boarding  facilities,  scholarships  for  minority  students  to \nsupport  the  transition  from  primary  education  through  LSE  to  USE,  scholarships  to  TTCs  for \nethnic  minorities,  a  school  feeding  program,  and  awareness-raising  activities  for  minority \n\nteacher\u2013student  ratio,  average  number  of \n\ntextbooks  per  student, \n\n                                                 \n24  The education Gini coefficient is a measure of distributive educational attainment that reflects education inequality. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n \n\n \n \nB. \n \n \n \n\nparents and communities. Pedagogical innovations to make secondary education more relevant \nand interesting to girls and ethnic minorities include Vietnamese language teaching for children \nwhose  mother  tongue  is  not  Vietnamese,  and  development  of  teachers\u2019  classroom  skills  and \ncareer planning through INSETT and CPD. \n \nD. \n \n63. \nThe project cost is estimated at $64 million equivalent, including $1.65 million equivalent \nin taxes and duties, and $5.98 million equivalent in physical and price contingencies. The costs \nare  summarized  in  Table  1.

The  loan  will  have  a  term  of  32  years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, and an interest rate charge of 1% per year during the grace \nperiod  and  1.5%  per  year  after  that.  ADB  will  finance  78.1%  of  the  project  cost.  The \nGovernment  will  provide  counterpart  financing  for  the  remaining  21.9%,  or  $14  million \nequivalent\u2014$9.9 million equivalent (15.5%) from the central budget, and $4.1 million equivalent \n(6.4%) from provincial budgets\u2014for land acquisition, maintenance of facilities, and equipment to \nbe procured under the Project.

In line with Decree 131, MOET will take the role of \u201cproject owner\u201d \n65. \nand  will  be  responsible  for  both  overall  project  management  and  guidance  as  the  Executing \nAgency (EA). An NPIU will be established in MOET to oversee day-to-day project implementation. \nThe NPIU will comprise the project manager, a deputy project manager, and key technical staff, \nfinance,  procurement,  civil  works,  staff  development,  social  and  community \nincluding \ndevelopment, and ICT/EMIS experts. Each of the 17 target provinces will establish a PPIU in the \nDOET. DOET directors will bear responsibility for civil works. PPIUs will obtain approval for all civil \nworks activities from the relevant provincial people\u2019s committees and district people\u2019s committees. \nThe PPIUs will be responsible for implementing, coordinating, monitoring, and reporting activities \nat the provincial level under NPIU instruction and guidance. PIUs are appointed by government, \nand all their recurrent costs will be borne by government. The district coordination committees will \ncollaborate with communities and local leaders in participatory planning and awareness raising in \nthe  target  districts,  and  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  and  supervising  project  activities  in \nschools  and  coordinating  with  DOETs.  A  chart  showing  the  project  organization  structure  and \nrelationships is in Appendix 9. \n \nImplementation Period. The Project will be implemented over 6 years, from June 2008 \n66. \nto June 2014. The closing date for loan utilization will be 31 December 2014. The Government \nhas given its assurance that adequate budgetary provision for the Project will be included in the \n2007/2008 fiscal year budget. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 10. \n \n67. \nProcurement.  ADB-financed  goods  and  works  will  be  procured  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The NPIU, in close cooperation \nwith  relevant  PPIUs  and  BOETs,  will  be  responsible  for  all  procurement.  National  competitive \nbidding  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  will  be  carried  out.  Modifications  and \nclarifications  that  need  to  be  made  regarding  the  Borrower\u2019s  national  competitive  bidding \nprocedures must be agreed on by ADB and the Borrower. Given the broad geographic range of \nthe Project, and the resulting high number of relatively small contract packages anticipated, all \ncivil  works  contracts  will  be  procured  through  national  competitive  bidding.  An  indicative \nprocurement plan and packages for 18 months are in Appendix 11. \n \n68. \nContracts  for  goods  estimated  at  $1  million  equivalent  or  more  will  be  awarded  through \ninternational  competitive  bidding,  and  those  for  goods  (other  than  instructional  materials) \nestimated at less than $1 million but more than $100,000 equivalent through national competitive \nbidding.  Contracts  estimated  at  less  than  $100,000  equivalent  will  follow  shopping  procedures. \nInstructional materials will be procured through national competitive bidding or direct contracting.25 \nAwareness-raising materials will be procured through least-cost selection. Details of procurement \n\n                                                 \n25 Some kinds of instructional material produced by the Education Publishing House can be procured through direct \n\ncontracting with Education Publishing House if the publishing house retains copyright of the materials. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\npackages and technical specifications will be submitted to ADB for approval before procurement. \nMOET  will  take  advance  procurement  action  for  the  recruitment  of  individual  consultants  in  the \ncase  of  the  international  project  facilitation  adviser  and  the  national  project  facilitation  and \nmanagement adviser, to expedite implementation. ADB\u2019s concurrence to advance action does not \ncommit ADB to finance related expenditure under the Project or to finance the Project.  \n \n69. \nConsulting  Services.  The  Project  will  provide  a  total  of  489  person-months  of \nconsulting  services\u201474  international  and  415  national.  The  international  consultants  will \ncomprise experts in project facilitation (3 person-months), education planning and management \n(18;  this  consultant  will  also  be  the  team  leader),  procurement  (14),  resettlement  (1),  teacher \ntraining  design  and  planning  (16),  ICT  (4),  gender  and  ethnic  minority  education  planning  (8), \nmonitoring and evaluation (6), and scholarship policy and planning (4). The national consultants \nwill  have  expertise  in  national  civil  works  and  procurement  (48  person-months),  construction \nsupervision (51), resettlement (10), school-based INSETT (24), pro-poor PRESETT (48), ethnic \nminority  education  management  (48),  gender  education  management  (24),  scholarship  policy \nand  management  (48),  project  facilitation  and  management  (12),  education  planning  (26), \neducation  management  and  administration  (52),  ICT/EMIS  management  (12),  and  monitoring \nand quality control (12). The consulting services are summarized in Appendix 12 and described \nin  detail  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C.  The  overseas  training  will  be  provided  by  an \ninternational  training  provider,  which  will  be  selected  through  consultant  qualification.  Detailed \nterms of reference and selection criteria for the overseas training provider will be developed by \nNPIU with the assistance of international consultants during implementation. \n \n70. \nThe international and national consultants to be financed under the Project will be selected \nand hired according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime).  For  smooth  start-up,  the project  facilitation  adviser  will be selected and  hired individually  to \nhelp NPIU develop a solid implementation framework. The remaining services will be provided by an \ninternational firm, to be selected and hired through quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS). The \nQCBS weighting will follow the standard quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20.  \n \n71. \nStaff  Development.  The beneficiary schools and BOETs will select participants for the \nin-country training. Female and ethnic minority teachers and administrators will be given priority \nwhen training opportunities arise. For the overseas training, the NPIU will draw up the criteria for \nthe  selection  of  participants  and  a  list  of  candidates  and  submit  these  to  ADB  for  review  and \napproval. The indicators for quality assurance of training content and management, and plan for \ndissemination by the training participants, will be developed and submitted to ADB. Details of all \nthe  teacher  training,  ICT  training,  and  educational  planning  and  management  training  are \nincluded in the staff development plan in Appendix 13.  \n \n72. \nAnticorruption  Policy.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough  its  agents,  any  allegations  of  corruption,  fraud,  collusion,  or  coercion  relating  to  the \nProject.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  will  be \nincluded  in  the  Loan  Agreement  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project will specify the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  In  addition  to  these \nrequirements,  to  deter  corruption  and  increase  transparency,  the  Government  will  disclose \ninformation about public procurement, including that related to the Project, on the procurement \nwebsite.  For  each  contract,  the  list  of  participating  bidders,  the  name  of  the  winning  bidder, \nbasic details on the bidding procedures adopted, the amount of the contract award, and the list \nof goods and services procured, among other things, will be found on the website.  \n\n\f19 \n\n \nDisbursement  Arrangements.  The ADB loan proceeds will be disbursed according to \n73. \nthe procedures in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). \nTo  speed  up  project  implementation  through  the  timely  release  of  loan  proceeds  for  eligible \nexpenditures, a dollar imprest account will be established by the Government at a commercial \nbank chosen by the State Bank of Viet Nam and acceptable to ADB. The ceiling of the account \nand the initial amount deposited in it will not exceed $2 million equivalent. The imprest account \nwill  be  managed  and  administered  by  the  NPIU.  The  statement  of  expenditures  (SOE) \nprocedure  may  be  used  when  seeking  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  and  liquidating \nadvances  made  into  the  imprest  account  according  to  the  guidelines.  Each  payment  to  be \nreimbursed or liquidated under the SOE will not exceed the equivalent of $100,000. The project \nfunds flow arrangement is in Appendix 14. \n \nAccounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting.  MOET,  on  behalf  of  the  Government,  will \n74. \nmaintain separate records and accounts for the Project to identify goods and services financed \nfrom the loan proceeds. Project accounts, including financial statements, and SOE and imprest \naccount  records,  will  be  audited  yearly  by  independent  external  auditors  selected  through  a \ncompetitive procedure acceptable to ADB, according to the provisions of the Loan Agreement. \nThe auditors\u2019 services will be financed from the loan proceeds. The audit report and copies of \nthe  certified  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  no  later  than \n6 months after each fiscal year. The audit report will include the auditors\u2019 opinion on the use of \nloan  proceeds,  compliance  with  loan  covenants,  and  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  under \nADB\u2019s  SOE  procedure.  The  NPIU  will  prepare  monthly  reports  on  project  implementation  and \nsubmit them to ADB. These reports, which will include data on the implementation targets and \ntheir  fulfillment,  problems  and  constraints  faced,  and  proposed  actions  and  solutions,  will  be \nsubmitted  in  English,  in  a  format  acceptable  to  ADB.  Within  3 months  after  the  physical \ncompletion  of  the  Project,  the  NPIU  will  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  providing \ndetails of project implementation, accomplishments, and impact. \n \nProject  Performance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  To  monitor  the  progress  made  by \n75. \nthe  Project  in  achieving  the  outcome,  MOET/NPIU  will  establish  a  project  performance \nmonitoring system using the results-based monitoring indicators from SESMP 2006\u20132010 with \nbaseline information from MOET\u2019s existing benefit monitoring and evaluation system. \n \n76. \nProject  Review.  The  Government  and  ADB  will  undertake  joint  reviews  of  the  Project \nevery 6 months. The reviews will assess progress in component activities, the quality of activities \nand the outputs produced, the performance of the Project and its stakeholders, and the status of \ncompliance  with  loan  covenants;  identify  issues  and  challenges;  and  provide  management  and \ntechnical  advice  and  support.  In  the  third  year  of  the  Project,  the  Government  and  ADB  will \nconduct  a  midterm  review  covering  a  comprehensive  assessment  of  achievements  against  the \nProject\u2019s  expected  impact  and  outcomes,  the  identification  of  possible  loan  savings  and \nreallocation  of  loan  proceeds,  and  the  modification  of  implementation  arrangements  where \nnecessary for the successful completion of the Project. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits and Impact \n\n \nA. \n \n77. \nDirect Beneficiaries. The direct beneficiaries will be the whole LSE-eligible cohort in the \n103 target districts (totaling about 700,000 children aged 11\u201314), who will have better access to \nLSE and good-quality teaching and learning. Output 1 will create more than 65,500 new lower \nsecondary  school  places  and  1,920  new  CEC  places  through  the  construction  of  classrooms. \nOutput 2 will train 170 core trainers from TTCs and 2,900 key teachers from LSSs and CECs to \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\ndevelop minority-focused modules and materials and active-learning teaching methodology. The \nPRESETT courses will cover 6,200 new intake of lower secondary teacher trainees, and 30,000 \nlower secondary teachers will receive cluster school\u2013based INSETT and CPD. More than 8,000 \nstudents, of whom at least half will be girls, will have access to improved semi-boarding facilities \nincluding  food  support  in  the  preharvest  season,  and  867 teachers  (and  their  families)  will \nbenefit from better living conditions in improved teacher housing. Scholarships will be extended \nto 250 ethnic minority TTC students in Output 2, as well as to 800 most needy ethnic minority \nLSS students in Output 3. Output 4 will provide educational planning and management training \nto 1,450 LSS principals and 140 administrators.  \n \n78. \nEducational  Benefits. The Project will have a substantial strategic impact on the three \nkey dimensions of secondary education in the most disadvantaged regions: access and equity, \nquality  and  relevance,  and  efficiency  and  sustainability.  The  direct  benefits  to  the  sector  will \naccrue  from  (i)  significantly  narrowed  gaps  in  access  to  secondary  schooling  between  ethnic, \ngender,  and  socioeconomic  groups,  (ii)  teaching  and  learning  that  is  more  relevant  and  more \nresponsive  to  local  demands,  and  (iii)  strengthened  capacity  of  local  education  authorities  to \nplan,  deliver,  and  manage  education  services.  The  Project  will  introduce,  through  the \nwhole-school  approach,  innovative  and  international  best  practice  pedagogical  concepts  such \nas  CPD,  student-centered  active-learning  methods,  and  cluster  school-based  INSETT. \nEducation  planning  and  management  will  benefit  from  improved  efficiency.  Internal  efficiency \nwill  increase  through  reduced  pupil  repetition  and  dropout  rates  as  well  as  reduced  teacher \nturnover  (a  result  of  improved  teacher  housing).  Learning  support  through  supplementary \ninstructional materials in ethnic minority languages and awareness-raising activities will improve \nlearning outcomes and lower the dropout rate.  \n \nSocial  Benefits.  The  Project  will  give  the  lower  secondary  school  cohort  of  about \n79. \n700,000  ethnic  minority  and  poor  students  the  immediate  benefit  of  a  better  education.  Key \nsocial  benefits  will  accrue  from  significantly  narrowed  gaps  in  access  to  secondary  education \nbetween ethnic and gender groups. The Project will make participation in secondary education \nmore  attractive  to  ethnic  minorities  and  girls  by  (i)  reducing  the  physical  distance  to  schools; \n(ii) providing  more  semi-boarding  facilities,  school  feeding  programs,  and  separate  sanitation \nfacilities  for  males  and  females  in  schools;  (iii)  awarding  scholarships  for  LSE  and  TTCs;  and \n(iv)  improving  teacher  training  and making  it  more  student-centered  and  responsive  to  gender \nand cultural diversity. These initiatives are aimed at addressing some of the demand-side issues \nand  alleviating  the  direct  and  indirect  costs  of  education.  In  addition,  more  ethnic  minority \nteachers, particularly females, will be positive role models for ethnic minority students and will \ndemonstrate  the  tangible  output  of  education.  A  stable  supply  of  qualified  ethnic  minority \nteachers  to  remote  minority  schools  will  help  preserve  minority  languages  and  cultures. \nCommunity  awareness-raising  activities  will  focus  on  demonstrating  the  benefits  of  school \nparticipation. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 15. \n \nimproved \n80. \neducational  attainment,  and  social  benefits  are  most  profound  where  girls\u2019  education  is \nimproved.  The  empirical  record  demonstrates  that  educated  girls  have  reduced  fertility  rates, \nprovide  better  nutrition  for  their  families,  and  are  more  likely  to  use  health  services.  Educated \nmothers  are  more  likely  to  send  their  own  daughters  to  school,  thus  breaking  the \nintergenerational transmission of poverty. Educated young people are better prepared to enter \nthe  labor  market  and  have  increased  earning  potential.  Household  income  is  positively \ncorrelated  with  mean  years  of  schooling,  and  education  reduces  child  labor.  To  maximize  the \nsocial  benefits  of  the  Project,  a  specific  gender  and  ethnic  minority  action  plan  will  be \nimplemented  and  monitored.  Elements  of  the  plan  have  been  mainstreamed  in  the  project \ndesign  and  targets  are  included  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  and  in  the  loan \nassurances. A gender and ethnic minority action plan (GEMAP) is in Appendix 16. \n\nThere  are  considerable  and  well-documented  gains \n\nto  society \n\nfrom \n\n\f21 \n\nEnvironment.  No  negative  environmental  impact  from  the  Project  is  foreseen.  The \n\n \nEconomic  Benefits.  The  major  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  will  be  as  follows: \n81. \n(i) increased  numbers  and  enhanced  productivity  of  secondary  school  graduates,  and \n(ii) improved efficiency of infrastructure, personnel, and resource allocation. The Project will also \nhave  these  other  economic  benefits:  (i)  an  increase  in  the  number  of  secondary  school \ngraduates and participants in the labor market to more than 500,000 yearly; (ii) higher academic \nstandards  of  beneficiaries,  helping  align  the  skills  of  graduates  with  the  market;  (iii)  improved \nearning capacity of low-income groups, helping reduce poverty; (iv) improved cost-effectiveness \nthrough  increased  capacity  utilization  of  LSSs,  reducing  the  unit  cost  and  strengthening \nmanagement;  and  (v)  anticipated  cumulative  savings  of  about  0.5%  of  the  annual  recurrent \ncosts of secondary education. A summary economic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n82. \nInvoluntary  Resettlement. All civil works will take place on existing school grounds or \non government-owned land, and land acquisition and resettlement will not be necessary. New \nschools will be built on vacant public land or commune reserve land. Before the award of civil \nworks  contracts  the  PPIUs  will  check  in  each  case  that  these  procedures  are  followed  and \nprovide  a  written  report  with  contract  documentation  for  ADB\u2019s  endorsement.  ADB  review \nmissions will make spot checks to ensure that the community site selection process has been \nfollowed.  However,  since  not  all  civil  works  sites  have  been  determined,  a  resettlement \nframework  has  been  developed  in  accordance  with  Government  Decree  No.  197/2004/ND-CP \n(issued  on  3  December  2004)  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995).  The \nframework will guide development resettlement plans, if required, under the Project. A summary \nresettlement framework is in Appendix 17. \n \n83. \nProject is therefore categorized as environmental category C. \n \nB. \n \nDemand  for  Education.  One  of  the  risks  of  an  education  project  that  is  aimed  at \n84. \nreaching  the  most  excluded  students  with  new  school  buildings  and  physical  facilities  is  that, \ndespite the facilities, demand for education will remain low. To mitigate this risk, the Project has \nbeen designed to balance supply-side interventions\u2014building schools and teacher and student \nteaching  staff,  etc.\u2014with  demand-side  actions. \naccommodation \nRecognizing  that  for  many  remotely  located  ethnic  minority  families,  demand  for  secondary \neducation  is  very  low,  the  Project  will  implement  a  number  of  demand-side  interventions, \nincluding  scholarship  programs,  a  school  feeding  program  in  the  lean  season,  and  a  public \nawareness campaign to promote the benefits of education.  \n \n85. \nTeacher Retention. In remote schools in the poorest areas, there will always be the risk \nof  low  teacher  retention.  New  teachers  often  put  in  the  required  time  at  remote  schools  and \nleave as soon as possible while the MOET provides them with a slightly higher allowance than \nthe  salaries  at  more  accessible  schools.  The  Project  will  mitigate  one  of  the  main  reasons  for \nteacher  departure,  namely,  poor-quality  teacher  housing.  New  housing  facilities  with  separate \nsanitation  facilities,  new  kitchens,  and  space  for  families  will  encourage  teacher  retention  in \nremote areas. Creating additional incentives for teachers, such as higher salaries or allowances \nfor posts in remote areas, will be the subject of ongoing policy dialogue under the Project.  \n \n86. \nSustainability. Improving the accessibility and quality of education for ethnic minorities \nwill  consume  more  resources  and  higher-than-average  education  expenditure  per  capita. \nProvinces with a high proportion of economically disadvantaged ethnic minorities will not have \nthe  same  capacity  to  pay  for  education  as  those  in  more  economically  advantaged  areas. \nBudget  support  or  targeted  assistance  (or  both)  is  the  only  way  that  these  provinces  can \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\nfacilities,  strengthening \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nachieve  national  education  goals.  Since  a  majority  of  the  ethnic  minorities  still  live  in  poverty, \nmany  below  the  poverty  line,  government  policies  such  as  targeted  scholarships,  fee \nexemptions, and other subsidies for ethnic minorities must continue in the medium term. Lower \nsecondary  semi-boarding  facilities  will  be  required  until  the  LSS  network  has  been  sufficiently \nexpanded into remote communes. Investments will be needed to improve the quality of boarding \nfacilities (satisfactory sanitation and cooking facilities) and educational facilities (classrooms and \nequipment),  provide  more  strategic  teacher  training,  and  develop  appropriate  instructional \nmaterials for ethnic minority groups and disadvantaged districts.  \n \nA  drop  in  the  recurrent  budget  allocations  for  teachers\u2019  salaries  and  the  operation  and \n87. \nmaintenance  of  education  facilities  is  a  medium-term  risk,  since  the  Project  specifically  targets \nrevenue-poor districts and disadvantaged students. The financial contributions expected from the \nbeneficiaries,  to  sustain  project  outputs,  will  be  limited.  However,  analysis  indicates  the \nGovernment\u2019s  sustained  commitment  to  education  in  budgetary  allocations.  In  2006  public \nexpenditure on education reached 20% of total public expenditure. Budget allocation norms cover \neducation expenditures  based on the school-age cohort  with adjustments made for  each region \n(Resolution No. 47/2006/QH11 of the 11th National Assembly 2006 on the National Budget). The \nProject must assume that education will continue to be a priority sector, as set out in SEDP 2006\u2013\n2010  and  the  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy,  and  that  support  for \ntargeted  and  special  assistance  programs  for  disadvantaged  students  will  be  sustained,  toward \nthe achievement of universal LSE targets. Further, the Project is pilot-testing several initiatives to \nassist  the  Government  in  developing  policy  options  for  scholarships  and  tuition  exemptions. \nTherefore, the risk to the sustainability of the project outcome is reduced. \n \n88. \nFiscal Impact. The fiscal impact of the Project is assessed to be limited throughout and \nafter  the  project  period  on  the  following  assumptions:  (i)  education  and  training  expenditure  is \nmaintained  at  the  current  5\u20136%  of  GDP  in  accordance  with  government  commitments; \n(ii) expenditure  for  secondary  education  is  maintained  at  32%  of  education  and  training \nexpenditures;  (iii)  capital  costs  and  recurrent  costs  (including  salaries  and  operating  cost)  are \nstable;  and  (iv)  education  expenditures  will  increasingly  be  focused  on  universal  education  in \nethnic  minority  and  disadvantaged  areas,  where  community  contributions  will  be  limited.  The \nrecurrent costs to be borne by the Government after the Project are estimated at $650,000 per \nyear  and  include  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  new  and  replaced  school  facilities, \nequipment, semi-boarding facilities, and teacher housing. The estimated annual recurrent costs \nafter  project  implementation  account  for  0.13%  of  the  secondary  education  operating  cost  in \n2013\u20132020. This level of costs is sustainable, given the size of the projected education budget. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n89. \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\nThe  Government  will  provide  counterpart  funds  for  project  implementation  on \ntime.

The  comments  and  suggestions  of  the \nAffected People and communities will be taken into account during the design and \nimplementation phases of the resettlement activities. To ensure that all grievances \nof  the  Affected  People  on  any  aspect  of  land  acquisition,  compensation, \nrelocation, and determination and payment of entitlements are resolved in a timely \nand satisfactory manner, and that all avenues for airing grievances are available \nto the Affected People, the Government will set up a mechanism under the Project \nto deal with any such grievances during Project implementation. \n\n\f25 \n\n \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nB. \n \n90. \nThe  Government,  through  MOET,  will  have  established  and  set  up  the  NPIU  and \nappointed  a  full-time  project  manager,  a  deputy  project  manager  and  key  technical  staff \nincluding  an  appropriate  number  of  experts  in  finance,  procurement,  civil  works,  staff \ndevelopment,  social  and  community  development,  and  ICT  and/or  education  management \ninformation systems, whose experience and qualifications are acceptable to ADB. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n91. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  and  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove the loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR31,860,000 to the Socialist Republic of \nViet Nam for the Lower Secondary Education for the Most Disadvantaged Regions Project from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of \n8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n\nLiqun Jin \nVice President  \n\n16 November 2007 \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nANALYSIS OF THE EDUCATION SECTOR \n\n1. \nSector Overview. In Viet Nam, education is viewed as strongly linked to economic growth \nand  it  has  been  accorded  priority  as  a  principal  investment  option  for  long-term  socioeconomic \ndevelopment.  The  central  pillar  of  the  national  education  policy  is  rapid  human  resource \ndevelopment  to  meet  the  labor  needs  of  a  highly  competitive  market  economy  within  a  socialist \nframework to ensure a high level of equity. One of Viet Nam\u2019s advantages today is its educated, \nskilled, and low-cost workforce, but this amounts to only 27% of the national labor force, compared \nwith 50% in some other developing countries in the region.1 To maintain this advantage in the face \nof regional and global competition, the Government plans to increase the percentage of the skilled \nworkforce to 30% by 2007, 40% by 2010, and 60% by 2020. However, the key factor determining \nwhether  Viet  Nam  will  be  able  to  maintain  this  advantage  is  whether  the  education  provided  will \nmake  the  workforce  competitive  in  terms  of  the  creative  and  analytical  skills  needed  in  a \nknowledge- and technology-based industrial economy. \n \n2. \nThe  importance  of  education  and  training  is  also  recognized  in  the  achievement  of \nMillennium  Development  Goal  (MDGs)  and  Viet  Nam  Development  Goal  (VDGs).  Viet  Nam  has \nalready achieved poverty targets, halving income poverty and largely eradicating extreme poverty \nand  hunger.  Good  progress  has  also  been  made  toward  achieving  other  social  goals  such  as \nuniversal  primary  education,  gender  equality,  child  mortality,  and  maternal  health,  and  improving \naccess  to  safe  drinking  water.  Progress  is  being  made  toward  combating  HIV/AIDS  and  other \ncommunicable  diseases,  and  mainstreaming  environment  sustainability  in  national  policies  and \nprograms. \n \n3. \nDespite  these  achievements,  increased  efforts  will  be  required  to  ensure  that  key  MDGs \nrelated to child mortality, safe drinking water, the environment, and HIV/AIDS control are met,2 and \nto improve the quality of key services such as education. The MDGs and VDGs established several \ndevelopment targets related to education3 including: (i) universal primary education, as measured \nby  the  net  enrollment  rate  (NER),  by  2015;  (ii)  universal  progression  to  grade  5  by  2015; \n(iii) universal  youth  (aged  15\u201324)  literacy  by  2015;  (iv)  gender  parity  in  primary  and  secondary \nschool  by  2005;  (v)  gender  parity  in  youth  literacy;  (vi)  reduced  child  mortality  and  child \nmalnutrition; and (vii) reduced inequality among ethnic minorities and preservation of the ability to \nread and write in the ethnic languages. \n \n4. \nEducation  and  Training  System  and  Structure.  The  national  education  and  training \nsystem  is  all-encompassing,  ranging  from  the  nursery  to  doctorate  programs,  and  from  formal \nschooling and training to nonformal and continuing education. There are four levels of schooling: \n(i) pre-primary,  catering  to  students  aged  3\u20135  years;  (ii)  5-year  primary  education  from  age  6; \n(iii) 4-year  lower  secondary  education  (LSE)  schooling;  and  (iv)  a  3-  or  4-year  upper  secondary \neducation (USE) phase, where students are enrolled in either (a) an upper secondary school with a \nfocus  on  higher  education,  or  (b)  a  professional  secondary  school  with  a  focus  on  vocational \ntraining. To ensure the achievement of an acceptable standard, some students may repeat a year, \nwith  a  low  general  repetition  rate  for  lower  secondary  students  of  0.8%  but  with  marked  regional \ndifferences. To cater to students who drop out of school but wish either to continue their education \nin  a  less  formal  setting  or  to  qualify  for  re-enrollment  in  formal  education,  nonformal  education \nprograms  have  been  established  and  operate  nationally  in  over  4,000  venues  using  a  modified \ncurriculum.  \n\n                                                 \n1   Address by Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung before the National Assembly, 27 November 2006. \n2   An  assessment  of \n\nthe  current  status  of  progress \n\nfound  at \nwww.undp.org.vn/mdg/mdgvne.htm.

Ministry  of  Education  and  Training  (MOET)  has  overall \nresponsibility  for  the  education  sector  and  sets  broad  policy  directions  for  all  levels  of  education. \nHowever,  management  responsibility  for  school  buildings,  staffing,  and  distribution  of  financial \nresources has been progressively decentralized. Universities are managed directly by MOET, but \nupper  secondary  and  professional  secondary  schools  are  managed  at  the  provincial  level  by  the \ndepartments  of  education  and  training  (DOETs),  while  lower  secondary  schools  and  primary \nschools are managed locally at the district or commune level by bureaus of education and training \n(BOETs). Service provision has become increasingly decentralized and increasing revenue raising \npowers at the local level.   \n \nSchool funding is a complex process with revenue provided at the state, province, and local \n6. \nlevel. Funds provided by the state are distributed in line with a per capita index weighted according \nto  degree  of  economic  disadvantage.  The  funds  are  supplemented  at  the  local  level  through  the \napplication  of  fees  that  cover  the  necessary  teaching  and  learning  expenses  and  school \n\n \n\n \nAge \n27 \n26 \n25 \n24 \n23 \n22 \n21 \n20 \n19 \n18 \n17 \n16 \n15 \n14 \n13 \n12 \n11 \n10 \n9 \n8 \n7 \n6 \n5 \n4 \n3 \n2 yrs \n2 months \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\ndevelopment.  Through  targeted  programs,  the  state  provides  fee  relief  and  scholarships  for \nstudents  who  are  policy  beneficiaries  such  as  ethnic  minorities,  students  who  live  in  difficult \ncircumstances, and excellent learners at all levels of schooling, in public and nonpublic schools.  \n \n7. \nFormal  education  is  mostly  provided  by  the  Government  through  state-run  schools.  But \nnonpublic  institutions  also  operate  at  all  educational  levels,  from  early  childhood  care  to  higher \neducation.  The  Government  encourages  the  development  of  nonpublic  schools  as  a  matter  of \npolicy,  although  the  education  law  states  that  private,  people-funded,  and  semipublic  schools  all \nbelong  to  and  contribute  to  the  national  education  system.  As  part  of  the  national  system, \nnonpublic  schools benefit  from  incentive  policies  for  facilities,  land,  taxes,  fees,  credit,  insurance, \nand  commendation  and  reward  systems  according  to  government  regulations.  The  same \nexpectations and laws apply to both public and nonpublic schools in implementing the objectives, \ncontent, curriculum, textbooks, teaching methods, and regulations relating to enrollment, teaching \nand learning, examinations, completion requirements, diploma certification, and other matters.  \n \n8. \nEducation  Sector  Policy  Framework  and  Goals.  To  improve  both  the  quality  and \naccessibility of education, the Government passed a new education law on 14 June 2005 outlining \nthe  goals  and  principles  of  education.  A  number  of  supporting  policy  documents  also  help  guide \neducational  decision  making.  For  secondary  education,  the  most  relevant  are:  (i)  the  MDGs  and \nVDGs, (ii) the Education Strategic Development Plan 2001\u20132010, (iii) the National Action Plan for \nEducation  for  All  2003\u20132015,  (iv)  the  5-year  Strategic  Education  Development  Plan  2006\u20132010, \nand (v) the Secondary Education Sector Master Plan 2006\u20132010. \n \n9. \nSecondary  Education  and  Ethnic  Minorities.  The  Government  has  paid  attention  to \nethnic minority education since its founding. The first constitution of Viet Nam (1946) stated: \u201cThe \nethnic  minority  nationals  have  the  right  to  receive  compulsory  and  fee-free  primary  and  lower \nsecondary  education  in  the  local  schools  by  means  of  their  languages.\u201d  Since  then,  numerous \ndecrees  and  decisions  have  been  issued  and  ratified  confirming  the  importance  of  education  for \nethnic  minorities.  In  spite  of  these  high-level  policies,  the  outcomes  for  ethnic  minorities  in \neducation  at  all  levels  remain  well  below  the  national  average.  The  accessibility  and  quality  of \neducation are particularly affected by the poverty that often afflicts ethnic minority communities, as \nwell as geographical isolation and other cultural barriers. \n \nBarriers  to  Education  Access  and  Quality.  Household  poverty  level  is  an  indicator  of \n10. \neducation  outcome,  as  poor  families  experience  more  difficulty  in  meeting  both  the  direct  cost  of \neducation  and  the  opportunity  cost.  Poor  areas  often  coincide  with  a  concentration  of  ethnic \nminorities. 75% of ethnic minorities live in poverty, and women are particularly disadvantaged. An \nestimate  of  the  poverty  rate  in  Viet  Nam  by  2010  puts  it  at  21%  of  the  population,  and  ethnic \nminorities will account for nearly 40% of the poor, close to three times their share of the population. \nThe Central Highlands and Northern Mountain regions are the poorest regions. Poverty rates vary \nbetween ethnic minority groups. The poorest ethnic minorities are the Ba Na, the Ede, the Gia-rai, \nand  the  Co  Ho  in  the  Central  Highlands,  and  the  Hmong  and  Muong  in  the  Northern  Mountain \nregion. Ethnic minority groups in the Mekong River Delta, on the other hand, have experienced a \nsteady decline in poverty and have the lowest rate of poverty among the ethnic minority regions. \nEthnic minorities in the Northern Mountain region have experienced the steadiest improvement in \nliving standards, but poverty among groups in the Central Highlands has increased.4  \n \n11. \nEnrollment.  In  LSE,  ethnic  minorities  now  compose  14%  of  enrollment,  equivalent  to  the \nproportion of ethnic minorities in the population as a whole. Current data on completion rates are not \navailable. Ethnic minorities constitute 13.9% of enrollments at LSE and 12% of enrollment in USE, a \nlittle  below  their  overall  share  of  the  population.  These  enrollment  figures  are  likely  to  include \n\n                                                 \n4   A collapse in coffee prices has been a factor in the economic development of the Central Highlands. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n29 \n\nsignificant overage enrollment, as ethnic minorities in remote areas often delay the enrollment of their \nchildren in primary school because of the distances needed to travel to school, and ethnic minorities \nalso  experience  higher  rates  of  repetition  at  the  primary  level,  leading  to  overage  entry  into  LSE. \nThus, correct-age enrollment for ethnic minorities is likely to be lower than these figures, although no \ndata  are  available  to  ascertain  this.  While  the  data  can  be  treated  only  as  estimates,  they  show  a \nsignificant  gap  between  the  ethnic  minority  school-age  population  and  the  minority  share  of \nenrollment for the provinces of Ha Giang, Gia Lai, Dak Nong, and Binh Phuoc. For these provinces, \nthe share of ethnic minority LSE enrollment is significantly below the estimated ethnic minority share \nof the school-age cohort.  \n \n12. \nSchool  enrollment  rates  vary  between  groups,  but  enrollment  rates  for  ethnic  minorities \n(non-Kinh  and  Hoa)  are  typically  lower  than  the  national  average  and  often  show  gender \nimbalances.5 For  all  groups  except  the  Ba  Na,  the  rates  for  girls  are slightly  lower  than  those  for \nboys. Girls\u2019 primary NER substantially lag behind those for boys for three ethnic minority groups in \nthe Northern Uplands\u2014the Dao, the Thai, and the Hmong. These rates can be expected to have \nimproved over the last 5 years, reflecting the increasing rates of enrollment. However, the pattern \nis  likely  to  have  remained  similar,  with  the  Hmong  and  Dao  still  showing  lower  enrollment  rates \nthan  other  ethnic  minority  groups.  The  provinces  that  show  lower  rates  of  ethnic  minority \nenrollment  at  USE  level  are  those  with  concentrations  of  Dao,  Hmong,  and  Khmer.  These \nprovinces are Lao Cai and Yen Bai in the Northeast, all of the Northwest provinces (Dien Bien, Lai \nChau,  Son  La),  and  Tra  Vinh  and  Soc  Trang  in  the  Mekong  River  Delta.  The  Central  Highlands \nprovinces (Kon Tum and Gia Lai) also show difficulties in the ethnic minority transition to USE. \n \n13. \nIssues  to  Be  Addressed.  Improving  the  accessibility  and  quality  of  education  for  ethnic \nminorities  will  consume  more  resources  as  these  children  face  considerable  obstacles  to  the \nsuccessful  completion  of  education  of  a  national  level  of  quality.  Higher-than-average  education \nexpenditure per capita will be required for ethnic minority children. Provinces with a high proportion \nof  economically  disadvantaged  ethnic  minorities  do  not  have  the  same  capacity  to  pay  for \neducation as those in more economically advantaged areas. Targeted assistance is the only way \nthat these provinces can achieve national education goals. Future expansion of school-level non-\nsalary  recurrent  expenditure  will  be  through  school-raised  fees.  Government  policies  such  as \nscholarships  and  fee  exemptions  may  be  expanded.  Standardizing  the  funding  mechanism  may \nadd  clarity  to  education  financing  initiatives  for  ethnic  minorities,  while  allowing  for  provincial \nvariations. This will also ensure that support can be targeted to the ethnic minorities with the lowest \neducational outcomes. \n \nEnough  Funds  to  Provide  Good-Quality  Education.  A  mechanism  for  tracking \n14. \nexpenditure  on  ethnic  minority  students  at  the  school  level  would  enable  the  monitoring  of  the \neffectiveness of educational expenditure. Expansion to full-day schooling needs to be supported by \nthe state budget rather than by community financing if it is be affordable to poor and ethnic minority \nstudents.  LSE  semi-boarding  facilities  will  be  required  until  the  lower  secondary  school  network \nhas  been  sufficiently  expanded  into  remote  communes.  Investment  in  good-quality  support \nfacilities  (e.g.,  library  and  homework  facilities,  satisfactory  sanitation  and  cooking  facilities  in \nteacher  housing)  is  required,  in  addition  to  improving  the  quality  of  the  educational  facilities \n(classrooms,  special  function  rooms,  and  equipment).  More  strategic  teacher  training  including \npro-poor material development and school-based in-service training is also considered quite useful \nin most ethnic minority areas in the country, where teachers and education planners have limited \nopportunities to upgrade their skills and capacity to meet ethnic minority needs.  \n\n                                                 \n5   According to the latest disaggregated data (1999) on net enrollment rates in lower secondary education among ethnic \n\nminority males and females. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE EDUCATION SECTOR\n(2001\u2013Present)\n\nPre-Primary\n\nPrimary\n\nSecondary \n\nHigher\n\nNonformal\n\nOthers\n\n  Multilateral Donors\n\n2nd Lower Secondary Education Development \nProject, $55 million, Loan, 2004\u20132010: Upper \nSecondary Education Development Project, $55 \nmillion, Loan, 2002\u20132009: Technical and \nVocational Education Project, $50 million, Loan, \n1999\u20132008: Secondary Education Sec\n\nTeacher \nTraining\n\nTeacher Training \nProject, $25 \nmillion, Loan, \n1999\u20132007: Upper \nSecondary and \nProfessional \nTeacher \nDevelopment \nProject, $33 \nmillion, Loan, \n2006\u20132011             \n\nPolicy Research \non Teacher \nManagement, n.a., \nGrant, 2005\u20132008\n\nEducation for All, \n$96,000, Grant, \n2001\u20132010\n\nEducational Innovation for \nDevelopment Program, \nn.a., Grant, 2004\u20132008\n\nSecondary Education Sector Master Plan, \nAdvisory Support, 2006\u20132010\n\n3\n0\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n2\n\ni\n\nPrimary Education for \nDisadvantaged Children \nProject, n.a., Loan, \n2003\u20132009: Education for \nAll Plan Information \nWorkshop, $49,000, \nGrant, 2002\u20132003\n\nSupport to the Renovation \nof Education \nManagement, 2006\u20132009, \n\u20ac10 million\n\nEarly Childhood \nDevelopment, n.a., \nGrant, 2006\u20132010\n\nChild Friendly Primary \nEducation, $3.9 million, \nGrant, 2006\u20132010\n\nSecondary Education Sector Master Plan, \nAdvisory Support, 2006\u20132010\n\nCapacity Building in Provincial \nEducational Planning, $83,000, \nGrant, 2003\u20132004: Various \nInitiatives Supporting Cultural \nActivities, $179,000, Grant, \n2002\u20132003\n\nCommunity \nLearning \nCenters for \nPoverty \nReduction, \n$220,000, \nGrant, \n2003\u20132004\n\nPrimary Teacher \nDevelopment, $35 \nmillion, Loan, \n2001\u20132005\n\n2nd Higher Education \nProject, $70 million, \nLoan, 2007\u20132012\n\nCapacity Building in Provincial \nEducational Planning, \n$200,000, Grant, 2003\u20132009: \nTargeted Budget Support, $50 \nmillion, Loan, 2006\u20132010\n\nAdolescent \nDevelopment & \nParticipation, \n$3.2 million, \nGrant, \n2006\u20132010\n\nEuropean Studies Programme \nin Viet Nam, $1.4 million, \nGrant, 2001\u20132004 \n\nADB\n\nUNESCO\n\nWB\n\nUNICEF\n\nEU\n\n\fPre-Primary\n\nPrimary\n\nSecondary \n\nHigher\n\nNonformal\n\nOthers\n\nTeacher \nTraining\n\n  Bilateral Donors\n\nSecondary Education Sector Master Plan, \nAdvisory Support, 2006\u20132010\n\nPrimary Education In \nNorthern Areas, $4.4 \nmillion, Grant, 2007: \nStrengthening Cluster-\nbased  School \nManagement, n.a., Grant, \n2004\u20132007: Dispatch of \nExpert, $15 million, Grant, \n2002\u20132003\n\nModernization of four vocational training centers,\n$15 million, Grant, 2000\u20132003\n\nSupport to Ha Noi \nIndustrial College, $9.2 \nmillion, Grant, \n1999\u20132005: \nStrengthening the \nCapacity of Hanoi \nUniversity of Technology,\nn.a.

The  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  9099-VIE:  Expansion  of  the \n2. \nLearning  Opportunities  for  Ethnic  Minority  Youth  Program  has  pilot-tested  a  new  transitional \nprogram. The program builds on the successes of the transitional program, \u2014a scholarship program \nfor  upper  secondary  school  (USS)  ethnic  minority  students  who  hope  to  go  to  teacher  training \ncolleges (TTCs) to become lower secondary school (LSS) teachers in their communes\u2014 which was \nimplemented under Loan 1718-VIE: Teacher Training Project. The objectives of the program are to \n(i) reduce  socioeconomic  barriers  for  minority  youth  in  gaining  access  to  and  completing  teacher \ntraining, (ii) enhance their readiness for TTCs, (iii) supply qualified minority teachers to meet local \nneeds, and (iv) raise awareness among minority youth and encourage them to take an active role in \ncommunity development initiatives. \n \n3. \nProgram  Description.  Under  the  new  transitional  program,  minority  USS  students  (50% \nfemale) in grade 12 will be selected as candidate scholarship recipients. The students will undergo \nTTC preparatory courses. Those students who successfully enter TTC will receive the scholarship. \nA scholarship amount of $455 will be allocated per student per year, with $300 going directly to the \nstudent  and  $155  to  the  TTC.  The  program  will  continue  the  work  of  the  pilot,  including:  (i) \nidentifying beneficiaries who meet the agreed selection criteria; (ii) conducting a tracer study for the \nbeneficiary  students,  assessing  its  impact,  and  making  recommendations  for  future  scholarship \npolicies; and (iii) mitigating the shortage of qualified minority teachers in their communities.  \n \nSelection  Criteria. Selection procedures and committee memberships will be the same as \n4. \nthose  under  the  new  transitional  program.  Ministry  of  Education  and  Training  (MOET)  has \ndeveloped selection criteria authorized by interministerial circular No. 04/2001/TTLT-BGD&DT from \nthe  Department  of  Human  Resources,  Office  of  the  Government  and  Ethnic  Minority  Committee, \nand  MOET,  on  the  enrollment  of  ethnic  minority  students  in  the  transitional  program  to \npostsecondary  institutions.  The  selection  is  based  on  household  income,  gender,  commuting \ndistance,  age  limitation,  and  other  poverty  indicators  of  ethnic  minority  families.  The  selection \ncommittees  are  composed  of  people\u2019s  committee  members,  the  provincial  departments  of \neducation,  and  other  provincial  offices  of  the  steering  committee  ministries.  The  committees  are \nresponsible for transparent and appropriate beneficiary identification. \n \n5. \nCost  and  Time  Frame. The overall cost of the program will be $0.46 million. Details of the \ncost of the output are provided in the cost estimates for the Project. No civil works are planned and \nno equipment or furniture is expected to be purchased. The program, to be financed by the Project, \nwill cover 48 months, or 4 academic years, beginning in the third year of LSEMDR. \n \nExpected  Outputs.  The  program  will  have  the  following  outputs:  (i)  250  ethnic  minority \n6. \nstudents  will  benefit  from  the  new  transitional  program  and  enter  TTCs,  and  (ii)  90%  of  the \nbeneficiary students will complete the pre-service program and become schoolteachers. \n \nSustainability. MOET will undertake a tracer study to evaluate the impact and effectiveness \n7. \nof the pilot new transitional program after the graduation of scholarship students from the TTCs. In \nthe long term, the Government will have to develop a sustainable cost-recovery scholarship scheme \nin  which  the  beneficiaries  will  be  expected  to  return  the  scholarship  expenses  to  the  Government \n\n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nPilot Scholarship Program for the Smallest Ethnic Minority Groups \n\nonce they become teachers. This will allow the program to benefit a larger number of students and \ndiscussion on a long-term policy on scholarship and incentives programs will be facilitated. \n \nB. \n \nBackground. The proposed program is aimed at addressing the particular problems faced \n8. \nby  the  smallest  ethnic  minority  groups  by  developing  a  new  scholarship  scheme  for  minority \nstudents  to  attend  secondary  school.  The  Government  has  identified  the  21  smallest  minority \ngroups (those whose total population is less than 15,000) as those most in need of assistance. The \nmost  recent  statistics  back  this  up,  clearly  showing  that  the  smallest  population  groups  have  the \nhighest poverty head count and the widest poverty gap. The pilot scholarship program will examine \nthe impact of funding on enrollment and the progression of the selected minority students. \n \nProgram  Description.  The  program  will  provide  scholarships  to  800  lower  secondary \n9. \nstudents, at least 50% of whom are girls, from the most disadvantaged (i.e., the smallest) minority \ngroups.  The  unit  cost  of  assistance  for  the  program  will  be  $200  per  year.  Individual  student \nallowances will consist of a daily living allowance and a small amount for clothing and bedding. The \nProject will identify beneficiaries among the eligible minority group students in grade 5 who want to \ncontinue  their  studies  and  who  meet  the  agreed  selection  criteria.  The  beneficiaries  will  receive \nscholarships beginning in grade 6 for the duration of their LSS.  \n \nSelection  Criteria.  All  grade  5  students  belonging  to  the  smallest  minority  groups  will  be \n10. \neligible, provided they do not fall under other government scholarship initiatives.1 The pilot program \nwill include the following selection guidelines: (i) at least 50% of beneficiaries will be girls; (ii) as far \nas  possible,  at  least  50%  of  beneficiaries  will  be  semi-boarding  or  homestay  students  living  away \nfrom  home  during  the  school  week;  and  (iii)  the  proportions  of  beneficiaries  will  reflect  the \nproportions of ethnic minority groups in the district to the extent possible.  \n \n11. \nCost and Time Frame. The overall cost of the program will be $0.64 million. No civil works \nare planned and no purchases of equipment or furniture are expected. Cost details are provided in \nthe cost estimates for the Project. The program, to be financed by the Project, will cover 48 months.  \n \n12. \nExpected  Outputs.  The  output  of  the  pilot  program  will  be  data  showing  the  effect  of \nfunding  on  student  retention  and  achievement  in  the  smallest  minority  groups.  The  data  will  feed \ninto discussions on long-term scholarship policy. Assessment indicators will pertain to the number of \nminority students supported by the new program, and percentages of the beneficiary students who \ncomplete  LSS.  Data  will  be  disaggregated  by  gender  and  ethnic  minority.  The  pilot  program  is \nexpected  to  have  the  following  specific  outputs:  (i)  800  minority  students  will  receive  the  pilot \nscholarship, and (ii) 90% will complete LSS. \n \n13. \nSustainability.  The  anticipated  development  impact  of  the  program  will  be  measured  in \nterms of whether students continue their studies beyond LSS. MOET will undertake a tracer study to \nevaluate  the  impact  and  effectiveness  of  the  pilot  scholarship  program  on  each  student  within  2 \nyears  of  the  last  payment  of  the  scholarship.  The  program  will  complement  ongoing  project \ncomponents including the construction of secondary school facilities, support for pre- and in-service \ntraining, and capacity building for targeted assistance to disadvantaged groups.  \n\n                                                 \n1  In  2005,  the  minister  of  the  Committee  of  Ethnic  Minorities  issued  Decisions  291\u2013296  approving  the  provision  of \nscholarships  to  support  the  smallest  minorities.  Government  scholarships  will  go  to  students  from  the  five  smallest \nminorities\u2014Brau and Ro Mang in Kon Tum province; Odu in Nghe An province; Pu Beo in Ha Giang province; and Si La \nin the provinces of Dien Bien and Lai Chau. The scholarship amounts are D30,000 for kindergarten; D45,000 for primary \nschool;  and  D160,000  for  both  LSS  and  USS.  The  funds  flow  arrangements  involve  transfers  from  the  Ministry  of \nFinance  to  the  provincial  budget.  Minority  parents  can  collect  the  money  directly  from  the  commune  poverty  reduction \nteam, with prior approval from the commune people\u2019s committee. \n\n \n\n\fPROJECT RESULTS-BASED MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nObjective \n\nActivity/Input \n\nOutput \n\nOutcome/Impact \n\nTargets \n\n \nA.

In  the \npast,  official  development  assistance  project  areas  were  often  selected  as  \u201cdisadvantaged \nprovinces\u201d  by  the  Government.  However,  the  project  survey  shows  significant  intra-provincial \ndisparities:  the  social  and  education  conditions  are  often  far  more  severe  in  some  districts \nbelonging to relatively wealthy provinces than in better-off districts in poorer provinces. With the \nconventional  target  selection,  the  poor  districts  from  the  \u201cnon-disadvantaged  provinces\u201d  would \nnot  be  core  targets.  The  Project  identifies  \u201cthe  most  disadvantaged  districts\u201d  rather  than \nprovinces,  using  comprehensive  pro-poor  indicators.  As  agreed  with  the  Government,  the \nselection criteria are (i) socioeconomic indicators; (ii) education indicators; and (iii) other factors, \nsuch  as  availability  of  support  from  the  Government  or  donor  partners,  geographic  balance, \npriority in government policies, and priority among natural disaster-prone regions. \n \n2. \nInitial  Selection.  Two  processes  were  followed  in  selecting  the  initial  set  of  candidate \nprovinces:  (i)  scoring  according  to  ranking  of  provinces  by  each  criterion;  and  (ii)  scoring \naccording to absolute data for each criterion, with no ranking. A comparison of the results of the \ntwo  processes  gave  a  total  of  16  candidate  provinces  that  met  the  criteria  of  being \nsocioeconomically  disadvantaged  and  in  need  of  assistance  in  reaching  universal  lower \nsecondary education (LSE). In addition to the 16 \u201cpriority provinces,\u201d four other provinces were \nproposed for inclusion in the list. Finally, geographic criteria were applied to ensure that there \nwas  a  reasonable  distribution  of  candidate  provinces  among  the  regions:  northern  (eight \ncandidates), central (seven), and southern (seven). \n \nInitial  Survey  Data.  Information  was  collected  from  candidate  districts  in  two  parts: \n3. \n(i) standard  district  data  on  population,  physical  characteristics,  and  socioeconomic  indicators \ndisaggregated  by  gender  and  population  group;  and  (ii)  specific  information  on  students, \nteachers, physical facilities and equipment, etc., through a specifically designed questionnaire. \nThe  data  sets  are  available  in  the  midterm  report\u2014though  some  of  the  data  are  clearly \ninaccurate.  \n \n4. \nScoring.  The  criteria  used  to  identify  target  districts  were  basically  the  same  as  those \nused in the initial selection of provinces, with a focus on a high ratio of poor households, high \nratio  of  communes  with  no  lower  secondary  school  (LSS),  low  coverage  of  LSE,  and  low \nenrollment figures, especially for girls, as well as gross enrollment ratio. Cleaned data from the \nsurvey  were  used  in  assigning  scores  against  percentage  values  calculated  from  the  data \nreceived from the districts. Where data for a district were missing or clearly wrong, an average \nfor the other districts in the province was calculated and applied. \n \nThe  percentage  of  poor  households  was  deemed  to  be  a  better  district  socioeconomic \n5. \nindicator than per capita income. In response to comments obtained during the midterm report \nworkshop,  \u201caverage  distance  to  school\u201d  was  used,  to  give  greater  weight  to  access.  In  the \nsouthern regions, limitations to access are a function of terrain (e.g., river crossings) rather than \ndistance from the school, so scoring was designed to eliminate this variation. An additional two \ncriteria  were  added  (class-classroom  ratio  and  number  of  new  classrooms  needed)  after \ndiscussions with Ministry of Education and Training (MOET).  \n \nFinal Selection of Proposed Districts. For each district, the total score obtained from \n6. \nall  criteria  was  calculated,  and  the  districts  were  ranked  in  order  of  vulnerability  (most \ndisadvantaged = ranking 1; least disadvantaged = ranking 197). The final selection approved by \nMOET comprises 103 of the neediest districts in Viet Nam from 17 provinces. \n\n \n\n\fFigure A6: Selection Criteria and Procedure to Identify Target Provinces and

The  5-year  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan \n2006\u20132010 targets universal  secondary  education (lower secondary  by 2010  and upper and professional secondary \neducation  by  2015)  as  a  key  priority.  Special  emphasis  is  placed  on  reaching  ethnic  minorities  in  remote  areas  for \nequitable and inclusive development. Access to secondary schooling has expanded significantly in recent years, but \nnational  averages  mask  significant  disparities  in  enrollment,  which  is  unevenly  distributed  by  ethnic  group,  gender, \nsocioeconomic  status,  and  location.  Poverty  analysis  conducted  for  the  Secondary  Education  Sector  Master  Plan \n(SESMP) 2006\u20132010 shows that household income is strongly correlated with educational attainment. Ethnic minority \nyouth, and particularly girls, remain the most disadvantaged in secondary education. They have for the most part not \nbenefited from economic growth and poverty reduction, and risk falling further behind if secondary education remains \nout of reach. \nB. \n \nWith  the  goal  of  targeting  disadvantaged  districts  in  Viet  Nam,  extensive  poverty  analysis  and  consultation  was \nundertaken,  including  (i)  a  survey  of  socioeconomic  and  education  data  from  all  districts  in  20  provinces  in  the \nregions  that  were  identified  as  disadvantaged\u2014the  Northern  Mountain  region  (comprising  the  Northwest  and \nNortheast regions), the Central Highlands, the Mekong River Delta, and one province in the Southeast Region; (ii) an \nanalysis  of  statistical  data  from  the  Government  Statistics  Office  (GSO) and  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  Training \n(MOET);  (iii) a  review  of  surveys,  studies,  and  reports  from  other  projects;  (iv)  background  work  done  for  SESMP \n2006\u20132010;  and  (v) field  visits  to  selected  districts  and  communes.  The  Project\u2019s  rigorous  district-level  selection \nmethodology (see Appendix 5) is unique among education projects in Viet Nam and lends the design a strong poverty \nfocus. \n \nEthnic  and  Geographic  Aspects  of  Poverty. Viet Nam had a population of more than 83 million in 2005, with an \nannual  growth  rate  of  1.4%.  An  ethno-linguistically  diverse  range  of  53  ethnic  minorities  compose  14%  of  the \npopulation.  For  the  most  part,  minorities  reside  in  remote,  mountainous  regions,  along  the  northern  and  western \nborders  with northeast Cambodia, the People\u2019s Republic of China, and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. The \nKhmer,  who  live  in  the  lowlands  of  the  Mekong  River  Delta,  and  the  Cham,  who  mostly  reside  along  the  Central \nCoast and Delta region, are exceptions. With Viet Nam\u2019s impressive growth and poverty reduction there has been a \nshift in the locus of poverty from being widespread throughout the population to being localized in specific groups that \nare  harder  to  reach.  Minorities  are  particularly  vulnerable.  In  2004  the  national  poverty  incidence  was  26%  in  rural \nareas and 14% in urban areas (Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey 2004, based on the government poverty \nstandard of D200,000 per capita per month in rural areas and D260,000 per capita per month in urban areas). There \nare  dramatic  regional  disparities  in  poverty  incidence,  e.g.,  52%  in  the  Northwest  vs.  6%  in  the  Southeast.  Poverty \nincidence in the Northeast and Central Highlands stood at 29% and 33%, respectively. Minorities compose one third \nof all poor people\u2014the poverty gap for minorities is 19%, compared with 3% for poor Kinh. If current trends persist, \nby  2010  poverty  will  predominantly  be  related  to  ethnicity.  The  VHLSS  2004  data  confirm  that  the  smallest  ethnic \nminority groups (e.g., those with a population of less than 15,000) are also the poorest. \n \nPoverty and Education. Poverty among minority groups is closely associated with low or limited access to education \nand  training  opportunities.  The  VLHSS  2004  found  that  only  29%  of  ethnic  minority  adults  aged  18  and  over  had \ncompleted lower secondary education. The main barriers to access are lack of infrastructure, physical inaccessibility, \nlanguage  and  cultural  barriers,  a  lack  of  good-quality  teachers,  a  curriculum  that  is  not  suited  to  local  needs  or \nlanguages,  and  high  costs  (direct,  indirect,  and  opportunity  costs),  coupled  with  the  perception  that  returns  from \neducation are low. Education indicators for minorities are well below average, and lower still for minority girls. Where \nKinh boys have 8.5 mean years of schooling, minority girls have only 4.5. Dropout rates are higher for minorities, and \nhighest for minority girls. For those who can afford secondary schooling, physical distance means having to board at \nschool or in private homes, at least during the week. Semi-boarding at school is particularly difficult for girls because \nof  security  and  privacy  concerns.  Sociocultural  factors  also  play  a  role  in  keeping  girls  out  of  school:  minority  girls \ntend  to  marry  early,  especially  in  the  Hmong  culture.  Many  children  drop  out  of  school  in  the  absence  of  parental \nencouragement  and  discipline,  and  when  parents  do  not  see  the  relevance  of  education  they  do  not  object. \nOpportunity costs become higher as children enter their teens and are needed for agricultural work, or child care in  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n \nthe case of girls. Increasingly, opportunities for nonagricultural work may also be having an effect, especially in areas \nlike the Southeast and the Mekong River Delta, where economic growth is fastest. \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n Yes \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nADB TA 4603: Strategic Secondary Education Planning and Cooperation supported MOET in the preparation of the \nSecondary  Education  Sector  Master  Plan  (SESMP)  2006\u20132010  in  close  consultation  with  a  broad  array  of \nstakeholders  from  government  agencies,  provincial  departments  of  education  and  training,  provincial  people\u2019s \ncommittees,  and  the  key  development  partners  in  the  education  sector  (United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific,  and \nCultural  Organisation,  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund,  and  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency).

The Project is specifically aimed at benefiting girls and ethnic \nminorities. This gender and ethnic minority action plan (GEMAP) is based on social analysis and \nstakeholder  consultations  and  highlights  specific  actions  that  will  be  implemented  and  monitored \nduring implementation. The elements have been integrated into the project design, and indicators \nare included in the design and monitoring framework. The GEMAP follows Viet Nam\u2019s regulations \nand education guidelines, and was prepared in accordance with Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nPolicy on Gender and Development (1998) and Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998).  \n \nOverview of Gender and Minority Issues in Education. The gap in socioeconomic status \n2. \nbetween  Viet  Nam\u2019s  minority  groups  and  the  majority  Kinh  is  getting  wider.  Major  factors \ncontributing to this disparity include: (i) geographic remoteness and challenging climatic conditions \nin  minority  areas;  (ii)  a  limited  supply  of  schools;  (iii)  a  lack  of  adequate  boarding  facilities; \n(iv) direct, indirect, and opportunity costs of secondary education; and (v) cultural factors including \nthe  low  value  placed  on  education  because  of  a  perceived  lack  of  relevance,  especially  for  girls, \nwho in many minorities are expected to marry at a young age. The regions of Viet Nam with large \nminority  populations  are  also  the  country\u2019s  poorest.  While  access,  equity,  and  participation  in \nsecondary  education  have  generally  improved  over  the  past  decade,  gender  disparities  are  still \nconsiderable,  especially  among  poor  and  ethnic  minority  households  living  in  remote  rural  areas. \nThis  inequality  is  best  illustrated  by  mean  years  of  schooling,  with  girls  and  boys  achieving,  on \naverage, 5.6 and 6.8 years, respectively. This gap widens dramatically when ethnicity is factored \nin:  ethnic  minority  girls  achieve  only  4.5  mean  years  of  schooling,  compared  with  8.5  years  for \nethnic Kinh and Chinese boys.  \n \n3. \nTable A16.1 shows the relationship between geography, minority population, poverty, and \ngender gaps in lower secondary education. The Northern Mountain region has the largest gender \ngaps:  in  Lai  Chao  province  only  37%  of  lower  secondary  students  are  girls.  The  2004  Viet  Nam \nHousehold  Living  Standards  Survey  (VHLSS)  revealed  that  less  than  one  third  (only  29%)  of  all \nethnic  minority  adults  aged  18  and  older  had  completed  lower  secondary  education.  Ethnic \nminority  children  who  are  able  to  attend  secondary  school  face  a  major  barrier  to  academic \nachievement  in  their  limited  proficiency  in  the  Vietnamese  language.  Poorly  equipped  schools, \nlimited  teacher  supply,  and  teaching  methods  that  fail  to  respond  to  the  needs  of  nonnative \nspeakers perpetuate social exclusion and isolation. \n \n4. \nThe opportunity costs of education are considerably higher for minorities and girls than for \nboys, as shown by the participation of children aged 11\u201314 in income-generating activities. While \nthe  percentage  of  school-aged  children  engaged  in  income-generating  activities  fell  overall \nbetween  1997  and  2004  as  more  children  stayed  in  school  longer,  ethnic  minority  girls  in  rural \nareas were more likely to have worked than other girls or their male counterparts. Ethnic minority \nchildren are twice as likely to work as Kinh or Chinese children, and ethnic minority girls are more \nlikely to work than minority boys. Among the 11\u201314 age group, 42% of minority girls work vs. 19% \nof Kinh or Chinese boys.1 Among children aged 15\u201317, only 61% of minority girls are enrolled in \nschool compared to 71% of ethnic Kinh/Hoa, indicating that ethnic minority girls are more likely to \nleave  school  early  for  marriage  or  income  generation.  In  2002  the  literacy  rate  for  Kinh/Chinese \nwomen was 92%, while for Thai and Hmong women it was 70% and 22%, respectively. \n \n5. \nOf  the  three  project  regions,  the  Northern  Mountain  region  is  the  most  culturally  diverse. \nSome  groups  (e.g.,  Tay,  Thai,  Muong,  and  Nung)  tend  to  live  in  the  more  accessible  and  fertile \n                                                 \n1 Lee, Sunhwa, 2006.

Others,  such  as  the  Hmong  and  Dao,  rank  among  the \npoorest,  living  at  higher  elevations  with  difficult  access  and  low  land  productivity.  This  low \nproductivity  requires  more  children  to  assist  in  agricultural  activities  and  is  reflected  in  larger \nhouseholds, particularly among the Hmong, who also have the lowest education participation rates \n(particularly  among  girls).  In  2002  the  gross  enrollment  rate  for  the  Hmong  was  only  9.8%.2  Net \nenrollment rates were 7.5% for boys versus 1.6% for girls. Enrollment rates for the Dao were also \nlow  at  20.3%,  but  with  little  difference  between  boys  and  girls.  This  contrasted  sharply  with \nenrollment rates for more assimilated groups, e.g., the Thai and Muong, for whom gross enrollment \nrates were more than 75%. \n \n\nTable A16.1: Ethnicity, Poverty, and Gender Gaps in Enrollment in the 17 Project Provinces \n\nEthnic \nMinority \nPopulation \n\nFood \nPoverty \nIncidence \n\nPer Capita \nIncome Rank \n(out of 64) \n\nLower Secondary School \nEnrollments \n\nGirls \n\n Minorities \n\nRegion \n\nProvince \n\n \n\nNational \n\n \n\n \n\nNorth West \n\nSon La \n\nNorth East \n\nCao Bang \n\nLai Chau \n\nDien Bien \n\nLao Cai \n\nYen Bai \n\nHa Giang \n\nBac Kan \n\nDac Lac \n\nKon Tum \n\nGia Lai \n\nDac Nong \n\nTra Vinh \n\nSoc Trang \n\nKien Giang \n\nCa Mau \n\nCentral \nHighlands \n\nMekong \nRiver Delta \n\n \n\n16% \n\n88% \n\n84% \n\n86% \n\n69% \n\n59% \n\n88% \n\n97% \n\n90% \n\n34% \n\n58% \n\n42% \n\n34% \n\n32% \n\n32% \n\n13% \n\n2% \n\n24% \n\n \n\n7% \n\n36% \n\n26% \n\n17% \n\n24% \n\n8% \n\n16% \n\n22% \n\n24% \n\n13% \n\n13% \n\n14% \n\n20% \n\n9% \n\n9% \n\n5% \n\n6% \n\n12% \n\n \n\n\u2014 \n\n64 \n\n63 \n\n60 \n\n58 \n\n51 \n\n62 \n\n59 \n\n61 \n\n37 \n\n48 \n\n43 \n\n45 \n\n33 \n\n34 \n\n12 \n\n10 \n\n36 \n\n48% \n\n37% \n\n39% \n\n44% \n\n45% \n\n46% \n\n46% \n\n49% \n\n47% \n\n50% \n\n48% \n\n48% \n\n54% \n\n48% \n\n47% \n\n47% \n\n45% \n\n48% \n\n14% \n\n83% \n\n80% \n\n82% \n\n70% \n\n55% \n\n82% \n\n97% \n\n89% \n\n29% \n\n51% \n\n31% \n\n22% \n\n30% \n\n27% \n\n12% \n\n2% \n\n18% \n\nSouth East \n\nNinh Thuan \n\nNote: Based on population aged 11\u201314. \nSources: DFA Survey 2006, VHLSS 2004, MOET Statistical Yearbook 2006. \n \n6. \nThe  large  forests  and  fertile  soil  of  the  Central  Highlands  have  brought  about  substantial \ngrowth through agricultural production. Cash crops such as coffee are a major source of revenue \nand a major attraction for ethnic Kinh and minorities who migrated in from the north. This influx of \nmigrants  has  resulted  in  an  indigenous  minority  population  of  only  26%.  Major  minorities  here \ninclude the Gia-rai, Ba-na, E-de, Mnong, and Xo-dang. Enrollment rates for both lower and upper \nsecondary are well below the national average, at 87% and 50%, respectively. Wide disparities in \naccess to education exist between the indigenous minorities and the new migrants, especially the \nKinh. Enrollment rates among minorities are half those of the Kinh (see footnote 2).32 Differences \n\n                                                 \n2   Baulch,  Bob,  Dominique  Haughton,  Jonathan  Haughton,  and  Truong  Thi  Kim  Chuyen.  2002.

The  Central  Highlands  is  the  only  region \nwhere there is a projected increase in the number of teachers needed over the next 5 years. At the \nsame time, the proportion of ethnic minority teachers has decreased from an already low base, 9% \nin  2001,  to  only  3%  in  2005.  This  has  implications  for  minority  students\u2019  learning  environment  if \nthey experience difficulties learning in Vietnamese and have limited opportunities to learn in their \nown languages at school. \n \n7. \nThe  Mekong  Delta  is  culturally  less  diverse  than  other  regions,  with  two  main  minority \ngroups  (Khmer  and  Cham).  Much  of  the  region  is  remote  and  experiences  annual  flooding.  The \nKhmer  have  benefited  from  the  economic  growth  in  the  region  but  still have  higher  poverty  rates \nthan the Kinh. In fact, within any province, poverty among the Khmer is always substantially higher \nthan  among  the  other  ethnic  groups.4  Lower  secondary  enrollment  rates  are  substantially  lower \nthan the national average, at 80% gross and 68% net, as compared with the national averages of \n92% and 83%, respectively. \n \n8. \nOne  of  the  main  strategies  for  improving  minorities\u2019  access  to  education  has  been  the \nestablishment of boarding schools at regional, provincial, and district levels, in which all education \nexpenses  are  covered  by  the  Government.  However,  their  coverage  is  low,  with  less  than  5%  of \nminorities  benefiting.  In  recognition  of  this,  Ministry  of  Education  and  Training  (MOET)  has \nemphasized  improving  the  semi-boarding  facilities  to  accommodate  minority  children  living  in \nremote villages. In addition, many children stay in private housing in return for rent or, more often, \nwork. Substantial resources for the construction of secondary schools, classrooms, and dormitories \nare needed to achieve universal secondary education for ethnic minorities. Other programs include \nwaiving  of  school  fees,  textbook  lending  schemes,  partial  scholarships,  and  exemption  from \nentrance exams at the tertiary level. The Government specifically recognizes the need to target the \nmost disadvantaged ethnic minority groups, defined as those 21 minorities with a total population \nof  less  than  15,000.  The  2004  VHLSS  confirms  these  groups  to  have  the  highest  poverty  head \ncount, and the most severe poverty gaps.53 \n \nLegal and Policy Context. Viet Nam has a comprehensive legal framework for social and \n9. \ngender  equality.  The  Gender  Equality  Law  passed  in  November  2006  stipulates  equal  access  to \neducation and training. Responsibility for implementing the law falls to the National Committee for \nthe Advancement of Women (NCFAW) and the Viet Nam Women\u2019s Union (VWU). There are also \nlong-established  policies  and  programs  to  support  minority  groups,  especially  those  living  in \nremote  mountainous  areas.  Multisectoral  poverty  reduction  programs  such  as  Program  135  and \nthe  Hunger  Eradication  and  Poverty  Reduction  Program  (HEPR)  specifically  target  minority \npopulations. \n \n10. \nGender  and  Ethnic  Minorities  Action  Plan.  Specific  actions  as  outlined  in  the  GEMAP \n(Table  A16.2)  will  be  implemented,  monitored,  and  refined  as  required.  New  actions  will  also  be \nconsidered for inclusion, as deemed appropriate. \n \n11. \nImplementation Arrangements. Implementation arrangements and estimated costs of the \nGEMAP have been integrated into the overall arrangements and budget of the Project. A national \nproject  implementation  unit  (NPIU)  will  be  established  within  the  executing  agency  (MOET). \nProvincial  and  district  project  implementation  units  (PPIUs  and  DPIUs)  in  each  of  the  target \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n3  Though the study is somewhat dated, it is one of the few analyses at this level of disaggregation. \n4  UNDP and AusAid. 2003.

Progress  reports  will  provide  updates  on  the  activities,  outputs,  and  outcomes  of  the \nGEMAP. The midterm review mission will make any necessary adjustments, as required. \n \n12. \nInstitutional Capacity and Support. Viet Nam has substantial capacity in the area of girls\u2019 \nand ethnic minority education. The National Committee for the Advancement of Women conducts \nresearch  into  gender  issues  and  works  with  partners  to  develop  priorities  for  gender  action.  The \nVWU provides a national network down to the village level to represent the needs of women and \nparticipate  in  community  mobilization  and  information  dissemination.  The  National  Institute  of \nLinguistics conducts research on minority languages. The National Institute for Education Strategy \nand  Curriculum  conducts  gender  and  educational  research  and  coordinates  curriculum \ndevelopment within MOET. The Department for Ethnic Minority Education61plays a key role in the \ndevelopment of curricula and materials for ethnic minority education. The Project will involve both \nagencies,  specifically  in  conducting  operational  studies  and  developing  appropriate  curricula  and \nteaching methods.  \n \n\nTable A16.2: Gender and Ethnic Minorities Action Plan \n \n\nLSEMDR Outputs \n\nOutput 1: Improved access to lower \nsecondary education.  \na.

It  defines  the  legal  basis  that \nensures  that  any  affected  persons  (APs)  will  be  provided  with:  (i)  replacement  lands  for  lands \nacquired  from  them  because  of  the  Project,  (ii) compensation  for  their  lost  productive  assets,  and \n(iii) assistance in restoring their incomes. The RF has been prepared in lieu of RPs for the Project\u2019s \nsmall-scale  civil  works  (construction  or  upgrading  of  classrooms,  teacher  housing,  student \ndormitories, etc.) for which specific sites have yet to be confirmed.1 \n \nScope  of  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  In  the  selection  of  sites,  the  executing \n2. \nagency (EA) will ensure that civil works are constructed on vacant public lands or on the commune\u2019s \nreserved lands. This principle is contained in the loan covenants and specific assurances. However, \nthe impact of land acquisition will be known only when the sites have been confirmed by the district \nand commune people\u2019s committees, and the property boundaries have been established. All sites will \nbe screened for involuntary resettlement impact. Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, a list of civil \nwork sites that details land ownership and confirms the avoidance of land acquisition and involuntary \nresettlement  impact  will  be  prepared.  For  those  sites  where  involuntary  resettlement  cannot  be \navoided,  provincial  project  implementation  unit  (PPIUs)  will  prepare  and  submit  RPs  for  review  and \napproval by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) before the award of civil works contract in each site. \nThe  RP  process  includes  screening  all  land  acquisition  for  impact,  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \ncategorization  of  involuntary  resettlement  (Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  [1995]). 2  Civil  works \ncontractors  will  not  be  issued  a  notice  of  possession  for  a  site  until  (i) compensation  payment  and \nrelocation  to  new  sites  have  been  satisfactorily  completed  for  the  site,  (ii)  the  agreed  rehabilitation \nassistance is in place, and (iii) the site is free of all encumbrances. \n \n3. \nProject  Principles.  The  following  principles  were  formulated  to  bridge  the  differences \nbetween  ADB\u2019s  and  the  Government\u2019s  resettlement  policies,  and  will  apply  to  all  civil  works \nundertaken. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAcquisition of assets and resettlement of people will be minimized as much as possible \nthrough the identification of possible alternative project designs and appropriate social, \neconomic,  operation,  and  engineering  solutions  with  the  least  impact  on  populations, \nparticularly on ethnic minorities, in the subproject area. \n\nLack  of  formal  legal  rights  to  the  assets  lost  should  not  be  used  as  grounds  for \nexcluding  APs  from  compensation,  entitlement,  and  rehabilitation  measures.  No  APs \nwill  be  displaced  from  affected  land  until  the  village  or  commune  allocates  suitable \nalternative land or compensation sufficient to purchase suitable land within the same or \nneighboring village is paid. \n\nAffected persons will be systematically informed and consulted about the Project, the \nrights and options available to them, and the proposed mitigating measures, and they \nwill be involved in decision making concerning their resettlement. \n\nThe consultative process will include not only those affected but also representatives of \nthe districts and communes in which the Project is located, community leaders of host \ncommunities,  civil  society  organizations  such  as  nongovernment  organizations,  and \nmembers of local people\u2019s organizations. \n\nThe  last  day  of  the  census  and  inventory  of  losses  that  has  been  carried  out  in  the \ncommunes  as part of the resettlement planning process will represent the cutoff date \nfor  eligibility.  Eligible  persons  are  entitled  to  be  provided  with  compensation  and \n\n                                                 \n1   This statement is consistent with the provision in para. 40 of OM Section F2/OP issued on 25 September 2006. \n2   Category A: Significant, if 200 or more people experience major impact from a project by being physically displaced from \nhousing  or  losing  10%  or  more  of  their  productive  (income-generating)  assets;  a  full  resettlement  plan  is  required. \nCategory  B:  Not  Significant,  if  the  impact  of  the  project  is  not  deemed  significant;  a  short  resettlement  plan  is  required. \nCategory C: no resettlement effects are foreseen; no resettlement plan is required.  \n\n \n \n\n\fAppendix 17 \n\n67 \n\n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\n \n(ix) \n\n \n\n(x) \n\n \n(xi) \n\n \n(xii) \n\nrehabilitation  measures  sufficient  to  assist  them  in  improving  or  at  least  maintaining \ntheir pre-project living standards, income-earning capacity, and production levels. \n\n(b) \n\nThe compensation and rehabilitation measures to be provided to APs are: \n(a) \n\nreplacement  of  agricultural,  residential,  or  commercial  land  with  land  of  equal \nsize acceptable to APs;  \ncash  compensation  at  replacement  cost  for  houses  and  other  structures, \nwithout  deduction  for  depreciation  or  the  remaining  values  of  salvageable \nmaterials; and \ntransfer and subsistence allowances. \n\n(c) \n\nAPs will be systematically informed and closely consulted about the Project, the rights \nand options available to them, and proposed mitigation measures. The comments and \nsuggestions of APs and communities will be taken into account. \n\n \n(viii)  Compensation rates for physical assets, i.e., house, building, and other structures, and \nnonphysical assets like lost income from productive assets or jobs, will be calculated at \nreplacement  cost  or  at  current  market  rates  in  the  project  area  at  the  time  of \ncompensation. \n\nExisting cultural and religious practices and observances will be respected, and to the \nmaximum extent practical, preserved. \n\nThe EA will see to it that institutional arrangements are in place to ensure the effective \nimplementation  of  the  RPs,  through  consultation  and  the  implementation  of  the  land \nacquisition, compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation program. \n\nThere  will  be  an  effective  mechanism  for  hearing  and  resolving  grievances  and \ncomplaints  during  the  implementation  of  the  RPs.  Grievance  committees  will  include \nrepresentatives from APs, especially women and ethnic minorities. \n\nParticular  attention  will  be  paid  to  the  needs  of  the  poorest  affected  people,  and \nvulnerable groups that may be at high risk of impoverishment. These will include those \nwithout legal title to land or other assets, households headed by women, the elderly or \ndisabled,  and  other  vulnerable  groups,  particularly  ethnic  minority  populations. \nAppropriate assistance will be provided to them to improve their socioeconomic status.  \n\n \n(xiii)  Resettlement  identification,  planning,  and  management  will  ensure  that  gender \nconcerns  are  incorporated,  including  gender-specific  consultation  and  information \ndisclosure. This includes special attention to guarantee women\u2019s assets, property, and \nland-use rights, and to ensure the restoration of their income and living standards. \n\n \n(xiv)  Adequate  budgetary  support  will  be  fully  committed  and  made  available  to  cover  the \nthe  agreed \ncosts  of  compensation,  entitlements,  and \nimplementation  period.  Clear  budget  commitments  are  required  for  critical  activities \nsuch as formal detailed physical surveys and administrative functions associated with \ncompensation and resettlement. \n\nresettlement  within \n\nThe key information in the RPs, including measurement-of-losses data, detailed asset \nvaluation,  compensation  and  resettlement  options,  detailed  entitlements  and  special \nprovisions, grievance procedures, timing of payments, and displacement schedule will \nbe  disclosed  to  APs  in  an  understandable  format  such  as  the  full  RP  or  public \ninformation booklets in the local language, and in commune offices. \n\n \n(xvi)  Appropriate  reporting  (including  auditing  and  redress  functions),  monitoring,  and \nevaluation  mechanisms  will  be  identified  and  set  in  place  as  part  of  the  resettlement \nmanagement system. If the impact of resettlement is significant, the Project will hire an \nexternal  monitoring  agency  to  evaluate  the  resettlement  process  and  results,  with \nreports to be submitted directly to the ADB.  \n\n \n(xv) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 17 \n\n(xvii)  Finally, land acquisition, compensation and resettlement activities must be satisfactorily \ncompleted, rehabilitation measures in place but not necessarily completed as this may \ntake  a  longer  time,  and  the  land  cleared  of  all  obstructions  and  free  from \nencumbrances before a notice of possession of the site is issued to contractors.  \n\n \n4. \nEntitlement  Matrix. The RF contains a detailed entitlement matrix summarizing the types of \nimpact,  eligibility,  and  compensation.  However,  it  may  not  cover  all  types  of  impact  but  can  be \nenhanced  in  the  RPs  depending  on  the  findings  of  the  social  assessment  and  subproject  impact. \nStandards described may not be lowered but might be enhanced in the ensuing RPs as required, and \non the basis of detailed social impact analysis. The entitlement matrix is found in Table A16 at the end \nof this appendix, and the full resettlement framework is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n5. \nSocioeconomic  Information.  The  RF  prescribes  the  presentation  of  the  socioeconomic \ncharacteristics  of  the  APs  as  a  major  section  in  all  RPs.  The  data  on  APs  will  be  recorded  in  a \nstructured questionnaire during the joint detailed measurement survey and inventory of losses in host \ncommunes  where  land  acquisition  will  take  place.  The  survey  instrument  will  aim  to  capture  the \nessential data on affected properties like land and other assets, ethnicity, education, income and its \nsources,  vulnerability,  gender,  and  household  population  of  APs,  among  others.  Every  detailed \nmeasurement  survey  questionnaire  will  be  assigned  an  alphanumeric  code  for  tracking  and \nsafekeeping.  The  national  project  implementation  unit  (NPIU)  will  coordinate  with  the  respective \nPPIUs for the supervision of the joint detailed measurement survey and inventory of losses. \n \n6. \nGrievance  and  Redress  Mechanisms. The NPIU will ensure that the APs are aware of the \nprocedures  for  filing  complaints  and  the  mechanism  for  redress.  Compensation,  assistance,  and \nresettlement  boards  will  help  resolve  confusion,  misunderstandings,  or  problems  about  land \nacquisition, compensation rates, rehabilitation, and relocation. The RF sets out a four-stage procedure \nfor the redress of grievances that is consistent with the legal process for the resolution of disputes in \nViet Nam. \n \n7. \nFinancing Plan. All RPs will present a budget for compensation for lands, affected structures, \nother  assets,  business  incomes,  relocation  and  transfer  assistance,  crops  and  trees,  and  special \nassistance, as well as for gender development. Included in the budget presentations are the amounts \nallocated for administration cost, equivalent to 2% of the total cost of compensation and entitlements. \nAll cost items in RPs will be provided with 20% contingency and will be part of Ministry of Education \nand Training\u2019s (MOET) equity in the total cost of the Project. The financial plan for implementing the \nRPs will also be presented. \n \n8. \nImplementation Schedule and Monitoring. The Project will be implemented over a period of \n6  years.  Before  the  construction  of  civil  works  begins,  payment  for  compensation  and  provision  for \nother forms of social rehabilitation and resettlement in each site, if that be the case, must have been \nsatisfactorily completed by the EA and the lands cleared of obstructions and free of all encumbrances \nbefore  ADB  officially  issues  its  \u201cno  objection\u201d  for  the  award  of  civil  works  contracts.  The  bureau  of \neducation  and  training  (BOETs)  and  the  department  of  education  and  training  (DOETs)  will  ensure \nthat resettlement activities do not overlap with the start of construction. All activities in RPs must be \ntime-bound.  The  NPIU  and  PPIUs  will  be  jointly  responsible  for  continuous  internal  monitoring  of \nimplementation  against  the  planned  activities,  time  frames,  and  budgets.  Since  only  minimal  impact \nfrom  land  acquisition  is  expected  from  Component  1  of  the  Project,  the  external  monitoring  of  RP \nimplementation by an external monitoring agency will not be required. \n \nImplementation  Arrangements  and  Disclosure.  The  NPIU  will  recruit  an  international \n9. \nresettlement specialist (1 person-month) and a national resettlement specialist (10 person-months) to \nassist in the preparation and implementation of RPs in districts where land acquisition is unavoidable. \nDisclosure of the RF and any resulting RPs will follow ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2005). \n\n \n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 31 October 2007) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "dong (D) \n", "D1.00\n$1.00\n", "$0.000621736 \nD16.084 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n \n", "ADB \nAP \nBOET \nCEC \nCPD \nDOET \nEA \nEMIS \nGDP \nGEMAP \nHIV/AIDS \nICT \nINSETT \nISDP \nJICA \nJFPR \nLSE \nLSS \nMDG \nMOET \nNAPEFA \nNER \nNPIU \nODA \nPPIU \nPRESETT \nRF \nRP \nSDR \nSEDP \nSESMP \nSOE \nTTC \nUNESCO \nUNICEF \nUSE \nUSS \nVDG \n", "Asian Development Bank \n\u2013 \naffected person \n\u2013 \n(district) bureau of education and training \n\u2013 \ncontinuing education center \n\u2013 \ncontinuing professional development \n\u2013 \n(provincial) department of education and training \n\u2013 \nexecuting agency \n\u2013 \neducation management information system \n\u2013 \ngross domestic product \n\u2013 \ngender and ethnic minority action plan \n\u2013 \nhuman immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome \n\u2013 \ninformation and communication technology \n\u2013 \nin-service teacher training \n\u2013 \ninclusive school development plan \n\u2013 \nJapan International Cooperation Agency \n\u2013 \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction \n\u2013 \nlower secondary education \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nlower secondary school \n\u2013  Millennium Development Goal \n\u2013  Ministry of Education and Training \n\u2013  National Action Plan for Education For All \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation \n\u2013  United Nations Children\u2019s Fund \nupper secondary education \n\u2013 \nupper secondary school \n\u2013 \nViet Nam development goal \n\u2013 \n", "net enrollment rate \nnational project implementation unit \nofficial development assistance \nprovincial project implementation unit \npre-service teacher training \nresettlement framework \nresettlement plan \nspecial drawing rights \nSocio-Economic Development Plan \nSecondary Education Sector Master Plan \nstatement of expenditures \nteacher training college \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "NOTES \n", "The fiscal year of the Government ends on 31 December. \n", "In  Viet  Nam,  the  school  year  (SY)  ends  on  31  May.  \u201cSY\u201d  before  a  calendar  year \ndenotes the year in which the school year ends, e.g., SY2008 ends on 31 May 2009. \n", "(iii) \n", "In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \n", "C.
