I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nsupplementary  grant  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan  for  the  Regional  Power \nTransmission Interconnection Project.  \n \nII.  THE APPROVED PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Rationale \n \n2.  The project is to construct a transmission line between Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The \nobjective is to export Tajik  summer electricity surpluses of up to 300 megawatts (MW) to \nAfghanistan, which has an energy deficit. The project was first conceived and approved by the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) in 2006.1  Construction on the Tajik side has progressed well \nand will be completed as scheduled in late 2010, but the construction of the larger portion of the \nproject on the Afghan side is behind schedule. The late start-up in construction and later, \nmounting security problems in the project area in 2009 delayed the work and increased costs. A \nfunding gap of $12 million needs additional finance. The design, characteristics, and scope of \nthe project remain unchanged.    \n \nB.  Objectives and Scope \n \n3.  The  project  promotes  regional  cooperation  and  energy  security  in  Afghanistan  and \nexport  revenues  for  Tajikistan.  It  reinforces  energy  work  under  the  Central  Asia  Regional \nEconomic Cooperation program, and is a means to expand energy security and trade in the \nregion. Afghanistan has an energy deficit and Tajikistan a surplus in summer. The operation \ncontributes to energy trade in the region and complements another project financed by ADB to \nbuild a transmission line from Uzbekistan to Afghanistan. The design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1. \n \nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n4.  The  project,  including  taxes,  duties,  and  interest  during  construction,  was  originally \nestimated at $55.5 million (Table 1 and Table A3.1 summarize the original cost and financing \nplan). ADB provided a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR23,563,000 ($35 million) to \nAfghanistan from its Special Funds resources. Originally, the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust \nFund  was  to  provide  $16.5  million  in  cofinancing,  but  was  later  replaced  by  the  Islamic \nDevelopment Bank, which is still a cofinancing partner.  \n \nD.  Status of and Progress in Project Implementation \n \n5.  The Afghan portion of the transmission line has two components: (i) an 157-kilometer \n(km) 220-kilovolt transmission line from Sherkan Bandar to Pul-e-Khumri substation, and (ii) two \nsubstations in Kunduz and Baghlan financed by the Islamic Development Bank. A condition to \nstart project implementation was the signing of a power purchasing agreement, as it would have \nbeen inappropriate and risky to construct a transmission line without a commercial agreement in \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2006. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans, Technical \nAssistance Grants, and Administration of Loan to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Republic of \nTajikistan for the Regional Power Transmission Interconnection Project. Manila (Loan 2304-AFG and Loan 2303-\nTAJ, approved on 28 November). ", "2   \nplace.  Although all the principles behind this agreement had been defined and accepted prior to \nADB\u201fs approval of the project, final negotiations between the parties turned out to be much \nslower than expected. The main stumbling block was the price. The agreement was signed only \non 29 August 2008, after a 15-month impasse that derailed the original implementation plan, a \nproblem later compounded by mounting security problems in the Afghan project area and rising \ncosts.  On  1  April  2009,  ADB  approved  an  extension  of  the  loan  closing.  Although  the \ntransmission line can still be completed in early 2011 to carry summer electricity from Tajikistan, \nthe operation urgently needs an additional $12 million. The 117-km line on the Tajik side will be \ncompleted by the end of 2010. \n \n6.  As of mid-September 2010, project implementation stood at almost 70% completion with \nan elapsed loan period of 133%. The Ministry of Energy and Water, the executing agency, is in \nthe process of complying with many of the loan covenants. Full compliance is expected by \nproject completion. The latest project performance report is in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY GRANT  \n \nA.  The Cost Overrun \n \n7.  The contractor requires a contract variation to accomplish the line works and meet \nincreases in the cost of equipment, labor and materials (Appendix 2). Due diligence by ADB \nmissions,2 and discussions with the contractor and the Ministry of Energy and Water suggest \nthe contract variation is justified. The overall cost increase is $12 million.  \n \nB.  Impact on the Project \n \n8.  The original project remains unchanged, as do its fundamentals. Tajikistan offers to \nAfghanistan power that is significantly less expensive than Afghanistan can currently access.3 If \nthe transmission line is not built, Afghanistan will have to pay an additional $15 million for the \nleast-cost alternative, and Tajikistan will lose $21 million in annual sales as the country does not \nhave alternative uses for the power in the summer and must spill the water without generating \nenergy. The project is a win\u2500win situation for both.  \n \nC.  Rationale \n \n9.  The policy criteria and eligibility criteria have been met and even with the additional \nfinancing,  the  approved  project  will  remain  technically  feasible,  economically  viable,  and \nfinancially sustainable. As the supplementary financing is to support the existing approved \nimpact, outcome and output, no new design and monitoring framework has been prepared. The \nframework will be updated when the activities have been confirmed. \n \nD.  Revised Cost Estimates \n \n10.  The total cost of the project will rise to $67.9 million (Appendix 3). Table 1 provides a \ncomparison of the original and revised cost estimates. \n \n                                                \n2  Review missions to Afghanistan in March, June, and August 2010. \n3  According to the power purchasing agreement, in 2011, Tajikistan would sell 597.1 gigawatt hours (GWh) of power \nto Afghanistan at $0.035/kilowatt hour (kWh). In 2009, Afghanistan imported 660 GWh of power from Uzbekistan at \na tariff of $0.06/kWh. \n ", "3 \nTable 1: Consolidated Total Project Cost \n($ million) \n  Original 2006  Cost Increase  Revised \n  Cost Estimate  (Supplementary  Cost Estimate \nItems  (2006)  Financing)  (2010) \n       \nA.

The Government of Afghanistan has requested ADB to provide a grant of $12 million \nfrom ADB\u201fs Special Funds resources. The Islamic Development Bank is an alternative financing \nsource but does not now have additional resources for Afghanistan. The government and the \nreconstruction trust funds are also constrained in terms of resources. The new financing plan is \nin Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan for the Project \n($ million) \n  Original  Supplementary  Total  Share of Total \nSource  Financing  Financing  Financing  (%) \n         \nADB    35.0    12.0    47.0    69.2 \n   ADF loan (original) a    35.0    -    35.0   \n   ADF grant (supplementary)    -    12.0    12.0   \nIslamic Development Bank    16.5    -    16.5    24.3 \nGovernment of Afghanistan    4.0    0.4    4.4    6.5 \nTotal    55.5    12.4    67.9    100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund. \na Afghanistan was ineligible for ADF grant funding in 2006 when the project was originally approved.   \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.  Remedial Steps and Implementation Arrangements  \n \n12.  The implementation period will be extended to 30 June 2011 and the grant closing date \nto 31 December 2011. The contract for the main contractor and the supervising consultant will \nbe revised through variation order to accommodate this change. A variation order is appropriate \ndue to the \u201cdesign and build\u201d nature of the original contract which was awarded based on \nestimated  quantities.  The  actual  quantities,  as  confirmed  by  the  approved  design,  have \nincreased because of an increase in line length and the need for additional towers per kilometer \ndue to the more difficult terrain than originally envisaged. The additional estimates are an \nintegral  component  of  the  overall  design  making  separate  procurement  not  feasible.  The \n ", "4   \nsupervising consultant will certify the quality of the works and act as the first clearance point for \nauthorizing payments.  \n \n13.  ADB Management has, in principle, approved retroactive financing using up to 20% of \nthe grant proceeds for eligible expenditures incurred during the period not exceeding 12 months \nprior to signing of the grant agreement. \n \n14.  The original report and recommendation of the President states that the Ministry of \nEnergy and Water, as the executing agency, has overall responsibility for implementing the \nproject, specifically, mobilizing financing, completing works, testing and commissioning. The \nformer  Afghanistan  Electricity  Agency  (DABM),  a  state-owned  enterprise,  was  the \nimplementation agency responsible for the operation and maintenance of the project facilities. \nAccordingly, most of the implementation work to date, prior to project facilities completion and \nbecoming  operational,  has  been  carried  out  by  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Water  as  the \nexecuting agency. \n \n15.  In September 2009, DABM was liquidated and Afghanistan Electricity Company (DABS) \nwas established as the national electricity utility company in Afghanistan with its own statutes, \nbusiness strategy, and mandate. Currently, the government remains the sole shareholder of \nDABS, but the firm has an independent management team. As the assets and liabilities of \nDABM  had  been  transferred  to  DABS,  DABS  became  the  successor  of  DABM  as  the \nimplementing agency for the operation and maintenance for project facilities and, in particular, a \nparty to the project agreement, subsidiary loan agreement and power purchasing agreement \n(each as defined in the loan agreement dated 20 May 2007). The same terms and conditions \nwill apply other than adjustments required to reflect the corporatization of DABM into DABS.  \n \n16.  As discussed in the context of the Energy Sector Development Investment Program \napproved in November 2008,4 the liquidation of DABM and establishment of DABS with the \naccompanying  introduction  of  better  operating  practices  and  independence  from  the \ngovernment is an essential first step toward improving the energy sector in Afghanistan. ADB \nhas supported the transformation and the investment program envisaged the medium-term \npartnership of ADB, the government, and DABS.  \n \n17.  Except  for  the  above  mentioned  changes,  no  other  changes  in  implementation \narrangements resulting from the proposed supplementary financing are proposed. If the board \napproves the proposed supplementary grant, then changes to the implementation arrangements \nin relation to the original loan (footnote 1) will be made in accordance with ADB procedures. \n \n18.  The  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, revised from time to time). The original loan (footnote 1) will be disbursed on a \nfront load basis.  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche \nFinancing Facility and Administration of Grant \u2013 Energy Sector Development Investment Program in Afghanistan. \nManila (Grant 0026-AFG, approved on 28 November). \n ", "5 \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Financial and Economic Benefits \n \n19.  The economic internal rate of return was recalculated and is now 21.8%, compared with \n31.1% in the original report and recommendation of the President. The financial internal rate of \nreturn  was  recalculated  and  stands  at  9.8%  compared  with  the  original  12.4%.  This  still \ncompares favorably to the weighted average cost of capital of 0%. The revised financial and \neconomic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \nB.  Environment, Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples Safeguards \n \n20.  All safeguard categorizations remain unchanged. There are no pending issues, although \nland acquisition in some sections of the project was delayed.  The matter was resolved and \npayment instructions made. \n  \nC.  Risks and Assumptions \n \n21.  Cost risks are to be contained by incorporating clauses fixing the price and delivery \nperiod clauses in the primary contractor contract. All cost estimates have been validated by \nADB teams. Security will always remain a risk. The Ministry of Interior will continue to deploy \npersonnel  in  the  area.  The  situation  will  be  monitored  closely  by  security  advisors  in  the \nAfghanistan Resident Mission, the contractor and the Ministry of Interior. The project technical \nspecifications remain unchanged and do not present a risk. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n22.  The government and DABS have assured ADB that the implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents.  \n \n23.  In addition to the assurances set out in the loan and project agreements of May 2007, \nwhich will continue to apply, the government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the grant agreement.  \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n24.  I am satisfied that the proposed supplementary grant would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nsupplementary grant not exceeding $12,000,000 to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan from \nADB\u201fs Special Funds resources for the Regional Power Transmission Interconnection Project, \non terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \ngrant agreement presented to the Board.  \n \n \n \n                  Haruhiko Kuroda \n                  President \n \n27 October 2010\n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance  Data Sources   \n  Targets and/or  and/or Reporting   \nDesign Summary  Indicators  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact       \n  Mutually beneficial  National statistics in   \nEnhance regional  power trade  AFG and TAJ   \ncooperation in the  between TAJ and     \npower sector, through  AFG by June 2009  Annual power system   \ntransmission  reports and statistics   \ninterconnectivity \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nFast restoration of  Increase  Power quality and  300 MW of electricity is \npower supply in AFG  consumption per  reliability indicators,  available for export to AFG for \nand reducing cost of  capita in AFG from  including SAIDI and  a minimum of 6 months of the \nelectricity for power  21 kWh/year to 35  SAIFI  year \nconsumers  kWh/year      \n    Metering and  AFG pays for all electricity \nIncreased power export  TAJ revenue  SCADA information  received in a timely manner \ncapability of TAJ and  increase by $15  as provided by the   \naccess to new power  million per year  Tajik and Afghan  The transmission line and \nmarket    system control  substation equipment are \n  AFG power costs  centers  properly operated and \nIncreased generation  decreases by    maintained  \ncapacity in Tajikistan  $25million a year  Financial audited   \nsouthern grid    statement of BT and  There are no major failures of \n  Power exported from  DABM  existing generating equipment \n  TAJ up to 300 MW  and transmission lines in TAJ \n  by June 2009   \n    DABM improves billing and \n  100% replacement  revenue collection  \n  of Kabul diesel gas   \n  turbine power station  AFG MOF gets necessary \n  during the 6 summer  funding to back up DABM for \n  months by June  the settlement of TAJ bills \n  2009   \n    Government of Afghanistan to \n  Improve power  approve tariff increases for full \n  supply to Kunduz,  cost recovery by 2009 \n  Kabul and related   \n  areas in AFG.

Transmission Line \n \n1.  The procurement approach of the original project was to award a \u201cdesign and build\u201d \ncontract, with bid evaluation based on assumed quantities. The contract allowed payment to the \ncontractor to be based on actual quantities built, with unit rates to be escalated in accordance \nwith an agreed price escalation formula. The supervision consultant was engaged to help \nmonitor  quality  and  calculate  the  assumed  quantities  based  on  line  length  and  estimated \nnumber of towers.   \n \n2.  The quantity of materials on the Afghan portion of the line, the larger share of the \nproject, first increased with increases in line length and the number of towers per kilometer. The \nline length increased because a portion of it needed to be rerouted away from a populated area. \nThe  quantity  of  materials  per  kilometer  increased  as  the  terrain  was  more  difficult  than \nenvisaged.  Unit rates increased based on the contract escalation formula. Due diligence by the \nconsultant and ADB confirmed that these increases and changes were reasonable.  \n \n3.  The increase in physical works can be summarized in Table A2 in terms of quantity and \nprice comparisons between the preliminary and detailed design. \n \nTable A2: Comparison of Cost Estimates \n \n      Total    Total    Total \n    Existing  Price  Revised  Price    Price \nNo  Description  Contract  ($ \u201e000)  Amount  ($ \u201e000)  Variance  ($\u201f000) \n1  Steel towers  415 units    15,580  634 units    22,837  219 units    7,256 \n2  Stringing   157 km    9,942   164 km    10,696    7 km    754 \n3  Other items        150        330        180 \n               \n  Total      25,672      33,867        8,195 \nkm = kilometer \nSource: KEC India estimates. \n \n4.

The implementation consultant\u201fs contract will need to be increased by $0.7 million in \norder to cover the extended contract duration to supervise works and clear payments.   \n \nC.  Summary of Costs \n \n6.  The estimated cost of the turnkey contract has risen to $33.9 million. The adjusted total \nproject cost is $67.9 million.
