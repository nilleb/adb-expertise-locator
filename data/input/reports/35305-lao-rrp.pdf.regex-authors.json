An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was \nAssessment  undertaken, and the summary IEE is in Appendix 11. \n   \nProject Description  The Project comprises (i) improvement of 367 kilometers (km) of \nRoute  4  (the  project  road)  from  Xiang  Ngeun  to  Nakha, \nconstruction of a bridge over the Mekong River on the project \nroad, and improvement of about 100 km of rural access roads in \nthe  project  area;  (ii)  procurement  of  equipment  for  use  in \noperating  and  facilitating  the  border  crossing  at  Kenthao,  now \nunder construction, and for enforcement of axle-load controls on \nthe  project  road;  (iii)  consulting  services  for  construction \nsupervision  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  as  well  as  detailed \ndesign for the rural access roads; (iv) maintenance of the national \nroad  network  by  providing  financing  for  periodic  road \nmaintenance;  (v)  improvement  of  road  safety  by  financing \nconsulting services to continue the ongoing road safety assistance \nprogram;  and  (vi)  a  program  to  reduce  the  risks  of \nHIV/AIDS/sexually  transmitted  infections  (STIs)  and  human \ntrafficking that may develop during the improvement and operation \nof the project road.  \n   \nRationale  Poor basic infrastructure is a major impediment to subregional \neconomic cooperation. Lao PDR is pivotal to the Greater Mekong \nSubregion  (GMS)  transport  corridors  linking  northern  Thailand, \nnorthern Viet Nam, and the southern provinces of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. Improving routes that connect provinces in Lao \nPDR will enhance subregional connections between northern Lao \nPDR and surrounding countries, as well as economic growth and \npoverty reduction within Lao PDR.  \n ", "iv   \n  The Project will form part of the new Northeastern Corridor in the \nGMS spanning Nanning (in Guangxi, People\u2019s Republic of China)-\nHanoi-Thanh  Hoa-Bangkok,  which  was  identified  in  the  GMS \nTransport Sector Strategy Study (TSSS). The TSSS classified the \nProject  as  high  priority  based  on  its  improvement  of  linkages \nbetween northern Lao PDR and Thailand. The Project will provide \na sealed all-weather road to connect (i) districts in central and \nsouthern  Xaignabouri  Province,  (ii)  the  capitals  of \nLouangphrabang and Xaignabouri provinces, and (iii) the border \ncrossing with Thailand near Kenthaowith the GMS corridors that \n \nconverge  on  Louangphrabang.  These  connections  will  reduce \ntransport costs for international and domestic transport, e.g., for \nagricultural exports from Lao PDR to Thailand.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  Project  will  facilitate  regional  cooperation  and  increased \neconomic growth in the GMS by improving the national highway \nlinking  the  Louangphrabang  area  with  the  Lao  PDR-Thailand \nborder. Improvement of this road, much of which currently has a \ngravel and earth surface, and rural access roads will facilitate \nincreased exports to Thailand of agricultural goods produced in \nthe  project  area  and  increased  tourism  from  Thailand  to \nLouangphrabang.  The  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  increased \ntrade and economic growth in the project area and the region. The \noutcome  will  be  more  efficient  transport  on  the  regional  and \nnational road networks. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $88.5 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $5.6 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan  Source  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank  27.0  30.5\nOPEC Fund for International  11.0  12.4\nDevelopment \nGovernment of Australia  14.5  16.4\nGovernment of the    \nRepublic of Korea   22.4  25.3\nGovernment of Lao PDR  13.6  15.4\nTotal 88.5  100.0\n Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \n   \nLoan/Grant Amount   The Government has requested a grant of $27.0 million from the \nSpecial Funds resources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto help finance a portion of the project costs. The Government is \nalso  seeking  loans  from  the  OPEC  Fund  for  International \nDevelopment (OFID) in the amount of $11.0 million equivalent and \nfrom the Republic of Korea for $22.4 million equivalent, and a \ngrant from the Government of Australia in the amount of $14.5 \nmillion equivalent. The OFID loan and Government of Australia \ngrant will be administered by ADB. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2014. ", "  v\nEstimated Project  31 December 2013. \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The  Ministry  of  Communications,  Transport,  Posts,  and \nArrangements  Construction  (MCTPC)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the \nProject, and the Department of Roads (DOR) in MCTPC will be \nthe  Implementing  Agency.  DOR  has  extensive  experience  in \nimplementing  externally  funded  projects.  The  Project \nManagement Division of DOR, which is responsible for managing \nall  DOR  projects,  will  carry  out  the  functions  of  a  project \nmanagement unit. No separate project management unit will be \nestablished. DOR will appoint a full-time project manager, who will \nbe responsible for the day-to-day management of the Project. The \nproject manager will be supported by a full-time deputy project \nmanager, who will be appointed from the Xaignabouri Province \nProvincial Department of Communications, Transport, Posts, and \nConstruction.  A  full-time  deputy  project  manager  for  the \ncomponents financed by the Republic of Korea will be appointed \nfrom  the  Louangphrabang  provincial  Department  of \nCommunications, Transport, Posts, and Construction. \n   \nExecuting Agency  MCTPC \n   \nProcurement  The contract packages financed by the ADB and the Government \nof Australia grants, and OFID loan, will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time \nto time). Procurement of civil works under the component funded \nby the Republic of Korea will be subject to Government of Korea \nprocedures. Civil works along the project road have been initially \npackaged into five contracts. The civil works contracts along the \nproject  road  that  will  be  financed  by  ADB,  OFID,  and  the \nGovernment  of  Australia  will  be  procured  using  international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB) with prequalification and will be subject \nto  prior  review.  The  ICB  contracts  will  include  the  detailed \nengineering design and construction of the works. Smaller civil \nworks  contracts  for  rural  access  roads  and  periodic  road \nmaintenance subprojects partly or wholly financed by ADB and \ncosting up to $1 million, may follow national competitive bidding \n(NCB) procedures and will be subject to post review. Other supply \ncontracts that are not expected to exceed $100,000 in value will \nbe procured through shopping or direct contracting. Approval for \nadvance contracting action for procurement of civil works, goods, \nand  services  has  been  approved.  Relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy(1998, as amended to date) will be included \n \nin all bidding documents and contracts.  \n \n   \n ", "vi   \nConsulting Services  For the ADB-financed or administered components of the Project, \nthe  Government  will  engage  an  international  consulting  firm \nsupported  by  national  consultants  for  construction  supervision; \nquality assurance; environmental supervision and management; \nupdating, implementation, and monitoring of the resettlement plan \n(including  indigenous  peoples\u2019  specific  actions  and \nimplementation  and  monitoring  of  gender  strategy);  HIV/AIDS \nawareness  and  prevention  of  human  trafficking  program \n(HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  program);  and  project \nperformance monitoring. It is envisaged that 97 person-months of \ninternational  consultants  and  2,376  person-months  of  national \nconsultants  will  be  required.  International  consultants  for  the \nProject will be recruited using the quality and cost-based selection \nmethod and a full technical proposal in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). Under the components funded by the Republic of \nKorea, a single package of consulting services will be engaged for \ndetailed  design  and  construction  supervision.  An  international \nconsulting firm will be engaged through a separate contract for \nconsulting services for the road safety component using the single \nsource selection method and a biodata technical proposal. It is \nenvisaged that about 9 person-months of international consultants \nand  9  person-months  of  national  consultants  will  be  required. \nConsulting  services  for  the  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking \nprogram will be included in the terms of reference for the project \nimplementation consultants. This will strengthen the institutional \ncapacity of the Provincial Committee for Control of AIDS, District \nCommittees for Control of AIDS, and the Lao Women's Union; and \nassist  them  with  effective  planning,  implementation,  and \nmonitoring of the HIV/AIDS and human trafficking program. \n \nProject Benefits and  Project  benefits  include  vehicle  operating  cost  (VOC)  savings, \nBeneficiaries  time savings, diverted traffic, saving from improved road safety, \nand savings from reduced maintenance costs. An estimate of the \nProject\u2019s economic viability was prepared, based on assessment \nof the direct benefits and costs. The Project\u2019s economic internal \nrate  of  return  (EIRR)  is  estimated  at  16.6%.  The  Project  will \nprovide benefits to a population of about 311,000 people living in \nthe  districts  through  which  the  project  road  passes,  including \nabout  103,000  people  living  in  towns  and  villages  along  the \nalignment. The Project will generate about 5,400 person-months \nof work for unskilled labor during construction. \n   ", "  vii\nRisks and Assumptions  The Project is formulated to minimize potential risks during and \nafter  project  implementation.  The  traffic  forecast  may  not \nmaterialize, but the Project remains viable even with substantially \nlower  traffic  levels.  There  is  a  risk  that  the  road  may  not  be \nproperly  maintained,  but  the  emphasis  of  ADB  and  other \ninternational  institutions  on  and  the  commitment  of  the \nGovernment  to  road  maintenance  will  address  this  risk. \nCompensation,  assistance,  and  income  restoration  measures \nrelating to involuntary resettlement might not be delivered on time, \nthereby  delaying  the  start  of  civil  works.  The  gender  strategy \nincludes consultation workshops for the affected households to \nincrease  their  understanding  of  resettlement  issues  such  as \nentitlements,  compensation,  and  the  grievance  process.  The \nproject supervision consultants will include specialists to help the \nexecuting agency manage resettlement, environmental impacts, \nand  ethnic  minority  specific  activities  and  ensure  that  ADB\u2019s \nsafeguard policies are complied with. Upgrading of the road will \nincrease the mobility of goods and people along the route and \ncould increase risks of HIV/AIDS and STIs and human trafficking \nin  local  communities,  especially  among  women  and  children. \nThere is also potential for increased road traffic accidents. To \nminimize  the  potential  risks  of  traffic  accidents,  HIV/AIDS  and \nhuman trafficking, the Project includes a road safety program and \nan HIV/AIDS and human trafficking program.  \n \n   \n ", "viii  \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \ngrant to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Northern Greater Mekong \nSubregion (GMS) Transport Network Improvement Project, (ii) proposed administration of a loan \nto be provided by the OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID), and (iii) proposed \nadministration of a grant to be provided by the Government of Australia for the Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  Enhanced  subregional  economic  cooperation  requires  improved  connections  across \ncountries and between centers of economic activity. Lao PDR is pivotal to the GMS transport \ncorridors  linking  northern  Thailand,  northern  Viet  Nam,  and  the  southern  provinces  of  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Improving routes that connect provinces in Lao PDR to each \nother and to borders will enhance subregional connections between northern Lao PDR and \nsurrounding countries. The GMS Transport Sector Strategy Study (TSSS)1 identified the Project \nas a high priority transport project that will link northern Lao PDR with Thailand. The feasibility \nstudy  for  the  Project  was  prepared  through  an  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  technical \nassistance (TA).2 The design and monitoring framework for the Project is in Appendix 1. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  Transport in Lao PDR is mostly by road, which carries about 70% of freight and 90% of \npassenger traffic. The main road transport network is fairly well-developed, except in the north \nwhere major gaps remain. The density of the road network is low, at about 0.14 kilometers (km) \nper square kilometer (km2). The provincial capital of Xaignabouri, through which Route 4 (the \nproject road) passes, is one of the two provincial capitals (of 17 total) without paved road access \nto the national road network. Only 14% of the road network is paved, including about half of the \nprimary highways. The other roads have gravel or earth surfaces and most are barely passable \nduring the wet season. Traffic on the national and provincial roads is generally light throughout \nthe  country  because  of  population  densities  and  resulting  low  economic  activity.  Road \nmaintenance needs to be improved, and issues of road safety and the integration of social and \nenvironmental  concerns  need  to  be  addressed  further.  Ongoing  transport  policy  initiatives \naddress the following: (i) sustainability of the transport network, (ii) reduction of road traffic \naccidents, and (iii) improvement of the capacity of road sector agencies to manage social and \nenvironmental impacts. The road subsector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n4.  Road Maintenance.  As with most developing countries, Lao PDR has not provided \nsufficient financing for road maintenance. To address this issue, the Government established a \nRoad  Maintenance  Fund  (RMF)  in  2001  to  provide  sustainable,  domestic  funding  for \nmaintenance of the national road network, and eventually all roads. At present, 10% of RMF \nrevenues is allocated to the local road network. The RMF receives income from domestic \nrevenue  sources  as  well  as  from  international  sources such  as  the  World  Bank,  Swedish \nInternational Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), and ADB. Domestic revenue sources \ninclude levies on gasoline and diesel fuel, heavy vehicle surcharges, tolls, and international \ntransit charges. Financial and capacity building support has been and continues to be given to \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

", "2     \nthe RMF under the ADB-funded Rural Access Roads Project3 and Roads for Rural Development \nProject;4 the World Bank-funded Road Maintenance Projects I and II; and the Sida-financed \nLao-Swedish Road Sector Projects I, II, and III. The target is that 90% of funding for the national \nroad network will be sourced from domestic funds by 2014. This is consistent with ADB\u2019s \nstrategy for the Lao PDR road sector (para. 11), which addresses a number of sector issues. \nThe World Bank program is helping the RMF develop systems to prepare strategic and annual \nmaintenance plans and to implement these plans. During the period encompassing fiscal years \n2005  through  2007,  domestic  sources  have  provided KN245.6  billion  (62.1%  of  total  road \nmaintenance financing). The World Bank has provided KN122.2 billion (30.9%), and Sida has \nprovided  KN27.8  billion  (7.0%).  Although  the  RMF  still  relies  on  international  sources  of \nfinancing, progress has been made in increasing income from domestic sources. RMF income \nfrom domestic sources has increased from KN10.2 billion in fiscal year 2002 to KN110.8 billion \nin fiscal year 2007 (planned). In 2006, the Government increased the fuel levy from KN100 per \nliter to KN200 per liter. Further increases will be needed to meet targets for domestic financing \nof road maintenance. While the RMF has been successful in improving road maintenance, \nadditional improvement is necessary\u2014particularly in the areas of developing road maintenance \nprograms that maximize benefits, improving governance, and generating additional revenue.5 \nRMF development is being addressed through changes in government regulations and policy, \nwith the substantial assistance of international donor agencies led by the World Bank. \n \n5.  Road Safety. Lao PDR has a poor road safety record. An ADB-financed study found that \ntraffic accidents cost Lao PDR about $47 million per year, or roughly 2.7% of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP).6 The Government has recognized the need to improve road safety and reduce \naccidents by establishing a National Road Safety Committee chaired by the deputy prime \nminister and including the minister of communications, transport, posts, and construction; the \nminister for public security; the vice ministers for public health, education and information and \nculture;  and  the  director  general  of  the  Department  of  Transport  (DOT)  in  the  Ministry  of \nCommunications, Transport, Posts, and Construction (MCTPC). The Road Safety Strategy and \nAction Plan (April 2005) has been prepared, and there have been decreases in accident rates \nduring 2004 and 2005. However, it is expected that the number of vehicles will increase and \nroad safety will require more attention. With the level of transit traffic (especially heavily loaded \ntrucks) increasing under the GMS agreements, road safety awareness and enforcement must \nbe increased to ensure that vehicle and truck drivers from other countries are aware of traffic \nrules and safety procedures in Lao PDR. The ADB-funded Roads for Rural Development Project \n(footnote 4) includes a component that is currently assisting with the implementation of key \ncomponents of the National Road Safety Strategy.7 Under the ongoing project\u2019s work plan, the \nproject road will be included in its 2008\u20132010 program because it is a national road and a GMS \nroad\u2014both criteria for targeting resources to higher use and the thus higher risk roads. \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2000.

Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Regional Cooperation \n6.  One of the major impediments to building subregional economic cooperation is the poor \nstate of basic infrastructure. In the northern GMS, sections of key transport corridors have \nalready  been  developed  but  significant  gaps  remain.  There  is  a  need  to  improve  the \nconnections between the provincial centers and the northern region of Lao PDR and to improve \nconnections between Lao PDR and neighboring countries within the GMS. The overall objective \nof the ADB-financed GMS TSSS (footnote 1) is to establish a well-built, seamless, multi-modal \nsubregional transport network that will contribute significantly to fully \u201cconnecting\u201d the GMS. The \nstrategic objectives include completing the transport corridors critical to linking the subregion \nand promoting trade and investment; coordinating strategies to ensure that transport corridors \nevolve into economic corridors, enabling agricultural diversification, industrialization, and the \ncreation of employment opportunities; reducing nonphysical barriers to the movement of people, \ngoods,  and  services;  and  accelerating  the  implementation  of  the  required  \u201csoftware\u201d \narrangements, including expediting implementation of the Cross Border Transit Agreement. \n \n7.  Future development of Lao PDR\u2019s economy will depend on expanding and upgrading \nconnections with its neighboring GMS countries8 to provide linkages that will enable transport of \nproduce and goods to local and international markets. The Project will form part of the new \nGMS Northeastern Corridor (encompassing Nanning in Guangxi Province, PRC; Hanoi and \nThanh  Hoa  in  Viet  Nam;  Louangphrabang,  Lao  PDR;  and  Bangkok,  Thailand)  which  was \nidentified in the TSSS. The upgrading of the project road will connect (i) districts in central and \nsouthern Xaignabouri province, (ii) the provincial capitals of Louangphrabang and Xaignabouri \nwith a sealed all-weather road, and (iii) the border crossing with Thailand near Kenthaowith the \n \nGMS corridors that converge on Louangphrabang. These connections will reduce transport \ncosts from the important agricultural areas in southern Xaignabouri to markets in Thailand. \n \n2.  Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction \n8.  Despite considerable progress over three decades of independence, Lao PDR remains \none of the poorest countries in the Asia and Pacific region. A small domestic market, the \nsubsistence  orientation  of  a  large  segment  of  the  rural  population,  skill  shortages,  and \nremoteness and isolation are among the key structural factors constraining growth and poverty \nreduction. Geographical isolation is a major cause of poverty in Lao PDR, as large segments of \nthe rural population have little access to markets, employment opportunities, or social services. \nThe Government considers road access to be one of the keys to eradicating poverty, and it is a \nmajor focus of the National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy.9 Substantial external \nsupport has been devoted over the last 15 years to alleviating these problems by rehabilitating \nand modernizing the nation\u2019s transport infrastructure, but additional assistance is necessary to \nimprove the country\u2019s transport network (para. 3). \n \n9.  The  project  area  includes  seven  districts 10  of  Louangphrabang  and  Xaignabouri \nprovinces in northern Lao PDR, which is generally poorer than other regions of the country. The \ntotal population in the project area is 386,000\u2014of whom about 311,000 people live in districts \nthrough which the project road passes, and about 103,000 people live in about 120 villages \n                                                 \n8  Cambodia, PRC, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n9  Lao PDR. 2004.

Xaignabouri district is designated by the Government as one of 47 priority \npoverty districts in Lao PDR. Another district (Xieng Hong) in Xaignabouri province, outside the \nproject area, is also one of the priority poverty districts. In addition, three other districts (Khop, \nHongsa, and Nguen) in the two provinces are among 25 districts classified as poor. Agriculture \nremains the key source of income and livelihood for most of the population. The districts in the \nproject area are aggressively addressing poverty eradication through agricultural development, \nwhile providing upgraded health care and access to education. The project area has access to \nThai markets via the project road. Export markets for agricultural goods produced in the project \narea are considerable\u2014e.g., the combined Chinese-Thai import demand for maize is estimated \nat 5\u20136 million tons per year, and the Thai demand for imported cattle at 2 million head per year. \nFarmers in the project area are responding, and shifting from slash and burn agriculture to \nintensified commercial production; their yields have increased to the point that they are roughly \ndouble the national average for crops such as maize.  \n10.  Poverty  incidence  in  the  provinces  encompassing  the  project  area  has  declined \nsubstantially, from 59% in 1993 to 26% in 2004 in Louangphrabang and from 30% in 1993 to \n21% in 2004 in Xaignabouri.11 The reduction of poverty in the project area is due in large part to \nincreased agricultural exports, which are dependent on the project districts\u2019 access to national \nroads, even if they are not all-weather roads. Given the available markets and demonstrated \nwillingness to adopt new practices and technologies, there is great potential for further poverty \nreduction. The Project will facilitate the continuation and enhancement of the poverty reduction \ntrend. Upgrading the project road to an all-weather road providing year-round access will enable \nlower cost transport services and facilitate greater exports from the project area. The improved \nroad will encourage the development of tourism and other service industries in the project area \nby providing suitable road conditions for tourists traveling from Thailand to Louangphrabang, \nwhich will reduce poverty further through job creation and economic diversification. \n3.  Government and ADB Strategy \n11.  The Project is fully consistent with ADB\u2019s long-term strategic objectives for regional \ncooperation in the GMS and for Lao PDR, and with the Government\u2019s strategy. Under the GMS \nProgram, ADB is supporting the completion and expansion of strategic transport corridors (para. \n6). ADB\u2019s strategy for Lao PDR is to assist the Government to manage the road network as a \nvital development asset\u2014support will be provided to the Government to expand access and \nextend the economic life of the main road network by (i) rehabilitating selected parts of the \nnetwork, (ii) reforming sector regulations and supporting private sector investments along the \nGMS road corridors, (iii) assisting in securing sustainable maintenance of the road network \nthrough the RMF, (iv) building capacity to strengthen road network management skills, (v) \nsupporting improvement of rural transport infrastructure, and (vi) supporting the implementation \nof the National Road Safety Strategy and Action Plan. \n \n12.  The Government\u2019s long-term strategy is \u201cgrowth with equity\u201d to eradicate severe poverty \nand graduate from the status of a least developed country by 2020. Reaching this ambitious \ngoal will require persistent high economic growth, averaging at least 7% per annum from 2005 \nto  2020.  In  turn,  this  will  require  that  industry  and  services\u2014both  of  which  are  transport-\nintensive\u2014grow at average annual rates of 9\u201310% per annum. The Sixth Five-Year National \nSocio-Economic Development Plan (2006\u20132010) identifies the transport sector as critical to \nachieving  long-term  development  goals  because  transport  is  the  primary  vehicle  to  \u201cfully \n                                                 \n11 The  substantial  growth  in  the  tourism  industry  has  led  to  the  greater  decrease  in  poverty  incidence  in \nLouangphrabang relative to Xaignabouri. ", "  5   \nintegrate the economy, thereby providing an enabling environment for trade and commerce and \naccess for all the Lao people to basic services.\u201d 12  The Government has a multi-year plan for \npoverty-focused  transport  sector  development,  which  highlights  the  following  priorities:  (i) \nmaintenance of transport facilities; (ii) investment in transport infrastructure, including a road \nsector development plan to 2020 and detailed plans for air, inland water, and rail transport \ninvestments;  (iii)  strengthening  of  the  regulatory  framework  and  capacity  of  ministry  and \nprovincial or local agencies, including enforcement of a transport safety strategy; (iv) private-\npublic  development,  including  contracting  out  transport  services;  and  (v)  transit  and  trade \nfacilitation,  including  improved  management  and  operational  efficiency  within  the  transport \nsector. Themes developed under the Government\u2019s Northern Region Development Strategy \ninclude  connecting  provincial  centers  within  northern  Lao  PDR  and  improving  connections \nbetween the Lao PDR and neighboring GMS countries. \n \n4.  Lessons  \n13.  The project design incorporates lessons from ADB\u2019s loan and TA operations in general, \nADB\u2019s road subsector operations in Lao PDR, and other projects and TAs in the GMS. ADB has \nbeen a major financier of the main east-west and north-south economic corridors in Lao PDR, \nboth of which are based on road links. ADB-financed projects in the transport sector have \nsuccessfully contributed to providing access and communications, thereby helping to stimulate \nthe economy and reduce isolation. The 2006 country assistance program evaluation (CAPE) for \nLao PDR13 found that ADB\u2019s assistance to the transport sector in Lao PDR was efficient and \nhighly relevant, and had likely sustainability prospects and substantial institutional development \nand other effects. The CAPE noted that, while most transport projects suffered from long \nimplementation  delays,  these  had  been  substantially  reduced  under  the  most  recently \ncompleted road improvement project. The CAPE recommended that future transport sector \nprojects in Lao PDR should continue to support road maintenance and road safety, increase \ncommunity  participation,  and  strengthen  MCTPC\u2019s  capacity  and  awareness  in  socio-\nenvironmental management. One lesson learned from ADB\u2019s impact evaluation study on rural \nroads and poverty reduction14 is that the long-term benefits of road projects can be threatened \nby neglecting road maintenance. The Project is addressing the issue of implementation delays \nby including a 6-year implementation period and using design-construct contracts for the civil \nworks packages financed in part or whole by ADB. The Project includes specific components to \naddress the road maintenance and road safety issues. Social and environmental concerns will \nbe addressed through the project supervision consultants working closely with MCTPC staff to \nbuild on the experience gained through completed and ongoing road sector TAs and loans. \n \n5.  External Assistance \n14.  ADB has been a major contributor to development of the road sector in Lao PDR by \nproviding  12  loans  amounting  to  $336.7  million  and  TA  grants  totaling  about  $15  million \n(Appendix 3). ADB\u2019s assistance to the sector represents about 35% of the more than $750 \nmillion of assistance by multilateral and bilateral organizations. Most of the external financing \nhas been directed to national and provincial roads, as well as to bridges over the Mekong River. \nADB has provided policy and planning support as well as institutional strengthening to the \n                                                 \n12 Government of Lao PDR.

OFID,  the \ngovernments of Japan and the PRC, and Sida are the other main partners providing financial \nand technical support for the development of roads, bridges, and rural market access. ADB has \nalso taken a leading role in assisting Lao PDR in implementing the National Road Safety \nStrategy and Action Plan, with financing from the Nordic Development Fund and Sida. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The Project will facilitate regional cooperation and increased economic growth in the \nGMS by improving the national highway linking the Louangphrabang area with the Lao PDR-\nThailand border. Improvement of this road, much of which is currently gravel and earth, will \nfacilitate increased exports to Thailand of agricultural goods produced in the project area and \nincreased tourism from Thailand to Louangphrabang and northern Lao PDR generally. The \nimpact of the Project will be increased trade and economic growth in the project area and the \nregion. The outcome will be more efficient transport on the regional and national road networks.  \n  \nB.  Outputs \n16.   The Project comprises (i) improvement of 367 km of the project road from Xiang Ngeun \n(the junction with National Route 13 near Louangphrabang) to Nakha (on the border with \nThailand), construction of a bridge over the Mekong River on the project road and improvement \nof about 100 km of rural access roads in the project area; (ii) procurement of equipment for use \nin operating and facilitating the border crossing at Kenthao (now under construction) and for \nenforcement of axle-load controls on the project road; (iii) consulting services for construction \nsupervision and monitoring and evaluation as well as detailed design for the rural access roads; \n(iv)  maintenance  of  the  national  road  network  by  financing  periodic  road  maintenance \nsubprojects; (v) improvement of road safety by financing consulting services to continue the \nongoing road safety assistance program; and (vi) a program to reduce the risks of HIV/AIDS \nand human trafficking that may develop during the rehabilitation and operation of the project \nroad.  \n \n17.  The project road will be improved to the national road standard with a typical 9 meter (m) \nwide formation in flat and rolling terrain, 7 m in mountainous terrain, and 10 m in urban and \ndistrict centers. The road will be upgraded from its existing gravel and earth pavement to a \npavement of double bituminous surface treatment with single bituminous surface treatment on \nthe shoulders. The southernmost section, which has less traffic than the remainder of the road, \nwill be upgraded to a 5.5 m wide single bituminous surface treatment or double bituminous \nsurface treatment pavement. Several bridges and culverts will be replaced or repaired under the \nProject, and drainage works will be undertaken. The Project includes improvement of about \n100 km of rural access roads feeding into the project road. These roads will typically be 5.5 m \nwide gravel roads, with single bituminous surface treatment in sections passing through villages \nto reduce the health effects of dust caused by traffic. \n \n                                                 \n15 ADB.  2000.

The  Project  also  includes  construction  of  a  bridge  across  the  Mekong  River  from \nXaignabouri Province to Louangphrabang Province at Tha Deua-Pakkhone on the project road \nalignment, including construction of new connection roads to the existing road alignment, bridge \napproaches, and the bridge structure. The proposed location is about 500 m downstream of the \nlocation of the existing ferry station. The total length of the approach roads and bridge is about \n1.7 km, including the 475 m bridge. \n \n19.  The Project will also finance periodic road maintenance subprojects, to be identified \nusing the RMF\u2019s road maintenance management system and approved by ADB, in cooperation \nwith other international institutions providing assistance for road maintenance. \n \nC.  ADF IX Grant \n20.  A working paper on Revising the Framework for Asian Development Fund Grants, which \nproposes revisions to the ADF grant framework, was discussed by the Board on 24 July 2007.  \nThe  policy  paper  on  the  revised  framework  will  be  considered  by  the  Board  around  26 \nSeptember 2007. The working paper provided that for countries eligible for grant assistance, the \nlevel of grants in the country program will be based on a country\u2019s debt-distress classification. \nFor 2007, Lao PDR is classified as a country with high risk of debt distress and is therefore \neligible to receive 100% grant assistance.   \n \nD.  Special Features \n1.  Rural Access Roads \n21.  The Project will improve about 100 km of rural access roads in the project area to enable \nrural communities to maximize their benefits from the improved national road. Improved access \nto Route 4 will facilitate (i) transport of their agricultural produce to domestic and international \nmarkets, and (ii) access to economic opportunities and social services available in the larger \ncommunities in the project area. MCTPC has identified about 15 rural access roads for potential \ninclusion in the Project, but prioritization and selection of the roads will only be done during \nproject implementation. The access roads to be included in the Project will be selected on the \nbasis of agreed criteria including the number of people expected to benefit, poverty level of \nbeneficiaries, minimal amount of resettlement and environmental impact, and cost.  \n  \n2.  Road Safety Improvement Program \n22.  The Project includes consulting services to assist the DOT of MCTPC in implementing \nthe Road Safety Strategy and Road Safety Action Plan, including (i) providing training on the \nsafety audit policy and guidelines commenced under the ongoing Roads for Rural Development \nProject (footnote 4) to all provincial Departments of Communications, Transport, Posts, and \nConstruction (DCTPCs) and ensuring that all DCTPCs have the capacity to administer road \nsafety audits and implement the results; (ii) assisting DOT to coordinate with the relevant \nprovincial DCTPCs in implementing road safety audits on all national roads and provincial roads \nwithin their provinces, including the project road; (iii) assisting in training in inspections for \nvehicle roadworthiness and safety standards; (iv) arranging international training in road safety \nfor staff of the National Road Safety Committee Secretariat; (v) coordinating with international \nagencies involved in road safety in current and proposed road safety projects; and (vi) ensuring \nappropriate training is carried out in all the road safety initiatives. The terms of reference for the \nroad safety component are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n ", "8     \n3.  Road Maintenance \n23.  The Project will include funding for periodic road maintenance to help address funding \ndeficits for road maintenance until domestic resources can finance the RMF on a sustainable \nbasis. The financing will be applied to periodic maintenance of subprojects identified by the \nRMF\u2019s  road  maintenance  management  system.  ADB  will  approve  contracts  based  on \nevaluations prepared using standard RMF procedures, in accordance with procedures being \nused on the ongoing ADB-financed Roads for Rural Development Project (footnote 4) and in \ncooperation with the ongoing World Bank-financed Road Maintenance Project (Phase II). \n \n4.  HIV/AIDS Awareness and Prevention of Human Trafficking Program \n24.  The Project will include an HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention of human trafficking \nprogram (HIV/AIDS and human trafficking program) in the construction camps, towns, hotspots, \nand rural areas of the project area. The program will be implemented by the Environmental and \nSocial Division of the Department of Roads (DOR), through the Provincial Committee for Control \nof AIDS, District Committee for Control of AIDS, and the Provincial Lao Women\u2019s Union as \nimplementing agencies. The program will be implemented throughout the project period. As part \nof this program, the implementing agencies\u2019 institutional capacity for effective planning and \nimplementation of the program will be strengthened. National consultants will be recruited to \ncarry out the institutional strengthening and to monitor the HIV/AIDS and human trafficking \nprogram in the project districts. The awareness and prevention program includes: (i) advocacy \nactions on HIV/AIDS and human trafficking; (ii) information and education campaigns for all \nethnic groups in their respective sociocultural context; (iii) provision of HIV/AIDS and sexually \ntransmitted infections (STIs) medical packages to clinics and medical centers along the project \nroad; (iv) developing community level contact people for community mobilization and awareness \non HIV/AIDS and human trafficking, and community monitoring; (v) mobilization of existing \npoverty programs on agriculture and village development for poor households, with special \nfocus on targeting indigenous peoples\u2019 households to minimize their vulnerability and potential \nrisk for human trafficking; and (vi) developing monitoring indicators on HIV/AIDS and human \ntrafficking by gender and ethnicity. A detailed description of and the terms of reference for the \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking program are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \nE.  Project Investment Plan \n25.   The project investment cost is estimated at $88.5 million, including taxes and duties \nestimated at $5.6 million equivalent (Table 1). The cost estimates are based on quantities \nderived from preliminary engineering designs and market prices for goods and materials, and \ninclude  the  costs  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  environmental  mitigation  and \nmonitoring.16 The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 4.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n16 Environmental mitigation and monitoring costs are estimated at about $800,000 and are included in the cost \nestimates for civil works and consulting services for construction supervision.

Financing Plan \n26.   The Government has requested a grant of $27.0 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources to help finance a portion of the project costs. The Government is also seeking loans \nfrom OFID in the amount of $11.0 million equivalent and from the Republic of Korea for $22.4 \nmillion equivalent, and a grant from the Government of Australia in the amount of $14.5 million \nequivalent. Cofinancing in the amounts specified above is included in co-financiers\u2019 programs, \nand formal approval is expected by early 2008. In the unlikely event that cofinancing does not \nmaterialize,  the  project  scope  could  be  reduced  and  financing  allocations  of  categories \nrearranged accordingly, and the Project would remain viable. The OFID and Government of \nAustralia financing will be provided as joint cofinancing.  Financing from the Republic of Korea \nwill be provided as parallel cofinancing, will be denominated in won (W), and will have a term of \n30 years including a grace period of 10 years. The OFID loan and Government of Australia \ngrant will be administered by ADB. The Government will provide counterpart financing of $13.6 \nmillion, including $5.6 million in taxes. The financing plan is shown in Table 2.  \n \n27.  ADB typically seeks approval from its Board of Directors for the administration of grant \nand/or loan funds from co-financiers only when cofinancing commitments are in place. Approval \nfor the proposed loan funding from OFID will be in March 2008 and for grant funding from the \nGovernment of Australia in September 2007. To facilitate project implementation, the Board is \nrequested to approve the administration of the proposed loan in an amount not exceeding the \nequivalent of $11 million from OFID and a grant in the amount not exceeding the equivalent of \n$14.5 million from the Government of Australia, which are expected to be confirmed subsequent \nto the date of Board approval. Approval from each of the co-financiers will be reported to the \nBoard in accordance with the standard reporting procedures. If either OFID or the Government \n ", "10    \nof Australia does not approve the loan and grant financing, the portions that they are due to \nfinance  will  not  be  financed  under  the  Project.  Alternatively,  the  Government  may  make \nalternative arrangements, satisfactory to ADB, to cover the funding shortfall. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nSource  Total    % \nAsian Development Bank  27.0    30.5 \nOPEC Fund for International Development  11.0    12.4 \nGovernment of Australia  14.5    16.4 \nGovernment of Republic of Korea  22.4    25.3 \nGovernment of Lao PDRa  13.6    15.4 \n  Total  88.5    100.0 \na  Includes $5.6 million in taxes.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n28.  MCTPC  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  and  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall \ntechnical supervision and execution of the Project. DOR will be the Implementing Agency and \nwill  be  responsible  for  the  direct  supervision  and  execution  of  the  Project.  The  Project \nManagement Division of DOR, which is responsible for managing all DOR projects, will carry out \nthe functions of a project management unit. No separate project management unit will be \nestablished. DOR will appoint a full-time project manager, who will be responsible for the day-to-\nday management of the Project. The project manager will be supported by a full-time deputy \nproject manager, who will be appointed from the Xaignabouri Province DCTPC. A full-time \ndeputy project manager for the components financed by the Republic of Korea will be appointed \nfrom the Louangphrabang Province DCTPC. The project manager and deputy project manager \nwill  (i)  prepare  the  overall  project  implementation  plan;  (ii)  provide  overall  construction \nsupervision;  (iii)  carry  out  a  public  awareness  campaign  on  HIV/AIDS;  (iv)  monitor  and \nsupervise all project management activities; (v) carry out procurement together with the Project \nManagement Division; (vi) organize monitoring and evaluation activities; (vii) prepare necessary \nproject progress and project completion reports to be submitted to MCTPC and ADB; and \n(viii) ensure full compliance with ADB\u2019s resettlement, environment, and other safeguards and \npolicies. The project manager and deputy project manager will receive support from other \nMCTPC staff and the project implementation and monitoring consultants. The consultants\u2019 team \nleader will be the engineer for the civil works and will provide support to the project manager. \nADB has been working closely with MCTPC and DOR for several years on other road subsector \nprojects. ADB believes that MCTPC and DOR have, with consultant support, the capacity to \nmanage  the  Project  effectively.  The  financial  management  assessment  of  MCTPC  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix C. The HIV/AIDS and human trafficking program will be implemented \nby DOR\u2019s Environmental and Social Division through the Provincial Committee for Control of \nAIDS,  District  Committees  for  Control  of  AIDS,  and  the  Lao  Women\u2019s  Union.  The  project \nimplementation and monitoring consultants will help strengthen the institutional capacity of \nthese agencies (para. 31). \n ", "  11   \n2.  Implementation Period \n29.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  about  6  years,  including  pre-\nconstruction activities, with completion by the end of 2013. The implementation schedule is in \nAppendix 5. \n \n3.  Procurement \n30.  The contract packages financed by the ADB and the Government of Australia grants and \nOFID  loan  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). Procurement of civil works under the component funded by the \nRepublic of Korea will be subject to Government of Korea procedures. Civil works along the \nproject road have been initially packaged into five contracts. The bridge over the Mekong River \nwill be combined with a road package to be funded by the Republic of Korea. The civil works \ncontracts that will be financed by ADB, OFID, and the Government of Australia will be procured \nusing international competitive bidding (ICB) with prequalification and will be subject to prior \nreview. The ICB contracts will include the detailed engineering design, and construction of the \nworks. Smaller civil works contracts for rural access roads and periodic road maintenance \nsubprojects partly or wholly financed by ADB and costing up to $1 million, may follow national \ncompetitive bidding (NCB) procedures and will be subject to post review. Other supply contracts \nthat are not expected to exceed $100,000 in value will be procured through shopping or direct \ncontracting.17 ADB has approved the Government\u2019s request for advance contracting action for \nprocurement of civil works, goods, and services. Relevant sections of ADB\u2019s anticorruption \npolicy(1998, as amended to date) will be included in all bidding documents and contracts. The \n \nprocurement plan and details of proposed contract packages for the Project are in Appendix 6. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n31.  For the ADB-financed or administered components of the Project, the Government will \nengage an international consulting firm supported by national consultants for design review; \nconstruction  supervision;  environmental  supervision  and  management;  updating, \nimplementation, and monitoring of the resettlement plan (including indigenous peoples\u2019 specific \nactions, and implementation and monitoring of the gender strategy); HIV/AIDS and human \ntrafficking program; and project performance monitoring. It is envisaged that 97 person-months \nof international consultants and 2,376 person-months of national consultants will be required. \nInternational  consultants  for  the  Project  will  be  recruited  using  the  quality  and  cost-based \nselection method and a full technical proposal in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The Government was advised that, for the \nrecruitment of consultants, advance contracting is the normal procedure and that ADB\u2019s support \nof advance contracting does not commit ADB to approve the grant project or to finance the \nrecruitment costs. The advance recruitment will not include signing of contracts. The draft terms \nof reference for the consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix D. Under the Republic \nof Korea-funded components, a single package of consulting services will be engaged for \ndetailed  design  and  construction  supervision.  Tasks  for  consultants  for  the  road  safety \ncomponent  represent  a  natural  continuation  of  services  being  provided  by  international \n                                                 \n17 Direct contracting will be used for vehicle weigh scales for purposes of standardization with scales already or being \nprocured under other ADB-funded projects including the Roads for Rural Development Project (footnote 4) and the \nNorthern Economic Corridor Project (ADB. 2002.

Manila) and the Heavy Transport Management Program implemented \nunder the World Bank-funded RMP. \n ", "12    \nconsultants under Loan 2085-LAO (footnote 4) funded by NDF Credit 426 and Sida. To provide \ncontinuity in technical approach, this international consulting firm18 will be engaged through a \nseparate contract for consulting services for the road safety component (para. 22) using the \nsingle source selection method and a biodata technical proposal. It is envisaged that about 9 \nperson-months of international consultants and 9 person-months of national consultants will be \nrequired. Consulting services for the HIV/AIDS and human trafficking program will be included in \nthe  terms  of  reference  for  the  project  implementation  consultants  and  will  strengthen  the \ninstitutional capacity of the Provincial Committee for Control of AIDS, District Committees for \nControl  of  AIDS,  and  the  Lao  Women\u2019s  Union  and  assist  them  with  effective  planning, \nimplementation, and monitoring of the HIV/AIDS and human trafficking program. \n   \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n32.  The Government was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy and Policy relating to the \nCombating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism.  Consistent  with  its \ncommitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and  transparency,  ADB  will  require  the \nGovernment to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. The legal documentation between ADB and the Government will \nfurther allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions \nspecifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EA and all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n33.  The  Project  incorporates  several  other  measures,  in  addition  to  the  standard  ADB \nrequirements, to deter corruption and increase transparency. The Project will (i) build the EA\u2019s \ncapacity  to  comply  with  ADB  and  government  procedures  as  outlined  in  the  project \nadministration manual; (ii) establish a project website to disclose information about project \nimplementation;  and  (iii)  establish  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  to  ensure  greater \naccountability.  The  project  website  will  provide  updated,  detailed  information  on  project \nimplementation. For example, the website will include procurement-related information such as \nthe list of participating bidders, name of the winning bidder, basic details on bidding procedures \nadopted, amount of contract awarded, and the list of goods/services procured. The grievance \nredress mechanism will be set up to receive and resolve complaints and act upon stakeholders\u2019 \nreports of irregularities on project-related matters, including grievances concerning resettlement. \nThe EA will widely publicize the existence of this mechanism to ensure that stakeholders are \naware that there is a venue to address concerns or grievances relating to fraud, corruption, \nabuse, and any other aspects of project implementation. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n34.  All disbursements under the ADB and the Government of Australia grants, and OFID \nloan will be carried out in accordance with the ADB Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as \namended from time to time).  An imprest account will be established for the Project at the Bank \nof the Lao PDR. The initial advance to and the ceiling of the imprest account will be based on \nestimated expenditures for the first 6 months to be paid out of the imprest account or 10% of the \ntotal ADB grant amount, whichever is lower. The imprest account will be established, managed, \nreplenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and \n                                                 \n18 Swedish National Road Consulting AB (SweRoad). ", "  13   \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between the Government and ADB. The statement of \nexpenditures procedure will be used to reimburse/liquidate eligible expenditures under contracts \nnot exceeding $50,000. Disbursement arrangements for the loan from the Republic of Korea will \nfollow Government of the Republic of Korea procedures. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n35.   MCTPC will maintain separate accounts for the Project, and have such accounts and \nrelated financial statements audited annually by an external auditor in accordance with auditing \nstandards acceptable to ADB. MCTPC will submit to ADB, within 6 months of the close of the \nfiscal year, certified copies of audited project accounts and financial statements and auditor's \nreports, all in English. The audit of such financial statements will include (i) an assessment of \nthe adequacy of accounting and internal control systems with respect to project expenditures \nand other financial transactions, (ii) an assessment of compliance with financial grant covenants \nand ADB requirements for project management, (iii) an opinion on the use of the statement of \nexpenditures procedure, and (iv) an opinion on the use of the imprest account.  \n \n36.  MCTPC  will  report  the  progress  of  project  implementation  by  submitting  quarterly \nprogress reports to ADB and the co-financiers. The form and content of the progress reports will \nbe agreed with ADB and the co-financiers during the project inception mission. MCTPC will \nmonitor project implementation in accordance with the project implementation schedule, and will \nkeep ADB and the co-financiers informed of any significant deviations from the schedule. The \nquarterly  reports  will  include  summary  information  on  basic  data,  utilization  of  funds, \nachievement of immediate development objectives, compliance with covenants, implementation \nprogress, land acquisition, and resettlement progress, and major issues and problems. Within 3 \nmonths of the Project\u2019s physical completion, MCTPC will submit to ADB and the co-financiers a \nproject completion report which will provide a detailed evaluation of the project design, costs, \ncontractors\u2019 and consultants\u2019 performance, social and economic impact, economic internal rate \nof return (EIRR), and such other details as may be requested by ADB.  \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n37.  A set of indicators for evaluating project performance in relation to its impacts, outcomes, \noutputs, and conditions will be agreed to by MCTPC and ADB during inception or before \ncommencement  of  civil  works,  whichever  is  earlier.  The  baseline  data  will  be  collected \nimmediately afterwards but not later than 9 months after the effective date, and will include \namong others (i) economic development and socioeconomic indicators, (ii) transport costs and \ntimes, (iii) transport charges, (iv) accident rates, (v) international and total traffic levels, (vi) \naffected persons\u2019 incomes, (vii) access to social services, (viii) jobs created in construction and \nmaintenance, (ix) incidence of STIs, and (x) incidence of human trafficking. At the beginning of \nproject implementation, MCTPC will establish baseline and target values for the indicators. The \nindicators will be measured and compared with the baseline at project inception, completion, \nand after 3 years. Where relevant, indicators will be disaggregated by gender and ethnicity. The \nproject implementation consultants will help establish the monitoring and evaluation system, and \ntrain MCTPC staff in its use. The main sources of data will include (i) secondary data from \ngovernment sources, (ii) a household socioeconomic sample survey, and (iii) participatory rapid \nappraisal. MCTPC will submit to ADB a report summarizing the key findings of monitoring at \ninception, completion, and 3 years after physical completion of the Project. \n ", "14    \n9.  Project Review \n38.  ADB, the Government, and the co-financiers will conduct regular annual reviews of the \nProject, and will jointly undertake a midterm review of the Project in mid-2010 to assess (i) \nimplementation status, (ii) design and construction standards, (iii) performance of consultants \nand contractors, (iv) project impacts, (v) status of compliance with the covenants stipulated in \nthe grant agreement, and (vi) the need for any changes in the project scope or schedule to \nachieve the project impact. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Traffic Forecast \n39.  Traffic forecasts by vehicle type were prepared for the project road sections for 2007\u2013\n2032 (Appendix 7). The forecasts are based on expected growth in GDP, income elasticities of \ndemand, and analysis of regional trade and tourism patterns. Total traffic is forecast to grow at \nannual  rates  of  about  15.4\u201316.7%  during  2007\u20132017  (the  years  during  and  immediately \nfollowing project implementation), except for the section including the bridge, which has higher \ngrowth. The high growth rates during 2007\u20132017 are due in large part to the development of \ngenerated traffic following project completion. International traffic, in particular, is expected to \ngrow at a high rate during this period as the improved road allows for trucks and other vehicles \nto travel throughout the year. Total traffic is forecast to grow at annual rates of about 6.8\u20138.6% \nduring 2017\u20132032. The projected growth rates are reasonable considering expected economic \ngrowth in the project area and experience in other ADB-financed road projects. Generated traffic \narises from increased shipments of agricultural commodities and other goods, and increased \npassenger traffic carrying tourists between Thailand and Louangphrabang. The improved road \nconditions will also generate demand by reducing vehicle operating costs (VOCs). Normal traffic \nis  expected  to  account  for  40\u201360%  of  total  traffic  on  the  project  road.  Generated  traffic \ncomprises 35\u201343% of total traffic. Diverted traffic comprises a relatively small portion of total \ntraffic at 5\u201320%. Motorcycles and small trucks (with fewer than three axles) comprise the largest \nportions of traffic on the project road, reflecting the economic status of residents of the project \narea and the importance to the economy of exports to Thailand. \n \nB.  Economic Benefits \n40.  The economic analysis was carried out for the Project by comparing the with- and \nwithout-project scenarios (Appendix 8). In the without-project scenario, the road is assumed to \nremain  in  its  present  condition.  The  with-project  scenario  includes  routine  and  periodic \nmaintenance according to international standards. The project preparatory technical assistance \nconsidered various mutually exclusive project alternatives such as different pavement types and \nalignments, and the proposed Project is based on the most cost-effective and least-cost option. \nProject economic costs include the resource costs of road improvement and maintenance, \nequipment, and consulting services. The primary economic benefits for the Project are VOC \nsavings, time savings, diverted traffic, savings from improved road safety, and savings from \nreduced maintenance costs. Economic benefits were calculated using the same methodology \nused for costs. VOC savings will accrue primarily from improvements in the road surface, \nhorizontal and vertical alignment, and increased average speed. VOC savings for normal traffic \naccount for about 39% of total benefits while benefits from generated traffic account for about \n22%. Generated traffic is defined as new traffic induced from the reduction in transport costs \narising from the Project, and includes both international and domestic generated traffic. Benefits \nfor generated traffic are estimated at half the value of VOC savings for normal traffic. The ", "  15   \nProject will result in improved average speeds along the project road, and the travel time for the \nentire length of the project road will be reduced from about 8 hours to about 5 hours. Time \nsavings account for about 19.5% of total benefits. Benefits from improved road safety and \nreduced maintenance costs comprise smaller portions of total benefits. The Project will also \nhave other benefits, such as improved access to social services. However, these have not been \nquantified because of lack of sufficient data. \n \n41.  The EIRR for the Project is 16.6%, and the net present value is $22.3 million, using a \n12% discount rate. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the effects of negative changes in \nthe key parameters that determine the benefits and costs of the Project. The EIRRs calculated \nfor the individual sections of the project road are above 12%. The sensitivity analysis for the \nProject indicates that capital costs would have to increase by 49% or total benefits decrease by \n32% for the EIRR to reach the level of 12%. Given ADB\u2019s experience with similar projects in Lao \nPDR, such changes are not expected to occur. The sensitivity analysis shows that the EIRR \nexceeds 12% in all cases. A distribution analysis was carried out. The project benefits accruing \nto  Lao  PDR  are  distributed  among  five  groups:  (i)  users  of  freight  transport,  (ii)  users  of \npassenger transport, (iii) vehicle owners, (iv) labor, and (v) the Government and/or economy of \nLao PDR. Users of passenger transport receive about 25% of total benefits, users of freight \ntransport receive about 19%, vehicle owners receive about 12%, and the Government and/or \nthe economy receive about 42%.  \n \nC.  Resettlement \n42.   The Project is rated category A, and a full resettlement plan (RP) has been prepared for \nthe whole length of Route 4 and the Mekong River bridge. The RP identified 255 project \naffected households.  Of the 43 dwelling units totally affected, only 11 units need to be relocated \nto new plots. Of the 15 totally affected shops, only 1 has to be relocated to a new plot. Impacts \non paddy land along Route 4 are minimal (not more than 7.5% loss of total productive land per \naffected  household),  so  there  will  be  no  significant  impacts  on  the  livelihood  of  affected \nhouseholds. However, for the Mekong River bridge, 12 households will lose more than 10% of \ntheir productive land (paddy and teak plantations). The RP ensures that all those affected, \nirrespective of their tenure status, will be able to restore if not improve their socioeconomic \nconditions through the project entitlements, as shown in the summary resettlement plan and \nframework  (Appendix  9).  Land  acquisition  and  relocation  of  affected  households  cannot \ncommence  until  the  updated  RP  has  been  reviewed  and  approved  by  ADB.  Affected \nhouseholds will not be displaced from affected land until the province allocates alternative land \nfor them within the same or a neighboring village or compensation is paid that is sufficient to \npurchase suitable alternative land within the same or a neighboring village. An independent \nmonitor will be engaged prior to RP updating for regular monitoring and evaluation. Particular \nattention has been given to the specific needs and concerns of indigenous peoples and other \nvulnerable groups such as the landless; poor; and households headed by women, disabled, \nelderly, or children without means of support. Specific actions for indigenous peoples and a \ngender  strategy  are  included  in  the  RP.  MCTPC  has  identified  15  rural  access  roads  for \npotential inclusion in the Project, but prioritization and selection will be done during project \nimplementation. A resettlement framework has been prepared to guide in preparation and \nimplementation of RPs for all rural access roads with land acquisition and resettlement impacts.  \n \nD.  Social Impact and Gender \n43.  The Project will provide direct social benefits in addition to the economic benefits which \nwill expand economic opportunities available to the poor. The project road passes through \n ", "16    \nlargely agricultural areas that are in transition from production for subsistence consumption and \nfor local markets to more export and commercially oriented crops. Rural women in the project \ndistricts are engaged in both subsistence and commercial agriculture. The upgrading of the \nproject road will provide a strategic all-weather link that will facilitate improved access for men \nand women to goods, markets, schools, medical facilities, and other social services for the \nproject districts. The improved road access will lower the costs for the public sector to provide \nsocial services. The Project will have a positive health impact on people from the approximately \n120 villages located along the road, by improving the very dusty and hazardous road conditions \nin which children walk several kilometers to school during the dry season. Increased access to \ntransport in the project districts will increase enrollment of children from rural areas to the \nsecondary schools in towns. Construction and operation of the road will provide significant \nemployment opportunities for poor people. It is estimated that a total of 8,130 person-months of \nwork will be created during project construction, of which 5,420 will be in the unskilled category. \nPoor men and women will also benefit through seasonal employment from road maintenance \nwork.  Increased  tourism  will  generate  additional  demand  for  locally  produced  goods  and \nservices.  Improvement  of  rural  access  roads  will  help  to  extend  the  project  benefits  and \nopportunities to rural communities. Details on the gender strategy and other impacts of the \nProject are in the summary poverty reduction and social strategy in Appendix 10. \n \n44.  Potential adverse social and gender impacts from the Project, in addition to the Project\u2019s \nresettlement impacts, include (i) increased traffic safety risks for people living and working along \nthe road caused by higher traffic levels and higher vehicle speeds along the improved road; and \n(ii) increased risks of exposure to HIV/AIDS and human trafficking of women and children during \nconstruction and operation because of the influx of construction workers and increased transit \ntraffic. The Project will address these risks through the road safety component and HIV/AIDS \nand human trafficking program. \n \nE.  Indigenous Peoples \n45.  In the project area, 82.3% of the population is classified Lao-Tai (the main ethnic group); \n10.8% Mon-Khmer; 5.8% Hmong-Ewmian; and 0.3% Chinese-Tibetan. The indigenous peoples \ngroups have been relocated to the project area since 1970 because of war and as part of \ngovernment relocation plans. The groups now practice sedentary agriculture and rice farming, \nand have been involved in commercialization of agriculture. Although they retain their traditional \nculture, religion, and social organization, they have adopted mainstream language, education, \nand agricultural practices. The literacy rate among the Mone-Khmer is close to the national \naverage but the Hmong-Ewmian have a literacy rate about half that of the national average. The \nvillage consultation indicates that indigenous peoples groups support the road improvement. \nIndigenous people account for 40% of the 255 households potentially affected by resettlement \n(para. 42). The impact on agricultural land is minor. These groups will benefit from the economic \ndevelopment arising from the Project, including improved access to markets and social services \nand greater opportunities for their roadside small businesses. Since the Project will have no \ndifferential negative impact on indigenous peoples than on the main ethnic group, an indigenous \npeoples development plan is not required. To maximize benefits to indigenous peoples and \nensure that they are not marginalized by resettlement activities, activities specific to indigenous \npeoples are included in the RP, gender strategy, and HIV/AIDS and human trafficking program. \n \nF.  Environmental Assessment \n46.  The  project  classification  is  environment  category  B.  An  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE) of the Project was carried out, reviewed by ADB, and has been approved by ", "  17   \nthe Government which will issue the environmental compliance permit. The summary IEE is in \nAppendix 11. The IEE concludes that the Project will not have any major adverse environmental \nimpacts and only short-term air and water pollution, noise, traffic disturbance, and soil erosion \nimpacts  during  the  construction  period.  The  mitigation  measures  identified  in  the  IEE\u2019s \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) include (i) restoration of affected areas, e.g. borrow \npits, after project completion; (ii) avoiding aggravation of soil erosion-prone areas; (iii) controlling \nsewage discharge and other waste fluids from construction sites, and hazardous and toxic \nmaterials  from  bitumen  plants  and  from  construction  equipment;  (iv)  maintaining  proper \ndrainage to avoid stagnation and controlling downstream water pollution; (v) topsoil removal and \nreinstallation  for  revegetation  upon  completion  of  road  improvement  works;  (vi)  minimizing \nnoise, dust, emissions, and other pollutants associated with civil works; and (vii) provision of \nadequate  road  access  during  construction.  The  Project  will  eliminate  heavy  road  dust \nemissions, thereby reducing safety risks caused by extremely poor road visibility under current \nroad conditions. The road improvement will also reduce associated health risks to roadside \ncommunities. The Project will have overall beneficial environmental impacts and will have minor \nnegative impacts, which will be carefully monitored and adequately mitigated. The EMP covers \nall sections of Route 4 including the bridge over the Mekong River. The EA will be responsible \nfor the EMP implementation and monitoring during pre-construction, construction, and operation \nphases;  and  for  all  project  components,  including  those  financed  by  co-financiers.  The \nconstruction contractors will develop their site-specific environmental management action plans, \nbased on the EMP, to minimize anticipated impacts during construction. The EA will monitor \ncontractors\u2019 compliance with the provisions of the EMP. Detailed information on environmental \nimpact and mitigation measures is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n47.   The final decision on which rural access roads will be improved under the Project will be \nmade during implementation, so the rural access roads are not included in the IEE. The EA, \nwith the assistance of the supervision consultant, will conduct the environmental assessment of \nthe  rural  access  roads  proposed  for  inclusion  in  the  Project,  based  on  the  environmental \nassessment and review procedure included in the IEE and in Supplementary Appendix F.19 The \ncost of the environmental assessment for the rural access roads is included in the supervision \nconsultant\u2019s  budget.  Rural  access  roads  for  logging  or  mining\u2014or  those  passing  through \nprotected forests, protected wetlands, or rare habitats\u2014will not be selected. \n \nG.  Risks \n48.  The  Project  is  formulated  to  minimize  potential  risks  during  and  after  project \nimplementation. The traffic forecast may not materialize, but the Project remains viable even \nwith  substantially  lower  traffic  levels.  There  is  a  risk  that  the  road  may  not  be  properly \nmaintained,  but  this  will  be  addressed  by  the  emphasis  of  ADB  and  other  international \ninstitutions,  and  the  commitment  of  the  Government  to  road  maintenance.  Compensation, \nassistance, and income restoration measures relating to involuntary resettlement might not be \ndelivered  on  time,  thereby  delaying  the  start  of  civil  works.  The  gender  strategy  includes \nconsultation  workshops  for  the  affected  households  to  increase  their  understanding  of \nresettlement  issues  such  as  entitlements,  compensation,  and  the  grievance  process.  The \nproject supervision consultants will include specialists to help the EA manage resettlement, \nenvironmental impacts, and ethnic minority specific activities. These resources will also assist in \nensuring that the safeguard policies are complied with. Upgrading of the road will increase the \nmobility of goods and people along the route and could increase risks of HIV/AIDS and human \ntrafficking  in  local  communities,  especially  among  women  and  children.  To  minimize  the \n                                                 \n19 In accordance with ADB Operations Manual Section F1/BP. \n ", "18    \npotential risks of increased road traffic accidents, HIV/AIDS, and human trafficking, the Project \nincludes a road safety program and an HIV/AIDS and human trafficking program.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n49.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and MCTPC have given the \nfollowing specific assurances, which will be incorporated into the legal documents. \n \n(i)  The Government will provide counterpart funds for project implementation on \ntime. MTCPC will make timely submission of annual budgetary appropriation \nrequest  to  the  Committee  for  Planning  and  Investment  and  MOF;  MOF  will \nensure prompt disbursement of appropriated funds during each year of project \nimplementation. \n \n(ii)  MCTPC and the relevant DCTPCs will be responsible for the operation and \nmaintenance  of  the  project  road  and  the  rural  access  roads  through  proper \ntechnical supervision and adequate allocation of funds. The completed project \nroads will be maintained to a standard consistent with the standard adopted for \nthe Government\u2019s national road network under the RMF.  \n \n(iii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  project  design  includes  road  safety \nmeasures during the construction period and operation period following project \ncompletion. The Government will ensure that MCTPC implements the agreed \nRoad Safety Action Plan. \n \n(iv)  The Government will ensure that checkpoints along the Project\u2019s national roads \nto control the overloading of vehicles will be fully operational by the time civil \nworks have been completed. The Government will maintain a database on the \nstatus of load enforcement measures and incidence of vehicle overloading for a \nminimum of 3 years following project completion.  \n \n(v)  Within 6 months of ADB grant effectiveness, MCTPC will create a project website \nto disclose information about various matters on the Project. The website will \ninclude  information  on  project  procurement  including  the  list  of  participating \nbidders,  name  of  the  winning  bidder,  basic  details  on  bidding  procedures \nadopted, amount of contract awarded, and the list of goods/services procured. \n \n(vi)  Within 6 months of ADB grant effectiveness, MCTPC will prepare a grievance \nredress mechanism, acceptable to ADB, and establish a task force at DOR to \nreceive and resolve complaints/grievances or act upon reports from stakeholders \non  misuse  of  funds  and  other  irregularities,  including  grievances  caused  by \nresettlement and environmental issues. The task force will (i) make public the \nexistence  of  this  grievance  redress  mechanism  through  a  public  awareness \ncampaign; (ii) review and address grievances of stakeholders in relation to the \nProject, any of the service providers, or any person responsible for carrying out \nany aspect of the Project; and (iii) proactively and constructively respond to them.  \n \n(vii)  The Government and MCTPC will ensure that any involuntary resettlement will \nbe carried out in accordance with the agreed RP and the RF for the rural roads, ", "  19   \nADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), and the Government\u2019s laws and \nregulations  on  involuntary  resettlement.  In  case  of  differences  between  the \nGovernment\u2019s laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy, \nADB\u2019s policy will prevail. Based on the resettlement framework, an RP will be \nprepared  for  each  of  the  proposed  rural  roads  involving  land  acquisition  or \nresettlement  and  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval  prior  to \ncommencement of any civil works for the specific section of the rural roads that \ninvolves  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement.  Land  acquisition  and \nreallocation of affected households will not commence until an updated RP has \nbeen reviewed and approved by ADB. The Government will ensure that voluntary \ndonation of land for the Project will follow the agreed criteria, as set out in the \nRP. The Government and MTCPC will ensure that civil works contractors will not \nbe issued notices to commence for any part of a section of a road involving land \nacquisition  and  resettlement,  unless  the  Government  has  (a)  satisfactorily \ncompleted, in accordance with the approved RP, compensation payment and \nrelocation to new sites; (b) ensured that rehabilitation assistance is in place; and \n(c) ensured that the area required for civil works is free of all encumbrances.  \n \n(viii)  The Project will be implemented in accordance with the applicable laws and \nregulations of the Government and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  specific  measures  on  indigenous  peoples \nstipulated  in  the  RP,  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy,  and \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking program are carried out. \n \n(ix)  The Government and MCTPC will ensure that all civil works contractors engaged \nunder the Project (i) provide for equal pay to men and women for equal work and \nmake prompt payment of wages; (ii) provide safe working conditions and water \nand sanitation facilities for male and female workers; (iii) do not violate any \nprohibitions against child labor under the Government\u2019s laws and international \ntreaty obligations; and (iv) require the contractor to include information on the risk \nof transmission of STIs, including HIV/AIDS, in health and safety programs for all \nconstruction  workers  employed  under  the  Project.  Specific  provisions  to  this \neffect  will  be  included  in  bidding  documents  and  civil  works  contracts,  and \ncompliance will be monitored by MCTPC. \n \n(x)  The Government will implement and monitor the agreed HIV/AIDS and human \ntrafficking program in the construction camps, towns, and rural areas of the \nproject area. Training will be provided to strengthen the institutional capacity of \nthe Environment and Social Division of DOR and other agencies involved in \nplanning and implementation of the program. \n \n(xi)  The Government and MCTPC will ensure that the gender development measures \nprovided in the summary poverty reduction and social strategy are undertaken to \npromote the participation of women in project activities. The Government and \nMCTPC  will  further  ensure  that  district  resettlement  committees  established \naccording to the RP will include female representatives from the district Women\u2019s \nUnion, the village Women\u2019s Union, severely affected households, households \nheaded  by  women,  and  indigenous  peoples  households.  Capacity  building \ntraining programs on resettlement activities will be provided to district and village \nresettlement committee members, including female representatives listed above.  \n \n ", "20    \n(xii)  The construction, operation, and implementation of the project facilities will be \ncarried out in accordance with the IEE, including the EMP the environmental \nassessment and review procedures agreed between the Government and ADB, \nand will comply with the Government\u2019s environmental laws and regulations and \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002).  If  there  is  any  discrepancy  between  the \nGovernment\u2019s laws and regulations, and ADB\u2019s environment policy, ADB\u2019s policy \nwill  prevail.  The  Government  and  MCTPC  will  implement  the  environmental \nmitigation and management measures, and other recommendations specified in \nIEE\u2019s  EMP  to  minimize  any  adverse  environmental  impacts  arising  from  the \nconstruction, operation, and implementation of project facilities. The Government \nand MCTPC will ensure that the construction contractors develop a site-specific \nenvironmental management action plan based on the EMP. The Government will \nensure that the portions of the Project that are to be funded by other financiers \nwill adopt the provisions of the IEE and EMP. \n \n(xiii)  MCTPC will conduct an environmental assessment of the rural access roads \nproposed to be financed under the Project. The environmental assessment will \nbe based on the environmental assessment and review framework prepared for \nthe Project and included in the IEE.

Subsector Performance \n1.  Transport Planning and Coordination \n1.  The  Ministry  of  Communications,  Transport,  Posts,  and  Construction  (MCTPC)  is \nresponsible  for  the  development  of  national  and  provincial  roads,  civil  aviation,  urban \ndevelopment, telecommunications, river wharves, and river and road transport. Based on the five-\nyear development plans, the provinces prepare and submit annual implementation plans for \ntransport  projects  to  MCTPC,  which  submits  them  to  the  Committee  for  Planning  and \nCooperation of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office for approval. \n \n2.  The Department of Roads (DOR) within MCTPC is responsible for the administration, \nplanning, construction, and maintenance of national roads. DOR monitors maintenance programs \nfor national roads, and assists the provinces with the implementation and monitoring of road \nimprovement and maintenance programs of the local road network. Responsibility for execution \nof all routine and periodic maintenance has been delegated to the provincial Departments of \nCommunications, Transport, Posts, and Construction (DCTPCs), which also cover district and \ncommunity/access roads. DCTPCs form the provincial arms of MCTPC and are responsible both \nto the central government through MCTPC and to the provincial administrations. DCTPC staff are \nappointed  partly  by  MCTPC  and  partly  by  the  provinces.  Within  the  road  subsector,  the \nresponsibilities of DCTPCs include the implementation of maintenance of national roads within \neach province; and full responsibility for construction, improvement, and maintenance of the local \nroad network (provincial, district, and community roads). There are an average of 75 DCTPC staff \nin each province. \n \n3.  There  are  168  permanent  staff  assigned  to  DOR\u201432  women  and  47  assigned  to \nexternally financed projects. Of the eight divisions (including local roads) within DOR, the Road \nAdministration Division is the main division dealing with road maintenance, and has responsibility \nfor the certification of payments for disbursement from the Road Maintenance Fund for national \nroad  maintenance.  There  are  16  permanent  staff  in  the  Road  Administration  Division.  The \nPlanning and Technical Division has 16 staff and the Project Monitoring Division has 17 staff. \nAlthough staff numbers may vary between the divisions according to workload, the total number \nof divisions in DOR is not expected to change.  \n \n2.  Road Network \n4.  Transport in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is almost exclusively road-\nbased. Roads carry about 70% of freight and 90% of passenger traffic, so they are a key element \nof the basic infrastructure that makes up the enabling environment to support regional and \ninternational trade. The Mekong River and its tributaries provide river transportation (28% of \nfreight traffic). However, only 1,300 kilometers (km) of the river, which flows about 1,900 km \nthrough the country, are navigable owing to rapids and falls as well as low water levels during the \ndry season. Although the value of airfreight is negligible, domestic air transport plays a crucial \nrole in establishing links between important urban areas and otherwise inaccessible parts of the \ncountry. There are two international airports at Vientiane and Louangphrabang, with provincial \nairports for scheduled services at Pakse, Xiangkhouang, Louang-Namtha, Houayxay, Oudomxay, \nSamNua, and Phongsali, as well as other small airports and airfields throughout the country.  \n \n 5.  The public road network in Lao PDR is divided into several different classes of roads: \n(i) national, (ii) provincial, (iii) district, (iv) urban, (v) community (rural), and (vi) special. Formal \ndefinitions of each class are given in the Road Law (03/NA/99), 1999. Definitions of national and \nprovincial roads are given in Ministerial Decision 1312, issued in 1997, which formalized the list of \nnational roads.1 \n                                                 \n1  A draft decree is being processed by MCTPC to formalize the classified national roads under the Road Law. \n ", "  Appendix 2  25 \n \n6.  The country had a road network of about 34,000 km in 2004, comprising national roads \n(21%), provincial roads (26%), urban roads (5%), and district/community roads (48%). Some 14% \nof the total road network is paved; the rest have gravel or earth surfaces. The rehabilitation of \nsome roads included in the official national road network is still in the planning stage and many of \nthe local roads are mere tracks. The spine of the road system (route 13) runs from the border \nwith  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  via  Pak  Mong  in  the  north  to  the  border  with \nCambodia (Verne Kham) in the south. The critical east west links connecting Thailand and \nwestern Lao to the border with Viet Nam in the east are routes 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 15, and 18. The \nrehabilitation and improvement of these roads forming the core arterial network have been \ncompleted; route 3 (linking Thailand via Lao PDR with the PRC) will be completed by 2008.  \n  \n7.  Despite the many positive advances achieved in the national network, Lao PDR continues \nto lag behind its neighbors in road infrastructure with an estimated national road network of very \nlow density\u2014about 0.03 km/km2. Road contact between Vientiane and the provincial capitals is \nimproving, but two of the 17 provincial capitals remain without sealed all-weather links. About half \nof the national road system is unpaved and much of the local network is impassable during the \nwet season. All-weather access has been/is being provided to 14 of the Government-designated \n47 poorest districts under Asian Development Bank (ADB)-financed projects\u2014including Xieng \nKhouang Road Improvement;2 Rural Access Roads;3 East-West Corridor;4 Northern Economic \nCorridor;5 and Roads for Rural Development.6 Access to the districts that do not have year-round \nroad access or are inaccessible by road at any time is being addressed by MCTPC under an \nongoing plan as part of the National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy. Although it is \nessential to pay continued attention to national roads, much greater attention needs to be paid to \nthe local road network as the national network begins to coalesce. Without access to the main \nroad and transport system, the benefits derived from cross-regional and national links may be \nlimited, the potential contribution of the rural sector to sustained growth and national development \nwill not be realized fully, and the poverty of the rural population will not be reduced fully.  \n  \n8.  The Integrated Rural Accessibility Planning (IRAP) project has assisted in planning district \nand  local  road  development.  It  was  funded  by  the  Swedish  International  Development \nCooperation Agency (Sida), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and International \nLabour Organization (ILO); and its work has been incorporated in DOR\u2019s Local Roads Division. \nThrough a participatory planning process, IRAP aims to improve the access of rural communities \nvia better siting of basic facilities and services for rural populations; and improving the mobility of \nrural people through convenient and low-cost roads, tracks, trails, footbridges, and waterways. \nIRAP  recognizes  that  improving  the  rural  road  network  will  have  a  positive  effect  on  the \naccessibility  of  the  rural  poor  to  high  schools,  dispensaries,  pharmacies  and  hospitals, \ninformation and technology, markets and shops, government services, and employment centers. \nMaintenance is a key theme in the process, and a labor-based, equipment-supported routine \nmaintenance approach is recommended. IRAP was used as the basis of feeder road selection \nunder the Rural Community Access Component of the East-West Corridor Project (footnote 4), \nand  the  Community  Infrastructure  Component  of  the  Northern  Economic  Corridor  Project \n(footnote 5).   \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1997.

The  registered  motor  vehicle  fleet,  including  government  vehicles,  comprised \n568,290 units in 2005 (461,599 motorcycles; 88,362 cars, pickups and jeeps; and 18,329 trucks \nand buses). The general annual growth rate is about 4%, with the highest growth in motorcycles \n(12.5% per annum over last 5 years). There is a generally low level of traffic on national and \nprovincial  roads  throughout  Lao  PDR.  With  the  exception  of  areas  around  Vientiane  and \nSavannakhet, traffic levels on the national network are below 1,000 average annual daily traffic \n(AADT), and below 500 AADT on most sections. On provincial roads, traffic levels are typically \nbelow 100 AADT. The vehicle fleet for 1985\u20132005 and current road densities are shown in \nTable A2.5.   \n \n4.  Road Sector Revenues and Expenditures \n10.  Road expenditures are financed from general budgetary allocations, foreign loans and \ngrants with maintenance funded through the Road Maintenance Fund (RMF).7 Road sector \nrevenues consist of sales and import duties on vehicles, spare parts, tires, and automotive fuel \nproducts, as well as annual vehicle license fees, vehicle registration and inspection fees, and \ndriving license fees. In addition, revenue to the RMF is generated from a fuel levy, heavy vehicle \nsurcharge, tolls, international transit fees, overloading fines, and other road user charges.  \n \n11.  Annual road sector expenditures have been generally stable in recent years in current kip \nterms,  both  for  construction  and  maintenance.

The revenues from annual vehicle-related taxes are distorted. Although various tax rates \nare applied\u2014depending on vehicle type, engine size, gross weight of vehicle, and number of \nseats\u2014a large proportion of the total of 568,290 vehicles in 2005 comprised government-owned \nvehicles that were exempt. Other annual charges also exist, such as temporary registration \ncharges  for  foreign-registered  vehicles  in  the  country,  first-time  registration  charges, \nmiscellaneous charges for changing the color of the vehicle and loss of registration documents, \nand one-time fees for issuing drivers\u2019 licenses. All these fees are minor sources of revenue. \n \n5.  Maintenance \n14.  The objectives for road maintenance planning and institutional structures are founded in \nthe recognition that funding allocation and service provision are separate functions with distinctly \nseparate objectives. The objective for maintenance planning is to maximize the effectiveness of \nmaintenance expenditure by determining the level of service and maintenance strategies that \noptimize the benefits to the nation for the available level of funding. The objective for service \nprovision is to implement delivery mechanisms that achieve the greatest possible efficiency as \nmeasured by quality, performance specifications, and costs. \n \n15.  A  sustainable  maintenance  regime  includes  (i)  an  institutional  structure  that  takes \nresponsibility  for  funding,  planning,  and  implementing  maintenance,  while  separating  the \ninstitutions  responsible  for  funding  from  those  responsible  for  planning  and  management; \n(ii) consistent and adequate yearly funding to meet a level of service (road conditions) that \nminimizes total transport costs for the nation; (iii) maintenance planning (such as the Road \nManagement System implemented under the World Bank supported-Road Maintenance Project \n[RMP]) with the road inventory, periodically updated condition assessment, traffic volumes and \ncomposition, vehicle operating costs, unit costs of maintenance operations and regional cost \nvariations,  and  population  served;  and  (iv) well-designed  maintenance  management  and \nimplementation  delivered  through  competitive  bidding  procedures  with  proper  contract \ndocumentation and performance specifications, adequate supervision, audit and quality control, \nand capable and competitive contractors.  \n  \n16.  To meet these conditions, the Government established an RMF in 2001 as a way of \nproviding a sustainable funding base for the maintenance of the national road network (and \neventually all roads) from domestic sources. The RMF is based on the following principles: \n  ", "28  Appendix 2 \n(i)  Funding. Road user contributions will be allocated to the cost of maintaining the \nnational road network, with 10% of RMF revenues initially allocated to local roads \nand progressively contributing to the full cost of maintaining all roads.  \n(ii)  Independence. An RMF board under MCTPC, including the private sector, will \nsupervise, direct, and make recommendations on matters related to the overall \nmanagement and financing of road maintenance. \n(iii)  Revenues.  Revenues  to  be  derived  from  user  charges,  primarily  a  fuel  levy \n(gasoline and diesel fuel), heavy vehicle surcharges, tolls, and international transit \ncharges. The fuel levy will be adjusted annually, collected independently, and \ndeposited directly into the RMF. \n(iv)  Application. Priority will be routine maintenance.  \n(v)  Administration. The RMF will be a separate account operated and managed by \nthe RMF board and will not be part of the Government's general revenue. \n(vi)  Allocation.  The  allocation  for  network  maintenance  will  be  based  on  need, \nfunctional classification, and economic considerations. \n(vii)  Auditing and reporting. Accounts subject to annual audits will be carried out by \nan independent auditor in compliance with government regulations.  \n \n17.  The initial charge for the fuel levy was KN40/liter, with gradual government approved \nincreases with the current level (end of 2006) at KN200/liter; and the annual heavy vehicle \nsurcharge ranging from $25 for a gross vehicle weight of 2\u20134 tons to $55 for a gross vehicle \nweight of more than 7 tons for trucks, and $15 for a bus having 12\u201324 seats to $40 for a bus \nhaving more than 42 seats. In effect, the RMF treats roads in a manner similar to other utilities, \nsuch as telecommunications, electricity, and water supply. Road users pay an access charge \nthrough the annual license fee and then pay according to road use through a levy on fuel, tolls, \noverloading fines, etc. The level of road user charges is periodically reviewed by the national \nassembly.  \n \n18.  Among the major programs that have addressed road maintenance management are the \n(i) Highway Improvement Project Maintenance Study, 1993; (ii) Five-Year Maintenance Plan \n1996/97  to  2000/01,1997;  (iii)  Procedures  for  Developing  a  Rolling  Medium  Term  Plan, \nManagement Information System, 1997; (iv) MCTPC Proposed Routine Maintenance Programme \n1999/2000, 1999; (v) Lao-Swedish Road Project (LSRP-I) \u2013 Economic Evaluation of Periodic \nMaintenance Programme, 1999/2001; (vi) Lao-Swedish Road Sector Project 1997\u20132000, Report \non the Development of Road Maintenance Management Systems, 1999; (vii) Five-Year Road \nSector Improvement and Maintenance Plan, 2000\u20132005; (viii) MCTPC 10-Year Maintenance \nProgram;  and  (ix)  RMP,  (2001\u20132004)  and  RMP  2,  (2005\u20132009).  The  World  Bank  RMP \nrepresents a major step forward in developing sustainable mechanisms to manage and finance \nall  national,  provincial,  district,  and  rural  roads.  The  primary  objective  of  the  RMP  is  the \nsustainable preservation of road assets. To achieve that goal, the RMP is developing sustainable \nmechanisms to manage and finance the maintenance of all roads.   \n \n6.  Financial Management \n19.  The  Department  of  Planning  and  Cooperation  handles  the  accounting  and  financial \nmatters of MCTPC; all transactions pass through DOR, regardless of source. DOR is the largest \noffice in MCTPC\u2014it accounts for over 90% of MCTPC\u2019s budget and the majority of externally \nfunded  projects  in  MCTPC.  Financial  monitoring  and  accounting  of  projects  is  under  the \nDisbursement Division of DOR. Financial and accounting systems in MCTPC and the DCTPCs \nare being improved continually to provide functional and reliable budget expenditure reporting \nand  accountancy.  DOR  has  adopted  the  Financial  Management  System  developed  under \nLSRSP-I to meet the long-term objective of establishing a uniform financial and accounting \nsystem that includes all sources of funding and consolidates DPTPC accounting in MCTPC. The \nsystem\u2014covering fund disbursement and authorization, budgeting and reporting, and accounting \nand  auditing\u2014complies  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  government  and \nMCTPC  regulations  and  procedures.  The  World  Bank  has  also  accepted  the  system  for \n ", "  Appendix 2  29 \napplication in its projects. Recommended improvements in the system involve the following: (i) a \nuniform chart of accounts and account structure; (ii) accounting based on the double entry \nprinciple, and transactions recorded in journal and general ledger; (iii) all transactions recorded in \none program; (iv) organization and setting up of an accounting unit in the Disbursement Division \nof DOR with formal responsibility for all departmental accounting requirements; (v) coordination \nand consolidation of DCTPC budgets in MCTPC; (vi) externally funded road projects included in \nDOR and DCTPC accounting procedures; and (vii) MCTPC and each DCTPC to manage and \noperate its own bank accounts, impress accounts, and certify payments regarding externally \nfunded projects without approval by the Ministry of Finance. \n \n20.  The initiatives being taken by MCTPC are recognized as complementary to the support \nprovided through an ADB-financed technical assistance project,8 which assisted the Government \nin strengthening accounting systems at the Ministry of Finance and in some of the line ministries. \nThe complementarity of the systems lies in linking project accounting to government accounting \nfor  budgeting,  which  is  driven  by  budget  and  accounting  laws.  Full  compatibility  will  be \nestablished through uniform data management systems, and it is expected that the technical \nassistance  for  accounting  will  adopt  the  same  software  package  as  the  MCTPC  financial \nmanagement system.  \n \n7.  Axle Load Control \n21.  The maximum axle load set by MCTPC is 8.2 tons (Regulation 570/CTPC). In December \n1999, the Government signed the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Transit \nTraffic Agreement, in which maximum gross vehicle weights were set at about 9.1 ton axle load \nequivalent, with optional lower limits to be declared officially (e.g., during the wet season). Under \nthe  World  Bank-funded  RMP  and  RMP2,  MCTPC  is  implementing  a  Heavy  Transport \nManagement Program, whose main activities comprise review of existing regulations, enforcing \nregulations, providing equipment (weigh scales), setting up 41 weigh stations, and training and \nsupporting a public information campaign. The program is complemented by earlier and ongoing \nADB project components (East-West Corridor Project [footnote 4], Northern Economic Corridor \nProject [footnote 5], and Roads for Rural Development Project [footnote 6]) for the supply of \nequipment and establishing weigh stations. \n \n8.  Road Safety \n22.  Road accident fatalities continue to rise, with a 14% increase from 1999 to 2005. Road \naccidents increased by 35% in the same period. With the current increase in vehicles, a growing \npopulation, and improved road network, the potential for even greater accident rates is high. The \nrate of fatalities in 2005 was 10 persons per 10,000 vehicles (414 fatalities), which dropped from \n19 persons per 10,000 vehicles in 1999 (362 fatalities). The rapid increase in the number of \nmotorcycles has increased the number of fatalities. The current target of the Department of \nTransport is to reduce the rate of fatalities to 8 persons per 10,000 vehicles by 2010 and 5 \npersons per 10,000 vehicles by 2015. A National Road Safety Strategy and Action Plan is being \nimplemented and is built around five elements: education, enforcement, technical environment, \ncoordination, and research and evaluation. The key issues in the strategy relate to (i) improved \ndriving skills; (ii) use of crash helmets for motorcycle drivers; (iii) improved nighttime visibility for \nmotorcyclists  and  cyclists;  (iv)  reduced  drunk  driving;  (v)  reduced  speeding;  (vi)  traffic \nmanagement, signing, and delineation of roads; and (vii) use of seat belts. The national Road \nSafety  Strategy  and  Action  Plan,  which  received  prime  ministerial  approval  in  April  2005, \nenvisages implementation through a National Road Safety Council currently being established \nunder  MCTPC  and  the  forging  of  a  Road  Safety  Partnership  among  the  Traffic  Police \nDepartment,  Department  of  Transport,  and  Department  of  Education.  International \nnongovernment organizations (such as Handicap International) are supporting efforts to create a \nnetwork to increase awareness of road safety issues and address the trauma of road accidents. \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 1999.

Government Objectives and Priorities for the Road Subsector \n23.  The Government has given high priority to improvement of the road transport system, \nprincipally to facilitate (i) movement of agricultural products from surplus to deficit areas, (ii) flow \nof consumer goods and agricultural inputs to rural areas, (iii) marketing and export of cash crops \nand other produce, and (iv) effective participation in regional and international trade. The targets \nfor physical infrastructure development include (i) completing the national road network, including \nroad links with Cambodia, PRC, and Viet Nam, as well as road and bridge links with Thailand; \n(ii) improving the provincial road network; (iii) upgrading transit routes to central Viet Nam to \nfacilitate  Lao  PDR\u2019s  international  trade  through  ports  in  Viet  Nam;  and  (iv)  establishing  a \nsustainable maintenance system to preserve the country\u2019s transport infrastructure. Infrastructure \ndevelopment, particularly roads, is being coordinated closely with regional cooperation initiatives \nbeing developed under the ADB Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) initiative, as the country is \ncentrally located among Cambodia, PRC, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam.  \n \nTable A2.5: Road Network and Vehicles Data \n \nRoad Densities, 2004 \nRoad Length (km)  Area  Population  km

Procurement and Recruitment Procedures \n1.  Civil Works \n1.  For  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  contracts  administered  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), the procurement method to be used will be the single stage, one \nenvelope  system,  with  prequalification.  For  this  purpose,  the  Ministry  of  Communications, \nTransport, Posts, and Construction (MCTPC) will submit the invitation for prequalification and all \nrelated documents (including the proposed prequalification factors, methodology, and criteria) \nfor review and approval by ADB before they are issued. The prequalification invitation is to be \nadvertised  in  accordance  with  paras.  2.7\u20132.10  of  the  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). MCTPC will provide ADB with a report on the advertising as part of \n ", "38   Appendix 6 \nthe review requirements. After the prequalification applications have been evaluated, ADB\u2019s \napproval  of  the  evaluation  results,  including  the  recommendation  for  prequalified  and \ndisqualified applicants, must be obtained before they are communicated to the applicants. For \neach ICB contract, a full set of bid documents should be submitted to ADB for review and \napproval before issuance to prequalified bidders.  \n  \n2.  For national competitive bidding (NCB) contracts, documents will be modeled on those \ndeveloped for NCB under previous ADB-funded projects and updated to conform with the latest \nProcurement Guidelines. The single stage, two envelope model with post-qualification will be \nused.  The  first  draft  English  language  version  of  the  procurement  documents  should  be \nsubmitted  for  ADB  review  and  approval  regardless  of  the  estimated  contract  amount;  for \nsubsequent contracts, ADB will review the documents post-award. ADB-approved procurement \ndocuments should be used as a model for all succeeding NCB contracts partly or wholly \nfinanced by ADB for the Project.  \n \n3.  For  all  ADB-administered  contracts,  ADB  will  review  the  bid  evaluation  report  and \nproposal for award of contract on a prior review basis. The Executing Agency (EA) must submit \ncopies of the bid evaluation report in English to ADB for approval. Contracts funded by the \nRepublic of Korea will be procured using Republic of Korea procurement procedures. \n \n2.  Recruitment of Consultants  \n4.  For ADB-administered contracts, the Borrower will use quality and cost-based selection \n(QCBS), ADB\u2019s preferred method. Full technical proposals will be requested from short-listed \nfirms. The EA is required to submit its short-listing documents in ADB\u2019s standard format for \nADB\u2019s approval. Apart from making sure the short-list is composed of qualified firms that are \nreasonably geographically spread, ADB will review the following documents: \n \n(i)  Terms of reference and background information; \n(ii)  Request for proposal, including the EA\u2019s budget for the assignment, selection \nmethod, and type of technical proposals; \n(iii)  Criteria for evaluating the technical proposals; \n(iv)  Draft contract; and \n(v)  Consultant recruitment activities monitoring (CRAM) frame. \n \n5.  The  process  of  selecting  consultants  will  follow  ADB  guidelines  for  approvals  of \ntechnical, financial, and overall ranking of consultants as well as the draft contract. For Republic \nof Korea-financed contracts, recruitment will follow Republic of Korea procedures. \n \n3.  Monitoring the Consultant Recruitment Process \n6.  MCTPC  and  ADB  will  use  CRAM  frames  to  monitor  the  activities  in  recruiting  the \nconsultant and to avoid delays. Indicative CRAM frames based on forecasted scheduling of \nrecruitment for consulting packages have been provided to MCTPC. ADB will send a copy of the \nCRAM frame for the assignment to MCTPC. MCTPC\u2019s Consultant Selection Committee (CSC) \nshort-listing meeting will discuss and confirm the CRAM schedule. When MCTPC submits its \nCSC meeting documents to ADB for approval, the CRAM frame will be included. When ADB \napproves the EA\u2019s technical evaluation and financial evaluation/overall ranking, ADB will send \nthe EA an updated CRAM frame. The responsible MCTPC staff will monitor the recruitment \nprocess and reports to the ADB project officer the date when each activity is completed and the \nreason for any delays.   \n ", "                    Appendix 7  39\nTRAFFIC FORECAST \n \nA.  Existing Traffic \n1.  Seasonally adjusted base year traffic counts were conducted by the consultants during \nthe  project  preparatory  technical  assistance,  and  used  in  the  traffic  forecast  analysis  and \neconomic assessments for each section of the project road. Average traffic volume on the \nproject road varies significantly, with present levels ranging from a high of about 2,250 vehicles \nper day near the provincial capital of Xaignabouri to a low of about 130 vehicles per day on a \nremote part of the northern section and on the southernmost section, where the road ends.  \n  \nB.  Traffic Forecast \n \n2.  Forecasts by traffic and vehicle type were prepared for the project road sections for \n2007\u20132032. The forecasts are based on expected growth in gross domestic product (GDP) in \nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and international trade in the region, and on \nincome elasticities of demand. The traffic forecast for representative sections of the project road \nis summarized in Table A7.1. Total traffic is forecast to grow at annual rates of about 15.4\u2013\n16.7% during 2007\u20132017 (the years during and immediately following project implementation), \nexcept for the section including the bridge, which has higher growth. These high growth rates \nare due in large part to the development of generated traffic following project completion. \nInternational traffic, in particular, is expected to grow at a high rate during this period as the \nimproved road allows for trucks and other vehicles to travel throughout the year. Total traffic is \nforecast to grow at annual rates of about 6.8\u20138.6% during 2017\u20132032. The projected growth \nrates are considered reasonable, considering expected economic growth in the project area and \nexperience on other road projects financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Two recent \nevaluations of ADB-financed road improvement projects in Lao PDR found that actual traffic \nlevels have exceeded forecast levels by large margins. The project completion report for the \nXieng Khouang Road Improvement Project concluded that actual annual growth rates for traffic \nranged from 25% to 36% from 1997 to 2005 compared to annual growth rates of 6\u20139% forecast \nat  appraisal. 1  The  project  performance  evaluation  report  for  the  Champasack  Road \nImprovement Project 2 found that actual average daily traffic 5 years after project completion \nwas three times higher than forecast at appraisal.   \n  \n3.  Generated traffic arises from increased shipments of agricultural commodities and other \ngoods and increased bus traffic carrying tourists between Thailand and Louangphrabang. The \nimproved road conditions will also generate demand through lower fares arising from lower \nvehicle operating costs. Normal traffic is expected to account for 40\u201360% of total traffic on the \nproject road. Generated traffic comprises 35\u201343% of total traffic. Diverted traffic results from \ntraffic shifting to the project road from other roads, particularly Route 13 from Vientiane to \nnorthern Lao PDR, which passes through mountainous terrain and has steep slopes and sharp \ncurves. Diverted traffic comprises a relatively small portion of total traffic at 5\u201320%. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2006.

Motorcycles and small trucks (with fewer than three axles) comprise the largest portions \nof traffic on the project road. Traffic by vehicle type on representative locations of the project \nroad is shown in Table A7.2. The prevalence of motorcycles reflects the economic status of \npeople in the project area. Incomes have increased to the point at which motorcycles are \nreplacing nonmotorized vehicles, but not to the point at which households can afford cars or \nother two-axle vehicles. Trucks are more prevalent on section 4 and the southern part of section \n1. In 2017, trucks of all sizes are projected to comprise about 40% of total vehicles on section 4, \nwhich includes the Lao PDR-Thailand border crossing at Kenthao. The large proportion of \ntrucks on this section is due to their use in transporting agricultural and other exports from the \nproject area to Thailand. The prevalence of trucks in the southern part of section 1 is due largely \nto the low level of population in this area and the associated low levels of motorcycles and \nnonmotorized vehicles.  \n \nTable A7.2: Actual and Projected Traffic Volume by Vehicle Type  \n(vehicles per day) \n \nYear Nonmotorized Motorcycles Motorized  Cars  Buses Small Medium Summary\nVehicles Tricycles and and  Trucks and Large\nSmall Tractors Jeeps Trucks\nSection 1 Xiengngeun to M.

General \n1.  The economic analysis was carried out for the Project by comparing the with- and \nwithout-project scenarios. In the without-project scenario, the road is assumed to remain in its \npresent  condition.  The  with-project  scenario  includes  routine  and  periodic  maintenance \naccording to international standards. The project preparatory technical assistance considered \nvarious  mutually  exclusive  project  alternatives,  such  as  different  pavement  types  and \nalignments, and the proposed Project is based on the most cost-effective and least-cost option. \nThe economic analysis covers 25 years (2008\u20132032), based on a 6-year implementation period \nwith most work being completed during the first 5 years. All benefits and costs are in constant \n2007 prices. The economic prices are expressed using the world price numeraire. \n \nB.  Costs \n2.  Project  economic  costs  include  the  resource  costs  of  road  improvement  and \nmaintenance,  equipment,  and  consulting  services.  Price  contingencies,  interest  during \nconstruction, and taxes and duties are excluded. Costs were divided into tradable and non-\ntradable portions. A standard conversion factor of 0.9 was applied to the non-tradable portion. \nTo take into account local unemployment and underemployment, costs for unskilled labor were \nadjusted by a shadow wage rate factor of 0.9 to arrive at the economic opportunity cost. \n \nC.  Benefits \n3.  The primary economic benefits for the Project are vehicle operating cost (VOC) savings \nfrom normal, generated, and diverted traffic; time savings; savings from improved road safety; \nand savings from reduced maintenance costs. Economic benefits were calculated using the \nsame methodology used for costs. VOC savings will accrue primarily from improvements in the \nroad surface, and horizontal and vertical alignment. Unit economic VOCs for nine types of \nvehicles were estimated using the Highway Design and Maintenance Standards Model-IV, and \nrepresentative VOCs are shown in Table A8.1. VOC savings for normal traffic account for about \n39% of total benefits while benefits from generated traffic account for about 22%. Generated \ntraffic is defined as new traffic induced from the reduction in transport costs arising from the \nProject, and includes both international and domestic generated traffic. Benefits for generated \ntraffic are estimated at half the value of VOC savings for normal traffic. Benefits from diverted \ntraffic arise from the diversion of traffic from other roads in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \n(Lao PDR), particularly Route 13 from Vientiane to northern Lao PDR. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "                    Appendix 8  43\n \nTable A8.1: Representative Vehicle Operating Costs by Vehicle Type \n($ per vehicle-km)  \n \n  Item  Without Projecta  With Projectb  VOC Savings \n  Rolling Terrain       \n  Car  0.195  0.170  0.025 \n  Bus Medium  0.270  0.211  0.059 \n  Bus Heavy  0.381  0.299  0.082 \n  Truck Light  0.197  0.169  0.027 \n  Truck Medium  0.458  0.339  0.119 \n  Truck Heavy  0.764  0.568  0.196 \nkm = kilometer, VOC = vehicle operating cost. \na Corresponding to an international roughness index of 10. \nb Corresponding to an international roughness index of 2. \nSource: Technical assistance consultants estimates. \n \n4.  Time  savings  account  for  about  19.5%  of  total  benefits,  and  include  savings  in \npassenger and freight time. The Project will result in improved average speeds along the project \nroad, e.g., from 56.1 kilometers per hour (km/hour) to 82.8 km/hour for a car. The travel time for \nthe entire length of the project road will be reduced from about 8.0 hours to 5.0 hours. The value \nof time saved by passengers traveling during work time was calculated at $0.28 per hour, based \non an estimate of passengers\u2019 average annual income. This value was also used for people \ntraveling during leisure time since no data on people\u2019s willingness to pay for travel time savings \nin Lao PDR was available. The value of time saved for freight is assumed at $1.58/vehicle-hour \nfor light trucks, $7.09/vehicle-hour for medium trucks, $9.45/vehicle-hour for heavy trucks, and \n$0.24/vehicle-hour for motorcycles and motorized tricylces. Benefits from improved road safety \nand reduced maintenance costs comprise smaller portions of total benefits. Savings in road \nmaintenance  costs  are  based  on  the  routine  maintenance  necessary  to  maintain  an \ninternational roughness index of 10, including grading of the current earth surface of the road. \nSavings from improved road safety arise from the reduced number of accidents per vehicle-\nkilometer on the improved road, and in the severity of accidents. The cost per accident was \nestimated at $1,165, based on government statistics. The Project will also have other benefits, \nsuch as improved access to social services, but these have not been quantified because of the \nlack of sufficient data. \n \nD.  Results of Economic Analysis \n5.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated for the Project. The EIRR for \nthe Project is 16.6%, and the net present value is $22.3 million, using a 12% discount rate \n(Table A8.2). The EIRRs for the individual sections of the project road are above 12%. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "44  Appendix 8 \nTable A8.2: Economic Internal Rate of Return  \n($ million) \n \nCapital Maintenance Total Normal Generated Time Diverted Road Maintenance Total Net\nYear Costs Costs Costs Traffic Traffic Savings Traffic Safety Savings BenefitsBenefits\n2008 6.991 6.991 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 (6.991)\n2009 10.486 10.486 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 (10.486)\n2010 13.982 13.982 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 (13.982)\n2011 17.477 17.477 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 (17.477)\n2012 13.982 13.982 3.551 1.876 1.723 0.629 0.007 0.000 7.786 (6.195)\n2013 6.991 6.991 4.194 2.274 2.052 0.748 0.008 2.230 11.507 4.516\n2014 0.000 2.169 2.169 4.460 2.497 2.206 0.801 0.009 2.230 12.203 10.034\n2015 0.000 2.169 2.169 4.743 2.768 2.380 0.858 0.009 2.230 12.989 10.820\n2016 0.000 2.169 2.169 5.046 2.964 2.537 0.919 0.010 2.230 13.706 11.537\n2017 0.000 2.169 2.169 5.369 3.176 2.704 0.985 0.010 2.230 14.474 12.305\n2018 0.000 7.540 7.540 5.761 3.404 2.903 1.052 0.011 2.230 15.361 7.821\n2019 0.000 2.169 2.169 6.181 3.650 3.118 1.124 0.012 2.230 16.315 14.146\n2020 0.000 2.169 2.169 6.633 3.913 3.349 1.201 0.013 2.230 17.340 15.171\n2021 0.000 2.169 2.169 7.120 4.197 3.597 1.283 0.014 2.230 18.441 16.272\n2022 0.000 2.169 2.169 7.642 4.502 3.864 1.371 0.015 2.230 19.625 17.456\n2023 0.000 2.169 2.169 8.222 4.829 4.162 1.462 0.017 2.230 20.923 18.754\n2024 0.000 7.540 7.540 8.849 5.182 4.483 1.560 0.018 2.230 22.321 14.781\n2025 0.000 2.169 2.169 9.526 5.561 4.829 1.664 0.020 2.230 23.829 21.660\n2026 0.000 2.169 2.169 10.256 5.968 5.204 1.775 0.021 2.230 25.455 23.286\n2027 0.000 2.169 2.169 11.045 6.407 5.609 1.893 0.023 2.230 27.208 25.039\n2028 0.000 2.169 2.169 11.895 6.877 6.045 2.020 0.025 2.230 29.093 26.924\n2029 0.000 2.169 2.169 12.811 7.382 6.515 2.155 0.028 2.230 31.121 28.952\n2030 0.000 7.540 7.540 13.796 7.924 7.022 2.299 0.030 2.230 33.302 25.762\n2031 0.000 2.169 2.169 14.858 8.506 7.568 2.452 0.033 2.230 35.648 33.479\n2032 (31.459) 2.169 (29.290) 16.001 9.131 8.157 2.616 0.036 2.230 38.172 67.461\nEIRR = 16.61%\nNPV = 22.306 \n( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and technical assistance consultants estimates. \n \nE.  Sensitivity Analysis \n6.  Sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the effects of negative changes in the key \nparameters that determine the benefits and costs of the Project. The sensitivity analysis, shown \nin Table A8.3, indicates that capital costs would have to increase by 49% or total benefits \ndecrease by 32% for the EIRR to reach the level of 12%. Given the Asian Development Bank's \nexperience with similar projects in Lao PDR, such changes are not expected to occur. The \nsensitivity analysis shows that the EIRR exceeds the level of 12% in all cases. Even if there \nwere no generated traffic, the EIRR remains above 12%. In order to determine the degree of \nuncertainty of the Project, a risk analysis was carried out. Key variables, e.g., costs and traffic \ngrowth rates, were assigned a random value within defined limits based on assumed probability \ndistribution functions. A Latin Hypercube type random sampling was used, and the simulation \nrun was made with 500 iterations to generate the probability distribution of the EIRR. The results \nshow that the probability that the EIRR will fall below 12% is less than 4% and that the EIRR is \nthus robust. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "                    Appendix 8  45\n \nTable A8.3: Sensitivity Analysis \n \nItem  EIRR  ENPV  Switching Value \n  (%)  ($ million)  (%) \nBase case  16.6  22.306   \n1 year implementation delay  16.1  19.648   \nNormal traffic (20%)  15.4  16.198  73 \nGenerated traffic (20%)  15.9  18.786   \nTotal benefit (20%)  13.9  8.515  32 \nCapital costs +20%  14.4  13.249  49 \nNormal traffic (20%); capital costs +20%  13.3  7.141   \nMaintenance at 50%  15.8  16.700   \n( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, ENPV = economic net present value. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and technical assistance consultants estimates. \n \nF.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Project includes the improvement of about 370 kilometers (km) of the Route 4 \nnational highway from Xiang Ngeun to Nakha, construction of the Mekong River Bridge, and \nimprovement of approximately 100 km of access roads. A resettlement plan (RP) has been \nprepared for the whole length of Route 4 and the Mekong River. For the rural access roads, the \nMinistry  of  Communications,  Transport,  Posts,  and  Construction  (MCTPC)  has  identified \n15 potential rural access roads, but their prioritization and selection for project financing will only \nbe done during grant implementation. Therefore, a resettlement framework has been prepared \nto  guide  in  preparation  and  implementation  of  RPs  for  all  rural  access  roads  with  land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts.  \n \nB.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n  \n2.  The Road Law, 1999, sets the right-of-way for Route 4 at 25 meters (m) either side of \nthe centerline. For this Project, specifically sections 1\u20134, a carriageway width of 7.0 m plus \n1.0 m sealed shoulders is proposed for flat and rolling terrain while a carriageway width of 6.0 m \nplus 0.5 m shoulders is proposed for mountainous terrain. For resettlement planning purposes, \ni.e., to minimize, if not avoid, resettlement impacts, a corridor of impact of 12 m has been \nadopted wherever possible. In section 5, where the road will continue to be primarily for local \nuse, a corridor of impact of about 6 m was used. The project road passes through about 120 \nvillages.  However,  physical  displacement  from  assets  will  only  be required  in 36  of  these \nvillages. The RP identified 255 affected households (AHs), of which 232 are along the proposed \nproject road and 23 at the site of the bridge. Of the 232 AHs, 224 are households, while the rest \nare institutions (government bodies) or private organizations. The highest percentage loss of \nany of the 65 affected paddy lands represents just 7.5% of the AHs\u2019 total agricultural land \nholdings. Minimal impact on AH production and income is expected. Other affected properties \nare residential, fishpond, and some village land (nonproductive barren plot). \n \n3.  As to affected main structures (excluding houses where the porch or awning is the only \naffected part of the structure), there are 65 dwelling units (58 are used purely for residence and \n7 are house-cum-shops) and 33 shops. Of these, 31 of the houses used solely for residence \nand 3 of the house-cum-shops will be totally affected. However, only 6 of the totally affected \ndwelling units used solely for residence have to be relocated, either to other land owned by the \nAHs (3 AHs) or to village-allocated land (3 AHs). Of the 3 totally affected house-cum-shops, 1 \nwill be relocated on another plot of the AH; for the 2 others, the shops will be reorganized on the \nunaffected portion of the AHs\u2019 land while the houses will be relocated in other plots of the AHs. \nOf the 33 affected shops, 15 are totally affected. With one exception, the totally affected shops \nwill only have to move back on AHs\u2019 residual land. Other affected structures are 21 rice bins and \n7 small rice mills. Relocation of 171 electricity poles and restoration of 38.3 linear meters of \nbrick  and  wire  fences  will  also  be  required.  Additionally,  238  trees  of  commercial  value \nbelonging to 80 AHs will be acquired. For the Mekong River bridge, 23 households will be \naffected.  About  1.5 hectares  of  productive  and  residential  land,  of  which  teak  plantations \ncomprise 80%, will be acquired. Twelve households will be severely affected because of loss of \n10% or more of their productive land (paddy and teak plantation). Five of the nine relocating \nAHs will have to relocate to new plots. The remaining 4 AHs can rebuild their houses on their \nresidual land. \n  \n \n ", "                    Appendix 9  47\n \nC.  Legal and Policy Framework and Project Entitlements \n4.  The policy framework and entitlements are developed from the laws of the Government \nof the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), principally the Constitution, 1991; Land \nLaw, 2003; and Road Law, 1999; various decrees,1 and the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  guided  by  the  Operations  Manual  on  Involuntary \nResettlement (OM/F2, 2006). Provisions and principles adopted in the RP and resettlement \nframework will supplement the provisions of relevant decrees currently in force in Lao PDR \nwherever a gap exists. Key strategies to reconcile the differences are included in the RP. \n \n5.  Project entitlements (Table A9) were designed to cover compensation and allowances \nfor all losses. Voluntary donation will only be applied to very minor losses of residential land. \nVoluntary donation of small strips of residential land will be according to the following criteria: (i) \nthe total residential land area of the AH is not less than 300 square meters (m2); (ii) if the total \nresidential land area of the AH is more than 300 m2, the strip of land that can be donated cannot \nbe more than 5% of the total land area; and (iii) there are no houses, structures, or fixed assets \non the affected portion of land.   \n  \nTable A9: Project Entitlements \n \nType of Losses  Entitled  Entitlements \nPersons \nProductive land  Legal owner  For marginal loss of land, cash compensation at replacement \n(paddy, garden,  or occupant  cost\u2014equivalent to the current market value of land within the \nand teak  identified  village, of similar type, category, and productive capacity, and free \nplantation)  during IOL  from transaction costs (taxes, administration fees).

Households that are severely affected \nthrough the loss of 10% or more productive assets will be provided with replacement land or \nassisted in purchasing replacement land. AHs will also be provided with farm inputs to increase \nproductivity on remaining land and/or replacement land.

AHs will not be displaced until the province allocates land within the same or neighboring \nvillage. \n \nE.  Ethnicity and Gender Issues \n7.  Particular attention has been given to the specific needs and concerns of indigenous \npeoples and other vulnerable groups such as the landless; poor; and households headed by \nwomen, disabled, elderly, or children without means of support. Actions specific to indigenous \npeoples and a gender strategy are included in the RP: (i) active participation of women and \nethnic  minorities  from  consultation  to  monitoring,  (ii)  representation  of  women  and  ethnic \nminorities  in  resettlement  committees,  (iii)  capacity  building  targeting  women  and  ethnic \nminorities, (iv) a gender specialist to be engaged under the project supervision consultants, \n(v) monitoring indicators by gender and indigenous peoples will be developed for monitoring, \nand (vi) the independent monitor will include female staff. \n \nF.  Participation, Grievance Redress, and Disclosure \n8.  Consultations, public meetings, and village discussions with AHs and local officials were \ncarried  out  during  the  resettlement  planning  process.  These  activities  will  continue  during \nupdating  and  implementation,  and  will  follow  the  Project\u2019s  participatory  approach.  Prior  to \n ", "50  Appendix 9 \nappraisal,  posters  providing  information  about  the  Project  in  general,  project  schedule, \nentitlements  to  compensation  and  assistance  to  replace  losses,  and  where  to  go  to  get \nadditional information were placed in conspicuous and accessible areas such as village offices, \nshops, and village bulletin boards along the road. The draft RP was disclosed to all AHs through \na  public  information  booklet  in  the  Lao  language  from  11\u201313  June  2007.  The  grievance \nmechanism  has  been  designed  to  ensure  that  the  concerns  and  grievances  of  AHs  are \naddressed and resolved in a timely and satisfactory manner. AHs will be made fully aware of \ntheir rights verbally and in writing during consultation, survey, and at the time of compensation. \nThe Project Management Division (PMD), Environment and Social Department (ESD), and \nResettlement Committees will be responsible for the disclosure of the RPs to the AHs prior to \nsubmission to ADB. The draft RP has been uploaded onto ADB\u2019s resettlement website. The \nfinal RP and social monitoring reports on any resettlement will also be uploaded onto ADB\u2019s \nwebsite. \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements, Monitoring, and Resettlement Budget \n9.  ESD will provide overall guidance and technical support to the resettlement committees. \nBefore  commencement of any land acquisition activities (i.e., before RP preparation/updating), \nresettlement specialists (1 international and 1 national), national gender and indigenous peoples \nspecialists, and 3 community mobilizers under the project implementation consultants will be \nmobilized to assist in updating the RP and preparing RPs for the rural access roads. They will \nalso  assist  during  implementation  and  monitoring  of  the  approved  RPs.  An  independent \nmonitoring organization will also be engaged and mobilized before commencement of land \nacquisition activities.  \n \n10.  ESD will submit resettlement progress reports to ADB on a quarterly basis, including \nfinancial audit statements of government and grant funds for resettlement. The independent \nmonitoring organization will submit quarterly reports for the first year and semiannual reports for \na further year on the progress of implementation, including recommendations regarding the \nissues identified. The estimated cost of resettlement for Route 4 including the Mekong River \nbridge is $145,600. This includes compensation for land and non-land assets, allowances to \nAHs, development of replacement plots for relocating AHs, operational/administration expenses, \nexternal monitoring, and contingencies. The costs may change upon completion of the detailed \nmeasurement  survey.  The  Government  will  provide  counterpart  funds  for  land  acquisition. \nCompensation  for  non-land  assets,  allowances,  development  of  replacement  plots, \noperational/administration expenses, external monitoring, and contingencies will be financed \nunder  the  grant.  The  Government  will  ensure  timely  provision  of  counterpart  funds  for \nresettlement to meet any unforeseen obligations in excess of the resettlement budget estimates \nin order to satisfy resettlement requirements and objectives. Rental of contractors\u2019 working \nspace and bypass routes, payment for impacts on non-land assets, and land leveling/filling of \nreplacement land and restoration of the fishpond will be included in the bid documents. \n \nH.  Implementation Schedule \n11.  Preparation and updating of the RP will be done by contract package following detailed \ndesign,  including  contracts  financed  by  co-financiers.  All  resettlement  activities  will  be \ncoordinated with the civil works schedule. ADB will not approve construction activities in specific \nsites involving land acquisition and resettlement until all resettlement activities for those specific \nsites have been satisfactorily completed, agreed rehabilitation assistance is in place, and the \nsite is free of all encumbrances.  \n  \n ", "                    Appendix 10  51\n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic: \nIn the 2004 National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES), the Government\u2019s development goal is to exit \nthe country\u2019s status as a least developed country by 2020. The goals and strategies of the NGPES have been \nincorporated within the current Sixth Five Year Plan and Millennium Development goals. To meet the goals set for \n2020, rapid economic growth is being promoted to raise income levels. The Government has identified transport \ndevelopment as critical to achieving this development target. The NGPES has stated that the primary goal for \ntransport is to \u201cfully integrate the economy, thereby providing an enabling environment for trade and commerce and \naccess for all Lao People to basic services\u201d.a Poverty reduction is a key focus of the Government\u2019s current and long-\nterm (2020) development plan. Road access is considered one of the keys to eradicating poverty in the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR) as discussed in the NGPES.  \n \nThe incidence of poverty nationally has reportedly declined from 46% in 1992 to just over 30% in 2005. The Laos \nExpenditure and Consumption Survey 2003 shows that both of the project provinces\u2014Louangphrabang and \nXaignabouri\u2014have consumption and income levels above the national average. Provincial data indicates that \nLouangphrabang\u2019s poverty incidence declined from 58.5% in 1993 to 40.8% in 1998 to 26.1% in 2004. Tourism and \ndiversification and commercialization of agriculture have contributed to progress in poverty reduction in the project \ndistricts.   \n  \nBy improving national and local roads, the Project will provide an enabling condition for poverty reduction through \nimproved access to markets, employment, advanced education, and health facilities. Upgrading of an all-weather road \nwill enhance benefits, enabling lower transport costs, and economic diversion through increased tourism, \ncommercialization of agriculture, and development of other service industries in the project districts. Improved access \nto markets will open up opportunities for expansion of locally produced goods and services. Construction and \noperation of roads will provide significant opportunities for poor people to get employment and income from \nconstruction work. It is estimated that 8,130 person-months of work will be created during project implementation, of \nwhich 5,420 person-months will be unskilled.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General Intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe project area includes seven districts with a population of 311,000. Agriculture is the main source of employment in \nthe project area. The project road passes through largely agricultural areas that are in transition from production for \nsubsistence consumption and for local markets to more export-oriented commercial agriculture (maize, sesame, \npeanuts, mulberry fiber) and teak plantation. In addition to agriculture, other economic activities include small furniture \nfactories, brick factories, saw mills, rice mills, noodle factories, drinking water factories, meat processing factories, ice \nfactories, cross-border trade, small-scale river sand and gravel extraction, etc. \n \nHealth data indicate that infant mortality has fallen because of a donor agency\u2019s village health program, which ended \nin 2005. Coverage of immunization has increased. There are district level hospitals in Xaignabouri and  \nLouangphrabang. Only a few villages have health centers and dispensaries. Access of the rural population to district \nhospitals is limited because of poor road conditions. Interviews with people in the project area indicate that respiratory \nhealth problems are common because of dusty road conditions. Pregnant women from rural communities face severe \nconstraints receiving health services during pregnancy. \n \nLao PDR has a relatively low incidence of HIV/AIDS (about 0.08%). The number of reported cases at the end of 2005 \nwas 1,827 with HIV and 432 with AIDS (60% male and 40% female). The most affected ages are between 20 and \n35 years old. Lao Red Cross had provided HIV/AIDS prevention education programs in each project district, supported \nby the World Health Organization and Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere (CARE). A provincial \nprogram that supports awareness of HIV/AIDS has been introduced in the project districts. Interviews with rural \ncommunities along the road indicate that relevant district staff have been visiting them every 3 months to discuss \nhealth issues.  \n \n ", "52  Appendix 10 \nGenerally, one primary school serves two or three villages. Secondary schools are limited to the district towns or \nmunicipalities. All schools in 120 villages along the road reported to be understaffed and without essential resources. \nInterviews indicate that students attending secondary schools and living in boarding houses in town cannot visit their \nparents during weekends because of poor road conditions and lack of adequate public transport. Road conditions \ndiscourage many parents from sending their children to the district secondary schools.     \n \nImpact of the Project. It is expected that the upgrading of Route 4 will provide a strategic all-weather link that will \nfacilitate improved access to goods, markets, schools, medical facilities, and other social services for the project \ndistricts. The ability of the public sector to provide these services in a more cost-effective way could be increased \nbecause of improved access to the project road. The improved road condition will reduce dust pollution, which would \nhave a positive health impact on people from 120 villages along the road. Road improvement will play an important \nrole in reducing hazardous conditions for children walking several kilometers to school through very dusty roads. \nIncreased access to transport in the project districts would increase enrollment of children from rural areas in the \nsecondary schools in towns. Organization of local labor for the construction work for Route 4 and construction of the \naccess roads will provide a source of income for men and women laborers from poor households. Engagement of \nlocal labor for road maintenance by the local government will provide seasonal employment for poor communities. \n \nAlthough improved transport facilities will bring positive benefits, the improvement of roads and the border crossing \nare likely to have some negative socioeconomic impacts for people living along the road. Certain vulnerabilities could \nbe exacerbated by the increased accessibility, trade, and traffic. The ensuing economic development has the potential \nto increase inequalities within the communities by excluding some members from gaining these benefits because of \nlack of financial resources, skills, and knowledge. There will be some adverse impacts for people who are directly \naffected by resettlement. Potential socioeconomic impacts are (i) escalating land prices caused by the road \nimprovements, concentration of landownership in the vicinity of the border, and potential displacement of local \nresidents from the area; (ii) increased traffic risks for people living and working along the road caused by large \nvolumes of traffic and higher vehicle speeds along the improved road; (iii) increased risks of exposure to HIV/AIDS \nand trafficking of women and children during construction activities and because of large volumes of transit traffic \nalong the road and border area; (iv) increased flow of illegal drugs and number of drugs users in the project area as \nroad improvements provide more favorable routes for drug dealers; and (iv) increased number of road accidents \ncaused by increased traffic and vehicle speeds.  \n \nThe Project will include an HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention of human trafficking program in the construction \ncamps, towns, and rural areas of the project districts. The awareness and prevention program includes: (i) advocacy \nactions on HIV/AIDS/sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and human trafficking prevention; (ii) information and \neducation campaigns for all ethnic groups in respective sociocultural contexts; (iii) provision of HIV/AIDS and STI \nmedical packages to clinics and medical centers along the road; (iv) developing community level contact persons for \ncommunity mobilization on HIV/AIDS awareness, prevention of human trafficking, and community monitoring; (v) \nmobilization of existing poverty programs on agriculture and village development for poor households, with special \nfocus on targeting indigenous peoples\u2019 households to minimize their vulnerability and potential risk of human \ntrafficking; and (v) developing project performance monitoring indicators on HIV/AIDS/STIs and human trafficking \nprevention by gender and ethnicity.  \n \nThe Project will include monitoring of social benefits, potential negative impacts, and indirect benefits. Disaggregated \nmonitoring indicators by ethnic groups and gender will be used. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nVarious public consultation and participation activities have been carried out for the Project since mid-2006 and the \nrole of each stakeholder is identified. The Department of Roads (DOR), the project preparation technical assistance \nconsultants, and Asian Development Bank (ADB) missions have had formal and informal consultations with local \ncommunities and government agencies through meetings, household interviews, and workshops. In addition, \nhousehold interviews have been conducted in 120 villages along the alignment, manufacturing enterprises, and with \nvehicle passengers and drivers. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nDuring implementation of the resettlement plan and the HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention of human trafficking \nprogram, active participation of men, women, all ethnic groups, local leaders, poor households, and vulnerable groups \nwill be ensured. The participatory strategy includes consultation meetings and capacity development \nworkshops/training on resettlement-related activities, awareness raising activities and community mobilization on \nHIV/AIDS awareness and human trafficking prevention, and community monitoring. \n \n ", "                    Appendix 10  53\n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize positive impacts on women: \n \nSituation of Women in the Project Area. Women in the project area suffer from gender biases, particularly in rural \nareas and among ethnic minorities. Women and girls are disadvantaged in terms of access to education and other \nsocial services. In the project area, women\u2019s literacy is below that of men. Among the ethnic groups, women from \nHmong indigenous peoples have a significantly lower literacy rate (39%) than men (57%). Women have less access to \nhealth care services in the project area\u2014especially pregnant women who face constraints seeking health care from \ndistrict hospitals during pregnancy because of poor road conditions. In recent years, a village-based primary health \ncare program by nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and a bilateral agency has led to a reduction in child and \nmaternal mortality in Xaignabouri Province. Women in the project districts play a major role in both subsistence and \ncommercial agricultural activities. Despite the reduction of slash and burn agriculture, there is still widespread planting \nof dry rice and crops on slopes in the project area. Women carry a heavy burden in both subsistence and commercial \nagriculture. Women from indigenous peoples groups also play a critical role in collecting non-timber forest products. \nAgricultural extension services and other support mechanisms for many women from indigenous peoples are limited \nbecause they do not speak Lao. Men from indigenous peoples groups mainly have access to agricultural extension \nservices. Women are entitled to inherit land titles but these are often not registered in the name of the woman because \nof (i) lack of knowledge of ownership rights, (ii) cultural reluctance on the part of women, (iii) lower levels of female \nliteracy, or (iv) lack of awareness of the problem on the part of certifying officers. In the project districts, women play a \nleading role in retail trade, vending, guesthouses, and restaurants. Small and medium-sized enterprises are mostly \nowned by women, but poor infrastructure has been a problem for women\u2019s enterprise in terms of capital and access to \nmarkets.  \n \nAlthough Lao PDR has a relatively low incidence of HIV/AIDS, transmission of communicable diseases and HIV/AIDS \nmay increase in the project area because of the influx of construction workers and transit traffic, including cross-border \nmovements along the project road. Human trafficking is a serious issue in Lao PDR. A number of groups\u2014including \nLao Women\u2019s Union, Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare, NGOs and donor agencies\u2014are addressing trafficking \nissues, but data on the impact of the projects are sparse and more anecdotal than statistical. Construction and \noperation of the project road can increase the risk of human trafficking and HIV/AIDS/STIs for women and children. \nThe Project includes an HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention of human trafficking program. The Project will provide a \nstrategic all-weather link that will facilitate improved access to goods, markets, schools, medical facilities, and other \nsocial services by women. Interviews with women indicate that the improved road will provide them with access to \nlocal markets for agricultural products. The income and opportunities for women in roadside vending, food stalls, and \nsmall grocery stores will also be increased. There will be increased opportunities for women laborers in road \nconstruction work and road maintenance. The project districts have provisions for subcontracting local contractors for \nconstruction work, which would provide the opportunity to use local labor. The districts have a regular road \nmaintenance program that is targeted at men and women from poor households. The gender strategy is to help \nwomen from affected households to secure access to compensation resources under the resettlement plan, to \nminimize the potential risk of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking in the communities, and to provide women with income \nopportunities in road construction and maintenance. \n \n\u2022 The district resettlement committees will include representatives from the District Women\u2019s Union, women from \naffected households, and representatives from indigenous peoples groups.  \n\u2022 At the inception of the Project, a capacity building training program/workshop (as part of consultation) will be \ndesigned for district officials and people; and will include information on resettlement activities, compensation, and \ngrievance procedures. The participation of poor women will be ensured in the training, which will also include \nrepresentatives from the Executing Agency and line agencies responsible for resettlement; and representatives from \nthe provincial Women\u2019s Union, Youth Union, and District Women\u2019s Union involved in resettlement committees to \nincrease their understanding of implementing resettlement activities.   \n\u2022 The capacity building training/workshop (as part of consultation) on resettlement, compensation, and grievance \nprocedures issues will be conducted separately for indigenous peoples\u2019 groups; separate training/consultation will \nbe organized for women from indigenous peoples\u2019 households. \n\u2022 Compensation money/resource (in kind or cash) will be provided to both men and women from the affected \nhouseholds. It will be ensured that indigenous women and men receive fair compensation. Specific attention will be \ngiven to poor, vulnerable, and women-headed households in paying the compensation on time.   \n\u2022 The resettlement plan will encourage joint registration of land rights in the names of husband and wife in instances \nwhere land is acquired. \n \n \n \n ", "54  Appendix 10 \n\u2022 An HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention of human trafficking campaign, including capacity building, will be \nconducted during the construction and post-construction phase by the construction contractors, provincial and \ndistrict committees for the control of AIDS, and Lao Women\u2019s Union with the active involvement of communities, \nrelevant government agencies, and NGOs. The Women\u2019s Union, Youth Union, health workers, female community \nleaders and members, and women from affected households will be involved in monitoring the program at the local \nlevel. The educational materials, workshop, and campaign on the HIV/AIDS and human trafficking prevention \nprogram will be customized for indigenous peoples. \n\u2022 All employment for the Project will respect gender equality, including staffing in the project implementation unit and \nresettlement committees. \n\u2022 Disaggregated monitoring indicators by gender and indigenous peoples will be developed for monitoring of social \nbenefits, economic opportunities in the project area, road safety, resettlement activities, and the HIV/AIDS \nawareness and prevention of human trafficking program. \n \nHas an output been prepared?

This summary initial environmental examination (SIEE) report has been prepared to \nsummarize  the  potential  environmental  impacts  of  the  proposed  Project,  which  has  been \nclassified category B under the Asian Development Bank (ADB) categorization system. An initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  was  prepared  under  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance 1 (TA)  in  accordance  with  the  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines2 of ADB. The IEE was prepared by the TA consultants and Ministry of \nCommunications, Transport, Posts, and Construction (MCTPC) and has been approved by the \nScience, Technology and Environment Agency. \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n2.  The Project comprises (i) improvement of 367 km of the project road from Xiang Ngeun \n(the junction with National Route 13 near Louangphrabang) to Nakha (on the border with \nThailand), construction of a bridge over the Mekong River on the project road and improvement \nof about 100 km of rural access roads in the project area; (ii) procurement of equipment for use \nin operating the border post at Kenthao (now under construction) and for enforcement of axle-\nload  controls  on  the  project  road; (iii)  consulting  services  for  construction supervision  and \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  as  well  as  detailed  design  for  the  rural  access  roads;  (iv) \nmaintenance of the national road network by financing periodic road maintenance subprojects; \n(v) improvement of road safety by financing consulting services to continue the ongoing road \nsafety assistance program; and (vi) a program to reduce the risks of HIV/AIDS and human \ntrafficking that may develop during the rehabilitation and operation of the project road. The \nproject road (National Highway No. 4) is located in the northern Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic (Lao PDR), linking the two northern provinces of Louangphrabang and Xaignabouri. \nThe entire length of the project road (367 km) will be improved to a hard surface road (double \nbituminous  surface  treatment,  and  single  bituminous  surface  treatment  in  section  5).  The \nproposed alignment will generally follow the existing alignment, with some minor adjustments to \nprovide suitable curves and improved line-of-sight. Drainage will be improved with ditches. \nImprovement of the project road will also involve reconstruction and maintenance of bridges, \nand construction of box and pipe culverts. The Project will be implemented over a period of \nabout 6 years, including pre-construction activities.   \n \n3.  The road has been separated into the following five sections: section 1: junction of Road \n13 to Pakkhone (59.7 km); section 2: Tha Deua to Nam Pui (80.99 km); section 3: Nam Pui to \nPaklai (99.93 km); section 4: Paklai to Lao PDR-Thailand Border (65.54 km); and section 5: Lao \nPDR-Thailand Border to Nakha (62.32 km). The proposed project road will be class III and V (in \nsection 5) with carriageway width between 4.5 meters (m) (in section 5) and 7.0 m with 1.0 m \nsealed shoulders and formation widths of between 8.5 (in section 5) and 12  m.  The IEE \nboundaries for the road are, in general, 50 m on either side of a road centerline. For ecological \nimpacts determination, it is extended to 1 km on either side of the road centerline. For air and \nnoise impact prediction, it is extended to 50 m on either side of the road. The surface water IEE \nboundaries are 50 m downstream and 25 m upstream of any work site over the water. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

The climate in northern Lao PDR is subtropical and influenced by the annual southwest \nmonsoon, and has a distinct dry and rainy season. Dry season is between November and \nMarch, and rainy season between April and October. During dry season, the weather cools and \nno rain may fall for several months. In the rainy season, the weather is hot with heavy rainfall. \nThe two project provinces are considered mountainous areas. About 98% of the total land area \nof  Louangphrabang  and  about  70%  of  the  total  land  area  of  Xaignabouri  are  classified \nmountainous. Since the project road is in a rural setting and passes through small villages, and \nthere is limited industrial development, existing air quality is quite good with the exception of \ntotal  particulate  matter  along  gravel  roads.  Noise  levels  are  relatively  low.  There  are  no \nsignificant wetland areas or ponds in the project area. \n \n2.  Ecological Resources \n5.  There are 15 protected areas located in project districts. These include Nam Pouy \nNational Biodiversity Conservation Area (NBCA), and 14 Provincial Protected Areas. In the \nvicinity of the project road, the forests consist mainly of planted teak, scrubs, and degraded \nsecondary forests that have been developed into agricultural land for rice, teak plantations, \ngardening, and shifting cultivation. Undisturbed secondary forests are found far from the project \nroad. NBCA is not anticipated to be directly affected by the Project since rehabilitation of the \nproject road is limited to the existing alignment, with some minor adjustments, and no additional \nroad segments or new alignments are planned within the NBCA. The distance between the road \nalignment and NBCA at the nearest point is approximately 0.6 km. Thus, NBCA including its \nbuffer zone will not be encroached upon by road widening and alignment adjustment activities. \nThe 14 Provincial Protected Areas are located farther away and will not be impacted by the \nProject. Presence of rare and endangered species in the project vicinity has not been reported. \n \n3.  Economic Development \n6.  Within the project area, there is a range of small- and medium-scale industrial activities. \nThese include a number of furniture factories; agro-processing industries, including distilleries; \nmeat processing plants; drinking water factories; and other factories such as noodle factories, \nice factories, bakeries, and rice mills. Service industries include print shops, TV/radio repair, \nwatch repair, and garages. Construction-related industries include sawmills, small brick factories, \na number of small river-sand and gravel extraction operations, and rock crushing enterprises. \nAgriculture is the main source of income for local people. \n   \n7.  Louangphrabang  city  of  Louangphrabang  Province  is  the  most  important  tourism \nattraction in Lao PDR, and has been a World Heritage Site since 1995. Xaignabouri Province \nhas  little  tourism.  In  the  project  area,  a  number  of  tourism  sites\u2014both  open  and  under \ndevelopment\u2014are located near Route 4 and will have an increased number of visitors because \nof the road upgrading. \n  \n4.  Social and Cultural Resources \n8.  Land acquisition for the Project will affect the assets of about 290 households along the \nroad. The losses will include agricultural land, residential land, structures, trees, and crops. The \n ", "58  Appendix 11 \nresettlement plan defines these losses and all compensation measures. No historical, cultural, \nor archaeological sites will be affected by the Project. \n   \nD.  Forecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n9.  The Project is not anticipated to cause major adverse environmental impacts since it will \nmainly involve rehabilitation of the existing road alignment. The majority of the impacts identified \nwill be experienced during the construction period, so they are largely temporary in nature. \nPotential impacts include soil erosion caused by earth movement, damage to agricultural land \nas a result of improper spoils disposal, loss of vegetation and habitat, air and noise pollution, \nwater pollution, health and safety risks, and traffic disruption.   \n \n10.  The mitigation measures identified in the IEE\u2019s environmental management plan (EMP) \ninclude (i) restoration of affected areas, e.g., borrow pits, after project completion; (ii) avoiding \naggravation of soil erosion-prone areas; (iii) controlling sewage discharge and other waste fluids \nfrom  construction  sites,  and  hazardous  and  toxic  materials  from  bitumen  plants  and  from \nconstruction equipment; (iv) maintaining proper drainage to avoid stagnation and controlling \ndownstream water pollution; (v) topsoil removal and reinstallation for revegetation on completion \nof  road  improvement  works;  (vi)  minimizing  noise,  dust,  emissions,  and  other  pollutants \nassociated with civil works; and (vii) provision of adequate road access during construction. \nDetailed information on environmental impact and mitigation measures is in Supplementary \nAppendix  E.  The  civil  works  contractors  will  implement  these  mitigation  measures.  The \nsupervision  consultant,  MCTPC  through  its  Environment  and  Social  Division  (ESD),  and \nconcerned government environmental agencies will monitor their implementation. The cost for \nenvironmental mitigation measures is estimated at $666,100 and the cost for environmental \nmonitoring and capacity development is about $137,600. \n  \n11.  The Nam Pouy NBCA is not anticipated to be directly affected by the Project, since road \nrehabilitation is limited to the existing alignment, and no additional road segments or new \nalignment is planned within the NBCA. At the nearest point, the distance between the NBCA\u2019s \nbuffer zone and the road alignment is approximately 0.6 km. Thus the NBCA, including its buffer \nzone,  will  not  be  encroached  on  by  road  widening  and  alignment  adjustment  activities. \nNonetheless, enforcement of wildlife regulations prohibiting illegal wildlife trade, especially trade \nin endangered species for the NBCA, will be strengthened under the Project. The strengthening \nwill be implemented by the NBCA management unit through a checkpoint operation on the \nproject road, regular patrolling, and a wildlife awareness campaign among local people. The \nbudget will be covered by the Project and is included in the environmental mitigation cost. \n \n12.  Positive impacts that may be attributed to the Project because of the provision of a \nsealed all-weather road are (i) elimination of heavy road dust emission, thereby reducing safety \nrisks  caused  by  extremely  poor  road  visibility;  (ii)  reduced  dust-associated  health  risks  to \nroadside  communities;  (iii)  improved  living  conditions;  (iv)  reduced  transport  costs;  and \n(v) increased economic growth in the project area and the region.   \n \n13.  Implementation of the Project, in conjunction with other Greater Mekong Subregion \n(GMS) road projects and other development activities in the corridor, may result in the following \ncumulative impacts, over a longer time frame and beyond the project area: (i) an increase in air \npollutants and greenhouse gas emissions; (ii) land use changes caused by improved access \nand economic growth; (iii) increased demand for and potential contamination of water resources; \n(iv) overall aesthetic transformation of the landscape; (v) changes in land values; (vi) improved \nhealth and sanitation conditions of residents because of better access; (vii) increased HIV/AIDS  \n ", "                    Appendix 11  59\n \nand  sexually  transmitted  infection-related  public  health  risks;  and  (viii)  poverty  alleviation \nthrough trade promotion. \n \n14.  Potential interventions for the identified cumulative impacts, which are beyond the scope \nof the IEE for the Project, may be formulated at a strategic and regional level and include: (i) a \nsectoral  and  corridor-wide  cumulative  impact  assessment  study;  (ii)  a  set  of  policy \nrecommendations addressing cumulative impacts; (iii) a set of mitigation or response programs \nwith  broader  temporal  and  spatial  dimensions  beyond  the  Project\u2019s  construction  site  and \nduration; and (iv) comprehensive review of development programs in land use, water resources, \nair quality, and public health and safety in response to the impacts to ensure the sustainability of \nthe Project. \n \n15.  The final decision on which rural access roads will be improved under the Project will be \nmade during implementation, so the rural access roads are not included in the IEE. MCTPC, \nwith the assistance of the supervision consultant, will conduct an environmental assessment of \nthe  candidate  rural  access  roads  based  on  the  environmental  assessment  and  review \nprocedure prepared for the rural access roads, which is in Supplementary Appendix F. The cost \nof  the  environmental  assessment  for  rural  access  roads  is  approximately  $10,000  and  is \nincluded in the supervision consultant\u2019s budget. Rural access roads for logging or mining\u2014or \nthose  passing  through  protected  forests,  protected  wetlands,  or  rare  habitats\u2014will  not  be \nselected. \n \nE.  Institutional Requirement and Monitoring Program \n16.  To ensure that the environmental management and monitoring produces acceptable \noutputs, the following parties will fulfill their responsibilities for environmental management and \nmonitoring as described in the IEE: ESD; Provincial Science, Technology and Environmental \nOffices;  Staff  in  the  Department  of  Communication,  Transport,  Posts,  and  Construction \nresponsible  for  environmental  and  social  issues;  project  management  unit;  construction \nsupervision consultant; contractor; and NBCA management unit. \n \n17.  MCTPC will ensure that (i) the EMP provisions are incorporated in the project design \nand  specifications;  (ii)  environmental  clearance  or  approval  is  secured  from  the  Science, \nTechnology and Environment Agency prior to site works; (iii) the bidding documents include the \nEMP (i.e., mitigation and monitoring requirements) for implementation by contractors; (iv) EMP \nimplementation is monitored and results are reported regularly; (v) there is coordination among \nconcerned parties to effectively implement the EMP; (vi) additional mitigation measures are \nimplemented  as  necessary;  and  (vii) appropriate  environmental  assessment,  along  with \nformulation of mitigation measures and a monitoring program, is undertaken should there be \nmajor changes in the project alignment, design, and specifications. \n \n18.  The contractor will be responsible for implementing the mitigation measures during the \nconstruction  phase.  Compliance  monitoring  will  be  carried  out  by  ESD  through  the  staff \nresponsible for environmental and social issues (to be assisted by the construction supervision \nconsultant) to assess the contractor\u2019s compliance with the EMP provisions. The construction \nsupervision consultant will assess if the EMP prepared for the project road is also applicable to \nthe rural access roads and will include additional environmental controls, as necessary. \n \n19.  To monitor passengers and local people\u2019s compliance with wildlife regulations for NBCA \nin the Project\u2019s operation phase, the Project will support ongoing monitoring of the NBCA \n ", "60  Appendix 11 \nmanagement unit. This will ensure that the Project will not cause increased pressure on illegal \nwildlife trade, particularly trade in endangered species. \n \nF.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure  \n20.  A number of consultation meetings were held during the environmental assessment \nprocess between June and November of 2006. These meetings included members of relevant \ngovernment  offices  and  affected  people  along  the  project  road.  During  the  study  period, \n59 government  offices  (including  District  Agriculture  and  Forestry  Offices,  the  NBCA \nmanagement unit, and District Offices of Culture and Information); and 82 village chiefs and \nvillagers  were  involved  in  discussions  related  to  the  proposed  Project.  Village  chiefs  and \nvillagers  were  generally  positive  about  the  proposed  upgrading  of  roads,  welcomed  the \nimprovement on some impassable sections, and would like to see environmental regulations \nbetter enforced through the project area. Consultations were conducted publicly with names, \ndates, and issues documented; and the records are in the appendix of the IEE, which will be \nposted on the ADB website. The consultants informed the participants that during the project \nconstruction phase, copies of the IEE and its EMP and the environmental monitoring program in \nthe Lao language will be available at the District Office of Culture and Information, and copies \nmay be requested by any of the participants for their use in monitoring progress and the \nimplementation of mitigation actions. \n \nG.  Findings and Recommendations \n21.  The IEE prepared for the project road and Mekong River bridge crossing provides an \nassessment of potential impacts during various project phases. Mitigation measures to address \nsuch impacts are contained in the EMP, which can be adopted by any co-financier for any \nportion of the proposed Project. Based on findings of the IEE, the potential impacts from the \nProject are not considered significant. For various impacts identified during the construction and \noperation phases, corresponding mitigation measures have been formulated. Further, impacts \nthat might occur during the construction phase are considered temporary. The indirect impact to \nthe NBCA in the operation phase is considered minor, and will be addressed by the NBCA \nmanagement unit with support from the Project. Proper implementation of the EMP will ensure \nminimal impacts to the environment.  \n  \nH.  Conclusion \n22.  Results of the environmental assessment show that, with proper implementation of the \nEMP, the Northern GMS Transport Network Improvement Project will not cause adverse impacts \nto the environment. The IEE conducted for the Project is deemed sufficient and no additional or \nfollow-up environmental study is recommended. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20071003100007+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20070905162218+08'00'", "Title": "Northern Greater Mekong Subregion Transport Network Improvement Project ", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2", "Author": "IAD", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)", "Keywords": "rrp, 35305, lao, northern greater mekong subregion, transport network improvement project, transport sector,roads hiways,sustainable economic growth, inclusive social development"}, "author_page": " \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 30 September. \nFY  before  a  calendar  year  denotes  the  year  in  which  the  fiscal  year  ends, \ne.g., FY 2006 ends on 30 September 2006.  \n(ii)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVice President  C.
