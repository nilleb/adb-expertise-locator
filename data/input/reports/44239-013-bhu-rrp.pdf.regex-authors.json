I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Kingdom of Bhutan for the Air Transport Connectivity Enhancement Project.1 \n \n2.  The  project  is  to  improve  infrastructure  for  the  Bumthang,  Gelephu,  and  Yonphula \ndomestic airports. It aims to expand initial developments undertaken by the Government of \nBhutan at these airports. The project is to strengthen safety and security, and enhance capacity, \nincluding priority needs for securing the airport perimeter; expanding terminal space, air craft \nparking apron, and taxiway; improving runways; and installing aeronautical communication and \nnavigation  aid  equipment.2 These  improvements  are  targeted to meet the  requirements  of \ncurrent and anticipated aviation activities in the country, and help continue the record of safety. \nOverall,  it  will  support  the  government\u2019s  plan  to  develop  a  safe,  reliable,  and  efficient  air \ntransport system connecting urban and rural centers to help overcome the current limitations of \nroad transport and improve accessibility to less-developed regions of the country. This will help \nfacilitate  greater  and  more  equitable  coverage  of  potential  benefits  from  tourism  growth, \nstimulate private sector development, and generate employment opportunities for the poor. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Landlocked  Bhutan  faces  unique  development  challenges  and  opportunities.  The \nexpansion and maintenance of physical infrastructure is critical for increasing the country\u2019s \nmeasure  of  gross  national  happiness.  The  country\u2019s  small  population  of  about  700,000,3 \nmountainous terrain, and formidable weather condition mean that achieving economies of scale \nin service delivery is difficult, and building and maintaining vital infrastructure, particularly the \nroad network, is costly. Consequently, high external and domestic transport costs, and lack or \nlimited accessibility have constrained the country\u2019s economic and social development. \n \n4.  Paro International Airport (PIA), Bhutan\u2019s only operating airport until recently and still the \nonly one providing international air access, is located near the capital city of Thimphu in the \nwestern region. Due to the lack of domestic air connectivity, other regions of the country\u2014\nparticularly in the center, south, and, east\u2014have limited access to regional and global markets. \nThe tourism industry, for instance, a substantial economic contributor, is much better developed \nin  the  west  compared  with  other  regions.  This  imbalance  in  accessibility\u2014to  opportunity, \nenterprise, markets, and services\u2014has been an obstacle to achieving broad-based economic \ngrowth, which is one of the government\u2019s major development goals. \n \n5.  Following  the  country\u2019s  vision  statement,4 the  government\u2019s  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan \n(2008\u20132013) highlights the development objectives for the country\u2019s transport system, focusing \non enhancing connectivity to facilitate greater coverage of basic social services, including health \nand education in isolated regions, and improving transport efficiency\u2014reducing travel time and \ncost\u2014to boost domestic trade and cross-border transport. This will stimulate private sector \ndevelopment and generate employment opportunities for the poor. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided a project preparatory technical assistance (TA) to conduct a \nfeasibility study and due diligence. ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for the Air \nTransport Connectivity Enhancement Project. Manila (TA 7633-BHU, $600,000, approved on 5 November). \n3  ADB. 2011. Basic Statistics 2011. Manila. \n4  Government of Bhutan. 1999. Bhutan 2020: A Vision of Peace, Prosperity and Happiness. Thimphu. ", "2 \n \n \n6.  To help achieve these objectives, the government decided to develop a safe, reliable, \nand efficient network of domestic air transport connecting urban and rural centers  to help \novercome current limitations of road transport, increase accessibility, and promote tourism and \nhigh-value agriculture in less-developed regions. In keeping with this strategy and based on \nairport  master  plans  and  feasibility  studies,  in  2010  the  government  selected  and  started \ndeveloping three domestic airports\u2014upgrading an existing airfield at Yonphula in the east, and \nconstructing new airfields at Bumthang in the center, and Gelephu in the south.5 By December \n2011,  domestic  flights,  although  limited  in  frequency,  started  operating  at  Bumthang  and \nYonphula, and flight operations at Gelephu are expected to start during 2012. However, due to \nlimited available funding, the current facilities at these airports are very basic and only for initial \nair operation and passenger accommodation. Deficiencies include inadequate or lack of aircraft \nparking apron and taxiways, runway wearing course and drainage, communication equipment, \nsecurity fencing, and other support facilities. \n \n7.  Overall, air transport activity in Bhutan is set to increase substantially as a result of the \ngovernment\u2019s continued effort to brand and market tourist attractions in the country and the new \ninitiative under way to introduce domestic air links. In 2010, the air passenger volume at PIA \nreached 127,181 passengers per annum (ppa), tripling from about 33,890 in 2000. Based on the \nupdated air traffic forecast, if unconstrained by capacity,6 total air passenger traffic could grow to \nabout 491,200 ppa by 2020, of which approximately 12% (59,900 passengers) would be carried \non the new domestic services. By 2030, total ppa is forecast to increase on an unconstrained \nbasis  to  915,100  ppa,7 of  which  domestic  passengers  would  account  for  17.4%  (159,600 \npassengers). \n \n8.  In view of the anticipated increase in aircraft movements and passenger volume, current \ndeficiencies must be addressed, and initial developments undertaken by the government at the \nthree domestic airports expanded to strengthen safety and security, and enhance capacity. The \nproject  will  include  (i)  improving  air  operation  safety  by  providing  required  air  rescue  and \nfirefighting system facilities, aeronautical communication and navigation, and runway drainage; \n(ii) strengthening security  with an airport cordon around the perimeter; and (iii) expanding \ncapacity  for  terminal  space,  aircraft  parking  apron,  and  taxiway.  The  improvements  were \nprioritized based on development needs identified in updated master plans for the three airports, \nprojected traffic forecasts in terms of peak hour aircraft movements and passenger volume, as \nwell as updated assessment of current developments and priorities for air transport in the \ncountry.8 By improving safety, security, and capacity at the three domestic airports, the project \nwill help ensure operation of aircrafts with adequate capacity for continued passenger traffic \ngrowth and improved service and safety. \n \n9.  In keeping with lessons from similar projects in the region, regulatory and institutional \ncapacity is critical to ensuring sustainable development of air transport  in the country. An \nassessment of the organizational and management capacity of the Department of Civil Aviation \n                                                \n5  Airport Development Programme and Master Plans for Yonphula and Bumthang under the Bhutan Aviation Sector \nCapacity Development Project (2006\u20132008) financed by the Swedish International Development Cooperation \nAgency, and the Gelephu Site Feasibility Study (2008) financed by the government. \n6  The unconstrained scenario assumes the PIA runway maintains the current peak hour capacity of 4 aircraft \nmovements per hour, and the tourist infrastructure is able to accommodate the increasing number of tourists. \n7  The unconstrained scenario assumes improvements at PIA increase the peak hour capacity from 4 aircraft \nmovements per hour to 5 by 2022, and to 6 by 2027. \n8  Previous airport master plans and feasibility studies were reviewed and updated under the technical assistance for \nthe Air Transport Connectivity Enhancement Project (footnote 2).  \n ", "3 \n \n(DCA) (footnote 2), including policy dialog with the government regarding the current regulatory \nframework, identified needed improvements. These include updating civil aviation acts and \nregulations to reflect current needs, developing a strategy to adapt a regulatory and operating \nframework based on international standards, and improving human resource development with \ntechnical training in the critical areas of regulatory oversight and airport operations. To help \nmeet these needs, capacity development technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) will be implemented starting in 2012.9 It will strengthen the country\u2019s air transport \nregulatory and operating performance, and help ensure that the benefits from the project\u2014the \nfirst ADB-financed investment in air transport in Bhutan\u2014will be optimized and sustainable. \n \n10.  The project and its outcome is consistent with the strategic objective set out in the \ninterim country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132013: to assist the government in achieving broad-\nbased economic growth.10 It will enhance the country\u2019s air transport connectivity, help improve \naccess to regional and global markets throughout the country, and support tourism growth in \nless-developed regions. The project is included in the Bhutan country operations business plan, \n2012\u20132014.11 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  In support of the country partnership strategy, the project impact will be improved air \ntransport connectivity. The immediate outcome will be improved safety, security, and capacity at \nthree domestic airports in Bumthang, Gelephu, and Yonphula. \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  The outputs will be improved infrastructure at the three domestic airports, comprising (i) \nperimeter fencing of 4 kilometers (km), runway asphalt overlay of 36,000 square meters (m2), a \ngeneral service and maintenance vehicle, and all-weather access road of 1 km in Bumthang; (ii) \nperimeter fencing of 4 km including security gate and guard house, air rescue and firefighting \nservice support facilities, a general service and maintenance vehicle, all-weather access road of \n2 km, expansion of terminal area of 1,000 m2, apron and taxiway of 6,000 m2, runway drainage \nsystem,  flood  protection  structures,  and  communication  and  navigation  aids  equipment  in \nGelephu; (iii) removal of small hills beside runways12, air rescue and firefighting service support \nfacilities, a general service and maintenance vehicle, and repair of runway strip drainage of 500 \nmeters in Yonphula. \n \n13.  The outputs will be achieved through key activities including (i) engagement of design \nand  supervision  consultant  to  prepare  detailed  engineering  design,  specifications,  bill  of \nquantities, cost estimates, and bidding documents; (ii) procurement of contracts for works and \nequipment; and (iii) execution of contracts to carry out the works and install equipment. \n \n \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2011.

The latest debt sustainability analysis determined that Bhutan had moderate risk of debt \ndistress and was, therefore, eligible to receive 50% of its ADF allocation as grants. \n14 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  July 2012\u2013June 2016 \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2016 \nManagement \n(i)   Executing agency  Ministry of Information and Communications \n(ii)  Implementation unit  Department of Civil Aviation (Paro International Airport), 8 staff \nProcurement  International competitive bidding  5 contracts  $4.86 million \n     \nShopping  3 contracts  $0.27 million \nConsulting services  Design and supervision consultant  13.5 person- $0.77 million \nusing quality-and cost-based selection  months \nwith simplified technical proposals and  international and \na 90:10 proportion of quality to cost,  47.0 person-\nas the nature of the assignment related  months national \nto civil aviation requires priority \nconsideration for quality \n     \nAdvance contracting  Goods, works, and consulting services \nDisbursement  The grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed between the Government of Bhutan and \nADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Government of Bhutan. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n18.  Engineering. The engineering design will be based on site condition surveys and field \ninvestigations,  optimizing  the  required  improvement  works  for  economy  and  construction \nefficiency  in  accordance  with  applicable  international  design  standards.  The  construction \nmethod will use proven technology with standard materials compatible with local conditions. To \nenhance resilience to climatic hazards and disasters, built-in civil engineering measures will be \nassessed and applied, including flood protection structures, design values of storm frequency \nand  runoff,  and  drainage  systems.  Hydrological  considerations  will  be  heightened  in \nconsultation with the government\u2019s hydro-meteorological services division.  \n \n19.  Operation and maintenance. DCA\u2019s Technical Support Division, which comprises four \nsections\u2014civil, electrical, mechanical, and horticulture and beautification\u2014is currently providing \nadequate maintenance services for PIA\u2019s airport facilities. With minimum staffing, it relies on \nexternal local contractors for several maintenance functions including some major maintenance \nactivities for airside facilities such as the runway, taxiways, and apron. For current and future \nmaintenance  requirements  for  the  domestic  airports,  DCA  has  assigned  six  full-time \nmaintenance staff\u2014two stationed at each airport in Bumthang and Yonphula, and two at the \nGelephu airport once operations begin. Additional and more specialized maintenance staff could \nbe seconded from PIA when required. Also under the project, general service and maintenance \nvehicles will be provided for each domestic airport at Bumthang, Gelephu, and Yonphula. \n \n ", "6 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n20.  The economic assessment was carried out in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for the \nEconomic  Analysis  of  Projects.15 By  improving  safety,  security,  and  capacity  at  the  three \ndomestic airports, the project will help ensure operation of aircraft types with adequate capacity \nfor  continued  passenger  traffic  growth  and  improved  service  and  safety.16 The  economic \nbenefits are derived from the air traffic that will be generated. Economic benefits will include an \nincrease in tourist spending derived from longer stay in the regions and additional tourist arrivals \nto the country with better accessibility to more parts of the country, aeronautical revenues \nreceived by the airport from new traffic, and improved aircraft utilization by the airline operator. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  project  investment  is  estimated  at  18.7%.  A \nsensitivity analysis tested the effects of possible unfavorable scenarios resulting from changes \nin the key parameters that determine the project\u2019s costs and benefits. The analysis indicates \nthat the project\u2019s economic viability would remain satisfactory even under adverse scenarios, \nand that a cost increase of 53% or decrease in benefits of 30% would be required to reach a \ncut-off economic internal rate of return of 12%. \n \n21.  The  financial  assessment  was  undertaken  to  assess  the  viability  of  the  project \ninvestment based on revenues from the domestic airport improvements to cover the capital and \noperating costs. The financial internal rate of return is estimated at 2.9%.17 Based on the \nfinancial projections and evaluation, the project is financially sustainable and will generate \nsufficient revenue to meet the operation and maintenance expenditure and will recover the \ninvestment  made.  However,  the  rate  of  return  on  investment  will  not  be  significant.  The \neconomic analysis demonstrates the social and economic benefits from improved accessibility, \nincluding substantial tourism growth potential and local employment generation. Thus, overall \nthe project is considered viable.18 \n \nC.  Governance \n22.  Policy, legal, and institutional capacity. DCA, established in 1986 and currently under \nthe  Ministry  of  Information  and  Communications  (MOIC),  will  be  the  executing  agency \nresponsible  for  administration  of  civil  aviation  and  all  matters  concerning  regulation  and \noperation of the country\u2019s airports and airfields. The DCA director general reports to the MOIC \nsecretary. Based on the sector assessment carried out under ADB\u2019s project preparatory TA, a \ncapacity development TA (footnote 9) is under way to strengthen the regulatory and operating \nperformance of air transport, including (i) preparing updates for the Civil Aviation Act 2000 and \napplicable Bhutan air navigation regulations to reflect current needs; (ii) formulating a framework \nfor restructuring DCA and drafting necessary legislation to enable effective separation of the \nregulatory and operating functions; and (iii) providing technical training in the critical areas of \nregulatory oversight and airport operations. While DCA does not have experience with ADB-\nfinanced projects, it has undertaken infrastructure improvements funded by government sources \nand successfully implemented improvements funded by other bilateral development partners. \n \n                                                \n15 ADB. 1997.

Thimphu. This is used as a benchmark for financial viability. \n18 The use of an ADF grant is appropriate as the rate of return on investment will not be significant, and overall social \nand economic benefits will accrue for the country. \n ", "7 \n \n23.  Financial  management.  An  assessment  was  carried  of  DCA\u2019s  accounting  system, \nfinancial reporting, and external audit procedures (footnote 2). DCA, a government agency, \nfollows the accounting and reporting process detailed in the Finance and Accounting Manual \ndeveloped by the Ministry of Finance. Based on this, DCA maintains its accounts on a cash \nbasis and utilizes the government\u2019s standardized budget and accounting system, computerized \nsince 2003, which produces satisfactory financial reports and ensures availability of data. DCA\u2019s \nproject implementation unit for the project will include a suitably qualified accountant. DCA will \nmaintain separate project records and accounts to identify the financing resources received and \nexpenditures made for the project, ensuring an adequate audit trail. The Royal Audit Authority of \nBhutan, an independent and nonpartisan institution authorized to perform audits on government \nagencies, will annually audit project accounts and related financial statements in accordance \nwith international auditing standards.19 To minimize risks, ADB's direct payment procedure will \nbe  used  for  a  substantial  portion  of  the  disbursements  for  works,  goods,  and  consulting \nservices. \n \n24.  Procurement  and  anticorruption. Under the government\u2019s Procurement Rules and \nRegulations (2009), the Public Procurement Policy Division under the Ministry of Finance is the \noversight agency for public procurement in the country and is mandated, among other things, to \nmake  recommendations  to  the  government  for  reform  of  the  procurement  policy  or  laws, \nprepare standard biding documents, issue technical guidelines and manuals on procurement, \nliaise  with  government  organizations  to  develop  human  resources  and  professionalism  in \nprocurement,  and  act  as  the  central  counterpart  for  any  procurement-related  issues  in \nconnection with donors. The regulations also recognize that donor rules and procedures on \nprocurement may prevail in the case of donor-funded projects. The Anti-Corruption Commission \nunder the Anti-Corruption Act of Bhutan, enacted in 2006, has authority to take necessary \nactions to prevent and combat corruption; investigate acts of corruption whenever there is \nevidence of corruption; sanction corrupt firms from participating in government bids; and monitor \nimplementation of the anticorruption national strategy. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government, MOIC, and DCA. The \nspecific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  project \nadministration manual (footnote 14). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n25.  Poverty  reduction  and  social  impact.  The  government\u2019s  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan \nidentifies poverty reduction as a core development theme, mainstreaming the poor through a \ntargeted approach. In support of this, the three domestic airports covered by the project are \nlocated in the poorer gewogs and dzongkhags of the country.20 The primary beneficiaries, \nbased on the socioeconomic survey of the project influence area, will be people who are \ngeographically disadvantaged with poor accessibility by roads.21 Improved air transport service \nwill reduce travel time and help ensure emergency services for women, the sick, and the elderly. \nIt will also help promote tourism, enhancing opportunities for local businesses and employment. \n \n26.  Gender. As the project activities are confined within the boundaries of each airport, the \nproject will not directly interface with nearby communities. However, a gender analysis was \n                                                \n19 Audit standards are broadly in line with those of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions. \n20  Gewogs and dzongkhags are equivalent to village blocks and districts, respectively. Bhutan consists of 205 \ngewogs, comprising 20 dzongkhags.   \n21 The  socioeconomic  survey  covered  20%  of  households  in  the  project  influence  area,  and  included  public \nconsultations  and  focus  group  discussions  to  gather  feedback  from  local  communities  on  the  proposed \ndevelopment project and perceived socioeconomic impacts. \n ", "8 \n \nundertaken as part the social and economic assessment to assess possible impacts. Women in \nthe  project  influence  area  are  mainly  engaged  in  agriculture  and  home-based  income-\ngenerating activities. Most are anticipating possible benefits from employment opportunities \nduring construction and business opportunities from tourism growth.22 Women are expected to \nattain equal benefits from the project. Provisions in bidding documents require contractors to \nensure that all civil works comply with all applicable labor laws; do not employ child labor for \nconstruction or maintenance; encourage the employment of the poor, particularly women; and \ndo not differentiate wages between men and women, particularly for work of equal value. \n \n27.  HIV/AIDS. The government has initiated many HIV/AIDS-prevention activities in the \ncountry, which has a very low incidence of HIV. Based on the poverty and social assessment, \nthe project does not anticipate any rise in the risk of HIV/AIDS incidence. Contractors will carry \nout  HIV/AIDS  awareness  activities  for  laborers  at  work  sites,  which  will  be  monitored  by \nsupervision consultants. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n1.  Involuntary Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples \n \n28.  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  C  in \naccordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). As the civil works and installation of \nequipment for the project will be undertaken within the existing boundaries of the respective \nairports, no private land or property will be acquired. Due diligence was undertaken to assess \nthe status of compensation paid to affected people for land acquired by DCA for prior airport \ndevelopment undertaken with government funding. All the affected people have either been paid \ncash compensation or provided with land for land. \n \n29.  Impact on indigenous peoples. No indigenous peoples are living in the project area. \nNo impact on indigenous peoples is envisaged as no physical or economic displacement will be \nrequired. Therefore, the project is classified as category C. \n \n2.  Environment \n \n30.  As the works and installation of equipment for the project will be improvements within the \nboundaries of existing airport facilities already developed by the government, the anticipated \nenvironmental impacts are low. Therefore, the project is classified as category B. In accordance \nwith ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement, necessary due diligence of the environmental impacts \nfor existing facilities previously developed by the government was carried out. In this respect, \nthe initial environmental examination (IEE) includes a section on the review of environmental \nimpacts and mitigation measures taken during construction of the existing facilities, as well as \nrecommendations  for  continued  and  improved  actions  during  implementation  of  additional \nimprovements under the project. Anticipated environmental impacts include occupational health \nand  safety  issues,  generation  of  dust  and  noise,  and  drainage  problems.  These  can  be \naddressed during the detailed design and construction phase through appropriate design and \nmitigation measures recommended in the environmental management plan (EMP). Typically for \nairport projects, the main long-term impact is the generation of noise, vibration, and air pollution \nduring operations. In addition to complying with applicable international standards, appropriate \nlandscaping and greenbelt development in each airport area is recommended to help minimize \nimpacts.  Consultations  with  communities  residing  in  and  around  the  airport  sites  were \n                                                \n22 Focus group discussions were undertaken with women belonging to different socioeconomic groups. \n ", "9 \n \ncompleted.  The  IEE  report  includes  details  of  the  consultations,  feedback  received, \nrequirements for further consultation, and a grievance redress mechanism. As required by \nADB's Safeguard Policy Statement, the IEE report was disclosed. \n \n31.  DCA needs to strengthen its overall institutional capacity, including for environmental \nsafeguards,  which  will  be  assessed  and  addressed  under  ADB  capacity  development  TA \nstarting in 2012 (footnote 9). For the project, DCA\u2019s project director will serve as the overall \nenvironmental safeguard coordinator. The project coordinator for each airport will serve as the \non-site focal point for environmental safeguards. The design and supervision consultant team \nwill include an environment specialist to update the EMP and monitor contractor compliance. \nDuring implementation, training and coordination workshops on environmental safeguards and \nEMP  implementation  will  be  conducted  for  DCA,  consultants,  and  contractors.  Annual \nenvironmental monitoring reports will be prepared and submitted to ADB for disclosure on the \nADB website, as required by ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement for environment category B \nprojects. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n32.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.23 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nGovernment delay in releasing  ADB will cover 100% of total expenditure for works, goods, and services, \ncounterpart funds  exclusive of taxes and duties to be exempted by the Government of \nBhutan. This will ease the financial burden on the government to provide \ncounterpart funding and, thereby, ensure adequate cash flow during \nimplementation. \nLack of previous experience  The design and supervision consultant team, including international and \nwith ADB-funded procurement  national procurement specialists, will help DCA\u2019s project implementation \nunit prepare bidding documents and the bid evaluation report, and \nexecute the contracts. \nImplementation delay  Advance action is being taken with the objective of awarding the \nconsulting services contract shortly following grant effectiveness to \nensure timely commencement of engineering design and preparation of \nbidding documents. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n33.  The government and MOIC have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n34.
