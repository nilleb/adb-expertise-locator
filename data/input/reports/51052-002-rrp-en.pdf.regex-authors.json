THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of Uzbekistan for the Railway Efficiency Improvement Project. \n \n2.  Directly complementing other projects in Uzbekistan for the electrification of its railway \nnetwork, two of which are supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the project will \nprocure a new fleet of 24 electric locomotives, and offer cleaner, more reliable, and efficient \npassenger and freight transport services. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Strategic location of Uzbekistan. Surrounded by Afghanistan to the south, Kazakhstan \nto the north and northwest, the Kyrgyz Republic to the northeast, Turkmenistan to the southwest, \nand Tajikistan to the southeast, Uzbekistan serves three of six Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation (CAREC) corridors. With about 33 million people, Uzbekistan is the most populous \ncountry in Central Asia. It is doubly landlocked\u2014requiring crossing at least two countries to reach \na seaport\u2014so transport plays an important role in sustaining its socioeconomic development. \n \n4.  Critical role of railways. Rail transport has a unique competitive advantage over road \ntransport for moving goods in bulk over long distances, as well as for moving passengers between \ndensely  populated  cities.  The  4,669-kilometer  (km)  Uzbekistan  rail  network  carries  about \n68 million tons of freight and 21 million passengers annually. In Uzbekistan\u2019s land transport \nsystem, railways carry about 40% of the total freight volume, and about 4% of the total passenger \nvolume.1 Since 2004, Uzbekistan\u2019s gross domestic product has on average grown by more than \n7% per year. This has contributed to strong demand for rail transport. Ongoing improvements in \nthe  relationship  between  Uzbekistan  and  its  neighbors  will  further  add  to  such  demand. \nThe  vertically-integrated  public  railway  company  O\u2019zbekiston  Temir  Yo\u2019llari  (UTY)  expects \ndemand for rail transport to steadily grow in line with economic activity in the country and in the \nsubregion. \n \n5.  The recently approved CAREC Railway Strategy 2017\u20132030 notes railways\u2019 role as an \nengine for economic growth in Central Asia, especially as they help countries to diversify trade \npatterns, attract foreign direct investment, increase participation in global production networks, \nincrease related trade in manufactured products, and diversify exports.2 \n \n6.  Consistency with national development objectives. The government\u2019s Development \nStrategy for 2017\u20132021 pursues five priority areas: (i) improvement of the system of state and \npublic construction; (ii) safeguarding of the rule of law and further reform of the judicial system; \n(iii)  economic  development  and  liberalization;  (iv)  development  of  the  social  sectors;  and \n(v) security, inter-ethnic harmony and religious tolerance, and implementation of a balanced and \nmutually beneficial and constructive foreign policy.3 Transport and communication are seen as \nkey in supporting priority areas (iii) and (iv), and the strategy specifically mentions the importance \nof improving transport services, raising passenger safety, and reducing harmful emissions. \n                                                \n1  United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. 2019.

The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, \nand in particular its operational priorities in (i) tackling climate change, building climate and \ndisaster resilience and ensuring environmental sustainability, (ii) strengthening governance and \ninstitutional capacity, and (iii) fostering regional cooperation and integration.4 The state-of-the-art \nelectric locomotives to be procured under the project will cut greenhouse gases by 900,000 tons \nper annum and also reduce local air pollution. The improved efficiency of train services brought \nabout by the project will help reduce journey time on Uzbekistan\u2019s railway network, improve \nservice quality and reliability on the CAREC transport network, and strengthen the conditions for \nthe private sector to grow. The project will thereby contribute to the goals of the CAREC Railway \nStrategy 2030 (para. 5). The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \nUzbekistan,  2012\u20132016, 5  which  calls  for  investments  in  the  transport  sector  and  the \nmodernization of railway infrastructure. Railways are expected to feature as a critical area for \nADB\u2019s  support  in  its  forthcoming  country  partnership  strategy  for  Uzbekistan,  2019\u20132023. \nThe project is included in the country operations business plan for Uzbekistan, 2019\u20132021.6 \n \n8.  Major achievements by Uzbekistan to modernize railways. Since its foundation in \n1994, UTY has gradually implemented a holistic railway modernization program, including the \ncompletion of a unified rail network, electrification and modernization of existing lines, and \nimprovement of rolling stock.7 The government accorded particular importance to electrification, \nand 2,530 km\u2014more than 50% of the network\u2014are now electrified. These efforts were supported \nby ADB, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Japan International \nCooperation Agency, German development cooperation through KfW, the Kuwait Fund for Arab \nEconomic Development, the OPEC Fund for International Development, the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, and the World Bank. \n \n9.  UTY  has  worked  with  development  partners  to  undertake  institutional  reforms. \nWith support from ADB, the government initiated UTY reforms in 1997, under which ancillary \nservices such as health, recreation, and education were largely separated from core operations.8 \nThe  downsizing  of  staff  and  noncore  assets  improved  the  efficiency  and  sustainability  of \noperations. Since 2015, the World Bank has been supporting the further modernization of \nbusiness processes, including the accounting system. Even with these reforms, the nature of \nrailways as a public good requires the continued support of the public sector. \n \n10.  Remaining challenges. Based on the above achievements, UTY has the scope to further \nshorten transport time, improve service quality, and reduce operating costs by upgrading its \ninfrastructure, improving operational efficiency, and upgrading its locomotive fleet. This would \nallow  railways  to  remain  competitive  against  road  transport,  and  help  improve  economic \nopportunities, boost regional trade, and reduce environmental impacts for the country. \n \n11.  In contrast to the advanced rate of electrification of the network (para. 8), the current \nlocomotive fleet of UTY consists of 75% diesel and only 25% electric engines; this includes \n37 electric locomotives which were procured within the last 10 years. Most locomotives have \nserved more than 30 years, far beyond their service life. Limitations in the absolute number of \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2018.

Manila. \n ", "3 \nelectric locomotives caused by a lack of financial resources, and the fact that the existing fleet is \nalready being used to its maximum potential, make it difficult to reliably expand freight and \npassenger train services and meet growing demand (para. 4). The slow acceleration rate and low \ntop speeds of the diesel locomotives, as well as the switching required between diesel and electric \nengines, lengthen transport time and add to the fleet\u2019s inefficiencies. Locomotive depots are \ntailored to the servicing of diesel vehicles and need to be upgraded to handle an increasingly \nelectrified fleet. \n \n12.  Institutionally, UTY remains a financially robust organization with the ability to carry all \noperation and maintenance (O&M) costs, and the majority of capital works. However, similar to \nother railway organizations throughout the world, it faces heavy competition from road transport \n(passenger and freight) and, in the case of transit traffic, from other countries. The ability of UTY \nto maintain its financial sustainability depends on its ability to improve the attractiveness of its \nservices to clients. This requires a combination of improved infrastructure and rolling stock, and \nrefinements to its business planning process. \n \n13.  Envisaged benefits. The project tackles these challenges by reducing the bottleneck in \nthe availability of electric locomotives, and allowing UTY to maximize the use of its increasingly \nelectrified network (para. 8).9 It will also support UTY\u2019s wider efforts to aggressively invest in \nnecessary infrastructure and improve its business processes. Three distinct benefits from the \nproject are foreseen. First, the procurement of 24 electric locomotives will help UTY to increase \nthe level and reliability of train services for both passengers and freight. Second, the project will \nimprove the environmental performance of the transport network of Uzbekistan by  moving \ntransport away from the roads and because electric trains generate less noise, vibration, local \npollutants, and greenhouse gases than diesel trains. The locomotives will also have a climate-\nproof design, allowing for their operation in mountainous terrain under harsh weather conditions. \nThird, the project improves Uzbekistan\u2019s connectivity with neighboring countries and to markets \nbeyond, by expanding the frequency and quality of train services on CAREC corridors. \n \n14.  Lessons learned. ADB has provided four loans to Uzbekistan, two for the rehabilitation \nand modernization of the railway infrastructure (footnote 8), and two for the electrification of the \nMarakand\u2013Karshi and Pap\u2013Namangan\u2013Andijan railway lines.10 ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation \nDepartment rated the rehabilitation and modernization projects successful and the government\u2019s \nand  UTY\u2019s  performance  highly satisfactory.11 The  Marakand\u2013Karshi  project  was  completed \nsuccessfully in 2018, ahead of schedule and on budget. The Pap\u2013Namangan\u2013Andijan project is \nlargely on track, with major procurement activities completed by Quarter 1 of 2019. Lessons from \nthe implementation of these projects include (i) scoping the project to focus on components that \nadd most value to UTY, e.g., electrification as opposed to general track works; (ii) designing \nrealistic capacity development components to avoid process reforms that cannot be completed \nwithin the project time frame; (iii) coordinating on challenges common across the subregion \n                                                \n9  Transaction technical assistance of $1,000,000, financed by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other \nsources) was approved in 2017 to prepare the project. \n10 ADB. 2011.

Impact and Outcome \n15.  The impact of the project is aligned with the government\u2019s development strategy, and in \nparticular: implementation of targeted programs to build affordable housing, development and \nmodernization of road and rail transport, engineering, communication, and social infrastructure \nachieved (footnote 3). The project will have the following outcome: efficiency of passenger and \nfreight transport throughout Uzbekistan\u2019s railway network improved.12 \n \nC.  Outputs \n16.  Output 1: Electric locomotives commissioned. The project will provide 24 state-of-the-\nart electric locomotives, of which 16 are optimized for freight trains and 8 for passenger trains. \nThese will be used throughout the growing network of electrified railway tracks in Uzbekistan, help \nmitigate the chronic shortage of locomotives, and cater to the increase in freight and passenger \nmovements. Since it is cheaper to operate electric locomotives than diesel ones, this will help \nimprove the cost efficiency of train operations.  \n \n17.  Output 2: Locomotive depot upgraded. To effectively cater to the maintenance needs \nof the new electric fleet, the project will upgrade the locomotive depot in Tashkent, named \n\u201cO\u2019zbekiston\u201d, so it can service electric locomotives as well. ADB has worked with UTY during \nproject processing to ensure that this will be done in a gender-sensitive manner (para. 39). \n \n18.  Output 3: Long-term development strategy implemented. A key value addition of the \nproject will be the implementation of a new long-term development strategy for UTY to improve \nits operational efficiency, optimize the use of its fleet, ensure timely adjustment of tariffs, optimize \noperating expenses and further promote gender equality (para 39). The long-term development \nstrategy is planned for finalization by the third quarter of 2019 and ADB is actively supporting this \nprocess. It will update existing plans, and guide the future direction of UTY and help to maintain \nits position as a financially sustainable and technically robust organization in Uzbekistan as well \nas in the Central and West Asia subregion. It will define the future investment needs of UTY and \nsupport the sound rationalization  and  prioritization  of  projects  by  strengthening the  project \nformulation process and the use of traffic demand and market analyses. It will also articulate how \nUTY can mobilize and structure resources efficiently and sustainably. Such resources may be \nsourced from UTY\u2019s own revenue, government funds, international financing institutions, and \ncommercial sources. The long-term development strategy will also benefit from the injection of \nknowledge through a newly-approved regional technical assistance being provided to CAREC \nmember countries including Uzbekistan to tackle challenges common across the subregion.13 \n \n19.  Value added by ADB assistance. The project is part of ADB\u2019s comprehensive support \nto Uzbekistan\u2019s railway subsector, and complements recent investments in the electrification of \nmain railway lines (para. 14). ADB\u2019s preparation and implementation support adds value to UTY \nin three ways. First, the electric locomotives to be procured under the project will have features \nto maximize their quality and reliability; particular attention was given to making the locomotives \nresilient to climate change and capable of operation in mountainous terrain and under harsh \n                                                \n12 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n13 ADB. 2018.

Second, UTY\u2019s internal capacity to procure high-quality locomotives in the \nfuture will be improved by ongoing assistance to UTY staff in the procurement process, and in \nattracting financing from various sources. This will equip UTY with the in-house skills to further \nmodernize its fleet, beyond the 24 locomotives to be procured under this project. Third, the \nimplementation of its long-term development strategy will equip UTY for the future as described \nin para. 18.  \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n20.

Subject to the project\u2019s sound implementation progress, additional financing may be \nconsidered to allow a larger number of electric locomotives to be procured, so as to match the \ngrowing electrified railway network and to accelerate the retirement of aged diesel locomotives. \nSince ADB\u2019s financial assistance to Uzbekistan is limited in size relative to such needs, ADB will \nproactively work with UTY and the government to mobilize alternative sources of financing, \nincluding commercial cofinancing wherever effective and efficient. UTY and the government\u2019s \ncapacity to leverage larger levels of investments will be strengthened through the implementation \nof UTY\u2019s long-term development strategy. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n26.  UTY will be the executing agency. It has a sound track record in executing projects \nfinanced by ADB and other international financial institutions. UTY also carries out sound O&M of \nelectrified  and  non-electrified  lines.  The  Project  Implementation  Unit  for  Electrification  and \nRenewal of Rolling Stock (PIU-ET), with staff experienced in international financing institutions\u2019 \nprocedures and policies, will be responsible for implementing the project. The technical and \nadministrative departments of UTY will also assist the PIU-ET during project implementation. \nFor the implementation of the long-term development strategy, a working group under the \nsupervision of UTY management will be maintained. To ensure continuity and consistency, \nconsultants recruited under the transaction technical assistance will be retained to support UTY \nin  procurement  activities  and  in  the  early  phases  of the  long-term  development  strategy\u2019s \nimplementation. The project will be implemented in close coordination with development partners, \nboth at the country level and at subregional level. On the former, ADB will cooperate with the \nWorld Bank, who is supporting the government in the preparation of a transport sector strategy \nfor Uzbekistan. On the latter, ADB will continue to actively engage development partners through \nthe CAREC program. \n27.  All  procurement  financed  under  the  ADB  loan  will  follow  open  competitive  bidding \nprocedures pursuant to ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and \nProcurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). Procurement \n ", "7 \nwill  consist  of one goods  package  with  a  lot each for  passenger  and freight  locomotives. \nThe procurement method will be one-stage, one-envelope, without prequalification. \n \n28.  The primary suppliers for the locomotives to be procured will be from ADB member \ncountries.  However,  the  locomotives  require  certain  integral  parts\u2014braking  system,  radio \nequipment,  safety  devices,  wheels,  and  automatic  couplings\u2014that  originate  from  non-ADB \nmember countries such as Belarus, Czech Republic, Russian Federation, and Ukraine; these \nparts are estimated at about 6% of the procurement value. These parts are necessary for the \nlocomotives to meet regulatory requirements set by the Government of Uzbekistan and the \nCouncil for Rail Transport of the Community of Independent States, to ensure interoperability of \nthe locomotives with the existing infrastructure and other rolling stock in Uzbekistan. Procuring \nthese parts separately and outside of the ADB-financed project is uneconomical, impractical and \nmay lead to safety issues. A waiver of the country eligibility requirement is requested from the \nADB Board of Directors, based on the strong technical, regulatory, safety, and economic rationale \nfor the inclusion of such parts. The Board of Directors must approve the waiver by a vote \nrepresenting not less than two-thirds of the total voting power of the members of the Board. \nWith the exception of the above, civil works and the supply of materials and equipment from \ncountries that are not members of ADB will be financed by UTY from its own resources and \nprocured under existing government procedures consistent with the principles of economy and \nefficiency. \n \n29.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 14). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  July 2019\u2013June 2025 \nEstimated completion date  June 2025 \nEstimated financial closing date  December 2025 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight agency  Ministry of Investments and Foreign Trade and Ministry of Finance \n(ii)  Executing agency  UTY \n(iii)  Implementation unit  For the procurement of electric locomotives and the upgrade of the locomotive \ndepot: Project Implementation Unit for Electrification and Renewal of Rolling \nStock of UTY. \nFor  the  long-term  development  strategy:  working  group  steered  by  UTY \nmanagement \nProcurement  Open competitive bidding  Electric locomotives (goods)  [This information \nwas deemed \nconfidential \naccording to \nparagraph 2 (v) of \nADB\u2019s Access to \nInformation Policy \n(2018).] \nConsulting services  None     \nRetroactive financing and/or  Advance  contracting  action  will  be  taken  on  the  procurement  of  electric \nadvance contracting  locomotives.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n30.  UTY  has  the  capacity  and  experience  for  the  procurement  and  O&M  of  electric \nlocomotives. It is experienced in operating electrified railways. Currently, it maintains 2,530 km of \nelectrified lines. Its staff has been continuously trained in the maintenance of electrification and \nmodernized signaling and telecommunication facilities, and in the safe operation of electric \nlocomotives. The same measures will apply after the completion of the project to ensure efficient \nand safe O&M. \n \n31.  The technical specifications for the locomotives to be procured under the project are a \nproduct of collaboration between UTY staff, ADB staff, and consultants mobilized by ADB. \nThe specifications incorporate considerations of energy efficiency and climate resilience, the latter \ngiven the harsh climatic conditions that the locomotives are facing. Further, UTY staff and ADB\u2019s \ntransaction technical assistance consultants conducted a life-cycle assessment to ensure that the \nlocomotives provide reliable and efficient operations throughout their long life. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n32.  Economic viability. An economic analysis of the project was carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects,15 comparing the incremental costs \nof the project with its incremental benefits. The main economic benefits are savings in (i) time for \nboth passengers and freight, (ii) carbon dioxide emissions, (iii) energy costs, and (iv) locomotive \nmaintenance costs. The analysis indicates that the project is highly economically viable, with an \neconomic internal rate of return of 13.7%, compared with the 9% discount rate. \n \n33.  Financial sustainability. A financial analysis of the project was carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Financial Management and Analysis of Projects16 to ascertain whether \nthe project is financially viable. The analysis, done on highly conservative assumptions, shows \nthat the financial internal rate of return is 9.4%, above the weighted average cost of capital \ncalculated at 0.9%. Institutionally, UTY\u2019s financial capacity is sufficient to implement the project, \nfund its contribution to the project costs, repay the ADB loan, and make the required payments \non its existing debt. Previously, UTY needed to surrender to the government 50% of foreign \ncurrency revenue earned from transit traffic at a fixed exchange rate. This practice has now been \nabolished by the government and UTY is allowed to fully retain such earnings. This has allowed \nUTY to remain financially robust as an entity, despite macroeconomic reforms being undertaken \nin the country such as the floating of the sum. \n \nC.  Governance \n34.  Financial management. The financial management risk is moderate. UTY has sufficient \ncapacity to manage and maintain adequate accounting systems, financial controls, and audit \narrangements required for the project. A low to moderate risk exists in the area of accounting \nsystem and reporting integration. UTY has developed an approach to manage this risk, and is \ncurrently implementing a new accounting software package that is expected to rectify the issue. \n \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n16 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "9 \n35.  Procurement.  The  overall  procurement  risk  is  moderate  with  mitigation  measures. \nA project procurement risk assessment identified both advantages and shortfalls in the capacity \nof UTY to manage international procurement. Procurement staff have experience with open \ncompetitive  bidding  but  require  continued  support.  The  transaction  technical  assistance \nstrengthened UTY\u2019s capacity for procurement and project management with training and support \nby an independent international procurement consultant. The same consultant will keep assisting \nUTY during critical procurement phases, up to the award of contracts. \n \n36.  To date, ADB-financed projects in Uzbekistan have been subject to lengthy delays in \nimplementation, due to multiple review and approvals by government authorities for feasibility \nstudies, bidding documents and contracts. In July 2018, the government passed a new resolution \nstreamlining such procedures.17 In line with these new procedures, the executing agency and \nADB have worked to secure the endorsement of the government\u2019s feasibility study by Quarter 1 \nof 2019. Bidding documents have been fully prepared, and bidding has commenced in Quarter 1 \nof 2019. The project is highly procurement ready. \n \n37.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended from time to time) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the government and UTY. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 14). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n38.  A social and poverty assessment ascertained that the project will help reduce transport \ncosts and travel time; ensure safety; and increase access to jobs, markets, health care, and \neducation facilities for the local population. The primary beneficiaries will be passengers, freight \ntransporters, and agro-industrial producers. \n \n39.  The project is categorized as some gender elements. The project offers opportunities to \nimprove  the  participation  of  women  in  the  railway  subsector,  which  traditionally  has  been \ndominated by men. UTY will take measures to recognize such opportunities and maximize the \nparticipation of women in locomotive O&M. Women employees of UTY will take part in the \npreparation and implementation of the long-term development strategy, which will define ways to \nmake the railway system in Uzbekistan and human resource practices at UTY more friendly \ntoward women, such as incentives to recruit, retain, and promote women; provision of in-service \ntraining; and zero tolerance for any form of discrimination, including sexual harassment in the \nworkplace.  The  locomotive  depot  will  be  equipped  with  separate  sanitary  facilities  (toilets, \nshowers, changing rooms) for the 213 women currently employed. The gender action plan \nspecifies the activities and targets.18 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n40.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.19 \n \n41.  Environment (category C). The project will have minimal or no adverse environmental \nimpacts. It supports the development of an environment-friendly mode of transport.

Thus the switch from diesel to electric traction, and the modal shift from road to \nrailway transport, is expected to bring a net reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of 900,000 tons \nper annum. Possible negative environmental impacts would be related to the upgrade of the \nlocomotive depot, and may be limited to minor waste management and construction impacts. \n \n42.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The project will not require any land acquisition \nand resettlement as per ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. ADB conducted social due diligence \nof the project, and the Social Due Diligence Report was posted on the ADB website for public \ndisclosure in March 2018.20 In case any land acquisition and resettlement impacts occur during \nimplementation, UTY shall prepare a land acquisition and resettlement plan to be submitted to \nADB for approval prior to awarding a civil works contract. The land acquisition and resettlement \nplan will be implemented in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and national \nlegislation and regulations. \n \n43.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The country in general and the project area in \nparticular do not have indigenous people communities as defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement for operational purposes. Therefore, no further action will be required. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n44.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.21 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nMacroeconomic changes  ADB will support UTY\u2019s ongoing efforts to ensure stable financial performance \narising from the floating of the  through UTY\u2019s long-term development strategy.
