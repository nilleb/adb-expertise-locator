THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased loan to the Republic of Indonesia for subprogram 2 of the Financial Market Development \nand Inclusion Program.1 The report also describes the proposed technical assistance (TA) for \nPromoting Innovative Financial Inclusion, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.  \n \n2.  The  proposed  subprogram  2  supports  the  government\u2019s  main  reform  priorities  in \ndeveloping and making the finance sector more inclusive, and represents a medium- to long-term \npartnership between the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the government, and the Financial \nServices Authority (OJK). The government\u2019s priority areas include (i) strengthening the regulatory \nstructure for financial stability, (ii) deepening the financial market, and (iii) enhancing financial \ninclusion with a focus on promoting access to financial services to poor households and women. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The programmatic approach and subprogram 1 policy-based loan were approved by the \nADB Board of Directors on 1 September 2015. The program includes three subprograms aligned \nwith the government\u2019s strategy and critical finance sector reforms. The first subprogram focused \non  establishing  the  OJK  as  a  unified  and  independent  financial  services  regulator  and \nimplementing international best practices. Subprogram 2 focuses on support to the consolidated \nfinance sector master plan and advancing OJK\u2019s fiscal independence. Responding to government \nconcerns of rising inequality and the recommendations from the 2016 National Financial Inclusion \nStrategy, subprograms 2 and 3 further expand ADB\u2019s engagement in financial inclusion, with a \nfocus on improving poor families\u2019 access to financial services, financial literacy, and consumer \nprotection. This provides the platform for a subsequent dedicated financial inclusion sector \ndevelopment program in 2020. The approach uses policy-based lending as it embeds the policy \nmatrix within the government\u2019s policy decision-making process. The loan proceeds provide \nincentives for reforms. The attached TA builds capacity of the government and the OJK.    \n \n4.  Development problems. Indonesia is facing the twin problems of insufficient growth and \nrising household income inequality. Economic growth has steadily declined from 6.4% in 2010, \nand its average growth between 2014 and 2016 was approximately 5.0%. This is low compared \nto its medium-term growth rate, which averages 5.6%. Growth is expected to remain only slightly \nabove 5.0% in 2017.2 This may not be sufficient to provide employment for the 3 million additional \npeople who attain working age each year. While commodity prices have begun to recover, \nstructural weaknesses in the economy, such as the low competitiveness of the real sector and \ninadequate investments in infrastructure, underlie this prolonged slowdown in economic growth. \nIndonesia needs new sources of growth to meet its ambitious economic growth target of 8.0% by \n2019. This requires acceleration in public and private infrastructure investments to improve \neconomic competitiveness, investment climate, and inclusive financial intermediation.  \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2015. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \nProposed Programmatic Approach and Policy-Based Loan to the Republic of Indonesia for Subprogram 1 of the \nFinancial Market Development and Inclusion Program. Manila. \n2  The International Monetary Fund and ADB projected growth of 5.1% in 2017 while the World Bank projected growth \nof 5.2% for 2017.   ", "2 \n5.  Against this backdrop of slower economic growth, the government is finding it difficult to \nreverse the trend of rising income inequality. Since 2000, Indonesia has experienced one of the \nlargest increases in household income inequality in Southeast Asia. The Gini coefficient, which \nmeasures a country\u2019s household income inequality, increased from 0.30 in 2000 to 0.39 in 2016. \nInequality is closely connected to poverty, especially in rural areas, where 62.2% of the poor \nreside. Moreover, while 10.7% of the population lives below the poverty line, about 40.0% of all \npeople remain clustered around the national poverty line.3 Significant improvement is required to \nmeet the government\u2019s Gini coefficient target of 0.36 by 2019. Literature shows that financial \nexclusion is directly related to inequality.4 This is because financial exclusion deprives the poor \nof opportunities to raise incomes through savings and pensions and mitigate financial risks arising \nfrom natural disasters and economic shocks. Other factors affecting inequality include unequal \naccess to education, jobs, public services and inefficient redistributive policies. \n \n6.  In Indonesia, financial exclusion of a large share of the adult population is a problem. \nBased on data from the 2015 Global Findex, only 36% of the Indonesian adult population has a \nformal bank account (Figure 1). This compares unfavorably with Malaysia and Thailand, where \nover 75% of the population has a bank account. Similarly, the share of the adult population with \naccess to formal credit is relatively low in Indonesia. Only 13% of the adult population in Indonesia \nhas a loan from a formal financial institution compared with 20% in Malaysia. Access to bank \naccounts by the poorest 40% of people is 22%, which is also significantly lower than in Malaysia \nand Thailand. Access to accounts by women is also low at 37% compared with 75% in Thailand.5 \n \nFigure 1: Financial Inclusion in Indonesia and Selected Countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n \nSource: Global FinDex 2015. \n   \n7.  A developed and stable financial system safeguards the inclusiveness of the financial \nsystem and has a positive effect on reducing inequality and poverty.6 Financial instability can \nadversely affect businesses, reduce job opportunities and credit availability, and raise the cost of \nfinance. This particularly affects the poor and vulnerable as access to finance is an important \ncoping strategy for them to deal with economic and financial uncertainties. The establishment of \n                                                \n3  Data from National Statistics Office of Indonesia, https://www.bps.go.id/. \n4  International Monetary Fund. 2015.

Financial Development, Inequality, and Poverty:  Washington, DC.  ", "3 \nthe OJK as a unified regulator is the first step to develop the finance sector and promote stability \nin an integrated manner. Financial stability is legally a joint responsibility between the OJK, Bank \nIndonesia, Ministry of Finance and the Deposit Insurance Commission. The separation of roles \nbetween the OJK and Bank Indonesia is clear.7 The OJK exercises micro prudential supervisory \npowers whereas Bank Indonesia oversees macro prudential surveillance, monetary policy and \nthe payment system.  These institutional reforms have improved financial stability. As of February \n2017, Indonesia\u2019s senior 5-year credit default swap, which is used as a proxy for financial system \nrisk, improved to 140 basis points compared with 280 basis points in September 2015.8 However, \ndownside risks to stability still exist, as nonperforming loans and corporate external debt exposure \nhave marginally increased. In addition, Indonesia\u2019s shallow domestic capital market can make the \nfinance sector susceptible to heightened market volatility and vulnerable to the risk of sudden \ncapital outflow. In addition, despite efforts to deepen the market, Indonesia\u2019s finance sector \nremains largely bank based and is relatively small. In 2016, finance sector assets (bank credit, \nmarket capitalization, and bonds) represented 105% of gross domestic product, compared with \nabout 175% for the Philippines; 179% for Viet Nam; and over 300% for Malaysia and Thailand. \n \n8.  Binding constraints. The government has recognized the challenges it needs to address \nto have a stable, developed, and inclusive finance sector. They are (i) the incomplete framework \nand coordination mechanism for financial stability, (ii) the shallow finance sector, and (iii) financial \nexclusion. These constraints are discussed in paras. 9\u201311.  \n \n9.  Incomplete  framework  and  coordination  mechanism  for  financial  stability.  A \ncomprehensive  regulatory  framework  and  operational  coordinating  mechanism  underpin \nprudential  supervision  and  financial  stability.  Four  main  impediments  affect  this.  First, \nnotwithstanding the setting up of the OJK as a unified regulator, the organization and reporting \nstructure of the OJK still mirrors that of the former regulators with each subsector reporting directly \nto a chief executive. This is reflected in the practice of each subsector having its own blueprint or \nplan which at times does not consider developments in other subsectors. In addition, the capacity \nof the regulators of each sector is uneven, which complicates the adoption of a fully integrated \napproach to licensing, supervision, and information sharing. Second, the OJK\u2019s operational \nindependence requires it to be financially independent. The OJK should be able to operate based \non levies collected from the industry. Until 2016, the government continued to partially fund OJK \noperations by allocating a total of Rp4.1 trillion from the 2014 and 2015 national budgets. Third, \nuntil recently the regulatory framework for financial stability did not provide the OJK with the \nauthority to require systemic banks to increase capital to mitigate financial risks. In addition, \nregulators  and  supervisors  did  not  have  legal  immunity  from  prosecution,  which  impedes \nenforcement. Fourth, the coordination mechanism for financial stability was not institutionalized.  \n \n10.  Shallow finance sector. The key challenge to deepening the finance sector is to develop \na strong and credible finance sector, including Islamic finance, based on international standards \nand best practices. There is also a need to develop an enabling environment to develop the \nfinance sector. There are three impediments to meeting these objectives. First, the regulatory \nframework for corporate governance of publicly listed companies takes a traditional prescriptive \napproach. This is not in line with international best practices which promote public disclosure of \ncompliance with corporate governance. Provisions on conflict of interest and a whistleblowing \nsystem  also  require  strengthening  in  Indonesia.  Second,  the  government  and  the  OJK\u2019s \ncommitment to develop Islamic finance should be based on international best practices including \nin taxation and prudential standards. The capital gains tax imposed on all asset transfers hampers \n                                                \n7  Regulatory Structure of Financial Sector Regulators (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n8  This is still high compared to the 70\u201390 basis points for Thailand and the Philippines.  \n ", "4 \ndevelopment of Islamic capital market, including for infrastructure financing as they require \nmultiple asset transfers leading to doubling of capital gains tax. Thus, the tax framework is biased \nagainst Islamic capital market products. In Indonesia, the size of the corporate sukuk (Islamic \nfinancial certificate similar to corporate bond) market by the end of 2016 is only $900 million \ncompared to $88 billion in Malaysia which has tax neutrality. Third, subnational governments are \nreluctant to issue municipal bonds because they are required to undergo audit processes from \ntwo auditors, which is costly. This duplication arises because of conflicting laws. The local \ngovernment law requires subnational governments to be audited by the Supreme Audit Board, \nwhereas the capital market law only accepts audits by private auditors registered with the OJK. \nOther constraints include inadequate accounting and reporting guidelines for the repo market.9  \n \n11.  Financial exclusion. Inadequate financial literacy and incomplete consumer protection \nhave contributed to a large share of the adult population being excluded from the finance sector. \nMicrofinance in Indonesia has the potential to increase access to finance in remote areas but \nrequires  close supervision from the OJK  and structured  capacity  building for the  industry. \nBranchless banking, where agents are contracted locally amongst the community to offer financial \nproducts, is also promising but for now is heavily focused in the more developed regions of Java. \nFurthermore, the 2016 OJK financial inclusion and literacy survey shows that literacy amongst \nwomen (26%) is lower than men (33%) and the national average (29%). The survey also shows \nlarge regional disparities in financial literacy among the population. For example, financial literacy \nrates of the adult population in Jakarta (40.0%) and West Java (38.7%) are far higher than in \nWest Papua (19.3%). There is a need for the OJK to develop literacy programs that better target \nthe  population,  including  school  students,  women  and  poorer  income  regions.  Incomplete \nconsumer protection also contributes to financial exclusion. The establishment of the Securities \nInvestor Protection Fund (SIPF) is a step in the right direction. However, the number of financial \nintermediaries covered by the fund is limited and the amount of coverage provided to investors \ninadequate. Similarly, alternative dispute resolution, which provides investors relief from lengthy \ncourt processes, is promising but must cover all subsectors and operate efficiently. \n \n12.  Government reform agenda. Indonesia\u2019s National Medium-Term Development Plan for \n2015\u20132019 (RPJMN) seeks to promote \u201cgrowth with equity\u201d by reducing the Gini coefficient to \n0.36 and lowering the poverty rate to 7%\u20138% by 2019. The government recognizes that promoting \nfinancial stability, developing the financial market, and improving access to financial services for \nthe poor are integral to meeting these targets. The government\u2019s strategy consists of a series of \nreforms\u2014starting with implementing the OJK\u2019s mandate as an independent and unified regulator, \ndeveloping a regulatory framework, and implementing crisis management protocols for financial \nstability, followed by measures to develop the capital market and a stronger focus on financial \ninclusion. In addition to the RPJMN, the government also launched the National Financial \nInclusion Strategy in August 2016, which sets an ambitious target for 75% of the adult population \nto have access to financial services by 2019. Also, launched in 2016, and with ADB assistance, \nis the OJK\u2019s consolidated Financial Sector Master Plan, 2015-2019, which includes 411 reforms \nand programs, 134 of which are considered priority.   \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s experience. ADB has had a long-term engagement with the government on \nfinance sector development, recognizing that finance sector reforms are sequential and long term. \nOne of the most significant finance sector reforms has been the creation of the OJK as a unified \nand independent regulator in 2012 which can be traced back to ADB\u2019s assistance in 1999. \nBetween 1999 and 2012, ADB provided consistent support through six major finance sector \n                                                \n9  Repo is a repurchase agreement used to raise short-term capital, and considered the base of finance sector \ndevelopment, especially for the capital market. ", "5 \noperations (Figure 2). This started with the Financial Governance and Social Security Reform \nProgram of 2002, supporting the implementation of nonbank finance sector reform, designing the \nOJK, and amending relevant laws and regulations.This was followed by ADB\u2019s capital market \n \ndevelopment  program  and  technical  assistance  (TA)  grant  in  2007,  which  focused  on \nstrengthening market surveillance and investor protection. The OJK Law was enacted in 2011, \nand the OJK started implementing its mandate to regulate the capital market and nonbank \nfinancial institutions in December 2012. The initial focus on the capital market and nonbank \nfinancial institutions was supported by ADB\u2019s Financial Market Development and Integration \nProgram (FMDIP), approved in 2012, and associated TA projects. After the establishment of the \nOJK, ADB continued to support the government and the OJK through the approval of the FMDIP \ncluster and subprogram 1 in 2015 (footnote 1). Through the FMDIP, ADB\u2019s initial focus was to \nsupport (i) the OJK to implement its mandate including developing the technical and regulatory \ncapacities for an independent and unified regulator, and (ii) the government to develop and \ncoordinate finance  sector  policies through the  Center  of Financial  Sector  Policies  (PKSK). \nSubprogram 2 broadens ADB\u2019s areas of engagement to include financial inclusion reforms. The \nFMDIP complements ADB\u2019s other programs on investment climate and public finance linked to \nsustainable development goals.10  \n \n14.  Lessons from the experience. ADB\u2019s experience provided three lessons that were \nincorporated into the program. First, developing the legal structure for an integrated regulator is \njust the first step. The OJK needs extensive support, particularly to develop subsectors with \nweaker capacities, as a prerequisite for effective integrated supervision. Hence the FMDIP\u2019s \nsupport  in  capital  market  and  nonbank  financial  institutions  subsectors.  Second,  reducing \ninequality requires a comprehensive approach including reforming social assistance programs, \nimproving the investment climate, and financial inclusion. Third, financial inclusion reforms should \nbe holistic and require complementary reforms in enhancing access to financial services, financial \nliteracy, consumer protection, and using financial technology.  \n \n15.  ADB\u2019s value addition to program design and implementation. ADB approved a policy \nadvisory TA in 2015 to support key reforms that underpin reforms in subprogram 2 of the FMDIP.11 \nThe TA supported reforms in all three outputs covering financial stability, development, and \ninclusion. The TA also supported PKSK in the Ministry of Finance with capacity development and \npolicy advisory services. Separate TA was mobilized to support local government reforms, \nincluding capacity building and shadow issuances for municipal bonds.12 In addition, regional TA \non capital market integration supported the OJK to adopt best practices in corporate governance \nbased on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Corporate Governance Scorecard.13  \n \n16.  The results from this assistance have been impressive. The Law on Prevention and \nResolution of Financial System Crisis enacted in 2016 is a significant landmark for financial \nstability. The law provides legal immunity for supervisors who perform their duties in good faith. \nThe law also provides criteria for designating systemically important banks and reinforces risk-\n                                                \n10 ADB. 2016.

At the same time, the OJK became fiscally autonomous. With ADB assistance, \nthe OJK launched the consolidated finance sector master plan in January 2016, which prescribes \nkey finance sector reforms. The OJK has set up a cross-sector team to monitor implementation \nof the master plan. The government is also developing a tax neutrality framework for Islamic \ncapital market products to attract more foreign investments especially for infrastructure.  In \nfinancial inclusion, the OJK launched the International Center for Microfinance and Financial \nInclusion which now provides capacity building programs to the industry. The OJK also expanded \nthe number of investors to 654,389 (assets of Rp3,569 trillion) protected under the SIPF. Finally, \nthe OJK increased the number of banks participating in branchless banking from four to 16 and \nnow covers 106,490 agents in 499 districts. \nFigure 2: ADB\u2019s Engagement in Finance Sector Development in Indonesia \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, FI = financial inclusion, FMDIP = Financial Market Development and Inclusion \nProgram, GoI = Government of Indonesia, OJK = Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (Financial Services Authority), SP = \nsubprogram, TA = technical assistance.   \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n17.  Development partner coordination. Close coordination between ADB, the International \nMonetary  Fund,  the  World  Bank,  and  other  development  partners  has  created  strong \nprogrammatic synergies in the finance sector. Coordination is demonstrated by ADB\u2019s support to \nimplement  selected  recommendations  from  the  Financial  Sector  Assessment  Program. \nCoordination for the FMDIP is based on the government\u2019s process through PKSK. Jointly with the \nWorld Bank, ADB supports the Coordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs, which chairs the \nsecretariat for financial inclusion in the National Council. Development partners provide support \nto working groups in the council. The financial inclusion division of the PKSK, which ADB supports, \nleads the working group on policies and regulations.14  \n \n18.  Economic impact of the program. The three outputs of the program combined are \nexpected to lead to increased development and inclusiveness of the finance sector. The potential \neconomic gains, including lower cost of government borrowing, are to be achieved through (i) \nstrengthening the regulatory structure for financial stability, (ii) deepening the financial market, \nand (iii) enhancing financial inclusion (para. 31).  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n19.  The impact will be increased annual growth rate of the finance sector in alignment with the \nRPJMN, 2015\u20132019. The outcome will be increased development and inclusiveness of the \n                                                \n14 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "7 \nfinance sector. At the inception of the programmatic approach in 2014, the government agreed to \naccomplish seven expected prior actions (or triggers) and 18 policy milestones as a basis for \nsubprogram  2. 15  All  seven  prior  actions  have  been  accomplished,  with  four  exceeding \nexpectations. During processing of subprogram 2, a new prior action on financial literacy was \nadded and the policy milestone on the law on crisis prevention was upgraded to a prior action to \nadvance reforms in this area.  \n \n20.  At the government\u2019s request, ADB agreed to refine some policy milestones with the aim \nof streamlining the policy matrix. Four of these milestones are now merged into two policy actions \nas  they  were  related  to  similar  complementary  reforms.  One  new  milestone  on  financial \ntechnology was added, and one policy milestone was shifted to subprogram 3 and replaced with \na milestone reflecting changes in legislative priority. Subprogram 2 still contains 25 reform actions \n(9 expected prior actions representing high-impact reforms and 16 policy milestones), which the \ngovernment and the OJK accomplished in advance during July 2015\u2013March 2017. The changes \nin the policy matrix are reflected in the revised design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \nSubprogram 3 will include 10 prior actions and 12 policy milestones. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n21.  Output 1: Regulatory structure for financial stability strengthened. This output builds \non accomplishments in subprogram 1 to establish the OJK\u2019s integrated supervisory framework \nand strengthen the coordination mechanism for financial stability. There were 4 accomplishments \nin subprogram 2. First, the government enacted in 2016 the Law on Prevention and Resolution of \nFinancial System Crisis that provides the OJK with powers to increase capital for systemic banks \nto mitigate financial crisis and provides regulators with legal immunity. Second, the OJK achieved \nfull operational fiscal autonomy. Through the implementation of its revenue-raising powers, the \nOJK collected $337 million of levies from the industry, allowing full operational cost recovery. \nThird, in 2016, the OJK also launched its first ever integrated finance sector master plan, 2015\u2013\n2019. The plan consists of 411 actions and programs covering banking, capital market and non- \nbank financial institutions. A coordinating and monitoring framework has been put in place, and \nthe monitoring committee provides regular updates on implementation. As of November 2016, the \nOJK had completed 69 programs and actions including simplification of rules for issuances of \nfinancial products. Fourth, an integrated information-technology-based licensing system was \nimplemented which harmonizes the licensing interface for all intermediaries. \n \n22.  For subprogram 3, the government and the OJK will develop regulations to implement the \nLaw on Financial System Crisis Prevention and Management. The OJK will also continue \nimplementing  the  master  plan  with  regular  reporting.  The  authority  is  also  committed  to \nimplementing a transparent levy system and cross-sector consolidated supervision.   \n \n23.  Output 2: Financial market deepened. This output supports the government\u2019s reforms \nto deepen the financial market by adopting international standards and creating an enabling \nenvironment  for  financial  services  and  products.  There  are  five  major  accomplishments  in \nsubprogram 2. First, the OJK adopted the \u201ccomply or explain\u201d approach to corporate governance \nwith a shift away from prescriptive regulations toward more public financial disclosure. Second, \nthe OJK continued to implement standards of the Islamic Financial Services Board related to \ngovernance and Islamic collective investment schemes. Third, the government prepared the tax \nneutrality  framework  for  Islamic  capital  market  products.  Fourth,  to  create  an  enabling \n                                                \n15 Prior  actions  are  considered  loan  disbursement  conditions  and  policy  milestones  strengthen  the  program. \nComparison of the original and revised subprogram 2 is accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n ", "8 \nenvironment for the financial sector, the OJK strengthened risk management of insurance and \nreinsurance  companies,  including  requiring  higher  capital  provisioning.  Fifth,  the  OJK  also \nprepared a framework for accepting audits on municipal issuances by the Supreme Audit Board \nand accounting guidelines for repo.  \n \n24.  For subprogram 3, the OJK will continue to facilitate the pilot issuance of municipal bonds \nwith the view of having the first issuance by 2019. In Islamic finance, the OJK will continue to \nimplement at least 50% of standards issued by the Islamic Financial Services Board and the \ngovernment will issue regulations on tax neutrality for Islamic capital market products.  \n \n25.  Output 3: Financial inclusion enhanced. This output aims to promote financial inclusion \nthrough improving poor households\u2019 access to financial services and products, financial literacy, \nand consumer protection. There were six major accomplishments in subprogram 2 under this \noutput. First, on improving access of the poor to financial services, the OJK set up the International \nCenter for Microfinance and Financial Inclusion to build industry capacity in microfinance and \nfinancial inclusion. ADB and the center jointly published the Indonesia Microfinance Overview in \n2015, which provides recommendations for expanding financial inclusion and necessary financial \nservices for women residing in poor households. Second, the OJK also expanded the number \nand geographical coverage of branchless banks from 4 to 16 banks, covering 106,490 agents in \n499 cities and/or districts. This reform is particularly relevant to women since it brings the provision \nof financial services closer to their homes. Third, the government established the National Council \nfor Financial Inclusion chaired by the President of Indonesia. The council\u2019s mandate is to address \nimplementation bottlenecks, coordinate financial inclusion initiatives, and monitor and evaluate \nimplementation of the national strategy. The strategy makes specific reference to women and \nmicro and small enterprises. Fourth, on financial literacy, the OJK collaborated with the Ministry \nof Education to publish books targeting students of various levels and those visually impaired. \nFifth, the OJK also implemented a range of financial education initiatives, including focus group \ndiscussions with women, and developed mobile applications on financial literacy to improve \noutreach. Sixth, on consumer protection, the SIPF was expanded to include custodian banks, \nwhich increased the number of protected investors by 165,048 individuals. This complements \nexisting protection for the banking sector through the Deposit Insurance Commission. \n \n26.  For subprogram 3, the OJK will continue to leverage information and communication \ntechnology by developing self-learning e-modules to expand its financial literacy programs. \nAccess of branchless banking will also be expanded and data collection improved to include \ngender data for agents and customers.  \n \nD.    Development Financing Needs \n \n27.  The government has requested a policy-based loan of $400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance subprogram 2. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a \ngrace period of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on this, the \naverage loan maturity is 9.25 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. The \nproceeds of the policy-based loan will be disbursed to Indonesia in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time). \n \n28.  The gross financing need is $48.7 billion, with a budget deficit of 2.4% of gross domestic \nproduct. To finance the deficit, the government planned to raise $44.9 billion from the issuance of \nsecurities and $3.8 billion from official foreign loans. The size of subprogram 2 primarily reflects ", "9 \nthe government\u2019s financing needs, the strength of the reform program, and the development \nexpenditures arising from the program, such as operational costs for the PKSK, implementation \nof best practices for Islamic finance and other institutional reforms, and costs associated with \nfinancial literacy programs (para. 31).  \n \nE.    Implementation Arrangements \n \n29.  The implementation period for subprogram 2 is from July 2015 to March 2017 and \nsubprogram 3 will be implemented from April 2017 to April 2019. The Fiscal Policy Agency in the \nMinistry of Finance is the executing agency while the OJK is the implementing agency. The PKSK \nwill, in coordination with the International Department of the OJK, monitor the implementation of \nthe policy actions under the policy matrix.  \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n30.  Subprogram 2 has attached TA (Promoting Innovative Financial Inclusion) supporting the \ngovernment and the OJK to advance the financial inclusion agenda through three outputs: (i) \nincreased access to finance through innovative approaches, (ii) broadened financial literacy, and \n(iii) enhanced consumer protection.16 Under the TA, a pilot project will be implemented to deepen \nfinancial  inclusion,  complementing  the  government\u2019s  digital  government-to-person  payment \ninitiative. The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, of which $800,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of office space, equipment, staff resources, and other in-\nkind contributions. The Fiscal Policy Agency will be the executing agency and the OJK will be the \nimplementing agency. The implementation period of the TA will be June 2017 to June 2019. \n \nIV. DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n31.  The program impact assessment estimates potential net benefits of the program to be \nabout  $5.9  billion  in  present  value.17 The  benefits  of  financial  inclusion  are  estimated  at \napproximately $3.4 billion, which includes $145 million through higher levels of saving by the poor, \n$2.4 billion through better access to capital for small and medium-sized enterprises and women, \nand efficiency gains of approximately $830 million through the branchless banking initiative. The \ntotal cost to the economy is approximately $913 million. Approximately half of this amount is a \ncost to the industry through the OJK\u2019s levy. This approach shifts the tax burden from taxpayers to \nthe industry and frees up fiscal space in the national budget. Other costs include financial literacy \noutreach programs to women and micro and small enterprises. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n32.  The government has made progress in improving the legal and regulatory framework for \npublic financial management. Since the enactment of laws on state finance, state treasury, and \nstate audit in 2003\u20132004, most regulations for these laws have been promulgated. In 2012, the \nnumber of government agencies that received an unqualified audit opinion from the external audit \nagency increased to 65% (from about 40% in 2009). ADB has reinforced this momentum with \n                                                \n16 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \ncontinuing support to improve technical capacity on state audit. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n33.  Subprogram 2 is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming at entry. One of the key \ncomponents of the program concerns enhancing financial inclusion and ensuring improved \naccess to finance for the poor, unbanked, and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. The \nGlobal Findex data show that a similar percentage of women and men saved at a financial \ninstitution in 2013, and 15% of the total male population and 11% of the total female population \nborrowed from a financial institution. Women entrepreneurs face unique challenges because of \nlimitations in time, mobility, and resources. Hence, there is a need to pay special attention to \nensuring increased access to financial products and services for women entrepreneurs. One of \nthe key gender related targets in subprogram 2 is financial literacy initiatives for women.   \n \nD.    Safeguards \n \n34.  The program does not trigger ADB\u2019s safeguard policies and is classified category C for \nimpacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \nE.    Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n35.  The program faces only one substantial risk, which is lack of coordination for financial \ninclusion reform. The National Council for Financial Inclusion is a critical reform but there is risk \nof slow implementation and stakeholders not extending the fullest cooperation, especially in the \ninitial stages. Mitigation measures include ADB supporting the PKSK and the OJK as key \nagencies in the National Council. The risk assessment for the FMDIP is medium.18  \n \nIV. ASSURANCES \n \n36.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \ndocuments. \n \nV. RECOMMENDATION \n \n37.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan would comply with the Articles of \nagreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan of $400,000,000 to the Republic of Indonesia for subprogram 2 of the Financial Market \nDevelopment and Inclusion Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, \nwith interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; for a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan \nagreement presented to the Board. \n \n                    Takehiko Nakao \nPresident \n6 June 2017 \n                                                \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).
