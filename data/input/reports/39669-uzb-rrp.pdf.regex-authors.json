An  initial  environment  examination  (IEE)  was \nAssessment  undertaken and is summarized in Appendix 14. \n   \nProject Description  The Project aims to develop strategic international highways and \nimprove road sustainability in Uzbekistan. It will have two major \ncomponents:  (i)  road  development,  and  (ii)  road  sector \nsustainability.  \n \nThe road development component will improve 131 kilometers \n(km) of the A-380 highway. International competitive bidding (ICB) \nfor civil works will be applied for the first time. Advisory support for \nproject management, construction supervision, and procurement \nwill be provided to assist the executing agency (EA) in managing, \nimplementing, and supervising the overall Project to meet high \ninternational standards.  \n \nThe road sector sustainability component will primarily assist the \nGovernment in strengthening operation and maintenance of the \nroad network in Uzbekistan including improvement of road sector \ninstitutions, road sector planning and budgeting; and provision of \nroad equipment. Institutional support for road sector planning and \nmanagement  and  advisory  support  for  development  of  a \ncommercially  operated  road  equipment  pool  company  will  be \nprovided. \n   \nRationale  Under  the  Government\u2019s  Road  Development  Program  2007\u2013\n2010,  about  $320  million  has  been  allocated  for  road \nreconstruction  and  $460  million  for  repairs,  focusing  on  the \ndevelopment of strategic international highways. The highways \nare included in the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \n(CAREC) corridors recently agreed among its member countries. \nCAREC  corridors  development  aims  to  enhance  international \ntrade and regional connectivity. Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nfinancing  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  Road  Development \nProgram  2007\u20132010,  will  contribute  to  achieving  the \nGovernment\u2019s  development  objectives,  as  well  as  enhancing \nregional integration and economic growth in the CAREC region. \n \nRoad sector reforms have progressed significantly since 2003. \nReform measures include (i) sector unbundling, (ii) institutional \nreforms,  and  (iii)  promotion  of  competitive  bidding  for  road \nconstruction works. A new road law introducing toll roads and \n ", "ii   \nprivate  sector  participation  in  the  road  sector  was  enacted  in \n2007. Further reform is expected together with the investments in \nthe  Government\u2019s  Road  Development  Program  2007\u20132010. \nSupport for the road sector is justified based on reform progress \nand fits with ADB\u2019s strategy of promoting regional cooperation.  \n \nAdequate road maintenance is essential if the road network and \ninternational and national connectivity are to be sustained. In past \nyears,  insufficient  maintenance  has  lead  to  road  network \ndeterioration.  Addressing  road  sustainability  requires  a  clear \nstrategy  for  road  sector  management  on:  (i)  institution  and \nmanagement,  (ii)  funding,  (iii)  sector  planning,  and \n(iv) governance  and  accountability.  The  Government  has \nprogressed well in ensuring a steady flow of maintenance funds \nby establishing a Road Fund. However, the road maintenance \nbudget for primary roads is currently not sufficient to fully sustain \nthe  roads.  Outsourcing  road  maintenance  through  competitive \nbidding would, to some extent, help reduce maintenance cost. \nThe Road Fund\u2019s capacity in road planning and management will \nbe  improved  to  meet  these  overall  key  principles.  In  addition, \nfinancing  support  of  road  equipment  will  pave  the  way  for \nstrengthening  the  private  sector  and  road  construction \nenterprises.  It  is  a  first  step  toward  fully  private  provision  of \nequipment in a competitive environment.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  main  impact  of  the  Project  is  sustainable  economic \ndevelopment  and  increased  domestic  and  international  trade \nthrough an adequate, efficient, safe, and sustainable road network \nin Uzbekistan and improved regional connectivity. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The total project cost is estimated at $173.5 million equivalent, \nincluding cost of taxes and duties of $22.2 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $75.3 million from the ordinary capital resources of ADB \nwill  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have an amortization \nperiod of 24 years including a grace period of 4 years, an interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.35%  per  annum  of  the \ncumulative undisbursed loan, and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the Loan Agreement. \n \nFinancing Plan \n($ million) \n \nSource  Total        % \nAsian Development Bank   75.3  43 \nGovernment  98.2  57 \n       Total   173.5  100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \n \n ", "           iii     \nAllocation and Relending  The Government will pass on the proceeds of the ADB loan for \nTerms  the procurement of equipment to a road equipment pool company \n(REPC)  and  the  provision  of  consulting  services  for  the \ndevelopment  of  REPC  with  an  additional  spread  of  maximum \n0.2% and on terms and conditions that are otherwise identical to \nthe ADB loan to the Government. The REPC will assume the \nforeign exchange risk. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2012 \n \nEstimated Project  31 December 2011 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Republican Road Fund (the Road Fund) that is under and \naccountable to the Ministry of Finance will be the Project\u2019s EA. It \nis adequately staffed and its financial management capabilities \nare adequate. \n   \nImplementation  A project implementation unit (PIU) under the Road Fund will be \nArrangements  set up and be responsible for implementation of the Project. Two \nstaff  from  the  Road  Fund  will  be  appointed  to  assist  PIU  in \nimplementing the road development component and institutional \nsupport for the road sector planning and management system. A \nstaff from the REPC will be assigned to help PIU implement the \nprocurement  of  road  equipment  and  advisory  support  for \ndevelopment of the REPC.  \n   \nProcurement  Procurement of goods, civil works, and related services financed \nfrom  the  ADB  loan  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \nTo ensure competition, ICB contract packages will be adopted. \nCivil works contracts will be procured through ICB among pre-\nqualified bidders. ICB will be used for civil works over $2 million; \nnational competitive bidding (NCB) for civil works of $100,000\u2013$2 \nmillion; shopping for civil works up to $100,000; and ICB for goods \nover $1 million.  \n \nThe Project involves five ICB contract packages for civil works \nand two ICB packages for goods.  \n   \nConsulting Services  It  is  estimated  that  a  total  of  about  360  person-months  of \nconsultancy  services  (120  person-months  international  and \n240 person-month national) will be needed for: (i) an international \nprocurement specialist, (ii) project management and construction \nsupervision, (iii) advisory support for development of the REPC, \nand (iv) road sector planning and management system. Detailed \nengineering  design  is  being  undertaken  by  locally  recruited \nconsultants and financed from the Road Fund resources.  \n \nAn individual procurement specialist with international experience \nwill be recruited to help implement the procurement of  works, \ngoods, and services. For the remaining services, consulting firms \nwill be selected and engaged using ADB\u2019s quality and cost-based \n ", "iv   \nselection procedures in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use \nof  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Full \ntechnical proposals will be required for the project management \nand construction supervision, and the road sector planning and \nmanagement  system;  and  biodata  technical  proposals  for \ndevelopment of the REPC. \n \n   \nProject Benefits and  Under the road development component, the main benefits will be \nBeneficiaries  vehicle operating cost and accident cost savings, resulting from \nreduced  road  pavement  roughness  and  better  vehicle  running \nconditions.  Potential  project  beneficiaries  will  be  road  users \ncurrently using the existing road, diverted road users from railway \nservices parallel to the A-380 highway, diverted road users from \ninternational traffic currently using the northern route from and to \nKazakhstan and Russian Federation, and generated traffic. This \ncomponent is economically viable, given economic internal rates \nof  return  (EIRRs)  of  17%  (road  section  1)  and  34%  (road \nsection 2). \n \nUnder the road sector sustainability component, the enhanced \nroad sector maintenance capacity is considered over a 10-year \nperiod.  The  with-project  scenario assumes  a  well-planned  and \nmanaged road sector together with better equipped, commercially \noperated road enterprises with the capacity to undertake higher \nlevels of better quality road maintenance. This is compared with \npoor management and planning and ill-equipped road enterprises \nin the without-project case. The incremental costs and benefits \nwere compared and the EIRR for the component was estimated at \n33%, which is economically viable. The investment and operation \nof the road equipment is financially feasible. The financial rate of \nreturn was estimated at 13% which is above the weighted average \ncost of capital of 4.6%. The REPC is expected to meet cash flow \nas  well  as  operating  requirements,  meet  full  debt  service \nobligations, and maintain a minimum 80:20 debt-equity ratio. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  At  the  EA  level,  assumptions  include  the  Road  Fund\u2019s \ncommitment to improve its planning capacity, provide counterpart \nresources and support for the Project in a timely manner, and \nimprove  the  entire  A-380  highway  as  scheduled.  At  the \ngovernment  level,  the  main  assumptions  of  the  Project  are \ncommitment  to  further  reform  the  road  sector,  adopt  good \ngovernance, apply cost recovery principles in investment, invest in \ncross-border  facilities  in  a  timely  manner,  and  sustain  policies \nconducive to economic growth and regional integration. \n \nThe main risks to the Project include start-up delays in project \nimplementation, lack of strict adherence to ADB\u2019s procurement \nguidelines, adverse impacts of the Project, and development of \nthe REPC.  \n \nThe following measures are taken to mitigate the start-up delays \nrisk: (i) recruitment of an international procurement specialist to ", "           v     \nhelp  the  EA  procure  contractors,  suppliers,  and  consultants; \n(ii) recruitment  of  a  professional  with  experience  in  externally \nfunded  projects  as  the  PIU  head;  and  (iii)  finalization  of  the \ndetailed design for the first civil works package using the Road \nFund budget.  \n \nThe  Road  Fund  is  to  announce  the  Project  and  business \nopportunities  associated  with  the  Project,  including  the  tender \nprocess,  on  its  web  page.  To  avoid  adverse  impacts  of  the \nProject, contractors will be required to adopt strict controls over \nworkers\u2019 conduct, and adopt environmental protection and comply \nwith  mitigation  measures.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided \nunder the Project to help the REPC run the services and further \ncommercialize the REPC. \n   \n ", " \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit, for your approval, the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) \nRegional Road Project (the Project). The design and monitoring framework for the Project is in \nAppendix 1.1 \n \nII.   RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.   Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Uzbekistan is a historical land bridge between the east (East Asia) and west (Europe), \nas well as the north (Kazakhstan, Russian Federation, and the Baltic states) and south (Indian \nOcean and Persian Gulf). Uzbekistan can benefit from this role only if the transport network is \nwell developed and maintained. With a population of 26.8 million, it is the most populous country \nin Central Asia with the second largest area. Although largely arid, irrigated areas along the two \nmain rivers make it an important agricultural producer, specializing in cotton, for which it is the \nsecond largest exporter in the world. It is rich in natural resources, including minerals and large \nreserves of natural gas.  \n \n3.  Uzbekistan\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) has been growing at about 7% per year in \n2004\u20132006 after an initial post-independence period of decline. It is predicted that GDP will \nincrease by about 6% annually up to 2020. This growth is expected to increase freight transport \nby about 4.4% and passenger transport by about 5.1% per annum.2  \n \n4.  Efficient  transport  is  important  to  achieve  the  country\u2019s  development  objectives. \nUzbekistan\u2019s  primary  roads,  totaling  42,530  kilometers  (km),  are  divided  into  international \n(3,626 km), national (16,909 km), and regional (local) roads (21,995 km). In addition, there are \nabout 140,000 km of urban and rural roads. In 2005, road transport carried about 85% of \nUzbekistan\u2019s freight in terms of ton-km and 93% of its passengers in terms of passenger-km. \nRoad  traffic  volume  varies  across  road  sections.  Some  major  roads  carry  more  than \n10,000 vehicles per day. Traffic volume grew about 4% per year over 2000\u20132005. \n \n5.  The primary highways, mostly asphalt-paved, are the backbone of the road network in \nUzbekistan. The Republican Road Fund (the Road Fund) under the Ministry of Finance (MOF) \nhas  responsibility  for  financing  reconstruction,  repairs,  and  maintenance  of  the  primary \nhighways. Its budget for road works has increased from about $125 million in 2005 to about \n$184 million in 2007 or by about 20% annually. Table 1 shows that about 39% of the budget \nwas allocated for reconstruction, 42% for repair, and 19% for routine maintenance.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  Preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) was provided to prepare the Project.

The Uzbekistan Transport Sector Strategy (2006\u20132020) (footnote 2) identified broad \nissues for the road sector including: (i) a considerable road rehabilitation and maintenance \nbacklog, (ii) road deterioration, (iii) inadequate number of qualified supervisory personnel for \nnational  road  network  maintenance  services,  (iv)  funding  constraints  to  clear  the  road \nmaintenance backlog, (v) restrictions on the trade of certain internationally traded cargoes, (vi) \nan infant logistics industry, (vii) policy development and regulation of activity of the road sector, \nand (viii) the lack of a medium-term investment plan for the sector. Some of these, such as road \nfunding  and  regulatory  framework,  have  now  been  partly  or  are  being  addressed  by  the \nGovernment. \n \nB.   Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n  \n  1.  Challenges \n \n7.  Road Sector Reforms. There has been significant road sector reform in recent years. \nThe road sector has been transformed from a single state road agency, Uzavtoyul, responsible \nfor policy, planning, funding, construction, and operation and maintenance (O&M) of primary \nroads into a new structure that is much more closely in line with international best practice.   \n \n(i)  The Road Board, chaired by a deputy prime minister, is responsible for policy \nformulation in the road sector.  \n \n(ii)  The  Uzbek  Association  of  Transport  and  Transport  Communications  is \ncoordinating the activities of the transport sector\u2019s main stakeholders. \n \n(iii)  The Road Fund under MOF is responsible for managing and funding primary \nroads, including planning and outsourcing of construction, reconstruction, repairs, \nand maintenance; and project implementation and supervision.  \n \n(iv)  State  joint  stock  company  (SJSC)  Uzavtoyul  is  responsible  for  the  O&M  of \nprimary roads. In these tasks, it is assisted by two of its divisions. One division, \nled by seven core subsidiaries, is responsible for maintenance of international \nand national roads. The other division, led by 13 core subsidiaries with 161 \nancillary subsidiaries, is responsible for maintenance of district roads. In the \nconduct of these O&M tasks, the core Uzavtuyol subsidiaries report to, and are \nfunded  by,  the  Road  Fund.  The  ancillary  subsidiaries,  however,  work  under \nperformance-based contracts.  \n \n ", "      3\n8.  Steps have been taken to stimulate commercialization of Uzavtuyol subsidiaries by \nintroducing  competitive  bidding  for  road  construction,  reconstruction,  and  repairs;  and  the \nrequirement of performance-based contracts for maintenance. However, overall the subsidiaries \nremain closely linked to the Government and the Road Fund. In order to enhance efficiency and \ncompetition in the road sector, the Government should consider further reforms to stimulate \nprivate sector development in the road construction industry. Among the steps to achieve this, \nthe Government should take steps towards making Uzavtuyol subsidiaries legally, financially, \nand managerially independent and towards introducing competitive bidding for maintenance. A \nroad sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n9.  The  Road  Fund\u2019s  capacity  in  planning  and  execution  is  inadequate,  so  it  requires \ninstitutional capacity enhancement and human resources strengthening. Assistance is required \nin database development, maintenance program optimization, and investment strategy.  \n   \n10.  Road Network and Border Crossing. In general, despite a few missing links, the road \nnetwork has good coverage and sufficient capacity to accommodate the moderately growing \ntraffic demand. Most major corridors are dual carriageways and the current volume capacity \nratios  are  relatively  low.  However,  parts  of  the  network  are  in  poor  condition and  require \nrehabilitation. The road quality is deteriorating because of inadequate maintenance. In addition, \npoor signposting and road markings have been observed in some roads, raising road safety \nconcerns.  \n \n11.  The  Government  is  focused  on  the  development  of  the  following  five  international \ncorridors out of 20 corridors (Table 2).  \n \nTable 2:  Primary International Road Corridors \n \n1.

Despite  significant  improvements  in  recent  years,  transit  trade  facilitation  remains \ncomplex and time-consuming, especially for vehicles without Transports Internationaux Routiers \n(TIR)  Carnets.3 The  combination  of  transposing  documentation  at  each  border,  different \ndocumentary requirements, a high percentage of physical examinations of goods, and payment \nof transit and other fees all mean border delays. The Government recognizes these issues and \nis pursuing an investment plan for its trade facilitation and customs cooperation program, and \nfor border post development at key crossings.  \n \n13.  Transit  Traffic.  The  substantial  decline  in  transit  traffic  since  1998  suggests  the \npotential  to  expand  transit  traffic.  The  decline  that  was  common  throughout  Central  Asia \nresulted in a general reduction of international trade. Several factors caused the decline in \n                                                 \n3 The TIR (Transports Internationaux Routiers) system relies on a document known as the \"TIR Carnet\" which is \nprinted and distributed by the Geneva-based International Road Transport Union for issue to the carnet users by \nthe  national  guarantee  associations  which  are  authorized  for  this  purpose  by  the  contracting  parties\u2019 \nadministrations. \n ", "4   \ntransit  traffic:  poorly  maintained  infrastructure,  high  transit  fees,  security  concerns,  and \ncompeting international corridors.  \n \n14.  There  is  international  competition  for  transit  traffic.  The  Niznhy  Pianj\u2013Dushanbe\u2013\nSarytash\u2013Osh\u2013Bishkek\u2013Almaty corridor could compete in future with the Dushanbe\u2013Termez\u2013\nTashkent\u2013Almaty corridor. Improvement of the Osh\u2013Bishkek route has already reduced the \nneed for Kyrgyz traffic to transit Uzbekistan, even in winter. \n \n15.  A key factor in the economics of a corridor is the level of transit fees. With over 80% of \ntransit traffic being carried in Turkish and Iranian trucks, substantial revenue is generated from \nforeign transporters. There has been a decline of around 60% in the number of transiting trucks. \nWhile this is partly due to economic changes, with Kazakhstan for example sourcing more traffic \nvia the Russian Federation, transporters consider high transit fees to have been a factor and \nthere is a need to reconsider and rationalize them. The transit fees issues will be addressed in \nnew international transport law and new transit law under preparation by the Government. \n \n16.  Road  Maintenance.  Although  the  budget  allocated  for  routine  maintenance  has \nincreased  13%  annually,  it  currently  remains  inadequate.  The  current  yearly  routine \nmaintenance budget of less than $1,000/km is approximately only half of the road maintenance \ncost standard of $2,200/km.4 The Road Fund, however, has been committed to increasing the \nmaintenance budget under the Government\u2019s Road Development Program 2007\u20132010.   \n \n17.  A weakness of the Road Fund financing is that about 80% of the sources of funds are \nnot directly related to the use of the network. On the other hand, fuel levy (about 60\u201370% of \nother countries\u2019 road user charges)5 is not included in the Road Fund\u2019s sources of funds. \nRevisiting the operations of the Road Fund and examining the effectiveness of the current \noperating, financing, and quality control procedures would be timely.  \n \n18.  In addition, a systematic approach to prioritizing road maintenance interventions and \ndevelopment  planning  would  help  the  Road  Fund  better  assess  the  real  need  for  road \nmaintenance and development. Regular road condition and traffic surveys are urgently required. \nComprehensive data is crucial to quantify the extent of the maintenance backlog and develop a \nprioritized remedial maintenance program.  \n \n19.  Road Construction Industry. Under current road management arrangements, the road \nconstruction market for primary roads that are open for bidding is limited to reconstruction and \nrepairs. With seven state-owned enterprises under Uzavtoyul specializing in construction and \nmaintenance of international and national roads, and 161 smaller regionally-based state-owned \nenterprises, coupled with limited market opportunities, private contractors have been limited. \nHowever, the number of private contractors awarded construction and repair works by the Road \nFund has increased in the last two years.   \n \n20.  A distinction should be made between Uzavtoyul and the 13 provincially-based core \nsubsidiaries, and the rest of the Uzavtoyul subsidiaries. Uzavtoyul and the 13 provincially-based \ncore  subsidiaries  have  government-like  functions,  such  as  road  data  collection  and \nprogramming, with less business activities. On the other hand, the seven international and \nnational roads subsidiaries and the 161  provincially-based ancillary subsidiaries mainly operate \nas business entities.  \n                                                 \n4  M. Benmamaar. 2005. Transport Notes TRN-4. Why Road Maintenance is Important and How to Get it Done. \nWashington, DC: World Bank. \n5  Burningham, S. and Stankevich, N. 2006.

Sub-Saharan Africa Transport Policy \nProgram.  \n ", "      5\n   \n21.  These latter Uzavtoyul subsidiaries provide an excellent foundation for the development \nof the road construction and maintenance private sector through continued commercialization, \nleading  to  privatization.  There  is  a  need  to  further  promote  competition  among  Uzavtoyul \nsubsidiaries,  and  strengthen  their  capacity  with  access  to  necessary  construction  and \nmaintenance equipment, to be better equipped for future opportunities in international as well as \nnational projects. Following the Government\u2019s policy to privatize state-owned enterprises, it is \nenvisaged these Uzavtoyul subsidiaries will also be gradually spun off from Uzavtoyul as private \ncontractors. \n \n22.  Road  Safety. The number of road accidents is reported at about 10,000 per year, \nresulting in about 2,000 fatalities. At about 15.4 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles, this rate is very \nhigh by developed countries\u2019 standards but low for developing countries. Responsibilities for \nroad safety, split between several agencies, are defined in the Law on Road Safety, 1999. The \nMinistry of Internal Affairs is the leading agency responsible, through the State Traffic Police, for \nthe development of safety standards, rules, and regulations; traffic management, surveillance, \nand enforcement; vehicle inspection; and accident data collection and analysis. The Uzbek \nAgency for Road and River Transport is responsible for vehicle certification and developing \nrelevant regulations. Uzavtoyul is responsible for ensuring that road design complies with the \nroad safety design standard.  \n \n23.  On some roads, road signs are inadequate and road marking is poor. Overtaking and \nspeeding are common because of the relatively low traffic volume. Implementation of speed \nlimits could be improved.    \n \n24.  Despite the fact that accident data is not publicly disclosed, the Government has made a \ncoordinated effort for improving road safety. A Road Safety Commission has been set up under \nthe Cabinet of Ministers. A road safety plan is being implemented, including a safety awareness \nprogram and education for students. Finally, accident data and black spots are analyzed and \ncommunicated with Uzavtoyul.   \n \n2.   Opportunities \n \n25.  Road Development. Under the Government\u2019s Road Development Program 2007\u20132010, \nabout $300 million has been allocated for road reconstruction. It will focus on the development \nof the following international highways: M-34, M-39, A-378, A-380, M-37, Tashkent Ring Road, \nand Gulistan\u2013Angren. Improving these international road corridors, road-related facilities, and \nother trade and transport facilitation measures (including streamlining of procedures at borders) \nwill facilitate passenger and cargo movement and is expected to increase domestic and regional \ntrade.  \n \n26.  Most  of  those  international  highways  are  included  in  CAREC  corridors  2 \n(Mediterranean\u2013East Asia), 3 (Russian Federation\u2013Middle East and South Asia), 5 (East Asia\u2013 \nMiddle East and South Asia), and 6 (Europe\u2013Middle East and South Asia) recently agreed \namong its member countries (para. 41). CAREC corridors are important for international trade \nand regional connectivity. \n \n27.  ADB financing to support the Government\u2019s Road Development Program 2007\u20132010 will \ncontribute not only to achieving the Government\u2019s development objectives, but also enhancing \nregional connectivity and integration\u2014contributing to economic growth in the CAREC region. \n \n \n ", "6   \n28.  Road  Sector  Sustainability.  Adequate  road  maintenance  is  essential  if  the  road \nnetwork and international and national connectivity is to be sustained. In past years, insufficient \nmaintenance has led to deterioration of the road network. Postponing road maintenance results \nin high direct and indirect costs. Addressing road sustainability requires a clear strategy for road \nsector management that attends to the following key principles: (i) improvement of road network \nplanning; (ii) clear ownership of roads and responsibilities of sector institutions; (iii) involvement \nof  road  stakeholders  in  the  planning  and  operations  of  roads;  (iv)  accurate  costing  of \ndevelopment and maintenance priorities; (v) development standards for improving roads; (vi) a \ncomprehensive  maintenance  program,  including  road  related  facilities;  and  (vii)  sufficient \ncapacity  in  funding,  managing,  and  supervising  road  maintenance.  Road  sustainability, \ntherefore,  needs  reforms  in  the  financing,  institutional  setup,  and  management  of  road \nmaintenance with the active participation of direct and indirect users.     \n \n29.  The Government has a clear road sector reform program to be implemented in 2007\u2013\n2010 (para. 38). A new road law, approved by parliament and the senate in 2007, will provide a \nlegal basis for introducing toll roads and private sector participations in road operations. It also \nclearly distinguishes road ownership and responsibilities of road sector institutions, including \ndistrict governments. These show the Government\u2019s serious commitment to improving the road \nsector. However, only successful implementation of the new law will guarantee the targeted \noutcomes. \n  \n30.  The Government has progressed well in ensuring a steady flow of maintenance funds by \nestablishing the Road Fund. However, the road maintenance budget for primary roads needs to \nbe increased to sustain the roads. Outsourcing road maintenance through competitive bidding \nwould help reduce maintenance cost (footnote 4). The Road Fund\u2019s capacity in road planning \nand management can be improved to meet the overall key principles above with targeted \nadvisory support.  \n \n31.  In addition, making road equipment available can pave the way for strengthening the \nprivate sector and road construction enterprises. It is a first step toward fully private provision of \nequipment in a competitive environment. Many private equipment pool companies operate \nsuccessfully in industrialized and semi-industrialized countries.6 \n \nC.  External Assistance and Lessons Learned \n \n32.  ADB  is  the  lead  agency  in  the  transport  sector,  customs  cooperation,  and  trade \nfacilitation activities of CAREC, of which Uzbekistan is a member. ADB, the European Bank for \nReconstruction and Development, and the governments of Germany and Japan have been \nfocusing their assistance on the railway sector in Uzbekistan while the World Bank focused on \nthe urban transport sector.  \n \n33.  A number of studies were completed or are being undertaken through ADB regional \ntechnical assistance (TA).7 In the road sector, ADB had financed a TA8 and approved a loan9 \nthat was later cancelled by the Government because (i) the road section identified under the \n                                                 \n6  J.

Since  the  cancellation  of  the  loan,  the  then  envisaged  road  sector  reforms  have \nprogressed significantly. Reform measures include (i) sector unbundling by separating road \ntransport  operation  and  road  construction;  (ii)  institutional  reform  by  creating  the  Uzbek \nAssociation of Transport and Transport Communications, the Road Board, and the Road Fund, \nand by restructuring Uzavtoyul; and (iii) promotion of competitive bidding for road construction \nworks, many of which are recommendations of Institutional Strengthening and Policy Support \nfor the Road Sector (footnote 8). Support for the road sector is justified based on reform \nprogress in this sector and fit with ADB strategy to promote regional cooperation. Further \nreassurance for ADB includes (i) the objectives outlined under the Government\u2019s transport \nsector policy (para. 36); (ii) the completed Uzbekistan Transport Sector Strategy (2006-2020)10 \nwhich was strongly supported by the Government; and (iii) the committed road sector reform \n(para. 38) and solid investment pipeline developed under the Government\u2019s Road Development \nProgram 2007\u20132010. \n \n35.  The 2006 ADB country assistance program evaluation for Uzbekistan evaluated the \noverall program \u201csatisfactory\u201d based on the criteria of relevance and efficacy.11 It classifies \ntransport  sector  projects  \u201cgenerally  satisfactory\u201d  and  noted  good  progress  in  the  transport \nsector. However, several issues remain. The proposed Project, therefore, will address relevant \nissues identified in the country assistance program evaluation\u2014including project focus, financial \nsustainability, inefficient practices of government agencies, the lacking link between policies and \npractice, and project implementation. Financial sustainability is also key to the success of road \nprojects.12    \n \nD.  Transport Sector Strategy \n \n36.  Government Strategy. The Government\u2019s Concept of Development of Transport and \nCommunications in Uzbekistan to 2015 outlines transport sector development objectives and \nstrategic  directions.  The  concept  underscores  the  importance  of  international  traffic,  and \nsuggests upgrading and maintaining the main highways to meet international standards. It also \nhighlights the need for improving road transit and trade facilitation, including development of \ncommon approaches to tariff and customs policy. The nonphysical obstacles to passenger and \nfreight traffic by way of roads should be removed. Technical equipment at border crossings \nshould be improved to facilitate efficient border-crossing procedures. The aim is to enhance \ntrade between Uzbekistan and its trading partners. \n \n37.  The Government strongly supported the transport sector strategy prepared under the \nTransport Sector Strategy (2006\u20132010) (footnote 10). The strategy provides strategic direction \nand  an  investment  plan  for  the  transport  sector,  including  roads.  It  elaborates  the  policy \ndirection  outlined  in  the  transport  development  concept  and  takes  into  account  the \nGovernment\u2019s  comprehensive  investment  program  for  improving  the  road  network.  The \ninvestment plan comprises (i) improvement or rehabilitation of the existing major roads; (ii) new \nconstruction and major upgrading of the existing major roads; and (iii) implementation of road \nsafety measures, especially on domestic sections of international routes.  \n \n38.  Further reform in the road sector was recently announced and includes: (i) organization \nof  construction  and  reconstruction  of  primary  highways,  (ii)  development  of  modern  road \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2005.

ADB Strategy. The Project is fully in line with ADB\u2019s country and regional strategies. \nADB\u2019s future role in the transport sector, as outlined in Uzbekistan\u2019s ADB country strategy and \nprogram 2006\u2013201014 will focus on (i) developing a reliable existing infrastructure network that \nopens up regional and international markets; (ii) integrating transport systems for improved \nsafety and service quality; (iii) harmonizing the regulatory framework to promote efficiency; (iv) \nrestructuring and modernizing the transport sector by promoting competition; (v) competitive \nmarketing  and  tariff  setting;  and  (vi)  improving  financing  and  management  efficiency  and \neffectiveness.  \n \n40.  The  strategic  direction  envisaged  under  the  Uzbekistan  Transport  Sector  Strategy \n(2006-2020) (footnote 2) focuses on developing international corridors that will serve all users \nand attract transit traffic. The priority so far has been on the development of the east\u2013west \ncorridor. The opening up of Afghanistan offers opportunities in the medium-to-longer term for \ndevelopment of transit corridors between Central Asia and the warm-water ports in Iran and \nPakistan. \n \n41.  The CAREC Transport Sector Strategy for 2008\u20132018 prepared under ADB assistance \nand endorsed during the Ministerial Meeting on 3 November 2007 has three overarching goals: \n(i) establishing competitive transport corridors across the CAREC region; (ii) facilitating efficient \nmovement  of  people  and  goods  across  borders;  and  (iii) developing  safe,  people-friendly \ntransport systems that are environmentally friendly. The strategy also identified six strategic \ncorridors for full completion by 2018.15   \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.   Impact and Outcome \n \n42.  The Project will support an adequate, efficient, safe, and sustainable road network in \nUzbekistan that provides domestic and regional connectivity which will contribute to sustainable \neconomic development and increased domestic and international trade.  \n \nB.   Outputs \n \n43.  The output of the Project will be (i) 131 km of reconstructed highway sections of the      \nA-380:  Guzar\u2013Bukhara\u2013Nukus\u2013Dautata  (Uzbekistan  and  Kazakhstan  border);  and  (ii) \nstrengthened road sector institutions and road network management capacity.  \n \n44.  The Project will have two major components: (i) a road development component, and  \n(ii) a road sector sustainability component.  \n \n45.  Road Development Component. ADB will finance reconstruction of the A-380 highway, \nwhich is the main route between the northwest and southeast of Uzbekistan and serves as an \nincreasingly important international corridor between Afghanistan (via Termez), Tajikistan, and \nTurkmenistan, and Kazakhstan and Russian Federation. The A-380 highway is designated \n                                                 \n13 Resolution of the President of Uzbekistan PP-535 (20 December 2006): On Measures for Development of \nCommon Use Roads in 2007\u20132010. \n14 ADB. 2006.

The adjoining 84 km Kazakhstan section \nUzbekistan  Border\u2013Beyneu  is  included  in  the  2009\u20132010  Kazakhstan  Road  Sector \nDevelopment Program for reconstruction. Reconstruction of the Beyneu\u2013Aktau (Caspian Sea) \nand Beyneu\u2013Russian Federation border sections is also in the program for completion by 2011. \nThe A-380 highway is part of CAREC 6 that is considered high priority for completion by 2012 \n(footnote 15). \n \n46.  The  pavement  condition  of  the  A-380  highway  Guzar\u2013Bukhara\u2013Nukus\u2013Dautata \n(Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan Border) has deteriorated because of deferred maintenance and an \nincrease in traffic. With the existing traffic of about 5,500 passenger car equivalent per day in \nthe Khorezm section, the A-380 highway traffic is expected to reach 13,000 passenger car \nequivalent per day in 2020. Reconstruction of this international road is technically justified. Out \nof 1,204 km of the A-380 highway, 211 km will be reconstructed and 700 km will be repaired \nduring 2007\u20132010; the remaining road sections need adequate routine maintenance. ADB\u2019s \ninvestment  in  reconstruction  of  the  A-380  highway  will  help  the  Government  accelerate \ncompletion of the overall program and introduce international best practice. \n \n47.  Civil  works  under  this  component  will  comprise  reconstruction  of  131  km  of  the \nA380 highway  in  the  Republic  of  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm  Province  to  meet  two-lane \ninternational design standard with a four-lane roadbed within the existing right-of-way. The \nProject will not involve land acquisition and resettlement nor create significant environmental \nimpacts. The sections of the project road are as follows: \n \n(i)  Section  1:  km876\u2013916  (40  km)  in  Kungrad  District  of  the  Republic  of \nKarakalpakstan. \n(ii)  Section 2: km490\u2013581 (91 km) in Khazarsp District of Khorezm Province and \nTortkul District of the Republic of Karakalpakstan. \n \n48.  The Government will, for the first time, adopt international competitive bidding (ICB) for \nroadworks. Advisory support for procurement of contractors and recruitment of consultants will \nbe provided. An international procurement consultant will assist the executing agency (EA) to \nstrengthen  its  procurement  capability.  Advisory  support  for  project  management  and \nconstruction supervision will also be provided to assist the EA in managing, implementing, and \nsupervising the overall Project to meet high international standards. \n \n49.  Road  Sector  Sustainability  Component.  This  component  will  primarily  assist  the \nGovernment to strengthen road sector sustainability in Uzbekistan through improvement of road \nsector  institutions,  the  introduction  of  competition  in  road  maintenance  leading  to  further \ncommercialization  of  enterprises  and  eventually  privatization,  road  sector  planning,  and \nbudgeting  system;  and  provision  of  road  equipment  to  ensure  timely  and  effective  road \nmaintenance program. This component will partly support the road sector reforms (para. 38) \nand will involve the following activities: \n \n(i)  Institutional support for road sector planning and management system. \nThis subcomponent will provide advisory support to improve the Government\u2019s \ncurrent road sector planning and road sector financing systems and will focus on \nthe promotion of road user charges and tolling systems, the introduction of a \ncomputerized road network data base system and road sector planning and \nmanagement systems, and the preparation of a time-bound program to roll out \nthese systems for countrywide application. This subcomponent will also provide \nadvisory support to rationalize road sector institutions and road enterprises, and \npromote competition in roadworks. It will train dedicated EA staff to build capacity \n ", "10   \nin road sector planning and management. At the end of the Project, a planning \nunit will have been fully established at the Road Fund. \n \n(ii)  Provision  of  road  equipment.  The  Government  will  establish  the  road \nequipment  pool  company  (REPC)  and  this  subcomponent  will  assist  the \nGovernment with the development of the REPC and finance the procurement of \nroad equipment for the REPC.16 The immediate objective of the REPC will be to \nprovide services using its road equipment to road construction and maintenance \nenterprises  on  a  full  cost  recovery  basis.  Advisory  support  under  this \nsubcomponent will include development of business and marketing plans; an \nequipment service charge system; and proper administrative, accounting, and \nfinancial  procedures.  The  subcomponent  will  also  study  the  feasibility  of \nprivatizing the REPC in the longer term. \n \nC.   Project Investment Plan  \n \n50.  The project investment cost is estimated at $173.5 million equivalent, including taxes \nand duties of $22.2 million. A summary of the project investment plan is in Table 3. Detailed \ncost estimates by financiers for the Project are in Appendix 3. \n \nTable 3: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n \n \nItem  Amountsa \nA. Base Cost   \n1.

The  Government  will  provide  the  remaining  project  costs  of \n$98.2 million to finance taxes and duties, and part of the civil works and contingencies. \n \n                                                 \n16 This is in line with the Transport Sector Strategy, which recommended the establishment of an Equipment \nManagement and Utilization Organization providing construction equipment to road companies as a means of \nenhancing their operational capacity and hence ability to compete on a broader market front. \n ", "      11\nTable 4: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nSource  Total        % \nAsian Development Bank   75.3  43 \nGovernment  98.2  57 \n       Total   173.5  100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n52.  ADB will provide a loan of $75.3 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help \nfinance the Project. The loan will have an amortization period of 24 years, including a grace \nperiod of 4 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, and a commitment charge of 0.35% of the loan per \nannum. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB. \n \n53.  The Government will relend the proceeds of the ADB loan of $55.31 million for the \nprovision of equipment to the REPC and the advisory support for the development of REPC with \nan additional spread of maximum 0.2% and on terms and conditions that are otherwise identical \nto the ADB loan to the Government. The REPC will assume the foreign exchange risk. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n54.  The Road Fund that is under and accountable to MOF will be the EA for the Project. It is \nadequately staffed and its financial management was found to be acceptable. Within the Road \nFund, a project implementation unit (PIU) will be set up and established. The PIU will have \noverall responsibility for project implementation. A PIU head will be a professional qualified in \nproject management, with experience in project management and civil works acceptable to \nADB. The Road Fund will ensure that, during the entire period of project implementation, the \nPIU  is  adequately  staffed  with  sufficient  experience  in engineering,  financial, procurement, \nadministrative, and secretarial staff; and equipped with the necessary office space, equipment, \nand facilities.  \n \n55.  The PIU will be responsible for implementation of the overall Project. The head of the \nRoad Fund\u2019s Technical Construction Division will be appointed to assist the PIU in implementing \nthe  road  development  component.  The  head  of  the  Road  Fund\u2019s  Program  and  Road \nConstruction Development Division will be assigned to assist the PIU in implementing the \ninstitutional support for the road sector planning and management system. A staff from the \nREPC will be assigned to help PIU implement the procurement of road equipment and advisory \nsupport for development of the REPC. The proposed organizational structure is in Appendix 4.  \n \n56.  The PIU will oversee all activities under the Project, including project preparation and \nimplementation, as well as monitoring and reporting. The Road Fund will introduce a suitable \nmanagement information system in the PIU to manage the Project, including REPC-related \nactivities. The proposed arrangements and fund flow for the road development component and \nprocurement and operation of road equipment are in Appendix 5.  \n \n57.  The PIU will prepare progress reports and will submit them to the EA and ADB every \nquarter. It will also submit other required performance and monitoring reports twice a year. \n ", "12   \nOverall progress and compliance with conditions of the Loan Agreement will be monitored \nregularly  with  periodic  reports  to  ADB,  consistent  with  existing  project  implementation \nrequirements.  Reports  will  include  evaluation  of  issues  or  problems  and  will  recommend \nremedial actions.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n58.  The Project will be implemented over 4 years, inclusive of procurement and construction \nactivities, and is expected to be completed by 31 December 2011. The implementation schedule \nis in Appendix 6. \n \n3.  Procurement  \n59.  Procurement of goods, civil works, and related services financed from the ADB loan will \nbe done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). To ensure competition, ICB contract packages will be adopted. Civil works contracts will \nbe procured through ICB among pre-qualified bidders. ICB will be used for civil works over $2 \nmillion; national competitive bidding (NCB) for civil works of $100,000\u2013$2 million; shopping for \ncivil works up to $100,000; and ICB for goods over $1 million. The Government agreed to \ninclude the relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) in all \nbidding and contractual documents.  \n \n60.  There is no NCB procurement envisaged under this project. However, should there be a \nneed  for  NCB  procurement  during  project  implementation,  before  commencement  of  NCB \nprocurement, ADB and the Government will review the Government\u2019s procurement procedures \nto ensure consistency with ADB requirements. Any necessary modifications or clarifications to \nthe Government\u2019s procedures will be reflected in the procurement plan. \n \n61.  The  Project  involves  five  ICB  contract  packages  for  road  civil  works  and  two  ICB \npackages for goods. The procurement plan for contractors and consultants is in Appendix 7. \n \n  4.   Consulting Services \n \n62.  It is estimated that a total of about 360 person-months of consultancy services will be \nneeded (120 person-months international and 240 person-months national). About 57 person-\nmonths of international consultants and about 175 person-months of national consultants will be \nrequired for design review, and supervising construction of five civil works packages. A further \n5 person-months of international and 14 person-months of national consultants will be required \nfor providing support for development of the REPC. About 46 person-months of international \nand 51 person-months of national consultants will be required to assist the Road Fund in \ndeveloping a road sector planning and management system, and conducting studies on road \nfinancing and institutions.   \n \n63.  Detailed engineering design is being undertaken by locally recruited consultants and \nfinanced from the Road Fund resources. The Road Fund will also engage 12 person-months of \nan international procurement specialist with experience in externally funded projects to help \nimplement the procurement of works, goods, and services. An individual consultant will be \nselected and engaged in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time) and the procurement plan agreed with ADB. \n \n64.  Consulting firms will be selected and engaged using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based \nselection procedures in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and the \nprocurement  plan  agreed  with  ADB.  Full  technical  proposals  will  be  required  for  project \n ", "      13\nmanagement  and  construction  supervision  and  the  road  sector  planning  and  management \nsystem; and bio-data technical proposals for the development of the REPC. The outline of terms \nof reference for consultants to be recruited under the Project is in Appendix 8. \n \n5.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n \n65.  The Government has proposed the provision of an international procurement specialist, \nconsulting  services  for  the  development  of  REPC,  and  recurrent  costs  to  be  financed \nretroactively. It has been advised that the recruitment of consulting services will be subject to \ndue diligence by ADB.  \n \n66.  ADB Management has (i) approved advance action for procuring civil works and goods, \nand (ii) agreed to request Board approval for retroactive financing of up to 20% of the loan \namount  provided  that  expenditures  are  in  accordance  with  agreed  procedures  and  were \nincurred during the 12 months before the signing of the Loan Agreement. The Road Fund has \nbeen informed that approval of advanced contracting and retroactive financing does not commit \nADB to finance the Project. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n67.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the Government and \nthe  Road  Fund.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Projects. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the PIU, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n68.  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Direct payment procedures will generally be \nused for large civil works contracts and consulting services. The Road Fund will establish an \nimprest account at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB, with an initial advance equivalent to \nestimated eligible project expenditures for the next 6 months which are to be paid through the \nimprest account or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is less. The imprest account will be \nestablished, managed, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \nand detailed arrangements agreed by the Government and ADB. The statement of expenditure \n(SOE) procedure will be used to reimburse eligible expenditure and to liquidate and replenish \nthe imprest account for individual payments of $100,000 and below. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n69.  The Road Fund shall (i) maintain separate accounts for the Project and the REPC; (ii) \nhave  such  accounts  audited  annually,  in  accordance  with  appropriate  auditing  standards \nconsistently applied by independent auditors whose qualifications, experience, and terms of \nreference are acceptable to ADB; (iii) furnish to ADB as soon as available but in any event not \nlater than 6 months after the end of each related fiscal year, certified copies of such audited \nproject accounts and audited financial statements and the report of the auditors relating thereto \n(including the auditors\u2019 separate opinions on the use of the loan proceeds and compliance with \nthe financial covenants of this Loan Agreement as well as on the use of the procedures for the \n ", "14   \nimprest account and SOEs, all in the English language; and (iv) furnish to ADB such other \ninformation concerning such accounts and financial statements and the audit thereof as ADB \nshall  from  time  to  time  reasonably  request.  The  independent  auditors  will  be  engaged  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and will be financed under the \nloan. Audited financial statements should be prepared in conformity with sound accounting \nstandards acceptable to ADB. \n \n  9.  Project Performance and Monitoring Report \n \n70.  The Road Fund, assisted by the consultants for project management and construction \nsupervision, will establish a project performance monitoring system within 6 months from project \ncommencement and collect baseline data for performance monitoring. The key indicators and \nassumptions outlined at the impact and outcome levels in the Project\u2019s design and monitoring \nframework will be the primary data required for analysis. \n \n10.  Project Review  \n71.  ADB will field an inception mission within 3 months of loan approval. The ADB mission \nwill review project implementation, including procurement, civil works, and environmental and \nsocial safeguards based on quarterly progress reports. It will meet with the Government and the \nRoad Fund semiannually to discuss implementation progress. A midterm review will be carried \nout 2 years after the loan becomes effective. This will focus on the engineering, environmental, \nand  social  safeguards  of  the  Project;  compliance  with  loan  covenants;  and  review  of  the \nfinancial status of the PIU. Representatives of ADB, the Road Fund, and the REPC will take part \nin the review. The midterm review will evaluate compliance with warranties and representations \nof the Loan Agreement and assurances. The review will allow for any necessary midcourse \ncorrections to ensure successful implementation and the achievement of objectives. A project \ncompletion report will be submitted within 3 months of completion of the Project. \n \nIV.  BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Project Benefits  \n \n1.   Economic Benefits \n \n72.  Economic  sector  analysis  was  carried  out  separately  for  the  road  development \ncomponent and the road sector sustainability component. The methodology, key assumptions, \nand  results  are  summarized  in  Appendix  9.  The  main  benefits  of  the  road  development \ncomponent will be vehicle operating cost (VOC) and road accident cost savings resulting from \nthe  reduced  road  roughness  and  better  vehicle  running  conditions.  The  potential  project \nbeneficiaries will be road users currently using the existing road, diverted road users from the \nrailway services parallel to the road, diverted road users from international traffic currently using \nthe northern route from and to Kazakhstan and Russian Federation. The economic internal rate \nof return (EIRR) is estimated at 17% for road section 1 and 34% for road section 2. This \ncomponent is economically viable.  \n \n73.  Under the road sector sustainability component, the enhanced road sector maintenance \ncapacity is considered over a 10-year period. The with-project scenario assumes a well-planned \nand  managed  road  sector  together  with  better  equipped,  commercially  operated  road \nenterprises with the capacity to undertake higher levels of better quality road maintenance. This \nis compared with poor management and planning and ill-equipped road enterprises in the \nwithout-project case. The net (incremental) benefit would be the VOC savings, time value \nsavings, and accident savings between with-project and without-project scenarios. Under the \n ", "      15\nwithout-project case, average road roughness will be higher than that of the with-project case \nbecause of lower levels of quality of road network maintenance. The higher average road \nroughness will result in higher VOC, average travel time, and accident rates. The incremental \ncosts and benefits were compared and the EIRR for the component was estimated at 33%, \nwhich is economically viable. \n \n  2.   Financial Sustainability  \n \n74.  Financial projections were prepared for the REPC, including projected operating and \nfinancial  ratios  in  nominal  terms.  O&M  and  replacement  costs  were  considered.  Average \nequipment hire charge was estimated on a full cost recovery basis with a rate of return on \nassets of at least 15%. On this basis, the financial internal rate of return is estimated at 13% \nwhich  is  above  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  4.6%.  Sensitivity  analyses  were \nundertaken and found acceptable switching values for increases in capital and O&M costs, \nimplementation delay, and decrease in revenue. The REPC is expected to meet cash flow and \noperating requirements, meet full debt service obligations, and maintain a minimum 80:20 debt-\nequity ratio. The REPC should be financially sustainable and should be able to repay the loan to \nthe Government. Summary financial analysis for the investment and operation of the road \nequipment is in Appendix 10 and financial projections for the REPC are in Appendix 11. \n \n  3.   Financial Management \n \n75.  Using financial management assessment questionnaires and field interviews, financial \nmanagement assessments were undertaken for the Road Fund to evaluate their ability to \nundertake and fulfill ADB\u2019s fiduciary requirements for the project components. The Road Fund\u2019s \nfinancial management was found to be acceptable. The road sector sustainability component \nrequires establishment and development of a road equipment company. To minimize risks \nassociated with  the  new  entity,  detailed  business  and  financial  management  plans  will  be \ndeveloped. The proposed Project includes consultant services to facilitate the development and \ncommercial operations of the REPC. Summary financial management analysis is in Appendix \n12 and full financial management analysis is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n4.   Social Dimensions and Poverty Reduction  \n \n76.        The fieldwork and social analysis for the Project were part of project preparatory TA \n(footnote  1).  Consultation  was  conducted  in  July  2007  with  stakeholders,  including  local \npopulation and pastoral nomads; the Road Fund, the Project\u2019s EA; and district government \nofficials.  \n \n77.  The Project covers two road sections located in the Republic of Karakalpakstan and \nKhorezm Province. Both regions are among provinces in Uzbekistan with the highest poverty \nincidence.  The  main  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  will  be  road  users  and  the  secondary \nbeneficiaries will be people living along the improved road. The Project will reconstruct existing \nroads within the current right-of-way owned by the Government. It will generate nonquantifiable \neconomic and social benefits. Better roads will likely attract additional economic activity and \ntraffic, thus generating benefits to a wider circle of beneficiaries. Direct benefit of the Project \nincludes employment opportunities in civil works. Construction will create temporary jobs, and \nroutine maintenance will employ unskilled and semiskilled workers. Women will be encouraged \nto work and will be treated equitably.17 The Project will provide better and improved conditions \n                                                 \n17 The absence of comprehensive gender analysis in the infrastructure sector of Uzbekistan in general, and the lack \nof actual and adequate information about traveling conditions for women, complicates the process of developing \nthe gender-related activities. To maximize the project impact on women and men in the transport sector, a gender \n ", "16   \nfor all road users; and better access to health facilities, schools, and markets. Indirect benefits \nwill  include  employment  and  business  opportunities  such  as  restaurants,  vehicle  related \nservices,  and  small  businesses.  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  analysis  is  in \nAppendix 13.  \n \nB.         Project Impacts  \n \n1.         Social Impacts and Involuntary Resettlement   \n \n78.      The Project will entail reconstruction of the existing road within the current right-of-way \nowned by the Government, and is free from settlements. Pavement and shoulder widening will \nremain within the existing right-of-way in all cases. There are neither resettlement issues nor \nland loss in the project area. There will be no land, housing, property or income loss; and no \nnew limitations to the movement of villagers and pastoralists. No archeological site, cemetery, \nor other sociocultural facilities will be affected by the Project. No systemic socioeconomic or \nsociocultural impact on indigenous peoples that would trigger the preparation of indigenous \npeoples\u2019 development plans is foreseen. \n \n79.      Village inhabitants and pastoral nomads are vulnerable, but their vulnerable situations \nare neither directly nor indirectly related with the project road. They are completely dependent \non the shirkats (agricultural cooperatives) and the state for their livelihood. Improved transport \nconditions  may  facilitate  their  excessive  emigration.  Improved  roads  may  also  cause  road \naccidents involving road users and local inhabitants, resulting from vehicle speeding. Project \nroads design has taken into account measures to avoid road accidents.  \n \n2.   Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n80.  The Project has been classified environment category B in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines. The initial environmental examination (IEE) prepared for \nthe  Project  is  consistent  with  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines.   \n \n81.  The  IEE  identifies  that  project  impacts  are  not  significant,  and  most  of  them  are \nconstruction-related, such as elevated dust and noise levels, loss of roadside vegetation, and \ntraffic flow disruption. These impacts are considered temporary and will be addressed through \ncareful implementation of the environmental mitigation and monitoring plan. The Project is not \nanticipated  to  affect  ecologically  sensitive  areas  and  sites  of  archaeological,  cultural,  or \nhistorical significance.    \n \n82.  The contractors shall implement mitigation measures during the construction period. The \nEA, through the PIU, shall be assisted by the construction supervision consultant to (i) ensure \nthat tender and contract documents clearly set out the contractor\u2019s obligations to undertake \nenvironmental  mitigation  measures  identified  in  the  IEE,  (ii)  supervise  and  monitor \nimplementation  of  mitigation  measures  during  construction,  and  (iii)  implement  the \nenvironmental  monitoring  plan  including  reporting  requirements.  To  help  develop  the \nenvironmental management capacity of the Road Fund, a training program on environmental \nassessment and environmental management plan (EMP) implementation shall be undertaken. \nThe summary IEE is in Appendix 14 and the IEE is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n \n__________________________ \nassessment  in  transport/highway  sector  of  Uzbekistan  project  was  formulated.  The  supplementary  financial \nsources from ADB\u2019s Gender and Development Cooperation Fund will be utilized.  \n ", "      17\nC.  Assumptions and Potential Risks \n \n83.  At the EA level, assumptions include the Road Fund\u2019s commitment to improving its \nplanning  capacity,  providing  counterpart  resources  and  support  for  the  Project  in  a  timely \nmanner, and improving the entire A-380 highway as scheduled. At the government level, the \nmain  assumptions  are  the  commitment  to  further  reform  the  road  sector,  adopt  good \ngovernance, apply cost recovery principles in investment, invest in cross-border facilities in a \ntimely manner, and sustain policies conducive to economic growth and regional integration. \n \n84.  The main risks to the Project include start-up delays in project implementation, lack of \nstrict  adherence  to  ADB\u2019s  procurement  guidelines,  adverse  impacts  of  the  Project,  and \nestablishment of the REPC.  \n \n85.  The following measures will be taken to mitigate the start-up delays risk: (i) recruitment \nof an international procurement specialist to help the EA procure contractors, suppliers, and \nconsultants; (ii) recruitment of a professional with experience in externally funded projects as \nthe PIU head; and (iii) finalization of the detailed design for the first civil works package using \nthe Road Fund\u2019s budget. The Road Fund will announce the Project and business opportunities \nassociated with the Project, including the tender process, on its web page. To avoid adverse \nimpacts  of  the  Project,  contractors  will  be  required  to  adopt  strict  controls  over  workers\u2019 \nconduct,18 adopt environmental protection, and comply with mitigation measures. Consulting \nservices will be provided under the Project to help the REPC run the services and further \ncommercialize the REPC. \n  \nV.   ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \nA.

Road Network \n \n1.  The length of the network by type of road and by category is in Table A2.1. Since \nMarch 2006, common use roads or primary roads have been administered and funded by the \nRepublican Road Fund (the Road Fund), under the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and maintained \nby Uzavtoyul\u2019s state-owned enterprises. Responsibility for other roads is split between regional \nand city authorities, and state and other enterprises. Much of the network was constructed to \ngenerous design standards. Most major corridors are dual carriageway. Volume capacity ratios \nare relatively low, with a high proportion of light vehicles. However, some international roads \nhave high traffic flows. \n \nTable A2.1: Road Network \n \nRoad Classification  Length  Proportion \n(km)  (%) \nA.

The  most  important  is  north\u2013south  corridor  road  corridor  (RC)  1:  M39  Chimkent\u2013\nTashkent\u2013Samarkand, M37/M371 to Bukhara and south to the Turkmenistan border at Alat. \nCorridor RC2, although important for domestic traffic, is less so for international/transit traffic. \nAfter the opening in 2000 of the twin tunnels on the A-373 under the Kamchik Pass, most \nFerghana Valley traffic no longer transits northern Tajikistan. International traffic on corridor \nRC3  has  declined  because  of  security  and  other  issues  with  Tajikistan  and  because  of \nrestrictions on traffic to and from Afghanistan (these were removed late 2005). Some sections of \nthe Karshi\u2013Surkhaendarya Valley route are difficult for heavy vehicles. The Bukhara-Karshi link \nis important for traffic through Farap (Turkmenistan) to Dushanbe. Corridor RC4 carries little \ntransit  and  international  traffic  because  of  the  limited  hinterland  on  the  Tajik  side.  It  is \npredominantly used for local trade and for activities relating to mining operations higher up the \nvalley in Tajikistan. \n \nC.   Issues \n \n  1.  Road Condition and Maintenance \n \n4.  Some  sections  of  the  international  corridors  are  in  poor  condition.  Improving  the \ninternational corridors is a Road Fund priority. Work in progress/planned will bring most sections \nup to standard by 2011. International corridors are generally also poor in neighboring countries. \nCorridor development requires international cooperation. \n \n5.  Road maintenance has been underfunded. Many sections of primary roads are in a \ndeteriorated  condition  and  some  may  require  reconstruction.  Expenditure  on  periodic  and \nroutine maintenance is well below that necessary for long-term network sustainability. Non-\ncommon use and some urban roads are particularly at risk: some have no source of funding for \nmaintenance,  as  they  were  previously  under  the  responsibility  of  enterprises  now  closed. \nAlthough ad hoc surveys are made by regional Uzavtoyul offices, there is no network condition \ndatabase for roads or bridges. This is urgently required. Only with comprehensive data can the \nextent  of  the  maintenance  backlog  be  quantified  and  a  prioritized  remedial  maintenance \nprogram be developed.  \n \n6.  The road system is not user friendly: signposting of directions and distances and lane \nmarking  is  poor,  and  pedestrians  are  inadequately  protected.  Some  routes,  e.g.,  Karshi\u2013\nBukhara and Namangan\u2013A-373, are particularly dangerous, with vertical curvature resulting in \nnumerous blind hillcrests on fast sections. These are unmarked, with no warning signs or road \nmarkings to limit overtaking. Inexpensive work here could save lives. Accident data readily \navailable  in  most  countries\u2014the  number  of  fatalities,  serious  and  slight  injuries\u2014was \nunobtainable and the seriousness of the problem is unclear. Attention needs to be given to data \ncollection and analysis to facilitate prioritizing mitigation measures. With low traffic volumes, \nspeeding, even in the centre of urban areas, is a major problem. Speed limits need to be \nreviewed for adequacy, then be more clearly signposted and be enforced.   \n \n  2.   Transit Traffic \n \n7.  The substantial decline in transit traffic since 1998 suggests the potential to expand \ntransit traffic. The decline that was common throughout Central Asia resulted in a general \nreduction of international trade. Political and security problems since 1998 have resulted in \nborder closures or restrictions limiting recovery. The key challenge is to redevelop transit traffic. \n \n8.  It is important for trade security to have access to alternative international corridors. \nOptions to the north are limited, with transit through Kazakhstan unavoidable. If the improved \nsituation in Afghanistan is sustained, further options are available, such as the Termez-Herat to \n ", "Appendix 2  25 \nIslam Qala route for transit to Iran/Turkey bypassing Turkmenistan. The development of links \nthrough corridor RC2 using Irkestan or the Kulna Pass to the Karakorum Highway would reduce \ndependence on Kazakhstan for traffic to the People\u2019s Republic of China via Khorgos. \n \n9.  There is international competition for transit traffic. The Niznhy Pianj\u2013Dushanbe\u2013Osh\u2013\nBishkek\u2013Almaty corridor could in future compete with the Dushambe/Termez\u2013Tashkent\u2013Almaty \ncorridor. Improvement of the Osh\u2013Bishkek route has already reduced the need for Kyrgyz traffic \nto transit Uzbekistan, even in winter. \n \n  3.  Transit Costs \n \n10.  A key factor in the economics of a corridor is the level of transit fees, requiring a balance \nbetween fully recovering the costs occasioned by transiting vehicles and discouraging use of the \ncorridor. Uzbekistan is in a favorable position, with multiple corridors, but alternatives are being \ndeveloped. \n \n11.  Fees for foreign transporters are quite high: $400 for transit, plus $90 for insurance, \nalthough Commonwealth of Independent States transporters have lower preferential rates. With \na market share for Uzbek transporters of only around 25% of international traffic and over 80% \nof transit traffic being carried in Turkish and Iranian trucks, substantial revenue is generated \nfrom foreign transporters. Neighboring countries also have high fees, and the combined fees \nsignificantly increase transport costs in the region. There has been a decline of around 60% in \nthe  number  of  transiting  Turkish  and  Iranian  trucks.  While  this  is  partly  due  to  economic \nchanges,  with  Kazakhstan  for  example  sourcing  more  traffic  via  the  Russian  Federation, \ntransporters consider the high transit fees to have been a factor. There are market pressures on \ntransit fees: transporters will use the most cost-effective routes. \n \n  4.   Border Crossing \n \n12.  Despite significant improvements, transit trade facilitation remains complex and time-\nconsuming, especially for vehicles without Transports Internationaux Routiers (TIR) Carnets.1 \nThe  combination  of  transposing  documentation  at  each  border,  different  documentary \nrequirements, a high percentage of physical examination of goods and payment of transit and \nother  fees  all  mean  border  delays.  Despite  substantial  investment  in  trade  facilitation  and \ncustoms cooperation programs, improvements in border processing over the last 10 years have \nbeen limited. The Customs Office has an investment plan in border post development at key \ncrossings. \n \nD.   Progress on Road Sector Reform \n \n13.  Road sector reform has been progressing significantly since 2003. Reform measures \ninclude (i) sector unbundling by separating road transport operation and road construction;  \n(ii)  institutional  reform  by  creating  the  Uzbek  Association  of  Transport  and  Transport \nCommunications, the Road Board, and the Road Fund, and by restructuring Uzavtoyul; and \n(iii) promotion of competitive bidding for road construction, reconstruction, and repair works.  \n \n14.  Establishment of Uzavtoyul and the Road Fund. The Road Fund, an independent \nstate  financial  institution,  was  established  in  1993  to  ensure  financing  for  the  design, \n                                                 \n1 The TIR (Transports Internationaux Routiers) system relies on a document known as the \"TIR Carnet\" which is \nprinted and distributed by the Geneva-based International Road Transport Union for issue to the carnet users by \nthe  national  guarantee  associations  which  are  authorized  for  this  purpose  by  the  contracting  parties\u2019 \nadministrations. \n \n ", "26  Appendix 2   \nconstruction, reconstruction, repair, and maintenance of common use roads, as well as to \nensure efficient functioning of the road sector. 2  \n \n15.  The Government reorganized the state joint stock company (SJSC) on construction and \noperation of roads to become SJSC Uzavtoyul3 to improve the road construction management \nsystem; further develop modern network of common use roads; reduce redundant management \nstructures;  and  enhance  the  productivity  of  resources  allocated  for  maintenance,  repair, \nreconstruction, and construction of common use roads. The provincial and district-based road \nconstruction organizations were set up under Uzavtoyul. The Road Fund under MOF was set \nup, replacing the previous one. The function of collection and control of funds of the Road Fund \nwas assigned to the State Tax and Customs Committees. \n \n16.  Uzavtoyul was reorganized in 2003, pursuant to presidential decree UP-3292 (2003), to \nensure efficient maintenance, repair, reconstruction, and construction of primary roads.4 The \nRoad Fund\u2019s function was expanded to cover outsourcing of reconstruction and repair works of \ncommon use roads through competitive bidding to ensure effective utilization of government \nfinances and to enhance the efficiency.5 \n \n17.  Outsourcing  of  Road  Works.  To  ensure  quality  control  of  road  construction  and \nmaintenance,  outsourcing  for  reconstruction  and  repair  works  through  competition  was \nintroduced.6 The  Government  also  improved  the  procedure  for  design,  construction,  and \nreconstruction of primary roads; and optimized the Road Fund\u2019s financing.7 Performance-based \ncontracts were used for routine maintenance works. \n \n18.  Quality Control of Road Works. The Government also established a classification of \nrepair and maintenance works for common use roads, and a mechanism for quality control and \nacceptance of roadworks.8 \n \n19.  Restructuring of Uzavtoyul. In 2006, Uzavtoyul was assigned as an authorized agency \nof state administration of primary roads. Specialized enterprises responsible for maintenance of \ninternational  and  national  roads  were  set  up  under  Uzavtoyul.9 Territorial  subsidiary  road \nconstruction  enterprises  under  Uzavtoyul  were  also  reorganized.  Furthermore,  specialized \nmaintenance enterprises to maintain bridge facilities on the primary roads and other specialized \nenterprises were also established.  \n \n                                                 \n2  Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan No. 334 dated 5 July 1997 on establishment of \nthe Road Fund. \n3 Decree of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan UP-3292 dated 19 August 2003 on improvement of the \nmanagement system for construction and operation of common use roads. \n4  Resolution of Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan No. 361 dated 21 August 2003 on issues of activity \norganization of SJSC Uzvatoyul and the Road Fund under MOF. \n5 Decree of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan PP-299 dated 3 March 2006 on measures for strengthening \ncontrol over volumes and quality of road construction works and approval of the roads construction program in \n2006. \n6  Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan No. 266 dated 1 January 2006 on \nimprovement of organization and assurance of quality control in construction and operation of common use roads. \n7  Resolution of the Republic of Uzbekistan PP-499 dated 25 October 2006 on measures for improvement of the \nprocedure for design, construction, and reconstruction of common use roads. \n8  Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan No. 266 dated 1 January 2006 on \nimprovement of organization and assurance of quality control in construction and operation of common use roads.  \n9  Resolution of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan No. 511 dated 14 November 2006 on measures for \nimprovement of the organizational structure of SJSC Uzavtoyul. \n ", "Appendix 2  27 \n20.

Road Development Component \n \n1.   General \n \n1.  The economic analysis is carried out comparing with- and without-project scenarios. The \nProject will comprise reconstruction of the following two sections of the A-380 to meet the two-\nlane international design standard: \n \n(iii)  Section 1: kilometer (km) 876\u2013916 (40 km) in the Republic of Karakalpakstan. \n(iv)  Section  2:  km  490\u2013581  (91  km)  in  Khorezm  Province  and  the  Republic  of \nKarakalpakstan. \n \n2.  The without-project case reflects expected conditions in the absence of the Project, with \nmaintenance sufficient only to hold the road in its present condition. The with-project case \ninvolves initial investment followed by routine and periodic maintenance, but with expenditure \nand frequency of periodic maintenance economically optimum for predicted road conditions and \ntraffic flows. \n \n3.  The  analysis  is  conducted  by  using  the  Highway  Development  and  Management \nModel 4 (HDM-4). It predicted average travel speed, pavement roughness, agency costs, and \nroad user costs. It also calculated the economic viability of road sections. \n \n4.  The  economic  costs  were  estimated  based  on  financial  costs,  including  physical \ncontingencies.  Price  escalation  contingencies,  interest  during  construction,  and  taxes  were \nexcluded. All costs and benefits are expressed in constant mid-2007 prices. The economic \nanalysis covers the construction period of 4 years plus 20 years of operation and maintenance \n(O&M). Economic analysis is conducted using border price numeraire. A standard conversion \nfactor for non-tradable goods was estimated and applied to calculate the economic price of non-\ntradable  goods.  The  shadow  wage  rates  for  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  are  estimated  by \ncomparing  the  average  labor  wage  in  the  region  and  the  project  labor  wage,  taking  into \nconsideration the existing unemployment rate, and are adjusted by the standard conversion \nfactor. The net present value (NPV) at a 12% discount factor and economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) were calculated to evaluate the economic viability of the Project. \n \n2.   Traffic Forecast \n \n  a.   Existing Traffic \n   \n5.  Classified traffic counts were carried out over 24 hours on sections of the project road \naway from the influence of towns and cities between May and June 2007 and are summarized \nin Table A9.1.  \n \nTable A9.1: Traffic Count Summary (2007)  \n \nDomestic  International \nRoad Section  Buses  Cars  Others  Total \nTrucks  Trucks \n34\nKhorezm (km 481)  1,066  5  445  67  1,924 \n1 \n13\nKarakalpakstan (km 886)  164  10  58  2  364 \n0 \nkm = kilometer. \nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance consultant\u2019s traffic count. \n \n   \n ", "Appendix 9    43\nb.

The \ngrowth rate adopted for the traffic forecast is in Table A9.2. \n \nTable A9.2: Forecast Growth Rates \n(% per Year) \n \nYear  Passenger Vehicles  International Trucks  Domestic Trucks \n2006\u20132010  8.5  10.0  10.7 \n2011\u20132015  6.2  7.6  8.8 \n2016\u20132020  4.2  6.0  6.9 \n2021\u20132025  3.2  4.0  5.3 \n2026\u20132031  2.0  4.0  4.0 \nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance consultant\u2019s estimates. \n \n7.  Diverted traffic is expected from (i) freight rail traffic through the Nukus\u2013Oasis railway \nline and (ii) international truck traffic to the Russian Federation currently using northern route. It \nis estimated that 10% of tonnage on the Nukus\u2013Oasis line, running parallel to the A-380 and \ncurrently transporting about 1.72 million metric tons per year, will be diverted to the improved   \nA-380, resulting in an additional 121 heavy trucks per day by 2015. An additional 57 heavy \ntrucks are expected from the Northern Route by 2015.  \n \n8.  Generated  traffic  has  been  assumed  at  about  20%  of  the  flow  of  forecast  normal \ndomestic traffic once all sections of the A-380 have been rehabilitated by 2011.

Economic Analysis \n \na.  Economic Benefits \n \n9.  The following economic benefits have been identified: \n \n(i)  Vehicle operating cost (VOC) savings to existing users. The VOC \u2013 international \nroughness  index  (IRI)  equations  calculated  by  the  HDM-4  were  utilized  in \nestimating benefits. The IRI of the project road is estimated at 12. Following \nreconstruction, the IRI is assumed to be 3, which will be back to 4 before the next \nscheduled periodic maintenance intervention in year 6 lowers it to 3.  \n(ii)  Domestic generated traffic benefits, assumed to be equal to 50% of the benefit \naccruing to domestic users of the A-380 highway. Domestic generated traffic is \nestimated at 20% of existing traffic by 2015.1 \n(iii)  Benefits to road traffic diverting from the Northern Route, conservatively valued \nat $700/truck trip.  \n(iv)  Benefits to small rail consignments diverted by shippers from the railway to \nbenefit  from  the  quicker  road  service,  valued  at  half  the  rate  of  the  benefit \naccruing to domestic road users.  \n(v)  Road accident savings, estimated by assuming a reduction in accident losses \nonce the A-380 highway is improved. Annual losses in property damage and \nforgone production caused by traffic accidents countrywide are estimated at 3% \nof GDP.2 The annual traffic accident costs of the project road are estimated \nbased on the percentage of annual vehicle-km of vehicles along the project road \nto the total national vehicle-km. A 10% reduction in losses was then assumed to \naccrue to improvement of the project road.    \n \nb.  Project Cost \n10.  The civil works will be implemented over a 4-year period from 2008 to 2011. The Project \nprovides sufficient road capacity to cope with the forecast traffic up to 2031, with an overlay \nplanned for every 6 years. \n \n11.  The project cost (taxes excluded) is summarized in Table A9.4. A residual value at the \nend of evaluation period is estimated at 20% of the initial investment.  \n \nTable A9.4: Unit Costs of Road Reconstruction and Maintenance   \n \nWorks  Cost \nCapital Works  $77.1 million (base cost and physical contingencies).

Results of Economic Evaluation \n12.  A summary of the economic analysis is presented in Table A9.5. The road development \ncomponent is economically viable since it produces an EIRR of 17% for section 1 and 34% for \nsection 2. The difference between the EIRR for the two sections is due to a considerable \ndisparity between existing and projected traffic flows. The current and projected traffic in section \n2 is much higher than in section 1. The Project will also (i) provide better access to social \nservices such as health care centers, schools, and markets; (ii) contribute to promoting related \ndevelopment in the region and provide local benefits to the rest of society; (iii) strengthen the \nGovernment\u2019s  broader  strategy  of  developing  strategic  corridors;  and  (iv)  be  strategically \nimportant to international trade.  \n                                           \nTable A9.5: Summary of Economic Analysis for Civil Works \n \n   Section 1: Km 876-916     Section 2: Km 490-581 \nYear  Total Cost  Total Benefit     Total Cost  Total Benefit \n   ($ \u2019000)  ($ \u2019000)     ($ \u2019000)  ($ \u2019000) \n2008  7,424.2      448.0   \n2009  14,262.3      14,673.3   \n2010  3,738.4      20,958.0   \n2011  230.5  3,424.4    18,351.8   \n2012  24.4  3,859.9    55.4  21,514.4 \n2013  24.4  4,198.7    55.4  22,900.0 \n2014  24.4  4,565.8    55.4  24,365.3 \n2015  24.4  4,952.8    55.4  25,878.2 \n2016  24.4  5,393.9    55.4  27,055.4 \n2017  2,474.2  6,030.9    5,235.3  29,283.9 \n2018  24.4  6,509.4    55.4  31,548.1 \n2019  24.4  6,967.6    55.4  33,166.6 \n2020  24.4  7,446.1    55.4  34,878.2 \n2021  24.4  7,970.9    55.4  36,159.9 \n2022  8,907.1  8,712.5    18,847.1  38,169.4 \n2023  24.4  9,275.9    55.4  40,746.8 \n2024  24.4  9,797.0    55.4  42,498.2 \n2025  24.4  10,319.6    55.4  44,184.5 \n2026  24.4  10,870.2    55.4  45,492.2 \n2027  24.4  11,607.6    55.4  46,791.1 \n2028  6,185.5  12,188.8    13,088.3  48,933.8 \n2029  24.4  12,802.2    55.4  51,706.1 \n2030  24.4  13,357.2    55.4  53,475.1 \n2031  (4,924.1)  13,835.3     (6,849.7)  55,088.0 \nEIRR \n(%)  17    34 \nNPV ($ \nmillion)  10.2     104.7 \n( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance consultant\u2019s estimates. \n \nd.  Sensitivity Analysis \n13.  A sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the impact of changes on key parameters \ndetermining project costs and benefits. The road agency cost increase of 20% will reduce the \nEIRR from 17% to 14.5% for section 1 and 34% to 30% for section 2. Meanwhile, the decrease \nin traffic by 20% in both sections would bring down the average EIRR from 17% to 13% for \nsection 1 and from 34% to 24% for section 2. If road accident savings are excluded, the EIRR \n ", "46   Appendix 9 \nbecomes 16% for section 1 and 22% for section 2. If generated (induced) traffic is ignored, the \nEIRR becomes 15% for section 1 and 23% for section 2. The economic analysis and sensitivity \ntest concluded that the road development component is economically justified. \n \nB.  Road Sector Sustainability Component \n \n14.  The  general  principles  of  economic  analysis  are  similar  to  those  for  the  road \ndevelopment component. \n \n15.  The road equipment will be used for road works across the country over the lifetime \nperiod. Under the with-project scenario, purchase of new equipment is considered with well-\nplanned and managed road maintenance. Under the without-project case, the roadworks will be \nimplemented  using  the  existing  equipment  available  in  the  country  with  lack  of  road \nmaintenance planning and management capacity. The net (incremental) benefit would be the \nVOC  savings,  time  value  savings,  and  accident  savings  between  the  with-project  (new \nequipment purchased) and without-project (using the existing equipment) scenarios. Under the \nwithout-project case, the average pavement\u2019s IRI is estimated higher than that of the with-\nproject. The higher average IRI will result in higher VOC, average travel time, and accident \nrates. \n \n16.  The incremental cost would be the cost difference between capital investment and O&M \nof  the  new  equipment  (with  the  Project)  and  O&M  of  the  existing  equipment  (without  the \nProject). The equipment cost is estimated to account for 37.5% of total reconstruction costs. \n \n17.  The  equipment  is  assumed  to  be working  on  about  3.4%  of  the  international  road \nnetwork and about 2% of the total road network per annum. The savings in the 10 years the \nequipment will be utilized are calculated by the HDM-4 model, given the roughness reductions. \nThe EIRR for the equipment was estimated at 33%, which is economically viable (Table A9.6). \nUnder the worst scenario, where the total cost increases by 20% and the incremental benefits \ndecreases  by  20%,  the  EIRR  will  be  about  20%\u2014still  above  the  threshold  of  12%.  The \neconomic  analysis  and  sensitivity  test  concluded  that  the  road  equipment  component  is \neconomically justified. \n \nTable A9.6: Summary of Economic Analysis for  \nRoad Sector Sustainability Component \n \nYear  Incremental Cost  Incremental Benefit \n   ($ million)  ($ million) \n2008  37.0   \n2009  31.2   \n2010  20.7  1.3 \n2011  20.7  1.2 \n2012  20.7  72.6 \n2013  20.7  72.6 \n2014  20.7  90.6 \n2015  20.7  94.8 \n2016  20.7  109.3 \n2017  20.7  120.4 \n2018  20.7  125.2 \n2019  20.7  129.5 \nEIRR (%)  33 \nNPV ($ million)  157.6 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance consultant and Asian Development \nBank estimates. \n ", "Appendix 10   47\n \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS FOR ROAD EQUIPMENT \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.  The financial evaluation of the proposed investments was carried out in accordance with \nthe Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.1 The \nfinancial evaluation covers the investment component under road sector sustainability.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Major Assumptions \n2.  Incremental costs and benefits were computed on the basis of a with- and without- \nproject scenario for FY2008\u2013FY2028. The costs include land acquisition, capital costs, and \nincremental  operation  and  maintenance  costs  (O&M).  Interest  during  implementation  was \nexcluded.  No  salvage  value  was  considered  at  the  end  of  equipment  life  assumed  to  be \n10 years. The anticipated capital mix of debt to equity was used for estimating the weighted \naverage cost of capital. Financial benefits are derived from the average equipment hire charges \nbased on full cost recovery. The financial net present value and financial internal rate of return \n(FIRR) are calculated on an after-tax basis in real terms. \n \nC.  Financial Internal Rate of Return \n3.  The road sector sustainability component covers investments to improve the operational \nefficiency, fair distribution, and arm\u2019s-length transaction of equipment procured under ADB \nfinancing. The road equipment pool company (REPC) will be incorporated in June 2008, and it \nwill implement the equipment procurement.  \n \n4.  The FIRR was calculated based on (i) the estimated 250 kilometer (km) per annum \nweighted average construction and maintenance works; (ii) a 90% productivity factor; (iii) a 10% \nO&M cost of capital cost for a period of 20 years, including a 1-year preparation period and 2-\nyear equipment procurement period; and (iv) no residual value at the end of year 10. Equipment \nreplacement costs were included in the computation of the FIRR at the end of the 10-year \nequipment life. The equipment hire charge was calculated to cover capital costs (depreciation, \nO&M, and debt service) with a 15% return on equity at about $80,000 per unit. The resulting \nFIRR is 12.6% (Table A10.1).  \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.

Financial projections for the road equipment pool company (REPC) have been \nprepared to assess its operational and financial sustainability as a corporate entity. The \nGovernment is committed to the establishment of the REPC, which will be incorporated \nas  a  corporate  legal  entity..  The  REPC  will  own,  manage,  and  maintain  the  road \nequipment assets financed under the Project and be accountable for the associated \nliabilities. The estimated asset value\u2014consisting of debt financed $55.31 million1 road \nequipment and capital contribution by the Government of $13.8 million in the form of \nfacilities, plant, and property. The Government will take all the necessary legal measures \nand actions to set up a new entity for this purpose. The projected income statement, \nbalance sheet, and cash flow statement are in Table A11.1. \n  \nB.   Major Assumptions \n \n2.  Major assumptions for the REPC\u2019s projected financial statements include the \nfollowing: \n \n(i)  The pro forma projected financial statements of the REPC are prepared for \nFY2008\u2013FY2018 and are shown in current terms in local currency.   \n \n(ii)  The  domestic  inflation  rates  are  assumed  at  8.2%  in  FY2008,  7.5%  in \nFY2009, 7.3% in FY2010, and 7.0% from FY2011 onward, in line with the \ndomestic cost escalation factors 2007\u20132011 of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB). The international inflation rate is assumed at 0.8% per annum during \nthe period of analysis. \n \n(iii)  The exchange rate used is SUM1,280 to $1.00 for FY2007, adjusted during \nthe forecast period based on the differential between the assumed domestic \nand international inflation rates. \n \n(iv)  The estimated time for procurement of road equipment is 24 months. It is \nassumed that the REPC will resume operations in FY 2009 and be fully \noperational in FY2010. Operating revenues are generated from equipment \nhire fees. Equipment hire fees are estimated on a full cost recovery basis \n(i.e.,  depreciation,  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  and  debt  service \nallowing return on equity of 15%). About 250 kilometers (km) per annum is \nassumed to be covered with the equipment. A 90% productivity factor is \nused. The average equipment hire fee is estimated at about $80,000/km \n(SUM102 million/km) and is adjusted to reflect local inflation. They are geared \nto meet a minimum 80:20 debt-to-equity ratio and 80% operating ratio.  \n \n(v)  Operating expenses consist of (i) O&M (salaries and general administration \nexpenses), and (ii) depreciation/major repairs of existing and newly acquired \nassets.  Administration  costs  are  estimated  at  6%  of  the  REPC\u2019s  annual \nrevenue. The average labor cost is projected at 3% of gross fixed assets, \nincreasing in line with the local inflation. Depreciation of assets is calculated \n                                                 \n1 The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will onlend $55.31 million to the REPC.  \n ", "    Appendix 11    51\n \non a straight-line basis at 10%, depreciating the assets over its economical \nlife of 10 years. The repair and maintenance costs are assumed to be 1% of \ngross fixed assets initially, and are projected to increase over time to 4%. \n \n(vi)  The REPC is expected to receive the same benefits as other road companies \n(private and public), which are exempt from payments of corporate taxation \nand customs duty of 20% on the import of equipment and machinery.   \n \n(vii)  Capital expenditure on road maintenance equipment is based on estimates \nfrom the feasibility studies financed by ADB.2 Some 163 units are assumed to \nbe  procured  in  FY2008  plus  136  units  in  FY2009,  totaling  299 units  of \nequipment. \n \n(viii)  Inventories represent 1 month of repair value and maintenance costs, and \nare assumed to contain all necessary spares and tools for maintenance of the \nequipment. \n \n(ix)  A minimum debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20 is assumed. The Government is \ncommitted to transfer assets that are relevant to REPC operations, in the \nform of equity contribution assumed at $13.8 million, representing about 20% \nof the REPC\u2019s total assets.  \n \n(x)  Financial charges are assumed to be paid as accrued during each year. They \nare calculated on the average balance of outstanding loan liability during the \nyear. The ADB ordinary capital resources (OCR) loan of $55.31 million will be \nonlent to the REPC at an additional premium of 0.2%. The same repayment \nperiod  is  assumed  to  apply:  4-year  grace  period  and  20-year  debt \namortization  schedule.  The  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)  is \nestimated  at  5.6%  (6  months\u2019  LIBOR  at  5.0%  as  of  22  October  2007) \nincluding 0.6% fixed spread and 0.35% commitment charge on undisbursed \nloan amount.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe interim poverty reduction strategy for Uzbekistan (2005\u20132010) identifies four pillars for reducing poverty incidence: \n(i) high economic growth rates by maintaining macroeconomic stability and accelerating structural reforms, (ii) human \ndevelopment and social protection, (iii) reduced interregional inequalities in living standards, and (iv) improved environment \nprotection. The strategy takes into account differences in the social and economic development of the regions throughout the \ncountry.1 Within the framework of the strategy, two economic policy objectives are set: (i) reduction of regional differences in \nliving standards, and (ii) creation of conditions to increase the economic potential of the regions. The instruments to achieve \nthese  objectives  are  as  follows:  national  social  and  investment  programs,  and  programs  for  the  establishment  and \nmodernization of infrastructure, as well as reform of the local authority and decentralization of public administration. The steps \nto provide stable social and economic development in the regions include provision of government support and stimulation of \nthe  comprehensive  development  of  the  regions  regarding  the  development  of  their  industrial  infrastructure  facilities, \nimprovement of their investment attractiveness, and placement of small manufacturing enterprises in rural districts. The \nGovernment\u2019s poverty reduction strategy clearly indicates the importance of infrastructure development.  \n \nThe Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) country and strategy program for Uzbekistan (2006\u20132010)2 identified four strategic \npriorities: (i) accelerate environmentally sustainable rural development, (ii) enable private sector development, (iii) promote \nregional cooperation in transport and customs transit, and (iv) build human capital of the poor. It prioritizes infrastructure, \nincluding road development, to help the Government achieve its development objective and reduce poverty. The Project, \nwhich is included in the country strategy and program, has two major components: road development and road sustainability. \nThe Project is expected to contribute to increasing trade with neighboring countries.  It is also expected to generate new \ninitiatives and opportunities of economic activities. Improved connectivity and access to health center, schools, and markets \nemerged as a major priority for the poor. Rural\u2013urban links, promoted through improvements of highways, contribute to \nsupporting  greater  stability  of  income  and  increased  off-farm  employment  in  rural  areas.  In  the  case  of  the  desert \nenvironment, improvement of the road and its rehabilitation is a primary measure to reduce isolation, increase communication, \nand thus generate new opportunities; and to give the local poor the possibility to be involved in new initiatives outside planned \nagriculture production.   \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nAfter independence in 1996, Uzbekistan\u2019s economic growth and measures taken by the Government have led to positive \ntrends. The country started to recover from economic decline: life expectancy increased, infant and child mortality dropped, \nbasic education was introduced and illiteracy was eliminated, the gender gap in education fell, 95% of households own their \ndwellings, and the majority of rural households have access to plots. Nevertheless, despite a slowly declining poor population, \neconomic growth has not generated sufficient employment opportunities. According to the 2002 and 2003 household budget \nsurveys, the poverty level in the country is 27.5%, with 6.8 million people living in absolute income deprivation.3 Regional \nvariations in poverty remain high and rural population has a higher rate of poverty\u201470% of the country\u2019s poor lives in rural \nareas and the rural poverty rate is 30.5% versus 22.5% in urban areas. The highest concentration of poor households is in the \nsouthern and northern regions. The Republic of Karakalpakstan, Namangan, Kashkadarya, and Khorezm have the highest \npoverty incidence. \n \nThe Project will generate nonquantifiable economic and social benefits. Better roads will likely attract additional economic \nactivity and traffic, thus generating benefits to a wider circle of beneficiaries. Direct benefits of the Project include employment \nopportunities in civil works. Construction will create temporary jobs, and routine maintenance will employ unskilled and \nsemiskilled workers. Women will be encouraged to work and be treated equitably. The Project will provide better and \nimproved conditions for all road users, improved conditions, better and faster access to health centers (especially city \nhospitals in emergency cases), better access to education and to basic needs and markets, and better access to markets and \nimprovement of market relations. Indirect benefits will include employment and business opportunities, such as restaurants. \n ", "Appendix 13    57\nOther private business opportunities are expected to emerge, such as vehicle-related services and small businesses.  \n2. Design Features  \n \nThe Project will involve civil works of a major highway, using mostly machinery and skilled labor. Only a limited amount of \nunskilled labor will be needed during construction. No specific pro-poor activities are planned in this Project.  \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe  Project  covers  two  road  sections  located  in  the  Republic  of  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm  Province.  The  main \nbeneficiaries of the Project will be road users and the secondary beneficiaries will be people living along the improved road. \nThe Project will reconstruct the existing roads within the current right-of-way owned by the Government.  \n \nThe Project concerns five villages, four of which are in the Republic of Karakalpakstan. The villages have changed from the \nsovkhoz (state-operated agricultural estate) system to shirkat (agricultural cooperatives) system.. The shirkat farm is \ntotally irrigated and produces three crops: cotton, wheat, and rice. Wheat is sold according to state quotas; the surplus is \nshared among the workers. At the level of local villagers, these changes do not seem to have any effect. They are \nsharecroppers and must produce certain amounts of yield. One village is located in Khorezm. Most of the villagers work in \nwater and gas reservoir pumps, small businesses, and animal husbandry. There are also employees of different companies \n(gas company, railway, salt quarry, and soda plant) and about 100 pastoralists in the project area. The pastoral-nomads \nrepresent a group that is unknown because it is a new phenomenon.  \n \nRehabilitation of the road is seen by both local authorities and the population as a very positive action. They need the road for \neveryday life, for their security, and to improve their livelihoods. The road also represents new opportunities for business on \ndifferent levels\u2014for local women to sell their crafts and open new chayhonas (tea houses); for pastoralists to sell their animals \nand products more easily; and for the local population to have better access to health centers, education, and basic needs. \nFor local and provincial authorities, the improved road will further develop markets and commerce, transportation, and \nbusiness opportunities. \n \nThere are neither resettlement issues nor land loss in the project area. There will be no land, housing, property, or income \nloss; and no new limitations to the movement of villagers and pastoralists. No archeological site, cemetery, or other \nsocial/cultural facilities will be affected by the Project. Village inhabitants and pastoral nomads are vulnerable, but their \nvulnerable situations are neither directly nor indirectly related to the project road. They will benefit from the Project.   \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nConsultation was conducted with stakeholders including the local population; the Road Fund, the Project\u2019s Executing Agency \n(EA); and district government officials. A meeting was held with the governor of Khorezm. Discussions also took place with \nvillage chairpersons and some of the pastoral-nomads. Most of the fieldwork was based on qualitative analysis and direct \nobservation.  \n \n2.

Key Issues \n \nWomen will be able to benefit from rehabilitation of the road through improved access to basic services such as health, \neducation, and markets. The development opportunities will also concern employment for women in restaurants, tourism, \nresting areas, and crafts and other products. These opportunities are expected to reduce migration for women.  \n \n ", "58  Appendix 13 \n2.

The  Project  is  classified  environment  category  B  in  accordance  with  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Environmental Assessment Guidelines. The summary initial \nenvironmental examination (SIEE), prepared by the project preparatory technical assistance \n(PPTA) consultant on behalf of the Republican Road Fund (the Road Fund), is consistent \nwith the requirements of ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment \nGuidelines. The Project will comprise upgrading of two sections of national highway A-380, \nand will not involve realignment or construction of bypasses or diversions. As such, it does \nnot fall under the type of projects that require an environmental assessment based on the \nLaw  on  Ecological  Expertise,  2000.1 Only  a  confirmation  that  project  activities  will  be \nconfined within the right-of-way and that no significant realignments or interference with any \nnatural habitat will take place is required.   \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n2.   The Project will have three components: (i) road construction; (ii) road equipment \nacquisition; and (iii) advisory support for the introduction of a comprehensive road sector \nplanning and management system; establishment of a road construction equipment unit; and \nprocurement of civil works, consultants, and equipment. The Project will involve resurfacing \nand widening of two sections of the A-380 highway totaling 131 kilometers (km): (i) in \nKharezm Province (Section 1: 91 km), and (ii) in the Republic of Karakalpakstan (Section 2: \n40 km). Upgrading shall be confined within the existing 50-meter (m) right-of-way (25 m on \neither side of the road centerline). The main working width will be 8\u201310 m centered over the \nexisting carriageway. Construction and movement of materials will take place along the \nhighway, so access roads will not be necessary. The Project will not involve land acquisition \nand resettlement. Rehabilitation works will require more than 6.6 million cubic meters (m3) of \nearthworks for subgrade, shoulder, and carriageway repair. Site works are expected to \ncommence in late 2008, with actual work progressing for 3 years.   \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n3.   Topography and Geology. The topography of the land through which the two road \nsections  pass  includes  mostly  desert  and  slightly  undulating  terrain,  as  found  at  the \nboundary of the Amudarya River valley. The geology of the area consists of a mixture of \nsandstone and limestone, overlain with sand. Nearly all towns and villages in the vicinity of \nthe road are located in the irrigated river plain and the delta of the Amudarya, a minimum of \n5\u201310  km  away  from  the  road  right-of-way,  leaving  the project  roadsides almost totally \nuninhabited. Neither of the project road sections passes across or close to the river valley \nproper. \n \n4.   Climate,  Air  Quality,  and  Noise.  The  project  area  has  a  southern  temperate \ncontinental desert climate, with extremely hot summer temperatures exceeding 45\u00b0C and \nvirtually  no  rain.  December  through  February  is  the  winter  period,  with  temperatures \ndropping  below  \u201315\u00b0C,  but  more  often  around  the  freezing  point  or  above  0\u00b0C. \nTemperatures begin to climb in March, accompanied by occasional rain (200 millimeters or \nless)  and  sometimes  accompanied  by  flash  floods.  In  dry  desert  conditions,  the  daily \ntemperature fluctuations can be as much as 30\u00b0C. Frequent dust storms occur during the \nsummer  months  of  March  to  May  when  winds  exceeding  100  km/hour  generate  large \ndisturbances, significantly raising the levels of total suspended particulates in the project \narea. Fine salt is also dispersed into the air mass during such storms. Given that traffic is \n                                                 \n1  Included in the New Laws of the Republic of Uzbekistan Edition 23. Amendments were published in the \nNarodnoye Slove in July 2000. \n ", "Appendix 14   61\nlight and there is no industry anywhere along the alignment\u2014except the Provincial Transport \nDepartment\u2019s rock crushing and batch plant facilities, and the soda mine and factory at \nKm 916\u2014air remains relatively free from gaseous emissions. During the field investigation, \nno noise sensitive sites were identified along the alignment.  \n \n5.   Water Resources. Aside from occasional rainfall and flash floods, the road does not \npass over any surface water. The shallow groundwater acquifer is >25 m below the surface, \nsaline, and polluted. Because of intensive pesticide and fertilizer use, especially in Khorezm \nProvince and the Republic of Karakalpakstan, groundwater at a depth of 100\u2013150 m is also \ncontaminated. Groundwater for human consumption is scarce in the two project regions, with \nonly 22,000 m3/day and 33,000 m3/day available based on 2003 data.   \n \n6.   Flora  and  Fauna.  The ecological zones through which the road passes is the \nQizylkum  desert  and  Ustiyurt  Plateau,  an  elevated  desert  region,  much  of  which  is \nsignificantly modified by past irrigated agriculture and livestock overgrazing. The project road \nruns along a sparsely vegetated semidesert area. Section 1 has no known environmentally \nsensitive features within at least 3 km centered over the road. The Amudarya River Basin \nForest Reserve is located at Km 677, more than 100 km away from section 1 and 200 km \nfrom section 2. There are no known sensitive species habitats for section 2, despite the fact \nthat the area was the migratory range of the saiga antelope (an endangered species) and \ngoitered gazelle (a vulnerable species) prior to 1980. Since that time, overhunting and \nshrinking of the Aral Sea has decimated the saiga population such that only 10% of the \noriginal numbers remain. There is no danger that the project roadwork will in any way \ninterfere with these species. A less severe, but similar condition, affects the goitered gazelle. \nThere are other vulnerable birds and herptiles species in the general area, but they have not \nbeen sighted within 5 km of the road sections by environment officials of Gozcompriroda \nNukus or Kungrad for over a decade. \n \n7.   Economic and Cultural Resources. The Republic of Karakalpakstan, where nearly \nall the road improvements will take place, is sparsely populated (7.5 people/km2) and areas \nwithin the road right-of-way area are almost totally devoid of settlements. There is no human \nsettlement within the 50 m wide right-of-way along the entire project corridor. Some nomad \ncamps and a few road-toll houses are located some distance from the road. A number of \nvillages identified in the social assessment report are located 5 km or more from the road \nsections. The project road section has no farming, other than nomadic sheep and cattle \nherding which has decreased the sparse grass cover, thereby increasing problems with sand \ndunes and erosion. The land is used almost totally for light grazing or is unused. Generally, \ntowns near the project road have electricity, but little else. This is particularly true in the \nRepublic of Karakalpakstan, where frequent power outages are experienced and basic \nhousehold services such as piped potable water or indoor toilet facilities do not exist.   \n \n8.   Topraq Qala Fort, spread over a 120 m x 100 m area, is an adobe walled fortification \nlocated along section 2 (km 887) north of Kungrad and is a second century A.D. structure \nfrom the Kushan period. Toprak Qala has no access or connection to the project road. The \nfort\u2019s outer mud wall boundary is located about 150 m from the A-380 highway. Daud Ata \nCemetery is also located along section 2 at km 889 on the west side of the A-380 highway. It \nis actively used by the four small villages located to the east, as well as by the people of \nKungrad. The cemetery entrance is located 50 m from the edge-of-pavement. On the Ustyurt \nPlateau, there are a series of other archaeological sites\u2014Kirqgiz Qalaa and Tesik Qalaa\u2014\ndating from the same period as Daud Ata Cemetery. These areas are known only from \nhistorical records, i.e., they have not been rediscovered. \n \nD.  Screening Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n9.   Pre-Construction Phase. The decision to restrict the road upgrading to within the \nexisting right-of-way and carriageway will keep construction impacts to a minimum. Existing \n ", "62  Appendix 14 \ntransmission lines and underground gas pipelines are located outside the right-of-way. A \nwork boundary of 25 m from the centerline of sections 1 and 2 will be defined using fencing \nto ensure that construction equipment are kept within the work sites. The Road Fund also \nplans to bring all construction materials to the construction area in bulk by railcar and from \nnearby intermodal terminals. Large trucks (up to 26 tons) will be used to transport materials \nto the construction site. Construction vehicles and equipment will make use of the existing \nhighway such that no new access roads need to be established. As part of the detailed \ndesign work, areas along sections 1 and 2 that are prone to flash floods shall be identified by \nlocal road agency staff and these conditions shall be accommodated in the final design.  \n \n10.   Construction Phase. Road widening will require clearing of about 130 hectares (ha) \nof land within the right-of-way. Natural vegetation removed during construction shall be \nreplaced. Stabilization using reed mats and the planting of saksaul (Haloxylon sp.) seedlings \naccording to advice from the Uzbekistan Forestry Institute in Tashkent will be undertaken. It \nmay be possible to use waste sewage water to help with watering of revegetation sites. To \nprevent wind and water erosion, revegetation of the disturbed areas will be undertaken as \nthe work proceeds and as soon as work on any given stretch is completed. During the initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE),  it  was  determined  that  a  saksaul  tree  nursery  was \nestablished with donor assistance (German development cooperation through Deutsche \nGesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit or GTZ) in the Republic of Karakalpakstan and \nthat trees are available for replanting purposes.  \n \n11.   Extraction of sand and gravel in riverbeds shall be prohibited except (i) where there is \nno technically and economically feasible alternative; and (ii) provided specific mitigation \nmeasures are implemented to minimize impacts on river morphology, water quality, and \necosystems (e.g., reduced extraction during the fish spawning period). Materials shall be \nsourced from licensed quarry/borrow areas operations. Borrow pits shall be dewatered and \nfences shall be provided, as appropriate, to minimize health and safety risks. Large volumes \nof quarry rock, aggregate, and sand will be transported and stored near the roadworks. Work \nand storage areas and haul routes will be constantly exposed to the elements, and will \nprimarily create dust during the frequent windy conditions. Dust control will be very difficult \ngiven the scarcity of water. Dust at work and materials storage sites will be controlled by \nwatering, using shallow aquifer saline water. Along the haul roads, provision of canopies on \nloaded trucks will be the primary mitigation measure. Any spills on the haul roads will be \ncleaned up by the contractor within a 24-hour period. It is assumed that the new mobile \nplants purchased as part of this loan will have dust suppression technology installed and as \nsuch  will  help  to control  the  dust plumes  that  usually  come  from  crushing  operations. \nEmissions should be kept to a minimum given that state-of-the-art machinery will be used. \nInspection and regular reporting will ensure that equipment is maintained to specifications \nand  that  dust  is  carefully  and  continuously  managed.  Dust  control  will  be  particularly \nstringent for mobile crushing plants, which can produce large plumes of fine dust that can \nbecome airborne many kilometers downwind of their location. \n \n12.   Sediment-laden drainage water is not an issue since there is no surface water body \ninto which it may drain. Runoff will simply percolate into the surrounding soils during the rare \nrains. Fuel will be stored in an adequately protected area to prevent contamination of \ngroundwater in case of spills or leaks. Construction camps shall be provided with septic \ntanks,  and  solid  waste  shall  be  properly  stored  and  disposed  of.  The  contractor  shall \nundertake proper decommissioning of work areas, work camp sites including waste dumps, \nand sealing/securing of wells newly dug for use during the construction period. Construction \ninspection will include specific examination of existing culverts and water channels in areas \nsubject to flash flooding to reconfirm that no drainage restrictions will result because of the \nconstruction work. The contractor shall prepare a traffic management plan to ensure that \nadequate vehicular and pedestrian access is provided at all times. \n \n ", "Appendix 14   63\n13.   Given the scarcity of water (particularly water suitable for use in concrete making) \nand a plan for contractors to extract large volumes from the deep aquifer along the road or \nfrom existing wells, a water extraction permitting and monitoring program will be prepared by \nthe contractors in close consultation with local water management authorities. The extraction \nvolumes per well will be established based on the geo-hydrological conditions as determined \nby experts, such that recharge and extraction will be balanced. Each well to be used will \nhave a maximum sustainable extraction volume established, and a meter will be affixed to \neach well with a seal. Meters will be read daily, with records sent to local authorities. \nContractors  exceeding  allowable  limits  will  have  the  water  supply  shut  off  and  an \ninvestigation completed and fines paid.   \n \n14.   The  project  implementation  unit  (PIU),  with  the  assistance  of  the  construction \nsupervision  engineer,  shall  undertake  regular  environmental  compliance  monitoring.  A \nmonitoring checklist will be prepared as part of each monitoring cycle and a monitoring \nreport, which will be attached to the weekly and monthly progress reports. The monitoring \nreport will provide an assessment of the contractor\u2019s implementation of mitigation measures, \nidentification of other impacts that need to be addressed, and documentation of complaints \nby  the  affected  people  and  how  such  complaints  were addressed. To  carry  mitigation \nmeasures over into the operating period, the contractor will prepare a construction period \nenvironmental mitigation completion report to be submitted to Uzavtoyul for its use during \nthe operational period. Some measures, such as revegetation, will need to be continued and \nstrengthened during the operational period.   \n \n15.   Operation Phase. With an expected small increase in traffic volume, associated \nimpacts  will  likely  be  minor.  Local  air  and  noise  conditions  will  be  affected  minimally. \nUzavtoyul shall continue maintaining revegetation areas and confirmation of the predicted \nnoise and vibration disturbance caused by traffic increase if there is roadside residential \ndevelopment.  Depending  on  the  shipping  routes,  the  transport  of  larger  volumes  of \nhazardous and toxic materials may marginally increase the risk of hazardous material spills. \nOnce  the  traffic  volume  of  trucks  doubles  and  the  movement  of  hazardous  and  toxic \nmaterials increases significantly, a specific spill contingency plan should be prepared and \nprovincial offices should be trained to respond to spills.  \n \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n \n16.   The environmental management plan (EMP) proposed in the IEE shall be made \nlegally binding through inclusion as environmental clauses in the Loan Agreement between \nthe Government and ADB as well as in the specifications in the contract bid documents. The \ncontractor shall be responsible in implementing the identified mitigation measures during the \nconstruction  stage  and  shall  be  required  to  prepare  a  site-specific  construction  period \nenvironmental  action  plan  defining  steps  they  will  take  to  ensure  timely  and  proper \nimplementation  of  mitigation  measures  using,  as  basis,  the  environmental  controls \nrecommended in the IEE. The Project will have a PIU assisted by a construction supervision \nengineer, likely an international consultant, with responsibility for environmental mitigation \nand monitoring oversight. It will be the construction supervision engineer\u2019s responsibility to \nestablish specific pay items for the environmental mitigation and monitoring activities, with \npayments made only after verification that each work component has been completed as \nprescribed.  Since  neither  Uzavtoyul  nor  the  Road  Fund  have  skills  in  environmental \ncompliance inspection/monitoring and reporting, particularly at the oblast or provincial level, \nthe PIU will organize and coordinate workshops for managers and oblast-level inspectors. \nTopics  will  include  environmental  assessment,  mitigation  inspection,  enforcement  of \nenvironmental management plans, and reporting. Terms of reference for a short training \nprogram have been prepared and are attached in the IEE. \n \n17.   During the project design period, monitoring will focus on confirming Uzavtoyul\u2019s \ncommitment  to  arranging  and  participating  in  training  programs  on  environmental \n ", "64  Appendix 14 \nassessment,  mitigation  and  monitoring  methods,  and  reporting.  Secondly,  the  contract \ndocumentation will be examined to assure that appropriate environmental safeguards have \nbeen  added,  such  as  the  requirement  to  implement  and  adhere  to  the  environmental \nmitigation and monitoring plan. \n \n18.   Construction period monitoring will deal mostly with compliance monitoring of the \nfollowing construction-related actions: (i) consultation with local community people prior to \ninitiation of work that affects their livelihoods, e.g., access restriction and traffic congestion, \nnoise; (ii) execution and management of the revegetation program; (iii) handling and delivery \nof construction materials; (iv) dust management at construction sites; and (v) general good \nhousekeeping activities by the contractor at all construction sites. \n \nF.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n \n19.   Two  public  consultation  sessions,  attended  by  local  officials  and  small \nbusinesspersons, were undertaken for the Project. During these consultations, all project \ndetails known at the time, except costs, were disclosed, including the preparation of an EMP \nand the strong commitments of Uzavtoyul to follow the environmental guidelines defined in \nthe IEE. During both sets of meetings, participants were pleased to note the emphasis on \nenvironmental controls but felt that there was little to be concerned about for this Project. \nThe first consultation was in June 2007, held in Bukhara and Urgenh. The TA consultants \npresented the Project and sought comments and inputs. The participants did not raise \nconcerns  regarding  potential  environmental  impacts  and  expressed  full  support  for  the \nProject. The second round of consultations was held in Nukus and Kungrad, Karakalpakstan \nin July 2007, and addressed specific environmental concerns such as the existence and \nsensitivity of the endangered species near the project area, and existing concerns with noise \nand air pollution. Local officials and municipal managers had no concerns with construction \nperiod impacts, but were interested to learn about the traffic management program during \nthe construction, as the work would be done on the existing A-380 highway. Uzavtoyul is \nconsulting with its regional offices in this matter and will require that the contractors prepare \na traffic management program.   \n \nG.  Findings and Recommendations \n \n20.   The project road, along with other proposed improvements along various sections of \nthe A-380 highway, will contribute to reduced travel time, more reliable transport service, \ngreater passenger comfort, and generation of jobs stemming from greater traffic-induced \ncommerce. These changes will, over the long term, gradually lead to an improved standard \nof living for local families who take advantage of new income-generating opportunities. It will \nprovide better access to services such as health, schooling, and markets that will be felt \nimmediately once a section or road is improved. \n \n21.   While the IEE identified a number endangered species, these are found at great \ndistance from section 2 on the Ustyurt Plateau. Local experts indicated that few, if any, of \nthese species are found anywhere near the road right-of-way.  \n \n22.   Provided  that  the  mitigation  and  monitoring  actions  defined  in  the  IEE  are \nimplemented  during  the  construction  and  operation  periods,  the  Project  will  not  have \nsignificant adverse environmental effects and should be carried out as planned. \n \nH.  Conclusion \n \n23.   The IEE is considered sufficient to identify anticipated impacts associated with the \nProject, and provides measures for their mitigation and management. Therefore, no further \nenvironmental assessment is required.  \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20071220081029+08'00'", "Author": "MPA", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20071221104358+08'00'", "Title": "CAREC Regional Road Project", "Keywords": "rrp: 39669 uzb, carec regional road, international highways development, road development, road sector sustainability"}, "author_page": " \nVice President  L.
