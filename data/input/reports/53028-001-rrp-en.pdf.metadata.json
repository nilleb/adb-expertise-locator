The  proposed  Ulaanbaatar  Air  Quality  Improvement \nProgram  \u2013  Phase  2,  which  builds  on  reforms  initiated  in  Ulaanbaatar  Air  Quality  Improvement \nProgram  (Phase  1),1 is  embedded  in  the  2017\u20132025  National  Program  for  Reducing  Air  and \nEnvironmental Pollution.2 The government\u2019s ownership of and commitment to implementation of \nthe  proposed  reforms  under  Phase  2  was  conveyed  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  in  the \ndevelopment  policy  letter  (Appendix  3).  Phase  2  will  support  the  government  in  implementing \nurgent actions to mitigate air pollution during the winter of 2019\u20132020 and introducing medium- \nto long-term clean heating solutions. The TA will facilitate the government\u2019s efforts to continue \nlonger-term reforms through an agreed post-program partnership framework (PPPF). \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nMacroeconomic context. Following a period of rapid growth driven by foreign investment \nin mining activities, Mongolia experienced a sharp economic slowdown driven by falling prices for \nmineral exports. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth fell from 11.2% in 2013 to 1.2% in 2016, \nwhile  the  budget  deficit  increased to 15.4%  of  GDP  during  the  same period;  this  resulted  in a \nrequest to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for support. While growth has resumed under \nthe IMF program\u2014reaching 7.2% in 2018, and forecasted at 6.7% in 2019\u2014the country remains \nvulnerable,  with  high  debt,  low  reserves,  and  significant  external  financing  needs.  The \ngovernment\u2019s prudent fiscal policy has enabled it to achieve a budget surplus of 2.6% in 2018, \nwith an expected surplus of 0.6% in 2019. However, the continuing high level of debt (86.2% of \nGDP) constrains funding of urgently needed social measures. In addition, a significant portion of \nMongolia\u2019s debt (equal to 22% of GDP) will mature during 2021\u20132024, and buffers are depleted; \nthe balance in the Fiscal Stability Fund totals 0.1% of GDP, and gross reserves remain below the \nIMF\u2019s  recommended  reserve  adequacy  level.  Moreover,  the  poverty  rate  has  increased  from \n21.6% in 2014, to 29.6% in 2016, recovering only slightly to 28.4% 2018.3 \n \nAir pollution and its costs. Air pollution, particularly in Ulaanbaatar, is both a contributing \n4. \nfactor  to  and  a  consequence  of  Mongolia\u2019s  economic  challenges.  Concentrations  of  inhalable \nparticulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5) in areas of Ulaanbaatar exceed \nthe limits recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) by almost nine times. A 2019 \nstudy for the United Nations Development Programme estimates the welfare costs of air pollution \n\n1   ADB. 2018.

Manila. \n \n\n\f2 \n\nat  $486 million  annually and the  costs  of  lost  productivity  at  $58  million,  with  a  combined  cost \nequal to 5.6% of Mongolia\u2019s GDP.4 Other estimates are even higher\u2014a recent World Bank study \nestimated welfare costs in 2013 as $2.2 billion annually or 6.9%of GDP and the costs of reduced \nproductivity as a further $144 million annually.5 \n \n5. \nThe  top  causes  of  mortality  in  Mongolia  listed  by  the  WHO  include  cerebrovascular \ndisease, heart disease, influenza and pneumonia, tuberculosis, and hypertension, all of which are \nexacerbated by air pollution.6 Children are particularly vulnerable to pollution impacts, which can \nresult  in  reduced  fetal  growth,  preterm  birth,  pneumonia,  impaired  brain  development,  and \nreduced  lung  function,  leading  to  acute  and  chronic  respiratory  diseases. 7 Women  are  most \nsusceptible to the negative impacts of indoor air pollution, given their prolonged exposure in their \nrole as household caretakers. \n \n6. \nThe  impacts  are  greatest  in  Ulaanbaatar,  which  is  home  to  two-thirds  of  the  urban \npopulation;  this  share  is  continuing  to  increase  as  nomadic  herders  move  to  the  city.8 These \ninward migrants have largely settled in ger areas, which are now home to an estimated 221,000 \nhouseholds, or 800,000 people (up from 350,000 people in 2000). Estimates suggest that almost \n10% of deaths in Ulaanbaatar in 2013 resulted from outdoor air pollution.9 A 2017 study estimates \noutdoor and indoor air pollution causes 1,400 excess deaths annually, with 33% of deaths among \nchildren from acute lower respiratory tract infections attributed to air pollution.10 \n \n7. \nDrivers of air pollution. Access to heating is critical for survival in Mongolia. The harsh \nwinter  features  daytime  temperatures  ranging  from  \u201310\u00b0C  to  \u201330\u00b0C,  and  the  temperature  can \ndrop to \u201340\u00b0C at night. The heating season is unusually long (8 months). Apartment buildings in \nUlaanbaatar are connected to district heating supplies, but the network does not extend to ger \nareas,  peri-urban  areas  named  after  the  traditional  Mongolian  tent.  In  the  absence  of  district \nheating,  ger  area  households  are  largely  reliant  on  the  combustion  of  raw  coal  for  heating. \nGovernment buildings mostly rely on inefficient coal-fired heat-only boilers.11 The burning of raw \ncoal  contributes  an  estimated  80%  of  ambient  PM2.5  concentrations,  with  coal  burning  in  the \ncombined  heat  and  power  plants  that  generate  electricity  and  heat  for  the  city  contributing  an \nadditional 5%\u20136% of ambient concentrations.12 The contribution of coal burning for winter heating \nis readily apparent in the pattern of PM2.5 concentrations over the year, as shown in the following \nfigure. \n \n\n \n\nDevelopment Programme.  \n\n4  AARC Consulting. 2019.

Ulaanbaatar. \n\n8  In 2003, the government began  giving each Mongolian citizen a plot of land of about 700 square meters. For the \nmigrants to Ulaanbaatar, it was an opportunity to settle in the city\u2019s periphery, often using their gers (traditional tents) \nfor housing. \n\n9  R. Allen et al. 2013.

PLoS ONE 12(10): e0186834.   \n11 Most  raw  coal  burned  in  ger  area  households  is  low-quality  coal  from  the  Baganuur  mine  with  high  levels  of \ncontaminants (e.g., sulfur, ash, volatile organics, and moisture) and a low energy content. As a result, burning raw \ncoal  produces  significant  particulate  and  sulfur  dioxide  emissions  when  burned  raw.  Gers  generally  have  short \nchimneys, and emissions are therefore not easily dispersed, and significantly impact local air quality in ger areas. \n12 The remaining 15% comes from transport (10%) and the resuspension of dust from unpaved roads and fly ash from \n\nthe combined heat and power plants (4%\u20135%). \n\n\fPM2.5 Concentration in Ulaanbaatar, February 2017\u2013October 2019 \n\n3 \n\n3\nm\ng\n\u03bc\n\n/\n\n1,000\n\n900\n\n800\n\n700\n\n600\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n \nPM2.5 = particulate matter of less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, \u03bcg/m3 = micrograms per cubic meter. \nNote: Missing values are replaced by the value for the closest recorded hour. \nSource: US Embassy, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Air Quality (PM2.5 emissions concentrations recorded hourly). \n\n \n8. \nBinding constraints. Key binding constraints to improving air quality and reducing the \ncosts  of  air  pollution  are  (i)  a  weak  regulatory  framework  for  air  pollution  control;  (ii)  a  lack  of \neffective implementation of short-term measures to mitigate pollution and its health impacts; and \n(iii) inadequate integration of urban and energy planning, leading to inefficient energy use and \nfurther constraining alternatives to the use of coal for heating.13 \n \nWeak  regulatory  framework.  A  multi-agency  coordinating  committee  has  been \n9. \nestablished  to  manage  the  air  quality  improvement  program.  However,  there  is  no  permanent \nentity  tasked  with  ongoing  oversight  of  pollution  reduction  measures  and  support  for  their \nimplementation, meaning critical measures may stall or fail to be implemented over time. There \nis a lack of reliable and comprehensive data on current air pollution levels across Ulaanbaatar \nbecause  of  aging  and  inoperative  equipment,  limited  spatial  coverage,  and  insufficient  trained \nstaff,  which  makes  identifying  baselines,  designing  interventions,  and  monitoring  performance \nextremely  challenging.  Building  standards  are  incomplete,  and  in  particular,  current  energy \nefficiency standards do not create incentives for private property developers to exceed minimum \nlevels in order to attract premium prices for cleaner and more efficient buildings. \n \n10. \nLack of effective implementation of short-term mitigating measures. The government \nis  implementing  ambitious  policies  to  replace  raw  coal  use  by  ger  area  households  with \nalternative, less-polluting fuels and electric heating. However, it is essential that at the outset the \nreplacement programs do not result in supply shortages or price shocks that would undermine \ntheir acceptance. Various measures are planned to address these concerns, but these need to \nbe fully implemented, along with accompanying measures to reduce the health costs of pollution, \nwhich disproportionately impact poor and vulnerable households concentrated in ger areas. Most \nhouseholds have health insurance that covers hospital services, but there are high out-of-pocket \n\n13 Sector Assessment (Summary): Multisector (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\nexpenses  in  accessing  these  services. 14  Vaccination  and  immunization  rates,  which  could \nmitigate the impacts of air pollution, are consequently lower among poor households. \n \n11. \nInadequate  urban  and  energy  planning  for  medium-  to  long-term  solutions.  Ger \nareas  are  characterized  by  square  fenced  parcels  of  land  accessed  by  unpaved  pathways. \nHousing is largely either traditional tents or single-storey, poorly insulated houses. Poor quality \nconstruction and a failure to comply with building standards are a persistent problem because of \nlow  incomes  and inadequate  enforcement;  this  increases fuel  consumption  and heating costs, \nand  exacerbates  the  pervasive  air  pollution.  Expansion  of  centralized  heating  and  electricity \nnetworks  to  ger  areas  is  planned,  but  capacity  constraints  and  aging  heat  and  electricity \ngeneration plants mean that such an expansion will need to be accompanied by decentralized \nclean heat supply solutions to ensure full coverage. Potential decentralized solutions include heat \npumps, solar thermal heaters, liquefied petroleum gas heaters, and community micro grids using \nsolar  and  storage  technologies.  It  may  also  be  possible  to  further  reduce  emissions  from \nhousehold  stoves  through  additional  improvements  to  briquettes  (e.g.,  by  using  biomass \nbriquettes) and improved stoves. \n \nB. \n \n12. \nGovernment  initiatives  and  recent  reforms.  The  government  launched  initiatives  to \nimprove air quality in 2011, with a focus on the use of improved stoves, but the aggregate impacts \nwere  minimal.  This  has  been  attributed  to  a  lack  of  suitable fuels  and the  resale  of  stoves  by \nhouseholds to profit from the difference between the subsidized price and market price. National \nexpenditures on air quality improvement peaked in 2013 and then fell sharply, reaching a low in \n2016. Continued spending was directed to recurrent expenditures. Contributing factors included \nthe economic crisis and the ending of the Clean Air Fund.15 \n \n13. \nIn  November  2016,  the  government  revived  the  National  Committee  on  Reducing \nEnvironmental Pollution and commissioned the national program (footnote 2), approved by the \ncabinet on 20 March 2017, and its accompanying annual implementation action plans (IAPs). In \nthe short term, the program focuses on ending the use of raw coal for heating by replacing coal \nwith cleaner briquettes and electricity. Long-term elements aim to deliver clean and more efficient \nheating services through green development. \n \n14.  Most significantly, a ban on raw coal burning by ger area households took effect from May \n2019. In place of raw coal, the government is expanding electric heating to 41,000 ger households \nand supplying less-polluting middling coal briquettes to the remaining ger area households. The \n2019 and 2020 IAPs include measures to support the production and distribution of over 600,000 \ntons  of  briquettes  for  the  2019\u20132020  winter,  with  over  400,000  tons  reported  to  already  be \nstockpiled.  Affordability  is  ensured  by  continuing  the  supply  of  free  electricity  to  ger  area \nhouseholds during winter nights, and subsidies to briquette producers. \n \n15. \nAnecdotal  evidence  indicates  that  air  quality  improved  substantially  during  the  early \nmonths of winter 2019\u20132020, following the raw coal ban. This is supported by data on air quality \n\n \n\n14 Government of Mongolia, Ministry of Health; National Center for Public Health; and UNICEF. 2017.

Ulaanbaatar. \n\n15 The Clean Air Fund was set up under the World Bank\u2019s Clean Stove Project in 2012 and financed over 60% of total \n(recurrent and investment) expenditures (an annual average of MNT16 million) related to air quality improvements \nduring the period it was in operation primarily on improved stoves. It was closed because of changes in the Law on \nGovernment Special Funds, following concerns over the misuse of such funds. \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nin  central  Ulaanbaatar,  where  the  average  PM2.5  concentration  in  October  2019  was  29 \nmicrograms per cubic meter (\u03bcg/m3), compared with 42 \u03bcg/m3 in October 2018, and 53 \u03bcg/m3 in \nOctober 2017, for a decline of 46% in 2 years.16 Unfortunately, reliable data on the impacts in ger \nareas are not available because of the limited spatial coverage of existing monitoring systems \nand discontinuities in data series. This weakness will be addressed under the policy actions for \nPhase 2. \n\n \n16. \nPhase 1. Phase 1, which was approved on 23 March 2018 and totals $130 million, with \nimplementation  through  November  2019  (footnote  1),  was  designed  to  support  key  measures \nunder the national program. Policy actions were grouped by three reform areas: (i) improving the \nefficiency of the national program and regulatory framework on air quality management, with the \nfollowing  key  policy  actions:  (a)  approving  the  national  program,  and  (b)  approving  regulatory \nmeasures, including briquette standards; (ii) implementing urgent measures to reduce air pollution \nand protect human health in Ulaanbaatar, with the following key policy actions: (a) piloting of raw \ncoal  replacement  with  the  distribution  of  80,000  tons  of  briquettes  and  (b)  piloting  of  the \npneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13)17 immunization program for 40,000 persons; and (iii) \nestablishing mechanisms for environmentally sound and integrated urban, energy, and transport \nsystems, with the following key policy actions: (a) prohibiting onsite coal-fired heat-only boilers in \nnew  public  buildings  and  (b)  a  study  on  adaptation  measures.  Phase  1  was  instrumental  in \nsupporting  a  ban  on  raw  coal  burning  through  the  piloting  of  briquettes  and  establishment  of \ntechnical standards. \n \n17. \nPhase 2 rationale and description. The continued use of policy-based lending continues \nto  be  an  appropriate  modality  given  (i)  the  impacts  and  multisectoral  nature  of  air  pollution  in \nUlaanbaatar, which is at the nexus of the energy, urban development, and health sectors; (ii) the \ncontinuing  development financing  constraints;  (iii)  the  need  for  stronger, sustained institutional \nand regulatory reforms; and (iv) the critical need for effective coordination based on community \nand women\u2019s engagement in developing measures to mitigate ambient and indoor air pollution.  \n\n \n1. \n\nReform  area  1:  Implementation  action  plan  efficiency  and  air  pollution \ncontrol regulatory framework improved.  \n\n \nTranche  1.  Prior  actions  focused  on  strengthening  the  institutional  framework  for \n18. \nimplementation of immediate mitigation measures. These were (i) the annual IAP prepared by the \nnational committee approved, which is the basis for the allocation and approval of government \nfunding for the agreed winter 2019\u20132020 actions (i.e., ensuring the supply of alternative fuels); (ii) \na proposal made to the cabinet on the establishment of a secretariat to the National Committee \nto oversee and implement the national program, ensuring that this is in place ahead of the 2020\u2013\n2021  winter  so  that  reform  momentum  continues  and  coordination  of  activities  is  further \nenhanced; and (iii) training conducted for certifiers under the Excellence In Design For Greater \nEfficiencies  (EDGE) 18  standards,  which  certify  energy-efficient  public  and  private  buildings, \nenabling them to command a premium price and creating an incentive for private developers to \nimprove energy efficiency, thus reducing the long-term growth in heating demand from new and \n\n \n\n16 US Embassy, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.  Air Quality (PM2.5 emissions concentrations recorded hourly). The October \n2019 average still exceeds the WHO guidelines by a factor of three. October marks the start of the heating season; \nair quality is at its worst in January and February.  \n\n17 The PCV13 vaccine prevents respiratory infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae which is the most frequent \ncause of pneumonia and deaths due to pneumonia worldwide. Children under 5 years of age, particularly those who \nare  affected  by  indoor  air  pollution  in  ger  households,  are  at  risk  of  death  due  to  Streptococcus  pneumoniae \ninfections. \n\n18 EDGE is an International Finance Corporation-initiated certification program for green buildings. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nretrofitted buildings, and the burning of coal. Training of certifiers is a prerequisite for its effective \nimplementation, which is a government policy. \n \n19. \nTranche 2. Policy actions are linked to enhancing the regulatory framework in the longer \nterm: (i) improvement of air quality monitoring standards to enable more effective targeting and \nevaluation  of  future  policy  measures,  (ii)  allocation  of  funding,  staff  and  premises  to make  the \nsecretariat  to  the  National  Committee  fully  functional  to  oversee  and  implement  the  national \nprogram,  and  (iii)  endorsement  of  customized  EDGE  certification  requirements  adapted  for \nMongolia\u2019s needs by the government as a recognized standard. \n \n\n2. \n\nReform  area  2:  Key  measures  on  air  pollution  reduction  and  health \nprotection implemented.  \n\n \n20. \nTranche 1. Prior actions focused on ensuring that regulatory mechanisms are in place to \ndeliver adequate and affordable alternative fuel supplies following the raw coal ban triggered by \nPhase 1. These were (i) regulations issued on briquette pricing and distribution monitoring. The \ngovernment  has  calculated  that  600,000  tons  of  improved  fuel  needs  to  be  manufactured  and \ndistributed to Ulaanbaatar residents over the winter period to compensate for the raw coal ban; \n(ii)  budget  allocated  for subsidies to allow  for the expansion  of  subsidized  heating tariffs  to  all \n41,000  ger  area  households  converting  to  electric  heaters,  which  accelerated  the  adoption  of \nelectric heaters, and consequently reduced the need for burning of raw coal; and (iii) a policy of \nnational  PCV13  immunization,  which  was  adopted  following  the  pilot  program  implemented  in \nUlaanbaatar  under  Phase  1.  This  measure  mitigated  some  of  the  worst  health  impacts  of  air \npollution and was realistic\u2014although replacing raw coal will improve air quality, it will take time to \nreach a stage where young children and pregnant mothers are no longer adversely affected. \n \n21. \nTranche  2.  Policy  actions  are  linked  to  sustaining  the  switch  to  alternative  fuels  and \nmitigation measures under tranche 1: (i) the switch to briquettes will be supported by a community \nengagement program to help households use briquettes safely and efficiently;19 (ii) a study on the \nreplacement  of  budget  subsidies for  winter  electric  heating costs  with a new  heating tariff  that \nresponds  to  affordability  concerns,  so  as  to  avoid  the  risk  of  large  and  unsustainable  budget \nsubsidies becoming entrenched; and (iii) expanding mitigation of the health impacts of pollution \nby adopting a new policy on immunization that includes pregnant women and newborns. \n \n\n3. \n\n Reform area 3: Mechanisms for environmentally sound and integrated urban \nand energy systems implemented.  \n\n \n22. \nTranche  1.  Policy  actions  focused  on  creating  long-term,  environmentally  sustainable \nheating services, and covered (i) a concept vision for the next 20-year master plan for Ulaanbaatar \napproved, including measures to support more efficient heating services; and (ii) a green financing \nmechanism established by the national committee for commercial banks to lend to low-income \nhouseholds, particularly those headed by women, for the purchase of electric heaters and building \ninsulation.  The  national  committee  has  entered  into  memoranda  of  understanding  with  State \nBank, Xac Bank, and Khan Bank wherein these banks agree to subsidize (through lower interest \nrates)  loans  to  eligible  low-income  households.  Retrofitting  existing  buildings  is  vital  to \n\n \n\n19 A communications strategy formed part of Phase 1 but was limited to social media and focused on raising awareness \nof  the  risks of  air  pollution  rather  than  specific  measures  supporting  the  transition  to improved fuels.  The  lack  of \nawareness  and  potential  acceptance  of  the  improved  fuel  by  ger  residents  is  one  of  the  main  risks  identified  to \nsuccessful  policy  implementation  and  will  be  addressed  by  the  community  engagement  program,  which  will  be \ncomplemented by quantitative assessment of the impacts of indoor air pollution to inform future actions. \n\n\f7 \n\ncomplement the  long-term replacement  of  housing  heating  systems  and  the  provision  of more \nsustainable urban spatial organization. \n \n23. \nTranche 2. Policy actions build on those under tranche 1 and cover (i) integrating specific \nclimate resilience measures, including urban adaptation measures analyzed as part of Phase 1, \ninto the next 20-year master plan for Ulaanbaatar that builds on the concept design under tranche \n1; (ii) developing an accompanying long-term clean heat supply plan for ger areas that integrates \ncommunity  and  gender  provisions  (e.g.,  safe  usage  and  adoption  of  improved  heating \ntechnologies), and identifies centralized and decentralized long-term heating solutions to reduce \nthe need for individual coal stoves; and (iii) providing loans to low-income households, particularly \nthose which are female-headed, for building insulation and heaters. \n\n \nPost-Program Partnership Framework. The government has agreed to implement the \n24. \nPPPF  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  policy  reforms  undertaken for  Phase  2.  These  include  (i) \nincreasing  access  to  air  quality  monitoring  data;  (ii)  the  secretariat  to  the  National  Committee \nassuming  its  full  mandated  responsibilities;  (iii)  raising  awareness  of  the  customized  EDGE \nstandard; (iv) improving the quality of future community engagement programs for clean heating \nneeds, particularly of women; (v) implementing necessary electricity tariff reforms; (vi) improving \nthe  integration  of  community  and  gender  dimensions  into  future  urban  planning;  and  (vii) \nexamining the potential to expand the green financing mechanism. The TA will also support the \ngovernment  in  developing  an  investment  road  map  to  implement  the  clean  heat  supply  plan, \nincluding potential projects for ADB financing.  \n\n \n25. \nADB\u2019s  experience  and  lessons.  Phase  2  has  incorporated  lessons  from  ongoing \nprojects in Mongolia and regionally, notably Phase 1 (para. 13\u201315), and air quality improvement \nprojects in the Greater Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei Region (BTH) of the People\u2019s Republic of China.20 \nPhase 1 identified gaps in monitoring arrangements and Phase 2 includes measures to upgrade \nmonitoring systems with TA support. The experience with provision of improved stoves (para. 12) \nhighlighted the need to enhance community understanding of new technologies if these are to \nsucceed; the Phase 2 actions include a community engagement program. The BTH projects show \nthat  a  sustained  process  is  needed,  starting  with  policy  reforms  and  moving  gradually  to \ninvestment projects once the policy framework is in place. The BTH experience has also shown \nthe importance of ensuring timely delivery of alternative heating supplies when ending the use of \nraw coal. These lessons are reflected in the inclusion of immediate actions that seek to ensure \nthe sufficiency of alternative electric heating and briquettes, along with a commitment to develop \nsustainable medium- to long-term solutions. \n \n26. \nComplementary ADB activities. ADB has been a leading partner of the government in \nmanaging air pollution and delivering clean energy services. In addition to the program supported \nby  the  Phase  1  PBL,  under  the  Ulaanbaatar  Green  Affordable  Housing  and  Resilient  Urban \nRenewal  Project,  ADB  is  providing  project  loan  support  for  constructing  1,500  green  social \nhousing units and establishing a funding facility for long-term financing of a further 8,500 units.  \nAs  an  input  to the  Ulaanbaatar  Urban Master  Plan,  ADB  is  piloting  the  use of  information  and \ncommunication technology tools in ger areas to improve mapping and monitoring.  \n \n27. \nADB  is  undertaking  multiple  complementary  activities  in  the  energy  sector.  At  the \ngovernment\u2019s  request,  ADB  is  supporting  a  study  to  prepare  the  country\u2019s  first  nationwide \nmethane gas supply infrastructure development strategy. ADB is also supporting the expansion \n\n20 ADB. 2018.

Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nof renewable energy supplies, including the construction of 500 kilowatts of ground heat pumps \nin rural areas, the financing of a 15-megawatt solar power plant, and TA for the development of \nan  energy  storage  deployment  strategy,  and  a  smart  energy  system.  These  activities  will  be \nintegrated into the clean heat supply plan under this Phase 2. Future investment opportunities will \nbe identified through the PPPF. The program is included in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy \nfor Mongolia, 2017\u20132020 and country operations business plan, 2020\u20132021.  \n \n28. \nAlignment with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030. The policy actions under Phase 2 are aligned with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.21 Specifically, the nationwide PCV13 rollout and the influenza immunization \nactions respond to operational priority 1: addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities. \nThe replacement of raw coal with briquettes and electric heaters and the incorporation of climate \nresilience into the Ulaanbaatar Master Plan and development of a long-term clean heat supply \nplan respond to operational priority 2: accelerating progress in gender equality, as women are \ndisproportionately  impacted  by  air  pollution  and will  directly  benefit  from  measures  to  improve \nindoor  air  quality  and  access  to  green  finance;  and  operational  priority  4:  making  cities  more \nlivable. Phase 2 contributes to Sustainable Development Goal 7: Ensure Access to Affordable, \nReliable,  Sustainable  and  Modern  Energy  for  All.  It  also  contributes  to  the  achievement  of \nMongolia\u2019s Indicative Nationally Determined Contribution, for which identified measures include \nreducing  heat  loss  from  buildings  and  reducing  fuel  use  by  individual  households.  The  total \nestimated climate financing is $71.11 million, of which $62.22 million is classified as mitigation \nand $8.89 million as adaptation. \n \n29. \nDevelopment  partner  coordination.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  program  has  been  closely \ncoordinated  with  the  activities  of  development  partners,  including  the  World  Bank,  IMF,  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Swiss \nAgency for Development and Cooperation, German development cooperation through Deutsche \nGesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Internationale  Zusammenarbeit  (GIZ),  and  United  Nations  agencies.  Activities \nbeing undertaken by partners include energy efficiency improvements for public buildings, piloting \nof  improved  fuels  and  heat  supply  technologies,  expansion  of  district  heating  networks,  and \nprograms  to  reduce  indoor  air  pollution.  The  IMF  program  includes  quantitative  targets  and \nstructural  benchmarks  that  the  government  must  meet,  with  quarterly  progress  reviews  that \ninclude  ADB  and  other  development  partners.  The  disbursement  of  financing  provided  by \ndevelopment  partners  is  linked  to  specific  agreed  actions  that  are  consistent  with  the  IMF \nprogram, but not explicitly linked to any actions therein. ADB\u2019s PBL financing has been linked to \nfinance sector reform, social welfare reform, and air pollution, ensuring that major development \nchallenges affecting the poor are not sidelined in this period of fiscal consolidation. In support of \nthe IMF program, ADB is also providing assistance to restructure and stabilize the banking sector, \nincluding the development of an industry restructuring plan and measures to improve governance, \nrisk management, and competition under the Banking Sector Rehabilitation and Financial Stability \nStrengthening Program.22 \n \nC. \n \n30. \nThe country\u2019s overarching development objectives are (i) urban air pollution reduced; and \n(ii) public health and living standards improved (footnote 2).

Mongolia: Banking Sector Rehabilitation and Financial Stability Strengthening Program. \n \n\n\f9 \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\nmanagement  in  Ulaanbaatar  improved. 23  A  program  economic  assessment  has  been \nconducted.24 The ban on burning of raw coal and the shift to middling briquettes are expected to \nreduce PM2.5 emissions for 180,000 ger area households by about 35% per household.25 A further \n41,000 ger area households are expected to eliminate coal burning entirely through the use of \nelectricity. Given that 80% of the ambient PM2.5 concentration is assumed to arise from raw coal \nburning  in  ger  areas,  these  reductions  represent  an  overall  reduction  in  winter  ambient  PM2.5 \nconcentrations of about 38%. \n \nD. \n \n31. \nFinancing needs. Mongolia\u2019s external financing needs, as defined by the IMF, total $648 \nmillion in 2019 and $712 million in 2020. Mongolia will run a slight surplus in 2019, but external \nfinancing  will  increase  to  enable  a  reduction  of  expensive  domestic  debt  and  amortization  of \nforeign debt to reduce overall debt levels. The first tranche of the PBL represents 15.4% of the \nexternal financing for this purpose. The IMF approved a 3-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) on \n24 May 2017 comprising a total financing package of $5.5 billion. This includes $434 million from \nthe IMF and is backed by development partners, including ADB ($900 million). ADB has allocated \n$600 million to policy-based lending from 2017 to 2020 in support of the EFF, with $380 million \ndisbursed to date.26 \n \nThe  government  has  requested  a  regular  loan  of  $160,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \n32. \ncapital resources to help finance Phase 2. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The proceeds of the PBL will be \nwithdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time \nto time). \n \nE. \n \n33.  MOF will serve as Phase 2\u2019s executing agency and will lead the working group established \nunder Phase 1 to oversee and coordinate the implementation of Phase 2 by the implementing \nagencies: Ministry of Environment and Tourism, Ministry of Construction and Urban Development, \nMunicipality of Ulaanbaatar, Ministry of Energy, and Ministry of Health. ADB will assess Phase 2 \nimplementation based on progress reports submitted by MOF and will field missions to confirm \nthe fulfilment of policy actions for tranche releases. ADB and development partners will closely \ncoordinate to ensure that there is no duplication of activities during implementation. \n \n34. \nPhase 2 will be provided as a stand-alone PBL to be disbursed in two tranches. The first \ntranche  of  $100  million  will  be  disbursed  upon  loan  effectiveness  and  is  linked  to  the  full \ncompliance of prior actions focused on the delivery of improved fuels and electric heating to ger \nareas as well as improving the institutional framework for delivery. Tranche 1 actions have been \nachieved. The second tranche of $60 million will be disbursed upon full compliance of prior actions \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\n23 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n24 Program Economic Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 The estimated reduction in fuel consumption from the switch to briquettes is 15%. This is equivalent to reducing the \nfuel consumption of ger households from 4.5 tons of raw coal annually to 3.8 tons of briquettes with associated lower \nspecific particulate emissions of briquettes relative to raw coal. \n\n26  This comprises $100 million under the Banking Sector Rehabilitation and Financial Stability Strengthening Program, \n$100 million under the first tranche of the Social Welfare Support Program (Phase 2,), $50 million under the second \ntranche of the Social Welfare Support Program, and $130 million under Phase 1. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nfocused  on  medium-  to  long-term  cleaner  heating  solutions  in  ger  areas.  Phase  2  will  be \nimplemented from 1 May 2019 to 30 September 2020. The first tranche will be implemented from \n1  May  2019  to  15  November  2019,  and  the  second  tranche  will  be  implemented  from  16 \nNovember to 30 September 2020. \n \n\nIII. \n\nATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n35. \nThe government  will  require  TA to  implement  key  elements  of  Phase 2 and the  PPPF, \nwhere internal capacity is limited. The major outputs of the TA include (i) climate adaptation, urban \nresilience, and gender and community dimensions incorporated in the Ulaanbaatar master plan; (ii) \nclean  heat  supply  plan  for  ger  areas  developed;  (iii)  study  on  longer-term  electric  heating  tariff \nstructures conducted; (iv) indoor air pollution impact assessment conducted; (v) opportunities for \nscaling  up  and  expanding  the  green  financing  mechanism  recommended;  and  (vi)  gender  and \ncommunity engagement plan developed.27 TA implementation is from the date of approval to 30 \nSeptember 2021. \n \nThe TA is estimated to cost $800,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant basis \n36. \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The government will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of counterpart staff, domestic transportation, data collection, logistical support \nin arranging workshops and field visits, and other in-kind contributions. ADB will administer the \nTA. ADB will engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions. \nADB will also engage resource persons during the implementation period. \n \n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($\u2018000) \n\nItem \nAsian Development Banka \n\nAmount \n \n\nInternational and local travel \n\nIndoor air quality monitoringc \n\nInternational consultants (12 person-months) \n\ni. \nii.

The potential environmental and social impacts of \nthe  proposed  policy  reforms  have  been  assessed.28 Program  activities  are  confined  to  policy \nreforms. None of the policy actions will result in or lead to involuntary resettlement or adversely \naffect indigenous peoples. No adverse environmental impacts have been identified. Phase 2 is \nclassified category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. Phase \n2 will result in improved air quality, which will positively impact public health and well-being. There \nis  a  potential  reduction  in  incomes  for  people  engaged  in  distributing  raw  coal;  mitigating \nmeasures, including their incorporation into new supply chains, have been established. \n \n38. \nGender. The negative impacts of air pollution fall disproportionately on women. Pregnant \nwomen are severely affected by Ulaanbaatar\u2019s air pollution, while women are more vulnerable to \nindoor air pollution from their roles in cooking in and heating homes and their dominance among \nhealth and education employees who are exposed to indoor air pollution in public facilities. Air \npollution also has a major negative effect on gender equality. It increases the unpaid labor burden \nof women in caring for sick household members and for cleaning and laundry, and reduces their \nability to undertake paid work and pursue professional careers. Phase 2 has been categorized by \nADB  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming,  and  the  policy  matrix  includes  the  following  gender \nmeasures:  (i)  at  least  40%  female  participation  in  EDGE  training;  (ii)  at  least  40%  female \nparticipation in the proposed community engagement program in terms of working with women\u2019s \ngroups  and  household  beneficiaries;  (iii)  sex-disaggregated  evidence  of  impacts  on  indoor  air \npollution collected; (iv) gender dimensions (e.g., safe usage and adoption of improved heating \ntechnologies) incorporated into clean heat supply plan; and (v) preferential access for women to \nthe green financing mechanism. \n \n39. \nGovernance.  Procyclical  fiscal  management,  optimistic  revenue  forecasts,  and  the \nmisalignment of public expenditure and strategic priorities are major public financial management \nchallenges in Mongolia. This PBL is part of development partners\u2019 collaborative efforts under the \nIMF EFF framework; the EFF program will improve public financial management by (i) working \nwith the government to significantly curtail off-budget expenditures, (ii) creating a fiscal council to \nprovide independent budget forecasts and cost estimates for new policy proposals, (iii) allowing \nthe  government  sole  authority  to  determine  the  total  budget  spending,  and  (iv)  granting  MOF \nauthority  to  approve  cabinet  proposals  that  have  a  budgetary  cost.  For  Phase  2,  MOF  is \nresponsible for ensuring that financial commitments are included as budget line items in the state \nbudget and will ensure that the policy actions are implemented by the implementing agencies. \n \n40. \nCorruption.  Major  corruption  risks  include  weak  institutions  and  enforcement,  lack  of \ncapacity of integrity institutions, political interference, lack of transparency and accountability, and \nconflicts of interest. Policy actions under the IMF-led program and monitoring indicators ensure \nstrict  compliance  with  program  objectives,  thus  minimizing  risks.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government.  \n \n41. \nin Table 2 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.29 \n \n\nRisks and mitigating measures.
