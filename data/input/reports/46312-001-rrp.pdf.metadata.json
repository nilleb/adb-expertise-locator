I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Mongolia for the Payment System Modernization Project.1  \n \n2.  The proposed project will deliver four outputs to modernize the payment system in \nMongolia.  It  will  (i)  strengthen  interbank  payment  system  infrastructure,  (ii)  upgrade  retail \npayments  infrastructure  and  support  systems,  (iii)  provide  technical  support  and  external \nservices, and (iv) establish the legal and regulatory framework. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The financial system in Mongolia comprises 14 commercial banks \u2013 one state-owned \nwhile the rest are privately owned. Banks control more than 96% of the financial sector\u2019s overall \nassets, with the remainder shared by nonbank financial institutions.2 The top five banks account \nfor  87%  of  total  banking  assets.  Loans  are  the  primary  source  of  banking  revenues  and \nrepresent 50% of total assets. Approximately 65% of lending goes to the trade, construction, \nreal  estate,  mining,  and  manufacturing  sectors.  About  80%  of  the  loans  are  extended  to \nborrowers in Ulaanbaatar, the capital and main urban center, and 90% small and medium-sized \nenterprises do not have adequate access to finance. Part of the reason why Mongolia\u2019s financial \nsector is highly concentrated in urban centers, and unable to serve the rural population and \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises, is due to its antiquated payment system. The rugged \nterrain and limited availability of transport make it costly for financial institutions to extend and \nmaintain their mainly cash-based services in remote and sparsely populated rural areas. As a \nresult, Mongolia suffers from urban-rural disparities and is one of the countries where inequality \nhas increased over time. \n \n4.  An  efficient  payment  system  that  has  an  appropriate  interbank  and  retail  payment \ninfrastructure in place is critical to the functioning of the financial markets. Reducing the cost of \nfinancial service delivery through branchless banking, and use of noncash payment methods \nthrough mobile phones, enhance access to finance by the poor. It is also recognized that a \ndisruption in the operation of the payment system can precipitate a systemic crisis in the \nfinancial system itself. Challenges for Mongolia\u2019s payment system include the need to improve \naccessibility to the rural and poor population; lower the cost of processing; resolve fragmented \nservices through upgrading and standardization; address security risks; and update the legal \nand regulatory framework. \n \n5.  Current payment system. The current payment system was built with support from the \nWorld Bank under its Financial Capacity Development Project, completed in 2009. The project \nhelped establish the switch clearing center, now known as the National Electronic Transaction \nCenter (NETC), and the real-time gross settlement3 (RTGS) system. The RTGS (also known as \nthe  core  banking  system  or  general  ledger  system)  forms  the  backbone  of  the  interbank \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  This includes 212 microfinance companies, 148 savings and credit cooperatives, 18 insurance companies, and 95 \nsecurities and/or brokerage firms in 2012. \n3  The RTGS supports high-value transactions of MNT1 million or more in real time. \n ", "2 \npayments or wholesale banking infrastructure along with the central bank accounting system4 \nand the central bank bills system.5  \n \n6.  The NETC administers the financial transfer switch (FTS) that is based on the Bevertec \nESP-Link/FTS software. This forms the core of the retail payment infrastructure. However, the \nlow-value payments system (LVPS)6 uses the FTS to clear transactions on a net settlement \nbasis.7 The LVPS was developed in-house by the Bank of Mongolia (BOM), the country\u2019s \ncentral bank. The FTS covers electronic fund transfers at point-of-sale or ATM switching. The \nNETC also launched an interbank payment card switch to promote noncash economic activities \nby providing integrated interbank payment card processing. Prior to this, three commercial \nbanks were providing card services through their own networks. Because their point-of-sale \nterminals were not compatible, merchants were required to install three different point-of-sale \nterminals if they wanted to accept all three cards. To solve this lack of interoperability, the NETC \nundertook a joint project with the banks to consolidate the private bank networks and provide a \nsingle system for processing all card transactions.  \n \n7.  Challenges.  The  modernization  of  the  payments  system  component  was  rated \nsatisfactory  in  the  Project  Completion  Report  of  the  World  Bank's  Financial  Capacity \n \nDevelopment Project. It was clear to BOM that even before completion of the project in 2009, \nthe payment system would need further development to overcome technical limitations, and \naddress market requirements and policy issues as they evolved.8 The system will need to meet \nworldwide industry standards for availability, i.e., it must be available 99.98% of the time on an \nannual  basis,  and  the  system  components  used  must  meet  planned  objectives,  including \nfinancial inclusion. The impetus for modernizing the current payment system is derived from the \nfollowing:  \n \n(i)  Evolving  market  needs.  Payment  transactions  are  rising  rapidly.  Card \npayments have more than doubled since 2009. \n(ii)  High cost of processing. The per-transaction processing cost of the existing \nsystem was estimated at about MNT233 in 2010, compared with the equivalent \nof about MNT12 in the Republic of Korea.  \n(iii)  Difficulty of access for the country\u2019s rural population, including many of \nthe poor. While Mongolia has one of the highest bank branch penetration rates \nin the world based on population (with 54 branches per 100,000 adults), branch \npenetration  in  geographical  terms,  given  its  more  than  1.56  million  square \nkilometers  of  land  area,  is  one  of  the  lowest.  Advances  in  communications \ntechnology,  and  the  high  current  and  projected  levels  of  communications \nconnectivity in the country, presents Mongolia with the opportunity to provide \nremote areas access with high-tech access to financial services.  \n(iv)  Limitations of current software. Neither the central bank accounting system \nnor  the  central  bank  bills  system  allows  for  collateral  management,  or  the \npledging of such securities as government issues, to collateralize transactions by \nbanks within the payments system. This exposes banks to avoidable settlement \nrisks. With the exception of the US dollar and the Chinese yuan, the central bank \n                                                \n4  A simple system developed in-house for exchanging of US dollars and Chinese yuan for togrogs. \n5  A book entry system for the trading and auctioning of central bank bills and treasury bills and bonds. \n6  The LVPS covers transactions of less than MNT1 million. \n7  At the end of each business day, the NETC calculates the net position and sends the final settlement data to the \nRTGS. \n8  Before the close of the World Bank project, a payment systems consultant worked closely with the BOM to identify \ntechnical limitations and policy issues that need to be further addressed.  \n ", "3 \naccounting system does not register trades or the transfer of reserves between \nmember  banks  made  in  foreign  currencies.  The  LVPS,  being  an  in-house \nproduct, does not provide for direct debits. The general ledger system is also \noutdated and needs to be replaced.  \n(v)  Incompatible and competing payment platforms. Financial solutions providers \nand mobile network operators have set up their own mobile payments systems. A \nnumber of banks have also implemented proprietary closed-loop mobile financial \nservices systems. This will lead to a fragmentation in the services within the \npayments system that could prove costly and constrain future expansion and \ndevelopment.  It  is  critical  that  a  common  platform  is  set  up  that  ensures \ninteroperability between competing systems. \n(vi)  System-wide financial risk posed by payment system weaknesses. BOM \nhas recognized that a disruption in the operation of the payment system could \nprecipitate a systemic crisis in the overall financial system.  \n(vii)  Lack of standardization. New products and services are being introduced and \nproposed. However, for better control and ease of use, these service systems \nneed to be standardized, so that financial organizations and companies avoid \nduplication of investments and unnecessary expenses.  \n(viii)  Outdated  legal  and  regulatory  framework.  The  framework  needs  to  be \nupdated  to  cover  the  new  and  planned  operations,  protect  consumers,  and \nstrengthen the oversight capabilities of the BOM. This includes the need for \nbanks and other payments system participants to implement rules designed to \ncombat money laundering and the financing of terrorism through such steps as \n\u2018know-your-customer\u2019  procedures  and  other  customer  due  diligence.  This  is \nparticularly important in light of the expected increase on the use of noncash fund \ntransfers in the country. \n(ix)  Inadequate  coordination.  In  addition  to  BOM,  the  Financial  Regulatory \nCommission, which oversees the operation of nonbank financial institutions, and \nthe  Information  Communications  Technology  and  Post  Authority,  which \nimplements an e-signature law and related laws and regulations governing e-\ncommerce, are also involved in managing the various facets of the payment and \nsettlement operations. Inefficiencies may occur if there is no clear delineation of \nroles among relevant authorities. \n \n8.  Government objective. The project is in response to a request by the Government of \nMongolia to support its aim of modernizing the country\u2019s payment system. The government\u2019s \ngoal is to provide cost-effective, up-to-date payment infrastructure and schemes that will meet \nthe current and future needs of the government, business, and individual consumers. The \ngovernment also wants to provide citizens located in remote and inaccessible areas access to \nsecure, reliable, efficient financial services, regardless of their geographic location or income \nlevel.  Providing  an  effective  payment  system  that  facilitates  fund  transfers  and  access  to \nliquidity is a core requirement for the development of Mongolia\u2019s financial market.9  \n \n9.  Consistency with government and ADB strategy. The project is consistent with the \ngovernment\u2019s national development strategy, which is based on the Millennium Development \nGoals, and calls for the strengthening of the financial and banking systems and services. The \n                                                \n9  The modernized payment system in Mongolia will conform to the core principles for systemically important \npayments  system  developed  by  the  Bank  for  International  Settlements  (Principles  for  Financial  Market \nInfrastructures) by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and the Technical Committee of the \nInternational Organization of Securities Commissions, in April 2012. \n ", "4 \ngovernment has made the development of the payment system a priority for 2013. The project \nis  consistent  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  country  partnership  strategy  for \nMongolia 2012\u20132016,10 which seeks to promote financial inclusiveness and sustainable growth; \naddress  infrastructure  gaps,  especially  those  limiting  connectivity;  support  innovation;  and \nprovide access to finance and basic services. The project pursues financial sector development, \none of ADB\u2019s core areas of operation under Strategy 2020.11 The project will build on ADB\u2019s \nexperience and lessons from its previous operations in Mongolia\u2019s financial markets, including \nareas in microfinance and micro-insurance, mobile and branchless banking, financial market \ninfrastructure, capital market, and regulatory and supervisory framework. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact of the project will be modern payment services that are available throughout \nMongolia and easily accessible even by citizens who live in distant rural areas or abroad, or are \nnot clients of a bank.12 \n  \n11.  The outcome will be establishment of a national full-service payments system that is \nefficient and affordable by poor individual. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  Based  on  an  analysis  of  the  available  technologies  and  the  current  payments \ninfrastructure needs in Mongolia, particularly those related to deficiencies and the objectives of \nthe BOM, the project outputs will build on the existing systems. They will be achieved through \nthe use of packaged application software that can be installed on common platforms, are user-\nfriendly for implementation, operationally stable, and based on widely accepted technologies \nthat conform to international standards. The project will retain the existing RTGS and FTS but \nexpand their capabilities. The outputs will comprise the following:  \n \n(i)  Interbank payment system infrastructure strengthened. This system is the \nbackbone of the wholesale banking structure and the conduit for the clearing and \nsettlement  of  all  interbank  and  payment  service  provider  transactions.  The \nstrengthening provided by the project will bring the system into compliance with \nthe core principles of the Bank for International Settlements. \n(ii)  Retail payments infrastructure and support systems upgraded. The upgrade \nwill make it possible to increase system transparency, reduce the use of cash in \nthe retail system, and significantly increase financial inclusion. It will support safe \nand  secure  electronic  payments,  providing  security,  authorization,  non-\nrepudiation and authentication functions for internet, and mobile network banking \ntransactions. It will also provide high availability and disaster recovery to ensure \nthe resilience and integrity of electronic payments.  \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2012.

It  does  this  by  improving  efficiencies  in  commerce  that  contribute  to  increased \nconsumption, production, and job creation, which expands personal incomes and generates further growth. The \nstudy estimated that global gross domestic product grew by 0.2% per year, more than it would have otherwise due \nto electronic card usage. M. Zandi and V. Signh. 2010.

The project will support \ncapacity development and help the project implementation unit (PIU) to be set up \nin the BOM implement the project efficiently. It will also ensure that the new \nservices will be utilized by building capacity and raising awareness of the system \nparticipants.13  \n(iv)  Legal and regulatory framework established. The framework will allow system \nparticipants  to  expand  services.  It  will  enable  interoperability  among  banks, \nbranchless  banking,  and  secure  mobile  financial  services;  ensure  consumer \nprotection; police against money laundering and the financing of terrorism; and \nprevent systemic failure to settle.  \n \nD.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The  BOM  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  the  Payment  System  and  Accounting \nDepartment of the BOM will implement the project. The executing agency will be assisted by \nproject implementation consultants for project management, implementation, and institutional \ncapacity building. The BOM has formed a steering committee headed by its deputy governor to \noversee the project implementation process and performance, provide policy guidance, and \ncoordinate with other government ministries and agencies concerned. The committee will also \ncoordinate with stakeholders, including the participating banks and mobile network operators. \nThe steering committee will be composed of all the department heads at the BOM involved in \nthe payments system. Representatives of other key stakeholders may also be appointed as \nmembers.  \n \n16.  The steering committee will be assisted by an advisory committee from the National \nCouncil of Payment and Settlement System, composed mainly of representatives from BOM, \nthe commercial banks, the Financial Regulatory Commission, the Information Communications \nTechnology and Post Authority, the Ministry of Finance, the Mongolian Securities Clearing \nHouse and Central Depository, and mobile network operators. To manage the project and \ncoordinate with consultants and external service providers in the procurement of goods and \nworks, a PIU has been organized by the BOM. The PIU will be headed by a project director and \nwill  comprise  of  full-time  core  staff,  including  a  project  office  coordinator,  three  project \nmanagers, a payment systems specialist, an information technology specialist, and a mobile \npayment systems specialist. The PIU project manager will report to the project director (director \nof NETC), who will guide and supervise the work of the PIU. The project director will report to \nthe  steering  committee.  BOM  will  set  up  a  bid  evaluation  committee  to  prepare  the  bid \nevaluation criteria, rate proposals received, and make decisions for awarding contracts for \nproject components. The bid evaluation committee will be composed of representatives from the \nBOM,  other  government  ministries  as  needed,  various  stakeholders,  as  well  as  technical \nexperts and third party experts.  \n ", "7 \n \n17.  All procurement of goods and works to be financed by the ADB loan will be undertaken \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time) and \nthe Public Procurement Law of Mongolia (2004). All consultants engaged under the ADB loan \nwill be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time). The project administration manual defines the road map and \nmilestones,  activity  timetable,  and  personnel  requirements,  including  project  performance \nmonitoring,  review,  and  evaluation,  as  well  as  reporting  requirements.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n18.  Technical consultants assessed the technical viability of the project and concluded that \nthe project is feasible due to the following factors: (i) the BOM has carried out projects of similar \ncomplexity and has the required skills in-house; (ii) the technology used to support the new \npayment systems components is already being used in Mongolia, i.e., the mobile network \noperators and banks have the experience required to support the implementation of the mobile \nfinancial services required; (iii) the participant banks are already connected to the RTGS, the \nLVPS, and the BOM FTS, i.e., the integration experience is available; and (iv) the largest \nuncertainty under the project is achievement of the mandated interoperability. Moreover, the \nNational Council of Payment and Settlement System has already included payment system \ninteroperability  in  its  road  map  for  payment  system  development.  Consequently,  the \nimplementation of the interoperable mobile payment system will be assured. \n                                                \n14 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n19.  The project is economically and financially viable, with an estimated economic rate of \nreturn of 26.1% and an estimated financial internal rate of return of 15.6%. Poor access to \nfinance and high costs of financing are the most critical constraints to enterprise development. \nThe project is addressing both constraints by linking distant rural areas to the payments system \nand sources of finance through the use of more advanced technology. The project will also \nreduce banking costs as banks shift from the bricks-and-mortar branch banking to electronic \ntransfers. The system modernization will improve the efficiency of doing business through e-\ncommerce. The move to less dependence on cash will reduce risk for the population and cost of \nprinting, carrying, and storing currency. The project will allow the government to make salary \nand social  welfare payments more efficiently, minimizing administration costs. Benefits not \ndirectly quantifiable will include improved liquidity in the financial system as funds flow more \nefficiently and the greater financial stability provided by more secure and reliable payment \nmechanisms.  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n20.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  BOM.  Mongolia  passed  an  Anti-Corruption  Law  in  2006.  In \nJanuary  2007,  the  government  created  the  Independent  Authority  Against  Corruption  that \nreports to parliament. In August 2007, the Criminal Procedures Code was amended and the \nIndependent Authority Against Corruption was added to the list of state bodies authorized to \nconduct investigations. The role of the public council within the Independent Authority Against \nCorruption, which is intended to ensure effective participation of civil society in the process, has \nbeen strengthened under the current government. The BOM has implemented World Bank \nprojects in the past and arrangements for the internal funds flow have been found to be \nsatisfactory. The BOM has capable staff, adequate internal controls, and a reliable and secure \nfinancial reporting system. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, \nand transparency, the BOM will institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and \ncontrols consistent with international best practices to prevent corruption, money laundering, or \nthe financing of terrorism. \n \nD.   Poverty and Social \n21.  An estimated one-third of Mongolia\u2019s people live below the poverty line. A poverty \nassessment by ADB pointed to limited access to finance as one of the factors contributing to \npoverty. Mongolia suffers from urban-rural disparities, and income inequality has been growing. \nThe costs  of  providing a  traditional  banking  presence  and financial  intermediation  through \nbranches in the remote sparsely populated rural areas where many of the poor live have been \nprohibitive. The use of mobile phone payments and other forms of electronic noncash payments \ncan deliver financial services, including microfinance, to the poor through branchless banking \nand reduce the cost of transferring funds and other financial transactions. A more efficient \npayment system can reduce the high cost of doing business and conducting commerce in \nMongolia. A national payments system can help assimilate the country\u2019s informal market into \nthe formal market, since identity and authentication mechanisms will be necessary under the \nnew system. \n \n22.  Many of the poor are rural women. The proportion of the country\u2019s households that are \nheaded by women rose from about 17.0% during 2004\u20132006 to about 28.5% in 2008, according \nto World Bank data. Any positive impact on the poor by the project would therefore likely benefit \n ", "9 \nwomen. Women face no legal barriers to accessing loans. More than 50% of borrowers at XAC \nBank are women. Consequently, women are likely to benefit along with men from an expansion \nof and better access to microfinance in the rural areas. The project is deemed to have a positive \ngender impact but has no specific gender elements in its design.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n23.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement  under  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). It will likely not involve involuntary land acquisition or \nrestriction of access to lands that will result in the physical and/or economic displacement of \npeople. The project is classified as category C for indigenous peoples under the Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. The project activities are unlikely to result in any direct or indirect impacts on \nindigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  C  for  environment.  ADB  has \ndetermined that the project will have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n24.  The  key  assumptions  for  successful  project  implementation  are  continued  financial \nsystem stability and continued government support, especially from the BOM. The technical \nsupport and external services to be provided under the project are intended to help the BOM \nprepare the request for proposals, choose vendors, and set up the system and its components. \nThe technologies being recommended are proven and the vendors are well-known and well-\nestablished. Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment \nand risk management plan.15 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nSupport from senior BOM management  ADB has been keeping BOM management fully briefed to \nmay not be continuous.  ensure that there is agreement on the project concepts, \nand that continuous support is provided. \nStakeholders, including MNOs and  ADB has been keeping the NPC, the participating banks, \nparticipating banks, may not support the  and MNOs duly briefed to ensure that they buy into the \nproject design and may not provide  project concepts, strategies, and support implementation \ncontinuous support during implementation.  arrangements. \nSolutions provided for the system may not  PIU is to select the evaluation team carefully, to ensure \nmeet the project requirements.  that the project requirements are fully understood, to train \nevaluators, and to monitor the evaluation process closely. \nParticipating banks and MNOs may not be  BOM is inviting participating banks and MNOs in work \nready to participate in the project system.  groups at the onset to ensure that all stakeholders are \nfully aware of what is required in terms of integration and \nconnectivity. \nDifficulties are encountered in the  BOM is tasked to ensure that the required interfaces use \nintegration of the fragmented electronic  existing industry standards, and that all interfaces to \npayment systems operated by individual  existing participating systems and MNO services are \nbanks.
