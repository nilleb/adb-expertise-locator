It  will  (i)  strengthen  interbank  payment  system  infrastructure,  (ii)  upgrade  retail \npayments  infrastructure  and  support  systems,  (iii)  provide  technical  support  and  external \nservices, and (iv) establish the legal and regulatory framework. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nThe  financial  system  in  Mongolia  comprises  14  commercial  banks  \u2013  one  state-owned \nwhile the rest are privately owned. Banks control more than 96% of the financial sector\u2019s overall \nassets, with the remainder shared by nonbank financial institutions.2 The top five banks account \nfor  87%  of  total  banking  assets.  Loans  are  the  primary  source  of  banking  revenues  and \nrepresent  50%  of  total  assets.  Approximately  65%  of  lending  goes  to  the  trade,  construction, \nreal  estate,  mining,  and  manufacturing  sectors.  About  80%  of  the  loans  are  extended  to \nborrowers in Ulaanbaatar, the capital and main urban center, and 90% small and medium-sized \nenterprises do not have adequate access to finance. Part of the reason why Mongolia\u2019s financial \nsector  is  highly  concentrated  in  urban  centers,  and  unable  to  serve  the  rural  population  and \nsmall  and  medium-sized  enterprises,  is  due  to  its  antiquated  payment  system.  The  rugged \nterrain and limited availability of transport make it costly for financial institutions to extend and \nmaintain their  mainly  cash-based  services  in remote  and  sparsely  populated  rural  areas.  As a \nresult, Mongolia suffers from urban-rural disparities and is one of the countries where inequality \nhas increased over time. \n \n4. \nAn  efficient  payment  system  that  has  an  appropriate  interbank  and  retail  payment \ninfrastructure in place is critical to the functioning of the financial markets. Reducing the cost of \nfinancial  service  delivery  through  branchless  banking,  and  use  of  noncash  payment  methods \nthrough  mobile  phones,  enhance  access  to  finance  by  the  poor.  It  is  also  recognized  that  a \ndisruption  in  the  operation  of  the  payment  system  can  precipitate  a  systemic  crisis  in  the \nfinancial system itself. Challenges for Mongolia\u2019s payment system include the need to improve \naccessibility to the rural and poor population; lower the cost of processing; resolve fragmented \nservices  through  upgrading  and  standardization;  address  security  risks;  and  update  the  legal \nand regulatory framework. \n \n5. \nCurrent payment system. The current payment system was built with support from the \nWorld Bank under its Financial Capacity Development Project, completed in 2009. The project \nhelped establish the switch clearing center, now known as the National Electronic Transaction \nCenter (NETC), and the real-time gross settlement3 (RTGS) system. The RTGS (also known as \nthe  core  banking  system  or  general  ledger  system)  forms  the  backbone  of  the  interbank \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  This includes 212 microfinance companies, 148 savings and credit cooperatives, 18 insurance companies, and 95 \n\nsecurities and/or brokerage firms in 2012. \n\n3  The RTGS supports high-value transactions of MNT1 million or more in real time. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\npayments  or  wholesale  banking  infrastructure  along  with  the  central  bank  accounting  system4 \nand the central bank bills system.5  \n\n \n6. \nThe NETC administers the financial transfer switch (FTS) that is based on the Bevertec \nESP-Link/FTS software. This forms the core of the retail payment infrastructure. However, the \nlow-value  payments  system  (LVPS)6  uses  the  FTS  to  clear  transactions  on  a  net  settlement \nbasis.7  The  LVPS  was  developed  in-house  by  the  Bank  of  Mongolia  (BOM),  the  country\u2019s \ncentral  bank.  The  FTS  covers  electronic fund transfers  at  point-of-sale or  ATM  switching. The \nNETC also launched an interbank payment card switch to promote noncash economic activities \nby  providing  integrated  interbank  payment  card  processing.  Prior  to  this,  three  commercial \nbanks  were  providing  card  services  through  their  own  networks.  Because  their  point-of-sale \nterminals  were  not  compatible,  merchants  were  required  to  install  three  different  point-of-sale \nterminals if they wanted to accept all three cards. To solve this lack of interoperability, the NETC \nundertook a joint project with the banks to consolidate the private bank networks and provide a \nsingle system for processing all card transactions.  \n\n \nChallenges.  The  modernization  of  the  payments  system  component  was  rated \n7. \nsatisfactory  in  the  Project  Completion  Report  of  the  World  Bank's  Financial  Capacity \nDevelopment Project. It was clear to BOM that even  before completion of the project in 2009, \nthe  payment  system  would  need  further  development  to  overcome  technical  limitations,  and \naddress market requirements and policy issues as they evolved.8 The system will need to meet \nworldwide industry standards for availability, i.e., it must be available 99.98% of the time on an \nannual  basis,  and  the  system  components  used  must  meet  planned  objectives,  including \nfinancial inclusion. The impetus for modernizing the current payment system is derived from the \nfollowing:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\ntransactions  are  rising  rapidly.  Card \n\nEvolving  market  needs.  Payment \npayments have more than doubled since 2009. \nHigh  cost  of  processing.  The  per-transaction  processing  cost  of  the  existing \nsystem was estimated at about MNT233 in 2010, compared with the equivalent \nof about MNT12 in the Republic of Korea.  \nDifficulty  of  access  for  the  country\u2019s  rural  population,  including  many  of \nthe poor. While Mongolia has one of the highest bank branch penetration rates \nin the world based on population (with 54 branches per 100,000 adults), branch \npenetration  in  geographical  terms,  given  its  more  than  1.56  million  square \nkilometers  of  land  area,  is  one  of  the  lowest.  Advances  in  communications \ntechnology,  and  the  high  current  and  projected  levels  of  communications \nconnectivity  in  the  country,  presents  Mongolia  with  the  opportunity  to  provide \nremote areas access with high-tech access to financial services.  \nLimitations  of  current  software.  Neither  the  central  bank  accounting  system \nnor  the  central  bank  bills  system  allows  for  collateral  management,  or  the \npledging of such securities as government issues, to collateralize transactions by \nbanks within the payments system. This exposes banks to avoidable settlement \nrisks. With the exception of the US dollar and the Chinese yuan, the central bank \n\n                                                \n4  A simple system developed in-house for exchanging of US dollars and Chinese yuan for togrogs. \n5  A book entry system for the trading and auctioning of central bank bills and treasury bills and bonds. \n6  The LVPS covers transactions of less than MNT1 million. \n7  At the end of each business day, the NETC calculates the net position and sends the final settlement data to the \n\n8  Before the close of the World Bank project, a payment systems consultant worked closely with the BOM to identify \n\ntechnical limitations and policy issues that need to be further addressed.  \n\nRTGS. \n\n \n\n\faccounting  system  does  not  register  trades or the transfer  of  reserves between \nmember  banks  made  in  foreign  currencies.  The  LVPS,  being  an  in-house \nproduct,  does  not  provide  for  direct  debits.  The  general  ledger  system  is  also \noutdated and needs to be replaced.  \nIncompatible and competing payment platforms. Financial solutions providers \nand mobile network operators have set up their own mobile payments systems. A \nnumber of banks have also implemented proprietary closed-loop mobile financial \nservices  systems.  This  will  lead  to  a  fragmentation  in  the  services  within  the \npayments  system  that  could  prove  costly  and  constrain  future  expansion  and \ndevelopment.  It  is  critical  that  a  common  platform  is  set  up  that  ensures \ninteroperability between competing systems. \nSystem-wide  financial  risk  posed  by  payment  system  weaknesses.  BOM \nhas  recognized  that  a  disruption  in  the  operation  of  the  payment  system  could \nprecipitate a systemic crisis in the overall financial system.  \nLack of standardization. New products and services are being introduced and \nproposed.  However,  for  better  control  and  ease  of  use,  these  service  systems \nneed  to  be  standardized,  so  that  financial  organizations  and  companies  avoid \nduplication of investments and unnecessary expenses.  \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii)  Outdated  legal  and  regulatory  framework.  The  framework  needs  to  be \nupdated  to  cover  the  new  and  planned  operations,  protect  consumers,  and \nstrengthen  the  oversight  capabilities  of  the  BOM.  This  includes  the  need  for \nbanks  and  other  payments  system  participants  to  implement  rules  designed  to \ncombat money  laundering  and the financing  of terrorism  through such  steps  as \n\u2018know-your-customer\u2019  procedures  and  other  customer  due  diligence.  This  is \nparticularly important in light of the expected increase on the use of noncash fund \ntransfers in the country. \nInadequate  coordination.  In  addition  to  BOM,  the  Financial  Regulatory \nCommission, which oversees the operation of nonbank financial institutions, and \nInformation  Communications  Technology  and  Post  Authority,  which \nthe \nimplements  an  e-signature  law  and  related  laws  and  regulations  governing  e-\ncommerce, are also involved in managing the various facets of the payment and \nsettlement operations. Inefficiencies may occur if there is no clear delineation of \nroles among relevant authorities. \n\n(ix) \n\n \n8. \nGovernment  objective.  The  project  is  in response  to a  request  by  the Government of \nMongolia  to  support  its  aim  of  modernizing  the  country\u2019s  payment  system.  The  government\u2019s \ngoal is to provide cost-effective, up-to-date payment infrastructure and schemes that will meet \nthe  current  and  future  needs  of  the  government,  business,  and  individual  consumers.  The \ngovernment also wants to provide citizens located in remote and inaccessible areas access to \nsecure,  reliable,  efficient  financial  services,  regardless  of  their  geographic  location  or  income \nlevel.  Providing  an  effective  payment  system  that  facilitates  fund  transfers  and  access  to \nliquidity is a core requirement for the development of Mongolia\u2019s financial market.9  \n\n \nConsistency  with  government  and  ADB  strategy.  The  project  is  consistent  with  the \n9. \ngovernment\u2019s  national  development  strategy,  which  is  based  on  the  Millennium  Development \nGoals,  and  calls for  the strengthening  of  the financial  and banking  systems  and services. The \n\n                                                \n9  The  modernized  payment  system  in  Mongolia  will  conform  to  the  core  principles  for  systemically  important \npayments  system  developed  by  the  Bank  for  International  Settlements  (Principles  for  Financial  Market \nInfrastructures)  by  the  Committee  on  Payment  and  Settlement  Systems  and  the  Technical  Committee  of  the \nInternational Organization of Securities Commissions, in April 2012. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\ngovernment has made the development of the payment system a priority for 2013. The project \nis  consistent  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  country  partnership  strategy  for \nMongolia 2012\u20132016,10 which seeks to promote financial inclusiveness and sustainable growth; \naddress  infrastructure  gaps,  especially  those  limiting  connectivity;  support  innovation;  and \nprovide access to finance and basic services. The project pursues financial sector development, \none  of  ADB\u2019s  core  areas  of  operation  under  Strategy  2020.11  The  project  will  build  on  ADB\u2019s \nexperience and lessons from its previous operations in  Mongolia\u2019s financial markets, including \nareas  in  microfinance  and  micro-insurance,  mobile  and  branchless  banking,  financial  market \ninfrastructure, capital market, and regulatory and supervisory framework. \n \nB. \n \nThe impact of the project will be modern payment services that are available throughout \n10. \nMongolia and easily accessible even by citizens who live in distant rural areas or abroad, or are \nnot clients of a bank.12 \n  \n11. \nefficient and affordable by poor individual. \n \nC. \n \n12. \nBased  on  an  analysis  of  the  available  technologies  and  the  current  payments \ninfrastructure needs in Mongolia, particularly those related to deficiencies and the objectives of \nthe BOM, the project outputs will build on the existing  systems. They will be achieved through \nthe use of packaged application software that can be installed on common platforms, are user-\nfriendly  for  implementation,  operationally  stable,  and  based  on  widely  accepted  technologies \nthat conform to international standards. The project will retain the existing RTGS and FTS but \nexpand their capabilities. The outputs will comprise the following:  \n \n\nThe  outcome  will  be  establishment  of  a  national  full-service  payments  system  that  is \n\nOutputs \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nInterbank  payment  system  infrastructure  strengthened.  This  system  is  the \nbackbone of the wholesale banking structure and the conduit for the clearing and \nsettlement  of  all  interbank  and  payment  service  provider  transactions.  The \nstrengthening provided by the project will bring the system into compliance with \nthe core principles of the Bank for International Settlements. \nRetail payments infrastructure and support systems upgraded. The upgrade \nwill make it possible to increase system transparency, reduce the use of cash in \nthe retail system, and significantly increase financial inclusion. It will support safe \nand  secure  electronic  payments,  providing  security,  authorization,  non-\nrepudiation and authentication functions for internet, and mobile network banking \ntransactions. It will also provide high availability and disaster recovery to ensure \nthe resilience and integrity of electronic payments.  \n\n                                                \n10 ADB. 2012.

The financing plan is in Table 2. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nAmount ($ million) \n\n \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \n \nGovernment of Mongolia \n \n Sources: Asian Development Bank and the Bank of Mongolia. \n\nOrdinary capital resources (loan) \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n20.00 \n2.50 \n22.50 \n\nShare of Total (%) \n \n 89  \n 11 \n 100 \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \nE. \n \nThe  BOM  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  the  Payment  System  and  Accounting \n15. \nDepartment  of  the  BOM  will  implement  the  project.  The  executing  agency  will  be  assisted  by \nproject  implementation  consultants  for  project  management,  implementation,  and  institutional \ncapacity building. The BOM has formed a steering committee headed by its deputy governor to \noversee  the  project  implementation  process  and  performance,  provide  policy  guidance,  and \ncoordinate with other government ministries and agencies concerned. The  committee will also \ncoordinate  with  stakeholders,  including  the  participating  banks  and  mobile  network  operators. \nThe steering committee will be composed of all the department heads at the BOM involved in \nthe  payments  system.  Representatives  of  other  key  stakeholders  may  also  be  appointed  as \nmembers.  \n \n16. \nThe  steering  committee  will  be  assisted  by  an  advisory  committee  from  the  National \nCouncil  of  Payment  and  Settlement  System,  composed  mainly  of  representatives  from  BOM, \nthe commercial banks, the Financial Regulatory Commission, the Information Communications \nTechnology  and  Post  Authority,  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  the  Mongolian  Securities  Clearing \nHouse  and  Central  Depository,  and  mobile  network  operators.  To  manage  the  project  and \ncoordinate  with  consultants  and  external  service  providers  in  the  procurement  of  goods  and \nworks, a PIU has been organized by the BOM. The PIU will be headed by a project director and \nwill  comprise  of  full-time  core  staff,  including  a  project  office  coordinator,  three  project \nmanagers,  a  payment  systems  specialist,  an  information  technology  specialist,  and  a  mobile \npayment systems specialist. The PIU project manager will report to the project director (director \nof NETC), who will guide and supervise the work of the PIU. The project director will report to \nthe  steering  committee.  BOM  will  set  up  a  bid  evaluation  committee  to  prepare  the  bid \nevaluation  criteria,  rate  proposals  received,  and  make  decisions  for  awarding  contracts  for \nproject components. The bid evaluation committee will be composed of representatives from the \nBOM,  other  government  ministries  as  needed,  various  stakeholders,  as  well  as  technical \nexperts and third party experts.  \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f \n17. \nAll procurement of goods and works to be financed by the ADB loan will be undertaken \nin accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement Guidelines  (2013,  as amended from time  to time)  and \nthe Public Procurement Law of Mongolia (2004). All consultants engaged under the ADB loan \nwill  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  The  project  administration  manual  defines  the  road  map  and \nmilestones,  activity  timetable,  and  personnel  requirements,  including  project  performance \nmonitoring,  review,  and  evaluation,  as  well  as  reporting  requirements.

Moreover,  the \nNational  Council  of  Payment  and  Settlement  System  has  already  included  payment  system \nthe \ninteroperability \nimplementation of the interoperable mobile payment system will be assured. \n                                                \n14 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nits  road  map  for  payment  system  development.  Consequently, \n\nin \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nB. \n \n19. \nThe  project  is  economically  and  financially  viable,  with  an  estimated  economic  rate  of \nreturn  of  26.1%  and  an  estimated  financial  internal  rate  of  return  of  15.6%.  Poor  access  to \nfinance and high costs of financing are the most critical constraints to enterprise development. \nThe project is addressing both constraints by linking distant rural areas to the payments system \nand  sources  of  finance  through  the  use  of  more  advanced  technology.  The  project  will  also \nreduce  banking  costs  as  banks  shift  from  the  bricks-and-mortar  branch  banking  to  electronic \ntransfers.  The  system  modernization  will  improve  the  efficiency  of  doing  business  through  e-\ncommerce. The move to less dependence on cash will reduce risk for the population and cost of \nprinting,  carrying,  and  storing  currency.  The  project  will  allow  the  government  to  make  salary \nand  social  welfare  payments  more  efficiently,  minimizing  administration  costs.  Benefits  not \ndirectly  quantifiable  will  include  improved  liquidity  in  the  financial  system  as  funds  flow  more \nefficiently  and  the  greater  financial  stability  provided  by  more  secure  and  reliable  payment \nmechanisms.  \n \nC. \n \n20. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  BOM.  Mongolia  passed  an  Anti-Corruption  Law  in  2006.  In \nJanuary  2007,  the  government  created  the  Independent  Authority  Against  Corruption  that \nreports  to  parliament.  In  August  2007,  the  Criminal  Procedures  Code  was  amended  and  the \nIndependent  Authority  Against  Corruption  was  added  to  the  list  of  state  bodies  authorized  to \nconduct  investigations. The role of  the  public  council  within the  Independent  Authority  Against \nCorruption, which is intended to ensure effective participation of civil society in the process, has \nbeen  strengthened  under  the  current  government.  The  BOM  has  implemented  World  Bank \nprojects  in  the  past  and  arrangements  for  the  internal  funds  flow  have  been  found  to  be \nsatisfactory. The BOM has capable staff, adequate internal controls, and a reliable and secure \nfinancial reporting system. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, \nand  transparency,  the  BOM  will  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and \ncontrols consistent with international best practices to prevent corruption, money laundering, or \nthe financing of terrorism. \n \nD.  \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n21. \nAn  estimated  one-third  of  Mongolia\u2019s  people  live  below  the  poverty  line.  A  poverty \nassessment  by  ADB  pointed  to  limited  access  to  finance  as  one  of  the  factors  contributing  to \npoverty. Mongolia suffers from urban-rural disparities, and income inequality has been growing. \nThe  costs  of  providing  a  traditional  banking  presence  and  financial  intermediation  through \nbranches in the remote sparsely populated rural areas where many of the poor live have been \nprohibitive. The use of mobile phone payments and other forms of electronic noncash payments \ncan  deliver  financial  services,  including  microfinance,  to  the  poor  through  branchless  banking \nand  reduce  the  cost  of  transferring  funds  and  other  financial  transactions.  A  more  efficient \npayment  system  can  reduce  the  high  cost  of  doing  business  and  conducting  commerce  in \nMongolia.  A  national  payments  system  can  help  assimilate  the  country\u2019s  informal  market  into \nthe  formal  market,  since  identity  and  authentication  mechanisms  will  be  necessary  under  the \nnew system. \n \n22.  Many of the poor are rural women. The proportion of the country\u2019s households that are \nheaded by women rose from about 17.0% during 2004\u20132006 to about 28.5% in 2008, according \nto World Bank data. Any positive impact on the poor by the project would therefore likely benefit \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fwomen. Women face no legal barriers to accessing loans. More than 50% of borrowers at XAC \nBank are women. Consequently, women are likely to benefit along with men from an expansion \nof and better access to microfinance in the rural areas. The project is deemed to have a positive \ngender impact but has no specific gender elements in its design.  \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n23. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement  under  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  It  will  likely  not  involve  involuntary  land  acquisition  or \nrestriction  of  access  to  lands  that  will  result  in  the  physical  and/or  economic  displacement  of \npeople.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples  under  the  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. The project activities are unlikely to result in any direct or indirect impacts on \nindigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  C  for  environment.  ADB  has \ndetermined that the project will have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n24. \nThe  key  assumptions  for  successful  project  implementation  are  continued  financial \nsystem  stability  and  continued  government  support,  especially  from  the  BOM.  The  technical \nsupport  and  external  services  to  be  provided  under  the  project  are  intended  to  help  the  BOM \nprepare the request for proposals, choose vendors, and set up the system and its components. \nThe  technologies  being  recommended  are  proven  and  the  vendors  are  well-known  and  well-\nestablished. Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment \nand risk management plan.15 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n\nRisks \nSupport from senior BOM management \nmay not be continuous. \n\nStakeholders, including MNOs and \nparticipating banks, may not support the \nproject design and may not provide \ncontinuous support during implementation. \nSolutions provided for the system may not \nmeet the project requirements. \n\nParticipating banks and MNOs may not be \nready to participate in the project system. \n\nDifficulties are encountered in the \nintegration of the fragmented electronic \npayment systems operated by individual \nbanks. \n\nMitigating Measures \nADB has been keeping BOM management fully briefed to \nensure that there is agreement on the project concepts, \nand that continuous support is provided. \nADB has been keeping the NPC, the participating banks, \nand MNOs duly briefed to ensure that they buy into the \nproject concepts, strategies, and support implementation \narrangements. \nPIU is to select the evaluation team carefully, to ensure \nthat the project requirements are fully understood, to train \nevaluators, and to monitor the evaluation process closely. \nBOM is inviting participating banks and MNOs in work \ngroups at the onset to ensure that all stakeholders are \nfully aware of what is required in terms of integration and \nconnectivity. \nBOM is tasked to ensure that the required interfaces use \nexisting industry standards, and that all interfaces to \nexisting participating systems and MNO services are \nCBS and MNO agnostic, i.e., the interfaces require little \nor no integration effort on the CBS and MNO sides of the \ninterfaces. \n\n \n \n \n\n                                                \n15 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fRisks \nImplementation cannot be carried out \nwithin the agreed timeline and quality \nstandards. \n\nCapacities of BOM staff, market \nparticipants and users tasked to operate \nthe payment system may be inadequate; \nthe project may not build sufficient \ncapacities of BOM staff and other \nparticipating systems to efficiently manage \nand operate the new payment system. \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nThe project provides detailed plans to engage \nprofessional project management experts to implement \nquality assurance measures, and ensure experienced \nstaff is assigned to specific project tasks. \nBOM is conducting the capacity building program early \non, and raising public awareness. PIU has initiated the \nrecruitment of consultants early in the project life cycle, \nand there are plans to fully engage the staff of BOM and \nsystem participants during project implementation. Thus, \nthere is transferring knowledge of system operations \nthrough the learning by doing process. \n\nBOM = Bank of Mongolia, CBS = core banking system, MNO = mobile network operator, NPC = National Payment \nCouncil, PAM = Project Administrative Memorandum, PIU = project implementation unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \n25. \nThe  government  and  the  Bank  of  Mongolia  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of \nthe project shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n26. \nThe government and the Bank of Mongolia have agreed with ADB on certain covenants \nfor the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement.
