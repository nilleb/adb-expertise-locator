Sacombank will onlend \n$5 million of the loan to Sacombank Leasing Company (SLC), its leasing subsidiary, to facilitate \nterm  leases  to  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs).  This  is  the  second  nonsovereign \nloan to the leasing sector in Viet Nam.1\n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: BACKGROUND, CHALLENGES, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nViet Nam\u2019s Economy \n\n1. \n\nOverview and Outlook \n\n2. \nViet  Nam  has  maintained  rapid  economic  growth  over  the  past  decade  as  the  country \nhas  continued  its  transition  from  a  command  economy  into  one  increasingly  based  on  market \nmechanisms.  The  economy  has  grown  at  almost  7%  per  annum  since  2000,  with  an  average \nannual  growth  rate  of  8%  in  2003\u20132007  from  strong  export  growth,  foreign  direct  investment, \nand  remittances\u2014all  factors  that  have  facilitated  growth  in  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP) \nper capita from $441 in 2002 to $818 in 2007. GDP at purchasing power parity rose from $1,649 \nto $2,587 over this period.2  Accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in January 2007 \nhas further committed the country to ongoing liberalization and economic reforms as well as the \nsustained  development  of  the  private  sector.  Over  the  1995\u20132006  period,  the  private  sector\u2019s \nshare of GDP rose from 14% to 23%, and its share of industrial production grew from 31% to \n56%.3\n \n\n3. \nHowever,  in  recent  years,  internal  and  external  imbalances,  combined  with  sluggish \npolicy  response,  have  contributed  to  the  April\u2013August  2008  inflationary  spike.  Expansionary \nmonetary  and  fiscal  policy  fuelled  credit  growth,  which  rose  to  an  annualized  43%  in  March \n2008  and  contributed  to  a  rise  in  inflation,  which  reached  21.4%  in  April, 4  25.2%  in  May,  and \n26.7%  in  October.    Other  major  factors  contributing  to  inflation  were  the  rise  in  international \ncommodity prices, particularly refined petroleum, of which Viet Nam is a net importer; increased \nwages  in  the  skilled  labor  market;  escalating  property  prices;  and  the  rise  in  domestic  food \nprices.  Food  products  and  services  account  for  43%  of  the  consumer  price  index;  in  October \n2008,  prices  were  40.7%  higher  than  in  October  2007  because  of  such  supply-side  shocks  of \ncrop failure and livestock and poultry epidemics5 and consumers\u2019 hoarding of rice in April\u2013May \n2008.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  indicated  that  the  Government  needs  to \nmaintain inflation targeting and focus on lowering the trade deficit at the expense of short-term \ngrowth. The Asian Development Outlook of ADB has revised the country\u2019s growth rate to 6.5% \nfrom 7% in 2008 and adjusted its forecast down to 6% for 2009 from the previous estimate of \n8.1%.   \n \n4. \nIn  the  external  sector,  the  current  account  deficit  widened  because  of  ongoing  large-\nscale  investments  and  related  capital  goods  imports  by  the  public  sector,  higher  priced \ncommodity imports including gold, and a recent surge of precautionary imports in response to \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB\u2019s Board of Directors approved on 11 December 2007 the first nonsovereign loan, $20 million to Vietcombank \n\nfor onlending to its leasing subsidiary.  \n\n2  International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Viet Nam\u2019s New Challenges amid Overheating.  \n5  ADB. 2008. Viet Nam Country Chapter. Asian Development Outlook 2008 Update. Manila (17 September). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f 2 \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  announcement  of  import  taxes  on  cars  and  motorcycles.6    Despite  strong \nexports, the external current account deficit moved from 9.6% of GDP in 2007 to an estimated \n25%  of  GDP  in  January\u2013June  2008.  Overall,  investor  sentiment  remained  mostly  positive  as \nindicated  by  net  foreign  direct  investment  inflows,  which  reached  $6.6  billion  in  2007  and  are \nestimated  at  $5  billion  for  the  first  6  months  of  2008.  Thus,  the  overall  balance  of  payments \nreached a surplus in 2007 and a small deficit in the first 6 months of 2008. As a result of foreign \ndirect investment inflows and a rise in portfolio investment, official reserves have increased from \n$11.5 billion at end-2006 to an estimated $21 billion at end-2007, standing at an estimated $20 \nbillion as of end-June 2008. \n\n \n5. \nConcerns over the recent inflationary spike resulted in the downgrading by Fitch Ratings \nin  May  2008  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  country  outlook  from  stable  to  negative.  The  rating  agency  has \nindicated  that  the  Government\u2019s  response  has  been  both  too  slow,  with  official  positions  not \nfollowed  up  by  immediate  action,  and  too  small,  with  real  interest  rates  remaining  negative \nfollowing  the  recent  increase.  Fitch  notes,  however,  that  the  authorities  have  recently  become \nmore  willing  to  take  action  to  urgently  control  inflation  and  strengthen  market-oriented  macro-\nmanagement  tools.  This  includes  a  tighter  monitoring  policy,  strict  regulations  on  bank  capital \nadequacy  with  a  ceiling  on  bank  lending  growth  of  30%  year  on  year,  and  a  move  toward \nwidening the daily trading band from 0.75% to 1.00% in March 2008 with flexibility up to 2.00% \nin June 2008. As a result of these measures, money supply (M2) slowed to an annualized rate \nof 19.0% in September 2008, from 46.1% in 2007. The credit growth rate in the banking system \nwas estimated at 37.0% over the same period. The Government has also tightened fiscal policy \nby  improving  tax  collection  and  suspending  or  cancelling  an  estimated  $2.1  billion  in  state-\nowned enterprise (SOE) projects in the second quarter of 2008. Thus the fiscal balance moved \nfrom a deficit of 5.5% of GDP in 2007 to a surplus of 0.4% of GDP in first half of 2008. \n \n6. \nOverall, Fitch has affirmed Viet Nam\u2019s sovereign rating of BB minus, its BB minus long-\nterm foreign currency issuer default rating (IDR) and its BB long-term local currency IDR. Fitch \nhas affirmed its short-term foreign currency IDR at B. Standard and Poor\u2019s sovereign rating for \nViet Nam is BB, while Moody\u2019s has assigned a Ba2 rating. All rating agencies have downgraded \ntheir outlook to negative pending further progress on inflation targeting by the Government.  \n \n\n2. \n\nChallenges for the Future \n\n7. \nViet  Nam  will  need  to  address  the  major  challenges  of  continuing  structural  transition \ntoward a market-based economy, successful macroeconomic management in the medium-term \nto  sustain  growth,  and  improving  the  coordination  and  transparency  of  policy  response  with \nrespect to controlling inflation. \n   \n8. \nThe  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  recently  outlined  a  package  of  four  policy \ninitiatives  for  Viet  Nam  to  maintain  investor  confidence  and  restore  macroeconomic  stability. \nThese  are  (i)  further  tightening  of  monetary  policy  to  bring  credit  growth  and  inflation  under \ncontrol (i.e., make more effective use of interest rate policy to support positive real interest rates \nwithout disrupting financial intermediation in the banking system, as well as improved oversight \nof the banking system); (ii) improved budgetary control of expenditure and borrowing by SOEs \nwith  future  investments  restricted  to  core  areas  of  SOE  business;  (iii)  revised  fiscal  plans  for \n2008,  including  restrained  budgetary  expenditure  and  cutbacks in  off-budget  investments;  and \n\n                                                 \n6    ADB.  2008.  Viet  Nam  Country  Chapter.  Asian  Development  Outlook  2008  Update.  Manila  (17  September).  The \nvolume of imports of cars, motorcycles, steel, urea, paper, and cotton increased by 30\u2013414% over  the January\u2013\nAugust 2008 period from December 2007. The trade deficit widened to $14.8 billion in the first 6 months of 2008. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n(iv) greater exchange rate flexibility to simplify monetary management and assist the State Bank \nof  Vietnam  (SBV)  to  better  manage  shifts  in  capital  flows. 7     The  IMF  encouraged  further \nindependence  for  SBV  and  the  ongoing  equitization  of  SOEs  and  state-owned  commercial \nbanks (SOCBs) as a means of improving corporate governance. \n \n9. \nThere are some indications that the macroeconomic situation has started to improve as \na  result  of  coordinated  Government  measures.  Capital  has  started  moving  back  into  dong-\ndenominated assets, bank deposits in dong have increased, and interest rates declined in July \nand August 2008. As a result, the yield on the 5-year Government bond moved to 17% in mid-\nAugust,  after  rising  to  about  20%  in  mid-June  from  less  than  9%  in  early  April.  The  Viet  Nam \nindex  in  the  Ho  Chi  Minh  City  stock  exchange  strengthened  to  over  500  in  August  2008  from \n366 in June, which represented a 60% loss in value from October 2007 (footnote 5). \n \nB. \n\nThe Banking Sector in Viet Nam \n\n1. \n\nOverview \n\n10. \nThe  5-year  socioeconomic  development  plan  for  2006\u20132010  states  that,  in  the  area  of \nbanking  and  finance,  the  Government  will  \u201cgradually  abolish  all  preferences  enjoyed  by  the \nstate-owned  commercial  banks,  and  stop  the  interference  of  the  SBV  in  the  business  of \ncommercial  banks.\u201d 8   SBV  acts  as  a  central  bank  and  supervisory  institution  but  is  also  a \nshareholder in SOCBs. The Government has drawn up a road map of future banking reforms to \naddress  such  institutional  needs  and  has  promoted  a  greater  role  for  market  mechanisms \nthrough equitizing SOCBs and opening the sector to foreign banks. With respect to compliance \nwith  international  standards,  Basel  I  standards 9   are  currently  in  place,  and  SBV  aims  to \nimplement Basel II standards by 2010. \n \n11. \nAt present, the Government\u2019s primary concern is to fight inflation while ensuring steady \ngrowth in bank lending operations on the basis of more stringent guidelines. In this respect, SBV \nintroduced the following monetary policy measures in the first quarter of 2008: (i) an increase in \nbank reserve requirements from 5% to 11% of dong and foreign currency deposits with tenors of \nless  than  12  months,  effective  from  June  2007;  (ii)  the sale  of  D20.3  trillion  ($1.3 billion) in  1-\nyear  dong-denominated  SBV  bills  to  commercial  banks  to  mop  up  excess  liquidity;  (iii)  an \nincrease in the base rate by 325 basis points to 12% in May 2008 and to 14% in June 2008 (the \nnew effective maximum lending and deposit rates are officially reported to have been 1.5 times \nSBV\u2019s prime rate, i.e., 18%, in May 2008 and 19.5% in September 2008, though deposit rates \nvary  across  the  banks);  and  (iv)  an  increase  in  its  refinancing  rate  to  15%  in  June  2008  from \n7.5%  in  February  2008  and  in  its  discount  rate  to  13%  from  6.5%  over  the  same  period.  To \nguard against losses in the speculative stock market, SBV took measures in early 2007 to slow \nand  discontinue  bank  lending  to  securities  company  subsidiaries  by  raising  the  risk  weight  for \nsecurities-related  loans  to  250%  from  100%;  the  maximum  threshold  for  securities  lending  is \n20%  of  chartered  capital,  based  on  Decision  03/2008/Qd-NHNN  of  1  February  2008.    More \nrecently,  in  response  to  tightening  international  credit  flows,  SBV  has  requested  SOCBs  to \nsupport enterprise access to credit by adjusting their lending rates.  As of October 2008, SOCB \nlending rates are 18.5% and in exceptional circumstances, range from 16.2% to 17.2%, below \n\n                                                 \n7   IMF. 2008.

The  Five  Year  Socio  Economic  Development  Plan  2006\u2013\n\n2010. Hanoi (page 77). \n\n9   Basel  I  standards  established  the  minimum  capital  requirements  for  banks  when  issued  in  1988  by  the  Bank  for \nInternational Settlements. Basel II standards, which are considered to be more comprehensive, are in the process \nof being implemented by several countries. Viet Nam has not yet implemented Basel II standards.  \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\nthe  earlier  SBV  established  ceiling  of  19.5%.    Lending  rates  offered  by  the  JSBs  are  also \noccasionally lower than the ceiling. \n \n12. \nAs  per  SBV\u2019s  Decision  No.  13/2008/QD-NHNN  of  29  April  2008,  promulgating  the \nregulation  on  the  operation  networks  of  commercial  banks,  SBV  restricted  growth  in  bank \noperations,  i.e.  opening  of  new  branches,  through  tighter  conditions  placed  on  bank  financial \ncapital.  Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung also ordered SBV to cap credit growth at 30 per cent \nper  year.  This  measure  was  introduced  to  slow  loan  growth  and  guard  against  nonperforming \nloans  (NPLs)  in  some  joint-stock  banks  (JSBs),  where  loan  books  grew  by  over  100%  over \n2006\u20132007. Total bank loans grew by 53% in 2007, though SOCBs have maintained the most \nconservative  approach  to  loan  portfolio  growth  (24%  in  2007)  to  focus  on  improving \ncapitalization  and  loan  book  quality  in  preparation  for  equitization.  The  smaller  JSBs  are  the \nmost exposed in terms of asset\u2013liability mismatch and property market portfolio concentration, \nand  they  will  likely  come  under  pressure  to  either  declare  bankruptcy  or  merge  with  a  larger \nbank during 2008.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPerformance \n\n13. \nThe  banking  sector  has  grown  significantly  since  the  adoption  of  the  Law  on  Credit \nInstitutions in 1997 (Decree 02-1997-QH10, dated 12 December 1997), which allowed a variety \nof  products  to  be  offered  by  credit  institutions  and  introduced  prudential  provisions  including \ncapital  norms,  restrictions  on  asset and  liability  management,  deposit  insurance,  and  limits  on \ncredit institutions\u2019 investments in real estate. The number of banks increased significantly over \nthe past decade as a result of SBV deregulation. The number of registered banks is high, with 5 \njoint  venture  banks,  36  private  banks,  44  foreign  bank  branches,  and  55  foreign  bank \nrepresentative offices.  While the banking system is still characterized by the strong presence of \nthe  4  SOCBs,  JSBs  are  slowly  gaining  market  share.    Other  state  banks  include  the  Vietnam \nCommercial Bank, Vietnam Development Bank and Vietnam Bank for Social Policies.   \n \n14.  With respect to the recent medium-term outlook, Fitch\u2019s Viet Nam bank report on 29 May \n2008 indicates that strong economic growth has provided significant expansion opportunities for \nthe commercial banks in Viet Nam and that, furthermore, low penetration overall\u2014with less than \n5%  of  the  population  regularly  using  banking  services  and  10\u201320%  holding  bank  accounts\u2014\nprovides  good  opportunities  for  growth  in  the  banking  sector  in  the  medium-to-long  term.  In \nparticular,  Fitch  indicates  that  large  private  banks  that,  like  Sacombank,  have  a  major \ninternational  bank  as  a  strategic  investor  stand  to  gain  from  their  more  commercially  oriented \nand  improved  risk-based  banking  operations.  Loan  growth  for  the  large  private  commercial \nbanks,  including  Sacombank,  has  generally  been  in  trade,  manufacturing,  and  well-secured \nmortgages  with  relatively  low  exposure  in  the  speculative  property  development  market. \nSacombank indicates prudent portfolio expansion.  \n \n15.  With their recent expansion, private banks are undermining the market dominance of the \nSOCBs,  particularly  in  the  retail  sector.  In  terms  of  market  structure,  the  four  major  SOCBs \naccounted  for  50%  of  total  loans  at  end-2007,  down  from  62%  at  end-2006.  The  five  larger \nurban  JSBs, 10   each  with  a  major  international  bank  as  a  minority  strategic  foreign  investor, \ncurrently  account  for  over  20%  of  market  share,  followed  by  19  smaller  banks  and  12  small, \nrural JSBs.  \n \n\n                                                 \n10 Sacombank, Techcombank, Viet Nam International Bank, Asia Commercial Bank, and East Asia Commercial Bank. \n\n \n\n\f5\n\n \n\n \n \n \nItem \n \n\nAccording  to  Fitch,  there  are  no  expected  domestic  liquidity  concerns  for  SOCBs,  as \n16. \ntheir deposit franchises are strong and their deposit funding stands to benefit during a flight to \nquality. In 2007, deposit growth held up well at around 22% on average to support loan growth. \nDepositors are, however, monitoring the benefits of purchasing gold versus maintaining savings \nin interest-bearing accounts. NPLs have declined, but overall asset quality is inferior to that of \nthe  private  banks,  though  some  SOCBs  that  are  preparing  for  equitization,  including \nVietcombank,  have \nloan  quality  and  recognize \nnonperforming assets.

Viet  Nam\u2019s  recent  accession  to  WTO,  which  allows \n18. \nforeign banks to set up wholly owned foreign subsidiaries, is expected to increase competition in \nthe  banking  sector.  It  is  reported  that  SBV  expects  to  receive  around  20  new  applications  for \nbanks  from  large  corporations  and  seven  foreign  banks.  Among  the  applicants  are  Standard \nChartered  Bank  and  banks  from  Taipei,  China  and  the  Republic  of  Korea.  Australia  and  New \nZealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ), Hong Kong Shanghai Bank Corporation (HSBC), Standard \nChartered, and Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited have all purchased interests in \nlocal  banks.  In  2008,  Standard  Chartered,  HSBC,  and  ANZ  became  the  first  foreign  banks \npermitted to found their wholly owned corporations in Viet Nam.11  \n  \n19. \nThe  nonbank  financial  intermediaries  sector  and  institutional  investors,  other  than  the \ninsurance sector, are insignificant. The market for primary government debt is quite rudimentary, \nwhile  the  secondary  government  debt  and  corporate  debt  markets  are  highly  illiquid  and \nunderdeveloped.  The  absence  of  well-developed  debt  markets  is  a  constraint  on  the  ability  of \nleasing  companies  to  raise  longer-term  funds. 12   The  equities  market,  though  small  and  still \ndeveloping, has shown significant growth as well as market correction. Total company listings at \nthe  country's  two  stock-trading  centers  increased  fourfold,  from  44  to  193,  between  end-2005 \nand  end-2006,  and  during  the  same  period  total  market  capitalization  increased  by  almost  21 \ntimes, from D11 trillion to D231 trillion, or to 25% of GDP in 2006, compared with 1.3% at end-\n2005.  Market  capitalization  reached  D494.5  trillion  in  2007  (or  43.4%  of  GDP).  However, \nconcerns over the value of securities in the January\u2013June 2008 inflationary environment led to \ndivestment  from  the  stock  market  into  other  forms  of  capital  and  gold,  as  well  as  to  market \ncorrection in terms of the stock/price earnings ratio. Consequently, the total capitalization of Viet \nNam's two bourses in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City is estimated to amount to D294.5 trillion as of \nSeptember 2008, or approximately 25.8% of the country's GDP as of September 2008, half of \nthe market value recorded in 2007.  \n\n                                                 \n11  Each bank is required to have charter capital of at least D1 trillion ($620 million). \n12    As  also  indicated  in  ADB.  2007.

Manila (Loan 2377-VIE, for $75 million, approved on 6 December).  \n\n\f \n\n7\n\n \nBank  Capitalization.  Both  the  fall  in  value  of  the  Ho  Chi  Minh  City  stock  exchange, \n20. \nwhere market value fell 30% over October 2007\u2013August 2008, and the recent inflationary spike \nplace  constraints  on  Vietnamese  banks\u2019  ability  to  raise  capital.  Consumers  are  placing  their \ninvestments  in  traditionally  secure  investments,  such  as  gold,  and  are  at  present  reluctant  to \ninvest  in  stocks.  Recent  uncertainties  have  contributed  to  some  JSBs\u2019  reconsidering  the \nissuance  of  a  bond  to  assist  with  tier  II  capital.  Until  the  inflationary  situation  stabilizes  and \nconsumer confidence in securities is restored, few banks are expected to issue a domestic initial \npublic  offering,  rights  issue,  or  bond.  IMF  Article  4  consultation  meetings  in  Viet  Nam  are \nexpected  to  be  concluded  in  October  2008  and  the  report  issued  in  December  2008.  IMF  will \nlikely  continue  to  draw  attention  to  targeting  inflation,  uneven  progress  in  SOCB  and  SOE \nreform, and the need for SBV independence. \n \n21. \nEquitization  of  State-Owned  Commercial  Banks. To improve the competitiveness of \nthe financial sector and comply with WTO accession requirements with respect to opening the \nfinancial  services  market,  the  Government  announced  equitization  plans  for  all  five  SOCBs  in \n2005.13 The Government has indicated it will retain a majority share of 51% in most SOCBs over \nthe medium-to-long term. At present, up to 30% of the shares in each major SOCB may be sold \nto the public and foreign strategic partners. To support the restructuring of the banking sector, \nthe World Bank began implementing its Banking Sector Reform Program (2002\u20132015) with the \nfollowing  activities:  (i)  restructuring  SOCBs,  (ii)  restructuring  non-state  (joint-stock)  banks,  (iii) \nimproving the prudential regulatory and supervisory framework, and (iv) leveling the playing field \nfor all banks.  \n\nAmong  SOCBs,  Vietcombank  was  the  first  to  initiate  transition  into  a  JSB  through  the \n22. \ndomestic sale of 6.5% of its shares in December 2007. Approximately 3.5% of the shares were \nsold to bank employees, with the remainder sold to national institutional investors. Any further \ninitial  public  offering,  domestic  or  international,  is  being  deferred  until  consumer  and  investor \nconfidence in emerging market stocks is restored.  \n\nJoint-Stock  Banks.  The  top  five  urban  banks\u2014Techcombank,  Sacombank,  Viet  Nam \n23. \nInternational Bank, Asia Commercial Bank, and East Asia Commercial Bank\u2014all have minority \ninternational strategic investors. The smaller urban JSB group consists of banks such as Habu \nBank, Viet A Bank, and Saigon Bank.  \n \nThe  major  JSBs  have  launched  ambitious  expansion  plans.  Over  the  past  4  years, \n24. \nSacombank,  Asia  Commercial  Bank  (ACB),  and  Techcombank  have  expanded  their  branch \nnetworks,  with  each  reaching  close  to  200  bank  branches  including  sub-branches  and \ntransaction  centers.  The  rapid  growth  in  the  retail  and  SME  markets  was  curtailed  by  the \nGovernment in early 2008 with the introduction of the 30% cap on further credit expansion and \nincreased monitoring with respect to overall banking sector provisioning. All the major banks are \naudited by accredited accounting firms. \n \nLoan  growth  for  the  large  private  commercial  banks,  including  Sacombank,  has \n25. \ngenerally been in trade, manufacturing, and well-secured mortgages. While the specific impact \nof  the  fall  in  property  prices  needs  to  be  assessed  case  by case  for  each  major  bank,  project \ndue diligence of Sacombank indicates prudent portfolio expansion and appropriate provisioning \n                                                 \n13  The  Government  has  committed  to  equitizing  Vietcombank  and  Mekong  Housing  Bank  in  2007,  Industrial  and \nCommercial Bank of Viet Nam (Incombank) and Bank for Investment and Development of Viet Nam (BIDV) in 2008, \nand Viet Nam Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development in 2009. \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\nand mechanisms for monitoring credit risk, both at the head office and in branches.  \n \n26. \nPotential  for  Growth.  Opportunity  for  growth  in  the  retail  and  SME  markets  is  strong \nacross  the  banking  sector.  Overall  penetration  is  low,  as  less  than  5%  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  total \npopulation of about 85 million regularly uses banking services and between 10% (according to \nInternational  Financing  Review  Asia)  and  20%  (McKinsey)  has  bank  accounts.  Among  the \nurban middle class of 8 million, defined as those with a monthly income of at least $500, only \n22% have bank accounts. The average loan is for $3,000, and, while the most common credit \nproduct is a car loan, new car sales have so far not exceeded 6,000 units per month. Loans to \nSMEs  tend  to  be  in  the  range  of  D1  billion\u2013D2  billion  ($62,000\u2013$124,000)  for  short  maturities \nand  are  highly  secured.  It  is  reported14  that  access  is  very  limited  to  loans  of  over  D5  billion \n($312,000)  or  to  medium-  and  long-term  loans.  Large  private  banks  like  Sacombank  with  a \nmajor  international  bank  as  a  strategic  investor  stand  to  gain  from  their  more  commercially \noriented and improved risk-based banking operations.  \n \nC. \n\nSME and Leasing Sector Background \n\n1. \n\nConstraints to SME Development: Lack of Access to Financing  \n\n27. \nSMEs  play  a  significant  role  in  the  economy  of  Viet  Nam  and  are  the  major  source  of \nemployment. The country strategy and program (CSP) 2007\u20132010 for Viet Nam indicates that \nover  165,000  enterprises  have  been  registered  under  the  1999  Enterprise  Law 15   since  its \nenactment in 2000 and that over 90% of these registered enterprises are SMEs with registered \ncapital  of  less  than  D10  billion  ($625,000)  and  fewer  than  300  employees.  The  CSP  further \nstates that \u201cthe private sector now generates over 60% of  GDP and employs 90% of the total \nworkforce.  Rapid  private  sector  development  has  been  a  key  element  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  pro-poor \nsocioeconomic  development.  The  domestic  private  sector  generates  more  employment  and \noutput per unit of investment than either the state sector or foreign investors.\u201d16\n \n28. \nTo  maintain  enterprise  growth,  particularly  during  current  inflationary  trends,  access  to \nfinance needs to be facilitated and improved. The 2005 World Bank investment climate survey17 \nindicates access to finance to be a more significant constraint to enterprises in Viet Nam than \nelsewhere.  \n\n                                                 \n14  Ministry of Planning and Investment, Enterprise Development Department. 2007.

Data  from  World  Bank  investment  climate  survey  database,  using \nunweighted averages. \nSource: Viet Nam: Country Strategy and Program 2007\u20132010.   \n \nSMEs  in  Viet  Nam  have  difficulty  accessing  financial  services  and  securing  financing, \n29. \nmainly  because  of  the  strong  risk-adverse  bias  of  banks  with  respect  to  SME  lending.  This \nperception  is  slowly  changing,  as  some  of  the  major  JSBs  and  SOCBs  begin  to  tailor  credit \ninstruments  to  meet  the  needs  of  larger  SMEs.  Also,  some  commercial  banks,  such  as \nSacombank, have developed and implemented a financial strategy focused on penetrating the \nexpanding SME customer base in Viet Nam.  \n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nNascent Leasing Industry \n\n30. \nFrom  a  developmental  perspective,  leasing  is  of  particular  importance  for  its  role  in \nfinancing  SMEs  that  do  not  have  either  the  capital  to  purchase  equipment  or  the  collateral  to \naccess conventional sources of funds. An ADB survey of SMEs in Viet Nam, conducted during \ntechnical assistance in 2007,18 identified the following benefits of leasing: (i) leasing companies \nrequire less collateral than banks, as the asset being financed is the security; (ii) they are more \naggressive  with  respect  to  expanding  the  SME  client  base;  and  (iii)  leasing  allows  for \ncomplementary  financing  through  commercial  bank  credit  lines.  Most  SMEs  indicated  their \nbusiness growth depends on continued access to lease financing for manufacturing equipment \nto  fill  both  domestic  and  export  orders.  At  present,  the  average  loan  to  a  customer  from  a \nleasing company is $88,000, and the average equity of the leasing company\u2019s SME client base \nis $170,000. The leasing industry has expanded by 15\u201320% per year and focuses mostly on two \nsectors: (i) transport and automobiles and (ii) industrial machinery and equipment.  \n \n31. \nHowever, the leasing industry remains small. The total assets of the nonbanking sector \nare estimated to be less than 3% of total bank assets .19 The leasing industry, with total assets \nof D13.0 trillion ($814 million), accounts for 1.24% of the formal financial sector.20 \n\n                                                 \n18 ADB.  2006.

Leasing  industry  analyses undertaken during \n32. \nADB\u2019s Financial Sector Program Loan (FSPL II) and SME Sector Development Program Loan \n(SDPL)21 revealed that the funding gap in the leasing industry and regulatory constraints were \nthe  major  causes  for  the  industry\u2019s  slow  growth.  Accordingly,  the  Government  undertook  a \nseries  of  policy  reforms  under  the  FSPL  II  and  the  SDPL  to  assist  the  development  of  the \nleasing  sector.  Leasing  companies  are  licensed  and  regulated  by  SBV  and  regarded  as \nnonbank credit institutions under the Law on Credit Institutions. SBV\u2019s Decree 16/2001 ND/-CP \nof  2  May  2001  provided  the  broad  legal  framework  for  leasing  operations.  The  decree \nauthorizes only those financial leasing companies licensed by SBV to undertake finance leasing \ntransactions. The activities of leasing companies were initially restricted to financial leasing for \nmachinery, equipment, vehicles, other moveable assets, and other services related to financial \nleasing operations. The Government issued Decree 65/2005/ND-CP of 19 May 2005 to amend \nDecree 16, allowing for operating leasing, the sale of finance lease receivables and lease back, \nand syndicated lease transactions. Decree 65 provides for a limit of exposure to a single client \nequal to 30% of all capital of a finance leasing company and outlines the broad procedures for \nenforcing  leasing  contracts.  Under  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  Small  and  Medium-\nSized  Enterprise  Development  Program,  implemented  over  the  period  March\u2013October  2007,22 \nADB  trained  leasing  companies  on  upgrading  lease  agreements  to  clarify  lessor  and  lessee \ncommercial obligations and mitigate the risk of repossession. Constraints remain in the area of \ninterministerial coordination on repossession, in particular among the commercial court, Ministry \nof Justice, and Economic Police. ADB is maintaining dialogue with the Government on this issue \nunder FSPL III, approved in 2007.  \n \nUse of Self Help. To facilitate the use of self help by leasing companies, ADB undertook \n33. \na series of consultations with the industry and the Government in 2007. TA 4781 consultations \nled  to  the  Government\u2019s  issuing  Circular  No.08/2007/TT-NHNN-BCA-BTP  dated  12  October \n2007, Guidelines on Repossession and Settlement of Leasing Assets of Leasing Company. The \ncircular clarifies the rights of the leasing company to the recovery of assets through the use of \nself  help  and  the  timeline  and  provides  clear  guidelines  on  the  scope  of  involvement  by \nGovernment ministries and people\u2019s committees in this area.  \n \n34. \nLeasing  companies  have  introduced  the  following  measures  to  reduce  the  risks  and \ncosts  of  repossession:  (i)  upgrading  lease  agreements  to  ensure  both  lessor  and  lessee  are \nequally  aware  of  obligations  under  the  contract  and  knowledgeable  about  the  use  of  self  help \nand  recourse  to  power  of  attorney,  (ii)  improved  integration  and  association  with  suppliers  to \nassist in valuating the item to be repossessed and its resale, (iii) restricting the financing of one-\noff assets used by a very limited number of companies, and (iv) specializing leasing officers in \nspecific  industries  and  equipment.  Other  measures  introduced  include  improved  marketing \nfrom \ncampaigns  and  organization  of  workflow,  specifically \nnonperforming accounts into specialized units, as well as improved performance measures. \n \n\nthe  separation  of  active \n\n                                                 \n21  ADB.  2004.

To mitigate inflationary pressures, SBV issued Decision \n35. \n03/2007/QD-NHNN on 19 January 2007 to amend Decision 457/2005/QD-NHNN regulating the \nsafety  ratios  of  credit  institutions\u2019  operations.  Decision  3  places  a  cap  equivalent  to  10%  of \nparent  bank  equity  on  parent  bank  funding  to  subsidiary  companies,  including  leasing \ncompanies,  and  requires  relending  to  be  extended  at  commercial  interbank  rates.  There  have \nbeen no amendments to Decision 03 in 2008.  \n \n36.  Market Assessment. Indications are that regulatory reforms have promoted the growth \nof the leasing sector in Viet Nam, which nearly doubled over the period 2005\u20132007. Over this \nperiod,  outstanding  leases  grew  from  an  estimated  $374  million  to  $710  million;  they  stood  at \n$814 million in June 2008. Leasing companies indicated they estimate growth rates of 20\u201330% \nyear on year, with ongoing strong demand from SMEs for automobiles and industrial machinery.  \n \n37. \nFunding  Gap. Leasing industry analyses undertaken during the FSPL II and the SDPL \nrevealed that the funding gap in the leasing industry and regulatory constraints were the major \ncauses  for  the  industry\u2019s  slow  growth.  Leasing  company  funding  is  exclusively  through \nborrowings from the parent bank. Access to short-term customer deposit funds from the parent \nbank (under 360 days at floating 90\u2013180 day rates) and, in the case of some leasing companies, \nfrom  customer  deposits  (under  13  months),  is  creating  a  funding  mismatch  with  respect  to \nmedium- and long-term leases issued by leasing companies in response to customer demand.  \n \n38.  Market  Structure.  There  are  13  leasing  companies  in  Viet  Nam,  categorized  under \nDecree  16  as  state  run  (seven),  affiliate  (four),  and  joint  venture  (two),  with  no  companies \ncurrently in the joint-stock category. \n \n\nTable 4: Leasing Sector Overview, end-2006 \n \n\nCompany \nAffiliate Financial Leasing Companies of Credit Institutions \nKexim Leasing Company  \nChailease International Leasing Company \nSacombank Leasing  \nAsia Commercial Bank Leasing \nJoint-Venture Financial Leasing Companies \nANZ/V-TRAC Leasing \nViet Nam International Leasing Company  \n\n \nChailease Finance Co.

It was the first bank to list on the Ho Chi Minh City stock exchange in 2006, \nwhere it is the largest listed firm. The bank is the fifth largest by registered capital and the sixth \n\n                                                 \n23 VBARD II undertakes the leasing of ships, hence the company\u2019s large market share in terms of total outstanding \n\nleases. \n\n24   IFC  recently  divested  itself  of  the  Viet  Nam  International  Leasing  Company,  a  joint  equity  investment  with \nIncombank, Natexis, KDB Capital Corporation, and Aozora Bank, to review potential activities in the sale of lease \nreceivables  and  has  taken  equity  participation  in  Sacombank.  Sacombank  formed  its  leasing  company  in  2006. \nThe third private leasing company, ANZ/V-TRAC, is owned mainly by ANZ, with Caterpillar holding a minority share. \nThe  fourth,  KEXIM  Viet  Nam  Leasing  Co.,  is  the  subsidiary  of  the  Korea  Export  Import  Bank.  Chailease  is  a \nsubsidiary of Chailease Finance Company Limited of Taipei,China. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nlargest  by  assets,  with  a  5%  market  share  by  asset  size  in  December  2007.  Sacombank  has \nthree  strategic  foreign  shareholders:  ANZ,  IFC,  and  Dragon  Capital.  Financial  statements  for \n2006 and 2007 have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers, with the most recent auditor\u2019s \nreport  in  December  2007  providing  comments  on  financial  statements  based  on  Viet  Nam \naccounting standards. Accounting statements as per international financial reporting standards \nare made available to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors. Retail banking is conducted through a network \nof 238 branches and transaction offices nationwide. The bank opened a representative office in \nNanning, People\u2019s Republic of China, in January 2008 and is scheduled to open a branch in the \nLao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  in  late  2008  and  in  Cambodia  in  2009.  Sacombank \nemployed  5,470  staff  at  the  end  of  2007.  Total  assets  reached  D63.3  trillion  ($3.9 billion)  and \nequity amounted to D4.4 trillion ($275 million) in December 2007.  \n \nSacombank offers a full range of banking services, including deposit taking in dong and \n41. \nforeign currencies (primarily US dollars), lending, trade finance, guarantees, treasury services, \nand credit card and payment services across all market segments. Sacombank is primarily an \nSME bank, as over 60% of its loans are to SMEs. The bank aims to further improve its service \nto SMEs by expanding the provision of financial leases across 30 major branches in Viet Nam in \n2008. By offering the complementary service of SME working capital and factoring together with \nmedium-term financial leases, the bank looks to deepen its penetration of the SME market and \ncreate  the  opportunity  to  attract  firms  with  smaller  equity  bases  to  grow  within  the  integrated \nSacombank  SME  financial  services  program.  To  comply  with  internal  and  national  prudential \nregulations,  Sacombank  has  indicated  that  the  branch-based  lease  financing  program  will  be \nguided by the bank\u2019s internal risk-management procedures strictly administered and monitored \nat the branch level.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED LOAN  \n\nA. \n\nADB Loan  \n\n42. \nADB identified the loan further to policy dialogue undertaken with the Government under \nFSPL II and SDPL. The policy programs highlighted the constraints on SMEs\u2019 access to finance \nand addressed upgrading the legal and regulatory framework to facilitate the development of the \nleasing  industry.  In  2007,  during  TA  4781  implementation,  all  leasing  companies  received \ncomprehensive  training  on  risk  management,  risk  pricing,  and  marketing  lease  products.  ADB \nundertook due diligence of all major leasing companies and their parent banks in Viet Nam and \nupgraded regulations referring to self help.25 See Appendix 2 for the ranking methodology and \nAppendix 3 for the legal and regulatory upgrading actions undertaken by ADB. \n \n43. \nThis is the second nonsovereign loan to the leasing sector in Viet Nam. The ADB Board \napproved the first nonsovereign loan to Vietcombank, for onlending to its leasing subsidiary, in \nDecember 2007.26  At the time, the ADB project team brought to the attention of the Board the \ninterest  expressed  by  Sacombank,  another  qualifying  bank,  and  its  leasing  company,  to \nparticipate  in  ADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  loan.  However,  because  interest  was  expressed  late,  in \n\n                                                 \n25  Under  TA  4781,  March\u2013October  2007,  ADB  undertook  a  series  of  consultations  with  the  leasing  companies  and \nthe  Government  to  clarify  the  use  of  self  help  and  thereby  facilitated  the  issuance  of  Circular  No.  08/2007/TT-\nNHNN-BCA-BTP, dated 10 October 2007, Guidelines on repossession and settlement of leasing assets of leasing \ncompany. This circular clarifies the rights of the leasing companies to the recovery of assets through the use of self \nhelp  and  the  timelines  and  provides  clear  guidelines  on  the  scope  of  involvement  by  Government  ministries  and \npeople\u2019s committees in this area.   \n\n26 In December 2007, the Board strongly requested that there be a level playing field between the public and private \n\nsector and that the next ADB nonsovereign loan consider a JSB bank and subsidiary leasing company.    \n\n \n\n\f 14 \n\nOctober 2007, ADB indicated that the loan to Sacombank would need to be processed further to \nfull due diligence and submitted the loan request for ADB Board approval in 2008.  \n \n44. \nADB  is  proposing  to  provide  a  senior  loan  to  the  Borrower  of  up  to  $25  million.  The \nBorrower will onlend $5 million to its fully owned subsidiary, SLC, to support the development of \nlease financing, particularly for equipment lease financing, which is an area of growing demand \nfrom  Viet  Nam\u2019s  manufacturing  SMEs.  To  facilitate  access  to  finance,  it  is  proposed  that  the \nbank  and  the  leasing  company  relend  repayments  on  term  loans  and  leases  as  long  as  the \nmaturity falls within the tenor of the ADB loan. \n \n\nV. \n\nINVESTMENT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nJustification \n\n1. \n\nDevelopment Outcome \n\nADB\u2019s sequential activities in the leasing sector are expected to create a demonstration \n45. \neffect  in  both  the  SOCB  and  the  JSB  sector  regarding  the  commercial  benefits  of  leasing  to \nSMEs. The loan is a pilot that will facilitate improved access to medium-term leases from SLC to \nSMEs in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi. Co-locating the leasing company in 30 bank branches will \n(i)  create  a  demonstration  effect  for  the  industry  on  the  cost-effective  delivery  of  SME  lease \nfinancing within the parent branch network; (ii) allow SLC to incubate smaller SMEs that access \nthe formal financial sector through leasing and refer smaller SME customers with a credit history \nin  SLC  to  the  bank,  thereby  facilitating  their  formal  access  to  complementary  short-  and \nmedium-term  finance  instruments;  and  (iii)  gradually  allow  SLC  to  take  over  the  equipment \nfinancing  activity  provided  by  the  parent,  which  is  more  costly  to  SMEs  in  terms  of  collateral \nrequirements, and grow the more competitive equipment lease financing provided by the leasing \ncompany.  The  small  size  of  the  loan  and  the  small  market  share  of  SLC,  at  only  2%  of  the \nleasing industry, will guard against an adverse impact on competition. As a percentage of bank \nassets,  Sacombank  holds  6%  of  the  assets  of  the  eight  largest  banks  in  Viet  Nam.  The  low \nimpact on competition has been verified in consultations with public and private entities held at \nSBV.  Interest  has  been  expressed  by  other  qualifying  SOCB  and  JSB  leasing  companies  in \naccessing  a  subsequent  ADB  loan  in  the  area  of  lease  financing.  The  loan  will  promote  the \nfollowing developments: \n \n\n (i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nSME growth and leasing industry strengthening. Access to finance for SMEs \nis  at  present  highly  constrained,  particularly  for  term  loans  and  in  amounts  that \nrange  between  $125,000  and  $250,000,  by  banks\u2019  high  collateral  requirements \nand demands for an established credit history. It is estimated that ADB\u2019s loan will \nfund up to 70 new financial leases to SMEs at terms of 3\u20135 years, assuming 75% \nof the loan equivalent is revolved once by the leasing company, and between 80 \nand 160 new loans to SMEs referred to the bank through the leasing company. \nTerm funding provided by ADB to the parent bank will allow for relending either \ndong or dollars to the bank and the leasing company as per their requirements. \nAt  present,  Sacombank  provides  both  dong  and  dollar  loans,  and  Sacombank \nleasing company provides financial leases in both dong and dollars at adjustable \nrates.  \n\nJob creation and revenue generation. Improved access to finance for SMEs, in \nparticular  those  in  labor-intensive  manufacturing  and  to  a  lesser  extent  in \ntransportation,  will  create  jobs  and  generate  revenue.  Leasing  companies \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n15\n\nindicate  that  their  present  customer  base  has  an  employee  roster  ranging  from \n50  to  300.  The  loan  will  thus  directly  assist  in  creating  approximately  10,000 \nadditional jobs in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi.  \n\nCapital  markets  development.  Leasing  companies  can  help  develop  capital \nmarkets  over  time.  Once  they  establish  an  operating  history  and  a  portfolio  of \nterm leases, they will be able to begin securitizing lease receivables, taking some \nassets off the balance sheet to achieve a higher leverage and better returns, thus \ndeveloping an additional tradable instrument on the national capital market.  \n\nStrengthening  of  the  banking  sector.  The  Government  has  identified  the \nbanking  sector  as  a  priority  for  reform.  The  proposed  ADB  assistance  is  in  the \narea  of  corporate  governance  and  market-based  business  strategy,  policy,  and \nplanning  and  provides  a  means  to  strengthen  the  banking  sector  at  a  time  of \ninflationary  risk.  Co-locating  lease  finance  services  in  over  30  bank  branch \nnetworks will (a) facilitate the referral of new SMEs within the bank network; (b) \nimprove  the  integrated  delivery  of  lease  finance  and  SME  finance  as  a  more \ncomprehensive financing tool for SMEs in the present restrictive credit market; (c) \nallow SMEs to conserve cash and hedge their financing risks across more than \none  financing  instrument;  and  (d)  allow  for  two-stage  due  diligence  of  the \ncustomer by SLC and the bank, thus protecting the institutional portfolio from risk.  \n\n2. \n\nInvestment Objectives \n\nADB\u2019s  objectives  for  the  proposed  loan  are  to  (i)  create  a  demonstration  effect  in  the \n46. \nbanking industry on the complementary delivery of  leasing and credit instruments; (ii) facilitate \nSMEs\u2019  access  to  the  formal  financial  sector  via leasing  while  preserving  their cash  by  treating \nthe  equipment  as  collateral;  and  (iii)  create  efficiency  and  maximize  service  delivery  on  a \nprudential  basis  to  the  expanding  SME  sector27  through  the  integrated  SME  credit  reference \nsystem from the leasing company to the parent bank. \n \n47. \nThe  proposed  loan  will  enable  Sacombank  to  meet  its  dual  objective  of  (i)  extending \nterm leases to SMEs through SLC through its branch networks in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi \nand  (ii)  facilitating  complementary  SME  credit  on  a  prudent  basis.  The  capacity  building 28  \nprovided by ADB over March\u2013October 2007 to 10 leasing companies in Viet Nam will help SLC \nfurther  improve  the  pricing  of  its  leases  as  per  market  risk  and  the  marketing  of  its  financial \nlease products.  \n \n\n3. \n\nDesign and Monitoring Framework \n\nADB  has  prepared  a  design  and  monitoring  framework  and  will  measure  the  expected \n48. \ndevelopment  impact  of  the  loan  in  accordance with  ADB\u2019s  Management  Development  Results \nPolicy.29  \n \n\n                                                 \n27  Consultations  held  by  ADB  with  leasing  companies  and  SMEs  in  Hanoi  and  Ho  Chi  Minh  City  indicate  that \nsuppliers on contract with the leasing company comply with technical standards specified by the leasing company \nand the SME customer base. \n\n28 All training materials developed under TA 4781 will be provided to SBV and the 10 leasing companies to facilitate \n\nongoing in-house training during the implementation of the loan. \n29 ADB. 2007. Management Development Results Policy. Manila.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f 16 \n\n4. \n\nFit to Sector and Country Strategy and Program \n\n49. \nThe  CSP  highlights  rapid  GDP  growth  in  Viet  Nam,  averaging  7.5%  over  the  past \ndecade,  arising  from  strong  export  performance  (with  exports  representing  61%  of  GDP  in \n2005),  increased  employment  share  in  manufacturing  and  services,  and  high  inward \nremittances.  Accession  to  WTO  in  January  2007  will  facilitate  sustained  export  growth  and \nongoing  diversification  in  manufacturing  and  services,  as  well  as  the  ongoing  development  of \nthe private sector. It is estimated the private sector accounted for almost 90% of the 7.5 million \njobs created in 2005, of which 64% were generated by SMEs. The CSP highlights the need for \n\u201cthe  Government  and  ADB\u2026to  focus  on  facilitating  increased  private  sector  investment  and \ndeveloping market institutions needed to promote competitiveness and create jobs.\u201d30\n \nBusiness-Led  Growth.  Support  for  business-led  growth  is  a  major  focus  of  the  CSP. \n50. \nSector  and  subsector  selection  has  been  prioritized  on  the  basis  of  the  following  factors:  (i) \nADB\u2019s  successes  and  comparative  advantages,  (ii)  the  Government\u2019s  needs  underlined  by \ncontinued  commitment  to  policy  and  institutional  reforms,  (iii)  bottlenecks  that  hamper  the \ncreation of an enabling environment for inclusive business-led growth and job creation, and (iv) \nevidence  of  a  financing  gap  that  cannot  be  met  by  private  or  grant  financing. 31   The \ncomplementary lease and SME credit loan fully meets the Government\u2019s objective of improving \nSME  integration  in  the  formal  financial  sector  through  lease  financing  and  creates  a \ndemonstration effect for the banking industry on complementary product development.  \n \n51. \nADB supports the development of the financial sector through assistance to banks and \nnonbank  financial  institutions  such  as  leasing  and  insurance  companies.  ADB\u2019s  Medium-Term \nStrategy  II  (2006\u20132008) 32   sets  as  a  priority  strengthening  the  financial  sector  in  member \ncountries. \n \n52. \nThe CSP identifies the need for ADB to assist in developing capital markets, particularly \nthe  bond  market,  in  Viet  Nam.  As  the  primary  market  for  leasing  develops\u2014and  as  leasing \ncompanies  develop  leases  with  both  fixed  and  flexible  rates,  thus  allowing  for  standardizing \nlease documents\u2014there will be an opportunity to refinance the lease portfolio as it gains volume. \nThis will eventually allow the issuance of lease-backed securities.  \n \n53. \nFinally, the CSP envisages a rapid migration of Vietnamese from rural to urban areas in \nthe  coming  years.  This  loan  will  facilitate  employment  generation  by  SMEs  to  absorb  this \ngrowing  labor  supply.  The  project  contributes  to  developing  SMEs  by  extending  the  term \nstructure of available financial lease products.   \n \n54. \nADB\u2019s  Support  for  Leasing. ADB\u2019s initiative to address the issue of leasing builds on \nits private sector activities in this area. ADB actively promotes the leasing industry in Asia and \nhas provided technical assistance to support the emergence of this activity, which has proved its \neffectiveness, particularly in countries where the banking sector was not able to offer loans with \nadequate tenor to secure the acquisition of capital goods.  \n \n\n                                                 \n30 ADB. 2006.

Sacombank  and  SLC \nwill  be  required  to  maintain  an  environmental  management  system  following  the  guidelines \nagreed  with  ADB.  Sacombank  and  SLC  continue  to  receive  IFC  technical  assistance  on \nenvironmental due diligence upgrading, most recently on clean technologies.    \n \nC. \n\nAnticorruption Policy and Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism \n\nAs an FSPL II policy action, the Government set up and operationalized the Anti-Money \n56. \nLaundering  Information  Center  in  SBV  to  support  the  Anti-Money  Laundering  Decree \nimplemented in 2005. The staffing of the center and the implementation of standard operating \nprocedures supported by an information technology system will allow for monitoring commercial \nbank transactions by end-2008. Viet Nam is now a member of the Asia/Pacific Group on Money \nLaundering.  Vietcombank  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to \ndate) and policy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n(2003).Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency, \nADB  will  require  in  the  reimbursement  and  indemnity  agreements  that  Sacombank  institute, \nmaintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following international best practice \nstandards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money  laundering  activities  or  the \nfinancing  of  terrorism.

Loan  classifications \nand  provision  for  losses  are  made  in  accordance  with  SBV\u2019s  Decision  No.  493/2005/QD-NHNN, \ndated 22 April 2005, and Decision No. 18/2007/QD-NHNN, dated 25 April 2007. Commercial banks \nusing Vietnamese accounting standards determine provisioning for NPLs on the basis of \u201cpassage \nof time,\u201d as indicated in Article 6 of the decision. Commercial banks that have made the transition \nto international financial reporting standards rely on provisioning based on a \u201cdiscounted cash flow\u201d \nvaluation of NPLs, as indicated in Article 7 of the decision. SBV has set the haircuts to be taken on \ndifferent types of collateral before calculating provision. \n \n\nTable A1.

ENVIRONMENT GUIDING THE LEASING SECTOR IN VIET NAM \n\nPolicy Reforms in the Leasing Sector  \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  Government  of  Viet  Nam  (the  Government)  implemented  a  series  of  policy  and  legal \n1. \nreforms under the Financial Sector Program Loan (FSPL) II and the Sector Development Program \nLoan  to  assist  the  development  of  the  leasing  sector.  Leasing  companies  are  licensed  and \nregulated by the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) and regarded as nonbank credit institutions under \nthe Law on Credit Institutions. SBV\u2019s Decree 16/2001 ND/-CP, issued on 2 May 2001, provided the \nbroad  legal  framework  for  leasing  operations.  The  decree  authorizes  only  those  financial  leasing \ncompanies  licensed  by  SBV  to  undertake  finance  leasing  transactions.  The  activities  of  leasing \ncompanies  were  initially  restricted  to  financial  leasing  for  machinery,  equipment,  vehicles,  other \nmoveable assets, and other services related to financial leasing operations.  \n \n2. \nThe  Government  issued  Decree  65/2005/ND-CP  on  19  May  2005  to  amend  Decree  16, \nallowing  for  operating  leasing,  the  sale  of  finance  lease  receivables  and  lease  back,  and \nsyndicated lease transactions. Decree 65 provides for a limit of exposure to a single client equal to \n30%  of  all capital  of  a  finance  leasing  company  and  outlines  the  broad  procedures  for  enforcing \nleasing contracts. However, inconsistencies remain in the implementing guidelines on enforcement \nas  reviewed  with  the  Government  and  leasing  companies  in  interministerial  consultations  held  at \nSBV  in  the  second  and  third  quarter  of  2007.  FSPL  III,  approved  in  2007,  will  maintain  a  policy \ndialogue  with  the  Government  on  continuing  measures  to  improve  enforcement  procedures  as \nreviewed in interministerial consultations.  \n \nOn  25  August  2008,  the  Government  issued  Decree  95/2008/ND-CP,  amending  some  of \n3. \nthe  articles  of  Decree  16/2001/ND/CP  of  2  May  2001,  on  the  organization  and  operation  of \nfinancial  leasing  companies.  The  new  decree  clarifies  that  a  financial  leasing  company  is  a \nnonbank  credit  institution,  a  Vietnamese  entity  that  is  established  and  operates  in  Viet  Nam  as \neither of the following (refer also to para. 38 of the main text of the report and recommendation of \nthe President): (i) a shareholding company, (ii) a limited company of at least two members, and (iii) \na limited company of one member. Joint venture financial leasing companies (none at present) and \n100%  foreign-invested  financial  leasing  companies  (two),  are  respectively  in  the  last  two \ncategories. These entities are eligible to obtain an operating license if their total corporate assets \nare over $10 billion at the end of the preceding year. \n \nB. \n \nThe  financial  leasing  industry  is  regulated  by  a  complex  matrix  of  appropriate  laws 34  \n4. \nRegulation  by  SBV  is  through  the  issue  of  circulars  and  decisions  and  through  inspection,  both \nonsite and off. Offsite inspection is on a continuous reporting basis, while onsite inspection is every \n3  years,  unless  circumstances  require  more  frequent  inspections.  Inspection  is  undertaken  from \nHanoi.  In  the  past  12  months,  warnings  have  been  given  in  respect  of  asset  concentration  and \nclient concentration. Inspection is traditional and not risk based.  \n \nFinancial leasing companies are required to provide the inspector with their procedures for \n5. \nrescheduling  the  period  of  lease  payments. 35   Leasing  companies  do  not  currently  have \n                                                 \n34  See  the  Decree  on  the  Organisation  and  Operation  of  Finance  Leasing  Companies,  the  Credit  Institutions  Law02-\n1997-QH10, the Financial Leasing companies, being defined as credit institutions, the Law on the State Bank of Viet \nNam 06-1997-QHX and the Decree on Security Transactions 163/2006/ND-CP 29. 12. 2006, the Civil Code and the \nCommercial  Law.  Decision  1675/2004/QD-NHNN  dated  23  December  2004  of  the  State  Bank  of  Viet  Nam \npromulgating regulations on organization and operation of banking inspector. \n\nLegal and Regulatory Environment for the Financial Leasing Industry \n\n35 See Circular 05/2006/TT-NHNN 25 July 2006, article 11.2.b. \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n       Appendix 3 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Private Legal Regime \n\n \nrescheduling  policies  and  rely  upon  the  policies  of  their  parent  banks.  Apart  from  this  issue,  the \nlegal  regulatory  regime  is  detailed,  prescriptive,  and  in  line  with  appropriate  practice.  There  are \nissues in respect of the implementation of some of the decrees. \n \nSBV Decision 03/2007/QD-NHNN, issued in January 2007, places a cap equivalent to 10% \n6. \nof  parent  bank  equity  on  parent  bank  funding  to  subsidiary  leasing  companies  and  requires \nonlending to be extended at commercial interbank rates. There have been no further changes or \nrevisions to Decision 3 to date in 2008.  \n \n7. \nValue-added  tax  is  applied  on  the  purchase  of  assets  for  lease  but  not  on  the  lease \ntransactions. The input credit is passed to the lessee, and there is no double taxation upon the sale \nof  a  leased asset  to  a lessee.36 Satisfactory  provision  of  depreciation  is  found  in  the Decision  on \nthe Regime on Management, Use, and Calculation of Fixed Assets.37\n \nC. \n \n8. \nAdditional  specifications  in  the  financial  leasing  agreement  are  required  to  adequately \nminimize of risk for the financial leasing company and to assist it in recovering its leased asset in \nthe event of default. It is unclear from the civil code whether the power of attorney can be used in \nrepossession. This will be clarified under further due diligence. \n \nD.  \n \nRepossession is reported by the financial leasing companies as being difficult. To address \n9. \nthis, Decree No 65 was passed in May 2005. It provides for self help in the recovery of the leased \nassets without the intervention of the courts. The implementation of the decree has been difficult, \nwith public officials not applying or enforcing it. This matter needs to be addressed under FSPL III. \n \n10. \nrespect of bankruptcy proceedings have been drawn and are operational.38\n \nThe  practical  implementation  of  the  Bankruptcy  Law  is  a  problem.  It  is  a  complex  and \n11. \nspecialized  area  of  the  law  requiring  additional  training  for  the  judiciary,  the  legal  profession, \naccountants,  officers  of  financial  leasing  companies,  and  others  involved  in  the  financial  system. \nAs  an  important  part  of  the  armory  for  recovering  debts  due  to  financial  leasing  companies, \nattention to this matter is required, and it is being addressed under FSPL III. \n \nE. \n \nTechnical assistance (TA) 4781 undertook a series of consultations with leasing companies \n12. \nto upgrade lease agreements and thus reduce the risks and costs of repossession. Four pro forma \nlease  agreements  were  developed  under  the  technical  assistance  for  Small  and  Medium-Sized \nEnterprise Development Program\u2013Subprogram II39 adapted to individuals, private companies, and \npublic companies, as well as for airplanes. In 2008, leasing companies have begun to implement \n\nBankruptcy  Law  No:  21/2004/QH11  is  modern  and  effectively  drawn.
