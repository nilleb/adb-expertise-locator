Conversion of $150 million into a tranche to finance project 2 of the Green Power \nDevelopment  and  Energy  Efficiency  Improvement  Investment  Program  in  the  Democratic \nSocialist Republic of Sri Lanka is proposed for Board consideration.1 \n \nII.  BACKGROUND \n2.  Sri Lanka has a national investment program including sector investments that are \nbased on the National Energy Policy and Strategies, which includes a sector road map, a long-\nterm investment plan, and policy and reform measures.2 By 2020, the government intends to \n(i)  increase power supply capacity and reduce generation cost, (ii) increase the share of energy \nsupply from nonconventional renewable energy to 20%,3 and (iii) reduce network losses to 10%. \nThe 20% increase in power generation from nonconventional renewable sources will add to \n29%  (2014)  of  conventional  hydropower  generation  and  will  ensure  that  in  the  future  a \nsubstantial portion of electricity is produced by clean energy sources.4 \n \n3.  The multitranche facility (MFF) is financing part of the government\u2019s energy investment \nprogram that was estimated at $4.8 billion for 2014\u20132020. The MFF was designed to support \nthe green power development and energy efficiency improvement portion of the government\u2019s \nenergy  sector  investment  program  by  (i)  financing  hydropower  development,  (ii) expanding \ntransmission and medium-voltage infrastructure to improve network efficiency and enable power \nevacuation  of  renewable  energy  in  the  system,  (iii) piloting  innovative  demand-side \nmanagement technologies, and (iv) supporting capacity building and project management. \n \n4.  Through a periodic financing request dated 19 August 2016, the government requested \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) loans totaling $150 million and a $30 million equivalent loan \nfrom Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement to be partially administered by ADB to finance the \nproject  2  outputs:  (i)  transmission  infrastructure  enhanced,  (ii)  medium-voltage  network \nefficiency improved, and (iii) demand-side management for energy efficiency improved.5 The \nimpact of project 2 will be increased access to clean and reliable power supply. The outcome \nwill be enhanced system efficiency and reliability. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE ON ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT \n5.  The proposed tranche is classified under environmental impact category A under ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  220-kilovolt  Mannar\u2013Nadukuda  transmission  line \ninvolves  power  evacuation  from  planned  300-megawatt  wind  farms  and  passes  through  a \nRamsar wetland area for 7.5 kilometers.6 The project-affected area supports critical habitat. The \nproject may have the potential for adverse impacts on the Ramsar wetland and the migratory \nand congregatory water birds that the wetland supports. An environmental impact assessment \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche \nFinancing Facility to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Green Power Development and Energy \nEfficiency Improvement Investment Program. Manila. \n2  Government of Sri Lanka. 2008. National Energy Policy and Strategies of Sri Lanka. Colombo. \n3  Nonconventional renewable energy includes mini hydropower (up to 10-megawatt capacity), wind, solar, and \nbiomass. \n4  Ceylon Electricity Board. 2015. Statistical Digest 2014. Colombo. \n5  Periodic Financing Request Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in the appendix). \n6  The Ramsar wetland is designated by Sri Lanka under the Ramsar Convention that advocates for the conservation \nand wise use of wetlands. The proposed transmission line will pass through the wetland area following the route of \nthe old damaged 33-kilovolt line in parallel to the existing operational railway that also crosses the Ramsar area.  \n ", "2    \n(EIA) including an environmental management plan (EMP) was prepared to assess the potential \nadverse environmental impacts.7 The EIA was informed by 2-year avifauna and marine fauna \nsurveys in the affected area. Avian collision risk assessment for the transmission line and the \nwind farms, as associated facilities, was carried out. Mitigation measures are proposed in the \nEIA and EMP to minimize habitat and species disturbance as a result of construction and \npotential bird collision with the overhead transmission line. Implementation of the biodiversity \nmanagement plan will ensure no net loss of biodiversity. Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the \nexecuting agency, has committed to undertake further assessment and manage the impacts \nand risks of bird collision with wind turbines by curtailment during the breeding and migratory \nseason if necessary. The EIA was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 7 July 2016. \n \n6.  Potential environmental impacts of other transmission and distribution infrastructure are \nsite  specific;  mostly  temporary  during  construction;  and  readily  mitigated  by  adherence  to \nnational and international environmental standards, design criteria, and management practices \nas  set  out  in  the  EMP.  Sensitive  ecosystems  will  not  be  impacted.  Initial  environmental \nexamination reports including relevant EMPs were prepared to mitigate the potential adverse \nimpacts and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 19 August 2016. The demand-side management \noutput  will  have  minimal  environmental  footprint.  The  project\u2019s  environmental  safeguard \ndocuments were prepared in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, the MFF\u2019s \nenvironmental assessment and review framework, and Sri Lankan environmental regulations. \n \n7.  Public consultations on the transmission line and the first phase 100-megawatt wind \nfarm  were  conducted  with  local  communities,  government  authorities,  and  nongovernment \norganizations, including ornithological societies, and their feedback was taken into account \nduring project design. Public concerns were identified in the EIA, and mitigation measures were \nincorporated  in  the  EMP.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  will  be  set  up  at  project \ncommencement. All complaint-related documentation will be summarized and become part of \nthe environmental monitoring report that will be submitted to ADB. If the grievances cannot be \naddressed through the grievance redress mechanism, the complainant can seek legal redress \nof their grievances in appropriate courts. Corrective actions will be taken for unanticipated \nimpacts and inadequate safeguard implementation. Consultations with project stakeholders will \ncontinue through the pre-construction, construction, and operation stages. \n \n8.  CEB has experience in implementing ADB-financed projects, and it established a project \nmanagement unit for the tranche. CEB will retain qualified and experienced external experts or \nqualified  nongovernment  organizations  to  verify  monitoring  information  on  the Mannar\u2013\nNadukuda transmission line. Contractors will be required to comply with the EMP during the pre-\nconstruction and construction stages under close monitoring of the external experts and CEB. In \ncase the implementation of EMP measures is not satisfactory, the external consultants will \nrecommend actions to enhance environmental compliance. CEB will provide environmental \nmonitoring reports to ADB on a quarterly basis while works are ongoing within the Ramsar area \nand semiannually thereafter. These reports will be disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. \n \nIV.  RECOMMENDATION \n9.  The President recommends that the Board authorize the conversion of $150,000,000 \ninto a tranche to finance project 2 of the Green Power Development and Energy Efficiency \nImprovement Investment Program in the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.   \n                                                \n7  Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in the appendix).
