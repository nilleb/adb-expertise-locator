The  report  also  describes  proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  Effective  Reservoir  Utilization  for  Integrated  Water  Resources \nManagement,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nThe  PRC  has  developed  rapidly.  From  1978  to  2008,  its  economy  grew  by  about 10% \n2. \nper  year  on  average.  This  rapid  economic  growth  has  depended  in  part  on  reservoirs,  which \nhave been important in flood control, irrigation, hydropower generation, and water supply. The \nreservoirs in the PRC have a total storage capacity of about 554 billion cubic meters (m3), about \none-sixth of the total yearly runoff nationwide. They control an irrigation area of about 16 million \nhectares  (ha),  about  one-third  of  the  country\u2019s  total  irrigation  area.  Their  total  generation \ncapacity of about 70 million kilowatts is about one-third of the total national power generation. \nThe reservoirs provide about 500 billion m3 of water supply yearly, about 20 billion m3 of this for \nhousehold  use.  In  1998,  1,335  large  and  medium-sized  reservoirs  in  the  PRC  stored  about \n53 billion  m3  of  floodwater  and  protected  more  than  200  cities  and  2.3  million  ha  of  farmland \nfrom flooding, reducing the number of people who fell victim to flooding by 27.4 million.  \n \nThe  PRC  has  87,085  reservoirs.1 About  90%  were  built  during  the  period  of  the  Great \n3. \nLeap  Forward  and  the  Cultural  Revolution  (1958\u20131976),  using  outdated  and  low  technical \nstandards  and  inadequate  plans,  surveys,  designs,  and  construction.  Most  of  these  reservoirs \nhave  been  used  for  30\u201350  years,  and  many  of  the  water-retaining  dams  and  equipment  are \ndamaged  and  need  to  be  repaired  and  strengthened.  Many  of  the  reservoirs  do  not  meet \nmodern safety standards.  \n \n4. \nThe  PRC  has  three  safety  classes  of  reservoirs  according  to  the  Safety  Assessment \nMethods  for  Dams 2  and  the  Guidelines  on  Dam  Safety  Assessment. 3 In  the  class III  (most \nunsafe)  category  are  37,032  reservoirs,  43%  of  the  total. 4  The  potential  failure  of  class III \nreservoirs  threatens  lives  and  property  downstream.  In  1954\u20132007,  3,503  reservoirs\u2014an \naverage of 65 reservoirs each year\u2014collapsed and killed at least 27,876 people in the PRC.  \n \n5. \nThe  storage  water  level  of  many  reservoirs  was  originally  designed  to  match  the \nhydrometeorological features of the watershed and downstream water demand. Now, however, \nmany  endangered  reservoirs  do  not  store  water  up  to  the  design  level  because  of  water \nleakage,  instability  of  water-retaining  dams,  and  inadequate  spillway  capacity  for  emergency \ndischarge of rapidly rising floodwaters. As a result, these endangered reservoirs cannot control \nfloods, supply irrigation water, generate hydropower, or provide household water year-round to \n\n                                                 \n1  The  data  are  as  of  the  end  of  2006.  Not  included  are  reservoirs  in  Hong  Kong,  China;  Macau,  China;  and \n\nTaipei,China. \n\n2  Ministry of Water Resources. 1995. Safety Assessment Methods for Dams. Document No. 86.

SL258-2000. Beijing. \n4  The data are as of the end of 2006. The number of class III reservoirs is changing as reservoirs are rehabilitated \nand  new  ones  enter  into  this  class.  The  class  III  reservoirs  are  below  national  standards  in  actual  flood  control \ncapacity, do not work as designed, and pose a high safety risk. \n\n\fusers.  Strengthening  these  reservoirs  will  increase  water  supply  at  a  lower  cost  and  with  less \nadverse  impact  on  the  environment  and  people  than  building  new  reservoirs.  Strengthened \nreservoirs  will  also  have  potentially  positive  benefits  downstream,  especially  on \nthe \nenvironment, by increasing reservoir releases for environmental flow. The 1,346 reservoirs that \nwere  recently  rehabilitated  are  estimated  to  have  increased  the  storage  capacity  by \n500 million m3,  equivalent  to  the  increase  in  capacity  from  the  construction  of  540  new \nmedium-sized reservoirs. The cost of reservoir rehabilitation per cubic-meter increase in storage \ncapacity (CNY2\u2013CNY3) is lower than the cost of new reservoir construction (CNY6). \n \nThe  government  has  given  high  priority  to  strengthening  endangered  reservoirs.  The \n6. \nMinistry of Water Resources set up the National Reservoir Strengthening Program in 2001, with \nfinancial assistance from the government. The first phase of this program has been successfully \ncompleted,  and  1,346  reservoirs  are  now  operating  at  design  capacity.  The  second  phase, \ninvolving  the  strengthening  of  2,112  class  III  reservoirs,  began  in  2003.  To  speed  up  the \nrehabilitation of unsafe reservoirs, the third phase of the program was prepared in October 2007 \nspecifically for 6,240 reservoirs, including those uncompleted in the second phase. \n \nthe \nThe  National  Reservoir  Strengthening  Program  will  be  completed  during \n7. \n11th Five-Year  Plan  period  (2006\u20132010).  But  reservoir  rehabilitation  will  continue  beyond  the \nprogram.  More  than  30,000  unsafe  reservoirs  still  have  to  be  rehabilitated,  and  class  I  and  II \nreservoirs,  which  are  not  part  of  the  program,  are  foreseen  to  deteriorate  and  urgently  need \nrehabilitation. In addition, reservoirs rehabilitated under the program must be properly operated, \nmaintained, and managed for safety and effective use; otherwise, the rehabilitation would have \nbeen  futile.  To  address  these  issues,  sustainable  reservoir  rehabilitation  and  management \nmodels  should  be  established  in  a  province  where  reservoir  safety  is  a  serious  issue,  and \nsuccessful models should be replicated throughout the PRC. \n \n8. \nShandong Province, in the lower reaches of the Yellow River in northeastern PRC, has a \npopulation  of  about  92  million,  the  second  largest  in  the  PRC.  It  is  among  the  country\u2019s \nfastest-developing provinces, but it is also a province where water scarcity is most serious, with \nwater  resources  per  capita  of  about  one-sixth  of  the  national  average.  Saltwater  intrusion  into \ncoastal  catchments  has  rendered  the  available  water  resources  less  usable.  Rapid  economic \ndevelopment in recent years has been increasing the demand for water. \n \n9. \nReservoir  safety  is  of  great  concern  to  Shandong  Province,  among  other  provinces  in \nthe PRC. Of its 5,820 reservoirs, 4,114\u201471%, the highest proportion in the country\u2014are in the \nmost  unsafe  (class III)  category. 5 Reservoirs  in  the  province  collapsed  255  times  and  killed \n225 people in 1966\u20132008, for a reservoir collapse ratio of 4.4%, much higher than the national \naverage of 4.0%.  \n \nThe People\u2019s Government of Shandong Province (SPG) recognizes the urgent need for \n10. \nreservoir  rehabilitation  as  well  as  the  importance  of  managing  the  rehabilitated  reservoirs \nproperly to  be able to use them safely and effectively for economic development.  Besides the \n137  class III  reservoirs  in  Shandong  Province  that  are  included  in  the  National  Reservoir \nStrengthening  Program,  other  unsafe  reservoirs  in  the  province  are  being  rehabilitated \naccording to a plan drawn up by the SPG.6 But the provincial government is facing technological \nand  financing  difficulties.  It  seeks  methodologies  for  rehabilitating  a  huge  number  of  unsafe \n\n                                                 \n5  The data are as of the end of 2008. \n6   SPG. 2008.

ADB\u2019s  assistance \nwill give the SPG access to international expertise and experience in reservoir rehabilitation and \nmanagement.  The  established  models  will  be  used  in  Shandong  Province  and  replicated \nthroughout the PRC. \n \n12. \nThe proposed project will contribute to integrated water resources management (IWRM) \nby establishing sustainable reservoir rehabilitation and management models, and is therefore in \nline with the priorities of ADB\u2019s water policy in promoting IWRM. The project is also in line with \nthe  country  partnership  strategy  (2008\u20132010)  for  the  PRC,  which  assigns  priority  to \nenvironmental  sustainability  through  more  effective  natural  resources  management,  and \nsupports the government\u2019s objectives in the water sector.7 \n \nThe project will have a direct positive impact on poverty reduction and the environment \n13. \nsince  it  will  (i) reduce  the  risk  of  reservoir  failure  and  protect  lives,  property,  and  livelihoods \ndownstream,  where  poverty  incidence  is  high;  (ii) provide  more  water  for  agriculture  and \nhousehold use to the poor living downstream of the reservoirs; and (iii) improve the quantity of \nreservoir releases, especially in the dry season, to sustain wetlands and the health of flora and \nfauna, maintain fisheries, preserve water quality, and improve groundwater resources.  \n \nADB\u2019s experience in the PRC indicates that water resources management projects in the \n14. \ncountry are generally well planned and implemented. Reflecting lessons learned from previous \nprojects, the project design requires (i) strong commitment to the project by the executing and \nimplementing  agencies,  including  the  provision  of  adequate  financial  and  staff  resources; \n(ii) thorough  review  of  technical  designs  and  technologies,  rigorous  economic    and  financial \nanalysis, and detailed assessment of cash flows and social issues; (iii) comprehensive analysis \nof the institutional capacity of the executing and implementing agencies and adequate capacity \ndevelopment  of  these  agencies  at  various  levels;  (iv) thorough  guidance  of  the  executing  and \nimplementing  agencies  on  ADB  policies,  guidelines,  and  procedures  for  resettlement, \nenvironmental  protection,  and  procurement;  and  (v) the  introduction  of  an  appropriate  project \nperformance management system.  \n \nSeveral  projects  have  brought  out  the  importance  of  sound  watershed  management. \n15. \nCommunities  have  been  flooded  after  storms  or  prolonged  rains  partly  because  of  denuded \nuplands  and  watersheds.  A  number  of  irrigation  and  rural  development  projects  have  also \nunderscored the dangers of improper watershed management, and flood control projects have \nshown the necessity of strengthening IWRM. River basin development demands an integrated \nand  coordinated  approach  involving  upper  watershed  management  and  conservation,  and \ndownstream  rural  development.  The  design  of  the  project  reflects  all  of  these  lessons.  The \nsustainable reservoir management model to be established under the project will assist the SPG \nin setting out principles and procedures for watershed management. \n \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2008.

The outcome will be the sustainable rehabilitation and management of reservoirs. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n17. \nThe  project  will  establish  sustainable  reservoir  rehabilitation  and  management  models \nfor  replication  throughout  the  PRC,  through  a  cycle  of  rehabilitation,  management,  monitoring, \nand  evaluation  of  model  reservoirs.  It  will  have  three  components:  (i) rehabilitation  of  model \nreservoirs,  (ii) establishment  of  sustainable  reservoir  rehabilitation  and  management  models, \nand (iii) project management support.  \n \n18. \nComponent  1:  Rehabilitation  of  model  reservoirs.  The  project  will  rehabilitate  nine \nendangered  reservoirs  so  that  they  meet  modern  technical  standards  of  safety.  These  nine \nreservoirs  will  become  model  reservoirs  for  the  sustainable  rehabilitation  and  management  of \nreservoirs.8 Through the monitoring and evaluation of technologies used in the rehabilitation of \nthe  model  reservoirs,  technical  guidelines  for  reservoir  rehabilitation  will  be  established  under \ncomponent 2.  Also  to  be  set  up  under  component 2  were  methodologies  for  reservoir \nrehabilitation  planning  and  proper  reservoir  management,  which  will  be  established  by  being \npilot-tested at the model reservoirs.  \n \n19. \nComponent  2:  Establishment  of  sustainable  reservoir  rehabilitation  and \nmanagement  models.  The project will develop a model for sustainable reservoir rehabilitation \nand  management,  consisting  of  (i) technical  guidelines  for  reservoir  rehabilitation,  (ii) a \nmethodology  for  estimating  the  risk  of  dam  failure  due  to  hydrologic  overloading,  (iii) a \nrisk-based  methodology  for  reservoir  rehabilitation  planning,  (iv) a  reservoir  portfolio  database \nfor the province, (v) watershed management measures, and (vi) a reservoir safety management \nmodel. \n \n20. \nPractical  and  cost-effective  technologies  for  reservoir  rehabilitation  will  be  developed \nthrough  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  technologies  used  in  the  rehabilitation  of  the  model \nreservoirs,  a  review  of  pertinent  guidelines,  and  an  assessment  of  the  applicability  of  current \ninternational  rehabilitation  technologies  to  reservoirs  in  the PRC.  Methodologies  for  estimating \nthe  probability  of  dam  failure  due  to  hydrologic  overloading  and  for  systematically  ranking  the \nhuge  number  of  reservoirs  will  be  established  by  being  pilot-tested  at  the  model  reservoirs  to \nprovide  a  factual  basis  for  rehabilitation  planning.  Functions  will  be  added  to  the  reservoir \nportfolio database for the province to enable the SPG to (i) estimate the risk of reservoir failure, \n(ii) estimate  the  adverse  effects  of  reservoir  failure,  (iii) rank  reservoirs  on  the  basis  of  the \nforegoing  estimates,  and  (iv) assess  the  economic  impact  of  reservoirs  before  and  after \nrehabilitation.  Watershed  management  measures  that  will  improve  water  quality  and  reduce \nsedimentation in the model reservoirs will be identified on the basis of an assessment of water \nquality and sedimentation in these reservoirs, and current watershed management activities for \nthe reservoirs. A reservoir safety management model will be established for the operation and \nmaintenance, safety evaluation, post-earthquake safety inspection, emergency responsiveness, \nand financing of the model reservoirs, which will also be provided with facilities and equipment \n\n                                                 \n8  In  addition  to  these  nine  reservoirs,  during  project  implementation,  about  10  small  reservoirs  which  will  be \nrehabilitated  separately  from  the  project  will  also  be  selected  as  model  reservoirs  and  surveyed  for  the \nestablishment of sustainable reservoir rehabilitation and management models. \n\n \n\n\fIn addition, a model for the effective use of the reservoirs for IWRM will be established \n\nfor operation and management. The SPG and the implementing agencies will secure adequate \nfunds for the operation and maintenance of all project facilities.  \n \n21. \nunder an associated TA. \n \n22. \nComponent  3:  Project  management  support.  Through  training  and  workshops,  the \nproject  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  SPG  and  the  implementing  agencies,  including  the \nprovincial  project  management  office  and  the  local  project  management  offices,  for  (i) the \nsustainable  rehabilitation  and  management  of  reservoirs;  (ii) the  effective  use  of  reservoirs  for \nIWRM; and (iii) project management, including project monitoring and evaluation, procurement, \ndisbursement, resettlement, and environmental protection. The project will also provide the SPG \nwith project management consultants, and the implementing agencies with office equipment and \nvehicles for project management.  \n\nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $90.09 million (Table 1).  \n\n23. \n \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \n \nB. \nC. \n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nBase Costb \n1. \n2. \n\nRehabilitation of model reservoirs \nEstablishment of sustainable reservoir rehabilitation and \nmanagement models \nProject management support \n              Subtotal (A) \n\n3. \n \nContingenciesc \nFinancial Charges during Implementationd \n \n                            Total (A+B+C) \n\nAmounta \n\n \n\n53.55 \n19.94 \n\n11.28 \n84.77 \n  4.26 \n  1.05 \n90.09 \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank. \na  Includes taxes and duties of $3.01 million to be financed from the ADB loan and the government resources. \nb  In 2010 prices. \nc  Physical  contingencies  were  computed  at  5%  of  base  cost.

The government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \n\n                                                 \n9  Includes funds for services (such as transportation and insurance) related to goods (equipment and materials) that \n\nare material and relevant to the success of the project. \n\n10 The  calculation  of  taxes  and  duties  to  be  financed  under  the  project  is  based  on  the  following  principles:  (i) the \namount  of  taxes  and  duties  financed  by  the  ADB  loan  should  not  represent  an  excessive  share  of  the  project \ninvestment plan, (ii) the taxes and duties should apply only to ADB-financed expenditures, and (iii) the financing of \ntaxes and duties should be material and relevant to the success of the project. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\funder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB.  \n \n25. \nThe  ADB  loan  will  finance  33.1%  of  the  project  cost  (base  cost,  including  taxes  and \nduties).  The  Government  of  the  PRC  will  finance  28.2%,  and  the  SPG  20.2%  (base  cost, \nincluding  taxes  and  duties,  and  physical  contingency).  The  county  governments  will  finance \n18.6% (base cost, including taxes and duties; and costs for land acquisition, resettlement, and \nenvironmental  protection;  physical  and  price  contingencies;  and  financial  charges  during \nimplementation).11 The PRC will be the borrower of the loan; it will make the proceeds available \nto  the  SPG,  and  hence  to  the  municipal  governments  and  to  the  project  county  governments. \nThe  loan  proceeds  made  available  to  the  SPG,  the  municipal  governments,  and  the  project \ncounty  governments  will  carry  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  those  of  the  ADB  loan.  The \ncounty  governments  will  assume  the  foreign  exchange  and  interest  rate  variation  risks  on  the \nADB loan. Counterpart funds will be self-financed by the government, the SPG, and the county \ngovernments.

The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $625,000 \nequivalent, of which $300,000 will be financed from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF\u2013other  sources).  The  Multi-Donor  Trust  Fund  under  the  Water  Financing  Partnership \nFacility will provide cofinancing of $200,000 equivalent on a grant basis, to be administered by \nADB.14 The Multi-Donor Trust Fund will be used to establish an effective reservoir use model for \nintegrated water use and to further increase environmental benefits downstream. The remaining \n$125,000  will  be  financed  by  the  SPG  through  in-kind  contributions,  including  the  services  of \ncounterpart staff and office accommodation. The TA will establish, for a selected river basin in \nShandong Province, model plans for (i) integrated water use, (ii) integrated flood management, \n\n                                                 \n14 Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, and Spain. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fand (iii) greater environmental benefits downstream; and will disseminate the established model \nand develop capacities for effective reservoir use through workshops and training. The SPG will \nbe the executing agency; and the city, district, and county governments in the model river basin \nwill  be  the  implementing  agencies.  The  leading  group  established  for  the  project  will  provide \noverall  guidance  for  TA  implementation.  The  provincial  project  management  office established \nfor  the  project  will  also  administer  day-to-day  TA  activities.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over \n24 months,  from  April  2011  to  March  2013.  International  (13  person-months)  and  national \nconsultants (25 person-months) will be recruited through quality- and cost-based selection at a \nquality\u2013cost weighting ratio of 80:20. \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n29. \nIndividual  reservoirs  and  the  project  as  a  whole  have  been  subjected  to  economic \nanalysis.  The  primary  economic  benefit  from  the  project  will  be  improved  flood  control.  Flood \ncontrol  benefits  cannot  be  overstated  considering  the  expected  increase  in  frequency  of \nextremes in weather as a result of climate change. These benefits were estimated by reservoir \ndesign  institutes  on  the  basis  of  extensive  survey  data  and  flood  mapping.  Improved  crop \nproduction with the expansion of the irrigated land area, and increased aquaculture production \nbecause  of  greater  water  retention,  will  be  secondary  benefits.  The  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn (EIRR) of the project is 16.2%; for the individual reservoirs, the EIRR ranges from 14.8% \nfor  Muyu  reservoir  to  20.8%  for  Yangzhuang  reservoir.  Both  the  project  as  a  whole  and  the \nindividual  reservoir  subprojects  are  therefore  economically  viable.  Sensitivity  analysis  has \nfurther  confirmed  that  the  economic  viability  will  remain  quite  robust  even  if  costs  should \nincrease or benefits decline in the future.  \n \n30. \nThe assessment of the financial viability and sustainability of the project considered the \nfollowing  aspects:  (i) the  fiscal  impact  of  counterpart  funding  of  project  expenditures,  (ii) the \nfinancial management capacity of the project, and (iii) the financial sustainability of the project. \nThe fiscal impact of counterpart funding for implementation will be insignificant compared with \nthe total fiscal revenues of the province and the local governments. The analysis concluded that \nthe  repayment  of  the  ADB  loan  will  not  significantly  affect  the  financial  capacity  of  the  county \ngovernments.  Recurrent  and  maintenance  costs  will  be  financed  by  funds  derived  from  water \nsupply tariffs and additional funds provided by the county governments.  \n\nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n31. \nAll  procurement  to  be  financed  under  the  ADB  loan  will  be  carried  out  according  to \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). The relevant sections of \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  will  be  included  in  all \nprocurement documents and contracts.  \n \n32. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy has been explained to and discussed with the Government \nof  the  PRC  and  the  SPG.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 12). \n\nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nThe project will (i) decrease the threat of reservoir failure and mitigate flood damage for \n33. \na population of 1.0 million, including 55,000 poor people; and (ii) increase irrigation water supply \nfrom 143.1 million m3 per year to 183.5 million m3 per year, and irrigation areas from 27,300 ha \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fto 38,300 ha for 587,000 persons, including 33,000 poverty persons. Such improvements could \nincrease the average yields and incomes for most downstream farmers, thus helping to reduce \npoverty.  The  project  will  also  improve  water  supply  conditions  for  180,000  persons,  including \n2,000  poor  persons.  During  project  implementation,  13,500  jobs  will  be  created  for  local \nunskilled persons, including poor persons, with at least 5 months of temporary employment.  \nNo significant gender issues are associated with any of the components of the project, \n34. \nbut  planned  developments  in  irrigation  and  water  supply  would  increase  women\u2019s  income. \nWomen\u2019s  living  standards  could  also  improve,  since  women  and  men  use  water  differently \n(particularly in the household) and are vulnerable in different ways to natural disasters such as \nfloods  (women,  for  example,  bear  more  responsibility  for  the  protection  of  children  and  older \npeople).  \n\nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\nLand  acquisition,  resettlement,  and \n\n35. \nindigenous  peoples.  Eight  of  the  nine \nsubprojects  will  require  land  acquisition  or  household  relocation,  but  the  impact  will  not  be \nsignificant.  The  project  is  in  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement,  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). In total, 20.2 ha of collectively owned land, 89% of which is \ncultivated  farmland,  will  be  affected  permanently.  Four  of  the  nine  subprojects  will  require  the \ndemolition of 1,056 square meters of housing and the relocation of six households with a total of \n27 persons.  Some  productive  assets,  ground  attachments,  basic  infrastructure,  and  special \nfacilities will also be affected. The implementing agencies, with the assistance of the consultants \nhired  under  the  project  preparatory  TA,  have  prepared  eight  resettlement  plans  and  one \ndue-diligence  report.  The  pre-examination  of  land  use  was  domestically  approved  for  all \nsubprojects.  The  local  governments  have  endorsed  the  plans  and  disclosed  the  relevant \ninformation  to  affected  persons.  The  key  issue  for  the  social  safeguards  is  ensuring  that  the \nlocal  governments  fulfill  their  commitment  to  provide  investment  financing  for  development \nprojects in the communities that were affected by the construction of the dams in 1960\u20131980.15 \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs  will  be  fully  financed  by  the  implementing  agencies. \nThere are no indigenous peoples within the project locations; the project is therefore in category \nC in this regard.  \n \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  in  environmental  category  B,  according  to  ADB\u2019s \n36. \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement.  An  environmental  assessment  of  the  project  conforming  to  the \nPRC regulatory framework and ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003) has been \ncarried  out.  The  initial  environmental  examination  report  summarizes  the  findings  of  the \nenvironmental assessment reports on the nine subprojects and the due-diligence review of the \nassociated  facilities.  Extensive  public  consultations  involving  stakeholder  and  focus  group \ndiscussions  were  undertaken  twice  during  project  preparation.  The  potential  adverse  impact \nduring rehabilitation and operation includes the limited standard impact of construction and the \nunsafe  disposal  of  dredged  sediments,  construction  spoil,  wastewater,  and  solid  waste.  This \nimpact  will  be  prevented  or  minimized  to  acceptable  levels  through  the  implementation  of  an \nenvironmental management plan with adequate mitigation and monitoring arrangements. \n\n                                                 \n15 In  2006,  the  central  government  required  local  governments  to  extend  post-resettlement  development  support  to \ncommunities that had to resettle because of the construction. Annual cash subsidies are being provided to eligible \npersons but development plans approved by the affected counties have been implemented too slowly. As of 2009, \nonly 12% of the investment budgeted for the nine reservoir subprojects had been spent. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe  major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\n37. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.16 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \nA dam safety panel of eminent national engineers has been \nestablished to review the rehabilitation of the reservoirs and \nprovide technical guidance. \n\nRisk \nReservoir safety.

The PPMO and \nLPMOs have the capacity to implement \nthe project but are less experienced in \nadministering foreign-funded projects. \n\nCapacity  development  workshops  in  procurement,  financial \nmanagement,  resettlement,  and  environmental  protection \nwere  held  under  the  project  preparatory  TA.  During  the \nimplementation  of  the  project,  the  capacity  of  the  SPG  and \nthe  PPMO  and \nthe \nLPMOs,  will  also  be  strengthened  under \nthe  project \nmanagement component, with the help of consultants.  \n\nimplementing  agencies, \n\nincluding \n\nLPMO  =  local  project  management  office,  PPMO  =  provincial  project  management  office,  SPG  =  People\u2019s \nGovernment of Shandong Province, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nThe Government of the PRC and the SPG have assured ADB that the implementation of \n38. \nthose  concerning \nto  all  applicable  ADB  policies, \nthe  project  shall  conform \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n \n39. \nfor the project, which are set forth in the loan and project agreements.  \n\nThe Government of the PRC and the SPG have agreed with ADB on certain covenants \n\nincluding \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n40. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$29,800,000  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Risk  Mitigation  and  Strengthening  of \nEndangered  Reservoirs  in  Shandong  Province  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources, \nwith  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)\u2013based lending facility;
