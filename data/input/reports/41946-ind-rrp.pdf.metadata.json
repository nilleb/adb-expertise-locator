The  proposed  loan  will  have  (i)  a tranche of  up to $250,000,000  funded  by the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  (ii)  a  tranche  of  up  to  $200,000,000  funded  by  ADB  and \nsyndicated  to  the  Export-Import  Bank  of  Korea  (KEXIM)  through  a  risk  participation  agreement. \nThe design and monitoring framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\nA. \n\nProject Background \n\n2. \nThe  Project  is  one  of  the  ultra  mega  power  projects  (UMPPs)  planned  by  the \nGovernment to ease India's current and pending electric power deficits. The Government has a \ntarget of \u201cPower for All\u201d by 2012. To meet the capacity addition targets required to achieve this \nobjective, the Ministry of Power launched an initiative facilitating the development of coal-based \nUMPPs. Development of large power projects can result in cheaper power through economies \nof  scale.  Recognizing  this,  the  Government  envisages  a  series  of  projects  of  at  least  4,000 \nmegawatts  (MW)  each.  These  projects  will  be  awarded  to  developers  identified  and  selected \nthrough international competitive tariff-based bidding processes. The projects will be developed \non  a  build-own-operate  basis.  Based  on  supercritical  technology,  these  projects  are  also \nexpected  to  be  more  environment  friendly  than  conventional  subcritical  generating  units.  India \nwill  be  dependent  upon  coal  as  a  fuel  for  a  large  portion  of  its  power  generation  for  the \nforeseeable  future  as  it  has  no  other  practical  alternatives.  Thus  the  issue  is  how  to  generate \npower from coal as cleanly as possible. The Project will be one of the new generation of cleaner \ncoal  projects  and  thus  merits  ADB's  active  support.  The  Project  will  contribute  significantly  to \nreducing power shortages in the country. \n \n3. \nTo  enhance  investor  confidence  and  reduce  risk  perception,  the  Government  is \nundertaking some groundwork before the projects are handed over to the selected developers. \nTasks for the Government include water linkage; environment and forest clearance; allocation of \nenergy  sales  to  offtakers;  and  substantial  progress  in  land  acquisition,  rehabilitation,  and \nresettlement-related  work.  These  tasks  are  to  be  undertaken  by  a  shell,  or  special  purpose \ncompany, formed specifically for each UMPP. Power Finance Corporation Limited (PFC) set up \nCGPL to be the special purpose company for the Project.  \n \n4. \nThe  Ministry  of  Power,  Central  Electricity  Authority,  and  PFC  are  working  on  the \ndevelopment of the UMPPs. PFC, as the nodal agency for project development, is responsible \nfor setting up the special purpose companies and developing them to a stage when they can be \ntransferred to the selected developers after the bid process. The Central Electricity Authority is \nto provide technical inputs on the various aspects of project conceptualization and development. \n \nBids for the selection of a developer for the Project opened on 18 December 2006. Six \n5. \nbids  were  received  and  the  Tata  Power  Company  Limited  (TPC)  was  short-listed.  On  28 \nDecember 2006, PFC issued a letter of intent in favor of TPC. \n \nCGPL  executed  the  power  purchase  agreement  and  other  project-related  agreements \n6. \non 22 April 2007. Subsequently, TPC purchased the entire shareholding of CGPL; CGPL is now \n\n \n\n \n\n\f 2 \n\na wholly owned subsidiary of TPC. CGPL will be responsible for the construction, operation, and \nmaintenance of the Project and for arranging the required debt finance. \n \n7. \nGiven  (i)  India's  need  for  generating  capacity  to  be  added  quickly  (ii)  public  sector \nlimitations,  (iii)  the  conventional  memorandum-of-understanding  route  for  private  sector-led \nadditions to add to capacity, the Government asked ADB for advice on new methods for adding \nlarge  blocks  of  capacity  quickly  and  transparently.  ADB  suggested  the  Government  follow  the \nADB-developed  Meghnaghat  model  successfully  adopted  by  Bangladesh.  This  was  accepted \nand  the  ultra  mega  power  program  was  developed  incorporating  the  Meghnaghat  model, \nadapted to Indian conditions. At each stage in the process, ADB was informally consulted; the \nGovernment asked ADB to explore every possible financing option to assist the Project. \n \nB. \n\nSector Background \n\n1. \n\nDemand and Supply of Power \n\nIndia continues to experience chronic electricity shortages, with peak demand exceeding \n8. \nsupply by 13.8% and the energy deficit at 9.6% in FY2007.1 Since FY1995, power demand has \ngrown rapidly as the economy expanded at an annual average of 6.8% in real terms.2 India is \nthe third largest electricity consumer in Asia, behind the People\u2019s Republic of China and Japan. \nPower  quality  remains  poor,  marked  by  high  voltage  fluctuations  and  recurring  load  shedding. \nIndustry  buys  approximately  35%  of  the  electricity  sold,  followed  by  households  at  25%, \nagriculture at 22%, and businesses and others at 17%.3 \n \nAs  of  31  December  2006,  India\u2019s  installed  power  generation  capacity  was  127,753 \n9. \nmegawatts (MW) (Table 1). Capacity addition was targeted for 41,110 MW during the 10th Five-\nYear Plan (FY2003\u2013FY2007); the actual capacity addition was 21,180 MW,4 i.e., some 52% of \nthe target. Energy shortfalls will persist over the short to medium term. \n \n\nTable 1: Summary of Installed Capacity as of 31 December 2006 \n(MW) \n\nThermal \nGas \n5,899\n3,500\n4,183\n13,582\n\nSector  Hydro \n\nNuclear  Renewable\n\nTotal \n\nOil \n\nTotal \n32,409\n42,589\n9,022\n84,020\n\nCoal \n24,020 \n37,386 \n2,831 \n64,237 \n\nLignite \n2,490\n465\n500\n3,455\n\n0\n2,568\n3,623\n6,191\n\n0\n1,239\n1,507\n2,746\n\n3,900 \n0 \n0 \n3,900 \n\n6,672 \n25,664 \n1,306 \n33,642 \n\n42,981\n70,821\n13,951\n127,753\n\nCentral \nState \nPrivate \nTotal \nMW = megawatt. \nSource: Ministry of Power. 2007.

The  program \n\nreform  of  state  organizations, \n\n13. \nState electricity boards (SEBs) have not performed well. Plagued by poor metering, low \ncollections, high receivables, and high theft and losses, they have not been able to recover the \nlosses  through  tariff  increases.  As  in  most  of  ADB\u2019s  developing  member  countries,  tariffs  in \nIndia are politically sensitive and held artificially low for political and social reasons. Many states \nprovide  subsidized  electricity  to  farmers  and  disadvantaged  households;  this  results  in  tariffs \nthat  are  significantly  below  the  cost  of  supply.  Consequently,  the  weaker  SEBs  have  exposed \npower generators to the problem of large accounts receivable. \n \n14. \nDuring  the  early  1990s,  the  SEB-dominated  power  industry  became  a  drain  on  the \nIndian economy and the Government recognized that changes were needed in the context of its \neconomic reform program. Initially the Government focused on increasing investment in power \ngeneration  by  opening  up  participation  to  private  power  providers  and  offering  to  fast-track \nprojects. However, it made little progress as only a handful of projects reached financial close, \nand the reforms did not address the SEBs\u2019 underlying fundamental weaknesses. \n \n15. \nTo address state and national difficulties, the Government initiated a reform program in \nthe mid-1990s based on recommendations of a high-profile government commission on power \nsector \nincluding \n(i) \ncommercialization and unbundling of generation, transmission, and distribution; (ii) regional and \nnational  reforms  to  strengthen  the  role  of  central  public  sector  utilities;  (iii)  large-scale \ninvolvement  of  the  private  sector  in  generation  and  distribution,  through  transparent  and \ncompetitive  selection  processes;  (iv)  creation  of  a  central  regulator  to  regulate  bulk  tariffs  and \nstate  regulators  for  small  generation  and  end-user  tariffs,  thus  depoliticizing  electricity  tariff \nsetting; and (v) a progressive phase-out of subsidies to agricultural consumers and increases in \ntariffs to more accurately reflect the cost of supply. While the suggested reforms emanated from \nthe  central  Government,  states  were  given  flexibility  to  choose  their  own  reform  path;  this \nproduced  very  mixed  results.7  The  lack  of  competitive  standards  in  the  power  sector,  an \nemphasis  on  privatization  for  its  own  sake  rather  than  for  effecting  improvements  in  quality  of \nsupply  and  consumer  satisfaction,  the  seeking  of  higher  returns  on  investment  without \ncorresponding improvements in supply, and improper sequencing undermined the gains made \nin  nonpolitical  and  transparent  tariff  setting  and  private  sector  participation  in  the  sector.  The \nwell-publicized reform failures in certain states stalled any progress or political will in the others.  \n \n16. \nA much stronger central government role was required to accelerate the reform process. \nIn 1998, the Government enacted the Electricity Regulatory Commission Act, which led to the \nestablishment  of  the  Central  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission,  an  independent  central \nregulator,  and  state  equivalents  (state  electricity  regulatory  commissions).  In  2003,  the  more \ncomprehensive  Electricity  Act  was  promulgated,  which  consolidated  existing  legislation  for  the \npower sector under a single act and includes provisions to improve competition and efficient use \nof resources. It includes initiatives to (i) promote unbundling of the power sector; (ii) delicense \nthermal power generation; (iii) liberalize the captive power policy; (iv) open access to distribution \nnetworks allowing direct sale of power to bulk consumers; (v) open access to transmission lines \nto  facilitate  power  trading  and  improve  performance  of  the  transmission  system;  (vi)  require \nmandatory  metering  and  stringent  provisions  against  power  theft  to  remove  the  causes  of  the \nSEB  problems;  (vii)  upgrade  the  central  and  state  regulatory  infrastructure;  and  (viii)  improve \n\n                                                 \n7   The  failures  of  the  unbundling  and  privatization-driven  efforts  in  Orissa  were  well  publicized.  However,  the \nexperience  in  Gujarat  and  Madhya  Pradesh,  which  focused  on  restructuring  through  corporatization,  was  more \npositive.  The  reform  efforts  in  the  national  capital  region  of  Delhi  provided  some  positive  results  by  introducing \nprivate distribution licensees. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\ncoordination between the central and state governments in planning and developing the power \nsector.  The  Government  formulated  a  national  tariff  policy  and  national  electricity  policy  in \nconsultation  with  the  Central  Electricity  Authority,  Central  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission, \nand the state governments. These recent legislative changes, new financial penalties to enforce \ngrid discipline by the SEBs, and the settlement of past dues curtailed the financial problems of \nthe SEBs, which had infected the sector as a whole.  \n \nC. \n\nAsian Development Bank Operations \n\n1. \n\nCountry Strategy \n\n17.  Mainstreaming  poverty  reduction  is  the  central  organizing  theme  of  ADB\u2019s  country \nstrategy  and  program  (CSP)  for  India.8  The  CSP  draws  on  the  three  pillars  of  ADB\u2019s  poverty \nreduction  strategy:  pro-poor  growth,  social  development,  and  good  governance.  The  strategy \naims  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  high-growth  agenda  by  helping  with  fiscal  consolidation, \ninfrastructure  development,  and  private  sector  development.  Political  and  economic \ndevelopments  since  finalizing  the  CSP  indicate  that  the  strategy  remains  valid,  especially  the \ncore  strategy  of  poverty  reduction  through  infrastructure-led  growth  supported  by  social \ndevelopment and good governance. The 2006\u20132008 CSP9 update suggests that the objective of \naccelerating  India\u2019s  annual  gross  domestic  product  growth  to  8%  depends  on  upgrading \ninfrastructure  facilities  and  improving  the  efficiency  of  such  public  services.  ADB\u2019s  proposed \nassistance  program  reflects  this  priority,  with  infrastructure  accounting  for  nearly  77%  of  the  \n3-year pipeline (not including private sector and nonsovereign operations). \n \n\n2. \n\nSector Strategies \n\nThe  operating  priorities  of  ADB\u2019s  energy  sector  strategy10  are  (i)  reduce  poverty  by, \n18. \namong  others,  creating  energy  infrastructure  for  sustainable  economic  growth;  (ii) promote \nprivate  sector  involvement  by  restructuring  the  energy  sector  and  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment for private investors; (iii) address regional and global environmental impacts; and \n(iv)  promote  regional  cooperation.  In  particular,  the  strategy  strongly  encourages  ADB \ninterventions  to  increase  private  sector  participation  in  the energy  sector  to  take  advantage  of \nthe higher operating efficiencies that private operators can achieve and to meet the large capital \nrequirements. The strategy promotes a shift to cleaner fuels and processes. \n \n19. \nADB\u2019s assistance for the power sector, as outlined in the 2006\u20132008 CSP update, has \nsix  main  priorities:  (i)  reform  the  sector;  (ii)  promote  higher  efficiency  and  low-carbon  power \nsources  that  are  locally  available;  (iii)  expand  and  optimize  transmission  and  distribution \nsystems; (iv) support institutional strengthening to implement reforms required by the Electricity \nAct  of  2003,  including  development  of  more  flexible  power  delivery  and  trading  systems;  \n(v)  promote  private  sector  participation;  and  (vi)  encourage  energy  conservation,  and  ensure \nenvironmental  and  social  sustainability.  To  support  the  Government\u2019s  Power  for  All  by  2012 \ninitiative, ADB\u2019s power sector strategy for create synergy with the 11th Five-Year Plan. \n \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB.  2003.

ADB  successfully  implemented  a  power  sector  reform  program  in  the  state  of  Gujarat; \nthe Gujarat power sector is one of the few state power sectors that recently recorded a surplus. \nThe Gujarat Power Sector Development Program11 facilitated restructuring of the power sector, \nreduced the need for transfers from the state government budget, allowed expansion of power \nsupplies  using  private  generating  capacity,  and  optimized  the  end  use  of  electricity.  The  ADB \nassistance  comprised  a  program  loan  of  $150  million,  which  emphasized  the  creation  of \nstructures for good governance and regulation of the sector, especially the independence of the \nregulator  from  the  Government;  and  a  project  loan  of  $200  million,  which  supported  four \nsubprojects for transmission lines, substations, and distribution systems to improve evacuation \nof  power  from  independent  power  producers,  strengthen  the  power  distribution  system  to \nimprove  reliability  and  reduce  systems  losses,  and  conserve  electricity  and  water  through \nconversion of irrigation systems. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Description \n\nThe  Project  is  to  construct,  operate,  and  maintain  a  4,000  MW  coal-fired  power  plant \n21. \nwith five units of 800 MW each, incorporating supercritical technology near Tundawanda village, \nMundra  Taluka  in  Kutch  district,  in  the  state  of  Gujarat.  In  addition,  CGPL  is  to  make \narrangements  to  bring  imported  coal  to  the  project  site.  This  includes  development  of  a  jetty, \nunloading and handling of imported coal, and transport to the site. Infrastructure for processing \nseawater to meet in-plant water requirements, including intake and discharge to the sea, water \nintake pipeline, and a desalination plant, will need to be built. \n \nB. \n\nManagement and Ownership \n\nCGPL,  established  under  the  Companies  Act  of  1956,  is  implementing  the  Project. \n\n22. \nCGPL's sponsor, TPC, owns 100% of CGPL shares. \n \n23. \nCGPL's  board  of  directors  has  four  members:  the  TPC  managing  director,  two  TPC \nexecutive  directors,  and  the  managing  director  of  the  Tata  Power  Trading  Company  Limited. \nThe CGPL project director, under the supervision and control of the board of directors, handles \nday-to-day management of CGPL, supported by a team of senior management with energy and \nprivate sector backgrounds. \n \nTPC is a part of the Tata Group,12 comprising 96 companies in seven business sectors: \n24. \nengineering,  materials,  energy,  chemicals,  services,  consumer  products,  and  information \nsystems and communications. TPC is promoted by  Tata Sons Limited, which was established \nas  a  trading  enterprise  by  the  founder  of  the  Tata  Group,  Jamsetji  Tata,  in  1868.  Tata  Sons \nLimited is the promoter of all key companies of the Tata Group, and holds the bulk of the shares \nin these companies. The chair of Tata Sons Limited traditionally has been the chair of the Tata \nGroup. Tata Sons Limited is the owner of the Tata brand name and the Tata trademark, which \nare registered in India and several other countries. Philanthropic trusts endowed by members of \nthe Tata family hold about 66% of the equity capital of Tata Sons Limited. \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB.  2000.

Established in 1919, TPC took its \ncurrent  form  in  2000  through  a  merger  with  two  other  group  companies:  Tata  Hydro-Electric \nPower  Supply  Company  (established  in  1910)  and  Andhra  Valley  Power  Supply  Company \n(established  in  1916).  TPC  has  supplied  power  to  the  southern  part  of  Mumbai,  India\u2019s \ncommercial hub and capital of Maharashtra state, for more than 80 years. TPC owns, operates, \nand maintains thermal power plants in several Indian states, including Maharashtra, Karnataka, \nand Jharkhand. It also owns 18% of the country\u2019s private sector generating capacity. TPC has a \npresence  in  all  areas  of  the  power  sector:  thermal,  hydroelectric,  wind,  solar,  transmission, \ndistribution,  and  power  trading.  TPC  has  a  track  record  in  managing  and  executing  power \nprojects  in  India  and  other  countries  such  as  Algeria,  Iran,  Kuwait,  Liberia,  Malaysia,  Saudi \nArabia, and United Arab Emirates. \n \nC. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nConstruction \n\n26. \nCGPL  will  construct  the  Project  through  various  packages.  A  boiler  package  and  a \nturbine  generator  package  represent  approximately  50%  of  the  total  project  cost.  The  boiler \npackage  will  be  procured  from  Doosan  Heavy  Industries  &  Construction  Company  Limited \n(Doosan)  of  the  Republic  of  Korea,  and  the  turbine  generator  package  from  Toshiba \nCorporation  (Toshiba)  of  Japan.  Doosan  Projects  Limited,  an  Indian  incorporated  company \nwholly  owned  by  Doosan,  is  expected  to  provide  onshore  supplies  and  services.  TCE \nConsulting  Engineers  Limited  (TCE)  from  India  will  assist  in  preparing  detailed  specifications \nand  provide  engineering  and  design  support.  Korea  Power  Engineering  Company,  Inc.,  a \nsubsidiary of Korea Electric Power Company Limited, the largest power utility in the Republic of \nKorea, will review and reinforce TCE\u2019s work. \n \n27. \nDoosan,  established  in  1962,  has  become  one  of  the  world's  major  engineering, \nprocurement,  and  construction  contractors;  and  is  one  of  the  few  companies  in  the  world  with \nthe  capability  to  design  and  manufacture  supercritical  boilers.  Doosan\u2019s  business  structure  is \norganized by business groups for power generation, desalination plants, nuclear power plants, \ncasting  and  forging,  and  construction.  Its  power  generation  business  group  is  active  in  fields \nrelated to fossil fuel power generation, which includes boilers, heat recovery steam generators, \nturbine  and  generator  equipment,  and  industrial  support  facilities  such  as  material  handling \nequipment  and  environmental  systems.  Doosan  has  built  more  than  300  nuclear,  thermal, \ncombined cycle, and hydropower plants. It is currently building more than 60 power plants in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), India, Republic of Korea, United States, and others. Doosan \nrecently provided 660 MW supercritical boilers to National Thermal Power Corporation of India, \nand  manufactured  800  MW  supercritical  boilers  for  Younghung  Thermal  Power  Plant  in  the \nRepublic of Korea. \n \n28. \nToshiba started its business from a telegraph equipment factory in Tokyo in 1875, and is \nnow  a  leading  manufacturer  of  heavy  electrical  apparatus  with  a  worldwide  sales  and  service \nnetwork.  It  has  four  major  business  areas:  digital  products,  electric  devises  and  components, \nsocial  infrastructure  systems,  and  home  appliances  and  others.  Toshiba  has  delivered \napproximately  1,700  steam  turbine  units,  240  hydraulic  turbine  units,  300  hydraulic  generator \nunits, and 32 nuclear reactor units to customers throughout the world. It provides a vast range of \nturbine products, from several megawatt back-pressure turbines to over 1,000 MW supercritical \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\nturbines.  In  February  1997,  Toshiba  reached  the  rare  milestone  of  having  produced  turbine \nproducts with aggregate generating capacity of more than 100 gigawatts. \n \n29. \nProject construction will be managed with particular attention to coordination among the \nvarious  contractors.  An  advisory  council,  be  formed  by  industry  experts,  will  assist  with  CGPL \nmanagement,  with  support  of  Korea  Power  Engineering  Company,  Inc.  The  entire  scope  will \nhandled  by  three  project  managers:  (i)  common  facilities  and  unit  1,  (ii)  units  2  and  3,  and  \n(iii) units 4 and 5. Each project manager will cover engineering, procurement, and construction \nwith support from, and coordination among, TCE, TPC's engineering and planning division, and \nthe contractors. \n \n30. \nThe Project is expected to be completed unit by unit. Commissioning of the first unit is \nexpected by March 2011 and of the remaining units at regular 4-month intervals. The Project is \nexpected to achieve full commercial operation by July 2012. \n \n\n2. \n\nCoal Supply \n\n31. \nUp to 11.7 million tons (t) of coal will be required per annum. The Government designed \nthe  Project  with  imported  coal,  and  CGPL  will  source  coal  through  long-term  fuel  supply \nagreements  with  exporters  of  coal  in  Indonesia,  South  Africa,  Mozambique,  and/or  Australia, \ntaking advantage of TPC's global coal procurement network. Despite the existing large domestic \ncoal reserve, availability of domestic coal is not able to keep pace with the growing demand for \ncoal for thermal generation. Under this circumstance, it is more economical to use imported coal \nfor  power  plants  on  coastal  locations,  especially  for  those  far  away  from  the  domestic  coal \nmines.  The  main  domestic  coal  reserves  are  in  the  eastern  region  of  the  country,  and  coal \ntransport capacity is constrained. From the environmental perspective, the Government requires \nbeneficiation  before  transporting  high  ash  content  coal  over  long  distances.13  Hence,  the \nProject,  being  set  up  on  a  coastal  location,  has  been  designated  to  use  imported  coal.  The \ndesign of boilers would be dependent on the type of coal, and once designed for imported coal it \nis  difficult  to  switch  to  domestic  coal  which  has  high  ash  content  and  lower  calorific  value.  In \nterms of the choice of imported coal, it is important to procure quality coal with higher calorific \nvalue, lower ash, and lower sulfur. Lower ash content improves the overall plant availability due \nto lower maintenance requirements. Also, with higher calorific value, the Project would require \nless  quantity  of  coal  to  generate  the  same  level  of  output.  To  achieve  higher  environmental \nstandards, procurement of imported coal with lower ash and sulfur contents is essential. \n \n\n3. \n\nCoal Transport \n\n32. \nCGPL  will  enter  into  a  long-term  time  charter  arrangement  with  bulk  carriers  for  coal \ntransport  utilizing  TPC's  global  fuel procurement  network  and  capacity.  TPC  plans to  set  up  a \nsubsidiary to own vessels, and CGPL will enter into a time charter agreement with TPC's coal \nshipping subsidiary and/or directly with other shipping companies. \n \n\n4. \n\nPort Services \n\n33. \nCoal will be unloaded at Mundra Port. The concessionaire for the port, Mundra Port and \nSpecial  Economic  Zone  Limited  (MPSEZL),  will  provide  port  facilities  as  per  the  port  service \nagreement between CGPL and MPSEZL. MPSEZL will make the terminal available and operate \nit  to  enable  the  minimum  guaranteed  tonnage  to  be  unloaded  and  handled  at  the  terminal. \n\n                                                 \n13 Power plants located beyond 1,000 km from pit head cannot use coal containing more than 34% ash. \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nMPSEZL will ensure storage of at least 0.6 million t in the coal stack yard if required by CGPL. It \nwill  give  berthing  priority  to  CGPL's  coal  transport  vessels,  and  make  all  arrangements  for \nberthing of coal transport vessels. CGPL can also use the facilities at Mundra Port for unloading \nplant and equipment required for project construction. \n \n34. \nTransport  of  the  coal  from  Mundra  Port  to  the  project  site  will  be  through  a  dedicated \ncoal  transport  system.  MPSEZL  has  agreed  to  provide  the  right-of-way  for  the  corridor  for  the \nsystem, road access, and the seawater intake and discharge channel for the Project. \n \n\n5. \n\nPower Offtake \n\n35. \nPower  generated  by  the  Project  will  be  sold  to  distribution  licensees  of  the  states  of \nGujarat (excluding Ahmedabad and Surat Electricity Company), Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana, \nand Rajasthan (Table 4). The seven offtakers that have signed power purchase agreements are \nGujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited, Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited, \nPunjab State Electricity Board (PSEB), Haryana Power Generation Corporation Limited, and the \nthree distribution companies from Rajasthan, Ajmer Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Limited, Jaipur Vidyut \nVitaran Nigam Limited, and Jodhpur Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Limited. \n \n\nTable 4: Allocation of Contracted Capacity for the Project \n\nState \n\nContracted Capacity \n(MW) \n1,805 \n760 \n475 \n380 \n380 \n\nGujarat \nMaharashtra \nPunjab \nHaryana \nRajasthan \nMW = megawatt. \nSource: Coastal Gujarat Power Limited. \n \n\nPercentage \n(%) \n47.5 \n20.0 \n12.5 \n10.0 \n10.0 \n\n36. \nThe  performance  of  the  state  power  subsector  is  determined  by  a  number  of  factors, \nincluding (i) share of agricultural consumers in total electricity sales (as they receive subsidized \nelectricity),  (ii)  transmission  and  distribution  losses,  (iii)  aggregate  technical  and  commercial \n(ATC) losses in distribution, (iv) gap between average cost of supply and average revenue, and \n(v)  collection  efficiency.  Table  5  provides  a  summary  of  recent  changes  in  the  composition  of \nconsumers  and  transmission  and  distribution  losses  for  the  five  states.  In  most  states, \ntransmission  and  distribution  losses  have  declined  but  the  change  in  customer  profile  is \ninsignificant.  The  gap  in  the  average  cost  of  supply  and  revenues  is  greatest  for  agriculture; \ntherefore, the sales to this sector are an important determinant of required subsidy support. \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\n \n\nTable 5: Electricity Consumer Profile and Transmission and Distribution Losses \n(%) \n\nPunjab \nFY \n\nGujarat \nFY \n\nHaryana \nFY \n\nRajasthan \nFY \n\n2007 \n15.5 \n5.9 \n31.3 \n42.9 \n4.4 \n\n2004 \n13.2 \n4.8 \n37.8 \n40.3 \n3.9 \n\n \nConsumer \nCategory \nDomestic \nCommercial \nAgriculture \nIndustry \nOthers \n \nTransmission \nand Distribution \nLosses \nFY = fiscal year. \nSource: Central Electricity Authority. 2007.

The  Gujarat  Electricity  Industry  (Reorganization  and  Regulation)  Act  of  2003 \nrestructured  the  Gujarat  Electricity  Board  into  seven  entities  with  functional  responsibility  for \ntrading,  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution.  Gujarat  Urja  Vikas  Nigam  Limited  owns \n100% of the shares of the other six companies; and is responsible for bulk purchase and sale of \nelectricity,  supervision,  coordination,  and  facilitation  among  the  six  subsidiary  companies. \nDistribution  licensees  in  Gujarat  have  a  positive  cash  flow  (including  subsidy),  and  the  deficit \nbetween average revenue and average cost is declining. However, the cross-subsidies have not \nchanged.  The  substantial  improvement  in  financial  performance  is  mainly  due  to  near  100% \ncollection  efficiency,  reduced  cost  of  supply  because  of  operating  efficiencies,  and  savings  in \ninterest costs because of debt restructuring. \n \n38.  Maharashtra.  The  Maharashtra  State  Electricity  Board  has  been  unbundled  into  four \ncompanies.  In  FY2006,  Maharashtra  State  Electricity  Distribution  Company  Limited  had  a \nnegative  cash  flow  (including  subsidy)  despite  substantial  profit  in  FY2004  and  FY2005.  The \ncross-subsidy  has  been  steadily  declining,  indicating  that  a  higher  proportion  of  the  cost  of \nsupply is being recovered from consumers. Collection efficiency is good, with more than 100% \ncollection efficiency in FY2005, indicating that distribution licensees are recovering current dues \nand a portion of past dues. Generally, financial performance has improved. \n \n39. \nPunjab. Punjab state continues to follow an integrated model whereby all three functions \nof  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  are  handled  by  PSEB.  PSEB  has  reduced  ATC \nlosses considerably and achieved almost 100% cash collection. Its cash flow (including subsidy) \nhas  improved  significantly  with  substantial  profit  in  FY2004  and  FY2005.  During  the  same \nperiod,  PSEB  achieved  a  surplus  between  average  revenue  (including  subsidy)  and  average \ncost. Thus PSEB performance is characterized by cash profit, dependence on subsidy from the \nstate  government  because  of  the  mid-level  cross-subsidy,  high  collection  efficiency,  and \nrelatively low ATC losses. \n \n40. \nHaryana.  The  Haryana  State  Electricity  Board  was  one  of  the  first  SEBs  to  be \nunbundled along functional lines into a generation company, a transmission company, and two \ndistribution companies. Subsequently, the trading function was separated from the transmission \nfunction.  The  generation  company,  Haryana  Power  Generation  Company  Limited,  has  been \nhandling  the  trading  and  bulk  purchase  functions  in  the  state  since  June  2005.  On  14  August \n\n\f \n\n11\n\n1998, the transmission and distribution businesses were transferred to Haryana Vidyut Prasaran \nNigam  Limited.  The  Haryana  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  regulates  transmission  and \ndistribution.  Power  is  wheeled  through  the  entire  network  by  Haryana  Vidyut  Prasaran  Nigam \nLimited on the payment of transmission charges approved by the Haryana Electricity Regulatory \nCommission.  Financial  performance  of  the  distribution  licensees  in  Haryana  are  characterized \nby (i) not very sound cash flow positions, (ii) high dependence on subsidies, (iii) low collection \nefficiencies, and (iv) high ATC losses. Dependence on the state government subsidy is primarily \na result of Haryana having a largely agrarian economy with state-subsidized power provided to \nagricultural  consumers.  As  a  result,  the  negative  gap  between  average  revenue  (without \nsubsidy) and average cost of supply has steadily increased. \n \n41. \nRajasthan. The Rajasthan Power Sector Reforms Act of 1999 was enacted with effect \nfrom  1  June  2000,  and  accordingly  the  SEB  was  unbundled  into  five  functional  entities:  one \ngeneration  company,  one  transmission  company,  and  three  distribution  companies:  Jaipur \nVidyut  Vitran  Nigam  Limited,  Ajmer  Vidyut  Vitran  Nigam  Limited,  and  Jodhpur  Vidyut  Vitran \nNigam Limited. These distribution companies operate and maintain the electricity system below \n66  kilovolts  in  their  respective  areas.  As  per  the  mandate  of  the  2003  Electricity  Act,  power \npurchase  agreements  (PPAs)  and  the  procurement,  bulk  supply,  and  trading  of  power  were \ntransferred to the three distribution companies in February 2004. Financial performance of the \ndistribution licensees in Rajasthan is characterized by negative cash flows, high dependence on \nsubsidies,  high  collection  efficiencies,  high  ATC  losses,  and  a  constant  cross-subsidy. \nDependence  on  the  state  government  subsidy  is  primarily  because  the  state  government \nprovides subsidies to various categories of consumers\u2014mainly domestic and agricultural. \n \n42. \nhave defaulted or delayed payment for power purchased, except for disputed amounts. \n \n\nThe  financial  profile  of  the  Project's  offtakers  is  thus  diverse  (Table  6).

Tariffs  will  be  payable  on  a \n\n \n43. \ntake-or-pay basis, in accordance with the tariff bid submitted by TPC.  \n \n44. \nThe tariff will comprise a capacity charge and an energy charge. The full capacity charge \nwill be paid based on the contracted capacity at normative availability of 85%. An incentive will \nbe provided for availability beyond 85%, but a penalty will be charged if availability is lower than \n85%.  The  capacity  charge  and  energy  charge  will  have  components  subject  to  escalation \nfactors. Application of the escalation factors are summarized in Table 7. \n\n \n\n\f 12 \n\n \n\nTable 7: Applicability of Escalation Factor \n\nItem \n\n \n\nAdjustment for \n\n \n\nCapacity Charge \n  Component with escalation  factor \n  Component with no escalation factor \n \nEnergy Charge \n  Component with escalation factor  \n  Fuel energy charge \n \n  Transportation energy charge \n \nFuel-handling energy charge \n \n \n  Component with no escalation factor \n \n \n \n\n  Fuel energy charge \n  Transportation energy charge \n  Fuel-handling energy charge \nFOREX = foreign exchange fluctuation (Rs/$). \nSource: Coastal Gujarat Power Limited. \n\nInflation \n \nYes \nNo \n \n \n \nYes \nYes \nYes \n \nNo \nNo \nNo \n\nFOREX \n \nNo \nNo \n \n \n \nYes \nYes \nNo \n \nYes \nYes \nNo \n\n \n45. \nThe  payment  by  each  offtaker  will  be  supported  by  an  unconditional,  irrevocable,  and \nrevolving  letter  of  credit;  and  a  default  escrow  account.  If  an  offtaker  defaults,  CGPL  has  the \noption first to sell the power to the other offtakers and second to third parties. The liability of the \ndefaulting offtaker to make capacity charge payments to CGPL will remain unaffected for up to  \n3 years of capacity charges (to the extent not paid by another offtaker). If the total offtake is less \nthan  the  minimum  guaranteed  offtake  of  65%,  and  CGPL  has  paid  the  penalty  for  not \npurchasing  the  minimum  quantity  of  fuel,  CGPL  is  entitled  to  receive  compensation  for  such \npenalty from the offtakers that didn\u2019t meet the guaranteed minimum offtake. \n \n \n46. \nThe  offtakers  are  responsible  for  procuring  the  transmission  facilities  beyond  the \nProject's  400  kilovolt  switchyard  bus  bar  under  the  PPA.  Power  from  the  Project  will  be \nevacuated by a dedicated transmission line to connect the Project with the grid system operated \nby Power Grid Corporation of India Limited. \n \n\n6. \n\nOperation and Maintenance \n\nCGPL\u2019s  in-house  engineers  will  be  responsible  for  project  operation  and  maintenance \n47. \nwith  support  from  TPC.  The  key  personnel  of  the  operation  and  maintenance  team  will  be \ndeputed  from  TPC  and  its  affiliates,  and  have  expertise  in  thermal  power  engineering.  Other \noperations personnel, with strong expertise and experience, will be recruited from outside. \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n\n48. \nADB classifies the Project as environment category A, involuntary resettlement category \nB,  and  indigenous  peoples  category  C.  The  assessment  of  the  Project\u2019s  environmental  and \nsocial  impacts  was  conducted  through  the  following  six  separate  but  related  studies:  (i)  rapid \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  conducted  by  TCE  from  March  to  May  2006,  \n(ii) comprehensive EIA conducted by TCE from March 2006 to August 2007, (iii) socioeconomic \nassessment  report  conducted  by  TCE  from  March  to  August  2006,  (iv)  rapid  marine  impact \nassessment  conducted  by  the  National  Institute  of  Oceanography  from  January  2006  to  April \n2007 and supplementary information provided in October 2007, (v) supplementary investigation \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nof  the  cumulative  impacts  on  ambient  air  quality  of  the  Project  and  the  neighboring  660  MW \npower  plant  prepared  by  TPC  from  late  October  to  early  November  2007  in  consultation  with \nVishudda Envirotech of India, and (vi) baseline social impact assessment conducted by Saline \nArea Vitalization Enterprise Limited of India in November 2007. \n \n49. \nDuring the environmental and social assessment, the Government initiated a number of \nmeetings with the local community in 2005. A public hearing on the findings of the rapid EIA was \nheld on 19 September 2006. The hearing was conducted by the district collector in the presence \nof  officials  from  Gujarat  Pollution  Control  Board  and  CGPL,  and  representatives  of  affected \ncommunities.  After  CGPL  was  transferred  to  TPC  in  April  2007,  further  consultations  were \nconducted  in  Bhuj  and  project-affected  villages.  These  meetings  were  attended  by  affected \npeople  and  village  sarpanches  (village  council  heads),  public  representatives  in  district \npanchayat  (village  council),  and  local  leaders.  The  Project  received  environmental  clearance \nfrom the Ministry of Environment and Forests on 25 April 2007 based on the rapid EIA. All other \nclearances  and  permits  required  for  various  operations  from  the  national  and  state  authorities \nhave  been  obtained,  except  one  from  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forests,  which  is \nexpected soon to reclassify the forestland in the site. \n \n50. \nADB reviewed the six studies related to environmental and social impacts of the Project \nand  an  environmental  and  social  safeguard  due  diligence  mission  was  fielded  during \n29 October\u20131  November  2007.  The  summary  EIA  was  circulated  to  the  Board  and  posted  on \nthe ADB website on 4 December 2007. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is \npresented in Appendix 2. \n \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment \n\n51. \nThe  EIA  prepared  for  the  Project  meets  the  requirements  of  ADB's  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines (2003). It describes the environmental baseline conditions in the project \narea,  and  records  the  results  of  a  comprehensive  examination  of  the  potential  impacts  of  the \nProject on the surrounding natural and socioeconomic environment. The project area is located \non  marginal  and  barren  land  that  is  not  ecologically  or  culturally  sensitive.  Important  issues \nconsidered in the EIA include gaseous emissions and the discharge of a large volume of spent \ncooling water. The EIA confirms that (i) the emissions will meet national standards in India as \nwell  as  the  World  Bank\u2019s  emission  guidelines  for  new  power  plants,  and  (ii)  the  ambient  air \nquality will not exceed these standards even if emissions from all planned future power plants in \nthe vicinity are considered. The EIA also confirms that the discharge of spent cooling water will \nnot  have  significant  impacts  on  the  marine  environment,  or  cause  coastal  erosion  and \ndeposition.  Public  stakeholder  consultations  were  held  and  views  expressed  by  the  project-\naffected people are incorporated in the final EIA. \n \nA core part of the EIA is an environmental management plan, including an environmental \n52. \nmonitoring and evaluation program covering both emissions and ambient environmental quality \nparameters.  The  plan  is  to  effectively  address  potential  environmental  issues  during  project \nconstruction  and  operation.  Appropriate  clauses  will  be  included  in  construction  contracts  to \nrequire  contractors  to  implement  the  environmental  management  plan  to  minimize  transient \nenvironmental disturbances. The contractors will also be required to provide appropriate training \nto  their  workers  in  environment,  safety,  and  health  aspects  of  construction;  and  to  provide \nprotective measures for workers to minimize safety risks. \n \n53. \nThe Project will establish an organization to manage environmental, occupational health, \nand  safety  aspects  during  construction  and  commercial  operation  of  the  power  plant.  All \n\n \n\n\f 14 \n\npersonnel  will  receive  training  in  occupational  health  and  safety  practices.  Safety  drills  will  be \ncarried out periodically. Safety manuals or handbooks will be prepared as required. \n \n\n2. \n\nSocial Safeguards \n\n54. \nInvoluntary Resettlement. The Project originally required acquisition of 1,254 hectares \n(ha) of land, including approximately 241 ha for ash disposal, 182 ha for the colony, and 100 ha \nfor right-of-way for the coal transport system from Mundra Port. Project land is located within the \nvillage  boundaries  of  Tunda  and  Mota  Kandagara  villages  in  Mundra  Taluka  (town)  and  Nana \nBhadiya  village  in  Mandavi  Taluka.  The  location  and  impacts  on  land  use  were  major \nconsiderations  for  selecting  the  site  in  Mundra  Taluka.  After  careful  review,  the  land  for \nacquisition  was  reduced  to  1,052  ha  and  only  a  202  ha  right-of-way  is  required  for  the  coal \ntransport  system  and  inlet  and  discharge  channels.  Potential  involuntary  resettlement  impacts \nwere  minimized  by  selecting  a  site  that  is  uninhabited,  of  low  and  unreliable  productivity,  and \nrequires minimal private land acquisition. The Project is categorized as B from the perspective \nof involuntary resettlement since the following impacts are expected: (i) loss of agricultural land \nowned by 76 families, (ii) loss of temporary structures (wells, cattle sheds), (iii) restricted access \nto produce such as fodder from forest and grazing land, (iv) loss of access to some of the public \nlands  used  for  community  activities  (traditional  mela  [fair],  cricket  grounds)  and  (v)  temporary \nloss  of  access  to  the  coastline.  CGPL  has  acquired  the  land  and  paid  compensation  at \nreplacement  rates  that  are  well  above  recorded  transactions.  Measures  to  mitigate  the \nsocioeconomic impacts arising from land acquisition and restricted access to common property \nresources  have  been  disclosed  to  the  affected  people.  The  summary  resettlement  plan  is \nattached as Appendix 3. \n \n55. \nPower  Grid  Corporation  of  India  Limited  will  construct  the  transmission  lines  and \nMPSEZL  will  develop  the  coal-handling  facilities  in  Mundra  Port.  Thus  far,  no  land  has  been \nacquired  for  the  transmission  lines.  When  acquiring  land  Power  Grid  Corporation  of  India  will \nfollow  its corporate  policy  on  resettlement,  which  ADB  has  accepted  as  consistent  with  ADB's \ninvoluntary resettlement policy requirements. The coal shipment and unloading facilities will be \nconstructed  within  Mundra  Special  Economic  Zone;  hence,  no  additional  land  acquisition  is \nrequired. No issues with previous land acquisition for the economic zone are outstanding. \n \n56. \nIndigenous Peoples. About 3% of the total population of 5,058 in two of three directly \naffected villages (Nana Bhadia and Kandagra Mota) belongs to scheduled tribes. No household \nor group belonging to scheduled tribes will lose housing, strip of land, or other fixed assets. The \neconomic activities of villagers belonging to scheduled tribes may be affected by acquisition of \nGovernment-owned wasteland and grazing lands, but alternative gauchar (grazing) land will be \nprovided.  The  scheduled  tribes  live  together  with  the  mainstream  population,  use  the  same \ncommon property resources, and engage in the same social activities; the Project will not affect \ntheir traditional practices. No impacts other than those identified in the short resettlement plan \nare expected; therefore, the Project is categorized as C from the perspective of ADB's Policy on \nIndigenous Peoples (1998). \n \nE. \n\nDevelopment Impact \n\nImpact, Outcome, and Output \n\n1. \n \nThe  Project  aims  to  promote  sustainable  economic  development  in  India  by  increasing \n57. \nthe  supply  of  cleaner  and  low-cost  electricity.  The  Project  will  build  and  operate  the  largest \npower plant based on state-of-the-art supercritical boiler technology. This will be one of the first \n\n\f \n\n15\n\ninstances  of  the  use  of  this  technology  in  India.  The  Project  will  provide  4,000  MW  of  new \nelectricity capacity that will improve productivity and the quality of life in the five offtaking states. \nThe  Project  will  help  India  increase  the  shift  of  its  electricity  supply  to  a  cleaner  generating \ntechnology  thereby  reducing  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases.  The  Project\u2019s  design  and \nmonitoring framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \n\n2. \n\nDevelopment Effectiveness \n\n \nThe development effectiveness of the Project will be assessed in terms of private sector \n58. \ndevelopment,  business  success,  and  economic  sustainability  as  per  the  guidelines  for \nimplementing  the  good  practice  standards  for  evaluating  private  sector  investment  operations, \nprepared  by  the  Evaluation  Cooperation  Group  of  multilateral  development  banks.  In  terms  of \nprivate sector development impact at the company level, the Project will expand the company's \ncapacity  to  build,  operate,  and  manage  very  large  projects.  For  the  CGPL  and  beyond,  the \npositive  impacts  of  the  Project  include  development  of  workforce  skills,  and  introduction  of  a \nnew efficient technology, while demonstrating its viability for more widespread adoption. During \nthe 4.5 years of construction, CGPL will generate employment for more than 5,000 workers, and \nduring  operations  will  employ  720  workers  directly  and  create  livelihoods  for  many  others \nindirectly.  The  Project  is  expected  to  yield  a  private  sector  development  impact  well  beyond \nCGPL.  It  is  the  first  ultra  mega  power  project  and  will  help  demonstrate  the  feasibility  of  joint \npublic\u2013private  development  of  such  projects.  The  Project  generates  efficient  and  low-cost \npower, setting a competitive benchmark for the industry. It also demonstrates the execution of \ninternational collaboration on commercial financing and technology transfer to the private sector. \nThe  Project  is  financially  sustainable;  it  meets  local  environment  requirements,  and  mitigates \nthe  emission  of  greenhouse  gases  thus  yielding  global  environmental  benefits.  The  Project\u2019s \ndevelopment effectiveness framework is provided in Appendix 1. \n \nF. \n\nEconomic Evaluation \n\n59. \nThe  economic  analysis  for  the  Project  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects  (1997).  The  major  economic  benefit  is  the \nelectricity  generated.  Given  the  shortages  in  meeting  energy  and  peak  demand  in  the  five \nofftaking  states  of  Gujarat,  Maharashtra,  Haryana,  Punjab,  and  Rajasthan,  all  the  electricity \ngenerated by the Project will meet unmet demand; it will not substitute power from any existing \ngeneration capacity. The entire project output is considered incremental. All offtaking states face \npeak and energy shortages that are projected to persist. A greater and more reliable supply of \npower  is  an  important  input  for  economic  growth  and  development.  Other  project  benefits \ninclude (i) adoption of more efficient power-generating technology that reduces coal burned and \nrelated  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases;  (ii)  generation  of  direct  and  indirect  employment \nopportunities; and (iii) induction of supercritical technology to India, as this will be one of the first \nsupercritical plants in the country. The incremental electricity produced is valued at the average \ncost paid by each state for power purchased. This is taken to reflect the willingness to pay for \nthe  incremental  supply  of  electricity  to  that  state.  The  Project  will  likely  generate  certified \nemission reductions; their value is incorporated as they represent the economic benefit of lower \ngreenhouse gas emissions and positive external effects on the global environment. \n \n60. \nThe  base  case  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  is  estimated  at  33.2%.  The \nsensitivity of the EIRR was tested under five adverse scenarios. Under all scenarios the EIRR is \nwell above the social discount rate of 12%. The EIRR is most sensitive to a decline in electricity \nsales  but  is  still  well  above  the  social  discount  rate.  The  results  of  the  economic  analysis \nindicate that the Project is economically viable. \n\n \n\n\f 16 \n\n \n\nA. \n\nLoan \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n\n61. \nThe  proposed  ADB  loan  of  up  to  $450,000,000  (denominated  in  Indian  rupees  and/or \ndollars) will be provided from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources without government guarantee, \nof  which  up  to  $200,000,000  is  syndicated  to  KEXIM  through  a  risk  participation  agreement, \nthereby reducing ADB\u2019s net exposure to CGPL up to $250,000,000.  \n \n62. \nADB will enter into a risk participation agreement with KEXIM, under which KEXIM will \nagree  to  pay  to  ADB  any  unpaid  amount  due  by  CGPL  on  an  event  of  default  under  the \n$200 million  tranche.  ADB  therefore  has  no  credit  exposure  to  CGPL  for  this  tranche,  but \ninstead  will  have  credit  exposure  to  KEXIM  with  respect  to  its  obligations  under  the  risk \nparticipation agreement. \n \nB. \n\nJustification  \n\nThe Project merits ADB support for the following reasons:  \n\n63. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\nThe  Project  is  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  power  sector  strategy,  and  will \ncomplement  ADB\u2019s  efforts  in  assisting  physical  infrastructure  development  for \nsustainable  economic  growth  in  India.  The  Government  is  trying  to  fully  meet \npower demand by 2012 and plans to increase the installed capacity significantly \nduring the 11th Five-Year Plan period. The Project will contribute significantly to \nthe reducing power shortages in the northern and the western regions of India. \n\nThe  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  CSP  for  India,  which  emphasizes \ninfrastructure  development  and  private  sector  participation.  In  particular,  the \nProject is built upon ADB assistance to the power sector reform program in the \nstate of Gujarat and dovetails with various efforts by the public sector operations \nfor India\u2019s power sector reform including dialogue with the Government. \n\nThe  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  energy  sector  strategy,  with  priorities \nincluding  promotion  of  higher  efficiency  energy  sources. \nIntroduction  of \nsupercritical technology that improves thermal efficiency and reduces emissions \nis in line with the strategy. \n\nThe Project would be the first UMPP to be implemented, and its success will be a \nshowcase for large-scale power projects proposed for the country. In particular, \nUMPPs  are  being  designed  and  implemented  under  public\u2013private  partnership \nstructures, where the Government assumes key roles in developing the projects \nbefore they are transferred to private sector sponsors. The Project is expected to \nbe  another  successful  model  case  for  public\u2013private  partnerships  following  on \nfrom ADB's work in Bangladesh. \n\nThe  proposed  ADB  loan  supports  installation  of  supercritical  technology  and \nhelps  improve  India\u2019s  environmental  standards  by  reducing  greenhouse  gas \nemissions.  The  use  of  supercritical  technology  helps  achieve  an  overall  higher \nconversion  efficiency  of  44%  compared  with  prevailing  efficiency  of  34%\u201336%. \nThis  translates  into  annual  coal  savings  of  about  2.6  million  t.  The  Project  is \n\n\f \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\n17\n\nexpected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 28.3 million t of \ncarbon  dioxide  over  its  10-year  crediting  period  under  the  Clean  Development \nMechanism  of  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change. \nThe Project could also benefit from ADB\u2019s carbon market initiative. \n\nConsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  mandate  to  mobilize  financing  from  other  sources,  the \nproposed  loan  will  catalyze  financing  from  KEXIM  through  a  risk  participation \narrangement with ADB. The Project will be the first to be financed by KEXIM on a \nproject  finance  basis  in  the  Indian  power  sector.  KEXIM\u2019s  principle  reason  for \nentering  into  the  proposed  risk  participation  structure  with  ADB  is  the  risk \nmitigation  from  ADB  that  this  structure  provides,  and  without  the  proposed  risk \nparticipation  arrangement  with  ADB,  KEXIM  may  reconsider  its  participation  in \nthe  Project.  The  proposed  structure  is  critical  to  catalyze  KEXIM\u2019s  competitive \nfinancing for the Project. \n\nIf relevant approvals for ADB's rupee financing can be obtained, ADB will provide \nthe proposed loan in rupees with a fixed interest rate, thereby mitigating the risk \nof currency mismatch between borrowings and revenue, in addition to mitigating \nthe risk of interest rate increases. This will improve the certainty of the Project's \ncash  flow  projections.  Obtaining  funding  with  these  features  from  other  sources \nwould  be  difficult  in  the  current  market.  In  addition,  a  risk  participation \narrangement  will  catalyze  the  risk-taking  capacity  of  another  financier  who \notherwise would not have the capacity to provide rupee financing to the Project. \n\nAnticorruption and Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n\n64. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  and  Combating  Money \nLaundering and the Financing of Terrorism Policy (2003) were explained to CGPL. Consistent \nwith  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  will  require \nCGPL to maintain and comply with internal procedures and controls following international best \npractice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money laundering activities or the \nfinancing  of  terrorism;  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such  activities.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \n1.  Based  on  the  country  poverty  assessment,  the  country  partnership  strategy,  and  the  sector  analysis,  describe  how  the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy of the \npartner country. \n \nPower generated by the Project will be connected to the local grid, which will contribute to the Government\u2019s goal of providing \naffordable, universal electric  service by  2012. Increasing power supplies  to local  grids  will bring the benefits of electricity to \nremote communities, including better health care, sanitation, and education; greater income-earning opportunities; and higher \nliving standards. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \nKey  Issues.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  supporting  economic  development  of  Gujarat  and  its \nneighboring states by providing critically needed power to support economic activities. The Project will generate employment \nand corporate income tax throughout the project life. Increased economical and efficient baseload generation capacity in the \nregion will enable the Government to achieve its stated policy of Power for All by 2012. A positive, direct impact on local labor \nis expected during implementation and an indirect impact will be due to the increased income-earning opportunities generated \nby increased access to electricity. \n \nDesign Features. The Project is establishing a 4,000 MW Ultra Mega Supercritical Thermal Power Project in Tunda Village, \nMundra Taluka, Kutch District, Gujarat State in western India. The project developer will implement livelihood and community \ndevelopment programs as part of their corporate social responsibility initiative. \n\nC.    Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending: Not applicable. \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nFindings of Social Analysis  \n \nKey Issues. Acquisition of public and private land for the Project will affect livelihood patterns of people living in villages close \nto  the  project  site.  In  addition  to  permanent  private  land  losses,  access  to  produce  like  fodder  and  fuelwood  from  common \nproperty resources for economic and domestic use will be affected. Activities during the 4\u20135 years of construction will result in \nmovement of construction materials, equipment, and temporary in-migration of labor force, dust, and noise pollution; and may \ncontribute  to  pressure  on  water  resources,  sanitation,  and  solid  waste  management  systems.  The  Project  is  expected  to \ngenerate livelihood and employment opportunities during plant construction and operation. The project developer has adopted \nmeasures to address community concerns about compensation packages for land acquisition, replacement of grazing land, \nand apprehension about environmental pollution due to the Project, including redress of grievances. \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nThe Government initiated discussions with the local community in 2005; the project developer is continuing this process. The \nfirst  formal  consultation  took  place  in  September  2006  as  a  public  hearing  on  the  findings  of  the  environmental  impact \nassessment  of  the  Project.  The  meeting  discussed  the  Project,  its  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts,  land \nacquisition,  mitigation  measures,  and  monitoring  programs.  All  other  concerns  raised  at  the  meeting  were  clarified  and \nrecorded  in  minutes.  Further  public  consultations  were  conducted  in  villages  as  part  of  preparation  of  the  comprehensive \nenvironmental  impact  assessment,  land  acquisition  process,  and  social  impact  assessment  that  form  the  basis  for  the \nlivelihood restoration program.  \n \n2.

Coastal Gujarat Power Limited (CGPL) will set up the plant in Tunda Village, Mundra \nTaluka,1 Kutch District, Gujarat State in western India. The power generated will be allocated to \nthe states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan. Power Grid Corporation of \nIndia Limited will develop, operate, and maintain the electrical power flow transmission system, \nwhich  will  augment  the  existing  transmission  network  in  Gujarat  and  other  states.  The  site  is \nwell connected with state highways no. 50 (Anjar) and 6 (Gandhidham), the proposed national \nhighway 8A (Delhi\u2013Kandla), the railway station in Adipur, and Mundra Port. \n \nThis  resettlement  plan  to  mitigate  adverse  social  and  economic  impacts  from  land \n2. \nacquisition and/or restrictions on affected persons2 use of land, and to establish and maintain an \nongoing relationship with those affected throughout the life of the Project. \n \nA. \n \n\nScope of Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement Impacts \n\n1. \n\nLand Requirements for the Project \n\n \nThe  Project  originally  planned  to  acquire  1,254  hectares  (ha),  including  land  for  ash \n3. \ndisposal,  residential  complex,  and  the  coal  transport  system.  At  present,  the  land  acquisition \nrequirements are 1,052 ha (Table A5.1). Project lands are located within the village boundaries \nof  Tunda  and  Mota  Kandagara  villages  in  Mundra  Taluka,  and  Nana  Bhadiya  in  Mandavi \nTaluka. Except for 181 ha of private land in Tunda, the Project will utilize Government land in \nTunda, Mota Kandagara, and Nana Bhadiya.  \n \n\n2. \n\nLand Requirements for Associated Facilities \n\n \n4. \nTransmission  Lines.  The  net  power  produced  by  the  power  plant  will  be  transmitted \nfrom the power plant\u2019s switchyard to Limbdi (300 kilometers [km]), Ranchodpur (390 km), and \nJetpur  (330  km)  substations.  Power  Grid  Corporation  of  India  will  be  responsible  for  acquiring \nownership  rights;  rights-of-way,  easements;  and  continued  access  rights  necessary  for  the \nconstruction,  operation,  maintenance,  and  upgrading  of  the  new  transmission  facilities.  Power \nGrid Corporation of India\u2019s environmental and social policy and procedures are consistent with \nthe Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n \n5. \nCoal Shipment and Unloading Facilities. Existing facilities at Mundra Port can handle \nonly  about  4  million  tons  per  annum  of  coal.  Therefore,  Mundra  Port  and  Special  Economic \nZone Limited, the port owner, will construct a new berth and install mechanized coal-unloading \nfacilities  and  a  mechanized  coal-stacking  and  reclaiming  system  within  the  port\u2019s  special \neconomic  zone  to  meet  the  coal  import  requirements  of  the  Project  and  others.  No  additional \nland acquisition is required for these facilities. \n \n                                                 \n1  Taluka or tehsil is a unit of local government that covers several villages. \n2  Affected  person  includes  any  people,  households,  firms,  or  private  institutions  who,  on  account  of  changes  that \nresult from the Project will have their (i) standard of living adversely affected; (ii) right, title, or interest in any house, \nland  (including  residential,  commercial,  agricultural,  forest,  and/or  grazing  land),  water  resources,  or  any  other \nmoveable  or  fixed  assets  acquired,  possessed,  restricted,  or  otherwise  adversely  affected,  in  full  or  in  part, \npermanently,  or  temporarily;  and/or  (iii)  business,  occupation,  place  of  work  or  residence,  or  habitat  adversely \naffected, with or without displacement. \n\n\fTable A5.1: Land Required and Ownership Status \n\nAppendix 3      25 \n\nArea (ha) \n\nOwnership/Type of Land \n\n88 \n12 \n\nGovernment wasteland \nGovernment grazing land \n\n218  MSEZ land to be notified and \n\n181 \n130 \n629 \n241 \n182 \n423 \n1,052 \n100 \n\nallocated to the Project. \nPrivate land (owned by 76 families) \nGovernment forestland  \n \nGovernment wasteland  \nGovernment wasteland \n \n \nGovernment forestland and private \nland (right-of-way) \n\n102  MSEZ (right-of-way) \n\n1,254 \n\n \n\nLocation \nTunda and Kandagara \n\nPlant Facility \nA.

CGPL  and  Power  Finance  Corporation  initiated  land  acquisition  in  June \n2006 after finalization of the project site. Following their application, the district collector issued \nnotifications  under  section  43  of  the  Land  Acquisition  Act  of  1894  (amended  in  1984)  on  \n20  September  2007  and  for  section  64  on  13  April  2007.  Notices  were  placed  in  the \nmamlatdar's5  office  at  Bhuj,  and  village  panchayat6  offices.  After  section  6  notification,  CGPL, \nnow  owned  by  TPC,  began  the  process  of  acquiring  land  through  consent  negotiation  by \noffering  compensation  at  rates  higher  than  prevailing  market  rates  and  other  incentives  or \nbenefits  to  those  affected.  CGPL  organized  small  and  large  public  meetings  at  Bhuj  (five \nmeetings)  and  project-affected  villages  (three  meetings).  The  meetings  were  attended  by \nsarpanches (village council heads), those affected, public representatives in district panchayats \nand local leaders. As a result of these meetings, compensation was fixed at Rs1.5 million per ha \nfor  private  landowners.  This  rate  is  higher  than  land  acquisition  rate  fixed  by  the  Government \nRs250,000  per  ha.7  Compensation  payments  to  all  76 private  landowners  are  expected  to  be \ncompleted by the end of March 2008. \n \n7. \nGovernment  Wasteland  and  Gauchar  Land.  The  project  site  requires  acquisition  of \nGovernment  wasteland  and  gauchar  (grazing)  land.  Land  transfer  orders  for  wasteland  and \ngrazing land were issued by the Kutch district collector in April and May 2007, respectively. Prior \nto the Project, part of Tunda village wasteland was allocated to the Mundra Special Economic \n\n                                                 \n3  Under  section  4  of  Land  Acquisition  Act,  notification  was  issued  on  20  September  2006  (Ref.  No. \nAM/2006/190/M/LKU/162006/  1551/GH)  and  public  notices  were  issued  in  local  vernacular  daily  Chanchal  and \nEnglish daily Indian Express on 2 October 2006. \n\n4  The public notices for section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act were issued in Chanchal and Indian Express on 13 April \n\n5  A mamlatdar, who has delegated powers of a magistrate, is responsible for maintaining land records and issuing \n\nsuch certifications as domicile, caste, and income. \n\n6  Local village government bodies. \n7  Calculated based on data from the last 5 years of land transactions in the area. \n\n2007. \n\n \n\n\f26     Appendix 3      \n\nZone. Following CGPL's application, the Government decided to transfer the allotment for zone \nto CGPL in November 2007.  \n \n8. \nForestland. The Project requires reserve forestland at Mota Kandagra, Mundra Taluka. \nThe  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forests  approved  the  request  on  29  March  2007  with  the \ncondition  that  CGPL  establish  130  ha  of  compensatory  forest  at  Bamnka,  Bhachau  Taluka, \nKutch district. \n \n\n4. \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement Impacts \n\nLoss  of  Structures  and  Other  Assets.  A  few  temporary  structures  (cattle  sheds  and \n\n \n9. \nThe Project will entail loss of private land, temporary structures, and other assets; and \naffect common property resources and access of the fishing community to fish-drying areas on \nthe coastline. \n \n10. \nLoss  of  Private  Land.  Private  land  (181  ha)  to  be  acquired  comprises  95  land  plots \nowned by 76 families. Although listed in the village panchayat records as agricultural, this land \nis predominantly saline and of low and unreliable productivity with some grazing potential.  \n \n11. \nAmong the private landowners are 30 households classified as belonging to vulnerable \ngroups.8 Nine households are identified as scheduled castes, while 21 are women landowners. \nNo one losing land or livelihoods from privately owned land belongs to any scheduled tribes. \n \n12. \nthatched sheds) and other assets (wells) will require compensation. \n \n13. \nLoss of Common Property Resources. The acquisition of public land will have partial \neconomic impacts on Tunda, Mota Kandagra, and Nana Bhadiya villages. Approximately 4% of \ntotal available grazing land, 50% of total available wasteland, and 40% of total available private \nagricultural land in village Tunda and subvillage Tunda Wandh are required. In Motakandagra, \n45%  of  the  total  available  wasteland  and  all  forestland  (open  scrub  vegetation)  are  required, \nwhile  in  Nana  Bhadia,  33%  of  the  total  available  wasteland  in  the  village  is  required.  Cattle \nrearing  and  milking  is  an  important  source  of  livelihood  in  the  affected  villages  in  which \n330 households have 4,340 livestock. In Tunda Wandh, about 150  rabaris (shepherds) will be \naffected by acquisition of grazing land. Approximately 80 charcoal makers utilize wood from the \nthorn scrub plant species in the area. \n \nImpact on Fishing Communities. Although the fishing potential of the Gulf of Kutch is \n14. \nsignificant, no local fishing activities occur in the coastal waters directly fronting the project area, \nwhich  has  vast  intertidal  mudflats.  The  nearest  small  fishing  community  is  at  the  Kotdi  creek \nbank located outside the project area about 2.8 km from the Mudhwa creek. The discharge of \nspent cooling water will not affect the fishing activities in the gulf. The provision of a culvert over \nthe intake channel will ensure continued access of the fishing community to fish-drying areas on \nthe coastline. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n8  Affected  persons  considered  socially  \u201cvulnerable\u201d  comprise  households  headed  by  women,  those  who  are \n\nphysically challenged, and those who belong to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. \n\n\fAppendix 3      27 \n\nPolicy and Legal Framework \n\nB. \n \n\n1. \n\nCompensation and Resettlement and Rehabilitation Principles \n\n \nThe policy framework and entitlements for the Project are based on the Land Acquisition \n15. \nAct of 1894 (amended in 1984), National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy (NRRP, 2007); \nand  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995).

If acquisition of land through the consent mechanism fails, other provisions of the relevant act \nmay  be  invoked,  i.e.,  it  would  follow  the  conventional  process  of  land  acquisition  adopted  by  the  district \nadministration as per the Land Acquisition Act. \n\nSource: Coastal Gujarat Power Limited. \n \n\n\fAppendix 3      31 \n\nPublic Consultation, Disclosure, and Grievance Redress Mechanisms \n\nC. \n \n\n1. \n\nPublic Consultations and Disclosure \n\n \nThe  Government  initiated  discussions  with  the  local  community  in  2005  before  CGPL \n17. \nwas transferred to the successful bidder, the Tata Power Company Limited, in April 2007. The \nfirst formal consultation took place in September 2006 as a public hearing on the findings of the \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  of  the  Project.  The  public  hearing  was  conducted  by  the \ndistrict  collector  in  the  presence  of  officials  from  Gujarat  Pollution  Control  Board,  CGPL,  and \nrepresentatives  of  affected  communities.  The  major  concerns  related  to  the  location, \ncompensation  package  land,  availability  of  gauchar  land,  and  apprehension  on  environmental \npollution due to the Project. \n \n18. \nAfter transfer of CGPL to TPC in April 2007 about eight (small group and large public) \nmeetings  were  organized  both  at  Bhuj  (five  meetings)  and  in  project-affected  villages  (three \nmeetings).  These  meetings  were  attended  by  affected  people  and  village  sarpanches,  public \nrepresentatives in district panchayat, and local leaders. At that stage, key issues raised related \nto the compensation package for land and alternative land for cattle grazing. \n\n \n19. \nInformation  on  affected  assets,  compensation  rate  and  payments,  and  mitigation \nmeasures have been disclosed through notices and public communications to affected persons \nfrom April to November 2007, which has given them sufficient time to raise objections and for \nCGPL  to  propose  alternative  mitigation  measures.  The  short  resettlement  plan  has  been \ndisclosed on the ADB website and a summary made available to affected persons in the local \nlanguage  at  the  tehsil  and  the  district  magistrates\u2019  offices.  CGPL  has  dedicated  resources  to \nensure  that  the  consultative  process  will  continue  during  construction  and  operation  of  the \npower plant. CGPL is committed to ensuring that affected households and the local community \nbenefit substantively from opportunities offered by the Project. \n \n\n2. \n\nGrievance Redress Mechanisms \n\n \n20. \nAn effective district grievance redress mechanism will be set up to deal with grievances \nof  the  project-affected  people  relating  to  land  acquisition  and  rehabilitation.  Effective \nparticipation of the affected communities will be ensured in the process. The grievance redress \nmechanism will be a two-tier system comprising a field cell, and a senior cell. The field cell will \naddress  grievances  pertaining  to  eligibility  and  entitlement  filed  by  affected  individuals  or \nfamilies. It will comprise the community relations officer, assisted by the village coordinator and \nthe  village  workers  of  the  concerned  village.  The  senior  cell  will  be  chaired  by  the  district \nadministration\u2019s representative, normally the block development officer and other cell members, \nand include two representatives of the affected community and the head of community relation \nteam of CGPL. It will review cases escalated by the field cell for consideration. The claimants \nwhose cases were rejected by the field cell can apply to the senior cell for review.  \n \n21. \nor, if required, in a court of law that will be distinct from CGPL\u2019s responsibilities. \n \nD. \n \nThe  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  of  the  Project  can  be  mitigated  and  opportunities \n22. \ngenerated  maximized  by  taking  up  appropriate  mitigation  measures  in  consultation  with  local \n\nIssues requiring legal advice will be handled by the panchayat and district administration \n\nIncome Restoration and Rehabilitation \n\n \n\n\f32     Appendix 3      \n\nin \n\nresidents.  CGPL  will  implement  the  following  mitigation  measures  to  mitigate  the  impacts  on \naccount of private and public land acquisition. \n \n23. \nRestoration  of  Income  for  Loss  of  Agriculture  Land.  Aside  from  payment  of  full \ncompensation for acquired land at negotiated rates, vulnerable affected people who have lost all \ntheir  land  or  are  left  with  unviable  parcels  of  land  will  be  assisted  in  utilizing  their  cash \ncompensation to buy alternate land in a nearby area, given land availability. Compensation for \nthe standing crop for the land acquired by the Project, will be paid at market value. \n \n24. \nProvision of Alternative Grazing Land. CGPL is working with the Gujarat government \nand  affected  communities  to  develop  and  implement  solutions  to  ensure  that  livelihoods  of \ncattle-grazing  communities \nthe  project-affected  villages  are  not  adversely  affected. \nCompensation  paid  for  gauchar  land  includes  an  30%  to  ensure  the  gauchar  land  can  be \npurchased to restore the area required to support the animal population in the village. Villagers \ncan  continue  grazing  on  the  project  land  until  construction  activities  begin.  Alternate  grazing \nland and forestland will be made available to the villagers by the Gujarat government. \n \n25. \nProvision  of  Employment  and  Livelihood  Opportunities.  The  Project  will  employ \n5,000\u20136,000 people during construction and 720 during operations. During construction, CGPL \nwill  provide  suitable  employment  opportunities  to  appropriately  skilled  affected  people.  During \nproject operation, the suitable local community will be employed to the extent possible. Special \nefforts  will  be  made  to  train  local  residents  to  achieve  skills  for  better  employability  and \nentrepreneurship development in the area. CGPL will also encourage entrepreneurship among \nthe community by awarding service contracts to qualified local candidates for such activities as \ncanteens,  vehicle  hiring,  maintenance  of  gardens,  office  services  and  cleanliness,  courier \nservices, and material supplies. \n \n26. \nRestoration of Other Common Property Resources. The traditional mela (fair) in the \narea  occurs  annually.  An  approach  road  will  be  built  that  will  ensure  continued  access  to  the \nmela in addition to the current approach road. The approach road is expected to be completed \nwithin 6 months. CGPL is coordinating with local officials to provide open space for village youth \nwho use public land as a cricket playground and identify alternate sites for the crematorium to \nbe used by scheduled castes.  \n \n27. \nAccess  to  the  coastline  will  be  ensured  by  providing  a  culvert  over  the  intake  channel \nconnecting  to  Kotdi  creek.  The  culvert  will  be  completed  before  any  interruption  by  the \nconstruction of the intake channel. \n \nE. \n \nBased  on  the  detailed  measurement  survey  and  census,  the  resettlement  and \n28. \nrehabilitation budget will be worked out. Besides the cost for land, other allowances for different \ncategories will be ascertained. In addition, affected people will be entitled to a resettlement and \nrehabilitation assistance according to the NRRP 2007. Contingency provisions will be made to \ntake into account variations from this estimate. The budget will be indicative of outlays for the \ndifferent expenditure categories. These costs will be updated and adjusted to the inflation rate \nas  the  Project  continues  and  given  more  specific  information  such  as  increased  number  of \naffected people during implementation; unit costs will be updated as necessary. \n \n29. \nCosts  for  Budget  Components.  The  budgetary  allocation  for  the  rehabilitation \ncomponent of the Project was based on the anticipated impacts, entitlement options as defined \n\nRehabilitation Budget \n\n\fAppendix 3      33 \n\nCompensation  for  Structures  and  Other  Nonland  Assets.  A  consolidated  allocation \n\nin the entitlement matrix, and requirements to be fulfilled as per the directives under the NRRP \n2007 and guidelines prescribed by the International Finance Corporation and ADB. The budget \ncovering resettlement and rehabilitation activities is approximately Rs100 million. \n \nThe  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  budget,  excluding  land  compensation  cost,  is  for \n30. \nRs1.5  million  per  ha  of  private  land  for  181 ha.  Monetary  assistance  for  structures  and  other \nassets;  expenditures  for  livelihood  restoration  program  and  training;  budgetary  allocation  for \nfacilitating market linkages and entrepreneurial development; and land development for fodder \nproduction, water conservation, and silvipastoral practices are part of the allocation. \n \n31. \nTo  ensure  functioning  of  the  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  cell  through  the  project  life \ncycle and facilitate project preparation and implementation, the Project will cover administrative \ncosts of the resettlement and rehabilitation cell, payments for necessary consultancy services, \nproject  implementation  support  services,  and  postimplementation  evaluation  by  independent \nagency. This is part of the budgetary allocation. \n \nIn line with its corporate social responsibility initiative, requirements under NRRP 2007, \n32. \nand  guidelines  prescribed  by  the  International  Finance  Corporation  and  ADB,  peripheral  area \ndevelopment in the district is part of the budgetary allocation. \n \nCompensation  for  Acquisition  of  Private  Properties.  The  compensation  for  the \n33. \npermanent acquisition of private agricultural land has been agreed at Rs1.5 million per ha. The \nagreement is based on negotiations between affected persons and CGPL. \n \n34. \nwill be made for temporary structures (sheds) and other assets (wells). \n \n35. \nLivelihood  Restoration  Budget.  A  detailed  livelihood  restoration  component  will  be \nestimated  for  the  Project.  The  livelihood  restoration  component  will  include  funding  for \nemployment  opportunities,  and  monetary  and  nonmonetary  allowances.  The  components  will \ninclude (i) training for agricultural laborers on non-land-based activities, (ii) training and material \nprocurement  support  and  market  linkages  for  artisans,  (iii)  alternate  livelihood  options  and \ntraining for charcoal manufacturers, (iv) vocational training for employable persons in Industrial \nTraining  Institute  and  other  technical  institutions,  (v)  implementation  of  women-led  self-help \ngroup activities and cooperative activities (cottage industries, handicrafts, microcredit activities, \npickle and papad [lentil chips] making, etc.) and (vi) development of grazing and pasture lands. \n \n36. \nAllowance  to  Vulnerable  Affected  Persons.  A  pension  plan  for  affected  people  and \nfamilies identified under the vulnerable category will be allocated. It will include (i) pension to the \nvulnerable  category;  (ii)  facilitation  of  income  restoration  activity  in  the  project  villages;  \n(iii) community development programs in the project area; (iv) infrastructure augmentation in the \nproject  villages  (water  supply,  sewerage,  sanitation,  roads  and  solid  waste  management);  \n(v) development of common property resources and community assets in the villages. \n \n37. \napproach road to the mela ground. \n \n38. \nSupporting  Cost  for  Implementation  of  the  Resettlement  Plan.  Allocation  will  be \nmade for administrative cost for the institutional setup within CGPL for finalizing the resettlement \nplan,  implementing  resettlement  and  rehabilitation,  logistics,  preparation  of  other  compliance \ndocuments for submission to funding institutions and implementation support agencies. \n\nApproach  Road  Construction.  Allocation  will  be  made  for  construction  of  a  new \n\n \n\n\f34     Appendix 3      \n\nThe implementation schedule is presented in Table A5.3. \n\nInstitutional Arrangements and Implementation Schedule \n\nContingency.  Fifteen  percent  of  the  budget  will  be  kept  as  contingency  to  absorb  any \n\n \n39. \nvariation in the budget during implementation. \n \nF. \n \n40. \nSince April 2007, CGPL has set up a project office at Bhuj, which acts as a link between \npeople  from  the  project-affected  villages  and  the  company.  At  present,  two  senior  staff  and \nother  support  staff  are  engaged  in  addressing  issues  related  to  land  acquisition.  The  officials \ninteract on a regular basis with the villagers and attempt to address their concerns. In order to \nstrengthen the process, CGPL will establish a formal project management office with expertise \nin  engineering  planning  and  design,  financial  management,  procurement  and  contracts \nmanagement,  and  environmental  and  social  impacts  management.  The  project  management \noffice  will  have  a  full-time  corporate  social  responsibility  and  resettlement  and  rehabilitation \nofficer  who  will  be  responsible  for  ongoing  community  engagement,  and  finalization  and \nimplementation of the resettlement plan. \n \n41. \n \nG. \n \n42. \nthe \nimplementation  progress  as  well  as  any  updates  on  the  resettlement  plan.
