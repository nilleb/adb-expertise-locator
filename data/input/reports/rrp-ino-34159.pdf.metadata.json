The links lie in trans-island corridors \nand  serve  interregional  trade  and  local  traffic,  providing  a  corridor \nfrom  Indonesia  to  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations \n(ASEAN) highway through links with Malaysia and Brunei. The Project \nwill  strengthen  the  capacity  of  central  and  provincial  agencies  to \nmaintain and protect road surfaces and reduce the risk of accidents in \nareas  of  growing  traffic.  The  Project  includes  training  and  capacity-\nbuilding subcomponents. \n \nSince the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis, the Government has focused \non  macroeconomic  stabilization,  corporate \nrestructuring,  bank \nrecapitalization,  and  mobilization  of  resources  to  strengthen  social \nsafety nets. As a result of scarce financial resources, spending on the \ntransport  infrastructure,  specifically  roads,  was  cut.  As  part  of  its \nnational  transport  network  development  plan,  the  Government  is \nfocusing on upgrading and developing main national road corridors to \nimprove  intra-  and  interisland  transport  links,  within  Indonesia  and \nwith other neighboring countries. The Kalimantan Highway corridor, in \nparticular, is a major link between Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, and \nMalaysia that will promote regional cooperation. With fiscal constraints \nlikely  to  remain,  external  support  is  critical  to  preserving,  upgrading, \nand  developing  priority  links  and  supporting  economic  recovery.  In \nSumatra and Kalimantan, an inadequate road network has increased \ntransport  costs  for  the  important  agricultural,  plantation,  petroleum, \nand  industrial  sectors;  raised  transport  costs  between  provincial \ncenters and plantation areas and ports; and limited local transport. By \nimproving  the  condition  of  high-priority  links,  the  Project  will  facilitate \ntrade, \nregional \ncooperation;  improve  accessibility  and  living  conditions  in  isolated \nareas  that  have  growth  prospects;  and  help  reduce  poverty.  The \nProject  also  aims  to  develop  new  approaches  to  road  maintenance \nmanagement and institutional capacity building and training related to \nroad policy. The Project is in line with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s \n(ADB) strategic focus for Indonesia and included in the 2005 country \nstrategy and program update. \n\ninvestment,  and  economic  growth;  promote \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe expected impact of the Project is economic growth and improved \nliving  conditions  in  poor  areas  of  Sumatra  and  Kalimantan.  The \nprimary  outcome  of  the  Project  is  improved  vehicular  access  via \nstrategic national roads on these islands. The Project will help reduce \ntransport  tariffs,  improve  road  safety,  reduce  truck  overloading,  and \npromote  financial  transparency  through  better  fiduciary  control  and \nanticorruption measures. Combined with other activities of the country \nstrategy  and  program,  it  will  help  reduce  poverty  in  project  areas.  It \nwill rehabilitate about 1,300 kilometers (km) of deteriorated roads and \nreplace or widen about 40 bridges on the Trans-Sumatra Central and \nEastern  corridors  and  Trans-Kalimantan  Highway,  linking  producing \nareas and markets through 10 provinces on the country\u2019s two largest \nislands.  To  ensure  that  the  rehabilitated  roads  do  not  deteriorate \nprematurely  and  to  secure  sustainable  benefits,  the  Project  will \ninclude measures to reduce pavement damage caused by overloaded \ntrucks.  Working  with  local  agencies,  it  will  explore  new  ways  of \nutilizing  available  resources  to  maintain  roads  and  reduce  the  risk  of \naccidents  in  roadside  communities  by  raising  awareness  of  the  risk. \nThe training and capacity-building components include environmental \nand  social  impact  management,  as  well  as  training  in  project \n(i) \nmanagement  and  engineering  support  practices, \nconstruction  contract  law;  (ii)  landslide  control,  slope  stability,  and \nretaining  walls;  (iii)  financial  management  and  control;  (iv)  road  and \nbridge  maintenance;  and  (v)  technical  specifications  in  road  and \nbridge works.  \n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $215.8  million  equivalent \n(including taxes), consisting of $76.2 million in foreign exchange costs \nand $139.6 million equivalent in local currency costs. \n \n\nincluding \n\nSource \n \n\nADB \nGovernment \n\nTotal \n\nForeign \nExchange \n76.2 \n0.0 \n76.2 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n74.8 \n64.8 \n139.6 \n\n($ million, 2005 prices)\n\nTotal \n \n151.0 \n64.8 \n215.8 \n\nTotal Cost \n(%) \n70 \n30 \n100 \n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n \nA  loan  of  $151  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  will  be \nprovided  under  a  lending  facility  based  on  the  London  interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR).

The  Project  also  aims  to  promote  regional  cooperation  by \ndeveloping corridor linkages to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Highway in \nKalimantan and the Asian Highway in Sumatra. The project design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1.  \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nThe Road Sector  \n\n3. \nRoad  transport  carried  about  95%  of  Indonesia\u2019s  estimated  interprovincial  freight  and \n85%  of  passenger  traffic  in  2001  (2003  estimates).2  At  the  end  of  2002,  Indonesia\u2019s  road \nnetwork  was  close  to  324,150  kilometers  (km),  excluding  515  km  of  toll  roads  and  some \n250,000 km of unclassified village roads (Appendix 2). Despite recent funding increases and a \nrenewed emphasis on maintenance, roads have not yet returned to the condition they were in \nbefore the Asian financial crisis of 1997/98. \n \n4. \nIn 2003, 32.7 million vehicles (excluding police and military vehicles) were registered, of \nwhich 14.8% were passenger cars, 6.0% buses and vans, 8.2% trucks, and 71.0% motorcycles. \nRoad  transport  services  are  mainly  provided  by  private  companies.  Except  in  remote  areas\u2014\nwhere demand is thin, investors few, and road conditions poor\u2014the transport services industry \nis  competitive.  Entry  is  largely  unrestricted  and  tariffs  determined  by  market  forces,  with  the \nexception of fares for low-income passenger services set by the Government for interprovincial \nservices and by provincial authorities for services within provinces. Even so, there is competition \non  the  basis  of  service  quality  and  frequency.  In  general,  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs \nmade possible by road improvements are passed on through reductions or delayed increases in \nfares. \n \nFour  national  Government  agencies  play  key  roles  in  the  road  sector.  The  National \n5. \nDevelopment  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS)  formulates  national  development  strategies, \nestablishes  broad  policy  and \nthe \nimplementation  of  annual  development  budgets.  The  Ministry  of  Communications  (MOC)  is \nresponsible  for  policy  formulation,  and  for  planning,  regulating,  and  managing  most  transport \ninfrastructure (except roads) and some transport services. Within MOC, the Directorate General \nfor  Land  Communications  (DGLC)  is  responsible  for  land  communications.  The  Ministry  of \nPublic  Works  (MPW),  through  its  Directorate  General  of  Highway  (DGH),  develops  and \nmaintains  the  national  roads,  sets  technical  standards  for  all  types  of  roads,  and  provides \ntechnical assistance (TA) to road agencies at the lower administration levels. DGH has regional \noffices  (P3JJ)  for  road  design  and  supervision.  The  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  coordinates  the \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2002.

Transport  Sector \n\nProject. Manila (TA 3989 INO). \n\nStudy. Manila.  \n\n\fmanagement of lower levels of government (provinces, districts, and municipalities) in relation to \nthe road sector. \n \n\n2. \n\nSector Policy Framework \n\nin  2001,  Law  32/2004  (revised  22/1999)  has \n\n6. \nLike other sectors, road transport sector growth and performance have been affected by \ndecentralization.  As  part  of  the  fiscal  and  administrative  decentralization  process,  made \neffective \ntransferred  most  Government \nresponsibilities  to  the  regions,  with  regencies  (kabupaten)  and  cities  (kota)  as  the  main  focal \npoints. Law 33/2004 (revised 25/1999) specifies how the new regional responsibilities are to be \nfinanced. For instance, motor vehicle fuel taxes are collected directly by provinces or kabupaten \nfor their own purposes. \n \n7. \nMOC  has  developed  the  2005\u20132009  transport  strategic  plan,  and  DGLC  periodically \nupdates  its  policy  statement  and  action  plan  (PSAP)  for  roads,  traffic,  and  transport.  The  first \nPSAP was issued in 1989; the most recent draft covers 2001\u20132005. The latest ADB road project \nin Indonesia\u2014the Road Rehabilitation (Sector) Project (RRSP)3\u2014includes a component to help \nDGLC  monitor  the  PSAP\u2019s  progress  and  implement  policies  related  to  user  charges,  cost \nrecovery,  road  maintenance  funding,  vehicle  overloading,  road  safety,  and  private  sector \nparticipation.  This  component  helps  amend  road  and  road  transport  regulations  to  encourage \ncompetition  in  road  transport  services,  and  strengthen  road  management  and  development \nplanning. \n \n\n3. \n\nRoad Expenditure Management Systems  \n\n8. \nRoad  and  bridge  expenditure  needs  are  assessed  using  DGH\u2019s  Indonesian  integrated \nroad  management  system  (IIRMS).  Developed  through  the  1980s  and  1990s,  this  computer-\nassisted  tool  maximizes  the  benefits  of  road  improvements  and  maintenance  funding \nallocations. IIRMS predicts pavement deterioration over time and under traffic load. The system \nanalyzes  the  impacts  of  alternative  treatment  options  for  each  link,  thereby  determining  the \neconomically optimum expenditure scenario, with or without budget constraints. DGH assesses \nbudget  requirements  mainly  on  IIRMS  outputs,  but  sometimes  combines  them  with  broader \nstrategies for network development. One such strategy is to develop key corridors to link main \npopulation  centers  and  facilitate  trade  within  the  country  and  with  external  markets.  The  links \nproposed for the Project all lie along priority corridors under this strategy (Maps 1 and 2). \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nSector Problems, Causes, and Impacts \n\nThe  three  interconnected  key  sectoral  problems  are  (i)  road  deterioration,  (ii)  vehicle \n9. \noverloading and inefficient road transport operations, and (iii) road traffic accidents. Appendix 3 \nshows the interactions between them, their causes, and their impacts. \n \nRoad Deterioration and Limited Maintenance Fund. Deteriorated national roads raise \n10. \nthe  costs  of  road  transport  by  increasing  the  consumption  of  fuel,  oil  and  tires;  increasing \nvehicle wear and tear; and raising vehicle insurance rates. Poor road conditions reduce vehicle \n                                                 \n3  ADB.  2000.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nRepublic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Road  Rehabilitation  Sector  Project.  Manila  (Loan  1798-INO,  for  $190  million, \napproved in December 2000). \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nspeeds, lowering the productivity of vehicles and people. Increased transport costs are passed \non  to  consumers,  who  pay  higher  prices  to  travel  or  to  move  commodities,  reducing  their \nwillingness to pay and, hence, their mobility and access to economic and welfare opportunities. \nRoad maintenance is therefore essential to reduce transport costs.  \n \n11. \nRoad  cost  recovery  must  be  improved  to  sustain  maintenance  funding  and  reduce \ndependency on variable budgets.4 User charges mainly consist of (i) vehicle ownership transfer \nfees, (ii) annual vehicle registration fees, and (iii) a 5% fuel tax. Revenues from taxes and fees \nconstitute a major part of provinces\u2019 self-generated funds. These fees are treated as general tax \nrevenues  and  are  not  incomes  dedicated  to  road  maintenance,  considering  that users  receive \nsubsidies in the form of below-market prices for fuel. These subsidies were estimated for 2004 \nat Rp60 trillion (close to the Government\u2019s whole development budget of Rp75 trillion for 2004), \nbut the Government reduced the fuel subsidy by increasing prices of major fuel products by 22\u2013\n53% on 28 February 2005. These increases could not totally remove the subsidies because of \nhigh  international  oil  prices.  This  is,  however,  a  major  step  to  set  up  a  healthier  fuel  pricing \nstructure,  and  will  further  ease  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal  constraints  on  road  maintenance.  The \nnew  road  law  also  ensures  that  priority  will  be  given  to  road  maintenance  budget,  although  it \ndoes  not  plan  to  create  a  dedicated  road  fund.  The  budget  allocation  for  road  and  bridge \nmaintenance  for  national  roads  increased  significantly  in  2002  but  has  only  increased  slightly \nfrom 2003 to 2005. The current level road maintenance of about Rp1.2 trillion is obviously still \nbelow the requirement for all Indonesian provinces. \n \n12. \nVehicle Overloading and Inefficiencies in Road Transport Operations. The common \npractice  of  vehicle  overloading  increases  total  road  transport  costs  by  accelerating  pavement \ndeterioration. Vehicle-weighing stations are obsolete, badly maintained, or improperly operated. \nRecords  are  often  unreliable,  corruption  occurs  frequently,  and  traffic  regulations  are  not \nenforced.  The  number  of  prosecutions  against  road  violators  is  negligible.  The  World  Bank\u2019s \nSumatra Region Roads Project has been trying on a pilot basis since early 2004 to have four \nweighbridges managed by private operators (one in Aceh Province and three in West Sumatra \nProvince).5  Under  this  initiative,  the  weighbridges  have  been  upgraded  and  supplemented  by \nautomatic  weigh-in-motion  (WIM)  equipment  that  allows  crosschecking  of  the  weighbridge \nrecords. Other bridge design measures need to be provided to mitigate pavement overloading, \nfor  example,  installation  of  bridge  height  clearance  structures  to  control  the  passage  of \noverloaded or oversized vehicles.  \n  \n13. \nOther  inefficiencies  in  road  transport  operations  stem  from  poor  pavement  conditions, \npoor  driving  standards,  low  standards  of  vehicle  maintenance,  poor  fleet  management,  and \ninappropriate  vehicle  technologies.  This  is  mainly  due  to  an  inadequate  road  user  taxation \nsystem  that  does  not  require  sufficient  users\u2019  contribution  to  road  costs,  and  gives  truck \noperators  no  incentive  to  replace  old,  inefficient  vehicles  with  more  modern,  multiple-axle \nvehicles that do less pavement damage per ton of payload.  \n \n14. \nRoad Traffic Accidents. Indonesia\u2019s high levels of road traffic accidents are the result \nof poor standards of driver education, training, and testing; poor vehicle safety standards; and \nlimited  awareness  of  accident  risk\u2014all  attributable  to  shortcomings  in  traffic  education  and \nenforcement. Accident risks are made worse by insufficient attention to safety features in road \n                                                 \n4  The  World  Bank\u2019s  Eastern  Indonesia  Region  Transport  Project  envisages  road  maintenance  through  multiyear \ncontracts to the private sector; should such a system be implemented, annual availability of funds would no longer \nbe  a  constraint.  The  project  includes  a  trial  implementation  of  a  provincial  road  fund  sourced  from  user  charges \ncollected by the province. \n\n5   Based on a recent status report by DGLC, the results are encouraging. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\ndesign. In 2003, about 10,000 road fatalities (3 deaths per 10,000 registered vehicles) and more \nthan  14,000  serious  injuries  were  recorded.  The  actual  figures  may  be  higher  as  transport \ndepartment  records  differ  significantly  from  the  traffic  police  records  to  the  hospitals.  A  high \nproportion of victims are pedestrians. The social and economic costs of road fatalities, injuries, \nand  material  damage  have  been  estimated  about  2\u20133%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP). \nUnder  ADB\u2019s  regional  road  safety  TA,6  ASEAN  member  countries  are  committed  to \nimplementing  the  ASEAN  Road  Safety  Strategy  and  Action  Plan  2005\u20132010,  comprising  12 \nactions. The Project will help the Government implement two actions identified under the plan: \npromoting  greater  awareness  and  steady  enforcement  of  traffic  rules  and  regulations,  and \nfostering a culture of road safety. \n \n\n2. \n\nRoad Connectivity and Poverty Reduction \n\n15. \nIndonesia\u2019s  poverty  incidence  was  about  23%  (about  48  million  people)  in  1998,  then \ndeclined  to  about  18%  (about  38  million)  in  2002,  according  to  the  National  Socioeconomic \nSurvey  (BPS  SUSENAS).7  Regional  variations  are  sharp:  poverty  is  more  common  in  rural \nareas than in urban centers, and in the project area, it varies from 18% in Riau to 42% in South \nSumatra, and 30% in South Kalimantan to 57% in Central Kalimantan.  \n \n16. \nNational  roads  are  the  arteries  of  trade  and  commerce  and  enable  the  incomes  of  the \npoor  to  grow.  Agriculture  products\u2014cultivated  largely  by  the  poor,  who  rely  on  basic \ncommodities hauled in from cities\u2014need an effective transportation network to be delivered on \ntime. The poverty assessment done in November 2000 notes that increasing the productivity of \nagriculture  requires  improved  infrastructure,  including  transport,  which  will  reduce  regional \ndisparity and rural poverty over the medium term. The Government White Paper8 identifies the \ninfrastructure backlog as a key bottleneck to poverty reduction. Better roads will improve access \nby the poor, as well as doctors and teachers, to health centers and schools. \n \n \n \n17. \nThe  2004\u20132009  Government  midterm  development  plan  places  high  priority  on  the \ndevelopment of infrastructure within the overarching objectives of creating peace and security, \ncreating democracy and fairness, and improving people\u2019s prosperity. Road development policy \nprioritizes on increasing road capacity and quality to more developed regions by strengthening \nisland-based  main  national  road  corridors  and  providing  better  access  to  less  developed \nregions, including remote and border areas. The development of these national corridors is part \nof the Government\u2019s commitment to the ASEAN regional cooperation program, which requires \nimplementation  of  priority  infrastructure  projects  at  national  level.  Improving  integration  and \nconnectivity,  developing  land  transport  and  trade  corridors  linking  Brunei  Darussalam, \nIndonesia,  and  Malaysia  are  ASEAN  milestone  objectives.  The  Project  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \nstrategic focus for Indonesia and is included in the 2005 country strategy and program update. It \nis also an integral part of ADB\u2019s regional cooperation strategy and program for Southeast Asia, \nwhich is being prepared.9 \n \n\nGovernment and ADB Transport Sector Strategies \n\n3. \n\n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance for Road Safety in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Manila (TA 6077-\n\nREG). \n\n7   Excludes Papua and Aceh. \n8   INPRES 5/2003. \n9   It will cover Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Singapore.  \n\n\f \n\n5\n\n4. \n\nRoad Sector Assistance and Lessons Learned \n\n18. \nADB  has  assisted  Indonesia\u2019s  road  sector  since  1976.  ADB\u2019s  total  lending  amounts  to \n$1.57  billion  for  15  projects,  14  of which  have  been  completed.  Indonesia  had  received  about \n$7.6  billion in  foreign  assistance  for  road  development  from  1984  to 2003.  Of  this,  33% came \nfrom the World Bank and 33% from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC). ADB\u2019s \ncontribution  was  about  17%  and  bilateral  funding  agencies  from  countries  such  as  Australia, \nAustria,  Germany,  Kuwait,  Saudi  Arabia,  and  the  United  States  provided  the  remaining  17%. \nADB has also provided grants totaling $4.3 million (Appendix 4).  \n \n19. \nProject completion reports have been prepared for 14 ADB-financed road projects, with \nall rated projects considered successful except one partly successful. Performance audit reports \nhave been prepared for 9 projects, all rated successful. The reports identified the following key \nlessons: (i) in the short term, projects should focus on periodic maintenance and rehabilitation; \n(ii) simplified design procedures used by DGH to prepare subprojects on a network basis should \nbe replaced with detailed design methods; (iii) economic evaluation should be more thorough, \nespecially traffic growth projections; (iv) greater attention should be paid to drainage structures; \n(v) periodic maintenance should not compensate for delayed or poor routine maintenance; and \n(vi) the capacity of the executing agency and its relationship with the implementing agency are \ncrucial  to  project  success.  Another  lesson  is  that  capacity  and  institution  building  should  be \nimplemented regularly to avoid skill loss as a result of staff retirement or transfer.  \n \n20. \nRecently, projects have been delayed by lack or late release of counterpart funds, and \nby  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  problems,  especially  the  North  Java  Road  Improvement \nProject.10 Resettlement issues have been minimized under the RRSP, which, however, suffered \nother  delays  (para.  21).  Fraudulent  practices  and  corruption,  especially  in  procurement,  were \nalso perceived to have led to poor quality of work. \n  \nLessons  from  the  RRSP.  The  RRSP  is  behind  schedule  due  mainly  to  delays  in \n21. \nrecruiting the consultants, preparing the subprojects\u2019 reports and detailed designs, and issuing \nand  approving  the  bidding  documents  for  the  civil  works.  As  of  mid  August  2005,  33%  of  the \nRRSP had been disbursed and 73% of the contracts awarded. While the problems that delayed \nthe  RRSP  have  been  resolved,  the  late  release  of  the  2005  counterpart  funds  set  back \nimplementation.  Efforts  have  been  made  to  tackle  this  issue,  and  adequate  counterpart  funds \nare now available. The RRSP disbursement rate is now improving and cumulative disbursement \nis  projected  to  be  close  to  50%  by  early  2006  when  the  implementation  of  the  Project  is \nexpected to start. All contracts will be awarded by early 2006 and the RRSP is expected to be \ncompleted by the extended loan closing date.11 \n \n22. \nThe lessons learned under the RRSP have been incorporated into the proposed Project. \nTaking  advantage  of  the  ADB-approved  advance  actions  for  procurement,  preconstruction \nactivities  for  the  first  year  of  implementation  are  being  carried  out  using  RRSP  consultants \n(para.  32).  Bids  for  the  first  year  of  rehabilitation  works  are  expected  to  be  called  in  October \n2005  and  recommendations  for  contract  award  should  be  issued  in  early  2006.  Concurrently, \nfor  design  and  construction  supervision  has  started. \nthe  recruitment  of  consultants \nRecommendations for award of consultants\u2019 contracts are expected by December 2005.  \n \n                                                 \n10  ADB.  1995.

Manila \n(Loan 1428-INO for $150 million, approved January 1996 and completed in December 2002).  \n\n11  ADB approved on 10 March 2005 an extension of the loan closing date from 31 March 2005 to 28 February 2007. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\n23.  While  the  Project  covers  national  roads  only,  local  agencies  will  be  involved  in  the \ndesign  and  procurement  of  the  rehabilitation  works.  Their  involvement  in  the  RRSP  delayed \nimplementation  because  they  lacked  capacity  and  the  knowledge  of  ADB\u2019s  procurement \nguidelines.  They  have  gained  experience  over  the  last  3  years  and,  with  the  early  support  of \nconsultants, should provide the required inputs on time. Implementation workshops will be held \nupon loan effectiveness to update project staff on ADB procedures and policies\u2014procurement \nand  safeguard  policies  in  particular.  Land  acquisition-related  delays  are  unlikely  as  the  works \nare to be carried out within the existing right-of-way. To facilitate the liaison with the executing \nagency  and  implementing  agencies  and  ensure  timely  project  monitoring  by  ADB  staff,  it  is \nproposed to have the Project administered by the Indonesian Resident Mission.  \n  \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n24. \nThe expected impact of the Project is economic growth and improved living conditions in \npoor areas of Sumatra and Kalimantan. The primary outcome is improved vehicular access on \nstrategic  national  roads.  The  Project  will  help  reduce  transport  tariffs,  improve  road  safety, \nreduce  road  deterioration  due  to  overloaded  vehicles,  and  promote  financial  transparency \nthrough improved fiduciary control and anticorruption measures. Combined with other activities \nincluded  in  the  country  strategy  and  program,  it  will  help  reduce  poverty  in  project  areas.  The \nroad sections to be rehabilitated under the Project lie along the strategic trans-island corridors \nlinking  producing  areas  and  markets  of  the  two  largest  islands.  The  Project  will  also  promote \nregional cooperation as the rehabilitated roads are part of the main interregional routes with the \nneighboring countries.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  Project  will  rehabilitate  deteriorated  road  sections  and  replace  bridges  on  the \n25. \nstrategic  national  road  networks.  To  ensure  that  benefits  from  road  rehabilitation  are \nsustainable,  the  Project  will  address  road  policy  issues  by  (i)  strengthening  enforcement  of \nvehicle-load  regulations,  (ii)  raising  road  safety  awareness  among  local  communities,  and  (iii) \ndeveloping  new  approaches  to  road  maintenance  management.  It  will  also  provide  capacity \nbuilding and training to strengthen capabilities in environmental and social impact management, \nproject management, and engineering support.  \n \n\n1. \n\nCivil Works: Road and Bridge Rehabilitation  \n\nThe Project will rehabilitate 1,292 km of roads through (i) the reconstruction of 60 km12 \n26. \nand resurfacing and widening of 593 km13 of the Trans-Sumatra eastern and central highways, \n(ii) reconstruction of 371 km and resurfacing of 268 km of the Trans-Kalimantan Highway, and \n(iii)  replacement  of  21 timber  and log bridges in  Kalimantan  and  widening  of  19  bridges  in  \n\n                                                 \n12    Reconstruction  (including  some  new  construction)  involves  improvement,  strengthening  of  pavements  and \n\nshoulders, and surface and subsurface drainage, within the existing right of way. \n\n13   Resurfacing and widening consists of roadway overlays with or without widening, including reshaping or addition \nof  shoulders,  minor  drainage  works,  and  road  signage  and  pavement  markings.  Natural  stone  aggregates  for \nroad construction are not commonly found in West and Central Kalimantan. A soil-cement base design has been \nproposed  for  these  areas.  However,  new  products  are  available  for  road  base  stabilization,  and  experiments \nshow  they  are  cost-effective  and  their  strength  is  comparable  to  cement.  DGH  is  recommended  to  test  new \nproducts on selected road sections in Kalimantan. \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nSumatra.  The  Project  covers  10  provinces:  Central  Kalimantan,  East  Kalimantan,  South \nKalimantan, West Kalimantan, Jambi, Lampung, North Sumatra, South Sumatra, West Sumatra, \nand Riau. The details of proposed rehabilitation works are in Appendix 5. Once rehabilitated, the \nroads and bridges14 will require routine maintenance.15 The quality and reliability of the routine \nmaintenance  will  be  enhanced  through  complementary  activities  under  the  Project\u2019s  capacity-\nbuilding component. Roads will be widened within the existing right-of-way where the road fails \nto meet DGH pavement- and shoulder-width standards. \n \n\n2. \n\nSupport to Road Sector Policies  \n\n27. \nEnforcing  Controls  on  Truck  Overloading.  Given  the  encouraging  results  of  the \nongoing  North  Sumatra  and  Aceh  pilot  initiative  to  prevent  overloading  (para.  12),  the \nGovernment  has  recommended  its  extension  to  other  regions.  Four  new  locations  have  been \nidentified,  one  in  Sumatra  and  three  in  Kalimantan,  for  privately  operated  weighbridges  with \nWIM  equipment.  The  Project  will  select  sites,  procure  equipment,  supervise  installation,  and \nsupervise  12  months\u2019  implementation  of  the  four  weighbridge  stations.  A  simultaneous \nexperiment on the two islands will enable the Government to better assess the performance of \nthe improved vehicle-load control system.  \n \n28. \nRoad  Safety  Awareness  Campaign.  Efforts  to  improve  traffic  safety  by  treating \naccident-prone  spots,  implementing  horizontal  and  vertical  signage,  and  establishing  accident \ninvestigation units are ongoing under the World Bank\u2019s funded Sumatra Regional Road Project. \nThe  RRSP  is  providing  additional  assistance  for  road  safety  policies  under  the  Government\u2019s \naction plan. However, these efforts do not address the poor awareness of accident risk among \nchildren  and  other  vulnerable  groups  in  communities  near  the  roads  to  be  rehabilitated.  The \nProject will support a road safety awareness campaign in West, Central, and South Kalimantan, \ntargeting vulnerable groups, particularly children and old people living in areas newly exposed to \nhigher traffic volume and speed.  \n \n29. \nDeveloping  New  Approaches  to  Road  Maintenance  Management.  To  ensure  the \nsustainability of investments in road construction and rehabilitation, road maintenance\u2014routine \nand periodic\u2014is essential. Although road maintenance funding is increasing (para. 11), it is still \nlimited. The Project will formulate a new approach to road maintenance management based on \nthe recommendations of a related study financed by JBIC Loan IP-467 (2001).  \n \n\n3. \n\nCapacity Building and Training \n\n30. \nProject  Management  and  Engineering  Support  Practices.  The  training  in  project \nmanagement and engineering support practices will (i) help train each project province\u2019s P3JJ \nand  government  agency  for  regional  infrastructure  to  execute  and  monitor  national  road \nmaintenance;  and  (ii)  support  central  DGH\u2019s  efforts  to  provide  guidelines,  training  resources, \nand assistance to regional road agencies in their management of the road network. The teams \nassisting the P3JJ and government agency for regional infrastructure will work directly with their \nstaff in implementing developed or new programs for project management practices, to provide \ntraining in areas that are relevant to the Project and that are Government priorities. The training \nwill cover (i) construction contract law; (ii) landslide control, slope stability, and retaining walls; \n\n                                                 \n14      Deficient  bridge  structures  will  be  replaced  on  road  sections  selected  for  reconstruction  or  resurfacing  and/or \n\n15    Routine maintenance is required periodically, depending on the traffic and other features of road sections, and is \n\nwidening.  \n\nto be financed by the Government. \n\n \n\n\f(iii)  financial  management  and  control;  (iv)  road  and  bridge  maintenance;  and  (v)  technical \nspecifications in road and bridge works. \n \n31. \nStrengthening Capabilities in Environmental and Social Impact Management. The \nProject will provide training in environmental and social impacts for road rehabilitation projects \non the national network. The training will include road planning in accordance with Government \nregulations and donor guidelines on the environment and social development. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n32. \nTo increase project readiness, the consultants recruited under the RRSP were used to \nprepare the Project under advance procurement action. The contract of the RRSP core team of \nconsultants  has  been  amended  to  incorporate  the  detailed  design  and  bidding  documents  for \nthe rehabilitation works scheduled to be implemented in the first year of the Project.  \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates  \n\n33. \nThe project cost is estimated at $215.8 million (Table 1). This includes value-added tax, \nphysical and price contingencies, and capitalized interest and commitment fees charged during \nconstruction. The foreign exchange cost of $76.2 million accounts for 35% of the total cost. The \nlocal currency component of $139.6 million equivalent constitutes the remaining 65%.

The  remaining  $64.8  million  in  local  currency  costs  will  be  financed  by  the \nGovernment.  Overall,  the  loan  will  finance  70%  of  the  estimated  project  cost.  Table  2 \nsummarizes  the  project  financing  plan.  The  Government  has  confirmed  that  sufficient \ncounterpart  funds  will  be  included  in  the  2006  national  budget  to  cover  the  first  year  of \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nimplementation.  The  required  counterpart  funds  will  be  made  available  on  time  for  the  full \nduration of the Project.  \n \n35. \nThe  ADB  loan  will  be  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources.  The  Borrower  will  be  the \nRepublic of Indonesia. Provided in US dollars, the loan will have a maturity period of 25 years, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  conversion \noptions  that  may  be  exercised  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  loan  regulations  and  conversion \nguidelines, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. Interest \nwill  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending  facility.  The  Government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  the  Government\u2019s \ndecision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were the Government\u2019s own independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice of ADB. \n \n\nSource \n  \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) \nGovernment \n\nTotal \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan  \n($ million) \nForeign \nExchange\n76.2 \n0.0 \n76.2 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n74.8 \n64.8 \n139.6 \n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nTotal \n \n151.0 \n64.8 \n215.8 \n\nTotal Cost \n(%) \n70 \n30 \n100 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nDGH will be the Executing Agency, responsible for the overall execution of the Project. \n36. \nChaired by BAPPENAS, a project steering committee representing BAPPENAS, the Ministry of \nFinance,  MPW,  and  MOC  will  monitor  and  coordinate  project  implementation.  DGH  will \nestablish a project management unit (PMU) headed by a manager with experience in externally \nfinanced projects. Appointed for the duration of the Project, the PMU staff will be responsible for \nthe day-to-day implementation and accountable for technical and financial reporting. The PMU \nhead will ensure compliance with ADB procurement guidelines and ADB safeguard policies. The \nPMU staff will be assisted by experienced engineers, accountants, and other staff as required. \nADB is comfortable with DGH\u2019s capacity and resource management. A core team of consultants \nwill  be  financed  under  the  Project  (para.  45)  and  assist  the  PMU  staff  in  management, \nadministration, monitoring, procurement, and construction supervision. \n \nDGH, DGLC, and BAPPENAS will act as the implementing agencies. Each will appoint \n37. \nexperienced project staff members to monitor and follow up the implementation of their project \ncomponents.  DGH  will  implement  the  road  rehabilitation,  and  capacity-building  and  training \ncomponents. DGLC will implement the enforcing controls on truck overloading and road safety \nawareness  campaign  subcomponents  of  the  road  sector  policy  component.  BAPPENAS  will \nimplement \nroad  maintenance  management \nsubcomponent of the road sector policy component. \n \nRoad  and  bridge  rehabilitation  works  will  be  executed  by  contractors  in  the  10  project \n38. \nprovinces, under the supervision and management of the P3JJs, assisted by two field teams of \nconsultants (para. 45), one each in Sumatra and Kalimantan.

However,  day-to-day \nmanagement and financial and reporting requirements in selected provinces will be carried out \nthrough DGLC headquarters in Jakarta.  \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Readiness \n\n40. \nProject  readiness  requires  that  the  detailed  designs  of  road  links  must  be  completed \nbefore  implementing  the  first  year\u2019s  program.  P3JJs,  assisted  by  Government-financed  local \nconsultants, are carrying out this task under advance procurement action. The detailed designs \nwill  be  reviewed  by  the  P3JJs  and  PMU  staff  before  contract  award  and  implementation.  Any \ndesign work for the road links to be rehabilitated in the following years and not completed under \nthe above arrangements will be completed by the field team consultants hired under the Project. \n \nProject management arrangements were put in place before loan negotiations, including \n41. \nsenior appointments to the steering committee, the PMU, and the implementing agencies. DGH \nhas assigned a project manager and staff to the PMU. \n \nTo  cover  counterpart  expenditure  requirements  for  the  first  year\u2019s  program,  the \n42. \nGovernment is required to allocate budgets in FY2006 and sufficient resources to DGH, DGLC, \nand BAPPENAS to implement the civil works and policy components that are expected to start \nby mid-2006. Project-readiness criteria and parties responsible are shown in Appendix 7.  \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n43. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  54  months,  from  January  2006  to  June  2010, \nincluding  mobilization  but  excluding  the  defects-liability  period.  A  tentative  implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 8.  \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n44. \nAll  procurement  to  be  financed  from  the  project  loan  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  Contracts  valued  in  excess  of  $1.0  million  for  goods  and  $1.5 \nmillion  for  civil  works  will  be  procured  by  international  competitive  bidding,  with  smaller  civil \nworks  contracts  fulfilled  through  local  competitive  bidding.  Supply  contracts  not  exceeding  $1 \nmillion will be procured through international shopping. However, only international competitive \nbidding  is  expected  to  be  used.  Equipment  and  spare  parts  required  for  the  Project,  and \nestimated  to  costs,  in  the  aggregate,  the  equivalent  of  less  than  $100,000  may  be  procured \ndirectly  from  the  manufacturers  of  the  original  equipment  or  their  agents.  Prior  to  such \nprocurement, a list of individual items to be procured, an estimate of their costs, an indication of \npotential sources of supply and any related documents shall be submitted to ADB for approval. \nAfter award, three copies of each contract for such items shall be furnished to ADB. To expedite \nprocurement before effectiveness, advance procurement action was approved on 2 April 2004, \nto procure goods, works, and related services up to but not including contract signing. Twenty-\nsix  contract  packages  developed  during  appraisal  will  allow  sufficient  competition  during \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nprocurement, and efficient program implementation. The list of contract package is in Appendix \n5.  During  project  inception,  special  workshops  targeting  staff  at  DGH,  the  PMU,  and  the \nimplementing  agencies  will  be  held  to  update  them  on  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  procedures  for \nprocurement and evaluation of proposals and bids. Similar workshops will be held for members \nof procurement committees under the Project. \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nThe Project will require 3,598 person-months of consulting services: 274 person-months \n45. \nof  international  consulting  and  3,324  person-months  of  domestic,  including  (i)  a  core  team  of \nconsultants  (109  person-months  international  consulting  and  495  person-months  domestic \nconsulting) to help the PMU supervise the Project; (ii) two field teams of consultants (96 person-\nmonths  international  and  2,381  person-months  domestic)  to  help  PIUs  and  local  government \nagencies supervise contractors implementing the Project; (iii) consultants to enforce controls on \nthe  truck  overloading  subcomponent  (24  person-months  international  and  85  person-months \ndomestic);  (iv)  consultants  to  implement  the  road  safety  awareness  campaigns  (102  person-\nmonths,  domestic);  (v)  consultants  to  develop  new  approaches  to  road  maintenance \nmanagement  (40  person-months \ninternational  and  130  person-months  domestic);  (vi) \nconsultants  for  environmental  and  social  impact  management  capacity  building  (5  persons-\nmonths  international  and  72  person-months  domestic);  and  (vii)  capacity-building  consultants \n(59  person-months  domestic)  to  provide  training  in  project  management  and  engineering \nsupport practices. All consultants to be financed under the loan will be recruited in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, and ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod will be used and the submission of full technical proposal requested. Detailed terms of \nreference are in Appendixes 9\u201315.  \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nDisbursement will be based on an annual expenditure plan for the project activities that \n46. \nwill  be  consolidated  by  the  PMU  and  included  in  DGH\u2019s  budgeted  list  of  projects.  Budget \npreparation  and  consolidation  will  have  inputs  from  defined  levels  in  the  project  management, \nand will be consistent with the overall project procurement plan, which identifies activities to be \nundertaken by each level of project management. \n \n47. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2001). The Project will use direct payments, commitment procedure, and an imprest \naccount.  The  direct  payment  procedure  will  be  used  for  payments  over  $100,000,  and  the \ncommitment procedure for imports over $100,000. All other payments will be channeled through \nthe imprest account to increase flexibility in project disbursement. \n \nThe  initial  advance  to  the  imprest  account  will  be  based  on  approved  contracts  and \n48. \nplanned  expenditures  for  the  first  6  months  of  the  Project.  The  ceiling  on  the  imprest  account \nwill be $1.5 million. The statement of expenditure (SOE) procedure may be used to reimburse \neligible project expenditures and to liquidate or replenish imprest account advances. The SOE \nprocedure  is  applicable  to  individual  payments  not  exceeding  $100,000  equivalent.  Detailed \narrangements to establish the imprest account and SOE procedure will be made in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2001) as amended.  \n \nSufficient  supporting  documentation,  as  defined  in  the  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook, \n49. \nmust be kept at each level of project management to substantiate all expenditures incurred from \n\n \n\n\fthe loan proceeds. Staff at DGH, the PMU, and implementing agencies will be trained in ADB\u2019s \ndisbursement procedures. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n50. \nThe PMU and implementing and other agencies involved in project implementation will \nprepare and maintain accounts exclusively for the Project and will register in such accounts all \nreceipts  and  payments  for  the  Project  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles  and \nprocedures. Annual project accounts will be prepared by one auditing firm acceptable to ADB, \nbased  on  sound  and  acceptable  accounting  principles.  Audited  project  accounts,  audited \nfinancial statements, and the audit opinion must be submitted to ADB within 6 months of the end \nof the financial year and at project completion. The financial statements and the auditor\u2019s report \nwill be in English. The Government and DGH were informed of ADB\u2019s policy on submission of \naudited accounts, which covers failure to submit audited accounts and financial statements on \ntime.  A  formal  warning  will  be  issued  for  accounts  more  than  6  months  overdue,  and \ndisbursements will be suspended for accounts that are 12 months overdue. \n \n51. \nAn audited opinion of the project accounts will reflect (i) an assessment of the adequacy \nof  accounting  and  internal  controls  systems  with  respect  to  project  expenditures  and  other \nfinancial  transactions  and  to  ensuring  the  safe  custody  of  project  financed  assets;  (ii)  a \ndetermination as to whether the Borrower and project implementing agencies have maintained \nadequate  documentation  on  all  relevant  transactions,  including  specific  mention  of  SOE  and \nimprest account transactions; (iii) a confirmation that expenditures submitted to ADB are eligible \nfor  financing  and  identification  of  any  ineligible  expenditures;  and  (iv)  a  confirmation  of \ncompliance  with  financial  loan  covenants  and  ADB  requirements  for  project  management. \nUnder  Indonesian  regulations,  the  Inspectorate  General  has  to  audit  the  Project\u2019s  financial \naccounts and the effectiveness of control mechanisms established within the Project. Copies of \nall such reports will be sent to ADB. \n \n52. \nThe  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  collecting  and  consolidating  all  project  progress \nreports,  site  reports,  technical  and  financial  reports,  and  their  submission  to  ADB;  and  (ii) \npreparing  quarterly  progress  reports,  the  midterm  project  evaluation  report,  and  the  overall \nproject completion report. The quarterly reports will be submitted to ADB within 15 days of the \nend  of  each  quarter  due.  The  implementing  agencies  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  preparing \nmonthly  and  quarterly  project  progress,  technical,  and  financial  reports  covering  site-specific \nactivities;  and  (ii)  collecting  and  consolidating  field  data  and  feedback  from  local  participating \nagencies and contractors that, in turn, will be relayed to the PMU. Implementing agencies and \nthe  PMU  will  do  their  accounting  and  reporting  by  e-mail.  Off-the-shelf  databases  and  other \nsoftware  will  be  used  to  set  up  effective  and  transparent  accounting, monitoring,  and  financial \nreporting  systems.  The  quarterly  reports  submitted  to  ADB  will  be  posted  on  the  Project\u2019s \nwebsite, located as a link within the MPW website. \n \n\n8. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation of Project Performance and Benefits    \n\nDGH, DGLC, and ADB have agreed on a set of indicators to monitor and evaluate the \n53. \nProject\u2019s performance in relation to its expected impact, outcomes, and outputs. The details of \nthe indicators and baseline values will be established by DGH and DGLC, in consultation with \nADB,  and  with  the  assistance  of  the  core  team  of  consultants,  at  least  2  months  before  civil \nworks  begin  in  the  project  provinces.  DGH  will  be  responsible  for  data  on  (i)  average  road \nroughness,  (ii)  classified  traffic  counts,  (iii)  annual  expenditures  on  maintenance  (routine  and \nperiodic) of national roads and bridges, and (iv) social and economic impact indicators. DGLC \n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nwill  also  provide  baseline  data  and  be  responsible  for  (i)  impact  of  the  road  safety  awareness \ncampaign on attitudes toward road and pedestrian safety; (ii) truck axle loads, as measured at \nthe four weighbridges and by WIM monitoring equipment; and (iii) average one-way passenger \nfares  and  freight  transport  rates  for  general  cargo  to  and  from  predetermined  points  on  the \nrehabilitated  road  corridors.  Monitoring  indicators  will  be  measured  each  year  and  for  3  years \nafter project completion. Each assessment will consist of an evaluation of changes that occurred \nin the preceding year. Comments and findings regarding these project indicators will be included \nin the midterm review. The agreed-on list of indicators is in Appendix 16.  \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n54. \nADB  will  carry  out  regular  loan  reviews  and  a  midterm  review  of  the  Project  around \n2008,  as  to  be  agreed  on  between  the  DGH,  the  implementing  agencies,  and  ADB.  This  will \nfocus  on  project  impacts,  particularly  relating  to  institutional,  administrative,  organizational, \ntechnical, environmental, and social aspects. The Project\u2019s economic viability and other aspects \nthat  may  have  an  impact  on  project  performance  will  be  reassessed  during  this  review.  The \nreview  will  also  examine  compliance  with  covenants  specified  in  the  loan  agreement.  The  EA \nand  the  implementing  agencies  will  make  sure that  their staff  visit  the field  frequently  and  join \nADB for all project review missions. \n \n\n10. \n\nAnticorruption Measures \n\n55. \nFollowing  governance  issues  in  2003  under  an  ADB-assisted  project  with  the  then \nDirectorate  General  of  Urban  and  Rural  Development,  of  the  then  Ministry  of  Settlement  and \nRegional  Infrastructure  (MPW  now),  the  Government  and  ADB  jointly  addressed  weaknesses \nand defined remedial actions to improve project implementation. A TA was implemented16 and \nproposed a number of measures to broaden the mandate of the inspector general to make it a \nmore  effective  internal  auditor  instead  of  just  an  auditor  of  the  financial  accounts.  The  TA \nresulted in the signing of an action plan for controlling fraud and corruption between ADB and \nthe directorate. A similar action plan was developed under the Project between ADB and DGH. \nThe  action  plan  targets  the  functioning  of  regional  governments  and  DGH,  but  also  the \nperformance of auditors, consultants, and contractors, as well as ADB\u2019s project implementation. \nRegarding the recruitment of observers for procurement as required by the action plan, ADB will \nguide  DGH  based  on  its  experience  of  Sustainable  Capacity  Building  for  Decentralization \nProject.17  The  attached  action  plan  matrix  (Appendix  17)  summarizes  the  agreement  reached \nbetween ADB and DGH. \n \n56. \nADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to the Government. The policy, together with \nother  ADB  safeguard  policies,  will be  included  in  the  training  provided  to  DGH,  the  PMU,  and \nimplementing  agency  staff.  The  Government  is  committed  to  creating  and  sustaining  a \ncorruption-free  environment,  and  has  agreed  to  abide  by  the  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nanticorruption  policy  during  project  implementation.  A  new  anticorruption  law  gives  the \nGovernment strengthened legal powers of investigation and enforcement in cases of corruption. \nFinally,  provisions  will  be  included  in  all  contracts  to  specify  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  the \naccounts of contractors, suppliers, and service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n                                                 \n16    ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Strengthening the Capacity of the Ministry of \n\nSettlements and Regional Infrastructure to Combat Fraud and Corruption. Manila (TA 3842-INO). \n\n17      ADB.  2002.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  and \nTechnical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Sustainable  Capacity  Building  for \nDecentralization Project. Manila. \n\n \n\n\fFollowing  the  experience  of  the  RRSP,  the  procedures  for  submitting  and  approving \n57. \nwork variation orders have been streamlined in consultation with the Government. Adoption of \ndetailed  design  procedures  instead  of  a  simplified  design  procedure  will  help  reduce  the \nprobability  of  fraud  and  corruption  in  procurement.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  improve \ntransparency and accountability by keeping better records of the procurement process to ensure \ncompliance with procedures. \n \n58. \nPoor-quality  work  as  a  result  of  corruption  is  a  major  issue.  Substantial  emphasis  was \ntherefore  placed  on  improving  quality  control  by  (i)  strengthening  construction  supervision \nthrough specific additional powers and authority to reject defective works and by disapproving \nrelated payment requests, (ii) conducting independent technical audits through the core team of \nconsultants, (iii) training all professional construction supervision staff in quality control aspects \nbefore  their  mobilization,  and  (iv)  promoting  awareness  of  quality  control  at  all  times  during \nimplementation. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n59. \nThe main benefits will be from motorized vehicle through vehicle operating cost savings \nresulting from reduced road roughness and better vehicle running conditions. Road roughness \naffects vehicle speeds and consumption of fuel, oil, and tires. On selected routes, people who \ncurrently travel by river would benefit from the improved roads. The cost difference reflects the \ndiverted traffic benefits and has been included in the economic analysis. \n \n60. \nThe Project will generate nonquantifiable economic and social benefits. Better roads will \nlikely attract additional economic activity and traffic, thus generating benefits to a wider circle of \nbeneficiaries. The incomes and well-being of people living near the roads will rise as a result of \nbetter access to social services, markets, and jobs, especially in agriculture, the main source of \nlivelihood.  \n \n61. \nThe methodology, assumptions, and results of the economic evaluation are summarized \nin Appendix 18. The Project\u2019s overall economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was estimated at \n25.2%.  The  average  EIRR  for  subproject  links  in  Sumatra  (32.4%)  is  higher  than  that  in \nKalimantan  (13.4%)  because  of  higher  levels  of  traffic  in  Sumatra.  However,  nonquantifiable \nbenefits are substantial in Kalimantan. \n \n62. \nThe EIRRs of road links in Sumatra range from 10.3% to 50.2%. The road link in West \nSumatra with the lowest estimated EIRR was still economically and socially justified since it (i) \nwould provide a better access to health care facilities, schools, and markets; and (ii) could help \npromote the region\u2019s industries related to palm oil, thus generating local benefits. \n \n63. \nThe EIRRs of road links in Kalimantan range from 10.4% to 23.6%. The three road links \nin West, Central, and East Kalimantan, with an EIRR of about 10%, were still economically and \nsocially justified as (i) providing vital connections to health care facilities, schools, and markets; \n(ii)  being  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  broader  strategies  for  developing  strategic  corridors  to  link \nkey  population  centers  to  facilitate  trade;  and  (iii)  being  of  strategic  importance  as  part  of  the \ncross-border ASEAN Highway connecting East Kalimantan and Sabah in Malaysia. \n \n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nB. \n\nSocial Dimensions and Poverty Reduction Impacts \n\n1. \n\nPoverty Reduction \n\nThe  Project\u2019s  poverty  reduction  impacts  are  distinctly  different  in  Sumatra  and \n64. \nKalimantan.  The  Sumatra  network  carries  goods  and  people  over  long  distances  between \nSumatra and Java, as well as interregional traffic, and, to a lesser extent, local traffic. The road \nalso facilitates movements of goods between Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. Much of the \ntraffic  flow  is  agricultural  commodities  for  export  coming  from  poor  areas.  The  national  road \nnetwork also delivers processed goods from urban to rural markets in poor areas. In Sumatra, \nthe road network is well established and the Project is intended to prevent further deterioration \nand loss of access. \n \n65. \nIn  Kalimantan,  where  the  road  network  is  still  limited  and  where  trade  is  largely \nconducted  along  riverways,  upgrading  the  national  road  system  will  promote  interregional \nlinkages, and provide an alternate mode of transportation for poor and remote communities. A \nshift  from  river-  to  road-based  transport  will  reduce  costs,  promotes  year-round  access,  and \nincreases  the  potential  for  small-  and  medium-scale  entrepreneurs  to  make  use  of  the  area\u2019s \nnatural  resources.  Improved  road  access  will  facilitate  government  administration  and  social \nservice delivery. \n \n66. \nConstruction  will  create  temporary  jobs,  and  routine  maintenance  will  employ  unskilled \nand  semiskilled  workers.  Women  will  be  encouraged  to  work  and  be  treated  equitably.  A \nsummary poverty reduction and social analysis is in Appendix 19. \n \n\n2. \n\nSafety, Health, and Gender Concerns \n\n67. \nThe  Project  will  have  few  adverse  social  impacts.  ADB  and  the  Government  have \nagreed  that  the  Project  should  have  an  HIV/AIDS18  prevention  initiative  targeting  construction \nworkers and the people they interact with, specifically addressing the disproportionate impact of \nHIV/AIDS on women, who are more vulnerable than men. The Project will involve about 30,000 \npeople,  mostly  young  men  from  Java,  coming  to  live  in  base  camps  along  the  approximately \n1,300  km  project  corridors.  Because  of  extraordinarily  low  levels  of  condom  use  among \nIndonesian men, the risk of spreading HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) \nto  workers  and  into  local  communities  is  high.  The  Government  is  undertaking  HIV/AIDS \nawareness  campaigns  through  programs  targeting  groups  at  risk.  To  mitigate  these  risks, \nconstruction  contracts  will  require  contractors  to  allow  their  workers  to  attend  education \nsessions  where  materials  such  as  condoms  and  awareness  brochures  will  be  distributed.  An \nHIV/AIDS  prevention  initiative  through  a  TA  independent  of  this  loan  is  under  processing, \nincluding  two  relevant  components:  (i)  information  and  education  campaigns  to  prevent \nHIV/AIDS and STDs for workers and communities surrounding the project base camps, and (ii) \ncapacity  building  of  local  HIV/AIDS  civil-society  institutions.  The  TA  will  work  with  other \ninitiatives  such  as  those  financed  by  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development \n(USAID)  and  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID),  focusing  on  sex \nworkers and preventing human trafficking. \n \n\n                                                 \n18  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement  \n\n68. \nProject  road  alignments  follow  the  existing  centerline  and  remain  within  the  existing \nrights-of-way. Pavement and shoulder widening will remain within the existing right-of-way in all \ncases. Surveys determined that the Project would not require land acquisition or resettlement or \nharm adjacent property, or religious, cultural, or historical sites. However, in the unlikely event \nthat minor land acquisition might be necessary following detailed design, DGH has prepared the \nCompensation Policy Framework and Procedure Guidelines (CPFPG) to codify procedures for \nverifying  road  works  impacts,  deciding  compensation  eligibility  and  entitlements,  undertaking \nand  monitoring  resettlement  and  compensation,  and  providing  redress  for  complaints  or \ngrievances.  In  case  of  discrepancies  between  the  Government\u2019s  laws,  regulations  and \nprocedures, and ADB\u2019s requirements, or if there is an omission in CPFPG or a discrepancy with \nthe ADB\u2019s requirements, then DGH and ADB will agree upon a resolution. \n \n\n4. \n\nIndigenous Peoples\u2019 Policy \n\nSome roads in Kalimantan will cross areas inhabited by indigenous peoples, who should \n69. \nnot be affected as project road alignments remain within existing rights-of-way. If  minimal and \nscattered  impacts  arise  from  detail  design  modifications  and  if,  after  review,  ADB  decides  to \nproceed  with  the  planned  improvement  activities,  project-affected  indigenous  peoples  will  be \ncompensated under the CPFPG. No systemic socioeconomic or cultural impact on indigenous \npeoples  that  would  trigger  the  preparation  of  indigenous  peoples  development  plans  is \nforeseen. Consultations with indigenous peoples indicate that they do not consider the expected \nrise  in  economic  activity  or  traffic  an  issue  of  conflict  or  competition  that  would  require \nmitigation. \n \nC. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nThe Project is classified under environmental category B (sensitive). Initial environmental \n70. \nexaminations  (IEEs),  public  consultations,  and  summary  IEE  reports  have  been  prepared  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s environment policy and  Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). \nThe IEEs indicate no major adverse environmental impacts. The Project involves rehabilitating \nexisting  roads  on  existing  alignments  and  within  existing  rights-of-way,  with  no  additional  land \nacquisition.  The  summary  IEE  was  posted  on  ADB\u2019s  website  in  June  2004.  Potential  adverse \nimpacts  are  minor,  localized,  and  temporary,  and  will  receive  mitigation  and  monitoring  under \nthe Project. \n \n71. \nADB  shares  the  Government\u2019s  concern  regarding  illegal  logging.  During  the  feasibility \nstudy,  impacts  of  road  rehabilitation  on  protected  areas  and  on  forests  were  analyzed.  For \nprotected areas, the analysis concluded that buffer zones were sufficient to protect rare habitats \nand that adequate management controls were in place. The study concluded that there would \nbe  no  significant  adverse  impacts  on  protected  areas,  specifically  the  Rimbo  Panti  nature \nreserve in West Sumatra.  \n \nAs  there  are  no  productive  forest  and  commercial  logging  operations  in  the  project \n72. \nareas, two scenarios for illegal logging are possible: (i) local, small-scale felling and utilization of \ntimber,  to  build  houses,  with  no  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts;  and  (ii)  local \nexploitation of timber for small-scale commercial purposes, possibly in West Kalimantan. \n \n73. \nBased  on  the  field  observations  as  well  as  discussions  with  local  forest  management \nauthorities and legal loggers, the Project was determined to have little or no impact on the scale \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nor intensity of illegal logging. Rather, the rehabilitation of road links will make forest patrol easier \nand more efficient, improving control over illegal activities.  \n \n74. \nThe Project\u2019s environmental mitigation measures may include (i) slope stabilization and \nprotection to reduce the risk of failure and to protect watercourses; (ii) protection from landslides \nby retaining structures; (iii) proper drainage,19 with cross-falls in each pavement layer and cross- \nand  side-drains  designed  to  cope  with  expected  flows;  (iv)  preservation  of  protected  areas \nthrough road signs, roadside warnings, and protective fencing; (v) incorporating safety features \nin  engineering  designs;  (vi)  protecting  communities  from  project  activities  through  close \nconsultation  with  community  leaders  and  those  affected,  providing  advance  notice  of \nconstruction schedules, and adopting a code of conduct for worker behavior; and (vii) recycling \nconstruction materials, e.g., by using reclaimed asphalt in cold mixes or aggregates in surface \nmaterial.  In  addition  to  cost  savings,  positive  environmental  impacts  will  be  reduced  need  for \nquarrying, reduced dumping of waste, and reduced impact on air quality. \n \nD. \n\nProject Risks \n\nThe main risks to the Project and the measures taken to minimize them are presented in \n\n75. \nTable 3. \n\nTable 3: Perceived Risks and Mitigation Measures  \n\n \nProject Risk \nGovernment fails to provide counterpart \nfunds \nBid costs are higher than estimates \n\nDGH fails to maintain the project roads \nonce rehabilitated \n\nRisk of spread of STDs and HIV/AIDS \n\nEnvironmental damage during or after \nconstruction \nProject is not implemented in the \nprojected 54 months  \n\nCorruption in project implementation, \nparticularly in procurement \nCorruption in road management, \nparticularly in enforcing regulations on \ntruck overloading \nTruck overloading \n\nMeasures Taken to Minimize Risk \n\nRelated covenant \n \nThe preliminary designs for first-year program to be reviewed \nduring detailed design before contract bidding \nConsultants will be appointed to help strengthen maintenance \nplanning, funding, and implementation.  \nThe Government will assure availability of adequate funds. \nContractors will be required to adopt strict controls over \nworkers\u2019 conduct.

The base case reflects expected conditions in the absence of the Project, \nwith  maintenance  sufficient  only  to  hold  the  road  in  its  present  condition.  The  project  case \ninvolves initial rehabilitation followed by routine and periodic maintenance, but with expenditure \nand frequency of periodic maintenance economically optimum for predicted road conditions and \ntraffic flows. \n \n2. \nThe analysis was conducted by using the integrated road management system (IRMS), \ndeveloped by the Directorate General of Infrastructure (DGH), which was basically derived from \nthe highway design module (HDM) relationships calibrated for Indonesian conditions. The IRMS \neconomic  review  module  (ERM)  produced  predicted  traffic  flow,  classified  vehicle  operating \ncosts  (VOC)  in  economic  prices,  predicted  average  travel  speed,  predicted  pavement \nroughness,  agency  costs,  and  road  user  costs.  ERM  also  calculated  the  economic  viability  of \nthe road links. The ERM output was modified to accommodate estimated non-VOC savings. \n \n3. \nIRMS contains comprehensive inventories and databases of road and bridge conditions. \nDuring project preparation, data such as road inventory, condition, and traffic were reviewed by \nfield surveys and adjusted where necessary to reflect the real situation. All costs and benefits \nwere  expressed  in  constant  mid  2005  prices.  The  economic  analysis  covers  the  construction \nperiod of 2006\u20132010 plus 20 years of operation and maintenance. \n \n4. \nEconomic  analysis  was  conducted  using  domestic  prices.  A  standard  exchange  rate \nfactor  (SERF)  of  1.0131  was  applied  to  calculate  the  economic  price  of  tradable  goods.  The \nshadow wage rates for skilled and unskilled labor were estimated at 0.95 and 0.6, respectively. \nThe  shadow  wage  rate  factors  were  estimated  by  comparing  the  average  labor  wage  in  the \nregion and the project labor wage, taking into consideration the existing unemployment rate. \n \nB. \n\nTraffic Forecasts \n\n5. \nThe  standard  4-stage  inter-regional  transport  demand  model  for  the  Transport  Sector \nStrategy Study (TSSS)2 validated traffic forecasts produced by IRMS. The estimated base-year \nannual average daily traffic (AADT) for each link is presented in the Table A18.2.   \n\n \n6. \nIRMS predicted the future traffic flow for each link using different traffic growth rates for \nevery province over the 20-year planning horizon. The average traffic growth rates vary from 3 \nto 9% per year for roads in Sumatra and 3 to 5% per year for roads in Kalimantan. \n \n\n                                                 \n \n1   A simple trade-weight formula was used to estimate the standard exchange rate factor (SERF) using the 2003 net \ninternational trade taxes and total trade data for Indonesia. As the SERF may be too low, the sensitivity analysis \nwill test other values. \n\n2   ADB. 2000. The Transport Sector Strategy Study for Indonesia. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 18 \n\n53 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nC. \n\nCosts \n\n7. \nProject costs include road rehabilitation and maintenance. IRMS holds information on a \nbase set of unit costs for a detailed list of work items, together with provincial factors applicable \nto each item to account for regional differences in unit rates. The unit costs assembled over a \nperiod and used in DGH\u2019s planning, programming, and budgeting were reviewed during project \npreparation and adjusted with relevant provincial cost factors. \n \nThe  economic  costs  were  estimated  based  on  financial  costs  including  physical \n8. \ncontingencies.  Price  escalation  contingencies,  interest  during  construction,  and  taxes  were \nexcluded. Financial costs were converted into economic costs using a specific conversion factor \nfor civil works of 0.97.3 \n \nD. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n1. \n\nDescription of the Project Benefits \n\n9. \nThe  main  user  benefits  are  in  the  form  of  VOC  savings  resulting  from  reduced  road \nroughness  and  better  vehicle  running  conditions.  Road  roughness  affects  vehicle  speeds  and \nconsumption  of  fuel,  oil,  and  tires.  People  who  currently  travel  by  river  would  benefit  from  the \nimproved  road.  The  cost  difference  of  traveling  by  river  and  road  reflects  the  diverted  traffic \nbenefits. These savings to diverted traffic have also been included in the benefit stream. \n \n10. \nThe  Project  will  generate  nonquantifiable  economic  and  social  benefits.  Better  road \nconditions  would  likely  attract  additional  economic  activity  and  more  traffic,  spreading  benefits \namong  a  wider  group.  Generated  traffic  was  considered  for  selected  links  serving  relatively \nundeveloped  areas  with  the  potential  for  attracting  development.  Additional  income  is  also \nexpected for people living near the roads because of better access to markets and jobs. \n \n11. \nThe  Project  will  provide  better  support  for  agriculture,  the  most  important  source  of \nlivelihood for the population living along the road. It would also perform a critical role in providing \nbetter access to public and social services. \n \n\n2. \n\nVehicle Operating Cost Savings \n\n12. \nVOC  savings  for  normal  traffic  in  economic  prices  were  calculated  by  using  ERM. \nNormal  traffic  was  assumed  to  constitute  the  main  category  of  user  benefits  for  the  well-\nestablished routes in Sumatra and Kalimantan proposed for rehabilitation under the Project. For \nthese  links,  rehabilitation  represents  an  intervention  in  the  normal  pattern  of  deterioration  and \nrepair. In their absence, the road will continue to operate satisfactorily, albeit at a reduced level \nof service. \n \nVOC,  calculated  for  each  of  ten  classes  of  vehicles,4  varies  with  the  road  roughness \n13. \nmeasured  in  international  roughness  index  (IRI)  units,  which  depends  on  the  pattern  of \npavement  deterioration,  pavement  strength,  traffic  load,  and  maintenance.  It  affects  vehicle \nspeed and consumption of fuel, oil, and tires.  \n                                                 \n \n3  The road work costs were broken down into the following categories: 34% tradable goods, 44% nontradable goods, \n\n16% skilled labor, and 6% unskilled labor.  \n\n4   Passenger cars, light passenger vehicle, light goods vehicle, small buses, large buses, light trucks, medium trucks, \n\nheavy trucks, articulated trucks, and motorcycles. \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 18 \n\n3. \n\nDiverted Traffic Benefits \n\n14. \nThe river systems constitute the main transport arteries in West and Central Kalimantan. \nThey  run  east-to-west  in  West  Kalimantan  (to  the  port  at  Ketapang  and  then  by  sea  to \nPontianak or Java) and north-to-south in Central Kalimantan (to Pangkalanbun) and are mostly \nperpendicular  to  the  proposed  road  subproject  links.  Most  settlements  are  along  the  river \ncourses. The roads are relatively new and have not yet attracted significant development other \nthan  rubber  plantations  in  West  Kalimantan,  and  oil  palm  plantations  in  Central  Kalimantan. \nWhen  the  road  is  improved,  it  will  cut  the  average  transport  time  from  Balaiberkuak  and  Aur \nKuning  to  Tayan  (West  Kalimantan)  by  up  to  75%  and  from  Kudangan  to  Simpang  Runtu \n(Central Kalimantan) by up to 45%. This will help increase the availability of road transport and \nattract traffic that otherwise would have continued to travel by river. \n \n15. \nTransport  cost  savings  between  road  and  river  were  used  in  estimating  the  annual \nbenefits accruing to diverted traffic in West and East Kalimantan, respectively. The costs of the \nriver transport were estimated from the responses of individuals interviewed in the social impact \nsurveys.  The  estimated  costs  by  road  are  based  on  the  VOC  calculated  by  IRMS,  while  the \nnumber  of  households  affected  was  estimated  from  village  census  data.  The  river  transport \ncosts were not shadow priced since most of the cost components were non-tradable goods. \n \nThe benefits associated with diverted traffic to isolated communities are only significant \n16. \nfor the links in West and Central Kalimantan for which they are assumed to apply (Table A18.1). \n \n\nTable A18.1: Composition of Benefits for Isolated Links in West and Central Kalimantan \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLink    \n \n \n  \n  \n079-1 Tayan-Teraju \n079-2 Teraju-Balaiberkuak \n079-3 Balaiberkuak-Aur Kuning \n\nProvince \n \n  \n30-West Kalimantan \n \n  \n32-Central Kalimantan  024-1 Runtu-Simpang Runtu \n \n \n  \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n024-2 Kujan-Runtu \n024-3 Penopa-Kujan \n024-4 Kudangan-Penopa \n\nE. \n\nResults of Economic Evaluation \n\nProportion of Benefits (%) \nSavings to \nSavings to \n\nNormal Traffic  Diverted Traffic\n\n 25 \n 59 \n 80 \n 43 \n 84 \n 92 \n100 \n\n 75 \n 41 \n 20 \n 57 \n 16 \n  8 \n  0 \n\nThe economic evaluation produced an overall project\u2019s economic internal rate of return \n17. \n(EIRR) of 25.2% (Table A18.3). As expected, the average EIRR for subproject links in Sumatra \n(32.4%) is higher than that in Kalimantan (13.4%) because of its higher traffic level. \n \nAt  disaggregate  level,  the  EIRRs  of  road  links  in  Sumatra  range  from  10.3  to  50.2%. \n18. \nEIRR  of  one  road  link  subproject  in  West  Sumatra  estimated  at  about  10%  was  economically \njustified since it (i) would provide a better access to social services such as health care centers, \nschools,  and  markets;  and  (ii)  could  contribute  to  promoting  palm-oil-related  industries  in  the \nregion and provide local benefits to the rest of society.  \n \n19. \nThe EIRRs of road links subprojects in Kalimantan varied from 10.4 to 23.6%. EIRRs of \nthree road subprojects in West, Central, and East Kalimantan that were estimated at about 10% \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 18 \n\n55 \n\n \n\n \n\nwere economically justified since they (i) would provide vital connectivity to health care centers, \nschools, and markets; (ii) are part of the Government\u2019s broader strategy of developing strategic \ncorridors to link key population centers to facilitate trade; and (iii) are strategically important to \nthe  cross-border  and  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  Highways  connecting \nEast Kalimantan and Sabah in Malaysia.  \n \nF. \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\nA  sensitivity  analysis  was  carried  out  to  test  the  impact  of changes  on  key  parameters \n20. \ndetermining  project  costs  and  benefits.  The  switching  values  for  the  road  construction  and \nmaintenance  costs  (road  agency  costs)  and  traffic  volume  are  2.4  and  0.4,  respectively.  The \noverall  EIRR  will  decline  from  26.2  to  the  cutoff  level  of  12%  when  either  the  agency  costs \nincrease by about 2.4 times or the traffic level reduces by about 0.4 times of the current level. \nThis condition seems unlikely to happen.   \n \n21. \nGiven  that  the  EIRRs  are  greatly  varied  across  subproject  links  it  is  worth  looking  into \nthe impact of the various cost and traffic level on the economic feasibility of subproject links in \nKalimantan and Sumatra. \n \n22. \nThe road agency cost increase of 10% in Kalimantan will reduce the average EIRR from \n13.5 to 12.1% for all subprojects in Kalimantan. Meanwhile, the average decrease in traffic by \n10%  would  bring  down  the  average  EIRR  from  13.5  to  12%  for  overall  subprojects  in \nKalimantan.  The road agency cost increase of 10% or traffic level decrease of 10% would bring \ndown the EIRR of three subproject links to about 10%. \n \n23. \nEither the road agency cost increase of 10% or traffic level decrease of 10% in Sumatra \nwould  bring  down  the  average  EIRR  from  32.4  to  30.2%  for  all  subprojects  in  Sumatra.  \nHowever,  either  the  road  agency  cost  increase  of  10%  or  traffic  level  decrease  of  10%  would \nbring down the EIRR of two subproject links in West Sumatra to about 10%. \n \n24. \nA sensitivity test was also conducted to assess the impact of different SERF values on \nthe overall EIRR. SERF values of 1.10 and 1.15 were introduced in the economic analysis and \nbrought down the overall EIRR from 25.2 to 24.6% and 24.3%, respectively. This test resulted in \nthe average EIRR of more than 12% for all subprojects in Kalimantan and Sumatra. \n \n25. \ncost, traffic, and SERF scenarios. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe sensitivity test concluded that the Project is still economically justified under various \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 18 \n\nTable A18.2: Results of the Economic Evaluation \n\nNo\n\nProvince\n\nLink\n\nRoad Link\n\nEst. 2004\nAADT\n\n09 Riau\n\n11 Jambi\n\n17 Lampung\n\n06 West Sumatra\n\n03 North Sumatra\n\n15 South Sumatra\n\nPadangsidempuan-Border of Tapanuli\nSimpang Kawat-Border of Labuhan Batu\nBorder of Labuhan Batu-Rantau Prapat\nRantau Prapat-Aek Nabara\nBukittinggi-Kumpulan\nLubuksikaping-Panti\nPanti-Border of Sumut\nKiliranjau-Sei Dareh\nSei Dareh-Junction\nSimpang Batang-Simpang Balam\nBagan Batu-Simpang Balam\nMuaratembesi-Border of Sarko\n\n019-1\n057-1\n057-2\n058\n029\n030\n032\n051\n052\n019-1\n019-2\n011-1\n011-2,3 Border of Sarko-Sorolangun\n010\n011\n013\n014\n002\n003\n004\n079-1\n079-2\n079-3\n32 Central Kalimantan 010-2\n024-1\n024-2\n024-3\n024-4\n026-4\n035\n036\n039-1\n039-2\n047-1\n047-2\n\nTerawas-Lubuk Linggau\nMuara Enim-Sugin Waras\nBaturaja-Martapura\nMartapura-Border of Lampung\nGunung Sugih-Tegineneng\nGunung Sugih-Terbanggi\nTerbanggi-Kotabumi\nTayan-Teraju\nTeraju-Balaiberkuak\nBalaiberkuak-Aur Kuning\nKilometer 65-Sampit\nRuntu-Simpang Runtu\nKujan-Runtu\nPenopa-Kujan\nKudangan-Penopa\nSimpang Batu Ampar-Simpang Batu Perdau\nSebamban-Pagatan\nPagatan-Batulicin\nKintab-Ds Sungai Cuka (Border of Kotabaru)\nDesa Sungai Cuka-Sebamban\nSeikupang-Magalau\nMagalau-Border of Kaltim\n\n34 East Kalimantan\n36 South Kalimantan\n\n30 West Kalimantan\n\nEIRR\n(% p.a.)\n34.7\n34.2\n49.9\n18.3\n10.9\n13.1\n10.3\n21.4\n16.3\n44.5\n42.4\n17.2\n25.8\n25.5\n47.3\n43.6\n41.3\n47.3\n32.0\n14.1\n22.3\n10.6\n11.8\n22.3\n23.6\n20.2\n10.6\n12.5\n10.4\n11.3\n15.9\n14.1\n11.7\n15.4\n12.5\n\n1,132\n4,600\n4,853\n3,804\n2,671\n3,323\n1,806\n4,301\n3,869\n9,394\n7,021\n1,164\n1,173\n2,817\n5,860\n4,512\n4,597\n12,350\n11,909\n8,499\n197\n188\n192\n1,217\n640\n571\n344\n271\n352\n3,758\n4,259\n2,779\n2,779\n1,454\n1,454\n\nNPV\n(12% p.a.)\n177,051\n125,866\n332,106\n28,554\n(4,669)\n2,466\n(4,882)\n22,294\n4,278\n351,637\n163,932\n6,970\n36,362\n71,022\n238,092\n115,853\n29,017\n94,700\n32,282\n5,443\n8,299\n(2,984)\n(513)\n14,767\n14,353\n31,382\n(8,261)\n2,166\n(16,256)\n(1,657)\n9,975\n2,842\n(716)\n8,129\n1,297\n\nAADT= annual average daily traffic, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, est. = estimate, NPV = net present value,\np.a = per annum.\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\n\n   \n                                                  Table A18.3: Summary \n \n\n \n\n \n\nItem \n\nEIRR (%) \n\nNPV (Rp million) at 12% p.a.  \n\nAll shortlisted projects: \n\nSumatra \n\nKalimantan \n\nAll Links \n\n32.4 \n\n13.4 \n\n25.2 \n\n \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, mln = million, NPV = net present value, p.a. = per annum. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n1,838,096  \n\n62,823  \n\n1,900,919  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 18 \n\n57 \n\n \n\n \n\nG. \n\nNonquantifiable Benefits \n\nlinks \n\nInduced  Development.  For  selected \n\n26. \nin  West  Kalimantan  (Tayan-Teraju-\nBalaiberkuak-Aur  Kuning)  and  Central  Kalimantan  (Simpang  Runtu-Runtu-Kujan-Penopa-\nKudangan)  serving  relatively  undeveloped  areas,  road  rehabilitation  will  result  in  a  more \nsignificant  change  in  road  conditions  and  reliability  of  transport  services.  This  might  attract \ninward investment and migration and generate additional traffic.  \n \nIncome  Growth.  In  relatively  undeveloped  areas  of  Kalimantan  with  poor  access  to \n27. \nmarkets, jobs, and government services, longer-term income and welfare gains will result from \nimproved access. These are in addition to the direct savings to normal and generated traffic and \narise largely from improvements in the range and quality of the opportunities available at the trip \ndestination. These are difficult to measure, but evidence showed a strong relationship between \nhousehold expenditure and access to opportunities available at provincial centers.  \n \nSupport  to  Agriculture.  The  road  networks  provide  support  to  agriculture,  the  most \n28. \nimportant  source  of  livelihood  for  people  living  along  the  roads.  In  most  of  Sumatra  and \nKalimantan,  farmers  are  self-employed  small-holders  involved  in  cash  crops  such  as  coffee, \ncoconuts, and rubber. Road quality therefore  has a direct impact on  household income. Good \nroads  reduce  transportation  costs  and  improve  access  to  markets,  increase  competition,  and \nraise  farm-gate  prices.  Poor  roads  also  lead  to  higher  prices  for  consumer  goods  and  lower \npurchasing power. \n\n \n\nImprove Access to Social Services. The road network also performs a critical role in \n29. \nallowing  access  to  many  public  and  social  services  in  both  Sumatra  and  Kalimantan.  For \nexample, junior high school students from 27 out of 130 villages located around the Sidempuan-\nBts.  Tapanuli  road  link  travel  10\u201330  kilometers  to  their  school.  Senior  high  school  students \ntravel 10-20 kilometers to reach their school. Assuming that 20% of all junior and 50% of senior \nhigh  school  students  travel  significant  distances  on  the  national  road  to  go  to  school,  the \nproposed road links provide better school access for more than 10,000 junior and 16,000 senior \nhigh school students. \n \nThe proposed road links also facilitate access to medical services. Access to polyclinics \n30. \nand  health  centers  involves  road  travel  in  Sumatra  and  slow  and  expensive  river  travel  in \nKalimantan.  For  around  half  of  the  Sungai  Loban  subdistrict  population,  located  along  the \nPagatan-Batulicin  link  in  Kalimantan,  the  nearest  hospital  and/or  modern  maternity  service  is \nmore than 20 kilometers away. For many households living on the Teraju-Balaiberkuak road link \nin Kalimantan, hospitals are more than 100 kilometers away. Village heads in this area describe \ntravel to medical facilities as very difficult. The journey to Sanggau includes a ferry crossing of \nthe  Kapuas  River  without  reliable  connecting  transport.  All-weather,  surfaced  roads  are \nessential in maintaining access to health facilities.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 19 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n\nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Indonesia: \n \nIndonesia\u2019s poverty incidence was about 23% (about 48 million people) in 1998, then declined to about 18% (about 38 \nmillion) in 2002, according to the National Socioeconomic Survey (BPS SUSENAS).1 Regional variations are sharp: \npoverty is more common in rural areas than in urban centers, and in the project area, it varies from 18% in Riau to \n42% in South Sumatra, and 30% in South Kalimantan to 57% in Central Kalimantan. \n \nRural local surplus and urban consumer goods are hauled on national roads. National roads are the arteries of trade \nand commerce and enable the economy of the poor to grow.  Agriculture products result from the labor of the poor \nwho themselves rely on basic commodities hauled in from cities.  The Indonesia Poverty Assessment2 notes that \nincreasing the productivity of agriculture requires improved infrastructure including transport, which will reduce \nregional disparity and rural poverty over the medium term. The transportation sector itself also provides a step up and \nout of the grinding poverty of farm labor. Adequate infrastructure is an underpinning to the success and expansion of \nsmall and medium enterprises with their deep backward linkages to the goods and services provided by the poor. \nNational infrastructure is also important to breaking relative isolation and promoting delivery of government \nadministration and social services.  The Government White Paper3 identifies the infrastructure backlog as a key \nbottleneck to poverty reduction. \n\n \n\n \n\nTargeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe Project\u2019s poverty reduction impacts are distinctly different in Sumatra and Kalimantan. The Sumatra network \ncarries goods and people over long distances between Sumatra and Java, as well as interregional traffic, and, to a \nlesser extent, local traffic. The road also facilitates movements of goods between Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. \nMuch of the traffic flow is agricultural commodities for export coming from poor areas. The national road network also \ndelivers processed goods from urban to rural markets in poor areas. \n \nIn Sumatra, the road network is well established and the Project is intended to prevent further deterioration and loss of \naccess. In Kalimantan, where the road network is still limited and where trade is largely conducted along riverways, \nupgrading the national road system will promote interregional linkages, and provide an alternate mode of \ntransportation for poor and remote communities. In both Sumatra and Kalimantan, the poverty reduction impact lies in \nreducing vulnerability to poverty and removing lack of access as a binding constraint for regional economic activities \nthat is essential in fueling economic growth. The Trans-Sumatra and Trans-Kalimantan corridors are not exceptionally \npoor. The road networks also provide access to support the agriculture sector which is the most important source of \nlivelihood. In most of Sumatra and Kalimantan, farmers are self-employed small-holders involved in estate crops.  \nGood roads reduce transportation costs and improve access to market, competition, and higher farm gate prices. The \ncondition of the road also has an impact on household expenditures.  Poor road quality leads to higher prices of \nconsumption goods and lower purchasing power. A shift from river to road based transport reduces costs, promotes \nyear-round access, and increases the potential for small and medium scale entrepreneurs to make use of the natural \nresource potential of the area.  Similarly, improved road access facilitates delivery of government administrative and \nsocial services.  \n \nThe road network provides access to essential public and social services. Roughly 20% of all junior secondary and \n50% of senior secondary students in the corridors use the national road to go to school, the proposed road links \nprotect the access of more than 10,000 junior secondary and 16,000 senior secondary students. An all-weather \nsurfaced roads is essential in enabling residents to reach polyclinics and health centers that are generally located in \nsubdistrict capitals. It is also critical in achieving the Millennium Development Goal targets to reduce infant and child \nand maternal mortality among the nearly 93,000 children under five and more than 100,000 women with potential \nhigh-risk pregnancies living along the road links. \n \n                                                 \n \n1  Excludes Papua and Aceh. \n2  November 2000. \n3  INPRES 5/2003.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 19 \n\n59 \n\n \nC.
