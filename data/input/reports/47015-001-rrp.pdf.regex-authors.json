THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Sustainable Energy Sector Reform Program; and (ii) a proposed \npolicy-based loan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for subprogram 1 of the Sustainable \nEnergy Sector Reform Program. \n \n2.  The  proposed  program  aims  to  support  the  2013  National  Power  Policy  of  the \nGovernment of Pakistan to make the energy sector affordable, reliable, sustainable, and secure \nto support the country\u2019s economic growth.1 The government approved the power policy with the \ngoal of alleviating the chronic energy crisis that has crippled the industries and caused social \nunrest. The government agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), under the extended \nfund facility (EFF), to reduce the energy sector's burden on the annual state budget and its \nnegative impact on economic growth.2 The government has met the requirements for the first \nand second IMF reviews.3 The program is fully coordinated with the EFF. Based on the findings \nand lessons from previous interventions, the government needs support to realize and sustain \nthe reforms set out in the power policy.  \n \n3.  The proposed program takes a chronological approach over 5 years, with a subprogram \ntargeted for each year and matched to the annual budget schedule. Long-term engagement is \nnecessary  because  the  reforms  are  multidimensional  and  through  their  cumulative  effect, \nrequire a number of years to yield optimal results. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale  \n4.   Pakistan\u2019s economic growth slowed markedly in 2013, resulting in a 5-year average of \n3%, which is well below the 7% annual growth necessary for sufficient employment creation to \nabsorb the new entrants into the labor force. The chronic power shortage is estimated to have \nslowed gross domestic product (GDP) growth by at least 2 percentage points per year and is \ndeemed to be the major cause of a decline in large-scale manufacturing, which grew by just \n1.2% in 2012 and 2.8% in 2013. Without reliable power, factories are not able to deliver orders \non time and have lost contracts. Textile exports, which account for more than 50% of goods \nexport receipts, have only increased marginally since 2010. The steady deterioration of power \navailability has also hurt business confidence. Private investment has decreased by 7.5% since \n2008. Power sector subsidies remain high at 1.8% of GDP, or $3.8 billion, despite a 160% \nincrease in power tariffs since 2008.4 Power sector subsidies combined with low tax revenues \nare a significant contributor to the government\u2019s weak fiscal position. High fiscal deficits (8% of \nGDP in FY2013) led to more government borrowing, mainly from the domestic banking system, \nand  elevated  public  debt  (62.7%  of GDP  in  FY2013). The  Fiscal  Responsibility  and  Debt \nLimitation Act 2005 requires the government to reduce the public debt-to-GDP ratio to 60% by \nJune 2013 (i.e., the end of FY2013) and maintain that ratio at below 60% from July 2013 \n                                                \n1  On 27 July 2013, the Council of Common Interests approved the National Power Policy to support current and \nfuture energy needs of the country. http://www.ppib.gov.pk/National%20Power%20Policy%202013.pdf \n2  On 4 September 2013, the International Monetary Fund board approved a $6.7 billion, 36-month program under the \nEFF that aims to bring down inflation and reduce the fiscal deficit to more sustainable levels. \n  http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2013/cr13287.pdf \n3  The first review was completed on 8 November 2013; the second review was completed on 10 February 2014. \nhttp://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2014/cr1401.pdf,  https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2014/cr1490.pdf \n4  The average tariff increased from PRs4.26 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) to PRs8.81 per kWh in May 2012, and further to \nPRs11.11 per kWh in October 2013. In the same period, the consumer price index rose by 96%. ", "2 \nonward. The public debt-to-GDP ratio was 62.7% in FY2013, mainly owing to the actual deficit \nbeing higher than projected.5 The government expects that the ratio will be 61.4% for FY2014 \nand will take measures to maintain it below 60% from FY2015 onwards.6 The continued pursuit \nof tax and structural reforms to achieve fiscal consolidation, underpinned by the IMF program \nand support from ADB and other development partners, is expected to strengthen the fiscal \nposition. Fiscal performance was on track in the second quarter of FY2014.7 With strong fiscal \nadjustment, public debt is expected to decline gradually (footnote 6). \n \n5.  Reforms in Pakistan\u2019s power sector have been ongoing since 1992. However, the pace \nhas been slow and the expected efficiencies have yet to materialize. The unbundling and \ncorporatization  of  the  Water  and  Power  Development  Authority  into  nine  regional  power \ndistribution  companies  (DISCOs),  four  thermal  power  generation  companies  (GENCOs),  a \ntransmission company licensed as a single buyer and seller of electricity, and the hydropower \nplants still retained by the Water and Power Development Authority was accomplished, but all \nentities are still fully owned by the government. Karachi Electric Supply Company has been \nprivatized. Privately owned independent power producers (IPPs) generate 56% of the country\u2019s \npower. The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) determines tariffs, issues \nlicenses, and regulates the sector. Around two-thirds of the population has access to grid \nelectricity. The consumption of electricity has remained constrained and relatively static at about \n70 terawatts  per year since 2007. The key issues are described below.  \n \n6.  Tariffs and subsidies. The government does not pass on the total cost to the electricity \ncustomers and provides subsidies to the DISCOs for the difference between the tariff billed to \nthe customers and the cost-recovery tariff determined by NEPRA. The country\u2019s dwindling \nnatural gas reserves  and  stagnant  hydropower generation  capacity, which  used to  be the \nprimary  sources  of  electricity,  have  resulted  in  greater  use  of  imported  fuel  oil.8 Power \ngeneration  costs  have  increased  significantly  due  to  higher  reliance  on  imported  fuel  oil, \nincreasing  the  demand\u2013supply  gap  to  one-third  of  demand  in  2013,  and  worsening  the \nshortage.  Strong  efforts  are  needed  to  increase  domestic  gas  supply,  explore  the  sizable \ndomestic coalfields, and develop hydropower, which all will help lower power generation costs.   \n \n7.  The difference between the customer tariff and the cost-recovery tariff, and the delay in \ndetermining  and  applying  the  cost-recovery  tariff  and  paying  the  subsidies  have  led  to \n(i) substantial and costly payment arrears to fuel suppliers and IPPs; (ii) decreased efficiency \ndue to lack of funds for maintenance and augmentation of equipment; (iii) critically low working \ncapital of the public and private sectors, leading to payment arrears; and (iv) concerns by \nprivate investors and their financiers about the creditworthiness of the power sector. \n \n8.  Sector performance and private sector participation. In 2012, electricity distribution \nand transmission losses reached 23% and collection amounted to 86% of total billing, compared \nwith NEPRA\u2019s targets for losses (16%) and collection (100%). Gas distribution losses totaled \n11% against 4.5% allowed by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority. Public companies dominate \nthe energy sector and losses in efficiency have remained largely unchanged since 2008.

Statement at  the  Conclusion  of  an  IMF  Staff  Mission on  Pakistan.  Press  Release  No.  14/46, \nWashington, DC. \n8  Hydropower\u2019s share declined from 72% (1980) to 32% (2012). The share of gas in the thermal generation fuel mix \nhas fallen from 56% (2006) to 44% (2011), while heavy fuel oil increased from 42% to 54% during the same period. \n ", "3 \nsector customers' unpaid bills have increased by 359% during the same period.9 The poor \nperformance of the public sector companies caused further accumulation of unpaid electricity \ngeneration bills. In 2013, the government injected $3.8 billion in equity into the DISCOs to clear \nthese losses. On the demand side, inefficient industrial processes and equipment, household \nand  commercial  appliances,  and  buildings  are  all  sources  of  energy  wastage.  Private \nparticipation in the energy sector is curtailed because of chronic concern about payment to \npower suppliers, unclear investment policies and guidelines, and lack of transparent payment \npractices.  The  Central  Power  Purchasing  Agency  (CPPA)  was  to  provide  a  transparent \nsettlement  system  and  to  evolve  into  a  multibuyer  and  multiseller  trading  platform  for \ncompetitive electricity pricing. CPPA's separation from the transmission company is still being \nimplemented, while NEPRA is consulting the public for a model wheeling charge agreement that \nwould simplify procedures for electricity trading. Public sector energy companies have been \nslated for privatization. \n \n9.  Accountability  and  transparency.  The  lack  of  transparency  in  the  operation  and \npayment mechanisms has made it difficult to hold public sector companies accountable for their \nperformance. Automatic meters have now been installed at the 11-kilovolt level, allowing real-\ntime monitoring of neighborhood-specific losses. An extension of automatic meters to customers \nwill be needed to prevent overbilling and theft. Since the system lacks funds to pay for the \npower generated, power suppliers are uncertain about the priority and timing of payment. There \nwere concerns raised on the payments to IPPs not being based on merit.     \n \n10.  Changes needed for Pakistan's ailing energy sector to become sustainable and reliable \ncannot be realized overnight. Careful sequencing of policy actions and full implementation of \ndifficult decisions are needed. The program is designed to align each subprogram with targets \nfor each period and thus enable achievement of the desired long-term outcome by the end of \nthe program. Reform progress will be reviewed quarterly, together with the IMF\u2013EFF reviews. \nGiven  the  sector\u2019s  dynamic  nature  and  Pakistan\u2019s  macroeconomic  condition,  the  flexibility \nimbedded in this modality enables timely action and necessary adjustments to achieve the \nprogram\u2019s impact and outcome.  \n \n11.  ADB assistance. ADB is the leading partner in the sector and is engaged holistically, \nsupporting energy efficiency, transmission, distribution, cross-border natural gas pipelines, power \ngeneration, and renewable energy.10 The power policy and the proposed program follow the \nrecommendations of the Friends of Democratic Pakistan Energy Sector Task Force, which ADB \nco-chaired with the government.11 Through similar interventions, such as the Energy Sector \nRestructuring Program (ESRP), ADB initiated key sector reforms in 2000. Power sector reforms \nwere part of the Accelerating Economic Transformation Program in 2008 and 2009.12 The \nlessons from the ESRP are: (i) linking program conditions where ADB has a strong position, \n(ii) providing extensive long-term support through technical assistance and policy dialogue for \ndifficult reforms, (iii) privatizing state-owned enterprises instead of just unbundling, (iv) reducing \n                                                \n9  Receivables owed by private customers totaled $2.6 billion or 1.14% of GDP in 2013, whereas receivables owed \nby provincial and federal government customers increased by 7% from 2008 to 2013 and totaled $1.5 billion or \n0.66% of GDP in 2013. See Circular Debt Impact on Power Sector Investment (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n10 ADB's ongoing portfolio in the energy sector is $2.6 billion. The total multitranche financing facility amount is \n$2.9 billion. The government has requested new multitranche financing facilities for transmission and distribution. \n11 Membership consists of the government and 26 donors, including  the People's Republic of China, France, \nGermany, Japan, United Kingdom, and United States.

The  power  sector \ncompanies were unbundled under the ESRP, but have not become independent commercial \ncompanies and were not privatized. The country assistance program evaluation recommends \npursuing structural reforms through sector-specific initiatives using a programmatic approach.  \n \n12.  Link to country partnership strategy. The program is aligned with the priorities of \nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS),  2009\u20132013  for  Pakistan\u2014policy  reforms  and \nstructural  transformation  in  the  energy  sector.14 The  program  is  included  in  the  country \noperations business plan (COBP), 2014\u20132016 for Pakistan.15 ADB\u2019s forthcoming CPS, 2014\u2013\n2018 for Pakistan envisages a focus on contributions that will strengthen the energy sector, \nconsistent  with  ADB  priorities such  as  inclusive growth. The  energy sector  is  a  barrier to \neconomic growth, adequate job creation, and macroeconomic sustainability. It will play a central \nrole in the new CPS, supporting energy policy reforms and structural transformation. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact of the program will be a sustainable energy sector that supports economic \ngrowth. The outcome will be a reliable, sustainable, and affordable energy system.  \n   \nC.  Outputs \n14.  The program consists of five annual subprograms that support the government\u2019s reform \ninitiatives as outlined in the power policy, and specifically cover medium- to long-term issues in \nthree areas: (i) managing tariff and subsidies with revised and updated policies and guidelines \nto create a self-sustaining tariff regime, (ii) improving energy sector performance and the market \nenvironment to encourage participation by private entities, and (iii) increasing accountability and \ntransparency through public disclosure on the progress of the reforms and the performance of \nsector participants. The program is expected to encourage investments and provide the basis \nfor dynamic policymaking and regulatory improvements with the objective to make the sector \nself-sustainable.16 All 10 policy conditions for subprogram 1 were met by 31  March 2014. \nSubprogram 1 outputs are as follows: \n \n15.  Output 1: Managing tariffs and subsidies. The objectives of this output are to have \n(i) clear  policies  on  tariffs  and  subsidies  targeted  at  low-income  customers,  (ii)  policy \nimplementation  through  NEPRA  rules  and  guidelines,  (iii)  reduction  of  discretionary  policy \ndecisions and lags in tariff approval and implementation, and (iv) limits to power sector arrears. \nThe Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) approved the National Power Tariff and Subsidy \nPolicy Guidelines on 28 January 2014.17 The guidelines set out the short-, medium- and long-\n                                                \n13 The program was rated less than successful, but was considered relevant as support to the economy.    \n    ADB. 2013.

The amendments to Penal \nCode 1860 and the Code of Criminal Procedures 1898 have been enacted through Presidential ordinance, which \nwill be submitted to the Parliament for ratification (IMF structural benchmark). Utility courts will be established \nunder the amendment. A new electricity act to modernize governance of the sector is being drafted.   \n ", "5 \nterm goals on subsidies and tariffs, and the principles of reform in designing new guidelines for \nNEPRA. The NEPRA determination process, including the introduction of a multiyear tariff \nmechanism and automatic fuel price adjustments every quarter, will assist the timely application \nof a full cost-recovery tariff. The DISCOs will be requested to submit periodic investment plans \nin advance, along with their respective tariff petitions, to fast-track the determination process. \nClear  third-party  access  guidelines  and  tariffs  will  be  fully  disclosed  and  updated.  The \ngovernment will develop a mechanism to monitor and limit the accumulation of unpaid bills to \nthe power generation companies. The government will eliminate subsidies by 2016, except for \nthose to low-income customers who consume up to 200 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity per \nmonth.  Identification  of  these  customers  and  subsequent  implementation  of  the  subsidy \npayment scheme will be developed based on a study that reviews alternative payment options \nas well as existing mechanisms such as the Benazir Income Support Programme. As the \ngovernment intends to maintain a uniform national tariff, the guidelines establish the principles \nfor tariff equalization via an interregional subsidy. NEPRA's draft guidelines on DISCO tariff \ndetermination were posted on its website for public consultation in February 2014.18  The draft \nguidelines  specify  the  methodologies,  timetable,  formula,  and  procedures  for  DISCO  tariff \ndetermination. \n \n16.  Output 2: Improving sector performance and market access for private sector \nparticipation.19 Market-oriented reform will be put in place to increase efficiencies of public \nsector power companies and encourage private sector participation. The objectives are: (i) to \nreduce losses and improve tariff collection by DISCOs, (ii) improve demand-side efficiency and \nstrengthen energy conservation, (iii) manage generation costs through least-cost plans and \nensure their implementation, (iv) increase gas supply and open the market to direct contracting \nbetween producers and large consumers, (v) commercialize public sector power companies,20 \nand (vi) institutionalize CPPA\u2019s commercial operations. Both loss reduction and better tariff \ncollection by DISCOs are critical to their performance and sustainability. For subprogram 1, the \nMinistry of Water and Power instructed four DISCOs to outsource collection to the private \nsector, and instructed all DISCOs to implement a revenue protection program that will improve \ncollection. A mechanism was submitted and discussed at the Council of Common Interests to \nautomatically deduct overdue provincial government customer electricity bills from the federal \ngovernment allocation to the provinces. The federal government customers has been informed \nthat bills exceeding 90 days will be automatically deducted from their budget allocations and \ndirectly paid to the DISCOs. The government\u2019s commitment to reduce generation costs by \nadjusting  the  fuel  mix  will  be  manifest  in  the  implementation  of  a  long-term,  least-cost \ngeneration and transmission expansion plan.21 For subprogram 1, the government has issued \ninstructions for the least-cost plan to take into account energy security and all associated costs, \nincluding social, environmental, and climate change risk mitigation measures. The government \nwill also expedite the implementation of the Petroleum Exploration and Production Policy of \n2012  and  its  subsequent  amendments  to  enable  a  market-oriented  gas  sector. 22  The \ngovernment will encourage more gas production through incentives such as pricing regimes and \nclear  disclosure  of  concession  agreements  and  application  progress.  The  2013  Model \n                                                \n18 Although  not  a  structural  benchmark,  the  NEPRA  guidelines  (http://www.nepra.org.pk/Draft/Guidelines \n%20For%20Determination%20of%20Consumer-end%20Tariff(Methodology%20&Process).pdf)  have  been \nincluded in the letter of intent of the government for the IMF\u2019s EFF, with a targeted promulgation date of April 2014.  \n19 The program will focus on enhancing an enabling environment and commercializing state-owned companies for \nprivatization. A program loan for state-owned enterprise reform, which includes privatization, is being prepared. \n20  Commercializing the DISCOs will help achieve the government's privatization targets. \n21 Environmental and social risk mitigation costs will be included in the calculations.  \n22Government  of  Pakistan.

To ensure accountability and promote higher efficiency, all GENCOs and DISCOs, as \nwell as the National Transmission Despatch Company, will enter into performance contracts \nwith  the  government.  Key  performance  indicators  will  be  disclosed  to  the  public.  For \nsubprogram 1, three DISCOs have signed performance contracts.  In  line  with  the  IMF\u2013EFF \nstructural  benchmark  for  the  institutionalization  of  the  CPPA,  subprogram  1  sets  out  the \noperational framework for the CPPA. The CPPA will act as a single buyer on behalf of the \nDISCOs,  enforce  contracts  and  transactions,  and  ensure  invoicing  and  payment.  This  will \nincrease credibility especially for debt repayment. The memorandum and articles of association \nwas amended to establish CPPA as an agent to purchase electricity on behalf of the DISCOs. In \npreparation of new power purchase agreements between the CPPA and the GENCOs, the \nCPPA has, on behalf of the DISCOs, entered into a heads of agreements with GENCO Holding \nCompany. The heads of agreements includes the key principles of the new power purchase \nagreements. The target is for trading between bulk suppliers and buyers to begin by latest 2018. \n \n18.  Output  3:  Achieving  accountability  and  transparency.  Better  access  will  foster \ndemand for information and a culture of transparency. Subprogram 1 sets out a mechanism to \nincrease public access to energy sector information. The government will implement web-based \nopen access to merit order dispatch and daily payment information for the power generation \ncompanies to reinforce prioritization based on economic rationale. Subsidy information is now \nincluded  in  each  customer's  bill  to  raise  awareness  of  the  amount  of  subsidies  that  the \ngovernment provides. The DISCOs also publish monthly billing and collection data on their \nwebsites,  including  arrears  aggregated  by  customer  category.  To  monitor  power  policy \nimplementation and NEPRA\u2019s performance, the ECC has instructed the Ministry of Water and \nPower and the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources to set up monitoring units that \nreport quarterly to the ECC on implementation progress. The two ministries will also appoint \nindependent and internationally respected experts to review the quarterly reports and make \nrecommendations. The reports and recommendations will be made public on a timely basis.23  \n \n19.  Subsequent subprograms. Subprogram 1 sets out a clear framework and establishes \na solid foundation for future reforms. Policy conditions for subsequent subprograms will ensure \nthat  the  implementation  of  reform  measures  initiated  under  subprogram  1  continues.  The \nprogram requires flexibility in all subsequent subprograms to reflect any changes in Pakistan\u2019s \neconomy, political situation, or other circumstances.   \n \n20.  Subprogram 2 has 10 indicative policy conditions that cover all three reform areas and \nare to be completed by January 2015. Subprogram 2 actions are expected to include the \nfollowing: (i) Output 1: notification of guidelines for tariff determination, publication of information \non payment arrears, and a mechanism to keep the level of payment arrears capped; (ii) Output \n2: reclassification and provisioning by DISCOs of receivables from customers;  issuance of \nregulations on minimum energy performance standards and appliance labeling; notification of \nrules for stepping up gas production; signing of performance contracts between Ministry of \nWater and Power and industry participants, signing of energy supply agreements between the \nCPPA and each DISCO, signing (by the CPPA on behalf the DISCOs) of power purchase \n                                                \n23 The review and recommendations of the advisors will be a part of the report but will not be edited by the relevant \nauthorities. The report will be disclosed to the public after the ECC meeting.  \n ", "7 \nagreements with generation companies, and signing of an agreement between WAPDA and the \nCPPA  on  the  administration  of  IPPs\u2019  power  purchase  agreements;  and  (iii)  Output  3: \nimplementation  of  web-based  access  to  information  on  amounts  due to  and  payments  by \nindustry participants, and publication of information by industry participants on achievement of \nselected performance standards and indicators. \n \n21.  Subprograms 3 to 5 are intended to continue to build on the reforms begun under \nsubprograms 1 and 2, with indicative policy actions in each of the three reform areas to be \ncarried out by January of 2016, 2017, and 2018. Indicative policy actions for subprograms 3\u20135 \ninclude the following: (i) Output 1: determination of multiyear tariffs; (ii) Output 2: implementation \nof  revenue  protection  programs  by  DISCOs  and  notification  of  national  energy  standards; \nestablishment of a steering committee on national energy conservation policy; implementation \nof a restructuring plan for mid- and downstream gas operations; and implementation of a long-\nterm, least-cost generation and transmission expansion plan; and (iii) Output 3: publication of \nkey indicators under the power sector performance contracts, and of a review of compliance by \npower sector companies with licensing provisions; and disclosure of operational audit reports.             \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n22.  Subprogram 1 comprises a single-tranche loan of SDR257,443,000. Subprograms 2 and \n3, with a loan of $150 million equivalent each, and subprograms 4 and 5, with a loan of $250 \nmillion equivalent each, are all subject to further discussions between ADB and the government, \nand to the availability of Asian Development Fund resources. Subsequent subprograms will be \nsubmitted for ADB Board consideration upon completion of the policy triggers. Financing from \nordinary  capital  resources  and  from  cofinanciers  on  a  parallel  cofinancing  basis  may  be \nconsidered. The World Bank is expected to provide cofinancing for the first ($600 million) and \nsecond subprograms.24 The policy matrix (Appendix 4) lists actions to be taken prior to Board \nconsideration for subprogram 1, and proposed policy actions for subsequent subprograms. The \ngovernment has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR257,443,000 from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance subprogram 1. The loan will have a 25-year \nterm, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are set forth in the draft loan \nagreement. The programmatic approach will support reforms outlined in the development policy \nletter (Appendix 3) and policy matrix. The amount is determined by the significance of the \nenergy sector to the overall economy, the expected development impact of the policy package \nbased on its strength, and Pakistan\u2019s development financing needs. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n23.  The ECC will oversee and is the final government authority on the reforms (para. 22). \nThe Ministry of Finance will be the program\u2019s executing agency, supported by the program \ncoordination unit (PCU). The PCU will have overall responsibility for coordinating program \nmonitoring and reporting. The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources and the Ministry of \nWater and Power will be the implementing agencies, supported by their monitoring units. Each \nmonitoring unit will be responsible for program reporting and discussing implementing issues \nwith the PCU. The monitoring units will submit quarterly reports to the ECC. The report will be \n                                                \n24 The one development policy letter was issued for all cofinancing institutions. The policy matrix may differ because \nof the different duration of support and timing of prior actions for subprogram 1. The policy matrix was developed \nthrough joint missions by cofinancing institutions to ensure consistency in policy advice and to avoid partial \nimplementation of reforms by dividing the prior conditions between the institutions.  \n         ", "8 \nprovided to ADB.25 Technical assistance to support the program will be provided by ADB, Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, United States Agency for International Development, the \nWorld Bank, and other donors through their ongoing and new initiatives. ADB is processing a \ntechnical assistance loan for state-owned enterprise reforms, which will provide support for the \nPCU and the monitoring units.26 The proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed to Pakistan \nin accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and \nRelated Requirements for Program Loans.27 The loan proceeds will be used to finance the cost \n(excluding local taxes and duties) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, \nexcluding ineligible items and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources.  The \nimplementation period for the program is from October 2013 to June 2018. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial  \n24.  The proposed policy reforms under the program will contribute to the national economy \nby (i) reducing the subsidies for the power sector, (ii) increasing investment, production, and \nemployment as a result of more reliable electricity, and (iii) lowering production and distribution \ncosts. The electricity supply has increased after the government injected liquidity in June and \nJuly  2013  to  pay  overdue  bills  from  DISCOs  through  the  CPPA  to  the  power  suppliers. \nHowever, new payment arrears have accumulated, totaling PRs200 billion as of the end of \nDecember 2013.28 Removing administrative barriers, reducing costs, and introducing automatic \nadjustment mechanisms for government bills will help eliminate the need for subsidies. A least-\ncost based fuel mix and market-oriented commercial system will lower costs and ease the \nburden  on  customers.  Payment  arrears  will  also  decline  if  collection  improves,  if  DISCOs \nimprove their performance and stem system losses, and if the government pays the remaining \nsubsidies on time. Reliability of power supply will be restored, thereby providing energy that \nsupports economic growth. Subprogram 1 will generate economic benefits by establishing a \npolicy framework for medium- to long-term reforms. It will also effect immediate changes to \nadministrative procedures to increase sector revenues and efficiency and lower operating costs. \n \nB.  Governance   \n25.  In line with the Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan, a governance, \ninstitutional, and corruption risk assessment is being conducted as part of the preparation of the \nCPS for Pakistan in 2014. As indicated in the draft assessment, Pakistan\u2019s score for various \ngovernance indicators fell below the regional average in 2012. However, the country has made \nprogress  in  improving  accountability,  increasing  transparency,  and  raising  efficiency.  The \ngovernment  has  embarked  on  several  reforms  to  strengthen  the  institutional  framework, \nincluding budget management, financial accounting, and reporting and expenditure controls. As \npart of the IMF\u2013EFF, the government has changed the tax policy to increase transparency. The \nrecent focus has been on capacity building and training at the federal and provincial levels. A \nfiduciary risk assessment found that overall fiduciary risk at the federal level remains medium to \nhigh  despite  the  progress  observed  within  individual  public  expenditure  and  financial \n                                                \n25 The monitoring framework is included in the Technical Memorandum (accessible from the list of linked documents   \n    in Appendix 2). \n26 Analytical, technical, legal, regulatory, and communications support for the program's duration will be provided.  \n27 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n28 Payment arrears increased from PRs105 billion in 2008 to PRs461 billion in 2012 and then fell to PRs90 billion in \nJuly 2013. See Circular Debt Impact on Power Sector Investment (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n ", "9 \naccountability assessment areas. Even with the installation of SAP enterprise resource planning \nsoftware and the introduction of a chief finance and account officer in line ministries as internal \nauditor, internal control and audit remain weak, as does the legislative oversight over budget \nformulation and execution. Although the institutional setup for public procurement has been \nestablished, not enough efforts have been made to augment the capacity of and the budget \nallocations to these authorities. To support the government in public financial management \nreforms,  ongoing  initiatives  financed  by  various  donors  should  be  coordinated  and \ncomplementary. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the government. The government is acting against corruption, which includes \nongoing monitoring and reporting work by the public accounts committee of the Parliament. \nApproximately PRs138 billion was recovered between July 2008 and February 2013.   \n \nC.  Poverty and Social  \n26.  The reforms supported under the program will accelerate economic growth and help \ncreate jobs, which are keys to reducing poverty.  Reliable power will  benefit the poor and \nvulnerable consumers, including hospitals and schools, who are hard hit by inadequate power \nsupply, load shedding, and poor power quality. Small industries will be able to operate for more \nhours  per  day  and  thereby  increase  productivity,  which  in  turn  will  create  more  work \nopportunities for the poor. Increases in the Human Development Index are strongly correlated \nwith access to commercial electricity supplies. The indirect benefits of reliable energy supply \ninclude reduced work time, and better health of household members by reducing fume-related \nindoor pollution and water- and food-borne diseases by refrigeration and boiling water and food. \n  \nD.  Safeguards  \n27.  The program has been assessed as category C for both involuntary resettlement and \nindigenous peoples, and category B for environment. In the event of any unanticipated adverse \nenvironmental  or  social  impacts,  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  (SPS)  will  be \napplied in its entirety and the loan will be recategorized. An environmental assessment for the \nentire program found that the policy action requiring the government to prepare a least-cost \ngeneration  and  transmission  plan  may  have  future  impacts  on  the  environment  if  not \nappropriately managed.29 The covenants in the loan agreement include carrying out a strategic \nenvironmental assessment and making sure that any identified long-term environmental impact \nis  managed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  SPS  (2009).  If  other  policy  actions  are  added  to \nsubsequent  tranches,  safeguard  due  diligence  will  be  done  to  confirm  or  change  the \ncategorization. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n28.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  1.30 The  integrated \nbenefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs.  \n \nTable 1: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInhibited productivity and reduced  The Government of Pakistan is taking steps to reduce circular debt by \nefficiency in the power sector because  increasing the consumer tariff, paying subsidy on time, and pay debt \nof circular debt.  owed by the power sector that accrued due to delays in tariff \n                                                \n29 Environmental Assessment of the Policy Matrix (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n30 The major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the Risk Assessment and Risk Management \nPlan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n         ", "10 \nnotification and subsidy payments.  \nAn economic downturn prompts less  The government has developed a macroeconomic reform plan, agreed \ninvestment, limits fiscal revenue growth  with the International Monetary Fund under the extended fund facility \nand thereby risks breaching the ratio of  program, which will remove economic constraints and, along with other \npublic debt to gross domestic product.a   reforms (including the proposed program), is expected to strengthen \nthe fiscal position.  \nLack of coordination in policy  The Economic Coordination Committee oversees the reforms and \nformulation and implementation by  receives quarterly reports.

The government has assured ADB that subprogram 1 implementation shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \ndocuments. The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for subprogram 1, \nwhich are set forth in the loan agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION  \n30.
