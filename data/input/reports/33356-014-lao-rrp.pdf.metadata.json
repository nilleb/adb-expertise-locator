These  sectors  are  critical  for \ndelivering an annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of about  8% during the 2011\u2013\n2015 period. The government deems this rate of economic growth necessary for the country to \ngraduate  from  least  developed  country  status  by  2020  as  well  as  to  achieve  its  poverty \nreduction targets. The water resources also have regional significance since about 35% of total \nMekong  river  flow  is  generated  in  the  country\u2019s  watersheds.  The  country  has  abundant  water \nresources  per  capita.2 However,  current  storage  capacity  of  large  reservoirs  is  about  3%  of \nannual surface water availability and hydropower generation is about 8% of potential. With the \nsecond  largest  annual  flow  and  population,  the  Nam  Ngum  River  Basin  (NNRB)  is  one  of  the \nmost  important  river  basins  in  the  Lao  PDR  where  water  resources  have  been  utilized \nsignificantly for hydropower generation and irrigation. The current project promotes optimal use \nof  water  resources  through  integrated  water  resources  management  (IWRM)3 in  the  NNRB, \nwhich  includes  16  districts  in  Luangprabang,  Vientiane,  and  Xiengkhouang  provinces,  and \nVientiane  Capital.  To  date,  the  current  project  has  contributed  significantly  to  improved  water \ngovernance, information gathering and processing, and watershed management both within the \nNNRB  and  nationally.  The  additional \nthese \nachievements.  \n\nfinancing  will  consolidate  and  enhance \n\n \nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \n\n3. \nIn  2002,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  the  Nam  Ngum  River  Basin \nDevelopment  Sector  Project 4  for  $15  million  equivalent  from  the  Asian  Development  Fund \n(ADF).  The  closing  date  is  30  September  2011  following  three  extensions.5 The  project  was \ndesigned to institutionalize IWRM in the water sector planning and management at the central \nand  provincial  levels,  and  to  provide  sustainable  livelihood  opportunities  for  poor  and  ethnic \npeople. It has three investment components: IWRM, reservoir modeling and management, and \nwatershed  management.  The  current  project  has  (i)  contributed  to  the  establishment  of  the \nWater  Resources  and  Environment  Administration  (WREA),6 (ii)  developed  the  national  water \nresources  profile  and  NNRB  plan7 which  is  the  country\u2019s  first  IWRM  plan,  (iii)  supported  the \n                                                \n1 The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2The total actual renewable water resources per capita is about 58,000 cubic meter per year, which is the highest   \namong Southeast Asian countries. http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/maps \n3 IWRM  is  a  process  to  improve  the  planning,  conservation,  development,  and  management  of  water,  forest,  land, \nand  aquatic  resources  in  a  river  basin  context,  to  maximize  economic  benefits  and  social  welfare  in  an  equitable \nmanner without compromising the sustainability of vital environmental systems. (ADB. 2001. Water for All. Manila.)  \n4 ADB.  2002.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the  Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Nam Ngum River Basin Development Sector Project. Manila (approved on 11 \nNovember 2002). \n5 There were initial delays of 15 months in loan effectiveness and 4 months in consultant recruitment, but the overall \nproject  implementation  period  from  effectiveness  to  completion  remained  at  about  80  months  (6  years  and  8 \nmonths). This led to two initial extensions. The physical completion date is 30 September 2010.  The third extension, \nfor 6 months, is to examine the government\u2019s request for this additional financing (para. 6). \n6  WREA  was  established  under  the  Decree  No.  149/PM  on  10  May  2007.  Originally,  the  Water  Resources \nCoordination  Committee  was  the  implementing  agency  for  the  IWRM  component.  WREA  superseded  the \ncoordination  committee  as  the  implementing  agency  and  was  subsumed  under  the  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources \nand Environment (MoNRE) which was newly established in June 2011. \n7 WREA. 2009. Nam Ngum River Basin Integrated Water Resources Management Plan. Vientiane. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ngovernment  in  developing  and  adopting  a  decree  for  general  establishment  of  river  basin \ncommittees 8  which  has  enabled  the  establishment  of  two  river  basin  committees,  (iv) \nstrengthened the capacity of the Department of Electricity of the Ministry of Energy and Mines \nfor  Nam  Ngum  1  reservoir 9  management,  (v)  developed  the  capacity  of  the  Integrated \nWatershed Management Unit (IWMU) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF), and (vi) \ninitiated decentralized agricultural support systems.   \n \n4. \nThe  current  project  is  considered  to  be  performing  well  according  to  ADB\u2019s  additional \nfinancing policy.10 In March 2011, an early project completion review mission was conducted by \nADB  to  coincide  with  the  final  review  of  the  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD),11 a \ncofinancier  of  the  current  project.  The  project  completion  review  mission  concluded  that, \nalthough  there  were  start-up  delays  and  a  need  to  reformulate  the  agricultural  extension \nactivities, 12  the  current  project  has  been  successful  in  achieving  its  overall  development \nobjectives. The review mission reported that major output indicators exceeded their targets and \nkey outcome targets were achieved.13 The cumulative physical progress reached 98%. Planned \ncontracts  were  fully  awarded  and  $17.38  million  was  disbursed  out  of  the  total  allocation  of \n$17.39  million  from  the  ADF.  The  rate  of  contract  awards  and  disbursements  showed  much-\nimproved performance in later years of implementation. The mission identified no major issues \nand  noted  that  the  applicable  safeguards  policies  were  complied  with  throughout  the  project \nimplementation. No major risks threatened the successful implementation of the project and it is \nrated on-track in the project performance rating.  \n \n5. \nIn  particular,  the  current  loan  has  successfully  implemented  the  IWRM  process  in  the \nNNRB by (i) supporting the establishment of the Nam Ngum River Basin Committee Secretariat \n(NNRBCS)  and  initial  operations  of  the  WREA,  (ii)  initiating  the  process  of  watershed \nmanagement  planning  within  IWMU,  (iii)  setting  up  29  khet  (village  cluster)  extension  service \ncenters  (KESCs)  for  improved  farming  practices  under  the  Lao  Extension  Approach,  and  (iv) \ninitiating village development revolving funds (VDRFs) with detailed operational guidelines in the \n16  districts.  In  addition  to  these  institutional  developments,  the  current  project  provided  about \n12,000 households with improved agricultural support services and more than 9,000 households \nhad  access  to  credits  for  agricultural  inputs  and  materials.  Sample  surveys  under  the  project \nshow  an  average  household  income  increase  of  54%  from  2004  to  2009.  Average  rice  yields \nincreased from 3.1 tons per hectare (t/ha) in 2004 to 3.6 t/ha in 2009 in 158 villages surveyed. \nTotal number of livestock in the villages increased by about 40% from 2004 to 2009.14 However, \nsustainability  of  some  of  these  outputs  and  their  impacts  are  uncertain  since  these  activities \nhave  been  in  place  for  a  short  period  coupled  with  the  government  constraints  in  providing \nsufficient human and financial resources to fully operationalize the new institutions. Key lessons \n                                                \n8 Decree No. 293/PM on 15 June 2010. \n9 The  Nam  Ngum  1  reservoir  is  the  largest  reservoir  in  the  country  with  a  total  storage  capacity  of  almost  7,300 \nmillion cubic meter and an electricity generation capacity of 155 megawatt, generating approximately 966 gigawatt-\nhours per annum. The Nam Ngum 1 dam was completed in 1971.  \n\n10 ADB.  2010.  Additional  Financing:  Enhancing  Development  Effectiveness.  Manila.  Para.  41  of  the  policy  paper \ndescribes  measures  to  determine  whether  a  project  is  performing  well:  (i)  the  delivery  of  expected  outputs,  (ii) \nsatisfactory  implementation  progress,  (iii)  satisfactory  compliance  with  safeguard  policy  requirements,  (iv) \nsuccessful  management  of  risks,  and  (v)  a  rating  of  highly satisfactory  or  satisfactory  in  the  project performance \nratings. The required ratings are substituted with an on-track rating under the revised performance rating system. \n11 The AFD grant was approved by AFD\u2019s board on 24 April 2003, became effective in July 2003 and closed on 31 \nMay  2009.  AFD\u2019s  final  independent  evaluation mission  was  required  to  be  conducted  within 24 months  of  AFD\u2019s \ngrant closing date. \n\n12 The reformulation followed the then newly developed Lao Extension Approach in 2005. The approach consists of \ntwo sub-systems: the government extension services and the village extension system. The village system is jointly \nmanaged  by  villagers  and  village  authorities.  Activities  are  facilitated  by  village  extension  workers  who  are \nappointed and compensated by the community, while receiving technical support from government services. \n\n13 Summary of Project  Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 Survey results are in the Summary of Project Performance (footnote 13). \n\n \n\n\flearned  include:  (i)  retaining  experienced  staff  and  strategic  asset  management  consolidate \nKESC  operations,  and  (ii)  formalizing  VDRF  operations  under  the  Bank  of  Lao  PDR \nmicrofinance  regulations  improves  their  sustainability.  The  government  also  intends  to  initiate \nsub-basin management to address location-specific water-related issues through the process of \nsub-basin planning and monitoring. \n \n6. \nConsequently,  the  government  has  requested  ADB\u2019s  consideration  of  additional \nfinancing  to  consolidate  and  expand  the  activities  initiated  under  the  current  project. 15  In \nresponse to the request, the proposed additional financing project will modify and scale-up the \nwell-performing  operations,  particularly  participatory  sub-basin  management  to  strengthen \nIWRM  capacity  at  the  district  level,  consolidate  KESC  and  VDRF  operations,  and  expand \npromising agricultural support services to benefit additional villages in remote parts of the NNRB. \n \nThe  additional  financing  project  meets  ADB\u2019s  four  eligibility  criteria  for  additional \n7. \nfinancing:16 (i) the satisfactory implementation and performance of the current project (confirmed \nby the project completion review mission) supports technical, financial, and economic viability of \nthe  additional  financing  project  as  it  will  have  no  significant  changes  in  approaches  and \nmethodologies  from  the  current  project;  (ii)  the  government  accords  the  additional  financing \nproject high priority through its request for additional financing; (iii) while project outputs will be \nscaled  up  and  replicated  in  additional  villages  within  the  basin,  the  project  retains  the  original \noverall  objectives;17 and  (iv)  the  outcome  is  consistent  with  the  current  country  strategy  and \nprogram midterm review (2009),18 which promotes natural and water resources management for \nsustainable economic growth. \n \n8. \nThe additional financing project has a high degree of project readiness. The capacity of \nthe MAF (the executing agency) has significantly improved over the course of the current project \nimplementation.  Under  the  project,  practical  plans  have  been  developed  for  self-sustaining \nKESC  and  VDRF  operations  based  on  experiences  gained  and  lessons  learned.  Additional \nfinancing is considered to be a suitable instrument to promptly respond to the  emerging needs \nand deepen the achievements of the current project. Building on the established arrangements \nand  methodologies,  the  additional  financing  project  will  capture  incremental  poverty  reduction \nand  sustainable  natural  resources  management  benefits  from  the  strengthened  public  sector \ninstitutions and communities for IWRM in the NNRB. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe expected impact of the overall project will be the optimal use of water resources,19 \n9. \nespecially within the NNRB. The outcome will be integrated watershed management improved \nin  the  NNRB.  The  additional  financing  project  will  ensure  that  significant  institutional \ndevelopments under the current project are embedded in central and local government as well \nas  water  and  natural  resources  management  systems.  Enhanced  district  and  community \nfacilitate  synergy  between  sub-basin \nparticipation  and \n\ninteragency  coordination  will \n\n                                                \n15 In accordance with ADB\u2019s additional financing policy (footnote 10). Para. 40 describes that additional financing will \n\nsupport scale up of operations and scope changes or modifications of projects that are performing well.   \n\n16 As per para. 4 of the Operations Manual (OM) Section H5/BP, additional financing will only support projects that (i) \nremain  technically  feasible,  economically  viable,  and  financially  sound;  (ii)  are  accorded  high  priority  by  the \ngovernment; (iii) are consistent with the project\u2019s development objectives; and (iv) are consistent with the current \ncountry partnership strategy. This follows para. 40 of ADB\u2019s additional financing policy (footnote 10), \n\n17 The original goal is now the impact and the original objective is now the outcome. The original two outcomes are \ncombined into one. The components under the current project are outputs under the additional financing project. \n\n18 ADB. 2009. Country Strategy and Program Midterm Review: Lao PDR, 2007\u20132011. Manila. \n19 The optimal use of water resources under the additional financing project envisions the sustainability of water- and \nland-based  natural  resources,  which  can  partly  be  captured  through  observation  of  river  flows.  The  goal  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s NNRB plan aims also to facilitate the sustainable use of the water and related resources. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nmanagement  and  livelihood  support  services.  These  are  necessary  for  effective  IWRM  within \nthe NNRB. The reservoir management and modeling activities of the current project will not be \ncontinued  as  these  activities  have  been  completed.  The  additional  financing  project  will, \nhowever, continue to monitor the reservoir modeling results. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n10. \nExpected  outputs  will  be  (i)  the  NNRBCS  strengthened  for  sub-basin management,  (ii) \ndistrict  land  use  planning  enhanced,  (iii)  agricultural  support  services  improved,  and  (iv) \ninstitutional  and  human  resource  capacity  strengthened  for  project  implementation.  The \nNNRBCS will initiate its operations for developing sub-basin plans to facilitate coordinated sub-\nbasin  management  at  the  district  level.  Improved  watershed  planning  will  be  incorporated  in \ndistrict  land  use  plans  to  align  local  development  programs  with  sustainable  sub-basin  and \nwatershed  management.  Enhanced  agricultural  support  services  will  promote  the  adoption  of \nenvironmentally sustainable and profitable farming and forestry practices. \n  \n11. \nOutput  1:  NNRBCS  strengthened  for  sub-basin  management. The project activities \nwill assist the newly established NNRBCS in initiating sub-basin management. These activities \nwill  include (i) selecting five priority sub-basins; (ii) undertaking multi-stakeholder consultations \nfor  sub-basin  planning  and  monitoring  in  the  selected  sub-basins;  (iii)  establishing  a  working \ngroup for each of the priority sub-basins; (iv) training on sub-basin management; (v) developing \nand  disseminating  sub-basin  management  plans;  and  (vi)  developing  guidelines  for  the \nimplementation and monitoring of the plans. The sub-basin plans will identify specific sub-basin \nissues to be addressed through a decentralized consultation process with beneficiaries. The key \nelements of these plans will be incorporated into district development plans. \n \n12. \nOutput 2: District land use planning enhanced. The project will assist in incorporating \nwatershed landscape continuum plans (WLCPs)20 developed under the current project in district \ndevelopment  programs.  The  planned  activities  will  (i)  disseminate  WLCPs  to  communities \nthrough  the  village  development  planning  process,  (ii)  train  district  staff  in  preparing  and/or \nrevising  district  land  use  zoning  in  accordance  with  the  WLCPs  to  promote  environmentally \nsustainable land use, and (iii) update WLCPs based on the development process of district land \nuse plans and sub-basin management plans. \n \n13. \nOutput  3:  Agricultural  support  services  improved.  The  project  will  assist  in \nenhancing  KESC  operational  capacity  and  sustainability,  and  increasing  their  beneficiaries. \nIntensive  support  will  be  provided  to  23  KESCs  in  10  districts21 within  the  NNRB  which  are \nrelatively  poor  and  remote.  The  KESCs  will  cover  230  villages,  which  have  been  supported \nunder the current project, and 50 additional villages. The project will transform existing VDRFs \nin  16  districts  into  sustainable  financing  institutions.  The  activities  will  (i)  strengthen  KESC \ncapacity  for  the  effective  management  of  the  centers  by  improving  technical  skills  of  staff,  (ii) \ntrain  farmer  leaders  and  foster  their  networks,  (iii)  implement  extension  services  with  income-\ngenerating  activities  such  as  seed  and  seedling  production  and  cattle  fattening,  and  (iv) \ninstitutionalize  the  VDRFs  as  district  savings  and  credit  unions  or  other  appropriate  credit \ninstitutions  by  registering  under  the  Bank  of  Lao  PDR.

The  additional  financing  project  will  increase  project  implementation  and \nnatural resources management capacity of NNRB staff to intensify interagency coordination and \nenhance  district  and  community  participation.  The  project  will  (i)  support  coordination  across \noutputs;  (ii)  facilitate  cross-sector  information  sharing  on  natural  resources  management  such \nas  hydro-meteorological  data,  watershed  profiling,  and  consultation  and  training  programs  for \nlocal governments and communities; and (iii) initiate formalized planning and review processes. \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nThe  additional  financing  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $5.08  million  (Table  1).  As  of  July \n15. \n2011,  the  cost  of  the  current  project  was  $29.06  million  equivalent,22 reflecting  higher  than \nestimated  in-kind  contributions  by  the  government  and  increased  funds  availability  due  to \nappreciation  of  the  special  drawing  right.

Therefore, technical feasibility, economic benefits, financial viability, and project \nsustainability  for  the  proposed  investments  were  analyzed  based  on  the  demonstrated \nperformance of the current project.  \n \nA. \n \n20. \nThe additional financing project, like the current project, will adopt a sector approach to \nallow  for  decentralized  and  participatory  project  implementation.  Additional  villages  will  be \nscreened  and  selected  during  implementation  following  a  set  of  criteria  developed  under  the \ncurrent project. The current project has developed a participatory village development and land \nuse  planning  process  which  has  been  accepted  by  villagers.  This  facilitates  community \nparticipation  and coordination among project  stakeholders.  Major  livelihood  activities  proposed \nunder  the  additional  financing  project  have  proved  to  be  implementable  in  the  local  context. \nThese activities include improved rice cropping, livestock-raising, and nontimber forest product \nmanagement. The project will follow programs and guidelines for  KESC and VDRF operations \nprepared under the current project. The additional financing project will utilize and build on these \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nestablished  approaches  as  they  have  been  proven  to  be  operationally  sound  and  technically \nfeasible.  Therefore,  if  properly  and  efficiently  implemented,  the  achievement  of  the  project \noutcome and outputs should face no serious risks. \n \nB. \n \n21. \nThe  benefits  of  the  current  project  were  verified  by  the  project  completion  review \nmission. Benefits that were readily quantifiable include incremental benefits from increased farm \nand  forestry  productivity  through  integrated  agriculture  extension  and  enhanced  watershed \nmanagement.  A  sample  survey  shows  increased  rice  yields,  livestock  productivity,  and \nhousehold income. The project completion review mission estimated that the economic internal \nrate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  the  current  project  is  25.8%.26 The  benefits  of  the  additional  financing \nproject will be (i) effective sub-basin management, (ii) sustainable agriculture support services, \nand  (iii)  increased  rice  and  livestock  production  and  livelihood  opportunities  from  sustainable \nand  improved  natural  resources  productivity,  forest  and  water  in  particular.  The  EIRR  of  the \nadditional  financing  project  is  estimated  at  28.7%  based  on  major  quantifiable  benefits  from \nincreased productivity in rice, livestock, and forestry. This compares well with that of the current \nproject which includes benefits from improved hydropower generation. The additional financing \nproject  is  viable,  relying  on  proven  activities  of  the  current  project.  The  EIRR  of  the  overall \nproject  is  estimated  at  27.4%.  This  demonstrates  that  the  additional  financing  project  will  add \nsignificant economic value to the benefits realized under the current project. \n \n22. \nThrough the implementation of the current project, the proposed executing agency and \nimplementing agencies have demonstrated their capacity to implement the current project. The \nprocurement  capacity  of  the  executing  agency  was  assessed  to  be  acceptable  during \npreparation  of  the  additional  financing  project.  Project  staff  in  the  ONPM  have  also \ndemonstrated  sufficient  financial  management  capacity  to  implement  the  additional  financing \nproject.  The  fund  flow  mechanism  has  been  refined  through  experience  gained  under  the \ncurrent  project.  Experienced  staff  will  be  retained  and  external  technical  support  will  further \nimprove the financial management and procurement of the project. \n \nC. \n \n23. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  for  the  additional  financing  project  activities.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  project  administration \nmanual.27 The  additional  financing  project  will  assist  with  decentralized  project  implementation \nby  district  governments.  Promoting  involvement  of  local  communities  is  expected  to  increase \ntransparency of project-related decision making and accountability of the public sector. External \nspecialists in financial management, procurement and environmental and social safeguards will \nbe  engaged  by  the  ONPM  to  support  project  staff.  Representatives  from  the  Lao  Front  for \nNational  Construction  (LFNC)  and  the  Lao  Women\u2019s  Union  (LWU)  will  continue  to  support \nproject activities in the field through supervision. This will improve project-related governance.  \n \nD. \n \n24. \nThe  additional  financing  project  will  focus  on  communities  in  upland  areas  where \nsignificant  numbers  of  ethnic  people  live  and  where  poor  people  depend  almost  solely  on \nfarming and forestry for their livelihoods. The selection procedure will target villages with higher \npoverty levels and ethnic population ratios to enhance the positive social impact of the project. \n                                                \n26 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Project Administration Manual  (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nGovernance \n\n \n\n \n\n\fimpact. \n\nSafeguards \n\nInitial  environmental  examinations \n\nParticipatory  village  development  and  land  use  planning  will  promote  inclusive,  gender,  and \nethnic group sensitive development and resources allocation. Improved watershed management \nwill  promote  sustainable  natural  resources  use,  which  improves  food  security  for  the  poorest. \nThe current project has improved the access of women to rural credits through VDRFs and to \nclean water through improved water supply systems. These activities were well appreciated by \nfemale  villagers  and  will  be  continued  under the  additional financing project.28 The key gender \ndesign features are (i) at least 30% female participation in training sessions for government staff \nand  villagers;  and  (ii)  promotion  of  joint  land  use  certificates  issued  in  the  names  of  both \nhusband and wife, to support women\u2019s access to land.    \n \nE. \n \n25. \nEnvironmental  safeguard  (category  B).  The  additional  financing  project  will  have \nlimited site-specific environmental and social impacts. The current project has had no significant \nadverse  environmental  and  social \nfor  19 \nsubwatersheds  within  the  NNRB  were  prepared  under  the  current  project. 29 The  additional \nfinancing project will continue to support livelihood activities initiated under the current project in \n230  villages  and  initiate  similar  activities  in  50  additional  villages  in  the  same  subwatersheds. \nFollowing the procedures set forth in the environmental assessment and review framework,30 a \nscreening process will be established to categorize the activities of each target village according \nto  its  environmental  sensitivity  and,  where  needed,  existing  initial  environmental  examinations \nand environmental management plans will be updated to address site-specific issues consistent \nwith  government  requirements  and  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  Mitigation \nmeasures  will  be  closely  monitored  based  on  the  environmental  management  plans.  An \nenvironmental  safeguard  specialist  will  assist  project  staff  in  complying  with  the  requirements \nand monitoring these procedures. \n \n26. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  C)  and  indigenous  peoples  (category  B).  The \nadditional financing project activities will not involve any involuntary acquisition of land or other \nassets.  Community-based  small-scale  infrastructure  will,  in  principle,  be  designed  on  existing \nrights-of-way or public land. Any acquisition of land and other assets will be based on voluntary \ncontribution.  The  procedural  guidelines  for  voluntary  land  contribution  have  been  prepared.31 \nEthnic  people  will  benefit  from  the  project  through  increased  agricultural  and  forestry \nproductivity and improved access to infrastructure and credits for better livelihood opportunities. \nParticipatory  village  development  planning,  supplemented  by  focus  group  discussions,  will \nfacilitate the participation of ethnic people in project activities in a socially acceptable manner. A \nsocial  safeguard  specialist,  in  collaboration  with  representatives  of  the  LFNC  and  LWU,  will \nassist project staff to comply with the requirements and to monitor the procedures. \n \nF. \n \n27. \nand impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n \n\nKey risks and mitigating measures32 are summarized in Table 4.
