Poverty reduction \nlargely  resulted  from  economic  growth,  which  created  jobs  and \nprovided  better \nlivelihoods.  To  ensure  continuing  poverty \nreduction and economic growth, the Government needs to lock-in \npolicy reforms, remove remaining structural weaknesses, promote \nsocially  inclusive  development,  and  modernize  governance  and \nthe public administration system.  \n\nThe CPRGS provides a framework  for poverty reduction policies, \nprograms, and actions in Viet Nam, and has been adopted as the \nreference document by the official development assistance (ODA) \nfor  planning  external  assistance.  Several  ODA \ncommunity \npartners  including  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  support \nthe  CPRGS.  The  CPRGS  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  poverty \nreduction  strategy;  and  its  country  strategy  and  program,  and \npoverty partnership agreement with Viet Nam.  \n \nWorld  Bank  support  includes  three  PRSCs,  approved  in  2002 \n(US$250  million),  2003  (US$100  million),  and  2004  (US$100 \nmillion). The focus of these operations has gradually shifted from \nreform  of  state-owned  commercial  banks  and  the  state-owned \nenterprise  (SOE)  sector  to  a  broader  policy  agenda,  covering  a \nnumber  of  sectors  and  issues  affecting  poverty  reduction  and \ngrowth in Viet Nam.  \n\nThe  ODA  community  in  Viet  Nam  considers  the  PRSC  a  useful \ninstrument for supporting CPRGS implementation. In 2004, major \nODA partners such as Canada, Denmark, European Commission, \nJapan,  Netherlands,  and  United  Kingdom  are  cofinancing  the \nPRSC III with the World Bank.  \n\n\fii\n\n \n\n       \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \nObjectives and Scope \n\nADB has been actively involved in formulating the PRSC III. ADB \nhas  promoted  policy  dialogue  on  similar  issues  through  its \nprogram lending activities and sector policy reforms. The PRSC III \ncomplements ADB support to Viet Nam for policy and institutional \nreform.  As  a  multisector  instrument  covering  a  range  of  issues \nrelated  to  poverty  reduction,  the  PRSC  framework  provides  ADB \nwith  an  opportunity  to  (i)  advance  and  widen  national  policy \ndialogue  in  a  well-coordinated  and  comprehensive  manner,  (ii) \nprovide  lending  and  nonlending  assistance  in  coordination  with \nother  ODA  partners,  and  (iii)  ensure  key  policy  issues  important \nfor  the  implementation  of  ADB  operations  in  Viet  Nam  are \nadequately  considered  and  addressed  in  the  policy  dialogue \nbetween the Government and the ODA community to help achieve \nthe common goal of poverty reduction and growth. \n\nThe  proposed  program  loan  adheres  to  ADB\u2019s  recent  endeavors \nto  adopt  program-based  and  sector  approaches  in  its  lending \noperations to reduce transaction costs for its developing member \ncountries  as  well  as  for  its  own  operations.  The  approach  is \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  reform  agenda;  Long-Term  Strategic \nFramework,  and  Medium-Term  Strategy,  and  will  directly  help \nfulfill  ADB\u2019s  obligations  to  the  Rome  Declaration  on  harmonizing \nprocedures of multilateral development banks. \n \n\nThe main goal of the program loan is to help reduce poverty and \nsustain high-level economic growth, as envisaged in the CPRGS. \nThe  purpose  is  to  provide  support  for  implementation  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  Program  within  the  policy \nframework  of  the  PRSC  III,  focusing  on  reducing  structural \nweaknesses  and  improving  business  environment  for  private \nsector  development,  promoting  socially  inclusive  development, \nand modernizing governance.  \n\nThe  program  loan  will  strengthen  Viet  Nam\u2019s  reform  program  on \nthree fronts: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nPromote  growth  and  create  employment  by  increasing \ninternal  and  external  competition,  accelerating \nthe \ndivestiture  of  SOEs  and  state-owned  commercial  banks, \nand  improving  transparency  and  accountability  in  SOE \noperations and in banking and the financial sector.  \nAdvance  human  development  by  increasing  the  budget \nappropriation  for  education  and  adopting  higher  quality \neducation  standards;  increasing  resources  to  cover  the \nhealth  care  costs  of  the  poor;  developing  mechanisms  to \ncomplete  the  transfer  of  land-use  rights  to  households, \nespecially  in  upland  and  ethnic  minority  areas;  and \nsupporting  measures  to  improve  environmental  and  water \nresources management.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n      \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n          \n\n \n\n \n         iii\n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n(iii) \n\ntransparency  and  accountability  of  public \nIncrease \nfinances;  promote  simplified  administrative  procedures, \nand  take  measures  to  eliminate  corruption  as  part  of  a \nbroader  effort  to  build  modern  governance;  and  revamp \nthe  planning  processes,  moving  away  from  a  command \napproach  to  aligning  policies  and  resources  with  the \nattainment  of  well-specified  development  goals  based  on \nempirical analysis and wider consultations. \n\nthe \n\nfinancing  gap \n\nThe  Government\u2019s  estimation  of \nfor \nimplementing  the  CPRGS  for  2004  is  US$3.3  billion.  ODA  and \nforeign  direct  investment  inflows  are  expected  to  meet  the \nfinancing gap. The estimated costs of some specific programs are \n(i) health funds for the poor\u2014 US$50 million annually for the next \n3  years;  (ii)  increase  in  spending  on  education  from  15.8%  to \n17.3%  of \nleast  US$20  million \nannually for 2004; and (iii) resolution of nonperforming loans and \nother  related  costs\u2014about  US$2  billion  in  total  throughout  the \nprogram. \n\nthe  Government  budget\u2014at \n\nA total of about US$178 million is expected to be funded through \nODA  resources  in  2004.  Led  by  the  World  Bank,  which  has \nalready  approved  a  US$100  million  credit  from  the  International \nDevelopment  Association \nIII,  other \ncofinanciers,  include  the  Canadian  International  Development \nAgency  (Can$6.3  million  grant),  Denmark  (US$10  million  grant), \nthe European Commission (\u20ac15 million grant), the Japan Bank for \nInternational  Cooperation \nloan), \nthe  United  Kingdom\u2019s \nNetherlands  (\u20ac4  million  grant),  and \nDepartment for International Development (\u20a420 million grant). \n\n(US$18  million  equivalent \n\nthe  PRSC \n\nto  support \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of US$6.4 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources will \nbe provided. The loan will have a 24-year term including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0 % during the grace period \nand  1.5  %  during  the  amortization  period,  and  such  other  terms \nand  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  The  loan \nproceeds  may  be  used  to  finance  eligible  imports  incurred  within \n180 days prior to the date of loan effectiveness. The loan reflects \nADB\u2019s  support  for  implementation  of  the  CPRGS  following  the \npolicy framework of the PRSC III program. The loan will contribute \nto financing the adjustment costs resulting from implementation of \nthe  policy  matrix,  particularly  the  prior  actions  for  the  PRSC  III, \nand  will  support  and  facilitate  the  Government\u2019s  continued  and \ndeepened reform program for poverty reduction. \n\n \nDisbursement \n\nThe loan will be disbursed in a single tranche upon declaration of \nloan effectiveness.  \n\n \nUtilization Period                  The loan will be fully utilized by 31 December 2005. \n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nExecuting Agency \n\nState Bank of Viet Nam, will be the Executing Agency, which also \nworks  in  close  collaboration  with  the  World  Bank  to  prepare  and \nimplement the PRSCs. \n\n \n \nImplementation  \nArrangements            \n \n\nProgram  management  comprises  three  main  arrangements.  In           \n2002,  the  National  Steering  Committee  was  established  to                        \n                                    implement the CPRGS and PRSCs. It  is  chaired by a first deputy                        \n\nprime minister  and the   standing vice-chair is a deputy governor \nof  the  SBV.  The  steering  committee  has  several  representatives \nfrom key economic ministries, such as the ministries of agriculture \nand  rural  development;  education  and  training;  finance;  justice; \nlabor,  invalids,  and  social  affairs;  and  trade;  as  well  as  Office  of \nthe  Government;  Party's  Economic  Commission;  and  SBV; \nrepresenting the PRSC III\u2019s policy reform areas.  \n\nAn interministerial working group and secretariat to implement and \nmonitor  the  CPRGS  has  been  established  at  the  Ministry  of \nPlanning  and  Investment.  The  group  comprises  representatives \nfrom  key  economic  ministries  that  represent  the  policy  reform \nareas  under \n  SBV  coordinates  PRSC \nIII. \nimplementation. \n\nthe  PRSC \n\nArrangements \n\n \nMonitoring and Reporting   Viet Nam continues to make good use of information and analysis \nin  policy  making  and  developing  individual  components  of  the \nPRSC program. The PRSC III builds on this experience, in terms \nof  streamlining  the  numerous  ongoing  monitoring  and  evaluation \ninitiatives.  Key  sources  of  monitoring  information  for  poverty  and \nprogram  outcomes  include  the  household  living  standard  survey, \nperiodic  participatory  poverty  and  governance  assessments,  the \nsmall  business  registration  survey,  public  expenditure  tracking \nsurvey, as well as quarterly progress reports from relevant sector \nministries  and  committees \nthe  PRSC  reform \nprogram.  \n\nimplementing \n\nIn addition, the strengthening of management information systems \nfor  SOEs  and  for  all  public  spending,  both  led  by  Ministry  of \nFinance,  is  an  integral  part  of  the  PRSC  program.  Efforts  for \nprovincial implementation of the CPRGS rely on the development \nof appropriate monitoring indicators as well. Gradually, the number \nof  indicators  has  been  narrowed  to  around  40,  roughly  100  less \nthan  when  the  process  started.  Many  of  the  indicators  in  this \nnarrower  set  will  be  generated  using  the  new  household  living \nstandard surveys (which began in 2002). It will also provide semi-\nannual progress reports on the proposed program loan. \n\nThe Government will prepare and present a semi-annual progress \nreport to ADB. ADB will participate in all joint assessments by the \nGovernment  and  development  partners  on  the  outcomes  of  the \nPRSC III and PRSC IV triggers (measures and actions). \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n      \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n          \n\n \n\n \n         v\n\nProcurement \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nSocial Issues \n\n \nProgram Benefits  \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \n\n The loan proceeds will be utilized in accordance with the simplified \ndisbursement  procedures  and  related  requirements  for  program \nloans.

The loan follows a program-based approach and is part of the jointly processed multi- \ndevelopment  partner-funded  Poverty  Reduction  Support  Credit  III  (PRSC  III)  in  support  of  the \nGovernment's Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS). The program \nframework is in Appendix1. \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\nDevelopment Objectives, Strategies, and Plans \n\n The  Government  of  Viet  Nam  believes  that  poverty  reduction  is  the  basic  element  in \n2. \nensuring social justice and sustainable growth, and that high and sustainable growth could bring \nabout  the  physical  energy  to  support  and  provide  opportunities  for  the  poor.  The  Government \ntherefore  places  poverty  reduction  as  an  overarching  objective  in  its  national  socioeconomic \ndevelopment process. To reaffirm its commitment to poverty reduction, the Government signed \na  poverty  reduction  partnership  agreement  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in  2002. \nThe Government also has committed to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. \n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  CPRGS  reflects  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  inclusive  economic  and  social \ndevelopment.  It  elaborates  all  general  objectives,  institutional  arrangements,  policies,  and \nprograms  of  the  10-year  Socioeconomic  Development  Strategy  (2001\u20132010)  and  5-year \nSocioeconomic  Development  Plan  (2001\u20132005)  with  detailed  specific  action  plans.  Unlike \nprevious  development  plans,  which followed  a  command  approach  to  economic  management, \nthe  CPRGS  is  based  on  empirical  analysis  and  broad  consultation.  It  spells  out  clear \ndevelopment goals, identifies the policies to attain them, aligns resources to those policies, and \nestablishes  an  appropriate  monitoring  and  evaluation  system.  In  2003,  the  CPRGS  was \nexpanded  to  address  issues  related  to  large-scale  infrastructure  and  poverty  reduction.  The \nthree  main  pillars  of  the  CPRGS  are  (i)  completing  the  transition  to  a  market  economy,  (ii) \nkeeping  development  inclusive  and  sustainable,  and  (iii)  building  modern  governance.  These \nare  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy1\u2014pro-poor  growth,  social  development \nand  good  governance;  and  its  country  strategy  and  program  (2002\u20132004)2  and  poverty \npartnership  agreement  with  Viet  Nam.3  The  CPRGS  is  widely  recognized  as  a  blueprint  for \ndevelopment with strong national ownership. The CPRGS approach will be mainstreamed into \nthe  next  5-year  development  plan,  to  be  issued  in  2006.  Details  on  the  CPRGS  are  given  in \nAppendix 2. \n\nB. \n\nRecent Economic Performance  \n\n \n\n4. \nViet Nam continues to enjoy robust economic growth and impressive poverty reduction. \nThe  economy  doubled  in  size  during  the  last  decade,  while  the  poverty  rate  was  halved.  Per \ncapita  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  grew  by  around  6%  per  year  on  average  during  that \nperiod, in spite of the Asian financial crisis. GDP increased by 7.1% in 2003, and is expected to \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1999. ADB\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy. Manila.  \n2 ADB. 2002.

Social indicators \nimproved markedly, indicating Viet Nam is well-positioned to attain key Millennium Development \nGoals.  Poverty  reduction  has  always  been  underpinned  by  reasonably  rapid,  stable,  and \ninclusive economic growth. A recent joint poverty assessment study indicates that the elasticity \nof poverty reduction has been higher than one, e.g., a growth rate of per capita output of about \n6%  was  associated  with  reduction  in  poverty  of  about  7%.  However,  the  rate  of  poverty \nreduction has slowed in recent years (2 percentage points) from that of the first half of the last \ndecade (4 percentage points).5 Poverty reduction is slow or unchanged in northern mountains, \ncentral highlands, and in pockets of the Red River and Mekong deltas, contributing to regional \nincome disparity. Poverty incidence is perpetual and chronic in cross-border areas.  \n \n6. \nAlthough  Viet  Nam  (like  many  other  countries  in  the  region)  has  had  high  economic \ngrowth rates, about 29% of the population still lives in poverty. Addressing the poverty of these \npeople will be more difficult than before because of their remote location.6 Poverty  in some of \nthese  regions,  such  as  the  Central  Highlands,  is  entrenched;  social  tensions  and  instability \n\n                                                 \n4 ADB. 2004.

Hanoi. \n\n6  In addition, the benefits from allocating land to households are already generally realized.  \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n2.  \n\nThe Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy  \n\ncould  place  additional  obstacles  for  economic  growth.  Any  trickle-down  effect,  if  and  when  it \nhappens,  may  come  too  late  for  these  areas  and  poor  people.  Thus  a  carefully  targeted \napproach (in terms of planning and delivery) will be required to reduce poverty. \n \nPoverty reduction efforts must (i) focus on high impact and sustainable poverty reduction \n7. \nprograms and projects (i.e., asset creating and/or income-generating activities); and (ii) improve \naccess to markets through infrastructure development, and basic health and education services \nto poor people and their children. Forests, water resources, and tourism/ecotourism should and \ncan play an important role in moving, and keeping, these communities out of poverty. \n \n \n \nIn  May  2002,  Viet  Nam  embarked  on  CPRGS  implementation.  The  CPRGS  was \n8. \nprepared  with  support  of  the  development  assistance  community,  including  ADB,  and  in \nconsultation with stakeholders and civil society (Appendix 2 provides details). Implementation of \nthe  policy  reform  agenda  as  stipulated  in  the  CPRGS,  has  been  largely  through  pooling  of \nofficial  development  assistance  (ODA)  resources,  both  grant  and  lending,  under  the  PRSC \nframework,  prepared  by  the  development  partners  in  close  consultation  with  government \nagencies, and the Government\u2019s own resources. The World Bank leads the PRSC reviews and \nprocessing, with active participation by other major development partners, including ADB. The \nfocus of these operations has gradually shifted from narrowly defined structural reform, such as \nthe  reform  of  state-owned  commercial  banks  (SOCBs)  and  the  state-owned  enterprise  (SOE) \nsector  to  a  broader  and  deeper  policy  reform  agenda,  encompassing  the  three  pillars  of  the \nCPRGS and embracing many sectors and issues related to sustainable poverty reduction and \neconomic growth.  \n \n9. \nThe  Government  has  well-established  coordinating,  monitoring,  and  oversight \narrangements for poverty reduction programs funded by various ODA resources. The National \nSteering Committee, established in September 2002, is chaired by a deputy prime minister, with \na deputy governor of the State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV) as standing deputy chair. Its members \ncome from  all concerned government ministries and agencies. The steering committee guides \nimplementation of the poverty reduction programs under the CPRGS, the International Monetary \nFund\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Facility,7  and  the  PRSC.  The  Government  undertakes \ndetailed  reviews  of  implementation  progress  of  the  CPRGS  reform  agenda,  and  discusses \nfindings  and  emerging  issues  with  its  development  assistance  partners,  usually  at  the  annual \nConsultative Group meeting.  \n \nB. \n \n \n \n10. \nOverall, CPRGS progress has been significant, but important structural issues and social \nchallenges  need  to  be  addressed.  Regarding  the  transition  to  a  market  economy,  the  reform \nagenda  has  relied  on  restructuring  the  state  sector,  and  not  on  massive  divestiture.  Important \nsteps have been undertaken, especially in terms of liberalizing trade and fostering competition. \nBut  addressing  hard  budget  constraints  faced  by  the  SOEs  has  proved  more  difficult.  On  the \nsocial side, regional disparities may widen as Viet Nam integrates with the world economy. Also, \nethnic minorities have benefited less from economic growth than the majority of the population. \n\nProcess and Implementation Performance \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n1.  \n\n                                                \n7  The Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility ended on 12 April 2004. The International Monetary Fund continues its \n\n \n\npresence in the country, providing advice to the Government on macroeconomic management and tax issues. \n\n\f 4\n\nThe  effective  delivery  of  social  services  to  the  poor,  especially  for  disadvantaged  regions  and \nethnic  minorities,  is  essential  to  keep  development  inclusive.  But  reform  in  the  social  sectors \nrequires changes in their financing, and needs to be carefully sequenced and aligned with the \ndecentralization  process.  As  for  governance,  institutional  reform  lags  the  rapid  economic \ntransition,  creating  opportunities  for  abuse.  The  Government  has  recently  taken  measures  to \nstrengthen  the  State  Inspectorate  and  State  Audit.  An  ambitious  initiative  to  strengthen  public \nfinancial  management  is  under  way.  But  considerable  weaknesses  persist  in  the  selection  of \npublic  investment  projects;  in  the  integration  of  capital  and  recurrent  expenditures;  and  in  the \nsupervision of project implementation, especially at the local level. Weak financial management \nsystems  and  insufficient  transparency  create  the  risk  of  inefficiency  in  the  allocation  of \nresources, mismanagement, and corruption. \n \nIn 2003 major movements and initiatives were undertaken on a broad range of reforms, \n11.  \nespecially in relation to integrating with the world economy, permitting public investment in large \nSOEs  and  SOCBs,  and  designing  a  new  approach  to  fight  corruption.  The  Government  is \ncommitted  to  following  these  activities  through  as  they  promise  to  solidify  and  accelerate  the \nneeded  reforms.  The  Government  is  also  committed  to  adopting  a  more  decisive  stance  on \nbanking reform. As part of this, the Government will outline a clear separation of the functions of \nSBV  as  owner  of  commercial  banks  and  supervisor  of  the  system,  and  take  actions  to \nrestructure the SOCBs and improve their credit culture. The Government recognizes that for it to \nincrease lending from the ODA community, it will need to expedite implementation of its recent \ndecision  on  accession  to  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO);  increase  private  sector \ninvestment  in  large  SOEs  and  SOCBs;  tackle  directed  lending;  and  make  progress  on \ngovernance  and  public  administration  reforms,  the  anticorruption  agenda,  as  well  as  financial \nsector reform.  \n \n\n2. \n\nCountry Strategy and Program of the Asian Development Bank \n\n \n\nADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy is based on three pillars: (i) pro-poor economic growth, \n12. \n(ii) social development, and (iii) good governance. ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program for Viet \nNam,  approved  in  January  2002,  emphasizes  (i)  generating  economic  growth  and  new \nemployment  through  private  sector  development;  (ii)  improving  governance  and  public \nadministration;  and  (iii)  paying  attention  to  socially  inclusive  development  and  focusing  on  the \ncentral region, where the incidence of poverty remains high (footnote 2).  \n \n13. \nThe  joint  poverty  assessment  completed  in  2003  by  the  Government  and  a  number  of \ndevelopment  partners,  including  ADB,8  confirmed  that  economic  growth  continues  to  reduce \npoverty in Viet Nam, but that since the pace of poverty reduction is slowing, targeting of the poor \nis becoming more necessary. At the same time, to deal successfully with the accelerating pace \nof  international  economic  integration,  Viet  Nam  needs  to  modernize  its  economy  and \ninstitutions, and accelerate investment (to an estimated 35% of GDP). Faster growth, which is \nlikely  to  benefit  the  more  advanced  areas,  will  need  to  be  accompanied  by  measures  to \ndistribute the benefits of growth, including targeting on poor areas and groups.  \n\n3. \n\nLessons Learned  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\na. \n\nMulti-Development Partner Supported Poverty Reduction Programs \n\n                                                 \n8  World  Bank.  2003.

The PRSC I was a two-tranche US$250 million credit from the \nInternational  Development  Association  approved  by \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s  interim  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper.  The  PRSC  I  was  a  structural  reform \nprogram  focusing  on  (i)  liberalizing  trade,  (ii)  reforming  SOEs,  (iii)  strengthening  banking,  (iv) \nimproving the private sector environment, and (v) improving management and transparency in \npublic  finance.  It  was  cofinanced  by  four  bilateral  funding  agencies  with  grants  equivalent  to \nUS$43  million  (Denmark\u2014DKr78  million;  Netherlands\u2014\u20ac15  million;  Sweden\u2014\u20ac2  million;  and \nUnited Kingdom\u2014\u20a414 million).9 The PRSC II, was a one-tranche operation for a US$100 million \ncredit  from  the  International  Development  Association,  approved  by  the  World  Bank  in  June \n2003. In addition to continued support for structural reforms, the PRSC II had a broader policy \nreform  agenda,  including  inclusive  development  and  building  modern  governance.  It  was \ncofinanced  by  three  development  agencies  with  the  equivalent  grant  of  US$31  million \n(Denmark\u2014 DKr19 million, Netherlands\u2014\u20ac8 million, and United Kingdom\u2014\u20a410 million.  \n \n15. \nThe  assessment  of  the  first  two  PRSC  programs  showed  that  progress  was  achieved \nwithin  most  sectors,  but  with  room  for  improvement,  particularly  for  SOE  and  financial  sector \nreform.  Reducing  SOE  budgets  and  strengthening  incentives  for  restructuring  were  the  main \noutstanding  issues  facing  the  SOE  sector.  In  the  financial  sector,  progress  was  uneven.  The \nprogress in reforming the SOCBs, including the resolution of nonperforming loans was slow and \nnot transparent. Directed lending increased rapidly through the Development Assistance Fund, \nwhile the ability of credit risk assessment improved rather slowly. Improving the quality of new \ncredit  remained  a  key  issue  in  banking  reform.  Broadening  the  program  scope  from  structural \nadjustment to a comprehensive poverty reduction and growth program was recommended. \n \n \n \n16. \nLessons from the experience of previous program loans and postevaluation studies are \nthat  (i)  continued  ownership  and  commitment  of  government  are  fundamental  to  achieving \ndevelopment outcomes; (ii) monitoring and evaluation should be based on both process (inputs \nand outputs) and outcome indicators; (iii) outcome indicators will depend on successful follow-\non actions (as passage of a decree or law alone will not produce any meaningful results if the \nlaw  is  not  brought  into  effect  (which  will  require  regulations,  circulars,  etc.,)  and  proper \nenforcement  (which  will  require  institutional  capabilities);  and  (iv)  sector  or  subsector-based \nprogram loans have limited scope to address economy-wide policy and institutional issues. \n \n\nAsian Development Bank Policy-Based Lending \n\nb. \n\n \n\n4. \n\nJustification for the Poverty Reduction Support Credit III \n\nthe  business  environment,  (ii)  making  development  socially \n\n \n17. \nThe PRSC III aims to address three key areas of macro policy and institutional reforms \nfor  (i)  supporting  the  transition  to  a  market  economy  by  removing  structural  weaknesses  and \ninclusive  and \nimproving \nenvironment  friendly,  and  (iii)  modernizing  governance  and  the  public  administration  system. \nThe preparation of the PRSC III was expected to build on the foundations of the existing strong \nODA  community\u2019s  commitment  to  support  Viet  Nam\u2019s  reform  agenda  through  nationwide \nimplementation  of  the  CPRGS,  and  galvanize  interest  for  the  reform  program  among \nstakeholders.  Increasingly  development  partners  have  united  around  the  PRSC  as  an \ninstrument  for  policy  dialogue.  They  have  already  been  actively  involved  in  supporting \nimplementation  of  the  reform  agenda,  through  analytical  work,  technical  assistance,  project \nlending, and direct budget support. The PRSCs, including the PRSC III, fall in the last category. \n                                                 \n9  DKr = Danish kroner, \u20ac = euro, \u20a4 = pound sterling.  \n\n\f 6\n\nThe rationale for direct budget support comes from the external financing requirements of Viet \nNam,  estimated  at  about  US$3.3  billion  in  2004,  to  be  met  mainly  through  disbursements  of \nODA and foreign direct investment inflows. Some of the policy actions supported by the PRSC \nprocess entail a substantial additional burden on the budget. Among these are recapitalization \nof  SOCBs,  operation  of  a  safety  net  for  workers  who  become  redundant  as  a  result  of  SOE \nrestructuring,  expansion  of  budget  appropriations  for  the  education  sector,  and  creation  of \nprovincial health care funds for the poor.  \n\nIII \n\nfor \n\nThe \n\njustification \n\nthe  PRSC \n\nis  grounded  on \n\nthree  criteria:  (i)  prudent \n18. \nmacroeconomic management to ensure that progress with the long-term reform agenda will not \nbe undermined by short-term instability; (ii) the Government\u2019s own assessment of the progress \naccomplished in CPRGS implementation; and (iii) the reform triggers (measures and actions) for \nthe  PRSC  III  (established  with  the  PRSC  II),  need  to  be  met,  except  for  unforeseen \ncircumstances.  \n \nThe  International  Monetary  Fund\u2019s  assessment  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economic  performance10 \n19. \nconfirmed the country\u2019s solid macroeconomic performance. The Governments\u2019 progress report11 \non  CPRGS  implementation  was  presented  to  the  Consultative  Group  meeting  in  December \n2003. The report highlights the accomplishments in reform implementation (e.g., opening of the \neconomy,  more  favorable  investment  climate,  better  public  financial  management,  substantial \npoverty reduction, and attainment of the Millennium Development Goals), but it also points out \nbottlenecks  in  structural  reform  and  key  outstanding  social  issues  (e.g.,  growing  inequalities, \npoverty  among  ethnic  minorities,  rural-urban  migrants,  and  challenges  in  promoting  good \ngovernance  and  combating  corruption.  The  joint  staff  assessment  of  the  CPRGS  led  by  the \nWorld Bank and observations by other key development partners acknowledges the frankness \nin  reporting  and  also  notes  the  challenges.  The  assessment  indicates  that  the  progress  was \ngenerally satisfactory or highly satisfactory for all triggers related to the second (social inclusion \nand environmental sustainability) and third (modern governance) pillars, while the progress was \nnoted  markedly  uneven  in  relation  to  the  first  pillar  (transition  to  a  market  economy).  Slow \nprogress was noted for SOE and SOCB reforms. \n \n\n5. \n\nRationale for the Proposed Program Loan \n\n \n20. \nThe  PRSC  III,  which  was  jointly  processed  by  major  development  partners  including \nADB, further deepens the reforms supported by the PRSCs I and II, and the Poverty Reduction \nand Growth Facility. The policy actions it endorses are all firmly rooted in the three pillars of the \nCPRGS.  It  also  identifies  actions  to  support  the  unfinished  reform  agenda,  including  the \npreparations  for  WTO  accession,  opening  of  the  equity  capital  of  large  SOEs  and  SOCBs  to \nprivate  investors,  progress  in  planning  processes  and  public  financial  management,  and  the \nmove  toward  a  more  systemic  approach  to  addressing  corruption.  In  addition,  the  PRSC  III \npolicy agenda includes several measures to promote socially inclusive economic development. \nThese are consistent with ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy, Country Strategy and Program for \nViet Nam, and poverty reduction agreement with Viet Nam. \n\n \nCPRGS implementation supported by PRSC program is expected to lead to substantial \n21. \nimprovements  in  development  outcomes.  The  current  PRSC-cycle  covers  5  years,  much  the \n\n                                                 \n10 The letter of assessment prepared by the International Monetary Fund to accompany the PRSC III.

While the reform program focuses on a set of strategic policy actions, its \nimplementation should translate into improved economic and social indicators. The preparatory \nwork  for  the  PRSC  III  commenced  late  in  2003.  In  the  area  of  diagnostics,  the  poverty \nassessment12  using  both  2003  household  data  and  participatory  poverty  assessments  was  a \nmajor  accomplishment.  The  PRSC  III  was  processed  during  the  first  quarter  of  2004.  ADB \nparticipated in the diagnostic exercise on poverty as well as in the formulation of the PRSC III.  \n \n22. \nThe ODA community has adopted the CPRGS as their reference document for planning \nexternal assistance for the country. The focus of these operations has gradually broadened to \ninclude all the essential pillars of poverty reduction and sustainable economic growth, and are \nincorporated in PRSC programs. The ODA community in Viet Nam considers the PRSC a useful \ninstrument  in  support  of  CPRGS  implementation.  Six  development  assistance  partners\u2014\nCanada, Denmark, European Commission, Japan, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom\u2014are \ncofinancing the PRSC III with the World Bank in 2004. Appendix 3 provides the aid coordination \nmatrix. \n \nADB  has  promoted  policy  dialogue  in  Viet  Nam  on  similar  issues  at  the  sector  level \n23. \nthrough  its  program  lending  activities  (such  as  loans  for  the  Agriculture  Sector  Program, \nFinancial Sector Program I and Public Administration Reform Program Cluster in 2003; and the \nSmall-  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprise  Development  and  Financial  Sector  Program  II  in  2004). \nThe  PRSC  III,  which  has  an  economy-wide  reform  agenda  at  the  national  level,  complements \nthese ADB assisted activities. \n       \n24. \nAs a multisector instrument covering a range of issues related to poverty reduction, the \nPRSC  would  provide  ADB  with  an  opportunity  to  (i)  advance  policy  dialogue  in  a  well-\ncoordinated  manner  with  other  relevant  ODA  partners  of  Viet  Nam,  and  (ii)  ensure  that  key \npolicy issues for implementation of ADB operations in Viet Nam are adequately considered and \naddressed in the policy dialogue between Government and the ODA community. The proposed \nprogram  loan  thus  has  strategic  importance  that  would  not  ensue  from  sector-or  subsector-\nbased program loans. \n \n25. \nTo  reduce  transaction  costs  for  the  Government  and  the  participating  development \npartners in a rather complex operation, the proposed loan pursues a program-based approach. \nThis approach is in line with ADB\u2019s recent move and practices toward adopting program-based \nand  sector  approaches  in  its  lending  operations  to  reduce  transaction  costs  for  its  developing \nmember  countries  as  well  as  for  its  own  operations.  The  approach  is  not  only  consistent  with \nADB\u2019s reform agenda,13 Long-Term Strategic Framework, and Medium-Term Strategy, but also \nwill directly help fulfill ADB\u2019s obligations to the Rome Declaration on harmonizing procedures of \nmultilateral development banks. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n \n A. \n \n26. \nThe  overall  goal  of  the  program  loan  is  to  help  Viet  Nam  reduce  poverty  and  sustain \nhigh-level economic growth, as envisaged in the CPRGS. The main purpose is to support the \nGovernment\u2019s Poverty Reduction Program under the policy framework of the PRSC III, together  \n\n                                                 \n12  World  Bank.  2004.

To \nreduce poverty and sustain rapid economic growth, the program loan will strengthen Viet Nam\u2019s \nreform program on three main fronts: \n \n\nPromote  growth  and  create  employment  by  increasing  internal  and  external \ncompetition,  accelerating  the  divestiture  of  SOEs  and  SOCBs,  and  improving \ntransparency  and  accountability  in  SOE  operations,  banking,  and  the  financial \nsector.  \n\nAdvance  human  development  by  increasing  the  budget  appropriation  for \neducation  and  increase  education  standards;  providing  resources  to  cover  the \nhealth care costs of the poor; developing mechanisms to complete the transfer of \nland-use  rights  to  households,  especially  in  upland  and  ethnic  minority  areas; \nand providing support measures to improve environmental and water resources \nmanagement.  \n\nIncrease  transparency  and  accountability  of  public  finances;  promote  simplified \nadministrative procedures, and work to decrease corruption as part of a broader \neffort  to  build  modern  governance;  and  revamp  the  planning  processes  by \nmoving away from a command approach to aligning policies and resources with \nthe  attainment  of  well-specified  development  goals  based  on  empirical  analysis \nand wider consultations.  \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n B. \n \n27. \nPreparatory  work  to  formulate  the  PRSC  III,  aiming  to  support  the  Government  with \nCPRGS  implementation,  was  initiated  in  November  2003  with  the  participation  of  key \ndevelopment  assistance  partners  and  government  agencies.14  ADB  as  a  key  development \npartner  was  invited  and  participated  in  the  preparation  of  the  PRSC  III,  including  in  the  policy \ndiscussions, program formulation, and program negotiations with the Government, even though \nADB could not confirm if Special Funds resources would be available to allow cofinancing. SBV \ncoordinated  the  overall  processing  of  the  PRSC  III  on  behalf  of  the  Government,  while  World \nBank took the lead for the development partners (Appendix 2 provides summary details on the \nformulation of the program loan).  \n \nThe policy framework of the PRSC III includes both deepening and broadening reforms \n28. \nunder the three pillars: (i) transition to a market economy, (ii) social inclusion and environmental \nsustainability, and (iii) modern governance. Pillar I covers five sectors for policy reform actions: \ntrade  integration,  SOE  reform,  financial  sector  reform,  private  sector  development,  and \ninfrastructure. Pillar II includes sectors such as education, health, land, water, and environment. \nWhile pillar III focuses on sectors and activities related to improving governance, i.e., planning \nprocess, public financial management, financial accountability, public administration reform, and \nanticorruption. The policy matrix is presented in Appendix 4 and the development policy letter in \nAppendix  5.  The  achievement  of  prior  actions  as  outlined  in  Appendix  4  is  summarized  in  the \nfollowing paragraphs. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n14  Adapted from the jointly processed PRSC III report. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\n1. \n\nPillar I: Transition to a Market Economy  \n\nThe  21  actions  relate  to  the  Government\u2019s  work  to  reduce  inherent  structural \n29. \nweaknesses in trade, SOEs, and the financial sector; and improve the business environment. 15 \nA key input for the negotiations for WTO accession is the preparation of detailed strategies for \ntariff  changes,  including  an  assessment  of  sector  impacts,  and  proposed  timing  for  their \nimplementation.  But  more  importantly,  these  strategies  present  a  vision  for  the  long-term \nstructure  of  protection.  This  is  a  vision  where  average  tariffs  are  low,  most  nontariff  barriers \nhave  been  removed,  and  few  sectors  enjoy  high  protection  rates.  Several  policy  actions \nundertaken over the last year keep moving the economy in that direction. \n\n30. \nQuantitative restrictions on the imports of petroleum products were removed. Under the \nPRSC III, tariffs on 484 items imported from the Peoples Republic of China, mostly agricultural \nand  fisheries  products,  were  lowered  under  the  Early  Harvest  Program,  which  was  a  step \ntoward  implementation  of  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations-China  Free  Trade \nAgreement. Separately, several regulations were made WTO compliant last year. They refer to \ncustoms valuation and to the application of the harmonized classification and coding system on \na multilateral basis. \n\n31. \nTransformation  of  SOE  ownership  has  been  a  major  policy  reform  area  under  the \nprevious  PRSCs.  Under  the  PRSC  I,  improvements  in  the  overall  framework  for  enterprise \ndivestiture,  including  the  setup  of  a  social  safety  net  for  redundant  SOE  workers,  were \nsatisfactorily completed. This allowed the meeting of cautious targets for enterprise divestiture \nby the end of the PRSC I. Since then the number of SOEs included in officially approved plans \nfor transformation has increased substantially. The program supported from the PRSC II onward \nis  based  on  a  series  of  104  SOE  reform  plans  prepared  by  line  ministries,  provincial \ngovernments,  and  government  corporations.  Unlike  previous  blueprints  for  SOE  reform,  these \nplans,  which  identify  the  SOEs  to  be  divested  by  name  and  indicate  a  specific  year  for  the \nownership  transformation  to  be  carried  out,  are  in  the  public  domain.  The  overall  aim  is  to \nequitize,  sell,  or  liquidate  around  2,400  SOEs,  employing  roughly  0.4  million  workers,  over  3 \nyears. \n\n32. \nProgress in the planned SOE transformations is being monitored with monthly reporting \non  the  number  and  names  of  the  concerned  SOEs.  The  monitoring  scheme  also  puts  under \nsurveillance  the  creation  of  new  SOEs,  and  of  joint-stock  companies  involving  SOEs.  Timely \nimplementation of ownership transformations under the new SOE reform plans was considered \na trigger for the PRSC III. According to the National Steering Committee for Enterprise Reform \nand Development, 814 SOEs were transformed in 2003. This includes 649 SOE transformations \napproved  under  the  104  reform  plans  and  165  approved  prior  to  the  104  restructuring  plans. \nThe  corresponding  figures  are  somewhat  smaller  if  transformations  are  only  considered \ncomplete  after  the  first  shareholders  meeting  is  held  and  the  enterprise  is  registered.  But  the \naverage  lead  time  between  transaction  approval  and  business  registration  has  remained  fairly \nconstant at around 90 days over the past 3 years. By either measure, 2003 was by far the best \nyear in terms of numbers of SOEs transformed: a 95% increase over 2002 as measured by the \nNational  Steering  Committee  for  Enterprise  Reform  and  Development,  and  a  60%  increase  in \n\n                                                \n15  ADB  is  supporting  nonbanking  financial  sector  development  and  small  and  medium  enterprise  development \nthrough  program  loans  and  technical  assistance.  The  World  Bank  is  supporting  public  financial  management \nreform through a separate credit. \n\n \n\n\f 10\n\nterms of business registrations. Figures for the first 4 months of 2004 confirm the acceleration in \nthe transformation of ownership. Admittedly, actual transformations fall short of the targets set in \nthe  104  reform  plans.  But  this  is  partly  due  to  slippages  in  approval  of  the  plans,  which  took \nplace only by mid-2003. \n\n33. \nSo  far,  the  reform  of  large  SOEs,  including  government  corporations,  has  focused  on \nmaking them more competitive. However, the 9th Plenum of the 9th Party Congress approved \nthe equitization of large SOEs. The subsectors likely to be covered include electricity, post and \ntelecommunications,  chemicals,  metallurgy,  banking,  and  insurance.  Shares  in  these  entities \ncould  be  sold  to  outsiders  and  the  valuations  of  the  enterprises  should  be  based  on  market \nvalues. In March 2004, the Ministry of Planning and Investment identified the legal documents to \nbe promulgated, amended, or supplemented to prepare for transformation of the larger SOEs, \nas well as speed up equitization of smaller ones. In parallel, guidelines for the operation of the \ncentral Debts and Assets Trading Company have been issued. The Debts and Assets Trading \nCompany  was  set  up  on  a  pilot  basis  under  the  PRSC  II  due  to  the  lack  of  appropriate \nmechanisms \ntheir  own  asset \nmanagement companies, they currently lack the power to reach foreclosure, seize assets, and \nforce  enterprise  liquidation  if  necessary.  The  Debts  and  Assets  Trading  Company,  with  a \nplanned chartered capital of D2 trillion, is to be operated on a pilot basis first, covering 20 SOEs \nwith bad debts amounting to about D1.5 trillion. Of these 20 SOEs, 12 will be equitized, 6 will be \ntransformed into one-member limited liability companies, one will pass on to the ownership of its \nworkers, and one is to be merged. \n\nloan  resolution.  While  SOCBs  have \n\nfor  nonperforming \n\n34. \nProgress has been slower with monitoring of SOE performance. In the past, few SOEs \ncomplied  with  existing  reporting  obligations.  Decision  271/2003/QD-TTg,  issued  under  the \nPRSC  II,  establishes  administrative  sanctions  for  lack  of  compliance  and  instructs  the \nclassification of SOEs in one of three categories depending on their earnings, returns on state \nequity,  and  ability  to  service  their  debts.  Actual  classification  is  expected  to  start  in  late  2004. \nEnterprises that are classified as bad performers for 2 years in a row are in principle subject to \nreorganization,  including  changes  in  management.  SOEs  that  do  not  submit  their  financial \nreports in a timely manner can be fined. These sanctions on delayed reporting will in turn serve \nas a basis to evaluate and classify SOE performance. \n\n35. \nBanking reform has been the main focus of financial sector reform. A plan was issued for \nthe  international  integration  of  banking  and  SBV  reform,  in  light  of  WTO  accession.  The  plan \nseeks to amend, supplement, revise, and eliminate legal documents and policies unsuitable for \ninternational  integration  commitments.  It  envisages  actions  to  strengthen  the  supervisory \ncapacity of SBV, and move the supervision of banks closer to international practices, including \nthe  implementation  of  a  rating  system  based  on  capital  assets  management,  earnings,  and \nliquidity. It also foresees the completion of modern payment and financial information systems in \nthe sector. In parallel, the four largest SOCBs  have developed new credit manuals, which will \nprovide  the  banks  with  the  critical  foundation  to  improve  credit  and  overall  risk  management \nupon implementation \n\nOther  policy  actions  in  this  area  aim  at  increasing  transparency  and  accountability.  A \n36. \nnew  chart  of  accounts  for  banks  was  adopted  in  early  2004.  This  new  chart,  and  new \nregulations  on  accounting  and  bank  reporting  policies  are  close  to  international  accounting \nstandards. A 60-day limit was imposed on the negotiation of international accounting standards \naudit by the SOCBs. The four largest SOCBs have been subjected to international accounting \nstandards since the PRSC I. However, release of the audits has sometimes been delayed, by \nmore than 9 months because of negotiations with SOCBs on the qualifications of the audits. \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nEqually significant are the plans to equitize two SOCBs, with a strategic investor for one \n37. \nof them. The Government had already announced its intention to equitize the smallest SOCB, \nMekong Housing Bank, under PRSC II. This equitization is scheduled to take place by 2005 and \nwill  involve  the  participation  of  an  international  strategic  investor.  More  recently,  the  Prime \nMinister\u2019s Directive No. 11/2004/CT-TTg, on the acceleration of SOE restructuring, also directed \nSBV,  in  coordination  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  to  submit  draft  equitization  plans  for \nthe  Viet  Nam  Commercial  Bank  for  Foreign  Trade  and  Mekong  Housing  Bank.  The  Viet  Nam \nCommercial Bank for Foreign Trade is one of the largest and most profitable SOCBs. Whether \nthe  equitization  will  aim  at  raising  capital  only,  or  will  also  serve  to  strengthen  corporate \ngovernance, remains to be seen. \n\n38. \nPolicy  (i.e.,  directed)  lending  was  formally  separated  from  the  commercial  banking \nsystem  under  the  PRSC  I,  but  it  continued  to  grow  at  a  rapid  pace.  The  Development \nAssistance Fund expanded considerably over the last 3 years and remains a significant vehicle \nfor  routing  financial  support  to  SOEs.  The  issuance  of  Decree  106/2004/ND-CP,  which \nregulates  the  operation  of  the  Development  Assistance  Fund,  is  an  important  step  toward \nproviding  a  sound  regulatory  framework  for  such  policy  lending.  The  decree  states  that  only \nprojects that are capable of direct repayment, have socioeconomic efficiency, and have feasible \nbusiness  or  production  plans,  are  eligible  for  Development  Assistance  Fund  support.  The \ndecree also stresses that project assets are to be used as security, and those assets cannot be \nassigned,  disposed,  mortgaged,  or  pledged  until  loans  are  fully  repaid.  An  element  of  risk-\nsharing, through copayments by other government bodies or by commercial banks, is also built \ninto the decree.  \n\nthe  Government \n\nSteps  have  been  taken  over  the  last  year  to  boost  the  nascent  securities  market.  In \n39. \nNovember  2003 \nlisting \nrequirements  for  firms.  The  minimum  capitalization  requirement  for  firms  was  halved  to  D5 \nbillion.  Joint-stocks  banks  with  a  charter  capital  of  D70  billion  or  more,  at  least  5  years  in \noperation,  2  consecutive  years  of  profits  in  the  last  2  years,  and  a  nonperforming  loan  ratio \nbelow 3%, can be listed as well. A new regulatory framework for security investment funds was \napproved,  and  in  March  2004  the  Viet  Nam  State  Securities  Commission  licensed  the  first  of \nthose funds, creating a new investment channel for both domestic and foreign investors. \n\nissued  Decree  144/2003/ND-CP,  easing \n\nthe \n\n40. \nReforms  related  to  private  sector  development  aim  to  build  the  legal  foundations  of  a \nmarket  economy  and  ensure  equitable  opportunities.  The  unification  of  the  corporate  tax  rate, \nirrespective of ownership, was one move toward the equal treatment of enterprises regardless \nof  their  institutional  nature.  The  new  tax  rate  of  28%  lowered  the  tax  rate  on  domestic  private \nenterprises  from  32%  and  increased  the  tax  rate  previously  levied  on  foreign  invested \nenterprises from 25%. At the same time the supplementary income tax for domestic enterprises \nwas eliminated, along with the profit remittance tax for foreign invested enterprises. The policy \nof phasing out dual pricing for public utilities is another welcome move in this direction. Under \nDecree 164, tax incentives to foreign and local companies were harmonized. The strengthening \nof  the  administration  of  intellectual  property  rights  substantially  shortens  the  processing  time \nfrom application to actual registration or rejection. \n\n41. \nA new legal framework for the organization, operation, and management of associations \nwas adopted in 2003. Decree 88/2003/ND-CP signals the Government\u2019s stronger interest in the \nrole  and  development  of  business  associations.  While  Decree  88  provides  a  more \ncomprehensive  and  transparent  legal  framework,  it  may  not  be  well  suited  to  the  needs  of  all \nnongovernment organizations. Consultation and legislative work may be needed in this area. \n\n\f 12\n\nIn  infrastructure,  the  expansion  of  the  CPRGS  to  include  large-scale  infrastructure \n42. \nrepresents a change in the Government\u2019s approach to public investment. In the past, the public \ninvestment  program  was  a  compilation  of  projects  by  line  ministries,  provinces,  and  SOEs, \nwithout  much  screening  or  overall  coherence.  While  feasibility  studies  were  conducted  in  the \ncase  of  large  projects,  no  assessment  was  made  of  benefits  and  costs,  growth,  or  poverty \nreduction impacts. The separation between capital and recurrent expenditures usually resulted in \npoor  maintenance.  Environmental  impacts  were  not  systematically  conducted,  the  handling  of \nresettlement was controversial at times, project management raised considerable fiduciary risks, \nand community participation and supervision was limited in the case of local projects. The new \nchapter on large-scale infrastructure, added to the CPRGS in 2003, is expected to serve as the \nbasis for a gradual strengthening of the institutional mechanisms supporting public investment. \n \nAn encouraging shift to modern regulation of competition and pricing policies is occurring \n43. \nin  telecommunications.  For  infrastructure  services,  the  Government  needs  to  move  from  a \nmodel  with  a  single  public  provider,  sometimes  leading  to  high  user  costs,  to  a  modern \nregulation  of  competition  and  pricing.  The  regulation  of  sectors  with  network  externalities  is \nbound  to  raise  difficult  policy  trade-offs  between  efficiency  and  coverage  across  a  variety  of \nsubsectors  (power,  water  and  sanitation,  and  telecommunications).  To  some  extent,  this  is  a \nnew  area  in  policy  reform,  barely  addressed  by  the  CPRGS.  However,  over  the  last  year \nencouraging  signs  have  been  taken  to  move  away  from  the  monopoly  model,  especially  in \ntelecommunications. Internet service provision was opened by licensing new entrants. In mobile \ntelephone,  competitive  entry  by  a  new  mobile  operator  was  authorized.  And  staged  price \nreductions  were  implemented  for  these  services.  As  of  January  2004,  telecommunications \nprices in Viet Nam are in line with regional levels. \n\n2. \n\nPillar II: Social Inclusion and Environmental Sustainability \n\n44. \nIssues relate to social inclusion and environmental sustainability, particularly education, \nhealth, water, and environment. For education, progress is needed to increase overall spending, \nimprove  resource  allocation,  and  improve  the  quality  of  teaching.  The  overall  approach  in  this \narea  is  captured  by  the  Education  for  All  framework  approved  by  the  Prime  Minister  and \nadopted under the PRSC II. Measures adopted over the last year hinge on the combination of \ntwo elements: quality standards and resource allocation mechanisms. The expenditure share of \neducation  and  training  was  increased  to  17.1%  of  the  budget  for  2004,  which  is  close  to  the \n18% CPRGS target for 2005. This share was 13.8% in 2002, and increased to 15.8% in 2003. \nIn parallel, national minimum standards for primary schools were adopted. A survey covering all \ndistricts has been launched to assess the current situation relative to the standards, which refer \nto  physical  infrastructure,  teaching  staff,  school  organization  and  management,  social \nparticipation  in  education,  educational  activities  and  quality,  and  expected  educational \noutcomes. \n\n45. \nThis overall approach to Education for All is to be complemented by a targeting strategy. \nAn  index  of  educational  disadvantage  has  already  been  developed,  combining  net  enrollment \nrates, the percentage of 6-year-old children having access to schooling, and completion rates. \nThis  targeting  mechanism  allows  identification  of  a  substantial  number  of  districts  with  indices \nwell below the national average. A fundamental upgrade in management practices is expected \nwith future PRSCs, subsequent to the piloting of a medium-term expenditure framework for the \neducation sector working with the Ministry of Education and Training. \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nTo redress the imbalances in health outcomes, the reform program focuses on changing \n46. \nthe  financing  of  health.  An  important  policy  action  under  the  PRSC  II  was  the  adoption  of \nDecision 139/2002/QD-TTg, which made more funding available for health services for the poor \nat  the  provincial  level.  Health  care  funds  for  the  poor  are  to  receive  sufficient  funding  to \nreimburse outlays of D70,000 per poor beneficiary per year, with 75% of this amount provided \nby the central Government and the remaining 25% covered through community and individual \ncontributions.  In  January  2004  the  Government  assessment  of  the  first  year  of  program \nimplementation  identified  important  achievements  as  well  as  obstacles  encountered  in \nimplementation.  As  an  indicator  of  progress,  all  provinces  and  cities  directly  under  the  central \nGovernment  have  set  up  health  care  funds  for  the  poor  and  established  fund  management \ncommittees.  Initial  estimates  place  the  number  of  target  beneficiaries  at  14.6  million.  Nearly \n37%  of  the  target  beneficiaries  are  located  in  the  northern  mountains  region.  The  central \nGovernment\u2019s portion to the health care funds for the poor has been paid in full. While Decision \n139 has increased the flow of government health funding to the poor, some problems remain. \nThese include the provinces\u2019 preference for directly reimbursing providers instead of purchasing \nhealth insurance cards, inadequate funding provided per beneficiary, and absence of additional \nfinancial  support  to  facilities  to  cover  the  unreimbursed  cost  of  providing  services  to \nbeneficiaries.  Other  issues  relate  to  the  slow  pace  of  identifying  eligible  beneficiaries  and \nextending  partial  benefits  to  near  poor  households.  All  of  these  issues  point  to  the  need  to \nclosely follow up on the implementation of this crucial reform. \n\n47. \nA  national  steering  committee  on  the  prevention  of  AIDS  (acquired  immunodeficiency \nsyndrome), drug use, and prostitution was recently established by the Prime Minister. A policy \nframework for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)/AIDS is being developed to identify critical \nneeds,  challenges,  and  opportunities.  Of  importance,  future  HIV/AIDS  prevention  agenda \nshould  link  HIV/AIDS  to  other  social  and  economic  development  plans,  increase  the \nGovernment\u2019s  human  resource  capacity  and  financial  commitment  to  HIV/AIDS,  and  broaden \nimplementation of successful pilot programs. More broadly, HIV/AIDS need to be recognized as \na gender issue and the approach to HIV/AIDS needs to become a program of harm prevention, \nrather  than  elimination  of  a  social  evil.  Under  the  PRSC  III,  the  national  steering  committee \nissued a draft 10-year strategy for slowing and halting the spread of HIV/AIDS (approved by the \nPrime  Minister  in  December  2003).  The  adoption  of  a  set  of  action  plans  to  implement  the \nstrategy is an important signal of the Governments\u2019 recognition of the need for decisive action in \nthe  face  of  the  emerging  AIDS  epidemic  in  Viet  Nam.  The  action  program  includes  steps  to \nremove  the  stigma  around  those  who  are  HIV-positive  and  resolve  policy  inconsistencies \nbetween the public health approach and the social evils approach. Dissemination of information \nand provision of adequate and affordable care and treatment are key components of the plan. \n\n48. \nThe new Land Law, passed in late 2003 and brought into effect in July 2004, supports \naccess to land for all sectors, addresses land-tenure security, recognizes community land-use \npractices,  and  develops  a  unified  land  administration  system.  While  some  of  the  specifics  will \ndepend on implementing decrees, circulars, and decisions currently under preparation, the new \nLand  Law  in  itself  represents  an  important  step  forward.  The  law  specifies  that  all  land  use \ncertificates must bear the names of both spouses, thereby filling a gap of the older version. The \nlaw also expands into areas such as the subleasing land, and the use of land use certificates as \ncapital contributions for joint ventures. It stipulates that the valuation of land for purposes such \nas  taxation,  registration,  or  payment  of  compensation  should  be  in  line  with  market  prices. \nInvestors  operating  under  the  Foreign  Investment  Law  will  still  need  to  acquire  land  use \ncertificates by leasing them from the state. However, those who pay the entire amount of rent in \na  single  lump  sum  up-front  are  allowed  to  sublease,  assign,  or  sell  their  land  use  certificates \nduring the lease term. Paying the rent as a lump sum thus gives foreign land users similar rights \n\n\f 14\n\nas domestic land users. The issuance of land use certificates has been decentralized to district \nand provincial governments, and a unified system of land administration agencies will be set up. \nIn  addition,  more  transparent  mechanisms  for  resolving  land  disputes  have  been  promulgated \nwith a greater role for people\u2019s courts.  \n\n49. \nThe  Government  is  also  strengthening  the  process  of  allocating  upland  to  local  people \nand local communities. Many among the poor depend on upland, including forestland, for their \nlivelihood.  The  Government  issued  resolution  28/NQ/TW  to  accelerate  restructuring  of  state \nforestry  enterprises.  This  resolution  promotes  the  allocation  of  underutilized  land  and  forest \ncurrently  under  the  control  of  state  forestry  enterprises  to  the  local  population,  local \ncommunities,  or  private  enterprises.  Further,  the  revised  Law  on  Forest  Protection  and \nDevelopment, submitted to the National Assembly in May 2004, provides the overall framework \nfor the move to more social and community-based forestry. For the first time, it recognizes the \nforest  use  right  of  households,  communities,  and  other  sectors,  as  well  as  their  ownership  of \nplantation forests. And it proposes assigning an economic value to each forest production area \nas the basis for their allocation or lease to forest managers. In parallel, key stakeholders have \nalso started the consultation process to revise the forest sector development strategy, which is \nexpected to produce a long-term, broad, positive impact not only on poverty reduction but also \non sustainable management of forest, land, water, and environment in upland areas. \n\nIn the water resources sector, an important policy action undertaken over the last year is \n50. \nthe  involvement  of  users  in  irrigation  management.  Decree  143/2003/ND-CP  transfers  the \nmanagement  of  small-scale,  stand-alone  irrigation  systems,  as  well  as  tertiary  and  secondary \ncanals,  to  cooperatives  or  groups  of  water  users.  Irrigation  services,  which  were  until  recently \nunder  the  control  of  state-owned  irrigation  management  companies,  will  thus  become  more \nresponsive to the needs of local populations. The critical role of improving the quality of irrigation \nservices to intensifying and diversifying agriculture is recognized and is among the main drivers \nof agricultural growth and poverty reduction in rural areas.  \n \n51. \nEnvironmental  safeguards  for  public  investments  need  to  be  improved  and  the  polluter \npays principle introduced. Environmental impact assessments of public investment projects have \nbeen  delegated  to  several  provincial  governments,  particularly  in  the  regions  that  are  currently \ndriving  economic  growth,  such  as  Binh  Duong,  Da  Nang,  Hanoi,  and  Ho  Chi  Minh  City.  The \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  capacity  of  these  local  governments  has  been  considerably \nstrengthened,  in  parallel  with  increasing  their  empowerment  to  make  investment  decisions. \nAmendments  to  the  regulations  guiding  implementation  of  the  Law  on  Environment  Protection \nwere  recently  submitted  to  the  Government  for  approval.  These  amendments,  based  on \nconsultations  held  in  2003,  aim  at  further  decentralizing  environmental  impact  assessment \nresponsibilities. The control of pollution by existing firms was strengthened. Polluter pays fees on \nindustrial  and  municipal  wastewater  discharges  were  introduced  by  67/2003/ND-CP  and \nmultiministerial  circular  125/2003/TT-LB  BTC-BTNMT.  These  fees  apply  to  all  discharges \nindependently from enterprise ownership. Decree 64/2003/QD-TTg requires establishments that \ncause serious environmental pollution to either upgrade their technology or move to authorized \nzones. Noncompliant establishments are to be closed. Equally important, Decree 109/2003/ND-\nCP  promulgates  the  conservation  and  sustainable  use  of  wetlands.  It  regulates  detrimental \nhuman activity in wetland areas, while taking into account sustainability of the livelihoods of the \nrural poor. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\n \n\n3. \n\nPillar III: Modern Governance \n\n52. \nThe focus is on improving the planning process, public financial management, delivery of \npublic  administration  services  to  people  and  businesses,  and  anticorruption  initiatives.  The \nCPRGS approach is increasingly being incorporated into provincial planning. Due to increased \ndecentralization, resources from the central budget only represent a fraction (sometimes minor) \nof  total  local  public  expenditure.  While  the  CPRGS  sets  national  objectives,  provincial  policy \nmaking  needs  to  take  into  account  the  local  dimensions  of  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction. Such alignment of planning processes to localized development targets is still new to \nmany local officials, who are not fully used to the idea of setting development targets based on \nevidence  and  consultation,  gearing  policies  to  attain  those  targets,  aligning  resources \naccordingly,  and  monitoring  the  results.  During  the  last  year,  however,  incorporation  of  the \nCPRGS approach in provincial planning has progressed. The process has involved three main \nactivities: (i) regional workshops to discuss the approach and its implications for sector and local \nplanning  processes,  (ii)  regional  poverty  assessments  focusing  on  specific  dimensions  of \npoverty  in  each  region,  and  (iii)  support  by  development  agencies  to  19  pilot  provinces  to \nintegrate the CPRGS process into local and sector planning. Crucially, the Ministry of Planning \nand  Investment  has  issued  guidelines  to  prepare  provincial  5-year  and  annual  plans  that \nincorporate the CPRGS approach.  \n\nThe  trend  to  increased  decentralization,  with  the  associated  reliance  on  local  fees  and \n53. \nout-of-pocket payments, makes the allocation of resources key to improving service delivery. A \nplan was to develop  medium-term  expenditure frameworks in sectors that play a direct role in \nreducing  poverty  and  keeping  development  inclusive:  education,  health,  agriculture,  and \ntransport. The expenditure frameworks are part of a broader effort to improve transparency and \nefficiency in budget management. They should lead to better integration of capital and current \nexpenditures,  with  a  forward-looking  perspective.  The  Ministry  of  Education  and  Training  has \nbeen selected to pilot a shadow medium-term expenditure framework, with improved accounting \nsystems  and  control  procedures  by  MOF.  Once  implemented,  this  expenditure  framework  is \nexpected to lead to a fundamental upgrade of management practices. \n\n54.  \nThe implementation of the revised Law on the State Budget is one of the cornerstones of \nthe  public  financial  management  reform  program.  It  (i)  clearly  delineates  the  roles  of  the \nNational Assembly and the provincial people\u2019s councils in budget approval, (ii) streamlines the \nbudget  execution  processes,  and  (iii)  assigns  the  Treasury  Department  as  the  lead  agency \nresponsible  for  budget  execution  and  financial  management  information.  Currently  three \nseparate  accounting  systems  are  in  use  for  the  State  Budget  Department,  the  State  Treasury \nDepartment, and spending units. Extrabudgetary funds, onlent ODA, and much commune-level \nspending  are  currently  not  consolidated  into  the  budget  or  recorded  in  the  State  Treasury \nDepartment's  main  accounting  system.  The  lack  of  a  fully  consolidated  and  integrated  budget \nmakes  monitoring  total  revenues  and  expenditures,  assessing  how  resources  are  being \nallocated,  and  comparing  plans  with  outputs  difficult.  One  step  undertaken  last  year  toward \nimplementing  the  new  Budget  Law  was  the  unification  of  the  accounting  systems  of  the  State \nBudget and the State Treasury. \n\n55. \nThe  design  of  an  overall  treasury  and  budget  management  information  system  is \ncomplete. The system is based on modern principles of public financial management, such as \nthe  World  Bank-International  Monetary  Fund  Treasury  Reference  Model.  The  new  system  will \nreplace  the  current  systems  that  are  fragmented  technologically  and  have  overlapping  and \nconflicting functionality. Implementing the treasury and budget management information system \nshould  lead  to  a  vast  improvement  in  the  integrity  in  overall  fiscal  data,  transparency,  and \n\n\f 16\n\ncontrol  at  all  levels  of  government.  A  decree  has  also  been  submitted  on  implementing \naccounting  standards  set  by  the  new  Accounting  Law  using  spending  units  based  on  state \nbudget resources. \n\nViet  Nam  has  made  significant  progress  in  laying  the  foundation  for  public  and  private \n56. \nfinancial accountability in recent years. To strengthen legislative oversight of public accounts, a \nlegal  mandate  was  issued  for  the  State  Audit  of  Viet  Nam  to  operate  outside  of  the  executive \nbranch of Government and report its audit results to the National Assembly on a routine basis. \nThe new Accounting Law was issued in accordance with international practice. Since then, 16 \naccounting standards and 27 auditing standards have been issued.  \n\n57. \nA  new  decree  to  guide  implementation  of  the  Law  on  the  Promulgation  of  Legal \nNormative Documents supports further legal development. The decree stipulates that the legal \nnormative documents should be published for at least a couple weeks in the Official Gazette for \nthem to become effective. While the requirement to publish in the Official Gazette is made in the \nlaw,  the  implications  of  nonpublication  were  not  explicit.  Also,  this  new  decree  sets  clear \nguidelines for the collection of comments from stakeholders directly affected by legal normative \ndocuments. A minimum period of 20 working days is stipulated for consultation, which can take \nplace through mass media or the Internet.  \n\n The  Government\u2019s  decision  to  replicate  the  one-stop  shop  model  nationwide  is  an \n58. \nimportant  step  in  public  administration  reform.  The  Public  Administration  Reform  Master \nProgram  2001\u20132010  represents  an  ambitious  policy  agenda  aiming  to  make  the  civil  service \nmore responsive, transparent, efficient, and accountable.16 As a first step, a plan for simplifying \nadministrative  procedures  was  adopted.  The  one-stop  shop  model  was  promulgated  as  a \nnational  policy  under  the  PRSC  III,  through  the  issuance  of  Decision  181.  The  model  aims  to \nprovide  a  clear,  accessible,  and  recognizable  entry  point  for  people  in  need  of  administrative \nservices;  increase  transparency  on  fees  and  procedures;  improve  service  quality;  and \nstreamline procedures. As of 1 January 2004, the one-stop shop model had been implemented \nin 35 of 64 provinces, 483 of 654 districts, and 695 of 10,709 communes. Subsequent PRSCs \nwill  monitor  implementation  in  terms  of  both  quantity  (the  number  of  units  implementing  one-\nstop shop) and quality. \n\n59. \nOver  the  last  year  openness  to  feedback  by  users  of  public  services  has  improved \nconsiderably. To enhance delivery, the Ministry of Home Affairs supported a report card survey \non a pilot basis in four urban localities (Da Nang, Haiphong, Ho Chi Minh City, and Nam Dinh) \nThese signal a stronger focus on performance management and service delivery outcome. The \nreport  card  survey  is  expected  to  enhance  transparency  and  accountability,  generate  user \nfeedback  on  specific  services,  facilitate  comparisons  across  units,  and  foster  a  dialogue  on \npractical  problem-solving  in  service  delivery.  A  series  of  participatory  poverty  assessments, \nincluding questions on governance, were conducted in 12 provinces during July-August 2003. \n\n60.  \nThe  process  of  successfully  moving  to  a  rules-based  market  economy  requires \nstrengthening  institutions  and  developing  mechanisms  for  accountability,  thereby  reducing  the \nscope for corruption. At present, the understanding of corruption in Viet Nam is predominantly \nbased  on  anecdotal  evidence.  To  address  this,  the  Government  has  recently  launched  a \ndiagnostic study of corruption. The study results will feed into an amendment of the Ordinance \n\n                                                 \n16 ADB is supporting implementation of training, retraining, and computerization of state administration components \nof  the  Government\u2019s  master  program  for  public  administration  reform  under  loan-No  1992-  Support  to  the \nImplementation of Public Administration Reform Master Program Phase I, approved in 2003.  \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nImportant Features \n\nagainst Corruption. The Government has signaled its serious intent to tackle corruption.17 It has \nstrengthened  the  State  Inspectorate  to  enforce  laws  and  regulations  related  to  public \ninvestment. A draft ordinance to strengthen the public procurement process was issued. Public \nprocurement  is  an  important  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing  efforts  to  improve  public \nexpenditure management. The ordinance makes open bidding the main method of procurement, \nmandates standard bidding documents, and introduces the pass-fail system as an alternative to \nthe  merit  points  system.  To  enhance  transparency  in  the  public  procurement  process  the \nordinance mandates a procurement bulletin, to be published on paper and electronically. It also \nstrengthens provisions related to inspections and handling of violations. \n \nC. \n \nA social and poverty impact assessment was undertaken in relation to the program loan \n61. \n(a  summary  is  in  Appendix  6,  and  additional  details  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A).  The \nassessment concludes that the activities will have no adverse impacts on indigenous people or \nhave gender implications. The loan will not involve land acquisition and/or resettlement.  \n \n62. \nAn  environmental  assessment  of  the  potential  environmental  impacts  associated  with \nthe  program  loan  policy  matrix  is  available  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B.  The  assessment \nreveals that most policy reforms will produce positive impacts on urban and rural environments. \nMost  of  the  reforms  aim  to  improve  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency.  While  not \nspecifically  designed  for  environmental  protection,  these  reforms  tend  to  promote  optimal  and \nefficient  use  of  resources,  including  natural  resources.  Some  of  the  reforms  aim  to  improve \nenvironmental protection and management, while others aim to improve health and education, \nwhich  tend  to  have  indirect  positive  impacts  on  environmental  sustainability.  These  reforms  fit \nwell  with  Viet  Nam\u2019s  environmental  policy  needs,  and  are  therefore  considered  practical  and \nnecessary next steps for the country\u2019s environmental management framework.  \n \nSome  policy  reforms  will  likely  have  no  impact  on  the  environment.  These  include \n63. \nreforms  of  public  financial  management,  private  sector  development,  and  the  financial  sector. \nThese reforms could have a positive trickle-down effect, but the links between such impacts are \nsufficiently  subtle  that  they  cannot  easily  be  evaluated  or  monitored.  The  remaining  policy \nreforms such as SOE reforms and reforms to move to a market economy have a mix of positive \nimpacts  or  no  impacts.  However,  most  have  the  potential  to  support  prudent  use  of \nenvironmental  resources,  which  can  be  realized  if  each  reform  is  designed  with  due \nconsideration to their environmental implications.  \n \nFinancing Plan \nD. \n \n \nThe Government\u2019s estimation of the financing gap for 2004 is US$3.3 billion.18 ODA and \n64. \nforeign  direct  investment  inflows  are  expected  to  meet  the  financing  gap.  The  Government \nestimate for financing requirements for key CPRGS activities amounts to about US$800 million. \nThe  resolution  of  nonperforming  loans  is  estimated  to  cost  about  US$2  billion  in  total.  The \nestimated costs of some specific CPRGS programs for 2004 are (i) health funds for the poor\u2014 \nabout US$50 million; and (ii) increase in spending on education from 15.8 % to 17.3 % of the \ngovernment budget\u2014about US$20 million.  \n \n\n                                                 \n17  Viet  Nam  also  endorsed  the  ADB-Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  Initiative  for \n\nAnticorruption in Asia and Pacific in July 2004. \n\n18  Based on information provided by the Government during PRSC III processing. \n\n\f 18\n\nODA  resources  for  2004  are  expected  to  fund  about  US$178  million.  The  World  Bank \n65. \nhas already approved a US$100 million International Development Association credit to support \nthe  PRSC  III19,  and  other  development  partners  are  providing  cofinancing,  including  the \nCanadian International Development Agency (Can$6.3 million grant),20 Denmark (US$10 million \ngrant),  the  European  Commission  (\u20ac15  million  grant),  the  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation  (US$18  million  equivalent  loan),  Netherlands  (\u20ac4  million  grant),  and  the  United \nKingdom\u2019s Department for International Development (\u20a420 million grant). \n \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  US$6.4  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \n66. \nresources as ADB\u2019s support to the implementation of the CPRGS following the policy framework \nof the PRSC III program. The program loan would contribute to financing the cost of adjustment \nresulting from implementation of the policy matrix, particularly the prior actions for the PRSC III, \nand to supporting and facilitating the Government\u2019s continued and deepened reform program for \npoverty reduction. The loan will be disbursed upon declaration of loan effectiveness. \n \n67. \nThe loan will have a 24-year term including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) \nthe  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  on  the  basis  of \nthese terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n68. \nto the date of loan effectiveness. The loan closing date will be 31 December 2005. \n \nE. \n \n\nThe loan proceeds may be used to finance eligible imports incurred within 180 days prior \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n \n69. \nSBV  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  The  program  is  being  implemented  through  20  line \nministries and government agencies in accordance with Paragraph 3 of Schedule V in the Loan \nAgreement. \n \n70. \nThe  National  Steering  Committee  for  implementation  of  the  CPRGS  and  PRSCs  was \nestablished in 2002. It is chaired by a first deputy prime minister, and consists of heads of 20 \nrelevant line ministries. SBV is assigned as the agency responsible, in close collaboration with \nthe World Bank, for preparing and implementing the PRSCs. A deputy governor of SBV acts as \nNational  Steering  Committee\u2019s  standing  vice  chair.  This  quasi-advisory  body  has  several \nrepresentatives  from  key  economic  ministries,  such  as  the  ministries  of  agriculture  and  rural \ndevelopment;  education  and  training;  finance;  justice;  labor,  invalids,  and  social  affairs;  and \ntransport;  as  well  as  the  Office  of  the  Government,  Party's  Economic  Commission,  and  SBV \nrepresenting the policy reform areas under PRSC III and subsequent PRSCs.  \n \n71. \nAn  interministerial  working  group  and  a  secretariat  to  implement  and  monitor  the \nCPRGS have been established at the Ministry of Planning and Investment. The working group \ncomprises  representatives  from  key  economic  ministries,  including  those  represented  on  the \nNational Steering Committee representing the respective policy reform areas under the PRSC \nIII. Among the goals of the Interministerial Working Group is the implementation of the CPRGS \n\n                                                 \n19  The credit became effective on 6 October 2004. \n20  Can$ = Canadian dollar. \n\n\f19\n\n \n\n73. \n \n\nat  subnational  levels.  The  CPRGS  Secretariat  at  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment \nsupports provincial governments in adapting the CPRGS to their own context, and reformulating \nplans  and  budgets  accordingly.  At  present,  19  provinces  are  going  through  this  process,  with \nfinancial support from development agencies. The CPRGS Secretariat prepared the first annual \nprogress  report  on  CPRGS  implementation  under  the  guidance  of  the  Interministerial  Working \nGroup. \n \n72.  In  addition,  given  the  intensive  and  complex  coordination  required  to  manage  this  very \ncomprehensive reform program, SBV will be strengthening program implementation, particularly \nresults monitoring and reporting and public discussion and awareness. \n \n\nPeriod of Implementation \n\n2. \n \nThe program period will be from 30 June 2004 to 31 December 2005. \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n \n74. \nThe proceeds of the loan will be utilized in accordance with the simplified disbursement \nprocedures  and  related  requirements  for  program  loans,  goods  and  services  produced  and \noriginating in ADB member countries will be procured, with due consideration for economy and \nefficiency,  in  accordance  with  standard  public  procedures  in  Viet  Nam,  and  normal  private \nsector commercial practices, acceptable to ADB. Goods commonly traded on the international \ncommodity markets will be procured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and \nacceptable to ADB. \n \n75. \nThe loan will be disbursed in a single tranche, contingent upon loan effectiveness. The \nproceeds of the loan will be disbursed for a broad range of imports, subject to a negative list of \nineligible  items  (Appendix  7).  Loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  on  the  basis  of  a  certification \nprovided  by  the  Government  the  value  of  total  imports  minus  (i)  imports  from  nonmember \ncountries, (ii) ineligible imports, and (iii) imports financed under other ODA, is equal to or greater \nthan the amount expected to be disbursed during the year. \n \n\n4. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n \n76. \nThe  counterpart  funds  to  be  generated  from  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance \nthe  adjustment  costs  of  implementation  of  the  reform  program  as  per  the  policy  matrix \n(Appendix 4). \n \n\n5. \n\nMonitoring  \n\n \nViet  Nam  continues  to  make  good  use  of  information  and  analysis  in  its  policy  making \n77. \nand development of individual components of the PRSC program. PRSC III continues to build \non  this  experience,  streamlining  the  numerous  ongoing  monitoring  and  evaluation  initiatives. \nKey sources of monitoring information for poverty and program outcomes include the proposed \nbiannual  household  living  standard  survey,  periodic  participatory  poverty  assessments,  the \nsmall business registration survey, public expenditure tracking survey, as well as the quarterly \nprogress  reports  from  the  relevant  sector  ministries  and  committees  implementing  the  reform \nprogram.  \n \n78 \nIn addition, the strengthening of management information systems for SOEs and for all \npublic spending, both led by MOF, is an integral part of the PRSC program. Efforts for provincial \n\n\f 20\n\n6. \n\nReporting \n\nimplementation of the CPRGS rely on the development of appropriate monitoring indicators as \nwell.  Gradually,  the  number  of  indicators  has  been  narrowed  to  around  40,  roughly  100  less \nthan  when  the  process  started.  Many  of  the  indicators  in  this  narrower  set  will  be  generated \nusing the new household living standard surveys.  \n \n \n \n79. \nThe Government will prepare and provide semi-annual progress reports on the program \nloan. ADB will participate in all joint assessments by the Government and development partners \non the outcomes of the PRSC III and PRSC IV triggers (measures and actions). Further details \nare presented the program framework in Appendix 1. \n \n \n\nV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \n80. \nPolicy  reform  actions  will  improve  transparency  and  accountability  in  SOE  operations \nand  in  the  banking  subsector.  The  establishment  of  a  sound  regulatory  framework  for  policy \nresulting  in  increased  private  investment  and  exports  will  lead  to  additional  job  creation.  The \nprogram  loan  will  promote  human  development  by  improving  access  by  poor  people  to \neducation and health care, and increasing the security of asset ownership in the form of a new \nland law. The policy reform under the PRSC III will increase transparency and accountability of \npublic finances and improve legal transparency and accessibility, by laying the foundations for a \nstate  ruled  by  law,  and  by  addressing  a  number  of  gaps  in  the  Budget  Law.  Further \ndecentralization  of  public  administration  leading  to  better  service  delivery  to  the  poor  and \nincreased  local  beneficiary  participation  are  other  expected  benefits.  Development  outcomes \nare summarized in Appendix 8. \n   \n81. \nThrough  appropriate  measures  and  proactive  programs,  the  Government  will  need  to \nmitigate the potential adverse economic, social, and environmental impacts of increasing trade \nopenness, reducing the number of state enterprises, and liberalizing land transactions.  \n \n82. \nIncomplete  structural  reform  could  jeopardize  growth  and  stability  in  the  longer  term. \nHaphazard  introduction  of  market  forces  in  the  social  sectors,  and  the  trend  toward \ndecentralization  have  put  service  delivery  under  strain.  At  the  same  time,  fast  integration  with \nthe world economy may lead to increased inequality, at least temporarily, as the benefits accrue \nto specific regions and skills disproportionately. Growth in Viet Nam could become less inclusive \nin the years to come. \n \n83. \nA  fiduciary  risk  is  associated  with  the  PRSC  III,  if  progress  on  enhancing  budget \ntransparency and tackling corruption is inadequate. The Government is indicating new resolve \nto  address  these  issues.  It  has  recently  embarked  on  revamping  its  anticorruption  strategy.  It \nhas also enhanced budget transparency. Their full implementation will be crucial to mitigate the \nfiduciary risk. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n84. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n\n\f21\n\nThe measures and actions included in the Support to Implementation of Poverty \nReduction Program and specified in the development policy letter and the policy \nmatrix will be adopted in a timely manner. \n\nSuch  measures  and  actions  will  continue  to  be  in  effect  for  the  duration  of  the \nSupport to Implementation of Poverty Reduction Program under the CPRGS and \nPRSC frameworks. \n\n(iii) \n\nAdequate and timely counterpart funds will be provided for the implementation of \nthe Poverty Reduction Program under the PRSC III. \n\nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n\n \n85. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  4,346,000  to  the \nSocialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  Support  to  Implementation  of  Poverty  Reduction  Program \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 24 years, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n9 November 2004 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nJoseph B.

The \nformulation  of  the  CPRGS  was  coordinated  by  the  CPRGS  Secretariat  based  in  the  Ministry  of \nPlanning  and  Investment  and  supported  by  several  official  development  assistance  (ODA) \npartners, including the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n \nThe  CPRGS,  approved  by  the  Prime  Minister  in  May  2002,  translated  the  vision  of  a \n2. \nmarket  economy  with  a  socialist  orientation  presented \nthe  10-Year  Socioeconomic \nDevelopment  Strategy  for  2001\u20132010  into  concrete  public  actions.  Unlike  previous  planning \ndocuments,  the  CPRGS  is  focused  and  clearly  defines  development  targets,  identifies \nappropriate policies to attain those targets, and aligns resources to those policies. The country\u2019s \ndevelopment goals, which are a local version of the Millennium Development Goals, are among \nthe  key  targets  pursued  in  the  CPRGS  (Table  A2).  In  2003,  the  CPRGS  was  expanded,  with  a \nthorough  discussion  of  the  role  of  large  infrastructure  in  promoting  economic  and  social \ndevelopment. \n \nThe CPRGS provides a framework for poverty reduction policies, programs, and actions in \n3. \nViet  Nam  (Figure  A2.1).  The  ODA  community  has  adopted  the  CPRGS  as  the  reference \ndocument for planning and formulating external assistance. \n\nin \n\n \n\n \n\nTable A2: The Development Goals of Viet Nam \n

The  committee  is  chaired  by  a  first \ndeputy  prime  minister  and  comprises  the  top  officials  of  20  relevant  line  ministries.  An \ninterministerial  working  group  and  secretariat  to  implement  and  monitor  the  CPRGS  have  been \nestablished at the Ministry of Planning and Investment. The working group oversees subnational \nimplementation of the CPRGS; the secretariat helps provincial governments adapt the CPRGS to \ntheir own context and to formulate plans and budgets accordingly.  \n \n5. \nThe  State  Bank  of  Viet  Nam  (SBV)  is  responsible  for  formulating  and  implementing  the \nPoverty  Reduction  Support  Credits  (PRSCs).  To  improve  consultation  and  coordination  with  all \nstakeholders and to promote public discussion of the PRSCs, SBV is creating a special program \ncoordination  unit.  Key  monitoring  programs  for  measuring  impact  on  poverty  include  the \nhousehold  living  standard  survey,  periodic  participatory  poverty  assessments,  small  business \nregistration survey, public expenditure tracking survey, as well as quarterly progress reports from \nthe relevant sector ministries and committees implementing the reform program. The Government \npresents its annual CPRGS progress report in December at the Consultative Group meeting. \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancing \n\n \n6. \nThe  PRSCs  provide  a  major  ODA  source  of  financing  for  CPRGS  implementation.  The \nPRSCs  have  attracted  sizable  grants  from  bilateral  development  partners  in  addition  to \nInternational  Development  Assistance  (IDA)  credits.  The  estimated  financing  gap  for  the \nimplementation of the CPRGS during 2004 is US$3.3 billion, which is expected to be met by ODA \nand foreign direct investment inflows.  \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n   Appendix 2 \n\n31\n\n4. \n\nProgress with Implementation \n\nimprove \n\ninclude1  (i) \n\nthe  CPRGS  progress  report \n\n \n7. \nThe  Government  has  pursued  its  reform  agenda  steadily.  It  recently  completed  the  first \nannual progress report on growth and reduction of poverty for 2002\u20132003. The CPRGS progress \nreport  was  presented  at  the  Consultative  Group  meeting  in  December  2003  and  indicated  that \nimplementation  of  the  reform  agenda  was  on  schedule.  Although  considerable  progress  in  the \ntransition  to  a  market  economy  has  been  achieved,  the  Government  recognizes  that  to  keep \ndevelopment  inclusive  and  to  modernize  governance,  important  challenges  remain.  Key \nrecommendations  of \nimplementation \narrangements,  including  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  CPRGS  implementation;  (ii)  increase \ncapacity building and human resource development; (iii) improve the exchange and dissemination \nof  policy  information  regarding  the  CPRGS;  (iv)  improve  statistics  on  poverty  reduction  and \ngrowth;  (v)  ensure  stronger  integration  of  the  CPRGS  and  the  5-year  and  annual  development \nplan in terms of targets and policies; (vi) provide more instructions for local planning; (vii) facilitate \nthe  participation  of  scientists  and  research  institutes  for  in-depth  analysis  and  multidimensional \nassessments; and (viii) align international assistance with realizing targets and measures in the \nCPRGS. \n \n8. \nOver  the  last  12  months,  the  Government  has  adopted  many  substantive  actions  for \nimplementing its socioeconomic reform agenda. It has taken steps for further trade liberalization \nin pursuit of World Trade Organization (WTO) accession and integration with the world economy. \nThe  Government  has  substantially  accelerated  the  pace  of  ownership  transformation  of  state-\nowned  enterprises,  improved  the  transparency  and  accountability  in  the  financial  sector, \nstrengthened  the  regulatory  framework  for  policy  lending  by  the  Government,  encouraged \ncompetition in telecommunications, and unified corporate tax rates.  \n \n9. \nIn  respect  of  social  inclusion  and  environmental  sustainability,  Viet  Nam  has  ensured \nappropriate budget allocation for education and for contribution to all the provincial (health funds \nfor the poor; raised the quality standards of primary education, and adopted a multisector action \nprogram \nimmunodeficiency  virus/acquired \nimmunodeficiency syndrome) strategy. To improve environmental management, the Government \nhas  implemented  the  polluter  pays  principle,  issued  regulations  to  handle  the  worst  pollution \noffenders,  and  strengthened  the  environmental  assessment  capacity  of  local  administrations.  \nThe  new  Land  Law\u2014effective  1  July  2004\u2014supports  access  to  land  for  all  sectors  and \nrecognizes  community  land-use  practices\u2014an  important  issue  for  upland  and  ethnic  minority \nareas.  \n \n10. \nTo  build  modern  governance,  the  Government  has  taken  measures  to  increase \ntransparency in public finances, improve financial accountability, and ensure dissemination of its \nlegal  documents  and  consultation  with  stakeholders.  It  continues  to  move  forward  on  public \nadministration reform by simplifying administrative procedures using the one-stop shop model. It \nhas  taken  steps  to  strengthen  the  public  procurement  process,  and  to  curb  abuses  in  business \ntransactions. The Government intends to integrate the CPRGS approach into future 5-year and 1-\nyear planning processes. \n\nits  national  HIV/AIDS \n\nimplement \n\n(human \n\nto \n\n \n\nSocioeconomic Performance and Key Policy Issues  \n\nB. \n \n11.  While  the  Government  has  had  great  success  in  reducing  poverty,  regional  income \ndisparity  remains  a  concern.  Coastal  development  and  further  urbanization  should  cater  to  the \nemployment  needs  of  the  surplus  labor  coming  from  the  hinterlands.  This  should  also  take  into \naccount possible restructuring and modernization of the agriculture sector.  \n \n                                                 \n1 Compiled from CPRGS Steering Committee, Interministerial Working Group. 2003.

Hanoi.  \n\n\f32\n\nAppendix 2 \n\ntechnology  needs \n\n12. \nIn the past, agriculture sector growth resulted from (i) reliance on higher input use (labor, \nland, fertilizer, tractors, and irrigation); (ii) policy reforms for land, markets, and trade; and (iii) high \npublic  investment,  mainly  in  irrigation  and  roads.  This  strategy  will  not  likely  be  able  to  sustain \ngrowth in the future because (i) the potential for expanding the rural labor force and land under \ncultivation is limited; (ii) new investment in irrigation exhibits decreasing marginal returns, as the \nstock of irrigation capital is already very high and requires increased operation and maintenance \nrather than new expansion; and (iii) net revenue from rice export is declining. Viet Nam is already \nexperiencing  overproduction  of  rice,  coffee,  and  other  commodities,  and  declining  export \nrevenues from unprocessed primary commodities.  \n \n13. \nThe Government has made a good progress in specializing in a number of agriculture and \nfishery  products  (for  example,  coffee,  shrimps,  catfish)  and  by  taking  advantage  of  increased \nmarket  access  to  regional  and  international  high-income  countries.  However,  predominantly \ntraditional  farming  practices  that  produce  relatively  low-value  crops  are  holding  back  further \nsuccess.  Advanced  agriculture \nto  be  developed  and  disseminated. \nAgribusinesses and small and medium enterprises need to be developed for agro processing to \nincrease  added  value.  Credit  delivery  to  farmers  needs  to  be  improved,  with  consideration  for \nintroducing  crop  and  livestock  insurance  schemes  in  collaboration  with  the  private  sector  or  by \npromoting a full-fledged microfinance system. \n \nCarefully planned and efficiently managed large infrastructure projects such as seaports, \n14. \nairports, power plants, and national railways and roads properly linked with feeder roads and can \nactively contribute to national socioeconomic development, as well as regional and international \neconomic  integration.  At  both  the  national  and  subregional  levels,  they  help  (i)  strengthen \nlinkages between poor and developed regions; (ii) provide access to socioeconomic opportunities \nas  well  as  public  services;  (iii)  create  conditions  for  exploiting  local  resources  for  meeting \nnational,  regional,  and  international  demands;  (iv)  improve  connectivity  between  people  and \nbusinesses;  and  (v)  eventually \ntoward \nindustrialization.  \n \n15. \nThe  Government  has  emphasized  the  importance  of  large  infrastructure  development  in \nthe  context  of  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  Infrastructure  development  also  has  a \nsubregional  dimension,  whereby  the  potential  demand  from  neighboring  countries/subregion \nshould  be  taken  into  account.  Development  of  large  infrastructures  will  require  large  capital \ninvestments. Preliminary estimates suggest that in total the Government will need to invest about \n35% of gross domestic product over the next 15 years to achieve the planned growth rate of 7.5% \nper  year.2  Better  project  planning,  implementation,  and  management,  following  internationally \naccepted good practices, coupled with necessary policy and institutional reforms to facilitate trade \n(including customs- and immigration-related reforms) will be required to ensure the expected net \neconomic benefits are fully realized.   \n \n16. \nIn  the  country  the  realization  is  growing  that  serious  environmental  degradation  and \ninsufficient investment in environmental protection and management are beginning to impinge on \nthe country\u2019s economic productivity. This could adversely affect economic competitiveness, result \nin  productivity  losses  due  to  pollution-related  health  problems  in  the  workforce,  and  reduce  the \nwelfare  and  quality  of  life  of  the  people.  The  Prime  Minister  approved  the  National  Strategy  for \nEnvironmental Protection until 2010 and Vision towards 2020 on December 2, 2003. The strategy \noutlines the rapid deterioration of the environment and offers 36 priority programs to strengthen \nenvironmental  protection  through  the  expected  future  of  continued  rapid  industrialization  and \nmodernization.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  Agenda  21  was  approved  in  August  2004,  and  a  new,  expanded \nenvironmental protection law is expected to be approved in 2005.  \n \n\ntransformation  of  economic  structures \n\nfacilitate \n\n                                                 \n2 Based on the preliminary results of a recent joint study by the Government and ADB. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n   Appendix 2 \n\n33\n\n17. \nTo  achieve  efficient  management  of  its  development  process  and  poverty  reduction,  the \nGovernment  should  ensure  (i)  transparency  and  accountability  of  central  as  well  as  local \nbudget/spending;  (ii)  proper  accounting  and  auditing  of  public  revenue  and  expenditure;  (iii) \nsimplification and harmonization of internal procedures at both central and provincial levels; (iv) \naccelerated implementation of the public administration reform (including computerization of state \nadministration, and training of civil servants to build capacity/capabilities at local levels); and (v) \nregular  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  development  projects,  involving  beneficiaries  and  civil \nsociety.   \n \nThe  Government  is  preparing  a  new  5-year  socioeconomic  development  plan  (2006\u2013\n18. \n2010).  The  plan  will  be  fundamentally  different  from  the  past  5-year  plans.  The  next  plan  will \nanticipate  further  opening  of  the  economy  through  the  implementation  of  Association  of  South \nEast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  Free  Trade  Area,  bilateral  agreements  with  the  European  Union, \nJapan,  and  the  United  States,  and  WTO  commitments.  This  will  result  in  increased  access  to \nregional and global markets, and also increased external competitive pressure (through imports) \nfor  domestic  suppliers,  which  may  result  in  short-term  adjustment  costs  affecting  mainly  poor \nhouseholds.  A  major  thrust  of  the  next  5-year  plan  should  be  on  removing  development \nweaknesses and exploiting the country\u2019s opportunities and strengths. \n  \n19. \nOn  the  macroeconomic  front,  prudence  is  required  to  ensure  stability  and  sustain  high \neconomic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  The  Government  should  aim  to  achieve  economic \ngrowth from (i) more efficient utilization of existing stock of capital (i.e., improving competitiveness \nby  removing  inefficiencies,  and  maximizing  capacity  utilization  in  productive  sectors);  and  (ii) \nefficient allocation  and use  of  new capital investments  (i.e.,  health  and  education, infrastructure \ndevelopment, modernization and restructuring of agriculture, industry and service sectors). New \ninvestments should ideally be maintained around 35% of the gross domestic product, above this \nlevel may mean excess money supply leading to high inflation and other associated problems as \nthe economy may have difficulty absorbing that extent of additional capital deployment. \n \n20. \nOn  the  social  front,  income  disparity,  both  geographic  and  demographic,  will  increase  if \neconomic  growth  is  not  socially  inclusive,  and  policy  loopholes  and  weak  governance  continue. \nReducing poverty for the remaining 29% of the population will become increasingly difficult. ODA \n(i.e., grants and soft loans) should be targeted at developing remote areas and reducing chronic \npoverty. The implementation of the ASEAN Free Trade Area and WTO commitments (assuming \nsuccessful WTO accession in 2005) should be carefully planned and monitored to mitigate likely \nsocial costs. \n \n21. \nThe  Government  has  indicated  that  the  next  5-year  plan  would  be  integrated  with  the \nCPRGS and the master program for public administration reform (2001\u20132010). This would mean \n(i) integrating CPRGS strategic and process elements into socioeconomic development planning, \nand  (ii)  strengthening  public  administration  to  efficiently  implement  Government  policies  and \nprovide public services to people and businesses.  \n\nC. \n\nChronology \n\nBackground \n\n1. \n \n22. \nDuring the Country Programming Mission of ADB in April 2004, the Government formally \nasked ADB to provide financing for implementation of the CPRGS3, under the multi-development \npartner  assisted  PRSC  III  led  by  the  World  Bank.4    ADB,  recognizing  the  importance  of  this \n\n                                                 \n3 Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2003. The Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy. Hanoi. \n4  Following the joint processing of the PRSC III, the World Bank approved a US$100 million International Development \nAssociation credit. Details can be found in International Development Association Program document for a proposed \n\n\f34\n\nAppendix 2 \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  commitment \n\nrequest  and \nto  poverty  reduction,  responded  positively. \nSubsequently,  the  proposed  program  loan  was  upgraded  to  \u201cfirm\u201d  for  2004  in  the  Country \nStrategy and Program Update 2004,5 and endorsed by the ADB Board of Directors on 20 August \n2004.   \n \nPreparatory  work  to  formulate  the  PRSC  III  was  initiated  in  November  2003  with  the \n23. \ninvolvement  of  key  development  partners  and  government  agencies.  ADB  was  invited  to \nparticipate in the formulation of the PRSC III, including in the policy discussions and negotiations \nwith  the  Government.  On  behalf  of  the  Government,  SBV  coordinated  the  overall  processing  of \nthe PRSC III. For the development partners, the formulation process was led by the World Bank. \n\n2. \n\nThe Program Loan Proposal Formulation Process \n\n \nFrom  the  outset,  the  Government  and  the  Mission  recognized  the  very  tight  timetable \n24. \nwithin which the ADB loan proposal had to be prepared, and the need to ensure that the program \nloan proposal be conceived as substantive, credible, and defensible. From the ADB perspective, \nfor a program loan proposal, it was critical for the Government to (i) demonstrate commitment and \nsupport  at  all  government  levels;  and  (ii)  facilitate  the  fullest  possible  participation  by  all  key \nstakeholders  during  the  formulation  and  implementation  of  the  program  loan.  These  two  crucial \nconditions were accomplished during the PRSC III processing. \n   \n25. \nThe  Fact-Finding  Mission  from  24  August\u20133  September  2004,  used  the  diagnostic  work \non the issues and challenges that the Government is seeking to address in PRSC III under the \nCPRGS  framework.  The  mission  identified  the  policy  and  institutional  measures,  actions,  and \nimplementation  arrangements  necessary  to  ensure  effective  CPRGS  implementation  utilizing \nODA  funding.  The  mission  reached  an  understanding  with  the  Government  and  other \ndevelopment partners on the objectives, scope, financing, and implementation arrangements for \nthe  proposed  loan.  The  Government  proposed  that  the  processing  of  the  loan  follow  simplified \nprocedures  since  ADB  was  one  of  the  key  development  partners  that  had  participated  in  the \npreparation of the CPRGS and formulation of the PRSC III; PRSC III has already been approved \nby  the  Government  and  the  World  Bank,  and  the  Government  would  also  follow  simplified \nprocedure for its internal processing and approval.  \n \n26. \nTo  reduce  transaction  costs  for  the  Government  and  ADB,  the  mission  pursued  the \npossibility of applying a program-based approach in close consultation with ADB\u2019s Strategy and \nPolicy Department. This approach is in line with ADB\u2019s recent move to adopt program-based and \nsector  approaches.6  The  approach  is  not  only  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Reform  Agenda  Today: \nAchieving Results Together7 but also with the Rome Declaration on harmonization of procedures \nof multilateral development banks.  \n  \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                                                                                                                               \n \ncredit  for  SDR69.0  million  (US$100  million  equivalent)  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  a  third  Poverty \nReduction Support Operation, 25 May 2004. \n\n5  ADB. 2004.

As a multisector instrument covering a range of \nissues related to poverty reduction, the Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) and the program loan provide an \nopportunity to advance restructuring of the economy to achieve equitable economic growth and well-being. The \nCPRGS is an important vehicle to reduce poverty and improve social service delivery and other social indicators in a \nsustainable manner. This will be achieved by implementing a broad-based reform agenda, which has its foundation on \nthree key pillars: (i) transition to a market economy, (ii) social inclusion and environmental sustainability, and (iii) \nmodern governance. The policy reform agenda involves trade integration, and reforms for state-owned enterprises \n(SOEs), financial sector, infrastructure, education, health, land, water, environment, planning process, public financial \nmanagement, financial accountability, public administration, and anticorruption. These reforms are valuable essential \ncontributors for achieving poverty reduction, growth, and social development in a sustainable, equitable, and cost-\neffective manner. The reforms are multisector and interlinked and will have direct and indirect positive impacts on \npoverty reduction and social services delivery at all levels, at different degrees. The program loan, which follows the \nPRSC III framework, calls for accelerating the policy changes and reforms that increase efficiency, transparency, and \naccountability; and stimulate growth, thereby reducing poverty and improving social services to poor people. The \nCPRGS and thus the program loan, are consistent with the poverty reduction strategy, the Country Strategy and \nProgram for Viet Nam (2002\u20132004), the Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement (2002) with Viet Nam of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), and the attainment of the Viet Nam Development Goals, the country version of the \nMillennium Development Goals .  \n \n\nPoverty Analysis        \n\nB. \n        Proposed Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n\nA comprehensive poverty analysis was jointly carried out as background to the preparation of the PRSC III1. Viet \nNam\u2019s achievements in terms of social development and poverty reduction have been remarkable. Almost one third of \ntotal population was lifted out of poverty in less then 10 years. Poverty incidence was halved during 1993\u20132002. \nEconomic growth underpinned the rapid poverty reduction. The elasticity of poverty reduction to economic growth was \nhigher than one. \n \nThe decline in poverty was widespread as the increase in inequality has been modest so far. Social indicators \nimproved markedly, positioning Viet Nam well to attain key Millennium Development Goals. The last decade was thus \ncharacterized by undeniable progress in the lives of the Vietnamese population.  \n \nPoverty incidence is high in remote mountain and highland areas and in the pockets of densely populated deltas and \nriver basins.  \n \nWhile decentralization has many advantages, the trend to decentralized government could amplify disparities between \nrich and poor regions, because rich regions have higher local resources and revenues, and thus will be able to spend \nsubstantially more on development and social services than the poorer regions, which are dependent on central \nGovernment transfers. Conscious of this phenomenon, the Government has preferential and special programs for the \npoor in these regions. Targeted programs, such as Program 135, are in place and have generally benefited the poor.  \n \nTo further reduce poverty and sustain the high level of economic growth, Viet Nam needs to remove structural \nweaknesses, promote socially and environmentally inclusive development, and modernize governance and the public \nadministration system. \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1  World  Bank.  2003.

The  report  was  distributed  at  the \n\nConsultative Group meeting on 2\u20133 December 2003. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n  43\n\n \nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\n \n\nYes \n\nStakeholder analysis undertaken? \n \nThe formulation of the CPRGS and the PRSCs (and thus the program loan) has involved comprehensive consultations \nand discussions with a wide range of stakeholders. It included stakeholder consultations with beneficiaries, national \nand local officials, development agencies, and nongovernment organizations. The international development \ncommunity has supported this process by financing studies, participatory poverty assessments, surveys, and analysis \nunder a number of activities, and continues to do so. The comprehensive Vietnam Development Report 2004 involved \nseven major development agencies, including ADB. This report provided an input for the PRSC III and the program \nloan. Monitoring and evaluation is included under the CPRGS and annual progress reports are submitted to the \nConsultative Group meeting. Participatory studies and evaluation are continuously initiated on topics related to the \nimplementation performance of the CPRGS, often funded by participating development agencies, including ADB \ntechnical assistance. \n \nStakeholder Participation? \n \nParticipatory processes were followed during the formulation of the CPGRS and PRSC III. Development agencies \nfinanced comprehensive participatory poverty assessments and participatory evaluations of key programs for the poor. \nThe participatory poverty assessments, which were carried out during July-August 2003, covered 12 provinces. \nParticipatory processes will be advanced during implementation of the CPRGS, for instance, at the local level in the \ncontext of decentralization. The pillar III reforms aim at encouraging greater participation of the poor, ethnic minorities \nand other marginalized groups in decision making at the commune level. These are envisaged in the new Budget Law \nand the Grassroots Democracy Decree. Training support, career development, and mechanisms to increase \nparticipation of these groups (large and small) in local authorities, management boards, and service delivery are being \npromoted by the Government working jointly with development agencies, including ADB. \n \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n\nYes    \n\n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe CPRGS and PRSC III support actions to benefit women. The Government is committed to gender equality \nthrough policies and actions that will warrant a gender sensitive implementation of the program loan. The Government \nhas signed the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women; the National Committee \nfor the Advancement of Women has been established and comprises 18 members at the deputy-minister level from \nkey ministries and central organizations; a National Strategy for the Advancement of Women in Viet Nam by 2010 is in \nplace (This strategy includes discrete targets for 2010, which relate to equal rights for women in labor, employment, \neducation, and health care; an increase in the number of woman candidates for leadership positions at all levels and \nin all sectors; and strengthening of the machinery for the advancement of women. The 2001\u20132005 National Plan of \nAction for Advancement of Women guides the first 5 years of implementation of the National Strategy; the National \nAssembly in 2003 adopted a resolution to draft and promulgate a law on gender equality, and an 11-member drafting \ncommittee has been appointed, headed by the president of the Vietnam Women\u2019s Union; and the Social Safety Net \nFund for separated SOE workers has a special focus on women. The Government asked ADB to provide advisory \ntechnical assistance to support the preparation of this law.2 ADB has also supported gender mainstreaming in the \nagriculture sector. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nA social and poverty impact assessment of the program loan has been prepared and is presented as Supplementary \nAppendix A). The appendix includes an assessment on gender, as well as the impact of the program loan on gender \ndevelopment.

First, it will promote growth and \ncreate employment through greater internal and external competition, accelerate the divestiture of SOEs and \nSOCBs, establish a sound regulatory framework, and improve transparency and accountability in SOE operations \nand in the financial sector. Second, it will advance human development and economic growth through; an expanded \nbudget appropriation and higher quality standards for education; resources to cover the health care costs of the \npoor; mechanisms to complete the transfer of land-use rights to households, more secure asset ownership in the \nform of a new land law especially in upland and ethnic minority areas; and measures to improve environmental and \nwater resources management. Third, the program loan will increase transparency and accountability of public \nfinances; promote simplified administrative procedures; reduce corruption, and revamp the planning processes as \npart of a broader effort to build modern governance. The reforms will pursue the attainment of well-specified \ndevelopment goals based on empirical analysis and wider consultations.  \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n  49\n\nPossible Channels \nof Effect \n\nEffects on the Poor \n\nEffects on Other \nStakeholders \n\nMitigation or \n\nEnhancement Measures \n\n \nThe reforms will result in increased private investment and exports, which will lead to additional job creation. Further \ndecentralization of public administration leading to better service delivery to the poor and increased local beneficiary \nparticipation are other expected benefits. Through appropriate measures and proactive programs, the Government \nwill need to mitigate the potential adverse economic, social, and environmental impacts of increased trade \nopenness, reduction in state enterprises, and liberalization in land transactions.  \n \nStrong direct and indirect benefits are expected to reach the poor in terms of increased and more rewarding \nemployment opportunities, improved service delivery, decentralized planning, and promotion of beneficiary \nparticipation. Any increase in employment opportunity and efficiency gain in service delivery will directly benefit the \npoor. The Government has special programs and policies in place to ensure that women and the poor have access \nto jobs, basic health services, education, and infrastructure, especially in the mountainous regions and in poor \nurban areas, and have priority. Its commitment to enhancing the well-being of ethnic minorities is reflected in the \ncountry\u2019s constitution and the creation in 1983 of the Committee for Ethnic Minorities with ministry status. \n \nGreater exposure to world markets could lead to higher risk/variability in prices and hence the income of wage \nearners and farmers, but its overall impact is likely to be positive for the rural sector. Analytical work is ongoing for \nthe coffee sector. Further commercialization of the economy may increase inequality, unless rectifying measures \nare taken early. An assessment of the poverty and social impact of WTO accession is being undertaken, and \nincludes a combination of analyses at three levels (a computable general equilibrium model to predict chances in \nprices of goods and services; regional models to determine changes in prices of factors of production that are not \nmobile, such as land and labor; and estimated impact on consumption at the household level). The regions of Hanoi \nand Ho Chi Minh City are expected to benefit most from WTO accession, while the poverty reduction effect for the \nmountainous areas could be more modest.  \n \nRestructuring and divesting of SOEs will cause labor retrenchment. To offset the adverse impact of retrenchment, \nthe Government has established a fund for retrenched SOE workers. This fund has been in place since mid-2002 \nand a recent evaluation rates the fund as highly effective.  \n \nReliance on market forces and private sector involvement in providing basic services could help expand the \navailability of services and create new employment opportunities, but prices of services may go up. To minimize \nsuch impacts, basic services for low-income groups are provided free of charge or at reduced costs and as part of \nsafety nets. These programs already exist but may need to be expanded depending on the scope and pace of \nprivatization/cost recovery. Careful consideration must be given to interregional equity when reforming service \ndelivery, particularly for health, education, transportation, and communication infrastructure.  \n \nDecentralization should make local level government more accountable to the poorest for their participation in \ndecision making on development programs and delivery of services. The current participation of the poor in the \nplanning and decision-making process is low. Poor households are usually physically remote and socially \nmarginalized. The Government has programs in place to accelerate access to social services and education for the \npoor and ethnic minorities in remote areas. \n \nThe new land law is expected to benefit poor and vulnerable people. As the land market develops in the medium \nterm, the potential adverse social impacts may have to be addressed. Two studies on the potential implications of a \nland market will be undertaken as part of the preparation of PRSC IV. Studies on land markets are also under way \nas part of the ongoing Making Markets Work Better for the Poor project being implemented by ADB.  \n \nIncomplete structural reform could jeopardize growth and stability in the longer term. A fiduciary risk is associated \nwith inadequate progress on enhancing budget transparency and tackling corruption. Haphazard introduction of \nmarket forces in the social sectors, and the trend toward decentralization have put service delivery under strain. At \nthe same time, fast integration with the world economy may lead to increased inequality, at least temporarily, as the \nbenefits accrue to specific regions and skills disproportionately. Growth in Viet Nam could become less inclusive in \nthe years to come. These issues are well understood and several programs are already well established to offset \nthe adverse effects. \n \nFurther details are presented in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n\n \n\n\f50\n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n\nLIST OF INELIGIBLE ITEMS \n \n\nimported  goods  (excluding  any  duties  or \n\nThe proceeds of the loan will be utilized to finance foreign exchange expenditures for the \n1. \nreasonable  cost  of \ntaxes)  required  during \nimplementation  of  the  program  loan  for  Support  to  Implementation  of  Poverty  Reduction \nProgram.
