Improving  urban  infrastructure  will  contribute  to  long-term \npoverty reduction and improve the quality of life, particularly the health status of about 100,000 \nurban residents, in five project counties.2\n  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nThe development of XUAR is a top priority for the PRC. XUAR is one of the poorest and \n3. \nmost remote regions in the northwest with a large ethnic minority population of 46% Uygur and \n15% other minority ethnic groups.3\n Around 97% of the population lives in an oasis belt covering \nonly  8%  of  the  region's  total  land  area.  Water  availability  is  a  critical  concern  to  the  fragile \necology of XUAR, which is predominantly a desert territory characterized by strong winds, low \nrainfall,  and  a  high  evaporation  rate.  Recognizing  the  need  for  greater  national  support,  the \nGovernment  of  the  PRC  inaugurated  a  counterpart  or  twinning  scheme  whereby  assistance \nfrom  other  provinces  and/or  municipalities  will  be  used  to  strengthen  capacity  in  XUAR  and \nimprove local living standards. In May 2010, the government outlined a number of policies and \nmeasures to aid XUAR\u2019s development. Nineteen nominated provinces and/or municipalities will \nprovide  financial  contributions  from  2011  to  2020  to  achieve  noticeable  impacts.  Under  this \nscheme,  Heilongjiang  and  Jilin  provinces  in  the  northeast  PRC  will  jointly  support  project \ncounties in Altay. \n \n4. \nAltay  is  the  northernmost  area  in  XUAR.  It  comprises  one  city  (Altay  City)  and  six \ncounties  (Buerjin,  Fuhai,  Fuyun,  Habahe,  Jimunai,  and  Qinghe);  and  shares  a  border  totaling \n1,175  kilometers  (km)  with  Kazakhstan,  Mongolia,  and  the  Russian  Federation.  Altay\u2019s  total \npopulation of 658,000 comprises 51.4% Kazakh, 41.6% Han, and 7% other ethnic groups. While \n44%  of  the  population  is  urban,  about  16%  of  the  urban  population  lives  below  the  official \npoverty line, with Jimunai and Qinghe designated as national poverty counties. The XUAR and \nAltay Prefecture governments have accorded high priority to infrastructure improvement, which \nwill also benefit neighboring countries through the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \n(CAREC)4\n program.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  supports  the  promotion  of  regional \ntrade  through  this  program  and  is  working  with  other  development  partners  to  advance  cross-\nborder  cooperation.  Along  with  other  areas  in  XUAR,  Altay  City  and  Kanas  Scenic  Zone  in \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance.

Its goal is to improve living standards and to reduce poverty in CAREC \ncountries through more efficient and effective regional economic cooperation. To date, the program has focused on \nfinancing infrastructure projects and improving the region's policy environment in priority areas of transport, energy, \nand trade policy and facilitation. ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Logistics \nDevelopment and Capacity Building in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\nBuerjin are involved in two ongoing ADB-loan-funded urban projects in the region.5\n \n \n5. \nAltay suffers from a very harsh climate, with subzero temperatures between October and \nMarch,  and  annual  precipitation  of  about  180  millimeters  but  high  evaporation  of  about \n2,000 millimeters. It has scenic mountains, lakes, rivers, desert, and meadows, making tourism \none of its pillar industries. Currently, its top-ranked tourist destination is the Kanas Scenic Zone, \nfollowed  by  other  developing  tourist  destinations  such  as  the  White  Birch  Scenic  Area  in \nHabahe, and Qinghe. Altay has four land ports with access to Kazakhstan and Mongolia. While \ntourism  and  cross-border  trade  have  the  potential  to  contribute  to  economic  growth  and  job \ncreation,  particularly  for  the  ethnic  population  residing  in  these  border  towns,  it  also  relies  on \ngood accommodation, excellent delivery of municipal services, safe and available transport, and \na pristine environment. \n \nAcross Altay, infrastructure facilities are inadequate to meet existing demand and hinder \n6. \nthe expansion of local economies. Road surfaces are severely damaged by winter freezing and \ntraffic, and the road network is incomplete. Utilities are either nonexistent or are old, fragile, and \nmostly  insufficient,  resulting  in  frequent  service  failures  and  environmental  pollution.  Water \nsupply  capacity  is  restricted  by  inadequate  infrastructure  and  water quality  is  compromised  by \nhigh  seasonal  turbidity.  Most  of  the  county  areas  lack  sewers,  and  wastewater  treatment \ncapacity  is  marginal.  Refuse  collection  and  disposal  are  poorly  managed,  and  most  landfills \nresemble unregulated dumping grounds. Decentralized heating plants have low-efficiency, coal-\nfired  boilers  while  hot  water  distribution  has  limited  coverage,  thus  creating  serious  pollution \nproblems  in  urban  areas.  All  of  these  threaten  human  health,  pollute  the  environment,  and \nconstrain  necessary  improvements  in  living  standards.  Therefore,  comprehensive  urban \ninfrastructure improvements are needed urgently.6\n \n \n7. \nIn view of the experiences and lessons obtained from the previous urban projects in the \nPRC,  the  project  design  features  multisector  integrated  approaches.  The  project  will  thus \nprovide essential road, water supply, wastewater and solid waste management, and centralized \nheating  infrastructure  to  five  county  seat  towns  in  Altay  and  the  Takeshiken  Land  Port.  The \nholistic  approach  to  better  infrastructure  will  (i)  improve  living  conditions  and  the  urban \nenvironment, (ii) support tourism to enhance inclusive growth, and (iii) help raise the efficiency \nat  land  ports.  This  will  assist  Altay\u2019s  growing  cross-border  trade  and  tourism,  create  favorable \nconditions for trade-related  investment  and  employment,  and  expedite  the  development  of  the \nprocessing and service industries, all critical for poverty alleviation. \n \n8. \nLow-impact  urban  development  with  low  carbon  footprint. The  project  will  support \nthe  government\u2019s  strategy  in  the  12th  Five-Year  Plan  to  build  environment-friendly  and \nresource-efficient  towns.  A  parallel  technical  assistance  initiated  by  ADB\u2014the  Resource-\nEfficient  Towns  Development  in  the  Xinjiang  Altay  Area 7\u2014has  highlighted  initiatives  to  limit \nimpacts  of  urban  activity  on  the  environment.  This  technical  assistance  developed  a  plan8\n to \npromote reduction, reuse, and recycling (3Rs) approaches to municipal service delivery and the \napplication  of  renewable  energy  use,  which  have  been  incorporated  in  the  project  design  and \nimplementation.  In  particular,  the  promotion  of  the  3Rs  will  recommend  service  delivery \nimprovements such as solid waste recycling, water demand management, wastewater effluents \n                                                \n5  ADB.  2008.

It  also  provides  for  a public \ninformation and training campaign to build awareness and ensure the effective application of the \n3Rs principle. Wastewater treatment schemes will also provide effluents and sludge suitable for \nirrigation  and  fertilization  of  windbreak  forest  in  arid  lands,  thus  avoiding  the  need  to  abstract \nraw river water or discharge polluting effluents to the rivers, which addresses water scarcity by \nsaving  the  raw  water  and  also  conforms to  ADB\u2019s Water  Policy.9\n Well-managed  potable  water \nsupply, wastewater reuse, solid waste recycling, and reduced pollution through improvements in \nthe centralized heating system are vital in keeping the environment and economy sustainable.  \n \n9. \nEnhanced  long-term  operational  efficiency  and  sustainability.  The  project  is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s strategic priorities in support of urban infrastructure development. Based \non  the  lessons  learned  on  the  importance  of  securing  operation  sustainability,  the  project  will \nprovide  an  institutional  capacity  building  program  for  implementing  agencies  and  for  future \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  units.  Owing  to  the  small  scale  and  remote  location,  an \nindividual component may not have either the skilled personnel or the capacity to engage them \nfull-time.  Therefore,  the  project  will  set  up  regional  technical  support  groups  for  municipal \nengineering management. Under the scheme, the project counties will develop and share their \ntechnical capacities. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  will  be  better  living  standards  and  conditions  in  the  project  counties.  The \n10. \noutcome will be integrated and more efficient municipal services in the project counties of Altay. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n11. \nThe  project  will  implement  26  components  based  on  seven  main  outputs.  These  are \n(i) construction and/or upgrading of 59.1 km of roads of varying widths and capacities, including \nlighting,  signage,  and  traffic  controls;  (ii)  water  supply  including  better  quality  raw  water \nabstraction, four new water supply plants with a total capacity of 16,890 cubic meters per day, \nand laying of water pipes with a total length of 153.3 km; (iii) wastewater treatment and disposal \nconsisting of six new  wastewater treatment plants with a total capacity of 31,200 cubic meters \nper day and 78 km of collector and trunk sewers; (iv) solid waste management comprising five \nnew  sanitary  landfills  with  a  total  capacity  of  238  tons  per  day,  11  km  of  access  roads,  10-\nkilovolt power line, transfer stations, multiple waste collection points, and provision of transport \nand auxiliary equipment, and environmental improvement of five existing landfills; (v) centralized \nheating  supply  including  two  new  or  upgraded  central-heating,  coal-fired  boiler  stations,  15 \nheating  exchange  stations,  and  heating  pipes  with  a  length  of  17.8  km;  (vi)  construction  of \ninfrastructure  in  White  Birch  Forest  Scenic  Area;  and  (vii)  capacity  building  that  will  include \nintensive  project  management  and  implementation  training  for  the  Altay  project  management \noffice  (PMO)  and  county  PMOs,  and  additional  capacity  assistance  for  other  agencies \nconcerned. 10  A  detailed  description  of  the  outputs  and  components  is  in  the  project \nadministration manual (PAM).11\n  \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $168.52 million (Table 1). \n\n12. \n \n\n                                                \n9  ADB. 2003.

Altay PMO includes staff from \nthe above-listed agencies. \nEach county has set up a PMO to coordinate and \nresolve interdepartmental issues.  \n\nMost of the O&M units nominated are the current \nservice providers. This enables the best use of \nexisting local O&M capacity. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nAspects  \nProcurement \n \n\nConsulting services \nRetroactive financing \nand/or advance \ncontracting \n\nDisbursement \n\nICB  \nNCB  \nShopping \nQCBS \nAdvance contracting and \nretroactive financing \napproved  \n\nArrangements \n\n4 contracts \n74 contracts \n1 contract \n111 person-months \nFive civil works contracts and a consulting service \ncontract will be procured through advance contracting. \nUp to $20 million (20% of the ADB loan) incurred \nbefore loan effectiveness but not earlier than 12 \nmonths before the loan agreement is signed. \n\n$10.4 million \n$111.5 million \n$0.01 million \n$1.50 million \n\nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed \nupon between the government and ADB. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, APG = Altay Prefecture Government, ICB = international competitive bidding, NCB \n=  national  competitive  bidding,  O&M  =  operation  and  maintenance,  PLG  =  project  leading  group,  PMO  =  project \nmanagement  office,  QCBS  =  quality-  and  cost-based  selection,  XUAR  =  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region, \nXUARG = Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Government. \nSource: ADB. \n \n16. \nThe project includes funding for international and national consulting services to support \nthe  executing  agency  and  implementing  agencies  in  addition  to  building  capacity  of  the  O&M \nunits.12\n \n\n The terms of reference for consulting services are in the PAM. \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n17. \nThe project will directly benefit about 100,000 people in Altay, of which about 16,000 or \n16%  live  below  the  official  poverty  line.  It  will  improve  infrastructure  facilities  and  the  urban \nenvironment in five border counties of Altay through building road network facilities; new water \nsupply, wastewater, and solid waste treatment facilities; central heating systems; and enhancing \nwater  resources  management,  solid  waste  recycling,  and  disposal  management.  Net \nenvironmental benefits will also be gained from the closure of polluting and inefficient landfills, \nwastewater  treatment  facilities,  and  heating  centers.  The  reuse  of  wastewater  in  revegetating \ndesert fringe areas will also prevent land degradation. \n \nA. \n\nTechnical \n\ntaking \n\ninto  account \n\nAll  project  components  are  designed \n\n18. \nlocal  circumstances, \ntopography,  and  climate  (predominantly  flat  arid  terrain  but  with  long,  harsh  winters),  and  in \naccordance with relevant PRC design guidelines and local regulations. The processes selected \nfor water and wastewater treatment as presented in local feasibility study reports are relatively \neasy  to  operate  and  maintain,  and  appropriate  for  small  towns  where  technical  capacity  is \nlimited.  The  component  designs  also  incorporate  the  3Rs  approaches  and  renewable  energy \nuse. Capacity building to ensure adequate skills for O&M will be financed under the loan. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nEconomic  analysis 13\n\n19. \n (cost\u2013benefit)  was  conducted  for  15  of  the  26  components  and \nincluded  the  calculation  of  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR).  The  economic \nopportunity  cost  of  capital  was  assumed  to  be  12%.  The  EIRR  of  all  components  analyzed \nranged from 14.5% to 18.7%, and was thus above the economic opportunity cost of capital.  For \nthe  11  components  for  which  the  EIRR  was  not  calculated,  a  least-cost  (cost-effectiveness) \n                                                \n12 To be provided through a firm using quality- and cost-based selection in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \n\nUse of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \n\n13  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fanalysis  was  applied.  Financial  analysis 14\n of  components  was  undertaken  to  determine  the \ncapacity  of  implementing  agencies  to  recover  project  costs,  including  debt  service  obligations \nand  O&M  costs.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  was  calculated  for  revenue-generating \ncomponents. Financial internal rates of return for the sectors are: 4.8% for solid waste, 14.3% \nfor  heating,  3.9%  for  wastewater,  and  4.1%  for  water  supply.  These  figures  are  all  above  the \naverage weighted cost of capital, which ranges from 2.3% to 2.7% for separate sectors. \n \n20. \nTariffs for water, wastewater, and solid waste will need to be increased when the ADB-\nfinanced facilities come into operation. Tariffs will be increased gradually until full cost recovery \nis achieved, taking into account affordability factors.15\n Subsidies will be provided to cover O&M \nwhere  revenues  are  insufficient.  The  tariff  subsidy  for  the  poor  (minimum  living  standards \nguarantee  recipients)  will  be  maintained.  The  project  will  provide  capacity  building  on  tariff \nsetting and tariff reforms. The affordability of tariffs was calculated for all households and for the \nsubset  of  low-income  (poor)  households.  Combined  tariffs  for  water,  wastewater,  and  solid \nwaste ranged from 0.5% to 1.9% of the income for average households across project counties, \nand  between  0.6%  and  2.3%  for  low-income  households.  For  project  counties  with  heating \nsubcomponents, combined  tariffs for  water,  wastewater,  solid  waste,  and  heating ranged from \n1.2% to 3.6% of the income of average households and between 1.5% and 3.9% for low-income \nhouseholds.  This  is  within  the  acceptable  range  of  affordability,  as  measured  against  the \ninternational  benchmark  that  such  services  should  not  exceed  5%  of  household  income. \nRegarding the 10 nonrevenue-generating components, a sustainability analysis was undertaken \nof  county  governments\u2019  revenues  and  expenditures.  They  indicate  that  the  project  will  not  put \nundue strain on their ability to provide counterpart funds during implementation and meet debt \nservicing.  Project  counterpart  requirements  in  the  highest  year  (2012),  when  compared  with \nrevenues  in  2009,  range  from  2.5%  to  5.0%  of  the  governments\u2019  revenue  base.  A  financial \nmanagement  assessment  concluded  that  the  financial  management  capacity  of  implementing \nagencies is adequate for the implementation of the project. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n21. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith XUARG, APG, and the project county governments. The procurement capacity assessment \nconcluded  that  procurement  capacity  of  the  Altay  PMO  and  the  procedural  arrangements  in \nplace  are  adequate  to  enable  full  compliance  with  ADB  procurement  guidelines.  The  specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM.  \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nLiving conditions in areas of the project county seats are poor, particularly during winter \n22. \nand spring, when garbage accumulates and well water becomes contaminated. The project will \nprovide  households  with  access  to  safe  and  reliable  water  supply,  and  better  roads,  heating, \nand  physical  living  environment.  Public  awareness  programs  and  implementation  of  the  3Rs \nprinciple will ensure the positive and long-term social benefits of the project. Unemployment is \nthe main cause of poverty in the project counties, and job creation will have a significant impact \non  poverty  reduction.  Construction  activities  will  directly  create  1,465  temporary  jobs,  and \nindirectly 3,809 temporary jobs. The O&M will directly create an estimated 353 permanent jobs, \nand indirectly 565 jobs. Many temporary jobs will be unskilled, and contractors are required to \nemploy  local  workers  when  possible.  The  Altay  PMO  has  set  employment  targets  for  women \nand ethnic minorities. County community offices and the Labor Bureau will assist the contractors \nin  realizing these targets.  Implementing  agencies  will  ensure that all  PRC  labor  laws  and  core \nlabor  standards  are  respected.  This  will  be  closely  monitored  under  the  project  performance \n                                                \n14  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 Project Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nmonitoring system. Details on specific measures to ensure the poverty and social benefits are in \nthe gender action plan, social action plan in the PAM, and ethnic minority development plan.16\n \n \n23. \nAt the macro level, current infrastructure in project county seats is inadequate to support \neconomic  expansion.  Despite  the  existence  of  an  educated  urban  population  and  its  specific \ngeographic and cultural conditions, Altay, due to infrastructure constraints, is yet to materialize \nits  economic  potential,  particularly  in  the  fields  of  tourism  and  cross-border  trade.  The  project \nwill  aid  Altay\u2019s  growing  tourism  and  cross-border  trade  by  providing  an  enabling  condition  to \nexpedite  development  of  the  related  service  industries,  which  are  the  engine  for  growth  and \npoverty alleviation. \n \n24. \nGender  benefits.  The  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  More \neffective  infrastructure  will  result  in  reduced  time  burdens,  and  greater  mobility,  access,  and \npublic health. Women strongly support the project across all county seats, as it will improve their \nquality  of  life,  public  health,  and  create  jobs  and  income  opportunities.  Gender  has  been \nmainstreamed  into  the  project  design  (features  such  as  road  lighting,  nonmotorized  transport, \nand pedestrian access are included); and a project gender action plan has been prepared that \nwill  (i)  ensure  women\u2019s  consultation  and  participation  in  project  activities;  (ii)  provide  gender-\nsensitivity  training  to  the  county  PMO  and  implementing  agency  staff;  (iii)  ensure  that  project \ndecision-making bodies and participants in capacity building activities are gender-balanced; and \n(iv) include appropriate gender targets, indicators, and sex-disaggregated data.17\n \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n25. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  category  A  in  ADB\u2019s  environmental  categorization.  The \nproject environmental impact assessment (EIA) was posted on the ADB website on 9 November \n2010 and circulated to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors on 12 November 2010. The EIA complies with \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  Extensive  public  consultation  involving  surveys, \nmeetings  with  stakeholders,  and  focus  group  discussions  was  undertaken  during  the \npreparation  of  the  EIA.  The  EIA  concludes  that  the  project  has  substantial  environmental  and \nsocioeconomic  benefits  resulting  from  integrated  improvements  in  urban  transportation,  water \nsupply,  sewage  collection  and  treatment,  urban  solid  waste  treatment  and  management,  and \ndistrict heating facilities. The specific environmental concerns of the project during construction \ninclude  soil  erosion,  dust  generation,  and  closure  and  decommissioning  of  replaced  facilities. \nDuring  operation,  concerns  include  secondary  pollution  from  the  wastewater  treatment  plant \nsludge,  wastewater  and  landfill  leachate,  as  well  as  cumulative  impacts  on  downstream  water \nusers. Such concerns have been fully dealt with in the environmental management plan and the \nenvironmental  monitoring  plan.  Comprehensive  river  basin  analyses  and  water  balances  have \nconfirmed  that  the  impact  on  the  region\u2019s  sensitive  surface  water  resources  will  be  positive \nregarding  water  quality  and  acceptable  regarding  water  quantities.  The  reuse  of  treated \nwastewater  to  irrigate  windbreak forests  will  help  combat  land  degradation  and  desertification. \nSavings in carbon dioxide emissions will accrue from the rationalization of urban road transport \nand road connectivity, the replacement of aging heating facilities, and the carbon sequestration \nprovided  by  irrigated  forest  plantations.  The  Altay  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  setting  up  the \nenvironmental  management  system,  consisting  of  inspection,  monitoring,  reporting,  and \ninitiating  corrective  actions  or  measures.  Environmental  monitoring  and  reporting  will  continue \nduring operation, at the minimum on an annual basis. Each implementing agency will nominate \ndedicated, \nfor \nimplementing  the  environmental  management  plan.  A  detailed  training  program  for  capacity \n\ntrained,  and  qualified  environment  specialists  who  will  be  responsible \n\n                                                \n16  Gender Action Plan, Project Administration Manual, and Ethnic Minority Development Plan (accessible from the list \n\nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n17  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fbuilding and a project-wide grievance redress mechanism have been developed and included in \nthe project EIA.18\n  \n\n26. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  category  A  for  the  involuntary  resettlement  safeguard.  The \nproject  will  acquire  about  51.47  hectares  (ha)  of  collective  land,  of  which  40.77  ha  (79%)  is \nclassified as grassland. It will also acquire 68.7 ha of state-owned land. A total of 16,144 square \nmeters  of  residential  houses  and  2,773  square  meters  of  shops  and  enterprises  will  be \ndemolished.  Overall,  permanent \nland  acquisition  and  house  demolition  will  affect \n205 households  and  657  persons  in  the  project  counties.  Among  these,  353  will  be  ethnic \nminority  people,  accounting  for  54%.  To  attenuate  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts, \nresettlement plans have been developed for each county. County governments have endorsed \nthe  resettlement  plans,  and  have  disclosed  them  in  the  community  and  village  offices  and  to \n19 in  both  the  Chinese  and  Kazakh  languages  on  14  and  17  February  2011. \naffected  persons\nResettlement plans have also been posted on the ADB website. Compensation for lost assets \nand  resettlement  allowance  will  be  paid  to  the  affected  persons  before  construction  activities \nbegin, and the livelihood rehabilitation arrangements made in accordance with the resettlement \nplans.  Each  county  PMO  and  PIU  will  have  at  least  two  full-time  resettlement  staff,  and  each \nPIU  will  carry  out  internal  supervision  and  monitoring  to  ensure  compliance  with  resettlement \nplan  provisions.  An  independent  agency  will  be  engaged  to  conduct  the  semiannual  external \nmonitoring  and  evaluation.  The  total  cost  estimate  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is \nCNY56.9 million or $8.4 million in 2010 prices, including contingencies.20\n ADB staff and external \nmonitoring  institution  will  supervise  and  monitor  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plans  to \nminimize grievances of the affected persons. \n\nThe  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  the  indigenous  peoples  safeguard.  Ethnic \n27. \nminorities  are  the  majority  population  in  the  project  area.  All  households  in  urban  areas  will \nbenefit  from  the  new  infrastructure.  Not  all  ethnic  minority  people  speak  Chinese.  A  project \nethnic  minority  development  plan  has  been  prepared  that  focuses  on  measures  to  aid  the \ninclusion of ethnic minority men and women in all project activities and to protect them from any \ndisadvantages  that  language  barriers  may  create  with  respect  to  employment  by  project \ncontractors. It also includes measures to ensure that their customs and beliefs will be respected \nthroughout  implementation.  Ethnic  minorities  will  not  be  adversely  affected,  except  in  the \ncontext  of  resettlement.  Livelihood  restoration  measures  associated  with  resettlement  are \nincorporated in the resettlement plans. The project ethnic minority development plan endorsed \nby  the government  has been disclosed  on  11  February  2011  in  both the  Chinese  and  Kazakh \nlanguages  to  ethnic  minority  people  targeted  by  the  project.  The  ethnic  minority  development \nplan  has  also  been  uploaded  on  the  ADB  website.  Detailed  monitoring  and  reporting \narrangements are included in the PAM and the project agreement.\n\n21\n \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n28.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. The  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  of the \nproject are expected to outweigh the costs and risks.22\n \n                                                \n18 Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) trigger for involuntary resettlement changed the terminology of \"affected \npersons\" to \"displaced persons\", which are defined as persons who are physically and/or economically displaced \nas  a  result  of  involuntary  acquisition  of  land  or  involuntary  restrictions  on  land  use  or  on  access  to  legally \ndesignated  parks  and  protected  areas.
