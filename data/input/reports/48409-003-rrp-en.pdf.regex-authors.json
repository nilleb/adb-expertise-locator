THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of the Union of Myanmar for the Climate-Friendly Agribusiness Value Chains Sector \nProject. The report also describes the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the \nGlobal Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP) for the project and if the Board approves \nthe proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the \nadministration of the grant.1  \n2.  The  proposed  project  supports  fulfilling  the  government\u2019s  Agriculture  Development \nStrategy  (ADS),  2018\u20132023  and  the  National  Export  Strategy,  2015-2019  by  boosting \ncompetitiveness in value chains for rice, beans, pulses, and oilseeds in the Magway, Mandalay, \nand Sagaing regions in the central dry zone (CDZ).2  The project will increase climate resilience \nfor critical rural infrastructure, promote quality and safety testing capacity, strengthen technical \nand institutional capacity for climate-smart agriculture (CSA), and create an enabling policy \nenvironment for climate-friendly agribusinesses. The project will reduce food insecurity and rural \npoverty, increase incomes and access to markets for smallholders and poor landless households, \nand improve resource efficiency and environmental sustainability for agribusinesses.    \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Sector performance. The Human Development Index report ranks Myanmar as 145th \nout of 188 countries.3 Myanmar\u2019s gross domestic product grew at 6.8% in 2017 and is projected \nto grow at 6.8% in 2018 and 7.2% in 2019.4 However, 32.1% of the population remains poor,5 and \nthe poverty incidence in the CDZ is high (43%).6  The CDZ has 15.4 million inhabitants, most of \nwhom (76%) live in rural areas; 58% of CDZ households depend on crops for their livelihoods. \nTackling rural poverty is critical to ensure sustainable development in the CDZ. In 2016 agriculture \naccounted for 30% of gross domestic product, 60% of employment, 29% of value addition, and \n23% of exports (including $1.1 billion in pulses alone).7 Crop production accounts for 72% of farm \noutput. As a percentage of national production, the CDZ produces 25% of rice, 48% of pulses, \nand 89% of sesame. The potential for developing the value chains of these crops is significant. \n4.  Development challenges. Despite good resource endowments, agricultural production \nand productivity remain low, primarily due to (i) poor infrastructure, (ii) low-quality inputs, (iii) weak \ninstitutional capacity, (iv) limited access to finance, and (v) high vulnerability to climate risks.8 A \nfarmer in Myanmar earns only about $1.80\u2013$2.50 per day compared to $10\u2013$16.50 in Thailand \nand $7.80 in the Philippines (footnote 5). Most farms are small, subsistence-level holdings with \nlow productivity (average paddy yields in Myanmar are 2.7 tons per hectare versus a potential \nyield of 6.8 tons per hectare). Low usage and quality of certified seed and agro-chemicals, limited \n                                                \n1  GAFSP was established by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development as trustee. \n2  Government of Myanmar, Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation. 2018.

Tokyo. \n7  The European Chamber of Commerce in Myanmar. 2017. Myanmar: Agriculture Guide 2018. Yangon. \n8  The average farm size in Myanmar (3 hectares) is more than in other Asian countries. Four river systems supply \nmore than 19,000 cubic meters per capita of water each year, against an average 4,000 cubic meters across Asia.  \n \n ", "2 \n \nirrigation, and poor quality and safety of farm products also contribute to low sector performance. \nLess than 5% of rice farmers in the CDZ use certified seed, while pulse and oilseed farmers use \nalmost none. Private seed providers have been unable to produce enough to meet demand \nbecause of the poor business environment. Only 15% of crop area is irrigated, and more than \n50%  of  the  rural  population  lacks  access  to  all-season  roads,  hindering  farm-to-market \nconnectivity. Credit (which is often unavailable) is of short tenure, and given only to land owners. \nIncreased migration to urban areas and neighboring countries is worsening labor shortages. Farm \nmechanization is limited. Inefficient post-harvest operations such as drying are leading to reduced \nquality, and poor returns to farmers and processors. Most exported crops are unprocessed and \nsold to lower-value markets. Private sector investment in agribusiness is limited because of the \npoor enabling policy environment related to land use and administration.9 In Doing Business 2018, \nthe World Bank ranks Myanmar 171st out of 190 economies.10 During 1998\u20132017, only 23 \nagricultural enterprises attracted foreign direct investment, amounting to $380 million or 0.51% of \ntotal foreign direct investment (footnote 5). \n5.  Myanmar has one of the highest rankings in the 2017 global climate risk index.11 While \ntotal precipitation has changed little from 1990, the rainy season has shortened due to late onset \nand early withdrawal of the southwest monsoon, causing intense rainfall and flooding. Increasing \ntemperatures, shallow soils, a long dry season, the increasing frequency of severe droughts, and \npoor crop husbandry are adding substantial risk to agriculture. Climate change projections to 2050 \nsuggest Myanmar will experience longer dry spells and periods of heavy rains.12  \n6.  Opportunities. Policy reforms undertaken since 2011 have enhanced the potential for \ngrowth in the agricultural sector.13 Investing in infrastructure, capacity and the enabling policy \nenvironment can unlock agribusiness\u2019s potential. Improved access to certified seeds, water, and \nland and finance, and the use of quality agro-chemicals and climate- resilient varieties can lift crop \nproductivity to regional norms and address climate change. Investments in resilient farm roads \ncan increase market connectivity, while quality and safety testing of infrastructure can boost \nexport potential. The potential for exports can be enhanced by strengthening the capacity of \nsmallholders in good agricultural practices (GAPs) and CSA, and of agribusinesses in good \nmanufacturing practices and safety standards. Support for formulating climate- and investor-\nfriendly agribusiness policies, coupled with enhanced land administration and credit services at \nthe township level, can spur faster, better, and stronger agribusiness growth.   \n7.  Government\u2019s strategies. The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation (MOALI) \nhas developed the ADS, 2018\u20132023 (footnote 2), the agriculture sector second five-year plan, a \nrice sector development strategy, and a CSA strategy.14 The ADS aims to improve food security \nand agricultural competitiveness. The five-year sector plan aims to improve irrigation, crop \nproduction, agro-industry, markets, and research. The CSA strategy aims to achieve food and \nnutrition security and climate resiliency, with a globally competitive agriculture sector by 2030. \n8.  Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) value addition. The project includes innovations \nsuch as (i) improved design standards of rural infrastructure to make it climate-resilient and more \nsustainable, (ii) expanded use of advanced CSA technologies and practices, and (iii) promotion \n                                                \n9   Global Agriculture and Food Security Program. 2016.

The \nproject will support three pillars of the ADS (productivity, competitiveness, and governance) by \nenhancing the climate resilience of critical infrastructure, promoting CSA, formulating inclusive \nagribusiness policies, and helping the private sector to achieve efficiency and value addition. The \nproject will deploy climate-resilient varieties, enhance capacity, diversify livelihood options, and \nfoster public\u2013private partnerships by linking smallholder farmers and the private sector. By \ntargeting rice, bean, pulse, and oilseed value chains in up to 14 townships in the CDZ, the project \nwill focus on a region in Myanmar with some of the highest food insecurity, natural resource-poor, \nwater-stressed, and climate-vulnerable regions in Myanmar.15 With support from GAFSP grant, \nthe project will target poor landless households or those farming less than 2 hectares to drive an \ninclusive structural transformation of agriculture that empowers the rural poor, and particularly \nwomen, through improved access to water, land, finance, and the skills needed to engage in \nproductive livelihood activities.16  \n9.  Development coordination and lessons. The support of development partners focuses \non four key areas: (i) infrastructure, (ii) production enhancement, (iii) capacity development, and \n(iv) policies and governance.17 The project will contribute to all four areas. It will collaborate with \nthe Japan International Cooperation Agency and the World Bank on irrigation, the Livelihoods \nand Food Security Trust Fund on commercialization and financial inclusion, and the Food and \nAgricultural Organization of the United Nations on CSA. The project design incorporates lessons \nfrom projects funded by ADB and other development partners, and complements initiatives such \nas the GMS Core Agriculture Support Program, and agricultural value chain support by the \nIrrigated Agriculture Inclusive Development Project.18 Lessons call for (i) building infrastructure \nthat  supports  agricultural  value  addition;  (ii)  enhancing  smallholders\u2019  access  to  credit;                     \n(iii)  strengthening  land  management  and  administration  services;  (iv) improving  seed  value \nchains, product quality and safety standards; (iii) creating a policy environment for mobilizing \nprivate investments; and (iv) building capacity at every stage of value chains to meet demand in \nhigh-end domestic and international markets.      \n10.  Strategic fit. The project is aligned with the ADS, National Export Strategy (footnote 2), \nand CSA strategy (footnote 14).The project directly supports three of seven operational priorities \nof ADB Strategy 2030, including promoting rural development and food security; tackling climate \nchange, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; and \n                                                \n15 Townships, selected through a participatory, pro-poor, gender-inclusive approach against specific criteria, include \nPakokku, Magway, Aunglan, Natmauk, and Pwintbyu in Magway region; Mahlaing, Pyawbwe, Natogyi, Sintkaing in \nMandalay region; and Monywa, Shwebo, Sagaing, Yin Mar Bin, and Sarlangyi in Sagaing region.  \n16  The project, in cooperation with Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), will invest in five \ncomponents outlined in the GAFSP framework document: (i) raising agricultural productivity; (ii) linking farmers to \nmarket; (iii) reducing risk and vulnerability; (iv) improving non-farm rural livelihoods; and (v) technical assistance, \ninstitution building, and capacity development.

Impact and Outcome \n11.  The project aims to create an enabling environment that reduces the incidence of poverty, \nmalnutrition, and food insecurity among the rural poor. The project is aligned with the following \nimpact: agricultural competitiveness improved.21 The project will have the following outcome: \nproductive and resource-efficient agribusiness value chains in project areas developed.22 \nC.  Outputs \n12.  Output  1:  Critical  agribusiness  value  chain  infrastructure improved  and  made \nclimate-resilient. This output involves improving infrastructure to increase crop productivity and \ndiversification,  and  boost  agricultural  product  quality  and  safety.  Key  activities  include \n(i) upgrading  infrastructure  (irrigation,  farm  roads,  buildings,  farm  machinery,  post-harvest \nequipment,  seed  testing  equipment,  and  agrometeorological  stations)  in  10  Department  of \nAgriculture (DOA) seed farms for producing improved  climate-resilient seed of rice, beans, \npulses, and oilseeds; (ii) rehabilitating tertiary canals and community reservoirs, and constructing \nshallow tube wells (with some linked to drip and sprinkler technologies) to bring an additional \n13,000 hectares under irrigation to benefit up to 35,000 households; (iii) rehabilitating farm roads \nto climate-resilient condition for improved connectivity to markets and for farm mechanization; \nand (iv) upgrading the safety and quality testing equipment and instrumentation in MOALI Plant \nProtection Division\u2019s Pesticide Testing Laboratory and Food Safety Testing Laboratory, and the \nMinistry of Commerce Commodity Testing and Quality Management Laboratory to meet ISO \n17025 standards, and providing rapid food safety testing kits to DOA and the private sector.  \n13.  The project includes adaptation measures for designing infrastructure to withstand climate \nchange. It will enable DOA seed farms to link with the private sector, and marketing and business \ndevelopment services.  Further, the project will encourage lead seed growers and seed producer \nassociations to integrate under a public\u2013private partnership for seed multiplication being launched \nby the Livelihoods and Food Security Trust Fund to ensure a guaranteed market for lead seed \ngrowers. The project will also support forming and training water user groups to operate and \nmaintain tertiary canals, community reservoirs, and other water management infrastructure. An \nintegrated approach to operation and maintenance (O&M) focusing on institutions, capacity \nbuilding, financing, and technology will sustain infrastructure. \n14.  Output 2: Climate-smart agriculture and agribusiness promoted. This output will \nenhance capacity to integrate climate change concerns into agriculture and train farmers and \nagribusinesses  in  post-harvest  crop  handling to  improve quality  and  market  access,  value \naddition, and contract harvesting. Key activities include (i) deploying climate-resilient varieties of \n                                                \n19  ADB. 2017.

The project will identify beneficiaries of digital finance service (i.e., debit card) through a \ncommunity-driven development process established under the Enhancing Rural Livelihoods and \nIncomes Project (footnote 18). Farmers will have access to up to $300 in loans annually (secured \nagainst $100 from the project held in a compensating balance account by a competitively selected \nfinancial service provider) to buy improved seed, agrochemicals, and mechanization services. \nBeneficiaries must participate in training on GAPs and financial literacy to access this credit. \n16.  Output 3: Enabling environment for climate-friendly agribusiness enhanced. The \nproject will support MOALI and the Ministry of Commerce in crafting policies to promote private \nsector investments and expand access to high-end markets such as Japan. Key activities include \n(i) establishing an agribusiness policy cell within MOALI\u2019s Department of Planning for research \nand advocacy on policies related to land management, contract farming, tenure security, public-\nprivate partnerships, and on harmonization of quality and safety standards; (ii) raising awareness \nand capacity of financial institutions to support climate-friendly agribusinesses; (iii) enhancing \nweather,  market,  and  credit  information  networks;  and  (iv)  improving  delivery  of  land \nadministration services in townships by building capacity in participatory land management.  \nD.

The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace \n                                                \n23  Details in the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "6 \n \nperiod of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year \nthereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Sector \nlending modality is appropriate for this project as the government has a robust sector development \nplan (footnote 2) and has demonstrated adequate capacity to implement the plan. Overall sector \npolicies are adequate but need improvement to enable the growth of agribusinesses. The modality \nalso enables the government to identify and finance additional subprojects while undertaking \nneeded policy reforms associated with sector development plan implementation.24 \n19.  The summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB will finance expenditures in relation to \nworks, equipment, consulting services, incremental operating costs, and taxes and duties. The \nGAFSP will provide a grant cofinancing of $22 million on a cost-sharing basis, to be administered \nby ADB. The government will finance the equivalent of $1.43 million for salaries of counterpart \nstaff  and  office  space.  The  beneficiaries  will  finance  the  equivalent  of  $0.99  million  as  a \ncontribution to installation of tube wells. In support of the project, GAFSP will provide parallel \ncollaborative  cofinancing  of  $5  million  on  a  grant  basis,  to  be  administered  by  Food  and \nAgricultural Organization of the United Nations. 25 Climate adaptation is estimated to cost $10.65 \nmillion. ADB will finance 68% of adaptation costs, and GAFSP will finance the remainder. \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \nAmount    Share of Total  \nSource   ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank      \nOrdinary capital resources (loan)  40.50  62.4 \nGlobal Agriculture and Food Security Program (grant)a  22.00  33.9 \nBeneficiariesb  0.99  1.5 \nGovernment   1.43  2.2 \nTotal  64.92  100.0 \na Administered by the Asian Development Bank. \nb A transparent and equitable copayment mechanism will be developed during project implementation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n  \nE.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n21.  Project  preparation  considered  (i) the  economic  viability  of  technical  options  and \ncompatibility with local conditions, (ii) ways to diversify crops and increase productivity, (iii) ways \nto strengthen value chain linkages, and (iv) measures to minimize adverse impacts. The project \ndesign includes measures to enhance resilience, including changes in infrastructure siting (e.g., \nsediment traps to avoid excessive sedimentation, increasing the width and depth of irrigation \ncanals  for  added  storage,  increasing  embankment  heights  of  farm  roads,  providing  cross \ndrainage, and reducing soil erosion through measures such as restoration of the vegetation in the \nimmediate landscape). The project team conducted technical due diligence for three subprojects: \n(i) Chepa seed farm, (ii) minor canal rehabilitation, and (iii) shallow tubewell-based supplementary \nirrigation. All representative subprojects were evaluated against a set of eligibility criteria, which \nare detailed in the PAM. The project uses a participatory development approach, wherein the \nvalue chain stakeholders will be engaged in the design and implementation of subprojects.  \nB.  Economic and Financial \n22.  The economic and financial analysis indicates the representative subprojects are viable, \nwith the following economic internal rates of return: Chepa seed farm, 16.0%; minor canal \nrehabilitation, 14.2%; and tubewell irrigation, 15.3%. The benefits measured by the improved \ninfrastructure are a function of the increased productivity and production of certified seeds, and \nthe increased productivity and cropping intensity. The sensitivity analysis indicated that subproject \nbenefits remain robust (and the subproject economic internal rates of return well above 9%) when \nsubjected to varying adverse scenarios: (i) a 10% increase in capital, (ii) a 10% increase in \noperating expenses, (iii) a 10% reduction in yield, (iv) a 10% reduction in output price, and (v) a \n10% reduction in benefit. The cash flow analysis indicates that the subprojects generate sufficient \ncash flow for O&M, affirming financial sustainability. The project will provide O&M technical \n \n ", "8 \n \nassistance for all stakeholders, including training programs for lead seed growers and farmers, \nand government extension agents. The government will assume primary responsibility for O&M \nof irrigation schemes and rural roads, with an estimated annual O&M requirement of $0.57 million \n(MOALI\u2019s average annual O&M budget is $23.31 million, and this amount is unlikely to constitute \nan excessive fiscal burden). Subprojects will be selected by the readiness and commitment of \nbeneficiaries to assume O&M responsibility, and all subprojects will develop viable O&M plans. \nC.  Governance  \n23.  The pre-mitigation financial management risk for the project is substantial given the low \ncapacity for accounting, budgeting, financial reporting and monitoring, and information system \nuse;  and  low  quality  of  internal  and  external  audit  reports.  MOALI  will  ensure  the  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) develops project-specific accounting systems and maintains financial \nrecords. Consolidated project financial statements prepared by MOALI will be audited annually \nby independent auditors acceptable to ADB. All procurement will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The overall procurement risk is high \ndue to limited experience in procuring civil works and services under ADB projects. International \nand national procurement specialists will assist the PMU and train MOALI staff on procurement. \nThe project will establish a website to disclose implementation progress, bid notifications and their \nresults, and a grievance mechanism. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended from time \nto time) was explained to and discussed with the government and MOALI. Specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM.      \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n24.  The project is classified general intervention. It will benefit at least 35,000 poor households \n(totaling 156,000 persons, of whom 80,000 are women) by increasing their net incomes by at \nleast 20%.26 It will promote inclusive economic growth and provide job opportunities and services. \nPoor households will be enabled to increase productivity through enhanced access to improved \nseeds,  water,  and  mechanization  services  through  the  agricultural  digital  finance  service. \nVulnerable households in townships will participate in civil works and post-harvest operations.   \n25.  Gender. The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. The project team \nprepared a gender action plan to promote women\u2019s views and their active participation in project \nactivities. Gender measures include (i) consultations with women farmers to identify their priorities \nand needs, (ii) improved access to financial and farm extension services, and (iii) gender \nsensitization for stakeholders. Gender targets include (i) at least 40% of paid work in infrastructure \nconstruction and rehabilitation is for women; (ii) at least 30% of O&M jobs are for women; and \n(iii) 40% farmers trained in CSA, GAPs, and agribusiness skills are women. Other actions include \na detailed gender analysis of the value chains to inform the development of gender-responsive \nagribusiness policies, and awareness raising of women on land registration processes and land \nuse rights. Overall, the access of women farmers to agricultural inputs and capacity will be \nincreased, leading to improved livelihoods, food and nutrition security, and climate resilience. The \nPMU will be responsible for gender action plan implementation, monitoring and reporting. \nE.  Safeguards \n26.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.27 \n                                                \n26  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories ", "9 \n \n27.  Environment (category B). The project is expected to achieve significant environmental \nbenefits, including improved resilience and increased crop diversity. The project team conducted \nenvironmental  due  diligence  for  three  representative  subprojects.  An  initial  environmental \nexamination, including an environmental management plan, was prepared for a representative \nsubproject (minor canal rehabilitation in Pakokku) assessed as category B. These documents will \nserve as a guide for preparing the environmental management and monitoring plans for similar \nsubprojects.28 The other two subprojects have been classified as category C based on ADB\u2019s \nrapid environmental assessment checklist, and environmental codes of conduct have been \nprepared. An environmental assessment and review framework has been developed to guide the \nenvironmental screening and categorization of subprojects and to identify potential impacts. It \nincludes an environmental code of conduct for contractors and sets out the grievance redress \nmechanism  for  resolving  complaints  about  environmental  performance  as  well  as  public \nconsultation requirements. The framework was disclosed on the ADB website in March 2018 after \ngovernment's concurrence. Subprojects classified as category A will not be financed. Subprojects \nwill  be  screened  for  climate  risks  and  incorporate  risk  reduction  measures.  Semi-annual \nenvironmental safeguards monitoring reports will be submitted by the executing agency to ADB \nfor disclosure on ADB and project websites.  \n28.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). Subproject screening and selection criteria will \nidentify and reject any category A subprojects that involve significant involuntary resettlement, \neconomic  displacement  or  involuntary  land  acquisition.  Due  diligence  conducted  for  three \nrepresentative subprojects showed that one of the subprojects requires acquisition of four square \nmeters of land. None would result in any physical or economic displacement. Therefore, land \nacquisition and resettlement plans were not prepared for the representative subprojects. During \nproject preparation, some irrigation subprojects were identified that would require acquisition of \nsmall strips of land to accommodate improvement of tertiary canals. These small strips of land \nmay be acquired through (i) voluntary donation, (ii) negotiated settlement, or (iii) involuntary land \nacquisition and resettlement. A rigorous due diligence procedure to verify that voluntary donations \nare legitimate has been included in the resettlement framework that will be used to further screen \nand select subprojects during implementation.29 Due diligence reports for subprojects will be \nupdated, and due diligence will be conducted for all subprojects identified after the Board \napproval. If negotiated settlement is applied: (i) an external third party will be recruited to validate \nand document the process; (ii) the report with supporting documents will be submitted to ADB for \nconcurrence and no objection before any civil works commence; and (iii) if the owner of the site \nrefuses to sell, another site will be selected, and the same procedure followed. If negotiation fails \nand  expropriation  is  used,  a  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  shall  be  prepared  in \naccordance  with  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  and  sent  to  ADB  for \nconcurrence and disclosure prior to issuance of the bidding documents. The land acquisition and \nresettlement  framework  shall  be  used  to  conduct  a  social  safeguards  assessments  of  all \nsubprojects,  and  to  prepare  and  implement  resettlement  plans  where  needed  to  ensure \ncompliance with the Myanmar laws and regulations and ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement.  \n29.  Indigenous peoples (category B). There were no indigenous peoples or ethnic groups \nin the representative subprojects areas, hence no indigenous peoples plan was prepared. The \nfew ethnic households residing in the areas are assimilated into the mainstream Bamar society, \nuse the Myanmar official language, and pursue the same livelihoods as their Bamar neighbors. \nThe government prepared an ethnic group development framework to guide (i) identification of \ncircumstances that trigger indigenous peoples\u2019 safeguard requirements; and (ii) implementation \n                                                \n28 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents). \n \n ", "10 \n \nof future subprojects to ensure inclusiveness, consultation with, and participation of ethnic groups.  \n30.  Within 6 months of the date of project effectiveness and prior to commencement of civil \nworks,  the  project  will  establish  a  safeguards  grievance  redress  mechanism.  Building  on \nexperience with past ADB projects, the government is committed to and has the capacity to \nmanage social and environmental risks, including various safeguard frameworks and plans. \nAdequate resources were allocated to the screening, preparation, implementation, monitoring, \nand reporting of social and environmental safeguards, and associated capacity development. \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n31.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.30  \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nFailure of the government to  Project will assist MOALI to establish an agribusiness policy cell to promote \nsustain policy reforms for  public\u2013private partnerships, identify how to access external markets, and \nagribusiness promotion  strengthen capacity to meet importing country safety and quality requirements.  \nWeak financial management  Project will train PMU and TPIU staff on ADB accounting, auditing, and \nregulatory systems and skills  disbursement procedures.
