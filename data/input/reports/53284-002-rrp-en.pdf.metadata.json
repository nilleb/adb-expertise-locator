It  will  also contribute to  reducing the transmission  of the \ncoronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  and  other  hygiene-related  and  waterborne  diseases  through \nincreased access to safe water and an improved sanitation service. A project readiness financing \ngrant  was  approved  in  2019  to  prepare the  project  and  facilitate  a  smooth  transition  to  project \nimplementation.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nDevelopment context. The latest official population estimate for the FSM is 103,000, of \n3. \nwhom 49,000 people live in Chuuk.2 The Asian Development Bank (ADB) classified the FSM a \nfragile and conflict-affected situation in 2019. Since the country gained independence from the \nUnited States  (US)  administered  Trust  Territory  of  the  Pacific  Islands  in  1986,  the  FSM  has \noperated under a Compact of Free Association with the US. Under the Compact, the FSM citizens \nhave the right to reside and work in the US without visas. This has resulted in the depletion of \nskilled labor and a declining population, as people move to the US. The 2010 US census reported \nthat 8,185 people identified their country of origin as the FSM, half of whom identified their origin \nas  Chuuk.3  ADB  estimated  the  FSM\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  at  $3,427  per  person  in \nFY2019,  with  GDP  growth  from  FY2015\u2013FY2019  averaging  1.9%  per  annum.  The  primary \nsources of income in the FSM are the sale of fishing rights (about $73.3 million in 2019) and taxes. \nSubsistence economic activities account for about 15% of the FSM\u2019s GDP. In urban centers, the \neconomy  is  centered  on  government  employment  and  a  small  commercial  segment.  ADB \nestimates  the  FSM\u2019s  economy  to  have  contracted  by  5.4%  in  FY2020  and  forecasts  a  further \ncontraction  of  1.8%  in  FY2021  because  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  The  2013\u20132014  FSM \nHousehold Expenditure and Income Survey noted that poverty levels in Chuuk were the highest \nin the FSM, with 45.5% of the population falling below the total poverty line of $1,217 per adult \nper year annually and 16.2% of adults receiving less than the food poverty line of $1.72 per day.4 \n \n4. \nVulnerability to natural hazards and climate change. The FSM is highly vulnerable to \nnatural hazards, particularly tropical storms and droughts, and is susceptible to climate change \nimpacts.  In  2002,  Tropical  Storm  Chata\u2019an  caused  severe  flooding  and  landslides  that  killed \n47 people on Weno Island. In 2015, Typhoon Maysak struck the states of Chuuk and Yap, causing \nfour  deaths  and  damaging  houses,  crops,  and  public  infrastructure  (estimated  at  4%  of  the \n\n \n\n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2019. Project Readiness Financing Report: Preparing the Chuuk Water Supply and \nSanitation  Project  in  the  Federated  States  of  Micronesia.  Manila.  The  project  readiness  financing  grant  financed \nfeasibility studies and due diligence, and supported the establishment of the project management unit (PMU). The \ngrant will also finance the preparation of bidding documents. \n\n2  FSM Office of Statistics, Budget, Overseas Development Assistance and Compact Management. 2011.

The  2010  FSM  Census  (footnote  2)  also  noted  that  about  30%  of  Chuuk \n\nhouseholds had family members residing in Guam and Hawaii. \n\n4  Government of the FSM, Office of Statistics, Budget, Overseas Development Assistance and Compact Management. \n\n2014. Household Income and Expenditure Survey, 2013\u20132014. Palikir.  \n\n\fcountry\u2019s  GDP).5  Chuuk  State  experienced  three  major  droughts  from  2016  to  2020,  which \nresulted  in  Weno\u2019s  surface  water  sources  drying  up  and  stress  on  groundwater  resources. \nClimate change projections show that temperatures will continue to rise in the FSM, as will the \nsea level and ocean acidification.6 The intensity and frequency of days of extreme rainfall and \ndrought are also projected to rise, increasing the need for infrastructure that is resilient to climate \nchange and disasters. \n \n5. \nAccess to water supply and sanitation services. Weno is the largest urban center in \nthe  state,  with  a  population  of  about  14,000  residing  in  2,100 households  (footnote  2).  The \naverage annual population growth rate of Chuuk State is estimated at 0.1% and its population is \nprojected to increase to 50,000 by 2025, with most of the growth in Weno. Access to public water \nsupplies and sanitation services is limited. A household socioeconomic survey conducted for the \nproject in June 2020 reported the sources of household water as rainwater tanks (55%), wells \n(18%), the public water supply system (12%), streams (9%), and bottled water and other sources \n(6%). Rainwater harvesting is not secure because of seasonal rainfall patterns and more frequent \nand severe dry periods caused by climate change. The survey also reported that 23% of Weno \nhouseholds had an indoor flush toilet connected to the sewer system, 42% of Weno households \nhad an indoor flush toilet connected to a septic tank or cesspit, 20% used pit toilets, and 15% had \nno access to sanitation facilities and resorted to open defecation.  \n \nUtility  performance.  Chuuk  Public  Utility  Corporation  (CPUC)  is  mandated  under  the \n6. \nChuuk  Public  Utility  Corporation  Act,  1996  to  deliver  electricity,  water  supply,  and  sewerage \nservices; and to collect water, sewer, and electricity tariffs based on meter readings. The CPUC\u2019s \nperformance  has  improved  significantly  since  institutional  reforms  were  initiated  under  the \nADB-financed Omnibus Infrastructure Development Project in 2010.7 The CPUC fully recovered \nits  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  depreciation,  and  debt  servicing  costs  in  FY2019, \ngenerating a profit from utility service tariff collection for the first time in its history. The CPUC \ndoes not receive any subsidies from the Chuuk State or national governments. Most of its revenue \ncomes from electricity sales, while water and sewerage operation income totaled only 6% of gross \nCPUC  revenue  in  2019.  The  CPUC  relies  on  internal  cross-subsidies  from  electricity  sales  to \ncover the water supply and sewerage O&M costs.8 It plans to make water supply and sewerage \noperations  financially  more  independent  from  the  cross-subsidies.  The  CPUC  has  prepared  a \nnew  water  and  sewage  tariff  framework  to  increase  revenue  collection  which  will  be  fully \nimplemented by 31 December 2023. The laws and associated regulations under which the CPUC \noperates are also outdated and require amendment to reflect utility governance best practices. \n \nThe  CPUC  water  supply  system  on  Weno  serves  378  residential  customers  (about \n7. \n2,300 people) and 101 commercial and government customers. The CPUC produces 2,500 cubic \nmeters of water per day (m3/day), of which 95% is groundwater extracted from 14 deep wells. The \nbalance is surface water taken from Pou River and treated at the Pou water treatment plant. The \nCPUC plans to increase its water supply service coverage by expanding its service from more \nsurface water resources, which will reduce the reliance on groundwater and rainwater harvesting, \nand lower pumping costs. Since the Pou River has reached its sustainable yield, the CPUC has \nidentified the Wichen River as a new source with sufficient surface water for future water supply \nexpansion. \n\n \n\n5  International  Monetary  Fund.  2017.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans and a Technical \nAssistance Grant to the Federated States of Micronesia for the Omnibus Infrastructure Development Project. Manila. \n\n8  In 2019, the CPUC recovered 66% of its combined water supply and sewerage O&M costs from revenue. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nNonrevenue water (NRW) is high in Weno. In 2019, water sales averaged 1,020 m3/day \n8. \nout  of  2,500  m3/day  production;  the  balance  (60%)  was  NRW,  partially  because  of  illegal \nconnections. The CPUC conducted a survey of water connections in Weno in March 2019 and \nfound that the unrecorded (or illegal) connections outnumbered legal connections. The CPUC is \nimplementing a program to reduce NRW and increase revenue by (i) optimizing its water supply \noperations and recording all connections, and (ii) strengthening its water leak detection capacity \nto minimize physical water losses. \n \nWeno\u2019s sewerage network has 384 recorded connections of residential households and \n9. \n106  commercial  and  government  customers.  Collected  sewage  is  treated  at  the  tertiary  Weno \nwastewater  treatment  plant,  which  has  a  capacity  of  2,700  m3/day,  and  then  discharged  into \nChuuk Lagoon through an ocean outfall. Some sewage pumping stations are in poor condition, \nbecause  of  limited  preventative maintenance,  and  require  rehabilitation. The  CPUC  has  made \ncontinuous improvements to Weno\u2019s sewer system since 2011. However, further investment is \nrequired  to  (i)  expand  the  sewer  system  and  connections,  (ii)  reduce  the  stormwater  and \ngroundwater  infiltration  to  optimize  the  sewer  system  operation,  and  (iii)  upgrade  the  pump \nstations.  Beyond  the  sewer  system  service  area,  septic  tanks  and  pit  toilets  are  widely  used, \nparticularly among poor communities. These discharge sewage randomly into shallow aquifers \nand  contaminate  Weno\u2019s  groundwater  sources.  Consequently,  diarrhea,  particularly  among \ninfants, is endemic for households using shallow wells for drinking water. An average of 847 cases \nof diarrhea were reported annually in Weno from 2014 to 2018. 9 \n \n10. \nThe CPUC plans to support community-wide hygiene awareness and education activities \nto  foster  improved  hygiene  behavior\u2014to  prevent  contact  transmissible  diseases  such  as                \nCOVID-19.  The  hygiene  awareness  and  education  activities  will  be  delivered  under  ADB\u2019s \nregional  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Strengthening  Water,  Sanitation,  and  Hygiene  Practices \nand  Hygiene  Behavioral  Change  in  the  Pacific.10  The  TA  will  enhance  the  project\u2019s  outcome. \nAccess  to  sanitation  facilities  will  ease  constraints  on  women  related  to  access  to  sanitation, \nhealth,  and  hygiene;  and  will  reduce  medical  costs  related  to  waterborne  and  other  infectious \ndiseases. \n \n11. \nAlignment with Strategy 2030. The project will contribute to goal 6 of the Sustainable \nDevelopment  Goals  to  ensure  access  to  water  and  sanitation  for  all.  It  aligns  with  ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030 operational priorities: (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities; \n(ii) accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality;  (iii)  tackling  climate  change,  building  climate  and \ndisaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; (iv) making cities more livable; \nand  (v)  strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity.11  The  project  is  included  in  the \ncountry  operations  business  plan  for  11  small  Pacific  island  countries,  2020\u20132022.12  It  is  also \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020 strategic priority to strengthen institutional \ncapacities, promote sound public sector management, and improve health and social protection \nservices.13 \n \n\n \n\n9  Chuuk Department of Health statistics indicate that Weno Hospital and Weno medical clinics report on average one \n\ncase of diarrhea annually for every 16 people living in Weno. \n\n10 ADB.  2020.

Output 1 will (i) install new \nwater supply connections to increase the number of households with legal access to the CPUC \nwater supply network to 1,000 households (48% of Weno households) or more; 17 (ii) construct 10 \nkilometers of new water mains to replace dilapidated water mains and expand the water supply \nnetworks to cover more households; (iii) develop a new surface water intake on the Wichen River, \nwith an associated 1,000 m3/day water treatment plant; (iv) recommission deep wells and develop \nnew deep wells in the Wichap\u2013Epinup area to supply the southern area of Weno; (v) improve the \nwater  supply  network  efficiency,  including  the  connection  of  deep  wells  to  centralized  water \nreservoirs and the construction of a booster station (at Sapuk); and (vi) reduce NRW to 30% or \nless by installing and replacing customer meters with prepaid water meters, installing real-time \nnetwork monitoring equipment, and repairing or replacing leaking water mains. \n \n14. \nOutput 2: Effective, efficient, and safe sanitation provided. Output 2 will (i) install new \nsewer connections, free of charge, to increase the number of households connected to the CPUC \nsewer system to at least 750 households (36% of Weno households, footnote 17); (ii) develop \nand  implement  a  wastewater  inflow  and  infiltration  management  program;  (iii)  construct  2.8 \nkilometers  of  sewage  pipes  to  expand  and  rehabilitate  the  pipe  system;  and  (iv)  rehabilitate  2 \nsewage  pumping  stations  and  11  sewage  grinder  stations.  Output  2  will  also  facilitate  regular \nsludge  removal  from  onsite  sanitation  facilities  by  (i) mandating  septic  tank  construction  and \noperations standards, (ii) developing a cost recovery framework for desludging of onsite sanitation \nfacilities, and (iii) facilitating private sector participation in desludging operations. The CPUC will \nstrengthen  its  septic  tank  desludging  operations  and  treat  the  septic  tank  sludge  at  the  Weno \nwastewater treatment plant. \n \n15. \nOutput  3:  Chuuk  Public  Utility  Corporation  made  financially  and  technically \nsustainable. Output 3 will assist the CPUC to strengthen its technical and financial sustainability \nthrough water supply and sewerage system operator training programs and asset management \ntraining programs. Output 3 will also assist the CPUC to fully implement its new tariff framework \nby 31 December 2023 to enable it to recover water supply and sewer O&M costs. \n \nC. \n \n16. \nADB\u2019s value added includes (i) bringing project readiness financing to accelerate project \nreadiness and enable the CPUC\u2019s institutional capacity, (ii) strengthening gender mainstreaming, \nand (iii) providing CPUC capacity building.

The  CPUC  will  be  the  implementing  agency.  A  project  management  unit  (PMU)  is \nestablished in the CPUC, with CPUC personnel, and is responsible for project implementation, \nincluding  all  procurement.  A  planning  and  procurement  risk  assessment  has  been  undertaken \nand has guided the procurement planning. The procurement of project components through open \ncompetitive bidding procedures will be done through e-procurement. A consulting firm has been \nrecruited  under  the  ongoing  project  readiness  financing  grant  (footnote  1)  to  prepare  bidding \ndocuments  for  works  and  goods.  Bidding  for  the  project\u2019s  major  contracts  is  expected  to \ncommence in August 2021. \n \nCOVID-19.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  led  to  the  closure  of  the  FSM  borders  since \n20. \nMarch 2020. It is uncertain when the FSM borders will reopen, but the reopening is envisaged to \nbe in stages. The government has prioritized the water and sanitation project to prevent the virus \nfrom spreading and help the economic recovery. The 7-year implementation period will provide \nsome  flexibility  for  delays.

Engineering designs are built on comprehensive studies, \nincluding  water  supply  and  sanitation  feasibility  studies.  Additional  water  demand  from  the \nexpansion of the CPUC\u2019s water customer base will be met by (i) reducing NRW; (ii) enhancing \nwater conservation management,  including  installing  prepaid  water meters;  and  (iii)  expanding \nthe  water  production  capacity.  The  existing  wastewater  treatment  plant  on  Weno  Island  has \nsufficient capacity to cater for additional connections. The infiltration management program will \nreduce the rainwater and groundwater infiltration into the sewer system, lower the hydraulic loads \nto the wastewater treatment, and save the pumping costs. \n \nB. \n \nEconomic  analyses  were  undertaken  for  the  water  and  sewerage  components  by \n22. \ncomparing  the  discounted  costs  and  benefits  under the  with-  and  without-project  scenarios for \nFY2021\u2013FY2052 in constant 2020 prices. Both components were found to be viable compared \nwith an economic opportunity cost of capital of 6.0%, deemed appropriate for fragile and conflict-\naffected situations including the FSM. The water supply component have an economic internal \nrate of return (EIRR) of 6.3% and an economic net present value (ENPV) of $0.31 million, while \nthe sewerage component have an EIRR of 6.2% and an ENPV of $0.07 million. The overall project \nhas an EIRR of 6.3% and an ENPV of $0.4 million.20 \n \n23. \nFinancial  analysis  was  also  undertaken  using  with-  and  without-project  scenarios  for \nFY2021\u2013FY2052,  with  no  residual  value  assumed  at  the  end  of  this  period.  Costs  included \nconsultancy  services  as  well  as  the  recurrent  replacement  costs  of  capital  equipment,  but \nexcluded price contingencies. The proposed investments are found to be financially viable against \na  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  estimated  at  1.1%.  The  water  supply  components  have  a \nfinancial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  of  2.0%  and  a  financial  net  present  value  (FNPV)  of \n$1.33 million,  while  the  sanitation  components  have  an  FIRR  of  1.2%  and  an  FNPV  of \n$0.04 million.  The  overall  project  has  an  FIRR  of  1.7%  and  an  FNPV  of  $1.4  million,  and  will \ndeliver a positive cash flow for the project\u2019s water supply and sewerage components beginning in \nFY2025.21 The sensitivity analysis indicates that the CPUC\u2019s future price path would be a major \nfactor in financial performance. Implementing planned tariff increases will help ensure viability. \n \nC. \n \n24. \nTo ensure the technical sustainability of the project, the infrastructure will be designed and \nbuilt using climate-proofed approaches and durable materials. Projected climate change impacts \nare considered, including longer and more severe droughts; sea level rise; and increased rainfall \nvariability,  both  seasonally  and  annually,  which  is  likely  to  cause  flash  floods  and  landslides. \nThe reduction of NRW will increase water availability for households, conserve water resources, \nand reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. The installation of prepaid water meters \nand  real-time  network  monitoring  equipment  will  also  lead  to  potential  water  conservation. \nThe upgrading of water sources will further balance the use of groundwater and surface water \nresources  in  the  CPUC\u2019s  portfolio  and  reduce  the  climate-related  risks.  In  parallel,  to  ensure \n\nSustainability \n\n20 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nsustainability from the customer or user perspective, ADB regional TA (footnote 10) will deliver a \nprogram to promote good hygiene practices, water conservation, and the importance of paying \ntariffs  in  the  communities.  Overall,  the  project\u2019s  financial  sustainability  will  be  ensured  through \n(i) improving  the  CPUC\u2019s  operational  efficiency  to  minimize  operating  costs,  (ii) expanding  the \nCPUC\u2019s customer base to increase revenues, and (iii) promoting a regulated water and sewage \ntariff and ensuring the service affordability. \n \nD. \n \n25. \nThe financial management capacity of the CPUC has improved substantially since 2009, \nand the external entity audits for FY2017 and FY2018 did not identify any material weaknesses \nor  deficiencies  in  the  internal  financial  controls.  A  financial  management  assessment  of  the \nCPUC, conducted in October 2019, concluded that (i) the utility\u2019s financial management practices \nare sound, (ii) staff levels are appropriate for an organization of its size, and (iii) processes and \nprocedures are well documented. Weaknesses found relate to (i) the CPUC\u2019s lack of experience \nin  directly  implementing  investment  projects  financed  by  multilateral  development  banks,  and \nthe  workload  during  the \n(ii) insufficient  capacity  to  absorb  the  significant  increase  in \nimplementation  of  the  investment  project.  To  address  these  weaknesses,  consultants  with \nexperience in ADB disbursement and procurement procedures will be engaged under the project. \nThe CPUC will also engage additional staff and consultants to address the increasing workload. \nThe financial management assessment concluded that the CPUC\u2019s financial management risk is \nmoderate and its procurement risk is moderate. \n \n26. \nThe  assessed  pre-mitigation  financial management risk  is  moderate  mainly  because  of \nthe absence of (i) negative news articles, (ii) CPUC executives who are sanctioned by the United \nNations or ADB, and (iii) CPUC executives who are sanctioned by the US Office of Foreign Assets \nControl. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  CPUC.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \nE. \n \nThe  project  will  indirectly  reduce  poverty  by  extending  potable  water  and  sanitation \n27. \nservices,  particularly  to  informal  settlements.  Poor  quality  drinking  water  has  increased  the \ndisease burden, with negative economic consequences that disproportionately affect women, the \npoor,  and  vulnerable  sections  of  society.  Households  without  proper  toilet  facilities  are  more \nexposed to the risk of waterborne diseases. This significantly affects productivity and family health \nexpenditures. Other social and poverty issues in the country include (i) unemployment, with 45% \nof  youth  unemployed; (ii)  lack  of  skills  and  expertise  resulting from  poor quality  education  and \ninadequate  training;  (iii)  poor  transport  infrastructure,  leading  to  isolation  and  poor  access  to \nmarkets;  and  (iv)  gender  inequality,  resulting  in  high  rates  of  violence  against  women. \nThe government\u2019s  National  Development  Strategy  addresses  many  of  these  issues;  and \ndevelopment partners are supporting health, education, and transport reforms.  \n \nGender equality. The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. The gender \n28. \naction  plan  for  the  project  has  clear  targets,  responsibilities,  and  resource  allocations.22 \nThe project will increase the number of households with access to continuous potable piped water \nthrough metered connections to about 1,000 , including 200 households headed by women.. This \nwill reduce the drudgery of women and girls\u2019 time poverty and free up time for other activities, \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n22 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nSafeguards \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nincluding attending school. The project will increase the number of households with legal access \nto  the  Weno  sewerage  system  to  750,  including  150  households  headed  by  women,  thereby \nproviding  gender-sensitive  sanitation  to  women  and  their  households.  Specific  gender  design \nfeatures  include  (i)  supporting  women\u2019s  employment;  (ii) hygiene  awareness  and  behavior \ncampaigns and training for households on willingness to pay for services, including  household \ndiscussions  on  women\u2019s  role  in  water  collection and preparation;  (iii)  providing  gender-specific \ntoilet facilities at markets, the domestic port, and state events; (iv) appointing women to decision-\nmaking positions and providing support for leadership training aimed at women; (v) adopting and \nimplementing  a  gender strategy  in  the  CPUC;  and  (vi) implementing  a  CPUC  gender-sensitive \nwater tariff framework and reviewing it annually. \n \nF. \n \n29. \ncategories are as follows:23 \n \nEnvironment  (category  B).  An  initial  environmental  examination  was  prepared for  the \n30. \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.24  The  project  provides  positive \nproject \nenvironmental benefits by ensuring an adequate supply of safe water and improved sanitation for \nthe  residents  of  Weno.  Adverse  environmental  impacts  of  the  project  will  be  site-specific  and \nlargely related to construction activities, which are expected to be minimal for land-based works \nand for which mitigation measures can be readily implemented. The environmental management \nplan  outlines  the  risks  and  mitigating  actions  to  be  undertaken  during  project  implementation. \nThe CPUC\u2019s environmental management capacity is limited, and an international specialist will \nbe  engaged  through  the  project  to  support  the  CPUC\u2019s  implementation  and  monitoring  of  the \nenvironmental  management  plan,  and  to  strengthen  the  CPUC\u2019s  environmental  management \ncapacity. \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B)  and  indigenous  peoples  (category  C). \n31. \nA resettlement plan was prepared for the project. The project affects about 23,300 square meters \n(m2)  and  requires  the  acquisition  of  about  7,500  m2  of  land  reservoirs  and  pump  stations. \nThe balance of the impacted land (about 15,800 m2) is within existing reserves and easements \nand  state-owned  land.  Non-land  impacts  are  associated  with  some  gardens  and  crops,  and \ntemporary impacts on nonresidential structures that could be reestablished once the works are \ncompleted. About 18 persons will be affected. This will be confirmed following the detailed design \nand during the update of the resettlement plan. CPUC has consulted with the affected persons \nand the consultations will continue during project implementation. The CPUC has disclosed the \ndraft safeguard documents. The CPUC will finance, implement, and monitor the resettlement plan. \nThe PMU, which includes a social safeguards specialist, will support the CPUC and the CPUC \nland management officer in implementing the resettlement plan, and provide safeguard capacity \nbuilding to CPUC staff. The project is not expected to have a negative impact on any distinct or \nvulnerable group of indigenous peoples as defined under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nG. \n \n32. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.25 \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\n23 ADB.
