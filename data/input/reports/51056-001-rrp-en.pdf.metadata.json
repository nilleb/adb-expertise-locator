Ltd. (MFL) for \nGreen Transport Finance in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).1 MFL will deploy at least one-\nthird of the A loan proceeds in the underdeveloped central and western regions of the PRC. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe PRC has experienced strong economic growth since 1980. Gross domestic product \n(GDP) growth averaged 9.7% and per capita income increased by 8.6% per year during 1980\u2013\n2014.2 Rapid economic growth has contributed significantly to improving human well-being and \nquality of life. But it has also created serious social and environmental challenges, which constrain \ninclusive and sustainable development. Income inequality is still a major challenge for the PRC. \nEnvironmental and climate issues also pose major challenges, with the cost of pollution damage \nin the PRC estimated at 6%\u20139% of GDP.3 Less than 1% of the 500 larger cities in the PRC meet \nthe World Health Organization\u2019s fine particle (PM2.5) standards for air quality (footnote 2). The \nenvironmental problems are partly caused by massive urbanization and a substantial increase in \nthe  production  and  use  of  motor  vehicles  in  the  country.  The  PRC  has  become  the  largest \nproducer and consumer of automobiles in the world. The extensive use of private cars in cities is \ncausing  congestion,  air  and  noise  pollution,  and  road  accidents.  In  metropolitan  areas,  the \ntransport sector is estimated to account for at least one-third of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, \nincluding carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. \n \nThe  government  has  been  promoting  green  transport  to  address  congestion  and  air \n3. \npollution by encouraging a modal shift from private to public transport, as well as the large-scale \ndeployment  of  green  vehicles.  These  actions  would  reduce  GHG  emissions  that  contribute  to \nglobal  climate  change.  Developing  public  transport  will  also  directly  benefit  the  poor,  who \nfrequently face problems accessing safe and affordable public transport. The government now \npays  special  attention  to  the  social  function  of  public  transport  and  heavily  regulates  and \nsubsidizes fares in most cities. In 2012, the State Council issued a policy guideline on prioritizing \nthe development of green public transport, with the target to have public transport passengers \naccount for at least 60% of total urban commuters.4 In April 2015, the PRC government issued \nthe subsidy policy for new-energy buses and other green vehicles for the period of 2016-2020.5 \n\n                                                 \n1  B loans are syndicated loans which are funded in US dollars by eligible offshore financial institutions. Complementary \nloans  are  Asian  Development  Bank  syndicated  loans  funded  in  local  currency  by  eligible  onshore  financial \ninstitutions. ADB is the lender of record of both B loans and complementary loans and each such loan may only be \nprovided if ADB provides cofinancing in the form of an A loan. \n\n2  ADB.  2016.

Toward an Environmentally Sustainable Future: Country Environmental Analysis of \n\nDevelopment Bank, 2016\u20132020. Manila. \n\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China. ADB: Manila. \n\n4  State Council of the PRC. 2012. Guidelines of Prioritizing Urban Public Transport Development in China. No. (2012). \n\n5  Government of the PRC. 2015. Notice on Fiscal Support Policy for Promoting New Energy Vehicles in 2016\u20132020. \n\nBeijing. \n\nBeijing. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nIn  2016,  the  Minister  of  Transport  issued  another  policy  guideline  to  promote  the  use  of  new-\nenergy buses in urban areas.6  \n \n4. \nHowever, high capital costs and financing constraints have limited the expansion of green \ntransport,  particularly for green  bus  transport,  as  local  bus  operators typically  have  high  debt\u2013\nasset ratios and would operate at a loss without government subsidies.7 They are also subject to \nsignificant refinancing risk because they rely on bank loans with terms of 1\u20133 years to finance bus \npurchases. Financial leasing can be an effective way to supplement bank financing and address \nthis funding bottleneck because it allows bus operators to tap additional financing that has longer \ntenors and better amortization profile.8 But despite rapid growth since 2009, the PRC\u2019s financial \nleasing industry needs further development. Lease market penetration, measured as the ratio of \nlease finance over fixed investments in plants and equipment, was only 3.4% in 2014, compared \nwith 22.0% in the US, 28.6% in the United Kingdom, and the high single-digit ratios in developed \nAsian countries. The percentage of lease finance to total GDP, was 1.29% in the PRC in 2014, \nranking 21st among 50 countries. The leasing industry, with total assets of CNY3.2 trillion, is also \nmuch smaller than the banking industry, where assets totaled CNY199.35 trillion at the end of \n2015. Bus leasing remains a niche operation undertaken by few financial leasing companies. \n \n5. \nADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  operations  have  been  actively  supporting  leasing  in  the  PRC, \nparticularly for clean buses. ADB approved a $275 million clean bus leasing program and fully \ndisbursed the loans in 2016.9 Based on the successful uptake of this program and to continue to \nsupport  much-needed  green  transport  alternatives  in  the  PRC,  ADB  identified  MFL  as  a  good \npartner to implement this project. It has substantial experience in financing green buses and has \nclose relationships with electric bus manufacturers and bus operators in the PRC. MFL has strong \nshareholders, sound corporate governance, an experienced management team, advanced risk \nmanagement systems, and good financial performance. A non-deposit-taking financial institution, \nMFL has maturity mismatches between its assets and liabilities and, therefore, needs longer-tenor \nfinancing to expand its green bus leasing business (with typical lease terms of 5\u201310 years). \n \nB. \n \n6. \nMFL was established in April 2008 as one of the first five bank-owned financial leasing \ncompanies  (FLCs)  approved  and  regulated  by  the  China  Banking  Regulatory  Commission \n(CBRC).  CONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION  DELETED.  MFL  benefits  from  the  leading  industry \nposition  of  its  parent  bank,  China  Minsheng  Banking  Corporation  (CMBC),  with  its  national \nnetwork of 129 branches and 1,119 subbranches, strong brand name, and credit expertise. CMBC \nis the largest private bank in the PRC with a nationwide presence, and total assets of CNY5,896 \nbillion  and  total  equity  of  CNY342.6  billion  as  of  31  December  2016.  CMBC  is  rated  BBB  by \nStandard  &  Poor\u2019s  and  has  been  listed  on  the  Shanghai  Stock  Exchange  since  2000  and  the \nHong Kong Stock Exchange since 2009. \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n                                                 \n6  The Minister of Transport of the PRC. 2016.

Beijing. \n\n7  Bus fares in the PRC are regulated and typically set at very low levels (e.g., a cash fare of CNY1 per trip, with up to \n\n50% discount if an integrated circuit card is used). \n\n8  Unlike the structure for short-term bank loans, which have bullet repayments, the repayment structure under a lease \n\ncontract is typically mortgage-style and, therefore, better suited to the cash flow of bus operators. \n\n9  ADB. 2013. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan Program to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for the Clean Bus Leasing Project. Manila. ADB has fully disbursed the loans, totaling \n$275 million, to Far East Horizon, Industrial Bank Financial Leasing, and Everbright Financial Leasing. Compared \nwith the 2013 program, the proposed project applies a higher emission standard and excludes clean diesel vehicles. \nADB also approved technical assistance in the amount of $2.315 million to maximize the service performance of the \nbus fleets and provide training, among other activities. \n\n\f3 \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \n \n7. \nWith  its  high-quality  customer  service,  sound  operation  and  management,  and  good \nbusiness performance, MFL has developed an influential brand and has won numerous awards \nfrom  industrial  associations  and  media.  MFL  plans  to  significantly  scale-up  its  vehicle  leasing \nbusiness, focusing on green vehicles. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED.  \n \nC. \n \n8. \nOwnership. MFL is a private financial institution. Its largest shareholder is CMBC with a \n51.03%  stake.  The  second-largest  shareholder  is  Beijing  Dayi  Xingye  Property  Development \n(14.72%), a local real estate developer in Beijing. The third-largest shareholder is Tianjin Wealth \nCompany  (11.78%),  an  investment  company fully  owned  by  Tianjin Wanshun  Real  Estate  Co. \nLtd., a large local real estate developer in Tianjin.10 ADB conducted integrity due diligence and \nidentified no significant or potentially significant integrity risks. \n \n9. \nManagement.  MFL  is  led  by  an  experienced  management  team,  most  with  prior \nexperience at CMBC, comprising a chief executive officer, four vice-presidents, a chief risk officer, \na  chief  operating  officer,  and  a  chief  marketing  officer.  CONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION \nDELETED.  \n \n10. \nGovernance structure. MFL has a good corporate governance structure. Key decisions, \nincluding on the company\u2019s overall strategy and other significant proposals and reports from the \nboard of directors and the board of supervisors, need to be approved at the general shareholders\u2019 \nmeeting. The board of directors, acting on behalf of all shareholders, comprises seven members, \nof whom three are independent directors. All board members have extensive finance, accounting, \nor management experience. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. Aside from the board \nof directors, MFL has a board of supervisors with four members who oversee the performance of \nthe directors and senior management. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \n11. \nADB will provide (i) an A loan of up to $200 million (or its yuan equivalent) and (ii) either a \nB loan in US dollars or a complementary loan in yuan, in each case of up to $200 million or its \nyuan equivalent. The A loan would be a senior loan with a tenor of up to 8 years. MFL will deploy \nat least one-third of the proceeds of the A Loan in the PRC\u2019s underdeveloped central and western \nregions.11 The A loan will be deployed for the narrower purposes as described in paragraph 17. \nThe proposed project will be supported by separate technical assistance (TA) to strengthen the \ncapacity of bus operators by providing information resources and training. The TA is financed by \nthe Global Environment Facility and is being implemented with the PRC\u2019s Ministry of Transport \n\n                                                 \n10 Ownership, Management, and Governance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 As  defined  in  the  Catalogue  of  Priority  Industries  for  Foreign  Investment  in  the  Central  and  Western  Regions, \npromulgated  by  the  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission  and  Ministry  of  Commerce  (MOFCOM)  and \nupdated from time to time. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nas the executing agency.12 The TA maximizes the service performance of the bus fleets by guiding \nbus operators on the proper selection of bus types, and the optimization of fleet operations. The \nTA also provides training on eco-conscious driving, advice on maintenance, and assistance with \nmanagement reporting and information technology systems. \n \nB. \n \n12. \nUse  of  proceeds.  MFL  will  use  the  proceeds  of  the  A  loan  to  finance  the  leasing  or \npurchasing  of  green  buses,  including  electric  bus  batteries.  The  green  buses  eligible  for  ADB \nfinancing will need to meet Euro V-equivalent emission standards and fall within at least one of \nthese categories: (i) \u201cenergy-efficient and new-energy buses\u201d as defined by the Government of \nthe  PRC,  which  currently  includes  hybrid  buses,  battery-only  electric  buses,  fuel-cell  electric \nbuses, and ultracapacitor buses; and (ii) buses running on cleaner fuel such as compressed or \nliquefied natural gas, or biomethane. MFL will use the proceeds of the B loan or complementary \nloan to finance (i) green vehicles, which include green buses as well as other commercial vehicles \nand passenger cars that meet the same emission standards and fall within the same categories \nof the green buses; and (ii) batteries and charging stations for electric vehicles.  \n \n13.  Monitoring. ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department will monitor the project. MFL \nwill provide financial and other reports to ADB at predetermined regular intervals and on request. \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED.  \n \n14. \nEvaluation. Monitoring reports will be prepared and submitted to ADB regularly, at least \non  an  annual  basis,  with  the  first  report  submitted  no  later  than  12  months  after  the  first \ndisbursement. \n \nC. \n \n15. \n\nADB\u2019s loan to MFL will add value by helping to achieve the following: \n(i) \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nPromote  green  public  transport.  There  is  a  pressing  need  to  support  green \ntransport solutions in the PRC, which will reduce GHG emissions that contribute \nto global  climate change  and  directly  benefit  low-income  commuters.  Long-term \nlease finance will enable bus operators to better match their payment obligations \nwith  operating cash flows  and  thereby  reduce refinancing risk. This,  in turn,  will \nimprove the financial health of bus operators, making them more attractive clients \nfor leasing companies, which would then encourage the development of a longer-\nterm leasing market and longer-term funding modalities for leasing companies in \nthe PRC. Additionally, bus operators financed by MFL will be supported by ADB \nTA to enhance their capacity in the selection, fleet operation, management, and \nmaintenance of green buses. \nSupport  the  leasing  sector  through  long-term  funding.  The  PRC\u2019s  leasing \nsector  is  still  in  the  early  stages  of  development.  Most  funding  is  available  to \ncompanies on a 1-year tenor basis. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \nLong-tenor funding from ADB, the first development financial institution lender to \nMFL,  will  help  support  the  company\u2019s  longer-tenor  green  bus  financing  and \nimprove its asset liability profile. This, in turn, will increase the company\u2019s capacity \nto expand its operations and address its funding gap. \n\n(ii) \n\n                                                 \n12 ADB.  2014.

By  combining \ncommercial  lease  financing  with  government  subsidies  to  bus  operators, 13 the \nproposed project promotes public\u2013private cofinancing modality that will support the \nPRC in achieving its ambitious targets for sustainable transport. \nCatalyze  private  sector  funding.  ADB  is  expected  to  mobilize  a  substantial \namount of funding for this project under a B loan or complementary loan structure. \nThis  will  help  further  diversify  MFL\u2019s  long-term  funding  base  and  enhance  its \ncapacity to scale-up its green transport and vehicle leasing business. \n \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nImpacts. The proposed project is expected to have strong development impacts, including \n\nGreen transport scaled up in the PRC, including the expansion of green bus \nservices  as  an  environment-friendly  and  inclusive  transport  mode.  By \nfinancing the lease of green buses, the project will support the expansion of a low-\ncost,  flexible  mode  of  public  transport.  The  expansion  of  green  bus  services  is \nexpected to benefit low-income commuters, improve air quality, and reduce GHG \nemissions.14 \nFinancial leasing industry developed. The project will help a major FLC diversify \nits funding sources and improve its asset liability profile, thus supporting finance \nsector development. Despite rapid growth since 2009, the PRC\u2019s financial leasing \nindustry is still underdeveloped, with a leasing penetration rate that is below other \ndeveloped  markets.  Access  to  finance  remains  a  challenge  for  most  leasing \ncompanies,  particularly  for  longer-tenor  loans,  and  the  proposed  project  will \ncontribute to the alleviation of this funding bottleneck. \n\nOutput. The project output will be the facilitation of up to $400 million of leasing finance \n\n \n17. \nOutcome. The project outcome will be an increase in the deployment of green buses and \nvehicles  in  the  urban,  suburban,  and  intercity  public  transport  markets.  CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION DELETED.  \n \n18. \nfor green transport operations in the PRC. \n \nB. \n \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  project  supports  three \n19. \nstrategic priorities identified by the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: (i) environment and climate \nchange, (ii) middle-income countries, and (iii) private sector development and operations.15 The \nMidterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  calls  for  increasing  assistance  for  sustainable  transport  and \nreiterates the target of investing $30 billion in transport from 2012 to 2021. The project fully aligns \nwith  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2016\u20132020  for  the  PRC,  which  states  that  ADB  will \n                                                 \n13 Currently, the central government provides subsidies of up to CNY300,000 for each full-length electric bus and up to \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\nCNY150,000 for each full-length hybrid bus. The local government may provide additional subsidies. \n\n14 The  environmental  impact  will  be  achieved  through  a  modal  shift  from  private  to  public  transport,  as  well  as  the \n\nadoption of clean fuel, and energy-efficient and low-emission vehicles. \n\n15 ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila. \n\n \n\n\fsupport transport modes with lower emissions and energy consumption; and promote integrated, \ngreen, inclusive, and competitive urban development (footnote 2). The proposed project supports \nthe country partnership strategy priorities of managing climate change and the environment and \nsupporting inclusive economic growth. It will also support finance sector development, a private \nsector operational focus identified in the country partnership strategy. \n \n20. \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  fully \nsupports ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative, which focuses on creating transport systems that \nare  accessible,  safe,  affordable,  and  environment-friendly. The  Sustainable  Transport Initiative \nOperational  Plan  states  that  ADB  should  help  developing  member  countries  overcome  sector \nobstacles through the wider adoption of sustainable transport, and identifies urban transport as \nan  area  in  which  ADB  should  scale-up  support  for  sustainability. 16  The  operational  plan \nemphasizes private sector participation and mobilization of additional finance. The project also \nfully  aligns  with  the  multilateral  development  banks\u2019  Rio+20  (United  Nations  Conference  on \nSustainable  Development)  commitment  to  provide  $175  billion  for  transport  in  developing \ncountries  during  2012\u20132022.  Supporting  finance  sector  development  is  a  key  focus  of \ndevelopment assistance for ADB, and the proposed project aligns with ADB\u2019s Financial Sector \nOperational Plan.17 The proposed project builds on previous ADB support for green transport and \nthe leasing industry in the PRC. \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  project  is  classified  as  category  FI  (treated  as  C)  for  impacts  on  the  environment, \n21. \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  MFL\u2019s  operations  under  the  ADB  loan  have \nminimal or no adverse environmental impacts, and are unlikely to entail impacts on involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous peoples. The project will fund the leasing of vehicles that will run on \ncleaner  fuels,  be  energy  efficient,  or  use  new  energy  sources.  Compliance  with  emission \nstandards covering motor vehicle engines is mandatory in the PRC, and the project is expected \nto have minimal environmental or social impacts. Green vehicles leased under the project will be \nrequired to meet the PRC\u2019s permit, testing, and registration requirements; and follow national and \nlocal vehicle emission standards and regulations. Battery charging stations will only be installed \nin locations that do not have refueling stations to avoid safety hazards associated with flammable \nfuels. The project may also fund batteries for electric vehicles manufactured in existing factories \nand the installation of charging stations for electric vehicles if no involuntary land acquisition is \nrequired. No physical or economic displacements or impacts on indigenous peoples are expected \nfrom this project. MFL will apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list, exclude all projects \nthat will have adverse environment and social safeguards impacts, ensure that investments using \nADB funds abide by applicable national laws and regulations, and comply with the ADB Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009). MFL will confirm this in its periodic report to ADB.18 \n \n22.  MFL  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection \nStrategy,  take  measures  to  comply  with  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standards.19 The \nproject  is  expected  to  benefit  all  commuters,  including  women,  and  is  classified  no  gender \nelements.  MFL  will  report  regularly  to  ADB  on  (i)  its  compliance  with  such  laws,  and  (ii)  the \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2010.
