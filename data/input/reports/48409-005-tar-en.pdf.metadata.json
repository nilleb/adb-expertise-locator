The  Project  increases  climate  resilience  for  critical  rural  infrastructure,  promotes \nquality  and  safety  testing  capacity,  strengthens  technical  and  institutional  capacity  for  climate-\nsmart  agriculture  (CSA),  and  creates  an  enabling  policy  environment  for  climate-friendly \nagribusinesses.  The  Project,  which  is  executed  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Livestock,  and \nIrrigation (MOALI), has the following Outputs: \n \n\ni)  Output  1:  Critical  agribusiness  value  chain  infrastructure  improved  and  made \nclimate-resilient. Key activities include (i) upgrading infrastructure (irrigation, farm roads, \nbuildings,  farm  machinery,  post-harvest  equipment,  seed  testing  equipment,  and \nagrometeorological  stations)  in  10  Department  of  Agriculture  (DOA)  seed  farms  for \nproducing  improved  climate-resilient  seed  of  rice,  beans,  pulses,  and  oilseeds;  (ii) \nrehabilitating  tertiary  canals  and  community  reservoirs,  and  constructing  shallow  tube \nwells  (with some  linked to drip  and  sprinkler  technologies)  to bring  an  13,000 hectares \nunder  irrigation  for  up  to  35,000 households; (iii)  rehabilitating farm  roads  for  improved \nconnectivity  to  markets  and  farm  mechanization;  and  (iv)  upgrading  safety  and  quality \ntesting equipment in public regulatory laboratories and providing rapid food safety testing \nkits to DOA and the private sector. \n\nii)  Output  2:  Climate-smart  agriculture  and  agribusiness  promoted.  Key  activities \ninclude  (i)  deploying  climate-resilient  varieties  of  rice,  beans,  pulses,  and  oilseeds;  (ii) \nstrengthening  capacity  of  seed  growers,  agri-dealers,  and  government  staff  regarding \nfarm \ngood  agriculture  practices \nmechanization,  and  of  agribusinesses  regarding  business  plan  development,  good \nmanufacturing practices, value addition, and improvement of food quality and safety; and \n(iii)  facilitating  access  to  inputs  (seeds,  quality  agrochemicals),  farm  mechanization \nservices, and off-farm rural livelihood opportunities by establishing an agricultural digital \nfinance service for at least 35,000 smallholders. \n\n(GAP),  CSA,  certified  seed  production,  and \n\niii)  Output  3:  Enabling  environment  for  climate-friendly  agribusiness  enhanced.  Key \nactivities include (i) establishing an agribusiness policy cell within MOALI\u2019s Department of \nPlanning for research and policy advice; (ii) raising awareness and capacity of financial \ninstitutions to support climate-friendly agribusinesses; (iii) enhancing weather, market, and \ncredit information networks; and (iv) improving delivery of land administration services in \ntownships by building capacity in participatory land management. \n\n \n2. \nThe $64.92 million CFAVC Project is supported by $40.50 million of concessional ordinary \ncapital resources lending from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), a $22.00 million grant from \nthe Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP), $1.43 million from the government, \nand  $0.99  million  from  project  beneficiaries.  The  Project  is  complemented  by  $5.00  million  of \nGAFSP funded technical assistance administered by the Food and Agriculture Organization of \nthe United Nations for extension of farm technologies/practices, promotion of nutrition behavioral \nchange; and capacity building for monitoring and process evaluation. The Project was approved \nby the ADB Board of Directors on 9 October 2018, and loan and grant agreements were signed \non 6 November 2018. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nII. \n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nJustification \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nAlthough Myanmar is heavily dependent on agriculture, there is little empirical evidence \navailable  on  the  effectiveness  of  agricultural  interventions  in  the  country.    Official  agricultural \nstatistics,  even  on  primary  agricultural  products, such  as rice,  differ  strongly  from  independent \nexternal estimates, and microdata on agriculture are limited1.  The studies available on agricultural \nproduction  patterns  and  practices  generally  focus  on  favorable  environments,  such  as  the \nAyerwaddy  delta,  so  that  knowledge  gaps  are  particularly  pronounced  on  less  favorable \nenvironments,  such  as the  CDZ.    In  2017,  the  first  modern  household  agricultural  survey  was \nconducted in the CDZ, but it also has important limitations for use in causal analysis2. This creates \nconsiderable uncertainty about the most appropriate agricultural interventions to promote. \n \n4. \nMore  broadly,  Myanmar  has  limited  exposure  to  modern  tools  for  evidence-based \npolicymaking, such as impact evaluation studies and randomized controlled trials3.  To date, no \nrandomized  controlled  trial  has  been  published  for  interventions  in  the  country  outside  of  the \nhealth  sector4.  This  means  that  introduction  of  modern  \u201cgold  standard\u201d  evaluation  tools  has \nconsiderable potential to help reform how policies are conceived and evaluated.  \n \nThe proposed technical assistance 5(TA) will embed a rigorous randomized controlled trial \n5. \napproach to impact evaluation within the CFAVC Project, so as to establish an empirical basis for \nlearning and Project improvement over time.  More specifically, it will involve identifying up to four \nkey priority interventions for testing within the CFAVC Project.  Those interventions will be those \nfor which the CFAVC Project Management Unit and other key stakeholders have greatest need \nfor information about effects and assumptions and for which established understanding is most \nlimited.    The  TA  will  define  a  pipeline  randomization 6 approach  to  the  sequencing  of  those \ninterventions, so as to allow rigorous quantification of their effects.  To provide data for analysis, \nsurveys of at least 5,000 households in at least 240 villages will be conducted at baseline, midline \nand  CFAVC  Project  completion,  complemented  by  village  surveys.    In  addition  to  providing \nevidence on the effects of interventions on outcomes of interest, the collected data will be utilized \nto  diagnose  target  agricultural  systems  and  constraints,  so  as  to  better  inform  CFAVC  Project \nimplementation.  Impact  evaluation  is  a  specialized  field  of  applied  research,  and  the  CFAVC \nProject  Executing  Agency  (MOALI)  has  little  experience  in  this  area.    For  this  reason, \n\n \n\n1 Raitzer, D, L.C.Y. Wong, and J. Samson. 2015.  Myanmar's Agriculture Sector: Unlocking the Potential for Inclusive \n\nGrowth. Asian Development Bank Economics Working Paper Series No. 470.  \n\n2 In 2017, the Rural Economy and Agriculture in the Dry Zone (READZ) survey of 958 crop producing households was \nundertaken in 4 townships under U.S. Agency for International Development and Livelihood Improvement and Food \nSecurity Trust Fund support.  The survey offers important descriptive information about production situations, but as \na single cross-section in a relatively concentrated area, in which sampling was not designed with respect to variation \nin exposure to any specific intervention, does not offer much potential for causal analysis. \n\n3 Randomized controlled trials, when implemented correctly, allow for unbiased estimation of intervention effects.  They \ninvolve  introducing  randomized  variation  in  the  sequencing  or  placement  of  interventions,  so  that  effects  can  be \nestimated in a similar manner to experiments in the natural sciences.  They are increasingly used in both the private \nand public sector to understand and compare intervention effectiveness. \n\n4 Based  on  a  search  of  the  impact  evaluation  repository  of  the  International  Initiative  on  Impact  Evaluation  (3ie): \n\nhttp://www.3ieimpact.org/en/evidence/impact-evaluations/impact-evaluation-repository/  \n\n5 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 13 December 2018. \n6 Pipeline  randomization  draws  on  the fact  that  projects  usually  do  not  have  capacity  to  provide  interventions  to  all \neligible populations immediately.  The approach randomizes which units (villages and households) receive specific \ninterventions first, with those that receive interventions later serving as a control population initially. \n\n\fOutputs and Activities \n\nThe  TA  is  structured  into  four  Outputs,  which  will  be  based  on  background  research, \n\nadministration of impact evaluation on the CFAVC Project is most appropriately handled by the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) under TA. \n \nB. \n \n6. \nfollowed by three rounds of field surveys. The Outputs will be delivered sequentially. \n \nOutput 1: Project Theory of Change and Evaluation Design Refined.  After consulting \n7. \nextensively  with  CFAVC  Project  stakeholders  and  relevant  development  partners,  the  TA  will \nprovide  a  clarified,  detailed  theory  of  change  for  the  CFAVC  Project  within  which  key  impact \nchannels  and  associated  assumptions  will  be  identified.    Those  assumptions  will  be  further \nreviewed against available evidence from Southeast and South Asia and will be discussed in a \nconsultation workshop to identify key interventions for evaluation. The tentative expectation is that \nevaluated interventions will include irrigation, digital finance, agricultural advisory services, and \ntargeted nutrition interventions, but this focus is subject to further investigation and discussions.  \nFor focal interventions, an appropriate and feasible impact evaluation design will be agreed with \nthe  CFAVC  Project  Management  Unit  (within  MOALI),  ADB,  and  GAFSP,  along  with  an \nassociated data collection strategy.   \n \nOutput 2: Project Target Population Characteristics Analyzed. Once a data collection \n8. \nstrategy is agreed, a baseline survey will be conducted via computer assisted personal interviews \nby  a  team  of  field  enumerators  in  2019.    This  baseline  survey  will  provide  data  on  household \ndemographics and employment, living standards and income, gender relations, assets, access to \nservices,  facility  presence,  social  capital,  vulnerability  and  coping  strategies,  nutrition,  land \nendowments (including GPS demarcation), cultivation practices, marketing, livestock, value chain \nintegration, and other own-account production.  The data will be analyzed in a report that both \ndocuments data collection and provides information needed by the CFAVC Project to help inform \nimplementation.    \n \nOutput  3:  Shorter-Term  Impacts7 Evaluated.    Villages  and  households  surveyed  in \n9. \n2019 will be revisited in 2021 during the midline survey. Based on these data, estimates of the \nshort run effects of interventions of interest on a range of indices will be estimated, including land \nuse, agricultural production, agricultural marketing, income, poverty, consumption, food security, \ndecision making, and psychometric and social capital indices.  Estimates of effects on individual \nhousehold members will be disaggregated by gender.   These short run indices will be used to \nhelp refine assumptions and priorities for the second half of CFAVC Project implementation and \nwill inform the CFAVC Project mid-term review.  \n \n10. \nOutput 4: Longer-Term Impacts Evaluated. Based on data from the end line survey in \n2023, midline survey, and baseline survey, estimates of the long-term of interventions of interest \non a range of indices will be estimated, including land use, agricultural production, agricultural \nmarketing, income, poverty, consumption, food security, decision making, and psychometric and \nsocial capital indices. Any additional indices that are identified as of interest during CFAVC Project \nimplementation will also be included.  Estimates of effects on individual household members will \nbe disaggregated by gender. These long run indices will inform the CFAVC Project Completion \n\n7 \u201cImpact\u201d here refers to causal effects, as used in impact evaluation literature, which may pertain to any type of variable \naffected by the intervention of interest.
