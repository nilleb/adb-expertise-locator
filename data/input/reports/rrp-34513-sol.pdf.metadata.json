The  economy,  however,  was\ndevastated;  major  enterprises  were  shut  down,  and  a\ncontraction in real terms of about 14 percent is expected\nin 2000. About 30,000 people abandoned their homes in\nGuadalcanal  Province  and  relocated  to  other  provinces.\nIn  refugee  communities,  many  are  without  access  to\nbasic  social  services. \nin  particular,\nsuffered  extensive  damage \ninfrastructure  and\nessential  facilities.    Roads  and  bridges  were  destroyed;\nwater  supplies  were  cut;  vehicles  and  equipment  were\nstolen  or  rendered  inoperable;  and  schools,  clinics  and\ngovernment  offices  were  ransacked  or  demolished.\nOther provinces became severely burdened by the influx\nof  displaced  people. \nthe  conflict,\nconsiderable economic and social rebuilding is required.\n\n  Guadalcanal, \nto \n\nthe  wake  of \n\nIn \n\nloan  equivalent  of  $10.0  million \n\nA \nfrom  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  Special  Funds  resources.\nThe  loan  will  have  an  amortization  period  of  32  years,\nincluding a grace period of 8 years. The interest rate will\nbe  1  percent  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent\nthereafter, with equal amortization.\n\nThe  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  assist  the\nGovernment  of  Solomon  Islands  in  restoring  essential\nfacilities  and  services  for  communities  affected  by  the\nconflict.    The  Project  covers  replacement  or  restoration\nof  government  offices,  water  supply  and  sanitation\nfacilities,  roads,  bridges,  schools,  and  health  facilities,\nincluding  associated  equipment, \nlost,\ndestroyed,  or  damaged  during  the  past  18  months  as  a\nresult  of  the  civil  strife.    In  parts  of  Guadalcanal  where\ncommunities  remain  or  will  be  reconstituted,  such\ndamaged  infrastructure,  equipment,  and  facilities  will  be\nreplaced  or  repaired  under  the  Project.    However,  in\ncases  where  affected  communities  have  no  prospect  of\nreturning  to  Guadalcanal  (due  to  safety  concerns  or\nbecause  their  homes  or  means  of  livelihood  have  also\nbeen  destroyed),  the  Project  will  restore  or  rebuild  the\n\nthat  were \n\n\fii\n\nessential  infrastructure  and  facilities  in  other  areas,\nparticularly  in  the  province  of  Malaita  where  such\ncommunities  are  located.    The  Project  also  will  provide\nfor consulting services.\n\nEstimated Cost and Financing\nPlan\n\nADB  will  finance  the  total  project  cost  of  $10.0  million\nits  Emergency  Rehabilitation\nequivalent \nAssistance Loan facility.\n\nunder \n\nEstimated Project Completion\nDate\n\n31 December 2003\n\nProcurement of Goods and\nServices\n\nDisbursement\n\nConsulting Services\n\nbe \n\nrecruited \n\nadvance\nConsultants  will \nprocurement  action,  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement, retroactive financing will be\npermitted  for  eligible  items  procured  from  13  November\n2000 for up to $1 million.\n\nunder \n\nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.  MOF will establish\nand  maintain  an  imprest  account  for  the  Project  at  the\nCentral Bank of Solomon Islands after the loan becomes\neffective.    The  ceiling  of  the  imprest  account  will  be  $1\nmillion.  The initial advance to the imprest account will be\nbased  on  the  estimated  expenditures  of  the  first  six\nmonths.  The statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure\nwill  be  used  to  liquidate/replenish  the  imprest  account\nand to reimburse other eligible expenditures.  The ceiling\nof SOE per individual payment will be $300,000.\n\ntasks  of \n\nresponsible \n\nIt  is  proposed  that  the  United  Nations  Office  for  Project\nServices (UNOPS) be engaged under the loan to provide\nthe international and domestic consultants for the Project\nManagement  Unit  (PMU).  The  main \nthe\ninternational  consultants  will  include  overall  Project\nmanagement, covering the planning, design, monitoring,\nand implementation of the subproject activities.  They will\nbe \nfor  planning  of \nthe  subproject\ncomponents,  assessment  of  works  under  various\nsubprojects,  writing  appropriate  technical  specifications,\nreviewing  detailed  designs  and  bill  of  quantities  of  the\ncivil  works,  estimating  costs,  preparation  of  bidding\ndocuments,  tendering  of  the  contract  packages,  bid\nevaluation,  construction  supervision,  monitoring  of  the\nimplementation of the project components, and ensuring\nquality. The consultants are also required to ensure that\nthere  are  mechanisms  in  place  for  effective  local\ncommunity input in the planning of the project activities.\nSuch  plans  should  take  into  account  local  community\nviews  and \nthe\nexperience  of  Government  agencies  and  staff.

The social fabric of the country has been greatly strained and\nsubstantially  altered.  The  economic  structure  of  the  country  has  also  been  severely  damaged\nalong with almost complete erosion of private sector confidence. Around 8,000 people (around\n20 percent of the formal sector workforce) lost jobs or were placed on indefinite unpaid leave.\nAbout  30,000  people  abandoned  their  homes  in  Guadalcanal  Province  and  relocated  to  other\nprovinces.    In  refugee  communities,  many  are  without  access  to  basic  social  services.\nGuadalcanal,  in  particular,  suffered  extensive  damage  to  infrastructure  and  essential  facilities.\nRoad and bridges were destroyed; water supplies were cut; vehicles and equipment were stolen\nor  rendered  inoperable;  and  schools,  clinics,  and  government  offices  were  ransacked  or\ndemolished.  The total damage suffered has been estimated at $30 million-$35 million.  Other\nprovinces  were  severely  burdened  by  the  influx  of  refugees.    In  the  wake  of  the  conflict,\nconsiderable economic and social rebuilding is required.\n\n3.\nA peace agreement signed on 15 October 2000 is expected to lead to disarmament of\nthe two militant groups. However, the situation remains fragile because many issues, including\ncompensation  and  the  proposed  self-government  of  several  provinces,  require  further\ndeliberation.  Early  revival  of  economic  activities  and  return  to  normalcy  hold  the  key  to\ncementing the peace process and putting the country back on the path of sustainable growth. In\nthe  near  term,  implementing  the  agreement  will  entail  significant  assistance  from  external\nsources,  including  support  for  disarmament,  social  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of  the\nessential physical and social infrastructure.\n\nThe  key  members  of  the  donor  community1  agreed  on  the  need  for  a  comprehensive\n4.\nand  coordinated  framework  for  external  support  to  Solomon  Islands.  At  the  request  of  the\nGovernment, it was agreed that a multidonor assessment mission would visit Solomon Islands\nas soon as the security situation permitted. Subsequently, an Asian Development Bank (ADB)\nMission  was  fielded  from  4-12  November  20002  as  part  of  the  multidonor  mission.  Other\nparticipants  were  Australia,  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  Japan,  New  Zealand,  United\nKingdom, and World Bank. The ADB Mission held discussions with officials of the Government\nand  reached  an  understanding on a proposed Post-Conflict Emergency Rehabilitation Project.\nDuring this process, the ADB Mission was in full consultation with other aid agencies involved in\nthe multidonor mission.\n\n                                                \n1 The  following  sources  of  aid  met  informally  in  August  2000  to  consider  their  respective  approaches  in  providing\nassistance  to  Solomon  Islands'  peace  building  and  economic  recovery:  Asian  Development  Bank,  Australia,\nEuropean  Union, \nInternational  Monetary  Fund,  Japan,  New  Zealand,  United  Kingdom,  United  Nations\nDevelopment  Programme,  and  the  World  Bank.  Officials  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  the  Central  Bank  of\nSolomon Islands participated in the meeting.\n\n2  The Mission comprised R. Siy Jr.,OIC, Area A, POHQ; D. Sharan, Economist, POHQ;  and R. Ram Adhar, Senior\n\nProject Implementation Officer, SPRM.\n\n\fThe  loan  is  proposed  under  ADB\u2019s  facility  for  rehabilitation  assistance  after  disasters.\n\n5.\nThe facility includes abbreviated and flexible loan processing and approval procedures.\n\n2\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA. \n\nThe Situation\n\n1. \n\nThe Conflict\n\n6.\nEconomic and social development in Solomon Islands, before and after independence in\n1978,  centered  mainly  in  and  around  the  capital,  Honiara,  on  the  island  province  of\nGuadalcanal. In 1998, of about 35,000 persons employed in the formal sector, over 51 percent\nwere  in  Honiara.  Many  from  other  provinces  migrated  to  Guadalcanal  in  search  of  better\nopportunities.  The  largest  number  of  migrants  came  from  Malaita  Province.    Over  time,  the\npressure and economic competition from migrants raised tensions between the largest group of\nmigrants  of  Malaitan  origin  and  the  native  population  of  Guadalcanal.  The  conflict  started  to\nbuild toward the end of 1998, when an armed group of militants from Guadalcanal, first known\nas the Guadalcanal Revolutionary Army and later called the Isatabu Freedom Movement (IFM),\nforced  settlers  of  Malaitan  origin  to  leave  the  island  of  Guadalcanal.  The  dispute  grew  into  a\nviolent conflict by mid-1999 and resulted in loss of lives, major damage to property, substantial\ndisruption of economic activity, and large displacement of people. By the end of 1999, a militant\ngroup of Malaitan origin, known as the Malaitan Eagle Force (MEF), was formed in retaliation.\n\n7.\nThe  MEF  took  control  of  Honiara  and  detained  the  Prime  Minister  on  5  June  2000,\nleading  to  his  resignation.  By  the  end  of  June  2000,  a  new  coalition  for  national  unity,\nreconciliation, and peace formed a Government with peace as its priority. An agreement for the\ncessation  of  hostilities  between  the  MEF  and  IFM,  and  for  restoration  of  peace  and  social\nharmony in Solomon Islands was signed on 15 October 2000 in Townsville, Australia.\n\n2.\n\nThe Economy\n\nSolomon Islands is an archipelago with a land area of 28,000 square kilometers (km2) in\n8.\nthe South Pacific. The total population of the country, based on the 1999 census, was 409,042.\nSolomon Islands comprises six main islands and more than 900 others that stretch across 1,300\nkm of the Pacific Ocean. About 80 percent of the land is rugged mountain terrain. With a large\nendowment of natural resources, including an exclusive economic zone of 1.3 million km2, the\ncountry has the potential for sustainable development and a self-reliant economy. However, this\npotential is far from realized.\n\n9.\nThe  country  has  a  narrow  production  base  in  the  secondary  sector,  which  contributes\nabout 15 percent to total output. The primary and tertiary sectors, respectively, account for 40\nand 45 percent of output. More than half of primary sector output is in the non-monetary rural-\nbased  subsistence  sector,  to  which  about  80  percent  of  the  population  belong.  Logs,  fish,\ncoconut products, oil palm, cocoa, and gold are the main exports of the country. Oil, food, and\nplant, vehicle and transport equipment are the main imports of the country.\n\nSolomon  Islands  is  one  of  the  poorest  Pacific  developing  member  countries  of  ADB,\n10.\nmanifesting  low  human  development  and  high  human  poverty  indices,  according  to  the  1999\nPacific  Human  Development  Report  of  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP).\n\n\f3\n\nThe  country\u2019s  Human  Poverty  Index  (HPI)  of  49.1  places  it  in  the  company  of  many  poor\ncountries  in  sub-Saharan  Africa.    Country  economic  and  social  indicators  are  presented  in\nAppendix 1.\n\nAt  the  beginning  of  1999,  the  economy  was  expected  to  experience  steady  growth.\n11.\nHowever, from mid-1999, economic activity, government finances, and the balance of payments\nbegan to deteriorate following the escalation of social tensions and unrest. The deterioration in\nthe  economy  was  further  aggravated  by  the  events  of  June  2000.  The  economy  in  2000  is\nexpected  to  contract  by  about  14  percent  in  real  terms.  The  worst  affected  sectors  include\nmining (-50 percent), construction (-50 percent), fishing (-42 percent), agriculture (-30 percent),\nwater  and  electricity  (-20  percent),  and  wholesale  trade  (-20  percent).  While  there  are  some\nsigns of economic revival following the peace agreement, major enterprises in mining, fishing,\nand agriculture remain closed, and the prospects for 2001 will largely depend on how soon the\ncountry returns to normality.\n\n12.\nGovernment  finances  are  in  serious  crisis  with  government  revenues  estimated  to  fall\nshort of the budget 2000 estimates by over 30 percent. The largest decline is expected in the\ncorporation  tax  (-60  percent),  followed  by  import  duty  (-50  percent)  and  export  duty  (-33\npercent).  The  Government  introduced  a  minibudget  (August-December  2000),  projecting  a\ndeficit of SI$160 million  (SI$5.16 = $1).   A significantly higher expenditure was budgeted for\nthe five months due to payments related to peace building and peacekeeping. Notable features\nof the minibudget include minimal development expenditure and a continuation of unpaid leave\nfor  about  800  public  officers.  The  overall  budget  balance  in  2000  is  projected  to  be  a  deficit\nequivalent  to  4.5  percent  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP).  The  total  stock  of  central\ngovernment debt at end of 2000 is projected to reach 75 percent of GDP, with about 60 percent\nof the same in external debt. So far, the Government has managed generally to meet its debt\nservice obligations, but arrears in other expenditure areas are rising, indicating the possibility of\ndefault on debt obligations.\n\n13.\nBecause  of  lower  domestic  demand  and  import  prices,  inflation  has  generally  been\nfalling since the second half of 1999.  Inflation was 6.1 percent in May 2000 and is expected to\nremain  low  during  the  year,  despite  higher  oil  prices.  Total  domestic  credit  increased  by  12\npercent in the nine months to September 2000, with most credit to the private sector extended\nin  the  first  half  of  2000.  Broad  money  supply  is  projected  to  grow  at  9.5  percent  in  2000.\nExports  in  2000  are  expected  to  decline  by  about  29  percent  in  US  dollar  terms  because  of\ndisruption of production. Imports are also expected to decline by about 15 percent in US dollar\nterms  largely  due  to  low  demand  for  imported  goods.  External  reserves  fell  sharply  after  the\ncrisis,  but  improved  subsequently  as  receipts  from  log  exports  improved.  Exchange  control\nmeasures  also  helped  the  improvement.  Gross  external  reserves  are  projected  to  be  $33.4\nmillion  at  the  end  of  2000,  sufficient  to  cover  only  a  little  over  two  months  of  imports.  The\nexternal position of the country remains fragile.\n\nB. \n\nExternal Assistance\n\nBecause of severe financial constraints, the Government is not in a position to finance\n14.\nany  of  the  reconstruction  work  in  the  near  term.  It  has  therefore  requested  assistance  from\nbilateral and other multilateral agencies.  Although the possible contributions of various sources\nare  yet  unclear,  there  are  some  initial  indications  of  assistance.  Assistance  from  Australian\nAgency  for  International  Development  (AusAID)  is  expected  to  focus  on  security  and  peace\nbuilding, support for health services, and small-scale community-based activities.  New Zealand\nis expected to support peace building, secondary education, small business development, and\n\n\f4\n\ncommunity-based  initiatives.    The  United  Kingdom  is  likely  to  support  education  and  public\ninformation.    Japan  is  also  a  contributor  to  the  peace  building  and  security  efforts  and  to\ngrassroots  reconstruction  work.    The  World  Bank  has  a  new  health  project  and  a  nearly\ncomplete  education  project  with  some  savings;  in  both  cases,  project  resources  may  be\nredirected  to  finance  rehabilitation  of  damaged  facilities.  Various  United  Nations  agencies  are\ninvolved  in  aspects  of  peace  making,  disarmament  and  social  reconstruction  activities.    The\nEuropean Commission may also be able to reorient some of its ongoing and approved projects\nfor  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  efforts.    Untied  grants  are  also  anticipated  from\nTaipei,China, although the amounts have not been confirmed.\n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED REHABILITATION ASSISTANCE\n\nA.\n\nExtent of Damage\n\nin  Solomon \n\nThe  social  unrest \n\nIslands  caused  extensive  damage \n\n15.\ntransport\ninfrastructure,  schools,  water  supply  and  sanitation  systems,  government  and  provincial\nbuildings,  and  health  centers  on  the  island  of  Guadalcanal  and  in  nearby  provinces.  The  total\ndamage,  estimated  at  $30  million  -  $35  million,  has  placed  a  severe  strain  on  government\nservices  in  the  affected  provinces.  This  is  further  compounded  by  a  fiscal  crisis  under  which\nmany civil servants have been sent on indefinite leave without pay. In Guadalcanal, farmers, in\nparticular,  are  finding  it  difficult  to  move  their  produce  and  livestock  to  markets.  The  tourist\nindustry has also been affected by damage to, and current inaccessibility of, resorts around the\ncoast of Guadalcanal.\n\nto \n\n16.\nHeavy machinery used by the militants during the unrest damaged many sections of the\nmain  and  adjacent  roads  in  Guadalcanal.  The  sections  of  eastern  and  western  Guadalcanal\nmain roads were excavated by militants and used as bunkers. Thirteen bridges along the above\nroads were damaged, severing transportation links to the city. The sealed roads in the capital\ncity were also extensively damaged.  The Nagalimbu Bridge, which provides access to two of\nthe  country\u2019s  largest  enterprises,  Gold  Ridge  Mining  and  Solomon  Islands  Plantations  Limited\n(an oil palm plantation), is in danger of collapse. In addition, 14 timber pile bridges on Malaita\nhave been severely weakened under the load of heavy equipment and other vehicles stolen by\nmilitants and shipped to the island.\n\n17.\nIn  Guadalcanal,  militants  damaged  the  Honiara  Water  Supply,  leaving  more  than  2/3\n(around  25,000  people)  of  Honiara\u2019s  population  without  access  to  safe  water.  Because  about\n30,000  people  were  displaced,  the  population  of  other  provinces  has  sharply  increased  (in\nTemotu  Province,  for  example,  the  population  has  risen  by  over  50  percent).  Most  schools  in\nGuadalcanal  were  damaged  or  destroyed;  schoolchildren  have  not  returned  to  school.  The\nprovincial  headquarters  building  in  Guadalcanal  was  damaged,  while  that  of  the  Central\nProvince  was  burned  down  by  militants,  disabling  communication  and  services  to  rural\ncommunities. Health facilities were similarly ruined.  Several area health centers and associated\nstaff  houses  were  burned  down,  and  rural  health  clinics  and  nurse  aide  posts,  damaged.  The\nGovernment  is  giving  high  priority  to  restoring  damaged  infrastructure  on  Guadalcanal  and\nproviding social infrastructure in other provinces where displaced people have resettled.\n\nB.\n\nSelection of Works\n\n18.\nThe  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  assist  the  Government  in  restoring  essential\nfacilities and services for communities affected by the conflict.  The Project covers replacement\n\n\f5\n\nor  restoration  of  government  offices,  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities,  roads,  bridges,\nschools,  health  other  essential  facilities,  including  associated  equipment,  that  were  lost,\ndestroyed, or damaged during the past 18 months as a result of the civil strife.  Subprojects for\nADB financing will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy of financing urgent rehabilitation\nrequirements, primarily to establish the status quo before the conflict.  The project framework is\ngiven in Appendix 2.\n\nC.\n\nRehabilitation Program\n\n19.\nIn  parts  of  Guadalcanal  where  communities  remain  or  will  be  reconstituted,  damaged\ninfrastructure, equipment, and facilities will be replaced or repaired under the Project.  However,\nin  cases  where  affected  communities  have  no  prospect  of  returning  to  Guadalcanal  (due  to\nsafety concerns or because their homes or means of livelihood had also been destroyed), the\nProject  will  restore  or  rebuild  the  essential  infrastructure  and  facilities  in  the  areas  of  other\nprovinces,  particularly  in  the  province  of  Malaita,  where  such  communities  are  located.    The\nProject  will  also  provide  consulting  services.  The  Project,  with  a  duration  of  three  years,  is\nexpected  to  begin  in  January  2001.  An  indicative  list  of  works  that  may  be  included  in  the\nProject is given in Appendix 3.\n\n20.\nThe  Government  has  requested  an  emergency  rehabilitation  loan  of  $10  million\nequivalent  from  ADB  to  finance  expenditures  associated  with  the  reconstruction  work.    The\nproposed loan, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, will finance all foreign and local costs of\nselected subprojects.  The financing of the total project cost under the proposed loan is justified\nby  the  severe  economic  crisis  and  by  the  need  for  the  Government  to  adhere  as  closely  as\npossible to fiscally responsible budget targets.\n\n21.\nThe term of the loan will be 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years.  The interest\ncharge  will  be  1  percent  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  thereafter,  with  equal\namortization. Loan utilization will be for three years.\n\nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nThe Executing Agency\n\n22.\nThe Executing Agency for the Project will be the Ministry of Finance (MOF).  A Project\nManagement Unit (PMU) staffed by international and domestic consultants will be established to\nhandle project administration.  The PMU will have a full-time project manager (an international\nconsultant) and operate under the direction of a Project Steering Committee (PSC), comprising\nsenior representatives from the ministries of finance, development planning, national unity, and\nconcerned sectoral ministries.  The committee will oversee implementation of the Project.  The\nPSC, to be chaired by the permanent secretary of finance, should be established and convened\nby MOF within two weeks after loan approval.  The PMU will also serve as the secretariat for the\nPSC.  For the first year, the PSC will meet monthly to discuss and approve the proposed work\nprogram  and  the  prioritization  of  subprojects,  evaluate  project  progress,  assist  the  PMU  to\nresolve  any  problems  or  constraints  affecting  implementation,  and  provide  guidance  on  the\nGovernment\u2019s  policies  during  implementation.    From  year  2,  the  PSC  will  meet  on  a  quarterly\nbasis.  Local  area  consultative  groups  -  comprising  representatives  from  the  provincial\ngovernment,  non-government  organizations  (NGOs),  churches,  landowners,  and  community\nleaders - will be established to discuss project activities. Their views will be considered in design\nand implementation of the project components.\n\n\f6\n\n2.\n\nConsulting Services\n\nIt is proposed that the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) be engaged\n23.\nunder the Project to provide the international and domestic consultants for the PMU. The direct\nselection  is  justified  by  the  unique  experience  and  expertise  of  United  Nations  agencies  in\ncoordinating  relief  and  rehabilitation  work  in  post-conflict  situations.    The  main  tasks  of  the\ninternational consultants will include overall project management:  planning, design, monitoring,\nand implementation of the subproject activities.  The consultants will be responsible for proper\nplanning  of  the  subproject  components,  assess  works  under  various  subprojects,  write\nappropriate  technical  specifications,  review  detailed  designs  and  bill  of  quantities  of  the  civil\nworks, estimate costs, prepare bidding documents, tender the contract packages, evaluate bids,\nsupervise construction, monitor implementation of the project components, and ensure quality.\nThe  consultants  will  also  ensure  that  mechanisms  are  in  place  for  effective  local  community\ninput  in  planning  the  project  activities.  Such  plans  should  take  into  account  local  community\nviews and indigenous knowledge, as well as the experience of Government agencies and staff.\nThe  consultants  will  also  be  responsible  for  training  local  counterpart  staff  in  design,\ndocumentation,  contract  administration,  field  supervision,  and  project  management.  The\nconsultants  will  design  an  effective  on-the-job  training  program  for  counterparts  who  will  be\nassigned  to  work  with  them.    The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants  are  given  in\nAppendix 4.\n\nLocal  consulting  services  will  be  required  for  detailed  assessment  of  damages,  design\n24.\nthe\nand  documentation,  community  consultation  and  participation,  site  supervision  of \nrehabilitation works, and accounting and auditing, among other things. The consultants will be\nselected  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other\narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants.\n\n3.\n\nProcurement\n\n25.\nThe  PMU  will  procure  civil  works  and  goods  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on\nProcurement.  All  civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $500,000  will  be  procured\nthrough ADB\u2019s international shopping procedures from prequalified contractors. To promote the\nlocal  construction  industry,  its  participation  in  joint  ventures  will  be  encouraged.  Civil  works\ncontracts  estimated  to  cost  $500,000  or  less  will  be  awarded  to  prequalified  contractors  using\nthe  Government\u2019s  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  To  expedite\nrehabilitation  measures,  direct  purchase  procedures  will  apply  in  procuring  of  construction\nmaterials,  and  hiring  or  purchasing  equipment  for  contracts  estimated  to  cost  less  than\n$100,000.    In  cases  where  international  shopping  will  apply,  procurement  notices  will  be\nadvertised in Honolulu, USA; New Zealand; and Australia to ensure sufficient competition.\n\n4.\n\nDisbursements\n\nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement\n26.\nHandbook.    MOF  will  establish  and  maintain  an  imprest  account  for  the  Project  at  the  Central\nBank of Solomon Islands after the loan becomes effective.  The ceiling of the imprest account is\n$1.0  million  with  the  initial  advance  being  based  on  the  estimated  expenditures  for  the  first  six\nto\nmonths. \nliquidate/replenish the imprest account and to reimburse other eligible expenditures.  The ceiling\nfor  any  individual  payment  is  $300,000.    Withdrawal  applications  will  be  prepared  by  the  PMU\n\n  The  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures  (SOE)  procedure  will  be  used \n\n\f7\n\nand  signed  by  the  secretary  of  finance.    The  imprest  account  and  SOE  will  be  audited  by  an\nindependent  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB.    A  separate  audit  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest\naccount and the SOE procedure will be included in the annual audit report.\n\n5.\n\nAdvance Action and Retroactive Financing\n\n27.\nConsultants  are  being  recruited  under  advance  procurement  action.    Retroactive\nfinancing  will  be  permitted  for  eligible  items  procured  from  13  November  2000  for  up  to  $1\nmillion.\n\n6.\n\nReports, Accounts and Audits\n\n28.\n\nThe following reports will be submitted to ADB:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nat  the  end  of  each  month,  a  brief  summary  report,  including  as  attachment  the\nminutes of the PSC meeting;\n\nimplementation  and \n\nthe  progress  of  project \n\nat the end of each quarter, a detailed progress and financial report containing an\nevaluation  of \nindividual\ncomponents;  constraints  affecting  implementation  and  actions  proposed;  any\nrecommendations  on  changes  or  adjustments  in  policies,  procedures,  or\noperations  to  improve  implementation;  and  a  detailed  program  of  works  for  the\nnext  quarter  based  on  the  implementation  schedule.    In  subproject  areas,  the\nreport  will  also  assess  the  likelihood  of  normal  services  being  resumed  in  the\narea  concerned  following  subproject  completion  and  include  a  brief  update  on\nactivities of other funding agencies involved in rehabilitation work;\n\nits \n\naudited financial statements for the project accounts and imprest accounts within\nsix months after the end of each fiscal year; and\n\nupon  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  a  project  completion  report  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines as required in the Loan Agreement.\n\n7.\n\nAnticorruption Provisions\n\nADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  was  brought  to  the  attention  of  the  Government.    In\n29.\nparticular,  attention  was  drawn  to  ADB\u2019s  policy  to  require  the  governments  to  observe  the\nhighest ethical standards during implementation of ADB-financed projects.\n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n30.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documentation:\n\n(i) \n\nPrior  to  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  establish  and  convene  a  PSC\nmade  up  of  senior  representatives  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of\nDevelopment Planning, Ministry of National Unity and relevant sectoral ministries\nto oversee project implementation.\n\n\f8\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe Government will ensure that the PSC meets as often as necessary, at least\nonce a month during the first year of implementation of the Project and quarterly\nthereafter, to discuss the progress of the Project, assist the PMU to resolve any\nproblems or constraints affecting implementation, and provide guidance on policy\nissues.\n\nThe  Government  through  the  services  of  UNOPS  will  establish  a  PMU  to  be\nstaffed  by  international  and  domestic  consultants  who  will  be  responsible  for\nadministering the Project under the direction of the PSC.\n\nThe  Government  will  ensure,  and  will  cause  the  PSC  and  PMU  to  ensure,  that\nthe  design  and  implementation  of  the  Project  and  its  components  take  into\naccount the views of local people and their representatives.  For this purpose, the\nGovernment  will  encourage  the  establishment  of  local  consultative  groups\ncomprising  representatives  of  the  provincial  government,  NGOs,  churches,\nlandowners, and community leaders.\n\nPrior to the planning or processing of any subproject, the PMU will obtain ADB\u2019s\nconcurrence on the inclusion of the subproject for financing under the loan.\n\nBefore  awarding  a  contract  for  any  subproject,  the  Government  will  confirm  to\nADB  that  the  relevant  property  rights  and  any  other  authorization  required  for\nimplementing  the  subproject  and  its  utilization  upon  completion  have  been\nobtained by the Government.\n\nVI.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\n31.\nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to\nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  7,771,000  to  Solomon  Islands  for  the  Post-Conflict  Emergency\nRehabilitation Project, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an\ninterest charge at the rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per\nannum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with\nthose set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board.\n\n29 November 2000\n\nTADAO CHINO\n    President\n\n\f9\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nNumber\n\nTitle\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nCountry Performance Indicators\n\nProject Framework\n\nIndicative List of Repair and Rehabilitation Works\n\nOutline Terms of Reference for Project Management\nConsultants\n\nPage\n\n  Cited on\n(page, para.)\n\n10\n\n12\n\n13\n\n15\n\n3, 10\n\n5, 18\n\n5, 19\n\n6, 23\n\n\f 10\n\nAppendix 1, page 1\n\nCOUNTRY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\nTable A1.1: Economic Indicators, Solomon Islands\n\nItem\n\nA.\n\nIncome and Growth\n1.
