The Project will support the goals of the \nTenth  Plan  (the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy) by  \n(i) supporting the delivery of market-oriented, short-term (MOST) \ntraining,  particularly  to  women,  Dalits  (low  caste),  and  the \ndisadvantaged;  (ii)  strengthening  the  capacity  to  facilitate  and \ndeliver short-term training; while (iii) articulating in parallel a new \ntechnical education and vocational training (TEVT) policy.  \n   \nRationale  Nepal  faces  a  complex  development  setting  of  conflict  and \npolitical instability.  The underlying causes of the conflict include \npoverty and its manifestations in terms of regional, gender, ethnic, \nand caste-related inequalities; inadequate governance; and failure \nto deliver adequate and essential social services and facilities to \nrural communities and marginalized groups. The need is urgent to \naddress  chronic  poverty  and  social  exclusion,  achieve  high \neconomic  growth  to  improve  living  conditions, and achieve a \nlasting solution to the conflict. In its poverty reduction strategy,  \nthe Government recognizes the urgency and seriousness of the \nconflict situation and the role of poverty, and emphasizes the need \nfor economic growth, social sector development, social inclusion \nprograms, and good governance. \n \nNepal\u2019s slow growth in recent years, high unemployment rate, and \nlarge proportion of the population living below the poverty line call \nfor measures to increase the potential for employment and income \ngeneration.  With  formal  sector  employment  not  expanding, \nopportunities  for  income  generation  are  in  informal  self-\nemployment   and   international  labor  markets  where  Nepalese  \nworkers are in demand. However, at present, Nepalese lack the \nnecessary skills to take advantage of these opportunities, to be \nmore   competitive   locally,  and   to  engage   in  self-employment \n \n   \n ", "iv   \n  activities. Access to skills training is limited, especially for the \npoor, women, Dalits, and disadvantaged, and the quality of skills \ntraining is variable and often not linked to market needs. Overall, \nexisting institutions lack the capacity to fully serve the needs of \nshort-term  skill  training.  New  measures  are  required  to \nsubstantially increase the number of people who acquire skills that \nlead to incomes. Strengthening the  vocational training sector  to \ndeliver  more  relevant  and  MOST  training,  and  supporting  the \nprovision of more of these programs is one such measure.  \n \nObjective  The  goal  of  the  Project  is  to  promote  poverty  reduction  and \nstability  by  increasing  engagement  in  wage  and  international \nemployment and self-employment. The purpose is to increase \nopportunities for MOST skill training by improving the relevance \nand increasing the delivery of MOST skill training, particularly to \nwomen, Dalits, and the disadvantaged.  \n \nThe Project aims to (i) increase access to MOST skills training, \nparticularly  by  women,  Dalits,  and  the  disadvantaged;  \n(ii)  strengthen  the  capacity  of  key  agencies  to  enhance  their \nservices  to  the  short-term  training  sector  and  hence  improve \nrelevance  and  quality;  (iii)  strengthen  training  providers  to \nenhance access and improve the relevance and quality of training; \nand (iv) develop and articulate a new policy to achieve greater \nintegration, coordination, relevance, and efficiency in the TEVT \nsector. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total  Project cost is estimated at $25.0 million equivalent, \nincluding physical contingency and price escalation, taxes and \nduties, and interest charges, of which $2.3 million (9%) comprises \nthe foreign exchange cost and $22.7 million equivalent (91%) the \nlocal  currency  cost.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) will \nfinance 80% of the project cost; including 100% of the foreign \nexchange  cost  and  78%  of  the  local  currency  cost.  \nThe Government will provide $5.0 million equivalent (20%).  \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \nForeign  Local  Total  Percent \nSource \nExchange  Currency  Cost \n         \nADB   2.3    17.7    20.0     80 \nGovernment   0.0    5.0    5.0   20 \nTotal   2.3    22.7    25.0   100 \nADB= Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \n ", "  v\nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  SDR13,615,000  ($20 million  equivalent)  from  the \nSpecial Funds resources of ADB will be provided. The loan will \nhave a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years,  \nan interest  rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 March 2011  \n   \nEstimated Project  30 September 2010 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Education and Sports \n   \nImplementation  The  Council  for  Technical  Education  and  Vocational  Training \nArrangements  (CTEVT)  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency.  A  project  steering \ncommittee will be established.  \n \nCTEVT  will  establish  a  project  implementation  unit,  organize \nworking groups to coordinate and guide the implementation of \nproject components, and appoint focal people for various aspects \nof  project  implementation.  Community-based  training  will  be \nimplemented in the districts through the  Department of Cottage \nand Small Industries (DCSI) and  Cottage and Small Industries \nDevelopment Board (CSIDB)  district offices.  A district steering \ncommittee  will  be  established.  For  policy  development  and \narticulation,  the  existing  committees\u2014the  Policy  Coordination \nCommittee, the Policy Steering Committee, and the Core Working \nGroup\u2014will continue their respective roles. \n   \nProcurement  CTEVT will  undertake  the procurement of goods and services \nfinanced  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement reflecting ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy and mandatory \nuse of ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents. \n   \nConsulting Services  The selection and engagement of all project-financed consulting \nservices  will  be  in  accordance  with  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection using ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of \ndomestic consultants. A team of consultants to provide services in \na range of specialties with estimated international inputs of 21 \nperson-months  and  domestic  inputs  of  66  person-months  is \nplanned. These services will be provided by individual consultants \nand  consulting  firms,  and  will  be  selected  according  to  ADB \nguidelines.  In  addition,  nongovernment  organizations  in  the \ndistricts will be contracted to undertake training needs analysis, \nbeneficiary mapping, and identification of trainees. ", "vi   \nProject Benefits and  The Project supports national efforts  for poverty reduction and \nBeneficiaries  stability,  especially  in  the  context  of  the  current  conflict.  \nThe  Project  aims  to  improve  access  to  employment  or  self-\nemployment  for  women,  socially  excluded  Dalits,  and \ndisadvantaged groups, as well as poor socioeconomic groups in \ngeneral. The Project targets the poor and will have at least 60% of \nthe  trainee  beneficiaries  representing  women,  Dalits,  or \ndisadvantaged  groups,  while  ensuring  that  at  least  50%  are \nwomen  and  at  least  25%  are  Dalit.  This targeting by social \ngrouping,  as  well  as  awareness-raising  of  gender  equity  and \nsocial  inclusion  issues  among  institutions,  is  expected  to \ncontribute to conflict resolution efforts, by addressing some of the \nprimary root causes, i.e., poverty and social exclusion.  \n \nThe main project benefits include (i) more skilled Nepalese able to \ngain local and international employment, (ii) more Nepalese given \nthe  opportunity  for  self-employment  through  skills  training,  \n(iii) increased market-relevance  and  improved  quality  of  short-\nterm training programs, and (iv) increased in-country capacity to \ndevelop and deliver MOST skill training. The direct beneficiaries of \nthe Project will be (i)  the unemployed and underemployed  who \nwould like to gain skills for employment and income generation, \nparticularly  women,  Dalits,  and  the  disadvantaged;  (ii)  various \nministries  supporting  short-term  training;  and  (iii)  CTEVT  and \npublic and private training providers. About 80,000 trainees will \ndirectly benefit from skills training under the Project. \n \nWith  improvements  in  relevance  and  quality  of  skill  training \nprograms, and increasing access to short-term training programs, \nthe Project will generate increases in labor productivity that will \nincrease  the  competitiveness  of  Nepalese  locally and abroad.  \nThis should increase their probability of employment, shorten job \nsearch time, and increase offered wages. As some training will be \noriented to international work, remittances from employed trainees \nwill contribute to the national income and reduce pressures on the \nbalance of payments. Increased incomes from employment also \nhave  economywide  multiplier  effects,  as  they  are  spent  on \nconsumer  goods,  house  construction,  and  education,  among \nothers. \n \nA national TEVT policy will reduce fragmentation and duplication \nof training activities by introducing nationally agreed coordination \nmechanisms  that  allocate  clear-cut roles, responsibilities, and \njurisdictions to training providers. CTEVT\u2019s capacity to coordinate \nacross ministerial lines and with employers, to serve the TEVT \nsector, and for quality assurance will be enhanced. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  vii \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  uncertain  security  situation  and  political  instability  in  the \n  country  represent  major  risks  to  achieving  the  Project\u2019s \n  development goals. Although project implementation is slow  in \n  conflict-affected areas, projects aimed  at training  are generally \n  favorably received. Project design incorporates lessons learned \nfrom implementation in Nepal\u2019s conflict areas, including ensuring \nadequate community participation and targeting beneficiaries who \nare women, Dalits, or from disadvantaged groups. Implementation \nwill  be  phased  and  lessons  learned  during  implementation, \nparticularly  during  the  first  year  of  skills-training  activities,  \nwill  contribute  to  fine-tuning  implementation  arrangements, \nprocedures, and criteria. \n \nTo coordinate activities within the training sector with a common \npurpose  and  comparable  outcomes,  the  Project  supports  the \ndevelopment of a new national TEVT policy and framework and \ninvolves a wide stakeholder consultation process. Project support \nis also extended to interministerial and multistakeholder activities, \nincluding standards and curriculum workshops.  \n \nThe Project aims to  improve the quality of short-term training,  \nnot only within the public sector but also in the private sector by \nproviding training to trainers, training supervisors, and senior staff. \nTo boost the attendance of participants from private providers,  \nthe  Project  will  publicize  the  training  among  the  providers.  \nIn addition, the training will be implemented across the country, \nbringing it closer to prospective participants.   \n \nThe success of the Project in meeting its goal depends on the \nincreased ability of the training recipients to enter employment or \nself-employment,  or  generate  income  as  a  result  of  skills \ndevelopment training. The Project will build the capacity of training \nproviders to identify posttraining support services, including linking \nwith employers, marketers, and nongovernment and community-\nbased organizations. \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Kingdom of Nepal for the Skills for Employment Project.1 The  project framework is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \n2.  Nepal  faces  a  complex  development  setting  of  conflict  and  political  instability.  \nThe underlying causes of the conflict include poverty and its manifestations in terms of regional, \ngender, ethnic, and caste-related inequalities; inadequate governance; and failure to deliver \nadequate and essential social services and facilities to rural communities and marginalized \ngroups. Urgently needed are measures to address the chronic poverty and social exclusion, and \nachieve high economic growth to improve living conditions and achieve a lasting solution to the \nconflict.2  The  Tenth  Plan,3  which  is  also  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy, \nemphasizes economic growth, social sector development, social inclusion programs, and good \ngovernance. The plan articulates the seriousness and urgency of the conflict situation and the \nrole of poverty. Disadvantaged groups are targeted for greater participation in development, \nincluding  gaining  basic  education  and  skills  training  for  self-employment,  and  wage  and \ninternational employment. Greater emphasis is also to be given to encouraging out-of-country \nemployment.  \n \n3.  The Country Strategy and Program for Nepal for 2005\u20132009 of the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  (footnote  2)  supports  the  implementation  of  the  Tenth  Plan  and  focuses  on \npromoting  broad-based  and  inclusive  social  and  economic  development  to  contribute  to \nsustainable poverty reduction and help reduce social tensions. ADB\u2019s assistance to Nepal \nfocuses on three areas that include supporting inclusive social and human development and \nempowering the poor and disadvantaged by providing basic education and vocational training \nneeded to increase productivity and generate remunerative employment. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis   \n \n4.  Landlocked, Nepal is the 12th poorest country in the world. In 2001 its gross domestic \nproduct per capita was $241, the lowest in the South Asia region.  Its population stood at  \n23.2  million,  with  a  population  growth  rate  of  about  2.4%.  About  38%  live  in  poverty.  \nThe population is relatively young with children under 15 years constituting the dominant group \n(43%). The majority, 87% of the population, live in rural areas.  The country has at  least 35 \nethnic and 36 caste groups who speak different languages and a number of dialects as their \nmother tongue. Nepal\u2019s economic performance is poor with low potential for improvement in the \nmedium term. The economy is still predominantly based on agriculture, which comprises about \n40% of the gross domestic product. Manufacturing contributes 8% and services account for the \nrest. Agriculture production fluctuates from year to year, and is heavily dependent on the \nmonsoon.  The  Central Region  is  the  most  developed,  followed  by  the  Eastern, Western, \nMidwestern, and Far Western regions.4 \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n3  National Planning Commission, Government of Nepal. 2003. The Tenth Plan (Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper) \n2002\u20132007. Kathmandu. \n4  Administratively, the country is divided into five development regions (Eastern, Central, Western, Midwestern, and \nFar Western), 14 zones, 75 districts, 3,912 village development committees, and 58 municipalities including one \nmetropolitan and four submetropolitan cities. ", "2  \n \n5.  The Labor Market. More than 92% of the employed labor force work in rural areas, 81% \nin subsistence agriculture. The total unemployment rate is estimated at 17.4%, which is largely \naccounted for by underemployment.5 Of the 9.5 million workforce, only 1.5 million (16%) are \nengaged in paid employment; the remaining 8 million are self-employed, with about 4 million \nworking as unpaid family workers. The major sectors for formal employment are manufacturing, \nconstruction, retail sales, and hotels and restaurants.  Government, public corporations, and \nregistered private companies are the major formal sector employers, and comprise the majority \nof employers of technicians, clerks, and higher salaried occupations. Foreigners hold 7.2% of \nthe jobs in Nepal. The porous border with India allows many Indians to work in Nepal and vice \nversa. Indian workers are given preference in construction work, as they are considered more \nskilled, more experienced, and more reliable than Nepalese.6 \n \n6.  Every year, about 200,000 new workers enter the labor market. The majority have no \nschool  leaving  certificate  (SLC)  and  are  thus  not  eligible  for  many  formal  sector  jobs. \nOpportunities  for  new  employment  in  the  formal  sector  are  limited  because  of  the  slow \neconomic  growth,  and  the  small  share  of  and  required  qualifications  for  formal  sector \nemployment. In response, many Nepalese explore work opportunities outside of the country, \nincluding  India.  The  majority  are  engaged  in  informal  work.  During  project  preparation \nconsultations, many groups asked for opportunities to engage in or increase their incomes in \ninformal sector work, including self-employment. Remittances from the estimated  1 million \nNepalese working abroad contribute about  25% of the  gross domestic product. In 2001/02, \nabout 105,000 left the country for foreign employment under formal arrangements. The greatest \ndemands were for unskilled, semiskilled, and skilled labor in service, construction, and metal \nand machine operator occupations. According to one study,7 the majority of migrant workers \nhave not completed their basic education, and most can best be described as literate. The same \nstudy reported that semiskilled and skilled workers  working outside of the country in 2003 \nreceived an average monthly salary of NRs23,300. Locally, monthly wages of skilled labor in \nconstruction in urban areas is about NRs6,000. Of the requests by international employers for \n100,000 Nepalese workers in 2003, only half of the demand was filled. The majority of unfilled \nrequests were for semiskilled and skilled workers\u2014Nepalese lack the appropriate skills.  \n \n7.  Education.  With  the  Government's  commitment  to  achieve  the  goals  set  in  the \nEducation for All and the Millenium Development Goals, enrollment in primary education has \nbeen increasing. As of 2001, the net enrollment rate was 81% in the primary grades and 39% in \nsecondary grades. However,  the education system is characterized by high  dropout rates,  \nlow quality, and differences across gender and castes. Many students are unable to complete \ntheir education. Students typically sit for the SLC examination at the end of grade 10; in 2001, \nthe pass rate was about 32%. The high dropout rate and low pass rate mean that many \nstudents leave school without an education certificate. After schooling, opportunities for gaining \nskills for employment are limited.  \n \n8.  Technical Education and Vocational Training Sector. The technical education and \nvocational training (TEVT) sector  offers  both  long-term technical education and short-term \ntraining vocational training (Appendix 2). Technical education requires grade 10 qualification or \nan SLC pass, while vocational training does not. In the public sector, several ministries provide \ntraining; some offer training along sector lines. The estimated national total training capacity is \n                                                 \n5  Ministry of Finance, Government of Nepal. 2003. Economic Survey 2003.

", "               3       \nabout 50,000 places annually, with the Government being the major provider.8 The Council for \nTechnical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT) is charged with facilitating the growth \nand development of a skilled workforce in Nepal. CTEVT is tasked with providing support and \nservices to both public and private training providers, and ensuring the quality of basic and \nmiddle level TEVT.  CTEVT  also  administers  several  training  institutions  that  offer  diploma \nprograms and mostly technical SLCs (TSLCs). Several privately run institutions are affiliated \nwith  CTEVT  and  offer  its  TSLC  curriculum.  CTEVT  has  established  annex  schools  in  \n15 districts, offering mainly technical education programs. Tribhuvan University offers programs \nleading to technician qualifications.  \n \n9.  Short-term training is offered by the Department of Cottage and Small Industries (DCSI); \nCottage and Small Industry Development Board (CSIDB) of the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, \nand  Supplies;  Department  of  Labor  and  Employment  Promotion  (DOLEP);  and  CTEVT \ninstitutions. Training programs are at most 6 months long. Through the district office networks of \nDCSI and CSIDB, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies has a presence in every \ndistrict. DOLEP operates skills training centers and technical schools throughout Nepal. Private \ntraining providers, including those affiliated with CTEVT, also provide short-term training.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities  \n \n10.  For the numerous Nepalese who have left school without an SLC pass and marketable \nskills, and are unemployed, training is necessary to avail of income-earning opportunities and \nmove out of poverty. To take advantage of available jobs abroad, to be more competitive locally, \nand to engage in self-employment activities, greater access to relevant and effective skills \ntraining programs is required. However, the TEVT sector, and particularly vocational training,  \nis confronted with several issues in meeting this requirement.  \n \n11.  Inadequate Access to Training. The TEVT sector in Nepal performs poorly in terms of \nproviding  access  to  training,  particularly  market-oriented  short-term  (MOST)  skills  training.  \nMost  people,  particularly  the  poor  and  disadvantaged,  lack  access  to  skills training that \nenhances earning capacity. About 200,000 people seek to enter the labor market each year. \nYet, in the 1998 census, only 403,000 of a total working age population of 11 million indicated \nreceiving some form of training. No more than 50,000  a year currently have access to skills \ntraining. TSLC programs run by CTEVT, which require 10 years of schooling, cannot be \naccessed  by  most,  particularly  the  poor,  women,  Dalits  (low  caste),  and  members  of \ndisadvantaged groups because of their lower educational achievement. Short-term training \nprograms linked to available jobs are not readily available and are mainly offered in a limited \nmanner by CTEVT and private providers in large urban areas, which are difficult to access for \nthose living in distant areas. Even if training were provided free of charge, attendance would \nmean that the poor must forgo daily wages. \n \n12.  Poor Relevance of Training. The public TEVT system is largely supply-driven. Training \nprograms are often based on the allocated budgets of public training providers, and available \nstaff and equipment. Training needs assessment (TNA) is weak and often absent; the available \nlabor market information system is unable to provide up-to-date labor market data to assist \ntraining program selection. The outcomes of both rarely guide the selection of skills and \ncontents, with the consequence that offered courses and their contents are regularly irrelevant \nto needs and demands. Linkages between educational institutions and industry are inadequate \nand have led to a lack of mutual cooperation. Thus, training institutions are often not fully aware \n                                                 \n8  World Bank estimate. ", "4  \nof the needs of industry nor are they able to fully explore ways industry can help, such as \nthrough on-the-job training programs. \n \n13.  Training programs have not yet significantly refocused on  the emerging needs of the \nlabor market. While the major potential sources of employment and income generation are in \nthe informal/self-employment and foreign employment sectors, training for these is insufficient. \nTo improve the relevance of programs, training providers need to make a better determination \nof  trainees\u2019  and  employers\u2019  needs,  and  analyze  communities\u2019  economic  opportunities.  \nThe larger public training providers need to provide more MOST skills training programs for \nthose who have less than SLC. The participation of communities, through community-based \norganizations (CBOs) and nongovernment organizations (NGOs), will facilitate the process of \nidentifying and implementing programs in communities.  \n \n14.  Low Quality of Training. In addition to being poorly identified, some training programs \nare poorly designed and/or poorly delivered. Curricula are not sufficiently regularly revised to \nreflect changing market demands. Training providers focus on delivering content, as specified in \ntheir curriculum, and not on achieving the performance expected for employment, as specified \nin skills and training standards. Trainers, in turn, have no benchmarks to measure their own \ntechnical and instructional capability, and thus have no means of determining the gap between \ntheir current performance and their desired capability. Performance specifications,  or skills \nstandards, are needed as benchmarks for delivery and assessment. Many instructors, including \nthose  employed  by  private  providers,  have  no  training  in  instructional  techniques  and  no \nextensive technical expertise; they are rarely upgraded. Public training institutions have limited \nbudgets, not allowing them to train staff. Most public provider sites lack tools, equipment, \nmaterials, and supplies.  Monitoring of the quality of training programs needs to be improved. \nThe present CTEVT accreditation system needs to be more informative and transparent, and \nexpanded to include emerging short-term programs, especially those aimed at foreign demand.  \n \n15.  Lack of Posttraining Support. Many TEVT providers focus solely on training rather \nthan training outcomes. Most do not provide posttraining support, e.g., career placement and \ncounseling. Such support is particularly critical in training for self-employment as  linkages \nshould be provided to economic opportunities, e.g., jobs and microfinance programs. Providers \nneed to be trained to provide or link to such services. \n \n16.  Need for TEVT Coordination. The TEVT sector  is highly fragmented. Although a \nnational TEVT policy was approved in 1999 by the CTEVT Assembly, this is not adhered to by \nall  stakeholders.  Skills  development  is  organized  by  government  ministries  (and  within \nministries, by departments), NGOs, aid projects, and, to some extent, local initiatives. The roles \nof the various stakeholders of the TEVT system have not been clearly defined and organized. \nAlthough CTEVT is the apex agency for TEVT policy coordination, the expansion of the number \nof training institutions under its administration  has resulted in it focusing on training delivery \nrather than on its role as an apex organization. It has been unable to provide an integrating role \nfor the whole system of TEVT provision. Most TEVT-related decisions on issues, including \nTEVT policy, allocation of resources, and system management, are made at the central level of \nCTEVT and within each of the respective line ministries with little consultation and participation \nof key stakeholders such as the private sector and local communities. Most training providers \nwork to their own benchmarks and curricula; outcomes are variable. Consequently, agencies \nhave no common purpose or comparable outcomes. Coordination between their respective \nprograms is limited, leading to duplication of activities, e.g., development of curricula and skills \nstandards, and, therefore, wastage of already scarce resources. Information relating to labor \ndemand and the TEVT subsector, including training program information, trainees, and program \nefficiency and effectiveness, are scarce. Moreover, government funding for training to each ", "               5       \npublic agency is based on the needs of the given department rather than the priorities within the \ntraining market.  Incentives and rewards for well-performing  institutions  are  lacking,  as  are \nsanctions for nonperforming institutions. \n \n17.  Lessons Learned. ADB's past experiences with TEVT, including the last TEVT project \nin Nepal,9 highlight issues related to infrastructure utilization and increasing the level of training \nwith existing resources. CTEVT has been unable to significantly expand the provision of training \ndelivery beyond the life of the project because of lack of resources. The attention to service \ndelivery has resulted in  fewer resources available to enhance its standing as a coordinating \nbody. Experience with this project also emphasizes the need for CTEVT to refocus its direction \nto strengthen the TEVT sector as a whole, and thus perform a key strategic role, and reduce its \nattention  to  training  delivery,  which  can  be  undertaken  by  many  other  training  providers. \nSimilarly, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies must develop the capability to \nfacilitate training undertaken by private providers rather than necessarily delivering all training.  \n \n18.  In the international arena, the development of national frameworks such as qualification \nframeworks and skills standards, when adequately contextualized to the country, have served \nas  powerful  mechanisms  to  gain  consistency  of  approach  and  drive  a  demand-focused \napproach.10 Experiences of some development partners in Nepal have shown that training alone \nis insufficient to gain self-employment. Too much training occurs without any employment \noutcomes. A holistic approach needs to be adopted that combines TNA, which identifies skills \nneeds as well as product markets; selection of trainees who are most likely to be entrepreneurs; \nwhere appropriate, delivery of quality training linked to employment demand; and posttraining \nservices. Successful outcomes from training are more likely to occur within social partnership \narrangements. A strong relationship is needed (i) between training providers and the funding \nauthority, which leads to mutual learning and ongoing capacity development of the training \nprovider; and (ii) between training providers, communities, and special interest groups.  \n \n19.  Experiences  with  other projects  show  a  slower  pace  of  implementation  in  conflict-\naffected areas; however, projects aimed at training are generally received favorably. Lessons \nlearned from project implementation in conflict-affected areas of Nepal point to several factors \nthat  contribute  to  success,  including  (i)  the  degree  to  which  the  project  benefits  the \ncommunities, (ii) the transparency of budgets and resource allocations, (iii) a politically neutral \nstance, (iv) a participatory approach that involves local communities, and (v) a decentralized \napproach to implementation.  \n \n20.  External Assistance and  Aid Coordination. External assistance to education has \nbeen increasing. Between FY1997/98 and 2001/02, of the NRs49 trillion education and training \nexpenditures, 18% were from foreign loans and grants\u2014 the majority supported basic education \nactivities. Development partners include ADB, World Bank, Swiss Agency for Development and \nCooperation (SDC), Danish International Development Assistance, Department for International \nDevelopment,  European  Union,  Finland,  Japan,  Norway,  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme, and United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. Past external assistance to TEVT has been \nfrom ADB, World Bank, SDC, and international NGOs. SDC has been providing technical \nassistance to CTEVT, including  support for  the  Training  Institute  for  Technical  Instruction.  \nSDC is supporting short-term training delivery and the development of a national skills testing \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 1989.

THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.   Objectives \n \n21.  The goal of the Project is to promote poverty reduction  and stability  by  increasing \nengagement in wage and international employment, and self-employment. The purpose is to \nincrease opportunities for MOST skills training by improving the relevance of and increasing the \ndelivery  of  MOST  skills  training,  particularly  to  women,  Dalits,  and  the  disadvantaged.  \nThe Project aims to (i) increase access to MOST skills training, particularly by women, Dalits, \nand the disadvantaged; (ii) strengthen the capacity of key agencies to enhance their services, \nparticularly  to  the  vocational  training  sector,  and  hence  improve  relevance  and  quality;  \n(iii) strengthen training providers to enhance access and improve the relevance and quality of \ntraining; and (iv) develop and articulate a new national policy to achieve greater integration, \nrelevance, and efficiency in the TEVT sector. The Project will serve beneficiaries from all \ndistricts of the country.  \n \nB.   Components and Outputs \n \n22.  The Project will support the goals of the Tenth Plan by assisting the delivery of MOST \ntraining, particularly to  women, Dalits, and the disadvantaged; strengthening the capacity to \nfacilitate and deliver short-term training; and helping articulate a new TEVT policy. The Project \ncomprises  three  components:  (i)  increasing  access  to  MOST  skills  training,  (ii)  capacity \nstrengthening, and (iii) supporting policy development, articulation, and implementation. \n \n1.  Increasing Access to Market-Oriented, Short-Term Skills Training \n \n23.  This component provides support to increase the delivery of and access to MOST skills \ntraining, particularly  to the poor. The Project targets the poor  to receive subsidized training. \nOverall, at least 60% of the trainees will be women, Dalits, or disadvantaged\u2014ensuring that \n50% of all trainees are women and  25% are  Dalits. The Project will provide  about 80,000 \nbeneficiaries with access to short-term training.  \n \na.  Disseminating Information on Short-Term Training and Employment \n \n24.  The Project will support the development and implementation of a TEVT awareness plan \nemploying the mass media. An information dissemination plan for skills training activities and \nresources in districts will be developed and implemented in districts and wards using a network \nof government and nongovernment groups. The gender, caste, and ethnicity (GCE) specialist \nwill help develop plans to ensure they reach women, Dalits, and the disadvantaged.  \n \nb.  Supporting Delivery of Short-Term Skills Training for Formal and \n            International Labor Markets  \n \n25.  The Project will support the analysis of labor market demand for formal and international \nlabor markets. Based on this, it will prioritize occupational areas for training and prepare training \nspecifications  through  consultancies,  workshops,  and  incremental  recurrent  cost  financing.  \nThe Project will provide resources for the development of standards and sample curricula for \nskills associated with these occupational areas, where none exist.  The Project will increase ", "               7       \naccess to MOST by providing for training development cost and training delivery recurrent \ncosts, which include instructor fees, rent, consumables, and learner materials for about 55,000 \nbeneficiary trainees. Training programs will include elements of life skills and entrepreneurship, \nas appropriate. Training delivery will be tendered and include both center-based and enterprise-\nbased training.  CTEVT will consider providing stipends to cover transportation expense for \nthose who live away from the training sites and to reimburse some of  the wages lost while \nattending training along guidelines to be approved by the project steering committee (ProSC). \nTraining proposals from employers and training providers for the delivery of MOST for formal \nand international employment, specifically for targeted beneficiaries, are welcome and subject to \nthe same criteria as described for selecting training programs and training providers. Criteria for \nselecting training providers will include price, capacity, and posttraining support such as on-the-\njob training and employment. \n \nc.   Supporting  the  Delivery  of  Community-Based,  Market-Oriented, \nShort-Term Skills Training \n \n26.  The Project will support community-based delivery of  MOST training. The Project will \ncontract international and local  NGOs, with continuing work and presence in the district,  to \nmobilize  communities  and  undertake  TNA;  prepare  training  proposals;  identify  potential \nbeneficiaries; and partner, where available, with a training provider.  Local and international \nNGOs will be provided with capacity strengthening in TNA. Training proposals will be assessed \nand the Project will provide support to deliver the training in the community for about 25,000 \nbeneficiaries. The Project will provide for training development costs and training delivery \nrecurrent costs, which include instructor fees, consumables, and training materials. The delivery \nof training programs will be tendered. Training programs will include elements of life skills and \nentrepreneurship,  and  provide  posttraining  services,  including  linkages  with  employers, \nmarketers, and local financing groups, as well as basic tools. Community contributions, such as \ntraining venue and accommodations for trainers, will be requested. Provision of stipends to \nreimburse  some  of  the  wages  lost  while  attending  training  will  be  considered  along  the \nguidelines to be approved by the ProSC. For center-based training, the Project will provide for \nthe cost of the training program, transportation expenses, and, in recognition of the opportunity \ncosts of labor, provision of living allowances will be considered for eligible trainees along \napproved  guidelines.  Employers  and  training  providers  may  submit  specific  proposals  for \ntargeted beneficiaries subject to ProSC-approved guidelines. \n \n27.  Nepal\u2019s conflict situation and complex social structure  present risks to  implementing \ncommunity-based training programs. In this connection, this subcomponent will adopt a phased \napproach. Implementation in the first year will be initiated in five districts: Achham, Dhanusha, \nHumla, Kapilbastu, and Panchthar. At the end of the first year,  project experience with the \ncriteria,  implementation  procedures,  and  approaches,  focusing  on  the  TNA,  beneficiary \nselection, and stipends, will be assessed and refinements will be made as necessary. In the \nsecond year, five more districts will be added; the ProSC will identify these during the first year. \nThis project component will be progressively implemented in the remaining districts during \nproject implementation. \n \n2.  Capacity Strengthening  \n \na.  Strengthening Key Agencies to Serve the TEVT Subsector \n \n28.  Key government agencies have the potential to improve their service to the TEVT \nsubsector, particularly for MOST skills training. Framework mechanisms and services, such as \ncoordination and facilitation, planning, labor market information analysis, skills standards, and ", "8  \naccreditation,  will  need  to  be  in  place  to  facilitate  skills  training,  particularly  for  MOST.  \nWhile  these  mechanisms  exist,  they  are  neither  adequate  nor  accessed  by  many  TEVT \nproviders. \n \n29.  Strengthening CTEVT in  Planning, Coordination, and  Facilitation. CTEVT will be \nstrengthened to coordinate, facilitate, and undertake planning in the subsector. To aid the \nanalyses of available resources and gaps vis-\u00e0-vis the needs in specific geographic areas,  \nthe Project will develop and implement a geographic information system (GIS) to map public \nand private training institutions and resources throughout the country. The Project will provide \nconsulting services, equipment, software and materials, incremental recurrent costs for data \ncollection, publication costs, and refurbishment of the  GIS office. To assist training program \nmonitoring  and  assessment  and  to  help  employers  identify  trained  potential  employees,  \na training management information system (TMIS) will be developed and installed at CTEVT, \nCSIDB, DCSI,  DOLEP, public training institutions, CTEVT-affiliated institutions, and training \nproviders of the Project. Data collected by the TMIS will include GCE statistics. The Project will \nprovide consulting services, equipment, software and materials, incremental recurrent costs for \ndata collection, and publication costs. Staff of recipient institutions of  GIS and TMIS  will be \ntrained in data collection, data manipulation, database maintenance, and utilization of this \ninformation for planning and research, as appropriate. \n \n30.  To assist subsector planning and the development and delivery of MOST training, \nCTEVT personnel will receive training in labor market information analysis. The Project will also \nprovide  resources  for  workshops,  reference  materials,  and  data  to  produce  labor  market \nanalysis papers in four sectors. To prepare (i) a minimum of four  discussion papers analyzing \nvarious  mechanisms  employed  by  public  and  private  training  providers  in  designing  and \ndelivering short-term training, (ii) four tracer studies for the Project, and (iii) annual progress \nreports of the TEVT subsector, CTEVT will receive support for workshops, reference materials, \ndata, and publication. CTEVT will also receive staff development  for planning, research and \nanalysis, TNA, and networking to serve training providers; computing and  office equipment; \nincremental recurrent cost for data collection; and support for dissemination through seminars \nand publication.  \n \n31.  The  Project  will  support  the  review  and  refinement  of  the  current  skills  level  and \nqualifications  equivalence  into  a  training  qualifications  framework,  including  for  short-term \ntraining. The Project will provide for the services of a training qualifications framework specialist, \nworkshops, reference materials, publications, and incremental recurrent costs. The Project will \nprovide CTEVT resources to annually review and refine, as necessary, the skills standards, \ntraining standards,  and curricula  of at least 20 MOST training programs in consultation with \nstakeholders,  including  CSIDB,  DCSI,  DOLEP,  professional/crafts  associations,  employer \ngroups, and recruitment agencies. For 20 new short-term training programs in skill areas with no \nstandards, CTEVT will  develop competency-based skills and training standards and sample \ncurricula. These will reflect a change in focus from curricula based on job analyses to those \nbased on skills standards. CTEVT will maintain a library of training curricula; a copy of all \ndeveloped curricula will be provided to CTEVT  to be  used as references by other training \nproviders, public and private, and for monitoring purposes. The Project will support  annual \nnational workshops on curriculum development and skills standards for short-term training \nprograms, and training workshops on new or revised skills and training standards and short-\nterm  training  programs.  The  Project  will  provide  support  to  procure  sample  curricula, \ncompetency-based skills standards, and curriculum development packages, consulting services, \nworkshops, staff development, office equipment, reference materials, and incremental recurrent \ncosts. \n ", "               9       \n32.  The Project will support the review, adjustment, and dissemination of the accreditation \nprocess at CTEVT. An accreditation specialist will review the accreditation process for greater \ntransparency and incorporation of skills and training standards, including for short-term training \nprograms. Adjustments will be recommended to current procedures and requirements, including \nminimum standards for training facilities and employed trainers. Staff will be trained to carry out \nthese new procedures. Information on the accreditation procedure will be disseminated through \nworkshops, the media, and the Internet. Throughout implementation,  the Project will provide \nsupport  for  seminars  and  workshops,  reference  materials,  publications,  information \ndissemination, incremental recurrent costs, and refurbishment of the accreditation office to \nimplement the accreditation process for a minimum of 40 MOST programs.  \n \n33.  Strengthening  DOLEP  in  Labor Market  Information  Systems  and  Employment \nServices. DOLEP will be strengthened in labor market information, employment services, and \nloan schemes for workers for international employment. A labor market information specialist \nwill be supported by the Project to assess the status of the labor market information system and \nthe status of activities to disseminate and analyze  labor market information. The Project will \nsupport data collection, computing equipment, staff development, the publication of semi-annual \nlabor market reports, and the development of a website to increase access to up-to-date labor \nmarket  information.  The  Project  will  support,  through  an  employment  services  specialist,  \nthe preparation of an action plan for establishing employment service centers to serve as one-\nstop shops for a variety of advice and services, including information on training, employment \nopportunities in the formal and informal sectors, job applications, and establishing a business. \nThe Project will support pilot activities to develop three functioning employment service centers \nin Kathmandu and two  large urban areas. Staff development, statistical software, office and \ncomputing equipment, and repair and refurbishment will be provided as necessary. The Project \nwill support the preparation and printing of brochures with departure information for international \nemployment in  various countries. The Project will also provide consulting services to review \nongoing  loan  schemes  for  trainees  and  workers  for  international  employment,  and  make \nrecommendations for sustainability and targeting.  \n \n34.  Strengthening  DCSI  and  CSIDB  to  Better Serve  Communities  and  Economic \nGroups. As the Government office that deals with skills training and is present in all districts, \nDCSI and CSIDB will be strengthened in their liaison and facilitation roles. Staff in all districts \nwill receive training to improve TNA, market needs analysis, targeting of disadvantaged groups, \nand provision of useful posttraining information and services. Training will include a  GCE \nsensitization module. DCSI and CSIDB staff will prepare strategic plans for their districts, and \nidentify  their  requirements  for  repair, refurbishment, and office equipment. The Project will \nprovide staff development, training materials, refurbishment, and office equipment to the skills \ntraining section. \n \nb.  Strengthening Short-Term Skills Training Provision \n \n35.  This component will strengthen the capacity of training providers, public and private, to \nmeet the requirements of a national TEVT policy. The shift to market-oriented quality training \nwill require many training providers to transform their practices. All training packages for staff of \ntraining providers will include a GCE module. The facilities of selected public training institutions \nwill be strengthened as necessary.  \n \n36.  Training the Personnel of Training Providers. Through the Project, training providers \nwill receive training in the management of education and training institutions, leadership in \neducation,  and  instructional  skills  supporting  the  TEVT  policy  and  training  frameworks.  \nThe Project will prepare a training plan and develop three training packages. The first training ", "10  \npackage will be for managers of training providers and will include training in working with \ncommunities  to  identify  needs  and  opportunities,  beneficiary  targeting,  and  partnership \narrangements; and develop posttraining services. The second training package will be for \ntraining supervisory staff and will include TNA; participatory  approaches; and overviews of \ntrainer training, skills testing, training for entrepreneurship, student selection and targeting \napproaches, and curriculum and materials development. To ensure staff availability to train new \ntraining staff, selected instructors will also receive this package. The third package is for full-\ntime and part-time instructors, working under the direction of other staff and will be in vocational \neducation pedagogy, training delivery approaches, and occupational skills. Where appropriate, \ntraining of trainers in the content of developed/refined short-term skills training programs will be \nundertaken three times annually in various parts of the country. An estimated 200 managers, \n200 training/education supervisors, and 1,000  trainers/instructors will be trained using these \npackages. \n \n37.  Strengthening Selected Public Training Providers. Based on criteria, including need \nand  location,  to  be  developed  by  the  ProSC,  selected  public  training  providers  will  be \nstrengthened. Public training providers will be requested to submit proposals for strengthening \ntheir respective institutions. Selected proposals will demonstrate, among others, a clear linkage \nto the delivery of MOST skills training and the inadequacy of current equipment and facilities. \nProject support will be extended, as appropriate, for (i) repair and refurbishment of nonrented \nfacilities; (ii) staff development; (iii) curriculum development; (iv) consulting services for training \nprogram development; (v) equipment, instructional, and training materials and supplies; and  \n(vi) incremental recurrent cost of utilities, marketing, and promotion.  New civil works will be \nsupported when they are absolutely essential, but will require prior  Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) approval and must comply with environmental and resettlement safeguards. Evaluators \nwill conduct site evaluations and appraise the proposals. The ProSC will approve the proposals \nto be supported on the recommendation of a project implementation unit (PIU) working group.  \n  \n3.   Supporting Policy Development, Articulation, and Implementation \n \n38.  Aimed at coordinating activities in the TEVT subsector with a common purpose and \ncomparable outcomes and increased relevance and efficiency, the Project will support drafting \nand articulating a new TEVT policy by developing action plans and implementation plans and \nconsulting widely with stakeholders. The Project will provide consulting services and support for \nmeetings, materials, and seminars and workshops. The Government will adopt the TEVT policy \nwithin 1 year of loan effectiveness.  \n \n39.  The Project will review the roles, mandates, responsibilities, and ongoing activities of \ngovernment TEVT stakeholders, including central agencies and training providers, to develop \noptions for a coordinated public TEVT subsector. The options will consider, among others,  \na  redistribution,  consolidation,  and/or  separation  of  mandates  in  the  context  of  efficiency, \ngovernance, and the Government\u2019s vision of decentralization. A recommendation will be made \nand a time-bound implementation plan will be developed. The Project will support the review \nand  feasibility  assessment  of  mechanisms  to  increase  the  financial  sustainability  of  the \nsubsector;  and  increase  the  efficiency,  equity,  and  market-orientation of training budgets \nallocated in the  government and semi-government sector. These mechanisms include the \nestablishment of a skills development fund, performance-based budgeting, levy/grant scheme, \nother nontraditional sources of funds, and granting full or partial autonomy to public training \ninstitutions. After the adoption of  mechanisms for sustainable and efficient TEVT subsector \nfinancing,  the  Project  will  support  the  development  of  an  action  plan  and  initiate  its \nimplementation. The development of financing mechanisms will include a wide consultation of \nstakeholders and be guided by the Policy Coordination Committee (PCC) and Policy Steering ", "             1  1       \nCommittee (PoSC). The Project will provide consulting services and support for meetings, \nmaterials, and seminars and workshops. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n40.  The  present  conflict  situation  is  partly  due  to  poverty;  unemployment  and \nunderemployment; and lack of economic opportunities for the poor and the disadvantaged. \nParticularly for the unemployed and underemployed, skills needed to secure jobs or generate \nincomes are lacking. The Project supports providing the unemployed and underemployed with \nmore market-oriented training in skills areas needed by the domestic and  international labor \nmarkets. Training programs to be supported are short-term and are thus accessible to more \ntrainees, especially those with less than SLC qualifications. Training for international jobs will \ninclude positions that would employ more women. Community-based training will be accessible \nto the less educated and located locally where appropriate and feasible. In addition, upgrading \nfacilities  in  public  training  institutions  to  make  them  more  accessible  to  women  and  the \nhandicapped is eligible for project support.  \n \n41.  The Project adopts a strategy that addresses GCE (Appendix  4). Target groups to \nreceive subsidized training and posttraining services will be the poor and include overall project \ntarget group quotas. At least 60% of all trainees in project-supported MOST training programs \nwill be women, Dalits, or disadvantaged. At the same time, at least 50% of all trainees will be \nwomen and at least 25% Dalits. Training packages for staff of training providers will include a \nmodule on building awareness of GCE and social inclusion issues. The Project will maintain a \nGCE-disaggregated TMIS data.  \n \n42.  In view of the implementation difficulties posed by the conflict situation, the Project \nadopts  a  phased  approach  in  expanding  to  different  districts.  Implementation  of  training \nprograms will commence in five districts in the first year. Experiences and results of Project \nimplementation will be reviewed at the end of the first year, with emphasis on the mechanisms \nto increase access to MOST skills training. Implementation will be refined as necessary before \nProject implementation is expanded to more districts in subsequent years. \n \n43.  Training  programs  to  be  offered  under  the  Project  will  be  market-oriented.  \nFor  international  and  formal  employment,  employers,  manpower  agencies,11 and relevant \nGovernment  stakeholders  will  together  identify  the  areas  of  training  demand.  Local  and \ninternational NGOs and various community groups, in cooperation with economic groups in the \ncommunity and its immediate vicinity, will identify income-generating opportunities that can be \nprofited from with appropriate training provision. \n \n44.  The project design includes the participation of the private sector during implementation. \nThe PCC and  ProSC include representatives of the various TEVT stakeholders, including \nemployers and manpower agencies. The private sector will be represented in the development \nof training standards and curricula, and in identifying needed skills training. Relevant personnel \nof private training providers will receive training through the Project. Delivery of training under \ncomponent 1 is not limited to public training providers, but is open to both public and private \ntraining providers through contracting arrangements. Capacity building activities and contracting \nof training programs to private providers will contribute to the development of a private training \nmarket. \n \n                                                 \n11 Recruitment agencies for international employment are called \u201cmanpower agencies\u201d in Nepal. ", "12  \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n45.  The total cost of the Project, including physical and price contingencies, and taxes and \nduties, is estimated at $25.0 million equivalent. Of this amount, $2.3 million equivalent, or 9% of \nthe total cost, is the foreign exchange cost, and $22.7 million equivalent, or 91% of the total \ncost, is the local currency cost.

It is proposed that  ADB \nprovides a loan of $20.0 million in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights \n13,615,000 from its Special Funds resources to finance 80% of the project costs. This covers \n$2.3 million equivalent of the foreign exchange cost and $17.7 million equivalent of the local \ncurrency cost. ADB financing will be used to finance a portion of the costs relating to civil works, \nprocurement of equipment, training resources, training, consulting services, and research, but \nwill exclude salaries of regular government staff, rental of office space, and taxes and duties. \nThe term of the proposed loan will be 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an \ninterest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter.  \nThe indicative financing plan is presented in Table 2. \n \n \n ", "             1  3       \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nForeign  Local  Total \nSource  Percent \nExchange  Currency  Cost \n         \nAsian Development Bank   2.3    17.7    20.0    80  \nGovernment  0.0   5.0    5.0    20  \nTotal   2.3    22.7    25.0    100  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \nF.   Implementation Arrangements  \n \n1.    Project Management \n \n47.  The Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES) will be the Executing Agency, CTEVT the \nImplementing Agency.  \n \n48.  A ProSC will be established, chaired by the secretary of  MOES; CTEVT will be  the \nSecretariat.  ProSC  membership  will  comprise  representatives  from  Ministry  of  Finance;  \nMinistry of Industries, Commerce and Supplies; Ministry of Labor and Transport Management; \nMinistry  of  Local  Development;  National  Planning  Commission;  development  partners,  \nas appropriate; and Federation of National Chambers of Commerce and Industry. There will \nalso be two representatives from participating districts on a rotating basis, four members from \ncivil  society  broadly  representing  the  target  groups  and  their  concerns,  one  member \nrepresenting the concerns of manpower agencies, and one member representing the concerns \nof private training providers. At least three members will be women and at least two members \nwill be Dalits. ADB will participate as observer. Other members may be co-opted as necessary. \nChanges in membership will be subject to ADB approval.  \n \n49.  The ProSC will (i) approve the initial and revised criteria and procedures to (a) allocate \nproject funds for training delivery, (b) select districts for project implementation, (c) select public \ntraining institutions to be strengthened and upgraded, (d) select training providers to deliver \nMOST skills training, (e) select NGOs and CBOs, and (f) select project beneficiaries of training; \n(ii) allocate the project funds for training delivery; and (iii) decide on the districts to which the \nProject is to be expanded. The criteria, resource allocations, and district selection will be subject \nto ADB approval. Indicative criteria for project implementation are in Appendix 6. The ProSC will \nadvise  the  project  manager  of  concerns  and  issues  related  to  all  aspects  of  project \nimplementation, and facilitate coordination between ministries and agencies. In the first 2 years \nof project implementation, the ProSC will meet at least once every quarter. After that, the ProSC \nwill meet as necessary, but not less than twice a year.  \n \n50.  A PIU will be established in CTEVT. The PIU will be headed by a Project Director; day-\nto-day management will be by a full-time Project Manager. The PIU will be responsible for the \nadministration of all project activities. The PIU will comprise a project administration section and \na training secretariat. The PIU staff will include a monitoring and evaluation officer. Focal people \nin  the  implementing  agencies  will  be  appointed.  Working  groups  will  be  organized,  \nas necessary, to coordinate and guide the implementation of project subcomponents and \nactivities, particularly components 1(B) and 1(C). Members of working groups will as agreed \nbetween CTEVT and ADB. The PIU will establish a grievance redressal mechanism for project-\nrelated activities within 6 months of loan effectiveness.   \n ", "14  \n51.  Community-based training will be implemented in the districts  through the DCSI and \nCSIDB district offices. The DCSI/CSIDB district office shall report to the Project Manager.  \nA district steering committee will be established and  comprise the  chairman of the district \ndevelopment committee, local development officer, the district education officer, representative \nof CTEVT training schools, a representative of the local chamber of commerce, employers, \nNGOs, CBOs, and three representatives from the target groups. Other members may be co-\nopted as necessary. The DCSI/CSIDB shall act as the member-secretary. The district steering \ncommittee shall prioritize and approve training programs proposed for communities. \n \n52.  For the policy development and articulation component, the existing committees and \ngroups, namely, the PCC, PoSC, and Core Working Group will continue their respective roles. \nThe  PCC  shall  provide  coordination  and  multi-sectoral  inputs  on  policy  development  and \narticulation in the TEVT sub-sector. PCC members will represent the same stakeholders and \ninterests as the ProSC. The PoSC will provide advice and guidance to the articulation process. \nThe Core Working Group will continue to develop and articulate policy. Appropriate experts and \nstakeholders will join the group as required. \n \n  2.    Implementation Period \n \n53.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years  beginning  2005  and  ending  2011.  \nThe overall project implementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n \n  3.   Procurement  \n \n54.  The  procurement  of  goods  and  services  financed  by  ADB  will  be  undertaken  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and  the  Government\u2019s  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. Since any civil works will be small and widely dispersed, foreign contractors \nare unlikely to be interested in bidding. Consequently, all the civil works contracts will be \nprocured on the basis of local competitive bidding among prequalified contractors in accordance \nwith the Government\u2019s procurement procedures acceptable to ADB. Prequalification, selection, \nand engagement of contractors will be subject to ADB approval. The procurement of goods will \nbe grouped into packages larger than $500,000 to be suitable for international competitive \nbidding. Miscellaneous minor goods that cannot be grouped into large contracts and cost less \nthan $500,000 per contract will be procured through international shopping. Direct purchase \nmay be used for minor items, costing less than $100,000 equivalent per contract. Appendix 8 \ngives the indicative procurement packages. \n \n  4.   Consulting Services \n \n55.  The selection and engagement of all consulting services to be financed under the \nProject will be in accordance with quality- and cost-based selection under ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of \ninternational and domestic consultants. A team of consultants to provide services in a range of \nspecialties with estimated international inputs of 21 person-months and domestic inputs of  \n66 person-months is planned. These services will be provided by individual consultants and \nconsulting firms, and will be selected according to ADB guidelines. These do not include \nservices from NGOs in the districts to undertake training needs analysis, beneficiary mapping, \nand identification of trainees. In districts and communities, where the conflict situation warrants \nit, NGOs may be directly selected based on a set of minimum criteria. Appendix 9 summarizes \nthe consulting requirements. \n \n ", "             1  5       \n  5.    Disbursement Arrangements \n \n56.  CTEVT  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  disbursement  projections and  MOES  for \nrequesting budgetary allocations for counterpart funds. Immediately after loan effectiveness, \nCTEVT will establish an imprest account for the Project at Nepal Rastra Bank. The initial \namount will be no more than a 6-month projected disbursement or 10% of the total loan amount, \nwhichever  is  less.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, and detailed arrangements agreed to by \nthe  Government  and  ADB.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure  procedures  may  be  used  to \nreimburse eligible expenditures and to liquidate advances made into the imprest account in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s loan disbursement guidelines. Any individual payment to be reimbursed \nor liquidated under the statement of expenditure procedure will not exceed the equivalent of \n$50,000. CTEVT will coordinate the timely release of funds. Auditors acceptable to ADB will \naudit the use of the imprest account and statement of expenditure procedures. A separate audit \nopinion should be included in the annual audit report. \n \n  6.   Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n57.  MOES, with assistance from CTEVT and the district offices, will maintain records and \naccounts adequate to identify goods and services financed out of the loan proceeds. MOES will \n(i) maintain separate accounts for the Project; (ii) ensure accounts and financial statements are \naudited annually, in accordance with sound accounting principles by auditors acceptable to \nADB; and (iii)  provide to ADB, not later than 9 months after the close of each fiscal year, \ncertified copies of audited accounts and financial statements, and the report of the auditor on \nthese. CTEVT will submit progress  reports every  4 months. The reports will be in a format \nacceptable to ADB, and will include (i) progress made against established targets, including \naspects of quality; (ii) delays and problems encountered, and actions taken to resolve issues; \n(iii) compliance with loan covenants; (iv) proposed program of activities to be undertaken during \nthe next 4 months; and (v) expected progress during the succeeding period. Within 3 months of \nphysical completion of the Project, the Government will prepare and submit to ADB a project \ncompletion report on the execution of the Project including the costs and compliance with loan \ncovenants. \n \n  7.   Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n58.  In accordance with ADB\u2019s  Project  Performance  Management  System  Handbook,  a \nshortlist of verifiable indicators for monitoring and evaluation was prepared.  The Project will \nrecruit a monitoring and evaluation specialist to identify and select verifiable indicators. Within 4 \nmonths  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  PIU  will  have  collected  the  baseline  information  and  \nsubmitted a detailed project implementation monitoring plan for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence. \nProject performance management system activities will be conducted periodically to gather \ninformation from multiple sources to determine whether the inputs for implementing program \nactivities  have  rendered  expected  benefits  to  the  intended  beneficiaries.  The  Project  will \ndevelop and implement a TMIS to collect trainee information, including on GCE. The PIU will \nsubmit annual benefit monitoring reports to  ADB. The  project performance monitoring also \nseeks to detect any deficiency and discrepancy between the plan and the execution of a \nprogram using resources efficiently so that timely corrections can be made to update the Project \nand thus improve the benefits, outcomes, and impact. The project performance management \nsystem will utilize information from the annual and semiannual reviews, midterm review, periodic \nevaluations and studies, and employer and trainee feedback. CTEVT will conduct four tracer \nstudies.  \n ", "16  \n  8.   Project Review \n \n59.  ADB will conduct detailed reviews of the Project at least  three times a year before \nProject midterm, and at least two times a year thereafter. The reviews will cover physical \nprogress on project implementation, financial performance, implementation of GCE strategy, \nprogress of Project activities, and identification of problems and suggestion of solutions thereof. \nA comprehensive midterm review will also be conducted jointly by the Government and ADB at \nthe end of the third year of Project implementation. Taking cognizance of the process approach \nadopted to monitor performance, the midterm review will (i) evaluate the project scope, design, \nimplementation arrangements, and institutional processes; (ii) evaluate the effectiveness of the \npilot  employment  service  centers;  (iii)  review  the  progress  made  toward  developing  a \nsustainable TEVT financing mechanisms; (iv) review in detail the level of implementation of the \nGCE strategy; (v) assess implementation performance against performance indicators; (vi) \nreview compliance with loan covenants; (vii) identify critical issues and constraints, if any; and \n(viii) if necessary, identify and recommend changes needed in any (or all) of these areas. In \naddition, CTEVT and ADB will jointly review the Project at the end of the first year of Project \nimplementation.  The  first-year  review  will  assess  the  experiences  and  results  of  project \nimplementation with emphasis on reviewing the effectiveness of the mechanisms utilized to \nincrease access to MOST skills training, including in light of policy developments. Refinements \non the various procedures, criteria, and mechanisms will be made as necessary.  \n \n \nIV .  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS  \n \nA.  Project Benefits and Impact  \n \n60.  The  Project  supports  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  reduce  poverty  and  redress  factors \nsustaining the conflict. The main project benefits include more skilled Nepalese who can gain \nemployment  locally  and  abroad,  more  Nepalese given the opportunity  for  self-employment \nthrough skills training, increased market-relevance and improved quality of short-term training \nprograms,  and  increased  in-country  capacity  to  develop  and  deliver  MOST  skills  training.  \nThe direct beneficiaries of the Project will be the unemployed and underemployed who would \nlike to gain skills for employment and income generation, particularly women, Dalits, and the \ndisadvantaged; various ministries supporting short-term training and CTEVT; and public and \nprivate training providers. \n \n61.  Social Benefits. The Project supports national efforts to reduce poverty  and provide \nstability, especially in the context of the current conflict. The Project aims to improve access to \nemployment  or  self-employment  for  women,  socially  excluded  Dalits,  and  disadvantaged \ngroups, as well as poor socioeconomic groups in general. The Project targets to have women, \nDalits,  and  members  of  disadvantaged  groups  make  up  at  least  60%  of  the  trainee \nbeneficiaries,  while  ensuring  that  at  least  50%  are  women  and  at  least  25%  are  Dalits.  \nIn community-based training, associations of disadvantaged groups, Dalits, NGOs, and CBOs \nwill be consulted to identify potential beneficiaries in their communities and constituencies. In \ntraining leading to self-employment, trainees will be provided linkages to available posttraining \nservices,  e.g.,  microfinance,  marketing  groups,  and  employers.  This  targeting  by  social \ngrouping, as well as awareness-raising of gender equity and social inclusion issues among \ninstitutions, is expected to contribute to conflict resolution efforts, by addressing some of the \nprimary root causes\u2014poverty and social exclusion.  \n \n62.  The Project is aimed at increasing access to market-oriented training with a view to \nincreasing participation of trainees in formal and foreign employment and self-employment ", "             1  7       \nactivities. For foreign employment, the focus is on delivering short-term training for semiskilled \nand skilled occupations, as well as increasing awareness and access to information on foreign \nemployment. The focus on short-term training implies that the required qualifications for training \nprograms will be less than SLC pass, and, in many instances, will require only basic literacy and \nnumeracy. By increasing the capacity in-country for expanded short-term training provision and \nsupporting  increased  access  to  short-term  training  programs  through  the  Project,  \nthe unemployed and underemployed, particularly women, Dalits, and  disadvantaged groups,  \nwill have a greater opportunity to increase their incomes. \n \n63.  Economic  Benefits. With  improvements  in  relevance  and  quality  of  skills  training \nprograms, and increasing access to short-term training programs,  the Project will generate \nincreases in labor productivity that will increase the competitiveness of Nepalese locally and \nabroad. This should increase their probability of employment, decrease the job search time, and \nincrease offered wages.  The involvement of various line ministries, the private sector, and \nmanpower agencies in determining the human resource needs in selected sectors and in \ndeveloping needed training programs will yield higher quality labor market information and more \nappropriate training programs. The coordination efforts among these various stakeholders will \nimprove the matching of labor supply with labor demand, especially for international work.  \nAs some training will be oriented toward international work, remittances from employed trainees \nwould contribute not only to national income, but also to reducing pressures on the balance of \npayment. Increased incomes from employment also have economywide multiplier effects as \nthese are spent on consumption goods, house construction, and education, among others. \nThrough  the  Project,  about  80,000  trainees,  including  women,  Dalits,  and  disadvantaged \ngroups, will receive market-oriented and community-based skills training. Under the assumption \nthat 60% will find international or local employment, or engage in self-employment, the project \ninvestment would be economically justified with an economic internal rate of return of 28% \n(Appendix 10). \n \n64.  Institutional Benefits.  Through a  national TEVT policy based on wide consultation, \nfragmentation and duplication of training activities will be reduced as a result of nationally \nagreed coordination mechanisms allocating clear-cut roles, responsibilities, and jurisdictions to \ntraining providers. The Project will refine skills standards and training standards for short-term \ntraining delivery that will contribute to a coordinated approach in its management and delivery \nfor all stakeholders, with less diversity in duration and content of training programs. This will \nincrease the capacities of training providers and community organizations to engage in effective \nskills formation and  achieve employment outcomes. A revised accreditation system will also \ncontribute to ensuring that the various training providers adhere to the standards.  \n \n65.  Through the Project, CTEVT\u2019s capacity to coordinate across ministerial lines and with \nemployers, to  serve the TEVT sector, and  to provide quality assurance will be enhanced. \nCTEVT would thus be able to offer  a package of services and products to both public and \nprivate training providers to support their delivery of skills training that meets market needs and \nquality standards. Training providers will have greater access to materials developed at CTEVT \nthat should contribute to enhancing the credibility of their programs. The Project will strengthen \nthe capacity of training providers to deliver skills training that  is market-oriented and more \nrelevant to the needs of the industry, employer, and community. With this, training participants \nwill more likely find employment  or  enter self-employment. Other government  and private \ntraining providers' capacity to offer more short-term training programs will be enhanced through \ncapacity  strengthening;  selected  government  training  providers  will  receive  assistance  to \nrefurbish their facilities. With capacity-building activities extended to staff of private providers \nand contracting of project training activities open to private providers, the Project will stimulate \ndevelopment of the private training market.   ", "18  \n \nB.  Project Assumptions and Risks \n \n66.  Security Situation. The conflict situation and armed insurgency in the country represent \nmajor risks to achieving the Project\u2019s development goals. The Project\u2019s ability to identify and \ndeliver training in communities could be  hindered by disruptions caused by the insurgency \nsituation. The project design  incorporates lessons learned from implementation in Nepal\u2019s \nconflict  areas  (Appendix  11).  The  Project  emphasizes  local  participation  in  TNAs, in the \norganization of training activities, and the use of NGOs or CBOs in the communities. Women, \nDalits, and disadvantaged groups are targeted to comprise at least 60% of training beneficiaries \nin communities. District officials will be given training in liaising with communities to increase \ntheir  responsiveness  to  communities\u2019  needs.  Implementation  will  also  be  phased;  lessons \nlearned during implementation of skills training activities in the first year will contribute to fine-\ntuning implementation arrangements, procedures, and criteria to better achieve project goals.  \n \n67.  Coordination.  The  Project  supports  the  development,  articulation,  and  initiation  of \nimplementation of a new TEVT policy.  The establishment of a  new national TEVT policy to \nunderpin coordination and quality improvements across the whole subsector depends on the \ncommitment of government providers of skills development training. There is the risk that line \nministries\u2019 commitment to  a coordinated approach to  skills training would waiver. Under the \nProject, through their representation in the Core Working Group, PCC, and PoSC, and regular \nmeetings of these groups, cooperation and coordination of activities through the Project will be \nencouraged. The Project supports a wide stakeholder consultation in the articulation of the new \nTEVT policy. CTEVT\u2019s capacity to more effectively undertake policy development and provide \ncoordination and facilitation in the subsector will be strengthened through the Project. CTEVT\u2019s \ncoordination and accreditation role, and administration of training delivery may present a conflict \nof interest. However, CTEVT is presently moving toward a greater facilitation and coordination \nrole. Its draft 5-year plan proposes granting autonomy to selected CTEVT training institutions. \nThe new TEVT policy will also directly address this issue.  \n \n68.  Participation of Private Training Providers. The Project aims to improve the quality of \nshort-term training not only among public training providers, but also among private providers, \nby providing training to trainers, education managers, and senior staff. To boost the attendance \nof participants from private providers, the Project will publicize the training among the providers. \nIn addition, the training will be implemented across the country, bringing it closer to prospective \nparticipants. Quality benchmarks established  through the  framework may drive up costs of \ntraining delivery such that training providers may opt  not to seek accreditation and quality \nremains  low.  The  representation  of  multiple  stakeholders  on  the  various  committees  and \nworking groups of the Project is one measure that will mitigate this risk, as will broad community \nand industry consultation in the development of the TEVT standards. Capacity-building activities \nwill aid providers in meeting standards. In addition, project monitoring data will help identify the \nbenefits of compliance and be disseminated to providers and trainees alike. \n \n69.  Posttraining Services. The success of the Project in meeting its goal depends on the \nincreased ability of  training recipients to enter employment or self-employment, or generate \nincome as a result of skills training. Posttraining services, however, such as microfinance and \nproduct marketers, may not be available. To minimize this, TNAs will take into consideration \nlocal economic opportunities. The  Project will also  build the  capacity of training providers to \nidentify posttraining support services, including linking with employers, marketers, NGOs, and \nother CBOs.  \n ", "             1  9       \n70.  Safeguards. The Project\u2019s environmental impacts were reviewed, and no significant \nadverse impacts were identified. However, environmental considerations will be incorporated to \navoid significant environmental impacts during refurbishment of training institutions and in the \ndisposal of training materials. The Project includes no new construction and is unlikely to trigger \nADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy. Also, the Project is unlikely to have adverse impact on \nindigenous peoples; project benefits should accrue to them. The summary poverty reduction \nand social strategy is in Appendix 12. \n \n \nV.    ASSURANCES  \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n71.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n(i)  Within 1 year of loan effectiveness, the  Cabinet will have approved the TEVT \npolicy. \n(ii)  The detailed implementations plans of prioritized sections of the TEVT policy, as \nagreed  upon  by  CTEVT  and  ADB,  will  be  finalized  within  2  years  of  loan \neffectiveness. \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that the membership of the ProSC is as indicated in \nthe project description and that the ProSC meets at least four times a year. \n(iv)  The Government will ensure that the PCC under component 3 includes members \nthat represent the same stakeholders and interests as the ProSC. All necessary \nand appropriate measures will be taken to ensure that at least five members are \nfemale and at least three members are from the Dalit community.  \n(v)  Districts to be added for implementation will be selected according to criteria to \nbe developed during the first year of implementation and approved by the ProSC \nand ADB. The criteria will include measures of poverty and deprivation. \n(vi)  Project  funds  for  the  development  and  delivery  of  training  programs  under \ncomponent 1 will be allocated in accordance with criteria agreed upon with ADB \nwithin 3 months of loan effectiveness. \n(vii)  The Government will take all necessary and appropriate measures to ensure that \nat least 60% of trainees are women, Dalits, or disadvantaged; while ensuring at \nthe same time that 50% of all trainees are women and 25% are Dalits. \n(viii)  In selecting local NGOs and CBOs for implementing activities under the Project, \npriority will be given to NGOs and CBOs with experience in working with Dalits \nand  disadvantaged groups  and  in  accordance  with  criteria  agreed  upon  by \nCTEVT and ADB. \n(ix)  The Government will ensure the adoption and full implementation of the GCE \nplan  by  all  stakeholders  and  implementing  partners.  Implementation  will  be \nclosely monitored throughout project implementation. \n(x)  CTEVT will ensure that in modifying the short-term skills training programs, \nrelevant life skills and entrepreneurship skills are included. \n(xi)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  pilot  employment  services  centers  are \nadequately staffed with staff dedicated to that function only. \n(xii)  The Government will ensure that no new construction will take place. Minor civil \nworks will only be to upgrade and/or refurbish existing facilities; will follow ADB\u2019s \nguidelines on environment and resettlement; and will be based on need and \nlocation, in accordance with criteria to be developed by the PIU and approved by \nthe  ProSC  and  ADB  within  the  first  3  months  of  project  implementation. ", "20  \nFinancing of refurbishment and upgrading will be subject to the public training \ninstitution preparing a maintenance plan, including costs, for the next 3 years. \nHowever, when absolutely essential, new civil works will be supported but will \nrequire  prior  ADB  approval  and  must  comply  with  environmental  and \nresettlement safeguards. \n(xiii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  institutions  and  training  providers  observe \nregulations relating to occupational safety and health, and the proper collection, \nsegregation, storage, treatment, and disposal of waste from minor civil works \nactivities and conduct of training programs, particularly  where hazardous and \ntoxic waste materials are used. \n(xiv)  The Government will ensure that sufficient budget allocations are made to cover \nrecurrent costs needed for effective project implementation. \n \nB.   Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n \n72.  The following conditions will be met by the Government before the loan becomes \neffective: \n \n(i)  The PIU will be established with the Project Director and all other staff in place. \n(ii)  The ProSC will be established and members notified. \n \n \nVI.

The technical education and vocational training (TEVT) sector can be broadly described \nas training for specific occupational areas below the bachelor degree level. In Nepal, a further \ndistinction is made between technical education and vocational training. Technical education \nconsists of training for the nationally recognized qualifications of diploma and technical school \nleaving certificate (TSLC). Technical education programs are between 2 and 3 years long, are \nstrongly linked to general education qualifications, and constitute an alternative pathway to \nuniversity. Vocational training programs are generally less than 6 months in duration and give \ntrainees skills to earn an income. The TEVT subsector comprises both government and private \ntraining providers. Some are entirely focused on vocational training or technical education, while \nothers offer both. The overall capacity is small at about 50,000 training places per year. Limited \nopportunities  for  places  in  government  institutions  have  led  to  the  expansion  of  private \ninstitutions, including those operated by nongovernment organizations.  \n \n2.   TEVT  is  largely  fragmented  in  Nepal.  No  national  policy  has been adopted by the \nsubsector as a whole. Different providers follow their own curricula and even their own skills \nstandards. Nonetheless, an apex body, the  Council for Technical Education and Vocational \nTraining (CTEVT), exists. Primarily, however, the role of CTEVT has been to monitor the quality \nof private training providers especially for TSLC programs. CTEVT has been unable to provide \nan integrating role over the whole system of TEVT provision.  \n \n3.   Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training. CTEVT was created in \n1989 through the Technical Education and Vocational Training Act, 1989 (amended in 1993). \nCTEVT is both a national coordinating body for TEVT as well as the major provider of TEVT. \nThe  expansion  in  the  number  of  training  institutions  under  its  administration,  however,  \nhas resulted in it focusing on training delivery rather than on its role as an apex organization.  \nA refocus to a facilitating role for the TEVT subsector has recently emerged consistent with \ndirections generally provided in the Tenth Plan. CTEVT has adopted a 5-year strategic plan \n(2003\u20132008) that attempts to shift its focus from delivery of training, to guiding, facilitating, and \nregulating training.  \n \n4.  CTEVT  Training  Institutions.  Presently,  four  different  kinds  of  institutions  operate \nwithin CTEVT. These are the Training Institute for Technical Instruction, polytechnic institutes, \nvocational training and community development institutions, and technical schools. In addition, \nannex programs of CTEVT are in some secondary schools.  \n  \n5.  The Training Institute for Technical Instruction provides training to CTEVT institutions, \ngovernment agencies, and private institutions for technical instructors, institution managers, and \noccupational curriculum development specialists through regular programs and modules, or \nthrough customized training. Vocational training and community development programs aim to \nimprove incomes, health, sanitation, and quality of life of rural people. These programs conduct \ninstitutional and mobile training in agriculture, livestock, health, and community development-\nrelated areas. Two centers are currently equipped with training facilities, hostel facilities for at \nleast 10 female trainees, and housing facilities for core staff. Three institutions are presently \nrunning as polytechnic institutes and two more are planned. Polytechnics focus on diploma \nprograms.  \n \n6.  CTEVT training institutions focus mostly on long-term training, i.e., TSLC and diploma. \nEntry to TSLC programs is restricted to those with 10 years of schooling accompanied by \nexams and interview.  To improve the connection between training and employment and to ", "Appendix 2  27\nprovide real work experience to students, on-the-job training was made compulsory in almost all \ntechnical school programs. CTEVT training institutions also run short courses in collaboration \nwith industries and  manpower agencies,1 e.g., training for domestic helpers. A number of \nCTEVT schools rely on the normal budget to run short courses.  \n \n7.  The annex program is an option for general high schools aimed at providing TEVT to the \nunemployed, college-based, or dropout youth by using high schools\u2019 existing physical and \nhuman resources. A range of TEVT programs is provided, including civil engineering, electrical \nengineering, mechanical engineering, and agriculture. Successful trainees will be awarded \nTSLCs. In addition to long-term courses, each school will conduct short-term or modular training \ncourses of 1 to 6 months' duration according to local employment demands. The annex program \nhas operated for 2 years in 15 schools and has no graduates to date.  \n \n8.    Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies. Two agencies under the Ministry of \nIndustry, Commerce and Supplies, namely the Department of Cottage and Small Industries \n(DCSI) and the Cottage  and Small Industry Development Board (CSIDB) provide short-term \ntraining. These are focused on developing cottage and small industries. DCSI operates mainly \nin the lowland areas, while CSIDB operates in the hills and mountains. DCSI operates in 27 \ndistricts and CSIDB  in 48 districts. They provide about  80 courses with new ones being \ndeveloped as necessary. These are up to 6 months long and include sewing, tailoring, soap \nmaking, woodcarving, and motor maintenance. In DCSI, courses are not only free but a monthly \nstipend is also provided. Access to microfinance is provided to enable participants to start a \nbusiness. The target groups are (i) socially disadvantaged groups, (ii) youth from remote and \nunderdeveloped  villages,  (iii)  women\u2019s  groups,  (iv)  people  committed  to  starting  income \ngenerating  activities  after  training,  (v)  those  engaged  in  traditional  crafts,  and  \n(vi)  the  unemployed  and  underemployed.  For  2001/02,  CSIDB\u2019s  budget  for  training  was \nintended to train 8,390 students; the CSIDB budget is a constraint to service delivery as up to \n12,000 trainees per year have received training in the past.  \n \n9.   Department of Labour and Employment Promotion. The Department of Labour and \nEmployment  Promotion  focuses  on  semiskilled  and  skilled  work  in  the  formal  sector.  \nThe department runs 14 skills training centers and two technical schools. Centers are expected \nto carry out labor market surveys and run training in areas in demand. Their courses are up to  \n6 months long in areas that include general mechanics; motorcycle repair; petrol and diesel \nengine maintenance; and videocassette recorder, television, and other maintenance.  \n \n10.   Training in Other Line Ministries.  Other ministries also offer training programs that \nfocus  on  advancing  their  respective  sectoral  interests.  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and \nCooperatives not only offers training to farmers but also provides longer term programs for \ntechnical assistants and junior technicians for their ministry. The Ministry of Tourism has its own \ntraining center for the tourism industry, which provides a range of programs from short-term to \nmaster\u2019s degrees.  \n  \n11.   Private Training Provision.  CTEVT has granted provisional affiliation to over 110 \nprivate  training  institutes  that  cover  47  districts  of  Nepal  and  provide  175  programs. \nApproximately 7,200 are enrolled in TSLC courses conducted by CTEVT-affiliated institutions. \nHowever,  not  all  training  providers  affiliate  with  CTEVT;  computer-training  institutions,  \nin particular, tend not to affiliate. These institutes offer programs ranging from short to TSLC and \ndiploma courses. The institutions pay a fee and, in the case of those offering TSLC and diploma \n                                                                 \n1   Recruitment agencies for international employment are called \u201cmanpower agencies\u201d in Nepal. \n  ", "28 Appendix 2 \ncourses, use CTEVT curricula and their students sit for CTEVT-administered examinations.  \nThe range of perceptions obtained during the project preparation interviews, however, suggests \nan overall lack of public credibility about CTEVT\u2019s accreditation process.  \n \n12.   Another type of private institution offers short-term training in skill areas of high demand. \nThe major ones offer training relating to computers, tourism, and electronics. Many manpower \nagencies supplying human resources to the international market also run their own training to \nprepare  workers.  Courses  closely  reflect  student  demand.  A  range  of  community-focused \norganizations, supported by aid funds, offer training to meet local or more general needs.  \n \n13.   Issues in TEVT. The TEVT subsector in Nepal is highly fragmented. Although a national \nTEVT policy was approved in 1999 by the CTEVT  Assembly, this is  not adhered to by all \nstakeholders. Policy guidelines are available but not adequately implemented. The public sector \nis characterized by weak institutional leadership. CTEVT is too burdened with implementation \ntasks. The roles of the various stakeholders of the TEVT system are not clearly defined and \norganized. Skills development is organized by government ministries (and within ministries,  \nby departments), nongovernment organizations, aid projects, and to some extent, by local \ninitiatives. Coordination between these various actors and their respective activities is lacking, \nleading to duplication of activities, e.g., development of curricula and skills standards, and, \ntherefore, wastage of already scarce resources. Most training providers work to their own \nbenchmarks  and  curricula;  outcomes  are  variable.  Consequently,  the  agencies  have  no \ncommon purpose or comparable outcomes. Most TEVT-related decisions are made at the \ncentral  level  within  each  of  the  respective  line  ministries  with  little  consultation  with  key \nstakeholders, such as the private sector and local communities. Moreover, government funding \nfor training to each public agency is based on the needs of the given department rather than the \npriorities within the training market. Incentives and rewards for well-performing institutions are \nlacking, as are sanctions for nonperforming institutions. \n \n14.   Training is of poor relevance. The public TEVT system is largely supply-driven; training \nprograms offered are often based on the allocated budgets of public training providers, and \navailable staff and equipment. Training needs assessment is weak and often absent; the labor \nmarket information system is weak and is unable to provide up-to-date labor market information \nto assist training program selection. The outcomes of both rarely guide the selection of skills \nand content, with the consequence that offered courses and their content are regularly irrelevant \nto needs and demands. The inadequate linkage between educational institutions and industry \nhas led to a lack of mutual cooperation. Consequently, educational institutions are not always \nfully aware of the needs of industry nor are they able to fully explore ways industry can help, \nsuch as through on-the-job training. \n \n15.   National standards to measure skills levels are largely absent. Overall training efforts are \nnot leading to a significant proportion of trainees gaining employment or self-employment, and \nthus not contributing much to poverty reduction. Employment rates of trainees from CTEVT and \nprivate training institutes range from 30% to 80%,2 which is partly attributed to outcomes of \ncourses not being the attainment  of skills standards, i.e., performance defined by industry. \nInstead, the outcomes are the skills and content knowledge of the curriculum, the quality and \nrelevance of which are questionable. Monitoring and evaluation mechanisms are inadequate or, \nin  some  cases,  absent.  Measurement  of  stakeholders\u2019  performances,  accountability,  and \ntransparency  in  budget  management  is  insufficient.  Monitoring  of  the  quality  of  training \nprograms needs to be improved. The growing number of private training providers, a proportion \n                                                                 \n2  Tracer studies are not regularly conducted. These figures are, at best, estimates. ", "Appendix 2  29\nof which  are in the training business solely for  financial benefits, poses a threat to training \nquality across the country. \n \n16.    In addition to being poorly identified, training programs may also be poorly designed \nand/or poorly delivered. The development of curricula is too centralized, and curricula are not \nsufficiently frequently revised to reflect changing market demands.  In some public training \nprograms, training curricula have not been reviewed for at least 5 years. Many instructors, \nincluding those in private colleges, do not possess training in instructional techniques nor do \nthey have extensive technical expertise. Trainers and instructors\u2019 skills and capacities are rarely \nupgraded. Currently, no standards exist for either instructional or technical expertise. Many \ntraining instructors, public and private, have not had any instructional training or need to have a \nrefresher program in training instruction. Budgets of public training institutions are limited and \nare thus not able to send their staff for training in vocational education pedagogy. Most public \nproviders\u2019 sites suffer from lack of maintenance, tools, equipment, materials, and/or supplies.   \n \n17.    Many TEVT providers focus solely on training rather than the outcomes of training. Many \ndo not provide posttraining support, e.g., career counseling and job placement. Posttraining \nsupport is particularly critical in training for self-employment, as providing linkages to economic \nopportunities like small business development activities and microfinance is important.  \n \n18.   Training programs have not yet significantly refocused on the emerging needs  of the \nlabor market or of large population groups. While the major potential sources of employment \nand  income  generation  are  in  the  informal/self-employment  and  international  employment \nsectors, insufficient training is provided for jobs that are in demand and skills that lead to self-\nemployment. To improve the relevance of programs, training providers need to make a better \ndetermination  of  trainees\u2019  and  employers\u2019  needs,  and  analyze  communities\u2019  economic \nopportunities. The larger public training providers need to provide more programs addressing \nthe needs of those with less than a school leaving certificate.  \n \n19.   The TEVT subsector in Nepal performs poorly in terms of providing access to skills \ntraining, specifically market-oriented short-term skills training (vocational training). Most people, \nparticularly the poor and disadvantaged, lack access to skills training that can enhance their \nearning  capacity.  Competition  for  training  is  strong,  meaning  that  those  with  significant \nparticipation in secondary school education have a better chance in gaining access. This is \nparticularly the case with TSLC programs run by CTEVT where the entry requirement is 10 \nyears of schooling. This particularly limits access for most disadvantaged groups such as \nwomen, the poor, and the disadvantaged communities, including Dalits (low caste), because of \ntheir lower educational achievement. The sector has no clear and effective strategy to reach the \npoor and the disadvantaged in remote villages.  The tendency for training to be provided in \ntraining centers also makes access difficult for those living in distant areas. Rural and isolated \nareas have little access to training when compared with urban centers. Government funding is \ninsufficient to provide employment-related basic vocational or skills training to millions of people \nacross the country. Mobile training offered by DCSI and CSIDB is limited by the budget. \nInformation being provided to disadvantaged groups, including women about the potential \nbenefits of skills training is insufficient. \n \n20.  Toward a Coordinated TEVT Subsector. Poverty reduction is a major goal for Nepal. \nSkills formation can play a major role in giving people employable skills to earn income. A fresh \nperspective is required to substantially increase the number of people who acquire skills that \nlead  to  incomes.  The  creation  of  a  quality  market-oriented  TEVT  system  offers  such  a \npossibility. Such a system would have (i) acquired skills matching the performance needed for \n  ", "30 Appendix 2 \nemployment  or  self-employment;  (ii)  acquired  skills  matching  labor  market  demand;  and  \n(iii) training providers providing training when and where it is needed, and in the delivery mode \nmost suitable for the trainees. \n  \n21.   Improvement of quality in TEVT requires achieving consistency, by having national \nbenchmarks against which all training providers operate, using skills testing to verify attainment \nof skills standards, and adopting emerging approaches to training for self-employment that \nfocus on employment rather on training alone. These could include developing a nationally \nendorsed policy including frameworks such as training standards and using skills standards \n(that address performance) rather than curriculum (that addresses content) as the focus of \ntraining.  The  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  team  recommended,  among  others:  \n(i) developing a national strategic plan for the TEVT subsector including vision and mission to \nbe developed by all stakeholders including industry, community groups, all other ministries \ninvolved in training, and private providers; (ii) developing a national strategic plan that includes \nthe formulation of a national qualifications framework and skills standards, and marketing and \nwidely disseminating the plan nationally; (iii) developing qualifications based on standards rather \nthan  curriculum;  (iv)  developing  a  mechanism  for  demand-driven  training  for  women  and \ndisadvantaged groups; (v) strengthening CTEVT to enhance its role in providing services to the \nTEVT subsector including skills standards, skills testing and curriculum; (vi) CTEVT assuming a \nmajor  role  in  strengthening  vocational  training  providers;  (vii)  improving  linkages  between \ntraining  providers  and  posttraining  services,  especially  microcredit;  (viii)  labor  market \ninformation analysis strengthened in relevant institutions; and (ix) adopting emerging vocational \ntraining approaches such as those from the experiences of United Mission to  Nepal, Swiss \nAgency for Development and Cooperation, and Helvetas.3   \n \n22.   Ongoing Policy Development. CTEVT is presently spearheading the development of a \nnew national TEVT policy that involves a wide representation of stakeholders.4 The Core \nWorking Group also comprises representatives from the major government training providers, \nCTEVT, CSIDB, DCSI, Department of Labour and Employment Promotion, and National Dalit \nCommission.  The  development  process  is  guided  by  the  Policy  Coordination  Committee, \ncomprising representatives of at least 30 groups, including public training providers, private \ntraining  providers,  manpower  agencies,  employers,  women,  and  disadvantaged  groups.  \nThe  consultation  process,  undertaken  throughout  the  country,  highlighted  issues  including \naccess,  relevance,  coordination,  financing,  quality  assurance  and  monitoring,  posttraining \nservices,  information  dissemination,  training  of  trainers,  and  public-private  partnerships.  \nThe  envisioned  training  policy  framework  will  address  current  institutional  weaknesses, \nrelevance, quality, financing, organizational setup, delivery, information, and monitoring and \nevaluation. \n \n                                                                 \n3  TAFE  Global.  2004.

GCE Strategy Goal \n1.   The goal of the GCE strategy is to address the issue of social exclusion which prevents \naccess and opportunity in Nepal for particular groups of people. An effective strategy for social \ninclusion requires both project and policy level intervention. The Project ensures better access \nto vocational training (VT) opportunities for employment and self-employment for target groups \nat the grassroots, which in turn provides more secure access to livelihood assets. Scaling up \nand sustaining improvements beyond the life of the Project requires representation of target \ngroups in decision-making at the national policy level. It is expected that representation in the \nnational technical education and vocational training (TEVT) policy coordination committee and \nnational and district steering committees for the Project will ensure more inclusive strategies for \ncontinued access to vocational training resources for employment and self-employment and \ninfluence thinking among all stakeholders for training interventions in support of greatersocial \ninclusion and equity, and improved governance. Representation of women, Dalits (low caste) \nand the disadvantaged groups will hence be ensured. At district level, the composition of these \ngroups will vary depending on the different caste-ethnic group compositions in districts. \n \nB.  GCE Strategy Purpose \n2.  This GCE strategy will address the critical issue of ensuring that poor rural men and \nwomen, particularly from the  Dalit and disadvantaged groups have equitable access to VT \nservices. The Project will promote equal access to TEVT information by all target groups on \navailable training services, post-training support services, and available microfinance options, \nwhere available.  \n \nC.  Implementation Strategies \n1.  Component 1b: Supporting the Delivery of Short-Term Skills Training for \nFormal and International Labor Markets \n3.   The  Project  will  support  the  development  and  delivery  of  short-term  skills  training \nprograms that are market-oriented. The programs will improve the chances of beneficiaries for \noverseas and formal sector work. Various population groups will be served, with particular focus \non the poor, women, Dalit and disadvantaged groups. \n \n4.   The project implementation unit (PIU) will evaluate the proposals from training providers \naccording to project steering committee (ProSC)-approved criteria, and the ProSC will select \nand approve the training providers. Contracts will include conditions on performance indicators \nand progress payments. Selected training providers\u2019 (TPs) staff will be required to undertake \ntraining in the GCE-sensitization training module. \n \n5.  Invitation for training proposals will require the TP to include the following services:  \n(i) trainee selection; (ii) training; and (iii) post-training services. \n \n ", "34 Appendix 4 \n \n2.  Component  1c:  Supporting  the  Delivery  of  Community-Based  Market-\nOriented Short-Term Skills Training \n6.   An additional goal of component 2 is to strengthen the capacity of  Department of \nCottage  and  Small  Industries  (DCSI) and  Cottage of Small Industries Development Board \n(CSIDB) district personnel to equip them with skills in their new role outlined below. The model \nfor community-based training outlined below places emphasis on proactive trainee selection of \ntarget groups, rural community training needs analysis, quality training (including on-the-job \ntraining  (OJT)  where  appropriate  and  possible),  and  post-training  services.  This  model \nimplemented on a pilot basis early in the Project will provide valuable experience and direction \nin the future at the district level in aiming to meet the vocational training needs for employment \nand self-employment of the target groups. \n \n7.   Capacity  Building  of  Nongovernment  Organizations  (NGOs)  and  Training \nProviders. Training for NGOs and training providers contracted by DCSI/CSIDB will include the  \nGCE-sensitization training module. The GCE training will enable selected NGO and training \nproviders to receive capacity building in identifying market-oriented training needs.  \n \n8.   Target Groups for Community-Based Short-term Skills Training. Target groups to \nreceive subsidized training and post-training services will include overall project target group \nquotas. At least 60% of the trainees will be women, Dalit, or disadvantaged, while ensuring at \nthe  same  time  that  50%  of  the  trainees  are  women,  and  that  25%  are  Dalits.  \nGCE-disaggregated training management information system (TMIS) data will help track these \nnumbers. DCSI/CSIDB and the district steering committee will monitor to ensure that target \ngroups are being served by the project. The GCE specialist will assist the TMIS expert develop \na monitoring mechanism.  \n \n9.   District Needs Assessment Conducted. A district training needs assessment format \nwill be developed in year 1. DCSI/CSIDB will be trained on its use and DCSI/CSIDB will contract \nand orient a skilled NGO to conduct a survey to assess available training programs for jobs in \ndemand that lead to informal and self-employment. The assessment will provide information on \ntarget groups, determine market opportunities and employers\u2019 needs, and analyze communities\u2019 \neconomic opportunities, e.g. agriculture-related enterprise, indigenous skills development, and \nthe availability and conditions of microfinance institutions. The survey will list district training \nproviders and the availability, and quality where possible, of market-oriented short-term skills \ntraining programs, which are accessible to those who have less than class 10 qualifications.  \nThe survey will facilitate the process of identifying and implementing training programs in \ncommunities. DCSI/CSIDB will analyze this data and make recommendations to  Council for \nTechnical  Education  and  Vocational  Training  (CTEVT)  for  new  short-term market-oriented  \nshort-term training curricula to be developed from year 2. \n \n10.   Tendering for  Training Needs Assessment  (TNA)/Training Services/Posttraining \nSupport Services by DCSI/CSIDB. A tendering process will be conducted by DCSI/CSIDB in \nyear  2.  Proposals  for  delivering  services  will  be  sought  from  service  providers \n(NGO/public/private training providers) that will include: (i)  TNA developed and conducted;  \n(ii) vocational training; and (iii) post-training support services.   \n \n11.   Selection of Training Providers. Selection criteria for TPs will be developed by the PIU \nwith support from the GCE consultant in year 1 and approved by the ProSC and  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank.  TPs  should  demonstrate  adequate  skills  training  experience,  \nand have sufficient financial, human and technical resources. TPs should have proven previous ", " Appendix 4  35\nexperience and existing networks working with specific target groups to provide appropriate \nGCE-sensitive community mobilization services and training. TPs should demonstrate adequate \ntraining package plans that meet criteria for TNA, training, and post-training services with clear \noutputs and indicators. Women instructors should be part of the training resource for district \ncentre-based training, for the purposes of training community women, where possible. If district-\nlevel training is required, separate women-only training should be considered where necessary. \nTraining providers must agree to identify adequate and secure accommodation for women \nattending district level training. DCSI/CSIDB needs to ensure that modalities and transparent \ncriteria developed by the PIU are applied before accepting proposals and ensure that poor \napplicants are selected for training.  TP should ensure that information on specific targeted \nsubsidies to the poorest and disadvantaged groups is made explicit in the tender document. \n \n3.  Component 2:  Capacity Strengthening \n12.   The GCE consultant will support the research and information division of CTEVT, which \nwill  be  strengthened  towards  more  effective  sector  analysis,  coordination,  and  strategic \nplanning, including a GCE perspective. Reports on the performance of the sub-sector, including \nGCE-disaggregated statistics on short-term training and skills testing results, will be published \nannually. Through this division, CTEVT will prepare four GCE-sensitive tracer studies for the \nProject.  \n \n13.   Training  packages  to  be  prepared  for  trainers,  training  supervisors,  and  training \nmanagers will include a module on how to build awareness of GCE and social inclusion issues, \nwhich  need  to  be  addressed  in  TNA,  trainee  selection,  planning,  implementation,  and \nemployment opportunities. The GCE sensitization module will be developed in year 1 with the \nsupport of the GCE specialist, and will include the means to address the following issues:  \n(i) GCE awareness building and changing negative personal attitudes; (ii) issues of mobility, \nparticularly for women; (iii) targeting of Dalit men and women can be targeted for better access \nto TVET training; (iv) \u201cwomen-only\u201d training for district centre-based in secure accommodation; \n(v) training instructors in the relevant language; and (vi) women instructors for women trainees.   \n \n14.   The TMIS capacity of public training providers will be strengthened by the Project to \nfacilitate the sharing of GCE-disaggregated data and information between the provider and \nCTEVT. This will contribute to the provision of better GCE-disaggregated information about \ntraining demand, delivery, and outcomes. The GCE consultant will support the TMIS capacity-\nbuilding effort to ensure GCE-sensitive data and processes are incorporated into the TMIS. \n \n15.   GCE Awareness Training Component for DCSI/CSIDB. District officers of DCSI and \nCSIDB  will  be  trained  in  strengthening  their  roles  in  community  liaison  and  facilitation.  \nThis training package will include the same GCE module as mentioned above on sensitization \nto GCE and social inclusion issues that need to be addressed in market-oriented short-term \nskills  training  TNA,  trainee  selection,  planning,  implementation,  and  post-training \nservices/employment opportunities. \n \n4.  Component  3:    Supporting  the  Policy  Development,  Articulation,  and \nImplementation \n16.  The  national  TEVT  Policy  Coordination  Committee  will  include  representatives  of \nwomen,  dalits,  indigenous  groups,  the  disabled,  and  other  disadvantaged  groups.  \nThese representatives will participate in the ongoing policy dialogue and stakeholder workshops \nto refine and finalize policy. This will ensure that the policy and framework addresses inclusion ", "36 Appendix 4 \n \nof women, poor, and disadvantaged groups and other associated key issues. In addition, central \nand district steering committees will include a similar representation as above. \n \n5.   GCE-Disaggregated Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n17.   Community-Based  Pilot  Program  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  A  GCE-sensitive \nmonitoring and evaluation system will be developed by the PIU, supported by the TMIS and the \nGCE specialist in year 2 and training will be delivered in its application to DCSI and CSIDB staff \nin the pilot districts from year 2.  \n \n18.   For All Project Components. The national GCE consultant will assist the international \nand national TMIS specialists to ensure all data collected in the TMIS system is disaggregated \nby  gender,  caste,  ethnicity,  age  and  poverty  and  to  conduct  training  of  CTEVT  staff,  \nas necessary, to analyze data from a GCE perspective. In particular, the GCE specialist will \nensure monitoring and evaluation procedures include indicators for monitoring impact of TEVT \nservices on target groups, as well as extent of participation of better off and poor men, women \nand  children,  and  socially  excluded  groups  such  as  Dalits  and  disadvantaged  groups.  \nThe design of the TMIS will elicit data on GCE issues that impact on the effectiveness of \ndifferent approaches adopted to meet the needs of these groups, benefits, and constraints. \nThese data will be used to adjust Project design and approaches as necessary as part of a \nprocess approach. Data will be evaluated and disseminated by trained CTEVT staff. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \nTable A5.1: Cost Estimates \n($'000) \nTotal Cost ADB Financed Government\nItem FX LC Total FX LC Total LC Total  \n \nA.Increasing Access to Market-Oriented Short-Term Skills Training\n1.

Economic Analysis \n \n1.  The Economy and the Labor Market. Nepal\u2019s economic performance in recent years \nhas been poor with low potential for improvement in the medium term. The Nepalese economy \nis  largely  dependent  on  agriculture,  with  the  services  and  industry  sectors  growing  in \nimportance.  Gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  fiscal  year  (FY)  2003  was  estimated  at  \n$5.9 billion1 and the growth rate at 3.1%.2 The services and the agriculture sectors are the largest \nsectors  in  the  economy,  each  contributing  close  to  40%  of  GDP, while  the  industry sector \ncontributed about 21%. Remittances from workers abroad are estimated to contribute 25% of \nGDP.3 The services and industry sectors grew more than the agriculture sector in FY2003; the \naverage annual growth of services and industry sectors were 2.7% and 2.3%, respectively, \nwhile the agriculture sector grew 2.1%. Agriculture employs the most workers, absorbing about \n75% of the labor force. In contrast, the services and industry sectors employ only about 23%.4 \nThe  total  unemployment  rate  is  estimated  at  17.4%,  which  is  largely  accounted  for  by \nunderemployment; the unadjusted unemployment rate is 5%. Approximately three quarters of \nthe underemployed are estimated to be in the agriculture sector. The Government estimates the \nlabor force will increase  by 1.05 million  during the Tenth Plan period,  2002\u20132007, or about \n200,000 new workers each year. \n \n2.  A major constraint to employment is the lack of  appropriate skills needed in the labor \nmarket. A reduction in  underemployment will require shifting some of  the labor force from \nagriculture to the other sectors in both local and foreign labor markets through labor market \nanalyses and  market-orientation of training programs  in technical education and vocational \ntraining (TEVT) institutions. The current provision of TEVT has had little success in delivering \neffective training. Ineffectiveness stems from the (i) irrelevance of curricula, (ii) low quality of \ntraining, and (iii) lack of posttraining support. This has resulted in low external efficiency; the job \nplacement rate of training completers is estimated at 50%. The TEVT sector requires a change \nin its training delivery mechanisms to develop a more effective and efficient system. \n \n3.  Demand  Analysis.  Demand  for  vocational  training  is  substantial.  About  200,000 \nworkers enter the workforce each year. As the completion rate of secondary education is \napproximately 12%, approximately 88% of the new entrants to the workforce are likely to require \ntraining for basic vocational  skills. However, only 50,000 places are available for  vocational \ntraining each year, leaving a large demand gap. \n \n4.  The  Tenth  Plan  provides  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  for  employment  creation.  \nThe strategy indicates that demand for nonagricultural workers will increase, implying a need for \nnonagricultural  training  for  the  future  workforce.  In  2004,  75%  of  employment  will  be  in \nagriculture, but the proportion will gradually decline to 70% by 2007. To achieve the shift of \nemployment from agriculture to nonagriculture sectors, approximately 200,000 people, the same \nnumber of people as the  new entrants to the workforce, will be  recruited in nonagriculture \nsectors. Therefore, the economy will have sufficient demand for those with nonagricultural skills. \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2004. Nepal at a Glance.

Nepal \ncurrently meets foreign requests for unskilled labor but not that for semiskilled or skilled labor.  \nIn the various skill areas sought by manpower agencies in 2002 (footnote 3), only 866 were \nsupplied out of the 55,956 semiskilled and skilled workers sought. The scope for increasing the \nnumber of  semiskilled international workers is considerable, implying substantial demand for \nvocational training. \n \n5.  Consideration of Design Alternatives. To support the Government\u2019s strategies under \nthe Tenth Plan, intervention for the TEVT sector had two main options: support TEVT policy \nreforms associated with restructuring a vocational training system through a program loan, or \nfocus on ensuring effective and efficient delivery of training at institutional and community levels \nthrough  an  investment  loan.  While  support  to  TEVT  policy  reforms  prior  to  any  project \ninvestments  is  a  rational  approach  from  a  development  perspective,  implementation and \nenforcement of systemic reforms in every  part of the country through government agencies \nwould be  difficult at this time, given the conflict situation. On the other hand,  while project \ninvestment at institutional and community levels may not immediately address the nature of the \nproblem,  it  is  likely  to  impact  on  effectiveness  and  efficiency  in  a  short  period  of  time.  \nThe proposed Project has therefore taken a middle path, in which support is extended to the  \n(i) TEVT policy reform process, while (ii)  strengthening the framework of  the TEVT system,  \n(iii)  incorporating  labor  market  information  analysis  to  training  planning  and  delivery, and  \n(iv) improving the delivery of training in both public and private institutions in selected districts. \n \n6.  Economic Internal Rate of Return. To assess the economic viability and efficiency of \nthe investment under the Project, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) over 25 years was \nestimated. Economic benefits of the  Project are derived mainly from  (i) increased access to \ntraining institutions, and (ii) improved relevance and quality of skills training. The economic \nimpacts are estimated using future salary increments as a result of completing market-oriented \nshort term skills training supported by the  Project. The  estimate is based on conservative \nassumptions, employing the minimum wage of unskilled and semiskilled local workers rather \nthan market wages.  \n \n7.  Increase in access is represented by the  growth in  enrollment as a result of newly \nintroduced short-term training programs. The Project will fund the cost of an additional 100,000 \ntrainees in short-term vocational training programs in 6 years. The additional  training will be \nterminated by project completion.  Two types of employment opportunities  are available  after \ntraining: local and foreign. The analysis assumes that unemployed and unskilled workers will \nbecome semiskilled workers by obtaining the appropriate skills and the ethos as future labor \nmarket participants. This increases their productivity and will raise their annual wage by about \n$8 and $1,500  in the  following 5 years, depending on the employment status prior to the \ntraining, and local and foreign employment opportunities.  \n \n8.  Improved relevance and quality of training raises labor productivity and is measured by \nthe extent to which training completers earn more than the minimum wage, on the assumption \nthat newly designed courses and better institutional management will increase the effectiveness \nof training  delivery, and thus better performance at workplaces. The  Project will support the \nimprovement of both existing and new training programs. Completion of short-term skills training \nis assumed to increase annual earnings by 1.3% in the following 5 years.5 Increased relevance \n                                                 \n5  New short-term vocational training programs are estimated to allow the trainees to earn the wage value at the \n  middle of semiskilled and skilled worker thresholds for the national minimum wage. ", "48 Appendix 10 \nand improved quality will improve external efficiency; this is measured by the difference in the \nemployment rates of the completers of short-term skills training between the with- and without-\nproject  scenario,  based  on  the  assumption  that  improved  educational  curricula,  better \ninstructional  techniques,  and  assistance  for  job  placement  will  create  more  employment \nopportunities,  particularly  internationally.  Currently,  approximately  50%  of  graduates  and \ncompleters are estimated to not be able to obtain jobs immediately after completion. During the \nProject, the employment rate of the completers is envisaged to gradually improve to 60%. At the \nsame time, the proportion of those who choose to work abroad is assumed to be the same as \nthe immigration rate of the country, and will increase by 20% during the 6-year project period as \na result of receiving market-oriented, short term skills training assisted by the Project. \n \n9.  Economic costs are divided into (i) investment cost of the Project, (ii) recurrent cost, and \n(iii) private and opportunity costs. The cost of the Project is estimated at $25 million. Recurrent \ncost  includes  additional  administrative  expenses  of  improving  the  provision  of  short-term \ntraining, which gradually increases from $56,000 to $305,000 during the 6-year project period. \nThe recurrent cost remains at $305,000 after the project period. Private costs include the out-of-\npocket expenses of trainees for a short-term, 3-month training program; and are estimated at \n$20 per program. Opportunity cost is equivalent to the income that a trainee would otherwise \nreceive when not engaged in the short-term skills training for 3 months and is estimated at $68. \n \nTable A10.1: Assumptions for Economic Internal Rate of Return Estimates \nEconomic Benefit of Increased Access   \nImpact of short-term vocational training on annual salary    \nTrainees who were unemployed and seek local employment  $417 \nTrainees who were unemployed and seek international employment  $3,712 \nTrainees who were unskilled workers and seek local employment  $8 \nTrainees who were unskilled workers and seek international employment  $3,440 \n   \nEconomic Benefit of Improved Quality of Training   \nDegree of improvement in earning  1.3% \n   \nEconomic Benefit of Improved External Efficiency   \nJob placement rate among training completers without Project  50% \nDegree of improvement in job placement rate among training completers  20% \nProportion of those who seek international employment after training  3.3% \nDegree of increase in international employment among training completers  20% \n   \nEconomic Cost of Proposed Project   \nRecurrent cost after the project period  $305,000 \nPrivate cost (per training program per trainee)  $20 \nOpportunity cost (per training program per trainee)  $68 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.   \n \n10.  The Project is estimated to yield a net present value of $22.3 million, assuming a \ndiscount rate of 12.0%; the EIRR is estimated at 28.2%. The actual EIRR is likely to be higher in \nview of economywide multiplier effects of remittances and social benefits in terms of positive \nwork ethics and addressing an underlying cause of the conflict. \n \n11.  Sensitivity Analysis. A sensitivity analysis was undertaken on the basis of alternative \nassumptions regarding the  extent to which the  Project achieves  improved access, training \nquality, and external efficiency. The targets of the Project are approximately 100,000 additional \ntrainees per year, 3.1% increase in earnings, and 20% increase in job placement rate among \ntraining  completers.  For  analytical  purposes,  the  sensitivity  of  the  EIRR  was  tested  by \nemploying extreme values. In the low case scenario, improvements through the Project are 50% \nless than the target; the target for additional trainees is reduced to 51,000 and earning and job ", "Appendix 10  49\nplacement rates increase by 1.5% and 10%, respectively. In the high case scenario, Project \nbenefits are 50% more than the target;  the number of  trainees is increased to 153,000 and \nearning and job placement rates increase by 4.6% and 30%, respectively. The results are \nshown in Table A10.2. \n \nTable A10.2: Sensitivity Analysis \n(%) \nItem  Low Case  Normal Case  High Case \nIncrease in Access  11.9            28.2           44.5 \n(degree of change)          (57.8)              0           57.8 \nQuality Improvement           26.2            28.2           30.2 \n(degree of change)            (7.1)              0             7.1 \nExternal Efficiency           26.6            28.2           29.8 \n(degree of change)             5.7               0             5.7 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.   \n \n12.  The results indicate that the Project will bring substantial benefits to the economy when \nall the degrees of improvement in the three areas exceed the targets. However, an excessive \nincrease in access may result in overcrowded training programs, which is likely to lead to lower \nquality  of  training.  The results also indicate that  the Project is  highly sensitive to access.  \nA decline in the degree of improvement in access could render the Project economically \nnonviable. The calculation indicates that the Project must achieve at least 50.2% of the increase \nin access target. Collaboration with employers, manpower agencies, private and public training \nproviders, and community-based organizations under the Project will contribute to achieving the \nminimum target. \n \nB.   Poverty Impact Analysis \n \n13.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  providing  the unemployed and \nunderemployed with more opportunities to receive wages in the labor  market through skills \ntraining, guidance, and job placement programs. About 38% of the population lives in poverty. \nThe national poverty line in Nepal, based on the caloric norm of 2,124 calories per adult daily \nequivalent and nonfood basic needs, is estimated at NRs4,404 ($58.7) per month.6 The direct \nbeneficiaries of the Project are trainees in market-oriented, short-term skills training, who are \neither unskilled workers or unemployed, and whose earning levels are likely to be below the \npoverty line. A trainee who completes skills training is expected to have sufficient skills to be \nemployed as a semiskilled worker and  be entitled to receive, at least, the national minimum \nwage at NRs2,610 ($34.8) per month, once successfully employed in the local labor market.  \nAs 42.6% of the employed population has a second job in agriculture or in industry,7 a similar \nproportion of the  training completers are likely to engage in a second job and will  earn an \nadditional income at least NRs73 ($1.0) per day.8 This will bring the monthly earnings closer to \nthe national poverty line. In case of international employment, a training completer is likely to \nearn the average wage of a semiskilled international worker at $318.0 per month, which is well \nabove the national poverty line.  \n \n14.   Overall, assuming that all beneficiaries of the  Project are unemployed or unskilled \nworkers and, hence, in poverty, the estimated impact of the Project on poverty reduction is that \n                                                 \n6 Japan Bank for International Cooperation. 2003.

", "50 Appendix 10 \n2.4% of the beneficiaries will be able to earn more than the poverty line, and 24.5% will earn \nmore than the food poverty line of NRs2,637 ($35.2) (that may not be sufficient to cover the \nadditional expenditure for nonfood consumption); 33.1% will earn just below the food poverty \nline; and 40.0% will still be in poverty. The estimate is based on the employment status of the \ntrainee immediately after completing skills training. All beneficiaries will be able to earn at least \n$34.8 after  training completion, and with  the improved access to labor market information,  \nthose still in poverty will likely be able to find new or additional jobs in the future. \n \nC.   Financial Analysis \n \n15.  The TEVT sector is growing and heavily dependent on the development budget. Total \nbudget for TEVT provision under the Ministry of Education and Sports, Ministry of Labor and \nTransport Management, and Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies in FY2004/05 was \nestimated at NRs425 million\u20140.4% of the total Government budget. The TEVT sector budget \ngrew by 22.1% in FY2003/04 and 9.7% in FY2004/05. The growth of regular budget in the TEVT \nsector has been in line with that of total  Government budget in FY2003/04 and FY 2004/05, \nwhile the growth level of development budget depends upon the number of programs and \nprojects committed in each year. Approximately 96.7% of the TEVT budget was sourced from \nthe development budget, which covers the cost of the training programs, including salary for \ntrainers, training materials, stipends for trainees, and operation and maintenance of training \ncenters. Regular budget, which covers the cost of establishment and utilities, was only 3.3%.  \nAt the department level, the Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training receives \nthe largest proportion of  the TEVT budget at 32.5% in FY2004/05. At  the ministerial level, \nhowever, the Ministry of Industries, Commerce, and Supplies, which  includes Department of \nCottage and Small Industries and Cottage and Small Industries Development Board, obtains the \nlargest proportion at 44.6%. \n \n16.  Financial affordability and sustainability of the Project is analyzed based on the medium-\nterm  macroeconomic  framework  in  the  Tenth  Plan  and  International  Monetary  Fund \nprojections.9 The GDP growth rate is assumed to be constant at 4.6%, and the  Government \nbudget  as  a  proportion  of  GDP  at  around  23.7%  between  FY2005/06  and  FY  2011/12.  \nThe proportion of  the relevant ministerial and departmental  budget in  the total Government \nbudget will remain constant as that in FY2004/05, given an assumption that the Government will \ntry to allocate the same level of development budget from both its own and external sources. \n \n17.  The forecast indicates that, by the end of the proposed Project, the TEVT sector budget \nwill have increased by NRs141 million ($1.9 million) from FY2005/06, including NRs133 million \n($1.8 million) in the development budget and NRs8 million ($0.1 million) in the regular budget. \nAdditional recurrent cost after project implementation are estimated at $0.4, including salary of \nadditional staff, operation and maintenance cost of newly introduced information systems, and \nexpenses  for  new  administrative  procedures.  Given  that  the  regular  budget  finances  only \nestablishment and utility charges and that TEVT institutions cannot easily increase the size of \ntheir establishment, the majority of the cost has to be financed from the development budget. \nThe additional development budget in FY2011/12 will be sufficient to cover the additional \nrecurrent cost attributable to the Project. \n                                                 \n9  http://www.imf.org/external/country/NPL/index.htm.

The conflict has hampered the implementation of projects  in many parts of Nepal.1 \nImplementation has continued for some, but at a slower pace. Problems encountered have \nbeen  location-specific.  Problems  include  fielding  consultants,  obtaining  government  staff \nparticipation in the field, and delivering project inputs.2 For more effective implementation, some \nprojects have employed community-based organizations. In the complex area of policy reform, \nparticularly related to legislation, progress has been slow due to the complex political situation. \n \n2.   Government Strategy. The Government acknowledges that the conflict is making the \nimplementation  of  development  activities  programs  difficult  in  conflict-affected  areas.  \nIn response, it has adopted near-term and longer term strategies to complement implementation \nof its poverty reduction strategy. The Government will, among others, support community-driven \ninitiatives, involve nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and community-based organizations, \nand target the most conflict-affected zones. In addition, in the longer term, the Government \nstrategy  includes  decentralization,  more  participatory  approaches  to  planning  and \nimplementation, and targeted actions to reach excluded groups. \n \n3.   Asian Development Bank Strategy. Asian Development Bank (ADB) operations in \nNepal have been affected by the security situation. Of the ongoing 21 ADB-assisted projects, \nonly 7 are classified as \u201clittle or not affected.\u201d3 The ADB strategy supports a more inclusive \ndevelopment process by undertaking a conflict assessment, adopting participatory processes, \nmainstreaming inclusion, and ensuring transparency and accountability. ADB will also adopt \nflexible implementation modalities. \n \n4.   The Project. The Project addresses some of the root causes of the conflict, including \npoverty;  unemployment and  underemployment; and lack of economic opportunities for the \nyouth, poor, and  disadvantaged. The Project supports the provision to the unemployed and \nunderemployed of more market-oriented training in skill areas needed by the domestic and \ninternational labor markets. Training programs to be supported are short-term and are thus \naccessible  to  more  trainees,  especially  for  those  with  less  than  grade  10  qualifications.  \nThe  Project  emphasizes  local  participation  in  training  needs  assessments  and  in  the \norganization of training activities, and the use of NGOs or community-based organizations in the \ncommunities. Women, Dalits (low caste), and disadvantaged groups are targeted to comprise at \nleast 60% of training beneficiaries in communities. District officials will be given training in \nliaising with communities to increase their responsiveness to communities\u2019 needs.  Training \npackages for staff of training providers will include a module on building awareness of gender, \ncaste, and ethnicity, and social inclusion issues. Implementation will also be phased; lessons \nlearned during implementation of skill training activities in the first year will contribute to fine-\ntuning implementation arrangements, procedures, and criteria to better achieve project goals. \n \n                                                 \n1  For a discussion of the impact of conflict on project implementation and Asian Development Bank operations, see \n  Asian Development Bank. 2004.

Experiences in Implementing Community-Based Skills Training \n \n5.   Many NGOs are operating in conflict-affected areas.4 Projects that are perceived to help \nthe community and especially the needy are likely to be favorably viewed. The German aid \norganization  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  (GTZ)  found  better \nsuccess in the conflict situation by improving targeting of the needy and increasing transparency \nof actions toward all stakeholders.5 Projects need to be either politically neutral or consistent \nwith insurgents\u2019 views. Training and other services are generally seen more favorably than \ncapacity building, which is seen as political in nature. International  and domestic NGOs, for \nexample, have been advised to focus on development activities and be transparent about \nbudgets and allocation of resources to show evidence that budgets are spent on the community.   \n \n6.  The experience of CARE-Nepal has revealed the following factors as important for the \nsuccess of a project in conflict areas:6 (i) completion of an in-depth situational analysis before \ndesigning and implementing projects; (ii) close liaison with district administrative authorities;  \n(iii) financial transparency in program activities conducted at community level; (iv) focus on \npeople\u2019s participation and community-based organization networks as implementing partners; \n(v) strong internalization of the values of the  organization to maintain a neutral stance; and  \n(vi) participation of communities, including the disadvantaged, in project activities. \n \n7.   Similarly the experience of Action Aid Nepal shows a need for the following (footnote 6): \n(i) a broader understanding of conflict and causes; (ii) a participatory approach; (iii) observance \nof humanitarian principles; (iv) adoption of a pro-poor agenda; (v) a decentralized approach to \nimplementation; (vi) addressing the negative impacts, while understanding positive impacts of \nstruggle; and (vii) flexibility in adapting interventions to changes in the dynamics of conflict.  \nAction Aid Nepal and other implementation agencies are finding they need to face the issue of \nconflict rather than go around it.  \n \n8.   Three projects7 presently being implemented in conflict-affected areas possess many of \nthe  factors  enumerated  in  paras.  6  and  7.  Common  to  all  three  are  (i)  targeting  the \ndisadvantaged, (ii) providing needed services, and (iii) involving local communities to varying \ndegrees. \n \nC.   The Project in the Context of the Conflict \n \n9.   Supporting  Training  Institutions.  In  all  societies  in  which  conflict  occurs,  some \ninstitutions continue to have importance for all sides even though they are fighting. Training \ninstitutions, for example, can connect people and provide continuity even when people are \ndivided in conflict.8 The Project has a potential opportunity to influence the prominence of peace \ncapacities by supporting training institutions in their role as a \u201cconnector\u201d of people, by positively \nchanging institutional and individual attitudes and actions for peace. The Project will provide \n                                                 \n4  Mahat,  P.  2003.

In addition, training \ninstitutions will begin to take action for peace by expanding access to short-term skills training \nand posttraining support opportunities by training substantial numbers of men and women from \nsocially excluded and marginalized groups, as well as poor socioeconomic groups. A target \ngroup quota is in place and will be closely monitored to ensure smooth implementation. \n \n10.   Conflict-Affected Youth. Conflict that continues over a number of years can leave a \ngeneration of young people who know no other vocation and have no or only a few civilian skills. \nThey can find no other employment and thus have an interest in continued fighting (footnote 8). \nCurrently, many insurgent recruits have poor prospects for alternative sources of employment \nand may also be unable to return to their communities. The Project has the potential to provide \nan alternative route to employment through skills that could reduce the incentives for young \nrecruits  to  continue  fighting.  The  Project  therefore  recognizes  conflict-affected  youth  as  a \nspecial needs group that will benefit from subsidized short-term skills training for employment.  \n \n11.   Foreign Employment. About a quarter of Nepalese households receive remittances.  \nIn rural areas, off-farm wage work is an important source of livelihood accounting for about 38% \nof income. This reflects own-farm food deficits. Foreign migration indicates a lack of domestic \nemployment and economic opportunities. Estimates of international remittances range from a \nconservative 10% of the gross domestic product to as high as 25%.9 The Project is expected to \nexpand opportunities for foreign employment and hence increase much needed remittances. \nThis would offset the trend in Nepal's trade balance, as well as reduce poverty for many families \nin rural Nepal. \n \n12.   Community-Based  Skills  Training.  Community-based,  market-oriented  short-term \nskills training and posttraining support is an important component of the Project and has the \npotential to benefit poor and  marginalized groups, particularly women who are confined to \nvillages and are managing the home-farms in the absence of men who have migrated, as well \nas conflict-affected women and men. From 150,000 to 200,000 people are estimated to have \nleft their homes as a result of the conflict.10 The Project recognizes that people left behind in \nvillages must adjust and compensate for the loss of family or community members. Indeed \nthese people are recognized as among the most impoverished and the most vulnerable; hence \nthe importance given to the community-based, skills training component. \n                                                 \n9  Department for International Development Nepal. 2002.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Nepal: \nNepal\u2019s stagnant growth in recent years, exacerbated by the ongoing conflict, high unemployment rate, \nand a large proportion of the population living below the poverty line, calls for urgent measures to increase \nthe potential for employment and income generation. In view of the current situation where growth in \nformal sector employment is limited, international requests for unskilled, semiskilled, and skilled workers \nare not being filled, and  relevant skills are lacking, the most promising areas for income generation are \nfrom international employment and self-employment. The Project aims to increase the in-country capacity \nto provide more skills training addressing these specific areas of employment to enable poor Nepalese \nmen and women to be more productive and competitive in the labor market.  \n \nSkills formation can play a major role in giving people employable skills to earn income.  The technical \neducation and vocational training (TEVT) sector, particularly vocational training, addresses the need for \nemployable skills by those without school-leaving certificates (SLCs), especially the poor. Admission into \nvocational training programs offered by the Cottage and Small Industries Development Board and the \nDepartment of Cottage and Small Industries do not require SLCs. Training institutions of the Council for \nTechnical Education and Vocational Training, and private training institutions also offer vocational training \nthat does not require SLC, but the number and range of courses needs to be expanded to improve access \nto vocational training for poor and marginalized groups. \n \nSkill acquisition in occupational areas needed by the market increases the likelihood of employment and \nself-employment of trainees. To date, training programs have had mixed results with employment rates, \nranging from 30% to 80%. Better matching of labor supply (skills training programs) with demand is \nneeded to improve employment rates of trainees. Improved identification of potential areas of income \ngeneration in communities and linkages with posttraining services will increase the likelihood of success \nfor self-employment activities. Increasing access to market-oriented, short-term skills training will provide \nmany of the poor and the disadvantaged with increased opportunities for earning income. \n \nIn a study by the Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation (SDC)  (2003), over 90% of the workers in \nthe survey who traveled for international work are \u201csimply literate.\u201d Workers who were literate or with grade \n1 to 5 education were offered about NRs12,000 per month on average. In comparison, skilled construction \nworkers in Nepal\u2019s urban areas are paid about  NRs200 per day, while unskilled workers receive about \nNRs100 per day (just over a dollar per day).     \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                     Proposed Classification:  Targeted Intervention \n                                                                         Inclusive Social Development, Gender and Development \n \nPoverty  in  Nepal  is  a  deep-rooted  and  complex  phenomenon.  After  the  political  change  of  1990,  \nthe economy and government actions have largely failed to fulfill earlier expectations about poverty \nreduction. Wide disparities persist in income distribution due to gender discrimination, social exclusion, \nand lack of access to employment opportunities, particularly for the poor, Dalits (low caste), and ethnic \nminority groups. The expanding young population is subjected to unemployment and underemployment, \nand are vulnerable to forced recruitment in the conflict. The poverty ratio declined modestly from 42% at \nthe beginning of the Ninth Plan to about 38% in 2000/01. Since then, given the sharp decline (by about \n3%) in per capita  income  during 2001/02  due  to  continued  disruptions  to   investment   and   economic   \n \n ", "Appendix 12  55\nactivities caused by ongoing conflict, the poverty situation in rural areas has likely deteriorated significantly \nover the last 2 years (2002/04). The progress achieved  in human development  during the Ninth Plan \nperiod as measured by key indicators, is encouraging in areas including life expectancy, infant mortality, \nmaternal mortality, total fertility, and overall population growth rate. However, in other areas including \npercentage of the population living below the poverty line, adult literacy, women's literacy, net primary \nschool enrollment, and percentage of the population supplied with drinking water, progress has been less \nimpressive.  \n \nThe current economic situation is weak. The recent sociopolitical turmoil  is one of the major factors \ncontributing to this economic decline. As a consequence of increasing poverty, including lack of food \nsufficiency and lack of employment in many parts of the country, a growing number of people are \nmigrating to India and other countries for work. However, many lack the relevant skills to be competitive \nand receive higher wages in international labor markets. \n \nThe  poverty  analysis  based  on  the  1995/96  household  survey  data  indicates  wide  variations  by \nurbanization level, ecological zones, development regions, gender, disability, ethnicity, and caste groups. \nPoverty in Nepal is largely a rural phenomenon with wide variations within rural areas itself. The poverty \nrate is highest in the more remote rural areas\u2014the Midwestern and Far Western hills and Mountain \nregions where it is as high as 72%. The rural Midwestern and Far Western lowland regions are also much \npoorer (53% incidence) than the national average. In terms of ecological zones, poverty in the Mountain \nregion is much higher in comparison with others.  \n \nHouseholds headed by women were poorer than those headed my men. In the 1995/96 household survey, \nhouseholds headed by women constituted 13% of all households at the national level; this number is likely \nto have increased significantly due to the ongoing conflict. Nepal has 13 districts\u2014mostly in the mountains \nand more remote hill areas (which have high male migration)\u2014in which the ratio of households headed by \nwomen to those by men was found to be higher than 20%, which again is likely to have increased due to \nthe conflict. Women's active participation in paid employment is limited\u2014currently women constitute only a \nthird of the total paid labor force. Moreover, when women enter the labor market, their wages even for the \nsame type of work continue to be lower than men's. Females of all age-groups have to work more hours \nthan males. This difference is more prominent in rural areas than in urban. Nepal has made significant \nprogress in increasing female life expectancy. Improvements are also visible in female literacy levels, and \nprimary and secondary school completion rates. However, large gender gaps remain in these indicators. \n \nNepal has several indigenous ethnic (Janajatis) and caste (Dalits) groups, which have been historically \npolitically, economically, and socially excluded. They continue to lag far behind in income and assets \nlevels, educational achievements, human development indicators, and in representation in the power \nstructure. Although discrimination in any form has been prohibited by the Constitution of Nepal since 1963, \nthe lowest hierarchy of Hindu caste system, the Dalit, is synonymous to \u201cimpure and untouchable\u201d castes \nand are discriminated against. They are mainly people with specific lower level jobs such as cobbler, iron-\nsmith, and tailor. They have a high incidence of poverty. Badi (mostly so-called prostitute women living in \nMidwestern and Far Western regions) are also considered as Dalits and almost all are very poor. Another \nparticular group of people, a majority of whom are poverty stricken, are the ex-Kamaiyas who  were \nrecently freed from a form of bonded labor. About 4% to 10% of people in Nepal are estimated to have \nsome form of disability; many are living under acute poverty. \n         \nC.   Participation Process \n   \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nParticipatory consultations were held during the implementation phase of the project preparatory technical \nassistance.  The  Technical  Assistance  Steering  Committee  included  representatives  from Council for \nTechnical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT) and other line ministries providing training Ministry \nof  Industries,  Commerce,  and  Supplies  (MOICS)  and  Ministry  of  Labor  and  Transport  Management \n(MOLTM), private employers, private training providers, and social welfare council. The team undertook ", "56   Appendix 12 \nconsultations in Biratnagar, Janakpur, Kathmandu Valley, Nepalgunj, and Pokhara;  while field workers \nvisited Dang, Dolakha, Kavre, Lukla, Nawalparasi, Rupendehi, Sarlahi, and Siraha. Various stakeholders \nwere met, including community representatives, not only from these groups but also from women, Dalits, \nand  other  disadvantaged  groups,  and  the  disabled.  Skills  training  needs  for  self-employment  were \nunderscored by rural residents. Potential areas for skills training in rural areas include bicycle/rickshaw \nrepair, house wiring, plumbing, small motor maintenance and repair, and handicrafts; in urban areas the \nopportunities extend to radio and television repair, garment making, carpentry and masonry; barber/beauty \nparlor work, computer repair, and air-conditioning repair. Where there is tourism, potential areas for self-\nemployment include cooking and managing a lodge. These are indicative only as the needs in each area \ncan considerably vary. Other development partners were also consulted. The ongoing policy development \nactivity  also  examined  the  stakeholders  of  the  TEVT  system  and  established  a  policy  coordination \ncommittee consisting of representatives of over 20 stakeholders.  \n \nDuring  project  implementation,  CTEVT,  MOICS,  and  MOLTM  will  receive  capacity  strengthening \nassistance to increase access to short-term skills training to poor and marginalized  groups, and  to \nincrease the relevance and improve the quality of training. MOICS will be additionally strengthened in its \nliaison role with communities to improve its coordination with communities, and more effectively identify \nand  provide  skills  training  to  target  groups  according  to  available  resources  and  opportunities. \nNongovernment organizations (NGOs) will be employed in community mobilization to identify community \nresources  and  opportunities,  and  prioritize  training  needs.  Community  groups,  especially  those \nrepresenting women and the disadvantaged, will be particularly consulted in the selection of trainees from \ntheir respective constituencies.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?                    Yes                   No          \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe Government has taken steps to improve the status of women, e.g., repeal of some discriminatory laws \nagainst women and establishment of the National Women\u2019s Commission, and progress is being made in \nsome human development indicators for women. However, much remains to be done. The Tenth Plan \nrecognizes the need to establish the effective role of women in national economic and social development \nand puts forward specific gender-mainstreaming strategies.  \n         \nThe Project supports the goals of the Tenth Plan and aims to improve the labor productivity of Nepalese, \nincluding women and disadvantaged groups, by increasing access to relevant and quality market-oriented, \nshort-term skills training. The beneficiaries of the Project include women and disadvantaged groups.  \nThe design of the Project includes the following measures to address gender issues: \n(i)  Women, Dalits, and members of disadvantaged groups will comprise at least 60% of the \ntrainees in community-articulated skills training programs. At least 50% of all trainees will \nbe women. \n(ii)  Women-friendly, market-oriented, short-term skills training programs will be developed \nand delivered.  \n(iii)  The Project Steering Committee will include at least three women members.  \n(iv)  Training instructors to be given training will include at least 10% women. \n(v)  Women, as well as men, will be trained in community mobilization. \n(vi)  Gender-disaggregated monitoring indicators and database will be included in the project \nmanagement information system.  \n(vii)  A  gender,  caste, and ethnicity  (GCE)  consultant in training and employment will be \nincluded in the consulting services to develop a gender action plan based on the,GCE \nstrategy and to guide the project implementation unit  in implementing, monitoring, and \nevaluation. \n ", "Appendix 12  57\n \nHas an output been prepared?
