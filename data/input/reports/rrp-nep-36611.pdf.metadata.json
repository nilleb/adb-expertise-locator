The  Project  will  support  the  goals  of  the \nTenth  Plan  (the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy)   by   \n(i)  supporting  the  delivery  of  market-oriented,  short-term  (MOST) \ntraining,  particularly  to  women,  Dalits  (low  caste),  and  the \ndisadvantaged;  (ii)  strengthening  the  capacity  to  facilitate  and \ndeliver  short-term  training; while  (iii)  articulating in parallel a new \ntechnical education and vocational training (TEVT) policy.  \n \nNepal  faces  a  complex  development  setting  of  conflict  and \npolitical instability.  The  underlying  causes  of  the  conflict  include \npoverty and its manifestations in terms of regional, gender, ethnic, \nand caste-related inequalities; inadequate governance; and failure \nto  deliver  adequate  and  essential  social  services  and  facilities  to \nrural communities and marginalized groups. The need is urgent to \naddress  chronic  poverty  and  social  exclusion,  achieve  high \neconomic  growth  to  improve  living  conditions,  and  achieve  a \nlasting  solution  to  the  conflict.  In  its  poverty  reduction  strategy,   \nthe  Government  recognizes  the  urgency  and  seriousness  of  the \nconflict situation and the role of poverty, and emphasizes the need \nfor  economic  growth,  social  sector  development,  social  inclusion \nprograms, and good governance. \n \nNepal\u2019s slow growth in recent years, high unemployment rate, and \nlarge proportion of the population living below the poverty line call \nfor measures to increase the potential for employment and income \ngeneration.  With \nformal  sector  employment  not  expanding, \ninformal  self-\nincome  generation  are \nfor \nopportunities \nemployment   and   international  labor  markets  where  Nepalese  \nworkers  are  in  demand.  However,  at  present,  Nepalese  lack  the \nnecessary  skills  to  take  advantage  of  these  opportunities,  to  be \nmore   competitive   locally,  and   to  engage   in  self-employment \n\nin \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nrequired \n\ntraining.  New  measures  are \n\nactivities.  Access  to  skills  training  is  limited,  especially  for  the \npoor, women,  Dalits,  and  disadvantaged,  and  the  quality  of  skills \ntraining is variable and often not linked to market needs.  Overall, \nexisting  institutions  lack  the  capacity  to  fully  serve  the  needs  of \nto \nshort-term  skill \nsubstantially increase the number of people who acquire skills that \nlead  to  incomes.  Strengthening  the  vocational  training  sector  to \ndeliver  more  relevant  and  MOST  training,  and  supporting  the \nprovision of more of these programs is one such measure.  \n \nThe  goal  of  the  Project  is  to  promote  poverty  reduction  and \nstability  by  increasing  engagement  in  wage  and  international \nemployment  and  self-employment.  The  purpose  is  to  increase \nopportunities  for  MOST  skill  training  by  improving  the  relevance \nand  increasing  the  delivery  of  MOST  skill  training, particularly to \nwomen, Dalits, and the disadvantaged.  \n \nThe  Project  aims  to  (i)  increase  access  to  MOST  skills training, \nparticularly  by  women,  Dalits,  and \nthe  disadvantaged;  \n(ii)  strengthen  the  capacity  of  key  agencies  to  enhance  their \nservices  to  the  short-term  training  sector  and  hence  improve \nrelevance  and  quality;  (iii)  strengthen  training  providers  to \nenhance access and improve the relevance and quality of training; \nand  (iv)  develop  and  articulate  a  new  policy  to  achieve  greater \nintegration,  coordination,  relevance,  and  efficiency  in  the  TEVT \nsector. \n \nThe  total  Project  cost  is  estimated  at  $25.0 million  equivalent, \nincluding  physical  contingency  and  price  escalation,  taxes  and \nduties, and interest charges, of which $2.3 million (9%) comprises \nthe foreign exchange cost and $22.7 million equivalent (91%) the \nlocal  currency  cost.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will \nfinance  80%  of  the  project  cost;  including  100%  of  the  foreign \nexchange  cost  and  78%  of \nlocal  currency  cost.  \nThe Government will provide $5.0 million equivalent (20%).  \n \n\nthe \n\nSource \n\n \n\nADB \nGovernment \nTotal \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n \n 2.3  \n 0.0  \n 2.3  \n\n \n 17.7  \n 5.0  \n 22.7  \n\n \n 20.0  \n 5.0  \n 25.0  \n\nADB= Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates . \n\n($ million) \nPercent \n\n \n  80 \n20 \n100 \n\n \n\niv \n\n \n\nObjective \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  SDR13,615,000  ($20 million  equivalent)  from  the \nSpecial  Funds  resources  of  ADB  will  be  provided.

Community-based  training  will  be \nimplemented  in  the  districts  through  the  Department  of  Cottage \nand  Small  Industries  (DCSI)  and  Cottage  and  Small  Industries \nDevelopment  Board  (CSIDB)  district  offices.  A  district  steering \ncommittee  will  be  established.  For  policy  development  and \narticulation,  the  existing  committees\u2014the  Policy  Coordination \nCommittee, the Policy Steering Committee, and the Core Working \nGroup\u2014will continue their respective roles. \n \nCTEVT  will  undertake  the  procurement  of  goods  and  services \nfinanced  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement reflecting ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy and mandatory \nuse of ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents. \n \nThe selection and engagement of all  project-financed  consulting \nservices  will  be  in  accordance  with  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection  using ADB\u2019s Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of \ndomestic consultants. A team of consultants to provide services in \na  range  of  specialties  with  estimated  international  inputs  of  21 \nperson-months  and  domestic  inputs  of  66  person-months  is \nplanned. These services will be provided by  individual consultants \nand  consulting  firms,  and  will  be  selected  according  to  ADB \nguidelines.  In  addition,  nongovernment  organizations  in  the \ndistricts  will  be  contracted  to  undertake  training  needs  analysis, \nbeneficiary mapping, and identification of trainees. \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nin \n\ninclusion \n\ninstitutions, \n\nis  expected \n\nthrough  skills \n\nissues  among \n\nfor  self-employment \n\ntrainee  beneficiaries \n\nThe  Project  supports  national  efforts  for  poverty  reduction  and \nstability,  especially \nthe  current  conflict.  \nthe  context  of \nThe  Project  aims  to  improve  access  to  employment  or  self-\nemployment \nfor  women,  socially  excluded  Dalits,  and \ndisadvantaged  groups,  as  well  as  poor  socioeconomic  groups  in \ngeneral. The Project targets the poor and will have at least 60% of \nthe \nrepresenting  women,  Dalits,  or \ndisadvantaged  groups,  while  ensuring  that  at  least  50%  are \nwomen  and  at  least  25%  are  Dalit.  This  targeting  by  social \ngrouping,  as  well  as  awareness-raising  of  gender  equity  and \nsocial \nto \ncontribute to conflict resolution efforts, by addressing some of the \nprimary root causes, i.e., poverty and social exclusion.  \n \nThe main project benefits include (i) more skilled Nepalese able to \ngain local and international employment, (ii) more Nepalese given \ntraining,  \nthe  opportunity \n(iii)  increased  market-relevance  and  improved  quality  of  short-\nterm  training  programs,  and  (iv)  increased  in-country capacity to \ndevelop and deliver MOST skill training. The direct beneficiaries of \nthe  Project  will  be  (i)  the  unemployed  and underemployed  who \nwould  like  to  gain  skills  for  employment  and  income  generation, \nparticularly  women,  Dalits,  and  the  disadvantaged;  (ii)  various \nministries  supporting  short-term  training;  and  (iii)  CTEVT  and \npublic  and  private  training  providers.  About  80,000  trainees  will \ndirectly benefit from skills training under the Project. \n \nWith  improvements  in  relevance  and  quality  of  skill  training \nprograms, and increasing access to short-term training programs, \nthe  Project  will  generate  increases  in  labor  productivity  that  will \nincrease  the  competitiveness  of  Nepalese  locally  and  abroad.   \nThis  should  increase  their  probability  of  employment,  shorten  job \nsearch time, and increase offered wages. As some training will be \noriented to international work, remittances from employed trainees \nwill contribute to the national income and reduce pressures on the \nbalance  of  payments.  Increased  incomes  from  employment  also \nhave  economywide  multiplier  effects,  as  they  are  spent  on \nconsumer  goods,  house  construction,  and  education,  among \nothers. \n \nA  national  TEVT  policy  will  reduce  fragmentation  and  duplication \nof  training  activities  by  introducing  nationally  agreed  coordination \nmechanisms  that  allocate  clear-cut  roles,  responsibilities,  and \njurisdictions to training providers. CTEVT\u2019s capacity to coordinate \nacross  ministerial  lines  and  with  employers,  to  serve  the  TEVT \nsector, and for quality assurance will be enhanced. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n \n \n \n\n \n\nvii \n\nrisks \n\nto  achieving \n\nrepresent  major \n\nthe \nfine-tuning \n\n \nThe  uncertain  security  situation  and  political  instability  in  the \ncountry \nthe  Project\u2019s \ndevelopment  goals.  Although  project  implementation  is  slow  in \nconflict-affected  areas,  projects  aimed  at  training  are  generally \nfavorably  received.  Project  design  incorporates  lessons  learned \nfrom  implementation  in  Nepal\u2019s  conflict  areas, including ensuring \nadequate community participation and targeting beneficiaries who \nare women, Dalits, or from disadvantaged groups. Implementation \nwill  be  phased  and  lessons  learned  during  implementation, \nfirst  year  of  skills-training  activities,  \nparticularly  during \nwill  contribute \nimplementation  arrangements, \nto \nprocedures, and criteria. \n \nTo  coordinate activities within the training sector with a common \npurpose  and  comparable  outcomes,  the  Project  supports  the \ndevelopment  of  a  new  national  TEVT  policy  and  framework  and \ninvolves a wide stakeholder consultation process. Project support \nis also extended to interministerial and multistakeholder activities, \nincluding standards and curriculum workshops.  \n \nThe  Project  aims  to  improve  the  quality  of  short-term  training,  \nnot  only  within  the  public  sector  but  also in the private sector by \nproviding training to trainers, training supervisors, and senior staff. \nTo  boost  the  attendance  of  participants  from  private  providers,   \nthe  Project  will  publicize  the  training  among  the  providers.  \nIn addition, the training  will  be  implemented  across  the  country, \nbringing it closer to prospective participants.   \n \nThe  success  of  the  Project  in  meeting  its  goal  depends  on  the \nincreased ability of the training recipients to enter employment or \nself-employment,  or  generate  income  as  a  result  of  skills \ndevelopment training. The Project will build the capacity of training \nproviders to identify posttraining support services, including linking \nwith  employers,  marketers,  and  nongovernment  and  community-\nbased organizations. \n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Kingdom  of  Nepal  for  the  Skills  for  Employment  Project.1 The  project  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n \nNepal  faces  a  complex  development  setting  of  conflict  and  political  instability.  \n2. \nThe underlying causes of the conflict include poverty and its manifestations in terms of regional, \ngender,  ethnic,  and  caste-related  inequalities;  inadequate  governance;  and  failure  to  deliver \nadequate  and  essential  social  services  and  facilities  to  rural  communities  and  marginalized \ngroups. Urgently needed are measures to address the chronic poverty and social exclusion, and \nachieve high economic growth to improve living conditions and achieve a lasting solution to the \nconflict.2  The  Tenth  Plan,3  which  is  also  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy, \nemphasizes economic growth, social sector development, social inclusion programs, and good \ngovernance. The plan articulates the seriousness and urgency of the conflict situation and the \nrole  of  poverty.  Disadvantaged  groups  are  targeted  for  greater  participation  in  development, \nincluding  gaining  basic  education  and  skills  training  for  self-employment,  and  wage  and \ninternational  employment.  Greater  emphasis  is  also  to  be  given  to  encouraging  out-of-country \nemployment.  \n \n3. \nThe Country Strategy and Program for Nepal  for 2005\u20132009 of the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  (footnote  2)  supports  the  implementation  of  the  Tenth  Plan  and  focuses  on \npromoting  broad-based  and  inclusive  social  and  economic  development  to  contribute  to \nsustainable  poverty  reduction  and  help  reduce  social  tensions.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  Nepal \nfocuses on three areas that include  supporting  inclusive  social  and  human  development  and \nempowering  the  poor  and  disadvantaged  by  providing  basic  education  and  vocational  training \nneeded to increase productivity and generate remunerative employment. \n \nA. \n \n4. \nLandlocked,  Nepal  is  the  12th  poorest  country  in  the  world.  In  2001  its gross domestic \nproduct  per  capita  was  $241,  the  lowest  in  the  South  Asia  region.  Its  population  stood  at   \n23.2  million,  with  a  population  growth  rate  of  about  2.4%.  About  38%  live  in  poverty.  \nThe population is relatively young with children under 15 years constituting the dominant group \n(43%).  The  majority,  87%  of  the  population,  live  in  rural  areas.  The  country  has at  least 35 \nethnic  and  36  caste  groups  who  speak  different  languages  and  a  number  of  dialects as their \nmother tongue. Nepal\u2019s economic performance is poor with low potential for improvement in the \nmedium term. The economy is still predominantly based on agriculture, which comprises about \n40% of the gross domestic product. Manufacturing contributes 8% and services account for the \nrest.  Agriculture  production  fluctuates  from  year  to  year,  and  is  heavily  dependent  on  the \nmonsoon.  The  Central  Region  is  the  most  developed,  followed  by  the  Eastern,  Western, \nMidwestern, and Far Western regions.4 \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n3  National Planning Commission, Government of Nepal. 2003. The Tenth Plan (Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper) \n\n2002\u20132007. Kathmandu. \n\n4  Administratively, the country is divided into five development regions (Eastern, Central, Western, Midwestern, and \nFar  Western), 14  zones, 75 districts ,  3,912  village  development  committees , and 58 municipalities including one \nmetropolitan and four submetropolitan cities. \n\n\f 2\n\n \nThe Labor Market. More than 92% of the employed labor force work in rural areas, 81% \n5. \nin subsistence agriculture. The total unemployment rate is estimated at 17.4%, which is largely \naccounted  for  by  underemployment.5  Of  the  9.5  million  workforce,  only  1.5  million  (16%)  are \nengaged  in  paid  employment;  the  remaining  8  million  are  self-employed,  with  about  4  million \nworking as unpaid family workers.  The major sectors for formal employment are manufacturing, \nconstruction,  retail  sales,  and  hotels  and  restaurants.  Government,  public  corporations,  and \nregistered private companies are the major formal sector employers, and comprise the majority \nof  employers  of  technicians,  clerks,  and  higher  salaried  occupations.  Foreigners  hold  7.2%  of \nthe jobs in Nepal.  The porous border with India allows many Indians to work in Nepal and  vice \nversa. Indian workers are  given preference in construction work, as they are considered more \nskilled, more experienced, and more reliable than Nepalese.6 \n \nEvery  year,  about 200,000  new workers  enter  the  labor  market.  The  majority  have no \n6. \nschool  leaving  certificate  (SLC)  and  are  thus  not  eligible  for  many  formal  sector  jobs. \nOpportunities  for  new  employment  in  the  formal  sector  are  limited  because  of  the  slow \neconomic  growth,  and  the  small  share  of  and  required  qualifications  for  formal  sector \nemployment.  In  response,  many  Nepalese  explore work opportunities  outside of  the  country, \nincluding  India.  The  majority  are  engaged  in  informal  work.  During  project  preparation \nconsultations, many groups  asked  for  opportunities  to  engage  in  or  increase  their  incomes  in \ninformal  sector  work,  including  self-employment.  Remittances  from  the  estimated  1  million \nNepalese  working  abroad  contribute about  25%  of  the  gross  domestic  product.  In  2001/02, \nabout 105,000 left the country for foreign employment under formal arrangements. The greatest \ndemands  were  for  unskilled,  semiskilled,  and  skilled  labor  in  service,  construction,  and  metal \nand machine operator occupations.  According  to  one  study,7  the majority of  migrant workers \nhave not completed their basic education, and most can best be described as literate. The same \nstudy  reported  that  semiskilled  and  skilled  workers  working  outside  of  the  country  in  2003 \nreceived  an  average  monthly  salary  of  NRs23,300.  Locally,  monthly  wages  of  skilled  labor in \nconstruction in urban areas is about NRs6,000. Of the requests by international employers for \n100,000  Nepalese workers in 2003,  only half of  the demand  was filled. The majority of unfilled \nrequests were for semiskilled and skilled workers\u2014Nepalese lack the appropriate skills.  \n \nEducation.  With  the  Government's  commitment  to  achieve  the  goals  set  in  the \n7. \nEducation  for  All and  the  Millenium  Development  Goals,  enrollment  in  primary  education  has \nbeen increasing. As of 2001, the net enrollment rate was 81% in the primary grades and 39% in \nsecondary  grades.  However,  the  education  system  is  characterized  by  high  dropout  rates,  \nlow quality, and  differences across gender and castes.  Many students are unable to complete \ntheir education. Students typically sit for the  SLC examination at the end of  grade  10; in 2001, \nthe  pass  rate  was  about  32%.  The  high  dropout  rate  and  low  pass  rate  mean  that  many \nstudents leave school without an education certificate. After schooling, opportunities for gaining \nskills for employment are limited.  \n \n8. \nTechnical  Education  and  Vocational  Training  Sector. The  technical education and \nvocational  training  (TEVT)  sector  offers  both  long-term  technical  education  and  short-term \ntraining vocational training (Appendix  2). Technical education requires grade 10 qualification or \nan SLC pass, while vocational training does not. In the public sector,  several ministries provide \ntraining; some offer training along sector lines. The estimated national total training capacity is \n\n                                                 \n5  Ministry of Finance, Government of Nepal. 2003. Economic Survey 2003.

CTEVT is tasked with providing support and \nservices  to  both  public  and  private  training  providers,  and  ensuring  the  quality  of  basic and \nmiddle  level  TEVT.  CTEVT  also  administers  several  training  institutions  that  offer  diploma \nprograms  and  mostly  technical  SLCs  (TSLCs).  Several  privately  run  institutions  are  affiliated \nwith  CTEVT  and  offer  its  TSLC  curriculum.  CTEVT  has  established  annex  schools  in  \n15 districts, offering mainly technical education programs. Tribhuvan University offers programs \nleading to technician qualifications.  \n \n9. \nShort-term training is offered by the Department of Cottage and Small Industries (DCSI); \nCottage and Small Industry Development Board (CSIDB) of the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, \nand  Supplies;  Department  of  Labor  and  Employment  Promotion  (DOLEP);  and  CTEVT \ninstitutions. Training programs are at most 6 months long. Through the district office networks of \nDCSI and CSIDB,  the  Ministry  of  Industry,  Commerce,  and  Supplies has a presence in every \ndistrict. DOLEP operates skills training centers and technical schools throughout Nepal. Private \ntraining providers, including those affiliated with CTEVT, also provide short-term training.  \n \nB. \n \nFor the numerous Nepalese who have left school without an SLC pass and marketable \n10. \nskills,  and  are  unemployed,  training  is  necessary  to  avail  of  income-earning opportunities and \nmove out of poverty. To take advantage of available jobs abroad, to be more competitive locally, \nand  to  engage  in  self-employment  activities,  greater  access  to  relevant  and  effective  skills \ntraining  programs  is  required.  However,  the  TEVT  sector,  and  particularly  vocational  training,  \nis confronted with several issues in meeting this requirement.  \n \n11. \nInadequate Access to Training. The TEVT sector in Nepal performs poorly in terms of \nproviding  access  to  training,  particularly  market-oriented  short-term  (MOST)  skills  training.  \nMost  people,  particularly  the  poor  and  disadvantaged,  lack  access  to  skills  training  that \nenhances  earning  capacity.  About  200,000  people  seek  to  enter  the  labor  market  each  year. \nYet, in the 1998  census, only 403,000 of a total working age population of 11 million indicated \nreceiving  some  form  of  training.  No  more  than  50,000  a  year  currently  have  access  to  skills \ntraining.  TSLC  programs  run  by  CTEVT,  which  require  10  years  of  schooling,  cannot  be \naccessed  by  most,  particularly  the  poor,  women,  Dalits  (low  caste),  and  members  of \ndisadvantaged  groups  because  of  their  lower  educational  achievement.  Short-term  training \nprograms  linked  to  available  jobs  are  not  readily  available  and  are  mainly  offered  in a limited \nmanner by CTEVT and private providers in large urban areas, which are difficult to access for \nthose living  in distant areas.  Even  if  training  were  provided  free  of  charge,  attendance would \nmean that the poor must forgo daily wages. \n \n12. \nPoor Relevance of Training. The public TEVT system is largely supply-driven. Training \nprograms  are  often  based  on  the  allocated  budgets  of  public  training  providers,  and  available \nstaff and equipment. Training needs assessment (TNA) is weak and often absent; the available \nlabor  market  information  system  is  unable  to  provide  up-to-date  labor  market  data  to  assist \ntraining  program  selection.  The  outcomes  of  both  rarely  guide  the  selection  of  skills  and \ncontents, with the consequence that offered courses and their contents are regularly irrelevant \nto needs and demands. Linkages between educational institutions and industry are inadequate \nand have led to a lack of mutual cooperation. Thus, training institutions are often not fully aware \n\n                                                 \n8  World Bank estimate. \n\n\f 4\n\nof  the  needs  of  industry  nor  are  they  able  to  fully  explore  ways  industry  can  help,  such  as \nthrough on-the-job training programs. \n \n13. \nTraining  programs  have  not  yet  significantly  refocused  on  the  emerging  needs  of  the \nlabor  market.  While  the  major  potential  sources  of  employment and  income generation are in \nthe informal/self-employment and foreign employment sectors,  training for these is insufficient. \nTo improve the relevance of programs, training providers need to make a better determination \nof  trainees\u2019  and  employers\u2019  needs,  and  analyze  communities\u2019  economic  opportunities.  \nThe  larger  public  training  providers  need  to  provide  more  MOST  skills  training  programs  for \nthose  who  have  less  than  SLC .  The  participation  of  communities,  through  community-based \norganizations (CBOs) and nongovernment organizations (NGOs),  will facilitate the process of \nidentifying and implementing programs in communities.  \n \nLow Quality of Training. In addition to being poorly identified, some training programs \n14. \nare  poorly  designed  and/or  poorly  delivered.  Curricula  are  not  sufficiently  regularly  revised  to \nreflect changing market demands. Training providers focus on delivering content, as specified in \ntheir curriculum, and not on achieving the performance expected  for employment, as specified \nin  skills  and  training  standards.  Trainers,  in  turn,  have  no  benchmarks  to  measure  their  own \ntechnical and instructional capability, and thus have no means of determining the gap between \ntheir  current  performance  and  their  desired  capability.  Performance  specifications,  or  skills \nstandards, are needed as benchmarks for delivery and assessment. Many instructors, including \nthose  employed  by  private  providers,  have  no  training  in  instructional  techniques  and  no \nextensive technical expertise; they are rarely upgraded.  Public training institutions have limited \nbudgets,  not  allowing  them  to  train  staff.  Most  public  provider  sites  lack  tools,  equipment, \nmaterials, and supplies.  Monitoring  of  the  quality  of  training  programs  needs  to  be  improved. \nThe present  CTEVT  accreditation system  needs to be  more  informative  and  transparent, and \nexpanded to include emerging short-term programs, especially those aimed at foreign demand.  \n \nLack  of  Posttraining  Support.  Many  TEVT  providers  focus  solely  on  training  rather \n15. \nthan  training  outcomes.  Most  do  not  provide  posttraining support, e.g., career placement and \ncounseling.  Such  support  is  particularly  critical  in  training  for  self-employment  as  linkages \nshould be provided to economic opportunities, e.g., jobs and microfinance programs.  Providers \nneed to be trained to provide or link to such services. \n \n16. \nNeed  for  TEVT  Coordination.  The  TEVT  sector  is  highly  fragmented.  Although  a \nnational TEVT policy was approved in 1999 by the CTEVT  Assembly, this is not adhered to by \nall  stakeholders.  Skills  development  is  organized  by  government  ministries  (and  within \nministries, by departments ), NGOs, aid projects, and, to some extent, local initiatives. The roles \nof the various stakeholders of the TEVT system have not been clearly defined and organized. \nAlthough CTEVT is the apex agency for TEVT policy coordination, the expansion of the number \nof  training  institutions  under  its  administration  has  resulted  in  it  focusing  on  training  delivery \nrather than on its role as an apex organization. It has been unable to provide an integrating role \nfor  the  whole  system  of  TEVT  provision.  Most  TEVT-related  decisions  on  issues, including \nTEVT policy, allocation of resources, and system management, are made at the central level of \nCTEVT and within each of the respective line ministries with little consultation and participation \nof  key  stakeholders  such  as  the  private  sector  and  local  communities.  Most training providers \nwork  to  their  own  benchmarks  and  curricula;  outcomes  are variable.  Consequently,  agencies \nhave  no  common  purpose  or  comparable  outcomes.  Coordination  between  their  respective \nprograms is limited, leading to duplication of activities, e.g., development of curricula and skills \nstandards,  and,  therefore,  wastage  of  already  scarce  resources.  Information  relating  to  labor \ndemand and the TEVT subsector, including training program information, trainees, and program \nefficiency  and  effectiveness,  are  scarce.  Moreover,  government  funding  for  training  to  each \n\n\f \n\n \n\n                  \n\n5\n\npublic agency is based on the needs of the given department rather than the priorities within the \ntraining  market.  Incentives  and  rewards  for  well-performing  institutions  are  lacking,  as  are \nsanctions for nonperforming institutions. \n \n17. \nLessons Learned. ADB's past experiences with TEVT, including the last TEVT project \nin Nepal,9 highlight issues related to infrastructure utilization and increasing the level of training \nwith existing resources. CTEVT has been unable to significantly expand the provision of training \ndelivery  beyond  the  life  of  the  project  because  of  lack  of  resources.  The attention to service \ndelivery  has  resulted  in  fewer  resources  available  to  enhance  its  standing  as  a  coordinating \nbody. Experience with this project also emphasizes the need for CTEVT to refocus its direction \nto strengthen the TEVT sector as a whole, and thus perform a key strategic role, and reduce its \nattention  to  training  delivery,  which  can  be  undertaken  by  many  other  training  providers. \nSimilarly,  the  Ministry  of  Industry,  Commerce,  and  Supplies  must  develop  the  capability  to \nfacilitate training undertaken by private providers rather than necessarily delivering all training.  \n \n18. \nIn the international arena, the development of national frameworks such as qualification \nframeworks  and  skills standards,  when  adequately  contextualized  to  the  country,  have  served \nas  powerful  mechanisms  to  gain  consistency  of  approach  and  drive  a  demand-focused \napproach.10 Experiences of some development partners in Nepal have shown that training alone \nis  insufficient  to  gain  self-employment.  Too  much  training  occurs  without  any  employment \noutcomes. A holistic approach needs to be adopted that combines TNA,  which identifies skills \nneeds as well as product markets; selection of trainees who are most likely to be entrepreneurs; \nwhere  appropriate,  delivery  of  quality  training  linked  to  employment  demand;  and  posttraining \nservices.  Successful  outcomes  from  training  are  more  likely  to  occur  within  social  partnership \narrangements.  A  strong  relationship  is needed  (i)  between  training  providers  and  the  funding \nauthority,  which  leads  to  mutual  learning  and  ongoing  capacity  development  of  the  training \nprovider; and (ii) between training providers, communities, and special interest groups.  \n \nExperiences  with  other  projects  show  a  slower  pace  of  implementation  in  conflict-\n19. \naffected  areas;  however,  projects  aimed  at  training  are  generally  received  favorably.  Lessons \nlearned from project implementation in conflict-affected areas of Nepal point to several factors \nthat  contribute  to  success,  including  (i)  the  degree  to  which  the  project  benefits  the \ncommunities, (ii) the transparency of budgets and resource allocations, (iii) a politically neutral \nstance,  (iv)  a  participatory  approach  that  involves  local  communities,  and (v) a decentralized \napproach to implementation.  \n \nExternal  Assistance  and  Aid  Coordination.  External  assistance  to  education  has \n20. \nbeen increasing. Between FY1997/98 and 2001/02, of the NRs49 trillion education and training \nexpenditures, 18% were from foreign loans and grants\u2014 the majority supported basic education \nactivities. Development partners include ADB, World Bank,  Swiss Agency for Development and \nCooperation (SDC), Danish International Development Assistance, Department for International \nDevelopment,  European  Union,  Finland,  Japan,  Norway,  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme, and  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund. Past external assistance to TEVT  has  been \nfrom  ADB,  World  Bank,  SDC,  and  international  NGOs.  SDC  has  been  providing  technical \nassistance  to  CTEVT,  including  support  for  the  Training  Institute  for  Technical  Instruction.  \nSDC is supporting short-term  training  delivery  and  the  development  of  a  national  skills  testing \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB.  1989.

The  purpose  is to \nincrease opportunities for MOST skills training by improving the relevance of and increasing the \ndelivery  of  MOST  skills  training,  particularly  to  women,  Dalits,  and  the  disadvantaged.  \nThe  Project  aims  to  (i)  increase  access  to  MOST  skills  training,  particularly  by  women,  Dalits, \nand the disadvantaged; (ii) strengthen the capacity of key agencies to enhance their services, \nparticularly  to  the  vocational  training  sector,  and  hence  improve  relevance  and  quality;  \n(iii)  strengthen  training  providers  to  enhance  access  and  improve  the  relevance  and  quality  of \ntraining;  and  (iv)  develop  and  articulate  a  new  national  policy  to  achieve  greater  integration, \nrelevance,  and  efficiency  in  the  TEVT  sector.  The  Project  will  serve  beneficiaries  from  all \ndistricts of the country.  \n \nB.  \n \n22. \nThe  Project will support the goals of the  Tenth Plan  by  assisting the delivery of  MOST \ntraining,  particularly  to  women,  Dalits,  and  the  disadvantaged;  strengthening  the  capacity  to \nfacilitate and deliver short-term training;  and helping articulate a new TEVT policy. The Project \ncomprises  three  components:  (i)  increasing  access  to  MOST  skills  training,  (ii)  capacity \nstrengthening, and (iii) supporting policy development, articulation, and implementation. \n \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nIncreasing Access to Market-Oriented, Short-Term Skills Training \n\n \n23. \nThis component provides support to increase the delivery of and access to MOST skills \ntraining, particularly  to  the  poor.  The  Project  targets  the  poor  to  receive  subsidized  training. \nOverall,  at least  60% of the  trainees will be women,  Dalits,  or  disadvantaged\u2014ensuring  that \n50%  of  all  trainees  are  women and  25% are  Dalits.  The  Project  will  provide  about  80,000 \nbeneficiaries with access to short-term training.  \n \n\na. \n\nDisseminating Information on Short-Term Training and Employment \n\n \n24. \nThe Project will support the development and implementation of a TEVT awareness plan \nemploying  the  mass  media.  An  information  dissemination  plan  for  skills  training  activities  and \nresources in districts will be developed and implemented in districts and wards using a network \nof  government  and  nongovernment  groups.  The  gender,  caste,  and  ethnicity (GCE) specialist \nwill help develop plans to ensure they reach women, Dalits, and the disadvantaged.  \n \n\nSupporting Delivery of Short-Term Skills Training for Formal and \n\nb. \n            International Labor Markets  \n\n \n25. \nThe Project will support the analysis of labor market demand for formal and international \nlabor markets. Based on this, it will prioritize occupational areas for training and prepare training \nspecifications  through  consultancies,  workshops,  and  incremental  recurrent  cost  financing.  \nThe  Project  will  provide  resources  for  the  development  of standards and sample curricula for \nskills  associated  with  these  occupational  areas,  where  none  exist.  The  Project  will  increase \n\n\f \n\n \n\n                  \n\n7\n\naccess  to  MOST  by  providing  for  training  development  cost  and  training  delivery  recurrent \ncosts, which include instructor fees, rent, consumables, and learner materials for about 55,000 \nbeneficiary trainees. Training programs will include elements of life skills and entrepreneurship, \nas appropriate. Training delivery will be tendered and include both center-based and enterprise-\nbased  training.  CTEVT  will  consider  providing  stipends  to  cover  transportation  expense  for \nthose  who  live  away  from  the  training  sites  and  to  reimburse  some  of  the  wages  lost while \nattending  training  along  guidelines to be approved by the  project steering committee  (ProSC). \nTraining  proposals  from  employers  and  training  providers  for the  delivery  of  MOST  for  formal \nand international employment, specifically for targeted beneficiaries, are welcome and subject to \nthe same criteria as described for selecting training programs and training providers. Criteria for \nselecting training providers will include price, capacity, and posttraining support such as on-the-\njob training and employment. \n \n\nc.  \n\nSupporting  the  Delivery  of  Community-Based,  Market-Oriented, \nShort-Term Skills Training \n\n \n26. \nThe  Project  will  support  community-based delivery of  MOST  training.  The  Project  will \ncontract  international  and  local  NGOs,  with  continuing  work  and  presence  in  the  district,  to \nmobilize  communities  and  undertake  TNA;  prepare  training  proposals;  identify  potential \nbeneficiaries;  and  partner,  where  available,  with  a  training  provider.  Local  and  international \nNGOs will be provided with capacity strengthening in TNA. Training proposals will be assessed \nand  the  Project  will  provide  support  to  deliver  the  training  in  the  community  for  about  25,000 \nbeneficiaries.  The  Project  will  provide  for  training  development  costs  and  training  delivery \nrecurrent costs, which include instructor fees, consumables, and training materials. The delivery \nof training programs will be tendered.  Training programs will include  elements of life skills and \nentrepreneurship,  and  provide  posttraining  services,  including  linkages  with  employers, \nmarketers, and local financing groups, as well as basic tools. Community contributions, such as \ntraining  venue  and  accommodations  for  trainers,  will  be  requested.  Provision  of  stipends  to \nreimburse  some  of  the  wages  lost  while  attending  training  will  be  considered  along  the \nguidelines to be approved by the  ProSC. For center-based training, the Project will provide for \nthe cost of the training program, transportation expenses, and, in recognition of the opportunity \ncosts  of  labor,  provision  of  living  allowances  will  be  considered  for  eligible  trainees  along \napproved  guidelines.  Employers  and  training  providers  may  submit  specific  proposals  for \ntargeted beneficiaries subject to ProSC-approved guidelines. \n \n27. \nNepal\u2019s  conflict  situation  and  complex  social  structure  present  risks to  implementing \ncommunity-based training programs. In this connection, this subcomponent will adopt a phased \napproach. Implementation in the first year will be initiated in five districts: Achham, Dhanusha, \nHumla,  Kapilbastu,  and  Panchthar.  At  the  end  of  the  first  year,  project  experience  with  the \ncriteria,  implementation  procedures,  and  approaches,  focusing  on  the  TNA,  beneficiary \nselection,  and  stipends,  will  be  assessed  and  refinements  will  be  made  as  necessary.  In  the \nsecond year, five more districts will be added; the ProSC will identify these during the first year. \nThis  project  component  will  be  progressively  implemented  in  the  remaining  districts  during \nproject implementation. \n \n\n2. \n\nCapacity Strengthening  \n\n \n\na. \n\nStrengthening Key Agencies to Serve the TEVT Subsector \n\n \n28. \nKey  government  agencies  have  the  potential  to  improve  their  service  to  the  TEVT \nsubsector, particularly for  MOST skills training. Framework mechanisms and services, such as \ncoordination  and  facilitation,  planning,  labor  market  information analysis,  skills standards,  and \n\n\f 8\n\naccreditation,  will  need  to  be  in  place  to  facilitate  skills  training,  particularly  for  MOST.  \nWhile  these  mechanisms  exist,  they  are  neither  adequate  nor  accessed  by  many  TEVT \nproviders. \n \n29. \nStrengthening  CTEVT  in  Planning,  Coordination, and  Facilitation.  CTEVT  will  be \nstrengthened  to  coordinate,  facilitate,  and  undertake  planning  in  the  subsector.  To  aid  the \nanalyses  of  available  resources  and  gaps  vis-\u00e0-vis  the  needs  in  specific  geographic areas,  \nthe  Project  will  develop  and  implement  a  geographic  information  system (GIS)  to map public \nand  private  training  institutions  and  resources  throughout  the  country.  The  Project  will  provide \nconsulting  services,  equipment,  software  and  materials,  incremental  recurrent  costs  for  data \ncollection,  publication  costs,  and  refurbishment  of  the  GIS  office.  To  assist  training  program \nmonitoring  and  assessment  and  to  help  employers  identify  trained  potential  employees,  \na  training  management  information  system  (TMIS)  will  be  developed  and  installed  at  CTEVT, \nCSIDB,  DCSI,  DOLEP,  public  training  institutions,  CTEVT-affiliated  institutions,  and  training \nproviders of the Project.  Data collected by the TMIS will include GCE statistics. The Project will \nprovide consulting services, equipment, software and materials, incremental recurrent costs for \ndata  collection,  and  publication  costs.  Staff  of  recipient  institutions of  GIS  and  TMIS  will  be \ntrained  in  data  collection,  data  manipulation,  database  maintenance,  and  utilization  of  this \ninformation for planning and research, as appropriate. \n \nTo  assist  subsector  planning  and  the  development  and  delivery  of  MOST  training, \n30. \nCTEVT personnel will receive training in labor market information analysis. The Project will also \nprovide  resources  for  workshops,  reference  materials,  and  data  to  produce  labor  market \nanalysis papers in four sectors. To prepare (i) a minimum of  four  discussion papers analyzing \nvarious  mechanisms  employed  by  public  and  private  training  providers  in  designing  and \ndelivering  short-term training, (ii)  four  tracer  studies  for  the  Project,  and  (iii)  annual  progress \nreports of the TEVT subsector, CTEVT will receive support for workshops, reference materials, \ndata,  and  publication.  CTEVT  will  also  receive  staff  development  for  planning,  research  and \nanalysis,  TNA,  and  networking  to  serve  training  providers;  computing  and  office  equipment; \nincremental recurrent cost for data collection;  and  support for dissemination through seminars \nand publication.  \n \nThe  Project  will  support  the  review  and  refinement  of  the  current  skills  level  and \n31. \nqualifications  equivalence  into  a  training  qualifications  framework,  including  for  short-term \ntraining. The Project will provide for the services of a training qualifications framework specialist, \nworkshops, reference materials, publications, and incremental recurrent costs. The Project will \nprovide  CTEVT  resources  to  annually  review  and  refine,  as  necessary,  the  skills  standards, \ntraining standards,  and curricula  of  at  least  20  MOST  training  programs  in  consultation  with \nstakeholders,  including  CSIDB,  DCSI,  DOLEP,  professional/crafts  associations,  employer \ngroups, and recruitment agencies. For 20 new short-term training programs in skill areas with no \nstandards,  CTEVT will  develop  competency-based  skills  and  training  standards  and  sample \ncurricula.  These will reflect a  change in  focus  from  curricula  based  on  job analyses to those \nbased  on  skills  standards.  CTEVT  will  maintain  a  library  of  training  curricula;  a  copy  of  all \ndeveloped  curricula  will  be  provided  to  CTEVT  to  be  used  as  references  by  other  training \nproviders,  public  and  private,  and  for  monitoring  purposes.  The  Project  will  support  annual \nnational  workshops  on  curriculum  development  and  skills  standards  for  short-term  training \nprograms,  and  training  workshops  on  new  or  revised  skills  and  training  standards  and  short-\nterm  training  programs.  The  Project  will  provide  support  to  procure  sample  curricula, \ncompetency-based skills standards, and curriculum development packages, consulting services, \nworkshops, staff development, office equipment, reference materials, and incremental recurrent \ncosts. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n                  \n\n9\n\nfor  seminars  and  workshops, \n\nreference  materials,  publications, \n\n32. \nThe  Project  will  support  the  review,  adjustment,  and  dissemination  of  the  accreditation \nprocess at CTEVT. An accreditation specialist will review the accreditation process for greater \ntransparency and incorporation of skills and training standards, including for short-term training \nprograms. Adjustments will be recommended to current procedures and requirements, including \nminimum standards for training facilities and employed trainers. Staff will be trained  to carry out \nthese new procedures. Information on the accreditation procedure will be disseminated through \nworkshops,  the  media,  and  the  Internet.  Throughout  implementation,  the  Project  will  provide \nsupport \ninformation \ndissemination,  incremental  recurrent  costs,  and  refurbishment  of  the  accreditation  office  to \nimplement the accreditation process for a minimum of 40 MOST programs.  \n \n33. \nStrengthening  DOLEP  in  Labor  Market  Information  Systems  and  Employment \nServices. DOLEP will be strengthened in labor market information, employment services, and \nloan schemes for workers for  international  employment.  A  labor  market  information  specialist \nwill be supported by the Project to assess the status of the labor market information system and \nthe  status  of  activities  to  disseminate  and  analyze  labor  market  information.  The  Project  will \nsupport data collection, computing equipment, staff development, the publication of semi-annual \nlabor market reports, and the development of a website to increase access to up-to-date labor \nmarket  information.  The  Project  will  support,  through  an  employment  services  specialist,  \nthe preparation of an action plan for establishing employment service centers to serve as one-\nstop  shops  for  a  variety  of  advice  and  services,  including  information  on  training,  employment \nopportunities in the formal and  informal sectors,  job  applications,  and  establishing  a  business. \nThe Project will support pilot activities to  develop three functioning employment service centers \nin  Kathmandu  and two  large  urban  areas.  Staff  development,  statistical  software,  office  and \ncomputing equipment, and repair and refurbishment will be provided as necessary. The Project \nwill support the preparation and printing of brochures with departure information for international \nemployment in  various  countries.  The  Project  will  also  provide  consulting  services  to  review \nongoing  loan  schemes  for  trainees  and  workers  for  international  employment,  and  make \nrecommendations for sustainability and targeting.  \n \n34. \nStrengthening  DCSI  and  CSIDB  to  Better  Serve  Communities  and  Economic \nGroups.  As the  Government  office that deals with skills training  and  is present in all districts, \nDCSI  and  CSIDB  will  be  strengthened  in  their  liaison  and  facilitation  roles.  Staff in all districts \nwill receive training to improve  TNA, market needs analysis,  targeting of disadvantaged groups, \nand  provision  of  useful  posttraining  information  and  services.  Training  will  include  a  GCE \nsensitization  module.  DCSI  and  CSIDB  staff  will  prepare  strategic  plans  for  their  districts , and \nidentify  their  requirements  for  repair,  refurbishment,  and  office  equipment.  The  Project  will \nprovide  staff  development,  training  materials,  refurbishment,  and  office  equipment  to  the  skills \ntraining section. \n \n\nb. \n\nStrengthening Short-Term Skills Training Provision \n\n \n35. \nThis component will strengthen the capacity of training providers, public and private,  to \nmeet  the  requirements  of  a  national  TEVT  policy.  The  shift  to  market-oriented  quality training \nwill require many training providers to transform their practices. All training packages for staff of \ntraining providers will include a GCE module. The facilities of selected public training institutions \nwill be strengthened as necessary.  \n \nTraining the Personnel of Training Providers. Through the Project, training providers \n36. \nwill  receive  training  in  the  management  of  education  and  training  institutions,  leadership  in \neducation,  and  instructional  skills  supporting  the  TEVT  policy  and  training  frameworks.  \nThe Project will prepare a training plan  and develop three training packages. The first training \n\n\f 10\n\npackage  will  be  for  managers  of  training  providers  and  will  include  training  in  working  with \ncommunities  to  identify  needs  and  opportunities,  beneficiary  targeting,  and  partnership \narrangements;  and  develop  posttraining  services.  The  second  training  package  will  be  for \ntraining  supervisory  staff  and  will  include  TNA;  participatory  approaches;  and  overviews  of \ntrainer  training,  skills  testing,  training  for  entrepreneurship,  student  selection  and  targeting \napproaches, and curriculum and materials development. To ensure staff availability to train new \ntraining  staff,  selected  instructors  will  also  receive  this  package.  The  third  package  is  for  full-\ntime and part-time instructors, working under the direction of other staff and will be in vocational \neducation pedagogy, training delivery approaches, and occupational skills. Where appropriate, \ntraining of trainers in the content of developed/refined short-term skills training programs will be \nundertaken  three  times  annually  in  various  parts  of  the  country.  An  estimated  200  managers, \n200  training/education  supervisors,  and  1,000  trainers/instructors  will  be  trained  using  these \npackages. \n \n37. \nStrengthening Selected Public Training Providers. Based on criteria, including need \nand  location,  to  be  developed  by  the  ProSC,  selected  public  training  providers  will  be \nstrengthened. Public training providers will be requested to submit proposals for strengthening \ntheir respective institutions. Selected proposals will demonstrate, among others, a clear linkage \nto  the  delivery  of  MOST  skills  training  and  the  inadequacy  of  current  equipment  and  facilities. \nProject  support  will  be  extended,  as  appropriate,  for (i)  repair  and  refurbishment  of  nonrented \nfacilities; (ii) staff development; (iii) curriculum development; (iv) consulting services for training \nprogram  development;  (v)  equipment,  instructional,  and  training  materials  and  supplies;  and   \n(vi)  incremental  recurrent  cost  of  utilities,  marketing,  and  promotion.  New  civil  works  will  be \nsupported  when  they  are  absolutely  essential, but will require prior  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  approval  and  must comply  with  environmental  and  resettlement  safeguards.  Evaluators \nwill conduct site evaluations and appraise the proposals.  The ProSC will approve the proposals \nto be supported on the recommendation of a project implementation unit (PIU) working group.  \n  \n\n3.  \n\nSupporting Policy Development, Articulation, and Implementation \n\n \n38. \nAimed  at  coordinating  activities  in  the  TEVT  subsector  with  a  common  purpose  and \ncomparable outcomes and increased relevance and efficiency, the Project will support drafting \nand articulating  a new  TEVT policy  by developing  action plans  and implementation plans and \nconsulting widely with stakeholders. The Project will provide consulting services and support for \nmeetings, materials, and seminars and workshops. The Government will adopt the TEVT policy \nwithin 1 year of loan effectiveness.  \n \n39. \nThe  Project  will  review  the  roles,  mandates,  responsibilities,  and  ongoing  activities  of \ngovernment TEVT stakeholders, including  central  agencies and  training  providers, to develop \noptions  for  a  coordinated  public  TEVT  subsector.  The  options  will  consider,  among  others,  \na  redistribution,  consolidation,  and/or  separation  of  mandates  in  the  context  of  efficiency, \ngovernance, and the Government\u2019s vision of decentralization. A recommendation will be made \nand  a  time-bound  implementation  plan  will  be  developed.  The  Project will support the review \nand  feasibility  assessment  of  mechanisms  to  increase  the  financial  sustainability  of  the \nsubsector;  and  increase  the  efficiency,  equity,  and  market-orientation  of  training  budgets \nallocated  in  the  government  and  semi-government  sector.  These  mechanisms  include  the \nestablishment  of  a  skills  development  fund,  performance-based budgeting, levy/grant scheme, \nother  nontraditional  sources  of  funds,  and  granting  full  or  partial  autonomy  to  public  training \ninstitutions.  After  the  adoption  of  mechanisms  for  sustainable  and  efficient  TEVT  subsector \nfinancing,  the  Project  will  support  the  development  of  an  action  plan  and  initiate  its \nimplementation.  The  development of  financing mechanisms  will include a wide consultation of \nstakeholders and  be guided by the  Policy  Coordination  Committee (PCC)  and  Policy Steering \n\n\f \n\n \n\n                  \n11\n\nis  partly  due \n\nSpecial Features \n\nThe  present  conflict  situation \n\nCommittee  (PoSC).  The  Project  will  provide  consulting  services  and  support  for  meetings, \nmaterials, and seminars and workshops. \n \nC. \n \nto  poverty;  unemployment  and \n40. \nunderemployment;  and  lack  of  economic  opportunities  for  the  poor  and  the  disadvantaged. \nParticularly  for  the  unemployed and  underemployed,  skills  needed  to  secure  jobs  or  generate \nincomes are lacking. The Project supports providing the unemployed and underemployed with \nmore  market-oriented  training  in  skills  areas  needed  by  the  domestic  and  international  labor \nmarkets.  Training  programs  to  be  supported  are  short-term  and  are  thus  accessible  to  more \ntrainees, especially  those  with  less  than  SLC  qualifications.  Training  for  international  jobs will \ninclude positions that would employ more women. Community-based training will be accessible \nto the less educated and located locally where appropriate and feasible. In addition,  upgrading \nfacilities  in  public  training  institutions  to  make  them  more  accessible  to  women  and  the \nhandicapped is eligible for project support.  \n \nThe  Project  adopts  a  strategy  that  addresses  GCE  (Appendix  4).  Target  groups  to \n41. \nreceive subsidized training and posttraining services will be the  poor and include overall project \ntarget group quotas.  At least  60% of all trainees in project-supported MOST training programs \nwill be women, Dalits, or disadvantaged. At the same time, at least 50% of all trainees will be \nwomen  and  at  least  25%  Dalits. Training packages for staff of training providers will include a \nmodule on building awareness of GCE and social inclusion issues. The Project will maintain  a \nGCE-disaggregated TMIS data.  \n \n42. \nIn  view  of  the  implementation  difficulties  posed  by  the  conflict  situation,  the  Project \nadopts  a  phased  approach  in  expanding  to  different  districts.  Implementation  of  training \nprograms  will  commence  in  five  districts  in  the  first  year.  Experiences  and  results  of  Project \nimplementation will be reviewed at the end of the first year,  with emphasis on the mechanisms \nto increase access to  MOST skills training.  Implementation will be refined  as necessary before \nProject implementation is expanded to more districts in subsequent years. \n \nthe  Project  will  be  market-oriented.  \n43. \nFor  international  and  formal  employment,  employers,  manpower  agencies,11  and  relevant \nGovernment  stakeholders  will  together  identify  the  areas  of  training  demand.  Local  and \ninternational NGOs and various community groups, in cooperation with economic groups in the \ncommunity  and  its  immediate  vicinity,  will  identify  income-generating  opportunities that can be \nprofited from with appropriate training provision. \n \n44. \nThe project design includes the participation of the private sector during implementation. \nThe  PCC  and  ProSC  include  representatives  of  the  various  TEVT  stakeholders,  including \nemployers and manpower agencies. The private sector will be represented in the development \nof training standards and curricula, and in identifying needed skills training. Relevant personnel \nof  private  training  providers  will  receive  training  through  the  Project.  Delivery  of  training  under \ncomponent  1  is  not  limited  to  public  training  providers,  but  is  open  to  both  public  and  private \ntraining providers through contracting arrangements. Capacity building activities and contracting \nof training programs to private providers will contribute to the development of a private training \nmarket. \n \n\nto  be  offered  under \n\nTraining  programs \n\n                                                 \n11 Recruitment agencies for international employment are called \u201cmanpower agencies\u201d in Nepal. \n\n\f 12\n\nCost Estimates \n\nD. \n \n45. \nThe total cost of the Project, including physical and price contingencies, and taxes and \nduties, is estimated at $25.0 million equivalent. Of this amount, $2.3 million equivalent, or 9% of \nthe  total  cost,  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost,  and  $22.7 million equivalent, or  91%  of  the  total \ncost,  is  the  local  currency  cost.

It is proposed that  ADB \nprovides  a  loan  of  $20.0  million  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights \n13,615,000  from  its  Special  Funds  resources  to  finance  80%  of  the  project costs.  This covers \n$2.3  million  equivalent  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $17.7  million  equivalent  of  the local \ncurrency cost. ADB financing will be used to finance a portion of the costs relating to civil works, \nprocurement of equipment,  training resources,  training,  consulting  services, and research,  but \nwill exclude salaries of regular  government  staff,  rental  of  office  space,  and  taxes  and duties. \nThe  term  of  the  proposed  loan  will  be  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  with  an \ninterest  charge  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.   \nThe indicative financing plan is presented in Table 2. \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n                  \n13\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n \n\n \n 2.3  \n0.0 \n 2.3  \n\n \n 17.7  \n 5.0  \n 22.7  \n\nTotal \nCost \n \n 20.0  \n 5.0  \n 25.0  \n\nPercent \n\n \n 80  \n 20  \n 100  \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \n\nTotal \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \nF.  \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements  \n\n1.   \n\nProject Management \n\nThe Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES) will be the Executing Agency, CTEVT the \n\n \n47. \nImplementing Agency.  \n \n48. \nA  ProSC  will  be  established,  chaired  by  the  secretary of  MOES;  CTEVT  will  be  the \nSecretariat.  ProSC  membership  will  comprise  representatives  from  Ministry  of  Finance;  \nMinistry of Industries, Commerce and Supplies; Ministry of Labor and Transport Management; \nMinistry  of  Local  Development;  National  Planning  Commission;  development  partners,  \nas  appropriate;  and  Federation  of  National  Chambers  of  Commerce  and  Industry.  There  will \nalso  be  two  representatives  from  participating  districts  on  a  rotating  basis,  four  members  from \ncivil  society  broadly  representing  the  target  groups  and  their  concerns,  one  member \nrepresenting the concerns of manpower agencies, and one member representing the concerns \nof private training providers. At  least three members will be women and at least two members \nwill be Dalits. ADB will participate as observer.  Other members may be co-opted as necessary. \nChanges in membership will be subject to ADB approval.  \n \n49. \nThe ProSC will (i) approve the initial and revised criteria and procedures to  (a) allocate \nproject funds for training delivery, (b) select districts for  project implementation, (c) select public \ntraining  institutions  to  be  strengthened  and  upgraded,  (d)  select  training  providers  to  deliver \nMOST skills training, (e) select NGOs and CBOs, and (f) select  project beneficiaries of training; \n(ii) allocate the  project  funds  for  training  delivery;  and  (iii)  decide  on  the  districts  to  which  the \nProject is to be expanded. The criteria, resource allocations, and district selection will be subject \nto ADB approval. Indicative criteria for project implementation are in Appendix 6. The ProSC will \nadvise  the  project  manager  of  concerns  and  issues  related  to  all  aspects  of  project \nimplementation, and facilitate coordination between ministries and agencies. In the first 2 years \nof project implementation, the ProSC will meet at least once every quarter. After that, the ProSC \nwill meet as necessary, but not less than twice a year.  \n \n50. \nA PIU will be established in CTEVT. The PIU will be headed by  a Project Director; day-\nto-day management will be by a full-time Project Manager. The PIU will be responsible  for the \nadministration of all project activities. The PIU will comprise a project administration section and \na training secretariat. The PIU staff will include a monitoring and evaluation officer. Focal people \nin  the  implementing  agencies  will  be  appointed.  Working  groups  will  be  organized,  \nas  necessary,  to  coordinate  and  guide  the  implementation  of  project  subcomponents  and \nactivities,  particularly  components  1(B)  and  1(C).  Members  of  working  groups  will as agreed \nbetween CTEVT and ADB. The PIU will establish a grievance redressal mechanism for project-\nrelated activities within 6 months of loan effectiveness.   \n \n\n\f 14\n\n3.  \n\n2.   \n\nProcurement  \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years  beginning  2005  and  ending  2011.   \n\n51. \nCommunity-based  training  will  be  implemented  in  the  districts  through  the  DCSI  and \nCSIDB  district  offices.  The  DCSI/CSIDB  district  office  shall  report  to  the  Project  Manager.   \nA  district  steering  committee  will  be  established  and  comprise  the  chairman  of  the  district \ndevelopment committee, local development officer, the district education officer, representative \nof  CTEVT  training  schools,  a  representative  of  the  local  chamber  of  commerce,  employers, \nNGOs,  CBOs,  and  three  representatives  from  the  target  groups.  Other members may  be  co-\nopted as necessary. The DCSI/CSIDB shall act as the member-secretary. The district steering \ncommittee shall prioritize and approve training programs proposed for communities. \n \nFor  the  policy  development  and  articulation  component,  the  existing  committees  and \n52. \ngroups, namely, the PCC, PoSC, and Core Working Group  will continue their respective roles. \nThe  PCC  shall  provide  coordination  and  multi-sectoral  inputs  on  policy  development  and \narticulation  in  the  TEVT  sub-sector. PCC  members will  represent the same stakeholders and \ninterests as the ProSC. The PoSC will provide advice and guidance to the articulation process. \nThe Core Working Group will continue to develop and articulate policy.  Appropriate experts and \nstakeholders will join the group as required. \n \n \n \n53. \nThe overall project implementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n \n \n \nThe  procurement  of  goods  and  services  financed  by  ADB  will  be  undertaken  in \n54. \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and  the  Government\u2019s  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. Since any civil works will be small and widely dispersed, foreign contractors \nare  unlikely  to  be  interested  in  bidding.  Consequently,  all  the  civil  works  contracts  will  be \nprocured on the basis of local competitive bidding among prequalified contractors in accordance \nwith the Government\u2019s procurement procedures acceptable to ADB. Prequalification, selection, \nand engagement of contractors will be subject to ADB approval. The procurement of goods will \nbe  grouped  into  packages  larger  than  $500,000  to  be  suitable  for  international  competitive \nbidding. Miscellaneous minor goods that cannot be grouped into large contracts and cost less \nthan  $500,000  per  contract  will  be  procured  through  international  shopping.  Direct purchase \nmay  be  used  for  minor items, costing less than  $100,000  equivalent  per  contract. Appendix 8 \ngives the indicative procurement packages. \n \n \n \n55. \nThe  selection  and  engagement  of  all  consulting  services  to  be  financed  under  the \nProject will be in accordance with quality- and cost-based selection under ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of \ninternational and domestic consultants. A team of consultants to provide services in a range of \nspecialties  with  estimated  international  inputs  of  21  person-months  and  domestic  inputs  of  \n66  person-months  is  planned.  These  services  will  be  provided  by  individual  consultants  and \nconsulting  firms,  and  will  be  selected  according  to  ADB  guidelines.  These  do  not  include \nservices from NGOs in the districts to undertake training needs analysis, beneficiary mapping, \nand identification of trainees.  In districts and communities, where the conflict situation warrants \nit, NGOs may be directly selected based on a set of minimum criteria. Appendix 9 summarizes \nthe consulting requirements. \n \n \n\nConsulting Services \n\n4.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n                  \n15\n\n6.  \n\n5.   \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n \n56. \nCTEVT  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  disbursement  projections  and  MOES  for \nrequesting  budgetary  allocations  for  counterpart  funds.  Immediately  after  loan  effectiveness, \nCTEVT  will  establish  an  imprest  account  for  the  Project  at  Nepal  Rastra  Bank.  The  initial \namount will be no more than a 6-month projected disbursement or 10% of the total loan amount, \nwhichever  is  less.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, and detailed arrangements agreed to by \nthe  Government  and  ADB.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure  procedures  may  be  used  to \nreimburse  eligible  expenditures  and  to  liquidate  advances  made  into  the  imprest  account  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s loan disbursement guidelines. Any individual payment to be reimbursed \nor liquidated under the  statement  of  expenditure  procedure  will  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of \n$50,000.  CTEVT  will  coordinate  the  timely  release  of  funds.  Auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  will \naudit the use of the imprest account and statement of expenditure procedures. A separate audit \nopinion should be included in the annual audit report. \n \n \n \n57.  MOES,  with  assistance  from  CTEVT  and  the  district  offices,  will maintain records and \naccounts adequate to identify goods and services financed  out of the loan proceeds. MOES will \n(i) maintain separate accounts for the Project; (ii) ensure accounts and financial statements are \naudited  annually,  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles  by  auditors  acceptable  to \nADB;  and  (iii)  provide  to  ADB,  not  later  than  9  months  after  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year, \ncertified  copies  of  audited  accounts  and  financial  statements,  and  the  report  of  the  auditor  on \nthese.  CTEVT  will  submit  progress  reports every  4  months.  The  reports  will  be  in  a  format \nacceptable  to  ADB,  and  will  include  (i)  progress  made  against  established  targets,  including \naspects  of  quality;  (ii)  delays  and  problems  encountered,  and  actions  taken  to  resolve  issues; \n(iii) compliance with loan covenants; (iv) proposed program of activities to be undertaken during \nthe next 4 months; and (v) expected progress during the succeeding period. Within  3 months of \nphysical  completion  of  the  Project,  the  Government  will  prepare  and  submit to ADB a  project \ncompletion report on the execution of the Project including the costs and compliance with loan \ncovenants. \n \n \n \n58. \nIn  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Project  Performance  Management  System  Handbook,  a \nshortlist  of  verifiable  indicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  was  prepared.  The  Project  will \nrecruit a monitoring and evaluation specialist to identify and select verifiable indicators. Within 4 \nmonths  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  PIU  will  have  collected  the  baseline  information  and  \nsubmitted a detailed project implementation monitoring plan for  ADB\u2019s review and concurrence. \nProject  performance  management  system   activities  will  be  conducted  periodically  to  gather \ninformation  from  multiple  sources  to  determine  whether  the  inputs  for  implementing  program \nactivities  have  rendered  expected  benefits  to  the  intended  beneficiaries.  The  Project  will \ndevelop and implement a  TMIS  to  collect  trainee  information,  including  on  GCE.  The  PIU  will \nsubmit  annual  benefit  monitoring  reports  to  ADB.  The  project  performance  monitoring  also \nseeks  to  detect  any  deficiency  and  discrepancy  between  the  plan  and  the  execution  of  a \nprogram using resources efficiently so that timely corrections can be made to update the Project \nand  thus  improve  the  benefits,  outcomes,  and  impact.  The project performance management \nsystem will utilize information from the annual and semiannual reviews, midterm review, periodic \nevaluations  and  studies,  and  employer  and  trainee  feedback.  CTEVT  will  conduct  four  tracer \nstudies.  \n \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n7.  \n\n\f 16\n\n8.  \n\nProject Review \n\n \n \n59. \nADB  will  conduct  detailed  reviews  of  the  Project  at  least  three  times  a  year  before \nProject  midterm,  and  at  least  two  times  a  year  thereafter.  The  reviews  will  cover  physical \nprogress  on  project  implementation,  financial  performance,  implementation  of  GCE  strategy, \nprogress of Project activities, and identification of problems and suggestion of solutions thereof. \nA comprehensive midterm review will also be conducted jointly by the  Government and ADB at \nthe end of the third year of Project implementation. Taking cognizance of the process approach \nadopted to monitor performance, the midterm review will (i) evaluate the project scope, design, \nimplementation arrangements, and institutional processes; (ii) evaluate the effectiveness of the \npilot  employment  service  centers;  (iii)  review  the  progress  made  toward  developing  a \nsustainable TEVT financing mechanisms; (iv) review in detail the level of implementation of the \nGCE  strategy;  (v)  assess  implementation  performance  against  performance  indicators;  (vi) \nreview compliance with loan covenants; (vii) identify critical issues and constraints, if any; and \n(viii)  if  necessary,  identify  and  recommend  changes  needed  in  any  (or  all)  of  these  areas.  In \naddition,  CTEVT  and  ADB  will  jointly  review  the  Project  at  the  end  of  the  first  year  of  Project \nimplementation.  The  first-year  review  will  assess  the  experiences  and  results  of  project \nimplementation  with  emphasis  on  reviewing  the  effectiveness  of  the  mechanisms  utilized  to \nincrease access to MOST skills training, including in light of policy developments. Refinements \non the various procedures, criteria, and mechanisms will be made as necessary.  \n \n \n\nIV . \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS  \n\nProject Benefits and Impact  \n\n \nA. \n \n60. \nThe  Project  supports  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  reduce  poverty  and  redress  factors \nsustaining the conflict. The main  project  benefits  include  more  skilled  Nepalese who can gain \nemployment  locally  and  abroad,  more  Nepalese  given  the  opportunity  for  self-employment \nthrough  skills  training,  increased  market-relevance  and  improved  quality  of  short-term training \nprograms,  and  increased  in-country  capacity  to  develop  and  deliver  MOST  skills  training.  \nThe  direct  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  will  be  the  unemployed and  underemployed  who would \nlike  to  gain  skills  for  employment  and  income  generation,  particularly  women,  Dalits,  and the \ndisadvantaged;  various  ministries  supporting  short-term  training  and  CTEVT;  and  public  and \nprivate training providers. \n \nSocial  Benefits.  The  Project  supports  national  efforts  to  reduce poverty  and  provide \n61. \nstability, especially in the context of the current conflict. The Project aims to improve access to \nemployment  or  self-employment  for  women,  socially  excluded  Dalits,  and  disadvantaged \ngroups, as well as poor socioeconomic groups in general.  The Project targets to have women, \nDalits,  and  members  of  disadvantaged  groups  make  up  at  least  60%  of  the  trainee \nbeneficiaries,  while  ensuring  that  at  least  50%  are  women  and  at  least  25%  are  Dalits.  \nIn  community-based  training,  associations  of  disadvantaged groups,  Dalits,  NGOs, and CBOs \nwill be consulted  to  identify potential beneficiaries  in  their  communities  and  constituencies.  In \ntraining leading to self-employment, trainees will be provided linkages to available  posttraining \nservices,  e.g.,  microfinance,  marketing  groups,  and  employers.  This  targeting  by  social \ngrouping,  as  well  as  awareness-raising  of  gender  equity  and  social  inclusion  issues  among \ninstitutions,  is  expected  to  contribute  to  conflict  resolution  efforts,  by  addressing  some  of  the \nprimary root causes\u2014poverty and social exclusion.  \n \n62. \nThe  Project  is  aimed  at  increasing  access  to  market-oriented  training  with  a  view  to \nincreasing  participation  of  trainees  in  formal  and  foreign  employment  and  self-employment \n\n\f \n\n \n\n                  \n17\n\nthrough \n\nto  short-term \n\nincreased  access \n\ntraining  programs \n\nactivities. For foreign employment, the focus is on delivering short-term training for semiskilled \nand skilled occupations, as well as increasing awareness and access to information on foreign \nemployment. The focus on short-term training implies that the required qualifications for training \nprograms will be less than SLC pass, and, in many instances, will require only basic literacy and \nnumeracy. By increasing the capacity in-country for expanded short-term training provision and \nthe  Project,  \nsupporting \nthe  unemployed  and  underemployed,  particularly  women,  Dalits, and  disadvantaged  groups,  \nwill have a greater opportunity to increase their incomes. \n \nEconomic  Benefits.  With  improvements  in  relevance  and  quality  of  skills  training \n63. \nprograms,  and  increasing  access  to  short-term  training  programs,  the  Project  will  generate \nincreases  in  labor  productivity  that  will  increase  the  competitiveness  of  Nepalese locally and \nabroad. This should increase their probability of employment, decrease the job search time, and \nincrease  offered  wages.  The  involvement  of  various  line  ministries,  the  private  sector,  and \nmanpower  agencies  in  determining  the  human  resource  needs  in  selected  sectors  and  in \ndeveloping needed training programs will yield higher quality labor market information and more \nappropriate training  programs. The  coordination  efforts  among  these  various  stakeholders  will \nimprove  the  matching  of  labor  supply  with  labor  demand,  especially  for  international  work.   \nAs some training will be oriented toward international work, remittances from employed trainees \nwould contribute not only to national income, but also to  reducing pressures on the balance of \npayment.  Increased  incomes  from  employment  also  have  economywide  multiplier  effects  as \nthese  are  spent  on  consumption  goods,  house  construction,  and  education,  among  others. \nThrough  the  Project,  about  80,000  trainees,  including  women,  Dalits,  and  disadvantaged \ngroups, will receive market-oriented and community-based skills training. Under the assumption \nthat 60% will find  international or local employment, or engage in self-employment, the project \ninvestment  would  be  economically  justified  with  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  28% \n(Appendix 10). \n \nInstitutional Benefits.  Through a  national  TEVT  policy  based  on  wide  consultation, \n64. \nfragmentation  and  duplication  of  training  activities  will  be  reduced  as  a  result  of  nationally \nagreed coordination mechanisms allocating clear-cut roles, responsibilities, and jurisdictions to \ntraining  providers. The  Project will  refine skills standards  and  training  standards for  short-term \ntraining delivery that will contribute to a coordinated approach in its management and delivery \nfor  all  stakeholders, with less diversity  in  duration  and  content  of  training  programs. This will \nincrease the capacities of training providers and community organizations to engage in effective \nskills  formation and  achieve  employment  outcomes .  A  revised  accreditation  system will also \ncontribute to ensuring that the various training providers adhere to the standards.  \n \n65. \nThrough the Project,  CTEVT\u2019s capacity  to  coordinate  across ministerial lines and with \nemployers,  to  serve  the  TEVT  sector,  and  to  provide  quality  assurance  will  be  enhanced. \nCTEVT  would  thus  be  able  to  offer  a  package  of  services  and  products  to  both  public  and \nprivate training providers to support their delivery of skills training that meets market needs and \nquality standards. Training providers will have greater access to materials developed at CTEVT \nthat should contribute to enhancing the  credibility of their programs.  The Project will strengthen \nthe  capacity  of  training  providers  to  deliver  skills  training  that  is  market-oriented  and  more \nrelevant to  the needs of the  industry, employer, and community. With this, training participants \nwill  more  likely  find  employment  or  enter  self-employment.  Other  government  and  private \ntraining providers' capacity to offer more short-term training programs will be enhanced  through \ncapacity  strengthening;  selected  government  training  providers  will  receive  assistance  to \nrefurbish  their  facilities.  With  capacity-building  activities  extended  to  staff  of  private  providers \nand contracting of project training activities open to private providers, the Project will stimulate \ndevelopment of the private training market.   \n\n\f 18\n\nProject Assumptions and Risks \n\n \nB. \n \n66. \nSecurity Situation. The conflict situation and armed insurgency in the country represent \nmajor  risks  to  achieving  the  Project\u2019s  development  goals.  The  Project\u2019s  ability  to  identify  and \ndeliver  training  in  communities  could  be  hindered  by  disruptions  caused  by  the  insurgency \nsituation.  The  project  design  incorporates  lessons  learned  from  implementation  in  Nepal\u2019s \nconflict  areas  (Appendix  11).  The  Project  emphasizes  local  participation  in  TNAs,  in  the \norganization  of  training  activities,  and  the  use  of  NGOs  or  CBOs  in  the  communities. Women, \nDalits, and disadvantaged groups are targeted to comprise at least 60% of training beneficiaries \nin  communities.  District officials will be  given training in liaising with communities to increase \ntheir  responsiveness  to  communities\u2019  needs.  Implementation  will  also  be  phased;  lessons \nlearned  during  implementation of  skills  training  activities  in  the  first  year  will  contribute  to  fine-\ntuning implementation arrangements, procedures, and criteria to better achieve project goals.  \n \n67. \nCoordination.  The  Project  supports  the  development,  articulation,  and  initiation  of \nimplementation  of  a  new  TEVT  policy.  The  establishment  of  a  new  national  TEVT  policy  to \nunderpin  coordination and  quality  improvements  across  the  whole  subsector  depends on the \ncommitment  of  government  providers  of  skills  development  training.  There  is  the  risk  that  line \nministries\u2019  commitment  to  a  coordinated  approach  to  skills  training  would  waiver.  Under  the \nProject, through their representation in the  Core Working Group,  PCC, and PoSC, and regular \nmeetings of these groups, cooperation and coordination of activities through the Project will be \nencouraged. The Project supports a wide stakeholder consultation in the articulation of the new \nTEVT  policy. CTEVT\u2019s capacity  to more effectively  undertake  policy  development  and  provide \ncoordination and facilitation in the  subsector will be strengthened through the Project.  CTEVT\u2019s \ncoordination and accreditation role, and administration of training delivery may present a conflict \nof interest. However, CTEVT is presently moving toward a greater facilitation and coordination \nrole.  Its  draft  5-year  plan  proposes  granting  autonomy  to  selected  CTEVT  training  institutions. \nThe new TEVT policy will also directly address this issue.  \n \n68. \nParticipation of Private Training Providers. The Project aims to improve the quality of \nshort-term training not only among public training providers, but also among private providers, \nby providing training to trainers, education managers, and senior staff. To boost the attendance \nof participants from private providers, the Project will publicize the training among the providers. \nIn addition, the training will be implemented across the country, bringing it closer to prospective \nparticipants.  Quality  benchmarks  established  through  the  framework  may  drive  up  costs  of \ntraining  delivery  such  that  training  providers  may  opt  not  to  seek  accreditation  and  quality \nremains  low.  The  representation  of  multiple  stakeholders  on  the  various  committees  and \nworking groups of the Project is one measure that will mitigate this risk, as will broad community \nand industry consultation in the development of the TEVT standards. Capacity-building activities \nwill aid providers in meeting standards. In addition, project monitoring data will help identify the \nbenefits of compliance and be disseminated to providers and trainees alike. \n \n69. \nPosttraining Services. The success of the  Project in meeting its goal depends on the \nincreased  ability  of  training  recipients  to  enter  employment  or  self-employment,  or  generate \nincome  as  a  result  of skills  training.  Posttraining  services,  however,  such as microfinance and \nproduct marketers, may  not  be  available.  To  minimize  this,  TNAs  will  take  into  consideration \nlocal  economic  opportunities.  The  Project  will also  build the  capacity  of  training  providers to \nidentify  posttraining  support  services, including linking with  employers, marketers,  NGOs, and \nother CBOs.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n                  \n19\n\n70. \nSafeguards.  The  Project\u2019s  environmental  impacts  were  reviewed,  and  no  significant \nadverse impacts were identified. However, environmental considerations will be incorporated to \navoid  significant  environmental  impacts  during  refurbishment  of  training  institutions  and  in  the \ndisposal of training materials. The Project includes no new construction and is unlikely to trigger \nADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy. Also, the Project is unlikely to have adverse impact on \nindigenous  peoples;  project  benefits  should  accrue  to  them.  The  summary  poverty  reduction \nand social strategy is in Appendix 12. \n \n \n\nV.   \n\nASSURANCES  \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n71. \nassurances , which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\nWithin  1  year  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Cabinet  will  have  approved  the  TEVT \npolicy. \nThe detailed implementations plans of prioritized sections of the TEVT policy,  as \nagreed  upon  by  CTEVT  and  ADB,  will  be  finalized  within  2  years  of  loan \neffectiveness. \nThe Government will ensure that the membership of the ProSC is as indicated in \nthe project description and that the ProSC meets at least four times a year. \nThe Government will ensure that the PCC under component 3 includes members \nthat represent the same stakeholders and interests as the ProSC. All necessary \nand appropriate measures will be taken to ensure that  at least five members are \nfemale and at least three members are from the Dalit community.  \nDistricts  to  be  added  for  implementation  will  be  selected  according  to  criteria  to \nbe developed during the first year of implementation and approved by the  ProSC \nand ADB. The criteria will include measures of poverty and deprivation. \nProject  funds  for  the  development  and  delivery  of  training  programs  under \ncomponent 1 will be allocated in accordance with criteria agreed upon with  ADB \nwithin 3 months of loan effectiveness. \nThe Government will take all necessary and appropriate measures to ensure that \nat least 60% of trainees are women, Dalits, or disadvantaged; while ensuring at \nthe same time that 50% of all trainees are women and 25% are Dalits. \nIn selecting local NGOs and CBOs for implementing activities under the Project, \npriority will be given to  NGOs and CBOs  with experience in working with  Dalits \nand  disadvantaged  groups  and  in  accordance  with  criteria  agreed  upon  by \nCTEVT and ADB. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  the  adoption  and  full  implementation  of  the  GCE \nplan  by  all  stakeholders  and  implementing  partners.  Implementation  will  be \nclosely monitored throughout project implementation. \nCTEVT  will  ensure  that  in  modifying  the  short-term  skills  training  programs, \nrelevant life skills and entrepreneurship skills are included. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  pilot  employment  services  centers  are \nadequately staffed with staff dedicated to that function only. \nThe Government will ensure that no new construction will take place. Minor civil \nworks will only be to upgrade and/or refurbish existing facilities; will follow ADB\u2019s \nguidelines  on  environment  and  resettlement;  and  will  be  based  on  need  and \nlocation, in accordance with criteria to be developed by the PIU and approved by \nthe  ProSC  and  ADB  within  the  first  3  months  of  project  implementation. \n\n\f 20\n\n \nB.  \n \n72. \neffective: \n \n\n \n \n\nFinancing  of  refurbishment  and  upgrading  will  be  subject  to  the  public  training \ninstitution  preparing  a  maintenance  plan,  including  costs,  for  the  next  3  years. \nHowever,  when  absolutely  essential,  new  civil  works  will  be  supported  but  will \nrequire  prior  ADB  approval  and  must  comply  with  environmental  and \nresettlement safeguards. \n\n(xiii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  institutions  and  training  providers  observe \nregulations relating to occupational safety and health, and the proper collection, \nsegregation,  storage,  treatment,  and  disposal  of  waste  from  minor  civil  works \nactivities  and  conduct  of  training  programs,  particularly  where  hazardous  and \ntoxic waste materials are used. \n\n(xiv)   The Government will ensure that sufficient budget allocations are made to cover \n\nrecurrent costs needed for effective project implementation. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nThe  following  conditions  will  be  met  by  the  Government  before  the  loan  becomes \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nThe PIU will be established with the Project Director and all other staff in place. \nThe ProSC will be established and members notified. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n73. \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  13,615,000  to  the  Kingdom  of  Nepal  for  the  Skills  for  Employment \nProject  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1%  per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n28 October 2004  \n\nTadao Chino \n     President \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\fDesign  \nSummary \n\nGoal \nIncreased engagement \nin wage and \ninternational \nemployment and self-\nemployment  \n \nPurpose  \nIncreased opportunities \nfor market-oriented \nshort-term (MOST) \ntraining  \n \n\nOutputs  \n1.

In Nepal,  a further \ndistinction  is made  between  technical  education  and  vocational  training.  Technical education \nconsists  of  training  for  the  nationally  recognized  qualifications  of  diploma  and  technical  school \nleaving certificate (TSLC). Technical education programs are between 2 and 3 years long, are \nstrongly  linked  to  general  education  qualifications,  and  constitute  an  alternative  pathway  to \nuniversity.  Vocational  training  programs  are  generally  less  than  6  months  in  duration  and  give \ntrainees skills to earn an income. The TEVT subsector comprises both government and private \ntraining providers. Some are entirely focused on vocational training or technical education, while \nothers offer both. The overall capacity is small at about 50,000 training places per year. Limited \nopportunities  for  places  in  government  institutions  have  led  to  the  expansion  of  private \ninstitutions, including those operated by nongovernment organizations.  \n \n2.  \nTEVT  is  largely  fragmented  in  Nepal.  No  national  policy  has  been  adopted  by  the \nsubsector  as  a  whole.  Different  providers  follow  their  own  curricula  and  even  their  own  skills \nstandards.  Nonetheless,  an  apex  body,  the  Council  for  Technical  Education  and  Vocational \nTraining (CTEVT), exists. Primarily, however, the role of CTEVT has been to monitor the quality \nof private training providers especially  for TSLC programs. CTEVT has been unable to provide \nan integrating role over the whole system of TEVT provision.  \n \n3.  \nCouncil  for  Technical  Education  and  Vocational  Training.  CTEVT  was  created  in \n1989  through  the  Technical  Education  and  Vocational  Training  Act,  1989  (amended  in  1993). \nCTEVT  is  both  a  national  coordinating  body  for  TEVT  as  well  as  the major provider of TEVT. \nThe  expansion  in  the  number  of  training  institutions  under  its  administration,  however,  \nhas  resulted  in  it  focusing  on  training  delivery  rather  than  on  its  role  as  an  apex  organization.   \nA  refocus  to  a  facilitating  role  for  the  TEVT  subsector  has  recently  emerged  consistent  with \ndirections  generally  provided  in  the  Tenth  Plan.  CTEVT  has  adopted  a  5-year strategic plan \n(2003\u20132008) that attempts to shift its focus from delivery of training, to guiding, facilitating, and \nregulating training.  \n \nCTEVT  Training  Institutions.  Presently,  four  different  kinds  of  institutions  operate \n4. \nwithin  CTEVT.  These  are  the  Training  Institute  for  Technical  Instruction, polytechnic institutes, \nvocational training and community development institutions, and technical schools.  In addition, \nannex programs of CTEVT are in some secondary schools.  \n  \n5. \nThe  Training  Institute  for  Technical  Instruction  provides training to CTEVT institutions, \ngovernment agencies, and private institutions for technical instructors, institution managers, and \noccupational  curriculum  development  specialists  through  regular  programs  and  modules,  or \nthrough customized training. Vocational training and community development programs aim to \nimprove incomes, health, sanitation, and quality of life of rural people.  These programs conduct \ninstitutional  and  mobile  training  in  agriculture,  livestock,  health,  and  community  development-\nrelated areas.  Two  centers  are currently  equipped  with  training  facilities,  hostel  facilities  for  at \nleast  10  female  trainees,  and  housing  facilities  for  core  staff.  Three  institutions  are  presently \nrunning  as  polytechnic  institutes  and  two  more  are  planned.  Polytechnics  focus  on  diploma \nprograms.  \n \nCTEVT  training  institutions  focus  mostly  on  long-term  training,  i.e.,  TSLC  and  diploma. \n6. \nEntry  to  TSLC  programs  is  restricted  to  those  with  10  years  of  schooling  accompanied  by \nexams  and  interview.  To  improve  the  connection  between  training  and  employment  and  to \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n27\n\nprovide real work experience to students, on-the-job training was made compulsory in almost all \ntechnical  school  programs.  CTEVT  training  institutions  also  run  short  courses  in  collaboration \nwith  industries  and  manpower  agencies,1  e.g.,  training  for  domestic  helpers.  A  number  of \nCTEVT schools rely on the normal budget to run short courses.  \n \n7. \nThe annex program is an option for general high schools aimed at providing TEVT to the \nunemployed,  college-based,  or  dropout  youth  by  using  high  schools\u2019  existing  physical  and \nhuman resources. A range of TEVT programs is provided, including civil engineering, electrical \nengineering,  mechanical  engineering,  and  agriculture.  Successful  trainees  will  be  awarded \nTSLCs. In addition to long-term courses, each school will conduct short-term or modular training \ncourses of 1 to 6 months' duration according to local employment demands. The annex program \nhas operated for 2 years in 15 schools and has no graduates to date.  \n \n8.    Ministry  of  Industry,  Commerce, and Supplies.  Two  agencies  under  the  Ministry  of \nIndustry,  Commerce  and  Supplies,  namely  the  Department  of  Cottage  and  Small  Industries \n(DCSI)  and  the  Cottage  and  Small  Industry  Development  Board  (CSIDB)  provide  short-term \ntraining. These are focused on developing cottage and small industries. DCSI operates mainly \nin  the  lowland areas,  while  CSIDB  operates  in  the  hills  and  mountains.  DCSI  operates  in  27 \ndistricts  and  CSIDB  in  48  districts.  They  provide  about  80  courses  with  new  ones  being \ndeveloped  as  necessary.  These  are  up  to  6  months  long  and  include  sewing,  tailoring, soap \nmaking, woodcarving, and motor maintenance. In DCSI, courses are not only free but a monthly \nstipend is also provided. Access to  microfinance  is  provided  to  enable  participants  to  start  a \nbusiness.  The  target  groups  are  (i)  socially  disadvantaged  groups,  (ii)  youth  from  remote  and \nunderdeveloped  villages,  (iii)  women\u2019s  groups,  (iv)  people  committed  to  starting  income \ntraditional  crafts,  and  \ngenerating  activities  after \n(vi)  the  unemployed  and  underemployed.  For  2001/02,  CSIDB\u2019s  budget  for  training  was \nintended to train 8,390 students; the CSIDB budget is a constraint to service delivery as up to \n12,000 trainees per year have received training in the past.  \n \n9.  \nDepartment of Labour and Employment Promotion.  The Department of Labour and \nEmployment  Promotion  focuses  on  semiskilled  and  skilled  work  in  the  formal  sector.  \nThe department runs 14 skills training centers and two technical schools. Centers are expected \nto carry out labor market surveys and run training in areas in demand. Their courses are up to  \n6  months  long  in  areas  that  include  general  mechanics;  motorcycle  repair;  petrol  and  diesel \nengine maintenance; and videocassette recorder, television, and other maintenance.  \n \nTraining  in  Other  Line  Ministries.  Other  ministries  also  offer  training  programs  that \n10.  \nfocus  on  advancing  their  respective  sectoral  interests.  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and \nCooperatives  not  only  offers  training  to  farmers  but  also  provides  longer  term programs for \ntechnical assistants and junior technicians for their ministry. The Ministry of Tourism has its own \ntraining center for the tourism industry, which provides a range of programs from short-term to \nmaster\u2019s degrees.  \n  \n11.   Private  Training  Provision.  CTEVT  has  granted  provisional  affiliation  to  over  110 \nprivate  training  institutes  that  cover  47  districts  of  Nepal  and  provide  175  programs. \nApproximately  7,200  are  enrolled  in  TSLC  courses  conducted  by  CTEVT-affiliated  institutions. \nHowever,  not  all  training  providers  affiliate  with  CTEVT;  computer-training  institutions,  \nin particular, tend not to affiliate. These institutes offer programs ranging from short to TSLC and \ndiploma courses. The institutions pay a fee and, in the case of those offering TSLC and diploma \n\nthose  engaged \n\ntraining, \n\n(v) \n\nin \n\n                                                                 \n1   Recruitment agencies for international employment are called \u201cmanpower agencies\u201d in Nepal. \n\n  \n\n\f28\n\nAppendix 2 \n\ncourses,  use  CTEVT  curricula  and  their  students  sit  for  CTEVT-administered examinations.  \nThe range of perceptions obtained  during the project preparation interviews, however, suggests \nan overall lack of public credibility about CTEVT\u2019s accreditation process.  \n \n12.   Another type of private institution offers short-term training in skill areas of high demand. \nThe major ones offer training relating to computers, tourism, and electronics. Many manpower \nagencies supplying  human  resources  to  the  international  market  also run their own training to \nprepare  workers.  Courses  closely  reflect  student  demand.  A  range  of  community-focused \norganizations, supported by aid funds, offer training to meet local or more general needs.  \n \n13.  \nIssues in TEVT. The TEVT subsector in Nepal is highly fragmented. Although a national \nTEVT  policy  was  approved  in  1999  by  the  CTEVT  Assembly,  this  is  not  adhered  to  by  all \nstakeholders. Policy guidelines are available but not adequately implemented. The public sector \nis  characterized  by  weak  institutional  leadership.  CTEVT  is  too  burdened  with  implementation \ntasks.  The  roles  of  the  various  stakeholders  of  the  TEVT  system  are  not  clearly  defined  and \norganized.  Skills  development  is  organized  by  government  ministries  (and  within  ministries,   \nby  departments),  nongovernment  organizations,  aid  projects,  and  to  some  extent,  by  local \ninitiatives.  Coordination  between  these  various  actors  and  their  respective  activities  is lacking, \nleading  to  duplication  of  activities,  e.g.,  development  of  curricula  and  skills  standards,  and, \ntherefore,  wastage  of  already  scarce  resources.  Most  training  providers  work  to  their  own \nbenchmarks  and  curricula;  outcomes  are  variable.  Consequently,  the  agencies  have  no \ncommon  purpose  or  comparable  outcomes .  Most  TEVT-related  decisions  are  made  at  the \ncentral  level  within  each  of  the  respective  line  ministries  with  little  consultation  with  key \nstakeholders, such as the private sector and local communities. Moreover, government funding \nfor training to each public agency is based on the needs of the given department rather than the \npriorities  within  the  training  market.  Incentives  and  rewards  for  well-performing  institutions are \nlacking, as are sanctions for nonperforming institutions. \n \nTraining is of  poor relevance. The public TEVT system is largely supply-driven; training \n14.  \nprograms  offered  are  often  based  on  the  allocated  budgets  of  public  training  providers, and \navailable staff and equipment. Training needs assessment is weak and often absent; the labor \nmarket information system is weak and is unable to provide up-to-date labor market information \nto  assist  training  program  selection.  The  outcomes  of  both  rarely  guide  the  selection  of  skills \nand content, with the consequence that offered courses and their content are regularly irrelevant \nto  needs  and  demands.  The  inadequate  linkage  between  educational  institutions  and  industry \nhas led to a  lack  of  mutual  cooperation.  Consequently,  educational  institutions  are  not  always \nfully  aware  of  the  needs  of  industry  nor  are  they  able  to  fully  explore  ways  industry  can  help, \nsuch as through on-the-job training. \n \n15.   National standards to measure skills levels are largely absent. Overall training efforts are \nnot leading to a significant proportion of trainees gaining employment or self-employment, and \nthus not contributing much to poverty  reduction. Employment rates of trainees from CTEVT and \nprivate  training  institutes  range  from  30%  to  80%,2  which  is  partly  attributed  to outcomes of \ncourses  not  being  the  attainment  of  skills  standards,  i.e.,  performance  defined  by  industry. \nInstead,  the  outcomes  are  the  skills  and  content  knowledge  of  the  curriculum,  the  quality  and \nrelevance of which are questionable. Monitoring and evaluation mechanisms are inadequate or, \nin  some  cases,  absent.  Measurement  of  stakeholders\u2019  performances,  accountability,  and \ntransparency  in  budget  management  is  insufficient.  Monitoring  of  the  quality  of  training \nprograms needs to be improved. The growing number of private training providers, a proportion \n                                                                 \n2  Tracer studies are not regularly conducted. These figures are, at best, estimates. \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n29\n\nof which  are  in  the  training  business  solely  for  financial  benefits,  poses  a  threat  to  training \nquality across the country. \n \n16.   \nIn  addition  to  being  poorly  identified,  training  programs  may  also  be  poorly  designed \nand/or poorly delivered.  The  development  of  curricula is too centralized, and curricula are not \nsufficiently  frequently  revised  to  reflect  changing  market  demands.  In  some  public  training \nprograms,  training  curricula  have  not  been  reviewed  for  at  least  5  years.  Many  instructors, \nincluding  those  in  private  colleges,  do  not  possess  training  in  instructional  techniques  nor  do \nthey have extensive technical expertise. Trainers and instructors\u2019 skills and capacities are rarely \nupgraded.  Currently,  no  standards  exist  for  either  instructional  or  technical  expertise.  Many \ntraining instructors, public and private, have not had any instructional training or need to have a \nrefresher  program  in  training  instruction.  Budgets  of  public  training  institutions  are  limited  and \nare thus not able to send their staff for training in vocational education pedagogy. Most public \nproviders\u2019 sites suffer from lack of maintenance, tools, equipment, materials, and/or supplies.   \n \n17.    Many TEVT providers focus solely on training rather than the outcomes of training. Many \ndo  not  provide  posttraining  support,  e.g.,  career  counseling  and  job  placement.  Posttraining \nsupport is particularly critical in training for self-employment, as providing linkages to economic \nopportunities like small business development activities and microfinance is important.  \n \nTraining  programs  have  not  yet  significantly  refocused  on  the  emerging  needs  of the \n18.  \nlabor market  or  of  large  population  groups.  While  the  major  potential  sources of employment \nand  income  generation  are  in  the  informal/self-employment  and  international  employment \nsectors, insufficient training is provided for jobs that are in demand and skills that lead to self-\nemployment.  To  improve  the  relevance  of  programs,  training  providers  need  to  make  a  better \ndetermination  of  trainees\u2019  and  employers\u2019  needs,  and  analyze  communities\u2019  economic \nopportunities.  The  larger  public  training  providers  need  to  provide more programs addressing \nthe needs of those with less than a school leaving certificate.  \n \n19.  \nThe  TEVT  subsector  in  Nepal  performs  poorly  in  terms  of  providing  access  to  skills \ntraining, specifically market-oriented short-term skills training (vocational training). Most people, \nparticularly  the  poor  and  disadvantaged,  lack  access  to  skills  training  that  can  enhance  their \nearning  capacity.  Competition  for  training  is  strong,  meaning  that  those  with  significant \nparticipation  in  secondary  school  education  have  a  better  chance  in  gaining  access.  This  is \nparticularly  the  case  with  TSLC  programs  run  by  CTEVT  where  the  entry  requirement  is  10 \nyears  of  schooling.  This  particularly  limits  access  for  most  disadvantaged  groups  such  as \nwomen, the poor, and the disadvantaged communities, including Dalits (low caste), because of \ntheir lower educational achievement. The sector has no clear and effective strategy to reach the \npoor  and  the  disadvantaged  in  remote  villages.  The  tendency  for  training  to  be  provided  in \ntraining centers also makes access difficult for those living in distant areas.  Rural and isolated \nareas have little access to training when compared with urban centers. Government funding is \ninsufficient to provide employment-related basic vocational or skills training to millions of people \nacross  the  country.  Mobile  training  offered  by  DCSI  and  CSIDB  is  limited  by  the  budget. \nInformation  being  provided  to  disadvantaged  groups,  including  women  about  the  potential \nbenefits of skills training is insufficient. \n \n20. \nToward a Coordinated TEVT Subsector.  Poverty reduction is a major goal for Nepal. \nSkills formation can play a major role in giving people employable skills to earn income. A fresh \nperspective  is  required  to  substantially  increase  the  number  of  people  who  acquire  skills  that \nlead  to  incomes.  The  creation  of  a  quality  market-oriented  TEVT  system  offers  such  a \npossibility. Such a system would have (i) acquired skills matching the performance needed for \n\n  \n\n\f30\n\nAppendix 2 \n\nemployment  or  self-employment;  (ii)  acquired  skills  matching  labor  market  demand;  and  \n(iii) training providers providing training when and where it is needed, and in the delivery mode \nmost suitable for the trainees. \n  \nImprovement  of  quality  in  TEVT  requires  achieving  consistency,  by  having  national \n21.  \nbenchmarks against which all training providers operate, using skills testing to verify attainment \nof  skills  standards,  and  adopting  emerging  approaches  to  training  for  self-employment  that \nfocus  on  employment  rather  on  training  alone.  These  could  include  developing  a  nationally \nendorsed  policy  including  frameworks  such  as  training  standards  and  using  skills standards \n(that  address  performance)  rather  than  curriculum  (that  addresses  content)  as  the  focus  of \ntraining.  The  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  team  recommended,  among  others:  \n(i) developing a national strategic plan for the TEVT subsector including vision and mission to \nbe  developed  by  all  stakeholders  including  industry,  community  groups,  all  other  ministries \ninvolved in training, and private providers; (ii)  developing a national strategic plan that includes \nthe  formulation  of  a  national  qualifications  framework  and  skills  standards, and marketing  and \nwidely disseminating the plan nationally; (iii) developing qualifications based on standards rather \nthan  curriculum;  (iv)  developing  a  mechanism  for  demand-driven  training  for  women  and \ndisadvantaged groups; (v) strengthening CTEVT to enhance its role in providing services to the \nTEVT subsector including skills standards, skills testing and curriculum; (vi) CTEVT assuming a \nmajor  role  in  strengthening  vocational  training  providers;  (vii)  improving  linkages  between \nlabor  market \ntraining  providers  and  posttraining  services,  especially  microcredit;  (viii) \ninformation analysis strengthened in relevant institutions; and (ix) adopting emerging vocational \ntraining  approaches  such  as  those  from  the  experiences  of  United  Mission to  Nepal,  Swiss \nAgency for Development and Cooperation, and Helvetas.3   \n \n22.   Ongoing Policy Development. CTEVT is presently spearheading the development of a \nnew  national  TEVT  policy  that  involves  a  wide  representation  of  stakeholders.4  The  Core \nWorking  Group  also  comprises  representatives  from  the  major  government  training  providers, \nCTEVT,  CSIDB,  DCSI,  Department  of  Labour  and  Employment  Promotion, and  National  Dalit \nCommission.  The  development  process  is  guided  by  the  Policy  Coordination  Committee, \ncomprising  representatives  of  at  least  30  groups,  including  public  training  providers,  private \ntraining  providers,  manpower  agencies,  employers,  women,  and  disadvantaged  groups.  \nThe  consultation  process,  undertaken  throughout  the  country,  highlighted  issues  including \naccess,  relevance,  coordination,  financing,  quality  assurance  and  monitoring,  posttraining \nservices,  information  dissemination,  training  of  trainers,  and  public-private  partnerships.  \nThe  envisioned  training  policy  framework  will  address  current  institutional  weaknesses, \nrelevance,  quality,  financing,  organizational  setup,  delivery,  information,  and  monitoring  and \nevaluation. \n \n\n                                                                 \n3  TAFE  Global.  2004.

Strategy Goal \n\n1.  \nThe goal of the GCE strategy is to address the issue of social exclusion which prevents \naccess and opportunity in Nepal for particular groups of people. An effective strategy for social \ninclusion requires both project and policy level intervention. The Project ensures better access \nto vocational training (VT) opportunities for employment and self-employment for target groups \nat  the  grassroots,  which  in  turn  provides  more  secure  access  to livelihood assets. Scaling up \nand  sustaining  improvements  beyond  the  life  of  the  Project  requires  representation  of  target \ngroups  in  decision-making  at  the  national  policy  level.  It  is  expected  that  representation  in  the \nnational  technical  education  and vocational training (TEVT) policy coordination committee and \nnational and district steering committees for the Project will ensure more inclusive strategies for \ncontinued  access  to  vocational  training  resources  for  employment  and  self-employment and \ninfluence  thinking  among  all  stakeholders  for  training  interventions  in  support  of  greatersocial \ninclusion  and  equity,  and  improved  governance.  Representation  of  women,  Dalits  (low  caste) \nand the disadvantaged groups will hence be ensured. At district level, the composition of these \ngroups will vary depending on the different caste-ethnic group compositions in districts. \n \nB. \n\nGCE Strategy Purpose \n\n2. \nThis  GCE  strategy  will  address  the  critical  issue  of  ensuring  that  poor  rural  men and \nwomen,  particularly  from  the  Dalit  and  disadvantaged  groups  have  equitable  access  to  VT \nservices.  The  Project  will  promote  equal  access  to  TEVT  information  by  all  target  groups  on \navailable  training  services,  post-training  support  services,  and  available microfinance options, \nwhere available.  \n \nC. \n\nImplementation Strategies \n\n1. \n\nComponent  1b:  Supporting  the  Delivery  of  Short-Term  Skills  Training  for \nFormal and International Labor Markets \n\n3.  \nThe  Project  will  support  the  development  and  delivery  of  short-term  skills  training \nprograms that are market-oriented. The programs will improve the chances of beneficiaries for \noverseas and formal sector work. Various population groups will be served, with particular focus \non the poor, women, Dalit and disadvantaged groups. \n \n4.  \nThe project implementation unit (PIU) will evaluate the proposals from training providers \naccording to  project  steering  committee  (ProSC)-approved  criteria,  and  the  ProSC  will  select \nand approve the training providers. Contracts will include conditions on performance indicators \nand  progress  payments.  Selected  training  providers\u2019  (TPs)  staff  will  be  required  to  undertake \ntraining in the GCE-sensitization training module. \n \n5. \n(i) trainee selection; (ii) training; and (iii) post-training services. \n \n \n\nInvitation  for  training  proposals  will  require  the  TP  to  include  the  following  services:   \n\n\f34\n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nComponent  1c:  Supporting  the  Delivery  of  Community-Based  Market-\nOriented Short-Term Skills Training \n\nthe \n\ntime \n\nthat  50%  of \n\ntrainees  are  women,  and \n\n6.  \nAn  additional  goal  of  component  2  is  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  Department  of \nCottage  and  Small  Industries  (DCSI)  and  Cottage  of  Small  Industries  Development  Board \n(CSIDB) district personnel to equip them with skills in their new role outlined below. The model \nfor community-based training outlined below places emphasis on proactive trainee selection of \ntarget  groups,  rural  community  training  needs  analysis,  quality  training  (including  on-the-job \ntraining  (OJT)  where  appropriate  and  possible),  and  post-training  services.  This  model \nimplemented on a pilot basis early in the Project will provide valuable experience and direction \nin the future at the district level in aiming to meet the vocational training needs for employment \nand self-employment of the target groups. \n \n7.  \nCapacity  Building  of  Nongovernme nt  Organizations  (NGOs)  and  Training \nProviders. Training for NGOs and training providers contracted by DCSI/CSIDB will include the  \nGCE-sensitization  training  module.  The  GCE  training  will  enable  selected  NGO  and  training \nproviders to receive capacity building in identifying market-oriented training needs.  \n \n8.  \nTarget Groups for  Community-Based  Short-term  Skills  Training.  Target groups to \nreceive  subsidized  training  and  post-training  services  will  include  overall  project  target  group \nquotas. At least 60% of the trainees will be women,  Dalit, or disadvantaged, while ensuring at \nthe  same \nthat  25%  are  Dalits.  \nGCE-disaggregated training management information system (TMIS) data will help track these \nnumbers.  DCSI/CSIDB  and  the  district  steering  committee  will  monitor  to  ensure  that  target \ngroups are being served by the project. The GCE specialist will assist the TMIS expert develop \na monitoring mechanism.  \n \n9.  \nDistrict  Needs  Assessment  Conducted.  A  district training needs assessment format \nwill be developed in year 1. DCSI/CSIDB will be trained on its use and DCSI/CSIDB will contract \nand orient a skilled NGO to conduct a survey to assess available training programs for jobs in \ndemand that lead to informal  and self-employment. The assessment will provide information on \ntarget groups, determine market opportunities and employers\u2019 needs, and analyze communities\u2019 \neconomic  opportunities,  e.g.  agriculture-related  enterprise,  indigenous  skills  development,  and \nthe  availability  and  conditions  of  microfinance  institutions.  The  survey  will  list  district  training \nproviders  and  the  availability,  and  quality  where  possible,  of  market-oriented  short-term skills \ntraining  programs,  which  are  accessible  to  those  who  have  less than class 10 qualifications.  \nThe  survey  will  facilitate  the  process  of  identifying  and  implementing  training  programs  in \ncommunities.  DCSI/CSIDB  will  analyze  this  data  and  make  recommendations  to  Council for \nTechnical  Education  and  Vocational  Training  (CTEVT)  for  new  short-term  market-oriented  \nshort-term training curricula to be developed from year 2. \n \n10.  \nTendering for  Training  Needs  Assessment  (TNA)/Training  Services/Posttraining \nSupport Services by DCSI/CSIDB. A tendering process will be conducted by DCSI/CSIDB in \nyear  2.  Proposals \nfrom  service  providers \n(NGO/public/private  training  providers)  that  will  include:  (i)  TNA  developed  and  conducted;   \n(ii) vocational training; and (iii) post-training support services.   \n \n11.   Selection of Training Providers. Selection criteria for TPs will be developed by the PIU \nwith  support  from  the  GCE  consultant  in  year  1  and  approved  by  the  ProSC  and  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank.  TPs  should  demonstrate  adequate  skills \ntraining  experience,  \nand have sufficient financial, human and technical resources. TPs should have proven previous \n\nfor  delivering  services  will  be  sought \n\n\f Appendix 4 \n\n35\n\nexperience  and  existing  networks  working  with  specific  target  groups  to  provide  appropriate \nGCE-sensitive community mobilization services and training. TPs should demonstrate adequate \ntraining package plans that meet criteria for TNA, training, and post-training services with clear \noutputs  and  indicators.  Women  instructors  should  be  part  of  the  training  resource  for  district \ncentre-based training, for the purposes of training community women, where possible. If district-\nlevel training is required, separate women-only training should be considered where necessary. \nTraining  providers  must  agree  to  identify  adequate  and  secure  accommodation  for  women \nattending  district  level  training.  DCSI/CSIDB  needs  to  ensure  that  modalities  and  transparent \ncriteria  developed  by  the  PIU  are  applied  before  accepting  proposals  and  ensure  that  poor \napplicants  are  selected  for  training.  TP  should  ensure  that  information  on  specific  targeted \nsubsidies to the poorest and disadvantaged groups is made explicit in the tender document. \n \n\n3. \n\nComponent 2:  Capacity Strengthening \n\n12.  \nThe GCE consultant will support the research and information division of CTEVT, which \nwill  be  strengthened  towards  more  effective  sector  analysis,  coordination,  and  strategic \nplanning, including a GCE perspective. Reports on the performance of the sub-sector, including \nGCE-disaggregated statistics on short-term  training  and skills testing results, will be published \nannually.  Through  this  division,  CTEVT  will  prepare  four  GCE-sensitive  tracer  studies  for  the \nProject.  \n \n13.  \nTraining  packages  to  be  prepared  for  trainers,  training  supervisors,  and  training \nmanagers will include a module on how to build awareness of GCE and social inclusion issues, \nwhich  need  to  be  addressed  in  TNA,  trainee  selection,  planning,  implementation,  and \nemployment opportunities. The GCE sensitization module will be developed in year 1 with the \nsupport  of  the  GCE  specialist,  and  will  include  the  means  to  address  the  following  issues:  \n(i)  GCE  awareness  building  and  changing  negative  personal  attitudes;  (ii)  issues  of  mobility, \nparticularly for women; (iii) targeting of  Dalit men and women can be targeted for better access \nto TVET training; (iv) \u201cwomen-only\u201d training for district centre-based in secure accommodation; \n(v) training instructors in the relevant language; and (vi) women instructors for women trainees.   \n\n \n14.  \nThe  TMIS  capacity  of  public  training  providers  will  be  strengthened  by  the  Project  to \nfacilitate  the  sharing  of  GCE-disaggregated  data  and  information  between  the  provider  and \nCTEVT.  This  will  contribute  to  the  provision  of  better  GCE-disaggregated  information  about \ntraining demand, delivery, and outcomes. The GCE consultant will support the TMIS capacity-\nbuilding effort to ensure GCE-sensitive data and processes are incorporated into the TMIS. \n \n15.   GCE  Awareness Training Component for DCSI/CSIDB.  District officers of DCSI and \nCSIDB  will  be  trained  in  strengthening  their  roles  in  community  liaison  and  facilitation.  \nThis training package will include the same GCE module as mentioned above on sensitization \nto  GCE  and  social  inclusion  issues  that  need  to  be  addressed  in  market-oriented  short-term \nskills \nimplementation,  and  post-training \nservices/employment opportunities. \n \n\ntrainee  selection,  planning, \n\ntraining  TNA, \n\n4. \n\nComponent  3:    Supporting  the  Policy  Development,  Articulation,  and \nImplementation \n\n16. \nThe  national  TEVT  Policy  Coordination  Committee  will  include  representatives  of \nthe  disabled,  and  other  disadvantaged  groups.  \nwomen,  dalits, \nThese representatives will participate in the ongoing policy dialogue and stakeholder workshops \nto refine and finalize policy. This will ensure that the policy and framework addresses inclusion \n\nindigenous  groups, \n\n\f36\n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\nof women, poor, and disadvantaged groups and other associated key issues. In addition, central \nand district steering committees will include a similar representation as above. \n \n\n5.  \n\nGCE-Disaggregated Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n17.   Community-Based  Pilot  Program  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  A  GCE-sensitive \nmonitoring and evaluation system will be developed by the PIU, supported by the TMIS and the \nGCE specialist in year 2 and training will be delivered in its application to DCSI and CSIDB staff \nin the pilot districts from year 2.  \n \n18.  \nFor All Project Components. The national GCE consultant will assist the international \nand national TMIS specialists to ensure all data collected in the TMIS system is disaggregated \nby  gender,  caste,  ethnicity,  age  and  poverty  and  to  conduct  training  of  CTEVT  staff,  \nas  necessary,  to  analyze  data  from  a  GCE  perspective.  In  particular,  the  GCE  specialist  will \nensure monitoring and evaluation procedures include indicators for monitoring impact of TEVT \nservices on target groups, as well as extent of participation of better off and poor men, women \nand  children,  and  socially  excluded  groups  such  as  Dalits  and  disadvantaged  groups.  \nThe  design  of  the  TMIS  will  elicit  data  on  GCE  issues  that  impact  on  the  effectiveness  of \ndifferent  approaches  adopted  to  meet  the  needs  of  these  groups,  benefits,  and  constraints. \nThese  data  will  be  used  to  adjust  Project  design  and  approaches  as  necessary  as  part  of a \nprocess approach. Data will be evaluated and disseminated by trained CTEVT staff. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN  \nTable A5.1: Cost Estimates \n($'000) \nTotal Cost\nLC\n\nTotal\n\nFX\n\nFX\n\nADB Financed\nLC\n\nTotal\n\nGovernment\nLC\nTotal\n\n \n\nIncreasing Access to Market-Oriented Short-Term Skills Training\n1.

Nepal\u2019s  economic  performance  in  recent  years \n1. \nhas been poor with low potential for improvement in the medium term. The  Nepalese economy \nis  largely  dependent  on  agriculture,  with  the  services  and  industry  sectors  growing  in \nimportance.  Gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  fiscal  year  (FY)  2003  was  estimated  at  \n$5.9 billion1 and the growth rate at 3.1%.2 The services and the agriculture sectors are the largest \nsectors  in  the  economy,  each  contributing  close  to  40%  of  GDP,  while  the  industry  sector \ncontributed about  21%.  Remittances  from  workers  abroad  are  estimated  to  contribute  25%  of \nGDP.3 The services and industry sectors grew more than the agriculture sector in FY2003; the \naverage  annual  growth  of  services  and  industry  sectors  were  2.7%  and  2.3%,  respectively, \nwhile the agriculture sector grew 2.1%. Agriculture employs the most workers, absorbing about \n75% of the labor force. In contrast, the services and industry sectors employ only about 23%.4 \nThe  total  unemployment  rate  is  estimated  at  17.4%,  which  is  largely  accounted  for  by \nunderemployment;  the  unadjusted  unemployment rate is 5%.  Approximately  three  quarters of \nthe underemployed are estimated to be in the agriculture sector. The Government estimates the \nlabor  force  will increase  by  1.05  million  during  the  Tenth  Plan  period,  2002\u20132007,  or  about \n200,000 new workers each year. \n \n2. \nA  major  constraint  to  employment is the lack of  appropriate skills  needed  in  the  labor \nmarket.  A  reduction  in  underemployment  will  require  shifting  some  of  the  labor  force  from \nagriculture  to  the  other  sectors in  both  local  and  foreign  labor  markets  through  labor  market \nanalyses  and  market-orientation  of  training  programs  in  technical  education  and  vocational \ntraining  (TEVT)  institutions.  The  current  provision  of  TEVT  has  had  little  success  in  delivering \neffective  training.  Ineffectiveness  stems  from  the  (i)  irrelevance  of  curricula,  (ii)  low  quality  of \ntraining, and (iii) lack of posttraining support. This has resulted in low external efficiency; the job \nplacement rate of training completers is estimated at 50%. The TEVT sector  requires a change \nin its training delivery mechanisms to develop a more effective and efficient system. \n \n3. \nDemand  Analysis.  Demand  for  vocational  training  is  substantial.  About  200,000 \nworkers  enter  the  workforce  each  year.  As  the  completion  rate  of  secondary  education  is \napproximately 12%, approximately 88% of the new entrants to the workforce are likely to require \ntraining  for  basic  vocational  skills.  However,  only  50,000  places  are  available  for  vocational \ntraining each year, leaving a large demand gap. \n \n4. \nThe  Tenth  Plan  provides  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  for  employment  creation.  \nThe strategy indicates that demand for nonagricultural workers will increase, implying a need for \nnonagricultural  training  for  the  future  workforce.  In  2004,  75%  of  employment  will  be  in \nagriculture,  but the proportion will gradually  decline  to 70%  by  2007.  To  achieve  the  shift  of \nemployment from agriculture to nonagriculture sectors, approximately 200,000 people, the same \nnumber  of  people  as  the  new  entrants  to  the  workforce,  will  be  recruited  in  nonagriculture \nsectors. Therefore, the economy will have sufficient demand for those with nonagricultural skills. \n\n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2004. Nepal at a Glance.

Available: (www.adb.org/statistics). \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n47\n\nThe  international  labor  market,  on  the  other  hand,  offers  the  greatest  scope  for  absorbing  the \nincreasing  number  of  new  workforce,  particularly  among  the  semiskilled  and  skilled.  Nepal \ncurrently meets foreign requests for unskilled labor but not that for semiskilled or skilled labor.  \nIn  the  various  skill  areas  sought  by  manpower  agencies  in  2002  (footnote  3), only 866  were \nsupplied out of the 55,956 semiskilled and skilled workers sought. The scope for increasing the \nnumber of  semiskilled  international  workers  is  considerable,  implying  substantial  demand  for \nvocational training. \n \nConsideration of Design Alternatives. To support the  Government\u2019s strategies under \n5. \nthe  Tenth  Plan,  intervention  for  the TEVT sector  had two  main  options: support  TEVT policy \nreforms associated with restructuring  a  vocational training system  through  a  program  loan, or \nfocus on ensuring effective and efficient delivery of training at institutional and community levels \nthrough  an  investment  loan.  While  support  to  TEVT  policy  reforms  prior  to  any  project \ninvestments  is  a  rational  approach  from  a  development  perspective,  implementation  and \nenforcement  of  systemic  reforms  in  every  part  of  the  country  through  government  agencies \nwould be  difficult  at  this  time,  given  the  conflict  situation.  On  the  other  hand,  while  project \ninvestment at institutional and community levels may  not immediately address the nature of the \nproblem,  it  is  likely  to  impact  on  effectiveness  and  efficiency  in  a  short  period  of  time.  \nThe proposed Project  has  therefore  taken  a  middle  path,  in  which  support  is  extended  to  the  \n(i)  TEVT  policy  reform  process,  while  (ii)  strengthening  the  framework of  the  TEVT system,   \n(iii)  incorporating  labor  market  information  analysis  to  training  planning  and  delivery,  and   \n(iv) improving the delivery of training in both public and private institutions in selected districts. \n \n6. \nEconomic Internal Rate of Return. To assess the economic viability and efficiency of \nthe investment under the Project, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) over 25 years was \nestimated.  Economic  benefits  of  the  Project  are  derived  mainly  from  (i)  increased  access  to \ntraining  institutions,  and  (ii)  improved  relevance  and  quality  of  skills  training.  The  economic \nimpacts are estimated using future salary increments as a result of completing  market-oriented \nshort  term  skills  training  supported  by  the  Project.  The  estimate  is  based  on  conservative \nassumptions,  employing  the  minimum  wage  of  unskilled  and  semiskilled  local  workers  rather \nthan market wages.  \n \nIncrease  in  access  is  represented  by  the  growth in  enrollment  as  a  result  of  newly \n7. \nintroduced short-term training programs. The  Project will fund the cost of an additional 100,000 \ntrainees  in  short-term  vocational  training  programs  in  6  years.  The  additional  training  will  be \nterminated  by  project completion.  Two  types  of  employment  opportunities  are available  after \ntraining:  local  and  foreign.  The  analysis  assumes that  unemployed and unskilled workers will \nbecome  semiskilled  workers  by  obtaining  the  appropriate skills and  the  ethos as future  labor \nmarket participants. This increases their productivity and will raise their annual wage by about \n$8  and  $1,500  in  the  following  5  years,  depending  on  the  employment  status  prior  to  the \ntraining, and local and foreign employment opportunities.  \n \n8. \nImproved relevance and quality of training raises labor productivity and is measured  by \nthe extent to which training  completers earn more than the  minimum wage, on the assumption \nthat newly designed courses and better institutional management will increase the effectiveness \nof training  delivery,  and  thus  better  performance  at  workplaces.  The  Project  will  support  the \nimprovement of both existing and new training programs. Completion of short-term skills training \nis assumed to increase annual earnings by 1.3% in the following 5 years.5 Increased relevance \n\n                                                 \n5  New short-term  vocational  training  programs  are  estimated  to  allow  the  trainees  to  earn  the  wage  value  at  the \n  middle of semiskilled and skilled worker thresholds for the national minimum wage. \n\n\f48\n\nAppendix 10 \n\nand improved quality will improve  external efficiency; this is measured by the difference in the \nemployment rates of the completers of short-term skills training between the with- and without-\nproject  scenario,  based  on  the  assumption  that  improved  educational  curricula,  better \ninstructional  techniques,  and  assistance  for  job  placement  will  create  more  employment \nopportunities,  particularly  internationally.  Currently,  approximately  50%  of  graduates  and \ncompleters are estimated to not be able to  obtain jobs immediately after completion. During the \nProject, the employment rate of the completers is envisaged to gradually improve to 60%. At the \nsame time, the proportion of those who choose to work abroad is assumed to be the same as \nthe immigration rate of the country, and will increase by 20% during the 6-year project period as \na result of receiving market-oriented, short term skills training assisted by the Project. \n \n9. \nEconomic costs are divided into (i) investment cost of the Project, (ii) recurrent cost, and \n(iii) private and opportunity costs. The cost of the  Project is estimated at $25 million. Recurrent \ncost  includes  additional  administrative  expenses  of  improving  the  provision  of  short-term \ntraining, which gradually  increases from $56,000 to $305,000 during the 6-year project period. \nThe recurrent cost remains at $305,000 after the project period. Private costs include the out-of-\npocket expenses of  trainees  for  a  short-term,  3-month  training  program;  and  are estimated at \n$20  per  program.  Opportunity  cost  is  equivalent to the income  that a  trainee  would  otherwise \nreceive when not engaged in the short-term skills training for 3 months and is estimated at $68. \n \n\nEconomic Benefit of Increased Access \n\nTable A10.1 : Assumptions for Economic Internal Rate of Return Estimates \n \n \n\nImpact of short-term vocational training on annual salary  \n\nTrainees who were unemployed and seek local employment \nTrainees who were unemployed and seek international employment \nTrainees who were unskilled workers and seek local employment \nTrainees who were unskilled workers and seek international employment \n\n \nEconomic Benefit of Improved Quality of Training \n\nDegree of improvement in earning \n\n \nEconomic Benefit of Improved External Efficiency \n\nJob placement rate among training completers without Project \nDegree of improvement in job placement rate among training completers  \nProportion of those who seek international employment after training \nDegree of increase in international employment among training completers  \n\n \nEconomic Cost of Proposed Project \n\nRecurrent cost after the project period \nPrivate cost (per training program per trainee) \nOpportunity cost (per training program per trainee) \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.   \n\n$417 \n$3,712 \n$8 \n$3,440 \n \n \n1.3% \n \n \n50% \n20% \n3.3% \n20% \n \n \n$305,000 \n$20 \n$68 \n\n \n10. \nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  yield  a  net  present  value  of  $22.3  million,  assuming  a \ndiscount rate of 12.0%; the EIRR is estimated at 28.2%. The actual EIRR is likely to be higher in \nview  of  economywide  multiplier  effects  of  remittances  and  social  benefits in terms of  positive \nwork ethics and addressing an underlying cause of the conflict. \n \nSensitivity  Analysis.  A sensitivity analysis  was  undertaken  on  the  basis  of  alternative \n11. \nassumptions  regarding  the  extent  to  which  the  Project  achieves  improved  access,  training \nquality, and external  efficiency. The targets of the  Project are approximately 100,000 additional \ntrainees  per  year,  3.1%  increase  in  earnings,  and  20%  increase  in  job placement rate among \ntraining  completers.  For  analytical  purposes,  the  sensitivity  of  the  EIRR  was  tested  by \nemploying extreme values. In the low case scenario, improvements through the Project are 50% \nless than the target; the target for additional trainees is reduced to 51,000 and earning and job \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n49\n\nplacement  rates  increase  by  1.5%  and  10%,  respectively.  In  the  high  case  scenario,  Project \nbenefits  are  50%  more  than  the  target;  the  number  of  trainees  is  increased  to  153,000  and \nearning  and  job  placement  rates  increase  by  4.6%  and  30%,  respectively.  The  results  are \nshown in Table A10.2. \n \n\nTable A10.2 : Sensitivity Analysis \n(%) \nLow Case \n11.9 \n        (57.8) \n         26.2 \n          (7.1) \n         26.6 \n           5.7  \n\nItem \nIncrease in Access \n(degree of change) \nQuality Improvement \n(degree of change) \nExternal Efficiency \n(degree of change) \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.   \n\n          28.2 \n            0 \n          28.2 \n            0 \n          28.2 \n            0 \n\n         44.5 \n         57.8 \n         30.2 \n           7.1 \n         29.8 \n           5.7 \n\nNormal Case \n\nHigh Case \n\nPoverty Impact Analysis \n\n \n12. \nThe results indicate that the Project will bring substantial benefits to the economy when \nall  the  degrees  of  improvement  in  the  three  areas  exceed the targets.  However,  an excessive \nincrease in access may result in overcrowded training programs, which is likely to lead to lower \nquality  of  training.  The  results  also  indicate  that  the  Project  is  highly  sensitive  to  access.  \nA  decline  in  the  degree  of  improvement  in  access  could  render  the  Project  economically \nnonviable. The calculation indicates that the Project must achieve at least 50.2% of the increase \nin access target. Collaboration with employers, manpower agencies, private and public training \nproviders, and community-based organizations under the Project will contribute to achieving the \nminimum target. \n \nB.  \n \n13. \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  providing  the  unemployed  and \nunderemployed  with  more  opportunities  to  receive  wages  in  the  labor  market  through  skills \ntraining, guidance, and job placement programs.  About 38% of the population lives in poverty. \nThe national poverty line in Nepal, based on the caloric norm of 2,124 calories per adult daily \nequivalent and nonfood basic needs, is estimated at NRs4,404 ($58.7) per month.6 The direct \nbeneficiaries of  the  Project are  trainees  in  market-oriented,  short-term  skills  training, who are \neither  unskilled  workers  or  unemployed,  and  whose  earning  levels are  likely to be below  the \npoverty  line.  A  trainee who  completes  skills  training  is  expected  to have sufficient skills to be \nemployed  as  a  semiskilled worker and  be entitled to  receive,  at  least,  the  national  minimum \nwage at  NRs2,610 ($34.8) per month, once  successfully  employed  in  the  local  labor  market.  \nAs 42.6% of the employed population has a second job in agriculture or  in industry,7 a similar \nproportion  of  the  training  completers  are  likely  to  engage  in  a  second  job  and  will  earn  an \nadditional income at least  NRs73 ($1.0) per day.8 This will bring the monthly earnings closer to \nthe  national  poverty  line.  In case of  international employment, a  training  completer  is  likely  to \nearn the average wage of a semiskilled international worker at $318.0 per month, which is well \nabove the national poverty line.  \n \n  Overall,  assuming  that  all  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  are  unemployed  or  unskilled \n14. \nworkers and, hence, in poverty, the  estimated impact of the Project on poverty reduction is that \n\n                                                 \n6  Japan Bank for International Cooperation. 2003.

Kathmandu. \n8  Minor  workers (workers below  the  age  of 18) receive a national minimum daily wage  of NRs73  and  can  work  no \n\nmore than 6 hours  a day. \n\n\f50\n\nAppendix 10 \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n2.4%  of  the  beneficiaries  will  be  able  to  earn  more  than  the  poverty  line,  and  24.5%  will  earn \nmore  than the  food  poverty  line  of  NRs2,637  ($35.2)  (that  may  not  be  sufficient  to  cover  the \nadditional  expenditure  for  nonfood  consumption);  33.1%  will  earn  just  below  the  food poverty \nline; and 40.0% will still be in poverty.  The estimate is based on the employment status of the \ntrainee immediately after completing skills training. All beneficiaries will  be able to earn at least \n$34.8  after  training  completion,  and  with  the  improved  access  to  labor  market  information,   \nthose still in poverty will likely be able to find new or additional jobs in the future. \n \nC.  \n \n15. \nThe  TEVT sector is  growing and heavily dependent  on  the  development  budget.  Total \nbudget for TEVT provision under  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  Sports,  Ministry  of  Labor  and \nTransport  Management, and  Ministry  of  Industry, Commerce, and Supplies  in  FY2004/05 was \nestimated  at  NRs425 million\u20140.4% of the  total  Government budget.  The TEVT sector budget \ngrew by 22.1% in FY2003/04 and 9.7% in FY2004/05. The growth of regular budget in the TEVT \nsector  has  been  in  line  with  that  of  total  Government  budget  in  FY2003/04  and  FY  2004/05, \nwhile  the  growth  level  of  development  budget  depends  upon  the  number  of  programs  and \nprojects committed in each year.  Approximately  96.7% of  the  TEVT budget was sourced from \nthe  development  budget,  which  covers  the  cost  of  the  training  programs,  including  salary  for \ntrainers,  training  materials,  stipends  for  trainees,  and  operation  and  maintenance  of  training \ncenters.  Regular  budget,  which  covers  the  cost  of  establishment  and  utilities, was only 3.3%.  \nAt  the  department level,  the  Council  for  Technical  Education  and  Vocational  Training  receives \nthe  largest  proportion  of  the  TEVT  budget  at  32.5%  in  FY2004/05. At  the  ministerial  level, \nhowever,  the  Ministry  of  Industries,  Commerce,  and  Supplies, which  includes  Department of \nCottage and Small Industries and Cottage and Small Industries Development Board, obtains the \nlargest proportion at 44.6%. \n \n16. \nFinancial affordability and sustainability of the Project is analyzed based on the medium-\nInternational  Monetary  Fund \nterm  macroeconomic  framework  in  the  Tenth  Plan  and \nprojections.9  The  GDP  growth  rate  is  assumed  to  be  constant  at  4.6%,  and  the  Government \nbudget  as  a  proportion  of  GDP  at  around  23.7%  between  FY2005/06  and  FY  2011/12.  \nThe  proportion  of  the  relevant  ministerial  and  departmental  budget  in  the  total  Government \nbudget will remain constant as that in FY2004/05, given an assumption that the Government will \ntry to allocate the same level of development budget from both its own and external sources. \n \n17. \nThe forecast indicates that,  by the end of the proposed Project, the TEVT sector budget \nwill have increased by  NRs141 million ($1.9 million)  from FY2005/06, including NRs133 million \n($1.8 million) in the development  budget and  NRs8 million ($0.1 million) in the regular budget. \nAdditional recurrent cost after project implementation are estimated  at $0.4, including salary of \nadditional staff, operation and maintenance cost of newly introduced information systems, and \nexpenses  for  new  administrative  procedures.  Given  that  the  regular  budget  finances  only \nestablishment and utility charges and  that TEVT institutions cannot easily increase the size of \ntheir  establishment,  the  majority  of  the  cost  has  to  be  financed  from  the  development  budget. \nThe  additional  development  budget  in  FY2011/12  will  be  sufficient  to  cover  the  additional \nrecurrent cost attributable to the Project. \n\n                                                 \n9  http://www.imf.org/external/country/NPL/index.htm. \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n51\n\n \nIMPLEMENTATION OF SKILLS TRAINING PROGRAMS IN CONFLICT -AFFECTED AREAS  \n\nIntroduction \n\nincludes  decentralization,  more  participatory  approaches \n\n \nA.  \n \nThe  conflict  has  hampered  the  implementation  of  projects  in  many  parts  of  Nepal.1 \n1.  \nImplementation  has  continued  for  some,  but  at  a  slower  pace.  Problems  encountered  have \nbeen  location-specific.  Problems  include  fielding  consultants,  obtaining  government  staff \nparticipation in the field, and delivering project inputs.2 For more effective implementation, some \nprojects have employed community-based organizations. In the complex area of policy reform, \nparticularly related to legislation, progress has been slow due to the complex political situation. \n \nGovernment Strategy.  The  Government  acknowledges  that  the  conflict  is  making  the \n2.  \nimplementation  of  development  activities  programs  difficult \nin  conflict-affected  areas.  \nIn response, it has adopted near-term and longer term strategies to complement implementation \nof its poverty reduction strategy. The Government will, among others, support community-driven \ninitiatives,  involve  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs) and  community-based  organizations, \nand  target  the  most  conflict-affected  zones.  In  addition,  in  the  longer  term,  the  Government \nstrategy \nto  planning  and \nimplementation, and targeted actions to reach excluded groups. \n \n3.  \nAsian  Development  Bank  Strategy.  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  operations  in \nNepal  have  been  affected  by  the  security  situation.  Of  the  ongoing  21  ADB-assisted  projects, \nonly  7  are  classified  as  \u201clittle  or  not  affected.\u201d3  The  ADB  strategy  supports  a  more  inclusive \ndevelopment  process  by  undertaking  a  conflict  assessment,  adopting  participatory  processes, \nmainstreaming  inclusion,  and  ensuring  transparency  and  accountability.  ADB  will  also  adopt \nflexible implementation modalities. \n \nThe Project.  The  Project  addresses  some  of  the  root causes of the conflict, including \n4.  \npoverty;  unemployment  and  underemployment;  and  lack  of  economic  opportunities  for  the \nyouth,  poor, and  disadvantaged.  The  Project  supports  the  provision  to  the  unemployed  and \nunderemployed  of  more  market-oriented  training  in  skill  areas  needed  by  the  domestic  and \ninternational  labor  markets.  Training  programs  to  be  supported  are  short-term  and  are  thus \naccessible  to  more  trainees,  especially  for  those  with  less  than  grade  10  qualifications.  \nThe  Project  emphasizes  local  participation  in  training  needs  assessments  and  in  the \norganization of training activities, and the use of NGOs or community-based organizations in the \ncommunities. Women, Dalits (low caste), and disadvantaged groups are targeted to comprise at \nleast  60%  of  training  beneficiaries  in  communities.  District  officials  will  be  given  training  in \nliaising  with  communities  to  increase  their  responsiveness  to  communities\u2019  needs.  Training \npackages for staff of training providers will include a module on building awareness of gender, \ncaste,  and  ethnicity,  and  social  inclusion  issues.  Implementation  will also  be  phased;  lessons \nlearned  during  implementation  of  skill  training  activities  in  the  first  year  will  contribute  to  fine-\ntuning implementation arrangements, procedures, and criteria to better achieve project goals. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  For a discussion of the impact of conflict on project implementation and Asian Development Bank operations, see \n  Asian Development Bank. 2004.

The  German  aid \norganization  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  (GTZ)  found  better \nsuccess in the conflict situation by improving targeting of the needy and increasing transparency \nof  actions  toward  all  stakeholders.5  Projects  need  to  be  either  politically  neutral  or  consistent \nwith  insurgents\u2019  views.  Training  and  other  services  are  generally  seen  more  favorably  than \ncapacity  building,  which  is  seen  as  political  in  nature.  International  and  domestic  NGOs, for \nexample,  have  been  advised  to  focus  on  development  activities  and  be  transparent  about \nbudgets and allocation of resources to show evidence that budgets are spent on the community.   \n \nThe  experience  of  CARE-Nepal  has  revealed  the  following  factors  as  important  for  the \n6. \nsuccess  of  a  project  in  conflict  areas:6 (i)  completion of  an  in-depth situational analysis before \ndesigning  and  implementing  projects;  (ii)  close  liaison  with  district  administrative  authorities;   \n(iii)  financial  transparency  in  program  activities  conducted  at  community  level;  (iv)  focus  on \npeople\u2019s  participation  and  community-based  organization  networks  as  implementing  partners; \n(v)  strong  internalization  of  the  values  of  the  organization  to  maintain  a  neutral  stance;  and   \n(vi) participation of communities, including the disadvantaged, in project activities. \n\n \n\nSimilarly the experience of Action Aid Nepal shows a need  for the following (footnote 6): \n7.  \n(i) a broader understanding of conflict and causes; (ii) a participatory approach; (iii) observance \nof humanitarian principles; (iv) adoption of a pro-poor agenda; (v) a  decentralized approach to \nimplementation;  (vi)  addressing  the  negative  impacts, while understanding positive impacts of \nstruggle;  and  (vii)  flexibility  in  adapting  interventions  to  changes  in  the  dynamics  of  conflict.  \nAction  Aid  Nepal and other implementation agencies are finding they need to face the issue of \nconflict rather than go around it.  \n \nThree projects7 presently being implemented in conflict-affected areas possess many of \n8.  \nthe  factors  enumerated  in  paras.  6  and  7.  Common  to  all  three  are  (i)  targeting  the \ndisadvantaged,  (ii)  providing  needed  services,  and  (iii)  involving  local  communities  to  varying \ndegrees. \n \nC.  \n \n9.  \nSupporting  Training  Institutions.  In  all  societies  in  which  conflict  occurs,  some \ninstitutions  continue  to  have  importance  for  all  sides  even  though  they  are  fighting.  Training \ninstitutions,  for  example,  can  connect  people  and  provide  continuity  even  when  people  are \ndivided in conflict.8 The Project has a potential opportunity to influence the prominence of peace \ncapacities by supporting training institutions in their role as a \u201cconnector\u201d of people, by positively \nchanging  institutional  and  individual  attitudes  and  actions  for  peace.  The  Project  will  provide \n\nThe Project in the Context of the Conflict \n\n                                                 \n4  Mahat,  P.  2003.

In  addition,  training \ninstitutions will begin to take action for peace by expanding access to short-term skills training \nand posttraining support opportunities by training substantial numbers of men and women from \nsocially  excluded  and  marginalized  groups,  as  well  as  poor  socioeconomic  groups.  A  target \ngroup quota is in place and will be closely monitored to ensure smooth implementation. \n \n10.   Conflict-Affected  Youth.  Conflict  that  continues  over  a  number  of  years  can  leave  a \ngeneration of young people who know no other vocation and have no or only a few civilian skills. \nThey can find no other employment and thus have an interest in continued fighting (footnote 8). \nCurrently,  many  insurgent  recruits  have  poor  prospects  for  alternative  sources  of  employment \nand may also be unable to return to their communities. The Project has the potential to provide \nan  alternative  route  to  employment  through  skills  that  could  reduce  the  incentives  for  young \nrecruits  to  continue  fighting.  The  Project  therefore  recognizes  conflict-affected  youth  as  a \nspecial needs group that will benefit from subsidized short-term skills training for employment.  \n \nForeign  Employment.  About  a  quarter  of  Nepalese  households  receive  remittances.  \n11.  \nIn rural areas, off-farm wage work is an important source of livelihood accounting for about 38% \nof  income.  This  reflects  own-farm  food  deficits.  Foreign  migration  indicates  a  lack  of  domestic \nemployment and economic opportunities. Estimates of  international  remittances range from a \nconservative 10% of the  gross domestic product to as high as  25%.9 The Project is expected to \nexpand  opportunities  for  foreign  employment  and  hence  increase  much  needed  remittances . \nThis would offset the trend in Nepal's trade balance, as well as reduce poverty for many families \nin rural Nepal. \n \n12.   Community-Based  Skills  Training.  Community-based,  market-oriented  short-term \nskills training  and  posttraining  support  is  an  important  component  of  the  Project  and  has  the \npotential  to  benefit  poor  and  marginalized  groups,  particularly  women  who  are  confined  to \nvillages and are managing the home-farms in the absence of men who have migrated, as well \nas  conflict-affected women and men.  From 150,000 to 200,000 people  are  estimated  to  have \nleft  their  homes  as  a  result  of  the  conflict.10 The Project  recognizes  that  people  left  behind  in \nvillages  must  adjust  and  compensate  for  the  loss  of  family  or  community  members.  Indeed \nthese people are recognized as among the most impoverished and the most vulnerable; hence \nthe importance given to the community-based, skills training component. \n\n                                                 \n9  Department for International Development Nepal. 2002.

In  view  of  the  current  situation  where  growth  in \nformal sector employment is  limited,  international  requests  for  unskilled,  semiskilled,  and  skilled  workers \nare  not  being  filled,  and  relevant  skills  are  lacking,  the  most  promising  areas  for  income  generation  are \nfrom international employment and self-employment. The Project aims to increase the  in-country capacity \nto  provide  more  skills  training  addressing  these  specific  areas  of  employment  to  enable  poor  Nepalese \nmen and women to be more productive and competitive in the labor market.  \n \nSkills  formation  can  play  a  major  role  in  giving  people  employable  skills  to  earn  income.  The  technical \neducation  and  vocational  training  (TEVT)  sector,  particularly  vocational  training,  addresses  the  need  for \nemployable  skills  by  those  without  school-leaving certificates (SLCs), especially the poor. Admission into \nvocational  training  programs  offered  by  the  Cottage  and  Small  Industries  Development  Board  and  the \nDepartment  of  Cottage  and  Small  Industries  do  not  require  SLCs.  Training  institutions  of  the  Council  for \nTechnical Education and Vocational Training, and private training institutions also offer  vocational training \nthat does not require SLC, but the number and range of courses needs to be expanded to improve access \nto  vocational training  for poor and marginalized groups. \n \nSkill  acquisition  in  occupational  areas  needed  by  the  market  increases  the  likelihood  of  employment  and \nself-employment  of  trainees.  To  date,  training  programs  have  had  mixed  results  with  employment  rates, \nranging  from  30%  to  80%.  Better  matching  of  labor  supply  (skills  training  programs)  with  demand  is \nneeded  to  improve  employment  rates  of  trainees.  Improved  identification  of  potential  areas  of  income \ngeneration  in  communities  and  linkages  with  posttraining services will increase the likelihood of success \nfor  self-employment  activities.  Increasing  access  to  market-oriented,  short-term  skills  training  will  provide \nmany of the poor and the disadvantaged with increased opportunities for earning income. \n \nIn a study by  the  Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation (SDC)  (2003), over 90% of the workers in \nthe survey who traveled  for international work are \u201csimply literate.\u201d Workers who were literate or with grade \n1 to 5 education were offered about  NRs12,000 per month on average. In comparison, skilled construction \nworkers  in  Nepal\u2019s  urban  areas  are  paid  about  NRs200  per  day,  while  unskilled  workers  receive  about \nNRs100 per day (just over a dollar per day).     \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                     Proposed Classification:  Targeted Intervention \n                                                                         Inclusive Social Development, Gender and Development \n \nPoverty  in  Nepal  is  a  deep-rooted  and  complex  phenomenon.  After  the  political  change  of  1990,   \nthe  economy  and  government  actions  have  largely  failed  to  fulfill  earlier  expectations  about  poverty \nreduction.  Wide  disparities  persist  in  income  distribution  due  to  gender  discrimination,  social  exclusion,  \nand  lack  of  access  to  employment  opportunities,  particularly  for  the  poor,  Dalits  (low  caste),  and  ethnic \nminority  groups.  The  expanding  young  population  is  subjected  to  unemployment  and  underemployment, \nand  are  vulnerable  to  forced  recruitment  in  the  conflict.  The  poverty  ratio  declined  modestly  from  42%  at \nthe  beginning  of  the  Ninth  Plan  to  about  38%  in  2000/01.  Since  then,  given  the  sharp  decline  (by  about \n3%) in per capita  income  during 2001/ 02  due  to  continued  disruptions  to   investment   and   economic   \n\n \n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n55\n\nactivities caused by ongoing conflict, the poverty situation in rural areas has likely deteriorated significantly \nover  the  last  2  years  (2002/04).  The  progress  achieved  in  human  development  during  the  Ninth  Plan \nperiod  as  measured  by  key  indicators,  is  encouraging  in  areas  including  life  expectancy,  infant  mortality, \nmaternal  mortality,  total  fertility,  and  overall  population  growth  rate.  However,  in  other  areas  including \npercentage of  the  population  living  below  the  poverty  line,  adult  literacy,  women's  literacy,  net  primary  \nschool enrollment, and percentage of the population supplied with drinking water, progress has been less \nimpressive.  \n \nThe  current  economic  situation  is  weak.   The  recent  sociopolitical  turmoil  is  one  of  the  major  factors \ncontributing  to  this  economic  decline.  As  a  consequence  of  increasing  poverty,  including  lack  of  food \nsufficiency  and  lack  of  employment  in  many  parts  of  the  country,  a  growing  number  of  people  are \nmigrating  to  India  and  other  countries  for  work.  However,  many  lack the relevant skills to be competitive \nand receive higher wages in international labor markets. \n \nThe  poverty  analysis  based  on  the  1995/96  household  survey  data  indicates  wide  variations  by \nurbanization  level,  ecological  zones,  development  regions,  gender,  disability,  ethnicity, and caste groups. \nPoverty  in  Nepal  is  largely  a  rural  phenomenon  with  wide  variations  within  rural  areas  itself.  The  poverty \nrate  is  highest  in  the  more  remote  rural  areas\u2014the  Midwestern  and  Far  Western  hills  and  Mountain \nregions where it is as high as 72%. The rural Midwestern and Far Western  lowland regions are also much \npoorer  (53%  incidence)  than  the  national  average.  In  terms  of  ecological  zones,  poverty  in  the  Mountain \nregion is much higher in comparison  with others.  \n \nHouseholds headed by women  were poorer than those headed my men. In the 1995/96 household survey, \nhouseholds headed by women constituted 13% of all households at the national level; this number is likely \nto have increased significantly due to the ongoing conflict. Nepal has 13 districts\u2014mostly in the mountains \nand more remote hill areas (which  have high male migration)\u2014in which the ratio of households headed by \nwomen to those by men was found to be higher than 20%, which again is likely to have increased  due to \nthe conflict. Women's active participation in paid employment is limited\u2014currently women constitute only a \nthird of the total paid labor force. Moreover, when women enter the labor market, their wages even for the \nsame  type  of  work  continue  to  be  lower  than  men's.  Females  of  all  age-groups  have  to  work  more  hours \nthan  males.  This  difference  is  more  prominent  in  rural  areas  than  in  urban.  Nepal  has  made  significant \nprogress in increasing female life expectancy. Improvements are also visible in female literacy levels, and \nprimary and secondary school completion rates. However, large gender gaps remain in these indicators. \n \nNepal  has  several  indigenous  ethnic  (Janajatis)  and  caste  (Dalits)  groups,  which  have  been  historically \npolitically,  economically,  and  socially  excluded.  They  continue  to  lag  far  behind  in  income  and  assets \nlevels,  educational  achievements,  human  development  indicators,  and  in  representation  in  the  power \nstructure. Although discrimination in any form has been prohibited by the Constitution of Nepal since 1963, \nthe lowest hierarchy of Hindu caste system, the  Dalit, is synonymous to \u201cimpure and untouchable\u201d castes \nand are discriminated against. They are mainly people with specific lower level jobs such as cobbler, iron-\nsmith, and tailor. They have a high incidence of poverty. Badi (mostly so-called prostitute women living in \nMidwestern and Far  Western  regions) are also considered as Dalits and almost all are very poor. Another \nparticular  group  of  people,  a  majority  of  whom  are  poverty  stricken,  are  the  ex-Kamaiyas  who  were \nrecently  freed  from  a  form  of  bonded  labor.  About  4%  to  10%  of  people  in  Nepal  are  estimated  to  have \nsome form of disability; many are living under acute poverty. \n         \nC.

The  Technical  Assistance  Steering  Committee  included  representatives  from  Council  for \nTechnical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT) and other line ministries providing training Ministry \nof  Industries,  Commerce,  and  Supplies  (MOICS)  and  Ministry  of  Labor  and  Transport  Management \n(MOLTM),  private  employers,  private  training  providers,  and  social  welfare  council.  The  team  undertook \n\n\f \n\n56\n\nAppendix 12 \n\nconsultations  in  Biratnagar,  Janakpur,  Kathmandu  Valley,  Nepalgunj,  and  Pokhara;  while  field  workers \nvisited  Dang,  Dolakha,  Kavre,  Lukla,  Nawalparasi, Rupendehi,  Sarlahi, and  Siraha.  Various  stakeholders \nwere  met,  including  community  representatives,  not  only  from  these groups but also from women,  Dalits, \nand  other  disadvantaged  groups,  and  the  disabled.  Skills  training  needs  for  self-employment  were \nunderscored  by  rural  residents.  Potential  areas  for  skills  training  in  rural  areas  include  bicycle/rickshaw \nrepair,  house  wiring,  plumbing,  small  motor  maintenance  and  repair,  and  handicrafts;  in  urban  areas the \nopportunities extend to radio and television repair, garment making, carpentry and masonry; barber/beauty \nparlor  work,  computer  repair,  and  air-conditioning  repair.  Where  there  is  tourism,  potential  areas  for  self-\nemployment include cooking and  managing  a  lodge.  These  are  indicative  only  as  the  needs  in  each  area \ncan considerably vary. Other development partners were also consulted. The ongoing policy development \nactivity  also  examined  the  stakeholders  of  the  TEVT  system  and  established  a  policy  coordination \ncommittee consisting of representatives of over 20 stakeholders.  \n \nDuring  project  implementation,  CTEVT,  MOICS,  and  MOLTM  will  receive  capacity  strengthening \nassistance  to  increase  access  to  short-term  skills  training  to  poor  and  marginalized  groups,  and  to \nincrease  the  relevance  and  improve  the  quality  of  training. MOICS will be additionally strengthened in its \nliaison  role  with  communities  to  improve  its  coordination  with  communities,  and  more  effectively  identify \nand  provide  skills  training  to  target  groups  according  to  available  resources  and  opportunities. \nNongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  will  be  employed  in  community  mobilization  to  identify  community \nresources  and  opportunities,  and  prioritize \nthose \nrepresenting women and the disadvantaged, will be particularly consulted in the selection of trainees from \ntheir respective constituencies.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?                 \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe Government has taken steps to improve the status of women, e.g., repeal of some discriminatory laws \nagainst women and  establishment  of  the  National Women\u2019s Commission, and progress is being made in \nsome  human  development  indicators  for  women.  However,  much  remains  to  be  done.  The  Tenth  Plan \nrecognizes the need to establish the effective role of women in national economic and social development \nand puts forward specific gender-mainstreaming strategies.  \n         \nThe  Project  supports  the  goals  of  the  Tenth  Plan  and  aims  to  improve  the  labor  productivity  of  Nepalese,  \nincluding women and disadvantaged groups, by increasing access to relevant and quality market-oriented,  \nshort-term  skills  training.  The  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  include  women  and  disadvantaged  groups.   \nThe design of the Project includes the following measures to address gender issues: \n\ntraining  needs.  Community  groups,  especially \n\n   No          \n\n   Yes               \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv)  \n(v)  \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nWomen,  Dalits,  and  members  of  disadvantaged  groups will comprise at  least  60% of the \ntrainees  in  community-articulated  skills  training  programs.  At  least  50%  of  all  trainees  will \nbe women. \nWomen-friendly,  market-oriented,  short-term  skills  training  programs  will  be  developed \nand delivered.  \nThe Project Steering Committee will include at least three women members.  \nTraining instructors to be given training will include at least 10% women. \nWomen, as well as men, will be trained in community mobilization. \nGender-disaggregated  monitoring  indicators  and  database  will  be  included  in  the  project \nmanagement information system.  \nA  gender,  caste,  and  ethnicity  (GCE)  consultant  in  training  and  employment  will  be \nincluded  in  the  consulting  services  to  develop  a  gender  action  plan  based  on  the, GCE  \nstrategy  and  to  guide  the  project  implementation  unit  in  implementing,  monitoring,  and \nevaluation. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n57\n\n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nGender plan prepared?   \nA GCE strategy has been developed (Appendix 4).  \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\nE.

Community-\nbased skills training will be free of charge; \ncommunity contributions, e.g., venue for the conduct \nof training programs, may be requested as \nnecessary and appropriate. Provision of stipends to \nthe poor will be considered along guidelines to be \napproved by the Project Steering  Committee.  \n \nThe Project specifically addresses increasing labor \nproductivity through skill training to improve the \nlikelihood of obtaining employment in formal and \ninternational work, and in self-employment. \n\n \nThe Project targets disadvantaged groups, including \nthe  indigenous,  as  recipients  of  short-term  skills \ntraining.  A  GCE  strategy  (Appendix  4)  has  been \ndeveloped for the P roject to address issues of social \nand economic exclusion. \n \nThe conflict situation and political instability may \nhinder project implementation. This is \nacknowledged by the Project implementation \napproach and has been taken into consideration in \nthe Project design. Implementation  will thus be \nphased and start in five districts. Implementation \nexperience will be assessed  and adjusted, as \nnecessary, before new districts are served. NGOs \nwill be employed in working in districts, especially in \ncommunities.
