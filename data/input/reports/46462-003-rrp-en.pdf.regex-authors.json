THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nIndia  for  the  Odisha  Skill  Development  Project. 1  The  report  also  describes  proposed \nadministration of technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction for Capacity Building for the Odisha Skill Development Project, and if the Board \napproves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve \nthe TA. \n \n2.  The project will help the Government of Odisha train about 200,000 youth aged 15\u201334 to \nincrease their skills, employability, and income. The project aims to train new entrants and existing \nworkers  in  priority  sectors  such  as  manufacturing,  construction,  and  services  for  formal \nemployment. The project will benefit youth, women, and disadvantaged groups.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Odisha\u2019s economy is in transition, with the industry and services sectors having emerged \nas the main drivers of growth. Between 1996 and 2015, agriculture\u2019s share of gross state domestic \nproduct declined from 32% to 15%, industry\u2019s share almost doubled from 18% to 33%, and the \ncontribution of services stayed at around 51%. Odisha also achieved the largest reduction in \npoverty (by 25 percentage points) among India\u2019s major states between 2005 and 2013.3  Yet \nOdisha\u2019s  poverty  rate  at  33%  remains  one  of  the  highest  in  India.  Despite  economic \ntransformation, half of the working population continues to be employed in agriculture, while one-\nquarter are employed in industry and another quarter in services. Nearly 80% of the employed \nare in the informal sector. The main challenge for Odisha\u2019s economy lies in moving its labor force \nfrom the less productive agriculture and the informal sector to the more productive formal sector \nwhere wages are higher.4  \n \n4.  A core problem in Odisha is the low employability of its young workforce in the formal \nsector due to their low skill levels. Youth aged 15\u201334 make up one-third of Odisha\u2019s population of \n42 million. While the youth unemployment rate (6.8%) is slightly higher than the national average \n(5.8%), their underemployment rate (11.0%) is nearly double the national average (6.0%).5 Only \na very small proportion of the youth has had any formal vocational training (1.8%, compared to \nthe national average of 3.7%), and their education level is below the national average.6 Women \nare even less likely than men to be educated or have any formal vocational training, and a \nsignificant gender gap exists in labor force participation (29% for women and 80% for men aged \n15\u201334).  \n \n5.  Under the national \u201cMake in India\u201d and \u201cSkill India\u201d campaigns, the Government of India \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided a project preparatory TA. \n3   Government of Odisha. 2015.

New Delhi. \n5  ADB staff estimates using data from the Government of India, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. \nNational Sample Survey, 2011\u20132012. New Delhi. \n6  In Odisha, the percentage of youth with education up to grade 10 is 25% compared to 32% nationwide; and the \npercentage of those with a diploma or higher degree is 7% compared to 11% nationwide.  \n ", "2   \nemphasizes building the skills of the youth to obtain high-quality jobs and higher wages in the \nmanufacturing  and  services  sectors.  Yet,  states  like  Odisha,  which  have  large  tribal  and \ndisadvantaged populations and large young workforce, face significant challenges in equipping \ntheir  populations  with  skills  to  meet  labor  market  needs.  According  to  a  skills-gap  study \ncommissioned for Odisha by the National Skill Development Corporation, demand for semiskilled \nand skilled workers will continue to increase.7 The cumulative demand\u2013supply gap for skilled \nworkers during 2011\u20132026 is estimated to be about 4 million, with high demand in the sectors \nsuch as construction, manufacturing, transportation and logistics, information technology (IT) and \nIT-enabled services, education and financial services, and health care. Since Odisha is a net \nexporter of workers to other parts of India and abroad, the demand for skilled workers will likely \nbe even greater.  \n \n6.  Odisha aimed to train 1 million people by the end of India\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2012\u2013\n2017. It further aims to train additional 800,000 people by 2019. However, the capacity and quality \nof existing training programs are far from adequate to meet this target. The state has trained only \nabout 330,000 people during 2014\u20132015. To cope with skilling demand, the state government \nhas introduced several initiatives. It established a high-level Odisha State Employment Mission \n(OSEM) in 2005\u20132006 to address the problems of youth unemployment and underemployment. \nIt also established the Skill Development and Technical Education Department (SDTED) in 2015 \nto improve coordination among different government agencies responsible for skills training, \nemployment generation services, and labor regulation.8 Yet, the state government\u2019s investment \nin skills training such as in industrial training institutes (ITIs) under the Directorate of Technical \nEducation and Training (DTET) has not responded adequately to industry needs due to poor \ntraining infrastructure and outdated skills standards, assessment, and certification processes.  \n \n7.  Odisha\u2019s  current  skills  development  system  faces  numerous  constraints:  (i)  training \ncapacity is insufficient to meet the 5-year plan target, and the geographic spread of training \ninstitutions is uneven; (ii) the quality and relevance of training is inadequate due to outdated \ncurricula and equipment, and a shortage of industry-experienced trainers, especially at ITIs; (iii) \na robust quality assurance system is lacking to benchmark training institutions to international \nstandards; (iv) employer linkages of training programs are weak; (v) limited autonomy in public \ninstitutions constrains market-responsive training; (vi) the skills ecosystem is fragmented with \nweak institutional coordination; (vii) mentoring institutions to transform ITIs into more effective \ninstitutions are absent; and (viii) viable training models are in need to deliver advanced skills \nprograms, particularly for  higher-cost, capital-intensive manufacturing.  \n \n8.  To address these constraints in skills development, the state government established an \nautonomous implementation institution in 2016, the Odisha Skill Development Authority (OSDA), \nheaded by an eminent industry leader.9 OSDA brings together all skills training programs of the \nstate under one strong coordinating entity to streamline existing institutional arrangements. OSDA \naims to achieve the state\u2019s skills targets by implementing high-quality, market-responsive training \nprograms in line with the state development strategies in priority sectors such as manufacturing, \nconstruction, and services (e.g., automotive and health care). To this end, OSDA has three \npriorities: (i) to enhance the ITIs\u2019 capacity; (ii) to accelerate training capacity by introducing eight \nnew advanced skills training institutes (ASTIs); and (iii) to scale up short-term, employment-\n                                                \n7   Ernst & Young. 2012. Skill Gap Assessment for the State of Odisha: A District Wise Analysis. Kolkata. \n8  The state government established the Employment, Technical Education, and Training Department in 2012, which \nwas renamed the SDTED in 2015. \n9   OSDA succeeds the previous Odisha Skill Development Society, created in 2015, by merging with OSEM. This \nmerger created a more consolidated institution to coordinate and implement skills development initiatives in Odisha.  \n \n ", "3 \nrelated training through private training providers.  \n      \n9.  The proposed project will help the Government of Odisha transform its skills development \nsystem by establishing eight new ASTIs and invigorating government ITIs under a hub-and-spoke \nmodel.10 The proposed model aims to expand the state\u2019s training capacity, uplift the quality of \nskills training, and strengthen the market relevance of training programs, which would enhance \nthe skills and employability of young workforce for the high-demand priority sectors. The project \ndesign incorporates emerging national and international good practices and lessons learned.11 \nThe following are specific innovative features of the project:   \n \n(i)  A hub-and-spoke model. The project will establish a network of eight ASTIs as \nhubs and 30 government ITIs as spokes. Each hub will serve as a resource center \nfor a group of ITIs by mentoring in pedagogy, technology use, industry linkages, \ntraining of trainers, recognition of prior learning (RPL), and other areas. Each hub \nand spoke will form a cluster that specializes in skills for a specific priority sector \naligned with labor market demands in Odisha, other parts of India, and overseas. \nThe strategic spread of the hubs in eight different locations across Odisha will \nprovide more equitable access to high-quality training by diverse groups. The \nmodel will leverage project resources to introduce operational efficiency from the \nprivate sector, uplift the quality of overall skills training, and complement other \ninitiatives in meeting the state\u2019s training targets.  \n \n(ii)  Private sector engagement. OSDA will engage experienced private training \ninstitutions to operate and maintain the ASTIs in partnership with international \npartners  and  strengthen  the  market  relevance  of  training  programs.  This \narrangement will support the \u201cMake in India\u201d and \u201cSkill India\u201d campaigns, by \nincentivizing private operators to develop sustainable quality training models and \nscale up skills for job opportunities in manufacturing and services within and \noutside Odisha. OSDA will also set up an industrial advisory committee consisting \nof one representative from each priority sector to facilitate on-the-job training, \nupskilling of existing workers, and employer linkages, while mobilizing resources \nfrom corporate social responsibility to ensure sustainability.  \n \n(iii)  Convergence with national policies and priorities. The project is aligned with \nthe National Policy for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship 2015, which the \nMinistry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship approved in July 2015. This \nalignment ensures that training courses comply with the requirements of the \nNational Skills Qualification Framework. It also ensures that a robust quality \nassurance system is in place by (a) applying emerging standards set by sector \nskills councils and the National Skill Development Agency, (b) enhancing capacity \nto  train  trainers  and  assessors,  (c)  benchmarking  ASTIs  and  ITIs,  and  (d) \ninstitutionalizing a credible assessment and certification system.  \n  \n10.  The  project  reflects  the  priorities  of  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in  its  country \npartnership strategy, 2013\u20132017 for India, which reinforces India\u2019s efforts to achieve inclusive \ngrowth and recognizes education, especially vocational training, as a new sector in ADB\u2019s India \n                                                \n10  No ASTI currently exists; all eight ASTIs are to be established under the project.  \n11  Lessons Learned (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "4   \noperation.12 The project is aligned with the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, which emphasizes \nADB\u2019s need to expand lending for post-basic education and vocational training to develop human \ncapital, and facilitate public\u2013private partnerships to leverage results.13 Odisha will be the third \nstate to receive ADB support for skills development, after the states of Meghalaya and Kerala.14  \n  \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact will be reduced unemployment and underemployment rates for female and \nmale youth (aged 15\u201334) by 2025. The outcome will be increased skills and employment in the \npriority sectors for the working-age population.     \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  Output 1: Equitable access to market-responsive skills development programs \nincreased. This output will support a network of eight new ASTIs as hubs and 30 government \nITIs as spokes under a hub-and-spoke model that will train about 195,000 people, of which about \n120,000 will be trained by ASTIs; 50,000 by ITIs; and 25,000 through RPL. Two ASTI models will \nbe supported. For six ASTIs, OSDA will provide land, new buildings, and equipment, and will \nengage public or private training providers to operate and maintain the ASTIs. For the other two \nASTIs, OSDA will provide equipment, while public or private training providers will provide land \nand buildings to optimize the use of existing facilities. This output has four sub-outputs: (i) \nincreased access to quality training through a hub-and-spoke model, with the provision of new \nbuildings and laboratory equipment for eight ASTIs,15 and hostels, workshops, and laboratory \nequipment for 30 ITIs;16 (ii) improved access to training for women and disadvantaged social \ngroups; (iii) market-responsive training programs delivered for the state\u2019s priority sectors in \ncollaboration with key industry players; and (iv) RPL systems established. \n \n13.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n20.  The attached capacity development TA is estimated to cost $2.4 million, of which $2.0 \nmillion  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  and \nadministered by ADB. The TA has been designed to strengthen the capacity of OSDA during the \nfirst 2 years of implementation and ensure that start-up activities are implemented effectively. The \nTA will help OSDA build its capacity in identifying specific skills needs, introducing short-term \ntraining responsive to market needs, and establishing market linkages with industries. The \nSDTED is the executing agency. The state government will provide counterpart support in the \nform of counterpart staff, office accommodation and supplies, and other in-kind contributions.19 \nThe TA will be implemented from July 2017 to June 2019.  \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n21.  The design and cost estimates are based on inputs from a wide range of experts and \npractitioners. Priority sectors and trades were selected based on skills-gap analysis, demand \nestimation linked to manufacturing and services sector needs, feedback from ITI principals, and \ndiscussions with industry experts and training sector practitioners. The demand for skills is linked \nto state, national, and overseas labor markets. The design combines leveraging investments from \nthe government, private sector, users, and employers, along with the private sector\u2019s efficiency to \ndeliver training services effectively. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n   \n22.  Economic  viability.  The  project\u2019s  economic  viability  was  assessed  based  on  the \nassociated benefits and costs. Economic benefits include (i) direct benefits for students, including \nincreased employability and higher wages; (ii) direct benefits for employers in terms of improved \nproductivity and returns on investment; and (iii) improved internal efficiency through reduced \nsystem wastage caused by lower completion rates. The three major streams of economic costs \nare (i) direct project costs associated with the four outputs; (ii) private costs of trainee fees, and \nindirect opportunity costs of foregone earnings during training; and (iii) costs borne by various \ntraining schemes. The project is estimated to yield a net present value of $181.4 million under the \nbase scenario, with an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 21.6%. The EIRR was tested \nfor sensitivity to four different scenarios: (i) a 10% capital cost overrun (EIRR 18.2%), (ii) a 10% \nrecurrent cost overrun (EIRR 19.4%), (iii) a 10% lower wage increase (EIRR 17.8%), and (iv) a \ncombination of (i) and (iii) (EIRR 14.6%). In all cases, the EIRR exceeds the required rate of 9%, \nsuggesting that the project is economically robust. \n \n23.  Fiscal  sustainability.  The  incremental  recurrent  costs  after  project  completion  are \nestimated at \u20b9580 million per year at constant prices; these costs include maintaining buildings \nand equipment, retaining and retraining ITI instructors, and retaining core staff. This represents \nonly 4.2% of Odisha\u2019s total estimated budget for technical and vocational education and training \nin  FY2023,  which  the  state  government  is  committed  to  support.  The  project\u2019s  long-term \nsustainability will depend on (i) increasing the quality of skills training to meet satisfactory labor \nmarket outcomes; (ii) ensuring a coordinated approach to skills development to optimize various \ntraining schemes and to support trainees who are less able to afford the training costs; (iii) \nincreasing labor force productivity, leading to higher returns on business investments; and (iv) \n                                                \n19  Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8   \ngradually increasing wages to induce more individual investment in skills training. The project \nproposes to address these critical areas.  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n24.  Detailed assessments of financial management, procurement, and governance policies \nand procedures of the executing and implementing agencies show that the overall project \nfiduciary risk is substantial. As India has robust public financial management systems, and strong \nprocurement, governance, anticorruption arrangements, and monitoring institutions, these risks \nemanate primarily from OSDA, whose policies, systems, and procedures are newly established \n(footnote  12).  The  state-level  procurement  capacity  assessment  showed  that  procurement \npolicies and procedures are in place and in line with the Odisha General Financial Rules, such as \nthe  Guidelines  for  Procurement  of  Goods  (2012)  and  the Works  Department\u2019s  procedural \nrequirements  on  the  procurement  of  works,  including  the  Codal  Provisions  Regarding  e-\nProcurement (2013). At the sector level, the executing agency, the SDTED, has no specific \nprocurement unit. The financial management and procurement capacity assessments identified \nthe following key risks: (i) weak financial management capacity of SDTED and OSDA, (ii) absence \nof an internal audit function at SDTED, (iii) low fund utilization at DTET and the former OSEM, \nand (iv) absence of an IT-based accounting system.  \n \n25.  To overcome these weaknesses, OSDA as the implementing agency will have a highly \nexperienced and qualified PMU team headed by a dynamic CEO. OSDA will engage a PMC team \nto support its operations. The financial management action plan proposes key measures such as \nadequate and qualified staffing, centralized procurement by OSDA with support from an expert \nteam, clear funds-flow directed through SDTED to OSDA, and installation of IT-based accounting \nsystems for recording and reporting. In addition, an internal audit team familiar with government \naccounting methods will be engaged to enhance fiduciary controls over OSDA activities. ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \nGovernment of India, Government of Odisha, and SDTED. Specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 17).  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n26.  Between  2005  and  2013,  Odisha  recorded  the  largest  reduction  in  poverty  (by  25 \npercentage points) among all major states in India. Yet Odisha\u2019s poverty rate at 33% remains the \nsecond highest in the country. Odisha also has India\u2019s third highest proportion of scheduled \ncastes and tribal people, who constitute almost half of the state\u2019s poor. Significant gender \ndifferences exist in labor force participation among those aged 15\u201334 (80% for men and 29% for \nwomen); and in the literacy rate (82% for men and 64% for women) (footnote 5). The literacy rate \nis also much lower for women from scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. The project is \ncategorized as having a gender equity theme, since it aims to train about 200,000 youth, of whom \n25% will be women, 30% from disadvantaged groups, and 3% people with disabilities. To mobilize \nand ensure the active participation of the target groups, especially women, in training, the project \nwill implement a rigorous social marketing and communication strategy. The project will also \nsupport career counseling and job placement services in all ASTIs and spoke ITIs to consider the \nspecial needs of women and other targeted groups. Fee concessions, subsidies, and hostel \nfacilities will also be provided to motivate the target groups to participate in the training programs \nand to promote their employment.  \n \n \n \n ", "9 \nE.  Safeguards \n \n27.  The loan is categorized C for involuntary resettlement, as there will be no land acquisition \nor resettlement impacts. Six ASTIs and hostels in 30 ITIs will be constructed on land within the \npremises of existing educational institutions, or other encumbrance-free land owned by the \ngovernment. Project components or subprojects that would trigger the involuntary resettlement \nsafeguards of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) are not eligible for funding under the \nproject. The loan is categorized B for indigenous peoples, as Odisha\u2019s population is composed of \n23% scheduled tribes and 16% scheduled castes. An indigenous peoples plan has been prepared \nto ensure access to the project\u2019s training programs for all indigenous peoples in the state. The \nloan is categorized B for environment, considering the scope of the civil works for six ASTIs and \nthe environmental investigations of the ASTI project sites. An environment assessment and \nreview framework has been prepared for the still-unidentified sites of the remaining two ASTIs. \nThe initial environmental examination reports, including environmental management plans and \nenvironmental assessment and review framework, have been prepared and disclosed on the ADB \nwebsite. The implementation status of environmental management plans will be reported to ADB \nsemiannually.   \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n28.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.20 The assessment indicates that the overall risk \nis  moderate  to  substantial.  However,  the  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to \noutweigh the costs.  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Key Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks    Mitigating Measures \nWeak financial  OSDA will have financial management and procurement specialists to support \nmanagement and  day-to-day financial management and procurement activities for the project. \nprocurement capacity  An internal audit function will also be established.
