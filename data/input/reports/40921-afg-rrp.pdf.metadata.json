Sungas  LLC  and  Sungas  Ltd.  are  collectively  one \nentity (Sungas). \n\nTargeting classification: General intervention \n\nSector  (subsectors):  Energy  (conventional  energy,  energy  sector \n\ndevelopment) \n\nTheme \n\n(subthemes):  Environmental  sustainability \n\n(urban \nenvironmental \n(promoting \neconomic  efficiency  and  enabling  business  environment, \nwidening access to markets and economic opportunities), private \nsector development (private sector investment) \n\nimprovement),  economic  growth \n\nLocation impact:  Rural (low), urban (high), national (high), regional \n\nThe project will develop a nationwide LPG storage and distribution \nnetwork  in  Afghanistan.  LPG  is  the  only  practical  and  feasible \nsubstitute  for  firewood  and  animal  dung  as  a  primary  fuel  source.  \nIncreased  LPG  consumption  improves  the  environment,  improves \nliving  conditions,  and  accelerates  economic  growth  through  more \nefficient  use  of,  and  enhanced  access  to,  energy  for  households \nand small businesses. \n \nThe  project  imports  LPG  directly  from  refineries  in  Turkmenistan \nand  Uzbekistan,  and  delivers  LPG  to  consumer  households \nthrough  an  efficient  supply  chain  with  no  intermediaries.  The \nproject provides the following deliverables to consumer household \nbeneficiaries: \n \nEnvironmental. Compared with solid fuels currently used in many \nhouseholds,  LPG  reduces  ambient  air  pollution  in  cities  and \nreduces harmful fumes within households. \n \nSafety. The project will contribute to reducing death and accidents \ncaused by illegal products and inexperienced distributors. \n \nEnergy. LPG has a higher calorific value, is more efficient to burn \nthan solid fuels, and provides long-run cost savings to consumers.  \nIt is more diverse as it can be used in applications other than just \nopen combustion. \n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n  \nImpact,  Outcome,  and \nBenefits \n\n \nBorrower/Project \nSponsors \n\n \nInvestment Cost and \nFinancing Plan \n\n  \n \n\n \n\nEconomic. Households using LPG are more productive, especially \nwomen and children, enabling more time for studying and working; \nfamily  productivity  increases.  Small  businesses  benefit  from  a \nreliable  and  uninterrupted  fuel  supply  without  the  burden  of  using \ntheir own employees or family members to collect firewood. \n\nImpacts.  Improved  access  to  modern  energy  sources  facilitating \neconomic growth and well-being, decreased use of traditional solid \nfuels for energy, private sector investment in Afghanistan's energy \ninfrastructure. \n \nOutcome. Increased retail supply of affordable, high quality LPG in \na safe and reliable manner with an additional 230,000 households \nswitching from traditional solid fuels to LPG by 2019. \n \nBenefits.  Higher  and  more  dispersed  availability  of  LPG,  lower \nexposure to local pollutants such as suspended particulate matter, \na safer and more reliable energy supply system as opposed to the \nexisting gray market system (which is unsafe and unreliable), and \nalleviation of energy poverty in the country. \n \nThe  project's  direct  benefits  include  the  provision  of  clean, \naffordable,  reliable  energy  to  households  and  small  businesses, \nand the creation of 340 jobs by 2014.   \n \nThe  project  significantly  benefits  women  and  children,  who  are \noften  the  more  vulnerable  to  the  adverse  health  impacts  of  solid \nfuel  smoke  and  suspended  particulate  matter  emissions.  Women \nand  children  further  benefit  by  no  longer  having  to  spend  time \ncollecting firewood, and instead have time to pursue education and \nother  activities  that  contribute  to  household  productivity  and \nincome. Small businesses also receive direct benefits by reducing \nharmful  smoke  and  particulates  in  the  workplace,  increasing \nworker safety and productivity. \n \nThe  sponsors  are \nthree  well-regarded  non-resident  Afghan \nbusinessmen,  each  with  a  long  history  of  establishing  and \nin  petroleum  products  and \noperating  successful  businesses \nconsumer  goods  packaging  and  distribution.  Each  has \ndemonstrated the ability to operate successfully in the challenging \nbusiness environment of Afghanistan. \n \nThe company is planning to invest a total of $58.2 million through \n2019  to  build  LPG  refilling  centers  in  five  Afghan  cities  and  to \nacquire additional LPG fuel cylinders for distribution to consumers. \nADB  is  seeking  Board  approval  to  subscribe  up  to  $8  million  in \ncompany  preference  shares.  In  addition  to  paid-in  capital,  the \ncompany  will  plough  back  cash  flow  from  operations  and  raise \nshort-term  debt  from  local  relationship  banks  to  fund  its  capital \nexpenditure program. \n\n\fProposed ADB \nAssistance \n\n  \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating \nMeasures \n\n  \nJustification / ADB \nValue-Added \n\n \n\n \n\niii\n\nto  stimulate \n\nAn equity investment of up to $8,000,000 from the ordinary capital \nresources  of  ADB \ninvestment  and \ndevelopment  objectives  of  the  company,  with  the  intention  of \nexiting  the  investment  by  2019  through  either  a  share  sale,  put \noption,  or  call  option,  under  such  terms  and  conditions  as  have \nbeen approved by ADB's Investment Committee. \n\nthe  capital \n\nSungas  Ltd.  began  implementing  its  business  plan  as  originally \nenvisioned and has completed the construction and commissioning \nof  two  bulk  storage  facilities  and  one  refilling  center,  with  another \nrefilling center to be fully commissioned by 2010. ADB's investment \nand  the  company's  other  financing  sources  will  fund  three \nadditional  refilling  centers  and  the  purchase  of  LPG  cylinders.  \nConstruction  is  being  performed  by  Sungas  Ltd.  using  local \ncontractors and imported LPG equipment, vessels, and piping.   \n \nAny  investment  in  Afghanistan  is  at  risk  of  being  negatively \naffected  by  the  challenging  political  and  security  environment.  \nHowever, the risks are mitigated by the sponsors' experience in the \ncountry  and  the  project's  ability  to  scale  up  or  down  with  the \nmarket.  The development impact outweighs the risks. \n \nRealization  of  benefits  from  the  project  relies  on  a  sustained  or \nimproved security situation, relative macroeconomic stability, and a \ncontinued pro-business policy environment. Specific project-related \nrisks include: \n\nregulatory and political risk, \nforeign exchange and price risk, \n\n(i)  market risk, \n(ii)  product quality and safety, \n(iii)  sponsor, management and reputational risk, \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi)  security risk, \n(vii) \n(viii)  ADB influence over strategy and direction, and  \n(ix)  exit risk \n\ninsurance availability,  \n\nThe  investment  stimulates  the  expansion  of  a  company  that \ndemonstrates  adherence  to  business  ethics  and  international \nsafety  standards.  The  rationale  for  the  timing  and  the  amount  of \ninvestment  is  to  enable  the  company  to  achieve  its  franchising \nstrategy  by  installing  LPG  distribution  capacity  in  locations  where \ndistributor  demand  is  highest,  thus  increasing  the  supply  of  safe \nand  reliable  LPG  to  household  users.  ADB's  support  of  this \nexpansion  will  encourage  commercial \ninternational \ninvestors,  and  aid  agencies  to  support  broader  private  sector \ndevelopment  in  a  wider  range  of  industries  in  Afghanistan.  ADB's \nassistance provides capital to the company at a critical time in the \nbusiness  plan  rollout,  thereby  supporting  the  generation  of  brand \nfacilities,  and \nawareness,  construction  of \nexpansion of retail sales channels.   \n\ninfrastructure  and \n\nlenders, \n\n \n\n\f\f  \n\n \n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \n1. \nequity investment in Sungas Limited Liability Corporation (Sungas LLC) of up to $8,000,000 or \n25%  of  the  company's  total  paid-in  share  capital,  whichever  is  less.  Sungas  LLC,  is  the \nDelaware, United States, registered holding company of Sungas Limited (Sungas Ltd.), which is \na distributor of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n\nA. \n\nProject Identification and Selection \n\nin \n\n2. \nThe sponsors first approached Asian Development Bank (ADB) in July 2005 to invite its \nparticipation \nthe  expansion  of  Sungas's  nationwide  LPG  storage  and  distribution \ninfrastructure. After a series of meetings in November 2005 and a site visit by the project team \nto Afghanistan in December 2005, Sungas submitted its business plan to ADB in late 2005, with \na  request  for  financing.  The  project  received  concept  clearance  on  20  March  2006,  and  due \ndiligence  missions  were  conducted  in  April  and  September  2006.  Complex  financial  and \ncorporate  structuring  has  continued  since  2007,  with  Sungas  now  in  a  position  for  ADB  to \nsubscribe  to  shares.  Given  the  nature  and  location  of  the  project,  it  was  subjected  to  very \nrigorous due diligence and structuring. The rationale for ADB's participation in the project is to \nsupport Afghanistan's growth by catalyzing private sector development and facilitating access to \nmodern  energy  sources.  LPG  is  clean  and  safe.  It  has  the  least  demanding  infrastructure \nrequirements  of  the  energy  alternatives  and  has  the  potential  to  dramatically  improve  living \nconditions for the poor. \n \n3. \nModern  energy  is  a  prerequisite  for  development.  According  to  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP),1 access to greater quality and quantity of energy is essential \nfor the poor to make the transition from subsistence livelihoods to improved productivity, income \ngeneration,  and  living  standards.  Services  enabled  by  modern  energy  (such  as  heat,  light, \nmotive  power,  and  refrigeration)  are  pivotal  contributors  to  human  welfare  and  economic \ndevelopment.  Studies  link  access  to  modern  energy  to  improved  human  welfare  as  measured \nby  the  human  development  index  (HDI). 2   Afghanistan  ranks  173rrd  out  of  178  surveyed \ncountries in the HDI.3 Kabul energy consumption data4 indicate that over 60% of Afghanistan's \nenergy  consumption  is  provided  by  firewood.  For  the  poorest  people  and  countries,  small \nincremental increases in access to modern energy lead to dramatic gains in the HDI. \n \n4. \nimproves \nproductivity,  education,  health,  and  gender  equality.  Access  to  modern  energy  frees  the  poor, \nespecially  women  and  girls,  from  the  drudgery  of  collecting  firewood,  thus  expanding \nopportunities  for  schooling  and  after-school  study.  Use  of  clean  modern  energy  also  reduces \n\nto  clean,  affordable  modern  energy \n\nthe  poor  with  access \n\nProviding \n\n                                                \n \n1   Source:  UNDP website. \n2   The  HDI  is  an  indicator  that  measures  a  country's  relative  development  and  represents  measures  of  life \nexpectancy, literacy, educational attainment, standard of living, and GDP per capita for countries worldwide. UNDP \nuses the HDI as an indicator of opportunities, inter alia, for education, health care, income, and employment. \n\n3   UNDP.    2004.

Consultants'  report  for  technical  assistance  project  AFG/0361/tf  030397  funded  by  the \nUnited  States  Trade  and  Development  Agency  and  managed  by  the  International  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment. \n\n \n\n\f 2 \n\ndamage to health from high exposure to pollutants from burning solid fuels (such as wood and \nanimal  dung)  for  cooking  and  heating.  Shifting  to  cleaner-burning  LPG  reduces  carbon \nemissions significantly compared with the burning of biomass. \n \nWhile natural gas supplied by pipeline is typically more economical in the long run than \n5. \nLPG  transported  by  tanker  trucks,  the  absence  of  a  nationwide  pipeline  network  and  the \nprohibitive  construction  costs  for  pipelines  over  long  distances  in  the  near  term  imply  that \nachieving  a  wide  distribution  of  LPG  will  rely  on  road-based  transportation.  According  to  the \nWorld Bank, a natural gas pipeline to Kabul from the north and the use of unconfirmed domestic \nnatural  gas  in  the  south  are  not  yet  viable  or  cost-effective. 5     Considering  these  factors, \nSungas\u2019s  capital  investments  can  be  easily  scaled  according  to  market  conditions,  i.e.,  trucks \nand cylinders can be added or scaled back more readily and at a lower cost than permanently \ninstalled piping from terminals to distribution centers. \n \n6. \nLPG  offers  an  attainable-cost  solution  to  consumers  using  firewood  and  other  cheaper \nalternatives, who are typically not in a position to pay for switching to piped natural gas because \nof high initial conversion costs. Even in higher-income, gas-rich countries, for example in Latin \nAmerica,  the  urban  poor  continue  to  use  LPG,  although  it  has  a  higher  price  per  energy  unit \nthan natural gas, because they cannot afford the connection to the natural gas pipeline system. \n \nB. \n\nSector Background \n\n1. \n\nLiquefied Petroleum Gas Market Demand \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n7. \nThe  three  major  fuels  in  the  energy  basket  of  Afghanistan's  households  are  firewood \n(35%), animal dung (19%), and vegetation brush (18%). The share of LPG in the total energy \ndemand by Afghanistan's households stands at 9%. The bulk of LPG use in Afghanistan is for \ndomestic  cooking,  and  secondarily  for  lighting  and  winter  heating,  with  many  households  that \nuse LPG for cooking continuing to use firewood for heating. Use of LPG is greater among urban \nhouseholds, whose share in energy consumption is 33%, compared to 2% for rural households. \n \nAn independent market consultant,6 commissioned to validate Sungas\u2019s market strategy, \n8. \nrevealed that in only 6 of 34 provinces (Balkh, Herat, Jawzjan, Kabul, Mazar-e-Sharif, Nimroz, \nand Panjsher) do a significant number of households use LPG for any or all of the three uses, \nnamely cooking, heating, and lighting. Low LPG usage rates are found in five other provinces \n(Baghlan,  Kandhar,  Kapisa,  Kunduz,  and  Takhar).  In  rural  provinces  like  Bamyan,  Daikindi, \nFarah,  Ghor,  Kunarha,  Laghman,  Nuristan,  Paktika,  Sar-i-poul,  and  Zabul,  almost  no \nhouseholds use LPG for all or any of the three uses. Kabul alone accounts for more than half of \nthe  country\u2019s  total  consumption  of  LPG,  while  the  combined  consumption  of  Kabul,  Mazar-e-\nSharif, and Herat accounts for a majority. \n \n9. \nResidential LPG use in Kabul, as a proportion of total fuel use, is presently estimated at \nonly  18%  (Table  1),  suggesting  significant  potential  demand  for  LPG  in  the  residential  urban \nmarket.  Kabul's  non-LPG  urban  consumers  exhibit  similar  consumption  patterns  to  rural \nhouseholds,  resorting  to  heavy  biomass  consumption  because  of  the  lack  of  access  to  other \nfuels, economic factors, and tradition.

Income \nelasticity,  estimated  by  an  independent  market  consultant,  implies  that  demand  for  LPG  could \nrise faster than increases in gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, which is consistent with \nincome elasticity of demand in other developing countries such as India, Pakistan, and People's \nRepublic of China (footnote 6). GDP growth has averaged 7.5% per year.7 \n \n11. \nDemand varies  by city and state, taking into account population growth, household size, \nGDP per capita growth, position on the energy ladder8, and LPG availability. A detailed scenario \nanalysis suggests that rapid growth is likely with total LPG demand increasing many times over \nthe  next  10  years.  This  trend  is  consistent  with  other  countries  that  have  transitioned  from \ngathered biomass fuels to LPG, such as Turkey, India, and Pakistan.   \n \n\n3. \n\nSupply and Competition \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n\n                                                 \n7   ADB. 2009. Asian Development Outlook 2009: Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Manila. \n8   The energy ladder is a concept that describes what sources of energy are chosen by individuals according to their \nper capita income (buying power). As individuals and households improve their income and increase their buying \npower, they tend to choose cleaner and safer fuels. \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\nAs  there  is  no  domestic  production  of  LPG  in  Afghanistan,  demand  is  met  through \n12. \nimports. The supply chain is composed of a number of importers, wholesalers, and unorganized \nretailers. Besides the government, which imports for its own use and limited retail operations, a \nsmall number of importers buy bulk LPG 9 from refineries in either Turkmenistan or Uzbekistan, \nimport the LPG in railcars or tanker trucks, and offload it to LPG tanker trucks for transportation \nto  independent  distributors  at  wholesale  prices.  The  distributors  repackage  the  LPG  into \ncylinders,  which  are  sold  to  end-users  by  individual  retailers  in  the  main  cities  and  trading \ncenters. \n \n13. \nThe  threat  of  new  market  entrants  in  direct  competition  with  Sungas  does  exist; \nhowever,  there  are  a  number  of  barriers  that  prevent  supply-side  overcrowding.  The  most \nsignificant barrier is the difficulty in establishing supply chain and procurement relationships with \nthe most economical sources of LPG available to Afghanistan, and these relationships take time \nto  establish.  Other  significant  barriers  to  entry  include  the  cost  of  bulk  storage  facilities  and \nassociated  LPG  unloading  equipment,  and  obtaining  Afghanistan  regulatory  approvals  for \nimport licensing and facility construction. \n \nThere  is  a  substantial  quantity  of  illegal 10   or  under-invoiced  supplies  of  LPG  in \n14. \nAfghanistan, whose pricing could disrupt the company's market penetration. These gray market \nsuppliers,  however,  do  not  offer  a  consistent  product  or  safe  storage  and  refilling  of  LPG.  \nBased  on  data  when  the  independent  market  study  was  conducted  in  2007,  total  imports  in \n2005 amounted to just 16,190 tons, whereas the total estimated LPG usage in Afghanistan for \nthat year was approximately 150,000 tons. The independent market consultant suggested that \nthis  difference  is  explained  by  inadequate  statistical  reporting  systems,  under-invoicing  of \nimports, and illegal imports.   \n \n15. \nConsumer demand exceeds Sungas's current supply capacity as many LPG consumers \nperceive  their  existing  suppliers  as  being  unreliable  and  providing  an  inconsistent  and  unsafe \nproduct.  During  2008,  there  were  a  total  of  5,610  deaths  in  Afghanistan  from  accidents \noccurring  from  either  misuse  or  the  use  of  unsafe  LPG  cylinders.  Customers  regard  Sungas' \ncylinder inspection and maintenance process as a key product differentiator.  \n \n\n4. \n\nMarket Regulation, Pricing, and Affordability \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \nThe  LPG  market  in  Afghanistan  is  currently  not  subject  to  quality  standards  or  control \n16. \nregulations  other  than  import  classification,  which  is  not  always  tightly  controlled.  As  a  result, \nproduct quality is variable, and at times very poor. Import and distribution of LPG are not subject \nto licensing other than regular business license requirements. \n \n17. \nLPG  prices  are  market-based.  Consistent  with  international  best  practice,  Afghanistan \ndoes not subsidize LPG. LPG sales prices are subject to competition and adjusted in line with \nchanges  in  the  LPG  purchase  price  and  transportation  costs,  both  of  which  are  linked  to \ninternational petroleum prices. The retail price of LPG in Afghanistan is typically about double its \ninternational  price  because  of  higher  supply  costs  and  margins  charged  by  importers, \n\n                                                 \n9   A  comparison  of  recorded  quantities  of  LPG  imports  versus  the  quantity  consumed  in  Afghanistan  suggests  that \n\nthere are significant non-report imports. \n\n10  Illegal imports are quantities that are traded  (bought and sold) commercially but imported by entities that are not \n\nlicensed by the Government of Afghanistan for importation of petroleum products. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nwholesalers, and retailers. Seasonal and regional variations also play a role as supply adjusts \naccording to demand. \n \n18. \nThe  demand  for  LPG  in  Afghanistan  is  highly  price-sensitive.  The  LPG  market  in \nAfghanistan  is  characterized  by  a  long  supply  chain  with  numerous  middleman  sales,  which \ndrives  up  prices  and  applies  downward  pressure  on  consumer  demand.  However,  an \nindependent  market  expert  determined  that  LPG  pricing  in  the  country  is  market-based,  and \nsuppliers  offset  downward  trends  in  demand  by  reducing  their  margins.  Sungas,  the  only \nvertically integrated supplier, has a better cost position and more flexibility by which to reduce its \nmargins, meet consumer affordability constraints, and remain profitable. \n \n\n5. \n\nIndustry Competitiveness and Profitability \n\n19. \nNeither  the  government  nor  any  private  sector  operator  operates  a  nationwide  LPG \nnetwork able to exploit economies of scale. No organization operating in the LPG market in any \npart of the supply chain has a dominant share of the market. Barriers to entry, though they exist, \nare not strong enough to give any single firm absolute dominance. \n \n20. \nThe  low  level  of  concentration  in  the  supply  chain,  comparatively  easy  licensing \nprocedures,  low  customs  duty,  and  the  absence  of  any  price  regulation,  make  Afghanistan's \nLPG  market  fully  competitive,  although  this  may  be  more  a  result  of  market  infancy  than \nimplemented  policy.  A  vertically  integrated  LPG  business  has  strong  potential  for  profitability \nsince  it  delivers  LPG  to  the  end-consumer  at  a  lower  cost  compared  with  the  current  supply \nchain,  where  profit  is  extracted  numerous  times  as  LPG  is  bought  and  sold  between \nintermediaries. Given the absence of strong incumbents, Sungas, which is vertically integrated \nfrom import to consumer sales with an emphasis on brand safety and reliability, should have a \nstrong first-mover advantage. \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n21. \nThe project is aligned with ADB's strategies and operational objectives, providing safer \nand  improved  access  to  a  modern  fuel  supply  with  direct  benefits  to  economic  and  social \ndevelopment.  \n \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 \n\nStrategy  2020  identifies  the  energy  sector  as  a  core  operational  sector. 11    Catalyzing \n22. \ninvestments  through  increased  private  sector  participation  in  ADB's  developing  member \ncountries  is  one  of  the  five  strategic  priorities.  The  project  contributes  to  inclusive  economic \ngrowth  by  connecting  more  Afghans  to  energy  infrastructure,  which  increases  their  household \nproductivity  and  alleviates  much  of  the  deprivation  that  currently  exists  among  women  and \nchildren,  who  spend  valuable  time  collecting  firewood  and  biomass  for  cooking  and  heating.  \nThe  project  addresses  an  infrastructure  deficit,  which  Strategy  2020  broadly  recognizes  as  a \nconstraint to market-led growth and a proliferator of environmental damage. The project delivers \nnot only improved infrastructure in the form of built assets, but also an improvement in energy \ndelivery services, which creates an enabling environment for the private sector in terms of both \nfuel supply and opportunities to participate as distributors.   \n   \n\n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2008.

Since  lack  of  access  to  both  power  and  energy  resources  is  a  key  constraint  to  a \ncountry's development, ADB will work with the Ministry of Energy and Water to improve service \ndelivery, promote efficiency, and build capacity across the sector. The project complements the \nefforts  of  ADB\u2019s  Central  and  West  Asia  Department  to  promote  increased  access  to  energy \nservices by providing downstream distribution assets linking more Afghan households to LPG. \n \n\n3. \n\nConsistency with the Energy Policy 2009 \n\n24. \nThe  Energy  Policy  emphasizes  promotion  of  energy  sector  reforms,  governance,  and \ncapacity  building  as  one  of  the  advancements  necessary  for  maximizing  access  to  energy  for \nall. The project contributes to this objective by assisting a well-organized company that complies \nwith  Afghanistan's  regulatory  procedures\u2014both  those  already  established  and  ones  being \ndeveloped\u2014and connects efficient delivery of energy products and services with best practice \nenergy sector policies, reducing illegal imports and unsafe grey-market distribution. \n \n25. \nExtensive  use  of  traditional  biomass  results  in  a  higher  incidence  of  health  problems, \nand  the  Energy  Policy  cites  World  Health  Organization  data  that  almost  1.6  million  people, \nmostly  women  and  children,  die  every  year  around  the  world  from  exposure  to  this  pollution.  \nThe typical transition for poor rural people is to switch from traditional biomass to coal, charcoal, \nand kerosene, which are improved sources over traditional biomass, yet their health, safety, and \nenvironmental  (HSE)  effects  are  not  sustainable.  The  project  directly  delivers  the  Energy \nPolicy's  preferred  option  of  LPG  as  a  fuel  source  and  also  implements  an  efficient  delivery \nsystem that will lower the cost of switching from traditional fuel sources to LPG. \n \nADB is a major source of external assistance to the energy sector in Afghanistan, having \n26. \nprovided  over  $350  million  of  lending  assistance,  $23  million  in  grants,  and  $8  million  in \ntechnical assistance to the energy sector. The focus of sovereign lending assistance has been \non  hydropower  development,  infrastructure  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction,  and  transmission \nand distribution. ADB's nonlending assistance has focused on sector reviews, feasibility studies, \ninstitutional  development, \nframework \ndevelopment for the natural gas sector.   \n \n\nrenewable  energy  development,  and \n\nregulatory \n\n4. \n\nConsistency with ADB's Private Sector Operations in Afghanistan \n\n27. \nNotwithstanding  the  challenging  investment  climate,  ADB's  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment  (PSOD)  has  been  active  in  Afghanistan  since  2003.  PSOD  has  provided  three \ntranches of direct financing, a B loan, and a political risk guarantee to help Afghanistan's current \ntelecommunications  leader,  Roshan,  deliver  affordable  communications  services  to  the \npopulation. PSOD has also helped establish one of Afghanistan's first new banks\u2014Afghanistan \nInternational Bank.  Being a benchmark transaction and aligned with private sector development \npriorities  as  set  forth  in  the  country  partnership  strategy,  the  project  is  expected  to  enhance \naccess  to  efficient  energy  sources  for  households  and  promote  productivity  for  small  and \nmedium-size  businesses,  thereby  fostering  economic  growth,  reducing  poverty,  and  creating \nemployment opportunities throughout the country. The project generally complements PSOD's \nongoing  investments,  wherein  the  focus  has  been  on  creation  of  an  enabling  environment, \ninstitutional strengthening, investment promotion, and infrastructure development. \n                                                \n \n12  ADB. 2008.

With ADB's subscription, the Sponsors will collective own 75% of \nthe Company. \n\n29. \nAbdul  Rahman  Alokozay,  chairman  and  president  of  Sungas  Ltd.,  is  the  owner  of  the \nAlokozay Group Corporation, engaged in the import and distribution of tobacco, tea, and similar \nfast-moving  consumer  goods  in  the  United  Arab  Emirates,  former  Soviet  Union,  and \nAfghanistan.  The  Alokozay  Group  owns  and  operates  substantial  storage,  packaging,  and \ndistribution facilities in the United Arab Emirates and other countries. Its Afghanistan operations \ninclude the import and distribution of tea and tobacco.   \n\n30.  Mahmut \u00c7an Kadiri, managing director and chief executive officer of Sungas Ltd., leads \nthe  family-owned  Barakat  Company  Ltd.,  a  major  importer  of  building  materials,  petroleum \nproducts,  and  food  products.  It  has  a  30-year  operating  history  in  Afghanistan  and  has \noperations  in  Kazakhstan  (wheat  flour  milling),  Uzbekistan  (medical  cotton  processing),  and \nTurkey  (greenhouse  operations).  It  is  the  distributor  of  MTZ  tractors  and  has  a  history  of \ndistributorships with Unilever, Colgate-Palmolive, Tesco, Mobil, Pirelli, JVC, Toshiba, and other \nwell-known manufacturers of global consumer brands. \n \n31. \nAbdul Wahab Wahab Kefayat, director of Purchasing and Turkmenistan Operations for \nSungas  Ltd.,  owns  Kefayat  General  Trading  Company  LLC,  a  distributor  of  major  brands  of \nhousehold,  food,  and  personal  care  products,  tires  (Hankook),  and  lubricants  (Total).  The \ncompany imports and distributes petroleum products in significant quantities from Turkmenistan \nand  Uzbekistan,  and  has  interests  in  tourism,  real  estate  development,  and  hotel  construction \nand  management.  It  also  operates  a  network  of  currency  exchange  dealerships  throughout \nAfghanistan. \n\nProject Design \n\n2. \n \nThe project will establish a nationwide LPG distribution network with a capacity of up to \n32. \n190,000  tons  per  year  by  2019.  Funds  will  primarily  be  used  for  development  of  distribution \ncenters  in  Herat,  Mazar-e-Sharif,  Kandahar,  and  Pul-e-Qumri;  expansion  of  the  saleable \ninventory  of  LPG  cylinders;  and  for  general  capital  expenditures  to  support  the  LPG  storage \nterminals in Hairaton and Turghundy, expansion of the transportation fleet, and enhancement of \ndistribution center equipment. \n\na. \n\nDistribution Strategy \n\n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n33. \n\nA fleet of tanker trucks transports LPG from 2 bulk storage terminals, near the borders of \n\n7\n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\nUzbekistan and Turkmenistan, to LPG cylinder refilling stations in five major Afghan city centers. \nRetail distribution is accomplished through a Sungas-franchised sales force, which works under \nreselling  agreements  with  Sungas.  The  initial  distribution  phase  will  service  Kabul  and  Herat, \nAfghanistan's two major cities, followed by the other major demand centers at Mazar-e-Sharif, \nKandahar,  and  Pul-e-Qumri,  in  step  with  Sungas's  market  penetration  and  sales  growth. \nSelection of resellers is critical in achieving the business strategy, as they need to be positioned \nsuch  that  cylinders  can  be  easily  picked  up  or  delivered  to  consumers.  Sungas  provides \nuniforms, and customer interaction and product training to the resellers, so that the buying and \nservice experience is consistent from consumer to consumer and for each consumer over time. \n\n34. \nConsumers initially pay a deposit for the use of Sungas LPG cylinders. When they have \nused  the  LPG,  they  return  the  empty  cylinder  to  the  reseller  by  either  dropping  it  off  or \nscheduling a pickup.  In both cases, the consumer receives, in exchange for the empty cylinder, \na  full  cylinder  of  the  same  size,  paying  only  for  the  incremental  LPG.  The  resellers  return  the \nempty cylinders to the refilling center, which recycles the cylinder by  washing, inspecting, and \nrefilling.   \n\nb. \n\nSupply Flexibility and Bulk Storage \n\n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n35. \nThe  LPG  is  purchased  in  bulk  quantities  from  petroleum  refineries  in  Uzbekistan  and \nTurkmenistan.  A  rail  line  crossing  the  border  into  Hairaton  from  Uzbekistan  makes  bulk  LPG \ntransportation  from  Uzbekistan  particularly  efficient.  Transportation  into  Turghundy  from \nTurkmenistan  is  either  by  rail  or  by  tanker  truck  over  the  national  highway.  By  utilizing  two \nindependently  supplied  terminals,  with  the  ability  to  purchase  LPG  from  two  independent \nrefineries and route supplies to any of their five refilling centers from either terminal, Sungas has \nsupply  flexibility,  particularly  when  compared  to  other  private  importers  in  the  country.  Such \nefficiency gains will be passed on to consumers through lower prices as Sungas competes for \nmarket share. Construction at both bulk storage sites was completed in 2008. \n\nc. \n\nFacility Construction \n\n \n36. \nBulk  storage  terminals  and  refilling  centers  employ  LPG  equipment  and  systems  that \ncomply  with  international  quality  and  safety  standards,  including  those  set  by  the  American \nSociety of Mechanical Engineers and the American Petroleum Institute. \n\n37. \nLPG  bulk  storage  tanks  were  fabricated  by  Isisan  in  Turkey  and  erected  on  site  by \nSungas-managed contractors. The tanks were manufactured and tested according to European \npressure vessel standards. LPG control and operating equipment at the bulk storage terminals \nwere  procured  from  FAS  GMBH  Flussigas  division  of  Germany.  LPG  refilling  equipment  and \ncarousels  are  supplied  by  Kaya  Inc.  of  Turkey,  which  has  supplied  many  LPG  operators  in  \nTurkey  and  the  Middle  East,  including  Ipragaz  and  BP.  LPG  cylinders  are  supplied  by  Mauria \nUdyog  Limited  of  India  and  are  compliant  with  European  standards.  The  cylinders  were \nmanufactured and tested and certified by Bureau Veritas. \n \n \n\nd. \n\nOrganization and Management \n\n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n38. \n\nSungas will directly employ about 340 Afghan personnel within 5 years. They will receive \n\n\f \n\n9\n\ndedicated in-house training, with key supervisory and management staff being trained overseas.  \nOperator training has already been carried out at the Hairaton bulk storage site and the Kabul \n(Karizmir) refilling station. Sungas is organized geographically by location of operation, and by \nfunction, namely marketing, purchasing, administration, and operations. \n\n39. \nThe  administrative  head  office  is  in  Mazar-e-Sharif.  Local  expertise  is  largely \nunavailable,  and  few  international  experts  are  willing  to  relocate  to  Afghanistan,  so  recruiting \nstaff  with  the  required  functional  and  industry  expertise  is  challenging.  The  sponsors  have \nlooked  to  their  individual  business  networks  and  have  identified  qualified  persons  for  key \npositions.  As  an  example,  the  general  director  of  Sungas,  A.  Nasim,  is  a  long-time  employee \nfrom the Barakat Group in Turkey, and the Kabul marketing manager, M. Rustaki, has worked \nfor the Alokozay Group. Most critical management positions have been filled and personnel will \nbe added as the organization expands with the growth of the business. \n\n40. \nTo  minimize  overhead  expenses  in  the  early  phase  of  business  growth,  general  and \nadministrative  staff  are  shared  with  the  sponsors'  other  operations  co-located  at  the  sites  in \nHairaton and Mazar-e-Sharif, under service agreements.  \n\n41. \nThe  purchasing  organization,  with  offices  in  Almaty,  Ashgabat,  Tashkent,  and  Termiz, \nreports  directly  to  one  of  the  sponsors,  Abdul  Wahab  Wahab  Kefayat.  A  fleet  of  tanker  trucks \nthat  transport  LPG  from  Turkmenistan  to  Turghundy  is  based  in  Turkmenistan,  along  with  the \ndrivers, and managed by the Ashgabat office.  \n\n42. \nSungas  LLC  was  established  in  2008  as  a  limited  liability  company  registered  in \nDelaware,  United  States,  with  the  intent  of  being  the  holding  company  for  Sungas  Ltd.   ADB \nproposes to subscribe to shares in Sungas LLC, and at the time of subscription, the sponsors \nwill  subscribe  to  an  in-kind  amount  of  shares  at  the  appraised  value  of  Sungas  Ltd.  and \nadditional shares as required to maintain 75% ownership of the company. Sungas LLC will be \nregistered with the Afghanistan Ministry of Commerce as a foreign company owner of Sungas \nLtd., establishing the parent-subsidiary legal relationship through agreement documents. \n\n43. \nSungas  Ltd.  was  born  out  of  the  household  and  commercial  LPG  business  of  ANP,  a \ncompany owned by the sponsors and engaged in the purchasing, import, distribution and sale of \npetroleum  products  (gasoline,  diesel,  jet  fuel,  and  industrial  LPG).  In  2007,  the  sponsors \nestablished  Sungas  Ltd.  as  an  independent  company  to  market  LPG  to  the  commercial  and \nhousehold market segments. ANP's and Sungas's co-located fixed assets, prior to 2008, were \nall held by ANP, but were transferred to Sungas in January 2008. ANP still operates as a seller \nof  petroleum  products,  and  the  Sungas  business  model  includes  a  leaseback  of  petroleum \nfacilities to ANP and a service fee agreement to cover the costs of common personnel and site \nservices. \n\ne. \n\nBusiness Development Strategy \n\n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n44. \nTwo fully automated refilling stations (one in Kabul and one in Herat) were built initially.  \nTo  achieve  nationwide  coverage  and  commercial  success,  Sungas  plans  to  construct  three \nmore  refilling  stations  in  the  major  city  centers  of  Afghanistan.  This  roll-out  strategy  was \nvalidated  by  the  independent  market  consultants,  who  identified  Kabul  and  Mazar-e-Sharif  as \nthe most important centers, followed by Herat, Kandahar, and Pul-e-Qumri. \n\n45. \n\nSungas's  marketing  strategy  is  to  identify  local  entrepreneurs  who  will  serve  as  the \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\ncompany's  authorized  dealers  in  specific,  restricted  markets.  By  controlling  distribution  assets \nand  outsourcing  sales  and  collections,  Sungas  will  be  able  to  efficiently  retain  control  over \nquality,  inventories,  and  physical  distribution,  while  reducing  overhead  costs.  Building  a \nnationwide  brand  based  on  quality  and  reliability  of  supply  will  enable  Sungas  to  capture  the \nbottling,  wholesale,  and  distribution  segment  of  the  market,  which  is  viewed  as  potentially  the \nmost profitable in the supply chain.  \n\n46. \nBecause of Sungas's reputation as a reliable and transparent LPG supplier, there is high \ndemand  from  existing  distributors  currently  reselling  LPG  from  other  suppliers.  Distributors  of \nother LPG suppliers complain of inaccurate LPG dispensing by other suppliers, sometimes with \nthe  intent  to  overcharge  the  reseller.  These  distributors  are  attracted  to  the  Sungas  franchise \nbecause  of  their  state-of-the-art  filling  and  metering  accompanied  by  100%  leak  testing  of  all \ncylinders  after  filling.  Both  distributors  and  consumers  complain  of  unsafe  and  unreliable \ncylinders and fittings. As reported by company management, Sungas is turning away potential \ndistributors  because  it  does  not  have  the  LPG  handling  capacity  to  supply  them  until  the \nplanned capital expenditure for the remaining refilling centers and LPG cylinders is complete. \n\n47. \nAs with any commodity product in a competitive market, product packaging or branding \nis  of  more  importance  for  differentiation  than  price,  as  pricing  pressures  prevent  competition \nfrom  differentiating  on  price.  Each  of  the  sponsors  has  extensive  experience  in  successfully \nbuilding  brands  for  consumer  goods,  in  areas  as  diverse  as  toothpaste,  tea,  and  motor \nlubricants.  Marketing  measures  include  multimedia  (print,  television,  and  radio)  advertising \ncampaigns coupled with promotions, loyalty programs, and sales incentives for dealers.  \n\n      \n\nProject Outputs and Outcome \n\n3. \n \n48. \nThe project outputs are the commissioning and expansion of Sungas\u2019s nationwide LPG \ndistribution  network.  The  project  will  further  enhance  the  bulk  storage  facilities  for  higher \ninventory  turnover  and  will  create  a  total  of  5  LPG  refilling  stations  at  the  major  population \ncenters  of  Kabul,  Mazar-e-Sharif,  Pul-e-Qumri,  Kandahar,  and  Herat.  Sungas  will  stimulate \nmore private sector activity through contracts with independent resellers and distributors. \n\n49. \nThe  project  will  expand  the  national  supply  of  LPG,  enabling  an  additional  230,000 \nhouseholds to access affordable and safe LPG by 2019 and contributing to a national supply of \n833,000  tons  per  year  by  2014.  The  project  will  showcase  international  design  and  safety \nstandards in the purchasing of specialized equipment and fabrication of facility components. By \n2014, 340 jobs will be created at the storage facilities and refilling stations.  \n\n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact \n\n1. \n\nContribution to Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction \n\nEconomic growth and the provision of basic services are essential for the improved well-\n50. \nbeing and quality of life of the people of Afghanistan. Poverty reduction and economic growth in \nAfghanistan  require  the  development  of  small-scale  and  grass-root  businesses  to  provide \ngainful  employment.  The  provision  of  basic  inputs  for  the  development  of  such  businesses  is \nlacking. Also, as is evident from the HDI, people lack access to basic necessities, particularly in \nremote and rural areas. The project provides a clean, safe, convenient, and reliable source of \nenergy to households and small businesses. Such sources of energy are in short supply in the \ncountry.  Further,  through  improved  distribution  and  operational  efficiency,  and  through \n\n\f \n\n11\n\neconomies of scale, the project will be able to price LPG more competitively, thereby making it \naccessible and  affordable  for  more  customers.  The  project  will  directly  provide  employment  to \nmore  than  300  people,  but  its  indirect  contribution  to  employment  generation  will  be  more \nsignificant.  The  growth  of  small  businesses  through  the  availability  of  a  reliable  and  secure \nsource of energy will provide employment to many people and improve their level of economic \nwell-being. A reduction in the use of traditional fuels like wood and biomass will result in better \nlocal air quality, benefiting the poor in particular as they are more dependent, on such fuels. \n\n2. \n\nPrivate Sector Development \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR), prepared by ADB with confidential financial \n51. \ninputs  from  the  Company,  indicates  that  the  project's  benefit  to  the  Afghanistan  economy  is \ngreater  than  its  benefit  to  the  company.    The  operators  employed  by  Sungas  and  also  the \nconsumers  that  purchase  LPG  from  Sungas  will  benefit  from  the  environmental,  health,  and \nsafety  improvements.  The  company  has  a  formalized  health,  safety,  and  environment  (HSE) \npolicy that was prepared by Bureau Veritas in 2007, as well as an environmental management \nplan (EMP) that was established in 2007 and verified by an ADB audit in October 2009.   \n\nThe profitability of the ADB investment will be judged by the return on investment of cash \n52. \nflows from ADB to the company and cash flows from the company to ADB in the form of annual \ndividends, and ultimately, the sale of its shares \n\nADB additionality is required for the timely introduction of cash to enable the company to \n53. \nimplement its business plan, which entails constructing refilling stations to meet market demand \nand establishing a brand preference among consumers. \n\n3. \n\nEconomic Sustainability \n\n \n54. \nThe economic analysis of the project was carried out according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nthe Economic Analysis of Projects.13 The direct benefits of the project include the provision of \nclean, affordable and reliable energy to households and small businesses. The market price is \nused as a proxy to value these benefits. The project results in environmental and related health \nbenefits,  especially  for  women  and  children,  but  these  were  not  quantified  in  the  analysis \nmaking it a conservative valuation of benefits. Adding new capacity, increasing the supply, and \nproviding the fuel more efficiently make the sector more competitive and the product affordable \nfor more consumers.  Sensitivity testing against three adverse scenarios demonstrates that the \nproject  is  economically  robust  and  viable.  The  project  is  most  sensitive  to  an  increase  in  the \nprice of LPG. \n\nC. \n\nEnvironment and Social Dimensions \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment \n\n \n55. \nSungas  has  given  due  consideration  to  HSE  aspects  in  the  facilities\u2019  site  selection, \ndesign,  equipment  procurement  and  specification,  and  construction.  An  initial  environmental \nexamination  was  prepared  in  September  2007  and  the  EMP  has  been  implemented  at  the \nproject sites. An independent expert will audit the company's EMP compliance prior to financial \nclose,  as  the  security  situation  in  Afghanistan  permits.    Environmental  quality  monitoring \n\n                                                 \n13  ADB.  1997.  Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.  Manila. \n\n \n\n\f 12 \n\nrequirements in terms of ambient air quality, water quality, and noise levels in and around the \nfacilities  during  construction  and  operation  will  be  implemented  to  meet  the  prescribed  World \nHealth  Organization  and  ADB  standards  (i.e.,  World  Bank  Group's  Pollution  Prevention  and \nAbatement Handbook 1998: Toward Cleaner Production). \n\n56. \nThe  use  of  LPG  will  improve  household  health  conditions  by  providing  LPG  to  replace \ntraditional sources of energy for cooking, heating, and lighting purposes. Where wood charcoal \nand animal dung have been the primary sources of heating and cooking fuel, smoke from fires \nhave contributed significantly to infant respiratory infections and infant mortality. Clean burning \nLPG will reduce indoor air pollution and improve ambient air quality. The availability and use of \nLPG will save time needed for gathering fuel wood, and allow for more productive activities such \nas household chores, farming, schooling and after-school study for women and children. \n\n57. \nThe project is classified as category B under ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \nThe  environmental  impacts  have  been  assessed  and  statutory  permits  from  the  government \nhave been obtained to construct and operate the proposed LPG and oil bulk storage facilities. \nDue diligence of the project's HSE activities was undertaken in September 2007 and confirms \nthat  the  project  meets  ADB's  environmental  requirements  as  well  as  national  and  local \nrequirements. A Health, Safety, and Environmental Management Manual14 has been prepared \nto  clearly  define  the  responsibilities  and  procedures  to  be  implemented  throughout  project \npreparation and operation of the facilities. The risk assessment and emergency response plans \nand procedures incorporated in the HSE manual are adequate to handle unforeseen risks and \nemergencies.  As  part  of  its  community  environmental  plan,  Sungas  will  undertake  periodic \nmonitoring  and  consultation  with  local  communities  during  operation  of  the  facilities  to  identify \nany major impacts and implement appropriate actions to mitigate the adverse impacts. \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\n2. \n \nFindings  of  the  social  assessment  show  that  there  are  limited  negative  social  impacts \n58. \nduring construction and operation. Sites for the bulk storage facilities were located in areas at a \nsafe distance from any human settlement or any public facilities. From the perspective of ADB's \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  is  categorized  as  C.  The  Hairaton  and \nTurghundy  bulk  storage  facilities  were  constructed  on  vacant  land  near  the  Uzbekistan  and \nTurkmenistan  borders.  These  facilities,  which  were  constructed  on  land  being  leased  by  the \ngovernment  to  ANP,  have  been  transferred  to  Sungas  Ltd.  at  incorporation.  Three  refilling \nstations,  each  requiring  1.5  hectares  of  land,  are  being  established  on  land  purchased  by \nSungas. Pumping stations will be set up in other parts of the country on vacant land leased or \npurchased  by  Sungas  either  from  the  government  or  private  owners.  The  selection  of  sites  is \nbeing undertaken in such a way that involuntary resettlement is avoided. Moreover, Sungas only \nputs  up  pumping  stations  on  land  where  lease  or  purchase  has  been  freely  negotiated  with \nproperty  owners.  There  are  a  number  of  ethnic  groups  in  Afghanistan,  such  as  the  Aimaks,  \nBaloch, Brahui, Hazaras, Hindkowans, Kuchi Pashtuns, Tajiks, Turkmen, and Uzbek.  None of \nthese  ethnic  groups  has  been  affected  as  bulk  storage  facilities  were  constructed  in  industrial \nzones and refilling and pumping stations on leased or purchased land. The project is expected \nto  improve  the  socioeconomic  living  conditions  of  people  living  in  five  major  centers,  namely, \nHerat,  Kabul,  Kandahar,  and  Mazar-e-Sharif,  by  providing  LPG  to  those  using  traditional \n\n                                                 \n14 The HSE manual is designed and approved by Bureau Veritas and design specification and standards are certified \nby them. The designed standards and specifications adopted by Sungas for equipments (including LPG cylinders) \nand facilities are conformity with the internationally accepted industry best specifications and it has complied with \nEuropean  (EN)  Standards.  The  equipments  are  procured  from  manufacturers  well  known  in  the  international \nmarkets and quality is inspected and checked by independent international quality check agencies. \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nsources  of  fuel  for  cooking,  lighting,  and  heating,  and  good  quality  fuel  for  public  and  private \ntransportation. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is attached (Appendix 2). \n\n \nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nD. \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n59.  Major fixed asset investments are planned to occur over the first 4 years of operations, \nwhich  started  in  2007,  followed  by  capacity  increases  at  the  refilling  stations  and  for  LPG \ncylinder  purchases  as  demand  increases.  As  of  December  2009,  both  bulk  storage  terminals \nand 2 of the 5 planned refilling stations are in operation. \n\nThe total cost to implement the business plan is financed by cash flow from operations \n\n \n60. \nand equity capital from the sponsors and ADB. \n\n \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nConstruction Arrangements \n\n1. \n \n61. \nConstruction  of  the  bulk  storage  facilities,  the  more  complex  of  Sungas's  projects,  is \ncomplete. Further construction arrangements to complete the remaining refilling stations will be \nmanaged  by  Sungas,  which  will  procure  local  subcontractors  for  the  various  trade  crafts.  The \nconstruction of the refilling centers is primarily a commercial class building project. Specialized \nequipment, including the LPG refilling carousels, and LPG storage tanks, will be purchased from \nand  fabricated  by  international  firms.  Local  pipefitter  and  welding  contractors  will  be  managed \nby Sungas and their work will be in compliance with the company's HSE policy, which includes \nguidelines on the installation of LPG-handling equipment. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n2. \n \n62. \nThe company and the sponsors were advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) and policy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing \nof  Terrorism  (2003).  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency,  ADB  will  require  the  investee  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal \nprocedures  and  controls  following  international  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of \npreventing  corruption  or  money  laundering  activities  and  the  financing  of  terrorism  and  to  \ncovenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such  activities.  The  investment  documentation \nbetween ADB and the company and sponsors will further allow ADB to investigate any violation \nor potential violation of these undertakings. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring, Reporting, and Evaluation \n\n3. \n \n63. \nFinancial  reports  are  audited  annually  by  the  local  affiliates  of  a  reputed  international \naccounting  firm.  Financial  record-keeping  and  statements  will  be  prepared  in  compliance  with \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards. \n\n64. \nADB will periodically monitor (i) implementation progress, (ii) development impacts, (iii) \nsocial  impacts,  and  (iv)  environmental  impacts.  Implementation  progress  will  be  monitored  by \nreviewing  project  status  reports  and  periodic  operation  reports  prepared  by  the  company.  \n\n \n\n\f 14 \n\nDevelopment, social, and environmental impacts will be evaluated by ADB during annual review \nmissions. \n \nF. \n\nProjected Operational and Financial Performance \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n65. \nThe  project\u2019s  internal  rate  of  return  is  anticipated  to  be  strong  in  light  of  the  Sponsors' \ncost  of  equity  capital.  The  financial  performance  is  satisfactory  in  conditions  of  general  LPG \nmarket  stress  or  external  stresses  from  currency  depreciation  or  increases  in  the  international \nprice  of  raw  materials.  The  scalability  of  capital  expenditures  (i.e.,  matching  the  fleet  and \ncylinder  capacities  with  market  demand)  will  further  mitigate  the  risk  of  the  project  not  being \nviable. \n \n66. \nThe anticipated average earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization \nmargin,  as  a  percent  of  total  sales,  is  moderately  strong  from  2010  to  2019.  The  average  net \nprofit margin is low over the same period; however, it ramps up after 2011, when the business \nwill be fully utilizing the capacity of installed assets. The company has excellent liquidity to cover \nits short-term purchasing and debt obligations. \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\n1. \n\nInstrument and Amount \n\n \n67. \nADB proposes to subscribe up to a maximum of the lesser of $8,000,000 and 25% of the \npaid-up  share  capital  within  2  years  from  the  approval  date,  provided  that  ADB  prudential \ninvestment limits are met. \n   \n\nTerms and Conditions \n\n2. \n \nThe  sponsors  and  the  company  will  be  required  to  comply  with  all  ADB  environmental \n\n68. \nand social safeguards as well as corporate governance policies.  \n \nADB  intends  to  own  shares  in  Sungas  for  a  period  of  time  sufficient  to  maximize  its \n69. \nadditionality to the company. However, ADB may exit the investment by exercising a put option \nto the company or the sponsors under certain voluntary and commercial conditions. \n \n\nCompliance with Investment Limitations  \n\n3. \n \nThe  proposed  investment  will  be  within  the  medium-term  country,  industry,  group,  and \n\n70. \nsingle project exposure limits for nonsovereign operations. \n\n \nJustification for ADB Assistance \n\nB. \n\n71. \nThe investment stimulates the expansion of a company that demonstrates adherence to \nbusiness  ethics  and  international  safety  standards,  and  provides  much  needed  capital  to \ncontinue the expansion of the commercial franchise through construction of critical LPG refilling \ncenters.  ADB's  support  of  this  expansion  will  foster  confidence  among  commercial  lenders, \ninternational  investors,  and  aid  agencies  to  support  broader  private  sector  development  in  a \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nwider  range  of  industries  in  Afghanistan.  ADB's  assistance  adds  value  to  the  project  in  the \nfollowing ways: \n \n\nCatalyzes  private  investment  in  a  security-challenged  developing  member \ncountry.  ADB  assistance  will  support  Sungas's  first  phase  of  business \nexpansion.  The  success  of  the  company\u2019s  business  will  demonstrate  to  other \nprivate  investors  that  positive  outcomes  are  achievable.  ADB's  successful \nparticipation  in  the  first  phase  may  make  commercial  cofinancing  more  realistic \nfor financing subsequent phases of Sungas's growth plans.  \n\nProvides  direct  assistance  to  the  poor.  The  project  contributes  to  inclusive \neconomic  growth  by  connecting  more  Afghans  to  energy  infrastructure,  which \nincreases their household productivity and alleviates much of the deprivation that \ncurrently exists among women and children, who spend valuable time collecting \nfirewood and biomass for cooking and heating. The project connects more of the \ncountry's low income households to efficient power and energy resources, which \nare  key  enablers  in  reducing  poverty.  Additionally,  the  project  facilitates  the \ntransition for poor rural people switching from traditional biomass directly to LPG \nrather  than  through  the  typical  intermediate  fuels  such  as  coal,  charcoal,  and \nkerosene, which have unsustainable HSE effects.   \n\nPromotes  corporate  governance.  Through  its  role  as  a  shareholder  and  its \nboard  representation,  ADB  can  influence  corporate  governance  practices  and \nhelp  the  company  develop  into  a  role  model  for  other  ventures  in  Afghanistan.  \nThe  example  set  by  the  company,  with  ADB's  help,  can  be  replicated  by  other \ncompanies  in  the  sponsors'  spheres  of  interest  and  by  other  companies  in \nAfghanistan. \n\nEnhances  environment  and  social  responsibility.  ADB's  participation  in  the \nproject has facilitated the adoption of environmental and social safeguards. The \ninitial  environmental  examination,  conducted \nin  2007,  prompted  public \nconsultation,  which  generated  significant  support  from  local  stakeholders  and \nofficials,  and  ensured  the  creation  of  an  HSE  policy  developed  by  Bureau \nVeritas, and implementation of an EMP. \n\n \nRisks and Mitigation Measures \n\nC. \n\n72. \nInvestments in Afghanistan, by nature of the political and commercial environment, are \nexposed  to  a  high  degree  of  political,  commercial,  and  security  risk.  Nevertheless,  unless  a \nmultilateral  financial  institution  like  ADB  takes  the  lead  in  structuring  such  transactions  and \nhelps  to  mitigate  the  risks,  projects  will  stall,  as  other  means  of  financing  are  practically  non-\nexistent at present. Notwithstanding the risk environment, the project has inherent risk mitigation \nthrough  very  experienced  sponsors,  a  wide  distribution  of  scalable  assets,  and  fundamental \nmarket demand. Specific identified risks and their mitigants include: \n \n\n(i) \n\nMarket  risk.    There  is  currently  no  regulatory  regime  for  the  LPG  market  in \nAfghanistan.  There are also significant price volatilities since supply and demand \nlevels are subject to availability and seasonality.  ADB has conducted extensive \ndue  diligence  over  several  years  on  the  sponsors  and  on  the  market,  including \nengaging an independent consultant with experience in the LPG market.  Market \ndata  show  that  there  is  a  ready  and  substantial  market  for  LPG  across  the \n\n15\n\n \n\n\f 16 \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\ncountry,  especially  for  household  consumption,  and  that  as  household  income \nincreases,  consumers  would  tend  to  shift  to  cleaner  fuels.  The  consultant \nvalidated  the  sponsors'  expectations  and  market  opportunities,  and  the  market \nforecast was used as the basis for the company's financial model. ADB will work \nwith  the  company  through  the  board  of  directors  to  ensure  business  decisions \nand their execution are consistent with the strategy.   \n\nProduct  quality  and  safety. ADB commissioned an independent audit on HSE \nissues, which validated that the installed equipment conformed with international \nstandards and the handling of LPG  with quality  control best practices. The final \nHSE  report  outlines  recommended  management  plans  that  have  been  adopted \nby  Sungas  as  corporate  policies  and  procedures.  Sungas  is  thus  employing \nproduct  and  safety  standards  used  in  developed  markets  and  well  in  excess  of \nthose currently seen in Afghanistan. \n\nSponsor,  management,  and  reputational  risk.  The  sponsors  are  individual \ninvestors,  and  ADB  does  not  typically  invest  alongside  individual  sponsors  as \npartners  due  to  issues  related  to  compliance,  know-your-customer  (KYC) \nprinciples,  transparency  in  terms  of  funding  sources,  creditworthiness,  related \nparty  transactions,  conflict  of  interest  and  succession.  However,  there  are  few \nalternatives in making significant development impacts through the private sector \nin Afghanistan, given the lack of commercial interest. With this environment, ADB \nhas  therefore  selected  a  group  of  sponsors  who  are  well-reputed  in  the  local \ncontext.    Sponsor  risk  is  further  mitigated  by  having  safeguard  mechanisms  in \nplace,  and  by  ADB  having  a  unilateral  put  option,  allowing  ADB  to  exit  for  any \nreason  at  any  time.    Given  the  lack  of  exposure  of  the  sponsors  to  the \ncommercial  credit  markets,  a  comprehensive \ninvestigation  was \ncommissioned to address potential reputational risk to ADB. An international risk \nmanagement  consulting  firm,  hired  by  ADB,  conducted  a  multi-country  search \nand  investigation  into  the  business  interests  and  personal  history  of  each \nsponsor, their relatives, and their business associates. The investigation revealed \nno  reputational  risk  for  ADB  and  highlighted  the  prominent  standing  of  these \nbusiness leaders in Afghanistan.     \n\nintegrity \n\nRegulatory and political risk. The regulatory environment in Afghanistan is still \ndeveloping.  However,  given  Sungas's  high  quality  supply  of  LPG  to  meet  the \ncurrent  market  demand,  and  the  prominence  of  the  sponsors,  the  risk  of \nregulatory and political interference is manageable. \n\nForeign  exchange  and  price  risk.  The  company's  cash  flows  will  be \ndenominated  in  afghani,  whereas  dividend  payments  to  the  investors  and \npurchases  of  LPG  imports  will  be  in  foreign  currency.  Working  capital  funding \nand hedging instruments are not available in Afghanistan. Foreign exchange risk \nis partially mitigated by the international benchmarking of the LPG retail price in \ndollars, and through a cost-plus mechanism on retail sales of LPG such that price \nvolatilities can be passed on to consumers.  However, the afghani could devalue \nto the point where the demand elasticity imposes a ceiling on the retail price. At \nthis point, Sungas would be unable to pass on further exchange rate increases; \nhowever,  it  could  sell  excess  LPG  internationally.  This  contingency  is  further \nmitigated by the recent performance of the afghani which, since its introduction in \nFebruary 2003, has substantially held its value and is freely convertible.  \n\n\f \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSecurity  risk.  The  recently  deteriorating  security  situation  can  delay  project \nimplementation  and  pose  threats  to  employees  and  infrastructure.  It  can \nconstrain the company  in distributing its products and severely impact its ability \nto  realize  its  sales  and  profits  forecasts.  However,  the  company  is  supplying  a \nbasic  commodity  and  it  has  a  flexible  program  for  build-up,  roll-out,  and \ndistribution, which can cater to changes in the security situation and market. \n\nInsurance  availability.  Sungas  has  obtained  insurance  coverage  on  its  fixed \nassets from a London-based insurer. Losses are covered under typical weather \ndamage, operational damage, and damage caused by vehicles; however, acts of \nwar  and  terrorism  are  excluded  and  not  available  from  alternate  insurers  in \nAfghanistan.  Losses  to  the  company's  fleet  of  tanker  trucks  are  not  covered \nunder  any  policy  as  the  cost  to  insure  the  fleet  is  not  commensurate  with  the \nbook value of the assets. \n\n(viii)  ADB influence over strategy and direction. ADB will work with the sponsors to \nestablish and enforce acceptable governance procedures to protect the interests \nof ADB as a minority investor and to prepare the company for ADB's timely exit \nafter development impact has been demonstrated. \n\n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank, 15 the \n73. \nGovernment of Afghanistan will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \nassistance to Sungas via ADB's investment in Sungas LLC.  ADB will enter into suitable finance \ndocumentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed \nassistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \n \n \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n74. \nI am satisfied that the proposed investment would comply with the Articles of Agreement \nof  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove the equity investment of up to the lesser of $8,000,000 and 25% of the issued and paid \nup  share  capital  in  Sungas  LLC  for  the  LPG  Distribution  Development  Project  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources,  on  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with \nthose set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board.  \n \n \n\n \nC.

Estimated  proportion  in  2008  =  133,810/254,000  (52%)  and  in  2014  = \n133,810/833,000 (16%). \n\nc  Determined by displacement of the LPG equivalent of traditional solid fuels by LPG.  2007 LPG equivalents (tons) are:  \nanimal dung (181,845), firewood (443,511), charcoal (23,102), ping/bushes (169,611), and crop residues (22,911).   \nd  Import  statistics  can  be  used  to  both  estimate  legal  imports  of  LPG  and  as  a  proxy  for  LPG  demand,  since  compiled \n\ndemand statistics are not readily available and 100% of Afghanistan's LPG supply is imported. \n\ne  Estimated by assuming the uptake in LPG from Sungas increases from 4,600 tons (2008) to 190,000 tons (2019) with \n\n91% of sales to households; each household is estimated to consume 750 kg per year.   \n\nSources:    Vision  RI  estimates  based  on  NRVA  Survey  2005  (2008),  Vision  RI  market  study  (2008),  Sungas  Limited \n\nestimates (2008),  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n20    Appendix 2 \n  \n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry and Project Title: Afghanistan: Sungas LLC for the LPG Distribution Development Project \n\n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\n \n\n \n\nEquity Investment \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n \n\nPrivate Sector Operations Department/ \nInfrastructure Finance Division 1 \n\n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe country partnership strategy for Afghanistan (2009\u20132013)a has identified the limited availability and poor quality of power \ninfrastructure  (only  6%  of  the  population  has  access  to  electricity)  as  one  of  the  factors  undermining  the  country's \ncompetitiveness,  economic  opportunities,  and  delivery  of  social  services  such  as  education,  health  care,  and  security.  The \nproject,  which  will  develop  a  nationwide  liquefied  petroleum  gas  (LPG)  storage  and  distribution  network  in  Afghanistan,  will \npromote increased access to energy services by providing downstream distribution assets linking more Afghan households to \nLPG. The project is consistent with the 2009 Energy Policy as it directly delivers the Energy Policy's preferred option of LPG \nas  a  fuel  source  and  also  implements  an  efficient  delivery  system  that  will  lower  the  cost  of  switching  from  traditional  fuel \nsources to LPG. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues.  \nThe project connects more of the country's  low income  households to efficient  power and energy resources,  which  are key \nenablers in reducing poverty. Additionally, the project facilitates the transition for poor rural people switching from traditional \nbiomass  directly  to  LPG  rather  than  through  the  typical  intermediate  fuels  such  as  coal,  charcoal,  kerosene,  which  have \nunsustainable health, safety, and environmental effects. The project is also expected to foster sustainable economic growth \nas small and medium-size enterprises will have easy access to a clean fuel source.  \n2. Design Features \nThe  project  will  establish  a  nationwide  LPG  distribution  network  with  a  capacity  of  up  to  190,000  tons  per  year  by  2019.  \nFunds  will  primarily  be  used  for  development  of  distribution  centers  in  Herat,  Mazar-e-Sharif,  Kandahar,  and  Pul-e-Qumri, \nexpansion  of  the  saleable  inventory  of  LPG  cylinders,  and  for  general  capital  expenditures  to  support  the  LPG  storage \nterminals in Hairaton and Turghundy, expansion of the transportation fleet, and enhancement of distribution center equipment. \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending \nNot applicable. \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA. Findings of Social Analysis \nFindings of the social assessment show that there are limited negative social impacts during construction and operation. Sites \nfor the bulk storage facilities were located in areas at a safe distance from any human settlement or any public facilities. From \nthe perspective of ADB's Safeguard Policy  Statement (2009), the project is categorized as C. The Hairaton and Turghundy \nbulk storage facilities were constructed on vacant land near the Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan borders. These facilities, which \nwere  constructed  on  land  being  leased  by  the  government  to  ANP,  have  been  transferred  to  Sungas  Ltd.  at  incorporation. \nThree  refilling  stations,  each  requiring  1.5  hectares  of  land,  are  being  established  on  land  purchased  by  Sungas.  Pumping \nstations will be set up in other parts of the country on vacant land leased or purchased by Sungas either from the government \nor private owners. The selection of sites is being undertaken in such a way that involuntary resettlement is avoided. Moreover, \nSungas  only  puts  up  pumping  stations  on  land  where  lease  or  purchase  has  been  freely  negotiated  with  propery  owners. \nThere  are  a  number  of  ethnic  groups  in  Afghanistan,  such  as  the  Aimaks,  Baloch,  Brahui,  Hazaras,  Hindkowans,  Kuchi \nPashtuns,  Tajiks,  Turkmen,  and  Uzbek.    None  of  these  ethnic  groups  has  been  affected  as  bulk  storage  facilities  were \nconstructed  in  industrial  zones  and  refilling  and  pumping  stations  on  leased  or  purchased  land.  The  project  is  expected  to \nimprove  the  socioeconomic  living  conditions  of  people  living  in  five  major  centers,  namely,  Herat,  Kabul,  Kandahar,  and \nMazar-e-Sharif, by providing LPG to those using traditional sources of fuel for cooking, lighting, and heating, and good quality \nfuel for public and private transportation.  \n \nThe project is expected to improve the socioeconomic living conditions of people living in five major centers, namely, Kabul, \nHerat,  Mazar-e-Sharif,  Kandahar,  and  Pul-e-Khumri  by  providing  LPG  to  those  using  traditional  sources  of  fuel  for  cooking, \nlighting  and  heating  and  good  quality  fuel  for  public  and  private  transportation.  During  construction,  approximately  40\u201350 \nlaborers were employed by construction contractors at each site. During operation, Sungas is expected to increase local labor \nstaff from 108 to 336 in 5 years and to 372 by the 10th year.  \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2        21\n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nWith respect to the process of public participation and consultation, various formal and informal consultations were carried out \nduring the field assessment in April 2007. Representatives of regulatory agencies, local government officials and residents of \nnearby communities were consulted on socioeconomic conditions and likely impacts due to construction and operation of the \nproposed storage and refilling facilities, awareness on environmental quality (air, water, noise), presence of historical sites or \ncultural  places,  and  potential  hazards  to  the  health  and  safety  of  the  community.  Most  of  the  people  consulted  strongly \nsupport the project as they think the project will provide easy access to alternative sources of energy, generate employment, \nand  contribute  to  the  regional  and  local  economy.  With  respect  to  grievances,  there  has  been  no  reported  accident  or \ncomplaint on the operations of the bulk storage facilities at Hairaton and Turghundy. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.  Was a consultation and participation plan prepared? \nDuring project design, consultations were carried out in Kabul as part of the environment and social assessment process with \nbeneficiaries, local and national government officials, nongovernment organizations and community leaders, as stakeholders. \nConsultations were also conducted through informal discussions during field visits. During operations, Sungas has adopted a \npolicy  principle  to  demonstrate  openness  to  employees  and  the  community,  not  only  to  ensure  good  communications  with \nthese groups but also to promote local development. \n \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key  Issues.  The  project  will  connect  more  Afghans  to  energy  infrastructure,  which  is  expected  to  increase  household \nproductivity and alleviate much of the deprivation that currently exists among women and children, who spend valuable time \ncollecting firewood and biomass for cooking and heating.   \n \n2.  Key  Actions.
