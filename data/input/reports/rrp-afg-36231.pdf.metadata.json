Environmental  implications  were  reviewed,  and  no \nsignificant adverse environmental impacts were identified. \n \nBy  extending  a  postconflict  multisector  program \nto \nAfghanistan,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  support \npolicy  and  institutional  reforms  to  improve  governance  and \nstrengthen  the  financial,  transport,  and  energy  sectors;  and \npromote economic recovery and growth within the framework of a \nmarket economy. \n \nMore than 20 years of war and civil turmoil, together with 4 years \nof  drought  beginning  in  1999,  have  devastated  Afghanistan\u2019s \nthe  conditions  of  governance.  An \neconomy  and  affected \nappropriate  policy  and  governance \nframework  must  be \nestablished at all levels of government and all sectors to support \nreconstruction and rehabilitation of the economy. \n \nAt  the  macro  level,  the  Islamic  Transitional  Government  of \nAfghanistan  (ITGA)  is  committed  to  ensuring  noninflationary \ngrowth  and  macroeconomic  stability.  The  minister  of  finance  has \noutlined  an  ambitious  reform  agenda  across  a  range  of  issues \nincluding (i) revenue administration and expenditure management, \n(ii)  budget  preparation,  (iii)  central  bank  management,  and  (iv) \nother issues such as commercial banking and functional payments \nsystems. In addition to governance and financial sector reforms, \nITGA is committed to substantial policy and institutional reforms in \nkey  sectors  of  the  economy,  including  the  transport  and  energy \nsectors.  \n \nIn  partnership  with  ITGA,  ADB  is  working  closely  with  the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and other aid \nagencies  to  identify  the  selected  sectors  for  support  under  the \nprogram  loan  and  define  the  required  policy  and  institutional \nreforms and actions. The highly concessional loan funds will meet  \nthese  reforms  and \nthe  adjustment  costs  associated  with \nassociated  rehabilitation  activities.  ADB\u2019s  ongoing \ntechnical \nassistance  cluster  to  Afghanistan  will  further  support  the  reform \nprocess. \n\n\fiv \n\n \nObjective \n\n \n \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nThe program objective is to promote economic growth and poverty \nreduction through support for market-based policy reforms, public \ninfrastructure  investment,  and  institutional  capacity  building.  The \npurpose  is  to  enhance  opportunities  for  economic  revival  by \naddressing  key  policy  and  institutional  constraints  to  the  efficient \nand  effective  functioning  of  the  financial,  transport,  and  energy \nsectors  within  a \ntransparent  and  accountable  governance \nstructure.  The  Program  supports  ITGA\u2019s  National  Development \nFramework  (NDF)  and  National  Development  Budget  (NDB)  and \nis  consistent  with  the  operational  thrusts  of  ADB\u2019s  Initial  Country \nStrategy and Program for Afghanistan (2002\u20132004). \n \nThe  program  reform  agenda  will  be  complemented  by  the  TA \ncluster    (TAC)  approved  by  the  Board  on  30  May  2002,  which  is \nhelping  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  key  government  agencies \nand civil society institutions.    \n \nThe  adjustment  and  other  costs  of  the  policy  and  institutional \nreforms  addressed  by  the  program  loan  are  estimated  to  be  at \nleast about $158 million. \n \nITGA has requested a loan equivalent to $150 million from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Fund  resources  to  support  the  proposed  program,  as \nindicated  in  the  attached  development  policy  letter.  The  loan  will \nbe released in two installments upon satisfactory compliance with \nagreed-upon  conditions.  The \ntranche  of  $100  million \nequivalent  will  be  made  available  upon  loan  effectiveness.  The \nsecond tranche of $50 million equivalent  will  be  made  available \nabout 12 months later upon satisfactory compliance with agreed-\nupon conditions, as well as continued compliance with all previous \ntranche conditions. \n \n\nfirst \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  SDR113,496,000  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s  Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  (ADF)  to  support  the  program.  The  program \nloan  will  have  a  repayment  period  of  40  years,  including  a  grace \nperiod of 10 years, and carry an interest rate of 1.0% per annum. \nIn  addition,  the  interest  charge  during  the  grace  period  will  be \ncapitalized and charged to the Loan Account.  \n \n\n\f \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n\n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nConsulting Services \n\nv \n\n \nThe  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign \nexchange costs of items produced and procured in ADB member  \ncountries (except items specified in the negative list and  imports    \nfinanced  by  bilateral  and  multilateral    sources)    and  to  finance   \nhigh-priority  rehabilitation  projects.  The  Government  will  certify \nthat the volume of imports exceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s projected \ndisbursements  under  the  loan  for  the  given  period.  Counterpart \nfunds  generated  by  the  Postconflict  Multisector  Program  Loan \n(PMPL)  will  be  used  by  the  Government  to  meet  program \nexpenditures  and  related  costs  of  reforms.  No  relending  is \nplanned  under  the  program.  ADB  will  retain  the  right  to  audit the \nuse  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s certification. To facilitate the timely release of funds \nto  meet  adjustment  costs,  the  loan  proceeds  may  be  used  to \nfinance eligible imports incurred within 180 days before the date of \nloan effectiveness. \n \nThe program loan will be disbursed within a period of 18 months, \nbeginning from the date of loan effectiveness.  \n \n30 June 2004 \n\n \nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency (EA) \nand  will  be  responsible  for  disbursing  the  loan  proceeds  and \nmaintaining records. MOF, Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB), Office of \nAdministrative  Affairs  (OAA),  Civil  Service  Commission  (CSC), \nMinistry  of  Public  Works  (MPW),  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT), \nMinistry  of  Commerce  (MOC),  Ministry  of  Mines  and  Industry \n(MOMI),  and  Ministry  of  Water  and  Power  (MWP)  will  be \nimplementing  agencies  (IAs).  Each  will  be  responsible \nfor \nimplementing  the  relevant  policy  and  institutional  reforms  in  its \nsector.  A  steering  committee  will  be  formed,  chaired  by  the \nminister  of  finance  or  his  representative,  to  coordinate  policy \ndecisions that may need to be taken to pursue reforms under the \nPMPL. \n \nMinistry of Finance \n \nNo  consulting  services  will  be  provided  under  the  program.  \nConsidering  that  the  program  will  address  governance  and  basic \npolicy  and  institutional  reforms  in  the  transport,  energy,  and \nfinancial  sectors,  however,  necessary  provisions  were  made  for \ninvestment  and  capacity  building  in  these  areas  by  linking \nprogram monitoring and implementation with the activities of ADB-\nfunded advisors already working in the concerned ministries and \ndepartments under an ongoing TAC.1 \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2002.  Technical  Assistance  to  Afghanistan  for  Capacity  Building  for  Reconstruction  and  Development. \n\nManila. \n\n\fvi \n\n \nProgram Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nto \n\nindirectly  attributable \n\n \nThe Program will (i) provide critically needed fiscal support to the \nGovernment,  enabling  it  to  continue  providing  essential  services \nand rehabilitate and reconstruct the physical and social capital of \nAfghanistan; and (ii) contribute to economic recovery, employment \ngeneration, higher productivity, improved per capita incomes, and \nsocial  stability.  Specific  beneficiaries  are  hard  to  identify  a  priori \ndue  to  the  nature  of  the  Program,  but  might  reasonably  be \nexpected  to  include,  among  others,  the  rural  and  urban  poor, \nreturning  refugees,  internally  displaced  persons,  demobilized \ncombatants, and women. Specifically the following benefits will be \ndirectly  or \nthe  different  Program \ncomponents. \n \nIn  terms  of  governance  and  financial  sector  development:  (i) \nimproved public sector; efficiency and effectiveness, (ii) improved \nresource  mobilization  from  domestic  and  foreign  sources  for \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction,  (iii)  improved  macroeconomic \nmanagement  and  payments  system,  and  (iv)  development, \ndiversification and deepening of the financial sector. \n \nIn terms of infrastructure development: (i) improved national road \nnetwork,  (ii)  improved  maintenance  of  roads,  (iii)  increased  sub-\nregional  cooperation  and  foreign  private  investment  in  electricity \nand  natural  gas  development,  and  (iv)  increased  production  and \ndistribution of natural gas and electricity. \n \nImplementation of the program entails a number of risks: \n \nGovernment  commitment  to  the  reform  process  could  weaken. \nDespite recent policy statements by the president and the minister \nof  finance,  other  ministers  and  senior  officials  may  have  vested \ninterests  or  opposing  philosophies  with  regard  to  the  role  of  the \ngovernment  and  the  public  sector.    There  is  therefore  a  risk  that \npolitical  will  to  implement  the  proposed  reforms  will  be  tested  in \nthe  months  ahead.  There  is  also  a  risk  that  a  change  in \nGovernment after the national elections scheduled for June 2004 \nmight result in a policy shift.  However, the PMPL does not cover \npolitically  sensitive  areas,  such  as  reforms  in  the  social  sectors \nand  agriculture,  and  prospects  for  a  change  in  Government  that \nwould  significantly  alter  the  broad  macroeconomic  and  policy \norientation appear relatively remote at this stage. \n \nThe  overall  political  and  security  situation  remains  volatile,  and  it \nis  yet  to  be  seen  how  much  the  situation  will  improve.  ADB  will \nneed to closely monitor the situation. \n \n\n\fvii \n\nWeak  implementation  capacity  may  delay  implementation  of \nreforms. ITGA has limited capacity for planning and implementing \neven  basic  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction.  In  addition,  there  is \nlimited  understanding  of  the  policy  and  institutional  reform \nprocess, and of the importance of synchronization and appropriate \nphasing.  ADB\u2019s  TAC  will  help  mitigate  this  problem.  MOF  has \nassumed  a  lead  role  in  eliminating  development  constraints  and \nbringing the PMPL and other reform programs to fruition. \n \nThe macroeconomic and budgetary situation may worsen, causing \na  diversion  of  funds  from  meeting  adjustment  and  other  costs \nassociated with the program\u2019s policy and institutional reforms. The \nGovernment  and  the  international  community  are  providing \nsignificant levels of relief and rehabilitation assistance to affected \ngroups. The situation will be carefully monitored. \n \nAid  coordination  requirements  are  extensive.  The  Program  was \nformulated with the Government, in close consultation with the aid \ncommunity  especially  the  World  Bank  and  IMF.  The  coordination \nprocess  will  need  to  be  further  enhanced  during  program \nimplementation. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \n\n1. \nto Afghanistan for the Postconflict Multisector Program. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT  \n\n2. \nSince the catastrophic events of September 11, which catapulted Afghanistan onto the \ninternational stage, the world has witnessed the removal of the Taliban from power; the signing \nof a power-sharing agreement calling for a \u201cbroad-based, moderate and unitary Afghan state\u201d by \nrepresentatives  of  the  major  Afghan  factions  in  Bonn  in  December  2001;  the  installation  of  an \ninterim  administration;  the  preparation  of  an  ordinary  budget,1  strategy  for  recovery  and \nreconstruction,  as  outlined  in  a  national  development  framework  (NDF)2  and  national \ndevelopment budget (NDB);3 and the convening of a  Loya Jirga (a traditional council of elders) \nin June 2001, that allowed for a smooth and orderly transfer of power to a legitimate transitional \ngovernment led by H.E. Hamid Karzai, to rule Afghanistan for a further 2 years and prepare the \nground  for  elections  by  June  2004.  Throughout  this  period,  the  Government  and  people  of \nAfghanistan have sought to assert their own leadership in the recovery and reconstruction effort. \nRecent statements by Government leaders indicate a strong commitment to political, economic, \nand social development; to a free and competitive economic system, and private-sector-driven \ngrowth that invites domestic and foreign investment\u2014to create jobs and increase income; and, \nto this end, to undertaking a series of necessary policy and institutional reforms. \n \n3. \nEconomic  Performance.    The  absence  of  reliable  economic  data  for  Afghanistan \nmakes  it  difficult  to  report  with  any  degree  of  accuracy  on  its  past  and  recent  performance.4 \nAfghanistan\u2019s  gross  national  product  (GNP)  was  estimated  at  $6.7  billion  in  1997/98, giving a \nper capita GNP of $280.5 Per capita GNP is currently estimated at only $182 in 1998 dollars (or \n\n                                                 \n1  In April 2002, the Government announced an ordinary budget of $463 million for Solar Year (SY) 1381 (22 March \n2002-21  March  2003)  to  cover  ordinary  expenditures  including  wages,  salaries,  and  other  recurrent  expenses. \nRefer to para. 7 for  details.  \n\n2  The  goal  of  the  National  Development  Framework  (NDF)  is  to  provide  a  strategic  plan  for  the  development  of \nAfghanistan, around which all actors can unite, to address poverty and provide economic opportunity through a \nseries of concrete programs and projects. The NDP is based on five principles: (i) the development strategy must \nbe  domestically  owned,  with  the  Government  in  the  driver\u2019s  seat;  (ii)  markets  and  the  private  sector  are  more \neffective  instruments  than  the  state  in  delivering  sustained  growth;  (iii)  aid  cannot  be  effective  without  the  state \ninvesting in human capital and the creation of an institutional framework that allows the rule of law to prevail; (iv) \npromoting  sustainable  economic  growth  requires  the  active  participation  of  the  population;  and  (v)  externally-\nfunded investments must be anchored in the Government\u2019s development program to be successful over the longer \nterm.    The  NDF  focuses  on  three  pillars  of  development:  (i)  security  and  human  development,  (ii)  rebuilding \nphysical  infrastructure,  and  (iii)  enabling  the  creation  of  a  viable  private  sector  as  the  engine  for  sustainable  and \ninclusive  economic  growth.  Restoring  security  and  reestablishing  law  and  order,  administrative  and  financial \nreform,  and  gender  are  crosscutting  priorities.  The  key  challenges  and  priorities  in  the  short  term  are  to  quickly \nestablish  basic  security  for  the  population,  revitalize  agriculture,  facilitate  private  economic  activity,  and  rebuild \ninfrastructure and social services.  Please refer to Appendix 8 for an official NDF summary. \n\n3  The  Ministry  of  Finance  presented  a  national  development  budget  (NDB)  to  a  meeting  of  the  Implementation       \nGroup in Kabul on 12-13 October 2002.  The NDB translates the priorities of the NDF into programs and projects \nwhile  simultaneously  providing  a  vehicle  for  policy  development.    It  provides  an  outline  of  ongoing  and  proposed \ninvestments for 2002-2004 and consolidates investments  based around 12 programs presented within the NDF. \n4  Compilation of most macroeconomic statistics was discontinued in the mid-1990s, except for the consumer price \nindex. The International Monetary Fund has place a resident statistics advisor in Kabul to assist in capacity building \nand  implementing  a  number  of  recommendations  regarding  data  compilation.  Much  of  the  macroeconomic  data \npresented here are estimates and the best information available to ADB as of November 2002. \n\n5  The exchange rate in 1997-98 was approximately $1=Af4,679. \n\n\f2 \n\n$205  in  2002  dollars),  reflecting  the  effects  of  the  war,  civil  turmoil,  and  4-year  drought.6 A \nrebound in economic growth is expected in 2002\u20132003.    \n\n \n4. \nPoverty. Poverty has worsened over the past two decades, with an estimated 60\u201380% \nof  the  population  living  below  the  threshold  of  $1  a  day.7  It  is  estimated  that  80%  of  the  rural \npopulation is in need of emergency assistance, as cereal production declined by 50% between \n1998  and  2001.  Vulnerable  groups  include  small  farmers,  landless  laborers,  sharecroppers, \ndebtors,  internally  displaced  persons  (IDPs,  estimated  at  1.1  million),  returning  refugees,  ex-\ncombatants, war widows and orphans, and the disabled (800,000, of whom 200,000 were mine \nvictims).8  IDPs  are  particularly  indigent,  as  they  receive  little  or  no  assistance,  in  contrast  to \nreturning refugees who have some resources of their own. \n\n \n5. \nInflation. Consumer prices increas ed by almost 70% between 1994 and 1998, or at an \nannual compound rate of inflation of 14%. According to the Kabul-based consumer price index \n(CPI)  produced  by  the  Central  Statistical  Office  (CSO),  prices  have  fluctuated  widely  over  the \npast year \u2014 first deflating as a result of the appreciation of the afghani following September 11. \nThe Kabul CPI increased by just over 1% in the second quarter of 2002, well below the 4.5% \nenvisaged in the monetary program.  \n\n \nExchange  Rate.  The  official  exchange  rate  of  Af45:$1  set  in  1963  was  adjusted  to \n6. \nAf3,000:$1  in  April  1996,  reflecting,  among  other  factors,  a  weakening  of  monetary  discipline \nunder the Jamiat regime. During the late 1990s, the currency further depreciated as a result of \nmarket  forces.  By  2000,  the  foreign  exchange  market  had  become  more  fragmented  and \nvolatile, with wide divergence between official, spot, and black market rates and also between \nTaliban  and  opposition-controlled  areas.  By  September  2001  the  rate  had  depreciated  to \nAf79,000.  Following  the  start  of  the  war  on  terrorism  in  Afghanistan,  the  currency  appreciated \nsignificantly to under Af30,000:$1 by December 2001. Since then, the afghani has weakened to \nAf35,000\u2013Af40,000 to the dollar. Most recently, the exchange rate plunged to Af60,000 or lower, \nas  a  result  of  the  announcement  that  the  Government  would  introduce  a  new  currency.9 An \nupsurge of violence also exacerbated the exchange rate volatility. \n\n \n7. \nFiscal  Developments.  On  6  April  2002,  the  Afghanistan  Interim  Administration  (AIA) \nadopted  an  ordinary  budget  of  $460.3  million  for  FY2003.10  A  development  budget,  which  is \n\n                                                 \n6  ADB staff estimates. The population in 2002 is estimated to be 26.4 million. Per capita gross domestic product is \nlikely underestimated by $15-41, or more, reflecting illegal trade in drugs and arms. Transfer from abroad are about \n$1 billion annually, adding to the gross national product (GNP). \n\n7  Reliable statistics on poverty are not available. \n8  ADB,  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  and  the  World  Bank.  January  2002.  Afghanistan: Preliminary \n\nNeeds Assessment for Recovery and Reconstruction. \n\n9  On the evening of 4 September, President Hamid Karzai announced a new currency. The new currency will still be \ncalled afghani, but each new afghani will be worth 1,000 old ones. The operation will remove from circulation an \ninflated currency that has been cumbersome to use, requiring an excessive number of notes for most transactions. \nThe  operation  to  exchange  the  old  notes  for  new  ones  is  expected  to  take  about  2  months.  The  IMF  issued  a \nstatement following the President\u2019s announcement saying: \u201cThe authorities\u2019 decision to introduce a new currency is \nan  important  step  in  their  efforts  to  establish  macroeconomic  stability  and  to  create  an  environment  that  is \nconducive to restoring sustainable economic growth in Afghanistan. The new afghani will be a symbol of national \nsovereignty and unity. The authorities fully recognize that the outlook for the currency will to a large extent depend \non  the  fiscal  and  financial  policies  of  the  government,  and  the  Fund  welcomes  the  authorities\u2019  demonstrated \ncommitment  to  implement  sound  fiscal  and  monetary  policies.  The  introduction  of  a  new  currency  is  a  major \noperation with numerous logistical challenges to overcome. Preparations for the change over are well under way.\u201d \n\n10  The Fiscal year starts on 21 March. FY2003 refers to 21 March 2002-20 March 2003. \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nessentially a list of externally-funded investment projects, covering both the current FY2003 and  \nFY 2004, was presented in October 2002 and is estimated at about $3.2 billion. For financing, \nthe  ordinary  (recurrent)  budget,  the  Government  projected  $83  million  or  18%  of  total \nexpenditures  sourced  from  domestic  revenue,  with  the  remainder  financed  by  external \nassistance.11  The  budget  gap  could  be  higher  due  to  the  fact  that  a  portion  of  domestic \nrevenues  will  be  needed  to  cover  $22.5  million  in  back  salaries  for  civil  servants  for  August\u2013\nDecember 2001. According to a report prepared by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) in October,12 \ndomestic  revenues  in  the  first quarter amounted to $22.7 million (mainly from customs duties) \nagainst planned revenues of $16 million; however, transmittal of revenues by provincial offices \nhas been problematic partly due to the difficulty of determining surpluses in provinces that are to \nbe submitted to the central Government. Foreign assistance for recurrent expenditures has also \nfallen short of expectations. In addition, $285.4 million in grants from multilateral (e.g., AIA and \nLand and Order Trust Funds of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the \nAfghanistan  Reconstruction  Trust  Fund  (ARTF),  and  bilateral  sources13 are  expected, against \nthe  required  $377.3  million.  It  follows  that  the  revised  budget  for  FY  2003  includes  a  net \nfinancing gap of $91.9 million. A fiscal  crisis has so far been avoided; however, the situation is \nexpected  to  change  in  the  coming  months  and  financial  resources  are  urgently  needed.  The \nWorld  Bank  is  processing  direct  support  of  $100  million  through  its  International  Development \nAssociation  (ID A)  resources.  While  the  Development  Budget  will  need  to  be  largely  foreign \nfinanced  for  the  foreseeable  future,  the  ordinary  budget  will  eventually  be  financed  from \ndomestic revenues. As the authority of the central Government extends over the entire country, \nrevenue collections from both direct and indirect sources should increased substantially.  \n\n \nMonetary Developments. Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB), the central bank, is responsible \n8. \nfor monetary policy. During the Taliban regime, however, DAB had little authority over currency \nregulation.  In  September  2002,  ITGA  announced  that  it  would  introduce  a  single  Afghan \ncurrency  to  replace  the  multiple  Afghani  currencies  that  are  currently  in  circulation.    To  this \neffect, DAB has been assigned full authority over the issuance of currency. DAB has decided to \nissue completely new Afghani banknotes with higher security features to prevent counterfeiting, \nand  to  withdraw  the  existing  multiple  variations  now  in  circulation.  Conversion  of  the  currency \nwill get underway in October 2002.  As noted earlier, the announcement has triggered a sharp \ndepreciation  of  the  currency,  reflecting  that  currency  traders  and  the  public  alike  lack \nunderstanding of the conversion process.  To extend its currency control, DAB will  encourage \nforeign  exchange  transactions  through  the  banking  system.  Further,  it  will  be  involved  in \nauctioning  foreign  exchange  to  ensure  that  money  creation  is  limited  by  the  holding  of  foreign \nexchange reserves at DAB.  According to the IMF, the increase in the money supply during the \nfirst  quarter  of  2002  was  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  target  of  limiting  the  12-month \ninflation  rate  to  18%.  Absence  of  a  modern  banking  system  makes  formulating  and \nimplementing  a  monetary  policy  difficult.  DAB  is  not  yet fully operational and commercial and \nother banks are much less so. The country depends on the traditional hawala system for money \ntransfer, the only effective operational payments system. \n\n \n9. \nExternal  Account.  Available  data  indicate  that  Afghanistan  has  experienced  large \ncurrent account deficits since the late 1990s. Official capital transfers and unofficial transactions \n(e.g.,  the  drug  trade)  financed  the  gap.  A  survey  sponsored  by  the  World  Bank  found  that \n\n                                                 \n11 Assumed exchange rate is Af34,000=$1. \n12  Ministry  of  Finance,  Transitional  Islamic  State  of  Afghanistan.  Report  on  Donor  Assistance  for  the  Afghanistan   \n\nOrdinary Budget. A report submitted to the Implementation Group Meeting, 12-13 October, Kabul. \n\n13 Of this amount, $54 million is categorized as \u201cExpected, Unannounced.\u201d  \n\n\f4 \n\nAfghanistan\u2019s  total  trade  in  2000  was  $2.5  billion,  comprising  $1.2  billion  in  imports  and  $1.2 \nbillion  in  exports,  most  of  which  was  comprised  of  reexports.14 Trade has since fallen sharply, \nexcept for emergency food aid and other imports and perhaps exports of opium. The AIA and \nITGA have extended the Taliban-imposed ban on poppy cultivation and opium production, but \nthere  is  no  machinery  to  enforce  it.  In  fact,  it  is  reported  that  poppy  cultivation  has  picked  up \nconsiderably and Afghanistan is once again the world\u2019s largest producer of  opium, estimated at \n2,952  tons  in  2002,  up  from  74  tons  in  2001.    Reported  collections  of  customs  duties  give  an \ninsight into the level of imports. In the first quarter of 2002, customs collections were about $20 \nmillion,  which  implies  an  annual  official  import  volume  of  at  least  $600  million,  assuming  an \naverage  tariff  of  20%,  and  coverage  rate  of  67%.  Imports  are  likely  to  grow  at  the  rate  of  15\u2013\n20% annually over the next few years but exports will likely grow more slowly.  \n\n \nExternal Debt.  The external debt15 situation is very sketchy with the exception of debt \n10. \nto international financial institutions (IFIs). Arrears to the IFIs total about $54 million (i.e., about \n$27 million with IDA, about $17 million with ADB, and about $10 million with IMF). Once arrears \nto the IFIs are cleared, outstanding debts to the IFIs of  about $86 (of which $15.8 million is to \nADB) would be serviced. The total debt to Paris Club members (excluding Russia) is estimated \nat  about  $473  million.  Outstanding  Russian  loans  amount  to  $5.9  billion  as  of  1991,  valued  at \none-to-one with the US dollar. After including the outstanding balance (deficit) of Afghanistan\u2019s \nbilateral  payments  agreements  as  of  1991,  total  debt  owed  to  Russia  amounts  to  Rubles  6.6 \nbillion.  Under  the  agreement  on  Russia\u2019s  participation  in  the  Paris  Club  as  a  creditor, \nAfghanistan  would  be  eligible  for  an  upfront  discount  of  80  percent  prior  to  any  future \nconcessional  rescheduling.  Other  than  these  information,  given  the  very  weak  database  and \nconsiderable  uncertainties  about  Afghanistan\u2019s  economic  prospects,  as  well  as  uncertainties \nabout  economic  projects,  as  well  as  the  absence  of  the  precise  foresight  on  how  the  existing \ndebt  might  be  rescheduled  or  forgiven,  the  debt  sustainability  analysis  is  very  difficult.  The \nresults  depend  very  much  on  the  assumptions  made  on  macroeconomic  scenarios  and  debt \nrescheduling  arrangements.  While  precise  conclusions  cannot  be  drawn  from  the  preliminary \nanalysis,  general  implications  are:  (i)  achievement  of  debt  sustainability  will  probably  require \ndebt relief that goes beyond the normal terms of debt restructuring, (ii) debt indicators appear to \nworsen in the initial period, the duration of which depends on the macro scenario, before leading \nto a robust improving trend,  and (iii) debt sustainability is very sensitive to positive or negative \nshocks to output and export growth. The macroeconomic situation needs close monitoring over \nthe  medium  term  before  it  can  be  said  with  any  degree  of  certainty  whether  the  Afghan \neconomy  is  on  a  desired  path.  Of  course,  stability  in  the  security  situation  and  Government \ncommitment to sound macroeconomic management are prerequisites to debt sustainability.  \n\n \n11. \nAid  Flows.  The  international  community  pledged  $5.1  billion  in  assistance  at  the \nInternational  Conference  on  Reconstruction  Assistance  to  Afghanistan  in  Tokyo  in  January \n\n                                                 \n14  World Bank, 2001. Afghanistan\u2019s International Trade Relations with Neighboring Countries 2001. \n15 Based on the latest ADB staff analysis with inputs from IMF staff reflected. Work is underway by IMF staff on the \nsustainability  of  Afghanistan\u2019s  debt.  In  this  work,  the  implications  of  different  scenarios  are  being  explored \nregarding  the  extent  of  debt  relief,  the  mix  of  external  financial assistance (nonconcessional and concessional, \nincluding  grants),  the  quality  of  economic  policies  and  their  implementation,  and  different  growth  and  exports \nassumptions.  Although  this  work  is  at  a  preliminary  stage,  the  early  implications  are  that  given the initial level of \nAfghanistan\u2019s external debt, the achievement of debt sustainability will depend importantly on positive policy and \ngrowth outcomes and the extent of concessional financing. \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\n2002.  Some  donors  made  multi  year  pledges  and  commitments  of  various  timeframes.16 \nRevised pledges for 2002 total $1.94 billion, about $1.73 billion of which has been committed for \nspecific  projects.  17  As  of  October  2002,  however,  disbursements  per  capita  are  far  lower  in \nAfghanistan than in other recent post conflict settings, suggesting that there is an urgent need to \n\u201cshift gears\u201d and accelerate program delivery so as to meet Afghanistan\u2019s huge reconstruction \nneeds.  Specifically,  about  $1.31  billion,  or  67%  of  pledges  for  2002,  has  been  disbursed  (i.e. \nhas  been  placed  in  a  bank  account  of  the  implemented  or  in  one  of  several  trust  funds  for \nAfghanistan). The breakdown of this amount follows: $195 million has been deposited in various \ntrust  funds,  $50  million  was  committed  for  \u201clarge  ticket  items\u201d  such  as  United  Nations \nHumanitarian  Air  Services  (UNHAS)  flights  and  agency  information  services;  $20  million \nsupported  Afghan  refugees  outside  Afghanistan;  about  $630  million  was  committed  for \nhumanitarian/relief activities; and $420 million went to reconstruction-related activities. The last \ntwo categories are hard to pin down. Much of the reconstruction assistance is emergency/short-\nterm  assistance  to  provide  education  or  basic  sanitation  to  IDPs/refugees,  for  example,  or  for \nde-mining activities. \n \nNeed  to  Fast-Track  Assistance.  ITGA  has  launched  an  ambitious  nation-building \n12. \nagenda.  It  is  committed  to  far-reaching  policy  and  institutional  changes  to  set  the  stage  for \nreconstruction  and  development.  The  opportunity  cost  of  delayed  assistance  by  the  aid \ncommunity to underwrite investments required for reconstruction and development is very high, \nin  both  human  and  political  terms.  The  cost  would  be  both  national  and  regional.  With  the \ncountry\u2019s  economy  restored  and  on  a  solid  growth  path,  and  with  social  stability,  the \nconsiderable  potential  for  subregional  cooperation  and  mutual  benefits  among  neighboring \ncountries could be realized. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTORS \n\nSector Descriptions and Performance \n\nA. \n \n13. \nThe  objective  of  ADB\u2019s  initial  strategy  and  operations  in  Afghanistan  is  to  assist  the \nGovernment  in  making  a  seamless  transition  from  humanitarian  to  reconstruction  and \ndevelopment assistance. This will take place under the overall vision of the NDF. The emphasis \nis  on  broad-based  growth  within  a  multi-ethnic  society,  which  is  essential  to  reducing  poverty \nand securing peace and stability. Broad-based growth will be inclusive, engaging the productive \npotential  of  the  poor,  including  women,  returned  refugees  and  IDPs,  and  other  vulnerable \ngroups,  and  ensuring  that  they  are  an  integral  part  of  the  growth  process.  To  achieve  this \nobjective, ADB will work with the leadership of the ITGA, together with Afghan civil society, local \ncommunities, the private sector, and other development partners, to bring about the policy and \ninstitutional changes required for sound future investments. \n \n14. \nThe Postconflict Multisector  Program  loan  (PMPL)  will  address  policy  and  institutional \nreforms  concerning  governance  and  the  financial,  transport,  and  energy  sectors.    Reforms  in \nthese  sectors  and  areas  will  help  pave  the  way  for  the  sustained  long-term  growth  of \nAfghanistan\u2019s  economy.  These  sectors  constitute  the  focus  of  the  program  because  (i)  the \nExecuting Agency requested that the program focus on these sectors, (ii) ADB plans to provide \n\n                                                 \n16  The  preliminary  needs  assessment  estimated  that  $1.7  billion in external contributions would be required for the \nfirst year of Afghanistan\u2019s recovery to jump-start reconstruction effectively, $4.9 billion in the first 2.5 years, $10.2 \nbillion in the first 5 years, and $14.6 billion over the first decade. \n\n17 Based on information provided by Afghan Assistance Coordination Authority at the Implementation Group Meeting \n\non 12-13 October 2002 in Kabul. \n\n\f6 \n\n \n \n\ngrant  financing  for  pilot  projects  involving  rehabilitation  of  small-scale  irrigation  systems  and \neducation  and  health  facilities,  and  (iii)  bilateral  sources  are  already  providing  considerable \nassistance for agriculture and the social sectors. In addition, ADB\u2019s ongoing TAC, a $150 million \nemergency  rehabilitation  project  planned  for  early  2003,  and  a  social  sector  program  loan \nproposed for later in 2003 will address the social and agriculture sectors, with the result that key \nsectors will be supported by ADB.18 In this context, it is useful to review the current situation of \nthe financial, transport, energy, education, health, and agriculture sectors. \n\n1. \n\nFinancial and Public Sector Management \n\n15. \nThe financial sector is extremely weak. DAB, the country\u2019s central bank, is still not fully \nfunctional and lacks the instruments for effectively managing monetary policy. Multiple domestic \ncurrencies  exist  and  replacing  them  with  a  new  single  national  currency  will  be  extremely \ndifficult and potentially destabilizing in the short run.  The price of money fluctuates sharply and \nthere  is  no  official  reference  interest  rate,  either  in  the  central  bank  or  the  few  commercial \nbanks.19  Urgently  needed  policy  and  institutional  reforms  include  modernizing  of  the  central \nbank, separating of central and commercial banking activities, developing accounting standards \nand  prudential  rules,  exercising  bank  supervision,  establishing  payments  system,  regulating \ncurrency, managing foreign exchange, and modernizing and expanding the banking system. In \nthe  absence  of  a  stable  monetary  system  and  an  accessible  credit  system, reviving economic \nactivities to their potential will remain extremely problematic. After all, farmers need short- and \nmedium-term  credit  to  resume  agricultural  activity;  trade  and  commercial  activities  cannot \nresume  without  working  capital  support;  and  industrial  (small-  and  medium-scale)  activities \nrequire  both  short-  and  longer-term  credit.  Also,  the  absence  of  credible  financial  institutions \nhampers  savings  mobilization  and  financial  intermediation.  The  capital  market  is  undeveloped \nand modern savings and investment instruments are almost nonexistent.  \n\n \n16. \nRegarding  fiscal  management,  in  April  2002  ITGA  announced  an  ordinary  budget  of \n$460  million  for  FY2003  to  cover  recurrent  expenditures  including  wages  and  salaries.    More \nthan  80%  of  the  ordinary  budget  will  have  to  be  financed  by  foreign  assistance,  but \ncommitments  as  of  September  2002  for  this  purpose  were  still  short  by  $166  million.20 The \ndevelopment budget will more than double the need for foreign assistance. \n\n \n17.  War  and  civil  turmoil  spanning  more  than  two  decades  have  severely  undermined \nsignificant  elements  of  the  administration.  Responsibility  for  overall  management  of  the  civil \nservice  is  diffused  and  the  division  of  responsibilities  within  and  between  the  central  and \nprovincial governments is unclear. Many ministers and ministries have little experience in policy \nmaking and in directing the public service. The Cabinet needs technical assistance in support of \nthe policy and institutional reform process. The Office of Administrative Affairs (OAA) serves the \n\n                                                 \n18  The  Minister  of  Finance  requested  ADB  on  1  September  2002  to  process  an  emergency  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction project of at least $150 million, for consideration in early 2003, in addition to the PMPL. The project \nloan  will  focus  on  rehabilitation  of  priority  infrastructure,  including  national  roads,  petroleum  storage  facilities, \nirrigation schemes, civil aviation facilities, among others. \n\n19 DAB nominally has 89 branches, 20 of which have been destroyed and 14 are dysfunctional. There are also six \nbanks  (two  commercial  banks,  a  trade  finance  bank,  an  agriculture  development  bank,  a  housing  bank  and  an \nindustry bank). However, none of these are performing intermediation functions. \n\n20 Transitional Government of Afghanistan, Ministry of Finance, 2002. Afghan Ordinary Budget and Donor Assistance, \nReport  by  Ashraf  Ghani,  Finance  Minister  to  the  Co-Chairs,  Afghanistan  Recons truction  Steering  Committee \n(ARSG), 6 July 2002. \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nCouncil  of  Ministers,  but  is  not  very  effective,  partly  because  of  its  centralized  approach. \nDevelopments  during  the  past  two  decades  have  resulted  in  (i)  considerable  weakening  of \ncontrols in managing financial resources; (ii) a breakdown in the revenue system and collection  \nand management of basic information for decision making; and (iii) a nontransparent system of \nappointments of staff. Although there have been some recent improvements, basic systems and \nskills  for  preparing  budgets,  programs,  and  projects  are  very  weak.  Operational  problems \ninclude  (i)  inability  to  produce  an  accurate  payroll  or  to  make  timely  payment  of  salaries;  (ii) \ninsufficient  checks  and  balances  in  the  payroll  system;  (iii)  poor  management  of  personnel \nrecords; and (iv) absence of merit-based recruitment or effective control of recruitment caps.   \n \n \n\nInfrastructure \n\n2. \n\nAfghanistan  is  a  large  country  (about  the  size  of  France)  with  a  population  of \n18. \napproximately  24  million,  widely  dispersed  over  mountainous  terrain.    It  is  also  a  landlocked \ncountry.  Consequently, road and air transport are vital to Afghanistan\u2019s development prospects. \nRoad transport is also vital to facilitating humanitarian aid and the return of refugees.  The road \nnetwork includes about 5,800 kilometers (km) of national roads, 2,700 km of secondary roads, \nand 15,000 km of provincial roads. Only 2,400 km of national roads were originally paved. The \nremaining  network  of  roads  has  either  gravel  or  earthen  surface.  Their  state has not yet been \nsurveyed systematically, although it is apparent that the road system generally is substandard.  \nMore  than  two  decades  of  conflict  combined  with  lack  of  maintenance  has  resulted  in  serious \ndamage  to  extended  road  sections,  critical  structures,  bridges,  and  the  snow  galleries  on  the \napproach  to  the  Salang  Tunnel.  A  recent  survey  of  some  sections  of  the  network  shows  the \nroad conditions have further deteriorated. The Ministry of Public Works (MPW) urgently needs \nassistance  to  rebuild  confidence  following  the  assassination  of  Vice  President  and  Minister  of \nPublic Works Muhammad Haji Kadir in July 2002 and long-standing managerial problems. The \nministry is considerably overstaffed and the financial and asset management system must be \nthoroughly strengthened.  \n \n19. \nAfghanistan is well endowed with natural gas, coal and hydropower. Geological studies \ncarried  out  with  financial  and  technical  assistance  from  the  former  Soviet  Union  show  that  the \ncountry is potentially rich in hydrocarbon resources. Afghanistan\u2019s energy sector infrastructure is \nin disarray because of a combination of factors: the direct effects of war and conflict, shortage of \nexpertise,  and  unavailability  of  spare  parts,  tools,  and  equipment  due  to  lack  of  funding.  As  a \nresult,  sector  entities  are  unable  to  operate,  repair,  and  maintain  the  system.  Gas  production, \ntransmission, and distribution systems suffer from severe operating problems and urgently need \nrehabilitation. The gas supply is grossly inadequate to meet current  requirements mainly due to \nloss of production facilities and a high rate of leakage. Gas leakage represents not only a loss of \nrevenue but also a major safety hazard. State institutions are basically dysfunctional. Electricity \nnetworks are located around big cities and industrial areas; there is no national power grid.  The \npower sector is characterized by daily rationing of electricity, loss of power generation capacity, \nmissing  overhead  transmission  and  distribution  lines,  and  high  system  losses.  The  country \nimports most of its requirements of petroleum products. A significant part of the infrastructure for \nstoring,  transporting,  and  distributing  petroleum  products  has  been  damaged  while  the \nremaining  capacity  is  in  need  of  rehabilitation.  As  a  result  the  supply of petroleum products is \nunregulated and distribution is very costly. \n \n20. \nSignificant gas reserves were discovered in the early 1960s near the city of Sheberghan.  \nCommercially, natural gas is the most important primary energy source. Potential gas reserves \nare  estimated  to  be  about  250  billion  cubic  meters  (m3).    The  reserves  are  spread  over  eight \nfields in the northern area of the country. Two fields have been brought into production, but the \n\n\f8 \n\nremaining six have not been exploited and the field structure has not been delineated. The first \ngas  field  was  developed  and  put  into  commercial  operation  in  1967  for  export  to  the  former \nSoviet  Union.  A  pipeline  was  built  from  the  gas  field  to  the  border  with  Uzbekistan,  where  it \nconnected to a major pipeline to the Soviet Union. The second gas field was developed in 1980. \nGas exports ended in 1987 with the end of Soviet domination in Afghanistan. For domestic gas \nconsumption, a transmission pipeline was built from Sheberghan to Mazar-i-Sharif, a distance of \nabout 135 km. Gas production in the 1980s amounted to an average 2.8 million m3 per day, of \nwhich  about  2.4  million  m3  was  for  export  and  the  remaining  400,000  m3  was  for  domestic \nconsumption.  Thus,  86%  of  the  gas  produced  was  exported.  The  current  gas  production  is \nabout 550,000 m3 per day, that is, about one fourth the level of production in the 1980s. \n \n \n\nSocial Sectors  \n\n3. \n\n21. \nThe social sectors are not included as components of the PMPL (para.13), as to do so \nwould  place  too  many  demands  on  the  PMPL.  Instead,  ADB  is  addressing  the  social  sectors \nthrough  other  instruments,  including  (i)  an  ongoing  cluster  TA,  (ii)  a  $4  million  grant-funded \nproject  for  community-based,  gender-sensitive  basic  education  from  ADB's  Japan  Fund  for \nPovery Reduction (JFPR), financed by the Government of Japan, and (iii) the possible provision \nof additional grant assistance for a $3 million pilot project for health, and a social sector program \nLoan  for  $50  million  in  2003.  It  is  further  noted  that  ADB  and  the  Government  led  the \npreparation  by  the  aid  community  of  the  preliminary  and  comprehensive  needs  assessments \n(CNA)  for  Afghanistan\u2019s  education  sector,  which  serve  as  the  basis  for  many  programs  and \nprojects  supported  by  ADB\u2019s  development  partners.  Although  the  PMPL  does  not  directly \naddress the social sectors, the activities of other aid agencies working with ITGA in addressing \neducation  policy  and  institutional  reforms  will  benefit  importantly  from  the  findings  and \nrecommendations of the CNA.  In this context, it is useful to review briefly the current situation of \nthe social sectors. \n \n22. \nThe Afghan education system suffered badly as a result of 23 years of war, widespread \nphysical  destruction,  restructuring  under  the  Communist  regime,  and  successive  governments \nuse of the nation as a political and religious pawn. The capacity to supply education in terms of \nboth  quantity  and  quality  was  decimated,  even  as  the  demand  expanded  in  both  quantity  and \ncomplexity.   The regime change in December 2001 and the relative political stability, together \nwith extensive foreign assistance for the education sector, have given renewed opportunity for \nchildren  to  attend  school.    Despite  serious  deficiencies  in  school  structures  and  teaching \nmaterials,  and  salary  arrears  of  several  months  to  teachers  and  school  administrators,  the \nnumbers of students and teachers who have returned to school as a result of the back-to-school \ncampaign have far exceeded expectations. The United Nations Children Fund estimates that 3 \nmillion are in search of schooling opportunities. \n \n23. \nThe most informed estimates suggest that Afghanistan\u2019s education indicators are among \nthe  worst  in  the  world,  with  girls  and  rural  populations  being  particularly  disadvantaged.21  \nBefore  installation  of  the  AIA  in  December,  the  gross  enrollment  rate  (GER)  for  primary \neducation  was  estimated  at  38%  for  boys  and  3%  for  girls;  that  for  secondary  education  was \nestimated at 5\u201311% for boys and as low as 1\u20132% for girls. Moreover, 80% of school buildings at \nall levels  were  estimated  to  have  been  damaged  or  destroyed,  as  well  as  all  but  two  of  the \nteacher  training  colleges.  Most  of  the  vocational-technical  facilities  were  either  damaged  or \n\n                                                 \n21  UNESCO EFA 2000 report. \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\ndestroyed.  A  large  number  of  qualified  teachers  fled  the  country  or  were  killed  during the war \nyears and civil turmoil, or took jobs outside of education.   \n \n24. \nAfghanistan\u2019s  economy  is  heavily  based  on  agriculture  (crops,  horticulture,  and \nlivestock).    Indeed,  the  sector  supports  about  85%  of  the  population  and  accounts  for about \n50%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP).  Almost  70%  of  the  labor  force  is  engaged  in \nagriculture.22  Further, agriculture accounted for most merchandise exports and a large share of \nimports (65% and 38%, respectively) in 1999.23Agricultural production has been badly affected \nby  the  protracted  period  of  war  and  civil  turmoil,  population  displacement,  4  years  of  severe \ndrought,  land  loss  through  mines,  dysfunctional  irrigation  systems,  and  degradation  of  natural \nresources  (soil  erosion  from  cultivation  of  steep  hillsides,  stripping  of  brushwood  for  fuel,  and \nreduced land productivity due to the use of animal dung for fuel rather than fertilizer). Less than \n10% of the land or 7.91 million hectares (ha) is arable. About 30% of total arable and permanent \ncropland  was  irrigated  in  1999,  much  of  it  through  community-based  small  and  medium-scale \nirrigation (river valley) schemes. Most of the irrigation facilities are now in serious disrepair, and \nsignificant  parts  are  inaccessible  due  to  land  mines.  In  addition,  large-scale  facilities  exhibit \nmanagement  problems,  waterlogging,  and  salinity  from  overuse.  Substantial  assistance  is \nrequired  to  rehabilitate  the  irrigation  infrastructure  to  revitalize  agriculture.  Wheat  is  the  main \ncrop,  comprising  80%  of  total  grain  production.24  Wheat  production  declined  by  over  50% \nbetween  1998  and  2000,  from  a  relative  high  of  2.83  million  metric  tons  to  1.49  million  tons. \nResurgence  of  poppy  production  signals  the  need  for  a  strategic  approach  of  providing \nopportunities for alternative income sources for poppy farmers and workers, and/or for support \nmeasures by the authorities. Livestock has been a major source of cash income, including the \nsale of dairy items, mutton, wool, animal hides, and the skins of karakul sheep (accounting for \n14%  of  exports).  25  However,  the  4-year drought has reduced herd numbers  by 40% (footnote \n8). Loss of grazing land due to mines has also affected livestock herds. Horticultural production \nand  exports  have  similarly  declined.  In  the  1970s,  horticulture  exports  accounted  for  40%  of \ntotal exports (footnote 8); in 1999 they accounted for about 30%.26 \n \nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n25. \nNeed  for  Appropriate  Policy  and  Institutional  Framework.  It  is  urgent  that  the \ngovernance,  policy,  and  institutional  frameworks  necessary  for  a  well-functioning economy be \nestablished.  This  is  a  necessary  condition  for  significant  investment  in  Afghanistan\u2019s \nreconstruction,  and  to  inspire  confidence  in  private  investors  (domestic  and  foreign)  to \nparticipate in development opportunities. Transparency, accountability, community participation, \nand the rule of law form the basis for good governance, which must be established at all levels \nof government, from the center to the community and local levels. Policy reforms are needed to \nhelp  mobilize  resources  and  to  ensure  these  are  used  productively.  Substantial  institutional \ncapacity building is needed to ensure effective reconstruction and development of the economy \nand social systems. \n \n\n                                                 \n22 Encyclopedia Britannica, Yearbook 2002.

ITGA is committed to fiscal and \n26. \nmonetary  policies  consistent  with  noninflationary  growth  and  macroeconomic  stability.  To \nimprove  revenue  performance  and  expenditure  management,  wide-ranging  policy  and \ninstitutional reforms will be undertaken in budget preparation and execution, domestic resource \nmobilization,  tax  policy  laws,  the  incentive  framework  for  private  investment,  customs \nadministration,  intergovernmental  fiscal  relationships,  rationalization  and  privatization  of  state \nenterprises, and cost recovery and user charges in relevant sectors. The minister of finance has \noutlined  an  ambitious  reform  agenda  across  range  of  issues  including  (i)  revenue  policy, \nadministration, and expenditure management, (ii) budget preparation, (iii) central banking, and \n(iv)  broader  economic  policy  issues  including,  but  not  limited  to,  privatization  and  commercial \nbanking. In the same vein, ITGA  is committed to substantial policy and institutional reforms in \nall  key  sectors  of  the  economy,  including  agriculture,  and  the  social,  transport,  and  energy \nsectors.  ADB  is  working  in  partnership  with  ITGA  and  aid  agencies,  notably  IMF  and  World \nBank,  to  elaborate  the  required  policy  and  institutional  reforms  and  actions.  This  consultation \nand analysis form the basis for providing technical assistance and highly concessional loans to \nhelp meet the adjustment and other costs associated with policy and institutional reforms.   \n \n27. \nNeed  for  Currency  Conversion.  Currency  conversion  is  a  perfect  example  of  the \nreforms  that  must  be  undertaken.  The  Government  issued  on  4  September  2002  a  currency \ndecree authorizing the introduction of a single national currency to replace the multiple Afghani \nnotes  that  are  currently  in  circulation.  A  single  currency  is  a  prerequisite  for  establishing  a \nfunctional  national  payments  system  and  creating  a  sound  basis  for  economic  development. \nThe decree pursues three objectives: (i) improve the credibility of and efficiency of the Afghan \ncurrency  system,  (ii)  convert  the  debt  owed  by  central  and  local  governments,  debt  owed  to \npublic  sector  entities,  as  well  as  debt  owed  by  or  to  DAB,  into  debt  denominated  in  the  new \ncurrency, and (iii) remove from circulation currencies previously issued by authorities other than \nDAB.    Although  envisaged  as  a  transitional  measure  in  lieu  of  an  early  enactment  of  a  new \ncurrency law and a new central bank law, the decree empowers DAB to be the sole issuer of \ncurrency  conversion,  mandates  continuity  of  contractual  relationships,  and  outlines  the \nimplementation  arrangements.  Thus,  what  appears  to  be  a  simple  reform  measure  (however \ndifficult  logistically)  in  fact  has  far-reaching  implications  and  will  ultimately  prove  an  important \ncontributing factor to Afghanistan\u2019s development prospects. \n \n28. \nNeed to Strengthen the Financial Sector.  The transition from subsistence farming to \na modern commercial and diversified economy depends highly on the strength of the financial \nsector.  This is a major challenge to the authorities. Reforms include replacing the 1994 Law on \nMoney  and  Banking  with  a  Central  Bank  Act-Decree  and  Banking  Decree-Law; introducing a \nnew currency; privatizing the commercial banking activities of DAB so as to establishing a two-\ntier  banking  system;  adopting  and  implementing  prudential  regulations;  implementing  an \neffective monitoring and reporting system; establishing modern payments system; and enacting \nlaws on bankruptcy and foreclosure. ADB\u2019s cluster TA addresses some of these requirements, \nbut a great deal more needs to be done to strengthen the sector.    \n \nNeed to Reconstruct Public Administration and Restore the Effective Functioning \n29. \nof the Government Machinery. Significant reconstruction efforts are required to establish basic \nadministrative  procedures  and  systems  of  accountability in the Afghan public service. Data on \nthe  size  of  the  public  sector  are  very  poor,  but  estimates  suggest  about  240,000  with  a  large \nproportion  located  in  Kabul.  Staff  are  unevenly  distributed  and  there  is  an  imbalance  between \nprofessional and administrative staff. Wages and salaries are very low and pensions negligible. \nITGA has started working on (i) improved payroll processes, (ii) building the capacity of staff by \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\nThe \n\nlonger \n\nterm  challenges \n\nfacing  public  administration \n\nrelationships  between  central, \n\nestablishing  capacity  building  groups,  (iii)  a  merit  basis  for  recruitment  and  promotion,  (iv) \nimproving  the  policy  management  process,  (v)  the  pay  and  grading  review,  and  (vi)  improved \nmonitoring of staffing totals.  The ITGA is also considering a new budget planning process. \n \ninclude  defining  and \n30. \nimplementing  sound \nregional,  provincial,  and  district \ngovernments;  creating  a  sustainable  fiscal  management  process  including  issues  concerned \nwith  budget  revenues;  rationalizing  the  role  and  number  of  institutions  and  ministries  and \nretraining  and  reducing  staff  accordingly;  and  providing  a  social  safety  net  that  can  make \nretrenchment of surplus staff feasible. \n \n31. \nOpportunity  to  Strengthen  Public  Consultation  and  Involvement  of  Civil  Society. \nITGA  faces  enormous  challenges  over  the  next  2  years,  as  it  prepares  to  conduct  national \nelections, draft and promulgate a new constitution, train and deploy new national armed forces, \ndemobilize  200,000  faction-based  soldiers,  and  implement  a  multibillion  dollar  reconstruction \nprogram.  In addition, much more needs to be done to nurture national unity and participation by \ncivil society. The ITGA\u2019s attempts to meet these challenges are complicated by the imperatives \nset  forth  by  the  International  Security  Assistance  Force  (ISAF)  and  coalition  forces  in \nAfghanistan, whose concerns for long-term stability and participatory governance appear to be \novershadowed  by  more  immediate  efforts  to  root  out  terrorism.  On  the  brighter  side,  there \nappears  to  be  considerable  interest  in  and  willingness  for  a  more  participatory  process. \nHowever, more needs to be done to nurture national unity and support the emerging civil society \norganizations,  including  NGOs.    Participation  of  these  more  inclusive  institutions  in  public \ndecision-making  processes  is  necessary  to  reinforce  and  decentralize  modern  institutions. \nThere is need to empower communities and strengthen community-based organizations so as \nto develop social and physical capital. At the national level, a gender policy and action plan is \nrequired  to  improve  women\u2019s  access  to  resources  and  services  and  to  ensure  integration  of \ngender  into  community  development  strategies.  Service  delivery  policies  need  to  consider  the \nrole of civil society in providing services and in conducting social audits of services provided by  \nthe government.  \n \n32. \nNeed  to  Rebuild  the  Transport  System  and  Improve  Management  of  the  Sector.  \nITGA  has  declared  that  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of  the  road  system,  especially  of \nnational  roads,  is  the  country\u2019s  top  priority  in  reconstruction.  Improved  roads  will  not  only \nfacilitate  the  physical  and  political  integration  of  Afghanistan  but  also  help  unify  the  significant \ninformal trade and the formal international trade of Afghanistan.  Rebuilding the road network is \nalso  critical  in  facilitating  humanitarian  and  development  assistance.  The  reconstruction  and \nrehabilitation  work  will  be  labor  intensive,  providing  much-needed  employment  and  income \ngeneration.    It  will  contribute  to  social  stability,  by  engaging  among  others  refugees  and  ex-\ncombatants.  Production  and  trade  and  commerce  will  be  promoted,  thereby  expediting \neconomic  recovery  and  growth.  A  strengthened  transport  system  will  serve  regional  interests, \nwith the possibility of reestablishing Afghanistan as a trade hub.  The benefits for Afghanistan \nwould be enormous. Substantial investment will be required to rehabilitate and improve the road \nnetwork  and  to  pursue  a  regional  approach.  To  ensure  effective  use  of  investment  resources \nand to improve the efficiency of the sector, policy and institutional reforms are essential.  These \ninclude  restructuring  the  transport  sector,  promoting  market-based  competition,  introducing \nprivatization  and  commercialization,  improving  governance,  and  encouraging  beneficiary \nparticipation  and  cost  recovery.  MPW  must  draw  on  international  experience  in  engaging  the \nprivate  sector  in  road  construction,  maintenance,  and  management.  There  is  an  important \nopportunity  for  reviving,  developing  and  upscaling  the  domestic  road  construction  industry.   \nThere is also scope for commercializing the road department. As in the case of other taxes and \n\n\f12 \n\nlevies,  toll  collection  on  national  and  provincial  highways  is  irregular,  unsupervised,  and \nunaudited. Further,  much  of  the  revenues  collected  from  tolls  are  not  received  by  the  central \nGovernment.  Such  revenues  should  be  an  important  source  of  funds  for  road  maintenance, \nwhich  has  been  very  substandard.  MOF  proposes  to  take  over  toll  collection  as  a  central \nrevenue item. A modern road asset management system is needed. \n \n33. \nNeed  to  Reform  the  Legal  and  Regulatory  Framework  of  the  Energy  Sector.    To \nfacilitate the growth of the natural gas and electricity subsectors, state enterprises will be made \nmore  efficient  in  preparing  for  the  transition  to  greater  involvement  by  the  private  sector.  The \nPolicy  and  regulatory  functions  of  the  concerned  ministries  must  be  separated,  so  as  to \nminimize conflicts of interest. The legal and regulatory framework will have to be reviewed and \nrevised,  and  gaps  in  the  framework  filled.  Greater  attention  must  be  paid  to  cost  recovery. \nNecessary reforms must be undertaken to promote energy trade. \n \n34. \nOpportunities  for  Regional  Cooperation.  Trade  patterns  indicate  that,  in  1999, \nPakistan accounted for 32.4% of Afghanistan\u2019s exports and 19.2% of its imports. According to a \nWorld  Bank  survey,27  abstracting  from  third-country  trade,  Pakistan  accounted  for  88.2%  of \nexports  and  47.3%  of  imports  in  2000\u20132001,  followed  by  Iran  with  11.3%  and  46%,  and \nTurkmenistan with 0.5% and 6.7%, respectively. Pakistan is obviously the main trading partner \nof Afghanistan. Reexports to Pakistan through unofficial channels are an important component \nof total trade. An open trade regime and other forms of regional cooperation will generate many \nbenefits  for  Afghanistan  and  the  neighboring  countries.    Cooperation  in  road  transport  and \nenergy development will foster regional cooperation in trade. Improved governance is needed to \ncurtail corruption,  which  is  a  serious  nontariff  barrier  to  trade.  Streamlining  of  customs  and \nborder procedures and improving the quality of information are other much needed measures to \nfoster  regional  trade.  Regional  cooperation  in  developing  and  distributing  natural  gas  and \nelectricity has great potential. Iran and Turkmenistan have vast natural gas reserves, and  the \nKyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan have large hydroelectric potential. The possibilities for regional \npower  trade  include  (i)  export  of  power  from  hydroelectric  projects  in  Afghanistan,  (ii) \nresumption of export of natural gas from Afghanistan, (iii) export of natural gas from Iran to India \nvia  Afghanistan  and  Pakistan,  (iv)  export  of  natural  gas  from  Turkmenistan  to  India  via \nAfghanistan  and  Pakistan,  and  (v)  and export of electricity from Turkmenistan to Afghanistan.  \nFurther,  there  is  considerable  scope  for  regional  cooperation  in  water  resource  management, \ngiven that many rivers originate in the Afghan highlands and flow to neighboring countries. The \nheadwater  watersheds  of  the  Indus  and  Amu  Darya  are  in  the  northern  highlands  of \nAfghanistan.  A  beginning  could  be  made  with  meteorological  and  hydrologic  monitoring  and \ndata sharing. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM  \n\n35. \nA program loan of  $150 million is proposed for Afghanistan, with the first tranche to be \ndisbursed  upon  loan  effectiveness,  expected  before  end-2002.    As  discussed  in  the  Initial \nCountry  Strategy  and  Program  for  Afghanistan  (2002\u20132004),  approved  by  ADB\u2019s  Board  of \nDirectors on 28 May 2002, the quick-disbursing nature of a program loan is appropriate, given \nthe need to expedite assistance to the country.  The focus of the program is appropriate, given \nthe importance of policy and institutional reform as a basis for sustained economic growth and \npoverty reduction. The flexible nature of the program loan modality is also appropriate, given the \n\n                                                 \n27 World Bank. 2001. Afghanistan\u2019s International Trade Relations with Neighboring Countries. \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\ndifficulty-of ensuring full compliance with all conditionalities-in light of the problematic nature of \nthe current security situation. \n \n36. \nITGA  not  only  appreciates  the  importance  of  undertaking  far-reaching  policy  and \ninstitutional  reforms,  but  is  in  fact  leading  the  reform  process.  The  proposed  Program  is \nconsistent with the vision and priorities for Afghanistan\u2019s development as expressed in the NDF. \nThe Program supports policy and institutional reforms to improve governance and to strengthen \nthe  financial,  transport,  and  energy  sectors.  Thus,  it  will  contribute  to  economic  recovery  and \ngrowth  within  the  framework  of  a  market-based  system.  The  proposed  reforms  are  aligned \ntherefore  with  Pillar  II  of  the  NDF,  which  calls  for  \u201cexternal  assistance  to  build  the  physical \ninfrastructure that lays the basis for a private sector-led strategy of growth, in such a manner as \nto support the building of human and social capital\u201d; and Pillar III, which calls for the \u201ccreation of \nsustainable growth, where a competitive private sector becomes both the engine of growth and \nthe instrument of social inclusion through the creation of opportunity.\u201d28  In addition, the Program \ncomplements the administrative and financial reform objectives included in the NDF. \n \nProgram  formulation  was  closely  coordinated  with  various  stakeholders.  The  proposed \n37. \nprogram  of  policy  and  institutional  reforms  was  drawn  up  based  on  the  NDF  as   well  as  the \nvarious  assessments  covering  for  the  financial,  transport,  and  energy  sectors,  on  which \nGovernment  officials  worked  closely  with  ADB  staff  who  assisted  in  further  elaborating  of  key \nreforms.    During  a  meeting  at  the  MOF  on  1  September,  the  minister  concurred  with  ADB \nsupport for implementing of necessary reforms in governance and the financial, transport, and \nenergy sectors. The development policy letter of ITGA and the policy matrix are in Appendix 1. \nThe program framework is in Appendix 2. Sector backgrounds are in Appendix 3. The expected \npoverty reduction impact of the program is presented in Appendix 4. The estimated adjustment \ncosts  of  the  program  are  in  Appendix  5.  Appendix  6  lists  the  ineligible  items.  Appendix  7 \npresents  the  development  coordination  matrix.  The  NDF  is  summarized  in  Appendix  8.  The \nsummary  of  the  national  development  budget  is  in  Appendix  9.  Appendix  10  gives  the \nchronology of the PMPL. \n \n38. \nIt will be noted (para. 57) that the adjustment costs of the policy and institutional reforms \nagreed upon in the PMPL policy matrix are expected to be as large as or larger than the loan \namount.  It  is  also  expected  that  the  reforms,  backed  by  ADB  support,  will  prompt  the \nGovernment to invest in the identified sectors \u2014 particularly in the transport and energy sectors. \nThe quick-disbursing nature of the PMPL will enable it to serve as \u201cbridge-financing\u201d for reform-\nrelated adjustment costs, although the loan proceeds may not immediately be used for financing \nthe  adjustments.  The  reforms  and  initiatives  under  the  PMPL  are  envisaged  to  generate \nsubstantial  incremental  benefits,  offsetting  the  adjustment  and  other  costs  associated  with  the \nloan. \n \n39. \nfiscal position is critical.  However, as the minister stated: \n \n\nAs  outlined  by  the  minister  of  finance  in  the  development  policy  letter,  Afghanistan\u2019s \n\n\u201cThe  reform  process  cannot  wait  until  the  fiscal  situation  improves.  On  the  contrary, \nacceleration  of  the  reform  process  is  an  essential  part  of  strengthening  the  fiscal \nposition\u2013both  directly  and  indirectly.    Directly  in  that  reform  of  the  revenue  system  is \ncritical to strengthening the central government\u2019s fiscal position. Indirectly in that reform \n\n                                                 \n28 National Development Framework, Draft for Consultation (Version 2), Kabul. April 2002. \n  \n\n\f14 \n\nof  the  policy  and  regulatory  framework  is  critical  to  creating  a  positive  environment for \nprivate sector enterprise and investment.\u201d \n\n \n40. \nIt is proposed that loan disbursements be phased over an 18-month period through June \n2004,  to  allow  sequencing  of  the  reforms  and  appropriate  pacing  of  the  accompanying \ninvestments and capacity-building initiatives. \n \nA. \n\nObjectives and Scope  \n\n41. \nThe  proposed  program  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  supporting  market-based \npolicy and institutional reforms\u2014fundamental to economic growth\u2014leading to new employment \nand income opportunities throughout the country. The objective of poverty reduction is vital, as \nthe majority of the Afghan people are living below the poverty threshold of $1 per day. But for \nextensive  humanitarian  assistance,  and  now  the  beginning  of  extensive  development \nassistance, famine and other hardship would be widespread.  By helping to improve governance \nand  to  strengthen  sectors  essential  to  economic  recovery,  the  program  will  make  a  major \ncontribution to the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan.   \n \n42. \nThe  Program  draws  extensively  from  the  NDF  and  NDB  and  the  reform  agenda \nprepared  by  the  Government.  With  regard  to  governance,  the  Program  will  address \ntransparency,  budgetary  management  and  revenue  generation,  together  with  measures  to \nstrengthen and rationalize the public service.  With regard to the financial sector, the Program \nwill assist the central bank in becoming fully operational; facilitate the establishment of a modern \ncommercial  banking  system,  including  appropriate  licensing,  regulation,  accounting  and \nsupervision;  and  help  to  establish  a  national  payments  system.  With  regard  to  the  transport \nsector,  the  Program  will  support  the  establishment  of  the  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional \nframework  necessary  for  an  efficient  transport  system,  one  that  maximizes  private  sector \nparticipation  and  cost  recovery.  Program  support  will  also  contribute  to  transparency  and  full \ncommunity  participation  in  planning  and  implementing  transport  investments.  The  program \nfunds are expected to facilitate rehabilitation and reconstruction of national roads. With regard to \nthe  energy  sector,  the  Program  will  support  the  establishment  of  the  legal,  regulatory,  and \ninstitutional  framework  necessary  for  efficient  development  of  the  natural  gas  and  hydropower \nsubsectors.  The  objectives  include  improving  the  domestic  supply  of  energy  and  facilitating \nexport opportunities for natural gas and electricity. The Program will help rationalize the energy \nsector, promote private sector participation, and minimize subsidies to the extent acceptable.  \n \nThe  Program  will  promote  employment  opportunities  for  women  and  other  forms  of \n43. \ngender  equity.  The  Program  will  be  pro-poor  in  that  some  of  the  benefits  of  improved \ngovernance  and  of  strengthening  the  energy,  transport,  and  financial  sectors  will  reach  the \nmajority  of  Afghans  who  are  poor.  It  will  also  assist  in  strengthening  sectors  vital  to  economic \nrecovery in all areas of the country. Further, the Program will contribute to regional stability, for it \nwill encourage regional cooperation in the transport and energy sectors. \n \n44. \nby the Board on 30 May 2002, will support monitoring of the program reform agenda.  \n \n\nAn ongoing $14.5 million TA cluster (TAC) for capacity building in Afghanistan, approved \n\n\f \n\n15 \n\nB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n \n\n1. \n\nImproving Governance and the Financial Sector \n\nReforms  under  this  component  deal  with  four  important  areas  of  concern.  First,  the \n45. \nfinancial  sector  must  be  strengthened  through  market-based  policy  and  institutional  reforms. \nThe starting point is the introduction of a new national currency as a basis for macroeconomic \nstability. In addition, a suitable institutional framework, and proper monetary policy instruments \nwill  need  to  be  evolved.  DAB,  the  central  bank,  is  very  weak  and  strengthening  it  will  require \ntime and substantial assistance.  Progress is not only critical to regaining effective management \nof  monetary  policy  but  also  to  the  credit  operations  of  commercial  and  other  banks,  and  to \nsavings  mobilization  and  general  financial  intermediation.  Reform  measures  will  focus  on \nestablishing  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  efficient  and  effective  operation  of  the \nfinancial  sector.  DAB  will  gradually  divest  its  commercial  banking  functions,  restricting  itself  to \ntraditional  central  bank  roles.  Bank  licensing,  regulation,  and  supervision  will  be  strengthened. \nPrudential  regulations  will  be  introduced,  together  with  internationally  accepted  accounting \nprinciples  and  standards.  Second,  the  financial  system  will  be  improved  by  modernizing the \npayments  system  on  a  suitable  legal  basis  with  the  enactment  of  a  payments  law  and \nestablishment of clearing and settlement facilities for interbank operations. Third, a wide range \nof  budgetary  management  reforms  will  be  undertaken  in  preparing ordinary and development \nbudgets  and  improving  efficiency  and  transparency  in  revenue,  expenditure,  and  other \nbudgetary matters (e.g., debt management and public sector accounting). Finally, improving the \nefficiency and effectiveness of the Afghan civil service is imperative.  A strategy and action plan \nwill  be  prepared  for  designing  and  implementing  a  payroll  system,  and  suitable  checks  and \nbalances  for  the  payroll  in  line  ministries,  departments,  and  provinces  will  be  evolved.  In \naddition, the Civil Service Commission will review government functions in key ministries, and in \nthe financial, transport, and energy sectors; and establish appropriate staffing (or retrenchment) \nand retraining programs for an efficient and effective civil service. \n \n \n\nImproving the Transport and Energy Sectors \n\n2. \n\n46. \nThe  weak  state  of  existing  transport  infrastructure  is  paralleled  by  the  weak  policy  and \ninstitutional framework for the sector. The prolonged period of war and conflict has significantly \nundermined the capacity of key ministries and agencies to develop and implement policies and \nprojects.  The  ministries  concerned  include  MPW,  which  is  responsible  for  implementing  all \ninfrastructure  development  programs;  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT),  which  owns  and  operates \ngovernment-owned trucks and buses and is responsible for assisting and regulating the largely \nprivate-sector-run road transport industry; the Ministry of Rehabilitation and Rural Development \n(MRRD),  which  plans  and  implements  rural  development  projects  including  support  for  rural \nroads;  and  the  Ministry  of  Civil  Aviation  and  Tourism  (MCAT),  which  manages  all  airports  and \nruns  the  government-owned  airline  and  tourism  business.  Lack  of  capable  staff  seriously \nconstrains \nthe  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction of the transport sector. A generation of professional expertise was lost during the \nconflict,  as  most  of  the  capable  and  qualified  staff  left  the  country.  The  small  number  of \nprofessionals  who  stayed  in  Afghanistan  is  reaching  retirement  age.  Due  to  lack  of  additional \ntraining  during  the  conflict  period,  there  is  a  large  gap  in  capacity  that  needs  to  be  filled  by \nrecruiting and training a new generation. \n \nRehabilitating and reconstructing road transport infrastructure and capacity building are \n47. \ntop  priorities  for  the  responsible  ministries.  Other  sector  issues  must  also  be  addressed: \ninstitutional reforms such as merging some responsibilities on functional lines, decentralization, \n\nthese  ministries,  which  are  responsible \n\nleading \n\nfor \n\n\f16 \n\nincreasing  involvement  of  the  private  sector,  introducing  cost  recovery  and  self-financing \nmeasures,  direct  participation  of  beneficiaries/communities \nin  development  activities, \nenvironmental  safeguards  and  ensuring  environmental  considerations  in  all  development \nprojects, safeguards for indigenous peoples and affected ethnic minorities, proper resettlement \nprocedures for project-affected persons, and incorporating gender considerations in developing \ntransport sector projects.  \n \n48. \nThus,  transport  sector  reforms  will  focus  on  (i)  creating  an  enabling  framework  for \nmarket-based  competition  and  efficiency;  (ii)  establishing  efficient,  safe,  and  reliable  transport \nservices  that  meet  gender,  environmental,  and  involuntary  resettlement  objectives;  (iii) \nimproving institutional efficiency and effectiveness of the concerned agencies; (iv) establishing a \nregulatory  framework  for  the  road  transport  subsector;  (v)  introducing  good  governance  in  the \nsector;  (vi)  instituting  cost  recovery  mechanisms;  (vii)  promoting  private  sector participation in \ndeveloping  infrastructure  and  delivering  public  services;  (viii)  establishing  a  system  for \nbeneficiary  participation  in  planning  and  design  of  transport  projects;  and  (ix)  establishing  a \nsystem for national road maintenance and upgrading that will sustain subregional transit traffic. \nAccordingly, a working group will be established to draft a transport sector policy statement for \nthe government to consider. A plan for restructuring transport sector institutions will be finalized \nand  approval  sought  from  the  Government.  In  addition,  the  sector  will  be  restructured, \nseparating  operational  and  regulatory  functions.  Appropriate  guidelines  and  transparent \nprocedures for procurement will be developed. Transparent procedures for regulating transport \noperations  will  be  put  in  place.  A  report  on  existing  road  financing  arrangements  will  be \ncompleted  and  cost  recovery  mechanisms  in  the  sector  will  be  adopted  and  implemented.  A \nlegal and regulatory framework will be developed to encourage private investment in the sector. \nAn  action  plan  will  be  developed  for  the  participation  of  beneficiaries/users  in  public  sector \ntransport projects. A plan for national road maintenance and upgrading will also be developed. \n \n49. \nSimilar  actions  are  planned  for  the  energy  sector.  The  Ministry  of  Water  and  Power \n(MWP)  is  responsible  for  the  electricity  sector  and  development  of  renewable  energy.  Until \nrecently,  MWP  had  about  6,600  staff  positions,  most  of  which  were  vacant.  Some  4,000  staff \nrecently reported back for duty. Da Afghanistan Bresha Moassese (DABM), an enterprise under \nMWP, is responsible for generating, transmitting, distributing, and selling electricity. The serious \nlack of experienced professional staff and poor work facilities prevent MWP/DABM from making \nmuch progress in reconstructing and rehabilitating the electricity sector. MWP is also in need of \nassistance  in  formulating  policies  and  strategies  for  sector  development,  and  for  efficient \nmanagement and human resource development. \n \n50. \nITGA gives high priority to development of natural gas as a major source of energy for \nthe country. Long-term sustainability requires development of natural gas resources on a least-\ncost  basis,  in  an  environmentally  sound  and  socially  acceptable  way.  External  assistance  is \nneeded  in  formulating  policy  and  institutional  reforms  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  energy \nsector, and opportunities for investment and development. \n \nAccordingly,  a  number  of  policy  actions  are  envisaged  for  the  energy  sector. First, to \n51. \ncreate an efficient, safe, reliable, and environmentally sound energy system that meets gender, \nenvironmental,  involuntary  resettlement  objectives,  an  energy  sector  policy  statement  will  be \ndrafted and government approval sought. Second, policy, regulatory, and operational functions \nin the oil and gas sector will be assessed to improve efficiency and minimize potential conflicts \nof  interest,  and  the  relationship  between  MWP  and  power  sector  enterprises  will  be  reviewed \nand their staffing and  skills mix evaluated. Third, a capacity-building plan will be developed and \n\n\f \n\n17 \n\nimplemented at all levels for the ministries and agencies responsible for the sector. Fourth, the \nGovernment  will  begin  preparing  a  master  plan  for  institutional  strengthening  of  MWP  and \nsector  enterprises.  Fifth,  electricity  and  gas  pricing,  billing,  and  collection  operations  will  be \nreviewed to improve cost recovery, and an agreement will be sought to reduce gas subsidies to \nan  acceptable  level.  Sixth,  the  Government  will  prepare  a  policy  statement  on  private \ninvestment  in  oil  and  gas  exploration  and  development  for  consideration.  Finally,  institutional \ncapacity  will  be  created  for  improving  corporate  governance  in  the  petroleum  subsector,  and \nnegotiating  and  monitoring  private  investments  in  exploring  and  developing  oil  and  gas \nresources. \n \nC. \n\nImportant Features \n\nAn important feature of the PMPL is the very high degree of Government ownership of \n52. \nthe policy and institutional reforms included in the Program.  Consultation with the Government \nin formulating the policy matrix has been extensive and maximum effort was made to reflect the \nspecial  circumstances  of  Afghanistan  so  as  to  ensure  a  practical  and  realistic  agenda.  \nConsultation  with  other  aid  agencies  has  also  been  extensive,  especially  with  IMF  and  the \nWorld Bank. The Government is determined that development assistance to Afghanistan will be \nwell  coordinated,  hence  the  emphasis  on  complementarity  of  all  assistance  with  the  NDF  and \nNDB.  The  proposed  conditions  are  designed  such  that  they  reinforce  one  another  as  well  as \nthose  under  the  World  Bank\u2019s  proposed  fiscal  rehabilitation  operation  in  support  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s budget in 2002, supported by a $100 million IDA credit. \n \n53. \nAnother  important  feature  of  the  PMPL  is  its  timeliness.  While  the  Government  has \nhesitated  to  request  loan  assistance  out  of  concern  for  long-term  debt  implications  and  other \nconsiderations, it now recognizes that highly concessional loan assistance should be part of the \nfinancing effort for Afghanistan\u2019s reconstruction. Because of the large grant element embodied \nin  the  PMPL,  it  will  only  marginally  affect  Afghanistan\u2019s  debt  service  burden.    Moreover,  the \nprogram design fully considers the Government\u2019s concern that loan funds be used productively \nand  prudently.  Most  critically,  the  fast-disbursing  nature  of  the  program  responds  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s  request  that  the  international  aid  community  accelerate  the  disbursement  of \npledged assistance to Afghanistan. \n \n54. \nYet  another  important  feature  of  the  PMPL  is  its  flexibility.  The  policy  matrix  is \ndeliberately more adaptable than is typical for program loans. Besides reflecting Afghanistan\u2019s \nextremely difficult circumstances, including increased security concerns, this formulation draws \nfrom ADB\u2019s overall experience with program loans as reported on by the Operations Evaluation \nOffice.  In  the  past,  overly  ambitious  and  numerous  conditionalities  have  contributed  to \ndisappointing program performance.   \n \nFinally, another feature of the PMPL is that it addresses factors fundamental to transition \n55. \nto a more market-based,  modern  economy.    This  objective  was  drawn  to  the  attention  of    the \nBoard Members during Afghanistan\u2019s participation at ADB\u2019 s 35th annual meeting in Shanghai: \n \n\n\u201cThe nation we are endeavoring to rebuild is a modern Afghanistan, consistent with our \nreligious  and  cultural  beliefs.    Our  strategy  is  designed  to  recover  lost  time,  to  put  the \ncountry on a faster development track and place it firmly in the 21st century.  We want \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\nup-to-date  technologies  and  policies  and  programs  in  line  with  regional  requirements \nand global realities.\u201d29 \n\n \n56. \nThe PMPL meets the spirit of this vision.  For example, it supports the introduction of a \nnew national currency and the process of  currency conversion. It also highlights the importance \nof  a  strong  and  independent  central  bank,  while  recognizing  that  a  great  deal  of  reform  and \ncapacity  building  is  needed  before  this  can  be  realized.  Moreover,  the  PMPL  focuses  on  the \ncritical need to create the policy, regulatory, and institutional framework for an efficient banking \nsystem, without which private sector investment and enterprise will flounder. Reform of the civil \nservice  is  another  essential  step  in  securing  the  foundation  for  economic  growth and poverty \nreduction;  hence,  several  program  elements  address  this  reform.  Other  governance  initiatives \ninclude  strengthening  transparency  and  community  participation  in  forming  the  development \nagenda.  Finally, the Program emphasizes and contributes to regional cooperation.    \n \nD. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n57. \nITGA has requested a loan of $150 million from ADB\u2019s Special Fund resources, with the \ninterest  charge  during  the  grace  period  to  be  capitalized  and  charged  to  the  Loan  Account,  to \nsupport  the  proposed  program,  as  described  in  the  development  policy  letter  and  the  policy \nmatrix  (Appendix  1).  The  loan  amount  was  determined  on  the  basis  of  the  adjustment  and \nrelated  costs  of  the  proposed  policy  and  institutional  reforms.  Four  cost  elements  are \nconsidered: (i) costs of compliance with the new legal and regulatory systems and standards, (ii) \ncosts  of  capacity  building,  (iii)  costs  of  enforcement,  and  (iv)  costs  of  price  adjustments. \nAdjustment costs cover technical expert inputs, administrative support, training, compensation, \nbuilding  and  equipment  associated  with  compliance,  capacity  building  and  enforcement.  In \naddition,  costs  of  price  adjustments  have  been  included,  where  appropriate.    The  major  cost \nelements under reforms of governance and finance are costs associated with (i) introducing the \nnew official afghan currency, (ii) implementing the national payments system, (iii) completing a \ndiagnostic review of customs procedures, simplifying customs procedures, and rationalizing the \ncustoms tariff structure, and (iv) enhancing efficiency and effectiveness of the civil service. The \nmajor cost elements under reforms of the transport sector are costs associated with (i) finalizing \na plan for restructuring transport sector institutions, (ii) adopting and implementing cost recovery \nmechanisms  in  the  transport  sector,  which  includes  construction  of  toll  booths  and  weighing \nstations, and (iii) national road reconstruction and maintenance. The major cost elements under \nreforms  of  the  energy  sector  are  costs  associated  with  (i)  improving  the  efficiency  of  sector \nministries  and  institutions,  (ii)  developing  capacity,  (iii)  creating  a  market  framework,  (iv) \npromoting cost recovery, and (v) promoting private sector participation. These and related costs \nare estimated to be at least about $158 million, consisting of the following major cost categories: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\nmarket-based policy and institutional reforms (about $29 million), \nfinancial system reforms (about $17 million), \nfiscal policy reforms (about $9 million), \nimproved institutional efficiency in the transport sector (about $8 million), \nimproved cost recovery in the transport sector (about $14 million), and \nroad rehabilitation and maintenance system (about $62 million). \n\n                                                 \n29 Address to ADB\u2019s Board of Governors, 9 May 2002, by H.E. Hedayat Amin-Arsala, then Minister of Finance, now \n\nVice President of ITGA. \n\n\f \n\n19 \n\nDetails of estimated adjustment costs and underlying assumptions are in Appendix 5. \n\n58. \n \n59. \nThe program loan will have a repayment period of 40 years, including a grace period of \n10 years, and carry an interest rate of 1.0%, with the interest charge during the grace period to \nbe capitalized and  charged  to  the  Loan  Account,  on  an  exceptional  basis.  The  loan  proceeds \nwill  be  available  for  disbursement  in  two  tranches,  upon  satisfactory  compliance  with  agreed-\nupon conditions from the date of loan effectiveness until 31 December 2004. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n60.  MOF will be the Executing Agency for the PMPL and will be responsible for disbursing \nthe loan proceeds, maintaining program records, and ensuring compliance with all policy-related \nconditions.  MOF  will  appoint  a  program  coordinator  and  assign  appropriate  staff  to  assist  in \nmonitoring  and  supervising  program  activities.  MOF,  DAB,  OAA,  Civil  Service  Commission \n(CSC), MPW, MOT, Ministry of Commerce (MOC), Ministry of Mines and Industry (MOMI), and \nMWP  will  be  Im plementing  Agencies  (IAs).  MOF  and  the  IAs  will  assume  responsibility  for \nimplementing  all  conditions  and  program  components  within  their  regulatory  and  development \nmandates. Each IA will appoint a program officer, who will liaise with the program coordinator on \npolicy  decisions  concerning  the  PMPL.  MOF  and  the  IAs  will  liaise  closely  with  consultants \nassigned under the cluster TA for capacity building, which will be utilized to sort out institutional \ndevelopment  and  policy  reform  issues  and  otherwise  to  facilitate  compliance  with  program \nconditions in all sectors. Program implementation will require considerable input from ADB staff, \nwho will backstop program implementation and coordination activities. \n \n61. \nIn addition, a national program steering committee chaired by the minister of finance will \nbe  established  to  provide  program  oversight.  Committee  members  will  be  deputy  ministers  of \nconcerned  ministries.  The  Afghan  Assistance  Coordination  Authority  (AACA)  will  serve  as  the \ncommittee\u2019s  secretary.  The  steering  committee  will  meet  at  least  quarterly  to  review  program \nimplementation  and  to  resolve  interdepartmental  and  other  issues.  The  Program  will  be \nimplemented in close coordination with other aid agencies, especially the World Bank and IMF, \nto avoid duplication and enhance impact.  \n \n \n\nImplementation Period \n\n2. \n\nThe program loan will be implemented within 18 months, starting from the date of loan \n62. \neffectiveness.  The  loan  will  be  released  in  two  tranches  upon  satisfactory  compliance  with \nagreed-upon conditions from the date of loan effectiveness up to 31 December 2002.  \n \n \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n3. \n\n63. \nThe loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange costs of items produced \nand  procured  in  ADB  member  countries  (other  than  items  specified  in  the  negative  list  and \nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources). The Government will certify that the \nvolume  of  eligible  imports  exceeds  the  amount  of  ADB\u2019s  projected  disbursements  under  the \nloan for the given period. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and verify \nthe  accuracy  of  the  Government\u2019s  certification.  The  Government  will  open  an  account  (the \ndeposit  account)  with  a  bank  acceptable  to  the  ADB  into  which  the  loan  proceeds  will  be \ndeposited and through which all withdrawals will be made.  Monthly statements of the deposit \n\n\f20 \n\naccount will be attached to the semiannual report of PMPL implementation to be submitted by \nthe AACA to ADB. \n \n \n\nConsulting Services \n\n4. \n\n64. \nNo  consulting  services  will  be  provided  under  the  Program.  But  because  the  Program \nwill  address  basic  policy  and  institution  reforms  in  governance  and  the  transport,  energy,  and \nfinancial  sectors,  investment  and  capacity  building  in  those  sectors  were  ensured  by  linking \nprogram  monitoring  and  implementation  with  the  activities  of  ADB-funded  advisors  already \nworking  in  the  concerned  ministries  and  departments  under  an  ongoing  TAC  for  capacity \nbuilding.30 Significant progress has been made with recruiting and fielding consultants under the \nTAC.  These  consultants,  together  with  those  financed  by  other  external  funding  agencies,  will \nsupport  ITGA  and  various  ministries  in  securing  compliance  with  first-  and  second-tranche \nconditions of the policy matrix. In particular, technical assistance provided by IMF, Department \nfor International Development, and ADB will help DAB and MOF to comply with the governance \nand finance policy conditions. Policy actions in the transport sector will be facilitated by the TAC \nand technical assistance provided by Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency \nwhile those in the oil and gas subsector will be supported by the TAC. \n \n \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n5. \n\nThe Government will use the local currency counterpart funds generated by the PMPL to \n\n65. \nmeet program expenditures and the adjustment costs of reform. \n \n \n \n\nMonitoring and Tranching \n\n6. \n\nThe loan will be released in two tranches upon satisfactory compliance with the agreed-\n66. \nupon conditions. The first tranche, equivalent to $100 million,  will be made available upon loan \neffectiveness. The second tranche of $50 million will be made available about 12 months later \nupon  satisfactory  compliance  with  agreed-upon  conditions,  as  well  as  continued  compliance \nwith all previous tranche conditions. The conditions for release of the first and second tranches \nare as follows: \n \n \n\na. \n\nConditions for First-Tranche Release \n\ni. \n\nGovernance and the Financial Sector \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nPrepare drafts of a Central Bank Decree-Act and Banking \nDecree-Law,  to  replace  the  1994  Law  on  Money  and \nBanking \nIssue new currency decree \nComplete  preparation  of  a  time-bound  action  plan  for \nphasing out commercial banking activities of DAB. \nPrepare  a  time-bound  action  plan  for  modernizing  the \npayment system  \n\n                                                 \n30   ADB. 2002.

The  Government  will  open  a  deposit  account  in  a  bank \nacceptable  to  the  ADB  into  which  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  deposited  and  through which all \nwithdrawals  will  be  made.    Monthly  statements  of  the  deposit  account  will  be  attached  to  the \nsemiannual report on PMPL implementation that AACA will submit to ADB. \n \n \n\nProgram Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n8. \n\n69. \nADB  will  closely  monitor  the  progress  of  PMPL  implementation  and  the  impact  of  the \nreforms  on  governance  and  finance,  and  the  transport  and  energy  sectors.    The  Government \nand  ADB  will  continue  to  engage  in  active  policy  dialogue  throughout  PMPL  implementation, \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nincluding  additional  reforms  that  may  be  considered  necessary  or  desirable  for  the  sustained \ndevelopment of the concerned sectors.  ADB will also pay close attention to the poverty impact \nof  reforms,  particularly  during  the  transition  phase  between  the  first  and  second  tranches. \nAdequate compensation and fair treatment for workers who seek to retire voluntarily from public \nenterprises will be closely monitored.   \n \n70. \nAACA will be responsible for monitoring progress of implementing the program reforms \nduring 2002\u20132004. Monitoring will involve coordination with the Central Statistical Office, MOF, \nDAB,  and  partner  ministries,  and  support  will  be  mobilized  to  rapidly  develop  information \nsystems  at  central,  provincial,  and  local  levels.  There  are,  however,  serious  capacity  gaps  in \nskills  relating  to  field  surveys,  data  collection  and  analysis,  computer  systems,  management \nfeedback,  and  report  writing.  In  short,  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  carry  out  monitoring  is \nalmost  nonexistent.  In  any  case,  AACA  will  provide  ADB  with  semi-annual  reports  on  PMPL \nimplementation,  in  particular  policy  actions  set  out  in  the  development  policy  letter  and  policy \nmatrix,  and  the  accomplishment  of  objectives  and  purposes.  The  reports  will  be  submitted  in \nsuch  form  and  detail,  as  ADB  may  reasonably  request.    They  must  include  information  on \nprogress made and problems encountered during the period in review, steps taken or proposed \nto  be  taken  to  remedy  problems  encountered,  the  proposed  detailed  activity  for  PMPL \nimplementation,  and  expected  progress  during  the  next  half  year  or  period  of  review.    On \ncompletion of the PMPL, but in any event not later than 6 months after program completion, the \nGovernment will prepare and furnish ADB with a comprehensive report on the overall impact of \nthe policy reforms.   \n \n \n\nProgram Review \n\n9. \n\n71. \nADB  will  field  trimesterly  Program  review  missions.  A  midterm  review  will  take  place  in \nSeptember  2003.  In  addition,  the  Program  Steering  Committee  chaired  by  the  minister  of \nfinance will periodically review the Program. AACA will prepare a summary of the discussions of \nthe steering committee and send the summary to ADB. \n \n \n\nV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n72. \nThe  Program  will  address  governance  and  basic  policy  and  institutional  reforms  in  the \ntransport, energy, and financial sectors. Accordingly, investment and capacity building in these \nsectors will be provided by linking Program monitoring and implementation with the activities of \nADB-funded  advisors  already  working  in  the  concerned  ministries  and  departments under an \nongoing  TAC.31  Grant  cofinancing  to  build  the  capacity  for  monitoring  and  implementing \nProgram reform measures may be considered. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n31 The TA objective is to strengthen policy formulation and programming in different ministries for rehabilitation and \nreconstruction as well as for longer-term development through provision of  long- and short-term advisory services \nand training opportunities. The project will also provide office equipment and supplies  for the effective operation of \nministries and departments. \n\n\f \n\n25 \n\nVI. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\nThe  Program  will  provide  critically  needed  fiscal  support to enable the Government, to \n73. \ncontinue  providing  essential  services  and  rehabilitating  and  reconstructing  the  physical  and \nsocial  capital  of  Afghanistan.  It  will  contribute  to  economic  recovery,  employment  generation, \nhigher productivity, improved per capita incomes, and social stability. Specific beneficiaries are \nhard to identify a priori due to the nature of the Program, but they may include, among others, \nthe  rural  and  urban  poor,  returning  refugees,  IDPs,  demobilized  combatants,  and  women. \nSpecifically,  the  following  benefits  will  be  directly  or  indirectly  attributable  to  different  Program \ncomponents. \n \n74. \nImproved  governance  and  financial  sector  development  will  lead  to  (i)  improved \nefficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  public  sector,  (ii)  improved  resource  mobilization  from \ndomestic  and \nimproved \nmacroeconomic  management  and  payments  system,  (iv)  increased  credibility  in  the  financial \nsector, and (v) development, diversification, and deepening of the financial sector. \n \n75. \nInfrastructure development will lead to (i) improved national road network, (ii) improved \nmaintenance of roads, (iii) increased subregional cooperation and foreign private investment in \nelectricity and natural gas development, and (iv) increased production and distribution of natural \ngas and electricity. \n\nrehabilitation  and \n\nforeign  sources \n\nreconstruction, \n\n(iii) \n\nfor \n\n \nB. \n\n76. \n \n\nRisks \n\n(i) \n\nImplementation of the Program entails a number of risks: \n\nGovernment  commitment  to  the  reform  process  could  weaken.  Despite  recent \npolicy  statements  by  the  President  and  the  minister  of  finance,  other  ministers \nand  senior  officials  may  have  vested  interests  or  opposing  philosophies  on  the \nrole  of  the  Government  and  the  public  sector.  Political  will  to  implement  the \nproposed reforms will be tested in the months ahead. There is also a risk that a \nchange in Government after the national elections scheduled for June 2004 may \nresult  in  a  policy  shift.  However,  the  PMPL  does  not  cover  politically  sensitive \nareas,  and  prospects  for  a  change  in  Government  that  would  significantly  alter \nthe broad macroeconomic and policy orientation appear relatively remote at this \nstage. \n \nThe  overall  political  and  security  situation  remains  volatile,  and  it  is  yet  to  be \nseen  how  much  the  situation  will  improve.  ADB  will need to closely monitor the \nsituation. \n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii)  Weak  implementation  capacity  may  delay  implementation  of  reforms.  ITGA  has \nlimited  capacity  for  planning  and  implementing  even  basic  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction.  In  addition,  there  is  limited  understanding  of  the  policy  and \ninstitutional  reform  process,  and  of  the  importance  of  synchronization  and \nappropriate  phasing.  ADB\u2019s  TAC  will  help  mitigate  this  problem.  MOF  has \nassumed  a  lead  role  in  eliminating  development  constraints  and  bringing  the \nPMPL and other reform programs to fruition. \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\n \n77. \n \nC. \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe macroeconomic and budgetary situation may worsen, causing a diversion of \nfunds  for  meeting  adjustment  and  other  costs  associated  with  the  Program\u2019s \npolicy and institutional reforms. The Government and the international community \nare providing significant levels of relief and rehabilitation assistance for affected \ngroups. The situation needs to be carefully monitored.  \n \nAid  coordination  requirements  are  extensive. The Program was formulated with \nthe  Government,  in  close  consultation  with  the  aid  community,  especially  the \nWorld  Bank,  IMF,  and  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development. \nCoordination needs to be further enhanced during Program implementation. \n\nThe integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs, given the risks. \n\nImpact on Poverty \n\nThe  direct  impact  of  the  Program  is  partially  pro-poor,  provided  the  Government \n78. \nallocates funds made available through the loan for employment-creating investments such as \nrehabilitation  of roads, schools, and irrigation systems. The indirect impact, which will be more \nsubstantive,  will  be  generally  pro-poor  as  the  majority  of  the  population  is  poor.  The  actions \nunder the Program will contribute to institution building for efficient public sector administration \nand policy making conducive to private sector led economic growth, which will naturally reduce \naggregate  poverty.  Indirect  impacts  can  benefit  the  poor  disproportionately  through  improved \naccess to public services, which were previously limited to urban population groups. \n \n79. \nRehabilitation  of  roads  and  other  labor-intensive civil works will create important direct \nshort-term  employment.    Little  is  known  about  the  possible  indirect  short-run impact. Indirect \nmedium-term  impac t  will  include  improved  functioning  of  labor  markets.  Major  groups  affected \nare  unskilled  labor  (directly)  and  entrepreneurs  (indirectly).  Prices  of  goods  and  services  will \nhave positive indirect short-run impact because of stable prices due to macroeconomic stability. \nOver  the  medium  term,  benefits  will  accrue  from  improved  functioning  of  the  goods  markets, \nenhanced productivity, and regained private sector confidence. The economy in general and the \nentire population will benefits from price and macroeconomic stability. This impact will also be \nmagnified in both the short-run and medium-term due to enhanced public sector planning and \nexecution, improved user confidence, and greater public sector-NGO collaboration in delivering \nof  services.  Further  indirect  medium-term  impact  will  accrue  from  improved  security  and \nproperty  rights,  and  improved  access  to  financial  assets.  The  poor,  especially  the  IDPs,  will \nbenefit  from  this  channel.  Over  the  medium  term,  the  poor  will  benefit  from  improved  fiscal \nspace for pro-poor transfers as well as improved room for private transfers. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n27 \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n80. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\nThe  policies  and  actions  taken  before  the  date  of  the  Loan  Agreement  as \ndescribed  in  the  development  policy  letter  and  the  policy  matrix  will  continue  to \nbe in effect for at least the duration of the PMPL. \n \nThe Government will adopt the other policies included in the PMPL and specified \nin the development policy letter and the policy matrix in a timely manner and will \nensure  that  the  policies  and  actions  continue  to  be  in  effect  for  at  least  the \nduration of the PMPL. \n\n \nB. \n\nConditions for Disbursement \n\nThe  loan  will  be  released  in  two  installments  upon  satisfactory  compliance  with \nagreed\u2013upon conditions as specified in the development policy letter and policy \nmatrix. The first tranche, equivalent to $100 million, will be made available upon \nloan  effectiveness.  The  second  tranche  of  $50  million  will  be  made  available \nabout 12 months later upon satisfactory compliance with agreed-upon conditions, \nas well as continued compliance with all previous tranche conditions.   \n \nBefore  submitting  to  ADB  the  first  application  for  withdrawal  from  the  loan \naccount,  the  Government  will  open  a  deposit  account  in  a  bank  acceptable  to \nADB  into  which  loan  proceeds  will  be  deposited  and  through  which  all \nwithdrawals  will  be  made.    Monthly  statements  of  the  deposit  account  will  be \nattached to the semiannual report of PMPL implementation that AACA will submit \nto ADB. \n \nNo  withdrawal  will  be  made  from  the  loan  account  in  respect  of  the  second \ntranche  unless  the  ADB  is  satisfied,  after  consultation  with  MOF,  that  sufficient \nprogress  has  been  achieved  in  carrying  out  the  Program  and,  in  particular,  that \nITGA  has  fulfilled  the  conditions  for  the  release  of  the  second  tranche  as \nspecified in the policy matrix. \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n\n81. \nADB and recommend that the Board approve \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights \n113,496,000  to  Afghanistan  for  the  Postconflict  Multisector  Program,  from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  a  term  of  40  years,  including  a  grace \nperiod of 10 years, an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum, and such \nother terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. In addition, the total \namount of the interest charge during the grace period will be capitalized and \ncharged to the Loan Account; \n\nin  respect  of  such  loan,  a  variation  from  the  existing  loan  terms  under  ADF \nresources on an exceptional basis; and \n\nalso, the variation from the previous ADB practice that all arrears to ADB must \nbe  cleared  before  Board  consideration,  and  instead  that  the  Board  consider \nthe loan conditional on the clearance of arrears.  \n\nTADAO CHINO \nPresident \n\n28 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n18 November 2002 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f        Appendix 1  \n\n29\n\nDevelopment Policy Letter \n\n \n    04 November 2002 \n\n \nMr. Tadao Chino \nPresident \nAsian Development Bank \nManila, Philippines \n \n \nDear Mr. Chino, \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  has  earmarked  $200  million  in  concessional  assistance \n \nfor Afghanistan in 2002 - including $50 million in grants. We are beginning to benefit from ADB\u2019s \ngrant assistance, and I understand that more such assistance will be operational soon.  It is now \nopportune to make ADB\u2019s offered loan assistance operational. \n \n\nOn behalf of the Islamic Transitional Government of Afghanistan, I would like to confirm \nagreement  with  ADB  to  proceed  with  support  for  a  Postconflict  Multisector  Program  Loan, \nwhereby the first tranche will be available later this year. Consistent with ADB\u2019s program lending \nmodality,  the  program  will  facilitate  policy  reforms  of  priority  interest  to  the  Government. \nAccordingly,  the  program  will  address  basic  policy  and  institutional  reforms  in  budgetary \nmanagement  and  in  the  transport,  energy,  and  financial  sectors.  Reforms  in  these  areas  will \ngreatly  contribute  to  Afghanistan\u2019s  recovery  and  reconstruction.  Again  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \nprogram  loan  modality,  provision  will  be  included  for  investment  and  capacity  building \ncomponents  in  each  of  these  sectors,  by  linking  program  monitoring  and  implementation with \nthe  activities  of  ADB-funded  advisors  working  in  concerned  ministries  and  department  under \nTA3874-AFG:  Capacity  Building  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  approved  for  $14.5 \nmillion on 30 May 2002. \n \n \nWith reference to the attached policy matrix, I am pleased to inform you that the agreed \nreforms and accompanying investment and capacity building initiatives reflect the wishes of the \nGovernment,  as  the  representative  of  the  people  of  Afghanistan.  Further,  these  reforms  are \npractical  and  consistent  with  our  National  Development  Framework,  and  will  contribute \nsignificantly to economic growth and poverty reduction.  It follows that we were able to conclude \nnegotiations with ADB officials and finalize a mutually acceptable policy matrix without difficulty. \nExtensive consultation with other donor agencies, notably the International Monetary Fund and \nWorld  Bank,  during  preparation  of  this  policy  matrix  will  ensure  that  ADB  assistance  is  fully \ncomplementary with the Government\u2019s development program and coordinated with the activities \nof our development partners. \n \n \nAs  you  may  be  aware,  the  Government  has  been  reluctant  to  enter  into  loans  for  the \nrehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan. Grant assistance is the much-preferred form of \nassistance, so as to minimize encumbrances on the next generation. At this juncture it is hard \nfor  many  Afghan  people  to  foresee  the  economic  basis  that  would  support  an  increased  debt \nburden.  A  further  consideration  is  the  obligation  of  foreign  governments  to  help  Afghanistan \nrecover  from  a  history  plagued  by  geopolitical  interventions.  These  considerations  were \nreflected in the generous degree of grant assistance included in the $4.5 billion in reconstruction \nassistance  pledged  so  far  by  the  donor  community  to  Afghanistan.  It  is  recognized  that  loan \nassistance \u2013 on highly concessional terms \u2013 is an important component of these pledges. This \nis  especially  the  case  for  ADB,  Islamic  Development  Bank,  and  World  Bank.    Thanks  to  your \n\n\f        Appendix 1 \n\n30\n\nleadership  on  this  issue,  ADF  loan  terms  for  this  Program  were  modified  on  an  exceptional \nbasis,  to  increase  loan  concessionality  and  reduce  any  debt  burden  to  a  more  manageable \nlevel. Your understanding of our situation and support was an important factor in enabling us to \ndevelop  the  necessary  political  consensus  to  borrow  from  the  ADB.    Accordingly,  we  request \nthat ADB fast-track processing of the Postconflict Multisector Program Loan. \n\n \nWe  recommend  an  amount  of  $150  million  on  concessional  ADF  terms,  with \ndisbursements phased over an 18-month period beginning in 2002.  This would allow phasing \nand  sequencing  of  the  reforms,  and  appropriate  pacing  of  the  accompanying  investments  and \ncapacity-building  initiatives.  The  reforms  and  initiatives  we  have  agreed  upon  are  expected  to \nstimulate  growth  and  generate  incremental  benefits  totaling  more  than  $2  billion  over  the  next \ndecade, more than offsetting the adjustment and other costs associated with the program loan. \n \n\nAs  you  well  know,  there  is  great  urgency  in  fast-tracking  international  assistance for \nAfghanistan.  Our  situation  is  extremely  serious,  as  evidenced  by  the  fact  that  the  majority  of \nAfghan people are living below the poverty threshold.  The protracted war and civil turmoil have \nresulted  in  a  devastated  economy  and  badly  strained  national  unity.    Further,  four  years  of \ndrought \u2013 together with land mines and other disruptions \u2013 have cut agricultural production by \nhalf. But for extensive humanitarian assistance, famine would be widespread.  The challenge of \nreconstruction and rehabilitation is being compounded by unexpectedly high numbers of return \nrefugees. \n\n \nOur  efforts  to  respond  have  been  severely  hampered  by  the  Government\u2019s  extremely \nweak fiscal situation.  In April 2002, an Ordinary Budget of $460.3 million was approved, mostly \nfor wages and salaries of public employees (including teachers and health workers).  At the time \nof approval, it was expected that 18 percent of the Ordinary Budget (or $83.0 million) would be \nfinanced  from  domestic  revenues  (mainly  customs  duties)  and  the  rest by foreign assistance.  \nUnfortunately,  in  both  cases  the  expectation  is  proving  difficult  to  meet.  Revenues  have  fallen \nbadly short of target and foreign assistance for ordinary expenditures has fallen far short of what \nis needed to sustain basic government functions. \n\n \nIn addition, the Development Budget must be financed. While not yet finalized, this will \nlikely  exceed  the  Ordinary  Budget  in  financing  requirements  \u2013  which  will  be  100  percent \ndependent on foreign assistance.  It is vital that the Ordinary and Development Budgets be in \nclose  tandem,  so  as  to  avoid  the  current/capital  imbalance  that  so  often  undermines  essential \nservices  and  public  investment  in  developing  countries.    Moreover,  public  sector  operations \nconducted  in  an  effective,  accountable  and  transparent  manner  will  provide  a  sound  basis  for \nfuture development. \n \n \nThe  reform  process  cannot  wait  until  the  fiscal  situation  improves.  On  the  contrary, \nacceleration of the reform process is an essential part of strengthening the fiscal position \u2013 both \ndirectly and indirectly.  Directly in that reform of the revenue system is critical to strengthening \nthe  central  government\u2019s  fiscal  position.  Indirectly  in  that  reform  of  the  policy  and  regulatory \nframework  is  critical  to  creating  a  positive  environment  for  private  sector  enterprise  and \ninvestment.   \n \n\nIn  April  of  this  year,  a  National  Development  Framework  (NDF)  was  formulated  and \npresented at the first meeting of the Afghanistan Reconstruction Implementation Group (IG) in \nKabul. The NDF constitutes  the basis for our reconstruction strategy and presents a vision for a \nprosperous, secure, and self-reliant Afghanistan, setting out strategic directions and overarching \nprinciples  to  guide  all  interventions.  Very  briefly,  our  strategy  has  three  pillars.  These include: \n\n\f        Appendix 1  \n\n31\n\nthe \n\nterrain  underscores \n\nlandlocked  nature  and  difficult \n\nhumanitarian  assistance  and  human  development;  reconstruction  of  infrastructure;  and  the \npivotal role of the private sector.  This last point is important. Our government has decided that \nthe  private  sector  should  be  the  main  engine  of  growth  and  development  in  Afghanistan. \nTherefore, we have drafted and are finalizing a liberal legal framework, which would enable the \nprivate sector to play an active role in the country\u2019s future. The laws will provide investors with \nnecessary  protections,  incentives  and  facilities  to  foster  domestic  and  foreign  investment.  We \nare also adopting a series of macroeconomic policy measures, which will create an environment \nconducive  for  enterprise  development.  Our  hope  is  the  external  private  sector  will  commit  not \nonly to playing a key role in Afghanistan\u2019s reconstruction program, but also to a longer-term and \nbroad-based  role.  Since  becoming  Minister  of  Finance  in  June,  I  have  helped  spearhead  a \nnumber  of  such  macro-  and  micro-economic  reforms  including  budgetary  management  and \nfinancial sector reform. \n \n \nI  should  note  also  that  the  reform  process  is  critical  to  reestablishing  trade  and  other \nforms  of  economic  cooperation  with  neighboring  countries,  and  to  participating  effectively  with \nthe international community more generally. Afghanistan was once a vital land bridge between \nCentral  Asia  and  the  Sub-continent,  and  between  the  East  and  West.    We  want  to  regain  the \nstatus  of  a  vital  trade  partner,  on  modern  terms  consistent  with  our  religious  beliefs  and  our \ntraditions.  Our \nimportance  of \nrehabilitating the country\u2019s national road network. \n \n  \nDecidedly,  Afghanistan  is  at  a  historic  crossroads.  Progress  in  installing  a  progressive \ngovernment  and  stabilizing  the  political  situation  offers  a  window  of  opportunity  to  rebuild  the \neconomy  \u2013  providing  the  basis  for  improved  incomes,  reduced  poverty  and  renewed  national \nunity.  There  are  growing  signs  of  this  improvement  and  renewal  throughout  the  country.  \nBusinesses are springing to life, small and modest but nonetheless helping to give meaning to a \nmarket-based economy. Children are returning to school, and houses are being rebuilt. We are \nrebuilding  our  national  army  and  police  forces,  so  as  to  ensure  stability.  Besides  this being \nessential for the security of Afghan people, it is a necessary condition for effective and efficient \nforeign assistance. \n \n \n I think you will agree with me that Afghanistan has considerable potential. With proper \nwater  resource  management  and  other  elements  of  sustainable  development,  the  agriculture \nsector can be revitalized to its former strength.  Perhaps more than any other factor, this is at \nthe heart of poverty reduction. More than 80 percent of the Afghan people are wholly dependent \non this sector. With guidance on rehabilitation, reconstruction and development of Afghanistan\u2019s \nenergy potential, a current deficit can be converted into a future surplus.  For future growth of \nthe  gas  and  power  sector,  public  sector  enterprises  must  be  made  operational  during  a \ntransitional  phase  as  the  basis  for  greater  private  sector  involvement  is  established. \nAccordingly, policy and regulatory functions of concerned ministries will be separated; legal and \nregulatory  frameworks  will  also  be  developed.  Greater  attention  will  also  be  paid  to  cost \nrecovery  and  administrative  reform  requirements.  The  energy  sector  is  one  area  in  which  the \nneeds and opportunities for economic cooperation are well understood by the countries of the \nsubregion,  and  there  are  strong  incentives  for  cooperation  and  trade.  Finally,  with  the  proper \npolicy  and  regulatory  environment  supported  by  an  efficient  and  effective  financial  system, \nAfghan\u2019s  long-standing  expertise  in  trade  and  small  business  will  reemerge  and  lay  the \nfoundation for modernization and commercialization of the economy. \n \n\nThe  Government  with  ADB  assistance  has  designed  a  reform  program  that  will  move \nthis country forward on a clear path toward sustainable development.  I think you will agree with \nme that Afghanistan\u2019s development framework coincides well with that of ADB. Our top priority \n\n\f        Appendix 1 \n\n32\n\nis poverty reduction, based on a community-based participatory process that identifies how best \nto restructure our education, health, and other essential services. We are committed to an open, \ncompetitive  economy,  where  government  helps  facilitate  private  enterprise  rather  than \nextensively  intervening  in  the  employment  of  productive  resources.  Very  importantly,  our \ngovernment is committed to full transparency and accountability.  As agreed with ADB officials, \nthese principles and views are included in the proposed Postconflict Multisector Program Loan \nfor Afghanistan. \n \nI am pleased to inform you that the Government has initiated significant initiatives over \nthe past several months with respect to policy and institutional reforms at both macroeconomic \nand  sector  levels,  thereby  setting  the  stage  for  undertaking  reconstruction  and  development \nwork within a consistent framework. As a matter of fact, we have been able to achieve all the \nfirst  tranche  conditions  included  in  the  attached  policy  matrix.

 cannot  be  properly  assessed  due  to \nthe  absence  of  reliable  statistics.1  The  1997/98  gross  national  product  (GNP)  is  estimated at \n$6.738  billion,  giving  a  per  capita  GNP  of  $280.2    The  current  level  of  per  capita  GNP  is \nexpected  to  be  down  by  at  least  37%,  which  would  be  about  $182  in  1998  dollars  or  $205  in \n2002 dollars.3 Given the current deteriorated economic base, a rebound in economic growth is \nexpected  in  2002/03.  If  the  short-  and  medium-term  strategies  articulated  in  comprehensive \nneeds  assessment  (CNA)  of  key  sectors  are  implemented  together  with  required  policy  and \ninstitutional reforms, the GNP of Afghanistan could return to the level of 1997/98 by FY2006.   \n\n2. \n\nMonetary Development \n\n2. \nThe  need  assessment  exercises  led  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  United \nNations  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  and  World  Bank  highlighted  the  importance  of  a \nfunctioning central bank, prudent monetary and fiscal policy, and establishment of a payments \nsystem  to  facilitate  transactions  and  other  essential  services  of  the  government  and  other \n\n                                                 \n1    Compilation  of  key  macroeconomic  statistics  such  as  national  accounts,  prices,  labor,  government  finance, \nmonetary and financial statistics, balance of payments, external debt, and trade statistics was discontinued in the \nmid-1990s,  with  the  exception  of  the  consumer  price  index.  An  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  statistics \nmission  to  Kabul  in  April  2002  made  a  number  of  recommendations  to  resume  data  compilation  and  capacity \nbuilding, and an IMF resident statistics advisor was assigned to Kabul in July 2002. Much of the macroeconomic \ndata presented here are ADB staff\u2019 estimates based on best available information as of November 2002.     \n\n2   At the exchange rate of $1=Af4,679 as quoted in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, Yearbook 2002. Country Profile \n\nAfghanistan. Population is estimated at 24.1 million in 2002. \n\n3    ADB  staff  estimate.  The  Gross  Domestic  Product  (GDP)  estimate  was  derived  from  an  estimate  of  wheat \nproduction prepared by the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  (FAO)  and  World  Food  Program  (WFP)  (Special \nReport,  FAO/WFP  Crop  and  Food  Supply  Assessment  Mission  to  Afghanistan,  16  August  2002).  Applying \nrelevant  value  added  and  GDP  sector  coefficients  to  the  value  of  wheat  production,  value  added  in  grain \nproduction was derived, to which GDP sector coefficients were applied to obtain first the estimate of value added \nin agriculture. Total value added (GDP)  in  2002  was  then  estimated  at  about  $4.4  billion.  Adding  an  estimated \n$1.0 billion in net factor income from abroad including transfers, the GNP for 2002 was calculated as $5.4 billion. \nPer capita GNP was estimated as $205 in 2002 in current prices on the basis of a total estimated population of \n26.4  million.  In  1998  prices,  per  capita  GNP  is  placed  at  $182  on  an  assumed  dollar  inflation  rate  of  3%  per \nannum between 1998 and 2002. It is estimated that the per capita GNP in 2002 prices is underestimated by about \n$12-$26  due  to  non-accounting  of  poppy  cultivation  and  by  an  additional  amount  of  about  $2-$2.8  due  to  non-\naccounting  of  illegal  arms  trade.  These  estimates  were  derived  as  follows.  Unaccounted-for  value  added  in \npoppy cultivation: In the late 1990s poppy cultivation covered some 90,000 ha (quoted in Food and Agriculture \nOrganization [FAO] and World Food Program [WFP]. Special Report) producing about 5,000 tons of opium before \nthe Taliban succeeded in imposing a complete ban. Recent revival seems to have covered 1\u20133% of land in some \nprovinces. It is uncertain how much land is now devoted to poppy cultivation. Assuming 90,000 ha has reverted to \npoppy cultivation (unlikely, 40-50% more likely), the estimated value of production at farmgate is in the range of \n$400-$900  million  at  $10,000  per  ha  (figure  quoted  by  Ashraf  Ghani  at  IG  meeting  in  April  in  Kabul). \nCorresponding  value  added  would  be  $280  million-$630  million  (value  added  coefficient  is  assumed  to  be  0.7 \nperhaps a slight overestimation). If we assume that none of it is captured in national accounts statistics, the total \nvalue  added  per  capita  in  2002  would  be  underestimated  by  about  $12\u2013$26.  Weapons:  As  for  weapons, \nlegitimate value-added component is value added in illegal arms trade, which is very difficult to estimate. Trade \nwas 11.3% of GDP in 1993. Illegal arms trade could not have been more than 15-20% of it or 1.7-2.3% of GDP, \nwhich would translate into $2.0\u2013$2.8 per capita in 2002.    \n\n\f40\n\nAppendix 3 \n\nentities. The situation on the ground, however, is different. A functioning monetary policy is not \nyet in place, exchange rates fluctuate widely, and the central bank and commercial banks give \nno  official  interest  rates.  Much  work  needs  to  be  done  to  reform  accounting  for  the  financial \nsector,  bank  supervision,  payments  system,  problems  of  currency  and  liquidity,  foreign \nexchange  management,  and  operationalization  and  modernization  of  the  central  bank  and  the \nbanking  system.  In  the  absence  of  a  stable  monetary  system  and  an  accessible  institutional \ncredit  system,  revival  of  economic  ac tivities  will  remain  problematic.  Farmers  need  short- and \nmedium-term credit to resume agricultural activities, scarcity of working capital will hamper trade \nand commerce, and unavailability of short- and long-term credit will constrain small and medium \nenterprises.  Absence  of  credible  financial  institutions  also  hamper  savings  mobilization  and \nfinancial intermediation. The capital market is undeveloped and modern savings and investment \ninstruments are almost nonexistent. Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) operates with 89 branches, of \nwhich 20 are destroyed and 14 are nonoperational. There are also six banking institutions (two \ncommercial banks, a trade finance bank, an agriculture development bank, a housing bank, and \nan  industry  bank),  none  of  which  is  reported  to  perform  any  intermediation  functions. \nAfghanistan  will  move  away  soon  from  the  current  multiple  currency  system  to  a  unique \ncurrency  that  would  have  public  confidence  and  maintain  a  stable  value  internally  and \nexternally.  Liquidity needs of the economy will have to be assessed and decisions taken with \nregard  to  the  price  of  money  (i.e.,  interest  rate)  and  the  external  value  of  money  (i.e.,  the \nexchange rate). In principle, the central bank can set the base rate, but allows market forces to \ndetermine lending rates to various sectors and individuals. On the exchange rate, a free-floating \nexchange rate regime that worked well in the past has been adopted. \n\n3. \nThe  agricultural  development  bank  is  not  lending  now,  as  it  has  no  stocks  of  input  or \nequipment; it is burdened with large loan arrears, much of which is not recoverable; and the real \nvalue of loans was reduced by inflation and currency depreciation. The informal credit market, \nwhich  has  been  operating  through  friends  and  relatives,  landowners,  shopkeepers,  and \nmoneylenders,  is  the  main  provider  of  financial  services.  For  poor  farmers,  wheat/opium  had \nbeen  a  good  basis  for  obtaining  credit  from  moneylenders  and  shopkeepers.  Reviving  the \nfinancial  sector,  making  the  central  bank  operational,  restoring  confidence  in  the  financial \nsystem,  and  opening  up  lines  of  credit  for  farmers,  other  producers,  traders  and  other \ncommercial operators are matters of high priority. In due course, Afghanistan will also have to \nconsider  opening  up  the  financial  market  to  foreign  banks  and,  insurance  and  finance \ncompanies. \n\n4. \nDAB,  the  central  bank  for  the  country,  is  responsible  for  monetary  policy.  During  the \nTaliban regime, the central government was not involved at all in the printing of money, as the \nRussian  company  responsible  did  not  deliver  it  to  DAB.  The  (ATA)  has  now  given  DAB  full \nauthority over issuance of currency. DAB has decided to completely change afghani banknotes, \nwithdraw the existing banknotes issued by various sources, and introduce new banknotes with \nmuch  higher  security  features.  It  remains  to  be  seen  how  quickly  this  can  be  done.  The \nissuance of new unified banknotes is being discretely planned to avoid speculative actions. To \nextend control over the currency, DAB will encourage foreign exchange transactions through the \nbanking  system  and  will  be  involved  in  auctioning  of  foreign  exchange  to  ensure  that  money \ncreation  is  limited  by  the  holding  of  foreign  exchange  reserves  at  DAB.  According  to  the  IMF, \nthe increase in money supply over the first quarter is consistent with the government\u2019s target of \nlimiting  12-month  inflation  to  18%.  Formulating  and  implementing  of  a  monetary  policy  are \ndifficult without a functioning and modernized banking system. DAB is not yet fully operational \nand  commercial,  and  other  banks  are  much  less  so.  The  country  depends  on  the  traditional \nhawala system for money transfer, the only effective payment system in place, and the informal \ncredit market meets the demand for liquidity. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n41\n\nThe  National  Development  Framework  highlights  the  importance  of  establishing  a \n5. \ncentral  monetary  authority  for  monetary  control,  payments  system,  and  banking  supervision; \nand  establishing  a  commercial  banking  system.  For  the  medium-  to  longer-term,  attention  is \ndrawn to microfinance, rural finance, and small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME) credit and \nleasing.  A  legal  framework  for  banking  will  be  required.  While  a  banking  law  is  being  drafted, \nemergency  banking  regulations  will  have  to  be  issued.  For  microfinance,  experience  of \nnongovernmental  organizations  (NGOs)  is  positive  in  the  country  and  internationally,  a  wide \nrange of options are available, of which the most suitable need to be adapted for Afghanistan. \nStreamlining the operations of the existing banks and inviting foreign joint ventures can revive \ncommercial banking. Agricultural credit can be provided by a restructured ADB as well as a rural \nbank.  The  latter  can  also  finance  nonagricultural  activities  in  rural  areas.  Examples  can  be \ndrawn  from  the  Bank  of  Agriculture  and  Agricultural  Cooperatives  of  Thailand  and  the  Bank \nRayat  Indonesia.  Growth  of  private  banking  with  possible  support  of  the  International  Finance \nCorporation  (IFC)  can  fill  the  credit  need  of  SMEs.  Banks  as  well  as  leasing  companies  can \nhandle leasing.  Financial, institutional, and economic sustainability need to be addressed in all \ncases.  To  initiate  any  of  these  efforts,  external  technical  support  will  be  required  since  local \ncapacity is limited or nonexistent. \n\n3. \n\nInflation \n\nConsumer  prices  increased  by  68.9%  between  1994  and  1998,  giving  an  annual \n6. \ncompound  rate  of  inflation  of  14%.4  Most  recently,  measured  by  the  available  Kabul-based \nconsumer  price  index  (CPI)  produced  by  the  Central  Statistical  Office  (CSO),  the  months \nfollowing the ouster of the Taliban saw a sharp deflation reflecting the appreciation of afghani, \nfollowed by a sharp inflation in the first quarter of 2002, and then followed by a fairly stable price \nincrease  in  the  second  quarter  of  2002  at  1%  monthly,  well  below  the  4.5%  envisaged in the \nmonetary program.5  \n\n4. \n\nExchange Rate  \n\n7. \nThe  official  exchange  rate  of  Af45:$1  set  in  1963  was  adjusted  to  Af3,000:$1  in  April \n1996,  reflecting  among\u2014other  factors\u2014weakening  of  monetary  discipline  under  the  Jamiat \nregime.  During  the  late  1990s,  further  depreciation  of  the  currency  occurred  as  a  result  of \nmarket  forces.  BY  2000,  the  foreign  exchange  market  became  more  fragmented  and  volatile, \nwith  wide  divergence  between  official,  spot,  and  black  market  rates  and  also  between  Taliban \nand  opposition-controlled  areas.  By  September  2001  the  rate  had  depreciated  to  Af79,000. \nFollowing the start of the war on terrorism in Afghanistan, the currency appreciated significantly, \nto under Af30,000:$1 by December 2001. Since then, the afghani has weakened to Af35,000\u2013\nAf40,000 to the dollar. By September 2002, the exchange rate plunged to Af58,000 or lower, as \na  result  of  the  announcement  that  the  Government  would  introduce  a  new  currency.6  An \nupsurge in violence also exacerbated exchange rate volatility. \n\n                                                 \n4    University of Nebraska, UN-Omaha Afghanistan Atlas Project. \n5    Information obtained from IMF mission visiting Kabul.  \n6    On the evening of 4 September, President Hamid Karzai announced a new currency.  The new currency will still \nbe  called  the  afghani,  but  each  new  afghani  will  be  worth  1,000  old  ones.    The  operation  will  remove  from \ncirculation  an  inflated  currency  that  has  been  cumbersome  to  use,  requiring  an  excessive  number  of  notes  for \nmost transactions.  The operation to exchange the old notes for new ones is expected to take about 2 months.  \nIMF issued a statement following the President's announcement, saying: \"The authorities' decision to introduce a \nnew  currency  is  an  important  step  in  their  efforts  to  establish  macroeconomic  stability  and  to  create  an \nenvironment that is conducive to restoring sustainable economic growth in Afghanistan.  The new afghani will be a \n\n\f42\n\nAppendix 3 \n\n5. \n\nFiscal Development \n\n8. \nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF) needs to quickly develop adequate capacity to formulate \nand  implement  a  responsible  fiscal  policy  through  a  comprehensive  and  unified  government \nbudget. Policies on the mobilization of domestic and external resources as well as expenditure \npolicies  need  to  be  clearly  laid  out.  Old  sources  of  tax  and  nontax  revenue  need  to  be \nstreamlined and new sources of revenue conceived. An efficient tax administration system must \nalso  be  put  in  place.  The  central  Government  does  not  collect  much  in  the  form  of  domestic \nrevenues at present.  For the most part, provincial governments retain the amounts collected on \nborder  trade.  On  the  expenditure  side,  an  early  review  of  expenditure  policies  will  make \ngovernment  recurrent  expenditures  manageable  and  investment  expenditures  productive  and \nsustainable. During the first years, inevitably the budget will have large deficits, which have to \nbe  covered  through  domestic  borrowing  and  foreign  loans  and  grants.  The  international \ncommunity is prepared to transfer a considerable amount of resources on a grant basis, but the \ncountry must also be prepared to borrow to jump-start the reconstruction process. \n\nOn  6  April  2002,  the  Afghanistan  Interim  Administration  (AIA)  adopted  an  ordinary \n9. \nbudget  for  FY2003  of  $460.3  million.7  A  development  budget,  essentially  a  list  of  aid-funded \ninvestment projects - which covers both FY03 and FY04  \u2013 was presented in October 2002 and \nis  estimated  at  about  $3.2  billion.8  The  Government  projected  $83  million  or  18%  of  total \nrecurrent  expenditures  in  the  ordinary  budget  will  be  covered  by  domestic  revenue,  while  the \nremaining  80%  would  be  financed  by  external  assistance.9  According  to  a  report  prepared  by \nMOF in October,10 domestic revenues in the first quarter amounted to $22.7 million (mainly from \ncustoms  duties)  against  planned  revenues  of  $16  million;  however,  transmittal  of  revenues  by \nprovincial  offices  to  the  central  Government  and  foreign  assistance  for  recurrent  expenditures \nhave fallen short of expectations. In addition, $285.4 million in grants from multilateral (e.g., AIA \nand Land and Order Trust Funds of the UNDP and the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund \n[ARTF] comanaged by ADB) and bilateral sources11 are expected, against the required $377.3 \nmillion. It follows that the revised budget for FY2003 (Table A3.1) includes a net financing gap of \n$91.9 million. A fiscal crisis has so far been avoided; however, this is expected to change in the \ncoming  months  and  financial  resources  are  urgently  needed.  The  World  Bank  is  processing \ndirect  recurrent  budget  support  of  $100  million  through  its  International  Development \nAssociation  (IDA)  resources.  While  the  development  budget  will  need  to  be  largely  foreign-\nfinanced in the foreseeable future, the ordinary budget will eventually be financed from domestic \nrevenues. As the authority of the central Government extends over the entire country, revenue \ncollections from both direct and indirect sources should increase substantially.  \n\n                                                 \n\nsymbol of national sovereignty and unity. The authorities fully recognize that the outlook for the currency will to a \nlarge extent depend on the fiscal and financial policies of the government, and the Fund welcomes the authorities' \ndemonstrated commitment to implement sound fiscal and monetary policies. The introduction of a new currency is \na  major  operation  with  numerous  logistical  challenges  to  overcome.  Preparations  for  the  change-over are well \nunderway.\" \n\n7    The Fiscal year starts on 21 March.  FY2003 refers to 21 March 2002\u201320 March 2003.  \n8    The  Ministry  of  Finance  presented  a  draft  national  development  budget  totaling  $3.18  billion  covering  2  fiscal \nyears   \u2013  SY  1381  and  1382  (22  March 2002 to 21 March 2004)  - at a meeting of the Implementation Group in \nKabul on 12-13 October 2002. \n\n9     Assumed exchange rate is Af34,000=$1. \n10    Ministry  of  Finance,  Islamic  Transitional  Government  of  Afghanistan  2002.

Official  capital  transfers  and  unofficial  transactions  (e.g.,  the  drug  trade) \nfinanced  the  gap.  According  to  a  survey  sponsored  by  the  World  Bank,12  Afghanistan\u2019s  total \n\n                                                 \n\n12 World Bank, 2001, \u201cAfghanistan\u2019s International Trade Relations with Neighboring Countries 2001.\u201d \n\n\f44\n\nAppendix 3 \n\ntrade in 2000 was 2.5 billion, comprising $1.2 billion in imports and $1.2 billion in exports, most \nof  which  comprised  reexports.  Trade  has  since  fallen  sharply,  except  for  emergency  food  aid \nand other imports and perhaps exports of opium. The Afghanistan Interim Administration (AIA) \nand Islamic Transitional Government of Afghanistan (ITGA) have extended the Taliban-imposed \nban on poppy cultivation and opium production and eliminated $8 billion worth of drugs, the ban \nhas been difficult to enforce and poppy cultivation has reportedly picked up once again from 74 \ntons  in  2001  to  2,952  tons  in  2002,  up  from  74  tons  in  2001.  Reported  collections  of  customs \nduties gives an insight into the level of imports. In the first quarter of 2002, customs collections \nwere about $20 million, which implies an annual official import volume of at least $600 million, \nassuming an average tariff of 20% and coverage rate of 67%. Imports are likely to grow at the \nrate of 15\u201320% annually over the next few years, but exports will likely grow more slowly.   \n \n \n \n\nExternal Debt13 \n\n7. \n\n12. \nArrears to the IFIs total  about  $54  million  (i.e.,  IDA  at  about  $27  million,  ADB  at  about \n$17 million, and IMF at about $10 million). Once these arrears are cleared, outstanding debts to \nthe IFIs of  about $86 will be serviced  - about $70 million to IDA and $15.8 million to ADB. IMF  \ndoes  not  have  any  outstanding  debt  after  arrears  are  cleared.  However,  the  data  on  debt  to \nbilateral creditors are very sketchy. The total debt to Paris Club members (excluding Russia) is \nestimated  at  about  US$473  million.  Outstanding  Russian  loans  amount  to  $5.9  billion  as  of \n1991, valued at one-to-one with the US dollar. After including the outstanding balance (deficit) of \nAfghanistan\u2019s bilateral payments agreements as of 1991, total debt owed to Russia amounts to \nRubles 6.6 billion. Under the agreement on Russia\u2019s participation in the Paris Club as a creditor, \nAfghanistan  would  be  eligible  for  an  upfront  discount  of  80  percent  prior  to  any  future \nconcessional rescheduling. Other than these information, given the very weak database and the \nconsiderable  uncertainties  about  economic  prospects,  as  well  as  the  absence  of  the  precise \nforesight  on  how  the  existing  debt  might  be  rescheduled  or  forgiven,  the  debt  sustainability \nanalysis  is  very  difficult.  The  results  depend  very  much  on  the  assumptions  made  on \nmacroeconomic  scenarios  and  debt  rescheduling  arrangements.  While  precise  conclusions \ncannot be drawn from the preliminary analysis, general implications are: (i) the achievement of \ndebt  sustainability  will  probably  require  debt  relief  that  goes  beyond  the  normal terms of debt \nrestructuring; (ii) the debt indicators appear to worsen in the initial period, the duration of which \ndepends  on  the  macro  scenario,  before  they  start  to  show  a  robust  improving  trend,  and  (iii) \ndebt sustainability is very sensitive to positive or negative shocks to output and export growth. \nThe  macroeconomic  situation  needs  close  monitoring  over  the  medium  term  before  it  can  be \nsaid  with  any  degree  of  certainty  that  the  Afghan  economy  is  on  the  desired  path.  Of  course, \nstability  in  the  security  situation  and  Government  commitment  to  sound  macroeconomic \nmanagement are prerequisites to debt sustainability. \n\n                                                 \n13  Based on the latest ADB staff analysis with inputs from IMF staff reflected. Work is underway by IMF staff on the \nsustainability of Afghanistan\u2019s debt. In this work the implications of different scenarios are being explored regarding \nthe  extent  of  debt  relief,  the  mix  of  external  financial  assistance  (nonconcessional  and  concessional,  including \ngrants),  the  quality  of  economic  policies  and  their  implementation,  and  different  growth  and  exports  assumptions. \nAlthough  this  work  is  at  a  preliminary  stage,  the  early  implications  are  that  given  the  initial  level  of  Afghanistan\u2019s \nexternal debt, the achievement of debt sustainability will depend importantly on positive policy and growth outcomes \nand the extent of concessional financing. \n\n\f \n\nB. \n\nInfrastructure \n\n1. \n\nTransport \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n45\n\nRoad transport plays a major role in delivering humanitarian aid, facilitates the return of \n13. \nrefugees and necessary imports, and is vital for the economic recovery of the country. However, \nmore than two decades of conflict combined with continued lack of maintenance has resulted in \ndamage  to  the  road  infrastructure  including  critical  structures  and  bridges  and  the  2.8  km \nSalang tunnel that provides vital access to the northern parts of the country.  Overall, the road \nnetwork has been rendered only partly usable, and that too at a significantly high transportation \ncost.    The  prolonged  state  of  conflict  has  also  resulted  in  large-scale  deterioration  of  the  civil \naviation  infrastructure.  In  addition  to  lack  of  maintenance,  heavy  damage  inflicted  during  the \nrecent military operations further accelerated deterioration. \n\n14. \nAfghanistan,  as  a  landlocked  country,  relies  on  surface  and  air  transport.  The  road \nnetwork (Table A3.2) comprises about 6,000 kilometers (km) of national roads, of which 3,300 \nkm  are  primary  highways  including  2,400  km  roads  that  were  originally  paved.  The  national \nprimary  road  network  consists  largely  of  the  ring  road  (Kandahar\u2013Kabul\u2013Mazar-e-Sharif\u2013 \nSheberghan\u2013Meymaneh\u2013Herat)  and  the  six  international  links14  to  neighboring  countries.  The \n615-km  Sheberghan-Herat  section  of  the  ring  road  is  only  partly  constructed  and  is  generally \nunpaved. The remaining network comprising 2,700 km of secondary national roads and 15,000 \nkm provincial roads has either gravel or earthen surface. The coverage and condition details of \nthe tertiary road network consisting of village access roads are not known,15 except that these \nroads are all unpaved. Though the road density of 0.03 km of road per square km and 0.88 km \nper thousand people is far lower than in most developing countries, the road network touches all \nthe  major  population  centers  and  reaches  to  a  certain  extent  the  remote  areas.  During  the \npreconflict  period,  the  recorded  traffic  on  the  primary  network  varied  between  250  and  1,000 \nvehicles per day. Recent field visits have confirmed that the traffic levels were improving and in \nsome cases exceed these figures. Based on a recent survey of some sections of the network, \nthe road conditions have further deteriorated, with the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) still in a \nstate  of  flux  due  to  lack  of  clear  terms  of  reference  of  staff,  little  activity  is  undertaken except \nwhat  is  carried  out  by  the  maintenance  division.  The  ministry  is  clearly  overstaffed  and  the \nfinancial and asset management system is in virtual disarray. \n\n \nTable A3.2: Major Road Network \n\nRoad Classification \n\nNational Primary \nNational Secondary \n\nProvince Primary \nProvince Secondary \n\nSubtotal \n\nSubtotal \nTotal \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLength (km) \n\n3,280 \n2,785 \n6,065 \n8,882 \n6,043 \n14,925 \n20,990 \n\nSource:  Asian Development Bank, United Nations Development Programme, and World Bank,  \n\n     August 2002, Comprehensive Needs  Assessment, Transport Sector, Draft Final Report. \n\n                                                 \n14  The international links are to Iran (1), Pakistan (2), Tajikistan (1), Turkmenistan (1), and Uzbekistan (1).  \n15  According to rough estimates, this is about 15,000 to 20,000 km. \n\n\f46\n\nAppendix 3 \n\nOnly  26%  of  the  national  roads  are  in  fair  condition;  national  roads  in  poor  condition \n15. \nhave  increased  to  54%.  Large  sections  of  roads  in  the  southeast  (Kabul-Kandahar) and east \n(Kabul\u2013Jalalabad\u2013Torkham) have been lost. The concrete road from the southeast to the west \n(Kandahar\u2013Herat\u2013Torghundi)  is  only  partly  traffic-worthy  due  to  joint  failures  and  other \ndamages. Only the road to the north (Kabul\u2013Pol-e-Khomri\u2013Konduz\u2013Mazar-e-Sharif) is generally \nin a better condition after the Salang pass.  Between Kabul and the Salang tunnel, 13 bridges \nrequire  replacement,  as  well  as  reconstruction  on  some  sections  and  deep  patching  and \nstrengthening  on  other  sections.  The  Salang  tunnel  at  3,300-meter  elevation  is  a  major \nconstraint, as the tunnel, interior road, and snow gallery are badly damaged and usable only for \none-way traffic over a 10 km section.  \n\n16. \nThough the pavement structure has been severely damaged, the road embankment has \nheld  up  reasonably  well  despite  two  decades  of  civil  war  and  neglect.    The  effect  of  recent \nmilitary actions is most pronounced in the form of damaged and destroyed bridges.16 Some road \nimprovement  activities  undertaken  during  the  Taliban  period  (1996-2001)  include  asphalt \noverlay  of  a  50  km  section  of  the  Kabul\u2013Kandahar road beginning from the outskirts of Kabul \ncity.  Although  all  50  km  received  base  course,  the  wearing  course  could  only  be  applied  to \nsome  40  km.  Similarly  about  195  km  of  the  concrete  Kandahar\u2013Herat road  was repaired by \nsealing  the  transverse  cracks  to  provide  a  smoother  surface.  It  was  noted  that  enterprising \ntransporter  were  doing  patching  and  minor  repairs  works  to  reduce  vehicle  operating  costs  in \nthe  absence  of  any  Government-financed  initiative,  particularly  on  the  Kandahar\u2013Spin Boldak \nroad (an important transport artery that leads from Kandahar to the border with Pakistan). \n\n17. \nRoad  conditions  are  perhaps  best  reflected  in  travel  time.  During  field  visits  in  March-\nApril 2002, data was collected on actual travel time taken by a four-wheel drive vehicle on major \nroad sections (Table A3.3).  \n\nTable A3.3: Travel Time on Primary Road Network \n\nLength \n(km) \n\nTravel Time \n(hours) \n\nAverage \nSpeed (km/hr) \n\n \n\nRoad \n\nKabul-Torkham \n\nKabul-Kandahar \n\nKandahar-Spin Boldak \n\nKandahar \u2013 Herat \n\nKabul- Mazar-e-Sharif \n\nMazar-e-Sharif-Heraitan \n\n227 \n\n506 \n\n105 \n\n560 \n\n399 \n\n57 \n\n164 \n\n6.5 \n\n20 \n\n2.5 \n\n8.5 \n\n15 \n\n2 \n\n12 \n\n35 \n\n25 \n\n42 \n\n64 \n\n27 \n\n38 \n\n14 \n\nPol-e Khomri-Shir Khan Bandar \n\n \n          Source: Asian Development Bank, United Nations Development Programme, and World Bank, August 2002. \n          Comprehensive Needs Assessment, Transport Sector, Draft Final Report. \n\n \n\n \n\n18.  The two decades of conflict has affected not only infrastructure, but also the institutions \nwhose  capacity  to  evolve  and  enforce  policies  and  to  develop  and  implement  projects  have \ninfrastructure \nbeen  significantly  depleted. \n\ninclude  MPW  which \n\nimplements  all \n\n  They \n\n                                                 \n16  For example, 11 bridges have been damaged on Road Kabul-Mazar-e-Sharif, 1 on Road Kabul-Torkham, and 2 \n\non Kandahar-Spin Boldak. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n47\n\ndevelopment  programs;  Ministry  of  Transport  (MOT),  which  runs  the  government-owned \nvehicles  and  is  responsible  for  assisting  and  regulating  the  largely  private-sector-run  road \ntransport industry; Ministry of Rehabilitation and Rural Development (MRRD), which plans and \nimplements rural development projects including rural roads; and Ministry of Civil Aviation and \nTourism  (MCAT),  which  manages  all  airports  and  runs  the  government-owned  airline  and \ntourism  business.  Lack  of  capable  staff  seriously  constrains  these  institutions,  which  are \nresponsible  for  leading  the  recovery  and  reconstruction  efforts  in  the  transport  sector.    A \ngeneration  of  professional  expertise  was  lost  during  the  conflict  period,  as  most  of  the \nknowledgeable  staff  left  the  country,  and  the  few  who  stayed  are  reaching  retirement  age.   \nBecause  no  trained  human  resources  were  added  during  this  period,  a  large  gap  in  capacity \nneeds to be filled by recruiting and training the younger generation. \n \n19.  As  for  the  role  of  the  private  sector,  a  number  of  Afghan  road  contractors,  transporters, \nand equipment suppliers have relocated to neighboring Pakistan and Iran over the past decade \nas  a  consequence  of  the  prolonged  state  of  conflict,  where  they  continue  to  pursue  their \nrespective business activities. Some 24 small Afghan road construction contractors17 operate in \nthose two countries, but are now keen to return to Afghanistan in view of the potential for major \ndevelopment  activities.    However,  their  equipment  capabilities  are  limited,  and  they  will  need \naccess  to  financing  and  capacity  building  in  contract  management  to  gradually  take  up  major \nroad construction contracts directly.  Since the beginning of 2002, several of these contractors \nhave  returned  and  established  offices  in  Afghanistan  in  anticipation  of  the  upcoming \ndevelopment activities.  \n\n2. \n\nEnergy \n\n20. \nGas. The energy sector is underdeveloped and much of the available capacity has been \ndestroyed. Sales of electricity and natural gas have plummeted. Gas production is now minimal. \nAfghanistan\u2019s proven and probable gas reserve was placed at 5 trillion cubic feet in the 1970s.18 \nFrom a peak of 275 million cubic feet per day (MMCf/d) in the 1970s, output gradually declined \nto 220 MMCf/d in the 1980s due to declining reserves from producing fields. In the late 1970s \nAfghanistan  exported  70-90%  of  its  natural  gas  output  to  the  Soviet  Union,  but  exports  were \ndiscontinued in late 1980s. Gas infrastructure needs to be rehabilitated and upgraded, including \nwells in the Sheberghan area19 and pipeline to Mazar-e-Sharif and new pipeline to Kabul. This is \na  sector  with  very  high  potential  for  the  future  growth  of  the  Afghan  economy.  Afghanistan  is \nalso strategically located as the transit route for oil and gas export pipelines from central Asia to \nIndia and the Arabian Sea.   \n\n21. \nElectricity.  In  the  power  sector,  the  current  peak  demand  of  130  megawatts  (MW)  for \nelectricity in Kabul is largely unmet, as was the 1996 demand of 250 MW. War damage, looting, \nand  lack  of  spare  parts  and  maintenance  have  seriously  hampered  power  production  and \ndistribution.  Lack  of  funds  makes  it  difficult  to  procure  supplies.  It  is  estimated  that  power-\ngenerating  capacity  declined  from  377  MW  in  the  early  1990s  to  the  current  240  MW.  The \ncapacity  needs  urgent  upgrading.  Hydroelectric  dams  are  important  sources  of  power  supply. \nDrought-related  water  shortage  affected  power  supply  in  recent  years,  including  in  the  main \nplants  at  Naghlu  and  Sarobi.  Important  dams  include  the  Kajakai  Dam  in  Helmand  Province \n\n                                                 \n17  With an average annual turnover of about $1 million each, these contractors are mostly working as subcontractors \nfor civil work activities related to earthworks, aggregate and equipment supply, and some base course and sub-\nbase course works. \n\n18  U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration, September 2001. \n19  The Jorqaduk, Khowaja Gogerak, and Yatimtaq gas fields are all located within 20 miles of Sheberghan. \n\n\f48\n\nAppendix 3 \n\nnear  Kandahar  (49.5  MW),  Mahipar  Dam  (66  MW),  and  Breshna-Kot  Dam  in  Nangarhar \nProvince  near  Jalalabad,  and  the  Dahla  Dam  in  Kandahar  Province.  In  addition,  there  is  the \nsmall gas-fired Mazar-e-Sharif power plant (35 MW). Kabul is fed by three hydroelectric power \nstations, whose output is downgraded to about 80 MW from a total nameplate rating of 188 MW \nbecause the  Kabul River  on which the dams are sited is fed mainly by melting snow, and the \nreservoir  flow  has  to  be  carefully  rationed  every  day.  Kabul  also  has  two  gas  turbine  stations: \none of 44 MW capacity is no longer economic to run and the second of 45 MW is too expensive \nfor the Ministry  of  Water  and  Power  (MWP)  (4  million  a  year)  to  run.  Transmission  lines  from \nTurkmenistan supply power to cities in northwestern Afghanistan including Herat and Andkhov. \nThis  remains  an  important  power  supply  for  the  region.  Mazar-e-Sharif  imported  power  from \nUzbekistan, but payment problems in 1999 interrupted this power supply. This option has to be \nexplored again. MWP is responsible under the 1964 Electricity Act for the electricity sector, and \nis  also  responsible  for  developing  of  new  and  renewable  energy.  MWP  has  about  6,600  staff \npositions most of which were occupied 20 or so years ago. About 4,000 staff recently reported \nback for duty. The Da Afghanistan Bresha Moassese (DABM) is an enterprise under MWP that \nis  responsible  for  generating,  transmitting, distributing, and selling electricity. A serious lack of \nexperienced professional staff in various fields and poor conditions of the offices and workshops \nprevent  MWP/DABM  from  making  any  progress  in  reconstructing  and  rehabilitating  of  the \nelectricity  sector.  It  is  also  necessary  to  support  MWP  in  devising  policies  and  strategies  for \nsector development, efficient institutional management, and human resource development. \n\nEnvironment \n\nC. \n \nNo natural resource is more precious in Afghanistan than water, and water management \n22. \nsystems throughout the country have been severely damaged during years of internal strife. As \nthe  country  looks  ahead  to  peace  and  prosperity,  both  rural  and  urban  residents  alike  are \nlooking to the restoration of water management systems to support domestic supplies, irrigation, \nindustry, generation of hydropower, and the natural environment. Several water-related issues \nare  especially  significant  from  a  natural  resources  management  perspective,  land  degradation \nfrom  poor  irrigation  practices,  groundwater  management,  and  hydropower  development.  Any \nefforts  to  develop  the  country\u2019s  enormous  hydropower  potential  through  other  than  mini-\nhydropower  schemes  also  will  need  to  apply  accepted  international  norms  for  environmental \nand social planning and protection such as those based on the recommendations of the World \nCommission  on  Dams.  One  of  the  most  critical  environmental  problems  of  Afghanistan  is \nmassive deforestation and overgrazing, which can be aggravated by the return of the refugees, \nespecially  if  their  livelihoods  cannot  be  restored  quickly  and  they  employ  environmentally \nunsound practices. The hostilities of the past 20 years caused extensive deforestation. By 1991, \nthe forest cover had declined from 3.4% to 2.6% of total land area. Since then, continued timber \nharvesting  and  the  use  of  forest  resources  for  fuel  have  reduced  the  forest  cover  to  less  than \n2%  of  the  total  area.  The  consequences  are  degradation  of  watersheds,  soil  erosion,  and \ndesertification,  all  of  which  reduce  soil  productivity.  Reservoir  siltation  will  adversely  affect \nhydropower generation. Land degradation has also been caused by land mines, which reduce \naccess  to  agricultural  land  and  irrigation.  The  country\u2019s  40  million  ha  of  pasture  cover  has \nremained under threat. Uncontrolled urbanization in Kabul and Herat and, to a lesser extent, in \nMazar-e-Sharif  and  Kandahar,  and  encroachment  on  fertile  lands  are  threatening  agricultural \nsustenance to the cities. Lack of safe water and sanitation and inadequate management of solid \nwaste have damaged environmental health. \n \n\n23. \nOther  environmental  issues  include  toxic  residues  from  chemical  warfare,  use  of \nagrochemicals,  and  degradation  of  wetlands.  The  approach  to  environment  preservation  and \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n49\n\nenhancement has to be  based on local traditional knowledge and people\u2019s participation. People \nhave  to  have  choices  and  means  to  take  rational  environment-friendly  decisions.  Costs  of \nenvironmental  degradation  and  benefits  from  environmental  preservation  have  to  be  made \ntransparent.  An  appropriate  policy  and  incentive  framework  will  ensure  that  individuals  and \ncommunities contribute to sustainable development. Mainstreaming environmental concerns in \nall sector development projects will either prevent actions threatening to the environment or put \nappropriate  mitigation  measures  in  place.  Some  key  actions  related  to  environmental \nmanagement  include  preparation  of  a  national  conservation  strategy,  development  of  baseline \ndata and a relevant training program, creation of capacity to formulate policies, an institutional \nframework  and  guidelines,  environmental  monitoring,  establishment  of  protected  areas, \nstabilization of natural forests, development of a sustainable grazing system, and drafting of an \nenvironmental  law.  The  proposed  program  loan  lays  the  foundation  for  environmentally  sound \ninfrastructure reconstruction and development, especially in the road transport, oil and gas and \npower  sectors.  In  addition,  ADB  is  assisting  the  government  to  develop  renewable  energy  in \nsmall towns and rural areas of Afghanistan, which will contribute significantly to improved health \nconditions as well as reduce pressure on fuelwood supply. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \nDirect Short-Run \n \n\nEmployment creation \nthrough rehabilitation \nactivities  \n\n \nChannel of Impact \n \nLabor market \n \n\nPrices of goods and \nservices \n\nAccess to public \nservices  \n\nAccess to assets \n \n\nTransfers \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPoverty Impact Matrix  \n \n\n \nIndirect Short-Run \n\nStable prices through \nmacroeconomic stability  \n\nImproved access to public \nservices through enhanced \npublic sector planning and \nexecution  \n  \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nIndirect Medium-Run \n \n\nImproved functioning of \nlabor markets \n \n    \nImproved functioning of \ngoods markets, enhanced \nproductivity, and regained \nprivate sector confidence \nCost-effective delivery of \npublic services,  \nImproved user confidence \n\n \nMajor Groups Affected \n\nDirect \u2013 unskilled labor  \nIndirect \u2013 entrepreneurs  \n\nThe economy in general will \nbenefit.  \n\nMainly the poor will benefit \nfrom this channel. \n\nImproved security and \nproperty rights, \nImproved access to financial \nassets  \nImproved fiscal space for \npro-poor transfers \nImproved room for private \ntransfers, too.  \n\nThe poor, especially \ninternally displaced persons \nwill benefit from this \nchannel \nMainly the poor would \nbenefit from this channel \n\n \nNet Impacts: The direct impact of the Program is partially pro-poor to the extent that the loan proceeds end up financing physical \nrehabilitation investments. The indirect impact can be generally pro-poor as the majority of the population is considered poor.  \n \nNarrative:  The  actions  taken  under  the  Program  will  contribute  to  institution  building  for  efficient  public  sector  administration  and \npolicy making conducive to private-sector-led economic growth, which will naturally reduce aggregate poverty. Indirect impacts can \nbenefit  the  poor  disproportionately  through  improved  access  to  public  services  that  have  been  otherwise  limited  to  the  urban \npopulation.  \n \nNote: Due to the absence of any poverty assessment and sheer lack of relevant data, the analysis here is based purely on logic and \nenvisaged stylized intention of generic institutional reform type programs.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n4\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5\n0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\ni\n\n\fAppendix 5       51 \n\n \n\nA.  Underlying Principles \n\nADJUSTMENT COSTS \n\nThe proposed Postconflict Multisector Program Loan (PMPL) for Afghanistan considered \n1. \nfour  associated  costs  with  intertemporal,  distributional,  political  economy,  and  developmental \ndimensions.  Under  any  circumstances,  adjustment  is  a  change  process  that  takes  time, \ndepending  on  the  preprogram  situation,  vested  interest,  underlying  structural  rigidities,  and  to \nresponse  and  effect  lags.  In  the  case  of  Afghanistan,  a  beginning  is  being  made  through  the \nproposed  loan  to  rebuild  an  appropriate  policy  and  institutional  framework  for  the  economic \nsectors  and  support  the  operation  of  a  market-based  economy.  For  this,  capacity  has  to  be \ndeveloped  to  elaborate  and  introduce  reform  measures,  enforce  and  sustain  these measures, \nand  make  provision  for  other  costs  associated  with  relative  price  changes,  essential \nreconstruction  and  rehabilitation,  and  structural  changes.  Institutional  reforms  and  related \ncapacity building are likely to extend well beyond the usual administrative life of a program loan. \nSpecific provisions will have to be made for two types of intertemporal costs. First, there are the \nbroad  costs  of  the  process  of  adjustment  that  include  possible  structural  changes,  institutional \nchanges,  attendant  resource  reallocation  and  market  realignments,  reabsorption  into  new \nstructures,  and  compensation  for  those  who  may  lose  from  the  reform.  Second,  there  are  the \nreal  financial  costs  of  the  institutional  change,  such  as  compensatory  payments,  loss  of \nrevenue, new recurrent costs, and other changes in public expenditure. \n\nClosely  related  to  the  lagged  effects  and  intertemporal  issue  of  policy  change  are  the \n\n2. \nimplications for intra- and intertemporal distribution of income, and compensation for losers.1  \n\n3. \nIt is recognized that  both  policy reforms and institutional reforms proposed here have a \npredominantly  developmental  characteristic,  and  involve  the  dismantling  and  reforming  of \nexisting  underperforming  institutions  while  at  the  same  time  developing,  through  investment-\ntype  activity,  new  institutional  arrangements  for  future  development.  It  will  take  time  for  the \nentire process to work out. A practical implication of this is that the entire package needs to be \nplaced in the context of medium-term recurrent budgeting and funded from internal and external \nresources as required.  Importantly, unless the reformed institution receives sufficient recurrent \nspending  (e.g.,  for  operation  and  maintenance  expenses),  the  performance  is  likely  to  decline \neven in its reformed state. In the case of the PMPL, reforms are thus regarded as the creation of \npolicy  and  institutional  assets  that  require  maintenance  through  recurrent  spending,  part  of \nwhich  is  provided  under  the  proposed  PMPL.  Given  the  insufficiency  of  domestic  budget \nresources  for  capital  and  recurrent  items,  a  future  need  for  additional  external  recurrent  cost \nfinancing  is  likely.  Estimates  will  become  known  through  the  medium-term  expenditure \nframework  (MTEF),  to  be  developed  with  support  from  the  ADB-financed technical assistance \ncluster and the PMPL. \n\nB.  Estimation \n\nFour  cost  elements  are  considered  for  the  proposed  program:  (i)  costs  of  compliance \n4. \nwith  the  new  legal  and  regulatory  systems  and  standards,  (ii)  costs  of  capacity  building,  (iii) \n\n                                                 \n1  The envisaged poverty impact of policy change measures supported under the PMPL is presented qualitatively in \n\nAppendix 4, taking account of probable distributional and intertemporal effects.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n52\n\nAppendix 5 \n\ncosts  of  enforcement,  and  (iv)  costs  of  price  adjustments.  Adjustment  costs  cover  technical \nexpert  input,  administrative  support,  training,  compensation  package,  and  building  and \nequipment associated with compliance, capacity building and enforcement. Where appropriate, \ncosts  of  price  adjustments  are  also  to  be  included.  Due  to  the  dynamic  and  hard-to-trace \npolitical economy circumstances, stakeholder and distributional aspects of the adjustment costs \nwere beyond the scope of the estimation exercise here. Costs of capacity building are included \nas  proxies  for  costs  of  institutional  changes  and  development  required  to  achieve  the  desired \noutcomes, which may well underestimate the real institutional costs involved.  \n\n5. \nThe summary of the adjustment costs is shown in Table A5. Detailed assumptions are in \nAnnex  1  (available  upon  request).  The  major  costs  under  reforms  of  governance  and  finance \nare  costs  associated  with  (i)  the  introduction  of  the  new  official  Afghan  currency;  (ii)  the \nimplementation of the national payments system; (iii) simplification of customs procedures and \nrationalization of customs tariff structure; and (iv) enhancing efficiency and effectiveness of civil \nservice.  The  major  costs  for  reforms  of  the  transport  sector  are  costs  associated  with  (i) \nfinalizing a plan for restructuring transport sector institutions; (ii) adopting and implementing of \ncost  recovery  mechanisms,  such  as  construction  of  toll  booths  and  weighing  stations;  and  (iii) \nthe  establishment  of  a  sustainable  financing  mechanism  of  national  road  reconstruction  and \nmaintenance.  The  major  costs  for  reforms  of  the  energy  sector  are  costs  associated  with  (i) \nimproving the efficiency of sector ministries and institutions, (ii) developing capacity, (iii) creating \na  market  framework,  (iv)  promoting  cost  recovery;  and  (v)  promotion  of  private  sector \nparticipation.  \n\n6. \nThe estimation exercise here was carried out based on many uncertain assumptions and \nshould not be seen in the same nature as cost estimates of well-defined investment projects. It \nshould  also  be  noted  that  the  particular  nature  of  the  proposed  loan  makes  it  difficult  or \ninappropriate to directly link the way loan proceeds will be actually utilized within the proposed \nutilization period to the adjustment costs estimated here. The latter will arise inherently over the \nmedium  term,  and  much  may  accrue  without  the  loan  to  the  extent  that  the  Government \nsustains  its  ownership  of  and  commitment  to  the  program.  Therefore,  the  policy  matrix \npresented in Appendix 1 and the associated adjustment costs presented here should be seen in \nlight of reinforcing/supporting the Government\u2019s efficient and sustainable implementation of the \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  activities  to  follow  once  the  basic  institutions  and  policy \nframework are put in place. \n\n\f \n\n \n \n\n \n\nTable A5: Adjustment Costs a,b \n\n               Item \n\nA.

The \ndraft reflects directions provided by the Board of the Afghan Assistance Coordination Authority \n(AACA),  chaired  by  the  Chairman  of  the  Interim  Administration  and  individual  consultations \ncarried out by the Ministry of Planning, the Ministry of Reconstruction and the AACA. The draft \nis  based  on  inputs  from  the  government  departments,  Joint  Needs  Assessment  process  and \ninputs from other actors on the ground. \n \nThis  document  attempts  to  set  out  national  strategy  and  includes  national  priorities  and  policy \ndirections. \n \nThis  early  first  draft  is  presented  to  the  participants  of  the  Implementation  Group  in  order  to \nconvey an early sense of the direction taken by the Interim Administration in the development of \nthe country, and to place in an appropriate context the priority projects presented in the course \nof the meeting. It is envisaged that within six weeks a National Development Budget will have \nbeen finalized. Finalization will entail a further series of extensive consultations with ministries, \ninternational organizations and the NGO community. \n \nThe ongoing process to create the national development budget has included the establishment \nof  the  Development  Budget  Commission,  composed  of  the  Ministry  of  Planning,  Ministry  of \nFinance, Ministry of Reconstruction and the AACA. All projects are expected to be anchored in \none of the programs identified within the National Development Framework, unless exceptional \ncircumstances  apply.  In  this  regard  mechanisms  for  project  and  program  review  are  being \nestablished. \n \nThe National Development Framework \n \nThere  is  a  consensus  in  Afghan  society:  violence  as  a  means  of  compelling  the  majority  to \nsubmit  to  the  will  of  a  minority  must  end.  The  people\u2019s  aspirations  must  be  represented  and \nreflected  in  an  accountable  government  that  delivers  value  on  a  daily  basis.  This  consensus \nforms the foundation for a vision  of a prosperous and secure Afghanistan. The current poverty \nof the country is painfully obvious; this vision of a peaceful and prosperous future is a beacon \nthat  can  mobilize  the  energies  of  an  enterprising  and  independent  people,  guide  them  in  their \ncollective and individual pursuits, and reinforce the sense of national unity, mutual dependence \nand participation in a common enterprise. \n \nOur  people  are  poor,  the  majority  is  illiterate,  but  the  sophistication  of  political  debate  and \nawareness is remarkable, in great part due to the international media. Despite the years of war, \nour  opinions  are  also  shaped  by  a  myriad  of  networks  that  link  us  to  the  international \ncommunity.  There  is  a  widespread  desire  to  retain  the  current  international  interest  in  our \ncountry,  and  to  channel  it  in  ways  that  would  lay  the  basis  for  multiple  partnerships  between \ndifferent groups in our society and the global community. \n \nThis  desire  for  engagement  is  premised  on  the  hope  that  international  engagement  will  be  an \ninstrument  for  ending  our  poverty,  the  re-establishment  of  our  sovereignty  and  national  unity, \n\n \n\n\f58\n\n \n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nand a foundation for sustainable prosperity. Our people\u2019s expectations have been raised by the \npromises of world leaders that they will be with us for the long haul. The succession of visits and \ndelegations are a sign to our people that the engagement is continuing. \n \nDiscussions  of  development,  however,  remain  abstract.  Public  opinion  is  shaped  by  concrete \nmanifestations.  If  the  general  discussions  are  not  connected  to  changes  in the daily lives and \nexperiences of the people, public opinion could easily turn skeptical. \n \nAfghans  have  been  disappointed  by  the  international  community  before.  Hope  could  then  be \nreplaced by frustration, and frustration, in a context of raised expectations, is a recipe for anger, \ndiscord and finally conflict. For us to capitalize on the current consensus, then, we must deliver, \nand  deliver  soon;  as  words  become  deeds,  belief  in  the  possibility  of  a  safe  and  prosperous \nfuture will grow. \n \nDelivering rapidly, however, does not mean delivering unwisely. We must internalize the lessons \nof 50 years of experience of international assistance. Afghanistan offers a unique opportunity to \nprove to the skeptics that the aid system is relevant in a post-conflict context, and that difficult \nchallenges can be met with determination, partnership and vision. \n \nFive lessons stand out: \n \n\n\u2022  First, the developmental agenda must be owned domestically, and the recipient country \n\nmust be in the driver\u2019s seat. \n\n\u2022  Second,  the  market  and  the  private  sector  is  a  more  effective  instrument  of  delivering \n\nsustained growth than the state. \n\n\u2022  Third,  without  a  state  committed  to  investing  in  human  capital,  the  rule  of  law,  the \ncreation  of  systems  of  accountability  and  transparency,  and  providing  the  enabling \nenvironment for the operation of the private sector, aid cannot be an effective instrument \nof development. \n\n\u2022  Fourth,  people  in  general  and  the  poor  in  particular  are  not  passive  recipients  of \ndevelopment  but  active  engines  of  change.  Sustainable  development  requires  citizen \nparticipation  and  adopting  of  methods  of  governance  that  enable  the  people  to  take \ndecisions on issues that affect them and their immediate surroundings. \n\n\u2022  Fifth, donor- funded investment projects, unless they are anchored in coherent programs \nof  government,  are  not  sustainable.  Structural  adjustment  programs,  unless  they  are \ntranslated into feasible projects, do not result in reform. \n\n \nThere is an emerging consensus that the budget must be the central instrument of policy, and \nthat  the  country  should  have  the  capacity  to  design  programs  and  projects  that  are  part  of  a \ncoherent developmental strategy. All interventions must have clear outcomes, and be properly \nmonitored. \n \nThe Strategy \n \nOur  developmental  strategy  has  three  pillars:  The first is to use humanitarian assistance and \nsocial policy to create the conditions for people to live secure lives and to lay the foundations for \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 8      \n   \n\n59\n\nthe  formation  of  sustainable  human  capital.  The  second  is  the  use  of  external  assistance  to \nbuild the physical infrastructure that lays the basis for a private sector- led strategy of growth, in \nsuch  a  manner  as  to  support  the  building  of  human  and  social  capital.  The  third  pillar  is  the \ncreation of sustainable growth, where a competitive private sector becomes both the engine of \ngrowth and the instrument of social inclusion through the creation of opportunity. \n \nCutting  across  all  our  activities  will  be  the  issues  of  security,  of  administrative  and  financial \nreform, and of gender. \n \nA brief outline of the programs and sub-programs contained in each pillar will be provided here, \nthe Annexes contain a more detailed description. \n \nPillar 1 \u2013 Humanitarian and Human and Social Capital \n \nWe  are  still  in  the  midst  of  a  humanitarian  crisis.  We  are  keenly  aware  of  the  needs  and \nconditions of our vulnerable people. We need immediate action in the following areas: Refugees \nand  returnees;  between  1.4  to  2m  refuges  are  expected  to  return  to  their  homes,  along  with \nthousands  of  internally  displaced.  A  systematic  and  integrated  approach will be required if we \nare to help them re- integrate safely and develop secure livelihoods rather than end up in shanty \ntowns. Education, after years of neglect and worse, will be the foundation of economic growth \nand  poverty  reduction.  Vocational  training  is  a  priority,  in  particular  to  assist  the  mujahadeen, \nmany of whom have sacrificed so much in the cause of freedom (1.1.2),  and to assist women \n(1.3.1).  Health  and  nutrition  will  require  massive  and  long-term  investment  if  we  are  to  lift \nAfghanistan  from  169  in  the  human  development  index  (1.2.1).  Two  areas  need  particularly \nurgent  attention,  malnutrition,  and  better  obstetric  care  that  will  bring  down  the  unacceptably \nhigh  levels  of  maternal  and  infant  mortality  rates  (1.2.2).  Afghans  have  shown  a  remarkable \nability to survive in the face of disaster, but there is a need to invest in livelihoods to facilitate our \nenterprise in the search for a good living. And finally, after the ravages of the Taliban, we must \nact  fast  to  preserve  our  national  heritage,  we  must  remember  the  vital  role  of  culture  in  the \nprocess of national reconstruction and defining Afghan identify. \n \nIt is vital that we take an integrated and programmatic approach to all work in this pillar. \n \nWe  cannot  afford  sectoral  and  localized  projects  that  lead  to  disconnects.  So  we  are  initiating \ntwo, large-scale, integrated programs as the foundation of much work in this pillar. Firstly we will \ninitiate  a  national  community  development  program,  known  as  National  Solidarity,  which  will \ndeliver  block  grants  to  communities  across  the  country  (1.4.1).  And  secondly  we  have \ndesignated 10 key areas for special attention because they have been worst affected by human \nrights abuses and will be centers of refugee and IDP return  (1.4.2). We are requesting the UN \nagencies and bilateral donors to help us develop rapidly a series of projects in these areas. \n \nPillar 2 \u2013 Physical Reconstruction and Natural Resources \n \nWe intend to begin the reconstruction and expansion of the physical infrastructure as soon as \npossible.  The  government  is  committed  to  launching  public  works  programs  immediately  in \norder to offer opportunities to the unemployed and under-employed (1.1.1). We have identified a \nnumber  of  programs  in  this  area  and  are  in  the  process  of  preparing  specific projects within \neach of the programs. For example, roads (2.1.1), water and sanitation (2.2.1), and the energy \nsector  (2.3.1)  all  need  urgent  attention.  As  the  country  will  be  rebuilt  by  its  families,  we  also \nneed to ensure people have access to building materials (2.3.2 & 3). \n \n\n \n\n\f60\n\n \n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nIn urban management our aim is to invest in a balanced urban development program across the \ncountry to create viable cities that are hubs of economic activity, and organically linked to rural \nareas (2.4.1). With the concentration of population in some cities, they would play a major role \nin  the  overall  improvement  of  human  development  indicators.  In  terms  of  municipal \ninfrastructure  we  need  to  focus  on  some  immediate  and  pressing  needs  such  as  roads  and \ntransport (2.4.2 & 3) sewerage, waste management, drinking water and sanitation. \n \nAs much of the physical infrastructure of government has been destroyed, we will implement a \nnational  program  of  construction  that  will  create  or  restore  the  physical  infrastructure  of \ngovernment across the country. \n \nOur approach to physical infrastructure is based on lessons from international experience. The \nstate  will  define  the  areas  of  priorities,  but  it  will  not  be  the  implementing  agency.  Instead,  we \nwill  turn  to  the  national  and  international  private  sector  to  help  us  design  and  implement  our \nprojects.  Communities  and  NGOs  will  be  asked  to  participate  in  identification,  monitoring  and \nevaluation of these programs and projects.  We will pay  serious attention to the operation and \nmaintenance costs of these projects and will be looking closely at their financial and economic \nsustainability. The issue of medium to long-term consequences of short-term interventions has \nalready become clear in the health sector. For example, there has been considerable interest in \nthe  rehabilitation  or  construction  of  hospitals  in  Kabul.  But  our  health  experts  are  pointing  out \nthat the recurrent costs of hospitals located in the capital could be a serious drain on resources \nthat could be more usefully directed towards preventative medicine. \n \nPillar 3 \u2013Private Sector Development \n \nThe implementation of the infrastructure program will give some impetus to the development of \nthe private sector, but it is in the development of a competitive export-oriented economy that our \nreal  hopes  for  the  private  sector  lie.  We  are  in  the  fortunate  position  that  the  European  and \nAmerican markets are open to our exports. We are in the process of being granted most favored \nnation status and we are receiving strong support from the US Administration and Congress for \ntextile quotas. \n \nWe  need  to  meeting  international  standards  on  health,  organic  agriculture,  child  labor, \ncertificates of origin, and other technical requirements. We will need assistance in these areas \nand consultations with our entrepreneurs to explain the opportunities that exports to Europe will \nprovide. The development of the export market for our agricultural and horticultural products is \ncritical to our strategy of eliminating poppy cultivation. With high-value and low-volume products, \nwe can be confident of offering our farmers secure livelihoods. We are planning to use our OPIC \nguarantee to assist in the development of an agricultural processing industry. \n \nRecognizing  the  enormous  international  interest  in  Afghanistan,  we  are  creating  a  \u201cMade  in \nAfghanistan\u201d  label  and  \u201cMade  in  Afghanistan  by  Women\u201d  label  to  enable  Afghan  producers  to \nrealize the maximum from their labors. We hope to link Afghan producers to a number of large \ndepartment  stores.  Afghanistan  has  considerable  assets ; sustainable use and development of \nthese  assets  will  require  foreign  direct  investment.  We  are  working  on  the  relevant  policy  and \nlegal  frameworks  that  would  attract  investment,  including,  for  example,  the  urgent  need  for  a \nbasic regulatory and licensing framework for telecommunications (4.1.2). \n \nWe  must  also  use  internal  trade  as  a  way  of  binding  the  country  back  together  again, \neconomically  as  well  as  politically.  Alongside  the  roads  programs  already  mentioned,  this  will \nmean reinvigorating our market places in secondary and tertiary towns (3.1.1). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 8      \n   \n\n61\n\nGovernance, financial management and administrative reform \n \nWe know that good governance is a precondition for attracting direct foreign investment. We are \naddressing  the  issues  of  financial  management,  auditing  and  procurement  through  hiring \ninternational  private  firms  chosen  on  the  basis  of  direct  competition.  Our  goal  is  to  have  a \nbudgetary process that would meet the international standards for receiving direct donor support \nfor reconstruction and development projects. Building the domestic revenue collecting ability of \nAfghanistan  will  be  a  key  part  of  the  reconstruction  process.  Revenue  capacities,  and \nparticularly the national unity of the revenue collection system, have been in disarray during the \nrecent period and need to be rebuilt. \n \nThe degradation of our financial institutions in fact offers us an opportunity to move forward with \nspeed and determination in creating management systems that will provide the underpinning for \naccountability, efficiency and transparency. Our banking sector requires a major over-haul, and \nwe  are  embarking  on  this  process.  The  Central  Bank\u2019s  role  is  being  strengthened  and  the \ngovernment has made a commitment in its budget decree to observe financial discipline and not \nresort  to  overdraft.  We  are  emphasizing  the  need  for  urgent  capacity  building  in  the  Central \nBank  and  the  banking  sector  and  are  requesting  urgent  technical  assistance  in  this  area.  We \nare  examining  the  relevant  laws  and  regulations  and  are  preparing  a  series  of  measures to \nprovide a firm legal basis for a modern financial sector. \n \nRule of law is the basis of good governance. The administration has strictly abided by the Bonn \nagreement  and  is  determined  to  see  the  Emergency  Loya  Jirga  take  place  on  time.  We  are \ndetermined  to  use  the  time  remaining  to  the  Interim  Administration  to  prepare  proposals  and \nplans  for  strengthening  the  rule  of  law  and  to  implement  measures  that  would  enhance  the \nconfidence of our people in their government. \n \nWe  view  the  principle  of  accountable  government  as  applying  as  much  to  our  development \npolicy  as  our  administrative  and  judicial.  We  in  the  advanced  stages  of  planning  a  national \ncommunity empowerment program, called National Solidarity, that will deliver a series of block \ngrants to communities to enable them to make decisions in a participatory manner on their key \npriorities. We are planning to cover at least 1 to 2 districts in every province under this program. \nThis approach should enable members of the communities to choose their local leaders, and to \nstrengthen  their  collective  efforts  in  mobilizing  their  own  resources  to  supplement  those \nprovided by the government. \n \nWe  must  get  the  balance  right  between  Kabul  and  the  provinces,  between  the  urban  centers \nand the rural areas. This is important both to ensure an equitable balance in our investments, \nand  in  terms  of  the  political  and  administrative  relationship.  All  interventions,  whether  roads, \nsanitation, power or drinking water, will be chosen on the basis of an even-handed approach to \nspatial  development  that  focuses  on  needs  not  on  ethnic  group.  While  Kabul\u2019s  needs  are \nimmense, and there is an urgent need for a comprehensive reconstruction plan of the city, our \nfocus must be the entire country. The physical infrastructure of government is either destroyed \nor severely damaged. We are therefore planning a major program of construction of the physical \ninfrastructure  of  governance  across  the  country.  Each  ministry  and  district  must  have  a \nminimum  number  of  facilities  (4.1.3)  and  these  facilities  should  be  equipped  with  means  of \ncommunication  to  enable  speedy  flow  of  information  between  levels  of  government  and  to \nconnect Kabul to the provinces (4.1.1). Only then will we be able to link up the country under a \nunified government. \n \n\n \n\n\f62\n\n \n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nWe have carried out an assessment of the capacity of our line ministries and have reached the \nconclusion  that  we  need  an  innovative  approach  to  the  rapid  building  of  capacity  as  well  as  a \nstrategy  for  reform  of  the  administrative  system.  Our  approach  to  the  immediate problem is to \ncreate  implementation  cells  of  between  10  and  40  people  in  line  ministries.  The  staff  of  these \ncells,  to  be  recruited  on  the  basis  of  clear  criteria  of  merit,  technical  competence  and  clear \ndefinition  of  tasks,  will  be  provided  with  the  resources  to  translate  our  overall  programs  into \nspecific projects and oversee the implementation of these projects by the private sector, NGOs \nand  international  contractors.  They  will  be  supported  by  technical  assistance  from  donors  and \nwill  work  closely  with  AACA  to  enhance  coordination  between  communities,  the  government, \ndonors, NGOs and the UN. \n \nWe will be adopting a similar approach to the provincial administration. \n \nThe  years  of  conflict  degraded  the  civil  service.  We  now  need  to  start  work  in  earnest  on the \nimportant  task  of  creating  a  modern  and  efficient  civil  service..  The  Civil  Service  Commission \nhas  been  selected  and  will  start  its  work  soon.  It  will  need  to  be  supported  by  strong  analytic \nwork  and  by  inputs  from  key  actors  in  the  development  arena  to  formulate  and  implement  a \ncomprehensive agenda of reform. Of particular importance will be training, in both management \nand technical areas. A civil service training college is being proposed. \n \nPay scale is a critical issue. NGOs, bilateral, multilateral organizations and the UN system have \npay scales that exceed the government\u2019s pay scale by a factor of 50 for their national staff. The \ndifferential in pay between international staff and government staff is a factor of 1000 to 2000. \nSuch an uneven playing field militates against the building of capacity. While the market cannot \nbe controlled, there has to be an imaginative and principled approach to addressing this critical \nissue.  Donors  should  make  a  clear  commitment  to  increasing  the  number  of  their  Afghan \nnational staff and should join the government in setting up a task force to propose sustainable \nsolutions  to  this  problem.  Without  a  workable  solution,  this  problem  will  haunt  all  our  good \nintentions for creating capacity. \n \nSecurity and the Rule of Law \n \nRule of law and good governance depend on security. The Afghan state must have a legitimate \nmonopoly of violence, a corollary of which is that its citizens will not need to pay for the cost of \nprotection as individuals. Freedom of movement, for commodities and ideas, is constrained by \nperceptions of security. For example, many donors now insist on staying in Kabul, and starting \nprojects  there.  Kabul\u2019s  needs  are  immense,  but  in  our  judgment,  there  are  other  parts  of  the \ncountry that are more secure than  Kabul. Thus does the perception of insecurity exclude areas \nurgently in need of development assistance from receiving attention. \n \nWe  have  prepared  a  detailed  program  for  the  creation,  training  and  deployment  of  a  national \npolice  force.  We  have,  however,  been  constrained  from  implementing  our  program  by  lack  of \nfunds  and  exclusion  of  support  for  the  police  from  the  UNDP  administrated  Trust  Fund.  This \nconstraint is being removed, and we hope to embark on our program very rapidly. We have also \nformulated our plan for the formation of a national army and the first battalion of the new army \nhas been trained and deployed as the National Guard. \n \nWe  will  also  need  to  provide  for  absorption  back  into  society  of  the  mujahadeen,  who  have \nsacrificed  so  much  for  the  independence  and  dignity  of  this  country.  Absorption  of  the \nmujahadeen into the economy, society and polity is a significant challenge. We plan to meet this \nchallenge through a series of measures. A large-scale program of vocational training, based on \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 8      \n   \n\n63\n\nan analysis of the needs of an expanding economy, will be a critical part of this program and we \nare inviting donors to assist us in implementing this program quickly. Demining is also an urgent \npriority and a precondition for agricultural recovery and freedom of movement (4.2.2). \n \nWe are counting on finding solutions to meeting the expenses of the security sector quickly. In \nGeneva, there have been extensive discussions on meeting the costs of the national army and \npolice  and  we  now  need  to  act  rapidly.  Our  developmental  efforts  depend  on  the  provision  of \nsecurity, as without the perception and reality of security of person and property, people will not \nfeel safe to invest. \n \nThe  judicial  system  will  be  revived  through  a  program  that  provides  training,  makes  laws  and \nprecedents available to all parts of the system, and rehabilitates the physical infrastructure and \nequipment of the judicial sector (4.2.1). \n \nOur vision of security, however, is broader than the services provided by the security sector to \nthe  citizens.  Security  of  livelihood  is  critical  to  our  endeavor,  to  eliminate  poverty,  to  provide \nsocial  justice,  remove  barriers  to  inclusion  and  to  create  a  society  where  all  citizens  are \nprovided with access to equality of opportunity. \n \nGender \n \nGender is a critical issue for us. Subjected to the segregationist policies of the Taliban, our girls \nand  women  need  special  attention.  We  do  not  want  gender  to  be  a  ghetto.  There  must  be \nspecific  programs  directed  to  enhancing  the  capabilities  of  our  girls  and  women.  More \nimportantly,  all  programs  must  pay  special  attention  to  gender,  and  not  include  it  as  an \nafterthought. We have to engage in a societal dialogue to enhance the opportunities of women \nand improve cooperation between men and women on the basis of our culture, the experience \nof other Islamic countries, and the global norms of human rights. \n \nResearch, information management and policy-making \n \nAs a living document, this framework will be amended, modified and transformed in the light of \nnew research, experience and knowledge. Its implementation will thus depend on access to and \nmanagement of information. Currently, very little reliable information exists, often information is \nfragmented and hoarded. This hampers the government\u2019s ability to respond to predictable crises \nand to make policy based on evidence of what works and what does not. \n \nThe  government  will  create  and  maintain  an  information  management  system  on  all  donor \nactivities  (4.1.4).  Standards  for  information  gathering  need  to  be  set,  and  information  shared \npromptly and widely. Timely monitoring and evaluation of programs and projects will be built into \ntheir design. The Afghanistan Information Management System (AIMS) will be one component \nof  this  larger  strategy.  We  have  already  received  assistance  and  are  in  the  process  of \nimplementing  this  policy.  All  information  management  systems  created  by  individual  donors \nshould  provide  inputs  to  the  government\u2019s  information  management  system  currently  at  the \nAACA that will be eventually transferred to the Central Statistical Office. \n \nThe Role of the State \n \nFinally, our strategy of development provides a clear role for the state. The state must provide \nsecurity,  invest  in  human  capital,  and  articulate  and  implement  a  social  policy  focused  on \nassistance  to  the  vulnerable  and  excluded  and  the  elimination  of  poverty.  It  must  create  an \n\n \n\n\f64\n\n \n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nenabling environment for the activities of the private sector, make effective use of aid to attract \ntrade and investment, and put the economy on a sustainable path to growth. \n \nWe  thus  need  an  effective  central  government  that  re-establishes  the  national  unity  of  the \ncountry on the basis of strong institutions and the rule of law. Simultaneously, we are committed \nto building on community level participation and effective management at the local level. We do \nnot  see  government  as  the  producer  and  manager  of  the  economy,  but  as  regulator  and \npromoter  of  the  entrepreneurial  energies  of  our  people.  The  state  will  enter  into  a  direct \nmanagerial  role  only  when  social  justice  demands  its  presence.  The  government  will  act  in \npartnership  with  communities,  NGOs,  donors,  UN  organizations  and  the  national  and \ninternational  private  sector  to  implement  its  programs,  and  realize  its  vision.  As  the  legitimate \nrepresentative  of  the  people,  it  is  the  key  task  and  challenge  of  the  government  to  create  the \ninstitutions and organizations that would embody principles and practices of good governance. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 9\n\n65\n\n \n\nNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT BUDGET SY 1381-82 \nOfficial Summary1 \nOctober 10, 2002 \n\n \nBackground \n \n1.  \nThe 1381-1382 National Development Budget (NDB) attempts to translate the priorities \non  the  National  Development  Framework  (NDF)  into  programmes  and  projects  whilst \nsimultaneously providing a vehicle for policy development. It provides an outline of ongoing and \nproposed investments for the period and therefore consolidates investments based around the \n12 programme groups presented within the NDF. \n \n2.  \nto achieve the objectives stated in the NDF. Specific objectives include: \n \n\nThe objective of the NDB is to provide the financial means for Government investments \n\ni.   Develop the capacities of the public administration for good governance; \nii.   Accelerate reconstruction of basic infrastructure and services; \niii.   Accelerate economic growth as the precursor to any policy for poverty reduction; \niv.  \n\nImprove  the  competitiveness  of  the  economy  and  reduce  national  and  household \nvulnerability to economic shocks; and, \n\nv.   Extend access to basic services (education, heath etc.). \n\n3.  \nThis budget has been prepared through an extensive consultation process involving both \nGovernment  Ministries  and  the  international  donor  assistance  community.  Initially programme \nsecretariats  provided  support  to  some  Government  Ministries  in  the  elaboration  of  strategic \npriorities  for  investment.  Thereafter  the  Ministries  of  Reconstruction,  Finance  and  Planning \nconvened  consultation  meetings  with  all  lead  Ministries,  the  UN  Agencies  and  donors  to \nelaborate the final development budget. \n \n4.  \nThe  budget  comprises  the  portfolio  of  projects  and  programmes  at  varying  stages  of \ndevelopment  (from  ongoing  project  to  project  concepts)  which  the  public  sector  (in  a  broad \nsense) intends to execute in the present and following fiscal years. The figures listed as \u2018budget\u2019 \nrepresent the priorities identified by the Ministries and their partners. These figures have not yet \nbeen modified to take into account either the overall resources available to the Government, or \nthe relative priority the Government places on each program. In this regard, the figures identified \nas  budget  are  not  yet  endorsed  as  priority  Government  projects.  This  process  will  be \nundertaken  over  the  next  five  months  as  the  priorities  are  revised  and  greater  clarity  from \ndonors  allows  the  overall  resource  envelope  and  the  extent  of  any  earmarking  within  that \nenvelope to be understood. \n \nImportantly,  the  NDB  provides  a  springboard  to  enhance  direct  donor  assistance  to \n5.  \ngovernment  and  prepares  the  way  for  a  more  comprehensive  approach  to  planning  and \nbudgeting  through  a  medium  term  budgeting  and  planning  process.  To  enhance  development \ncooperation, the Programme Secretariat structure, which has served an invaluable platform, will \nbe  superceded  by  Consultative  Groups.  This  will  enable  direct  Government\u2013Donor interaction \naround the planning and budgeting of assistance to Afghanistan. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Transitional Government of Afghanistan, Ministries of Planning, Reconstruction and Finance, \u201cWorking Draft \u2013 Plan \n\nand Budget for 1381-1382 \u2013 National Development Programme\u201d (Kabul, 10 October 2002). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f66\n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\ntelecommunications,  energy  and  mining,  natural \n\nCross  cutting  issues  such  as  governance,  drugs,  gender,  environment  have  been \n\n6.  \nmainstreamed within each programme and sub-programme. \n \n7.  \nThe  NDB  comprises  the  following  programmes:  refugee  return,  education,  health  and \nnutrition,  rural  livelihoods  and  social  protection,  cultural  heritage,  media  and  sports,  transport \nand \nresource  management,  urban \nmanagement, trade and investment, public administration and security and rule of law. \n \nBudget Limitations \n \n8.  \nThe  budget  process  has  allowed  for  wide  participation  of  both  the  Government  and \ninternational  community  however,  the  following  constraints  to  this  budget  must  be  recognized \nand indeed will need to be addressed in preparation of the 1382 budget. \n \n\ni.  \n\nBudget calculations are based on assessment of present and future commitments \nby  each  sub-programme  area,  as  reported  by  lead  Ministries.  The  budgets  have \nbeen cross referenced with the Donor Assistance Database where possible; \n\nii.   Sectoral budget allocations for programmes have still to be established; \niii.  \n\nIt  has  not  been  possible  to  catch  all  commitments  and  expenditures  because  of \ncomplexity of multi-agency funding arrangements and the delays in reporting. This \nis particularly so for NGO related projects; \n\niv.   The  1381  development  budget  does  not  include  recurrent  costs  for  public \nadministration.    These  are  included  in  the  Ordinary  budget  approved  in  April  and \nwill  be  integrated  with  the  development  budget  for  1382.  Implementing  partner \noperational costs have yet to be documented; \n\nv.   The  total  population  of  Afghanistan  remains  transient  and  imprecisely  known \n\nvi.  \n\nvii.  \n\naffecting calculations for health and education coverage; \nInstitutional  responsibilities  need  to  be  clarified  in  a  number  of  sub-programme \nareas; \nIt has not been possible to consult with provincial Governors and offices this time \naround and this will be addressed in the following fiscal year; \n\nviii.  The size of the Afghan National Army and border guards has yet to be established \n\u2013 rough budget estimates are therefore accorded only. Estimates for Disarmament, \nDemobilisation and Reintegration therefore remain provisional. \n\n \nInvestment Priorities for 1381 and 1382 \n \n9.  \nIn the light of the experience gained so far in 1381, with a heavy focus on humanitarian \nand  not  reconstruction  assistance,  the  Government  wishes  to  refocus  the  investment \nprogramme towards the following areas \u2014 as priorities for donor engagement: \n \n\ni.   National Solidarity Program and Emergency Public Works Program; \nii.   Education Infrastructure Project; \niii.   Urban Infrastructure Project; \niv.   Water Resource Investment Project; \nv.   National Governance Infrastructure Project; and \nvi.   Transport Project (major roads and airports). \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 9\n\n67\n\n \n\nPreferred Investment Funding Mechanisms \n \n10.  \nIt  is  essential  that  the  Government  strengthen  financial  coordination  mechanisms  to \nenhance  the  effectiveness  of  development.  The  Government  can  be  supported  financially  by \none of three mechanisms \u2013 through direct contribution to the Ministry of Finance; through Trust \nFunds  administered  by  International  organizations  before  being  contributed  to  the  Ministry  of \nFinance; or by direct support to private sector organizations to carry out government identified \npriority projects. \n \n11.   Direct  Contribution  to  Ministry  of  Finance:  As  the  approach  preferred  by  the \nAfghanistan Government, contributions can be made directly to the Ministry of Finance for either \ngeneral budget support to finance the range of expenditures identified in the approved budget, \nor  for  designated  purposes  or  projects  identified  by  the  donor,  consistent  with  government \npriorities.    Funds  can  be  deposited  into  a  separately  identified  government  account  at  Da \nAfghanistan  Bank,  or  into  a  separate  account  at  one  of  the  Bank's  offshore  account  locations \n(preferably  Abu  Dhabi).  A  standard  financing  agreement  for  use  between  Government  and \nDonor  is  currently  being  developed  for  direct  contributions.  Processing  and  accounting  will  be \ncarried out by the Treasury Department in accordance with the accounting framework, using the \ncomputer  data-base  accounting  system  currently  being  installed  under  the  World  Bank \nEmergency Public Administration Project contracted to KPMG Consulting Inc. \n \n12.  \n \n\nTrust Fund Arrangements \n\ni.  \n\n \nii.  \n\nAfghanistan  Reconstruction  Trust  Fund (ARTF):  The  ARTF,  administered  by  the \nInternational  Development  Association,  has  been  established  to  allow  donors  to \nprovide  funds  to  the  Government  for  recurrent  and  capital  expenditures,  and  for \nreturning  Afghan  expatriates  and  training.  Donors  are  required  to  establish  an \nAgreement  with  the  Trust  Fund  Administrator  and  deposit  funds  into  accounts \nnominated  by  the  Administrator.  In  addition,  project  funds  can  be  earmarked  by \ndonors  for  specific  investments.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  has  opened  special \naccounts  to  receive  funds  from  the  ARTF  in  accordance  with  statement  of \nexpenditures  furnished  to  the  Administrator  by  the  Government,  which  are \nmonitored by a separate Agent. Once funds are in the special accounts they will be \nprocessed  and  accounted  for  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  Treasury  Department \nusing the new accounting system. \n\nLaw and Order Trust Fund for Afghanistan (LOTFA):  The LOTFA, administered by \nthe UNDP, has been established to receive funds for Police related expenditures, \nincluding  salaries,  identified  in  the  approved  budget,  which  are  not  eligible  for \nfunding  from  the  ARTF.  Donors  would  provide  funds  to  the  LOTFA,  which  in  turn \nprovides the funds to the Government account to be administered by the Ministry \nof  Finance \nfinancial \nmanagement  procedures.  Once  funds  are  in  the  account  they  will  be  processed \nand accounted for by the Treasury Department using its new system. \n\nin  accordance  with  government \n\nfor  Police  purposes \n\n \niii.   Military  Trust  Fund:  The  UN  Assistance  Mission  in  Afghanistan  (UNAMA) \nadministers  a  Trust  Fund  for  paying  salaries  and  benefits  to  the  Afghanistan \nNational Army. This UN Trust Fund provides funds to the Da Afghanistan Bank for \npayments  processed  and  accounted  for  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  Treasury \nDepartment, in co-ordination with Ministry of Defence developed payroll of eligible \nmilitary personnel. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f68\n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n13.   Direct Private Sector or NGO Support:  Donors may wish to provide funding directly to \nprivate sector entities or NGOs to carry out projects or development activities identified by the \nGovernment  in  the  National  Development  Framework  released  in  April  2002.  Options  for \nfunding  NGOs  through  the  National  Solidarity  Programme  also  remains  an  important  funding \nroute.  Under  this  arrangement,  project  agreements,  banking  and  accounting  arrangements \nwould be determined between the donor and the entity. \n \n14.   UN  Transitional  Assistance  Programme  to  Afghanistan  (TAPA):  Agreement  has \nbeen reached between the Government and the UN that the TAPA will be complementary to the \nGovernment\u2019s budget and that it will focus on humanitarian support only. TAPA will remain the \nfourth priority funding channel after direct support to the MoF, to the Trust Funds and through \nsupport provided to the private sector and NGOs. \n \n15.  \nThe  Planning  Framework  for  the  1382  Budget  Submission:  Based  upon  the \nexperiences gained in developing the 1381 budget the following new orientations will form the \nbasis for strengthened Government \u2013 Donor coordination: \n \n\ni.   Consultative  Groups  will  be  established  to  support  the  development  of  a  Medium \n\nTerm Expenditure Strategy and Framework; \n\nii.   A progressive move from a narrow humanitarian approach towards reconstruction \n\nfocused investments; \n\niii.   Government will remain central to the development of the national budget around \nwhich  donors  and  the  UN  will  coordinate  assistance  and  jointly  prioritise \ninvestments; \n\niv.   The  private  sector  will  remain  the  engine  for  growth  although  expanded  donor \n\nassistance will still be required; and \n\nv.   The 1382  budget will present both operating and development expenditures in an \n\nintegrated fashion. \n\n \n16.  \nIn the run up to the 1382 budget submission, the Government will be in the driving seat, \nalbeit  through  a  process  of  consultation.  In  future,  it  is  critical  for  the  parties  to  the  budget \nprocess to give a high priority to meeting the scheduled milestones in the narrative summaries \nattached.  The efforts of the Government will include: \n \n\ni.  \n\nreviewing  carefully  the  budget  instructions  and  forms  and  submitting  budget \nrequests  in  a  timely  fashion  in  conformity  with  the  instructions  and  the  guidance \nletters presented by the Ministry of Finance, \n\nii.   working  directly  with  donors  to  make  sure  that  integrated  donor  and  ministry \n\nestimates are captured in the budget requests, and \n\niii.   considering carefully the observations of the provincial government in the process \n\nof determining the final set of priorities for review by the Cabinet. \n\n \n17.  \nministries. Thus, in order to make the process effective, donors will need to: \n \n\nThe  donors\u2019  role  is  critical.  Donor  support  must  be  based  on  consultation  with  the \n\ni.   work  with  ministries  in  developing  donor  estimates  for  the  1382\u20131384 period for \n\nii.  \n\ninclusion in the ministries\u2019 budget requests; \nreview with ministries any adjustments ministries make to their budget requests to \nreflect governments\u2019 recommendations; and \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 9\n\n69\n\n \n\niii.   after  the  March  2003  IG  meeting,  make  any  necessary  adjustments  in  donor \n\nsupport levels for the period. \n\n \n18.   Most  importantly,  all  donor  intentions  need  to  be  reflected  in  the  1382  ministry  budget \nrequests (including those for 1383 and 1384), recognizing that these may change. The Budget \nLaw of Afghanistan requires that all donor assistance to the government, whether in cash or in \nkind,  is  to  be  reflected  in  the  budget.  While  that  has  been  difficult  to  accomplish  during  1381, \nconsistent application of this rule will be a priority for 1382. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n70 \n\n \n\nBACKGROUND STUDIES, CHRONOLOGY OF PROCESSING STEPS AND APPROACH \n \n\nThe program content is based on intensive consultation with all stakeholders and a wide \n\n1. \nrange of analytical studies undertaken on Afghanistan by various bodies and authors including \nthe Asian Development Bank as well as other relevant documents.  \n\n\u2022  Afghanistan  Interim  Administration,  National Development Framework,  Kabul,  April \n\n2002. \n\n\u2022  Afghanistan  Research  and  Evaluation  Unit  (AREU).2002.

The Mission comprised Craig \nSteffensen,  Mission  Leader/Senior  Programs  Officer,  SAOC;  Manabu  Fujimura, \nEconomist, SAOC; and Mohiuddin Alamgir, SAOC Staff Consultant. The Mission was \nassisted  in  the  field  by  Salim  Qayum,  Senior  Liaison  Officer,  Special  Liaison \nOffice/Kabul;  and  Jawed  Sulaiman,  Finance  &  Administration  Specialist,  Special \nLiaison  Office/Kabul.  In  addition,  Frank  Polman,  Senior  Advisor,  SARD,  and \nAfghanistan  Program  Director,  visited  Kabul  during  31  August\u20135  September  to \nprovide  guidance  to  the  Mission  and  to  pay  courtesy  calls  on  Transitional \nGovernment  officials  and  representatives  of  key  international  organizations  and \nmajor  embassies  in  Kabul.  Klaus  Gerhauesser,  Director,  SAGF;  Renato  Limjoco, \nLead  Financial  Sector  Specialist,  SAGF;  and  Barbara  Ericsson,  Principal  Financial \nSector  Specialist,  SAGF,  joined  the  Mission  during  31  August\u20135  September,  and \nprovided  inputs  for  the  policy  matrix  on  governance  and  the  financial  sector,  and \nparticipated  in  key  meetings.  Natin  Patel,  Principal  Project  Management  Specialist, \nSAID;  Hasan Masood, Transport Specialist, SAID; and Najeeb Jung, Senior Energy \nSpecialist,  SAID,  visited  Kabul  at  various  times  during  the  Fact-Finding Mission on \nother  mission  travel,  provided  valuable  inputs  to  the  Mission  on  the  transport  and \nenergy sections of the policy matrix, and participated in key meetings.  Jouko Sarvi, \nEducation  Specialist,  SASS;  and  Leah  Gutierrez,  Project  Economist,  SASS,  also \njoined  the  Mission  at  various  intervals  while  on  other  mission  travel,  and  provided \ninputs  for  the  main  text  on  the  social  sectors  and  participated  in  key  meetings. \nFinally,  Donneth  Walton,  Rural  Development  Specialist,  SAAE,  also  joined  the \nMission  during  26  August\u20133  September  while  on  other  mission  travel  and  provided \ninputs for the main text on the agriculture sector and participated in key meetings. \n\n\u2022  Consultations  with  H.E.  Ashraf  Ghani  Ahmadzai  on    the  sidelines  of  Afghanistan \nReconstruction  Steering  Group  meetings  in  Paris  (10  July  2002)  and  Washington, \nDC  (26  September  2002),  and  the  Afghanistan  Reconstruction  Implementation \nGroup Meeting in Kabul (14 October 2002). \n\n\u2022  Management Review Meeting (MRM): 17 September 2002. \n\n\u2022  Staff Review Committee Meeting/2nd MRM: 23 October 2002. \n\n\u2022  Loan Negotiations: 5-6 November 2002. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n73\n\nIn  formulating  the  program,  ADB  has  followed  a  process-based approach with intense \n3. \nstakeholder consultation. There is considerable understanding within Afghanistan of the issues \nimpeding  reconstruction  and  development.
