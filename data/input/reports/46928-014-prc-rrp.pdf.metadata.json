This  has  not  solved  the \nproblem of heavy congestion in many cities because demand for road space has far outstripped \nsupply despite these large expansion programs. Rapid growth in motor vehicles has also made \nair  pollution  a  major  problem.  The  large,  dense  concentrations  of  motor  vehicles  and  their \nemissions  in  relatively  small  areas  have  raised  air  pollution  in  many  urban  centers  to  levels \ncommonly  considered  harmful  to  human  health.  The  fine  particles  often  associated  with \nvehicular  emissions  can  increase  morbidity  and  premature  mortality.  As  a  result,  the  national \nand municipal governments have agreed that the development of public transport is needed to \navert  a potential  transport  crisis  in the  PRC\u2019s  urban areas.  By  encouraging  urban residents to \nshift from the use of private cars to public transport, governments can alleviate congestion and \nair  pollution,  including  the  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases  (GHGs)  that  contribute  to  global \nclimate change. More and better public transport will also directly benefit the poor, who depend \nmore  heavily  than  other  income  groups  on  public  transport  and  often  suffer  from  inadequate \nservices.  \n\nSince  2006,  the  national  and  local  governments  have  made  the  promotion  of  public \n3. \ntransport  a  strategic  priority  and  have  increased  their  efforts  to  providing  flexible,  low-cost, \nefficient  bus  transport.  Many  cities  have  set  ambitious  targets  for  replacing  and  adding  to \nexisting bus fleets. Some provide generous subsidies to bus operators to partly offset the high \nupfront capital costs of new vehicles. Increasingly, local governments are also promoting clean \nbuses  by  building  the  compressed  natural  gas  (CNG)  and  liquefied  natural  gas  (LNG)  fueling \nstations and electric bus charging stations needed to run them and providing financial incentives \nto encourage the switch from high emission vehicles.  \n\n4. \nThis  expansion  of  clean  bus  transport  has  been  limited  by  significant  financing \nconstraints, however. Local bus operators typically have high debt\u2013asset ratios and, without the \ngovernment subsidies they receive, would operate at a loss.3 They are also subject to significant \nrefinancing  risks  because  they  rely  on  bank  loans  with  terms  of  1\u20133  years  to  finance  bus \npurchases.  Banks  are  also  usually  unwilling  or  unable  to  approve  the  large  amounts  of  credit \nneeded to meet the operators\u2019 ambitious plans to add new buses and replace existing fleets.  \n\n5. \nFinancial leasing can be an effective way to supplement bank finance and address this \nfunding  bottleneck.  Leasing  allows  bus  operators  to  tap  additional  financing  that  has  longer \ntenors  and  potentially  more  competitive  rates  than  bank  loans.  Leasing  also  allows  a  more \n\n                                                \n1  A clean bus is defined as a bus that meets the  emission standards of Euro III equivalent and falls within at least \none of the following categories: (i) buses running on cleaner fuel such as compressed or liquefied natural gas, and \nbiomethane;  (ii)  \u2015energy-efficient  and  new-energy  buses\u2016  as  defined  by  the  national  government  of  the  PRC \n(currently including hybrid buses with fuel-saving rates of more than 10%, battery-only electric buses, and fuel-cell \nelectric buses); and (iii) buses that meet the most advanced emission standards of Euro IV equivalent or above. \nEuro III and Euro IV are European emission standards that define the acceptable limits for exhaust emissions of \nvehicles. \n\n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  Bus fares in the PRC are regulated and typically set at very low levels (e.g., a cash fare of CNY1 per trip, with up to \n\n50% discount if an integrated circuit card is used). \n\n\f2 \n\n8. \n\n9. \n\nB. \n\n11. \n\n12. \n\n13. \n\nefficient  use  of  funds. 4  These  benefits  can  help  operators  improve  their  overall  financial \nperformance.  For  their  part, financial  leasing  companies (FLCs)  are  being  attracted  to the  bus \nindustry  by  the  strong  government  support  for  public  transport  development.  They  are  further \ncomforted by their ownership rights over the vehicles under lease. Due to strong demand from \nbus  operators,  many  of  the  PRC\u2019s  FLCs  expect  2012\u20132017  to  be  a  golden  period  for  bus \nleasing and have made aggressive plans to expand into the market.  \n\n6. \nThe financial leasing industry in the PRC has grown exponentially in recent years. The \ntotal  value  of  new  lease  contracts  increased  from  $0.9  billion  in  2001  to  $63.7  billion  in  2010. \nDespite this rapid growth, the industry is still in a relatively early stage of development. Market \npenetration was only 3.8% in 2010, compared with an average rate of 13.8% in the world's 10 \nother  largest  financial  leasing  markets.  To  sustain  its  rapid  growth  and  fulfill  its  potential  to \nbecome  the  second  most  important  source  of  financing  in the  PRC  after  bank  credit,  financial \nleasing, which is a capital intensive industry but lacks a deposit base, will need access to long-\nterm funding. Many FLCs are constrained by their limited access to the capital markets and to \nlong-term bank loans. This results in serious mismatches between the maturities of their assets \nand their liabilities.5 \n\n7. \nThe  program  will  offer  long-term  funding  to  up  to  five  FLCs  to  support  the  leasing  of \nbuses  running  on  cleaner  fuel,  hybrid  buses  with  fuel-saving  rates  of  more  than  10%,  electric \nbuses, and conventional buses that meet the most advanced emission standard.6 The program \nwill also fund information technology (IT) systems that increase the fleet operating efficiency of \nurban, suburban, and intercity bus services.  \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information.  \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\n10. \nADB  will  assess  the  funding  needs  of  each  participating  FLC  borrower  and  tailor  each \nloan  to  the  company\u2019s  individual  circumstances.  By  providing  long-term  funding  that  is \nearmarked for financing the leases of clean buses, ADB will help promote a shift from private to \npublic transport in the PRC. The funding will also mitigate the participant FLCs\u2019 risks of maturity \nmismatches  and  will  diversify  their  sources  of  funding.  The  program  will  be  ADB\u2019s  first \nnonsovereign loan program to support sustainable transport in the PRC. \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information.  \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\n14. \nNational  statistics  also  show  a  high  demand  for  clean  buses.  As  of  December  2011, \n152,000  CNG  and  LNG  buses  were  operating  in  the  PRC,  more  than  one-third  of  the  total \nnumber  worldwide.7 According  to  data  compiled  by  an  industry  research  center,8 5,541  CNG \nbuses  were  sold  in  the  PRC  in  2011.  In  January\u2013June  2012,  sales  totaled  3,813,  a  55.2% \n\n                                                \n4  Unlike  the  structure  for  short-term  bank  loans,  which  have  bullet  repayments,  the  repayment  structure  under  a \nlease  contract  is  typically  mortgage-style  and,  therefore,  better  suited  to  good  cash  flow  management  by  bus \noperators. \n\n5  Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) provides further information on the \n\nurban transport sector and the financial leasing industry. \n\n6  Well maintained and state-of-the-art diesel buses are comparable in energy efficiency to electric buses, especially \n\nwhen the electricity being used is produced by coal-fired power plants. \n\n7  NGV Communication Group. 2012.

Beijing. \n\n\f3 \n\nincrease over the same period in 2011. In 2011, 3,022 LNG buses were sold in the PRC, and \nsales totaled 1,332 buses in January-April 2012, a 93% increase from the same period in 2011. \n\n15. \nThree factors have contributed to this strong sales growth. First, the price of natural gas \nhas remained relatively low, which has kept the costs of operating CNG and LNG buses 30%\u2013\n40% lower than those of running diesel buses. Second, the extra cost of purchasing natural gas \nbuses rather than comparable diesel vehicles is relatively small\u2014about $3,000 for CNG buses \nand  $10,000  for  LNG  buses.  In  addition,  these  differences  are  often  covered  by  augmented \nsubsidies  from  local  governments.9 Finally,  the  number  of  CNG  and  LNG  fueling  stations  has \nbeen  increasing  significantly  and  this  trend  is  expected  to  continue.  During  the  2011\u20132015 \ntwelfth Five-Year Plan period, the number of CNG stations in the PRC is projected to rise from \n2,500 to 5,000. LNG stations are to rise in number from 300 to 2,000. \n\n16.  Market  demand  for  hybrid  and  electric  buses  is  also  very  strong  and  has  greatly \nbenefited from strong government support. In January 2009, three ministries10 and the National \nDevelopment  and  Reform  Commission  (NDRC)  launched  a  joint  pilot  program  that  offered \nsubsidies of CNY600,000 for each purchase of a fuel-cell electric bus, CNY500,000 per battery-\nonly electric bus, and up to CNY420,000 per hybrid bus, depending on the battery type and fuel \nsavings  rate.11 By  July  2010,  25  cities  were  participating  in  the  program,  which  aimed  to  spur \nthe  introduction  of  24,220  hybrid  or  electric  buses  in  these  cities  by  the  end  of  2012.  In  the \nprogram\u2019s  first  year  (2009),  3,001  of  the  buses  were  sold,  an  increase  of  285%  from  779  in \n2008. A total of 5,623 of the buses were sold in 2011, bringing cumulative sales for 2009\u20132011 \nto 14,491.12 \n\n17. \nThis  pilot  program  is  expected  to  expand,  which  will  help  keep  the  demand  for  hybrid \nand  electric  buses  strong.  In  April  2012,  the  PRC\u2019s  State  Council  issued  the  Energy  Efficient \nand  New  Energy  Vehicle  Industry  Development  Plan,  2012\u20132020,  which  set  a  sales  target  of \n500,000 hybrid and electric vehicles for 2012-2015 and 5 million for 2012-2020. To reach these \ntargets,  annual  sales  need  to  average  120,000  per  annum  during  2012\u20132015.  Assuming  that \nbuses account for 10% of these overall sales,13 and the average price per bus is CNY900,000, \nannual  sales  of  hybrid  and  electric  buses  would  average  CNY10.8  billion  over  the  2012\u20132015 \nperiod.  To  support  the  State  Council  plan,  the  three  ministries  and  the  NDRC  extended  their \npilot  program  to  all  cities  in  the  PRC  in  September  2012.  The  program  will  now  provide \nsubsidies of up to CNY420,000 per bus for the purchase of up to 5,000 hybrid buses. \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\nFLCs  participating  in  the  program  are  expected  to  comply  with  the  requirements \n19. \nimposed  by  their  PRC  regulators.

Subject  to  demand,  up  to  10%  of  loan  proceeds  per  borrower  can  be  used  to \nfinance  the  leasing  of  IT  and  management  systems  that  will  increase  bus  fleet  operating \nefficiency. (This sentence has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information.) \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information.  \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\n24. \nThe program will seek to mobilize commercial cofinancing of at least $100 million and up \nto $200 million in the form of parallel loans from other development finance institutions, specialty \nfunds,  and  commercial  banks. 15  (This  sentence  has  been  redacted  due  to  commercially \nsensitive information.) \n\n25. \nThe  program  is  expected  to  be  supported  by  an  associated  ADB  technical  assistance \n(TA)  grant  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  bus  operators.  The  TA  will  include  development  of \ninformation  resources  and  training  materials  aimed  at  maximizing  the  service  performance  of \nthe  bus  fleets  through  the  proper  selection  of  bus  types,  optimization  of  fleet  operations,  a \ntraining  program  on  driving  in  an  eco-conscious  way,  advice  on  maintenance,  and  assistance \nwith management reporting and IT systems.16 \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nADB adds value to  the program in the following ways: \n(i) \n\nADB  will  provide  critical  long-term  finance  and  help  leverage  cofinancing.  This \nwill help address current funding constraints in the financial leasing industry and \npromote the development of the clean bus leasing business in the PRC. \nADB,  through  its  contacts  with  provincial  and  local  governments,  is  in  a unique \nposition  to  help  the  leasing  companies  reach  potential  clients.  So far,  ADB  has \nintroduced  five  public  transport  operators  in  the  cities  of  Wuhan,  Xi\u2019an,  and \nKunming  to  leasing  companies,  as  well  as  one  transport  software  system \ndeveloper based in Shanghai. \nADB recognizes and is responsive to the technical and operational needs of bus \noperators.  The  program  is  expected  to  be  supported  by  an  associated  TA  to \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n                                                \n14 The borrowing entity for ADB\u2019s loan can be the selected FLC, its parent, or a special funding vehicle that is covered \nby  appropriate  guarantees  and/or  security  arrangements.  The  program  limit  will  be  $275  million  and/or  the  CNY \nequivalent,  with  the  CNY  loan  balance  to  be  determined  at  or  about  the  time  of  each  loan  signing,  using  the \nexchange rate at or about the time of the relevant loan signing date. \n\n15 ADB  will  introduce  the  program  and  the  participating  FLCs  to  potential  cofinancing  partners  and  share  due \ndiligence materials with these partners. The participating FLCs will negotiate financing terms separately with each \nlender. \n\n16 The TA  will be processed separately, pending confirmation of funding sources. Funding of up to $2.5 million has \nbeen sought from the Global Environment Facility. If the application is not successful, funding of up to $1 million \nwill be sought from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund for TA with a smaller scope. \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nenhance  the  capacity  of  bus  operators  in  the  selection,  fleet  operation, \nmanagement, and maintenance of clean buses. \n\nRisks \n\nD. \n\n30. \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nA. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImpact \n\n31. \nThe  program\u2019s  impact  will  be  an  increase  in  clean  bus  transport  services  in  the  PRC. \nThe  program  is  fully  in  line  with  the  multilateral  development  banks\u2019  Rio+20  (United  Nations \nConference  on  Sustainable  Development)  commitment  to  provide  $175  billion  for  transport  in \ndeveloping countries during 2012-2022. By financing the lease of clean buses, the program will \nsupport the expansion of a low-cost, flexible mode of public transport. Although these benefits \nwill  not  be  measured,  the  expansion  of  clean  bus  services  under  the  program  is  expected  to \ndirectly  benefit  millions  of  low-income  commuters,  improve  air  quality,  and  reduce  GHG \nemissions. 17  \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n32. \nThe program outcome will be an increase in the deployment of clean buses in the urban, \nsuburban,  and  intercity  public  transport  markets. 18 The  program  is  expected  to  finance  the \nleasing  of  at  least  5,000  clean  buses  by  2018.  From  2019,  the  program  will  help  avoid  GHG \nemissions of 1.31 million tons per annum through a shift from the use of private cars to the use \nof public transport and through the use of low emission buses.19 The program will result in 420 \nmillion vehicle-kilometers of service operation by clean buses per annum in the PRC.20 \n\nThe program output will be expanded clean bus leasing operations of FLCs in the public \n\n3. \n\nOutput \n\n33. \ntransport market.  \n\nB. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 \n\n34. \nStrategy  2020  emphasizes  ADB\u2019s  support  for  environmentally  sustainable  growth  and \nthe expansion of ADB\u2019s promotion of sound environmental management. 21 It also seeks to meet \nthe  region\u2019s  growing  energy  demands  by  helping  DMCs  develop  environment-friendly \ntechnologies.  A  key  action  is  to  mitigate  climate  change  by  moving  DMCs  on  to  low-carbon \ngrowth paths by (i) improving energy efficiency, (ii) expanding the use of clean energy sources, \n(iii)  reducing  fugitive  GHG  emissions,  (iv)  modernizing  public  transport  systems,  and  (v) \narresting deforestation. The program is fully consistent with these strategic objectives. \n                                                \n17 The  environmental  impacts  will  be  achieved  through  a  shift  from  travel  in  private  vehicles  to  public  transport, \nadoption  of  clean  fuel,  energy-efficient  and  low  emission  vehicles,  and  deployment  of  IT  systems  to  help  bus \nnetworks operate more efficiently.  \n\n18 Subject  to  demand,  the  program  may  also  support  wider  adoption  of  IT  systems  that  increase  the  operating \n\nefficiency of bus fleets. \n\n19 The use of each clean bus is estimated to avoid the emission of 0.75 tons of greenhouse gas (CO2 equivalent) per \nday  on  average.  Assuming  350  operating  days  per  year  per  bus,  5,000  buses  avoid  1.31  million  tons  of \ngreenhouse gas emissions (CO2 equivalent) per annum. \n\n20 Assuming average speed of 20 kilometers per hour; 12 operating hours per day, and 350 operating days per year. \n21 ADB.  2008.  Strategy  2020:  The  Long-Term  Strategic  Framework  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  2008\u20132020. \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nFinancial  sector  development  is  one  of  ADB\u2019s  five  core  areas  of  specialization  under \n35. \nStrategy  2020.  Development  of  the  finance  sectors  of  DMCs  is  seen  as  essential  to  ensuring \nsustainable private sector-led economic growth. Under Strategy 2020, ADB seeks to strengthen \nits  support  to  the  finance  sector  at  the  regional  and  national  levels  by  helping  to  develop \nfinancial infrastructure, institutions, and products and services. The program will provide critical \nlong-term  financing  to  support  the  nascent  leasing  industry  in  the  PRC,  while  promoting \ninnovative  financing  mechanisms  for  sustainable  growth  and  the  development  of  the  capital \nmarkets.  \n\n2.  Consistency with Country Strategy \n\n36. \nThe  program  is  fully  in  line  with  the  priorities  of  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy, \n2011\u20132015  for  the  PRC. 22  It  is  aligned,  in  particular,  with  the  strategy\u2019s  emphasis  on \nmainstreaming  climate  change  considerations  and  support  for  green  finance.23 The  program \nsupports financial sector development, one of the private sector operational focuses identified in \nthe country partnership strategy. It also supports the implementation of the PRC's twelfth Five-\nYear Plan, which accentuates resource conservation and environmental protection and attaches \ntop priority to improving energy efficiency, reducing pollution emissions, and developing cleaner \nand renewable energy. \n\n3.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n\nTransport  sector  development.  The  program  fully  supports  ADB\u2019s  Sustainable \n37. \nTransport Initiative (STI), which focuses on creating transport systems that are accessible, safe, \naffordable,  and  environment-friendly.  According to  the  STI  operational  plan,  ADB  should focus \non  roles  where  it  can  significantly  add  value  to  sustainable transport  activities.  To  optimize  its \ncontribution,  ADB  should  design  its  operations  to  build  on  ADB-wide  and  international  best \npractices in sustainable transport and channel its financing to projects and activities where ADB \ninvolvement will result in increased sustainability. ADB assistance should help DMCs overcome \nsector  obstacles  to  wider  adoption  of  sustainable  transport.  Based  on  these  principles,  urban \ntransport  is  identified  as  an  area in which  ADB  should  scale up  support for sustainability.  The \nSTI operational plan also emphasizes private sector participation and mobilization of additional \nfinance.  \n\nFinancial  sector  development.  Financial  sector  development  is  a  focus  of  ADB's \n38. \nPrivate  Sector  Development  Strategy 24  and  Enhanced  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy, 25  which \nregard  economic  growth,  stimulated  by  private  sector  investment,  as  a  key  factor  in  reducing \npoverty.  The  program  is  consistent  with  the  overall  sector  strategy.  It  will  help  develop  the \nPRC\u2019s financial sector, give public transport operators better access to financial services, make \nprivate sector development in the country more sustainable, and contribute to ADB\u2019s mission to \nhelp its DMCs reduce poverty and improve living conditions and quality of life. \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\n39. \nThe  program  is  classified  as  category  FI  (treated  as  C)  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009)  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples  impacts. \n\n                                                \n22 ADB. 2012.
