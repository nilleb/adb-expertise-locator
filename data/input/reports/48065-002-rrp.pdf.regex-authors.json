THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Public Sector Enterprises Reform Program, and (ii) proposed \npolicy-based loans to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (the government) for subprogram 1 of the \nPublic Sector Enterprises Reform Program.1 \n \n2.  The  proposed  program  will  support  the  efforts  of  the  government  to  improve  the \nperformance  of  public  sector  enterprises  (PSEs)  by  improving  corporate  governance  and \naccountability, and reducing PSE contingent liabilities. The program will facilitate creating fiscal \nspace for critical development expenditures. The two subprograms will be carried out during \n2016\u20132018.2  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Pakistan\u2019s nationalization program in the 1970s led to significant government ownership \nof companies and parastatal bodies across all economic sectors. In the 1990s, the Government \nof  Pakistan  recognized  the  limitations  of  nationalization  policies  and  commenced  with  the \nprivatization of selected entities, which has been somewhat successful so far. Most significant \nwas  the  massive  privatization  of  the  banking  sector  in  which  government  ownership  was \nreduced from more than 80% to less than 20% during 2000\u20132004, as well as the privatization of \nthe Karachi Electricity Supply Company in 2005. However, the government recognizes that \nvested  stakeholder  interests,  particularly  those  of  the  employees  of  PSEs,  require \nimprovements in the operating environment and governance of PSEs before privatization can \nbe realized. Currently, conditions for privatization are most advanced in the financial sector, \nwhile those in the power sector distribution companies, industry (Pakistan Steel Mills), and \naviation (Pakistan International Airlines [PIA]) need substantial upfront reforms and investments, \nas well as efficient management of stakeholders\u2019 interests, before privatization can materialize. \nFinally, parastatals such as Pakistan Railways are not candidates for privatization but require \nalternative approaches for improving their efficiency, service delivery, and asset management, \nas well as reducing contingent liabilities of the government created by (i) inappropriately skilled \nstaffing,  (ii)  maintenance  of  noncore  operations,  (iii)  large  unfunded  pension  liabilities,  (iv) \nlimited revenue generation, and (v) issues in financial management and internal controls of its \noperations. \n \n4.  The  federal  government  owns  191  PSEs  (comprising  176  companies,  8  financial \ninstitutions, and 7 federal authorities), whose assets were estimated at PRs9,400 billion in \nFY2014 and who employ more than 420,000 workers (of which Pakistan Railways employs \n78,000). \n \n5.  In FY2014, 142 of the 191 PSEs provided income statements, of which 56 reported \nlosses despite budget transfers. Reported financial information needs to be treated with caution, \nhowever, as many entities do not have appropriate accounting policies and audit and internal \ncontrol procedures in place. The absence of timely and reliable financial statements points to \nthe need for reforms to systematically enforce improvement of PSE financial management and \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance (TA) for the Public Sector \nEnterprises Program (TA 8796-PAK, $500,000). The TA will remain active until December 2016 to support design, \nmonitoring, and capacity development.  \n ", "2 \ninternal controls, and to improve corporate governance under the supervision of the Securities \nand Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP). \n \n6.  While some PSEs report profits, most PSEs are poor performers reporting marginal \nprofits or losses. As a result, PSEs rely on regular discretionary fiscal transfers and sovereign \ncredit guarantees to maintain their operations. PIA, Pakistan Steel Mills, power distribution \ncompanies, and Pakistan Railways are major recipients of such transfers. In FY2016, fiscal \nallocation to support PSE day-to-day operations (subsidies and other transfers) constituted 65% \nof  overall  budget  allocations  to  the  PSEs,  severely  limiting  critical  capital  development \nexpenditures to improve PSE efficiency. \n \n7.  Recognizing the importance of reducing the fiscal deficit and government borrowings, \nsince FY2014, the government has imposed a severe cut in transfers to PSEs. As a result, total \nbudgetary transfers to PSEs (including support for capital investment) declined from 3.1% of \ngross domestic product (GDP) in FY2012 to only 1.5% of GDP in FY2015. While this hard \nbudget constraint is useful to boost the accountability and efficiency of PSEs, it unfortunately \naffects the government\u2019s ability to invest in important capital projects to expand and improve \nservice delivery. \n \n8.  Establishing sound corporate governance, disclosure, and performance management in \nline with commercial principles is a critical element to improve PSEs\u2019 accountability for service \ndelivery and revenue generation. Such measures must be accommodated by the government \nthrough (i) phasing out budget transfers to support operating expenditures; and (ii) providing an \nadequate  increase  in  development  budget  funding  to  build  up  provisions  for  (a)  funding \ncontingent liabilities related to PSE employee pensions and voluntary separation schemes, and \n(b) facilitating other critical development expenditures to improve service delivery and revenue \ngeneration. \n \n9.  While most PSEs such as PIA can operate well under commercial corporate governance \nprinciples,  a  few  PSEs  require  in  addition,  incorporating  social  dimensions  of  access  and \naffordability in delivering their services. For Pakistan Railways, it is equally important to provide \nreliable commercial freight and passenger services across Pakistan. While Pakistan Railways \ncarried more than 70% of Pakistan\u2019s freight traffic in 1960, its contribution declined to a marginal \n4% in 2015, substantially adding to the congestion of the highway network.3 Obsolescence of \nhuman  resources  and  procedures,  and  inadequate  HR  capacity  have  limited  the  overall \nperformance of Pakistan Railways. The absence of periodic modernization of railway systems \nnecessitated manual labor which resulted in a large workforce (78,000) that requires $375 \nmillion on pay and pensions  annually (about 70% of financial resources). This has left very little \nroom for urgently needed expansion of railway corridors, and upgrading of the freight and \npassenger services.  \n \n10.  Prioritizing reform challenges. The government is still in the midst of identifying the \nstrategic, policy, technical, and financial requirements of the PSE reform agenda.4 There are \n                                                \n3  Freight wagons loaded declined sharply from 1,159,632 in 1960\u20131965 (average) to only 176,155 in FY2015. \nSimilarly, the annual average number of passengers carried (in thousand) reached its peak during 1975\u20131980 at \n145,710. The trend was a declining trend with a revival in 2005 before dropping to 52,951 in FY2015. The ordinary \nworking expenses to gross earnings ratio (in percent) increased from 60% in 1955\u20131960 (average) to 132% in \nFY2015. \n4  Pakistan Vision 2025 envisages an efficient, globally competitive private sector supported by the government as a \nfacilitator, enabler, and regulator of private initiative and enterprise, rather than an overarching direct producer of \ngoods and services. In alignment with Vision 2025, the government is implementing an ambitious economic reform \n ", "3 \nsome important reforms and related challenges that need to be addressed up front to achieve \ntangible results in this process, including targeted privatization of selected PSEs. Two major \nchallenges exist: \n(i)  For PSE reform, Pakistan lacks a comprehensive strategy to (a) help the different \ngovernment agencies\u2014including the Privatization Commission, SECP, Ministry \nof  Finance  (MOF),  line  departments,  and  the  PSE  boards\u2014coordinate \nresponsibilities  and  objectives;  (b)  implement  good  corporate  governance \nprinciples  effectively;  (c)  articulate  crucial  guiding  principles,  such  as \ntransparency and consistency, on issues related to labor (including retirement \nbenefits); (d) facilitate constituency building for critical reforms in PSEs with the \nhelp of an effective communications strategy;5 and (e) monitor and evaluate PSE \nperformance. \n(ii)  The implementation of PSE reforms cannot be done without incurring substantial \nadjustment costs, which is a major challenge in Pakistan\u2019s current fiscal context.  \nThese  costs  need to  be  planned for  and  addressed  during  the  PSE reform \nprocess. Thus, identification of reforms and selection of PSEs will need to be \ndone very carefully, given the government\u2019s priorities. \n \n11.  Based on diagnostic studies and consultations, the program specifies three areas for \nsupport in setting the performance of federal PSEs on a sustainable path. The significance of \nthe selected reform areas in the context of the program\u2019s overarching goal is explained below. \n(i)  Policies to address labor issues and communication strategy introduced, \nmonitoring  system  designed,  and  costs  and  benefits  ascertained.  The \ngovernment  has  an  ambitious  PSE  reform  program,  supported  by  multiple \ndevelopment  partners.6 However,  very  little  has  been  done  so  far  to  build \nconstituencies  for  PSE  reforms.  Similarly,  some  key  reforms  need  to  be \nintroduced to safeguard labors\u2019 interest. This reform area will promote maximum \nlevels  of  transparency,  effective  communication,  strategic  consistency,  and \ncompliance with labor safeguards. It is also important to carry out a study to \ndetermine costs and benefits of the program, which will help the government to \ncarry out an effective public awareness campaign. \n(ii)  Financial transparency, monitoring, and corporate governance in  public \nsector  enterprises  improved.  Many  PSEs  are  in  poor  financial  condition \nprimarily due to weak corporate governance. Various good corporate governance \ninitiatives will need to take place to make PSEs financially viable. The extent and \ndepth of the corporate restructuring work will depend on the conditions of each \nPSE, sector rules, and circumstances. This reform area is the most challenging \nin the PSE reform agenda. It will promote the implementation of restructuring \n                                                                                                                                                       \nagenda to stabilize the balance of payments and put the country on a different, more sustainable growth path. \nVision 2025 also affirms the government\u2019s commitment to convert loss-making PSEs into profit-making entities \nthrough  a  combination  of  restructuring  and  partial  and  outright  privatization.  The  government  is  currently \nimplementing the reform agenda with the help of development partners. Government of Pakistan; Ministry of \nPlanning, Development & Reform. 2014. Pakistan 2025: One Nation\u2013One Vision. Islamabad. \n5  The government took a major step in April 2016 in its endeavor to privatize loss-making large PSEs. PIA, with an \naccumulated loss of $1.9 billion (as of 30 September 2015), was turned into a public limited company on 11 April \n2016. However, the government will continue to retain a 51% share, indicating that management control will remain \nwith the government. The other important initiative was corporatization of the State Life Insurance Corporation of \nPakistan. These initiatives show the commitment of the government in PSE reforms, especially at a time when \npolitical consensus-building on privatization has been extremely difficult. \n6  The Cabinet Committee on Privatization approved on 3 October 2013 a plan to sequence the capital market and \npre-privatization  restructuring  for  39  PSEs:  11  PSEs  for  block  sales,  25  PSEs  for strategic  private sector \nparticipation, and 3 PSEs for restructuring (Pakistan Railways, PIA, and Pakistan Steel Mills) for restructuring. \n ", "4 \nefforts  as  well  as  sustainable  improvement  in  PSEs\u2019  compliance  with  the \nCorporate Governance Rules (CGRs) 2013 of the SECP.7 \n(iii)  Restructuring and reform of selected public sector enterprises initiated. \nGiven the limited capacity of various regulatory agencies, it is imperative to \nlaunch a restructuring program for those PSEs that will yield better results in \nterms of net fiscal transfers from the federal budget to the federal PSEs. This is \nespecially true given the hard budget constraint of the government.8 The primary \nfocus is to improve service delivery by these PSEs in a cost-effective manner. \nHowever,  successful  restructuring  of  these  large  PSEs  will  depend  on  the \ngovernment\u2019s commitment and a careful prioritization of reforms. \n \n12.  Programmatic  approach. In  a  program  of this  nature, there  will  be  several  policy \nactions that are politically sensitive and will require adequate time at the preparatory stage \nincluding  constituency  building  for  reforms.  Therefore,  it  is  critical  that  those  reforms  are \nidentified  properly  and  sequenced  logically  over  subsequent  subprograms  for  effective \nimplementation. Moreover, some of these policy actions are also supported by other policy \nactions included in the program (e.g., public awareness campaign), requiring consistency in \ntiming of various policy actions under the overall program. A programmatic approach facilitates \nchronological  sequencing  of  reforms  over  an  adequate  period  in  a  flexible  framework.  A \nprogrammatic approach also facilitates changes in the proposed policy actions if there are \nexogenous shocks. \n \n13.  Development coordination. The proposed program is part of a well-coordinated multi-\ndonors package for PSE reforms in Pakistan. International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a \nthree-year extended arrangement under Extended Fund Facility (EFF) in September 20139 and \nthe World Bank approved two development policy credits in April 2014 and in May 2015. These \ntwo programs also support, among others, some reforms (including privatization) relevant for \nPSEs in Pakistan. The program will complement and carry forward similar reforms initiated by \nother development partners. \n \n14.  Lessons learned. The success of PSE reform critically depends on public awareness of \nthe reform process and benefits. Strong government commitment and adequate support from all \nthe stakeholders are the two important prerequisites for a successful PSE reform program. \nStrong government commitment is one of the important prerequisites for successful program \nlending, especially in Pakistan. Thus, setting realistic policy actions is crucial to ensure the \ngovernment\u2019s commitment.10 Similar lessons were also identified for the World Bank\u2019s banking \nsector restructuring and privatization project and program.11As explained in para. 10 (i), some \n                                                \n7  Government of Pakistan. 2013. SECP. Islamabad. \n8  This hard budget constraint is manifested in two ways in the context of the program: (i) the government is forced to \ncut financing of various developmental projects, including PSEs; and (ii) the government is unable to initiate \nadditional reforms that have cost implications. \n9  The IMF program aims, first and foremost, at macroeconomic stabilization. This will require tightening on both the \nfiscal and monetary sides in order to put the fiscal position on a sustainable path and reduce inflation. Beyond \nmacroeconomic stabilization, the program also includes structural reforms, especially privatization of some federal \nPSEs with the aim of increasing economic efficiency (https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2013/pr13322.htm). \n10 Independent Evaluations Department. 2013.

These lessons are related to \npublic awareness campaign, unfunded pension liabilities, and other important issues pertaining \nto PSE workers.  \n \n15.  ADB\u2019s value addition.12 The value additions of the proposed program are manifold: (i) \nidentify critical reforms for PSEs to support the government\u2019s reform agenda;13 (ii) facilitate \ntargeting of reform related expenditures and provide partial financing; (iii) complement other \ndevelopment partners\u2019 initiatives in this area, resulting in enhanced development coordination \nwhile designing the program; (iv) provide technical assistance support for capacity building, \ninstitution development and PPPs; and (v) continue to support under ADB\u2019s future project \ninterventions,  especially  in  transport  and  energy  sectors  for  consolidation  of  reforms.  As \nexplained in para. 10 (ii), the government will not be able to initiate some critical reforms that will \nhave major cost implications given the ongoing fiscal consolidation drive unless ADB provides \ntechnical, strategic, and financial handholding support under this program. \n \n16.  Alignment with ADB\u2019s strategy. The program is part of the 2016 pipeline in the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy, 2015\u20132019 for Pakistan.14 It will provide \ncritical help to the government to address the significant policy challenges and adjustment costs \nof this agenda (para. 10). It also complements ADB\u2019s public-private partnership initiatives in \nPakistan and the Railways Investment Program, which is under preparation.15 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n17.  The impact will be reduced net fiscal transfers to PSEs from the federal budget. The \noutcome will be improved PSE performance. \n \nC.  Outputs \n18.  The outputs are as follows: \n(i)  Output  1:  Policies  to  address  labor  issues  and  communication  strategy \nintroduced, monitoring system designed, and costs and benefits ascertained. \nUnder  subprogram  1,  the  government  will  design  the  critical  communication \nstrategy16 and  policies  to  address  important  issues  pertaining  to  workers\u2019 \nvoluntary separation scheme, pensions, and training. Under subprogram 2, the \ngovernment  will  start  implementing  the  strategy  and  policies.  One  critical \ncomponent is to design and initiate funding of a retirement cost fund of selected \npower distribution companies under subprogram 2. This will be an important \nreform  to  address  the  financial  problem  of  unfunded  pension  (and  other \n                                                \n12 ADB\u2019s value addition (accessible from the list of supplementary documents in Appendix 2). \n13 Many policy actions under this program will eventually facilitate strategic private participation in selected PSEs \ninitiated by the government under the IMF program. \n14 ADB. 2015. Country Partnership Strategy: Pakistan, 2015-2019. Manila. \n15 A TA loan was also provided in 2014 (ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of \nDirectors: Proposed Technical Assistance Loan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Public Sector Enterprise \nReforms Project. Manila. [Loan 3214-PAK, approved 4 December 2014]) to support capacity development related \nto PSE reforms. However, due to availability of grant funds, the loan has not been utilized.  \n16 Neglecting consensus building among stakeholders will certainly weaken a project\u2019s opportunity for success and \nsustainability if it is dealing with privatization. When preparing for privatization initiatives, strong efforts to engage \npolitical parties, managers, unions, workers, civil servants, business leaders, potential investors, national and \ninternational civil society organizations, and consumers must be initiated to inform about the program\u2019s operations \nand benefits (D. Calabrese. 2008. Strategic Communication for Privatization, Public\u2013Private Partnerships, and \nPrivate Participation in Infrastructure Projects. World Bank Working Paper. No.139. Washington, DC: World Bank). \n ", "6 \nretirement  benefit)  liabilities  of  the  power  distribution  companies.  The \ngovernment  will  also  design  an  information  technology-based  performance \nmonitoring system of PSEs and will prepare a study to determine costs and \nbenefits of the program under subprogram 2. \n(ii)  Output 2: Financial transparency, monitoring, and corporate governance in \npublic sector enterprises improved. In line with the PSE CGRs of 2013, the \nSECP issued CGR guidelines in 2013. The main policy actions under this output \nare designed to facilitate improvements in compliance with the CGR rules from \n35% in subprogram 1 to 50% under subprogram 2.17 Various policy actions such \nas  publishing  quarterly  reports,  publishing  a  list  of  noncompliant  PSEs,  and \ndesigning an effective strategy to bring all PSEs under the ambit of CGRs are \nproposed.  Policy  actions  to  promote  regular  publication  of  a  financial \nperformance report of all the PSEs, starting from FY2014, have been included \nunder output 2. An important proposal is to design a strategy to improve the level \nof  women\u2019s  representation  on  PSE  boards  under  subprogram  1,  and  to \nimplement the strategy under subprogram 2. \n(iii)  Output 3: Restructuring and reform of selected public sector enterprises \ninitiated. In support of outputs 1 and 2, Pakistan Railways will carry out the \nfollowing six policy actions under subprogram 1:  \n(a)  strengthening its internal control and audit function by appointing a chief \ninternal auditor to lead the internal audit department and designing a road \nmap for  strengthening  the  internal  audit  department,  including  a risk-\nbased audit plan; \n(b)  introducing  internationally  recognized  accounting  standards,  including \naccrual accounting; \n(c)  carrying out a detailed feasibility study on departmental restructuring and \nworkforce rationalization; \n(d)  establishing, operationalizing, and automating a database of land assets \nowned by Pakistan Railways; \n(e)  designing and implementing a strategy to facilitate private participation in \nselect railways services; and \n(f)  improving transparency in the procurement of goods and services, and \nestablishing effective internal controls. \n \n19.  There are thirteen policy actions under Subprogram 1. The proposed policy actions \nrelated to the Pakistan Railways under Subprogram 1 will be concluded under Subprogram 2,  \nand some of these actions will continue to be monitored and supported under ADB\u2019s Railways \nInvestment Program (under preparation) to achieve the end results. The other important policies \nproposed under subprogram 2 will support financial inclusion in Pakistan and will include the \ncorporatization of Postal Life Insurance, and Pakistan Post Savings Bank; and the completion of \nthe restructuring or privatization of the House Building Finance Company and SME Bank. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n20.  The  government  is  currently  in  the  midst  of  a  comprehensive  fiscal  consolidation \nexercise encompassing (i) putting the debt-to-GDP ratio on a firm downward trajectory, (ii) \n                                                \n17 Good corporate governance facilitates economic efficiency, sustainable growth, and financial stability. It also \nfacilitates companies' access to capital for long-term investment. Policy makers and regulators are faced with the \nnew challenges to adapt corporate governance frameworks to rapid changes in both the corporate and financial \nlandscape  (Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development.  G20/OECD  Principles  of  Corporate \nGovernance. http://www.oecd.org/daf/ca/principles-corporate-governance.htm). \n ", "7 \nbuilding fiscal buffers against adverse shocks and safeguarding macroeconomic stability, and \n(iii) setting the stage for sustainable and inclusive growth. The government plans to lower the \nbudget deficit (excluding grants) to 4.3% of GDP in FY2016 from 5.3% in FY2015, and then to \n3.5% in FY2017, mainly through revenue mobilization and expenditure rationalization. However, \ngiven the sluggish nature of revenue improvements over the short to medium term, the burden \nof fiscal consolidation will primarily fall on expenditure rationalization, especially development \nexpenditure.  As  a  result,  development  expenditures  and  development  loans  (primarily  for \ninvestment to augment capacity) for PSEs (including Pakistan Railways) together constituted an \naverage of nearly 0.4% of GDP during FY2012\u2013FY2015 before declining sharply in FY2016.18 \nThis is a clear illustration of a hard budget constraint and its impact on development financing, \ngiven the downward rigidity in nondiscretionary items of recurrent expenditure items (salary, \npensions, and interest). The government\u2019s support for productive investments in PSEs will need \nto be revived. This will be supported under the program. \n \n21.  It will be extremely difficult for the government to incur additional costs to carry out PSE \nreforms,  unless  expenditures  on  specific  items  are  targeted  and  partly  financed.  Strong \nexpenditure rationalization efforts will need to continue to create room for additional reform- \nrelated expenditure, to the extent it is reflected in the federal budget, within the stipulated fiscal \ndeficit targets. \n \n22.  There are four large direct items of adjustment costs that have been estimated for the \nprogram: (i) voluntary separation cost, (ii) funding of a retirement benefit fund to manage huge \nunfunded pensions and other retirement liabilities of workers, (iii) cost of vocational and other \ntraining programs, and (iv) communication cost. Total costs amounted to $1.4 billion for three \npriority power distribution companies (Faisalabad Electric Supply Company, Islamabad Electric \nSupply Company, and Lahore Electric Supply Company), of which unfunded pension liabilities \ntotaled approximately $1.2 billion (as of 30 June 2015). For fiscal prudence, these liabilities \nneed to be funded in a phased manner.19 \n \n23.  Unfunded pension risk is the risk to a company's financial condition due to underfunding \nof defined benefit pension plan. Unfunded pensions and other retirement benefits are major \nconstraints  for  timely  privatization  of  the  selected  power  distribution  companies.  Unless \naddressed  efficiently,  these  will  have  an  adverse  impact  on  the  government\u2019s  divestment \nincome from privatization. Therefore, it is proposed that the government should immediately \ncreate a retirement cost fund and encourage contribution to the fund.20 Similarly, a voluntary \nseparation scheme will remain a major adjustment cost either incurred pre-privatization or post-\nprivatization.  Putting  all  these  items  together  and  combining  them  with  the  government\u2019s \ncommitment  to  reduce  the  fiscal  deficit-to-GDP  ratio,  development  financing  needs  of \napproximately $900 million over next 2 years is foreseen. The program is expected to finance \nnearly  67%  of  this  development  financing  requirement.  Thus,  the  program  will  help  the \ngovernment to pursue, without breaching the fiscal targets, its macroeconomic reform agenda, \nincluding PSE reforms, by facilitating targeted expenditure on critical PSE-related reforms. \n \n                                                \n18 These two items together declined from PRs130 million in FY2014 to PRs113 million in FY2015 and then to PRs70 \nmillion in FY2016. \n19 These cost estimates were prepared for the program, and included under prior actions. \n20 As a comparison, Brazil initiated a huge privatization program in the 1990s. Many of its PSEs at the time did not \nhave funds to manage pension liabilities, so, given the presence of unfunded pension liabilities, the value was \ndiscounted from the price for which each PSE was sold. (R. Macedo. 2000. Privatization and the Distribution of \nAssets and Income in Brazil. Working Paper No. 14. Washington, DC: Carnegie Endowment for International \nPeace). \n ", "8 \n24.  Based on the development financing requirements of the program, ADB will provide \npolicy-based loans totaling $600 million, structured into two equal subprograms of $300 million \neach.  In  the  first  subprogram,  $200  million  will  be  financed  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources and the remaining $100 million equivalent in SDR70,873,000 from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund). The ordinary capital resources loan will have a 15-\nyear term, including a grace period of 3 years, a custom-tailored method, an annual interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions as set \nforth in the draft loan agreement (ordinary operations). Based on this, the average loan maturity \nis 10.48 years and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. The Asian Development Fund \nloan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2% per \nannum during the grace period and thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft loan agreement (special operations).  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n25.  The MOF, through its Finance Division, will be the executing agency of the proposed \nprogram. A program management unit (PMU) to be established in the Finance Division will be \nresponsible  for  overall  coordination  and  reporting  on  implementation  arrangements.  The \nFinance Division, Ministry of Railways (MOR), Pakistan Railways, the Privatization Commission, \nand the SECP will be the implementing agencies. \n \n26.  The PMU will assist the various implementing agencies during the program. It will be \nheaded by a senior government official as the program director. The PMU will be responsible for \n(i) coordinating and monitoring the program, including the policy actions; (ii) preparing and \nsubmitting  all  required  reports  to  the  Finance  Division  and  ADB;  and  (iii)  submitting  the \nnecessary statements and reports to ADB. \n \n27.  The program is expected to be implemented over 24 months from June 2016 to June \n2018.  The  implementation  period  for  subprogram  1  is  from  June  2016  to  June  2017. \nProcurement, advance contracting, and retroactive financing are not expected. The proceeds of \nthe loans will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  ADB  will  monitor  program  implementation  through  periodic \nprogress reports and will field regular missions to confirm fulfillment of policy actions under the \ntwo subprograms. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n28.  The beneficiaries will primarily be the domestic, industrial, agricultural, and commercial \nclients of public goods and services provided by PSEs, which will deliver improved services in a \ncost-effective manner. Taxpayers and recipients of government services will indirectly benefit \nfrom the reduced fiscal costs of PSEs. PSE staff are expected to benefit from a consistent and \nfair approach to retrenchment and retirement benefits, as set out in the program. \n \nA.  Economic \n29.  The beneficiaries of the program will be the people of Pakistan, who will directly benefit \nfrom the improved delivery of services. The greater ability of the government to invest in social \nand  economic  infrastructure,  resulting  from  enhanced  fiscal  space,  will  provide  greater \neconomic opportunities. In addition, the program will stimulate private sector activity by partly \nsubstituting government service commitments. The beneficial effect on federal finances will \n ", "9 \noriginate  primarily  from  three  sources:  non-debt  capital  receipts  (disinvestment  income), \nreduced fiscal transfers, and higher income from dividends.21 In addition, the government will \nreduce  its  contingent  liabilities  once  pensions  and  related  retirement  liabilities  are  funded \nappropriately. \n \nB.  Governance \n30.  The Finance Division of the MOF has better internal controls compared with other line \nministries. Governance, audit and accounting practices of the Pakistan Railways do not meet \ninternational  standards  despite  a  number  of  initiatives  introduced  recently  to  strengthen \ntransparency in procurements. Improving these practices is an integral part of the program. \n \n31.  Many PSEs do not follow the SECP\u2019s PSE CGRs. The program has introduced relevant \npolicy actions to facilitate compliance with the PSE CGRs 2013. \n \n32.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, including the Finance Division of the MOF. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n33.  The  program  will  help  the  government  reduce  the  economic  and  fiscal  costs  that \nPakistan\u2019s PSEs impose on consumers, taxpayers, and beneficiaries of social services. The \nprogram will maximize the benefits that private management and improved corporate and sector \ngovernance  can  bring  to  the  economic  efficiency  and  financial  feasibility  of  PSEs.  These \nchanges are expected to improve access to basic services such as electricity (through power \ndistribution  companies)  and  public  transportation  (through  railways).  The  PSEs  to  be \nrestructured and privatized may decrease their demand for low-skilled labor. The program will \ntherefore facilitate the development of a framework, through the targeted policy actions, to \naddress  labor  issues  related  to  retrenchment,  retirement  benefits,  and  alternative  skills \ndevelopment.  The  program  is  expected  to  indirectly  contribute  to  poverty  reduction.  The \nproposed reform measures will help to create additional fiscal space, which will facilitate higher \npublic spending on social sectors, particularly health, education, and social protection. The \nprogram has no significant gender impacts or direct benefits. However, measures related to \nPSE workers will safeguard the interests of women workers by offering training programs in \nalternative skills, if necessary. Policy measures will also support gender inclusiveness through \nenhanced women\u2019s representation in senior management positions and on PSE boards.22 \n \nD.  Safeguards \n34.  Given  the  nature  of  the  program,  all  three  safeguard  categories  (environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples) are categorized as C under the program. \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n35.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in the below table and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.23 The integrated benefits and impacts \nare expected to outweigh the costs. \n                                                \n21 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nSummary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks   Mitigating Measures \nContinued commitment of the government toward  (i) Continuous engagement by the Asian Development \nreform measures envisaged under the program is not  Bank with the government; and (ii) regular monitoring to \nsustained  help align the reforms measures with the policy initiatives \ntaken by the government \nLack of counterpart funds, especially due to ongoing  (i) Continuous engagement by the Asian Development \nfiscal consolidation initiatives, may delay some reforms  Bank with the government; and (ii) adoption of \npreemptive strategy to avoid potential bottlenecks. \nElections and political unrest may delay  Consistent and sustained engagement with the \nimplementation of the proposed reforms under  government \nsubprogram 2 \nLack of financially viable public\u2013private partnership  Adequate technical assistance support will be provided \nprojects for consideration by Pakistan Railways \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \nIV.

The government has assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 1 shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \ndocuments. \n \n37.  The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for subprogram 1, which are \nset forth  in  the  loan  agreements. The government  will  ensure  that, for  FY2017  and  each \nsubsequent fiscal year for the duration of the programmatic approach, the amount of budget \nallocation to PSEs for their development expenditures, including development loans, is at least \n0.4% of Pakistan\u2019s GDP for the same fiscal year. \n \nV.
