The  report  also  describes  the  proposed  transaction  technical  assistance  (TA)  for \nImplementation Support for the Maharashtra Rural High Voltage Distribution System Expansion \nProgram, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, will approve the transaction TA. \n \n2. \nThe  RBL  will  support  a  component  of  the  state  of  Maharashtra\u2019s  program  to  provide \naccess to efficient, reliable, and good quality power supply to new agriculture customers through \na  metered  high  voltage  distribution  system  (HVDS),  related  institutional  strengthening,  and \nenhanced awareness on HVDS and the efficient use of electricity and water for agriculture. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nlack  of \n\nStrategic Context \n\nirrigation  and  dependence  on  rainfall, \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe state economy. Maharashtra, the second most populous state in India, has a high \nannual  per  capita  income  compared  with  the  national  average.1 However,  there  is  significant \ninequality  within  Maharashtra;  the  rural  eastern  parts  of  the  state  in  particular  have  a  high \nproportion  of  the  population  living  below  the  poverty  line.2 About  half  of  the  state\u2019s  labor  force \nremains engaged in agriculture and related activities, but agriculture\u2019s share of the state\u2019s gross \ndomestic product declined from 15.3% in FY2002 to 12.2% in FY2017 as a result of small farm \nsizes, \nless-than-efficient use of electricity and water, poor storage facilities and connectivity to markets. \nMaharashtra\u2019s Vision 2030 focuses on the agriculture sector with the goals of increasing growth \nto 5% per year, and increasing agricultural productivity and farmers\u2019 incomes.3 These would be \nachieved by reducing the cost of cultivation; increasing the area under irrigation; providing access \nto a reliable power supply; promoting distributed solar power, electricity, water conservation and \nagriculture value chains; and improving access to markets. \n \nPower sector. The Maharashtra Energy Department (MED)4  is responsible for the state\u2019s \n4. \npower  sector.  The  Maharashtra  State  Electricity  Board  was  unbundled  into  generation, \ntransmission, and distribution utilities in 2005; at that time aggregate technical and commercial \nlosses  averaged  about  35%,  the  power  sector  had  a  demand\u2013supply  gap  of  over  20%,  and \ncustomers, particularly in rural areas, faced unreliable and poor-quality supply. Steady progress \nhas  been  made  to  improve  electricity  access  and  electricity  distribution  efficiencies  along  with \ngeneration  and transmission  capacity.  The Maharashtra  State  Electricity Distribution  Company \nLimited  (MSEDCL),  a  state-owned  enterprise  with  a  distribution  license  formed  after  the \nunbundling, is currently India\u2019s largest electricity distribution company, supplying over 25.4 million \ncustomers  in  457  towns  and  nearly  42,000  villages  across  Maharashtra,  except  in  the  city  of \nMumbai.  MSEDCL  supplies  electricity  to  over  4.2  million  agricultural  customers  in  rural \nMaharashtra, who account for an estimated 30% of its electricity sales volume. However, despite \noverall efficiency improvements, a healthy sales mix (industrial and commercial sales account for \n\n \n\n1  The  per  capita  income  of  Maharashtra  was  \u20b9165,491  compared  with  \u20b9103,870  nationally  in  FY2017.

Deficiencies  in  the  traditional  electricity  distribution \n5. \nnetwork design and historically inadequate capital expenditures have resulted in long, inefficient                \nlow-voltage  distribution  lines,  with  nearly  15\u201320  customers  sharing  a  single  large  distribution \ntransformer. Most rural feeders were mixed, with rural domestic and agriculture customers on the \nsame  feeder.  MSEDCL\u2019s  Gaothan  and  Infrastructure  Plan  program  (implemented  over  2006\u2013\n2015) strengthened the rural distribution network and physically segregated 5,000 rural feeders. \nThis  allowed  agriculture  customers  to  receive  8\u201310  hours  supply  per  day  (though  efficiency, \nquality and reliability are still concerns), while other customers receive a continuous supply. This \nhas  contributed to  reducing  average  utility  wide aggregate technical  and  commercial  losses to \nabout 17% in 2015. Per capita usage of electricity in Maharashtra reached about 1,300 kilowatt-\nhours (kWh)/year in 2014, but was under 800 kWh/year in rural areas, low compared to the world \naverage of 3,000 kWh/year. \n \n6. \nPower  supply  to  agriculture  customers  remains  affected  by  low  metering  levels,  while \ninadequate  payment  enforcement  results  in  estimated  losses  exceeding  20%  for  rural  feeders \nwith predominantly agricultural customers. Most agricultural customers are charged a fixed tariff \nbased on the declared capacity of the agriculture pump rather than on actual electricity usage, \nresulting  in  inefficient  electricity  and  water  consumption.  Retail  agricultural  tariffs  are  linked  to \nprior  assessments  of  customer  payment  capacity  and  require  government  subsidies  and           \ncross-subsidies  from  other  customer  categories  to  cover  the  cost  of  supply.  The  recurring \nelectricity  subsidy  in  Maharashtra  for  agriculture  customers  was  $0.8  billion  in  FY2018.6 This \nimpacts  the  state\u2019s  ability  to  fund  social  programs  while  cross-subsidies  reduce  the \ncompetitiveness  of  industries.  Power  is  also  often  supplied  to  agricultural  customers  at  night \nimpacting pump usage and the quality of rural life.  \n \nB. \n \n7. \nGovernment  strategy  and  program  for  the  sector.  The  electricity  sector  in  India  is \nfocused  on  accelerated  electrification,  adoption  of  clean  energy  source  and  increased  energy \nefficiency, improvement in the quality of power supply to customers, and improved performance \nof  utilities,  which  have  traditionally  been  loss  making.  In  2016,  the  state  government  of \nMaharashtra  formulated  its  program  of  Power  for  All  with  the  objective  to  provide  continuous        \n(24-hour) reliable power to all non-agriculture customers and an assured 8\u201310 hours daily supply \nfor  agricultural  customers  across the  state.  The program  has  components  covering  renewable \nenergy generation predominantly through the private sector, transmission and distribution system \nstrengthening, 100% household electrification, adoption of efficient street lighting and agriculture \npumps,  metering  and  information  and  communication  technology.  While  progress  has  been \nsignificant on renewable energy capacity addition, transmission and distribution investments and \nrural  electrification  for  households,  the  agriculture  pump  related  component  has  not  materially \nprogressed. In 2018, the state government of Maharashtra reviewed the requirements for reliable \nrural  power    supply  for  the  agriculture  sector  and  decided  to  provide  applicants  for  agriculture \nelectricity connections either a connection through HVDS or off-grid solar water pumps to ensure \n\nProgram Rationale \n\n \n\n5  Tariffs are set by the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC). Industrial tariffs in Maharashtra are \n\namong the highest in India (about \u20b98/kWh in FY2018). \n\n6  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development.  2018.  Agriculture  Policies  in  India.  Paris.  Nationally, \nelectricity subsidy for farmers was nearly $9 billion in 2016, second to fertilizer subsidies. Electricity subsidies grew \nnearly fourfold over 2000\u20132016.  \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fthe  agriculture  sector  can  access  modern,  reliable  energy.  The  program  components  are \nperiodically reviewed by the utilities, government and the regulator, and updated to 2021 to meet \nincreasing demand. It is expected that the electrification program for farmers (including HVDS) \nwould continue beyond 2021 after government and regulatory approvals. \n \n8. \nProposed results-based lending program. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) RBL \nwill  support  Maharashtra\u2019s  HVDS  program  for  new  grid-connected  rural  agricultural  customers \nacross the state. The HVDS program is demand-driven and based on applications received for \nnew agricultural connections. The RBL program is expected to be implemented from April 2020 \nto December 2021, by which time about 156,000 metered HVDS connections are expected to be \nin  place  with  distribution  transformers,  11  kilovolt  (kV)  grid  extensions,  and  upstream \nstrengthening for adequate network capacity. \n \n9. \nThe  RBL  modality  is  suitable  for  the  following  reasons:  (i)  it  uses  MSEDCL\u2019s  strong \nimplementation capacity and functional enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems to undertake \nthe  HVDS  program;7 (ii)  government  ownership  of  the  program  is  strong,  as  demonstrated  by \nimplementation of past rural electrification initiatives, and the initial implementation of the HVDS \nprogram in 2019; (iii) it will lower the transaction costs of implementing activities over the state of \nMaharashtra by using existing fiduciary and safeguard systems, which will be further enhanced \nunder the program action plan (PAP); and (iv) the state government of Maharashtra and MSEDCL \nare committed to strengthening sector governance including metering of agricultural customers, \nimproving operational performance, and facilitating information disclosure.8 \n \n10. \nHigh voltage distribution system as an enabler. Increasing the efficiency and reliability \nof electricity supply to agricultural customers poses significant challenges (para. 6). Maharashtra \nhas  undertaken  pilots  to  increase  the  energy  efficiency  of  pumps  using  the  existing  grid,9 and \npromoted  the  adoption  of  drip  irrigation.  The  pace  of  adoption  is  slow  because  of  limited \nawareness on energy efficiency, high upfront costs, frequent pump burnout due to low voltage \nsupply,  and  unmetered  electricity  supply.  There  is  a  need  to  review  business  models  and \ntechnology,  and  to  undertake  work  across  the  electricity,  water,  and  agriculture  sectors.  The \nadoption of HVDS for rural feeders can support models for private sector development including \nfranchisees and energy service companies for inefficient pump replacements. Given the national \nimportance  of  rural  development  and  the  need  to  address  distress  on  the  part  of  farmers,  the \ngovernment of India is working to increase electricity and water use efficiency, improve subsidy \ntargeting  and  farmers\u2019  incomes  by  2022. 10   HVDS  and  customer  metering  support  improved \nsector governance and would be a platform to meet these goals.  \n \n11. \nADB\u2019s value addition. The proposed intervention is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \noperational priorities to promote rural development and food security; tackle climate change, build \nclimate  and  disaster  resilience,  enhance  environmental  sustainability;  accelerate  progress  in \n\n \n\n7  MSEDCL is one of the few public sector electricity utilities in India with functional ERP and advanced information \n\ntechnology capabilities and customer geo-referencing to support implementation monitoring. \n\n8  Program Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

Disbursements  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed between the government and ADB. The loan proceeds will be disbursed to the national \ngovernment\u2019s Controller of Aid, Accounts and Audit Account. The loan will be disbursed subject \nto the achievement and verification of the DLIs. Financing of prior results not more than 12 months \nbefore loan signing is requested to support achieving the results as scheduled, given that such \nactivities comply with the PAP and the results verified in accordance with verification protocols. \nBased  on  assessments,  prior  results  for  achievement  of  DLIs  4,  5,  and  6  are  not  expected  to \nexceed 13% of ADB financing. An advance disbursement may be requested after loan approval \nto finance advance payments to contractors and would not exceed 20% of ADB financing. The \ncombined total of advance financing and financing for prior results would not exceed 30% of ADB \nfinancing.  Subsequent  disbursements  will  be  made  based  on  quarterly  achievement  of  DLIs. \nPartial  disbursements  for  DLIs  4,  5,  6,  and  7  are  allowed  in  proportion  to  the  DLI  target \nachievement provided these are verified and accepted by ADB. The verification mechanism and \nprotocols have been established depending on the nature of the DLIs (Appendix 3). \n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fTechnical Assistance \n\nCapacity Development and Program Action Plan \n\nF. \n \n22. \nVarious assessments were undertaken to assess capacity gaps for the program. An initial \nPAP was prepared and has been agreed with MSEDCL and MED to define specific activities to \nimprove  program  implementation.  The  PAP  includes  actions  to  strengthen  technical  capacity; \nmonitoring; fiduciary responsibilities, gender, and safeguards to ensure that the achievement of \nkey  RBL  program  results  strengthens  MSEDCL  and  government  systems.  The  PAP  will  be \nrefined, improved, and updated during implementation, as needed. \n \nG. \n \n23.  \nThe attached TA will help strengthen the RBL program implementation through a pilot for \nenergy and water conservation that would support demonstration and awareness raising on the \nbenefit of the HVDS platform, the potential for associated services including irrigation advisory, \npump replacement and wider adoption of drip irrigation. It would also support advocacy for design \ninputs for effective policy making including on tariff-setting, payment, and subsidy administration \nfor efficient electricity and water use, and to scale up the post-2021 HVDS program. The TA would \nalso  provide  support to  improve monitoring  and coordination  with  stakeholders  and strengthen \ncapacity for  safeguards.  The  TA  is  estimated  to cost  $1.1 million,  of  which  $1.0  million  will  be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). \nThe  government  will  support  the  TA  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions.18 MED  will  be  responsible  for  the  TA  and  will  coordinate  through  MSEDCL  and \nrelevant  agencies  including  Maharashtra  Energy  Development  Agency,  Groundwater  Surveys \nand Development Agency, and the Water Resources Department. \n \nH. \n \n24.  Maharashtra  Energy  Department  and  MSEDCL  are  the  executing  agencies  for  the \nprogram. MSEDCL will be responsible for physical investments in the network under the program. \nA  steering  group  headed  by  the  Energy  Secretary  and  Chairman  and  Managing  Director  of \nMSEDCL  will  periodically  review  program  implementation  and  provide  overall  direction.  The \nHVDS unit in MSEDCL headed by a Chief Engineer will review implementation being undertaken \nthrough  MSEDCL  field  offices,  aggregate  information  at  a  circle  level,  and  submit  periodic \nprogress reports on achievements including on DLIs, the PAP as well as other key indicators. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nIII. \n\nSUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n\nProgram Technical Assessments \n\n \nA. \n \n25. \nRelevance,  justification,  and  adequacy.  The  RBL  program  is  relevant  and  is  part  of \nMaharashtra\u2019s broader government program to improve access, efficiency, and reliability for new \nagriculture customers. While HVDS is a proven solution for the distribution sector, it has not been \nwidely adopted for agricultural customers because of the high upfront capital expenditure. The \ntechnical  modeling  of  representative  agriculture  feeders  in  rural  Maharashtra  confirmed  the \nreduction in losses by adopting HVDS for new connections compared to the business as usual. \nThe benefits significantly increase if HVDS is extended to both new and existing connections. The \nHVDS program for new connections is expected to continue after 2021 . There is also a plan for \nprogressive conversion of existing customers for high loss feeders, and this will be reviewed under \nthe PAP. The RBL program includes capacity enhancement of 33/11 kV upstream substations \n\n18 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fbased  on  the  expected  increase  in  energy  demand  for  HVDS,  which  will  be  undertaken  in \ncoordination  with  the  transmission  utility.  MSEDCL  has  entered  into  power  purchase \narrangements under the state\u2019s solar program implemented through Energy Efficiency Services \nLimited (EESL) and the private sector including distributed grid connected rural solar projects, to \nprovide daytime power for the agricultural sector. 19 The plans to develop the HVDS network are \nbased  on  standard  designs,  are  operationally  viable,  and  would  increase  supply  reliability  and \npower quality. Climate financing is estimated to cost $89.4 million. ADB will finance $87.0 million \nfor mitigation and $2.4 million for adaptation. These costs were estimated using ADB\u2019s guidance \nnote on counting climate finance.  \n \nEconomic returns. Economic analysis, carried out in accordance with ADB guidelines,20 \n26. \nreviewed alternatives to the RBL program and estimated an economic internal rate of return of \n10.6% in constant 2019 prices compared with business-as-usual connections using low voltage \ndistribution systems. The adoption of HVDS would reduce distribution losses, improve reliability \nof supply, and reduce burnout rates for agriculture pumps and distribution transformers. It reduces \nthe use of diesel in case of outages. The estimated economic returns increase further if coupled \nwith the adoption of efficient pumps and drip irrigation and increased farmer productivity.  \n \n27. \nPoverty  reduction  and  gender.  The  RBL  program  aims  to  supply  reliable  power  to \nagricultural  customers  (including  women)  for  irrigation,  thereby  helping  increase  agricultural \nproductivity and incomes. Most farmers in Maharashtra are considered small and marginal.21 The \nprogram  is  classified  as  having  some  gender  elements.  MSEDCL  has  progressive  policies  on \nwomen\u2019s  recruitment  and  their  awareness  on  and  participation  in  HVDS  training  would  be \nstrengthened  under  the  RBL  program.    Participation  of  women  in  HVDS  customer  awareness \nraising will also be supported. The potential for farmers and their families, including women, to \nbenefit  from  reduced  electricity  and  water  usage,  and  improvements  in  government  policy  \nincluding linkages to  other programs to be associated with HVDS would be studied under the \nproposed pilot supported by the TA, and the knowledge shared with MED and other stakeholders. \n \n28. \nSustainability  and  governance.  In  June  2019,  MSEDCL  was  ranked  third  among \ndistribution utilities nationally for performance under the government\u2019s Ujwal Discom Assurance \nYojana  (a  program  for  operational  improvement  and  financial  turnaround)  and  one  of  the  few \npublic sector electricity distribution companies with an after-tax profit. However, MSEDCL had a \ndebt-service coverage ratio of less than 1 in FY2018. To reduce the impact on MSEDCL for the \ncapital-intensive HVDS program, the state government proposes to provide long tenor ADB funds \nas a grant to MSEDCL. Tariffs for MSEDCL are independently set by the Maharashtra Electricity \nRegulatory  Commission  (MERC)  based  on  a  published  methodology  and  a  public  hearing \nprocess.  MSEDCL  has  been  unable  to  effectively  meter  the  agricultural  customers  on  the \nconventional distribution network (para. 6). The introduction of HVDS supports 100% metering, \nmonitoring of energy consumption, and billing based on a usage-based tariff, and improves the \nutility\u2019s  capacity  to  track  and  take  action  on  non-paying  customers.  The  attached  TA  would \nsupport  a  pilot  for  MSEDCL  and  MED  to  identify  avenues  for  adoption  of  energy  and  water \nconservation through tariffs and improved subsidy administration to increase the sustainability of \nthe HVDS program. The HVDS dashboard would allow MSEDCL management and stakeholders, \nincluding other government departments, to track the relevant information on HVDS customers.  \n \n\n \n\n19 ADB. 2019.

Monitoring  and  evaluation  system.  MSEDCL\u2019s  existing  monitoring  system \nERP-based. MSEDCL has invested in software to track new applications for connections, network \noperation and maintenance, meter reading and billing, capital projects, and financial transactions. \nMSEDCL  is  using  a  geographic  information  system to  tag  and  determine  the requirements  for \nconnecting each new customer to the network, which supports easier verification of quantities. \nMSEDCL staff use smart phones and employee applications to ensure that field data is directly \nuploaded, up-to-date, and traceable. Prominent performance indicators tracked include electricity \nsales,  distribution  loss,  network  reliability,  tariffs,  cost  of  supply,  load-shedding,  project \nimplementation and financial indicators. The system can monitor DLI performance; a customized \nHVDS  reporting  dashboard  is  being  implemented  (DLI  8)  to  provide  monthly  monitoring  and \nquarterly  progress  reports  and  information  flows  to  the  MED.  During  due  diligence,  MSEDCL \nagreed to implement a sampling and data collection system to report on quality of power supply \nfor agricultural customers (DLI 3). To complement monitoring and evaluation, the IVA will verify \ninformation  related  to  the  DLIs  and  monitor  PAP  implementation  for  compliance.  The  state \ngovernment\u2019s  Directorate  of  Economics  and  Statistics  will  evaluate  program  performance  and \nimpact through external parties. \n \n30. \nFiduciary systems. MSEDCL follows the rules and regulations set under the Companies \nAct, 2013 for corporate governance and financial reporting and its operations are governed by \nthe  regulatory  framework  provided  under  the  Electricity  Act,  2003,  and  rules  and  regulations \nenacted  by  MERC. 22  The  RBL  program  will  use  MSEDCL\u2019s  fiduciary  systems  for  financial \nmanagement,  procurement,  audits  and  anticorruption.  These  systems  were  assessed  to \ndetermine their ability to manage fiduciary risks and provide assurances that the RBL program \nfunds will be used as intended, with due consideration for economy and efficiency.23  \n \n31. \nThe  overall  fiduciary  risk  is  rated  as  moderate.  MSEDCL  has  substantial  capacity  to \nundertake  the  RBL  program,  with  a  well-structured  finance  and  accounts  function  headed  by \nqualified professionals. It has a transparent and efficient management system with ERP systems, \ncentralized billing and management dashboards. MSEDCL has an effective budgetary planning \nand control system with an internal audit function that performs well and has maintained a fixed \nasset  and  inventory  register  through  the  ERP.  However,  improvements  are  needed  for  timely \ncompletion of physical verification of assets, internal controls for financial reporting and to address \nthe qualified audit opinion. These are being implemented and addressed in the PAP. \n \nThe procurement assessment covered the procurement profile of the RBL program, and \n32. \ncountry- and agency-level procurement assessments. The RBL program will rely on MSEDCL\u2019s \nsystems and will exclude high-value contracts in accordance with ADB\u2019s RBL policy.24 MSEDCL \nhas  a  well-defined,  transparent,  and  accountable  procurement  process  and  uses  electronic \nprocurement.  The  procurement  process  covers  the  preparation  of  cost  estimates,  evaluation \nprocedures,  confidentiality,  staff  performance  review,  and  the  appeals  mechanism  defined  in \nMSEDCL  and  state  procurement  guidelines.  The  scope  for  procurement  includes  turnkey \ncontracts and goods. The goods packages that are about 11% of the total RBL program in value \n\n \n\n22 Electricity is a concurrent subject in India, which is governed by both central and state governments. The overarching \nframework is provided by the national Electricity Act, 2003 and the specific and operational rules and regulations are \nprovided by the individual state electricity regulatory commissions. \n\n23 Program Fiduciary Risk Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 ADB.  2013.  Piloting  Results-Based  Lending  for  Programs.  Manila.  High-value  contacts  are  those  with  estimated \nvalue over $50 million for works, turnkey and supply, and installation contracts; $30 million for goods; $20 million for \ninformation technology systems and non-consulting services; and $15 million for consulting services. \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fand  consisting  of  relatively  low-value  transactions  at  an  average  cost  of  $1  million,  include  a \nprovision to split a contract if qualified bidders from the state of Maharashtra volunteer to reduce \nprices to match the lowest competitive bid received. This is specified in the bidding document and \nis followed in several Indian states. The overall procurement risk is assessed as moderate. \n  \n33. \nThe anticorruption framework of the RBL program is effective. The state government of \nMaharashtra has established an Anti-Corruption Bureau to investigate complaints against public \nservants involving abuse of position and corruption. MSEDCL has a well-structured anticorruption \nfunction with five vigilance cells dealing with complaints including corruption, embezzlement, and \nfraud charges against its officers. MSEDCL has developed an online grievance redress system \nfor customers to log complaints and provide feedback on services. The Guidelines to Prevent or \nMitigate  Fraud,  Corruption,  and  Other  Prohibited  Activities  in  Results-Based  Lending  for \nPrograms were explained to the government and MSEDCL (footnote 25) and are part of the PAP. \n \n34. \nSafeguard systems. A program systems safeguard assessment (PSSA) was prepared. \nThe RBL program is classified as category B for environment and involuntary resettlement, and \ncategory C for indigenous peoples, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \nDue diligence was conducted on the activities including construction and augmentation of 33/11 \nkV substations, 11 kV lines, distribution transformers, and connections. MSEDCL confirmed that \nland acquisition is not proposed for connections and the program is demand-driven. The 33/11 \nkV distribution substation would typically be on barren government land. If private land acquisition \nis  required,  it  would  be through  voluntary  donation  or  direct  purchase  with  no  involuntary  land \nacquisition.  The  distribution  lines  will  originate  from  the  nearest  existing  11  kV  line  and  the \nalignment  will  follow  rights-of-way  of  existing  roads  or  unused  land  between  agricultural  plots \nwithout intruding on private property. Activities located in or directly adjacent to key biodiversity \nareas or national protected areas\u2014including wildlife sanctuaries or reserves, forests, and cultural \nheritage sites\u2014will be excluded from the RBL program through the application of the safeguard \nscreening guidance. The RBL program activities will not cause significant, irreversible, diverse, \nor  unprecedented  adverse  environmental  and  social  impacts.  Potential  construction-related \nimpacts from pole and line installation and operation include air and liquid emissions, waste etc. \nwith  occupational  and  community  health  and  safety  impacts.  The  impacts  associated  with \nconstruction  and  operation  will  be  managed  by  MSEDCL  by  implementing  relevant  national \nregulations and company practices. Indigenous peoples are not targeted beneficiaries, although \nthe RBL program will not exclude them. The RBL program will not adversely impact indigenous \npeoples, their cultural identity, survival, cultural resources, or livelihood systems. \n \nIn addition, policy equivalent assessment was undertaken to compare national, state, and \n35. \nagency-level  policies  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  There  are  well-defined \nlegislative frameworks for environment and social safeguards in India and Maharashtra. MSEDCL \nrules and practices on safeguard matters are institutionalized and there is a specific grievance \nredress mechanism. However, gaps in procedural matters (site screening, record keeping, and \nmonitoring)  have  been  identified  and  environmental  and  social  management  system  (ESMS)25  \nguidelines,  tools  and  formats  have  been  developed  for  the  RBL  program.  Meaningful \nconsultations were undertaken, and the results incorporated. MSEDCL has identified staff from \nhead office and in each division to undertake the safeguard activities. The PMU will implement \nthe  safeguard  PAP  and  ESMS  for  the  RBL  program  and  report  to  ADB  through  semiannual \nmonitoring  reports.  Consultants  under the  TA  will  guide the  PMU  and  monitor  implementation. \n\n25 It  consists  of  a  set  of  guiding  documents  including  safeguards  screening,  due  diligence  template,  generic \nenvironment management plan, safeguards monitoring template, consultation template, and guidelines for voluntary \ndonation and direct purchase. These are developed as an ESMS for this program. \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nThe PSSA was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website in September 2019. A climate risk assessment was \nconducted,  and  the  potential  risks  are  assessed  as  medium,  including  increase  in  rainfall  and \ntemperatures.
