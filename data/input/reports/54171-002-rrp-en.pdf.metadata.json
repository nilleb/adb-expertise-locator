It will provide medical equipment and supplies and upgrade laboratories and isolation \nfacilities  at  17  DOH  hospitals  throughout  the  country.  This  will  strengthen  COVID-19-related \ntesting, surveillance, infection prevention and control, and treatment. It will also help to improve \nthe preparedness and resilience of the health system to handle future public health threats. HEAL \nwill support three operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030\u2014addressing remaining poverty \nand  reducing  inequalities,  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality,  and  strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity. The outcome of HEAL will be the strengthened capacity of \nDOH to detect, contain, and treat COVID-19 cases. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nState of public health emergency. On 8 March 2020, the government declared a state \nof public health emergency.1 New infections rapidly grew and spread from the National Capital \nRegion  (NCR)  to  the  rest  of  Luzon  and  other  parts  of the  country.  The  government raised the \nCOVID-19 Alert System to Code Red sublevel 2 on 13 March 2020 and imposed a month-long \ncommunity  quarantine  in  the  NCR.  This  was  later  expanded  to  an  enhanced  community \nquarantine (ECQ) for the entire island of Luzon, and several areas in the Visayas and Mindanao. \nOn  15  May  2020,  the  NCR,  Laguna,  and  the  cities  of  Cebu  and  Mandaue  were  placed  under \nmodified  ECQ  until  31  May  2020.  By  1  June  2020,  most  places  either  moved  into  general \ncommunity  quarantine  if  the  daily  reported  number  of  new  cases  were  decreasing  or  were \nrequired  to  implement  minimum  health  standards  if  no  new  cases  had  been  reported  in  the \npreceding two weeks. However, due to a spike in the number of cases, modified ECQ was re-\nintroduced  in  the  NCR,  Bulacan,  Cavite,  Laguna,  and  Rizal  from  4  to  18  August  2020.  The \nPhilippines had registered 129,913 confirmed cases (including 239 serious or critical ones and \n67,673 recoveries) and 2,270 deaths out of 1,769,881 tests conducted (Figure).2  \n\nCumulative and Daily Confirmed Coronavirus Disease Cases in the Philippines \n \n\n         \nSource: Worldometer.

Manila. \n\n(accessed 10 August 2020). \n\n \n\n\fThe  government  announced  the  guiding  principles  of  minimum  health  standards  in  the \n4. \nhealth and other sectors\u2014the \u201cnew normal\u201d\u2014aiming to prevent the spread of COVID-19 cases \nafter all quarantine measures are lifted. The imposition of the ECQ, modified ECQ, and general \ncommunity  quarantine  is  expected  to  prevent  wider  community  transmission  and  avoid \noverwhelming the health system. Recent studies confirm that without quarantine measures, the \ncountry\u2019s hospital system would have been overwhelmed by more than 1 million people needing \nhospitalization.3  \n \nStrained health system. The growing number of COVID-19 cases poses a serious threat \n5. \nto the country\u2019s health system, which had long neglected laboratory and diagnostic services and \ninvestments in human resource capacity. Delays in COVID-19 testing, long turn-around time from \nsampling to obtaining results (para. 6), inadequate infection control such as the lack of personal \nprotective equipment (PPE) in hospitals, overcrowded emergency rooms, insufficient number of \nhospital and critical care beds, and an increasing number of health professionals getting infected \nand dying from COVID-19 further constrain the health system.  \n \nInsufficient  testing  and  surveillance  capacity.  In  early  March  2020,  the  Research \n6. \nInstitute  for  Tropical  Medicine  was  the  only  laboratory  conducting  polymerase  chain  reaction \n(PCR) testing for COVID-19 for the whole country. This limited testing capacity, combined with \nfragmented  contact  tracing,  made  it  difficult  to  centrally  monitor  and  ensure  the  application  of \ncontrol measures by local government units (LGUs), such as the isolation of probable and suspect \ncases.  LGUs  are  also  constrained  by  inadequate  human  and  financial  resources,  and  lack  of \nadequate DOH support for contact tracing and the setup of local isolation wards.  \n \nInadequate  infection  control  measures.  COVID-19  has  resulted  in  widespread \n7. \nnosocomial infections.4 This highlights the urgent need to isolate suspect cases, even with mild \nsymptoms, and ensure enough supply of PPE for health care workers.5 The increased demand \nfor PPE follows the national treatment and infection protocols of suspect and confirmed cases, \nand about 30 sets of disposable PPE per day per health worker are required.6 Both government \nand  private  hospitals  face  a  shortage  of  PPE,  which  increases  the  vulnerability  of  health  care \nstaff. The inadequate number of isolation and/or negative pressure rooms in hospitals and the \nlack of isolation facilities for suspect and mild COVID-19 cases exacerbate the situation.7 Only \nlarge private and government hospitals have negative pressure rooms at present.8  \n \n8. \nLow treatment capacity for moderate and severe cases. The low ratios of hospital beds \nto population (1 hospital bed per 984 people) and doctors to population (about 1 doctor per 2,000 \npeople), and the lack of critical care beds and ventilators also constrain the ability of the health \nsystem to treat the growing number of COVID-19 cases in the country. It is globally estimated that \n30%  of  hospitalized  COVID-19  patients  will  require  critical care,  including  invasive  mechanical \nventilation.9 The number of ventilators available nationwide (about 2,000) is inadequate to treat \nthe increasing number of severe COVID-19 cases. The number of health care workers trained in \n\n \n\n3  M. Herrera et al. 2020. Evaluating Potential Consequences of Alternative Public Responses to the Covid-19 Epidemic \nin  the  Philippines.

In early March 2020, the government declared a state of public \n10. \nemergency and imposed area-specific quarantine measures to restrain the spread of COVID-19 \n(para.  4).  To  mitigate  the  harsh  social  and  economic  impacts  of  the  severe  measures,  the \ngovernment enacted the Bayan Bayanihan to Heal as One Act on 24 March 2020, which provides \npolicies to speed up the response actions laid out in the National Action Plan for COVID-19.12 The \nlaw mandates expedited procurement and delivery of emergency medical supplies and equipment \nfor  health  facilities  that  will  enable  the  government  to  test,  trace,  isolate,  and  treat  COVID-19 \ncases. This effort is led by the Department of National Defense and the Department of Interior \nand Local Government, with DOH providing technical guidance.  \n \n11. \nTest,  trace,  isolate,  and  treat.  Given  the  increased  number  of  confirmed  COVID-19 \ncases (para. 3), DOH took steps to further increase testing capacity and contact tracing. It boosted \nthe number of government PCR laboratories from 1 to 19, which includes 2 university laboratories, \n1  LGU  public  laboratory,  and  1  Department  of  Agriculture  laboratory.  ADB  supported  the \nconvening of the public\u2013private Task Force T3 (Test, Trace, and Treat) to mobilize the private \nsector to help increase the testing capacity of government laboratories, upgrade the capacities of \nprivate  laboratories,  and  set  up  new  private  laboratories,  particularly  outside  the  major  urban \ncenters; and improve inventory and logistics management.

An additional 23 GeneXpert \nlaboratories have also been certified. These have increased daily testing to an average of around \n26,000 in the week of 19\u201325 July 2020. A further increase to over 30,000 tests a day is expected \nby  end-August  2020,  as  the  government  expands  the  coverage  of  testing  from  symptomatic \npatients and frontliners to residents of hotspot barangays.  \n \n12. \nThe challenge now lies in sustaining this level of testing by ensuring a sufficient number \nof trained laboratory personnel, PCR test kits, PPE, and other supplies. The government procured \nand  distributed  at  least  900,000  sets  of  PPE  across  the  country.  PHIC  expanded  the  benefit \ncoverage of all COVID-19 patients and health workers to also include PCR testing. In addition, \nDOH  is  providing  additional  benefits  such  as  special  risk  allowance,  cash  compensation  for \nsevere  COVID-19  infection,  and  expanded  death  benefits  for  health  workers.  The  country \ncurrently has 22 government hospitals, including the university hospital of the state-run University \nof the Philippines (Philippine General Hospital) and one private hospital, designated as COVID-\n19  referral  hospitals.  Several  convention  centers,  stadiums,  and  other  public  facilities  are  also \nbeing converted into temporary health facilities to isolate suspect and mild COVID-19 cases.  \n \n13. \nDevelopment partners\u2019 coordination. Following the World Health Organization (WHO) \nStrategic Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19, the Philippines adopted a whole-of-\nsociety  coordination  mechanism.  DOH\u2019s  Emergency  Operating  Center  leads  the  national \ncontingency planning process, involving all relevant government agencies, the private sector, and \nnongovernment  organizations  such  as  the  Philippine  Red  Cross.  WHO  supports  DOH  in \ncoordinating with development partners such as ADB, the World Bank, the United States Agency \nfor International Development, and other United Nations technical agencies. With the proposed \ninvestment loan ADB will support DOH in the provision of medical equipment and supplies, and \nthe  upgrade  of  laboratories  and  isolation  facilities  at  DOH  hospitals  in  different  locations.  The \nWorld Bank is also providing an investment project loan to support the scaling up of DOH\u2019s health \nresponse  ADB  will  establish  a  joint  reporting  mechanism  with  the  World  Bank  to  ensure \ncomplementarity and reduce the transaction costs for DOH.14 \n \n14. \nGovernment request. The government estimates that an immediate medical response to \nCOVID-19  will  cost  about  $708  million  (\u20b135  billion  equivalent).15  The  National  Action  Plan  for \nCOVID-19 represents a full-scale, whole-of-government response aimed at increasing the testing \nand  tracing  capacity  and  halting  community  transmission.  Recognizing  how  long-standing \nweaknesses  in  health  service  delivery,  financing,  and  governance  capacities  have  affected  its \nability to contain COVID-19, DOH aims to invest in improving health infrastructure and equipment, \nenhancing health human resources, and strengthening health financing and information systems. \nThese investments will support the country\u2019s COVID-19 response, help it achieve universal health \ncoverage, and prepare it for future public health security threats. The government requested ADB \nto  provide  a  dedicated  health  sector  investment  loan  to  accelerate  the  implementation  of  the \nhealth service delivery component of the National Action Plan for COVID-19 (footnote 12).  \n\n \n\n13 ADB. 2020.

Manila (as of 9 April 2020, and regularly updated). \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fProject Description \n\nB. \n \n15. \nHEAL  is  aligned  with  the  following  impacts:  (i)  access  to  enhanced  COVID-19-related \ndiagnostic and treatment services for all Filipinos improved (footnote 12); and (ii) health system \nperformance in addressing public health outbreaks improved.16 HEAL aligns with the third pillar \nof  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2018\u20132023  for  the  Philippines,  i.e.,  investing  in  people \nthrough human development and social protection.17 It will have the following outcome: capacity \nof DOH to detect, contain, and treat COVID-19 cases strengthened.18 HEAL will support 17 DOH \nhospitals under outputs 1 and 2.19 The outputs are designed in such a way that the permanent \ninfrastructure established and the equipment provided under the loan will strengthen the country\u2019s \nmedium-  to  long-term  capacity  to  deal  with  a  broad  spectrum  of  infectious  diseases  beyond \nCOVID-19, including respiratory illnesses, which are significant in the Philippines. \n \n16. \nOutput  1:  Disease  surveillance  and  diagnostic  capacity  upgraded.  HEAL  will  (i) \nincrease  the  testing  capacity  of  at  least  10  government  molecular  laboratories  by  providing \ntesting  kits,  chemicals, reagents, PPE, and consumables for COVID-19 testing, and patient \ntransport vehicles  to  deliver  specimens  to  molecular  laboratories;  (ii)  build  and  equip  two \nbiosafety level (BSL)-2 laboratories, and upgrade the equipment of one BSL-3 laboratory and \nnine other BSL-2 laboratories; (iii) install computed tomography scan machines in 33 hospitals \nto improve the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 cases; and (iv) train laboratory technicians in the \nuse of medical equipment and the management of test result data (disaggregated by sex, age, \nand pre-existing medical conditions) at supported laboratories.  \n \n17. \nOutput  2: Infection  prevention  and  control  measures  expanded.  HEAL  will  provide \nPPE  for  frontline  health  workers  and  laboratory  technicians  to  selected  DOH  hospitals,  LGU \nhospitals,  and  national  and  local  government  isolation  facilities.  It  will  support  the  renovation \nand/or  construction  of  negative  pressure  isolation  wards  in  12  DOH  hospitals  (including  7 \nhospitals supported under output 1). These isolation wards will have equipment to monitor heart \nrate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, oxygen saturation level, and other vital signs, \nas well as hazardous waste treatment facilities. HEAL will also strengthen the infection prevention \ncapacity of health workers in obstetrics, pediatric, and emergency departments through training \nand communication activities, with the aim of controlling vector transmission in maternal and child \nhealth service delivery during public health outbreaks.20  \n \n18. \nOutput  3:  Treatment  capacity  for  COVID-19  scaled  up.

It  will  also  provide  the \nhospitals  under  outputs  1  and  2  with  associated  critical  care  equipment, \nincluding \nelectrocardiography machines, defibrillators, and a critical care monitoring system. The project \nwill  train  technicians  and  other  staff  on  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  to  ensure  the \nsustainability of the ventilators and other critical care equipment. It will also train health workers \nto  detect  and  prevent  domestic  gender-based  violence,  and  provide  psycho-social  support  to \npatients and families, including pregnant and vulnerable women affected by COVID-19.  \n \nC. \n\nValue Added by ADB \n\n19. \nADB  helped  the  government  to  strengthen  primary  health  care  services  through  the \nWomen\u2019s  Health  and  Safe  Motherhood  Project  in  1994\u20132002  and  the  Integrated  Community \nHealth Project in 1995\u20132005.21 In 2004, the Health Sector Development Program was approved \nto  support  the  implementation  of  the  1999  Health  Sector  Reform  Agenda.22  In  2009,  ADB \napproved the Credit for Better Health Care Project to help upgrade health services of LGUs and \nfacilitate private sector participation in health care.23 The key lessons from these interventions are \nthat health project designs need to (i) take into account the decentralized health system and its \ninstitutional  arrangements  for  local  health  service  delivery;  and  (ii)  include  public  financial \nmanagement support to strengthen project implementation, performance, and governance.  \n\nHEAL  will  provide  targeted  support  to  the  health  sector.  It  complements  the  recently \n20. \napproved  $1.5  billion  COVID-19  Active  Response  and  Expenditure  Support  Program,24  which \nhelps the government finance its fiscal response to COVID-19, including emergency cash grants \nto 18 million low income households and wage subsidies to employees of small businesses. It \nalso  complements  the  $200  million  Social  Protection  Support  Project  (Second  Additional \nFinancing), which provided more than 3.7 million poor households under the Pantawid Pamilyang \nPilipino Program with emergency cash assistance to help them cope with the loss of livelihood \nbecause  of  the  quarantine.25  The  model  of  the  subnational  pandemic  reference  laboratory \nestablished at JBL Hospital with the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund grant (para. 11 and \nfootnote 13) will be replicated when constructing and equipping the two new BSL-2 laboratories \nunder output 1. HEAL, together with the support of the laboratory establishment, is the start of the \nlonger-term engagement to support DOH for rolling out the Universal Health Care reform. \n \n21. \nIn  close  partnership  with  development  partners,  research  institutions,  and  the  private \nsector, ADB will continue to support knowledge generation on epidemiological modeling, research \nand development, and technology-enabled solutions to help DOH refine and update its COVID-\n19 management strategy and interventions. For instance, ADB conducted a cost\u2013benefit analysis \nof COVID-19 control options post ECQ jointly with national and overseas research institutions. \nThe study recommended a stronger policy for testing, contact tracing, and isolation, combined \nwith the application of minimum health standards, for a sustainable economic recovery process \n(footnote 11).

ADB\u2019s assistance \nto the poor also included a rapid response technical assistance grant for $5 million, which leveraged private sector \ndonations to provide food baskets to up to 140,000 vulnerable families affected by COVID-19 in the NCR. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fADB  will  provide  technical  support  to  strengthen  the  health  system  reforms  under  the \n22. \nUniversal Health Care Act.26 The support aims to (i) upgrade the health information system with \napplication and support regulatory frameworks to sustain private sector engagement in diagnosis, \ncontact  tracing,  and  equipment  purchase;  (ii)  develop  business  processes  and  an  information \nsystem for PHIC to strengthen its organizational capacity; and (iii) develop the Philippines Health \nFacility  Development  Plan  to  strengthen  health  facilities\u2019  capacities  in  line  with  the  country\u2019s \nUniversal Health Care goals.27 ADB, through the Task Force T3 (para. 11), will continue to support \nthe  expansion  of  testing  and  contact  tracing,  and  the  local  production  of  PPE.  ADB  is  also \nsupporting DOH to strengthen communication systems to manage COVID-19. The activities will \ncomplement HEAL in strengthening the health system in the long term. \n \nD. \n \n23. \nHEAL  is  estimated  to  cost  $131  million,  including  taxes  and  duties,  physical  and  price \ncontingencies,  administrative  costs,  and  interest  charges  during  implementation  (Table  2). \nDetailed  cost  estimates  by  expenditure  category  and  by  financier  are  included  in  the  project \nadministration  manual  (PAM).28  ADB  will  finance  goods,  civil  works,  equipment,  consulting \nservices, taxes, and duties.  \n \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nTable 2: Summary Cost Estimates \n\nAmount  \n($ million)a \n\n \n\nShare of Total  \n(%) \n \n\nItem \nA. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\nB. \n \nC. \n\n  \n\nDescription \n\nBase Cost b \n1. \n2. \n3. \n\nDisease surveillance and diagnostic capacity upgraded \nInfection prevention and control measures expanded \nTreatment capacity for COVID-19 scaled up  \nSubtotal (A) \n\nContingencies c \n\nTotal without Financing Charges (A+B) \nFinancing Charges During Implementation d \n\nTotal Cost (A+B+C) \n\n41.05 \n46.03 \n32.21 \n119.29 \n6.21 \n125.50 \n5.50 \n131.00 \n\n31.34 \n35.14 \n24.58 \n91.06 \n4.74 \n95.80 \n4.20 \n100.00 \n\nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease. \na  Includes taxes and duties ($12.74 million) to be financed through the Asian Development Bank loan.

It will set up a Project \nManagement Team (PMT) that will manage, coordinate, and monitor performance according to \nthe design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). The 17 selected DOH hospitals will provide \nadequate  space  and  qualified  human  resources  to  operate  the  medical  equipment  in  the \nconstructed laboratories and isolation wards and rooms. DOH will engage a technical support unit \ncomprising  individual  consultants  (health  experts,  an  architect,  engineers,  a  gender  specialist, \nenvironmental  safeguards  specialists,  a  financial  management  specialist,  a  procurement \nspecialist, and administration staff) to assist the PMT.  \n \nGiven  the  urgency  to  receive  the  required  goods,  the  current  volatile  global  supply  for \n27. \nCOVID-19 medical equipment and consumables, and DOH\u2019s constrained human resources, DOH \nwill engage a procurement agent to support the procurement of all medical equipment and goods \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s procurement policy. The contracting of a procurement agent will allow \nfor cost savings through order consolidation, leading to economies of scale, and reduces the risks \nrelated  to  product  quality,  availability,  and  logistics.  Furthermore,  leveraging  the  capacity  and \nexpertise of the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) ensures value for money. \nDOH  requested  that  the  recruitment  of  UNOPS  be  delegated  to  ADB,  while  DOH  will  be \nresponsible for contract negotiation, signing, and management. \n \n28. \nBased on its procurement knowledge, capacity, and proven experience in rapidly sourcing \nand supplying medical equipment and goods through its Asia Regional Health Cluster, UNOPS \nwill  be  engaged  through  direct  contracting.  UNOPS  has  solid  expertise  in  the  health  sector, \nespecially in undertaking global procurement and overseeing the construction of hospitals and \nhealth centers, with extensive experience in Asia. In the Philippines, UNOPS is currently building \na hospital in the province of Leyte (Eastern Visayas region), giving it the necessary knowledge \nand understanding of the procurement required in similar medical facilities in the country. UNOPS \nhas  long-term  agreements  in  place  for  medical  equipment  and  vehicles,  and  preexisting \nrelationships  with  other  quality  medical  goods  suppliers. \nIts  database  of  prequalified \nmanufacturers  and  suppliers,  as  well  as  pricing  references  for  pharmaceutical  and  medical \nequipment purchased in the region ensure cost-effectiveness and provide UNOPS with a global \nprocurement reach and up-to-date market knowledge of COVID-19 procurement constraints.   \n \n29. \nAs  regards  the  civil  works  at  selected  hospitals,  their  grouping  into  three  packages \ncovering  Luzon,  Visayas,  and  Mindanao,  with  individual  lots  through  open  competitive  bidding \n(national advertisement), will provide procurement flexibility and allow work to be undertaken in \nparallel.

HEAL is expected to augment the government\u2019s response to \nthe COVID-19 pandemic by upgrading surveillance and diagnostic capacity, improving prevention \nand control measures, and boosting treatment capacity. Cost\u2013benefit analyses on various post-\nECQ scenarios show that the least costly measure is massive investment in tracing, testing, and \nisolation capacities (footnote 11). A cost-effectiveness analysis of HEAL, following ADB guidelines \non economic analyses, shows that the cost per disability-adjusted life years is below the GDP per \ncapita, making the intervention very cost-effective.31  \n \nB. \n \n31.  While HEAL will have a high development impact, it is not a revenue generating project. \nThe  financial  analysis  included  an  assessment  of  DOH\u2019s  capacity  to  pay  for  its  total  recurrent \n\nSustainability  \n\n \n\n29 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 ADB. 2020.

DOH largely depends on \nthe national budget for funding. An overall shortfall in DOH's internal budget allocation for O&M \nis expected. This risk will be mitigated by the ability of government hospitals to generate revenues \nto cover the additional O&M cost. These hospitals enjoy fiscal autonomy, which allows them to \nretain 100% of revenues generated for the improvement of health care services. This is on top of \nthe budgetary allocation they receive from the National Treasury and subsidies from DOH in the \nevent  of  shortfalls.  Further,  government  hospitals,  including  DOH  hospitals,  supplement  their \nbudgetary  allocations  with  reimbursements  from  PHIC.  With  PHIC\u2019s  expanded  coverage  for \nCOVID-19 testing, community quarantine, and in-patient care, these reimbursements will provide \nadditional financing for the hospitals. To further mitigate the risk, the loan agreement will include \na provision to ensure that DOH allocates sufficient budget and resources for O&M. \n \nC. \n \n32. \nDOH has adequate financial management systems in place, including internal audits and \na  fully  automated  financial  information  system.  Financial  reporting  is  done  on  a  regular  basis. \nAccounting  and  auditing  standards  are  in  line  with  international  standards.  Nonetheless,  ADB \nnoted some significant weaknesses. First, in its frontline role of handling the health crisis, DOH \nmay not be able to manage large-scale procurement of goods and works and mobilize adequate \nstaff to implement the project. Second, of the total authorized staff positions in DOH, 24% have \nnot been filled. Third, DOH has weak financial management capacity as evidenced by material \nmisstatements  and  deficiencies  in  its  financial  reports.  Finally,  the  internal  control  is  weak \nbecause of the lack of an orderly storage system with adequate controls to safekeep procured \nmaterials. The financial management risk of HEAL was therefore considered to be substantial. \nThe procurement risk of HEAL was assessed as high. DOH has limited experience in undertaking \nprocurement  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policies  and  Regulations.  Compounding  these \nconstraints,  DOH  is  understaffed  with  existing  staff  resources  extremely  stretched  by  DOH\u2019s \nfrontline  role  in  the  COVID-19  response.  To  mitigate  this,  DOH  will  (i)  engage  a  procurement \nagent  (para.  27)  and  implementation  consultants  such  as  a  national  financial  management \nspecialist and a procurement specialist as part of the technical support unit (para. 26) to support \nit; (ii) identify full-time focal persons within DOH and at the 17 selected subnational hospitals, who \nwill oversee the implementation; (iii) conduct quarterly monitoring; and (iv) establish and roll out \nfinancial management arrangements through briefings and training.  \n \n33. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and DOH. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 28). \n \nD. \n \nPoverty and social. The government has made significant progress in reducing poverty \n34. \nfrom  23.3%  of  the  population  in  2015  to  16.6%  in  2018,  thanks  to  strong  wage  employment \ncreation and sustained economic growth averaging 6.3% annually from 2011 to 2019. However, \nthe COVID-19-related shocks and ECQ measures to contain the spread of the virus have resulted \nin job losses and a reduction in household incomes, including remittances from overseas, which \nwill  increase  the  incidence  of  poverty  in  2020  and  threaten  to  reverse  the  gains  achieved  in \npoverty alleviation. ADB estimates that unemployment in Luzon which may have peaked at 22% \nin June of 2020 could gradually decline to 9.6% by the first quarter of 2021, well above the pre-\nCOVID-19 rate of 5.4% at the end of 2019. Similarly, the incidence of poverty could increase from \n16.6% in 2018 to 20.7% in 2020. This equates to 5.5 million more Filipinos falling into poverty \n(footnote  24).  Community  quarantine  was  aimed  at  slowing  the  spread  of  the  virus,  giving  the \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\ngovernment  time  to  institute  critical  measures  to  step  up  public  health  security  and  health \nsystems, while protecting the most vulnerable people such as young children, people with pre-\nexisting  conditions,  and  the  elderly.  Such  measures,  however,  also  tend  to  disrupt  economic \nactivities, which heavily affects the informal sector and the daily wage earners. Other anticipated \nconsequences are negative coping behaviors that lead to domestic and gender-based violence.  \n \n35. \nGender. HEAL is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. Women account for 75% \nof health workers in the Philippines. Key gender issues in the present context include (i) limited \navailability  of  data  for  a  gender  analysis  of  the  COVID-19  situation;  (ii)  high  infection  risks  for \nhealth  workers  because  of  insufficient  PPE;  (iii)  mental  health  issues  caused  by  increased \nfinancial  and  health  burdens;  (iv)  less  focus  on  maternal  and  child  health  services;  (v)  limited \nfacilities  and  protocols  for  COVID-19  patients;  and  (vi)  an  increasing  number  of  gender-based \nviolence cases. Because of the COVID-19 situation, pregnant women are avoiding public health \nfacilities.  Peak-time  critical  COVID-19  cases  require  the  full  attention  of  about  21%  of  health \nworkers and often exceed their regular workload.32 This also worsened the annual maternal death \nto  3,200  (26%  higher  than  the  pre-COVID-2019  level)  and  increased  unplanned  pregnancies, \nincluding among teenage girls.33 HEAL will address these concerns by (i) providing PPE suited \nto both men and women, including menstrual hygiene products for women;  34 (ii) increasing the \ncapacity of health workers through training and communication activities; and (iii) ensuring that \nall new infrastructure and the national health and safety protocols are gender-sensitive.35 \n \nE. \n \n36. \nfor HEAL are as follows.  \n \n37. \nEnvironment  (category  C).  The  installation  of  new  isolation  facilities  in  12  DOH \nselected hospitals and 2 selected BSL-2 laboratories will require minor civil works on existing \nhospital compounds that may cause minimal adverse environmental impacts. Impacts will be \nhighly localized and limited to a short construction period. A code of construction practice was \nprepared to guide environment and safety risk management during such works. The DOH PMT \nwill include construction supervision and environment management experts. The project will also \nsupport the provision of hazardous waste treatment facilities (para.17). Further, all the PPE and \nconsumables procured under the project will be utilized and disposed of in full compliance with \ngood environmental practices.  \n \nInvoluntary resettlement (category C). As stated in para. 37, HEAL will involve activities \n38. \nand minor civil works on existing hospital compounds that will not require any land acquisition or \nlead to any resettlement impacts.  \n \nIndigenous peoples (category C). HEAL will not have any direct or indirect impacts on \n39. \nthe dignity, human rights, livelihood systems, or culture of indigenous peoples, or the territories \nor natural or cultural resources that indigenous peoples own, use, occupy, or claim as an ancestral \ndomain or asset. \n\nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the safeguard categories \n\n \n\n32  University of the Philippines \u2013 COVID-19 Response Team. 2020.
