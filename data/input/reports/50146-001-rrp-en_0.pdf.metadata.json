Since the start of the 21st century, Armenia\u2019s energy sector has \nundergone  a  series  of  reforms  that  have  significantly  improved  its  performance.  The  reforms \ninvolved  the  unbundling  of  a  vertically  integrated  electricity  subsector  and  the  privatization  of \npower  and  gas  distribution  networks  and  of  most  generating  companies.2 However,  the  power \ndistribution  network  was  largely  neglected  and  suffers  from  the  effects  of  poor  and  irregular \nconstruction and maintenance work undertaken in the 1990s [Confidential information deleted]. \nDistribution assets in the two largest cities of Yerevan and Gyumri are almost fully depreciated. \n \n3. \nFollowing  financial  difficulties  in  2015,  ENA  (which  is  privately  owned  and  the  only \nelectricity  distribution  company  in  Armenia)  was  purchased  by  Liormand  Holdings  Limited \n(Liormand)  from  an  affiliate  of  Inter  RAO  UES  (Russian  company).  The  new  investor  is  in  the \nprocess of upgrading the company\u2019s management and operations to bring them to international \nstandards.  Before  the  ownership  change  in  2015,  there  were  public  protests  because  of  the \nworsening quality and reliability of ENA\u2019s service at a time when tariffs were being increased. The \nGovernment of Armenia supported the change in ownership on the understanding that ENA would \nbe modernized and managed more efficiently. ENA\u2019s proposed 5-year investment program is the \nfirst  step  in  this  planned  transformation  and  has  been  approved  by  Armenia\u2019s  Public  Service \nRegulatory Commission (PSRC). ENA is seeking the support of multilateral development banks. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment will be jointly financing the project, which commenced in 2016 and is expected to \nbe completed by 2020. \n \n4. \nProject design. Under the new management and ownership, ENA launched the project \naimed at (i) improving the quality of the distribution network and services of its multisite operations \nacross  the  country;  (ii)  reducing  electricity  losses  and  operational  expenses;  (iii)  improving \ntechnical  maintenance  and  safety  conditions;  (iv)  modernizing  the  metering  system;  (v) \nrehabilitating,  reinforcing,  and  augmenting  the  distribution  network;  (vi) connecting  new \ncustomers;  and  (vii)  introducing  international  standards  of  management 3  and  an  automated \ncontrol system. This is expected to directly improve profitability, while keeping tariffs stable. The \nproject has the following key components: \n \n\n(i) \n\nNetwork  rehabilitation  and  reinforcement  [Confidential  information  deleted]. \nOutdated equipment and lines will be rehabilitated. The accumulated depreciation \nof  existing  equipment  ranges  from  66%  to  92%  for  most  categories,  which \nindicates the age of the equipment. Much of these will need to be replaced and \n\n                                                 \n1  CJSC = closed joint stock company is a legal entity, commonly found in the former Soviet Union, whose shares are \n\ndistributed among a limited number of shareholders with limited liability. \n2  ADB. 2014.

This  component  will \nalso  include  the  reconstruction  of  the  0.4 kV,  35  kV,  and  110  kV  distribution \nnetworks, as well as electric network improvement in apartment buildings. \n\nSpecial  projects  [Confidential  information  deleted].  Investments  to  reduce  the \nelectricity voltage deviations that exceed permitted limits will enhance the quality \nof supplied electricity and reduce network losses. \n\nSubstation \n[Confidential \nreconstruction  and  network  augmentation \ninformation deleted]. With the rapid expansion of the Yerevan city center and the \nconstruction of many new buildings, ENA implemented interim measures to cope \nwith  the  expansion.  Investments  related  to  the  connection  of  new  customers \naccount  for  81%  of  the  investment.  In  addition,  ENA  plans  to  reconstruct  and \nupgrade three important substations. \n\nAutomatic meter reading [Confidential information deleted]. The expansion and \nimprovement of ENA\u2019s automatic electricity metering system, mainly in the 0.4 kV \nand  6/10  kV  networks  (including  more  than  250,000  meter  installations  for  end \nconsumers), is being planned. The investment will allow a more efficient flow of \nelectricity and fewer power outages. The installation of automatic recording and \ncontrol systems will allow ENA to reduce commercial losses and manage systems \nmore efficiently. \n\nVehicles and special machinery [Confidential information deleted]. ENA plans to \npurchase  maintenance  vehicles  and  machinery  required  for  network  operations \nand maintenance. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nOther  investments  [Confidential  information  deleted].  The  introduction  of  an \nautomated control system and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) \nstandards of management will modernize overall planning and control functions as \nwell  as  customer  interface. This  component  includes the  purchase  of office  and \ntesting equipment, as well as the reconstruction of the administrative building. \n\n \n5. \nBorrower. As the sole and exclusive licensee for the distribution of electricity in Armenia, \nENA  is  responsible  for  the  maintenance  and  augmentation  of  the  distribution  network  and  is \nengaged in the purchase and regulated distribution of electricity. It is also the sole and exclusive \npurchaser  of  electricity  in  Armenia.  With  7,136  employees,  ENA  is  the  largest  employer  in \nArmenia.  ENA  owns  and  operates  8,793  110  kV,  35  kV,  and  6/10  kV  substations  and \ntransformation stations; 261 distribution stations; 31,980 kilometers of overhead distribution lines \nand  underground  cables;  193  110  kV  transformers;  and  382  35  kV  transformers. 4 ENA  has \n990,000  electricity  meters  (including  360,000  in  Yerevan  and  45,000  in  Gyumri)  to  measure \nelectricity consumed.5 \n \nENA\u2019s  customers  are the  entire  population  of  Armenia:  household  annual  consumption \n6. \nrepresents about 35% of electricity consumption; large customers (i.e., industry, transport, and \nwater supply and irrigation) account for about 30%: and the remaining 35% are public entities and \n\n                                                 \n4  Tetra Tech. 2017.

Table 3 summarizes the main implementation arrangements that determine \nENA\u2019s revenues and the implementation of the investment program. \n \n\nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nRegulatory framework \n\nArrangements \nThe Ministry of Energy Infrastructure and Natural Resources governs the \npower subsector. The Public Services Regulatory Commission (PSRC) is \nan independent regulatory body that regulates tariffs, licenses, service \nstandards, and trade provisions for companies in the power subsector. \nThe Energy Law, 2001 of Armenia is the main legislation for the power \nsubsector. The Electric Networks of Armenia (ENA) received a license to \ndistribute electricity in Armenia for an unlimited period. ENA\u2019s tariff is \napproved by PSRC as regulated in the Energy Law. The tariff regulation \nand ENA license set out the basis for calculating the necessary revenue \nrequired by ENA and this includes the permissible profit earned by ENA. \nProcurements carried out by ENA are subject to the requirements of the \nProcurement Law, 2005.  \nENA has a six-member management team that is led by Karen \nHarutyunyan, the general director who is supported by a director in charge \nof each of the following functions: (i) finance and economy; (ii) technical; \n(iii) sales; (iv) security and control; and (v) general operations. ENA is \nmanaged by a team of professionals with strong industry background. \nAsian Development Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment funding for the implementation of the investment program \nwill be drawn over 4 years in four tranches. \n \nThe industry regulator, PSRC, determines the revenue that ENA earns. \nENA\u2019s regulated revenue is an aggregate of several components, which \nincludes the cost of purchased power (including generation, transmission, \nand system operation costs); ENA\u2019s operating and maintenance costs; \ndepreciation of ENA\u2019s regulated asset base; allowance for uncollectable \nreceivables; and a reasonable economic return on ENA\u2019s regulated asset \nbase. \nManagement of operations and technical aspects related to ENA\u2019s \ndistribution network are undertaken by the employees of ENA. ENA has \nseparate departments that manage budgeting and planning, technical \nmanagement, and safety and inspections. ENA prepares demand \nforecasts and establishes its strategic development plans and operating \nand capital expenditure budgets based on these forecasts. \nKey performance indicators, including output and outcome indicators, will \nbe reported by ENA. \n\nManagement \n\nImplementation period \n\nOperations arrangements \n\nRevenue structure \n\nOperation and \nmaintenance \n\nPerformance monitoring \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\nF. \n \n18.

The potential environmental and social impacts of the investment plan are generally site-\nspecific, reversible, and mostly associated with decommissioning and installation activities. These \ntypically include issues on occupational and community health and safety, noise and vibration, \nsoil erosion due to soil excavations, and management of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes. \nManagement measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts will \nbe incorporated in the operational procedures of ENA and in the safeguard reports and plans of \nnew facilities.  \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \n\n \nC. \n \n21. \n \n22. \n \n23. \n \n24. \n \n25. \n \n\n \n\n\fInvoluntary resettlement impacts are not expected to be significant as reconstruction and \n27. \nrefurbishment  will  be  carried  out  within  the  existing  footprints  of  the  facilities,  without  need  for \nadditional land acquisition. New facilities such as substations and transformers, if required, will \nbe located on government lands after obtaining the required permission from the local authorities. \nThe  due  diligence  confirmed  that  ENA  does  not  typically  implement  any  projects  that  involve \ninvoluntary  resettlement  or  land  acquisition  and  selects  alternate  suitable  locations  on \ngovernment lands. ENA will establish screening and categorization procedures for environment \nand involuntary resettlement impacts as part of its environmental and social management system \n(ESMS), prepare and implement safeguard documents and plans, as required, and in accordance \nwith  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  Category  A  subprojects  for  environment  and  involuntary \nresettlement  impacts  are  unlikely  under  the  investment  program  given  the  nature  of  ENA\u2019s \noperations and the scale of the facilities proposed. The investment program is unlikely to trigger \nimpacts  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (IPs)  as  there  are  no  known  IPs,  as  per  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  definition,  in  Armenia.    A  grievance  redress  mechanism  will  be  adopted  to  address \ninternal  and  external  stakeholder  grievances.  Information  disclosure  and  consultation  with \naffected people will be conducted following ADB requirements. ENA has committed to strengthen \nits institutional capacity to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts. \n \n28. \nThe Lenders\u2019 consultant conducted a corporate audit on ENA\u2019s current ESMS and its past \nand current performance against the objectives, principles, and requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. The audit showed that while ENA is currently working on the implementation of \nfive  ISO  standards  (including  ISO  14001),  the  existing  procedures  are  mainly  established  to \naddress national requirements. The Lenders\u2019 consultant developed a corrective action plan, which \nENA  has  agreed  to  integrate  into  its  corporate  ESMS.  The  ESMS  will  (i)  formalize  an  internal \nsystem  that  outlines  ENA\u2019s  environmental  and  social  policies;  (ii)  establish  a  screening, \ncategorization,  safeguard  planning,  and  review  procedure  for  environment  and  involuntary \nresettlement  impacts  of  all  facilities  under  the  investment  program;  (iii)  rationalize  the \norganizational  structure and  staffing  to  manage environmental  and  social  safeguard  concerns; \n(iv)  conduct  continual  training  and  capacity-building  activities;  and  (v)  expand  monitoring  and \nreporting regimes. These will be included in the legal agreement between ADB and ENA. \n \n29. \nENA  will  comply  with  Armenia\u2019s  Labor  Code,  2004  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social \nProtection  Strategy  (2001),  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  internationally  recognized  core \nlabor standards.11 The borrower will report regularly to ADB on (i) its compliance with such laws, \nand (ii) the measures taken. Information disclosure and consultation with affected people will be \nconducted following ADB requirements (footnote 20). \n \nB. \n \n30. \nENA was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism.
